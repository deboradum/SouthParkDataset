Safe Space

[South Park Elementary, day. Cartman sits in PC Prinicpal's office hyperventilating, teary-eyed. PC Principal and Mr. Mackey both look at him.]
PC PRINCIPAL
So these guys made fun of your weight and made you feel ashamed?
CARTMAN
[voice shaking terribly] Yes, I was just trying to do my job as a food critic and they all ganged up on me and said I was fat.
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright, why don't you take me back to what happened?
CARTMAN
I was in the locker room. I was in my underwear and these kids walked by [Craig and Clyde appear around the corner] Then I looked in the mirror and I thought I looked kind of ripped, and so I asked one of the kids [Clyde] if he would take a picture of me [holding two dumbbells, one in each hand] and he did. And I looked at the picture and I looked pretty ripped, so later at home, I put the picture up on my Yelp account and I typed in "Don't I look ripped?" and I thought people would be stoked on me. Then this morning I saw the comments on Twitter and some people called me names and said I wasn't ripped, and they said that I was fat and I didn't have muscles. The Internet made fun of me and [is overcome with emotion and hyperventilates. PC Principal sniffs and clears his throat.]
MR. MACKEY
Well, Eric, maybe you shouldn't have put a picture of you in your underwear up on social media.
PC PRINCIPAL
[jumps up and faces Mr. Mackey] Hey! You got a fuckin' problem, Mackey!
MR. MACKEY
N-No, PC Principal.
PC PRINCIPAL
Because body-shaming is fuckin' serious, and I'm not gonna allow that shit in my school! [faces Cartman] Nobody should have to feel that kind of shame!
[Whole Foods Market, day. Liane walks out with her groceries, Randy walks around inside marveling at all the stuff. Next, he's in Checkout 5 having his purchases scanned.]
CASHIER
Okay. sir, looks like your total is $37.83.
RANDY
[pulls out his wallet and takes out $40] Alright.
CASHIER
[checks the monitor] Okay, and, would you like to add a dollar donation to help hungry kids around the world?
RANDY
[real quiet] Oh, uh, no, that, that's okay.
CASHIER
Sorry?
RANDY
[real quiet] I'm, I'm good.
CASHIER
[having trouble hearing him clearly] I'm sorry, you don't want to give the dollar to hungry kids?
RANDY
[real quiet] Not today, thank you.
CASHIER
Okay, no problem. [punches in the last few numbers into the register.] A window's gonna come up and ask if you're helping the hungry kids, just hit "No, I'm not."
RANDY
[real quiet] Oh, come on.
CASHIER
Try hitting it again. It's the box below the one that says, "Sure, I'd love to help however I can." [Randy hits the button again... and again a few more times, but it only beeps twice. The cashier looks at it.] Ah, darn thing. Sorry. Most people give the dollar. I can do this manually. [turns to the register and taps a few keys]
RANDY
Look, I give money to charity a lot, okay?
CASHIER
Oh, sure you do.
RANDY
I do. I just don't want to every time I shop for food.
CASHIER
That's completely understandable. [reads something] "Have customer speak on the-" Oh-okay. if you can just speak into the voice decoder and say "I'm not giving anything to the hungry kids."
RANDY
[leans in and speaks into the "decoder"] I'm not giving anything to the hungry kids. [his voice echoes throughout the store, and everyone takes notice]
CASHIER
Okay, that's got it. So with the ice cream, the vodka, pizza pockets, and nothing for hungry kids, that's $37.83. [getting a bit sarcastic] Oh, don't forget your change.
RANDY
Look, if I give money every time I went grocery-shopping, I would be-!
CASHIER
[cuts him off] Thanks for shopping, sir. Next, please.
RANDY
[takes his paper bag full of groceries and leaves] Dick!
[PC Principal's office, moments. PC Principal opens the door and Kyle walks in.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Morning, Kyle. Have a seat right there. [Kyle takes the seat next to Cartman and is instantly displeased] You probably heard that Eric here has been dealing with some body shaming? [Cartman is still whimpering]
KYLE
Uh huh.
PC PRINCIPAL
Well, Eric and I have been talking, and we've decided it's probably best for him to get off of social media.
KYLE
Yeah probably.
PC PRINCIPAL
So what we're looking for is a student volunteer. Somebody who can put the things Eric wants up on the Internet for him and also filter through all the comments and make it more of a safe space for him.
KYLE
Wait, what?
CARTMAN
I said you were perfect because you're really good at getting all your schoolwork done on time [gathers his thoughts] so you'd probably do a really good job.
KYLE
You want me to run Cartman's Twitter and Yelp account and only give him the good comments?
PC PRINCIPAL
That's right.
KYLE
No.
PC PRINCIPAL
Kyle, you know what body-shaming is, right? How much it can hurt someone's life? All you have to do is check out all the comments, type out just the positive ones, and give that to Eric on paper.
KYLE
If he doesn't like what people say on Twitter, he can get off. [Cartman begins to cry]
PC PRINCIPAL
Okay, Kyle, well maybe you'd like two weeks' detention instead.
KYLE
[a bit stunned, considers his options] Give me... give me detention.
PC PRINCIPAL
You sure about that?
KYLE
Yeah, I'll take the detention.
PC PRINCIPAL
That's two weeks' detention for you, bud! I'll see you at 4! [Kyle looks at Eric, gets up, and leaves. Next, PC Principal is talking to another student] And when we said someone should probably help Eric by filtering out any negative comments, he mentioned you by name.
WENDY
Is this a joke?
CARTMAN
I'm not a joke!
PC PRINCIPAL
Nothing funny about this, Testaburger! This is a big problem in our country!
WENDY
I'm not doing it.
PC PRINCIPAL
And that's two weeks' detention for you! Congratulations! [Wendy looks at Eric, gets up, and leaves. Next, PC Principal is talking to another student] So, any comments that seem inappropriate or hurtful in any way, you need to delete and not include in your daily report to Eric. [Butters is shown next to Cartman now]
CARTMAN
I wanted someone smart and hard-working!
BUTTERS
Do I gotta?
PC PRINCIPAL
You want detention?
BUTTERS
Well, if I get detention, uh, I'll get grounded.
PC PRINCIPAL
Then you start today! Butters, it's your job to make sure Eric has a safe space.
[Whole Foods Market, day. Randy is at a salad bar creating his own salad. A female shopper is making one too, and their tongs clash over greens]
FEMALE SHOPPER
Oh, ahhh, I'm sorry.
RANDY
Oh no, my, my fault.
FEMALE SHOPPER
Isn't it great having a Whole Foods?
RANDY
This is where I come for lunch every day. Gotta eat healthy to stay fit. [pleased at this encounter. He turns to leave and sees the cashier from before, who waves back at him. To himself] Aw, shit, it's that guy. [as no one else is waiting, he goes ahead and makes his purchases]
CASHIER
Aand how are you today, sir?
RANDY
Great. [leans in and in a low voice] Uh, listen, before you ring me up, I just wanna let you know I'm not gonna be giving extra money to charity, so can we, can we just skip that part?
CASHIER
Oh, no problem, sir, they've updated the system so it's a lot more streamlined now. Find everything you need today?
RANDY
Yeah, thanks.
CASHIER
There we go, and that's... Okay, and would you like to give a dollar to hungry kids today?
RANDY
[softly] No. I said no, before.
CASHIER
Oh that's right. Okay, there's a picture of a little hungry boy. Will you just press on his belly? [Randy does so, and hears "Oww, owww." The cashier checks the readout] Okay, that's got it. So, with the no help for hungry kids that's $18.87. [Randy hands him a $20 bill] Out of 20. [the cashier gives him some change back in the coin return tray] Your change is right there, just pull the sandwich out of the little girl's mouth. [a cardboard cutout of a little girl hides the coin return]
RANDY
This is not streamlined!
CASHIER
It's just the new change dispenser, sir. [Randy then goes ahead and tries to pull the sandwich away]
RANDY
[a couple of grunts later] I can't.
CASHIER
Yes, she's a hungry one. You've gotta pull hard.
RANDY
Dammit! The sandwich isn't coming out.
CASHIER
Try putting your foot on her face. [Randy promptly does this. He also notices the woman he bumped into earlier in Checkout 4 and flashes a smile to her. Finally he pulls the sandwich out of the cutout's mouth and gets his change and his groceries] Have a nice day, sir!
RANDY
I was having a nice day! [leaves the store]
[South Park Elementary hallway, day. Cartman puts his books into his locker and closes it. As he walks away, Butters appears around the corner and catches up to him.]
BUTTERS
[sounding quite tired] Eric, hold up.
CARTMAN
There you are. You have my social media comments?
BUTTERS
Yeah. Yeah, right here. [hands him the papers] I just finished this morning.
CARTMAN
[reviews them] Mm-hm. Hm-oh, that's nice. Oh great. This is all the Twitter comments?
BUTTERS
Yeah. And the people commenting on your Yelp page starts here. [points to the first comment on the current page]
CARTMAN
Okay, nice. Oh ni- oh, very enthusiastic. This is so great! [turns around and walks by Kyle, who's at his locker.] Oh Kyle! You thought me having someone edit my social media would make me look stupid? You should see all the comments I'm getting. People are actually really stoked on me now.
BUTTERS
It's a pretty brutal job sifting through all that darkness.
[South Park Elementary gym, later. The whole school is in attendance as PC Principal introduces someone.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright everyone, listen up. In order to better understand the negative effects of body-shaming, we have a- [points to someone on the bleachers] HEY, LESLIE! PUT A FUCKIN' SOCK IN IT! [Leslie was whispering to Esther again, and again she backs off slowly] We have a guest speaker today who will challenge our perceptions of physical beauty. [steps towards a screen upon which is a graphic that says "NO MORE FAT SHAMING"] So please welcome action star and hero, Steven Seagal. [claps a few times, then puts the mic into a mic stand and steps aside as music plays. Real life pictures of a slimmer Seagal from his early films pop up as a slide show]
STEVEN SEAGAL
[voice-over] You've got a problem with me? I'm your worse nightmare. I have no fear of death, more important, I don't fear life. [gun shot sound effect. The slide show ends and an obese Seagal walks into the gym with a gun drawn. He gets to the mic and begins to whimper, and lowers the gun] I'm a big action movie star and people are pretty stoked on me. And then I put a picture of myself up on the Internet and I had my shirt off and I said "Do you think I'm ripped?" and some people commented saying I didn't look ripped, that I was fat, and they called me Steven Se-boom-boom, so I put another picture on the Internet and I thought people would be stoked on me, but they said that I looked like a fat turd, and they said I wasn't buff. [hyperventilates] Body-shaming isn't cool, and, if p-people shame you on the Inter n-net, you have to make sure that you stay, you stay strong and tell everyone you're proud of how you look, like this. [begins to shuffle dance and clap as "Got To Be Real" starts playing]
[The school hallway, later. Steven is headed out and PC Principal catches up to him.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Hey, Seagal! Listen, that was a really amazing talk you gave to the kids.
STEVEN SEAGAL
[sniffs] Thank you.
PC PRINCIPAL
I can see that you're in a lot of pain, bro. I've got someone who I think can help.
[PC Principal's office. An exhausted Butters is sitting next to a sobbing Seagal as PC Principal makes his case]
PC PRINCIPAL
So I want you to do for Mr. Seagal the same thing that you're doing for Eric Cartman.
BUTTERS
But, PC Principal, I really don't have time.
PC PRINCIPAL
This man took the time to come to your school and help spread body-shaming awareness! I think you can give him a little of your time!
BUTTERS
Yes sir...
[Whole Foods Market, later. Randy is back to buy more groceries. He's back at Checkout 5 with the same cashier as before]
CASHIER
Find everything you needed today?
RANDY
Yes.
CASHIER
Okay, looks like your total comes to $37.98. Would you like to give a dollar to help feed hungry kids?
RANDY
Yes, I would like to give a dollar.
CASHIER
[surprised] You want to give a dollar?
RANDY
Yes, I will.
CASHIER
[excited sounding] Oh wow, okay! So that's $10 for the beer, $4.20 in chocolate-covered peanuts, $26 in filet mignons, [sarcastically] and one dollar for hungry kids around the world. On "amount of donation" it will say $10, $20, or $50, can you just press the "$1" box? [Randy does so and bells, sirens, and colored lights go off. The cashier gets on the mic and says] Attention shoppers, somebody just joined the $1 club, giving one whole dollar to help feed hungry children. [quickly goes around the checkout] Here's your T-shirt! [quickly slips it on Randy and takes a picture, then prints the picture. The shirt says "I Gave $1.00 to End Hunger." The cashier pins the picture on the "$1" cork board, which was empty before] Ho, won't the kids be thrilled when they get their piece of that big impressive dollar. [walks back to his register and sings] For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow! He ended world hunger. [Randy takes his groceries and leaves, whimpering]
[Butter's house, afternoon, bedroom. Butters is toiling away at his computer.]
BUTTERS
Yech. Oh God that's terrible. Jesus.
DEMI LOVATO
[sitting on Butters' bed] Yeah. No, I'm telling you, Tracy, it's the greatest thing ever. I'm getting all my Twitter and Instagram comments on paper, and the nasty mean stuff, all gets edited out.
BUTTERS
Whoa my God. Wugh.
DEMI LOVATO
Yeah. And the coolest thing? Ever since I started using this service, all of my followers are actually way more stoked on me. So cool, right?
CARTMAN
Butters!
BUTTERS
[startled] Yeah!
CARTMAN
[at the bedroom door] What the hell is this? The last report you gave me has a comment that says "This picture of you burned my eyes, fatso!"
BUTTERS
Well, I'm sorry, Eric. I, I guess it slipped through the cracks. I'm overloaded with all the new people.
CARTMAN
What new people? [walks up to the computer]
BUTTERS
Well, I've got Demi Lovato [points to her] to take care of now, and Lena Dunham just put a picture of her asshole on Twitter, and wants only the positive comments.
CARTMAN
Dude, fuck Demi Lovato! She's fuckin' hot, she's not being fat-shamed!
DEMI LOVATO
[stands up] Am so! But I don't care. People just have to accept my body the way it is.
CARTMAN
Butters, I want this fixed by tonight! You got that?!
BUTTERS
Okay, Eric. [Cartman walks away]
[A commercial. "Amazing Grace" plays with a female voice. A poor community is shown. Randy walks among the poor folk]
RANDY
This is a place where hope is scarce. These people are hungry. Little Jojo here might not eat today. But does that mean it's okay for cashiers to ask us for money while we're in the checkout line? It isn't right, and it isn't fair. Just $2 a day adds up to 62 goddamned dollars a month if you go to Whole Foods as much as I do. Nobody should have to feel the shame, the humiliation, of being asked to add money onto their grocery bill. Help now. Let's make grocery stores a #SAFESPACE for all. Together, we can make a difference.
GIRL
Because charity-shaming hurts everyone. [Randy holds her a bit closer]
[PC Principal's office, day. He and Mr. Mackey are talking to someone]
PC PRINCIPAL
You know, if there's one thing I really respect, it's plus-sized models who challenge the idea of what makes a woman beautiful. These ladies are gonna be part of a big ad campaign for plus-sized lingerie, and we wanna make sure they're protected from any harassing comments.
BUTTERS
[Butters is seated across from PC Principal with an entire row of plus-sized women in lingerie] Do I have to, sir?
PC PRINCIPAL
Hey, they're gonna putting themselves out there, and all I'm asking you to do is go through their social media and delete the two or three comments that are mean.
BUTTERS
PC Principal, ah, I don't think you quite realize how much negative stuff I have to sift through.
PC PRINCIPAL
I know it's a lot, but I just really need you to help these plus-sized models. And Vin Diesel.
BUTTERS
Vin Diesel too??
PC PRINCIPAL
Look bro! You've done an amazing job with Eric Cartman. You have really turned his life around, and other people deserve... to be as happy as he is.
[South Park Elementary hallway. A piano begins to play a song, and Cartman sings first. Soon, an abstract space appears in which are tiny rooms - a safe space - one for each person singing]
CARTMAN
Everyone likes me and thinks I'm great in my safe spaaaace.
SEAGAL
My safe spaaaace.
CARTMAN
[eating in a restaurant, Butters hands him more comments] People don't judge me and haters don't hate in my safe spaaaace. [An exhausted Butters is hard at work in his room]
PC PRINCIPAL
Your safe spaaaace.
CARTMAN AND SEAGAL
[standing in a floating tiny room] Bully-proof windows, troll-safe doors, nothing but kindness and healing.
RANDY
You might call me a pussy, but I won't hear you in my safe spaaaace.
SEAGAL
My safe spaaaace.
CARTMAN
Bully-proof windows.
DEMI LOVATO
[standing under a spotlight] If you do not like me, you are not allowed in my safe spaaaace.
PLUS-SIZED MODELS
My safe spaaaace
PC PRINCIPAL
[inside the pricipal's office with Butters, he then hands Vin Disel more comments] Look and you will see there's a very select crowd in your safe spaaaace. [Steven Seagal is resting on a bed in his safe space]
ALL
My safe spaaaace.
CARTMAN
People that support me.
ALL
Mixed in with
CARTMAN
More people that support me.
ALL
And say nice things. Rainbows all around me, there is no shame in my safe spaaaace.
RANDY
My safe spaaaace.
CARTMAN
Bully-proof windows. [a change in tempo as villianous music plays and a masked villain enters the video.]
REALITY
I am going to tear down your safe space! Brick by brick, I shall smash it with glee!
CARTMAN
What? Who is that?
REALITY
You cannot stop me from getting inside! I am cold and I am hard, and my name... is Reality.
DEMI LOVATO
Oh no, not reality! Somebody stop him!
CARTMAN
I'll take care of him, Demi! [shoots lightning from his hands, and the various people in their safe spaces are now dressed to dance!]
ALL
[faster rock music begins playing] You can't ruin our lives, Reality!
CARTMAN
Our safe spaces will keep you out!
REALITY
Drat!
ALL
We can face almost anything!
CARTMAN
But Reality we can do without!
REALITY
Nooooo... [vanishes, as the original piano music resumes]
CARTMAN
Bully-proof windows.
ALL
Troll-safe doors. [slowing down] My Safe Spaaaaaaaace! [all stop]
CARTMAN
That was nice.
[Whole Foods Market, day. The cashier at Checkout 5 sends one shopper off]
CASHIER
All right, thanks, have a great day. [Randy steps up] Good afternoon sir.
RANDY
[self-assured] Oh, hello. You might know Steven Seagal [who steps up, with his gun aimed at the cashier]
STEVEN SEAGAL
You wanna play with me?
RANDY
And this is Vin Diesel.
CASHIER
Oh, hello gentlemen.
RANDY
It'd be... a really bad idea for you to charity-shame me today. These guys are here to protect my safe space.
CASHIER
That's great. [hums to himself as he scans Randy's items]
This little piggy went to market.
This little piggy stayed home.
This little piggy was in Fast And The Furious, [Vin Diesel begins to whimper and walks away]
and this little piggy goes direct to cable.[Steven Seagal begins to whimper and walks away]
[jabs Randy in the belly] And this little piggy just bought fifty-three dollars in beer and frozen pizzas. Would you like to make a dollar donation to hungry kids today?
[A second commercial. We're back in the poor community. "Amazing Grace" plays with a deep male voice, and Demi Lovato walks in]
DEMI LOVATO
Look around you. What do you see? People who are slim. Skinny. But not everyone can have nice bodies like them. Just imagine it. Putting your pictures up on Twitter just to have some people write comments about your weight. It happens, all too often.
RANDY
[taking over] But it doesn't stop there. People also can be shamed for other traits viewed as negative. Mike here was shamed for not being a good recycler.
DEMI LOVATO
And so together, we have created #shamelessAmerica, [a screen pops up with "let's work towards a #shamelessAmerica."] so no one is ever labeled...
FAT WOMAN
Tubby.
MAN WITH CAP
Bad with tools.
WOMAN 2
Dyke!
MAN 2
Butter butter dirty line cutter.
RANDY
Let's work together to create a completely shameless America.
BOY
[emaciated] Because shaming hurts everyone. [Randy holds him a bit closer]
[Butters' room, night. He's editing out negative comments on Demi Lovato's social media pages before printing them]
BUTTERS
[reading through online messages] "Hey Demi Lovato, I bet your vagina has a-" [begins to gag] oh. Oh God. Oh, that's horrible [picks up a waste basket and vomits into it] Augh. [coughs] Jeez. Delete. Delete that too. [continues reading comments aloud] "I'd like to stick my wiener into those fat rolls of-" [villianous piano music begins to play] Oh God! [Reality sneaks into his room and paces behind Butter's chair] Uh, delete! "You aren't fat, but my dick is-" Whoa, God.
REALITY
HaHAA!
BUTTERS
GAAAHHH!
REALITY
So you're the one trying to destroy me, eh??
BUTTERS
What? [falls out of his chair. Reality tries to grab him, but misses. Butters runs to a night stand]
REALITY
You little shit! Keep me out, will you?
BUTTERS
I don't know you, sir!
REALITY
You can't stop me! [tries to grab Butters again, but breaks the lamp on the night stand] I'm going to kill you! [jumps up to fall on him. At that moment, the bedroom door opens]
STEPHEN
Butters! What are you doing?!
BUTTERS
[panicked] Well-ll, the man! Uh, the man is gonna get me! [Butters points to where Reality was standing only for the shot to widen showing he is no longer there]
[Whole Foods Market, day. The cashier is ringing Randy up.]
CASHIER
And some chocolate-covered almonds. Vanderpump Sangria mix.
RANDY
Yeah, um, I'm a little tired because I'm actually hosting a huge fundraiser for my charity organization [shows off his shirt: "#ShamelessAmerica"] that I'm sort of the head of.
CASHIER
That's great, sir. Ice cream sandwiches.
RANDY
Yeah, we're gonna raise a lot of money. Celebrities are coming. Demi Lovato is givin' a hundred thousand for the event.
CASHIER
Wonderful. Rotisserie chicken. Oh yep, gotta have that Frank's hot sauce.
RANDY
I just thought, you know, a fundraiser dinner was sort of the appropriate place to ask for donations.
CASHIER
That's great, sir. Okay, your total is $37.85, and would you like to give a dollar to help put a hamster through college?
RANDY
[stunned] ...What? Did you not hear anything I said? I'm - I'm doin' all this stuff.
CASHIER
Not a problem, sir. [takes out a hamster from behind the counter] If you could just press the N0 button and tell the little hamster he's not going to college. Just look him right in the eye, sir, and say "Not today, buddy."
RANDY
Actually, my big fundraising gala is helping put hamsters through college too.
CASHIER
[Excited] Oh, really? Wow. Did you hear that, Banjo? You've got support. [puts the hamster back behind the counter] Well, you have a nice day sir. [hands Randy his receipt] And thank so much for being so generous.
RANDY
You're welcome. [takes his groceries, but has no bag to put them in. He doesn't mind]
[South Park Elementary hallway. Stan, Kyle, Davíd and Kenny walk along when Cartman interrupts them.]
CARTMAN
Hey, Kyle. You wanna see what people said about my dick pic? Everyone's pretty stoked on it.
KYLE
There's more than two people on the Internet.
BUTTERS
The man! The man the man the man the man! [runs around the corner completely naked] The man he's gonna get me! He shadows me everywhere! [stops another student and gets in his face] Do you see the man?!
KYLE
[turns him around] Butters, what are you doing?! [the other student leaves]
BUTTERS
Well, he's gonna get me!
KYLE
Dude, Butters, you're seeing things! Sifting through all the horrible stuff people say on the Internet is making you lose it!
BUTTERS
[breaks free and runs off] The world is darkness! The man is coming!
STAN
Dude, Butters! [he and Kyle give chase. Butters goes up a flight of stairs]
BUTTERS
Aaaaa! Aaaaa!
[Kindergarten, day. The teacher quizzes the kids on a story]
TEACHER
And what color is the little ball the kittens are playing with?
BUTTERS
[runs into the classroom] Run for your lives, you little fuckers, the man is coming! [the kids scream as Kyle enters the room. Stan, Davíd and Kenny follow him in]
KYLE
Butters, listen to my voice.
BUTTERS
The man is gonna get me if I don't stop!
KYLE
Then stop, dude! Butters, all this isn't worth it. Just. Take, the detention, dude.
BUTTERS
[thinks a moment and jumps through a glass window on the second floor] YEEAAAAAGGHH! [hits the snow hard]
[South Park Community Center, Night, Shameless America Charity Event. Guests arrive in limousines. Gerald steps out of one and goes inside. Randy is hosting. Fanfare plays]
RANDY
Alright everyone, thanks for coming to help raise money to stop shaming, and put hamsters through college.
GUEST
What'd he say?
RANDY
And now, a woman who knows about shaming firsthand, supermodel Gigi Hadid.
GIGI
Alright, everyone enjoying themselves? How's that filet mignon? [approving comments all around] You know, we're all here for a really important reason. Because everyone should-
STEPHEN
Randy, Randy, we've got a problem.
RANDY
What?
STEPHEN
Reality's here. He's trying to crash the party.
RANDY
Reality? Who let him in? Shit! [leaves to face him]
REALITY
[making a nuisance of himself at a table, spills a glass of wine] Woo, nice wine, huh? What do you think of that? [tips another glass over] You know what I think of your pretty flowers? [grabs the centerpiece bouquet and throws it to the ground, then dumps a guest's dinner on his lap] There you go. How do you like that? [Randy and Stephen arrive]
RANDY
Alright buddy, let's go.
REALITY
I shit on all of you!
RANDY
Seagal?! [Steven Seagal approaches with gun drawn and aimed at Reality]
REALITY
[to Seagal, Randy, and three guests] Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you! [jumps over the table and rushes the stage, then grabs the mic from Gigi Hadid] Give me that, you stupid bitch! [she walks off] What a lovely charity event. I suppose you're all feeling pretty good about yourselves, hm? What have you done? You've raised $300 by spending half a million on filet mignon and crystal glasses. [crowd is silenced and ashamed at themselves] Look at you, Vin Dipshit. You think fat-shaming is wrong, so in response you show off your abs. You're the one fat-shaming, idiot! What's the matter with you people?! You're saaad that people are meeean? Well I'm sorry, the world isn't one big liberal arts college campus! We eat too much; we take our spoiled lives for granted, feel a little bad about it sometimes! No, you wanna put up all your shit on the Internet and have every single person say "Hooray for you!" Fuck you. You're all pricks. And I've got news for you! While you've all been sitting here trying to feel good, the little boy who sucked all your shit is about to die from it!
SEAGAL
What?
[Hell's Pass hospital, later. Butters is in a recovery room with tubes going into him and wires attached to him. Steven Seagal and Vin Diesel are there with the plus-sized models, Demi Lovato, Gigi Hadid, PC Principal, Stephen, and others]
DEMI LOVATO
Oh my God. What have we done?
SEAGAL
Jesus, I d-I didn't even think.
PC PRINCIPAL
I guess... I asked too much of one kid.
RANDY
Listen, everybody. [the group splits in two so the camera can see him] I think there's a way to try and make this right for everyone.
[A third commercial. We're back in the poor community. "Amazing Grace" plays with an organ, and a choir joins in later]
RANDY
To date, Shameless America has raised over $40,000. With that money, we are putting more and more iPads into these people's hands. [all the kids look at the iPads, not sure what to do with them] With iPads, these people can finally help more Americans get rid of negativity on their social media. [Jojo returns with an iPad, handing it to Randy] Oh, thanks Jojo. I'm shame-free now, and you can be too. For just $1 a day, one of these beautiful children will protect you from trolls and make your Internet a safe space. [a screen pops up with "We won't rest until America is #completelyshameless"] We won't rest until America is completely shameless. The world can be brutal, but Shameless America is going to continue to take steps to make sure everyone has a safe space... forever.
[South Park Town Square, day. The stage is set for a hanging. Reality has a noose around his neck, and Butters is set to be the executioner. Butters is out of the hospital with a head brace and a crutch]
BUTTERS

RANDY
Uh huh. [Butters pulls the lever and the trap door opens underneath Reality, making him drop and hang. After some choking, Reality dies and the crowd erupts in cheers]
End of Safe Space
