It's a Jersey Thing
[]
[The Broflovski house, dining room table, evening. The family is gathered at table eating dinner]
KYLE
Mom, Dad, what's "muff cabbage"? [Gerald and Sheila pause. They look at each other, then turn back to their son]
GERALD
[confused] Muff cabbage?
SHEILA
[also confused] Where did you hear that?
IKE
Muff cabbage!
KYLE
The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop "muff cabbage".
IKE
Muff cabbage.
SHEILA
A new family moved in? Where are they from?
KYLE
She said they're from New Jersey.
SHEILA
[drops her fork] New Jersey? A family from New Jersey moved in next to the Marshes?
KYLE
Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.
SHEILA
[fearful, quickly leaves her chair and walks off a bit] Oh, God. Poor Sharon. Doesn't she know?
KYLE
Know what, Ma?
IKE
Muff cabbage!
SHEILA
Never invite a New Jersey housewife into your home.
[The Marsh house, dinner time. The table has been enlarged to accommodate their guests - a family with three kids. Grandpa Marsh is not at the table]
TERESA
[at the head of the table. Sharon is to her right] And so then I met the school principal. What's her name? Principal Victoria? What a stupid bitch! I mean, excuse my language, but that bitch needs her fuckin' head examined!
[Teresa's new home, next door, on New Jersey Housewives]
TERESA
Yeah, so my family and I moved from Jersey to South Park about a week ago. So far, I can tell that everyone here really likes me.
[The Marsh house, dinner time]
TERESA
Oh! And I met that Stotch woman. What's her name?
SHARON
Oh, Linda, huh?
TERESA
Have you noticed how yellow that bitch's teeth are? You can tell that woman is a piece of garbage. She's garbage! [the girls at the table just look on and continue eating] I went into the mall here and I just about dropped dead. The only panties you can buy makes you look like you got a grandma muff! Where's the Gucci? Where's the Prada? Have they heard of Italian clothes? It's ridiculous!
JOE
[as Teresa rattles on] So, Randy, what gyms are good around here? Where do you work out?
RANDY
I don't really work out.
JOE
Well, I gotta find somethin'. [flexes his left biceps] My biceps are goin' flat.
TERESA
Where can you get good clothes in this town?! Nowhere! I mean, that's why you're stuck wearing garbage like that, right? And the woman that works the hair salon? Julia? Have you seen how big that bitch's ears are?
SHARON
Oh, Julia's a friend of mine, yeah.
TERESA
Ears out to here! [spreads her arms out as far as they could go] So I tell her, "You got big ears, sweetie." I'm not trying to be mean. It's just a Jersey thing. Why be offended? [to Sharon] I mean, you've got a big chin. We've all got imperfections.
SHARON
Right, just like your eyes are kind of far apart. [Teresa's expression changes to a dark mood]
[Teresa's new home, next door, on New Jersey Housewives]
TERESA
That was totally uncalled for, for what she did. My eyes are too far apart? And like who is she? Is she God? No.
[The Marsh house, dinner time]
TERESA
You don't ever, ever! You whack job, prostitution... [slams her hands on the table] ...whore! You probably sell your muff... [slams her hands on the table] ...for six dollars! You fucking psycho bitch! Fuck you! [lifts the table, which causes it to dump the food on the floor. Sharon quickly hides behind Randy] You're nothin' but garbage! [Joe comes up and restrains her from behind] That's what you are! You're garbage! [Stan's eyes dart back and forth] You sick, old woman! Muff garbage! [Joe takes her into the kitchen] Muff cabbage! Fuck this psycho bitch!
SHARON
Wow.
TERESA
Let's get the fuck outta here! She's a fuckin' pig! She's fuckin' pissin' me off! [to Joe] Okay, I love you.
JOE
Take it easy.
TERESA
I love you. [they kiss] I love you.
[Teresa's new home]
TERESA
I thought I was gonna deck her. I was fine. I was really fine. I just wanted to get my point across to her, and then that's how I am. [she takes Joe's hand and walks him back into the dining room] Like I could be mad one minute and then I'll be fine.
[The Marsh house, dinner time]
TERESA
Okay, all better. Just had to get that out. It's just... it's a Jersey thing. So, who wants dessert? Meeee!
[At Sizzler, day. The boys are having lunch there]
STAN
You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!
CARTMAN
You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep.
KYLE
[glaring at him] Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?
CARTMAN
Oops, busted. [avoids eye contact]
STAN
They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, "Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing."
JERSEY MAN
Hey, you talkin' 'bout Jersey? Me and my friends are from Jersey.
CARTMAN
Aw, crap, there's more of them?
JERSEY MAN
'Ey, come on, there's people from Jersey all over! Who here is from Jersey? [a lot of people respond excitedly]
[Highlight. The Jersey man is Steve "Last Call"]
STEVE "LAST CALL"
So I'm like standin' there, and I'm like, "Who's from Jersey?", and people are all like, "Yo! Woo-hoo!" Next thing you know, Jersey party at Sizzler. [the restaurant is transformed into a club]
[Sizzler, later on. Everyone is dancing except the boys, music is pumping, lights flash all around]
WOMAN
[nude in a in a Jacuzzi] Yeah, let's get this party started. [a random fight breaks out]
KYLE
Where the hell are they coming from?! [a bottle of Corona beer lands in front of the boys and shatters]
[South Park Salon, day. Sharon approaches it. Inside...]
TERESA
Danielle was being a stupid bitch.
WOMAN 1
Shut up, Teresa. You're pathetic!
TERESA
I'm pathetic? You're muff cabbage! [Sharon walks into the salon. Teresa gets up to greet her] Oh, Sharon! [they hug] Hi, sweetie. You gotta meet our new neighbors. This is Jacqueline. She's from Jersey.
JACQUELINE
And Sicilian.
TERESA
That's Danielle. She's from Jersey. [Danielle is extremely tanned] And that's Caroline.
CAROLINE
I'm having my face shaved. It's a Jersey thing.
SALON GIRL
I'm sorry, but I have other clients in ten minutes. Can you sit down? [Teresa didn't like that request]
[Highlight.]
JACQUELINE
When the salon girl told Teresa to sit down, I thought Teresa was gonna bust a tit.
[the salon]
TERESA
Don't you fuckin' tell me what to do! I'm a client here!
CAROLINE
Teresa! Calm down.
SALON GIRL
I don't have to take your shit! I'm from Jersey!
TERESA
Get her, Sharon!
SHARON
What?
JACQUELINE
Sharon, just stay out of it!
CAROLINE
Be the bigger person, Sharon!
SHARON
You people are crazy.
CAROLINE
Who's crazy? Are you talkin' about my family?! [grabs Sharon by the hair as she screams] Is my family crazy?!
TERESA
Don't you pull my friend's hair, you bitch! [pulls Sharon back by the hair]
SHEILA
[barges in ready to fight] Let go of her, you piece of trash! [the other ladies turn to look]
TERESA
Who the fuck are you to tell ME what to do?!
SHEILA
[walks up to the women] All you trashy whores get the fuck out of here and leave her alone!
TERESA
Psycho bitch!
SHEILA
[slaps her hand away] No! You're a psycho bitch, psycho bitch! Psycho biiitch! You wanna see fuckin' crazy?! You'd better just step the fuck away or you're gonna see fuckin' crazy! [the Jersey women begin to leave]
JACQUELINE
[turns to look at Sheila] You're cabbage! [then leaves]
SHARON
Sheila?
[At the South Park Community Center, evening. Randy has the floor as the other townsfolk sit and listen]
RANDY
People of South Park! We have all noticed a steep rise in everything Jersey lately. As many of you already know, everything east of the Rockies is now part of New Jersey! The Jersey Shore now includes Jacksonville, Miami, the Gulf of Jersey Mexico, and the Jersey Islands. [this includes Puerto Rica and Cuba]
MR. GARRISON
Jesus! Why are they doing this?
RANDY
More people from Jersey are showing up in our town! If we don't do something, South Park is going to become West Jersey.
JIMBO
Well, that does it! Let's go tell everyone from Jersey we don't want 'em here!
ALL
Yeah!
SHEILA
That won't work. You can't just tell people from Jersey you don't like them. No matter how obnoxious they are, they will convince themselves that you all actually think they're cool.
JIMBO
How do you know that, Ms. Broflovski? [Sheila is on the spot.]
[Highlight.]
SHEILA
That's when I knew I had to tell everyone the truth: that originally I'm from Jersey. [the adults present are Stephen and Linda Stotch, Randy and Sharon Marsh, Stuart McCormick, his wife, and Liane Cartman] Yes, born and raised, I wasn't even called Sheila back then. In Jersey I was known as S-Woww Tittybang. [a picture of her is shown] I drank heavily and punched a lot of bitches in the face. [a picture of one such incident is shown] Living in South Park, I'm able to control the Jersey side of me, which doesn't really come out unless I get around other people from Jersey. [turns away from the other adults] I'm just really hoping that people here don't judge me for it, or or, somehow, you know, hold it against me.
SHARON
Sheila, who are you talking to?
SHEILA
You wouldn't understand. It's a Jersey thing. [walks away]
[The park, basketball court, day. The boys - Stan, Kenny and Cartman - are playing basketball. Kenny has the ball and is trying to get past Cartman]
CARTMAN
You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!
KYLE
[approaching] Hey, dudes.
CARTMAN
[takes the ball from Kenny and confronts Kyle] Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him.
KYLE
What are you talking about?
CARTMAN
Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!
KYLE
So what?
CARTMAN
So what?! That makes you from Jersey!
KYLE
No, it doesn't!
CARTMAN
[turns around] He's from Jersey, you guys. [inches away] Let's just get away from him.
KYLE
I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.
CARTMAN
Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three!
KYLE
What's strike three?!
[Cartman removes his hat from his head, revealing his large curly red hair]
CARTMAN
You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!
KYLE
Shut the fuck up! [grabs his hat back and puts it on, then looks at the other boys] What?
STAN
Did you know your mom was from Jersey?
KYLE
Why does it matter?!
STAN
No, uh, it just explains a lot.
CARTMAN
[moves Kyle aside] Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange!
KYLE
No, it isn't!
CARTMAN
Yes, it is. It's getting oranger.
STAN
Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is.
KENNY
(Yeah.)
CARTMAN
Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you. [walks away, then turns and glares at him] And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a lot more!
[The Broflovski house, night. Kyle is brushing his teeth when he looks at himself in the mirror and then checks out his hands and his face. He takes his toothbrush out of his mouth and drops it into the sink, then checks out his face again]
KYLE
No. [removes his hat] Couldn't be. [opens the top drawer of the vanity and pulls out a pair of scissors. He begins to cut his hair, slowly, then faster and faster. He gets some styling gel and rubs it into his hair. He gets a razor out to shape his eyebrows, cuts more of his hair off, rips the sleeves off his shirt, gets a bracelet and puts it on his right forearm, gets more gel and rubs a design onto his shirt, then is shocked at what he sees in the mirror] Oh my God!
SHEILA
[knocks on the bathroom door] Kyle? You in there?
KYLE
Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now. [goes about putting stuff away and closing all the drawers]
SHEILA
Kyle, open the door.
KYLE
Not now, Mom. Please.
SHEILA
Kyle, this instant! One, two. [Kyle goes to the door]
KYLE
All right, all right. [opens the door and see his mom, who's really Jerseyfied herself. He's speechless]
SHEILA
I guess we need to talk.
[Kyle's bedroom, minutes later. She and Kyle are sitting on his bed]
SHEILA
I know this has to be very upsetting for you, Kyle.
KYLE
[enunciating] What am I, Mom?
SHEILA
When I got pregnant with you, Kyle, your father and I were living with my parents in Newark. We knew we had to get out. Neither of us wanted our child to be from Jersey, so we moved. As far away as we could. But now I realize you can take the fetus out of Jersey, but you can't take Jersey out of the fetus.
KYLE
[getting scared] What are you saying?!
SHEILA
I'm saying that for the first two months I carried you in my stomach, I lived in Newark. Technically, you are from Jersey.
KYLE
[looks at his new look] No! I don't wanna look like this!
SHEILA
It isn't so bad, Kyle, a lot of people think the Jersey look is nice!
IKE
[walks by and looks] Aaaaiiiiihhhhh! [faints on his back]
KYLE
I can hide it! [hops off the bed] Nobody ever has to know! [puts his hat back on and walks out the bedroom door] I can't ever let anybody know!
[a news program comes on]
ANNOUNCER
Live from St. Louis, New Jersey! It's the "Jersey News" with anchormen P-Train and Tan Jovi!
P-TRAIN
What's up, New Jersey? It's the evenin' news. Our top story tonight: many Jersey people are freakin' pissed after a small town in Colorado got all aggro on some decent Jersey folk! For more on this story we go to Chicago.
REPORTER
People here in Chicago, New Jersey are riled up, P-Train. Apparently, a town called South Park, which is at the border of Denver, New Jersey, is discriminating against people from Jersey! They won't sell houses to people from Jersey, and they're making all the ones who moved in move out. [the Giudice family is forcibly hauled out of their new home and stuffed into their car] And they're takin' down all the Jersey-owned shops! [South Park Salon is bombed and everyone in there runs out] It's like these people got a beef with Jersey. What's up with that?!
TAN JOVI
What's up with that?!
P-TRAIN
What's up with that?!
TAN JOVI
Well, we are coming after you, South Park! We fight discrimination! It's a Jersey thing!
[South Park, night, town square. The townsfolk have brought everything they could think of to form a barricade against the Jersey folk. Randy is on the line]
RANDY
Please, Governor. You have to send your troops to join us in this fight. We're just a small town. We can't stop New Jersey on our own.
SCHWARZENEGGER
Ve are very sore-y, but Cal-i-for-ni-a cannot afford helping you at this time.
RANDY
Can't you see that if we fall to New Jersey, California is next?
SCHWARZENEGGER
No, because U-tah is between Colo-rah-do and Cal-i-for-ni-a.
RANDY
Oh. Fine! But when Utah gets taken over by New Jersey, who's next?!
SCHWARZENEGGER
Nevada.
RANDY
Oh, really? Well, okay, Mr. I'm-Awesome-at-Geography!
[South Park, night, town square. In the shadows, Kyle gives Kenny a rifle as Cartman walks up. Stan gives another rifle to Kyle]
CARTMAN
What the hell are you guys doing?!
STAN
Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.
CARTMAN
[points to Kyle] And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could easily be a spy!
KYLE
I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!
CARTMAN
Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?!
KYLE
That's enough!
CARTMAN
Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!
KYLE
[loses his temper via short temper] Aaaarrghhhhhh! [runs at Cartman and pins him hard against a tree] I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in! [lets go and walks away angrily. Cartman backs up a bit without saying a word, then breaks down wailing]
CARTMAN
[Whining] That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the treeee! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it! [Stan and Kenny walk away silently] Did you see the scratch, Keeenney?!
[South Park, night, town square. Randy is on the line looking for other support]
RANDY
Please, Emperor Akishino! We need Japan's help to fight these people! [waits for an answer] Fine! But you Japs will all be eatin' hoagies in a month! [throws his cell phone away and claps his hands free of it] That's it, nobody's gonna help us! We're on our own!
STUART
We can't take on all of Jersey. We have to find support.
RANDY
There is no support! Every ally America ever had is... [thinks of something] Wait a minute. [strokes his chin] Sometimes when a threat is great enough, you have to turn to your enemies for help.
MR. GARRISON
What are you talking about?
RANDY
We could ask Al Qaeda.
STEPHEN
[steps forward] Ask Al Qaeda for help? After what they did to us?!
RANDY
Maybe it's time we put our differences aside and forgive them.
STEPHEN
And what about the families of the victims of 9/11? Their feelings matter for another ten months, damn it!
BAR PATRON 1
Hey! Hey, we got a problem! You've gotta get some people down to the bar quick! There's trouble!
RANDY
People from Jersey?
BAR PATRON 1
I don't know what the hell I saw.
[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails, night. Officer Barbrady's cruiser is parked out front. Officer Barbrady and other men from the town search the bar in the darkness with flashlights]
BARTENDER
It tore a hole in my meat locker. Smashed the cigarette machine in half.
BARBRADY
Alright, come out now. Make it easy on yourself. [a soft, high growl is heard and a figure runs by in the shadows, bumping into a few tables. The figure runs by again, grunting. The flashlights follow the sound and find a woman who looks like a troll cowering in a corner. Her arms are really short, her ears are elfin, her skin is orange and her black hair is styled in a beehive hairdo]
BAR PATRON 2
It's one of them! That thing's from Jersey, too! [the thing moves closer to the ATM and smokes]
RANDY
What is it?
BAR PATRON 2
It's called a Snooki. It's very famous. [Snooki sips from her drink and eats straight out of a pickle jar]
RANDY
That thing is famous? Why?
BAR PATRON 2
I don't know!
JIMBO
Well, what are we waitin' for? Let's kill it! [aims his shotgun and fires at her. She drops the pickle jar and it shatters.]
SNOOKI
[walking away from the ATM] Snooo-ki.
RANDY
Don't let it get away! Where is it?! [hears a sound] Who was that?! [his beam lands on Snooki, who has taken Stephen Stotch down and is raping him]
STEPHEN
Aaagh! Get it off of me!
SNOOKI
[raping him] Snooki smoosh.
STEPHEN
Shoot it! [another gunshot is heard and Snooki heads for a window and jumps out through it, running away]
[South Park Square, night. Cartman has left his usual friends and is talking to a group of other boys from his class: Bradley, Jason, Butters, Fosse, DogPoo, and Bill]
CARTMAN
So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, "I'll smash your teeth in!" My head is all like gashed open.
BUTTERS
Kyle did that? Gee whiz.
CARTMAN
I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler. [Kyle is cleaning his rifle nearby and lifts his head to see what the other boys are doing] Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh? [Kyle returns to cleaning his rifle. Cartman then moves to the opposite side of the circle] He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now!
BUTTERS
Are you being serious?
CARTMAN
This is very serious, Butters.
BUTTERS
Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die.
CARTMAN
Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?! [Kyle looks up again. Cartman notices and turns to look back at him] Hey, Kyle. [stretches] Uhh... Dude, do you smell raspberries? I smell raspberries. Ho? Huh. [turns around and goes into a low voice as Kyle watches from nearby] We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up.
[Al Qaeda headquarters in the caves of Afghanistan. Al Qaeda members go about their business]
OPERATIVE
[walks up to bin Laden with a package] Istagia makuman? [bin Laden turns around and takes the package, which is a video tape. He puts it into a tape player and watches the video. Randy pops up onscreen]
RANDY
Hello, Mr. bin Laden. My name is Randy, and I'm a geologist in America. I know that America isn't your favorite place in the world, but gosh darn it, we need your help. As you may know, we are trying to stop our entire country from becoming New Jersey. I believe that if we do not succeed, Jersey will spread to Japan, Russia, and eventually, to you. I know you have seen countless horrors in your lifetime, Mr. bin Laden, and that you have witnesses the very worst of mankind. Well, now I ask you to watch this. [Jersey Shore's live-action show open begins to play]
SNOOKI
Neaaaaaah! Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
[Sizzler, night time. Cartman climbs into the restaurant through a window]
CARTMAN
Come on, you guys, hurry!
STAN
[climbs in behind him] Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler?
CARTMAN
I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!
KENNY
[climbs in behind Stan] (What kind of fuckin' miracle?!) [Kyle climbs in last]
CARTMAN
[leads them to a spot] Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool. [stops] It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out.
KYLE
[looks at Cartman for a few seconds] Why?
CARTMAN
Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!
KYLE
You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.
CARTMAN
Nuh-uh. Seriously, nuh-uh.
KYLE
I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!
CARTMAN
Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights! [the lights go on and the fourth graders Cartman was talking to earlier pop into view] Ha-ha! It's a trap, Kyle! Get him to the meat locker! [the group of six come up and take Kyle away]
STAN
Dude, what are you doing?
CARTMAN
[stops Stan and Kenny in their tracks] Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us. [rushes up to the freezer door] Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted.
KYLE
All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll... [his expression changes quickly] Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?
CARTMAN
Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!
KYLE
No, I- I'm serious. What is that behind you?
CARTMAN
You ginger Jersey Jew! [Snooki rises up behind him] Your tactics don't work on me!
SNOOKI
Snooki wants smoosh smoosh. [breathes heavily]
CARTMAN
[looks over his shoulder, then looks back at the other boys] Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me?
[South Park Square, night. Stephen runs up to Garrison behind the barricade]
STEPHEN
Garrison, I think the Jersey people are advancing. Where's Randy?
MR. GARRISON
He's still questioning that new prisoner.
[nearby, Randy has a Jersey man strapped onto a chair]
RANDY
Alright, Mr. Situation, we'll try this again! Why are you people doing this?!
THE SITUATION
Well, I told you, it's, uh, just a Jersey thing. [Randy punches him hard on the left cheek]
RANDY
What does that mean?!
THE SITUATION
You just don't understand. It's, uh, it's just... just a Jersey thing. [Randy punches him again, kicks him with the left foot, punches him with the left hand, kicks him on the side of his head with the right foot]
RANDY
Stop playing stupid!
JIMBO
Maybe he really is stupid, Randy.
RANDY
[shoots back at Jimbo] Nobody's this stupid! [turns to The Situation again] What are you people planning?!
THE SITUATION
It's just a Jersey thing, you know? You...you just gotta be from Jersey to get it. [Randy punches him again with the left hand, kicks him with the left foot, delivers a roundhouse kick with the right foot, flips over him and kicks him on the back of the head]
GERALD
[keeping a lookout atop the barricade] Here they come! [the adults get into position]
SHARON
Is it them, Randy?
RANDY
Yup. They're from Jersey alright.
JERSEY PEOPLE
Yeah! Woo-hoo! Let's go! Yeah!
JERSEY MAN 2
Let's go creepin' in this town!
JERSEY WOMAN
[to another woman] Don't you talk about my family! Don't you talk about my family!
RANDY
This is where we make our stand! South Park will never be West Jersey! [some people cheer]
RANDY
[waves a New Jersey flag but with the "New" crossed out and replaced with a big red "No"] Fuck New Jersey! [some people cheer and begin firing. The advancing Jersey folk begin to fall one by one] Keep shooting! We're sick of you, Jersey!
[Sizzler, night. Screams of children are now heard, and they are trying to hide from Snooki, who is now raping DogPoo]
DOGPOO
[Screaming] Ugh! Ugh! Get it off of me! Get it off of me!
SNOOKI
Snooki wants smoosh smoosh!
STAN
[tries to get out, but finds the doors locked] We gotta find a way past it!
CARTMAN
What does it want?!
BUTTERS
Sounds like it wants smoosh smoosh!
SNOOKI
[leaves DogPoo, reaches Cartman, and starts raping him from behind] Smoosh smoosh! Snooki wants smoosh smoosh!
CARTMAN
No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me!
STAN
Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?
KYLE
Oh, God. [grabs his head and stumbles away, then falls on all fours] Wuh. Aah. [waves his hand at Stan and Kenny] Get out of here!
STAN
[flatly] Why? [Kyle continues writhing and groaning, before throwing his hat away]
KYLE
Agggh! Agggh! [pulls out a tube of gel and puts some on his left hand] No! [quickly greases up his hair, takes off his jacket, rolls up his sleeves, puts on a necklace, combs his hair, puts two rings on his left hand, and writes "KYLeY-B" on his T-shirt]
STAN
..Dude.
KYLE
[approaches Snooki; in Jersey accent] Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!
SNOOKI
Snooki get the smoosh in the... the tenth...
KYLE
You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage! [Snooki babbles and says her name] You've got cabbage in your muff! [Snooki continues babbling] You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! [Snooki continues babbling and Kyle finally fells her with a left hook. Snooki whimpers and escapes through a window. Cartman sobs a bit and puts his pants up]
CARTMAN
[Sniffling] Thank you, Kyle.
[Back at the barricade, Jimbo searches for more ammunition]
JIMBO
That's the last of it! We're out of ammo!
RANDY
Then we've got to start falling back to Utah!
STUART
What's the point? Can't you see it's over? [the sound of roaring jets is heard and grows louder]
JIMBO
Who is that?! [thirteen planes appear over the horizon]
RANDY
It's Al Qaeda! [cheers go up from the crowd. An Al Qaeda pilot salutes from his cockpit. Soon they're diving their planes into the Jersey crowd and killing the Jersey folk] Give 'em hell, Al Qaeda! [More cheers go up from the crowd]
[Park County Community Center, day]
RANDY
On a cold October night, a small town in Colorado stood up to New Jersey and finally said, "Go away!" Our fortitude was the inspiration for others and now, New Jersey is slowly receding back to the desolate land from whence it came. Our country's getting back to normal, and we owe it all to Osama bin Laden. [bin Laden is shown seated on a chair. Cheers go up and Randy places a garland on him, and kisses him on the cheek]
STAN
Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal.
KYLE
Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel.
CARTMAN
Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster. [Pinches Kyle's cheek] But you're my little monster.
STAN
I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling "Muff cabbage," what's muff cabbage?
KYLE
It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing.
RANDY
On this day let us all remember that no people on this earth are really enemies, only folks with differences. [a paratrooper descends from the rafters and quickly kills bin Laden with one shot]
PARATROOPER
[to his pilot] Tango is down, tango is down.
RANDY
We got him!
End of It's a Jersey Thing
