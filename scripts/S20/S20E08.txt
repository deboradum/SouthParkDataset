[Tom's Rhinoplasty. A government agent speaks with Bannon.]
GOVERNMENT AGENT
The political world is watching, Bannon. [gives Bannon a file] We need to make sure the president elect has a smooth transition.
BANNON
All indications are that his transition [flips a page] is going to be fine.
SURGEON
[walks by] We're just doing some finishing touches, but everything went well. You can see him now if you like.
CAITLYN
I'll go.
[Caitlyn walks into a technologically advanced room where Garrison is seen having a blond, push-back wig put on his head by a mechanical arm.]
GARRISON
[talks with Caitlyn] Well, do I look presidential?
CAITLYN
Honestly, you look twenty years younger.
GARRISON
They really worked on my stank face. Look! Whenever I don't know what people are talking about, I just do this, [lowers his body] like look. [shows his stank face] I can do this. [shows his stank face again] This is, this is my stank face. [shows a different stank face] It's like, I'm not listening to you, see? [shows his other stank face] They did a really good job on my stank lips.
CAITLYN
It's an amazing transition.
GARRISON
Now I feel ready to take care of business and do what really matters... [sits up straight] in just a minute, I'm gonna do the UV rays a bit longer.
[[the machine closes enseals Garrison]]
[SpaceX. Cartman and Heidi walk to the desk.]
SECRETARY
Can I help you?
CARTMAN
Hello. I understand that you're trying to get to Mars. This is my girlfriend, Heidi. She's really smart and really funny.
SECRETARY
...Okay.
CARTMAN
We've given up social media and we'd like to be somewhere as far from the internet as possible. Is it true Mars would have really shitty Wi-Fi?
SECRETARY
...That'd be an understatement, yes.
CARTMAN
Well, we'd like to go. We can't tolerate this world anymore and we'd like to talk to whoever we can about getting to Mars as soon as possible please.
SECRETARY
Uh-huh. Take a number and join the others.
CARTMAN
What others?
[[Cartman, Heidi, and the secretary turn their heads see a bunch of other people waiting, including Cher singing]]
CHER
[garbled and auto-tuned] If I could turn back time...
CARTMAN
What the fuck, dude?!
SECRETARY
Lot of people want to leave the planet right now.
CARTMAN
Ah god dammit, is that Cher?!
CHER
[garbled and auto-tuned] Do you believe in leaving the world, oh...
[South Park Elementary, principal's office.]
PC PRINCIPAL
God [knocks down papers] dammit! [knocks down lamp] How the fuck did this happen?!
MACKEY
[knocks the door and opens it] Uh, sorry PC Principal, but someone wants to speak with you.
PC PRINCIPAL
I told you to leave me alone, Mackey! [slams fist on the desk] I'm not in the mood!
MACKEY
But, but sir, the president elect is here. [moves away from Garrison]
GARRISON
[enters the office with two Secret Service agents following him] So sorry for the intrusion. You're not too busy, I hope.
PC PRINCIPAL
Uh, not at all. Please uh, have a seat, Mr. Garrison.
GARRISON
Excuse me?
PC PRINCIPAL
Uh, please have a seat, Mr... President.
GARRISON
That's better, bitch. [sits down and takes out a piece of gum]
PC PRINCIPAL
Certainly want to uh, congratulate you on the election.
GARRISON
Do you remember the day you fired me, PC Principal?
PC PRINCIPAL
I know we've had some differences, uh...
GARRISON
I was upset because a bunch of immigrants were changing my class and I believe your response was that I needed to go and "learn their language", "be more open-minded".
PC PRINCIPAL
I'm sorry that your position here at the school was terminated.
GARRISON
Are you really? [makes stank face] Are you really sorry? [makes different stank face] Because you see PC Principal, you helped create me. You insisted that I was a bigot, that I was an intolerant relic left over from another time. But now, I'm your president. And if there's one thing I've learned about becoming president, it's that your penis can get really dry. When all the skin on your penis is drying out from working so hard to get elected there's only one thing that can fix it, isn't there? Saliva, from a good friend who once doubted you. I need you to fix my problem, PC Principal, so that we can be even-stevens. What do you say, bud?
PC PRINCIPAL
[is in complete shock]
[Outside of unknown club. Two people got out of the club. The berries head to a tiny door.]
UNKNOWN BERRIES
Oh, 'member when it fell in her drink. Yeah, I 'member.
MEMBERBERRY 1
'Member when Han shot Greedo?
MEMBERBERRY 2
Sure, I 'member Greedo.
TUBBS
Ha, I 'member Greedo.
MEMBERBERRY 3
'Member?
MEMBERBERRY 1
[knocks at the small door]
GUARD BERRY
[opens small window] What's the password, 'member?
MEMBERBERRY 3
Yeah, I 'member.
MEMBERBERRY 1
You 'member?
GUARD BERRY
I 'member. [opens the door, lets the berries in, and then closes the door immediately]
[Inside a Memberberry bar. Random berries keep on saying "'Member".]
MEMBERBERRY 1
Ha ha, 'member this place? [hops away]
MEMBERBERRY 2
Sure, I 'member. [rolls away]
MEMBERBERRY 4
[hops away] 'Member the Tantive IV?
MEMBERBERRY 1
Oh, I love that ship. [stops moving]
MEMBERBERRY 3
[goes with the other berries and talks to an old berry] Hi, it's us, 'member?!
DON
Ah sure, I 'member.
MEMBERBERRY 4
We did the thing with throwing Mickey in the drink, 'member?!
DON
Ah sure, I 'member; just 'cause of youse, we won the election.
TUBBS
Yeah yeah, 'member?
DON
Waiter, round of drinks for our heroes here, 'member?
WAITER BERRY
I 'member.
DON
You done good poisoning the lady's drink. Now our man is in office, 'member? But I still have things I need you to do.
TUBBS
Hehe, hehe, I 'member.
[TrollTrace Headquarters: vault. Gerald repeatedly knocks on the exit door with all his might.]
GERALD
Please, you have to let me outta here!
DICK
Skankhunt, stop!
BEDRAGER
[talks from above] Yes, please. You're making a very jackass of-a yourself.
GERALD
[walks to see Bedrager's face]
BEDRAGER
Well well, what do we have here? Looks like your little troll-party.
TROLL 4
You Danish pricks, you tricked us!
BEDRAGER
We didn't trick you, your own government did. They thought if they handed you over to us we would agree not to go forward with the TrollTrace program.
GERALD
You can't hold people prisoner! I haven't done anything! People are gonna be looking for me!
BEDRAGER
[takes out his phone] By all means, [tosses the phone to Gerald] contact whoever you want. Of course, you'll have to tell them why you're here.
DICK
What are you gonna do with us?
BEDRAGER
We're going to use you to set the world on fire. When the servers go online, there will be chaos, panic, and war. And from the ashes, a new world will rise: a world where everyone is happy, and singing, and has no secrets, [yells] like Denmark! [punches a railing]
DICK
You think you can turn countries in the world against each other? Our president will never let that happen.
[Unknown supermarket. Garrison and Secret Service agents enter the store.]
GARRISON
Hey everybody! [walks to a checkout line, takes a mic, and hums "Hail To The Chief"] Guess who's here? It's the President of the United Fucking States. [mic drop, then walks around the store] Oh, it's been a while since I've heard from you guys. Hi, Janice. [takes a small bottle of water from her shopping basket and opens it, tossing the cap away] Hello, Stephen.
STEPHEN
[looks away] Mr. President.
GARRISON
[walks around the store some more] I was just, you know, passing through the old neighborhood [checks out a tomato paste can from another shopper] thinking about what laws I might get rid of, when suddenly, out of nowhere, my penis got really dry. You know if they have anything at this store for a dry dick? Huh? No? You guys can't think of anything? Oh, I know. What about [points to] Eduardo Hernandez? I believe it was Eduardo who told me I couldn't double-bag my groceries, even though he's from fucking Guatemala. Well, what do you think now, Eduardo? You wanna double-bag somethin' else? [his phone rings, and he pulls out out of his back pocket to answer it] This is the President.
FIRST GENERAL
Sir, we need you at the Pentagon. It's a matter of national security.
GARRISON
Oh, really? I'm kinda busy right now, jeez.
FIRST GENERAL
Sir, the Danish have released a statement. I'm afraid... we may be going to war.
GARRISON
War?
[Ike's room, day. He's playing a first-person shooter game when a Skype call comes in.]
GERALD
Ike?! Ike, buddy, can you hear me?! I need you to do something, okay? Daddy needs your help! I need you to go to your browser and sign on to the school message board, okay? Can you do that for me? The school message board and then log in. Lowercase S, skank-hunt-4-2. You got it?
[The other trolls witness Gerald's actions.]
DICK
Wow.
ANONYMOUS821
Wow, what?
DICK
He's gonna have his son sign in and troll for him.
GERALD
[covers his phone and faces the other trolls] If Skankhunt is still out there trolling, then they have the wrong guy! Get it?! It's called "using your brain", fatso!
ANONYMOUS821
So they'll blame your kid?
GERALD
Nobody cares if a kid trolls! What are they gonna do, get a slap on the wrist?
DICK
[stands up] Didn't you hear what that guy said? They're gonna set countries against each other! We have way bigger problems!
GERALD
You don't know my fucking wife! [faces the phone] Ike, you got it? Great, pal! Okay, now I need you to go to the comment section, okay, and type in "You should all get raped by gorillas". You got that pal? Ike, "You should all get raped by gorillas"! Come on, we have a lot of work to do here!
[SpaceX. Heidi and Cartman sit next to each other on separate chairs.]
CARTMAN
Jesus, I didn't think getting to Mars would take this long.
HEIDI
You really think this is what we should do, babe? I gonna miss everyone.
CARTMAN
I know, but it'll be worth it, babe. We'll be left alone to make our new world better.
BUTTERS
Hey, Eric! [seen right near Cartman]
CARTMAN
[speaks to Butters] What the hell are you doing here?
BUTTERS
Well I want to get the fuck off this planet, but they told me I had to take a number.
CARTMAN
Oh no no no! You're a male chauvinist sexist pig, Butters. You don't get to go to Mars.
BUTTERS
[shows complete fear] No, you don't understand. I've seen the light, I'm a changed man, I thought boys were being treated unfairly, but now I know... shit's about to get a lot worse.
[Outside of the White House. Memberberries start incoherent 'membering.]
MEMBERBERRIES
'Member The Fugitive? '[Millions of Memberberries are 'membering.]' 'Member Aliens? '[They begin to jump the fence]' Here we are! Ah, yeah! I 'member. Come on, everybody, 'member? '[The large group of Memberberries continue 'membering.]' 'Member snow speeders? '[They approach the front door.]' Yeah, I 'member! 'Member not hearing? '[They breach the front door and pour into the main foyer.]' 'Member the invasion of Hoth? Haha! 'Member "you rebel scum"? I 'member! '[They fill the entire floor of the White House entrance.]' Oh, 'member the rebel transports? '[Thousands of Memberberries open the door to the Oval Office, and pour in.]'
MEMBERBERRY 1
"We did it!" 'Member? '[Five Memberberries take their place on the president's desk.]'
MEMBERBERRY 2
Sure, I 'member!
MEMBERBERRY 3
What do we do now?
MEMBERBERRY 4
Don't you 'member?
TUBBS
Ooh, I 'member.
[Ike's room. Ike sets up the profile photo of Mrs. Herrera and a penis in a small Photoshop tab while Gerald is on Skype.]
GERALD
Okay now make sure the little worm is in the woman's mouth, got it?
IKE
[puts penis in photoshopped mouth]
GERALD
Now I need you to type "You're a fat retard" in the comments.
IKE
[types in the comment section] "You're a retard."
GERALD
No, you have to say "a fat retard", Ike! It's a nuance, but it's very important!
IKE
[types in the comment section] "You are a fat retard."
SHEILA
[sees what Ike is doing and is in shock] Ike! What are you doing?!
IKE
What he says.
GERALD
[exits Skype chat]
SHEILA
[walks into Ike's room and gets a closer look] It was you, all this time! What have you done, Ike?! Do you have any idea the damage you've caused?! How could my child be such a monster?! [answers the call on her phone] Yes yes, hello?!
GERALD
[talks on his phone to Sheila] Hey sweetheart, how's everything going?
SHEILA
You have to come home from helping the government, Gerald! I just caught Ike trolling Mrs. Herrera!
GERALD
Are you serious?
SHEILA
Yes! The school troll is our son, Gerald! You should see all the things he's posted on his computer!
GERALD
God dang it! Let me talk to him right now!
SHELIA
[hands her phone to Ike]
IKE
Hello?
GERALD
Hey Ike, just stay calm and act like I'm yelling at you, okay pal? Okay, give it a few seconds, wait. Good. Okay, now--now say "I'm sorry, dad. I guess I'm just fucked up inside".
IKE
No!
GERALD
Ike, you have to listen to me. On your mother's life, this is a matter of national security! You have to say "I'm sorry, dad. I guess I'm just fucked up inside"!
IKE
[angrily] I'm sorry dad. I'm just fucked up inside.
GERALD
That was amazing, kiddo. It'll all be worth it, okay? I'll make this up to you. Give me back to your mom.
SHEILA
[takes her phone back] Gerald?!
GERALD
He's full of shit, he's not sorry! If he felt sorry, he wouldn't be able to do it in the first place!
SHEILA
I know!
GERALD
I'm gonna get home as soon as I can to deal with this, okay? We can deal with this together. Just don't say anything to anyone for now, all right?
SHEILA
Okay. Okay yeah, I love you too. I know. Bye. [ends the call and talks to Ike] You just sit in here until we figure out what to do; and if you get back on that computer, you are done, you got it?! [leaves Ike's room]
GERALD
[starts a Skype call on Ike's computer] Ike! Okay there's just a few more things I need you to do. I need you to type "How'd you like a donkey dick?".
[Pentagon. Garrison and four Secret Service agents walk to the general.]
FIRST GENERAL
[salutes] Welcome to the Pentagon, sir. I've been ordered to show you around. [turns around] This way, please.
GARRISON
[follows the general] So I can do whatever the fuck I want in here now, right?
FIRST GENERAL
Yes, sir. Here are all [gives Garrison a folder of classified information] our military secrets and all classified information.
GARRISON
[takes folder] Okay, good.
FIRST GENERAL
[stops everyone by the Drone Program entrance] This is the Drone Program. In there you can kill anyone on Earth remotely. Here's the keys. [gives keys to Garrison]
GARRISON
Thanks!
[[everyone continues walking]]
FIRST GENERAL
In here is satellite surveillance where you can monitor anyone's conversation live.
GARRISON
Oh that will come in handy.
FIRST GENERAL
Extreme interrogation [stops everyone] room in case you find interrogation necessary.
GARRISON
Oh hell yeah, it's necessary. Let's do it.
FIRST GENERAL
[gives Garrison a briefcase] And here of course is the famous "football", where you could order a nuclear attack in four minutes. [walks away]
GARRISON
Love me some football. [follows the general]
FIRST GENERAL
[stops everyone by the Diplomatic Strategy entrance] And finally, in here, is the diplomatic strategy and negotiating room. [opens the doors, having everyone enter the room]
[People in the room are noticing high alerts across the world.]
GARRISON
Well, jeez, this doesn't look very fun.
SECOND GENERAL
Thank God you're here sir. We need your guidance.
[SpaceX. Butters sits next to Cartman by his left side.]
BUTTERS
Loolooloo, I've got some apples. Loolooloo, you've got some too.
CARTMAN
Butter, Butters! You expect people to believe that you went from being the biggest asshole in the school to a softhearted feminist like me? Fat chance.
BUTTERS
No no, believe me. I'm a changed man. Girls are really smart, and they'll be running the country soon, and they deserve total respect.
CARTMAN
Yeah? You just forgot one thing, that women are funny too. That didn't occur to you, did it, Butters?
BUTTERS
Well I don't think there was ever any question women are funny. Remember that movie 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton?
HEIDI
Oh yeah, that movie was funny.
BUTTERS
Well I laughed my butt off and it never even occurred to me that they were women. I don't know why things changed. I don't know why people make such a big deal about women and comedy now. I mean what about Carol Burnett? She was great.
HEIDI
Wow, I guess you're right.
CARTMAN
Yeah, I mean, when women make vagina jokes I think it's the funniest thing ever!
BUTTERS
Yeah, well I swear I don't care how many times Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I laugh every time.
CARTMAN
[looks at Heidi, then at Butters, then in a low voice] Oh, I see what you're doing.
HEIDI
What, babe?
CARTMAN
Oh nothin', babe. I'm just... Do you think you could tell me some jokes?
HEIDI
[giggles] Why do you want me telling you jokes all the time?
CARTMAN
Because you're [glares at Butters] fucking hilarious.
HEIDI
Well, did I tell you the one about the skeleton and the skunk?
BUTTERS
[laughs] That's already funny! [Cartman gets frustrated and makes a fist with his left hand]
[The Pentagon]
SECOND GENERAL
All around the world, countries are mobilizing armies and preparing defensive countermeasures.
GARRISON
Why? What the hell happened?
FIRST GENERAL
This is everything you need to know about the TROLL TRACE program.
GARRISON
What's TROLL TRACE?
FIRST GENERAL
A plan by the Danish to release the full internet histories of everyone on Earth.
SECOND GENERAL
The previous administration tried to work with the Danish by handing over several trolls, but the plan didn't work.
FIRST GENERAL
The entire world has become very uncertain and unstable.
SECOND GENERAL
We think we should order all navy vessels to the Bering Sea.
GARRISON
For what?
FIRST GENERAL
Because when the Chinese are able to see all our e-mails and online activity, we believe they will most likely attack us. Also, there are ground troops mobilizing in Paris because the French believe when we see all their e-mails, we will most likely attack them.
THIRD GENERAL
Mr. President, sir! The Russians are asking what we intend to do about the Danish.
GARRISON
Well, why are you asking me?
SECOND GENERAL
Please, sir, we have very little time before this escalates beyond our control.
[The Kremlin, Russia, day. What follows is what's on the video, although the language is said to be Russian.]
AIDE 1
Президент Путин, Датское утверждает, что они всё ещё готовы включить программу Troll Trase.
PUTIN
Это всё, что я сказай, всё, что я сделай на Интернет будет доступно моей подруге?
AIDE 1
Да, кажется так.
PUTIN
Датское должно быть оставновлены! Мы нужно знать, как Соединённые Штаты стоят на этом! [behind him, the phone rings at his desk and a second aide pops in to answer it]
AIDE 2
Э... Господин президент, Овальный кабинет. [Putin walks to the phone]
PUTIN
Да, это президент Путин.
MEMBERBERRY 3
'Member the Death Star?
MEMBERBERRY 1
Ahahaha, 'member cutting open tauntauns?
MEMBERBERRY 4
Yeah, yeah, 'member the Force? [the berries chuckle]
PUTIN
Что это такое?
TUBBS
Heheh, heheh, yeah, sure, I 'member.
MEMBERBERRY 1
Member McGy-?
TUBBS
Sure, I 'member.
MEMBERBERRY 3
'Member?
MEMBERBERRY 2
Heheh, hey hey hey, 'member the Cold War?
MEMBERBERRY 1
Oh I loved the Cold War! That was fantastic!
[SpaceX, day. Everyone is still waiting for the ride to Mars.]
TOUR ASSISTANT
Okay, Numbers 204 through 215, you can come on through.
CARTMAN
[leaves with Heidi] Oh, finally.
BUTTERS
Hey, that's me too. Yippee!
TOUR ASSISTANT
Right in here, everyone. [The group, which includes Cher, walks in, and the door slams shut behind them]
ELON MUSK
Hello, everyone, and welcome to the tour. I'm Elon Musk. Are we gonna have some fun today?
CARTMAN
Oh great, a stupid tour guide. Can we just talk to someone important please? We want to go to Mars.
ELON MUSK
And getting anywhere takes ingenuity. Oh, Mrs. Door? Would you mind... opening, please?
PA DOOR VOICE
[interactive doors] Yes, Elon. [the doors rattle, but don't open. Elon turns and opens them manually. A chime plays as the doors open, and Elon leads the group onto the factory floor]
ELON MUSK
The only way for humankind to survive is with imagination and technology. Cars that run on electricity. Solar panels that replace roof shingles. Even food that changes form. You see this? It's a pizza, only four inches long. And yet, when heated, it expands to make enough pizza to feed a hundred people. I call it the pizza... pocket.
CARTMAN
[whispering to Heidi] They already have Pizza Pockets.
ELON MUSK
Who would like to see the Hyperloop? A new mode of travel that can take you from here to Dubai in nine minutes.
CARTMAN
Excuse me, Mr. Musk, this is all super interesting and shit, but can we see the Mars rocket now?
[Meanwhile, at the Pentagon...]
STAFFER 1
Sir, India is moving aircraft carriers into the Gulf of Mexico.
GARRISON
Well why would we care about Mexicans?!
STAFFER 2
[in winter fatigues] Sir, a message from Saudi Arabia. They say they pinky-promise not to look up our Internet history if we pinky-promise not to look up theirs.
GARRISON
Well what does that even mean?!
STAFFER 3
[in winter fatigues] Still waiting on if we should send troops into Japan, sir.
GARRISON
I don't know, jeez!
FIRST GENERAL
Sir, it's the UK Secretary of Foreign Affairs calling from London. He says they have advice for you.
GARRISON
What?
BORIS JOHNSON
Yes, hello? Things aren't looking good here. We just want to say, whatever you do, don't eat the membberries.
UK AIDE
[overhearing] Don't eat the membberries. They are bad.
GARRISON
Memberries?
BORIS JOHNSON
I'm afraid everyone here who ate the memberries wanted to go back in the past, you see. Hasn't worked out too well for us.
UK AIDE
We shouldn't have ate the memberries!
BORIS JOHNSON
The memberries cloud your judgement. They get inside your head, you see.
GARRISON
Get inside your head... Wait a minute... Nobody gets in my head, you limey bitch! Are you insulting me?! Stop wasting my time! 'Cause I'll have you here on a plane in five hours suckin' my dick!! [slams the phone down on the receiver]
UK AIDE
What'd he say?
BORIS JOHNSON
I believe they've eaten the memberries.
UK AIDE
Ooh, dear!
UK AIDE 2
Ooh, dear!
[SpaceX tour, day. The tour is winding down.]
ELON MUSK
Here you see our Falcon 9 full-thrust rockets. They are actually able to take off into space and land safely back on Earth for reuse. [the group moves back to the lobby] Well, I certainly wanna thank you all for joining our tour today. You've been a wonderful group. Give yourselves a round of applause.
GROUPS
Huh?
CARTMAN
Whoawhoawhoawhoa, what about going to Mars?
ELON MUSK
Mars? We're still about ten years away from going to Mars. Maybe eight.
GROUPS
Awwww.
CARTMAN
No, no nonono, we have to go now!
ELON MUSK
Well I'm sorry, but it's a bit more complicated than a pizza pocket. Going to Mars is gonna take a lot of very smart people working very hard for a very long time. Now, if you don't mind, I have hundreds of more tours to do. [turns to exit the lobby]
BUTTERS
Mr. Musk, wait! [Musk turns around] Maybe we can help you get to Mars sooner. I'm not sure if you know our friend, Heidi. She's really smart, and really funny. [Cartman flashes an angry face at Butters]
ELON MUSK
Like... how funny?
[The White House. Some member berries have formed a group and are performing "Africa". A vintage car horn is heard and the mob boss arrives with some henchmen. "Sing Sing Sing" blares from the radio.]
DON
Out of the way, 'member?
BERRY HENCHMEN
You'd better 'member if you know what's good for youse! [the car moves through the crowd, down the corridors and into the Oval Office]
MEMBERBERRIES
Hey look, it's them. 'Member? Sure, I 'member. [the mobster berries get out of the car]
DON
Ey, youse did good. Who's in charge, 'member?
MEMBERBERRY 3
We decided he's in charge.
MEMBERBERRY 1
No, we said I'm in charge, 'member?
MEMBERBERRY 4
No wait, I 'member. We all said he's in charge. [leans to the left]
MEMBERBERRY 2
Oh yeah, I 'member.
DON
Wrong. [shoots Member Berry 2 clear through. Member Berry 2 collapses and bleeds out green juice]
MEMBERBERRY 3
Waaah!
DON
'Member stormtroopers?
MEMBERBERRY 2
Sure, I 'member.
DON
Not those stormtroopers! The real old ones. People wanna 'member? They're gonna 'member.
[The Broflovski house. Kyle comes home from school and is about to go upstairs when he sees Ike in a corner, in time out. Ike has his head against the wall.]
KYLE
Ike? [Ike looks back at Kyle, then puts his head on the wall again] What are you doing?
SHEILA
Don't talk to him! He is in big trouble!
KYLE
Well what'd he do?
SHEILA
It's him, Kyle! Your brother is the internet troll who's caused all this pain in our community!
KYLE
What?
SHEILA
It was him all along. Now we have to figure out what to tell people when they learn this ugliness came from our family. [walks back into the kitchen]
KYLE
You made people quit Twitter? You started a war between boys and girls? You...?
[Kyle stops and thinks back to the clues he's heard in recent days.]
HEIDI
I call it "Emoji Analysis". It isn't a student, it's an adult.
SHEILA
This ugliness came from our family!
HEIDI
I think it's one of the parents.
GERALD
You're suppose to just laugh and make fun of shit.
IKE
Daddy called you a pussy.
KYLE
[stops thinking back] Oh my God. Oh my God! Ike, come on! [grabs Ike's hand and rushes out the front door with him. Sheila hears the front door open and looks around for her boys. She reaches the open front door]
SHEILA
Kyle? Ike?! Whatwhatwhaaat?! [her voice echoes around the neighborhood]
