Woodland Critter Christmas

[A panoramic view of South Park, day. Holiday music is heard in the background, and the scenes are played out as the narrator mentions them.]
NARRATOR
Way up in the mountains in a small little town,
The Main Street was being decorated all up and down.
People stood in long lines, sometimes waiting hours or more,
Because Christmas needs to be bought in a store.
But out in the forest, not too far away...
[A nearby forest. The camera pans down from the sky and rest upon a Christmas tree. Forest animals gather round and decorate it.]
NARRATOR
...The little woodland critters were also preparing for their Christmas Day.
WOODLAND CRITTERS
It's almost time when the time is here,
The time that's only once a year.
We can hardly wait, 'cause it's so near.
A Woodland Critter Christmas!
NARRATOR
The little critters worked hard as they happily sang,
And each one of them had a quite interesting name.
There was Squirrely the squirrel, Rabbity the rabbit,
Beavery the beaver, and Beary the bear.
Porcupiney the porcupine, Skunky the skunk,
Foxy the fox, and Deery the deer.
Woodpeckery the woodpecker, Mousey the mouse,
and Chickadee-y the chickadee, all made the forest their house.
And on that magical day, stumbling upon all of that,
was a surprised little boy, in a red poofball hat.
STAN
[walks by with a sled] What the hell?
SINGER
Christmastime is once a year
Every critter holds it dear
Every animal big or small
Christmas means so much to us all
[The forest. The critters approach Stan.]
RABBITY
Well, hello there. Welcome to our forest.
SKUNKY
How do you like our Christmas tree?
STAN
It's... nice.
BEAVERY
Why, it's the most perfect tree in the forest! [the others cheer]
MOUSEY
Oh no, I see a problem.
DEERY
What is it, Mousey?
MOUSEY
Our Christmas tree doesn't have a star!
CRITTERS
Awww.
BEARY
We can't have a tree with no star on it.
RABBITY
What are we gonna do?
SQUIRRELY
Now don't be down, y'all. Maybe our new friend can help us find a star.
CRITTERS
[among other things] Can you really? Oh would you please? Could you help us?
STAN
Okay, okay.
CRITTERS
[cheering] Yay!
NARRATOR
And so, using some paper and working with glee,
the boy in the red poofball hat made a star for the tree.
CRITTERS
Ohhhh!
BEARY
It's the nicest star I ever saw.
NARRATOR
The little critters cheered and Beavery said with a smile...
BEAVERY
How would you like to sing and dance with us for a while?
NARRATOR
The boy in the red poofball hat smiled and said...
STAN
[doesn't smile] Uh, no thanks, I'm gonna go home. [turns around, picks up the reins on his sled and walks off]
BEAVERY
Goo- goodbye Stanny!
CRITTERS
Goodbye, Stanny! Bye! Cya! I'll buy your hat!
STAN
Woof.
[Stan's bedroom, night. He's asleep in bed, but wakes up, turns over, and turns on his light.]
CRITTERS
Hi, Stanny!
STAN
Oh, whatta? [squeezes his eyelids shut]
NARRATOR
His friends were all there! What a wonderful surprise!
The little boy smiled with joy in his eyes!
STAN
[irritated, grabs his clock] What time is it?!
SQUIRRELY
You aren't gonna believe what happened, Stanny. It's the most magical Christmas gift ever!
SKUNKY
Porcupiney is pregnant!
STAN
[sighs] You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow.
MOUSEY
I deduce the man-boy doesn't understand the seriousness of the fertilization.
DEERY
Porcupiney is a virgin, Stanny. Her conception was immaculate.
FOXY
She's gonna give birth to our Lord and Savior.
STAN
...What?
PORCUPINEY
It has been foretold unto me that I would give birth on Christmas Day.
MOUSEY
So soon!
SKUNKY
How delightful!
WOODPECKERY
Our souls are saved!
CHICKADEE-Y
Finally the critters are gonna have a Savior of their very own, of their very own! [they all cheer]
SQUIRRELY
[hops onto Stan's bed] There's just one problem: We don't have a manger for our Savior to be born in.
CRITTERS
Awwww.
BEARY
But we got to have a manger.
RABBITY
Can you do it, Stan. Can you build us a manger? Huh?
CRITTERS
(Cheers)
NARRATOR
"Of course I'll build you a little manger!" the little boy cried,
and he winked at his critter friends and leapt to their side!
[The forest. Stan has built the manger and is hammering the last few nails in place.]
NARRATOR
And out in the woods the boy steamed right ahead,
making a place for the critter babe to lay its sweet head.
RABBITY
Gee whiz, if it isn't the nicest manger I ever saw.
MOUSEY
I deduce it shall serve as a perfectly suitable resting place, for the Son of our Lord.
RACCOONY
Does this mean we can go to sleep now?
PORCUPINEY
My son will have the nicest bed in all the forest.
WOODPECKERY
Fit for a king!
SQUIRRELY
This is going to be the best critter Christmas ever!
WOODLAND CRITTERS
It's almost time when the time is here,
The time that's only once a year.
We can hardly wait, 'cause it's so near --
STAN
[as they sing] All right, I'm going now. [He ambles off. A roar is heard nearby. All stop and look. The critters scream.]
CRITTERS
The mountain lion! Hide! [They scatter, leaving Stan to face the lion alone. The lion peers out from behind a tree.]
STAN
Go away! Shoo! [The lion moves off and the critters return.]
SQUIRRELY
Is it gone?
MOUSEY
I deduce it is.
SKUNKY
[behind a low tree] I'm not c-c-comin' out.
FOXY
Well, this is the end. The mountain lion obviously knows Porcupiney is pregnant, and he's gonna kill it again.
STAN
Again?
SQUIRRELY
Every Christmas the mountain lion comes down and eats the virgin critter impregnated with the Son of our Lord.
PORCUPINEY
Oh dear, I'm so very afraid.
BEAVERY
[climbs onto a stump and sits up] Let's face it. The mountain lion will never let our Savior be born.
CRITTERS
Awwww! [some of them sob]
SQUIRRELY
Hey, we shouldn't be upset this Christmas. We've got Stanny!
RACCOONY
Of course! Stanny can do anything! If he can build a manger, he can stop that mean ol' mountain lion!
PORCUPINEY
Christmas is saved! [the critters cheer]
[The camera looks up from the woods to a mountain in the distance. Dramatic music plays.]
NARRATOR
High up in the forest on a dark, craggy peak,
the horrid mountain lion and preyed on the weak.
For the critters to be saved, someone had to stop that nasty old cat...
STAN
Goddammit, this is fucking ridiculous!
NARRATOR
Said the little boy in the red poofball hat.
NARRATOR
Killing a mountain lion was no easy task,
But he thought of a plan, and he thought of it fast.
STAN
[gesturing] Grrr! Grrr! Come on out! [The lion is heard roaring from inside the cave, and it roars. It approaches the entrance.] Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr! [Anticipating the lion's leap, he runs off. The lion lunges at him, but misses. Stan moves to the side of the peak and turns, gesturing.] Rawrrrrr! [Stan runs up the side of the peak, and the lion follows. Stan reaches the peak and turns to face the lion. The lion lunges at Stan again. Stan drops out of the way and the lion goes over the peak and onto its death below, at the cave entrance.]
NARRATOR
In a flash, it was over! A victorious blow!
The mountain lion lay slain on the cold ground below.
[The cave entrance. Stan sees that the mountain lion is motionless and approaches.]
STAN
Okay, there. [three lion cubs approach the entrance]
LION CUB 1
Mommy? Mommy! [they rush up to her body] W... wake up, Mommy, wake up!
LION CUB 2
Don't leave us, Mommy. [Stan realizes that this dangerous mountain lion was a mom, so his jaw drops. The pale cub approaches him.] Man-boy, why? Why did you kill our mommy? Why?
STAN
[at a loss for words] I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior? [The cubs snuggle close to their mom's body, sobbing.]
NARRATOR
The tiny cubs all gathered together and cried,
All alone in the world because their mother had died.
STAN
[turns away and squeezes his eyes shut] Aw- awww!
[The forest floor, night. The critters have set up a campfire close to the manger and are keeping warm by it.]
PORCUPINEY
[feeling a kick] Oooo.
BEARY
You all right, Lady Porcupiney?
PORCUPINEY
Oh yes, just felt a little kick is all.
BEAVERY
Well, it's been much too long now. Uh I'm afraid our helpful friend Stanny must be very dead.
FOXY
Yep, the mountain lion probably swallowed him whole.
RABBITY
I guess that means our Savior is gonna be made into Savior stew.
CRITTERS
Awwww.
CHICKADEE-Y
[flitting straight up into the air] Wait a minute, look! [the animals turn to see Stan approaching them]
CRITTERS
Stanny! [they gather in front of him]
MOUSEY
Stanny, you're alive.
BEARY
But, does that mean you killed the mountain lion?
STAN
It's dead.
DEERY
For real and for true?
BEAVERY
Are you sure?
STAN
I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.
SQUIRRELY
He did it! Now our Critter Christmas can finally happen! Hail Satan!
CRITTERS
Hail Satan!
STAN
Wait, wha-what?
BEAVERY
You've done us a huge favor, Stanny! Without the mountain lion around, the Lady Porcupiney can give birth to the Antichrist!
CRITTERS
Yaaay!! [they head over to the manger]
STAN
Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior!
SQUIRRELY
Yeah, to the Son of our Lord, Satan, Prince of Darkness.
STAN
But I thought you meant the Son of God!
DEERY
Well, think about it: You really think God would have sex with a porcupine?
CHICKADEE-Y
No way! Only Satan, Prince of Darkness and King of all Evil would do that! Yay!
FOXY
This just calls for a celebration! Let's sacrifice Rabbity and eat his flesh!
RABBITY
Yay! Sacrifice me to the Devil!
[The other critters cheer. Stan is frozen stunned as Beary pulls up a Satanic altar on a small wagon with a little help from Squirrely. The other animals bring Rabbity up to the altar. Rabbity is propped up on the altar and Beary tears him apart with a sacrificial blade. The other animals crowd in, tear away pieces of the body, and eat them raw.]
CHICKADEE-Y
Drink his blood! Drink his blood!
SQUIRRELY
[jumps into a puddle of blood] Blood orgy!
CRITTERS
Yay, blood orgy! Blood orgy, yay!
[The critters drench themselves in Rabbity's blood and begin the orgy. Beavery mounts Raccoony, Skunky mounts Porcupiney, Mousey mounts foxy, and Beary mounts Deery. Squirrely hops onto Deery's left ear and mounts that. Chickadee-y and Woodpeckery start flitting around. In the background is heard "Sting, so true!" Stan stares, traumatized.]
CRITTERS
What special time and special day,
It's Woodland Critter Christmas.
SQUIRRELY
[a circular window opens and he pops up] Hail Satan.
[The forest floor, night. The critters return to the manger and decorate it with Satanic symbols, including (what is presumably) Rabbity's skull. As the narrator speaks, the following takes place. The star atop the manger is turned so it points down. Owls bring flowers to the mountain lion's corpse. The lion cubs are shown, then the mountain peak, then Stan is shown with his head buried into his arms at his desk in his room.]
NARRATOR
In the gentle forest clearing on Christmas Eve morn,
The little forest critters prepared for the Antichrist to be born.
The noble mountain lion had stopped evil in all the years past,
But now the good protector lay dead as the good owls amassed.
And meanwhile, three lion cubs were crying away.
For them, there would certainly be no Christmas Day.
And soon the forest would suffer from the offspring Satan begat.
All of this because of the little boy in the red poofball hat.
STAN
Ugh.
NARRATOR
Now that he'd killed the noble lion queen,
there was nobody to stop the Apocalypse, it seemed.
STAN
Uuugh!
NARRATOR
"I know!" he said with a new happy grin,
"I'll go back to the forest and speak with those critters again!"
STAN
[waves the narrator away and leaves his desk] No, no-no-no.
NARRATOR
He ran out the living room, turned out the light,
and went back to the forest to set everything right!
[Stan enters the living room, hops on the sofa, and turns on the TV. "The Jeffersons" theme song is heard.]
And went back to the forest to set everything right!
[Stan ignores the narrator and continues to watch the TV.]
He tried to forget all about it by watching TV,
But his conscience caught up with him and to the forest he did flee...
[He turns the volume up to drown out the narrator, but to no avail.]
He thought he could hide from his problems - not true!
[Stan rolls his eyes]
He knew in his heart the thing he had to do!
STAN
Leave me alone!!
NARRATOR
He knew that only by going to the forest could he --
STAN
All right, all right, all right! God! [He turns off the TV, hops off the sofa and walks out the door, leaving the remote control on the floor.]
[The manger at the forest clearing, day. The animals continue decorating.]
BEAVERY
[looks around] Hey, look everyone! It's our old pal, Stanny. [the other critters turn and look]
WOODPECKERY
Oh boy, Stanny. You came just in time!
DEERY
Yeah. We've got a big problem.
SQUIRRELY
The Great Satan has commanded that when the Antichrist is born, we must find a human host body to transfer it into.
CHICKADEE-Y
That way he could take over the whole world! The whole world!
MOUSEY
The human must be non-baptized and heathenistic against Christ.
BEAVERY
We figured you'd be perfect!
CRITTERS
Yay!
STAN
I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian!
CRITTERS
Awwwww.
BEARY
But we got to have a human host body for the Antichrist.
DEERY
Oh dear, maybe we won't have a critter C-Christmas after all.
SQUIRRELY
Now don't be down, y'all. Stanny can help us find non-baptized heathen human.
CHICKADEE-Y
Will you really, Stanny?
STAN
No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist! [walks off] I came here to put a stop to all this!
BEAVERY
To stop us?
BEARY
But gee whiz, Stan, if you try to stop us, we'd have to use our evil Satanic powers on ya.
STAN
Right, whatever. [turns around] I'm taking down the manger I built. [Beary's eyes turn red and brighten. A wall of hellfire appears before Stan.] Ah! [The wall gets higher.] Aaaah! [All the critters' eyes are flashing a bright red. Black crows swoop down and attack Stan.] Aagh! Aaaahh! [A two-headed demon dog appears snarling at him; he runs off in terror.] AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH! [The critters' eyes revert back to normal.]
BEARY
Oh boy! Our Satanic powers sure did the trick!
CHICKADEE-Y
Our powers get stronger every day! Get stronger every day!
SQUIRRELY
Sorry Stanny, but you see, nothing can stop the birth of the Antichrist, except for a mountain lion.
SKUNKY
And you got rid of her.
CRITTERS
Yay!
NARRATOR
The boy shook with anger! He broke a sweat and fell ill.
Then he remembered there were three mountain cubs still alive on the hill!
STAN
Oh yeah.
[The mountain peak, day. Stan climbs up to the cave again.]
STAN
Hello? Anybody in there? [the three cubs appear at the entrance of the cave]
LION CUB 3
Oh no, it's the man-boy who killed Mommy!
LION CUB 1
He's come to kill us now!
LION CUB 2
It's okay. I died inside when Mommy was killed anyways.
LION CUB 3
Yeah, better this than the slow death we'd face without a mother around.
STAN
Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil.
LION CUB 1
You got tricked by a squirrel? Gee, you're not too smart, are you, mister?
STAN
I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion!
LION CUB 3
Yeah, and you killed her.
STAN
Well, you're mountain lions.
LION CUB 2
Us? No, we're just kids. We still have our baby teeth.
LION CUB 1
And our baby claws.
LION CUB 3
And a dead mom.
STAN
There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby.
LION CUB 3
What? You mean like in an abortion?
LION CUB 2
Yeah. An abortion. That can work.
LION CUB 1
But, we don't know how to give abortions.
LION CUB 3
Do you know some place we can learn, mister?
NARRATOR
"Where can they learn that?" the boy said with a frown.
"I know! The abortion clinic just outside of town."
STAN
[cross] What?!
NARRATOR
So he picked up the cubs and down the mountain he stormed.
And took them to where abortions are performed.
STAN
No, he didn't.
NARRATOR
Yes, he did.
STAN
No, he didn't!
NARRATOR
Yes, he did.
STAN
No, he didn't!
NARRATOR
Yes... he... [Next scene has Stan holding the cubs at the abortion clinic as the doctor there prepares to abort a baby.] did!
STAN
Oh, Goddammit! [the doctor and patient are startled]
NARRATOR
Said the boy in the red poofball hat! "We've made it already, little cubs! Fancy that!"
DOCTOR
[walks over] Excuse me, what are you doing here?!
NARRATOR
The abortion doctor inquired.
DOCTOR
If you wanna be in the OR, a pass is required!
STAN
I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous.
DOCTOR
Well, you're in luck, I'm happy to inform!
It's only three days until Christmas, so I have lots of abortions to perform!
Gather around my table, cute little lions,
I'll teach you to do abortions without even tryin'!
NARRATOR
And so the little boy and the cubs gathered around the chair base,
And all day watched abortion after abortion take place.
[Montage. The doctor puts on his gloves and the cubs peer into the patient's vagina. Stan peers in as well, from a distance. The doctor works away happily and cleans up well. The patient leaves, and the next one is worked on. Lion cub 2 is on a desk next to a bottled fetus. He hops off, knocking the bottle off as well. The bottle pops open and the fetus falls out. Everyone turns and sees the fetus on the floor, and laugh about it. The doctor works on the next patient and Lion cub 3 brings him some forceps. The doctor smiles and strokes the cub's head. The other two cubs snuggle up to the patient on her shoulders, and she smiles at them.]
SINGER
Christmas time is once a year.
Every critter holds it dear.
Every animal big or small,
Christmas means so much to us all.
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!
And it happens once a year.
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!
When we hear about how Christmas only comes
Once a year.
STAN
This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point.
[The forest floor. The critters walk along singing their Christmas tune.]
CRITTERS
It's almost time when the time is here,
The time that's only once a year.
BEARY
Oh look. That little feller is all alone.
SKUNKY
Gee, he looks sad. [Kyle is seen kneeling next to his sled, looking sad.]
CRITTERS
Hi there!
KYLE
[gets up and turns around] What the hell?
BEAVERY
How come you're all alone on Christmas Eve.
KYLE
My... family doesn't celebrate Christmas.
RACCOONY
Aww, but why?
KYLE
Well, because, we don't really... believe in Jesus.
CRITTERS
[cheering] Yay!
BEARY
But does that mean you aren't baptized?
KYLE
No. I'm Jewish.
CRITTERS
[exulting] Yay! Yay! [they gather around Kyle]
BEAVERY
You've got to come with us!
DEERY
You're perfect! Just pu-perfect!
KYLE
Huh?
CRITTERS
[taking him away] Yay! Woohoo! Woohoohoo!
CRITTERS
What special time and special day,
It's Woodland Critter Christmas.
SQUIRRELY
[a circular window opens and he pops up] Hail Satan.
[The woods, night. The camera pans along to reveal a glowing red pentacle in the starry sky.]
NARRATOR
'Twas the night before Christmas, and above the woods, way up high,
a new bright shiny star hung in the sky.
For the world to be saved there was only one shot,
A little boy with three cubs and an abortion plot.
STAN
Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born?
LION CUB 3
Sure. We know how to give abortions now.
NARRATOR
He arrived at the critter forest ready to fight,
but then gasped when he saw a most dreadful sight.
[The critters are standing around the manger. A grotesque creature lies in the cradle.]
BEAVERY
Gosh, we did it!
SQUIRRELY
The critter Antichrist is born, bringin' a thousand years of darkness to the forest. [The Antichrist growls and throws little fits.]
NARRATOR
The Antichrist had been born, sealing the world's fate.
The boy in the red poofball hat... was too late.
STAN
Too late?! The hell is that?!
BEAVERY
Oh. Hiya, Stanny!
KYLE
[now tied to the altar, frightened] Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?!
STAN
It's Critter Christmas, dude! It sucks ass!
SKUNKY
Now all we have to do is put the Antichrist into our human host.
CRITTERS
Let's go! All right! Woohoo!
STAN
[turns to the lion cubs] That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?! [Skunky, Squirrely, Beary, and Chickadee-y walk over to get Kyle. Santa's sleigh appears in the sky.]
NARRATOR
When up in the sky the sound of sleigh bells were heard,
And a jolly red sleigh flew down to the earth like a bird!
BEAVERY
Wow, look, there's Santy Claus!
CRITTERS
[cheering] Yay!
RACCOONY
Let's eat his flesh! [the sleigh lands and rolls to a stop]
SANTA
[hops out] All right, what the hell is going on?! Why is there a red star glowing in the sky?!
RACCOONY
We finally did it, Santa! We brought forth the Antichrist with help from our good friend, Stanny.
SKUNKY
Death and pain await all living things.
SANTA
Little boy, you should be ashamed!
STAN
I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them!
SANTA
Well good going, stupid! There's only one way to stop devil-worshiping critters! [He reaches back and whips out a long shotgun. He fires, and the top half of Beavery's head is gone.]
CRITTERS
Aaaaah! [They scatter. Santa fires again, and Deery goes down. Two more shots and the tops of Raccoony's and Skunky's heads come off.]
STAN
Dude, what the- ? [Squirrely activates his demon power with the red glow from his eyes and a wall of hellfire appears before Santa.]
SINGERS
Hold steady, Santa.
[Santa simply hops over it, gets into position, and fires at Squirrely, blowing him to smithereens.]
STAN
[goes to untie Kyle from the altar] Come on, dude. [Santa continues firing at the remaining critters. Porcupiney is blown apart, then Foxy.]
BEARY
Gee whiz, Santa, you're not gonna kill me, are you- [His head is blown off and he goes down.]
LION CUB
But Santa, what do we do about the Antichrist? [Stan and Kyle join Santa and the cubs.]
SANTA
Don't worry, boys. The Antichrist cannot survive without a human host body to go into.
KYLE
[looks down] No. [walks towards the manger] No, I want to have the Antichrist inside me!
STAN
What?! Kyle?!
KYLE
[now in the manger, behind the trough] With his power, I can finally make the earth a better place for the Jews!
SANTA
Don't do it, Kyle! [Grinning evilly, Kyle holds the little Antichrist in his left hand. A glow emanates from the Antichrist and its spirit floats out of its body and into Kyle's chest.]
STAN
Dude!
KYLE
[returns to the altar, climbs up, and exults] Yes, yes! Now the Jews shall take control of Christmas once and for all! HAHA! HAAA!!
KYLE
[voice-over] Oh, stop it, Cartman! [the spell is broken]
[Mr. Garrison's class, day. All the students are seated, and it turns out they're taking turns telling Christmas stories. Cartman is telling his now.]
KYLE
Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story!
CARTMAN
I don't believe anyone interrupted you when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle. [behind him on the board is written "Write Your Own Christmas Story Day"]
KYLE
This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!
CARTMAN
Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?
MR. GARRISON
Sorry, Eric, but if Kyle feels discriminated against, you'll have to stop or else I'll get a call from his mother.
CARTMAN
[closes his booklet] All right, fine! Forget it! [He drops off the stool and heads for his desk.]
BUTTERS
Well but, but what happened?
TOLKIEN
Yeah. Did Kyle bring a thousand years of darkness or not?
CLYDE
What happens to the lion cubs?
CARTMAN
Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends.
STAN
No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner.
KYLE
Dude, why do you care?!
STAN
Well, after all that, I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth.
KYLE
Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved!
CARTMAN
That's not at all what happens.
BUTTERS
Aw well, come on. Let him read us the end.
CLYDE
Yeah yeah, come on! [the other kids chime in]
KYLE
All right, fine!
CARTMAN
[He returns to the stool and resumes the story. He clears his throat.] "Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?" said the little boy in the red poofball hat.
[The spell is restored. Kyle is back on the altar exulting.]
KYLE
HAHAHAA! Now I shall rule the -- [feels something...] Aww. Uuugh. God it burns! AAAH! My soul is on fire! Whoa! Oh, I don't like this! [hops off the altar] I didn't know it would feel so... dark and evil!
STAN
Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil.
KYLE
Oh God, what have I done?! [sits down] I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist.
SANTA
[with his shotgun at the ready] I'm sorry, but it's too late, Kyle! Santa's gonna have to kill you! [pumps the shotgun]
STAN
No Santa, don't!
SANTA
We don't have a choice. In a few hours, the dark creature inside him will consume his soul.
NARRATOR
The little boy fretted. He almost started to bawl,
But that's when he came up with the best idea of all.
STAN
The lion cubs!
NARRATOR
The little boy quickly begun,
STAN
I took them to see how abortions are done.
SANTA
What?
STAN
Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast!
Get the Antichrist out of my friend Kyle's ass!
NARRATOR
And in the twinkling starlight, each little cub did their portion.
They remembered all they had learned and gave Kyle an abortion.
[The lion cub 3 is deep in Kyle's ass, retrieving the Antichrist with his teeth. He succeeds and takes it to Santa quickly. Santa takes it and sets it down on a tree stump. Santa grabs a large sledgehammer next to the stump, raises it over his head, and bring it down upon the Antichrist, smashing it to bits with a loud THUD.]
KYLE
Thanks, everybody. I'm sorry I got a little crazy there.
SANTA
Well little boy, it seems that you [points to Stan] have really been through a lot. Is there any special present you would like this year?
STAN
[smiles] Yeah. Yeah, there is.
[The lions' cave. Santa arrives at the corpse of the mountain lioness and moves his hand over it, releasing some magic dust and watching it settle. The lioness stirs.]
MOTHER LION
Wha -- Oh my, what happened?
ONE OF THE CUBS

And back home, there were presents, and lots of food to get fat.
And it was the best Christmas ever for the boy in the red poofball hat.

SINGERS
[as credits roll]
Christmastime is once a year,
Every creature holds it dear,
Every animal big or small,
Christmas means the world to us all,
It's once a year, it's Christmastime,
When we hear about how Christmas only comes
Once a year.
End of Woodland Critter Christmas
