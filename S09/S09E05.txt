I see a ladybug- Hello lady ladybug. [Stan simple stretches out his left arm and catches the ball, then pitches it to Alan. Alan swings and misses]
UMPIRE
Strike.
MR. VARCAS
That was no strike! What the hell is wrong with you, ref?
RANDY
Good call, ref! Good call!
MR. VARCAS
Come on, Allen! This pitcher throws like a girl!
RANDY
What'd you say?!
MR. VARCAS
You heard me, asshole!
RANDY
You want me to kick your ass right here?! [Mr. Barkas stands and looks at him]
SHARON
Randy, sit down.
MR. VARCAS
You want a piece of me?! 'Cause I'm pretty sick of your Goddamned mouth!
RANDY
[takes off his shirt and throws it aside and challengers] Whattaya wanna do, huh? Whattaya wanna do?
SHARON
Randy, don't!
MR. VARCAS
You'd better shut up, asshole!
RANDY
I'm standin' right here! How do you wanna handle it?
MR. VARCAS
I told you to SHUT UP! [throws his beer at Randy. Randy takes his beer and throws it at Mr. Barkas. They start fighting back and forth. Stan looks on from the pitcher's mound]
STAN
[turns away and hides his face in his right hand] Aw Jesus, not again.
KYLE
Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season! [Stan puts on his game face and throws the pitch. Alan swings and misses]
UMPIRE
Strike three! You're out!
STAN
Yes! It's over! It's over!
LOCAL ANNOUNCER 1
That's it. South Park wins the game 4 to 0.
CARTMAN
[runs to the mound] We're done! No more baseball!
KYLE
No more boring baseball until next year!
STAN
We can start having fun again! [falls to the ground and rolls around]
CARTMAN
All right, we did it! [the rest of the team shows up and celebrates]
STAN
We did it! We did it!
STEPHEN
[as the coach, arrives] Yeah, we did it, boys! We did it! We're going to the finals! Woohoo! [the boys stop cheering and look at him]
STAN
... What?
STEPHEN
Well we won! That means we've got the best record in the division! [the parents rush onto the field]
GERALD
Congratulations, boys! You're goin' on to the post-season. Woohoo!
CARTMAN
Post-season?
KYLE
Nobody said anything about a post-season.
TOM
[Craig's Dad] There's more little-league baseball for South Park! Yehheah! [the adults begin celebrating while the kids are dumb-struck]
STAN
No... NOOO!!
[Outside, after the game. Randy is hauled off to a waiting Conifer patrol car, drunk and tattered. His pants are down to his ankles]
RANDY
This is for what?! Arresting me for what?! I'm not allowed to stand up for myself?! I thought this was America! Huh?! Isn't this America?! I'm sorry, I thought this was America! [he's put into the back seat]
[Whistlin' Willy's, night. The boys are gathered there for a pizza dinner]
KYLE
I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing.
CARTMAN
Nobody told us if we win too many games we'd go on to the finals!
STAN
Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad.
CRAIG
Not all that bad? How could you say that?! You hate this game more than any of us!
STAN
I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over.
BUTTERS
Well yeah, but... we usually win.
CRAIG
All the other teams are worse than us.
JIMMY
Yeah. Let's face it, we're winners.
STAN
I know we can lose if we try.
KYLE
You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport.
BUTTERS
Yeah. My dad always said "It's Okay to lose, but if you don't try, wuh you're grounded, Mister."
THE OTHER BOYS
Yeah, uh huh.
STAN
Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team quietly that we're gonna let them win, and then we'll act like we're trying. Our parents will never know.
BUTTERS
We'd better hope they never know, or else there's gonna be heck to pay. Heck, I tell ya!
[At the entrance of Whistlin' Willy's, the adults are gathered, relaxing]
GERALD
Boy, that was great, wasn't it?!
ROGER
Yeah, our boys really stuck it to 'em! [the doors open and Randy walks in]
RANDY
Heeey!
MEN
Heeey!
STEPHEN
You're out. [hands Randy a beer]
GERALD
How much was bail this time? [hands Randy a beer]
STAN
Hundred bucks, no big whoop.
RICHARD
Boy, you really beat the crap out of that Conifer dad.
RANDY
Well somebody had to put that knucklehead in his place.
STEPHEN
Yeah, well, you'd better watch yourself in the playoffs.
RANDY
Wha-what do you mean?
STEPHEN
I mean, you always get in a fight with scrappy redneck dats up here in the mountains, but some of those Division Two dads are tough!
GERALD
Yeah, those dads get REALLY drunk and obnoxious.
RANDY
I can fight anybody. I just need to train. I just need to get in the best shape of my life.
[The master bedroom at the Marsh house. The alarm clock clicks 7:30 and the radio comes on]
DJ
...the Beatles in the White Album in Helter Skelter. Okay- [Randy clicks the radio off]
[Randy rises from the bed and sits up, leaves the bed and shrugs, and wipes his nose a bit. He enters the kitchen, gets a glass, then goes to the refrigerator. He gets three eggs, cracks them open on the rim of the glass, and pours them into the glass. He picks up the glass and moves off a bit, then pours the eggs into a hot pan and scrambles them. He then picks up a beer, drinks, burps, and farts]
[Fort Collins baseball field, night]
FC ANNOUNCER
We want to welcome all South Park parents to Fort Collins, and the Little League Division One Playoffs. [applause all around as the teams meet on the field]

[Outside the restaurant, day. Randy stands by the curb looking into space. He has a black eye. The doors open and Stan walks out]

STAN
[sighs] Goddamnit. [goes back into the restaurant]
RANDY
I've worked hard, believed in myself, and now I'm gonna be fighting in a State Championship game. [smiles] This is gonna be the biggest fight of my life.
[South Park News]
ANNOUNCER
This is News 4, at noon.
[Coors Field, in Denver]
ANCHOR TOM
The Colorado Little League State Championship is being played this week. Two teams of youngsters get to go head to head at the major-league stadium downtown.
REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing here with the little sluggers and some of their parents, and I can't tell you how excited they are.
STAN
I don't suppose you guys want to win this game.
DENVER PLAYER
Win? Why the hell would we want to win?
DENVER PLAYER 2
Yeah. Then we'd have to play this boring game all summer.
REPORTER
[draws closer to the teams] Little Stan Marsh is the pitcher for the South Park Little League team, and Stan, how does it feel to be playing for the State Championship?
STAN
Gay.
REPORTER
Mr. Marsh, you must be very proud of your son.
RANDY
They've worked really hard to get here, Chris, and, you know, I don't like to really "trash-talk," but, I don't think Denver has a chance.
REPORTER CHRIS
Oho, well, I'm sure some of the Denver kids' parents would disagree with you and your team-
BAT DAD
[blue headdress and cape, pops in] Oh yeah! Oh yeah! [leaps closer to the camera] South Park is goin' down! Feel it comin'! [humps back to Randy] You ain't got a chance, South Park! Here we go, Denver, here we go! Huh, huh!
SHEILA
Who's that?
A WOMAN
That's Tom Nelson, one of the Denver players' fathers. He goes to every game in that ridiculous outfit and usually drinks too much and gets into a fight.
TOM NELSON
There ain't no way some little mountain kids can beat Denver. Not with my son on second base!
REPORTER CHRIS
Oho, looks like we got some parental trash talking going on here. Mr. Marsh, any comments?
RANDY
Well I think that there's a uh...
TOM NELSON
Mr. Marsh? Who wants to hear from a Mr. Marsh?! Iii am the ultimate Little League trash-talking father! Iii am the Bat Dad!
DENVER COP
[one of two come to take him away] All right, Mr. Nelson, let's go, come on.
TOM NELSON
Bat Dad knows no fear! Bat Dad knows no pain! I want you, Marsh! I want you!!
REPORTER CHRIS
Well, tension is certainly high here, but I guess everything will be decided on the playing field.
RANDY
[realizing he could end up like that] Oh my God.
DENVER PLAYER 3
Good luck! You're gonna need it.
DENVER PLAYER 4
Yeah, you can't lose to us. We're terrible. [the Denver team leaves, as do all the adults]
KYLE
Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game.
CARTMAN
Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team.
CLYDE
Like that motorcycle kid in Bad News Bears.
CARTMAN
Exactly right, Clyde. So what we need... is to find somebody to join our team, who totally sucks ass.
STAN
Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win.
CRAIG
But who?
KYLE
I know who.
[The airport, day]
ANNOUNCER
Announcing the arrival of flight six seven three, from New York City. [among the people leaving the airport is Kyle's cousin, Kyle]
KYLE SCHWARTZ
I'm baaack!
KYLE
There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play. [the team goes up to greet him]
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Hello, cousin Kyle. Oh Jesus, that flight was terrible. They served a chicken dish with hot sauce and it gave me gas.
KYLE
Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team.
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Well, you said you needed my help to win the big game, so here I am. I'll need a wipe cloth if I'm gonna play, though. Sometimes I sweat from holding the bat for so long and then the heat steams up my glasses.
CRAIG
He's perfect.
STAN
Yeah, with him on our team, we don't stand a chance.
[Coors Field. No one is in there except Randy, who walks along the stands looking around. He sees a sign that sais "Colorado Little League State Championship." He moves along. Next, he's at a beach far from Colorado looking at the sunset. He sneaks back into his bedroom as Sharon sleeps, closes the door softly, and sits on the side of the bed.]
RANDY
[softly] ...I'm not gonna go. [Sharon's eyes opem, and she rises a bit]
SHARON
What?
RANDY
Stan's little league game, I'm... I'm not gonna go.
SHARON
Why?
RANDY
I just... don't think I can, all right?
SHARON
You don't think you can?! This is the biggest game of your son's life! Why wouldn't you go and support him? What-? [Randy rises and faces her]
RANDY
Because I'm scared, all right?! [Sharon stays quiet] You wanna break me down?! You wanna hear me say it?! I'm scared! I don't know if I believe in myself anymore. [turns away and bows his head] I don't know if I can take this guy, Sharon.
SHARON
So then, don't. You don't have to get in fights with other parents at Little League games! Just sit there and watch!
RANDY
Look, I get what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to realize that I have to fight him because it's who I am.
SHARON
No, I'm telling you you don't have to get thrown out of games and make an ass of yourself.
RANDY
I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, Sharon. But you have to take Stan to his Little League game alone. [walks off]
[Coors Field, day]
ANNOUNCER
Welcome to the Colorado Little League State Championship Game! [the crowd cheers] This must be pretty exciting for these youngsters. A chance to go to the national circuit. [the teams meet at the pitcher's mound]
DENVER PITCHER
You know what these guys look like to me? A bunch of winners!
DENVER CATCHER
Yeah! We're about to get our asses kicked!
CARTMAN
I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game!
DENVER PITCHER
You're the best!
KYLE
You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title!
DENVER PITCHER
Not a chance, 'cause we're gonna lose to you right now!
BAT DAD
Here we go, Denver! These South Park kids got nothin' on you! Let's go, Denver!
WOMAN
Chris, will you sit down?
ANNOUNCER
[in the Press Box] First up to bat for South Park, Kyle Schwartz. [Kyle 1 comes up to bat]
KYLE SCHWARTZ
[stands on home plate] Where do I stand?
UMPIRE
R-right over here. [Kyle 1 looks, then goes to one side of the plate with his back to the pitcher. The umpire positions him properly]
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Don't throw the ball too fast, because I might get startled and I have asthma. [The pitcher throws the ball. Kyle 1 pulls his bat back]
UMPIRE
Strike 1!
SP TEAM
Yeah! All right!
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Jesus, not so close! That was three feet from hitting me in the head!
SECOND BASEMAN
He's not gonna swing! Throw balls!
KYLE SCHWARTZ
[swings and misses] Oh Jesus!
UMPIRE
Strike 2!
SP TEAM
Yeah!
STAN
Wow, he IS great at sucking.
CARTMAN
[happily] We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose!
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Don't throw it so hard or so close next time! Is it cold out here? I think I need a jacket. [The pitcher squints and focuses on the bat, which says "Barry Bonds" on it. The pitcher throws the ball and hits the bat, which falls out of Kyle Schwartz's hands]
UMPIRE
It's a bunt!
ROGER
Run kid, run!
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Oh Jesus! [runs towards first base]
KYLE
Aw crap! [Stan drops. Kyle 1 goes towards second and no one is stopping him. He passes it]
KYLE SCHWARTZ
[out of breath] I can't, I can't keep running like this! I have corns in my feet!
STEPHEN
Keep running, kid! [one of the SP players has his face buried in his right hand]
BAT DAD
Throw the ball to third, you idiots! He's runnin' home! [Kyle 1 heads towards home and passes that]
UMPIRE
Safe! [the crowd cheers and the scoreboard displays him and "HOMERUN!!!!" underneath. Smaller screens on the board display fireworks]
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Oh Jesus, did you see that? I hit a homerun! High-five, everybody! [nobody high-fives him]
KYLE
Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat.
STAN
Dude, we had it all wrong. While we spent all our time trying to make our team suck, these guys practiced and got really good at sucking. [next pitch: the ball hits the bat again, and the SP runner has to go to first, as it's a bunt. Tolkien goes up. The pitch hits the bat at the top - another bunt]
TOLKIEN
No!
MR. WILLIAMS
Yeeaahh! Go Tolkien go!
[Denver is up to bat]
BAT DAD
All right, Denver! You're up to bat now! [Butters is waving his hand for some reason, and the Danver batter squints and focuses on Butters' glove. Stan pitches, the batter hits, and Butters catches the ball. He's dismayed to find it in his glove.]
UMPIRE
Out!
DENVER TEAM
Yaaay!
KYLE
Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out! [the scoreboard is updated in time-lapse: Denver doesn't have a run on there.] Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long.
BUTTERS
[frustrated, takes his cap off and throws it on the ground] Son of a biscuit!
[Coors field, later]
ANNOUNCER
It's the bottom of the last inning here at Coors Field; the score is South Park 23, Denver 0. [a tired Stan pitches right down the middle and the Denver player doesn't move]
UMPIRE
Strike 1!
BAT DAD
Come on, Denver! Get the lead out! Do not cross the Bat Daaad!
GERALD
Geez I really wish this guy would shut up.
BAT DAD
Why don't you just go home, South Park? You can't beat Denver!
A VOICE
Denver sucks ass! [Bat Dad looks over. Randy has arrived with a tray of five beers. He's ready to rumble. He sits three rows behind Bat Dad, next to Sharon] Come on, South Park! These kids can't play! In fact, these kids are terrible! [Stan pitches, the batter swings after Cartman catches the ball]
UMPIRE
Strike 2!
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Oh Jesus, we're gonna win! I I never won a sport before; this is so exciting.
RANDY
It's over, Denver! South Park whupped your ass!
BAT DAD
You'd better shut your mouth before I shut it for you!
RANDY
[stands up, takes off his shirt, and challenges] What do you wanna do, huh? [Bat Dad climbs over the seats and he and Randy begin to fight, taking it to the aisle]
STAN
[sees, turns away and hides his face in his right hand] This can't get any worse. [the two men continue fighting at the bottom of the level and towards the foul pole. Bat Dad picks Randy up and throws him over the railing. Randy bounces off a bench, breaking it in two.]
BAT DAD
[stands on the railing and spreads his cape wide open] Now for the finishing move! You're about to be Bat-Dadded! [jumps off, but misses Randy entirely. They end up in the bullpen.]
COMMENTATOR
It all comes down to this! South Park is just one pitch away from being State Champions. [Bat Dad delivers blow after blow and has Randy on the run] Oh geez, it looks like two parents are fighting. They'd better be careful. The Little League has a no-tolerance policy.
UMPIRE
[comes out of home plate towards the men] Stop! Stop, or you're gonna get your teams disqualified!
STAN
[comes off the mound and stands next to Kyle] Disqualified? [looks at Kyle for a few seconds] Fight! Keep fighting! [the fighting continues, and two more umpires enter the picture]
UMPIRE 2
Break it up! Break it up! [the fighting continues. Bat Dad delivers a blow, shown in slow motion. It connects, and Randy falls backwards to the ground] That's enough! The next person that fights is getting his team disqualified!
BAT DAD
He's done for anyway. [walks off. Randy rises, slowly]
STAN
Come on, Dad! Get up!
KYLE
Get up! You have to fight! [Randy is trying]
UMPIRE 2
All right, come on! Let's play ball!
SP TEAM
Randy! Randy! Randy!
MICKEY
Get up, Randy! Get up, ya bum!
SHARON
Get up, Randy! Fight! Fight for me!
CROWD
Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!
RANDY
[now standing] Hey Bat Dad! [Bat Dad turns around] I didn't hear no bell.
SP TEAM
Yeah! [Randy goes on the attack, delivering blow after blow. The umpire and guard return]
UMPIRE 2
Stop, stop right now! [Randy continues the assault] I'm warning you, sir! [Randy begins singing in falsetto, then knocks Bat Dad to the ground with one final blow.] That's it! That's it! South Park is disqualified!
SP TEAM
Yeah!
SP ADULTS
Aww!
COMMENTATOR
South Park has been disqualified from the game! Denver wins! [The South Park team goes over to Randy, take off their hats, and celebrate their defeat. The Denver players are dismayed at this turn of events and throw down their caps. Two Denver officers come in to get Randy]
KYLE SCHWARTZ
We... We lost?
RANDY
[now arrested and turned around] What? I thought this was a free country! [now being escorted out of the Field]
STAN
Dad! [the guards let go and Randy turns around] You're the greatest. [Randy leaps for joy!]
