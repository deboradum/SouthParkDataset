Sons A Witches

[South Park, evening. Gerald drives his car down a street with two other men, Stuart and Roger, all dressed as witches. The song playing is Bow Wow Wow's "I Want Candy." The men bop along with it and eventually smile.]
STUART
What time are the other guys gettin' there?
ROGER
Everyone just said sundown, which should be soon.
GERALD
I want candy.
THE THREE MEN
I want candy.
[The Valmer house, moments later. Gerald pulls up to the house and honks a few times. Ryan peeks out, then comes out in his witch costume and a bag, and enters the car.]
GERALD
Lookin' good, Ryan.
RYAN
Yeah, I got a real cape this year. Check it out. [holds it up for the others to check out, and Gerald pulls away]
[The Marsh house, moments later. Randy is dressed, just tying his right boot up.]
RANDY
Hey Sharon, did you see the box of Jack Daniels?
SHARON
Oh no, you're not doing this again.
RANDY
What do you mean? Of course I am.
SHARON
Stan wanted us to take him to the pumpkin patch.
RANDY
Sharon, you know the week leading up to Halloween is always my Witch Party Week with the guys.
SHARON
Yeah, and you guys get wasted.
RANDY
We have some drinks. Come on, all the other guys' wives aren't being bitchy about it.
[The street, moments later. Gerald pulls up to Randy's house and honks. Randy comes out with a case of Jack Daniels and heads for the car.]
RANDY
Sup, witches! [gets into the car]
GERALD
Alright, Randy's got the JD!
RANDY
Yep. Who's got the other stuff.
STUART
Kevin said he's bringing it. [Randy chuckles, then the other men join in]
[Heidi's room, evening. Cartman is there, waiting on her.]
CARTMAN
[Impatient, yet quiet] Come on, come on... [normal voice] Sweetheart, can we get going, please?
HEIDI
[from her closet] Hang on, babe. Just a couple more things. [tosses out random pieces of clothing]
CARTMAN
Honey, the pumpkin patch opened like an hour ago and 'member how I was saying I want to get there early?
HEIDI
[dressed in a black spider suit and orange skirt with bats on it] What do you think?
CARTMAN
[urgently] Great, perfect. Let's go to the pumpkin patch.
HEIDI
Yup! Almost ready. [gets up on her chair and pulls out two items from her dresser]
CARTMAN
Wha-what?
HEIDI
Okay, spider or the bat?
CARTMAN
[getting exasperated] The spider's great.
HEIDI
Really? 'Cause I think I like the bat.
CARTMAN
[quietly, from the other side of her bed] Why does she do this every time?
HEIDI
What, babe?
CARTMAN
[urgently] I said it's time. Boy, look at the time.
HEIDI
'Kay, all set.
CARTMAN
[leaves the bedroom] 'Kay, here we go, going to the pumpkin patch.
HEIDI
[leaves the bedroom] Okay! Oh! I forgot my glitter lip gloss! [heads for the bathroom]
CARTMAN
You don't need glitter lip gloss!
HEIDI
[stops short of the bathroom, turns around and walks back] Eric, are you upset? Do you need to talk about something?
CARTMAN
No! No, we don't need to talk! Ah, I'm super happy!
HEIDI
Oh, okay. [heads back to the bathroom, and Cartman is dejected. Heidi looks back for a second] Hang on, I gotta pee. [closes the bathroom door]
CARTMAN
Cool, you got to pee again. Awesome.
[The woods, night. At a parking lot, several cars are parked next to each other. As Gerald pulls into a parking space, two other men get out of their own car.]
STEPHEN
Almost thought you guys were gonna bail on us.
RANDY
[chuckling] Yeah, right. We're gonna miss the first night of the party.
GERALD
Sup, Stephen, Chip.
CHIP
Just ready to party farty, witches. [holds up two six-packs of Samuel Adams beer]
RANDY
Well, I got the Jack.
THOMAS
[steps out of his truck with Steve] And I got the crack.
RANDY
Oh yeah! Jack and Crack Witch Week! Let's do this!
GERALD
Everybody up the hill! [the men proceed up the hill, singing Wang Chung's "Everybody Have Fun Tonight"]
THE MEN
Everybody have fun tonight
Jack and Crack Witch Week tonight
Everybod-
[The Turner house, evening. Heidi's parents have been chatting with Liane as they wait for the kids to come down the stairs.]
MR. TURNER
Thanks for taking the kids out tonight, Ms. Cartman. Heidi's been looking forward to it.
LIANE
Oh yes, my little Eric just loves the pumpkin patch. It's one of his favorite events of the year.
CARTMAN
Okay, come on, let's go.
LIANE
All right, you kids all ready?
CARTMAN
[directing his comments at Heidi upstairs] Yup. All set to go to the pumpkin patch! It's been open for over an hour now! [Heidi finally comes down the stairs]
NANCY TURNER
Ohoh, don't you look cute, Heidi.
CARTMAN
[goes to the front door and opens it] Awesome. Here we go, heading out now!
HEIDI
Hold on, Eric. I want a picture.
CARTMAN
No! Pumpkin patch is gonna, eh-
HEIDI
Will you take a picture, dad?
CARTMAN
See, all the best pumpkins get taken and then eh-
MR. TURNER
Cheese.
CARTMAN
Okay, come on! Here we go, going out the door! Go, Mom!
HEIDI
Bye Daddy! Love you!
CARTMAN
[at the car door] 'Kay, here we go to the pumpkin patch!
HEIDI
Oh crap. Hang on! I forgot my bracelet!
CARTMAN
[in the car] Oh my fucking God!
LIANE
Eric, potty mouth.
CARTMAN
Arrrrrrrrgh!
[The woods, night. Stephen starts a campfire. Randy serves up the Jack Daniels, then takes a drink and sighs. The other men drink their cups too. The men then share a crack pipe, and then they form a circle around the campfire and slowly go around it.]
THE MEN
Put a spell on our bosses. Put a spell on our wives. A hex on the Patriots. Let's fuck up their lives!
RANDY
And screw the Raiders too!
THE MEN
Yeah! [some time passes and they're getting wasted]
RANDY
No way. Check out Stephen, you guys.
STEPHEN
[walks around as if riding a broom] Heeheeheehee. Happy Witch Week! [falls to the ground face first] Ow. [the other men laugh at him.]
CHIP
[walks in with a book] Hey, HEY! [the partying stops] You guys wanna see some real witchcraft? [no one replies for a few seconds]
RANDY
Oooooooooooooo. [the men laugh]
CHIP
I mean it! I got this spell book last month. Got it in Salem, Massachusetts. They say it's real.
RANDY
Like real, how?
CHIP
Like from the Devil himself. You guys wanna try it?
THE MEN
Yeah.
[Dr. Spooky's Pumpkin Patch, night. People are leaving with pumpkins as Cartman and Heidi arrive. Cartman jumps out of the car and runs towards the patch.]
HEIDI
Hey, wait up, babe! [Cartman stops, closes his eyes, and stretches out his hand for Heidi to take when she catches up to him]
BUTTERS
[walks by with his pumpkin and his mom] Hey, where you been, Eric?
SCOTT
Oh boy! What a great time that was.
TICKET-TAKER
Thanks for coming, kids. [sees Cartman and Heidi approaching] Oh, you just getting here?
CARTMAN
Yeah, we are just getting here.
TICKET-TAKER
Okay uh, go on in, I suppose. Petting zoo's closed, and I think they stopped the churro machine.
CARTMAN
The petting zoo's cl- The petting zoo's closed?
TICKET-TAKER
Yeah. You can still maybe do the bouncy house.
HEIDI
Come on, babe!
[The woods, later. Chip is reading from the spell book.]
CHIP
Arkna. Peduum. Uthnod boral.
RANDY
That's pretty cool. [strikes up a crack pipe]
CHIP
Uthnod boral! Uthnod alvernderaal! Wickus! [a green glow emanates from the book] Stayfalls-wuh. Uh.
RANDY
Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa whoa.
CHIP
Ach. Oh, it burns!
STEPHEN
Okay, Chip. You might need to ease up on that crack there, buddy. [Chip drops the book and screams, and begins to transform into an actual witch. A broom flies to him and he rides off on it, cackling]
[South Park, night, seconds later. Chip flies over the town and past South Park Elementary, where the parent/teacher conference is being held.]
CHIP
I'll kill you all! Kill you all!
[Park County Community Center, moments later. Chip flies up cackling and begins lobbing flaming jack-o-lanterns at the adults there. One of them crashes into the parking lot and throws off a few people with its impact. Another one hits a car, stopping it in its tracks and wrecking it. The passengers get knocked out from the impact. Everyone else tries to disperse, screaming.]
CHIP
[cackling] You'll all be dead by Halloween! [cackles some more]
[Dr. Spooky's Pumpkin Patch. Everyone is running out.]
TICKET-TAKER
Get out! Everyone out!
CARTMAN
What do you mean?! I just got here!
TICKET-TAKER
There's a witch! [Chip flies in and starts bombing the patch]
HEIDI
Come on, Eric!
CARTMAN
No! I missed it! I missed it all! [Heidi pulls him away. Chip sees a boy, plucks him off the ground and carries him away]
[The Marsh house, next day. Randy comes down the stairs quite beat from the might before, goes to the fridge, gets out a gallon of fruit punch, and drinks straight from it, sighing with satisfaction. He turns and notices Sharon with her arms crossed.]
RANDY
Oh. Hey, didn't see you there.
SHARON
Did you hear anything about what happened last night?
RANDY
Uuuhhh, nnno, what happened?
SHARON
Your buddy, Chip Duncan? [holds up her phone, on which there's a news report about it] Apparently, he flew around on a broom, blew things up, and kidnapped some children?
RANDY
Are you serious?!
SHARON
You heard nothing about this?! He flew away vowing we'd all be dead by Halloween!
RANDY
[hands her back the phone and walks off] God, I knew that guy was a fuckin' chode!
SHARON
Randy, what did you guys do at that party?
RANDY
[turns around] Nothin'. We were just hangin' out and talkin' and stuff, and then Chip got all weird.
SHARON
People were hurt!
RANDY
Yeah, I agree! It's awful! We're not like Chip, okay?! He's a bad witch!
[South Park Elememntary cafeteria, lunchtime. The kids are nervous, looking over their shoulders. The core group of boys is at table eating lunch.]
KYLE
Did any of you guys actually see the witch?
JIMMY
Yeah, it was terrifying. She had a broom and a cackle and everything.
TOLKIEN
What are we gonna do, guys?
BUTTERS
Our parents are never gonna let us trick or treat with a flying witch around! [next to him, Cartman has an angry glare on his face]
KYLE
They say she blew up the pumpkin patch. Did any of you guys see that?
STAN
No, I missed the whole thing. I always try to get to the pumpkin patch really early.
BUTTERS
Yeah, I got there really early too. You get the best pumpkins that way. Anyways, I guess the witch destroyed the whole thing. [the camera begins to focus on Cartman's glare]
STAN
We've got to take matters into our own hands. None of us is safe.
BUTTERS
Yeah, but what are we gonna do?
KYLE
No, we've got to just hope the police will handle it.
STAN
Yeah, right. Like they'll handle anything. [from a nearby table, Heidi peeks past Bebe and smiles at Cartman, waving at him]
TOLKIEN
Stan's right. This might fall on us. [Cartman waves back, his glare fixed on her]
BUTTERS
Yeah, we've got to save Halloween. Don't you think so, Eric?
CARTMAN
[his concentration is broken] What?
BUTTERS
We've got to do something to get rid of her!
CARTMAN
Yes. You're right, guys. It's my only way out.
[The Marsh house, day. Sharon is watching TV on the sofa. Randy, in costume, walks past her with another case of Jack Daniels.]
RANDY
All right, see you, Sharon. Have a good night.
SHARON
[displeased] Where do you think you're going?
RANDY
What do you mean? It's Day 2 of Witch Week with the guys.
SHARON
[stands up] You can't possibly be considering doing this again!
RANDY
Why not?
SHARON
Randy, a real witch is flying around in the skies snatching children! I don't think this is the best time for you to be wearing a witch costume and partying!
RANDY
Wugh! Gau! Just because of one bad witch we're supposed to stop a tradition that goes back twenty-someodd years?! Jesus! [turns around and walks out the front door]
[Gerald's car. Randy walks to it and enters. The mood is subdued due to the flying witch.]
GERALD
Hey Randy.
RANDY
Sup guys?
RYAN
You know, just getting a bunch of shit for being witches.
RANDY
I know, right? It's like, there's one awful witch who wants to kill everybody, so now they're coming after all of us. This is like a witch... thingy.
STUART
It's like a witch pursuit thingy.
RANDY
A witch uhhh-
GERALD
It's a witch chase and shoot 'em up.
RANDY
Yeah, that's what it is!
[The woods, second night. The cars pull into the same lot as before, but now a sign is shown: Sentinel Hill park, which is closed. The men get out of their cars and walk up to another sign posted on an orange barricade.]
RYAN
Hey, what the hell is this?
RANDY
[reading the sign] "Park closed until further notice". That's bullshit!
STUART
Oh my God.
RANDY
They can't do this! The whole town really is on a witch pursuit thing!
[South Park, night. Chip is back in the air bombing houses, and people run to get out of the way. Chip spots Leroy and scoops him up.]
[Kyle's room, night. he's on his computer reading a Wikipedia article on witches. Stan, Kenny, and Butters stand behind him looking at the screen.]
KYLE
Check this out, you guys. It says that to destroy a witch you need bent pits, nine in all, each bent into an L shape.
STAN
What are bent pits? [Cartman walks in with some plans]
CARTMAN
Hey guys, I think I got it figured out.
STAN
You do?
BUTTERS
I knew Eric would come up with a plan! [Cartman puts up a drawing of his plan, which involves the boys luring Heidi to her death, burying the body, and celebrating her death with a pizza. He then brings out his retractable pointer and starts pointing]
CARTMAN
Okay, first of all, we need a scary place to lure her into. What is the creepiest place in town? Ross Dress for Less, that's right. Stan and Kyle will wait inside the Ross Dress for Less, and I will bring Heidi there. Once inside, Kenny and Butters will set off a series of explosions that will-
STAN
Wait wait wait wait. What the fuck are you talking about?
CARTMAN
This is how we're going to get rid of Heidi.
KYLE
Nobody's talking about getting rid of Heidi!
CARTMAN
You guys said you would help me get rid of her!
KYLE
OF THE WITCH!
CARTMAN
Who cares about a witch?! My life is a living hell, you guys!
KYLE
Then break up with her! You clearly can't stand her! LET THE POOR GIRL GO!
CARTMAN
I've tried! It's impossible!
KYLE
Heidi is a nice girl! How could you be so awful to her?!
CARTMAN
You don't understand! She has no time-management skills whatsoever! You don't know 'cause you've never had a girlfriend, Kyle! [Kyle just stares angrily at him] Fine. Just leave me to suffer. Next time you want me to kill someone for you, just forget about it! [leaves the room]
[South Park Elementary, day. The Mayor is speaking to the students and their parents in the gym.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Students and parents, I know that you are all concerned about the witch who is preying upon our town, and I wanna speak to you all about how to try and protect yourselves. But first, some gentlemen have asked to speak on what they perceive to be a [does air quotes] "witch pursuit thing". [walks off the stage as the gentlemen in costume get on stage and arrange themselves around the mic]
RICHARD
Oh wait, I'm supposed to be-
RANDY
Yeah, sure, no. [to Stuart] You go over there.
STUART
Right. Right right right. [music starts and they begin singing]
THE MEN
We're all on the same side, you and I.
Let's all stick togetha, let's try.
When things are going bad and there's people you need to confront.
Just be sure it doesn't turn into a witch pursuit thing.
STEPHEN
[as the other men provide ambient harmony] Hey guys, there's good witches and there's bad witches, and we stand with you in saying this particular witch needs to be brought down. But that doesn't men we should all be closing parks and stopping all witch activity because [catches up with the others on vocals]
THE MEN
Let's not turn this into a witch pursuit thing.
KYLE
[to Gerald] Dad, get out of here! We're trying to deal with an actual witch! Nobody's coming after you!
GERALD
Yes they are, boys! And next they'll be coming after you! 'Cause you're all little sons a witches!
RYAN
Right. You don't have to worry about us, going around snatching children. Only the other witch does that. [Cartman's face lights up and he looks at Heidi. He gets a mischievous look in his eyes]
[Later, school hallway. Heidi is at her locker.]
CARTMAN
Hey, babe.
HEIDI
Oh. Hey Eric.
CARTMAN
Listen uh, there's a big fun costume party tonight and I was thinking you and me should go. What do you say?
HEIDI
A costume party? With everything that's going on?
CARTMAN
Yeah, I just think, you know, we need to let off some steam and have a little Halloween fun, you know? I already have our costumes picked out.
HEIDI
Well... I guess.
CARTMAN
Cool. I'll pick you up at 5.
HEIDI
Well, maybe make it 4:30 if you're bringing the costumes. [Cartman turns left and walks away] I might need a little extra time getting ready.
CARTMAN
[stops, then mischievously] Ohohoh, I'm counting on it. [walks off]
[The Marsh house, day. One of the good witches rings the doorbell, and Randy lets him in.]
STEPHEN
Randy, can I talk to you?
RANDY
Sure, Stephen.
STEPHEN
I've been doing a lot of thinking, Randy. About the past. About what we've done. I think it's time we come clean and tell everyone about the crack. And the spells against our wives.
RANDY
[quickly closes the door and walks up to Stephen] Okay, look. You're freaked out, it's understandable.
STEPHEN
I have to admit what I've done wrong, Randy! I feel like everything's crashing down and I want Linda to hear it from me first.
RANDY
Okay, we smoked a little crack. We put harmless spells on our wives. We were just messing around, it was harmless fun.
STEPHEN
Was it? Or did we close our eyes to what Chip Duncan was becoming?
RANDY
Stephen, you can't turn on your own kind. That's what these witch pursuit thingies do, okay? They make everyone go crazy.
STEPHEN
I'm sorry, Randy. I have to clear my conscience.
RANDY
[sighs] All right, Stephen. At least give us till tomorrow morning to talk to our wives and prepare them, all right? Can you just give us till morning?
STEPHEN
Yeah, sure. [walks to the front door] I'm sorry.
RANDY
It's okay. It's okay. [Stephen leaves. A few second later, Randy is on the phone calling up someone] Hey, it's Randy. We’ve got until tomorrow morning to sacrifice Stephen to the Devil. I'll explain later, just get everyone together. And, maybe bring just a little bit of crack.
[The woods, night. Cartman and Heidi, dressed as Hansel and Gretel, wander through it.]
HEIDI
Don't you think we should stay on the main roads, Eric? This seems like a bad place to be right now.
CARTMAN
Don't worry, Heidi. This is the fastest way to the party. [loudly] I'm sure the witch won't even notice us.
HEIDI
Eric, come on, this is a bad idea. Let's turn around.
CARTMAN
Well, Heidi, if we'd been on time, we wouldn't need to take a short cut. But I wanted to give you your space to get ready.
HEIDI
[sensing the sarcasm] Is that what this is about? You're still mad about the pumpkin patch, aren't you?
CARTMAN
Why would I be mad? You wanted to make sure you looked right, and then you had to eat and use the bathroom 40 times. I can't blame you for missing the pumpkin patch.
HEIDI
I didn't use the bathroom 40 times! [Chip is heard above them] What was that? [the leaves in the trees rustle and she looks up] Eric! Did you hear that?! [she turns to see him, but he's gone] Eric?! Eric! Oh my God! Eric, are you okay?!
CHIP
[finally appears] Well, well. What have we here?
CARTMAN
[barely above a whisper, hiding behind a fallen tree trunk] Sweet. Come on, come on.
[Kyle's house, day. Stan, Kenny, and Butters show up, and Stan knocks on the door. Kyle answers the door.]
STAN
Dude, is your dad home?
KYLE
No, I, I don't know where he is.
STAN
We can't find our dads either.
BUTTERS
Yeah, and it turns out our dads and the bad witch were all part of the same witch group.
STAN
We asked our moms, and they said this has been going on for years. We've got to find them before something stupider happens.
KYLE
How are we gonna do that?
STAN
There's another guy. Someone else who was in the witches' club that hasn't been around for a while.
KYLE
Who?
[The White House, night. The President, also dressed as a witch, is in the Oval Office.]
PRESIDENT'S AIDE
[opens the door and looks in] Mr. President, you have an urgent call from a Butters Stotch?
GARRISON
[lost in thought, he perks up] Butters? What's he want? [picks up the phone at his desk] This is the President.
BUTTERS
Oh, uh, eh hello Mr. President. How are you?
STAN
[in Butters' room with Kyle and Kenny] Butter him up, Butters.
BUTTERS
How uh, how is runnin' the country going?
GARRISON
Oh, it's fine. You know, just makin' the country great again.
BUTTERS
Did you get rid of all the immigrants like you said?
GARRISON
I got rid of like, six of 'em so far. You know, it's a little harder than I thought.
BUTTERS
Cool. Ah-and did you build that big wall you were gonna build?
GARRISON
Don't be a dick, Butters. Are you just callin' to shit on my Halloween?
BUTTERS
N-no, sir! I uh, well, the thing is, uh, didn't you used to do J and C Witch Week with our dads?
GARRISON
Yeah, it was my favorite time of year. Now I just have to celebrate it alone.
BUTTERS
Well, the thing is, Mr. President, one of the guys did a spell and took a bunch of children, and he's gonna eat 'em all.
GARRISON
Lemme guess: Chip Duncan. Oh, that guy was always such a douche.
BUTTERS
Mr. President, please, you've gotta help. Our dads can't do anything 'cause they're scared people are comin' after all wtiches.
GARRISON
Comin' after all witches? Oh, Jeez...
[Park County Police Station, night. It's all decked out for Halloween.]
SGT. YATES
So you were there when the witch showed up and took your girlfriend.
CARTMAN
Yes, it just came out of nowhere. I tried to save Heidi, but it was too late.
SGT. YATES
What was your girlfriend wearing?
CARTMAN
She was dressed kind of like me, but had a simple Munich dirndl from Germany.
RICK
And you didn't stop at all to think that what you were doing might attract a witch?
CARTMAN
Excuse me?! Are you actually trying to blame the victim here?!
RICK
No, I'm just saying that if there's a big fat witch around, maybe you shouldn't walk around in the woods dressed as Hansel and Gretel.
CARTMAN
Ohhhhh!
SGT. YATES
Whoa, whoa, not cool, Rick. Not cool.
CARTMAN
I will have your badge, sir!
SGT. YATES
[looks towards the camera] Sorry folks, sorry.
COP 1
Detective! Detective! Call just came in. The witch has been spotted at Ross Dress For Less.
SGT. YATES
Everyone to Ross Dress For Less, now!
[Ross Dress For Less, night. Only a couple of cars are in the parking lot, and the store is closed. A witch wanders into view.]
STEPHEN
Guys? I'm here. Guys? What's this all about?
RANDY
Hello, Stephen.
STEPHEN
Oh, hey. What are we meeting here for?
RYAN
It's too late, Stephen. We called the police. We know you took those children.
STEPHEN
What? What uh, What are you doing?
STEVE
[accompanied by Stuart] Here he is, everybody! Stephen's a bad witch!
STEPHEN
Nooo! [people begin to gather around the witches]
RANDY
We're putting a stop to you, Stephen, because that's what good witches do!
STEPHEN
Oh my God! I see what this is! This witch pursuit thing has you on a witch pursuit thing now! [several police cars pull into the parking lot and officers pour out of them] I'm innocent. Please!
SGT. YATES
It's over, Stotch. What have you done with the children?
STEPHEN
Noho, don't you see?! They're just doing their own witch pursuit thingy now! This is madness! [Chip is heard cackling from up in the air. Everyone looks up to see him flying over Ross Dress For Less, then hug their kids to keep them safe]
CHIP
[lands and gets off the broom] Hey, what's up, bros?
STEPHEN
"What's up, bros?" Chip, do you see all the chaos you've caused?
CHIP
Yeah, so? I'm a witch.
RANDY
Ugh, you understand everyone associates us with you, right?
CHIP
Of course they do. You're all witches too, dudes!
STEVE
Not like you!
STUART
What'd you do with the children?
CHIP
They're all in here! See? [opens his bag]
KIDS
[voices heard while light emanates from the depth of the bag] Daddy, help! Mommy, help! Ahh!
CHIP
I'm going to use their souls to increase my power!
A TOWNSMAN
Look! Another witch is flying down now! [a shot of Air Force One flying towards town]
[Butters' room, night. He's typing something on his computer when Stan enters his room with Kyle and Kenny behind him.]
STAN
Butters, come on! We've gotta go!
BUTTERS
Okay! Where?
STAN
I guess our witches were gonna sacrifice your witch, but then the bad witch showed up and now the witch we called just arrived. There's witches everywhere!
BUTTERS
Holy moly! [leaves his chair and follows the others out]
[The Ross Dress For Less parking lot. Randy tries to reason with Chip.]
RANDY
Look, Chip, if we had known you were gonna hurt people, we would have never even hung out.
CHIP
Oh, give me a break, Randy.
RANDY
No, seriously.
CHIP
Like if one of you guys had the power I have, you wouldn't use it.
RANDY
No we wouldn't!
GARRISON
Excuse me. [makes his way to the front of the group]
CHIP
Oh, hey man!
GARRISON
You're ruining the party for everyone, Chip! I'm here to take you out!
CHIP
[cackles] You'll never stop me! [levitates] I grow more powerful every moment!
GARRISON
You wanna see real power? [into his pocket mic disguised as a lapel pin] All right, take the shot. [a solar-powered satellite takes aim at the President's location with three beeps, and two lasers shoot down towards it. The shot obliterates Chip, but his bag and broom fall away unscathed. A few moments of stunned silence, and the witches celebrate as Garrison fist-pumps. Two officers quickly come up and open the bag]
PETER
[pops out of the bag] I'm free! [two girls pop out]
A GIRL
Mommy! Daddy! [the boy Chip plucked first pops out of the bag]
SGT. YATES
Is that all of them?
COP 2
There's one more little girl. Come on out, little girl.
HEIDI
Okay. Just a second.
COP 2
Com- come on, little girl. Everyone's waitin' on ya.
HEIDI
Okay. Almost ready. Hang on.
CARTMAN
[sighs] It's gonna be a while.
GERALD
Well, we did it, guys.
RYAN
Everyone will be stoked on us now.
RANDY
Hey! And there's still a few nights left of Jack and Crack Witch Week.
GARRISON
Everybody follow me! I've got tons of Jack, tons of crack, and a jet! [the other witches cheer and follow him to the jet]
THE MEN
Party's back on! We did it, guys!
RANDY
[looks back at Sharon] Don't wait up, Sharon! I'm gonna party with El Presidente. [Sharon and remaining townspeople are mad]
[The Turner house, day, Heidi's room. Cartman waits for Heidi on her bed as she plans out her costume in the closet. They're dressed in traditional Halloween costumes, he as Count Dracula, she as a black kitten.]
HEIDI
All ready to trick or treat?
CARTMAN
[bored] Yeah, no. I've been ready for a couple hours now.
