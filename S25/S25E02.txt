The Big Fix

[Colorado Convention Center, exterior, daytime. A banner that reads "Welcome Cannabis Growers! - Cannabis Cultivators Expo" is prominently shown as people enter the convention center. Inside, an exhibit hall featuring cannabis related items on display is shown. Then, Room B is shown, with a sign at the entrance that reads "THE CHANGING FACE OF HEMP FARMING". In the room, a spokesperson is giving a speech about marijuana.]
SPOKESPERSON
As farmers and cultivators of marijuana, we have a responsibility to society... [Randy is seen, high] I know we all respect the crop here, and we seek each day to better understand the nuances and legitimacy of its uses.
RANDY
Let's go weed! Wew!
SPOKESPERSON
But we growers must face a harsh reality– Since the legalization of marijuana, communities of color, black and brown Coloradans, those most affected by the racist war on drugs, have now been locked out of the wealth creation of the industry. [Randy yawns loudly and stretches] Luckily, the public is starting to understand this unfairness– and many people are now talking of boycotting cannabis growers who are only white owned.
RANDY
Boycotting what? Wait... what?
SPOKESPERSON
We are seeing a healthy and dramatic spike in consumers who demand that their marijuana be grown by those who understand the fight for social equity.
RANDY
Ugh ahhug–
SPOKESPERSON
The bottom line is this– a completely white owned weed business these days... just isn't going to survive. [dramatic music plays as the scene cuts away]
[Tegridy Farms, night time. Randy is sitting at the kitchen table with his family.]
RANDY
Guys... I wanna have kind of a tough talk with you. We don't really have any black friends, we don't reach out to the black community. Shelley, you never bring any black dudes over. I mean, Stan, your three best friends are all white.
STAN
There's only one black kid in my whole class.
RANDY
Yes, that kid Token. How come you never hang out with him?
STAN
I do hang out with him!
RANDY
In a group maybe, but I don't recall just you and Token ever doing anything. I've never seen Token here at the farm, just like the two of you guys. Why not?
STAN
I... I don't know.
SHARON
Randy, stop. We're not racists.
RANDY
We'd like to think that, wouldn't we? But... actions speak louder than words, gang. I guess... I guess I just want you to think about it. [he gets up and leaves, leaving the rest of the Marsh family looking confused]
[South Park Elementary, recess. Tolkien is throwing a football with Butters when Stan approaches him.]
STAN
Uh, hey, Token.
TOLKIEN
Oh, hey Stan.
STAN
Uh, listen, I uh... How you doin'?
TOLKIEN
[he looks at Stan] Fine.
STAN
Um... You think your family would wanna come over for dinner? Out at our farm?
TOLKIEN
It's kinda far, isn't it?
STAN
Yeah but... Look, Token, I think maybe you and I should hang out more.
TOLKIEN
What are you talking about?
STAN
I mean, we never just hang out, you and me.
BUTTERS
Hey, we never hang out just you and me either, Stan!
STAN
Shut up, Butters. Look, just will you please just see if your family will come over for dinner? It would mean a lot.
[Tegridy Farms, night time. Randy is setting the table for dinner. The Blacks are sitting with them.]
RANDY
Ok, there we go. This is a farm fresh hemp salad sourced locally here at Tegridy! Alright, come on everybody, dig in.
LINDA
Thank you so much for having us over. This is really nice.
STEVE
We've never been to a marijuana farm before.
RANDY
Well, you know, with our boys starting to become so close– we thought we better get the families together! If they're friends, then we need to be friends! Huh? [he pulls out his phone and starts recording] Do you mind if I post this? [to the camera] Check out our friends! [he snaps the photo]
STEVE
Randy... I hope you didn't invite us here because we're black.
RANDY
W-what are you talking about?
LINDA
It's just that the past year or so a lot of people have been inviting us over to dinner and then taking pictures of us to show everyone on Instagram.
RANDY
Oh, that's so lame. No, we really just wanted to get to know you guys better since Stan is friends with Token. You know... just out of curiosity– why did you guys name him that?
STEVE
What do you mean?
RANDY
Well– I mean, it's just kind of an odd name, isn't it? Like, some people might think you guys naming your son that isn't very cool.
STEVE
People have a problem with Tolkien's name?
RANDY
Well I mean other people just think it's a little... I mean, come on, I mean, I'm– I'm not calling you guys racist, but– why did you name your son that?
LINDA
My husband has always been a huge fan of Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.
STEVE
I wanted to name my son after my favorite author. But she didn't want to name our son J.R.R., so we just named him Tolkien.
RANDY
[shocked] His name is Tolkien?
STEVE
Yes, you know his name is Tolkien!
STAN
[to Tolkien] I thought your name was "Token".
TOLKIEN
My name is "Tolkien".
STEVE
Sorry, I don't think it's that weird. J.R.R. Tolkien is one of the most prolific, influential writers of our time.
RANDY
[to himself] Holy shit, that's what his name means?
STEVE
What did you think his name meant?
RANDY
[pause] Would you like to see how we grow and process our weed?
[Randy is giving Steve Black a tour through the refinery.]
RANDY
You see, it's all about refinement. Here at Tegridy, we believe the best weed is untouched from the earth– so we distill it down to its basic essence. Over there are our clean out vats and up here we have our first stage drying racks. Oh, real quick! [he poses with Steve for a picture] It all takes about six days from the field to a jar that we can sell. So... what do you think?
STEVE
It's... uh, very involved.
RANDY
Yeah, it takes a lot. You know– I just had a crazy idea... Our boys are best friends now... Why don't you come work for Tegridy?
STEVE
Randy, I have a job. I'm a very successful co-executive of a financial consulting firm.
RANDY
Oh my gosh– I was just saying we could really use a co-executive of financial consulting! Look, I... Would it be okay if... If I sent you some of our receipts and you could help us– financial consult?
STEVE
Well that's what we do... Sure.
RANDY
Oh my God, this is amazing. Here's to the start of something wonderful. Would you like some free weed?
STEVE
No.
[Kyle's house, night time. He's at his computer playing video games when his cellphone rings.]
KYLE
[he answers] Hey Stan.
STAN
Dude... my head is reeling, you're not gonna believe this.
KYLE
Not gonna believe what?
STAN
Token's name isn't Token. It's Tolkien.
KYLE
Yeah, I know it's Tolkien.
STAN
No, no, no, no. He's named after the guy who wrote The Hobbit and stuff!
KYLE
Yeah, I know. J.R.R. Tolkien. What did you think it was?
STAN
[horrified] You knew it was Tolkien like the writer.
KYLE
Everyone knew it was Tolkien.
STAN
No, no, no! No, no, no, no! I distinctly remember Cartman wearing a shirt where he spelled it T-O-K-E-N.
KYLE
Yeah, dude, ‘cuz Cartman's a fuckin' moron.
STAN
Wha– hold on a second! [he calls Cartman]
[Cartman residence, night time. Eric is lying on the living room couch, eating a bag of chips.]
CARTMAN
[watching TV while he answers] Whatsup, dog.
STAN
Dude, Cartman, did you know that Tolkien is named after J.R.R. Tolkien?
CARTMAN
Well yeah, I just figured.
STAN
Then why did you spell it "Token" without the "L" or the "I"?!
CARTMAN
J.R.R. Tolkien has an "L" in it? That's gay. Who did you think Tolkien was named after?
TOLKIEN
[from outside the room] Stan? You out here?
STAN
Uh, yeah, hang on a second Tolk-kien, just taking a shit.
TOLKIEN
Oh, okay, sorry.
STAN
Oh my God... I suck...
[The Black residence, early in the morning. Steve Black gets into his car and starts driving, listening to the radio.]
RADIO
This is your mornin' commute, South Park. Looks like we have a bit of slowing heading into town. There's like a truck and a couple cars... maybe take ya a couple minutes there. Also, if you're heading out of town on the main road there's a– there's like a car there, too.
STEVE
What the fuck? [he notices a Tegridy billboard with him and Randy plastered on it]
RADIO
Now let's look at the weather...Weather's looking like we're gonna have a little bit of snow. And the uh– [Steve speeds up]
[Tegridy Farms. Steve Black is knocking angrily on Randy's door. Randy answers.]
STEVE
What the hell are you doing?
RANDY
Taking shit tons of Tegridy orders. Sales are going nuts right now.
STEVE
No– why is my face on a billboard?!
RANDY
Because we work together?
STEVE
You said you just needed someone to help with accounting!
RANDY
Yes, but then– you got promoted! I was gonna surprise you. Don't you see how lucrative this can be? I mean, we make a pretty damn good team in the weed business. I mean, we are Ben and Jerry– We're Ben and Jerry. You're Jerry, and I'm Ben.
TOWELIE
I thought I was Jerry...
RANDY
No, you're a towel.
TOWELIE
Oh, that's even better.
STEVE
I told you before that I'm not interested in the marijuana business. I don't believe in drinking or doing drugs.
RANDY
Doing dru– Do you remember when Bilbo first set out with the dwarves to fight Smaug? What's the first thing they all did? They partied their asses off. [singing] Chip the glasses, click the plates. That's what Bilbo Baggins hates. [pause] And then they certainly had an adventure together, didn't they? Filled with... [he pulls out a wad of cash and puts it in Steve's pocket] Lucrative treasure.
STEVE
You really think we could make a lot of money together?
RANDY
Ben and Jerry, my man. Ben and fuckin' Jerry.
[Stan is sitting at the doctor's office. The doctor enters the room.]
DOCTOR
Hey-hey! Stan the man! How ya doin' buddy? [he reaches out for a fist bump]
STAN
[returning the fist bump] Okay, I guess...
DOCTOR
The nurse said you came here by yourself. No parents?
STAN
I kinda wanted to talk about something in private.
DOCTOR
Oh, okay, pal. What is it?
STAN
I think... I might be horribly racist.[pause]
DOCTOR
Well, kiddo... you don't normally go to a doctor's office for feeling racist, but tell me what happened.
STAN
So... there's this kid at my school, and... he's black. And his parents named him after the guy that wrote Lord of the Rings.
DOCTOR
Uh huh, Tolkien. Great name.
STAN
Yeah... well, I-I thought his name was Token. Like– like a black kid that's just there so that... like... there's a black kid.
DOCTOR
Uh huh... and how long have you thought that?
STAN
The whole time! I've thought that the whole time!
DOCTOR
Wow. Fuck you.
STAN
Huh?
DOCTOR
You really thought a couple of black people had a child and named him Token? Why would anyone name a black kid Token? You're a piece of shit.
STAN
No, I was just try–
DOCTOR
You were just going along with the dominant culture of the white paradigm, that's what you were just– Get out of my office, you make me sick!
STAN
I'm sorry!
DOCTOR
I don't know what's wrong with some people. I wonder if anyone else thought that this kid's name was Token? Hmm? Anybody? Anyone else just assume his name was Token? Because that's disgusting, and you are the problem.
STAN
Doctor?
DOCTOR
I thought I told you to get out of my office, because you seriously make me sick– I'm gonna shit my fucking pants right now.
STAN
Doctor, please, I don't want to be like this! I'll do anything, just tell me what to do!
DOCTOR
Oh, you wanna change? Then I suggest you start doing a lot of reading.
STAN
Okay, what should I read?
DOCTOR
[ignoring Stan] And I suggest that when you're reading– you do it from the perspective of a black person! [he leaves]
[Stan's room. He is sitting on his bed reading a book.]
NARRATOR
[speaking in African-American vernacular dialect] The knight Pigwiggen rides on a frisky earwig, and sends his love, Queen Mab, a bracelet of emmet's eyes, making an assignation... [scene cuts to Stan outside, still reading] Old Tom Bombadil was a merry fellow. Bright blue his jacket was, and his boots was yellow... [scene cuts to him reading in the library] It is told that in their beginning, the dwarves was made by Aule in the darkness of Middle-Earth.
[Music plays over stock footage of a black puppy playing with a white puppy, then a montage of Randy and Steve working at Tegridy Farms]
RANDY
Black puppy and white puppy
Play together in the backyard
Why can't we?
Getting rough with a brand new chew toy
Oh boy
Let's all get along
We all know
That puppies are the same wherever you go
There are good puppies (Mm-hmm)
And bad puppies
When one of them chews a shoe...
[Randy and Steve are now in court, being seen before a judge.]
JUDGE
As the owners of Tegridy Farms, you are accused of plagiarizing a song for your marijuana company. How do you plead?
RANDY
Not guilty, your honor.
JUDGE
The complaint says that you asked for the rights to the song "Ebony and Ivory," but when you were turned down by Paul McCartney, you copied the song into something similar.
RANDY
Not true, your honor. I've never even heard Paul McCartney's version. "Black Puppy White Puppy" is a song I wrote by myself on my piano keyboard.
[The singing resumes, with Randy and Steve now walking in the field at sunset. Randy then puts his arm around Steve's shoulders as they continue their stroll.]
RANDY
Black puppy, white puppy
Playing in the backyard, why can't we?
Black puppy, white puppy
Playing in the back...
[South Park Elementary, Mr. Garrison's classroom. Stan is at the front, wearing glasses and speaking.]
STAN
Guys... lately I've been doing a lot of soul searching. I've had to ask myself hard questions, because for a long time now, I've misinterpreted some amazing writing. I've done a lot of reading... And I've learned why Sauron built the black gate of Mordor across the path of Cirith Grogor, which led into the enclosed plain of Udun. I've learned that the Mouth of Sauron was once a man, who commanded the armies of Gorgoroth and dismissed Aragorn's claim as King.
CARTMAN
[leaning over to Kyle] I think Stan's lost his marbles.
STAN
I firmly believe that everyone would benefit from the school making required reading of these books. Because if we don't fully know about Tolkien, then we can make some terrible, offensive mistakes. In fact... did you guys know that our friend Tolkien, who goes to school here, is named after J.R.R. Tolkien?
BUTTERS
Yup!
CLYDE
Yeah, I knew that.
HEATHER
Why else would his name be Tolkien if it wasn't for the guy that wrote the books?
STAN
[glares] My point is, we need to petition the school to make Tolkien required reading. To better understand our classmate. I think maybe we all haven't done enough to make sure than Tolkien doesn't feel isolated and left out.
TOLKIEN
[opening the door] Guys? Can I come in now?
STAN
Not yet, Token. Just another couple minutes.
TOLKIEN
W-what are you guys talking about?
STAN
[pause] Just a couple minutes, bro. [Tolkien leaves, closing the door]
[Tegridy Farms. Hip hop music plays while Randy and Towelie dance and smoke a joint in the barn.]
MUSIC
Black puppy bitch,
Black, black puppy bitch
White puppy bitch,
Black, white puppy bitch
Black puppy bitch,
White, black puppy bitch
STEVE
[enters the barn] Hey, guys, I've got something really exciting to show you!
RANDY
[the music suddenly stops as he turns around] Ohhhh, buzzkill...
STEVE
I had this awesome idea last night... and I couldn't even sleep, I thought it was so cool–
RANDY
Okay, what is it?
STEVE
[he clicks the keys on his laptop] We do an entire line of cannabis based on all the different races of Middle Earth! [Randy looks unimpressed] We do seven different strains in all, representing the dwarves, the elves, even the uruk hai!
RANDY
Uhh, yeah... no.
TOWELIE
Everyone will think we're dorks! [they both chuckle]
STEVE
[annoyed] Randy, you seem not to care very much about any of my ideas.
RANDY
Well, you're just– you know, you're just not the idea guy.
STEVE
I don't seem to be the anything guy. I thought we were Ben and Jerry.
RANDY
Alright, look, I'm gonna tell you the truth about ice cream– Jerry actually doesn't do shit. Ben does it all, everyone knows that.
STEVE
Well, I don't want to just be here like some kind of... token black person.
RANDY
Oh, come on, I'm sorry.
STEVE
No. I totally get now why you want me around, and I'm not gonna do it. [he storms off]
RANDY
[smoking weed] He doesn't even really sound like a black guy, you know that?
[South Park Elementary gymnasium. PC Principal is holding an assembly for the students.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright everyone, listen up! We have a special announcement today. One of our fourth grade students says he's done a lot of work and has grown as a person. And he'd like to share his journey with you. Please welcome Stan Marsh.
STAN
Sup, guys. You know, I've done a lot of reading lately. And I'd like to announce that the school has allowed me to declare today J.R.R. Tolkien appreciation day! [the crowd is silent] These books go so much deeper than the Hollywood movies. And we see its influences everywhere in our modern culture. In fact, how many of you knew that our classmate Tolkien was named after J.R.R. Tolkien? [every audience member raises their hand] But you don't know that Lord of the Rings was an analogy for World War II, did you?! And I'll bet you didn't know that there was originally 19 Rings of Power that were forged by Celebrimbor! So there's much we need to understand. And so I would like to bring up the man himself. Come on up here, Tolkien! Come on!
TOLKIEN
[the crowd awkwardly claps as Tolkien walks up to Stan] I actually don't like Lord of the Rings. And I don't like The Hobbit. Just cause my dad's into that stuff doesn't mean that I am. I've always hated that my name is Tolkien, but I didn't really have a choice, did I? So please, whatever you do, just don't draw any more attention to my name. I can't stand any of it. It's just a bunch of nerdy, jive-ass dragon shit. [he drops the mic and angrily walks back to his seat]
[Stan's room. He is laying in bed, looking upset. Sharon enters the room.]
SHARON
Stanley? Are you feeling any better?
STAN
Nope. Not any better, Mom.
SHARON
Well, your friend Tolkien came over to see you. He's downstairs.
STAN
Tolkien is... here? [he walks downstairs into the living room] Hey, Tol-kien.
TOLKIEN
Oh, hey, Stan.
STAN
What are you doing here?
TOLKIEN
Stan... Are you ok? You've just been acting kind of strange the last few days.
STAN
Yeah, I'm good. I'm... No, I'm not... Tolkien, I have something I have to tell you.
TOLKIEN
Okay.
STAN
This whole time, I thought your name was "Token". Like... the token black person.
TOLKIEN
Wow.
STAN
Yeah.
TOLKIEN
Wow... Why would my parents name me something that means the only black person?
STAN
I don't know. So I understand if you don't wanna be around me anymore.
TOLKIEN
Well, it's not like I really have a choice. That's why I'm here. My parents just bought the farm across the street.
STAN
What?!
TOLKIEN
Yeah. Out of the blue my dad was just like, "We're going into the farming business!" And we all just picked up and moved.
STAN
Oh, my God, this is great! [he grabs Tolkien's hands and takes him into the kitchen] Mom, Dad, guess what?! Tolkien's family bought the farm across the street! We're neighbors!
SHARON
Oh, that's great!
RANDY
Yeah, that's really cool boys– Wait, wha-a-a-t?! [he runs outside to see the Blacks setting up "Credigree Weed"] What the hell's going on?!
STEVE
Oh, hey, Randy. What'dya think of the new place?
RANDY
Credigree Weed? How stupid is that?! Credigree isn't even a word!
UNNAMED MAN
[pulling up in his car] Uh, hello, we'd like to buy a little weed.
UNNAMED WOMAN
It's our anniversary!
RANDY
Well, there's really good weed across the street! Tegridy weed?
UNNAMED MAN
Yeah, we're just– we're looking for something with a little more... street cred.
UNNAMED WOMAN
Yeah, a little more cred!
STEVE
Well, y'all came to the right business, cuz this shit is hard!
RANDY
Oh, oh! He didn't even talk like that before! This guy is a total phony! Now just come across the street, and I'll show you some real nice weed made with Tegridy! These people don't even belong here!
UNNAMED MAN
Wow, bro, you're a racist piece of shit. [to Steve] Can we see what you've got, please?
STEVE
Hell yeah, we got all kinds of shit– Lemme give you a sample of my Rivendell Elvish Magic... [he walks away with the couple]
RANDY
[rushing back inside, furious] They stole it! They stole my idea!
SHARON
Who did?
RANDY
Those dickheads across the street! They took everything I learned about using black culture to make a bigger profit and they're doing it themselves! [he points to Tolkien] Get this little prick outta my house! [he forcefully grabs Tolkien]
STAN
Dad!
RANDY
Get him outta here, he's a spy! [he chases Tolkien out of the house before shouting at Steve] Hey, fuck face! I don't want your kid over at my house, you got that?!
STEVE
Hey man, what's your problem?!
RANDY
You want a war? Well, you got one! Game on, asshole!
STEVE
[pause] Game on, muthafucker.
RANDY
[angrily] Everyone back in the house. Come on, let's go.
STAN
But Dad–
RANDY
Shut up! [he slams the door]
DOCTOR
The story of young Stan Marsh might seem incredible, but the fact is many people suffer from unconscious biases. [he steps into frame] If you or someone you know might have also thought the name Tolkien didn't come from J.R.R. Tolkien, then please call... 1-800-I AM A GIANT PIECE OF SHIT. Because you are the fucking problem.
