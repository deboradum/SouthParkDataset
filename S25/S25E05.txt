Help, My Teenager Hates Me!

[Broflovski residence, Gerald's office, daytime. Gerald is seen sitting down as he types on his computer, presumably doing work. All of a sudden, Kyle comes rushing into the office as he begins to talk fast and pace around the room excitedly.]
KYLE
Dad! Dad, there's this new place and you can actually go and shoot each other, only it's soft BBs and they're biodegradable, and the guns are, like, totally real except you don't actually get hurt, and it's like paintball except for there's no mess, and the stuff all looks totally real, and it's called Airsoft and can I get one?
GERALD
[confused] Wha– Wha– What?
KYLE
There's an airsoft field where everybody plays on teams, and I promise I'll take good care of the equipment, and if you think about it, it's a really great hobby for team building and learning communication and –
GERALD
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
KYLE
I was just thinking if you could come to the Airsoft store with me – [clasps his hands together] please, please, please, all my friends already bought their stuff, and it's totally a way for us to play outside like you always say – [rushes out to the door] come on, please only we can't tell mom cuz she won't understand, but it's totally safe cuz you wear eye protection.
GERALD
[gets up from his chair] Okay, okay, Kyle, breathe.
[A few moments later, they both arrive outside of South Park Airsoft Armory. Kyle gets out of the car, clearly excited to enter the shop.]
KYLE
Here it is! Isn't this cool?!
GERALD
"Airsoft Armory"?
KYLE
Come on, dad! You gotta check it out!
[Inside the shop. Kyle opens the doors and rushes inside to check everything it has to offer. Gerald walks inside too, looking rather surprised to the amount of fake artillery they sell.]
GERALD
My God! Is this stuff real?!
KYLE
No, dad! It's Airsoft. It's like paintball, only it's way cooler and it just looks totally real.
GERALD
I-I really don't think your mom would approve, Kyle…
KYLE
Dad… please. I'm not a baby anymore. The other guys – they already got their stuff. We're playing today! Can I please just get, like, an AK-47 and maybe a glock?
GERALD
This stuff is expensive! Is this really how you want to spend your allowance?
KYLE
[excitedly] Yeah, yeah! It really is! [he walks away to check out other merchandise]
GERALD
These are all, like, legal, right?
AIRSOFT ARMORY SALESMAN
Uh, yes, sir. You see, you load these soft BBs into the guns and they just kinda sting. And you can put the soft BBs into grenades, rocket launchers, all kinds of stuff.
GERALD
So it's all totally safe?
AIRSOFT ARMORY SALESMAN
Well, I wouldn't particularly say that…I mean – all the stuff is safe, the guns and grenades and things… but – but not necessarily the people who mostly play Airsoft…
GERALD
What people mostly play Airsoft?
AIRSOFT ARMORY SALESMAN
Teenagers. [the music intensifies]
[Blinky's Airsoft. Teenagers are gathered around looking all bored and uninterested as they listen to the referee's instructions.]
AIRSOFT REFEREE
Alright, Airsofters, let's listen up. Before we let you onto the field, we need to run through our safety precautions.
TEENAGERS
[in unison] Bruhhh..
TEENAGER 1
We know all the safety stuff –
AIRSOFT REFEREE
First, your Airsoft guns must all have a red tip –
TEENAGER 2
Bruh, we know…
AIRSOFT REFEREE
Second, there is no full auto allowed on the field.
TEENAGER 3
Bruh…
AIRSOFT REFEREE
Third, there is a 500 fps limit for your BBs.
TEENAGER 1
Bruh, can we play now?
AIRSOFT REFEREE
If you're hit by a BB, raise your hand, say "hit", and go back to respawn.
TEENAGER 2
Yes, already, yes!
AIRSOFT REFEREE
Alright, you guys are Team Rogue Wolf. [he pulls out a clipboard] You guys will be playing against– where is Team Floppy Weiner?
CARTMAN
Right here!
[Kyle, Stan, Kenny and Cartman come into frame a few moments later with Airsoft guns and equipment in hand. The boys look excited to play some Airsoft.]
TEENAGER 3
What?!
TEENAGER 2
Bruh, no! We aren't playing with little kids!
TEENAGER 3
Yeah, it'll be too easy!
AIRSOFT REFEREE
Alright, fine! Then we'll split the kids up on two teams and each one will have a teenager partner.
TEENAGER 3
Bruh, seriously?
AIRSOFT REFEREE
Kid with the poof ball, that's your teenager–
TEENAGER 1
Bruh!
AIRSOFT REFEREE
Green hat kid, that's your teenager– Team B, those are your two teenagers.
CARTMAN
Alright, sweet! Me and Kenny and our teenagers are gonna smoke you guys!
[Airsoft battle area. Everyone begins to get into their positions as the game is set to begin.]
TEENAGER 4
Go! Go, go, go, go!
TEENAGER 1
Come on! This way! [BB bullets begin to go off]
CARTMAN
Yes! Yes! Yes!!
[Intense music begins playing as the boys and the teenagers play Airsoft intensely. The sound of BB bullets are heard all over the field as the teams try to eliminate each other.]
[Meanwhile, Kyle and Cartman get into a safe position in the field. Kyle shoots BBs at Cartman and successfully manages to hit him.]
KYLE
I got you, Cartman!
CARTMAN
You didn't get me!
KYLE
I totally got you! I heard it hit your jacket. Say hit and and go back to respawn.
CARTMAN
You didn't hit me, Kyle! The BBs bounced off a leaf or something, 'cause– [Kyle begins to fire off BBs and Cartman raises a hand in defeat] Agh, agh! Ok – ok, hit! You got me. That was sweet. [walks off]
STAN'S TEENAGER
I'm outta green gas, you got green gas?!
STAN
Yeah, I got some right here, partner! [he gets out an air tank and hands it to his partner]
KENNY'S TEENAGER
Bruh, keep shooting!
KENNY
(Yeah!! Woo-hoo!)
[In another area of the airsoft field. Kyle is wandering around aimlessly, looking for other targets. Cartman is behind him with a BB sniper rifle and begins to slowly aim toward Kyle.]
CARTMAN
[to himself] Oh, my God… this is the greatest day of my fucking life.
[Cartman slowly steadies his aim, and after a few seconds, he shoots a BB at Kyle's face.]
KYLE
Ow, oww! [he raises his hand and walks off] Hit!
CARTMAN
Yes! Yes!! That was so awesome!! You guys, Airsoft fucking rules! This is– [a BB goes off and hits him in the chest] Ow! Hit! Hit! This is sweet!
[Later in the day. The boys are walking back home from Blinky's Airsoft. On the way back, they express their excitement over today.]
KYLE
That was so cool!
CARTMAN
Best thing ever!
KENNY
(That was fucking great!)
STAN
Dude, I can't believe we tied! That was epic.
CARTMAN
Yeah, well, Team Floppy Weiner will get you guys next time!
KYLE
That was seriously the best time I've had in forever!
KENNY
(Me too!)
STAN
And you know what else is cool? We all have teenagers now!
KYLE
I know! My teenager said he's gonna come over and show me how to clean my gun! [he notices Cartman crying] Cartman? Are you ok?
CARTMAN
[sniffles] I'm just really happy, you guys… [his voice breaks a bit from crying] Airsoft is seriously, like, the greatest thing in the whole world. Well, here's my house. Thanks, you guys. For just a few, brief hours I forgot how much everything sucks. [he walks back home] Can we promise each other we'll do Airsoft, like, all the time?
STAN
Hell yeah, dude! We just gotta keep our teenagers happy and we can play Airsoft all the time!
CARTMAN
[softly] I love you guys. [he makes his way inside his hot dog house]
[Broflovski residence, the bathroom, nighttime. Kyle is standing on a stool as he applies makeup on his cheek to cover up his bruise from earlier today in Airsoft. Kyle has a smile on his face. Gerald walks in on him, looking confused at what Kyle is doing.]
GERALD
Hey, Kyle… Uh, how did the Airsoft go?
KYLE
I took a BB right to the face with a sniper rifle. It was so great, dad!
GERALD
Are you sure this isn't all a little too much for you, son?
KYLE
I'm not a baby anymore, dad! [the doorbell rings] Ooh! Oh, that's probably my teenager! See ya, dad! I love you! [he makes his way to go open the door]
GERALD
I love you too, Kyle.
KYLE
[the doorbell ring is being constantly rung] I got it!
SHEILA
Gerald… why is Kyle wearing my makeup on his face?
GERALD
He's just… experimenting.
[Downstairs in the living room. Kyle walks over to the front door to open it as the doorbell constantly rings. He opens the door to see his teenager and the mother.]
MOTHER
Are you Kyle?
KYLE
Yeah!
MOTHER
I'm here to drop off Trevor. He said he is your teenager now.
KYLE
Yeah, that's right!
MOTHER
Okay! Well, good luck.
TREVOR
What time are you picking me up?!
MOTHER
Just gimme a call– don't make it too soon, though, because I am going to relax.
TREVOR
Fine, go ahead, I'm glad! Go away, I don't wanna see your stupid fucking face!
[Trevor flips off his mother and enters inside. He makes himself comfortable on the living room couch as he grabs the TV remote and scrolls through channels.]
KYLE
Cool, dude, so, uh, you wanna, like, clean our Airsoft guns?
TREVOR
[angrily] I'm fucking starving to death! Can you make me some fucking food?!
KYLE
Well…Like, what kind of food do you want?
TREVOR
Fucking leave me alone!!
KYLE
Okay! Okay! Okay! [he walks away from Trevor]
[Tegridy Farms, Stan's room. He is cleaning his airsoft gun and his phone begins to ring. He picks up.]
STAN
Hello?
STAN'S TEENAGER
Bruh, how do I make ramen?
STAN
[pause] Excuse me?
STAN'S TEENAGER
I'm starving, and the instructions are all stupid.
STAN
Oh, is this my teenager? How's it going, dude?
STAN'S TEENAGER
It's not going! The ramen's all hard and I can't eat it like that!
STAN
Well, you have to put the noodles in boiling water.
STAN'S TEENAGER
Where do I get water?
STAN
You… Do you have a sink?
STAN'S TEENAGER
Bruh.
STAN
Bruh, what?
STAN'S TEENAGER
I'm sorry I'm not a five-star chef!!
STAN
Hey, man, it's cool! Lemme, uh– lemme slow it down for ya.
[Cartman's hot dog house. Cartman is watching Airsoft compilation videos on his phone.]
SWAMP SNIPER
That one right there! Take him out!
CARTMAN
Dude, Swamp Sniper rules.
[A few seconds later, Cartman's teenager walks inside without saying a word. He walks up to the refrigerator to look for food.]
CARTMAN
[confused] Hello? [his teenager says nothing] What– What are you doing, dude?
CARTMAN'S TEENAGER
I need a bathroom!
CARTMAN
You– You need to use my bathroom?
CARTMAN'S TEENAGER
I have to go to the bathroom– brah, what?! [he enters the bathroom and slams the door shut]
[McCormick Residence, living room. A knock is heard on the door and Kenny goes to open it. It's Kyle.]
KYLE
Dude, Kenny, the weirdest thing just happened. My teenager showed up at my house and he's acting really strange.
KENNY
(Yeah! Mine too.)
KYLE
Yours did too?
KENNY'S TEENAGER
Why do I have all these fucking zits on my face?!
KENNY
(Dude, I don't know, I'm trying to think!)
KENNY'S TEENAGER
You don't even fucking care! You don't care because you don't even fucking know me!! [he slams the bathroom door shut]
KYLE
What the hell are these things?
[Blinky's Airsoft arena, daytime. A match of Airsoft is taking place. Stan and Kenny are with their respective teams. Kenny runs for cover and begins to shoot BBs at the enemy team. Stan sneaks out to check if the coast is clear, but Kenny begins to shoot. He runs for cover with his teenager teammate.]
STAN
Dude, that's my friend Kenny, we gotta kill him!
STAN'S TEENAGER
I don't take orders from you!
STAN
Okay, okay, but if we kill Kenny we get a point, right? Come on!
[The match continues on, as Stan fires more BBs. They all hit Kenny as he tries to run away.]
KENNY
(Agh! Hit, hit, hit!) [he raises his hand]
AIRSOFT REFEREE
Hey, hey, hey! No shooting from less than 10 feet!
STAN'S TEENAGER
I wasn't less than 10 feet!
STAN
It's okay, it's fine. We're sorry.
STAN'S TEENAGER
I'm not gonna play anymore. This is stupid!
STAN
Dude, it's ok, it's just a gay rule. Come on, let's beat these guys!
[The match continues. More BBs begin to fire off and the game begins to intensify.]
TEENAGER 1
Hit!
STAN
[he takes his phone out and dials] Dude, Kyle, where are you? We started playing like 20 minutes ago.
[Inside of a supermarket. Kyle is seen walking an aisle.]
KYLE
Yeah, I know! My teenager asked me to take him shopping for hair gel.
STAN
Hair gel?! What the fuck, dude, we're getting killed out here!
KYLE
Just do your best, I'll be there as fast as I can! [hangs up the call] Okay, here it is. This is the health care aisle. Could you go a little faster?
[Trevor, Kyle's teenager, walks very slowly while pushing on a shopping cart. He is looking down angrily at the floor.]
KYLE
Okay, here's all the hair product stuff. Which one would you like to use?
TREVOR
I don't know.
KYLE
What?
TREVOR
[loudly] I don't know!
CARTMAN
[he walks up to Kyle] Kyle? What are you doing here?
KYLE
Ugh, nothing, I'm… I'm just shopping with my teenager.
TREVOR
Can we go now?
KYLE
Okay, but you asked me if I could buy you some hair gel.
TREVOR
Shut up…
CARTMAN
Well, at least I'm not the only one dealing with this crap.
[Cartman's teenager walks in. Similarly to Trevor, he pushes a shopping cart slowly while looking down on the floor.]
KYLE
Your guy wants hair gel, too?
CARTMAN
No, my teenager wants more lotion. [he takes Kyle to the side to talk with him privately] All this guy does is hang out in the bathroom and go through like two bottles of lotion a day. I swear I don't know how soft you could possibly want your hands to be.
KYLE
I just wanna get to the Airsoft field. Stan says your team is killing them.
CARTMAN
[excitedly] Damn right! Team Floppy Weiner will destroy you guys!
KYLE
Yeah, we'll see when I use my sniper rifle!
CARTMAN
You have to find me first!
CARTMAN'S TEENAGER
I gotta go to the bathroom.
CARTMAN
Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me! There's one over by the registers. No, you are not taking the lotion! [he grabs it from his teenager]
CARTMAN'S TEENAGER
I fucking hate you! [he walks away angrily]
CARTMAN
Okay, I'm sorry you hate me. Just wanna fucking play Airsoft, buddy.
[Tegridy Farms. Stan is sleeping very comfortably, until he gets a phone call.]
STAN
Oh, my God, you gotta be shitting me. [Stan answers the phone] Yeah—hello?
[In Stan's Teenager room.]
STAN'S TEENAGER
[the teenager is playing with a lighter] I'm not gay.
STAN
Whuh—what?
STAN'S TEENAGER
Why'd you call me gay?! Like, what the hell do you know?! You don't even fucking know me.
STAN
I-I didn't call you gay.
STAN'S TEENAGER
They said I couldn't shoot a BB within 10 feet, and I just had to say bang bang, and you got all Salty and said I was gay.
STAN
I was saying the rule was gay. I wasn't talking anything about sexual orientation.
STAN'S TEENAGER
Bruh.
STAN
You're right, I shouldn't have used that word! Look—I was one of the first people ever to say there was nothing wrong with being gay. I had a dog that was gay!
STAN'S TEENAGER
Oh, so I'm a fucking dog now?! I'll fucking kill you!
STAN
Okay, dude… what… do you want me to do?
STAN'S TEENAGER
I want you to just leave me alone!
STAN
Okay, but you called me… hello? Hello?
STAN'S TEENAGER
[stars screaming]
STAN
What are you doing?
STAN'S TEENAGER
I'm holding my hand over a lighter! It's burning the shit out of my hand
STAN
Okay, don't hold your hand over a lighter.
STAN'S TEENAGER
Bruh! Bruh, this hurts so bad! Oh dude, it's fucking black! Is that what a third degree burn looks like?!
STAN
Jesus fucking Christ.
STAN'S TEENAGER
Dood, I just so lit burned my hand. I need like—I need like emergency services. Bruh, that was stupid.
STAN
Yeah, that was kinda stupid.
STAN'S TEENAGER
I'm not fucking stupid!
[At Denny's.]
STAN
I seriously don't know what to do… I've tried being nice, I've tried being harsh… and I get nothing from my teenager. Nothing.
KENNY
(Yeah…)
KYLE
Well, you're lucky. At least your teenager doesn't threaten to kill you.
STAN
I'd love him to threaten to do anything. I'd love him to do. Anything.
CARTMAN
On the rare occasion that my teenager isn't in the bathroom, all he does is talk about his miserable life. I'm like—okay, dude, I've got problems too. But of course teenagers don't care about your problems. I'm like, "look, buddy, I live in a hot dog. Ok? Like, maybe let's stop bitching and just play Airsoft." But you can't say that because then they're just gonna—
BOYS
Want to kill themselves.
CARTMAN
Yes, yes.
KENNY
(So, what do we do? Do we give up Airsoft?)
STAN
No, we can't give up on Airsoft—I'm like four hundred dollars into this hobby.
KYLE
And we love it.
STAN
Except for the part about being around teenagers.
KYLE
Well, apparently a lot of people are in the same situation we're in.
STAN
What do you mean?
KYLE
I've been reading this book—"Help, My Teenager Hates Me".
STAN
Wow.
KYLE
Yeah…and… it has some interesting ideas. It says we're basically just dealing with an age difference and we need to try and connect with them.
KENNY
(How?)
KYLE
It says…we should take them camping.
CARTMAN
[side-eyes Kenny] Camping?
[At a camping spot. The boys are doing everything, while the teenagers sit around bored.]
KENNY'S TEENAGER
Bruh…
THE TEENAGERS
Bruh…
STAN
Alright, guys! We got the tents all set up.
KYLE
Yeah, check 'em out!
KENNY
(Yeah, it's really beautiful.)
KYLE
There's a lake over there where we can rent kayaks!
STAN
So, what do you guys wanna do?
STAN'S TEENAGER
Go home?
STAN
'Kay, yeah, we can do that later, but first maybe, um… let's bond a bit…
CARTMAN
[waiting outside the bathroom] Okay, looks like the tents are set up—can you come out now?
CARTMAN'S TEENAGER
[inside the bathroom] I'm going to the bathroom.
CARTMAN
Okay, well, you should probably finish up. I know you took the lotion in there. You really don't need soft hands for camping.
CARTMAN'S TEENAGER
[inside the bathroom] Leave me alone!
CARTMAN
[Cartman tries opening the door, but it's locked, so he knocks] Come on, dude. No shit in the world takes that long.
[At Kyle's house. Kyle is sitting on his bed, looking troubled at his airsoft gun.]
GERALD
[knocks on the door] Hey, buddy, what's up? I thought you were gonna go out and play Airsoft today?
KYLE
No… I don't think I'm gonna go…
GERALD
Oh. [Gerald sits besides Kyle on the bed] D-Did something happen?
KYLE
You wouldn't understand, Dad. I just can't deal with teenagers.
GERALD
Oh. Well, you know, they say that the… brain chemistry of a teenager is the same as that of a psychopath. The hormones and all that—it's been proven they're literally criminally insane.
KYLE
You know, I just [Kyle starts to get teary eyed]—I just wanted to have fun—and shoot my friends. [Kyle reaches closer to Gerald, crying] I-I just wanted to shoot my friends, dad.
GERALD
[Gerald hugs Kyle] Oh, buddy. Well, maybe you could ask the Airsoft field to let you play without the teenagers.
KYLE
We did! They said they hate the teenagers just as much as anybody, but they can't get rid of them. And we've got no one else to partner with.
GERALD
Well… did you guys ever consider your dads?
[South Park Airsoft Armory.]
GERALD
Come on in, boys.
RANDY
Jesus Christ…
STUART
How long has this store been here?
GERALD
[Gerald grabs one of the rifles and cocks it] What do you think? This one can shoot a thousand BBs in like five seconds.
RANDY
Seems pretty dangerous. What if the police thought that gun was real?
GERALD
No, it's safe. See? As long as your gun has a red tip and you're white, police won't shoot you.
RANDY
Oh, that's good.
AIRSOFT ARMORY SALESMAN
How can I, uh… help you gentlemen?
GERALD
We need some equipment. We're gonna try and take out some teenagers.
AIRSOFT ARMORY SALESMAN
Uh… I think that's a somewhat foolhardy plan. Have you seen the kind of weaponry the teenagers buy? It's some of the biggest, nastiest weapons we sell.
GERALD
Yeah, well, I've got something bigger. [Gerald pulls out a credit card] American Express Platinum. Give me one of everything you have.
AIRSOFT ARMORY SALESMAN
Yes, sir!
[Blinky's Airsoft.]
STAN
We… have completely had it up to here with you!
CARTMAN
Up to here!
STAN
Our friend Kyle just wanted to play Airsoft. And now he's quit because of your attitudes. What do you have to say for yourselves?
STAN'S TEENAGER
Bruh.
STAN
Yeah, bruh. Great, thank you. [Stan turns around pissed] I can't… I can't…
CARTMAN
Guys, things have to improve. They just have to. I've never seen anyone so disrespectful.
KENNY
(And completely insensitive! What's going to happen when you grow up?! You have to learn responsibility!)
CARTMAN
I've never seen Kenny like this, ever.
STAN'S TEENAGER
Fine, then just leave! Cuz we don't want you here.
STAN
And we don't want you here! We just wanna fucking play Airsoft without any of you on our team!
TEENAGER 1
Fine, then why don't you just be on your own team?
STAN
That sounds totally fine! Us against you, let's fucking go!
TEENAGER 2
Fine and if we win, you stay out of our lives forever!
STAN
Fine, and you too when we beat all of you!
TEENAGER 3
Yeah, you and what army?!
GERALD
This army!
STAN
[Gerald, Randy and Stuart walk into the place] Dad?
KENNY
(Dad?)
STUART
Any of you pussy teenagers wanna Airsoft against some drunk rednecks?
KYLE
We got new partners, guys!
CARTMAN
That's awesome. I wish I had a dad. And that I didn't live in a hot dog.
RANDY
Oh, we got you a partner too, Eric. You might remember Stan's Uncle Jimbo.
JIMBO
["My Name Is Ruin" by Gary Numan starts playing, Jimbo walks in fully equipped, holding an airsoft minigun] Did somebody say somethin' about Airsoft against teenagers?!
[The teenagers look scared, a montage starts. The two teams, the kids with the adults and the teenagers get on the Airsoft field and start shooting each other.]
TEENAGER 4
Ow! Hit! Ow! I said hit, you bitch!
STUART
That's it, son! Light 'em up!
KENNY
(Fuck yeah, Dad!)
TEENAGER 5
Hit!
TEENAGER 4
Hit!
TEENAGER 6
Bruh!
JIMBO
[Jimbo shoots the minigun at several teenagers] Yee-haw! [to Cartman] But there's one teenager I can't seem to find!
CARTMAN
I know where he is… [Cartman walks up to the bathrooms] I'm so sick of this crap… [he cocks his gon and kicks the door in]
CARTMAN'S TEENAGER
[busy in the bathroom] Bruh! What the hell are you doin'?!
CARTMAN
What you do to Jegens Lotion isn't right. [Cartman sets his rifle to full auto, and starts shooting the teenager]
CARTMAN'S TEENAGER
Ow! Ow! Ow! Bruh! Agh, bruh! Aah!
CARTMAN
[shooting the whole cartridge] Aaaagh!
CARTMAN'S TEENAGER
Ow, my dick! My dick! Aagh!
STAN
They're not coming out of cover! I don't see them!
RANDY
It's ok, I have an idea… [Randy takes out a jar of Tegridy Weed] Cover me! [Stan provides cover while Randy runs to the middle of the field and sets the opened jar on a box, then runs back to cover]
TEENAGER 7
[sniffs the weed] Bruh…
TEENAGER 1
[sniffs] Dood… that's weed. I smell weed.
TEENAGER 3
[in the meantime, Randy prepares a grenade of BBs, while the teenagers approach the weed in the middle of the field] That smells dope!
TEENAGER 4
Dood, it's a whole lit jar of weed!
TEENAGER 1
Dope! That is so dope, bruh! [Randy throws the BBs grenade to the middle of the teenagers]
TEENAGER 8
Bruh.
TEENAGERS
[the grenade explodes, the teenagers fall on the floor] Ow! Aaagh! Ow! Bruh! Bruh! Aaagh! Bruh!
STAN
Yeah!
[In the street, walking back home. The boys, their dads and Jimbo are cheering due to the teenagers' defeat.]
STAN
That was so epic!
GERALD
Did you see how those teenagers ran?
STAN
That was so sweet, you guys! I bet the teenagers will never go back to that place again!
STUART
Of course they won't! I saw half of 'em break their guns in frustration.
KYLE
[to the parents] Hey, thanks, you guys. We couldn't have gotten rid of the teenagers without you.
STAN
Yeah, thanks, Dad.
KENNY
(Thanks, Dad.)
GERALD
Hey, that's what we're here for, right? We're just glad you wanted to spend some time with us.
JIMBO
Well, I'm hungry, is there any place around here to get a hot dog?
CARTMAN
Yes… yes, I live in a hot dog! It's right over here! Come on, you guys, help me get it all ready!
STAN
Ok, let's go!
KYLE
Come on, guys!
RANDY
["My Name is Ruin" by Gary Numan plays again, Randy points his rifle at the boys running towards the hot dog] Should I take them out now?
GERALD
[Gerald makes Randy lower his gun] Not yet… we still have a few good years before they turn into monsters.
End of Help, My Teenager Hates Me!
