Volcano

[In front of Cartman's house. Jimbo, Ned, and the boys are waiting for Cartman.]
LIANE
Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous.
CARTMAN
Okay, Mom.
KYLE
Ready to go hunting, Cartman?
STAN
Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?
JIMBO
That's right, Stanley. Animals are much easier to shoot in the morning.
LIANE
Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts.
JIMBO
Don't worry Mrs. Cartman, we'll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe.
NED GERBLANSKY
Hello, Mrs. Cartman. How are you today?
LIANE
Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy.
[The other boys laugh.]
CARTMAN
Dude, that's sick mom.
LIANE
And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away.
[They laugh some more.]
CARTMAN
Drive, Drive!
LIANE
You give your mommy a kissy.
CARTMAN
Drive the car damn-it, drive!
[In the Humvee.]
KYLE
[In a slight falsetto.] Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.
CARTMAN
Shut up, I'm not scared of nothing.
STAN
Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman.
KENNY
(Maybe she'll suck my dick.)
JIMBO
Oh, ho, that's disgusting.
CARTMAN
You piece of crap, I'll kill you!
[Cartman starts fighting with Kenny.]
JIMBO
That's the spirit boys, let's get that testosterone flowin'.
CARTMAN
Eeeeenh!
[He is about to strike Kenny again.]
JIMBO
Now boys, boys, ah-I need to get serious for a minute. I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting, since this is your first time. First, don't ever walk with your gun unless the safety's on. Second, don't shoot anything that looks human, and third, never spill your beer in the bullet chamber.
STAN
Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer.
JIMBO
You what?!?
NED
mmmMoh Yeah, that's right, I don't think eight year old kids drink beer, mmm.
KYLE
I like chocolate milk.
JIMBO
Well, we'll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip; After all, hunting sober is like ...fishing ...sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while, away from civilization.
[Jimbo drives the Humvee up a small mountain very close to town.]
[On the mountain.]
JIMBO
Welp, here we are. Okay, each of you young 'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes.
CARTMAN
Hey, I didn't get a gun.
[Jimbo hands him one.]
CARTMAN
Sweet. This is like the gun I used in 'Nam
STAN
You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman.
NED
Were you stationed in Da Nang?
STAN
Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says.
CARTMAN
Hey, I'll blow your friggin' head off.
[They point their guns at each other, Jimbo rushes up.]
JIMBO
Hey, look out son, that's dangerous. You're gonna spill your beer.
STAN
My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa.
KYLE
Wow, that'd be cool.
CARTMAN
My mom says there's a lot of black people in Africa.
JIMBO
Boys, looky there. That there's a Rocky Mountain black bear ...one of the few remaining of its kind. Isn't it beautiful... By God, it's coming right for us!
[Shoots it. It is hit and flips off the mound it was on.]
STAN
Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there.
JIMBO
Shhh, not so loud. Now that there's just a technicality.
KYLE
What do you mean?
JIMBO
You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting.
CARTMAN
Democrats piss me off!
JIMBO
They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore, unless they're posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot somethin', we have to say 'It's coming right for us.'
STAN
Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo.
NED
Mmm, Jimbo look, mm.
JIMBO
Ohho, it's a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It's coming right for us!
[Jimbo pulls out a bazooka, mounts it on his shoulder, and fires a rocket. All that's left of the deer is a hind leg, which falls over.]
CARTMAN
Kickass!!
[Everyone is in creep position now, except Jimbo.]
JIMBO
Did you see that?! I was imperiled by that ferocious, charging buck.
NED
Moohh, rabbit, rabbit, 5 o'clock.
[A rabbit hops blissfully into view.]
JIMBO
[Drops to the ground.] Let's move, moove!
[He hustles off to the right. Ned follows.]
STAN
Is this hunting?
KYLE
I guess so.
CARTMAN
Ah, dude! I'm starting to have flashbacks.
KYLE
What?!
CARTMAN
Danforth, pull up flank! Look out for Charlies- up in the trees!
[On the ridge.]
JIMBO
This one's yours Stan.
[Stan aims at the bunny, but it just blinks at him. Jimbo coaxes.]
JIMBO
[Calmly.]It's coming right for us.
NED
It's coming right for us.
[Stan focuses. The bunny blinks.]
KYLE
Shoot it Stan.
CARTMAN
I got your back, soldier.
[Stan lowers his gun.]
STAN
I can't.
[The bunny hops away.]
JIMBO
What the? What's wrong with you?
STAN
I don't wanna shoot the bunny.
JIMBO
What the hell are you talking about, 'you don't wanna shoot the bunny?' You're babbling, you're not making any sense, you're hysterical.
STAN
I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny.
JIMBO
No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree-hugger.
CARTMAN
Yeah hippie, go back to Woodstock if you can't shoot anything.
STAN
I can shoot you, fat ass!
CARTMAN
I can shoot you too!
STAN
I'll kill you!
CARTMAN
I'll fill you full of lead!
[The mountain rumbles.]
KYLE
Hey, what's that?
[South Park Center for Seismic Activity, Randy is humming: another day and all is quiet. A rumble is heard in the distance, but Randy is dozing off. A stronger rumble rolls through.]
[Randy checks the seismograph.]
RANDY MARSH
What the heck is this?
[He places a call.]
RANDY
Yeah, Frank, it's uh Randy, Uh huh, good, Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle's moving. Yeah, it's going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? ...Uh huh ...Uh huh ...Let me check.
[He looks out the window at the volcano, which shows a column of steam.]
RANDY
Yeah, it's smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano!
[Dramatic music builds, then Randy...sips his coffee.]
[Night on the mountain.]
CARTMAN
My weenies won't cook.
NED
Mmm, this wood won't burn, umm.
JIMBO
Well, Ned, looks like we'll have to use the old Indian fire trick.
NED
Mmm, yepper.
[Ned pours gasoline on the fire. The flames run up the stream and set Ned aflame.]
NED
Mmm, aahh, oh.
JIMBO
Hehehaahaa, hey, stop-drop-and roll Ned. Haaahaaaaahaha!!
[Ned drops and rolls. He knocks the gas can over, and the flaming gas blows up the Hummer.]
STAN, KYLE
Whoa!
JIMBO
Goddamnit Ned, I just got that van. How the hell are we supposed to get home?
NED
Mmm, oh, it hurts, it hurts, mmm.
[Cartman is now cooking his weenies over Ned's burning body.]
CARTMAN
Hey you guys, this works pretty good right meah.
[City Hall, The following morning.]
CHEF
But you see Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What's next, meatloaf?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
We are quite aware of your concerns Chef, but...
[The intercom beeps. She answers.]
JOHNSON
Mayor, the geologist is here to see you.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
My geologist? Now? Tell him the infection is fine and I don't need another check-up.
JOHNSON
No mayor, that's a gynecologist. A geologist studies the earth.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Don't you think I know that? How dare you insult my intellect, I went to Princeton for God's sake! You get out of my office!
JOHNSON
I'm not in your office mayor, I'm talking to you through a speaker.
[Long pause.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Just send in the geometrist.
JOHNSON
Geologist...
MAYOR MCDANIELS
You are fired, buddy!
JOHNSON
Thank you mayor, it's been great working for you.
[Randy enters.]
RANDY
Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
What does this mean to the town?
RANDY
Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad.
[He points out relative damage levels on a chart.]
RANDY
Right now South Park is here.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
My God!
CHEF
Mayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Ooh, this is big! Johnson, Johnson, are you there? [Beeps out.]
TED
Uhh, you just fired Johnson, Mayor. I'm his replacement, Ted.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Ted, we have got a major crisis here. I want you to get on the phone and call Inside Edition, Rescue 911-uh, and Entertainment Tonight-eh. [Thump.] Better get my stylist on the phone too. Don't worry, things are under control.
[Back on the Mountain. Jimbo is telling stories.]
JIMBO
And then... Ned picked up the grenade and... BOOM, blasted his arm clear off. We spent three hours looking for that damn arm, but it was never to be found. Some say it's still crawling around to this day.
[Ned extends his prosthetic arm towards Cartman as if to show that shot-off arm is now at the campsite, climbing on Cartman.]
NED
Mmmowwwh.
[Cartman flinches, and the others laugh.]
JIMBO
Hah, got ya.
CARTMAN
Heh, tha-that's not scary.
KYLE
You were scared Cartman! you almost peed your pants!
CARTMAN
Shut up, I didn't pee in my pants!
JIMBO
Hey Ned, hand me that gin.
[Ned opens up the icebox and tosses a bottle to him.]
JIMBO
You boys want to tie one on?
KYLE
No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee.
STAN
Yeah, Cartman's pee.
CARTMAN
Hey, you would taste my pee!
JIMBO
What the hell's wrong with you? Can't you have a little alcohol?
[Kenny reaches for the gasoline can and chugs away.]
JIMBO
Christ, look at that little bastard go!
[Kenny hiccups.]
JIMBO
Now you see that Stan? Now, now that is a dirty little bastard!
STAN
Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too.
CARTMAN
Hey you guys. I know a scary story.
KYLE
Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody!
[Softly, slowly, flashlight ready.]
CARTMAN
Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of [He turns his flashlight on his face for dramatic effect.] Scuzzlebutt?
STAN
Whatabutt?
CARTMAN
Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top.
STAN
Why?
CARTMAN
Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.
KYLE
Deformed how?
CARTMAN
Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has...
STAN
A hook.
KYLE
A knife.
CARTMAN
No! A piece of celery.
STAN
Celery?
CARTMAN
Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but...Patrick Duffy.
KYLE
Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!
CARTMAN
What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step? [Silence.] So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tashink ...tashink ...tashink.
STAN
Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories.
KYLE
Yeah, give me that flashlight.
[Kyle takes it and turns it off.]
KENNY
(Hey, what's that?)
[The volcano rumbles again.]
KYLE
What is that?
STAN
Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.
CARTMAN
Hey, it might be!
KYLE
Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand.
[The others laugh.]
CARTMAN
Screw you guys! ...Go to Hell!
[Jimbo is now playing his guitar.]
JIMBO
Hey Ned, why don't you whip out the ol' cancer kazoo? Let's do a little song.
NED
Abumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
Uumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
Uumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
[Uncle Jimbo cries]
Mmmoh lord, Kumbayah.
Emsomeone's crying my lord, Kumbayah
Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah...
CARTMAN
They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of 'em tomorrow!
NED
...Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah.
Moh lord, Kumbayah.
[Next morning. A rooster crows.]
KYLE
Stan, Stan, wake up!
STAN
What, dude?
KYLE
I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.
STAN
Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?
KYLE
They're out fishing with Kenny.
STAN
With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?
KYLE
Well Stan, you want to know what I think?
STAN
What?
[Kyle farts, and is pleased with himself. Stan does nothing.]
[In the fishing boat.]
JIMBO
What a beautiful morning for fishing. There's one, there's a fish right there!
[He throws grenade, killing a fish.]
NED
Mmm, got it.
[Kenny throws a grenade, killing four fish.]
JIMBO
Great instincts boy.
[Stan runs to the side of the lake.]
STAN
Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing!
JIMBO
Who? The fat kid?
STAN
Yeah.
JIMBO
Ah hell, I guess we better go look for him. Ned, we got to cut it short. Fire out the 12-20!
[Ned fires the load and a massive amount of fish float to the surface. The boat lands a second later]
JIMBO
Well, I think that's about the limit for our fishing permit.
NED
[Rowing to shore.] Moh man it smells like dead fish here.
KENNY
(A little like a vagina.)
NED
Em-moh man, that is nasty.
JIMBO
Heh, I don't think I've ever seen a kid as cool as you Kenny. I'm making you... my honorary nephew.
KENNY
(Thanks.)
[Stan's head drops.]
[In front of city hall. The media is now present.]
NEWSCASTER
The people of South Park are humble and friendly. But now, a ticking time-bomb of hot lava waits to engulf these people and end their miserable lives with one last fleeting moment of excruciatingly painful burning agony.
CROWD
Yeahhh.
[They sound more excited than agonized.]
INDIVIDUAL IN CROWD
Hey, I'm on TV! I'm on TV!
NEWSCASTER
Mayor, what are you doing to prepare for this inevitable catastrophe?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
All we know right now is that some of our children [Sob-sob.] are camping on that mountain and... Oh, I'm sorry, can I start over?
NEWSCASTER
Huh?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Well you can edit this right? Ready, 3,2,1 [Melodramatically.] All we know right now is that some of our children are up camping on that mountain. We can't do anything until we get them. Okay people, let's go get those kids.
CHEF
Come on everybody. You got to help the children.
[On the mountain.]
JIMBO
Uh, well, he couldn't have gone far, unless something drug him off.
NED
There's not many animals out today, Jimbo, mmm.
JIMBO
Yeah, it's almost like something funny's going on.
[The volcano rumbles.]
JIMBO
Christ, Ned, what'd you have for breakfast.
NED
Mm I don't know man. I've got some bad gas.
JIMBO
Wait, there's a ram! It's coming right for us!
[Fires at the ram. Kenny takes over.]
JIMBO
Nice shootin' Kenny. Here, you need a bigger gun.
KYLE
Look!
CARTMAN
I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.
NED
Mmm, what is it?
KYLE
Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying.
JIMBO
Holy crow! We could make a mint killing this thing.
NED
We'll be on the cover of "Guns & Ammo".
JIMBO
This calls for some HJ-14.
CARTMAN
[To himself.] Heheh. Those guys are totally scared.
[Jimbo is now armed with twin shoulder rockets.]
JIMBO
Fire in the hoooole!
CARTMAN
Holy crap!
[Cartman jumps out of the way. The rockets hit the mound and debris goes in all directions.]
JIMBO
Damn it, I think I missed.
CARTMAN
What the hell is wrong with you people?!
JIMBO
C'mon, let's move, move!
[Cartman sees them coming and backs away.]
CARTMAN
Hey, wait, aah!
[Rescue Center.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Is, is it on? Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?!
RANDY
Mayor, I might have an uhh, idea.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Huh, what?
RANDY
Well if we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park pretty much completely.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
And, that would be good? Right?
RANDY
Uh - pretty sure.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Well, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels!
[On the mountain. Jimbo and the others have lost sight of Cartman.]
JIMBO
These look like its tracks. He must have gone this way. Ned, prepare some HK-12 and some plasticine. I'll bet that sucker's headed for a higher elevation. The higher up it- BIRD!! [Shoots a bald eagle.] The higher up it goes, the better it can breathe.
KYLE
[Sees Cartman still dressed as Scuzzlebutt] Look, up there.
CARTMAN
You guys, it's just me.
JIMBO
Are we sure it's Scuzzlebutt?
STAN
Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg?
JIMBO
I can't tell; let's kill it!
CARTMAN
Eh, gotta get out of this stupid costume.
JIMBO
Kenny, you take the front.
STAN
No!
[Stan takes the rifle from Kenny.]
STAN
I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!
JIMBO
That's the spirit, kiddo. Let's hunt!
CARTMAN
You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!
[Townspeople digging trench.]
NEWSCASTER
As some people of South Park try desperately to save their mountain town, others look for the missing townspeople. But all must take every precaution necessary.
[Rescue Center.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Okay people, listen up. As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please.
[Mr. Garrison starts the film.]
HOST
Harbingers of sorrow, natural disasters can be the cause of troubling and undesirable stress, and the volcano is no exception. But what should you do if a volcano erupts near you or your family? Here we see the Stevens family enjoying a [Film skips] May picnic, but suddenly daughter hears a noise. It's a volcano. Junior seems worried. But have no fear Junior, Jane learned in school what to do when you hear a volcano erupt.
[Jane backs up, pulls out the blanket from under the food, and throws it over her family.]
HOST
That's right Jane, duck and cover.
[She ducks under the blanket herself. The lava rolls over the family, causing no harm. The blanket flies off, revealing a sparkling family.]
HOST
So what will you [Film skips] -do when you hear a volcano erupting?
[Two boys on bikes look alarmed. They leap off their bikes and hit the street, duck, and cover their heads with their arms.]
HOST
That's right, duck and cover.
[The lava rolls over the two, causing no harm.]
HOST
Looks like you got the idea. Duck and cover. Thank you and goodbye.
OFFICER BARBRADY
OK, any questions?
CHEF
That has got to be the most ridiculous load of pig crap I have ever seen!
OFFICER BARBRADY
That's enough out of you!
[On the mountain. Cartman moves further up on the slope and turns around.]
STAN
I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.
CARTMAN
Hey, seriously you guys!
KYLE
[Hushed.] Kill it, Stan. Kill it. [Normally.] Come on Stan, kill it.
STAN
Ah, damn it, I can't do it!
[Jimbo swats Stan behind the head.]
JIMBO
You pansy! give me that gun.
CARTMAN
Hey!
STAN
Cartman?
CARTMAN
Goddammit, don't shoot me!
JIMBO
What the Sam Hell?
CARTMAN
I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now.
NED
Mmm, so much for the cover of "Guns & Ammo".
JIMBO
Yepper, but I think we've learned some important lessons Ned I think that-
[Boom! Lava begins to bubble out and flow.]
KYLE
Whoa!
NED
Mmm, holy crap.
JIMBO
The mountain! It's blown it's top!
[A boulder of lava lands in front of Kenny.]
KYLE
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
[Kenny steps out from behind the boulder.]
KENNY
(Nope, I'm okay.)
[Kenny sees his arm on fire.]
KENNY
(It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!)
[The boulder rolls onto Kenny.]
KENNY
(Ugh.)
[On the side of the mountain.]
TOWNSMAN 1
Look, the volcano.
TOWNSMAN 2
Quick, duck and cover.
[They do. The lava sweeps them down the mountainside, burning them to the bone.]
[At the base of the mountain, Jimbo and the others are moving quickly.]
KYLE, STAN, CARTMAN
Aaaaah!
JIMBO
That lava's coming right for us!!
[Behind them a river of lava charges down the mountain.]
[Looking on from the edge of town.]
CHEF
Oh no, look.
[At the trench. Jimbo and the others have made it out of the mountain, but their way into town has been cut off.]
JIMBO
What the hell is this trench doing here?!? We can't get across!
NEWSCASTER
It now looks as if the missing children are trapped in the path of hot, nasty lava.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
God, please deliver those darling kids from... Wait, wait wait wait. 3,2, and 1. God, please deliv-
CARTMAN
Help!
[Scuzzlebutt appears and scratches his belly.]
JIMBO
Jimminy Pope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt!
CARTMAN
What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
KYLE
Oh my God! Look at his leg!
PATRICK DUFFY
Hi kids, I'm TV's Patrick Duffy.
JIMBO
Quick Ned, shoot it!
[Ned aims, but no shot is heard.]
NED
Mmmoh no, out of ammo.
SCUZZLEBUTT
Grrrr.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
What... is that thing?
CHEF
That's Scuzzlebutt.
MR. GARRISON
Yeah, he has Patrick Duffy for a leg, and weaves baskets.
OFFICER BARBRADY
This isn't happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here.
JIMBO
Well boys, I'm sorry I got you all killed.
[Scuzzlebutt rips a tree from the ground, bites off a limb...]
KYLE
Aaaaah!
[...and molds the tree into a-]
STAN
Whoa, he built a wicker basket.
JIMBO
Hey, he's saving us.
[Scuzzlebutt puts the group in the basket and lifts them over the trench.]
SCUZZLEBUTT
Grrr.
LIANE
Scuzzlebutt saved the day.
RANDY
And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Hmmm. Where exactly does the canyon go?
RANDY
Uhh...
DENVER CITIZENS
Aaaaah.
[South Park. The ordeal is over.]
MR. GARRISON
South Park is saved.
[Cheers go up.]
KYLE
Hey look, Kenny's okay.
[Kenny appears on a mound nearby.]
KENNY
(Hey guys, what's goin' down?)
NEWSCASTER
And now these humble people can rejoice and celebrate their jovial victory over nature. I'm getting word that the chef of the school cafeteria wants to sing a song about this thrilling struggle of humanity.
CHEF
Mmmm
Baby every time that we kiss,
Hot Lava!
Every time that we make love, hot lava,
Hot Lava!
Lava so hot it makes me sweat,
Lava so warm and red and wet,
Lava!
Brrrrrrrrrrrr.
NEWSCASTER
Mayor, what do you have to say about this wonderful outcome?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Well, we owe everything to this friendly, yet misunderstood creature. Thank you Scuzzlebutt.
SCUZZLEBUTT
Friend.
[Scuzzlebutt presents flowers to the Mayor.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Oh, how sweet.
[Stan shoots scuzzlebutt.]
STAN
I did it, I did it, I finally killed something.
[He smiles, proud of himself. Unfortunately, this took place during a live report.]
NEWSCASTER
Oh my God! What has he done?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Turn off the cameras!
STAN
Hey, that was easy!
PATRICK DUFFY
Noooo! Why God? Why?!
JIMBO
Damn it Stan, you shouldn't have done that!
STAN
What?! Why?!
KYLE
Yeah, make up your mind, dude!
JIMBO
Stan, some things you kill, and some things you don't. See?
STAN
No.
NED
Moh, only now in this late hour do I see the folly of guns. Mmm, I'll never use a gun again, mmm.
[Drops his gun, which fires one last shot as it hits the snow. Kenny is hit.]
KENNY
(Oh, no!)
[Rats are hot on the trail.]
STAN
But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.
JIMBO
But Kenny's dead now, Stan, and you're always going to be my nephew. And you can't just kill anything. You understand?
KYLE
Dude, I don't understand hunting at all.
STAN
Yeah, [He drops his gun.] it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons.
CARTMAN
Yeah, cartoons kick ass! [All three leave.]
End of Volcano
