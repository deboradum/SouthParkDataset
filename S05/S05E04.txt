Scott Tenorman Must Die

[Morning in South Park. Cartman is riding his Big Wheels down the road, singing to himself. He soon reaches the bus stop. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are standing there]
CARTMAN
Doodoo doot doo, dadadadada daa, ya da dadaa
Doodoo doot doo, dadada daa,
heydy heydy heydy,
how's it goin', guys?
KYLE
What the hell are you so happy about, fatass? [Cartman gets off his bike]
CARTMAN
[coolly] Oh, nothing. No big deal, really.
STAN
What's no big deal?
CARTMAN
Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all.
KYLE
...What the hell are you talking about?
CARTMAN
Well, because, unlike you guys, I just got my first pubes! Ayada da daa, yadadadadee! [dances]
KENNY
(You got pubes??)
KYLE
What's "pubes"?
STAN
Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair.
KYLE
Oh. [to Cartman] No you didn't!
CARTMAN
Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man!
STAN
He's lying. [turns and walks away. Kenny follows, then Kyle]
CARTMAN
You wanna see 'em?
KYLE
[turns to look at them] Hell no! [Stan and Kenny turn to look]
CARTMAN
[reaches into his pants] Here, check 'em out.
STAN
[looks away and hides his eyes] We don't wanna see them, Cartman! [Kyle turns around, Kenny shuts his hood tight]
CARTMAN
There, see? How do you like them apples! [in his right hand is a clump of pubic hair. The other boys look, with Kyle ready to cover his eyes again] HA!
KYLE
[approaches] Uh, what are those? [Stan and Kenny follow]
CARTMAN
My pubes.
STAN
What??
CARTMAN
I got 'em from Scott Tenorman.
KYLE
Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader?
CARTMAN
Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten bucks. [sing-song] Ha ha ha! I got pubes 'fore you guys did! I got pubes 'fore youuu guys! Ahahahahahahaa ha! [dances a little more]
STAN
Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable.
CARTMAN
[moves in between Stan and Kyle and embraces them, one under each arm, and gloats. Kyle looks at Cartman's right hand] Don't be jealous, guys. [Kyle looks at Cartman] This doesn't mean we can't still hang out. [Kyle looks back at Cartman's hand] It just means that I matured faster than you. [Kyle fears for that hair touching him] You'll get your pubes guys, someday.
KYLE
Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!
CARTMAN
Uh oo what?
STAN
When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass!
CARTMAN
Nuh uh!
KYLE
Yuh huh!
CARTMAN
[looks at his purchase] But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars?
KYLE
Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!
CARTMAN
You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.
KYLE
Yeah.
CARTMAN
[walks off in a huff] Huh I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.
[A lavender house, day. Three teens sit on the front steps]
SCOTT
And so I told him, I said "Here. I'll sell you my pubes for only ten bucks." And this stupid asshole buys them! [the other two boys laugh]
ANOTHER BOY
Oh man! [Cartman makes his way up to the boys]
SCOTT
Speak of the devil! What do you want?
CARTMAN
Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please?
SCOTT
Uh uh, I don't take returns!
CARTMAN
Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you!
SCOTT
You would actually tell your mom that you were stupid enough to pay for my pubes? Huh uh, I don't think so!
CARTMAN
Just give me back my money...
SCOTT
Buyer beware, dude!
CARTMAN
Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!
SCOTT
Hehey, I said no! Now get your fat little butt out of here before I kick your head in! [defeated, Cartman walks away]
[Scott's house, later. Cartman rings the doorbell]
CARTMAN
[in costume, with briefcase] Hello, sir, my name is Kris
Kristofferson. I'm with the IRS. I'm here to collect ten dollars that you own in back taxes.
SCOTT
You're not from the IRS! You glued my pubes onto your face!
CARTMAN
[thinks a bit] Tax evasion is a very serious offense, sir! I suggest that you...
SCOTT
Alright alright. I'll trade you my pubes back for the money.
CARTMAN
You will? Oh, cool!
SCOTT
How much did I charge? Uh, oh yeah. Ten dollars. You got change for a twenty?
CARTMAN
Oh. Uh, lessee. [pulls out some money] I only got six dollars and twelve cents.
SCOTT
Oh. well... that's okay. Here. Just... give me the six dollars. [done.] And then I'll... give you the twenty.
CARTMAN
...Okay.
SCOTT
Now, give me the pubes, and I'll give you back two dollars.
CARTMAN
Right.
SCOTT
Now, give me the twelve cents, and I'll give you the rest of your change back.
CARTMAN
Cool.
SCOTT
And then give me the twenty, and I'll give you the pubes. [walks back in the house with his money back]
CARTMAN
Sweet! [the door closes] Uh. Oh, goddamnit!
[Bijou movie house, later. The boys are going to see a "BIG WAR MOVIE"]
CARTMAN
That asshole! That big, smelly, ass-sniffin' asshole! I'm gonna get him!
KYLE
Cartman, can I give you some advice?
CARTMAN
What?
KYLE
Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count your losses and move on. He's smarter than you.
CARTMAN
He is not smarter than me! He just charmed me, that's all! He's a charmer, that Scott Tenorman!! But I'll get him someday!! [the boys reach the box office and buy their tickets]
KYLE
One please.
STAN
One please.
KENNY
(One please.)
CARTMAN
One please. [with no money, he tries to pay with pubic hair. Nothing happens for a while]
RICK
That'll be six dollars.
CARTMAN
O-kay, and how much is that in pubes?
RICK
We don't take pubes!
CARTMAN
Listen, my money is as good as anybody's! Don't you, uh, discriminate against my people by not accepting these pubes.
RICK
We don't take pubes!! End of story!!
CARTMAN
Racist! [takes the pubes and runs off]
[Scott's house, later. Cartman rings the doorbell again]
CARTMAN
Scott, Scott! Courtney Love is in South Park! She's all drunk and spreading her legs and showing her poonanner to everybody! You gotta go check it out! I'll watch your house for ya!
SCOTT
Okay, I'll buy the pubes back! Here!
CARTMAN
[stunned] What?
SCOTT
Sixteen dollars! Take it! I-I'll even throw in an extra five! Here! Give me back my pubes!
CARTMAN
[softly] Wha-? Uh oo [audibly] why do you want then back so much?
SCOTT
No reason.
CARTMAN
I don't believe you.
SCOTT
Alright alright! The pube fair in Fort Collins.
CARTMAN
Pube fair?
SCOTT
They're paying five bucks a hair for pubes! If I leave now, I can catch the last bus!
CARTMAN
Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars!
SCOTT
Hehere, take your money!
CARTMAN
Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself!
SCOTT
Oh, you can't do this to me! Nooo!
CARTMAN
Haha, charade you are, Scott! [runs away quickly]
SCOTT
Have you no heart??
[Bus Terminal, day. Cartman stands in line waiting for a trip to Fort Collins. People are boarding the bus]
CARTMAN
[cuts through the line] Ahaaa, what a stupid asshole! Hahahahaha! [enters the bus]
[Bus, evening. The sun has already set and Cartman is still on the bus, en route to Fort Collins]
CARTMAN
Hohoho! I won a million dollars!! Whew! Ow!
[Fort Collins, night. Cartman gets off the bus and walks]
CARTMAN
Hahaaha! Ha. Ha. Heh. Huh, excuse me, sir.
MAN
Yes?
CARTMAN
Can you tell me where the pube fair is?
MAN
The pube fair?
CARTMAN
Yeah, I have some pubes to sell.
MAN
There's no such thing, you little smartass! [walks away]
CARTMAN
No- no such thing?
TEEN BOY
[approaches with a box] Hey, you wouldn't happen to be Eric Cart-man, would you?
CARTMAN
I'm Eric Cartman.
TEEN BOY
Well, I think this is for you. [hands it to Cartman and walks away. Cartman sets the box down and opens it. He looks in, and a look of shock is on his face. He reaches in and pulls out... more pubic hair]
CARTMAN
[screams] Aaah!!!
[Scott's house, night. Cartman rings the doorbell again, this time in the rain. Scott answers. Cartman is soaked with rain, his beanie wrinkling]
CARTMAN
A hundred and six miles, Scott. I had to ride a hundred and six miles in the back of a pickup truck... to get back here
SCOTT
You really went? What a 'tard.
CARTMAN
Alright, Scott, you win. I give up.
SCOTT
You do? Wow, you're not as stupid as I thought.
CARTMAN
Yeah, I'll see you around. [walks down the steps and towards the street, but stops] Sure is too bad about my grandma, though...
SCOTT
Your grandma?
CARTMAN
[turns around] Huh? Oh, it's... it's not really your concern, since uh-... well, my grandma's in the hospital. She's very sick. The doctors say unless I can come up with sixteen dollars for her operation, they're gonna put her down.
SCOTT
Oh. [strokes his chin] Jeez, I-... I didn't realize that.
CARTMAN
Yeah. Poor grandma...
SCOTT
Hey, kid... Hold on a second ah, ah, I'll get your money. [through the window, Scott is seen going for the money]
CARTMAN
[evilly, to himself] Heheheheheh. He's such a douche, heheheheheh. [turns around and returns to the house. Scott returns]
SCOTT
Here you go.
CARTMAN
Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Scott! [Scott withholds the money]
SCOTT
But... just one thing before I give it to you:
CARTMAN
What?
SCOTT
I just... well... I want you to beg for it.
CARTMAN
Huh?
SCOTT
Just... get down on your knees and- beg me for the money.
CARTMAN
Why??
SCOTT
Do you want your grandma to live or not?
CARTMAN
[looks around to make sure no one else is watching, then quickly] Please Scott give me my money.
SCOTT
No, no, get down on your knees. [Cartman begins to get on his knees] Lower your head [Cartman lowers it], and say "I beg you to give me back my money."
CARTMAN
I beg you to give me back my money.
SCOTT
Now say, "I'm a little piggy".
CARTMAN
What?
SCOTT
Say it!
CARTMAN
[looks around] I'm a little piggy.
SCOTT
[points to his nose] "Here's my snout."
CARTMAN
[points to his nose] Here's my snout.
SCOTT
"Oink oink oink."
CARTMAN
Oink oink oink.
SCOTT
Now dance, little piggy! Dance and oink for me!
CARTMAN
[looks back angrily for a few seconds, then]
I'm a little piggy; here's my snout.
Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.
[Scott begins to laugh]
I'm a little piggy; here's
- Aalrightalrightalright, now give me back my money!
SCOTT
You mean this? [Cartman brightens up] You really care that much about sixteen measly dollars? I mean, what can you buy with sixteen dollars? My parents give me a fifty dollar-a-week allowance. This pittance means nothing to me. Watch. [holds the bills out and strikes a lighter under them]
CARTMAN
What- What are you doing?? [the bills light up and burn from one end to the other. Scott lets the burning bills float away] No!... Wh-why?
SCOTT
Now you can't bug me for your dumb money! [turns around and enters the house, shutting the door behind him. Cartman then turns and walks towards the street anew. Halfway there, he looks at his mitts, then grows indignant]
CARTMAN
[yells at the sky] Yaaaarrgh! ...You'll diiiiiiiiiie! ...Damn youuuuuuuuuu!
[Cartman's house, cellar. The kids in class has been reunited for something important. They're chattering amongst themselves]
CARTMAN
[descending the stairs] Concerned citizens, I thank you for coming. [walks to the easel] I know that you are all deeply troubled and want to find a quick and painful way to get rid of Scott Tenorman once and for all! [Clyde raises his hand] Yes, Clyde!
CLYDE
Who's Scott Tenorman?
KIDS
Yeah.
KYLE
Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off.
CARTMAN
[correcting Kyle] Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge!
BUTTERS
Wuh what are you gonna do?
CARTMAN
Did you guys see that movie "Hannibal"? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony [flips the first page over to reveal a drawing of a pony and takes up the pointer with his left hand], we can train it. Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's wiener. [the other kids just stare back, but Cartman continues] It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!!
KYLE
What's in it for us?
CARTMAN
What?
STAN
Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?
CARTMAN
Oh, right. Why should we care? [slaps the pointer into his right hand] Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, "It's not your problem." But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, "You may take our pride, but you'll never take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!" [flips to the next page, which has written on it "$16.12" with double underline] Now who's with me? [turns around to find only Timmy in the basement]
TIMMY
Timmay!
CARTMAN
[slaps his forehead and sighs] Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy!
TIMMY
Euuh, livin' a lie, Timmih. [rolls out of the room. Cartman is stunned, then angry]
[A barn, day. Cartman stands next to a scarecrow. He pulls out a frank from a bag of wieners and places it in the scarecrow's crotch]
CARTMAN
There we go. [stands aside] Come and get it. [camera pulls back to reveal a pony nearby] ...Come on, pony, bite the wiener. Bite it. [the pony looks, then approaches] Come on, good pony. That's it! [the pony sniffs the wiener] Now, bite it off! Bite off the wiener! Good pony! [the pony bares its teeth... only to start licking the wiener] Oh no, pony, he'll like that.
JIMBO
[rushing up with Ned after eying Cartman in the corral] Eric! Are you training that pony to please you?
CARTMAN
No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off. [by this time, the pony is sucking on the wiener]
JIMBO
Oh. Well, does Mr. Denkins know you're usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers on sight, you know.
CARTMAN
He said it was okay.
JIMBO
Alright, then. [turns to walk away, but remembers something] Wait, why the hell are you trainin' Denkins' pony to bite off someone's penis?
CARTMAN
Because [ominously] of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!
JIMBO
Well, son, I think you have a pretty stupid plan there.
CARTMAN
[noticing the sucking] Not like that, pony! [slaps the wiener out of its mouth]
JIMBO
Look, if you wanna get revenge on somebody, you've gotta think like a hunter. [the pony reaches for the wiener and starts sucking it again]
CARTMAN
Whattayou mean?
JIMBO
Step 1: Find someone's weakness. Step 2: Exploit that weakness.
CARTMAN
How do I do that?
[Scott's house, night. Cartman appears in the bushes across the street. He pulls out binoculars and checks out the various rooms in the house. He sees Scott in his room, with Radiohead posters on his wall]
JIMBO
[pops up] What do you see? [Ned pops up. All three are in camouflage]
CARTMAN
I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!!
JIMBO
No, young hunter. I mean, what do you see? You must learn all you can about your kill.
CARTMAN
Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead!
JIMBO
Ooh, what's a Radiohead?
CARTMAN
You know, that band that sings that song: Well, I'm a creep. I'm a weirdo...
NED
Mmuh, what am I doing here?
JIMBO
Oh, Jesus, don't start singing, Ned!
CARTMAN
So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a [British accent] li'l ol' scheme [normal] that involves them.
JIMBO
Nice thinking, young hunter.
CARTMAN
Whoa!
JIMBO
What?
CARTMAN
I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra.
JIMBO
What?! Give me those! [rips the binoculars away and looks for himself] Holy crow, he's right, Ned! Mrs. Tenorman's lettin' the twins out!
NED
Mn let me see.
CARTMAN
Radiohead. Yes, of course. [drops down]
JIMBO
Dear God, they're bigger than I ever imagined!
NED
Let me see. Let me see.
JIMBO
Here you go. [allows Ned to look through the binoculars, and Ned begins to masturbate] Wow, those are great. Maybe I should go grab some beers, Ned. Ned, what- a-are you jackin' it?
NED
Kinda.
JIMBO
Well, stop it! [the porch light turns on and Mr. Tenorman walks out the front door. Jimbo and Ned freeze]
MR. TENORMAN
Hey, what the hell are you doing out there?
JIMBO
[hushed] Oh crap!
MR. TENORMAN
Who's out there?
JIMBO
[hushed] Ned, for Christ's sake, stop jackin'!
NED
I can't.
MR. TENORMAN
Don't think I don't see you! I know who you are and I'm calling the police! [Jimbo and Ned witness other men rise from the pushes and split. Among them are Randy, in a Groucho Marx outfit; Gerald, dressed as a clown; Stuart, with a paper shopping bag over his head; one man in scuba gear, and one more man]
A MAN
Whoa, I gotta get out of here! [Mr. Tenorman is left wondering why so many men were there.]
[Scott's house, the next day. Cartman returns yet again and rings the doorbell. Scott answers.]
CARTMAN
[cheerfully] Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all?
SCOTT
Uh huh.
CARTMAN
Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown. [gloats] Everyone's gonna be there!
SCOTT
Oh, cool. Um, thanks for tellin' me.
CARTMAN
You're welcome, Scott. [turns and walks away]
[Downtown South Park, night. Cartman stands on a small stage as a crowd gathers. On stage is a big-screen TV and tower speakers]
CARTMAN
Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we? [activates the screen and then walks off stage]
KURT LODER
Welcome back to MTV. We're here with the members from Radiohead, probably the hottest band in the world right now. [Cartman joins the crowd and stands next to Scott, his mood changing from happy to mad] Guys, when is the next album coming out?
CARTMAN
[has taped over the band's answers with his own — first as Thom Yorke] That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid. [now as Johnny Greenwood] Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too. [Now as Ed O'Brien] I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?
CARTMAN
Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott? [Scott looks down, and ponders Cartman's role]
KURT LODER
And will there be a new tour?
CARTMAN
[Now as Phil Selway] Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that we don't want to. [Now as Thom Yorke] Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's not cool!
CARTMAN
Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott. [Scott is gone] Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA! [feedback is heard] What a retard! [the kids around him face right] And now everyone saw it! [looks around]
SCOTT
[off screen] Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's time for the amazing Pube Boy! [moves aside to show an ever bigger TV, which is turned on. Scott has apparently filmed Cartman earlier begging for his money]
CARTMAN
[on screen] '"I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink."' [the kids begin to laugh hard, then harder. The same clip is shown over and over, and Kenny begins to laugh. Soon he can't control himself, and falls over dead. His ghost appears and continues laughing]
STAN
[looks over at Kenny's corpse] Oh my God, he killed Kenny.
CARTMAN
[seething with anger] That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!!
[That night, dark and stormy, appropriate for Cartman's mood at the moment, Cartman's house. A boy possessed, he's in his room devising a new plan. An evil look comes across his face]
CARTMAN
Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!! [goes into whispers and brings out a protractor and a compass] Then... that... [finishes his plan] Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman is going to wish he never met meee!!! [a truly evil grin appears on his face.]
[Mr. Denkins' farm, next day. Cartman is back at the corral waiting for his friends. Stan and Kyle walk up.]
KYLE
Okay, Cartman, what do you want?
CARTMAN
Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!
STAN
Got what all figured out?
CARTMAN
How to get Scott Tenorman back!
KYLE
[rolls his eyes] Oh, Jesus!
CARTMAN
I just finished planning a brilliant [British accent] li'l scheme [normal] that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars. [holds out two fingers]
KYLE
Okay, so what's the plan?
CARTMAN
It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right?
STAN
Yeah.
CARTMAN
So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — and — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony! [camera pulls back to reveal the setup: pony, scarecrow with wiener attached to groin]
KYLE
...What?
CARTMAN
Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!! [laughs demonically] Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!! [nothing happens for a few seconds]
KYLE
You're such a dumbass, Cartman. [he and Stan turn and walk away]
CARTMAN
...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!! [walks over to the pony] Ready, pony? [the pony nods] Bite it! [the pony bites off a piece of the wiener] Yes!! [exults]
[London Recording Studio, day. Inside, Radiohead prepares to record. One of them is on the floor reading fan mail]
JOHNNY
Thom, will you stop reading fan mail? We have work to do.
THOM
Just a second, fellas. Listen to this:
Dear Radiohead, My name is Eric Cartman. I'm a young, supple eight-year-old boy from South Park, Colorado. I am writing to you because of a kid I know named Scott Tenorman. Scott is fifteen, and I'm afraid he has cancer. In his ass. Radiohead is his favorite band, and it would make his short life if you could find it in your hearts to visit him before he dies alone and scared. Won't you please consider it? I don't think he'll make it past... next Tuesday around 5.
PHIL
Wow, we have to go.
ED
To Colorado? But we have an album to mix.
THOM
Didn't you hear the letter?? This poor kid has cancer! In his ass!
[Scott's house, day. A phone rings. Scott answers it in the living room.]
SCOTT
Hello?
KYLE
[voice at other end] Scott Tenorman?
SCOTT
What do you want?
KYLE
We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is going' to try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch.
SCOTT
How do you know?
KYLE
'Cause, we're his friends.
SCOTT
Then why are you telling me?
KYLE
'Cause we hate him.
SCOTT
Oh.
KYLE
Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya.
SCOTT
See ya. [the doorbell rings. Scott walks over to open the door]
[At the front door]
CARTMAN
[with tickets in hand] Hello, Scott!
SCOTT
Hey.
CARTMAN
I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides. [shows him the face of the ticket] Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!
SCOTT
Ooo, a chili carnival, huh? That sounds great.
CARTMAN
[getting smug] Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott. Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride!
SCOTT
Wow, a pony ride. Neat.
CARTMAN
Oh, it will be very neat, Scott.
SCOTT
Gosh. Chili, rides, and ponies? What more could I want?
CARTMAN
[under his breath] A little penis-biting, perhaps?
SCOTT
What?
CARTMAN
Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott?
SCOTT
How can I turn it down?
CARTMAN
Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott. [Scott turns around and closes the door] Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very good. [leaves]
[back in the living room]
SCOTT
Mom, Dad, that was my good friend Eric at the door? He told me that there's a starving pony at Denkins' ranch that's been abandoned.
MRS. TENORMAN
Oh dear.
SCOTT
Yeah, I feel really bad. But I don't know how I can help it, because I have a lot of homework to do.
MR. TENORMAN
[drops his paper. Both parents rise] Well, don't you worry, Scott. Your mom and I can go get the pony and have it taken to an animal shelter.
MRS. TENORMAN
We sure can.
SCOTT
Wow, would you really? I feel so much better now.
MRS. TENORMAN
[hugs him] Oh, Scott, you're such a loving, caring boy. I'm so proud of you.
SCOTT
I'm proud of you, too, Mom.
MRS. TENORMAN
Let's go, hon. [heads for the door]
MR. TENORMAN
Let's. [follows her out]
[In the kitchen. Scott is cooking up something... his friends arrive]
BUDDY 1
What are you doing, Scott?
SCOTT
What's it look like? I'm making chili. Did you bring the goods?
BUDDY 2
[holds out a bag full of hair] We got everyone we could find to chip in. [his friend giggles] There are pubes from just about every single kid in town.
SCOTT
Awesome! [yanks the bag away, opens it, and mixes the pubes into the chili]
BUDDY 1
Oh, dude!
SCOTT
The little fat kid thinks he's gonna get revenge tomorrow. We'll see how he likes it when I tell him he just ate the pubes of every kid in town!
BUDDY 2
Yeah! [hi-fives Scott, and the three laugh heartily]
[South Park, next day. The Chili Con Carnival is in full swing. People have already arrived. Stan and Kyle walk up]
CARTMAN
[steps out of the ticket booth to greet them] Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!
STAN
This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman.
CARTMAN
[smug] Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks!
KYLE
Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this. [looks at Stan, who's smiling]
CARTMAN
What's so funny?
STAN
Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet?
CARTMAN
Not yet, but they will be.
KYLE
Yeah, sure. [As Chef arrives, Stan and Kyle leave]
CHEF
Hello, Eric!
CARTMAN
Hey, Chef.
CHEF
I made some chili to enter into the contest.
CARTMAN
What contest?
CHEF
This is a chili cook-off, ain't it?
CARTMAN
Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here.
CHEF
It's my special recipe.
CARTMAN
[seeing Scott, interrupts. Slowly and sweetly] Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming! [Scott holds a small container of chili]
SCOTT
Oh, I wouldn't miss this for anything.
CARTMAN
[overjoyed] Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony!
SCOTT
Just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first?
CARTMAN
Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.
SCOTT
Well I don't want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize.
CARTMAN
[sighs silently] Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first. [Scott leaves] Goddamnit!
[Cartman's house, the judging table. Cartman and Scott take their seats. Behind Scott stand Butters, Kyle, Stan, and Scott's friends. Behind Cartman stand Bebe, Clyde, and Tolkien]
SCOTT
[setting his plate before Cartman] Alright, I guess we should taste each other's chili, huh?
CARTMAN
[inspecting the dish] Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine. [hands his plate to Scott, who takes it to his end of the table and starts eating]
SCOTT
Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it.
CARTMAN
Alright. [takes the dish and starts eating. Both boys munch away for a few moments] Hey, this is great! [Stan and Kyle stifle giggles]
SCOTT
Eh, it's a special recipe.
CARTMAN
[begins to wolf down the food] Gawh, this is really good, Scott!
SCOTT
I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have some'in' to tell you.
CARTMAN
What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? [Everyone at Scott's end of the table is shocked, even Scott, at this accusation]
SCOTT
What?!
CARTMAN
Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's. [Chef looks like he's been used] It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap. [Stan and Kyle are stunned] I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area. [A shot of Cartman telling Denkins of such a thing. Denkins is armed] I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents. [A shot of Scott talking with his parents] And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents. [The Tenormans are in the corral to rescue the "starving" pony, but upon seeing Mr. Tenorman's lit flashlight, Mr. Denkins fires at them, and they go down]
MR. DENKINS
[looks of horror surround him] Well, they was trespassin' and I was protectin' myself. I, I have my rights.
SCOTT
My... mom and dad are... dead? [A shot of Officer Barbrady taking a report from Denkins]
CARTMAN
I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies... [A shot of Cartman arriving, seeing Denkins and Barbrady, and pulling the bodies away. The pony munches at some grass] After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili. [more faces of horror behnd Cartman] Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott? [A gleefully evil look comes over Cartman] I call it, "Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili."
SCOTT
[looks at Cartman for a while, realizing what's just happened] Oh my God! [gagging, he fishes through the plate and finds his mom's wedding ring, still on her finger. He tosses it away] Oh my God!! [vomits off to the side]
CARTMAN
[leaping up on the table and sings] Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! [Stan and Kyle are way stunned]
STAN
Jesus Christ, dude!
SCOTT
[grief-stricken, he buries his face on the table] My mom and dad are dead! [pounds the table] No! NOOO!! [Radiohead arrives and stands behind Scott. Stan notices]
THOM
Uhm, excuse me?
STAN
Who are you?
JOHNNY
We're that band, Radiohead.
SCOTT
[raises his head] Jesus!
ED
Jeez, what a li'l crybaby!
COLIN
Are you gonna cry all day, crybaby??
THOM
You know, everyone has problems; it doesn't mean you have to be a little crybaby about it.
ED
Come on, guys, let's go. This kid is totally not cool. [the members of the band start leaving]
THOM
Yeah, that's the most uncool kid I've ever met.
PHIL
Little crybaby!
SCOTT
[gathers himself and looks] No, wait! Waaiittt!! Oh my God, Oh my Gaawwwd!! [buries his face in the table and bawls again] Noooo!
CARTMAN
[walks over to Scott's end of the table] Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott! [starts licking Scott's tears off his face] Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet.
KYLE
Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again.
STAN
Good call.
CARTMAN
Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-yummy. [licks the tears off the table and off Scott's face.] Mm-yummy you guys! [the iris common to Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons appears, with fanfare] Yuppitibut, that's all, folks! [waves]
End of Scott Tenorman Must Die
