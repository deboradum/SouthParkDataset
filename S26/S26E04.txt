BEBE
You guys! You guys, oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!
RED
What is it?
NELLY
What happened, Bebe?
BEBE
Clyde just sent me another text.
[The girls awe at Bebe, who is turning around and showing them her phone screen. Wendy frowns.]
NICHOLE
Oh, what's this one say?
BEBE
I texted him if he thought about me all the time, and he texted back 'it certainly seems like all the time. It's hard to get someone like you out of my mind'.
NICHOLE, BETSY, NELLY AND RED
Aww!
BEBE
Doesn't he just send the best texts ever?
[The girls agree with Bebe. The scene cuts to Wendy, who frowns over at Bebe and the girls, and then it cuts back to them.]
BEBE
Yesterday I texted him 'how do you know you're in love with me?' And he said 'I know I'm in love with you because spending time with you makes me feel like I'm home, and I can't imagine life without you'.
RED
That's so sweet!
WENDY
Clyde wrote that?
[Bebe turns away, speaking into her phone. The other girls watch with smiles on their faces.]
BEBE
O.M.G, Clyde, do you really care about me that much?
[The scene cuts to Red and Wendy.]
RED
Does Stan ever talk to you like that, Wendy?
WENDY
No... every time I send Stan a text he just responds with a thumbs-up emoji.
[The scene cuts back to all the girls.]
BEBE
Yeah, well, Clyde's just really into me. Oh, he's texting back.
[The scene cuts to Bebe's phone screen, displaying texts between her and Clyde.]
BEBE
'Yes. I do care about you that much. You mean a lot to me and I care deeply about you'.
NICHOLE, BETSY AND RED
Aww!
BETSY
He sure is in love with you, Bebe!
RED
He's a goddamn dreamboat!
BEBE
Yeah, well, Clyde's just really into me. Oh, he's texting back.
[The girls walk away. Wendy stays. She takes out her phone and goes back over her and Stan's texts. Wendy scrolls down, seeing Stan respond with all of her texts with a thumbs-up emoji. She speaks into her phone.]
WENDY
Hey, Stan... Is there a time we could talk today? I'm feeling a little insecure about some things...
[The scene cuts back to Wendy's phone screen. Stan is typing but ultimately responds with a thumbs-up emoji. It cuts back to Wendy, who stares at her phone with a sad expression. The scene cuts to the locker hallway of South Park Elementary, students walk and talk amongst each other. The scene cuts to Clyde, placing textbooks into his locker, Stan walks into frame.]
STAN
Hey, Clyde, can I talk to you?
CLYDE
Sure, bro.
STAN
Well, um, Wendy just came up to me and was acting all hurt 'cause she thinks I don't care about her.
[Clyde shuts his locker, and turns to Stan.]
CLYDE
Uh-huh.
STAN
Well, she says that she wishes I would reply to her texts the way that Clyde responds to Bebe so, like, how do you do it?
[Clyde looks around suspiciously, and moves his hand by his mouth to whisper to Stan.]
CLYDE
Chat GPT, dude.
STAN
Chat GPT?
[Clyde places his arm around Stan, they begin walking a few steps, before Clyde takes out his phone.]
CLYDE
Yeah, dude. There's a bunch of apps and programs you could subscribe to that use open AI to do all your writing for you. People use 'em to write poems, write job applications, but what they're really good for... is dealing with chicks. Here, check it out. There's tons of Chat GPT apps for your phone.
[The scene cuts to show Clyde's phone screen, displaying his messages with Bebe. He swipes to the home screen, clicks the Chat GPT app, and then returns to his and Bebe's texts.]
CLYDE
So, then I can take whatever latest dumb thing Bebe texted me, I copy it, then I open the GPT app, click 'respond to', paste her text here, hit 'write'. It just thinks for a second. 'You would look great with any length of hair! Trying a new look could be fun'. Copy that into messages and send it off. It's super easy and convenient and it saves me a ton of time because she texts me so goddamn much.
[Clyde's phone buzzes. The screen cuts back to the phone screen.]
CLYDE
Jesus Christ! 'I probably won't do it, but thanks for being supportive'. Cut. Paste. Write. Cut. Messages. Paste. Send. There.
[The screen cuts back to Clyde and Stan. Clyde wipes his hands together.]
CLYDE
All done with her stupid shit.
STAN
This is a real app?
CLYDE
It'll completely change your life, bro. Just, uh, just don't tell anybody, huh? If Bebe found out, I'd be a dead man.
[Clyde walks away smiling. The screen cuts to Tegridy Farms, then to Stan in his room, at his desk. He takes out his phone, looking through his and Wendy's texts. There are more messages, and a new one. Stan contemplates. He follows Clyde's instructions, and copies the text and pastes it into the Chat GPT app. The scene cuts to Wendy and her parents at the dinner table. Wendy is playing with her food, looking sad. She grabs her phone and sees a new text from Stan. She reads the text, shocked. She smiles and holds the phone close, then gets off of her chair and begins spinning around. The scene cuts to Wendy on her bed, smiling widely at her phone and texting Stan back. The scene cuts to Stan sitting on the toilet. He grabs his phone, and repeats the steps. He puts it back on the sink. The scene cuts back to Wendy, smiling as she stares at her phone. She spins around, standing on her bed. The scene cuts to the South Park Elementary playground, Wendy is sitting at the merry-go-round with Nichole and Red at her side. She talks, showing both girls her phone. The scene cuts back to the family dinner table. Wendy's parents look at her, and then at each other. Wendy is still smiling at her phone. The scene cuts to Stan on the couch, playing video games. His phone buzzes, and he picks it up, repeating the steps. It cuts to Wendy, who pats her chest with a fond look before texting back. The scene cuts to the park basketball area, Kenny, Kyle, Stan and Tolkien are playing basketball. As Stan grabs the ball, his phone buzzes, and he repeats the steps. The scene cuts to Wendy walking through a meadow, staring happily at her phone. The screen cuts to Stan resting on a loungechair behind the barn in Tegridy Farms. He holds his phone, and with his eyes closed, repeats the steps. The scene cuts to Wendy in her bedroom, sitting at her window, on her phone. The scene cuts back to Stan on the couch, playing video games. His phone rings, and he looks surprised. He picks up. The scene cuts continuously between the two.]
STAN
Hello?
WENDY
Hey, Stan, I didn't get it yet.
STAN
Didn't get what?
WENDY
You asked me if I wanted a bedtime story about frogs, or a song about swans. I said a bedtime story!
STAN
Oh, yeah, I- I wrote it. I'll send it to you right now.
WENDY
Okay, bye!
[The scene cuts back to Stan. He opens the Chat GPT app, and types in 'write a nice bedtime story about frogs'. The app instantly responds. The scene cuts back to Wendy, lying in bed, reading the story. She hugs her phone close, and closes her eyes. The scene cuts back to South Park Elementary, then the classroom, where students are chatting and getting into their seats. Mr Garrison walks into frame after them.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, let's take our seats. I've graded your midterm essays, and I have to say for the most part, they were terrible. However, there are some essays that I'm very happy with.
[Mr. Garrison begins handing out papers.]
MR. GARRISON
There was a really great essay from Clyde on the '1840s Labor Unions and Their Effect on the Industrial Revolution'. Let's hear it for Clyde, kids! Great work, Clyde.
CLYDE
Thank you. Thank you.
[The class applauses. Stan stares at Clyde, sitting at a desk by his side. He crosses his arms, looking suspisciously.]
STAN
Uh-huh.
CLYDE
What?
[The scene cuts back to Mr. Garrison.]
MR. GARRISON
Someone who never writes good essays, Butters, wrote an amazing piece on 'Post-Cold War Poland and the Changing Provision of Security'. Check plus, Butters!
BUTTERS
Oh, uh... thanks.
[The scene cuts to Stan looking behind his desk, at Butters. He turns and stares suspiciously. Butters, forcing a smile, waves back. Stan turns.]
MR. GARRISON
And we also have another student who wrote a shockingly good paper. This one's called 'A Feminist Neoliberal Perspective of Post-War Afghanistan'... by Eric Cartman!
CARTMAN
Ah, yes, thank you, thank you.
[The scene cuts to Stan staring at Cartman, beside him, suspiciously. Cartman side-eyes him.]
MR. GARRISON
And this week, we have a new student to the check plus club, for an amazing essay called 'Writing a Policy About Improving the Rights of Migrant Workers'. Let's hear it for Stan!
[The class applauses, Stan forces a smile. At his side, Cartman stares suspiciously. Stan turns, and returns the look. The scene cuts to Cartman, Clyde, Butters and Stan walking into the boys' bathroom.]
CARTMAN
Alright, what the hell is going on?
STAN
You tell me what's going on!
CARTMAN
Clearly, somebody told Stan about Chat GPT!
STAN
You guys are using it to write essays, too!
CARTMAN
Yes, we are all using it, and we had a pact that we wouldn't tell anyone else because then everyone will start using it, and Mr. Garrison will figure it out! So who the [bleep] blabbed to Stan?
CLYDE
I just told Stan about it as a tool to text his girlfriend.
CARTMAN
God damn it, Clyde! You don't use an amazing AI cheating tool to talk to girls! You're gonna ruin everything! This can't be open source, you guys! If everyone starts using Chat GPT, then we lose our unfair advantage.
[A student barges into the bathroom. He walks past the boys, and walks towards one of the urinals. The boys stay silent. The students starts peeing. He sniffs, grunts and farts. The boys continue to stay silent. Once the student is done, he flushes the urinal, and goes to the sink to wash his hands.]
CARTMAN
Oh, god-[bleep]-damn it.
[The student grabs a paper towel, and turns to stare at the boys. He smashes the paper towel into a ball, wipes his hands, and throws it in the trash, still staring. After a second, he leaves.]
CARTMAN
If they find out that we don't have to work anymore, then they aren't gonna want to work and then we're all screwed! Who's the one who first found Chat GPT and thought to use it for essays?
CLYDE
Butters.
CARTMAN
Right. But then Butters told me about it, and I told him not to tell anyone else!
BUTTERS
Right, but then you went and blabbed about it to Clyde.
CARTMAN
That's right. I was a little excited.
STAN
You guys, I'm not going to tell anyone else! You really think I want Wendy finding out about this thing?
CARTMAN
Fine. So we're all in it together. But you guys need to be careful what you use it for. Because once you bring girls into things, they're gonna ruin it. Just like slavery.
[The scene cuts to Mr. Garrison's residence, where he lives with his boyfriend, Rick. Garrison is at the table, grading papers. In the background, Rick is cutting up food.]
MR. GARRISON
Ugh... ugh, God, I can't take it, Rick!
RICK
What's the matter?
MR. GARRISON
Oh, it's just grading these stupid papers all the time! I have to read 'em all and comment on each one of them. Jesus Christ. Something's changed, and now a few of the kids are writing these really long, detailed essays. I don't know what's going on. I guess I've just taught them really well, maybe a bit too well.
RICK
Uh, yeah... Have you ever heard of Chat GPT?
MR. GARRISON
Chat GP-whoza what? The [bleep] is that?
RICK
There's a few apps now, really. But see? It has AI and takes any subject matter and can instantly give you whatever kind of content you want.
MR. GARRISON
Wait a minute... There's an app that anyone can use that does all the thinking and writing for you?
RICK
Yeah.
MR. GARRISON
Well, this is gonna be amazing! I can use it to grade all my papers, and no one will ever know!
RICK
Uh, yeah, sure.
MR. GARRISON
I'll just type the title of the essay in, and it'll generate a comment, and I don't even have to read the stupid things!
RICK
Yeah, and then you'll have more free time.
MR. GARRISON
Oh, this is great. Thanks so much! Just gotta make sure nobody finds out I'm being sneaky. Oh, and- and, hey, Rick?
RICK
Yeah?
MR. GARRISON
Thanks for all the replies to my texts today. They were really supportive.
RICK
Oh. Yeah. Sure thing.
[The scene cuts to Mr. Garrison's residence, where he lives with his boyfriend, Rick. Garrison is at the table, grading papers. In the background, Rick is cutting up food.]
MR. GARRISON
Ugh... ugh, God, I can't take it, Rick!

[The scene cuts to Willy's Chilly Ice Cream Parlor. Inside, Stan and Wendy are sitting in a booth, eating ice cream. The scene cuts continuously between the two.]
WENDY
This place is good, right?
STAN
Yeah, it's really good.
WENDY
Well, I know it's not much, but I just wanted to take you out somewhere to say thanks, Stan.
STAN
For what?
WENDY
For stepping up and working on communication when I asked you to.
STAN
Oh, that's cool.
WENDY
The things we've talked about, Stan, it's really helping me. I don't feel so alone and misunderstood. I've been so scared for so long to tell anyone what happened to me when I was six.
STAN
Yeah.
WENDY
(Starts tearing up) And... everything you had to say about it was just right. It really changed the way I think about the whole thing.
STAN
Yeah.
WENDY
And when you said the same thing happened to you, I- I couldn't believe it. Were you at home when it happened?
STAN
Yep.
WENDY
But you're right. We can't dwell on those things. You're right about a lot of stuff. There was just that one thing I don't understand... about the boating accident in Switzerland?
STAN
The boating accident in Switzerland... was tough.
WENDY
I thought you said it was great.
STAN
It was great... and very tough.
WENDY
(Blinks back tears) But how did it cause the thing with your cousin?
STAN
Oh, shit. What time is it?
WENDY
It's a little after four.
STAN
Oh, shit. My mom told me to be home right at a little after four. Sorry, Wendy. I- I gotta get going.
WENDY
No, no, no, that's totally okay. I gotta get going, too.
STAN
Okay, cool.
[Wendy shuffles over, and hugs Stan. He is shocked.]
WENDY
Thank you so much, Stan. Thank you for being the only real thing in my life.
[Wendy waves at Stan and leaves.]
STAN
Shit.
[The scene cuts to South Park Elementary, fourth grade classroom. The students sit at their desks, presenting their poetry. Clyde is standing at the front. Mr. Garrison is leaning back at his desk, feet up with headphones in.]
CLYDE
'Oh, Bebe, your name is like a song. A melody stuck in my head so long'.
[The scene cuts to Bebe, who is holding her head and watching Clyde fondly, it cuts back to Clyde.]
CLYDE
'I can't help but smile when I hear it said... Bebe, the name always in my head'.
CARTMAN
Oh, God, so obvious.
CLYDE
'I dream of spending my days with you, Bebe'.
[The scene cuts to Wendy and Stan. Stan is staring down at his desk, Wendy looks over with a smile. Stan looks back, forcing a smile. It cuts back to Clyde.]
CLYDE
'In South Park, or anywhere that maybay. Talking, laughing, just being together. In a dream I hope will last forever'.
[The scene cuts to Mr. Mackey walking in, he knocks on the door to alert Mr. Garrison and get his attention.]
MR. MACKEY
Excuse me, Mr. Garrison? Mr. Garrison?
MR. GARRISON
Oh, yeah. What?
MR. MACKEY
I'm sorry, but I need to address your class really quick.
MR. GARRISON
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. Go ahead.
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, kids, I need to discuss a very serious matter. There is a rumor going around that someone at this school is using OpenAI technology to do their work.
[The scene cuts to Stan looking at Cartman, Cartman then looks at Stan, then Butters]
MR. GARRISON
Well, that's crazy! Who would do that?
MR. MACKEY
Now, I know that everyone at this school is honest, hard-working, m'kay, wouldn't...Wouldn't even want to use this "ChatGBD".
BUTTERS
ChatGPT!
MR. MACKEY
Oh, m'kay. But the school board has decided to call in a company that can detect AI in schoolwork and make sure nobody here is cheating.
CARTMAN
They...They are gonna what?
MR. MACKEY
So we're just gonna collect all the school work that we can.
[Mr. Mackey collects all the assignments]
MR. GARRISON
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
MR. MACKEY
And we're gonna have them analyzed for any AI contributions, m'kay?
MR. GARRISON
Well, those are...Those aren't, uh, quite ready.
MR. MACKEY
Don't worry, we'll get these all back to you after the testers look through them. M'kay, kids, sorry for the intrusion. Get back to your day, m'kay?
[The scene cuts to Cartman, Clyde, Butters and Stan walking into the boys' bathroom again.]
CARTMAN
God fucking dammit! I told you guys this was gonna happen!
BUTTERS
What are we gonna do?!
CARTMAN
There's nothing we can do. It's over, we've lost our unfair advantage.
STAN
That's not what's important. If they find out I've been using OpenAI for class, Wendy's gonna know I've been using it with her, and It's gonna crush her!
CLYDE
Dude, same, Bebe's gonna fucking kill me!
CARTMAN
And who's fault is that, you guys? I told you that once you bring women into things, they ruin it just like they did slavery.
BUTTERS
Okay, Eric, could you explain exactly how women ruined slavery?
CARTMAN
No, I can't! Because I can't use fucking ChatGPT anymore 'cause we got fucking busted!
STAN
Look, maybe...Maybe this AI-detection technology won't work.
CARTMAN
It doesn't matter if it doesn't work. Cat is out of the bag now! This was supposed to be our thing, for us to get ahead, but now-
[A student barges into the bathroom again. He walks past the boys.]
CARTMAN
God dammit, Get the fuck out of here!
[The student leaves the bathroom.]
[Mr. Mackey's Office.]
MR. MACKEY
um kay I am just a little confused. you think we shouldn't have the kids school work analyzed for using AI writing app?
[scene cuts to Mr. Garrison]
MR. GARRISON
Look, it’s just. It’s really unfair to the kids. I mean what are we saying that we don’t trust them? I mean geeze
[scene goes back to Mr. Mackey]
MR. MACKEY
But don’t you think if kids are not writing their own papers we should know?
[scene goes back to Mr. Garrison]
MR. GARRISON
Oh what are people afraid of? That AI is going to replace real writers, That Hollywood is going to become a bland recycling of old ideas it already is. AI might help it.
[scene goes back to Mr. Mackey]
MR. MACKEY
Well I don’t know what you want me to
[scene Mr. Mackey desk phone beeps and Mr. Mackey answers it]
MR. MACKEY
Yes?
SECRETARY
Mr. Mackey the technician from the school advisory board just pulled in to the parking lot.
[scene cuts to the school lobby.
the front door opens and the School Advisory Board Technician enters with his bird.]
SCHOOL ADVISORY BOARD TECHNICIAN
Someone here using AI technology to do their classwork? If there is ChatGPT being used here I will find it. Shadow Bain fly.
[The bird fly’s and grabs a student’s paper and gives it to School Advisory Board Technician. Then the technician puts confetti on the paper and blows it off then rings 2 bells on the paper. The scene cuts to Mr. Mackey and Mr. Garrison]
MR. MACKEY
Hello I am the councillor here at South Park Elementary. This is one of our teachers Mr. Garrison.
SCHOOL ADVISORY BOARD TECHNICIAN
Hi, I been hired by the Park County school board to determine if any students are using generative AI technology to do their work.
MR. MACKEY
Yes we excited to work with you. We have a lot of great students here.
[School Advisory Board Technician walks further in the school]
SCHOOL ADVISORY BOARD TECHNICIAN
Come Shadow Bain let us find this ChatGPT using cheater.
[scene cuts too 4th grade class room Mr. Garrison is sitting alone at his desk.]
MR. GARRISON
I am going to get fired that it.
[Stan walk in the class room.]
STAN
Mr. Garrison can I talk to you?
MR. GARRISON
Uh is it important Stan I am kind of dealing with some stuff right now?
STAN
Yes it is important. You know when you done something wrong sometimes the best thing to do is to come out and admit it.
MR. GARRISON
uh. OK. OK you’re right. How did you find out?
STAN
Clyde told me about it. I came to you because if they find out something me and you punish me it’s going to really hurt Wendy.
MR. GARRISON
I don’t want to punish anyone Stan. I completely understand.
STAN
You do?
MR. GARRISON
Sure. I think most of the world does. I mean why does it matter who uses AI apps it’s just like having a good writers assistant.
STAN
Yeah. Like a good writers assistant.
MR. GARRISON
Yeah. I mean you are still taking the time to like push the buttons and stuff.
STAN
Yeah. So you really don’t think Wendy will be upset that I used ChatGPT to respond to her texts?
MR. GARRISON
Hold on? People can use it to respond to other people’s text?
[scene cuts too Mr. Garrison’s house where Rick is baking so goods then it cuts back to the 4th grade classroom.]
MR. GARRISON
Rick that lying piece of shit.
STAN
So you were just saying it was understandable….
MR. GARRISON
No this is totally different who ever uses it for messages is a fucking launder….
[scene cuts to the hallway where fireworks sound are heard students are running and screaming.]
MR. MACKEY
um OK everyone please just stay calm.
BOBBY PALMER
they got him. They found the kid that been using the AI app.
[scene cuts to the doors of the library where the students and the School Advisory Board Technician have gathered.]
SCHOOL ADVISORY BOARD TECHNICIAN
Get back. Get back all of you I have the student isolated inside.
MR. MACKEY
What exactly have you found .
SCHOOL ADVISORY BOARD TECHNICIAN
We went throw thousands of papers but then Shadow Bain detected chat bot writing in this student phone (pulls out a phone). (Shadow Bain start attacking the phone) There you see she’s going crazy.
[Stan Oh no then he runs to the library door and peeks in and sees Wendy.]
WENDY
What is going on?
STAN
Oh god o no no the GPT stuff on her phone didn’t come from her.
SCHOOL ADVISORY BOARD TECHNICIAN
Keep all the children back Mackey. We can’t let it spread I will go inside and get her confession.
[School Advisory Board Technician enters the library and locks the door behind him and approaches Wendy and rings some bells around her as Shadow Bain comes.]
SCHOOL ADVISORY BOARD TECHNICIAN
you have been cheating on your school work.
WENDY
No I haven’t.
SCHOOL ADVISORY BOARD TECHNICIAN
Silence. You have used ChatGPT to do your essays for you. Now have yourself the school.
WENDY
I write my own essays.
[Back out in the school hallway.]
STAN
I don’t know what to do. I am not creative enough to think of a way out of this. Wait that’s it.
[outside the school Stan takes out his phone and starts typing On ChatGPT.]
[Stan enters the school.]
CHAT GPT
one day when Stan got to school he was approached by his best friend.
KYLE
Dude, did you hear what happened to your girlfriend?
STAN
No what about her?
KYLE
Dude, she got caught cheating on her essay.
CHAT GPT
Just then Stan noticed a commotion down the hallway.
[Sean cuts to the hallway. Wendy (handcuffed) is being escorted by two police men while Mr. Mackey and the School Advisory Board Technician watch.]
SCHOOL ADVISORY BOARD TECHNICIAN
This student is going to jail for cheating.
MR. MACKEY
Drugs are bad uh Kay.
STAN
Hold it right there.
STAN
Look everyone we can’t blame people who use ChatGPT. It’s not their fault.
[Sean cuts to Mr. Mackey.]
MR. MACKEY
Well whose fault is it?
[Sean cuts to Stan.]
STAN
I tell you who it is the giant tech companies. Who took open AI packaged it monetized it and pushed it out to all of us as fast as they could in order to get ahead. Open AI is so powerful that it has to be something that everyone can use, control and contribute to or else AI will be controlled by corporations who just want an unfair advantage like Cartman does.
[Sean cuts to Eric Cartman.]
ERIC CARTMAN
Hay screw you. You dumb Jew.
[Sean cuts to Stan.]
STAN
We don’t want big corporations deciding what is ethical and acceptable for AI. We were all taken advantage of and that’s why my girlfriend will totality understa nd that I used ChatGPT to respond to her text.
WENDY
That’s right.
[Sean cuts to Wendy.]
[A police officer takes Wendy’s handcuffs off.]
POLICE OFFICER
Well I guess we can let you go now madam.
[Sean cuts to School Advisory Board Technician.]
SCHOOL ADVISORY BOARD TECHNICIAN
I will find these tech companies who are trying to use open AI for their own gains and I will stop them.
