Spookyfish

ANNOUNCER
The following program is brought to you in spooky vision. Be warned: all scenes will be accompanied by pictures of Barbra Streisand.
[A scream is heard and the Halloween/"Pinkeye" opening sequence is shown.]
[Outer Space. A alien ship descends, and then turns towards Earth, headed for the western U.S. As it enters the atmosphere it begins to burn. It slows down and hovers over a road, then lands gently. A door opens like a camera lens, and an alien drops down. As soon as he moves, a tire crushes him. Judging by the size of the tire, the alien was 18 to 24 inches tall. The tire is that of the South Park Elementary school bus, which stops to let the boys off. Then it pulls away.]
STAN
I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.
KYLE
He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.
CARTMAN
Hey guys. How's it going?
[Cartman now has a full goatee. Kyle and Stan laugh.]
KYLE
Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?
STAN
Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?
KYLE
Did you eat too many pork rinds last night?
[Kyle and Stan laugh again.]
CARTMAN
You guys, you're so funny. No matter how I'm feeling, I can always count on you guys to lighten me up.
STAN
What?
CARTMAN
I had to stay home because my mother wasn't feeling well. She has the flu, and I wanted to take care of the house so she could stay in bed
[Stan and Kyle stand there shocked.]
CARTMAN
I just wanted to catch you guys to see if we were assigned any homework tonight.
KYLE
What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!
STAN
Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.
CARTMAN
[Excited.] Oooh, then we can enter the carving contest! I'll run home and get money from Mother. Do you guys need some, too?
[Cartman and the boys look at each other.]
STAN
Dude, this is creepy.
[Stan's house. Stan walks in to find Sharon and someone new.]
SHARON
Stanley? Look who's here. Aunt Flo.
[An elderly woman with glasses who has two gifts wrapped up next to her.]
AUNT FLO
Hello, Stanley. Remember me?
STANLEY
[Flatly] Hi, Aunt Flo.
[Stan hesitates to enter, Aunt Flo begins to tremble.]
SHARON
Now, Stanley! Aunt Flo only visits once a month. Be nice.
AUNT FLO
Hey, Stanley. I brought you and Shelly presents.
STAN
Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo!
[He rushes in, Shelly turning up as well.]
AUNT FLO
Okay, Shelly. This one's for you.
[Shelly opens up the larger box and it expands out into.]
AUNT FLO
It's a television/CD player/surround sound home theater.
STAN
Wow!
SHARON
What do you say, Shelly?
SHELLY
Thank you, Aunt Flo.
SHARON
Okay, Stanley. Your turn.
[Stan opens up his box and reaches in.]
AUNT FLO
Your very own fish.
SHARON
What do you say, Stanley?
STAN
I don't know.
[Stan and the fish look at each other. Stan shows some fear.]
AUNT FLO
[Softly.] I think he likes you. [Normal.] Come on Shelly. Let's hook up your home theater.
SHELLY
Okay.
[Shelly follows her aunt out.]
SHARON
How do you like your fish, Stanley?
STAN
I don't like it. It's spooky.
SHARON
Oh, now, what's spooky about a cute, little goldfish? Go put him in your room.
STAN
Do I have to?
SHARON
Yes, you do!
STAN
Damn it!
[Stan walks off with the goldfish.]
SHARON
Language!
[A different Barbra picture zooms out from the center of the screen. Next: the bus stop. Kyle is already there.]
KYLE
Where have you been, dude?
STAN
Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor.
KYLE
Aunt Flo?
STAN
Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
KYLE
Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.
STAN
Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice.
KYLE
Here he comes.
STAN
Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?
CARTMAN
[clean-shaven] Heh! Yeah, right! You guys could kiss my black ass!
KYLE
You said you could get us money, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Man, you guys are hella stupid! If I had money, I wouldn't give it to you assholes!
KYLE
Well, at least he's back to normal.
STAN
Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!
KYLE
It's okay. Kenny said he'd get one.
CARTMAN
Oh, how's Kenny gonna get one?! He's hella poor!
STAN
Why do you keep saying "hella", fatass?!
CARTMAN
'Cause I'm hella cool, that's why.
KYLE
That's not cool!
CARTMAN
You guys are just hella jealous.
[Night time, storm. Stan's house. Randy is about to turn off the light in Stan's room.]
RANDY
Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning.
STAN
Can you leave the light on, Dad?
RANDY
Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity.
STAN
I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
RANDY
Yeah, me too. But she only visits your mom for five days or so. I'll be out sleeping on the couch. [turns the light off and closes the door].
[In the darkness, Stan pulls the covers close and looks at the fish. They stare at each other, and the fish blows a bubble. Stan turns away, then looks back. The fish just looks at him. Stan then turns towards the window and begins to fall asleep, until lightning startles him upright. He looks at the tank. The fish is gone!]
STAN
Where did it go? [he lifts the covers and looks under the bed, then sits back. The fish swims back into view.] Huhhh. [he gets out, picks up his shirt, and throws it over the tank. He goes back to bed and looks at the tank again.]
[Kenny's house. Rain is dripping in all over the ceiling as pails collect the water. Kenny, Kevin and Mom share a blanket on the sofa while Stuart sits in the armchair.]
KENNY
(Give me that-!) [pulls the blanket off Kevin]
CAROL
Kenny [paf]
KENNY
(Ow, mom!)
CAROL
You share that blanket with your brother! [knock knock knock]
STUART
Who the hell could that be? [the front door opens and the family looks to see who it is].
CARTMAN
[with mustache and beard, and dressed in raingear] Hi there, folks! This is a heck of a storm out now! Thought maybe you could use some provisions. [a box of SUPPLIES is next to him. The parents look at each other] There's some candles and food in there. It ain't much, but it should get you through the night. Take care, folks. I've got other houses to get to. [walks off].
STUART
[suspicious] Kenny, wasn't that your fat, racist, foul-mouthed friend, Eric Cartman?
KENNY
(Uh huh.)
[Stan's house. He gets up once again to look at the tank, but the shirt is not on it anymore.]
STAN
Hey. Where did the shirt go? [hops off and approaches the fish] I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?! [the fish blinks, then looks down and to the right. Stan's eyes follow, and he sees the shirt.] AAAaAaAaAa [runs back to his bed and pulls the covers up, then drops them a bit. He looks at the fish] I'm not gonna look. [shuts his eyes, then opens them again. The fish tank, and the dresser it's on, are closer to the bed] It's not closer. I'm just seeing things. [shuts his eyes again, then opens them. The tank and dresser are at the foot of his bed] GAAAH! [shuts his eyes tight, and opens them one more time. The fish tank is now on the bed, between his feet] AAAAAAAH!! [he jumps off, runs to his door, and rushes into the hallway] MOM! Mom! [comes back to the room with her in tow]
SHARON
Stanley, settle down!
STAN
Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom!
AUNT FLO
[at the door] Is there a problem? [walks to Sharon]
SHARON
Uh, no problem, Aunt Flo.
AUNT FLO
Do you not like your goldfish?
STAN
No!
AUNT FLO
I'm sorry. I'm a bad aunt. [buries her face in her hand and begins to sob.]
SHARON
There, there, Aunt Flo. Stanley loves his goldfish. [he merely looks up at them]
[1:25 a.m. Stan is under the covers looking at the spooky fish. After a long while, the fish turns around and starts writing something on the tank wall with his tail. Stan gets out of bed for a closer look. The fish finishes writing and turns to blow on the wall. A gray area appears and the word "KILL" appears within it.]
STAN
AAAAAAAAH! [runs back to bed]
SHARON
[enters his room and turns on the lights] Stanley, what are you doing?!
STAN
[pointing] The fish! [nothing is left of the writing on the tank wall] But-
SHARON
Stanley, I'm in no mood for this! Not when your Aunt Flo is in town! Oh, look, you woke your sister up. [Shelly stands in front of Sharon, then approaches Stan and slaps him, then leaves the room] Go to sleep, Stanley! [turns off the light and closes the door behind her.]
[Stan gets back into bed and pulls the covers up. Another flash of lighting gets Stan to sit up again. He looks at the tank again, then gets out of bed for a closer look, failing to notice the growing pool of blood next to him. The fish again looks down and to the right, and Stan's eyes follow.]
STAN
[gasps. A man lies dead between the tank and the bed] WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm!
SHARON
All right, Stanley. I have had enough o- [freezes when she sees the body, then, quivering] Oh, Stanley, what have you done, baby? What have you done?? [rushes to comfort him]
STAN
Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-
SHARON
[covers his mouth with her arm, then quietly] Sshhh. It's okay, honey. It's okay. I've got such a good boy, Mommy's little angel. [kisses him and gets up] Now, don't worry, Stanley. Mommy's going to hide the body. [starts to drag it away] Nobody's going to take my baby away. I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy. [she drags the body out of the room and out into the storm. Stan just looks at her]
STAN
[turns to the fish] You're not gonna get away with this! [the fish writes again, blows, and the message is: "Yes I Will."]
[Stan walks over to the window and sees his mom digging a grave next to the body. She then places the body in the grave and covers it up. She returns with the shovel to the kitchen and closes the door behind her.]
AUNT FLO
[her silhouette appears] Sharon!
SHARON
D'uh! Aunt Flo, what are you doing up?!
AUNT FLO
Look at you, with your little shovel. Just like when you were twelve.
STAN
[sees Sharon pass by] Mom, what are you doing?
SHARON
Sshh. It's going to be okay, Stanley.
STAN
Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next!
[The fish blinks and blows a bubble.]
SHARON
[enters the room] Now get some sleep, baby. Mommy's taken care of everything.
STAN
But MOM!
SHARON
[Cradles Stan] Sshh.
Hush little baby, don't say a word.
Momma's gonna buy you a mockin' bird.
If that mockin' bird don't sing, Momma's gonna bury it in the backyard
[8 a.m., next day. A rooster crows and Stan's clock farts. Stan wakes up and looks at the tank. The fish is still there. Stan hops off the bed and walks to the tank, but is stopped by another body.]
STAN
MMOOMM!
SHARON
[frantic] What is it, honey? [gasp!] My baby's killed again!
STAN
[points at the body, then holds up his hands] No, mom!
SHARON
[holds him tight] What are we gonna do, baby? What are we gonna do?? [the fish looks on. Sharon drags the body out] I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy.
[Stan then stands at the window. As he looks out, a reflection of Sharon burying the body is seen on the window pane.]
[Almost 8 p.m., Kyle's house. Kyle and Cartman are at table when Kenny comes in]
KYLE
It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?
KENNY
(Uh huh!)
CARTMAN
Well, where is it? [Kenny brings out a squash and sets it on the table] What the hell is that?!
KENNY
(It's the only thing I could afford.)
CARTMAN
It's all you could afford?! Whoever heard of a squash-o-lantern, Kenny?! That's hella stupid!
KYLE
Stop saying "hella," Cartman! [to Kenny] How are we gonna win the contest with a squash? [as Kyle says this Stan enters the room] Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good.
STAN
[squeezes into Kyle's chair so both fit. Cartman walks to Kenny's chair] I haven't been sleeping so well.
CARTMAN
[cuts the top off the squash and taps at the bottom to clear it out. Sigh] God, I hate you, Kenny. [works on the squash some more] I have to get another knife; this one's hella dull! [goes into the kitchen for another one]
KYLE
God, will you shut up?!
STAN
Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?
KYLE
Yeah.
STAN
Do you think animals can be murderers, too?
KYLE
I don't know. [the bearded Cartman comes in with a huge knife] Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again.
CARTMAN
[gives Kenny a hand] No, Kenny. You should cut with the blade facing away from you. You're gonna hurt yourself. Seriously, dude. Isn't this fun, you guys? Carving pumpkins for Halloween?

You guys are my best friends
Through thick and thin, we've always been together
We're four of a kind, havin' fun all day
Pallin' around and laughin' away
Just best friends, best friends are we.
I love you guys. [throughout the song, Kyle and Stan look on with awe]
[Next day. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are at the bus stop. A picture of Barbra in curls is now on all four corners.]
KYLE
You seem tired, Stan.
STAN
I haven't been sleeping well.
KYLE
Why?
STAN
My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.
KYLE
Hoh, that sucks, dude.
CARTMAN
Hey, dudes. Man, it's hella cold out here.
KYLE
Cartman?
CARTMAN
Who'd you expect? Maury Povich? Golly, you're hella lame!
STAN
What are you doing?!
CARTMAN
What do you mean, what am I doing?! I'm just standing here. Jesus, mellow out, you guys.
KYLE
You can't be standing there, Cartman.
CARTMAN
Why the hell not?!
KYLE
Because you're standing over there!
[Kenny looks at the bearded Cartman.]
CARTMAN
[seeing his parallel for the first time] Aaah! Son of a bitch!
EVIL CARTMAN
[Cartman walks to him] Wow, you don't see this every day.
CARTMAN
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
EVIL CARTMAN
It's like I'm looking in a mirror.
CARTMAN
Dude, this is hella weird.
[Sunrise, Stan's house. Officer Barbrady approaches the front door, humming. [He rings the bell]']
SHARON
[answering] Oh. Uh-Officer Barbrady, Woo, wh-what a surprise. What can I do for you?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, there's been a report of a few missing people.
SHARON
Is that so?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Yeah. No biggie, but I was wondering if you had seen any of them. [show her some pictures of the missing men]
SHARON
I'd never seen any of those men, Officer Barbrady.
OFFICER BARBRADY
No, I didn't think so. Mind if I look around the back yard, though?
SHARON
[somewhat alarmed] Why would you wanna do that?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, I'm checking everyone's back yards. Missing people usually turn up hiding in someone's bushes. May I? [Sharon moves aside and Barbrady enters. They head for the back yard, where five fresh graves await around the clubhouse, and Sparky is pulling a leg out of one of them. Sparky pulls it free and walks away with it] Well, this all looks in- [clunk] oh? Tennis anyone? [falls to the floor unconscious. Sharon had hit him with a pan]
[The fourth image of Barbra zooms out and back with a scream, and Sharon is now in the basement.]
SHARON
Nobody's going to take my baby away from me! Nobody!
OFFICER BARBRADY
[missing his pants and shoes, his wrists are tied to posts] Okay, Mrs. Marsh, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you a few questions.
[South Park Elementary, lunch time. The boys are in the kitchen for their food.]
CHEF
[excited] Hello there, children! [he is dressed as an African chieftain, complete with reebock skull]
THE BOYS
Hey, Chef.
CHEF
All ready for our Halloween lunch? Today I've got spooooooky spaghetti, with freeeeeaky French fries.
KYLE
Uh, Chef?
CHEF
Or haaauuunted hash browns.
KYLE
Chef.
CHEF
And a creeeeeepy cookie, and moooooonstrous milk!
KYLE
Chef.
CHEF
And a teeeeerrifying napkin!
KYLE
Chef!
CHEF
What?!
KYLE
We have problems!
CHEF
Well, what's the first problem?
STAN
Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people.
CHEF
Oh. Well, uh, don't worry, Stan. I'm sure it'll work out. Now, what's the other problem? [Kyle points to Cartman, but now there are two of him. They blink together.] Oh, nohoho. [rubs his eyes] Oh, DEAR GOD, NO!
[Cafeteria dining area. The five boys and Chef are sitting at a table.]
CARTMAN
...and them I saw them all at the bus stop, and this son of a bitch is standing there!
EVIL CARTMAN
I'm sorry I caused so much trouble. This is all very strange to me, too.
CHEF
Exactly what do you remember?
EVIL CARTMAN
Well, I was just standing around, and Stan and Kyle were being really mean, as usual, and Kenny had just bought a new car.
CHEF
Of course! That's it!
STAN
What?
CHEF
Don't you see, children? This Cartman is from an evil, parallel universe where everything exists as its opposite!
CARTMAN
He's my evil twin? But he doesn't even look that much like me; he's all fat and stuff. He's hella lying.
KYLE
Will you stop saying that word?!
STAN
Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!
CHEF
Children, somewhere in South Park, something has created a door to the evil, parallel universe!
EVIL CARTMAN
This is amazing! I can't believe how nice you are, Chef.
CHEF
How do you mean?
EVIL CARTMAN
In my world, you're a skinny, white insurance salesman.
[Chef's jaw drops.]
[Stan's house, daytime. The boys enter the living room and Stan places his fish on a small desk next to the sofa. Aunt Flo greets them.]
AUNT FLO
[shaking] Ooh, hello, boys. I'm Stan's Aunt Flo.
KYLE
Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?
STAN
[taps Kyle, then softly] Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease.
CARTMAN
Ey, sweet! [hops on her lap] Sweeeeeet! Check it out, guys; you don't even have to put a quarter in her.
STAN
Cartman!
CARTMAN
Dude, this is hella cool.
STAN
Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?
AUNT FLO
Nn-oh. [Cartman hops off and rejoins the boys] I got it from the pet store, Stanley.
STAN
Do you remember what pet store?
AUNT FLO
Let's see. I believe it was called "The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store," just outside of town.
STAN
Where?
AUNT FLO
I know I have the address written down somewhere. [Stan turns and takes Kyle aside] Let me look.
STAN
That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.
CARTMAN
Who's "we"? You got a turd in your pocket? I'm goin' home. I'm hella hungry!
EVIL CARTMAN
I'll help you, Stan.
CARTMAN
Shut your god-damned mouth, fatass!
KYLE
Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.
STAN
Just help me take it back. Come on! [walks to Aunt Flo, who's now dead on the floor] Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!
SHARON
[rushing in] Oh, Stanley, no! Not Aunt Flo! [holds her hands to her face]
STAN
It was the fish! [points to it]
SHARON
[dragging Aunt Flo, mutters] Oh, what a good baby. What a good son I have. [the fish swims around]
STAN
Now we'll never know where that pet store is!
KYLE
There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude. [the fish jumps out and somehow pulls Kenny into the tank head first.]
STAN
Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver. [Kenny starts to gargle as the fish gives him the blender treatment. The water turns blood red as Kenny spins in the tank]
KYLE
Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book.
EVIL CARTMAN
Can do!
CARTMAN
Screw you! [the fish spits Kenny's corpse out of the tank and jumps back in. Kenny's left eye is gone and the water is clear]
SHARON
[returning] It's all taken care of, Stanley- G'oh! [sees Kenny's corpse and reacts frantically. Rats rush in to munch on it] I've got such a good boy, such a handsome boy! [drags Kenny away. The fish looks on]
STAN
[to Kyle] Come on, we're running out of time. [both walk by Randy trying to open a door]
RANDY
[turns around] Hey, why is the basement door locked? [turns back and keeps trying]
[The Marsh basement. Officer Barbrady is still tied up.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
-crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
My master's gone away
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
[Cartman's house. Both Cartmans are seated on the sofa. Evil Cartman has the phone book, Cartman has a pot pie.]
EVIL CARTMAN
I don't see any pet stores called "Indian Burial Ground."
CARTMAN
Shut up, dude! I'm trying to watch TV!
ANNOUNCER
And now, back to the Terrance and Phillip Halloween Special.
TERRANCE
[both are dressed as ghosts] (Fart)
PHILLIP
[long pause] That fart was absolutely ghoulish, Terrance. [both pull out little daggers and stab each other as they laugh. Small spurts of blood ensue.]
CARTMAN
Uh-ho-ho, man, that's hella funny! [slaps his thigh]
EVIL CARTMAN
[looks up] What's so funny about that?
KITTY
Meow.
CARTMAN
No, Kitty, this is my pot pie!
MR. KITTY
Meow.
CARTMAN
No, Kitty, this is my pot pie, Kitty!
EVIL CARTMAN
[picks up Kitty] Who's my kitty? Who's my little kitty? My fluffy little cat. Yeah, that's good, yeah, that's my nice little kitty, yeah. [Kitty is purring loudly, happily now. Cartman is not amused.]
CARTMAN
NO KITTY, BAD KITTY!!! [Evil Cartman is startled as Kitty jumps away.] Hahaha, you-hoo suck, dude.
[Night time, the Marsh house. Stan and Kyle are on the sofa. Sharon enters with another woman.]
SHARON
Stanley. Kenny's mother is here. She's wondering if you've seen Kenny.
CAROL
[approaches him] You saw him, didn't you? [Sharon mouths and waves "no" to Stan] You saw my boy. [sits down on the sofa between the boys]
STAN
Yeah, my goldfish-.
SHARON
Yeah. Stan just got a new goldfish and he wanted to show it to Kenny but, Kenny never came over.
CAROL
[cradling Stan, distraught] My Kenny used to laugh and play. He was eight years old, just like you, my Kenny was.
STAN
I know.
CAROL
You've gotta tell me what happened to him! [holds Stan up and throttles him] You have to know something!
SHARON
[intervening] Mrs. McCormick, I'm going to have to ask you to leave! You've been drinking!
CAROL
That's right, I'm a little drunk. [Sharon escorts her to the door] You'd be drunk, too, if you'd lost your boy. [Evil Cartman enters as the women reach the door] My Kenny used to sing and dance, eh.
EVIL CARTMAN
[at the sofa] You guys, I found the pet store!
STAN
Come on, let's go! [takes the fish with him and stops before Sharon] Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!
SHARON
I believe you, sweetheart. [Stan goes outside, and she addresses Kyle and Evil Cartman] Run from him, boys. Run and don't stop!
[A stormy night, at the pet store. The remains of a covered wagon are next to it. The three boys enter.]
CLERK
Can I help you boys?
STAN
I wanna return a fish.
CLERK
[pounds the counter with both fists] Damn it!
KYLE
What?
CLERK
That's the ninth return I've had this week! What's wrong with it? [holds his palms out] Ap! Let me guess. It killed a bunch of people, right?
STAN
Yeah, dude.
CLERK
Damn it! [pounds with the right fist] Just like all the other returns! [the camera pulls back to show them. They all groan and have red, evil eyes. One bird blinks, and its eyes glow]
KYLE
Dude, why is your store called "The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?"
CLERK
Well, there was an Indian burial ground here before I bought it.
STAN
So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?
CLERK
Oh, hell no! First I dug up all the bodies, pissed on 'em, then buried them again upside down.
STAN
Why?
CLERK
Why? I don't know. I was drunk.
STAN
We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.
CLERK
Well, that certainly would explain a lot.
KYLE
Like what?
CLERK
Well, like this. [opens a door marked, "Employees Only." A bright, flashing portal appears] I've been wondering what the hell this was.
[Stan's house. Randy finally opened the door to the basement and brings down some items.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Hello, Mr. Marsh. Top of the evening to you. [Randy turns to see Officer Barbrady, then rushes up the stairs] Okay, bye, then.
[The kitchen. Sharon is preparing cookie dough. Randy enters.]
RANDY
Sharon?
SHARON
Yes, hon?
RANDY
There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.
SHARON
[rolling the dough] Yes, hon. I had to restrain him so he wouldn't find the bodies in the back yard and take our baby away. [begins cutting out cookies in star shapes.]
RANDY
[ponders] Why'd you take his pants off? [long pause. Sharon makes more cookies] Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off?
SHARON
[sobs. Randy comes over] Oh, Randy, I just don't know what to do anymore.
RANDY
What is it?
SHARON
I just ughhhh, I can't believe that Aunt Flo is gone, that she won't be visiting me ever again.
RANDY
Oh. Uh, well, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick?
[Back at the pet store.]
STAN
Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish.
CLERK
I can't give you your money back.
STAN
I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!
CLERK
No! I won't take it back!
EVIL CARTMAN
Listen, friend. You can't sell people pets like this. You have to have a sign that says, "Warning: these fish are from an evil, parallel universe." Now, it's not our fault you disrespected the bodies of this land's native people, but by golly [pounds his right hand with his left fist], you're gonna take this fish back.
CLERK
All right, you win.
STAN
Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman! [the clerk takes the fish from Stan]
EVIL CARTMAN
[turns to face the clerk again] And sir, can I make a suggestion? [the clerk looks at him] Move your store, and let these great people of the Wampanoag rest in peace.
KYLE
You kick ass, evil Cartman!
STAN
Yeah!
KYLE
You know what I like best about you? You don't say, "hella," like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him! [the boys exit the store, and the skies are clear]
EVIL CARTMAN
No, Kyle. Murder is never an answer. [the clerk puts the fish up on a shelf and the employee door opens, the doorway glowing brightly]
CLERK
[recoils] What the-? [two figures appear: Evil Stan and Evil Kyle]
EVIL STAN
He was here! Cartman was just here!
CLERK
Who are you?
EVIL KYLE
We're looking for Cartman. The trail ended here. Where is he?
CLERK
I don't know who you mean?
EVIL KYLE
[pulls out a big bat] Maybe this will jog your memory! [starts releasing the evil returns by bashing in the cages]
CLERK
No! Stop! You don't know what you're doing! Those pets are evil!
[Several identical images of Barbra flash through space, one of them towards the camera, and the boys are walking down Main Street.]
STAN
I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.
EVIL CARTMAN
Hey, you guys. We still have time to enter the pumpkin-carving contest.
KYLE
Hey, yeah! I almost forgot.
EVIL CARTMAN
Come on! I bet that together we can make the best pumpkin ever!
STAN
You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman.
KYLE
Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say "hella."
EVIL CARTMAN
Yuh, thanks, you guys. I certainly like you a lot more than in my evil, parallel universe. [the boys turn to see a man attacked by two dogs, a cat, two ducks, and a vulture]
[The boys resume walking.]
KYLE
Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?
EVIL CARTMAN
Let's use Kenny's squash.
STAN
Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.
[Cartman's house. Cartman is watching TV in the dark. Onscreen, Phillip is in a cemetery standing next to a tombstone that might be Terrance's, and has three roses in his hand.]
TERRANCE
[as a ghost, walks up to Phillip] Boo!
PHILLIP
[jumps up] Aaaaagh!
CARTMAN
Aw, man, this movie is hella scary. [click. The front door flies open and Evil Stan and Evil Kyle burst in]
EVIL STAN
Aha! There you are, Cartman!
CARTMAN
P'h. Nice costume, you guys. You spent about a buck fifty on those?
EVIL KYLE
We're here to take you back, Goody Two-Shoes!
CARTMAN
Oh? I've got a better idea. Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?
EVIL STAN
[he and Evil Kyle look at each other, then] Hey! What's wrong with you, Cartman?
CARTMAN
What's wrong with me? Let's see. Uum. [checks them off] I hate you guys. You're hella stupid.
EVIL KYLE
[he and Evil Stan go over to grab him] Come on, Mr. Wholesome! We're taking you back to our universe!
CARTMAN
Don't touch me! [punches Evil Stan, who releases him]
EVIL STAN
What the hell's goin' on?! Cartman never hits us!
EVIL KYLE
Hall right! Just stand there, Cartman! This gingerification gun will send you back to our universe!
CARTMAN
Oh, right! You guys are from the evil, parallel universe?!
EVIL STAN
Yes!
CARTMAN
Oh, it's about freakin' time you showed up! You don't want me, you want that impostor Cartman! Come on, I'll show you. [leads them out the door]
[At the Pumpkin Carving Contest. Mayor McDaniels is dressed as a Puritan woman. Johnson holds a ball on a platter. They are on stage, which is adorned with two spiderwebs and a bat in each one.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
And the winner is: Squash-O-Lantern, by Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and the evil Eric Cartman from the parallel universe! "The Winning Entry! Squash in cobweb, amid a tiny graveyard and flanked by four tiny bats"
STAN
[the crowd cheers] We won, dude!
EVIL CARTMAN
Hooray!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
You boys win the Halloween Chocolate Ball!
EVIL CARTMAN
Oh, no! [spots Cartman, Evil Stan and Evil Kyle] Stan and Kyle have come to take my back to my world, and I don't wanna go back!
STAN
Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us! [the two groups face each other]
CARTMAN
[to Evil Kyle] Now, zap his hella ass back to your- hella universe!
KYLE
Stop saying "hella," Cartman!
EVIL STAN
[to Evil Cartman] Thought you could get away from us, huh, Cartman?!
EVIL CARTMAN
[pleading] Please!
KYLE
Leave him alone, butthole!
EVIL KYLE
Shut your trap, kid!
STAN
Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.
CARTMAN
Ey, you backstabbin' sellout!
EVIL STAN
It's time, Cartman! Prepare for gingerification! [sets the gun]
EVIL CARTMAN
Well, good-bye, you guys. It's been fun. [Stan and Kyle look down. The evil pets return to South Park and start attacking the townsfolk. They scream as they are being attacked.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Oh, what now?!
KYLE
It's the evil pets [the attack continues, and a vulture knocks the gingerification gun out of Evil Stan's hands.]
EVIL STAN
The gingerification gun!
STAN
[picks it up] Get to the stage! [Stan, Kyle, and Evil Cartman rush up. Stan's spooky fish attacks a man and kills him]
SHARON
[seeing what just happened] Oh, dear. It really was Stan's fish that killed those people!
EVIL STAN
[all six boys are on stage] Give me that gun, kid!
STAN
Up yours, evil twin! [zaps him back to the evil, parallel universe.]
EVIL STAN
[shrinks as Evil Kyle watches] Noooooo! [vanishes]
EVIL KYLE
[zapped, he shrinks too] Noooooo! [vanishes]
CARTMAN
All right, now you can try to send this Bozo through and the whole mess'll be over with!
STAN
Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya. [takes aim]
CARTMAN
What?!
KYLE
We can't deal with you saying "hella" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe! [Cartman takes on Evil Cartman, and both wrestle. Cartman rips off Evil Cartman's mustache and beard, and kicks him. Both of them then stand up, indistinguishable. Stan pulls the gingerification gun back]
KYLE
Which one is the good Cartman?
BOTH CARTMANS
I am!
STAN
Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!
KYLE
Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!
BOTH CARTMANS
[pointing to the other one] He is!
CARTMAN ON LEFT
Time is running out. You'll have to destroy us both.
CARTMAN ON RIGHT
What?!
CARTMAN ON LEFT
It's the only way you can be sure. We have to both go, for the good of the world.
CARTMAN ON RIGHT
[Stan zaps him] Noooo! Screw you guys! [disappears]
CARTMAN ON LEFT
How did you guys know?
STAN
Our Cartman would never say anything like that.
CARTMAN
Haaa hahaha! You guys are hella stupid! I knew you would fall for that!
KYLE
Oh no, dude!
STAN
You tricked us, Cartman!
CARTMAN
That's right, I did!
You guys are hella stupid
You guys are hella lame
You guys are hella dumb
Hella hella hella!
KYLE
Damn it!
[On the street, Randy walks with Officer Barbrady. The evil pets are still attacking the townsfolk.]
RANDY
I'm sorry my wife held you captive, officer. She's been upset 'cause her Aunt Flo isn't gonna visit her anymore.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh, I understand. I remember when my wife stopped getting her monthly visitor.
RANDY
Uuuh, do you want your pants back?
OFFICER BARBRADY
No. Just leave me with my dignity. [turns around and walks into the crowd] Okay, people, move along. Nothing to see here.
[End of "Spookyfish". Cartman sings "Best Friends".]
