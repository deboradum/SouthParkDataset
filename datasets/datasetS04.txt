synopsis:When Cartman discovers the Tooth Fairy is paying a premium price for his lost teeth, he and the boys seize the opportunity to make some cash.

script:The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000

[The Cartman house. Liane is sipping her coffee on the sofa. She lowers it as Cartman screams]
CARTMAN
Mom! MOOOM! Mom! [races down the stairs in pajamas, cap, and coat in the right hand and two dollars in the left one, and stops at Liane's feet] Seriously! Something wonderful has happened!
LIANE
What is it, snookums?
CARTMAN
Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars! [shows them off] She's only given me a lousy quarter before!
LIANE
Oh my! She must think that you are a very special little muffin.
CARTMAN
[hops onto the sofa] Yeah! This is so tits!
LIANE
Don't say "tits," Eric.
CARTMAN
Oh, I mean, this is so cool!
LIANE
Well, then, now you should take that money and open up a savings account that has compounded daily interest.
CARTMAN
Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard! [dons his coat]
LIANE
But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy wants you to use that money to learn about saving.
CARTMAN
Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see you later! [turns and walks out] Aw, man, this is so tits!
[The bus stop. Stan, Kyle and Kenny stand around]
CARTMAN
[off camera, heard running up] Hey you guys! You're not gonna believe this! [Stan and Kyle look at each other, then at Cartman] Oh my God, you guys, seriously! [runs around them] Just wait until you hear this, you guys! I'm rich! I'm totally rich! [turns to face them] Aren't you stoked?!
STAN
What the hell's wrong with Cartman?!
KYLE
He's fat and he's stupid?
CARTMAN
[pants, then] Look what the tooth fairy left me last night! [presents the two dollars]
STAN
Two dollars!
KYLE
No way!
STAN
For one tooth?
CARTMAN
For one tooth.
STAN
Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter.
KYLE
I only got a jar of gefilte fish.
CARTMAN
Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits.
KYLE
...Totally what?
CARTMAN
Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a [stretches the words] Sega Dreamcast.
STAN, KYLE, KENNY
Sega Dreamcast??
CARTMAN
All we need is teeth.
STAN
I already lost all my baby teeth.
KYLE
Me too. [Kenny says nothing, so the others look at him]
KENNY
[covers his mouth] (Nuh-uh.)
KYLE
You still have baby teeth, Kenny?
KENNY
(No way!)
CARTMAN
[moves to Kenny's side] Kenny, think about it. Don't you want a [stretches the words] Sega Dreamcast?
KENNY
[punctuates] (No I don't! Thank you.)
CARTMAN
[ignoring the answer] Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits!
[The school yard. Stan ties Kenny to a tetherball pole. The string leads off to the right]
STAN
Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?
KYLE
[at the other end, tying the string to a wheelchair] Almost. You ready, Timmy?
TIMMY BURCH
[the boy in the wheelchair] Timmiihh!
KYLE
When I say "go," you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?
TIMMY
Timmiihh!
KYLE
Right. You're Timmy.
TIMMY
Timmiihh! Lemmeouttaheah!
KENNY
(Why the fuck does it have to be my tooth?)
CARTMAN
I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us. [tugs on Kenny's hood] "Oh, thank you, guys." You're welcome, Kenny.
KENNY
[punctuates] (Fuck you!)
KYLE
Alright! Get ready, Timmy.
TIMMY
Timmiihh!
BUTTERS
[walks up] Heh-hey guys, uh, wu-what are you doin'?
STAN
What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's.
BUTTERS
Oh. Heh, I got a loose tooth right here. [draws it from his pocket]
STAN, CARTMAN
You what?
KENNY
(You what?)
TIMMY
Timmih-
BUTTERS
Yyep. Oo-one of mine came out not two hours ago.
STAN
Uh, Butters, could we have it?
BUTTERS
Wwell, heck no! Uh you can't have it. Why, I'm gonna stick it under-my pillow and get money from the tooth fairy. She gives me fifty cents a tooth.
TIMMY
Ha-a-ugh.
BUTTERS
Well, uh, see ya, fellas. [walks away]
KYLE
[walks up to Stan] Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth.
STAN
Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth.
KENNY
(Woohoo!)
CARTMAN
How are we gonna get it from him?
STAN
I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.
KYLE
Yeah, let's go. [the group begins to move when]
TIMMY
Go! Timmy go! [revs up, pulling Kenny] Yeah, Timmy! [drives until he runs out of string, then is jerked back]
KYLE
No, Timmy, wait!
TIMMY
Engh go uh Timmy! [the string goes taut, and Kenny's face protrudes from his hood]
KENNY
(Hey, guys!) [yanked from his suit into the air] (Heey-ungh) [lands naked in front of Cartman] (Oowww.)
CARTMAN
Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha.
TIMMY
Hu-aah!
[A house, night. Butters is asleep in his room. A pole rises outside with a grinning Cartman dressed as a tooth fairy dangling from it]
CARTMAN
Higher, you guys.
STAN
[struggling with the pole with Kyle and Kenny] Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?
CARTMAN
[bumps into the window] Agh! Careful, you assholes! [opens the window] To the left, you guys, left. [is moved to his left] No, camera left, camera left! [is moved in the other direction, towards Butters' head] That's it, now down. [is lowered, then reaches for the pillow]
BUTTERS
[wakes up] What the-? [rubs his eyes] Who's there? Who is that?!
CARTMAN
[in falsetto] I am the tooth fairy, my child.
BUTTERS
Hoh. Sorry, Miss Fairy. I didn't mean to gaze at you. I'm back to sleep now, see? [squeezes his eyelids shut]
CARTMAN
Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow. [reaches under and grabs Butters' tooth, then beholds the treasure. He then places some money under the pillow as Butters sneaks a peek.]
BUTTERS
[as Cartman withdraws] Well, oh gosh, I, I didn't think you'd be so fat.
CARTMAN
Ey!
KYLE
Come on, fatass!
CARTMAN
Do not open your eyes until morning. [Butters has them shut real tight; Cartman tugs on the rope and is pulled out of the room] Or else I will kick you in the nuts. [drops down] Square in the nuts.
BUTTERS
Yuh, yu-yes ma'am!
STAN
Well?
CARTMAN
Bull's eye!
[Cartman's house, later. He's being tucked in bed]
LIANE
Tucky tucky time, it's the best time of the night.
CARTMAN
I love that song, Mom. Sing it again.
LIANE
No, honey, Mommy's gotta save her throat. I have to work tonight.
CARTMAN
Okay.
LIANE
Good night. [heads for the door. Cartman settles in and is about to place the tooth under the pillow] What do you have there, Eric?
CARTMAN
Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy.
LIANE
Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days.
CARTMAN
I know, huh?
[The bus stop, next morning. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are there]
CARTMAN
You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys! [runs around them counterclockwise] Holy crap, you guys! I mean-
KYLE
Did the tooth fairy come?
CARTMAN
Four dollars. [the other three answer at the same time]
STAN
Oh my God!
KYLE
Four dollars?
KENNY
(Oh, my God!)
CARTMAN
Do you what this means?
STAN
Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow. [he and Kyle grin]
[Dentist office, some days later. A phone rings]
A DENTIST
[answering] Dentist office.
LIANE
Oh. Eh-hello, Dr. Roberts? It's Ms. Cartman.
DR. ROBERTS
Oh, yes, Ms. Cartman. What can I do for you?
LIANE
Well, it's my son. He's lost a lot of his baby teeth, and I was starting to get worried.
DR. ROBERTS
Well, losing baby teeth is a natural thing, Ms. Cartman. How many has he lost?
LIANE
About a hundred and twelve.
DR. ROBERTS
...A hundred and twelve.
LIANE
Yes. Fifteen of them in one night. Perhaps he should switch toothpaste?
DR. ROBERTS
Your son wouldn't happen to be an "alligator," would he? No? Hm, I see. Well, I'm afraid I can't help you right now. The American Dental Association convention is this week, but, as soon as I get back, I'll look into it.
LIANE
O-oh, thank you. Freebie next week. [hangs up]
DR. ROBERTS
What?
[Cartman's room, dawn. He rises and throws his pillows off the bed]
CARTMAN
Tih- [the tooth he placed under his pillow is still there] Tooth? [picks it up and looks at it in disbelief] What the hell? Mom!
LIANE
[rushes in] Yes, Eric
CARTMAN
You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!
LIANE
Oh. Eric, poopie, sit down. [Cartman sits] Mommy has something to tell you. It's just that- well, there is no tooth fairy, Eric. I've been putting all that money under your pillow, and because you got so many teeth fall out, I've actually run out of money and can't go to the grocery store for at least a month.
CARTMAN
[laughs] You almost had me for a second there, Mom, heh. "There's no tooth fairy." I suppose you're gonna tell me there's no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or Jesus, either, heh, heh... [mother and son sit silently for a while] M- Mom?
LIANE
I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out sooner or later.
CARTMAN
Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?
LIANE
No, honey. It's just-
CARTMAN
How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?
LIANE
Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a child.
CARTMAN
How can I trust you? [hops off the bed] How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself. [tugs at his pajama shirt] Myself and Willikins Bear, of course.
LIANE
Eric! Eric, wait!
CARTMAN
[covers his ears] No, Mother! No more lies! [runs out of his room and shuts the door]
[The Cartman house. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny wait. Cartman exits and walks down the street upset, ignoring his friends]
STAN
[he and the others follow] Dude, where's the money?
CARTMAN
[flatly] There is no money.
KYLE
No more money??
STAN
What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!
CARTMAN
I know!
KYLE
Cartman, what's going on?!
CARTMAN
[stops, then faces them sadly] You guys... [turns away] Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this.
STAN
Tell us what?!
CARTMAN
[faces them again] You guys, there's... there's no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it. [turns away again]
KYLE
What do you mean, "there's no tooth fairy?"
CARTMAN
My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money.
STAN
Dude.
KYLE
That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.
CARTMAN
But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny. [Kenny approaches him and reaches out, but Cartman bushes him off] Don't touch me, Kenny. [Kenny steps back]
KYLE
[approaches] You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!
CARTMAN
Kyle, open your eyes, man!
KYLE
It's not true! [runs away]
[The Broflovski house. Kyle enters the living room. Gerald is on the sofa reading the newspaper]
GERALD
[lowers his paper] Oh, hello, son. [Kyle turns to face him]
KYLE
Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?
GERALD
What? Oh. Kyle, let's have a little talk. [puts down his paper]
KYLE
[suddenly alarmed] Oh my God! You did lie to me.
GERALD
No. Kyle, she's just make-believe. Like Peter Pan.
KYLE
[looking aghast] Peter Pan, too??
GERALD
Kyle...
KYLE
What about Moses and Abraham?
GERALD
Well, they were probably real.
KYLE
Probably?! Is Atlantis real??
GERALD
Probably not.
KYLE
[frightened] Wahahahah!
GERALD
Look, Kyle, adults make up those things because they're fun for children.
KYLE
Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah! [runs out the door]
[The town. The boys less Stan sit at a curb moping]
CARTMAN
Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy.
KYLE
What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?
CARTMAN
No, man, that's just a TV show.
STAN
[rushing up] You guys! You guys! I figured it out!
CARTMAN
What? That your parents lied to you, too?
STAN
Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!
CARTMAN
How?
STAN
Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?
KYLE
All made up. Not real. Nothing's real.
STAN
So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!
KENNY
(Woohoo!)
STAN
The kid will never even know.
CARTMAN
Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat Oprah tits right there!
KYLE
Oh my God, what if I'm not real?
STAN
We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!
CARTMAN
Yeah. [leaves with Stan and Kenny]
KYLE
I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?
STAN
[returns] Come on, Kyle! [grabs him and pulls him along]
KYLE
What if this is all just somebody's dream?
[Cherry Creek, the wealthiest neighborhood in Colorado, night. The bus pulls up to a curb and drops the boys off in front of a three-story mansion]
CARTMAN
Wow, look at the size of these houses!
STAN
Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the [raises his hands to make quotes] "Tooth Fairy."
CARTMAN
Hey, [points across the street] that house looks perfect. There's obviously kids living there. [the boys head for a rambling ranch house. They skip the front door and head for the back]
STAN
[A window with stickers on it and a bush underneath is shown] There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it.
CARTMAN
Got it. [Stan and the others lift Cartman up.]
STAN
This is the smartest business venture ever. [Cartman is placed into position, but a blond kid swinging from another pole is lifted into position opposite him]
CARTMAN
What the-? [the camera peels back to show another group of kids on the other side of the bush]
STAN
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!
BOY 1
[with somewhat spiky hair] We're gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow, then come back and collect the tooth fairy money that his parents leave him.
STAN
...Hey, you can't do that!
BOY 2
[with cowlick] Why not?!
STAN
Because that's what we're doing!
CARTMAN
Yeah! You ripped off our idea!
BOY 2
What the hell are you talking about?! We've been doing this for over two years!
KYLE
Two years?
BLOND
Nice tooth fairy costume. You think anybody'd believe you in that?!
CARTMAN
It's better than your dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare!
BLOND
How dare you! [he and Cartman start fighting in midair]
BOY 1
Look, this is our turf! You'd better scram before the Boss breaks your legs!
STAN
You scram! We were here first!
RICH KID
[having heard the ruckus, opens the window] What's going on? [Cartman and the blond stop and look] Oh! It's the tooth fairies!
BOY 2
Oh, nice going! Now you woke him up! [the blond is lowered]
STAN
You woke him up! [Cartman is lowered]
RICH KID
I don't have any loose teeth, Miss Fairies but I have been a very good boy.
ALL
Shut up!
BOY 1
Alright, that does it! Come on, we're going to see the Boss!
STAN
Who's the Boss?
BOY 1
Loogie.
[Loogie's Ristorante. The light above the door is the one that flickers]
LOOGIE
[enjoying a plate of spaghetti and meatballs, he's dressed for business] My associates here tell me you were working Cherry Creek tonight. Is that true?
STAN
Uuh, yeah.
BOY 1
Right on our turf, Boss! I ain't ever seen that kind of disre- [Loogie raises his right palm] Erp.
CARTMAN
We were there first!
LOOGIE
[hops off his chair and walks to the portrait gallery] Kids have been doing the tooth fairy racket in this town for years. [points to each picture as he traces the line of succession] I do it just like my big brother before me, and my oldest brother before that.
STAN
Damnit! And we thought we were so original!
LOOGIE
Let me ask you something: You were gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow? Then what?
STAN
Well, uh-what do you mean?
LOOGIE
How are the kid's parents gonna know there was a tooth under their child's pillow? [the boys stay silent]
BOY 1
Ha! You guys don't even know how the tooth trade works!
STAN
What's a "tooth trade?"
LOOGIE
Look, any shmuck can sneak through a window wearing a pretty dress. The tooth racket is much more involved. [a street overlay showing kids at work in the neighborhood appears. A kid dispatcher sends them off] We keep careful track of what houses we've hit so that we don't hit the same one twice in less than two months. [the tooth fairy enters a window with another kid] Inside the house we not only have to sneak a tooth under the pillow, but leave a note for Mom and Dad to see. [this other kid places the note on John's bedroom door: Dear Toothfairy, I lost a tooth! I put it under my pillow!] This is how we let the parents know to leave money under the pillow. [the fairies ride through the neighborhood on their bikes] Once the note is in place in the last house, we start all over, going back to the first house. But this time, all we have to do is collect money. [shots of the tooth fairies cleaning up] And the kids never know what hit 'em.
THE SOUTH PARK BOYS
Wow!
LOOGIE
The hardest part is getting teeth. We tried various places. Cemeteries [Loogie's boys disinter a corpse and pull at its teeth], hockey games [two hockey players collide and one of them smacks the other one. A boy skates out and retrieves the loose tooth], anywhere we can find them [A beat-up boy is tied to a chair in a warehouse. The boy with the spiky hair is about to strike him with a mallet]
BEAT-UP BOY
Nooo! [the mallet heads for his...]
LOOGIE
The teeth we do manage to acquire are then sorted according to size, color, and quality. [like gems, they are sent to conveyor belts to be sorted by lab technicians] But there's never enough teeth. Never enough.
STAN
Amazing.
CARTMAN
Man, that is tits!
LOOGIE
And now my only problem is, what do I do with you? [the boys are alarmed]
BOY 1
Rowwr!
LOOGIE
Tell you what: how would you like to run the South Park tooth racket for me?
STAN
Oh. Uh-I don't know.
LOOGIE
It's that, or else I can cut off your penises. [motions with his knife]
CARTMAN
Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see...
KYLE
Cartman!
STAN
How much do we get if we work for you?
LOOGIE
I'll cut you in at 2%.
CARTMAN
Two percent, have my penis cut off. [Kyle gets mad at him] Two percent-
STAN
We're in!
[American Dental Association, a gleaming skyscraper, day. Then the interior is shown, with all the dentists assembled. Dr. Roberts speaks]
DR. ROBERTS
Fellow dentists: As you all know, we are still having numerous reports of missing teeth from all over the country. There are also reports of missing tooth fairy money. We believe that there can be only one logical reason for all of this. [presses a button to reveal a projection] A giant half-chicken/half-squirrel [shown sitting on a tree stump] that steals either teeth or money from children as they sleep in order to build some kind of giant nest [the chicken-squirrel feeds its young] for its genetically superior and potentially dangerous offspring! We believe also that this creature would have at least a mild understanding of algebra [the chicken-squirrel tries to solve a basic problem], and that it-
DENTIST
[stands] Uh, excuse me? I think I have a more logical theory.
DR. ROBERTS
...Yeah. Weh well, by all means, Mr. Foley, enlighten us!
MR. FOLEY
I think what we've got here is some kind of black-market tooth racket. Something where one group is stealing the money and teeth from another group for a profit. [the rest of the doctors, including the ADA head, laugh at him]
DR. ROBERTS
Oh, Mr. Foley, you realize how ridiculous that sounds.
MR. FOLEY
It's not ridiculous. It's very possible. I've seen it happen before.
DR. ROBERTS
Where?!
MR. FOLEY
In Montreal. [the rest of the convention laughs louder]
DR. ROBERTS
And where, pray, is this "Montreal"?!
MR. FOLEY
[determined] Look, I know how to handle this. All we have to do is bring down the kingpin and the rest will fall. You'll see! I'll have it taken care of in a matter of weeks!
DR. ROBERTS
Uhyub-dub very well, Mr. Foley, you go on your wild goosechase and meanwhile, we'll deal with the real problems at hand. [points at the chicken-squirrel]
MR. FOLEY
Well, I will! [leaves his seat and heads out the door]
DR. ROBERTS
[chuckles] Anyway, the half-chicken/half-squirrel would most likely be about three to four-and-a-half feet tall. His large beak is probably detachable, and works as a flotation device.
[South Park Elementary, day. Lunchtime in the cafeteria]
BOY
[off-camera] Here! Here, over here, look! Look what I got- I got from the chef! [the main cafeteria doors fly open and in walk the foursome. Kenny is dressed in a baby-blue suit with hat and cane, Cartman wears a floor-length tiger-fur coat, Stan wears a formal blue suit, and Kyle wears a book- reads a book and wears a black suit. As they walk through the cafeteria kids turn and stare. Among them are Bebe, Butters, and Wendy. The boys enter the kitchen]
CHEF
Hello there, children.
THE BOYS
Hey, Chef.
STAN
We all want double-desserts today!
CHEF
Oh. Well, uh, I'm afraid that the school charges extra for that.
CARTMAN
Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a thang. [tosses Chef a wad of bills]
CHEF
[surprised, fumbles with the wad] Oh my God! There has got to be at least fifteen dollars here!
CARTMAN
That's right. Keep the change, my man.
CHEF
Well! Look at you cute little crackers! With your money and your fancy clothes and your cell phones, it's almost like you were- [realizes where this is headed] Oh my God, children! What have I told you about drugs?!
THE BOYS
That there's a time and a place for everything, and it's called "college."
CHEF
That's right. And the only thing worse than doin' drugs is dealin' drugs! I'm gonna tell you about when I was your age and got offered drugs. [A flashback to Chef's 8th year. He's walking down the street with his little girlfriend, a Hawaiian wearing a flower in her hair]
LITTLE CHEF
Ooo, come on, now.
KID 1
[all in blue] Hey, kid. You wanna try some dope?
GIRL
What?
KID 1
Come on, kid. Don't you wanna get high?
LITTLE CHEF
Hey, man, I don't need dope. Let me sing you a little song:
I can't wait until I grow up
and my weenie get big and strong
'Cause when it does I'm gonna bust
And make love to you Amanda all night long
I'm gonna make love to y'Amanda in about ten years!
KID 3
[olive complexion] What?
KID 2
[with the A shirt] What the hell is he talking about?
LITTLE CHEF
[to Amanda, who's surprised] And that toothpick is gonna turn into an oak tree,...
STAN
U-uh, Chef.
LITTLE CHEF
I'ma knock ya down, knock ya up,...
STAN
Chef!
LITTLE CHEF
...knock ya over, an' knock ya all around.
STAN
CHEF!
CHEF
Uh?
STAN
We're not dealing drugs!
CHEF
You're not?
STAN
No!
CHEF
Oh, uh weh-ell, children, whatever you're doin', just remember this: havin' money may seem fun, but... [tries to find a moral] Ooh, uh-oh, never mind.
THE BOYS
Thanks, Chef. [they leave]
KYLE
See ya.
CHEF
Damn, that little Amanda was fine! I'm gonna look her up. [reaches under the counter for a phone and dials away]
[The boys return to the cafeteria with their food]
STAN
Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!
CARTMAN
Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?
STAN
We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses.
CARTMAN
Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family!
KYLE
[still reading] Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality.
CARTMAN
Sure, Kyle.
[Loogie's restaurant, night. Loogie's talking to someone on his cell phone at table]
LOOGIE
They're what?! They're not gonna pay me? Who the hell do they think they are? I want those South Park kids dead! I want their families dead! I want their houses burned to the ground! [Mr. Foley enters; Loogie hangs up and does a falsetto] Oh, hi there, Mister. My mommy and daddy are out front, if you need 'em.
MR. FOLEY
Let's cut the crap, kid. My name is Tom Foley. I'm with the American Dental Association.
LOOGIE
Sit down, Mr. Foley. Do you want some spaghetti?
MR. FOLEY
[sits] No thanks, I just brushed. I just wanted to let you know that I'm onto you.
LOOGIE
I told the ADA a thousand times: I know nothing about teeth. I'm just an 8-year-old boy who likes climbing trees and playing in puddles.
MR. FOLEY
I am going to find out who the boss is! And when I do I'm gonna bust his ass and everyone's ass who helped hide his ass! [having run out of things to say, he turns and walks out. Loogie resumes eating]
[Cartman's house, day, living room. He is seated behind a desk talking to a boy]
CARTMAN
So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China.
ODD BOY
[an anxious kid with oval head and big eyes] That's right, yeah [plops the bag on the desk] . It's all top-grade stuff, too.These Chinese kids are selling their teeth for peanuts, see?
CARTMAN
[takes a scope out and analyzes a tooth] How much?
ODD BOY
Well, huh, Tang Li wants 30, but, but I can cut you a deal for 28, yeh ha, buh. Heh, ha-buh, what do you say, huh? [smiles]
CARTMAN
Can I ask you a question, Weasel?
WEASEL
[the odd boy] Awuh, hawuh, why, sure, sure.
CARTMAN
[rests his scope] Do you think I'm an idiot?
WEASEL
Huh?
CARTMAN
These are cat teeth, you sonofabitch! You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat teeth?! [Weasel starts acting like a monkey. Kyle is seen reading another book] Get out of my sight! [Weasel hops off the chair and splits] Lousy little scum! [the phone rings] What?!
BOY 2
[on the phone. His mates have Kenny on a bridge railing, ready to dump him] This is your last chance, kid! Either you give the boss his cut, or else we're gonna throw your pal into the river wearing concrete galoshes!
CARTMAN
I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not afraid of you! [hangs up]
KYLE
Oh my God, this book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one.
[The river. Boy 2 hangs up]
BOY 2
He's not gonna do it?!
KENNY
(He's not gonna do it?!) [looks over as Boy 2 places a call]
BOY 2
He's not gonna do it, boss!
LOOGIE
Well then, throw him in. [Boy 2 gives the signal]
BOY 1
Alright, kid. Time to die. [he and his partner each grab a hold of an arm]
KENNY
(No! Nono! No! Don't do this! Nononooo!) [the two boys shove him off. Kenny lands in the river, but hits bottom before even getting wet. He looks down and attempts a few steps. The others look down from the bridge.]
BOY 2
Oh, man, how deep is the Platte River?
[News report, night]
ANCHOR
...to which Ms. Clinton replied, "I don't even like Vagina." Finally tonight, a human-interest story. Dan Akawa is live.
DAN AKAWA
[field reporter, next to a family] Thanks, Tom. I'm here at the house of little Billy Circlovich, um. Billy is in desperate need of a bone-marrow transplant [Billy strokes his nose] or he will most certainly die. [addresses the boy] Billy, how much more money do you need for the transplant? [puts the mic in front of Billy]
BILLY
[almost whispering] Sih, six hundred dollar-. [the reporter jerks the mic away]
DAN AKAWA
Louder, Billy, we can't hear ya!
BILLY
[trembling] Duh six hundred dohollars.
DAN AKAWA
Well, that's a lot of money.How the hell are you gonna get all that in the short amount of time you have left?
BILLY
Well, I a-I don't know.
DAN AKAWA
Well, Billy, I also understand that you lost a tooth today.
BILLY
Yehahah.
DAN AKAWA
Billy, we want you to put that tooth under your pillow tonight, because we have a feeling that the tooth fairy [points to Billy's parents and winks at the camera] is going to leave you six hundred dollars for it!
BILLY
Really?
MR. CIRCLOVICH
Really?
DAN AKAWA
Yes, really. [hands Dad the money; he passes it to Mom. Billy grins] Six hundred dollars. I might also mention that Billy lives in Crestview Apartments, just off Arapaho Road on Emporia Street. Back to you, Tom. [print!] How was that?
MR. FOLEY
[standing with two other dentists and the field crew] Perfect. The trap is set.
CAMERAMAN
Naw, come on. D'ya really think anyone will fall for somethin' that stupid?
[The Cartman house. Cartman is in a hot tub, Stan and Kyle sit nearby]
CARTMAN
Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together! [leaves the tub] This is gonna be tits!
KYLE
[to Stan] Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?
CARTMAN
[returns] Will somebody take those books away from him?
[The Circlovich house, night. A Rotary Phone Service van sits out front. Switch to Billy's room. Dad hides the $600 behind his back while Mom talks to Billy]
MRS, CIRCLOVICH
Be sure to put your loose tooth under your pillow, Billy.
BILLY
Okay-y, Mom. [turns and hops on the bed. Outside, a periscope rises from the van roof and looks around]
MR. FOLEY
[in the van, moves the viewer aside] Thank you for helping out, gentlemen. [walks up to the other dentists and a technician] If this sting operation works, some bogus tooth fairies should be showing up to take the sick kid's money. When they touch the kid's pillow, an alarm will sound, and that's when you hit the button, Murphy, and activate the lights. Everybody got it?
DENTISTS
Got it.
MURPHY
[the technician, acting dumb] Duuuh, which button do I hit again, boss? [Foley isn't laughing, so Murphy chuckles] Just kidding. You know how there's always the dumb guy in sting operations in the movies? I was, you know I was actin', I was actin' like him, eheh, oh.
[The highway, night. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle walk along a path paralleling the highway. Cartman is dressed as the tooth fairy.]
CARTMAN
Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does.
KYLE
I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist!
STAN
Dude, just stop thinking about it.
KYLE
But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together? [the boys pass the Platter River]
KENNY
[still in the river in the distance] (You guys! You guys, over here! ...Hey!)
KYLE
Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down, [(Heeyy!!)] and my own existence fading.
[The Circlovich house, the van.]
BILLY
[heard in the van] G'night, Mom. G'night, Dad.
MR. FOLEY
Alright. Everyone, keep your eyes peeled. [everyone suits up in riot gear. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle arrive at Billy's bedroom. Cartman is quickly hoisted up as Billy's parents come to kiss him]
BILLY
I'm going to bed now, Mommy. I put my tooth under the pillow. Do you really think the tooth fairy will give me money for the transplant?
MR. CIRCLOVICH
I think so, Billy. I think so.
BILLY
Well, I can't wait to feel healthy and strong again.
CARTMAN
[thinking aloud] Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine!
KYLE
Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave. [Cartman opens the window and floats in grinning] Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening! [begins to disappear]
STAN
[noticing the silence] Kyle?
MURPHY
Eh something strange is happening with the computers. [Stan looks at the space in which Kyle once stood]
LOOGIE
[shows up with his mob] Well, well, well. What do we have here?
STAN
[notices] Aw, shit.
LOOGIE
Did you bastards really think you could hide from me forever? Kolovski [Boy 1 steps forward], put this buttwipe out of his misery. [Kolovski reaches into his jacket]
CARTMAN
[retrieves the cash] I got it!
BILLY
[opens his eyes and rises] The tooth fairy! [the alarms go off.]
MR. FOLEY
Let's move out! [exits the van with the other dentists]
LOOGIE
Aw, drat! [the dentists close in]
MR. FOLEY
Give it up, kids. You're surrounded by dentists.
LOOGIE
It was a trap!
MR. FOLEY
That's right. And now it's all exposed! You're through! The only thing left to do is to haul all you kids down to prison! [the other dentists move in closer]
A VOICE
This is reality! I am everywhere [Kyle's head, undulating, appears], and nowhere.
MR. FOLEY
What the hell?
CARTMAN
Kyle?
KYLE
I am nothing, and everything.
[Everything and everyone begin to undulate with Kyle's head and scream and groan. Next, Kyle's fetus (with hat) is seen floating against a starry sky. Then, his head flies over a desert, and images from his past clock in: a deer, a skip-loader, a mailbox, a slice of Swiss cheese. Back at Billy's house, the images are: Kyle's head, a boombox, Kyle's head, a frog, Kyle's head, a cow, Kyle's head, a tricycle, Kyle's head, a four-assed monkey, Kyle's head. The half-chicken/half-squirrel shows up as Kyle's head disappears for the last time, and scares everyone]
DR. ROBERTS
Well, I told you! [the chicken-squirrel goes after the dentists, and the kids disperse]
MR. FOLEY
Let's get outta here! [leaves with his group. Everyone scatters. Stan, Cartman, and Loogie remain in the backyard, and Billy grins with the $600 back in his hands. Kyle reappears in front of them]
KYLE
Hunh. That was pretty weird.
LOOGIE
Jesus! The little sick kid was a setup all along! [Billy drops from his bed and walks away] How could I be so stupid?!
STAN
What?
LOOGIE
I can't believe I fell for such an obvious trap! What the hell is wrong with me?!
CARTMAN
Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face.
LOOGIE
Oh well. Maybe it's good my empire has fallen.
STAN
Really?
LOOGIE
Yeah. I kinda wanted to play in the flag football team this year anyways.
STAN
So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?
LOOGIE
Naah. In a way, I'm just glad the whole thing's over with.
KYLE
Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us.
CARTMAN
...Tits.
[The Platte River, day. Kenny has turned to his left. As the end credits roll, Kenny tries with great effort to make his way to a bank. He hops a few times and lands in a hidden gully in which he promptly drowns. A motorized chair is soon heard]
TIMMY
[zipping by on the road above] Timmy!
End of The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Cartman is pursued by the FBI for committing a hate crime and lands in juvenile hall.

script:Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000

[South Park Elementary, Monday during the day. The kids are out on the playground. The camera pans to the right, showing kids on the hobby elephants, the swings, and the jungle gym. It rests on Butters holding a starting flag.]
BUTTERS
Wuh-okay! You guys ready up there!?
SLEDDER
[three teams of four boys apiece] Ready!
BUTTERS
On your marks! Get set! Uh-go! [the teams head down the small hill, and Cartman's team finishes first]
STAN
We win again! [all get off their sleds]
TOLKIEN
That's not fair! Cartman's ass is so fat he makes your sled go faster!
CARTMAN
Ey! Don't call me fat, Tolkien!
LIZZY
We want to use the sleds now, butt pirates!
STAN
Sleds are for guys.
CARTMAN
Yeah! Why don't you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or something?!
LIZZY
These are the school's sleds, ass rammers, not yours!
STAN
Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else.
THE REST OF THE BOYS
Yeah!
LIZZY
I bet we can sled ten times better than you, doughnut punchers!
KYLE
Oh yeah?!
THE GIRLS
Yeah!
CARTMAN
We'd kick your girlie ass in sledding!
LIZZY
How about a race down a real hill, then?!
THE GIRLS
Yeah!
STAN
You got it!
THE REST OF THE BOYS
Yeah!
A FEW OTHERS
Yeah!
LIZZY
Your best four sledders against our best four sledders!
STAN
No problem!
LIZZY
Then we'll see you this Saturday on Phil Collins Hill!
KYLE
Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it!
LIZZY
See you there! And may the best woman win, turd burglars!
STAN
Oh, boy! We'll show them!
BUTTERS
Yeah. Oo-oo-why, us men will show those skanky hos who's who!
CLYDE
Yeah. Those girls don't realize what good sledders Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are.
TOLKIEN
Yeah! And with Cartman's enormously fat ass, the boys are sure to win!
CARTMAN
Tolkien, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time [walks to a rock and picks it up] I'm gonna smack you on the head with this rock! [Kyle draws near to Tolkien]
KYLE
Fatass.
CARTMAN
There! [chucks the rock and it knocks Tolkien down]
TOLKIEN
Oh! [falls face first into the snow. Kyle is stunned that Cartman followed through]
CARTMAN
[sees what he's done] Heh. Huh. Uh-oh.
[Mr. Mackey's office, some time later. Eric and Tolkien are seated inside. Tolkien's right arm is in a sling and his right eye is blackened]
MR. MACKEY
And what you need to understand is that this is not appropriate behavior, young man! M'kay?
LIANE
Eric, don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend?
CARTMAN
[dragging the words] I'm sorry, Mom.
LIANE
Don't apologize to us, apologize to him!
CARTMAN
[dragging the words] I'm sorry, Tolkien.
MR. MACKEY
Well, I hope you learned that throwing rocks at people is bad, Eric.
CARTMAN
Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking? [drops from his chair] The only thing I can do now... is try to go on and live day by day. [turns and heads for the door] See ya later.
MR. MACKEY
[raises his index finger] Not this time, Eric! You've got to learn to respect your little friends! You're gonna have detention for two weeks!
CARTMAN
No way!
MR. MACKEY
Yes way! M'kay, and that settles it! Now, let's all go- [the door opens and two suits enter]
MAN 1
Counselor Mackey?
MR. MACKEY
Yes?
MAN 1
I'm Agent Sharp and this is Agent Keen. We're with [with gravity] the FBI.
AGENT KEEN
We're here to investigate the rock-throwing incident.
MR. MACKEY
Nn-um. m'kay, uh, I've already taken care of it; Eric Cartman here is gonna be punished with two weeks of detention.
AGENT SHARP
I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that, Mr. School Counselor. You see, since the victim in this case is African-American, this is considered [close-up] a hate crime. [Everyone all stares at Cartman]
CARTMAN
...What the hell is a hate crime?
MR. MACKEY
Uh, oh, but I don't think this is a ruh-
AGENT KEEN
New laws have been passed that make any crime based on race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation a federal offense. [Everyone all stares at Cartman again]
CARTMAN
What? A federal offense?
MR. MACKEY
Oh no.
CARTMAN
Oh no??
AGENT KEEN
We're sorry, Ms. Cartman, but we must follow protocol. [grabs a hold of Cartman] Your son will be taken into custody and then tried in the federal court of law. [the two agents walk out with Cartman]
LIANE
Oh my goodness.
[Trial TV, Tuesday. The letters fly into place over blind Justice holding the scales]
ANNOUNCER
The hate crime trial of the century is underway [Cartman is shown] on Court TV tracks U van. [Tolkien is shown]. Live. Here's your host, Leslie Smith.
LESLIE
What turns a normal, fat little eight-year-old boy into a vicious, hate-crime-committing racist? We take you live to the courtroom [the courthouse is shown] as the defendant takes the stand.
[The courtroom. The prosecutor grills Cartman]
PROSECUTOR
Mr. Cartman, do you know a boy by the name of "Tolkien?"
CARTMAN
Uh, yes?
PROSECUTOR
Who is Tolkien?
CARTMAN
He's a black kid that goes to my school?
PROSECUTOR
[outraged] Black?! Did you say black?! You called him black?!
CARTMAN
He is black.
PROSECUTOR
O! [turns to the audience] He said it again! [the audience gasps] He is African-American, and so you decided to pick him out!
CARTMAN
I did?
PROSECUTOR
The rage built and built inside your head until it became too much because you hate African-Americans!!
CARTMAN
No! I hate hippies!
PROSECUTOR
What?
CARTMAN
I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about "protectin' the earth" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!
LIANE
[behind the defense area] Oo, poopiekins?
PROSECUTOR
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is why we have hate-crime laws! This "monster" committed a crime—not against an individual, but against a race! Do the democratic thing and send his fat little butt to prison!
CARTMAN
[off camera] Ey! Don't call me fat, asshole!
PROSECUTOR
[faces the audience and judge] The prosecution rests.
LIZZY
[walks in with Bebe, stops next to Stan and Kyle] Don't forget: we still have that sledding race this Saturday, pillow biters. [turns around and walks away]
STAN, KYLE
We know!
STAN
Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice.
[The courtroom, some time later. A verdict has been reached, and the Judge announces it.]
JUDGE
Eric Cartman, you have been found guilty of committing a hate crime. For this, I hereby sentence you to the Alamosa Juvenile Hall, until you turn twenty-one.
CARTMAN
No!
JUDGE
I am making an example of you, to send a message out to people everywhere: that if you want to hurt another human being, you'd better make damn sure they're the same color as you are! [Cartman stares blankly back at the Judge, Stan and Kyle look at each other] Court is adjourned! [gavels one last time.]
THE GIRLS
[Bebe, Lizzy, and Red jump for joy.] Woohoo! Hooray!
JUDGE
Bailiffs, escort this little bastard to Juvenile Hall.
BLACK BAILIFF
Yes, sir. [they turn to face Cartman]
WHITE BAILIFF
Alright, you! ...Uh-uh-uh, where'd he go? [Cartman has disappeared, leaving a fallen chair behind]
[Kenny's house. Cartman rushes up to it and pounds on the front door. Kenny opens the door]
CARTMAN
[jumping excitedly] Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town!
KENNY
(What the fuck for?!)
CARTMAN
They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!
KENNY
(Mexico?! Why the heck do I have to take you all the way to Mexico?!)
CARTMAN
[slaps Kenny] Calm down, Kenny!
KENNY
(Hey!)
CARTMAN
Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?!
KENNY
(Yes.)
CARTMAN
Well, come on! I don't have much time! [heads for the garage. Outside, the garage door opens and a tiny truck creaks out with Kenny at the wheel and Cartman in the back seat]
[News Flash: "High Speed Chase"]
ANCHOR
A car chase is evolving on the 285 corridor east of South Park! Hate-crime suspect Eric Cartman is trying to outrun federal prosecutors in his friend's Go-Go Action Bronco! Our Eye in the Sky Greg Nimins is there live. Greg?
GREG NIMINS
["NEWS 4 LIVE!"] Tom, it looks like the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading east on 285. Police officers are right behind him [in a single line, creeping] but as with any chase, they're keeping a safe distance to avoid any accidents here out on the highway. [Kenny takes a transition road off to his right] Tom, it looks like the fugitive is going to make a bold move off an exit off 285. He's going into a residential neighborhood now; this is where it could get dangerous, as there are pedestrians about.
[In the Go-Go Action Bronco]
CARTMAN
Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?!
KENNY
[looks back] (Why don'tcha keep your head down?!) [Cartman ducks]
[back to the report]
GREG NIMINS
Tom, the police have set a roadblock right where the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading. [they have also enlisted the fire department's help] This could be the final stand-off.
POLICEMAN 1
[holds his hand up for a halt] Alright, that's far enough. Stop the Go-Go Action Bronco and come out with your hands up. [the Bronco keeps going] Just bring it to a stop and come on out. [the Bronco keeps going] Jeezus, he's gonna ram it! [the officers dive for cover and Kenny pushes into the two cars blocking his way. Slowly, tons of steel give way before the puny Bronco, and Kenny and Cartman break through the blockade. The Bronco leaves and the officers get up.] Crazy son of a bitch.
[News Flash: Continuing coverage. Stan and Kyle watch the news flash at Stan's house]
GREG NIMINS
Well, it's been over thirteen hours now, and still the car chase has not ended. [eight cars are shown in four rows of two following the little Go-Go Action Bronco.]
KYLE
What the hell are they doing?
GREG NIMINS
The chase has now moved through most of Arizona and nears the Mexican border.
STAN
Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?
KYLE
Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon. [the camera zooms out to show two lines of police cars following closely behind Kenny and Cartman. At least 22 cars are shown]
[The Arizona desert]
CARTMAN:
We're gonna make it, Kenny! We're gonna make it to Mexico! [the little Bronco crawls to a dead stop.] Oh, God dammit! [the police cars rush in and the first one bumps the Bronco down the road. The others run into the first one and pile on. A few cars fly over and crash]
[Stan's house. The phone rings]
STAN
[answers] Hello?
LIZZY
Just a friendly reminder: Cartman's going to jail and you've got four days until the race, rump rangers!
STAN
Son of a bitch!
[A truck arrives at the main gates of a prison in the desert. The gates part and the truck enters]
DRIVER
Here we are, the end of the road. Alamosa Maximum Security Juvenile Hall.
[A clown face greets the truck and the double doors open. Officers line up and Cartman gets a good look at the inmates. Two kids are using weights, a third sits brooding, an angry African-American boy stands next to another brooding kid. Four kids play basketball, with the blond one having blood in his hair. Two kids play tic-tac-toe, and two others play tetherball. Cartman looks again and sees a sign saying, "Gruffy Bear sez: Try to escape and we'll shoot you where you stand." Two soldiers pace the catwalk above. Cartman looks again, and three boys beat a fourth over a football. A kid in nothing but briefs puts on airs while smoking. Cartman looks again and three babies play with blocks under an officer's semiautomatic. The babies are chained to each other]
[A few moments later, and Cartman is in an orange prison suit being admitted]
WARDEN
Prisoner 24601, arriving. [Cartman enters holding some bedding] Forward, prisoner! You will wake up each morning at 0500. [leads him in] Lockdown is until 0900. At ten we begin random searches and checks for contraband. [they pass through a security door into the mess hall] At 11:30 we have naptime, followed by finger-painting. Your cellmate is Romper Stomper! [the other kids look up and gasp]
CARTMAN
Huh-who's Romper Stomper?
ROMPER STOMPER
[steps into the aisle] I am! [His feet are shown with yellow pails underneath them. Cartman turns, and a menacing kid with a teardrop tattoo under the left eye looks back at him] And I don't want no new cellmate!
WARDEN
[Cartman hides behind him] You don't have a choice, Stomper! Now, show this new prisoner the ropes!
ROMPER STOMPER
Oh, I will! [steps forward on his pails] You bet your ass I will.
[Wednesday, Phil Collins Hill, practice run. Elevation: 9436 feet. The boys in the class are gathered at the summit with Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. Phil Collins' face is the hill's defining geographic feature]
STAN
Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday.
KYLE
Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman. [The others look around at each other]
STAN
Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?
BUTTERS
...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid.
CLYDE
Huh?
KYLE
Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde.
CLYDE
I'm not fat.
STAN
Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid.
KYLE
Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!
CLYDE
[sits on the back end of the sled] Hey, I'm not fat, you guys. I'm just kind of big-boned.
STAN
Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go! [he, Kyle, and Kenny push off and then hop on as the sled picks up speed. The rest of the kids cheer them on]
KYLE
[as the sled stops] Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move.
LIZZY
[her team's sled passes the boys by] See you Saturday, poo sniffers!
STAN
[looks back at Clyde] Nice going, fat boy!
[Alamosa Juvenile Hall. Some of the kids gather around Cartman.]
ROMPER STOMPER
Well, well, well. New fish. How about you come up with a reason why we don't break your arms?!
INMATES
Yeah!
CARTMAN
Uh... 'Cause I'm just like you guys. Uh-I'm one of you.
ROMPER STOMPER
Oh yeah? The way I see it, there's two kinds of kids in the world: kids who like Animaniacs, and kids who don't like Animaniacs. You're either with us, or you're against us. So which are you?!
CARTMAN
Oh, uh, well, personally, I... uhuhuhuh, I... don't like Animaniacs?
ROMPER STOMPER
[after some thought] ...Neither do we
CARTMAN
[softly] Oh, thank you, Jesus. [normally] So we're friends now?
ROMPER STOMPER
No! There's no friends in the Big House! You come in with nobody and you leave with nobody. We don't believe in "friends."
INMATES
Yeah!
CARTMAN
Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck.
ROMPER STOMPER
Now, go find me some cigarettes and I'll tell you how to bust out of here.
[Phil Collins Hill, second practice run. Kyle and Kenny add the finishing touches to something on the sled]
STAN
Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks [points to them], but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!
PIP
Oh, that's a wonderful idea.
CLYDE
So I don't get to be on the team now?
ALL THE BOYS
Shut up, fatass!
KYLE
Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?! [Clyde glares back]
STAN
Come on, let's get it a try. [he and Kyle get on, and Kenny starts the sled and gets on,]
KENNY, STAN
Woopee!
STAN
Yeah-
STAN, KENNY, KYLE
Wo-o-o-o-oh! [they lose control of the sled and start spinning]
STAN
[to Kyle] Dude, bail! Bail! [they jump off, leaving Kenny with the brick rider. They end up face down]
KENNY
(Huh? Uh.) [the sled hits a rock, tossing him through the air] (AAAAAA!) [slams into a tree and sticks] (Ufff!) [the brick rider slams into him, killing him] (Ugh!)
STAN
[looks up] Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny.
KYLE
We killed Kenny?
STAN
We Killed Kenny. We're bastards. [they walk up to the tree and stand in front of the puddle of blood]
KYLE
Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?
STAN
Nothing else is gonna work. [the rest of the boys converge on the tree] We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.
BUTTERS
Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!
PIP
This is a sad day for men everywhere.
STAN
You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted.
ALL THE BOYS
Yeup.
KYLE
If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.
BUTTERS
Well, all that time we didn't understand what a... unique and magical ass it was.
LIZZY
[arrives and steps off the sled] Woohoo. Great time, girls. [notices Kenny flattened against the tree] Oh, gee. Looks like you lost another sledder. Good luck on Saturday, doughnut punchers! [walks away with her sled and the three other girls]
STAN
That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!
SOME BOYS
Oh?
OTHER BOYS
[simultaneous] Huh?
KYLE
How?
STAN
I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.
KYLE
Sweet! Let's go!
THE GROUP
Hooray! Alright! Here we go!
[Alamosa Juvenile Hall, Thursday. Visiting hours 10:00 to 2:00. Relatives have come to visit the inmates]
MOTHER 1
And have you been brushing your teeth?
BOY 1
Yes, Mommy.
MOTHER 1
And not dropping your soap?
BOY 1
Yes, Mommy.
BOY 2
Hi, Mom.
MOTHER 2
Young man, that is the fourth time you've been late for our visiting time; you are grounded.
BOY 2
Grounded? Oh, no! Um, wait... [Cartman has no visitors yet]
GUARD
[leads Kyle and Stan to Cartman] Here you go, boys. Keep it short.
CARTMAN
Hey you guys.
KYLE
[he and Stan take their seats] Hey, fatass. How's prison?
CARTMAN
Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think?
STAN
Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!
KYLE
Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here. [lowers his voice] So we made you this cake. [lifts it onto the counter, and it reads, "Get Out Soon, Cartman"] There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.
CARTMAN
A what?
KYLE
[softly] An ailnay ilefay.
CARTMAN
Wwhat's that?
KYLE
Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!

STAN
...Yeah.
CARTMAN
[a guard walks past him] Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?
KYLE
Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-
CARTMAN
Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!
STAN
Sshh! [the guard looks over]
CARTMAN
Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race, [hushed] then I need those cigarettes.
STAN
How are we supposed to give them to you?
CARTMAN
Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.
STAN
But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.
CARTMAN
I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass. [Stan and Kyle look at him and bust out laughing] Shut up, you guys! It's not funny!
STAN
Alright, here. [pulls some out and slips them through the holes one by one. The guard checks his watch and Cartman packs his ass]
CARTMAN
Well, okay... here... l'see...
STAN
Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.
KYLE
Me too.
CARTMAN
Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now. [leaves the visiting area]
KYLE
Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals. [he and Stan laugh]
CARTMAN
[at the door] Hahah. Very funny, you guys, hahah. [the guard opens the door and Cartman walks in]
[Alamosa Juvenile Hall, outside the main gate. Stan and Kyle exit and Stan sets the cake on the ground.]
STAN
That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file. [pulls it out]
KYLE
So now what do we do?
STAN
There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!
[Alamosa Juvenile Hall, Cartman's cell. He enters]
ROMPER STOMPER
[reading a book, looks up] Well, did you get the cigarettes?
CARTMAN
Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass.
ROMPER STOMPER
Alright. Go sit on the toilet and poop them out. I'll keep an eye out for the guards. [Cartman does as told and starts groaning]
CARTMAN
Engh. Egh. Uuuh, stupid cigarettes. [groans some more until a plop is heard] There's one. [groans and screams until a second plop is heard] There's two. [more groans] Come on! Uugh, come on, now! Come on, uuhhhgghh [plop] yeahhh. Hoh. Phew. [flushes the toilet and Romper looks up horrified] Hoh. ...Oh, God-damnit! [walks back to Romper crestfallen]
ROMPER STOMPER
You flushed them?!
CARTMAN
Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here.
ROMPER STOMPER
No way, douche. I told you: I ain't your friend. If you want me to help you, you're gonna have to sneak something else in for me.
CARTMAN
Son of a bitch!
[South Park, Friday during the day. Stan and Kyle get off a bus onto an affluent part of town]
KYLE
Dude, I didn't know Tolkien lived so far away.
STAN
Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.
KYLE
Yeah. But isn't Tolkien the only one?
STAN
Yeah. [they walk up to the front door of a nice house. Kyle rings the bell]
LINDA BLACK
[answering] Hello?
STAN
Hi. Can Token come out and play?
LINDA BLACK
Well, his head is still a little sore, but you can come in, if you like. [the boys enter]
KYLE
Killer.
STAN
[sees Tolkien] Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?
TOLKIEN
No.
KYLE
Well then, [Tolkien begins to move away. Kyle holds his shoulder, but moves with him. Stan follows] you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!
TOLKIEN
Yeah.
STEVE BLACK
I'm afraid it's not that simple, boys.
STAN
It's not?
STEVE BLACK
No. You see, the only person that can let Eric out of Juvenile Hall is the governor.
KYLE
Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit! [remembers where he is] Oh, sorry.
STEVE BLACK
No, I'd, actually agree with you.
KYLE
Huh?
STEVE BLACK
Yeah. I have a real problem.with hate-crime legislation. In fact, I'd love to see you kids go down and give the governor a piece of my mind.
STAN
Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?
STEVE BLACK
Oh, he wouldn't listen to me.
KYLE
Why not?
STEVE BLACK
Because I'm black.
STAN, KYLE
Oh.
STEVE BLACK
Sit down, boys. I'm gonna give you a little lesson about hate-crime laws. [leads them away]
[Alamosa Juvenile Hall. Cartman is at the toilet pooping something else. Romper is reading]
CARTMAN
[moans and tries until a small splash is heard] Oh, thank God! Oh, thank you, Jesus, uh! Hoh. [walks in with a box and tosses it on the ground] Here you go, God-damnit!
ROMPER STOMPER
[tosses his book away and stands up] Cool! My very own Tic-Tac-Throw game. [picks it up] Ew, it smells, man.
CARTMAN
Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here!
ROMPER STOMPER
You're not gonna break out of here! You're here 'til you're 21, douche!
CARTMAN
But you said-
ROMPER STOMPER
I just wanted you to sneak stuff in for me. What? You actually think I give a crap about you?
CARTMAN
I thought that-
ROMPER STOMPER
Hneah. You'd better wise up to the way things work in the big house. [walks to the cell door] Hey guys! I gots me a new Tic-Tac-Throw [Cartman, forsaken, begins to cry] Yeah, it's a little ripe, but it's brand new, man! You can play it at recess. [turns to Cartman] Hey. Uh, what are you doing? [Cartman cries some more] You... you can't cry in prison, man. They'll bust your head open. What's the matter with you?!
CARTMAN
I want my Mo-omm [cries some more and rubs his eyes]
ROMPER STOMPER
Dude. [walks up to Cartman]
CARTMAN
Mommy, I want my Mommy! [continues crying]
ROMPER STOMPER
Look, if it's that important to you, I'll bust you out of here.
CARTMAN
You will?
ROMPER STOMPER
Yeah. ...Yyeah, I will. Uh-but not because you're my friend. Only because... because I wanna bust out, too. Anh-anh, and see Disneyland.
[The governor's office, day. An aide peeks in]
AIDE
Governor, the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee is here to see you?
GOVERNOR
Naw, not another committee. Send them in. [Stan, Kyle, and Tolkien enter. Kyle carries a boombox and Tolkien an easel with their presentation on it. They set up] This is the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee?
TOLKIEN
Yeah.
GOVERNOR
Well, boys, what can I do for you?
STAN
[to Kyle] Okay, go ahead and start.
KYLE
I don't start, you start.
STAN
Oh, uhyeah. [walks to the easel and clears his throat] Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, "Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy." [shows the title page. Kyle presses the play button for some ambiance] Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.
TOLKIEN
[flips a page to depict a stabbing in progress] If somebody kills somebody, it's a crime. But if someone kills somebody of a different color, it's a hate crime.
KYLE
And we think that that is [flips the page to reveal a copy of the title page] a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?
STAN
[flips the page to reveal a person tagging City Hall] If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?
TOLKIEN
[flips the page to reveal a man being hit deliberately by a car] And motivation for a crime shouldn't affect the sentencing.
STAN
[flips the page to reveal warring groups of people around a question mark] Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same.
KYLE
[shows a rainbow of people holding hands] But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes [Stan flips the page to reveal their hate crime proposal]. For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we [flips the page to show them winning a sledding race] will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday.
STAN
That is our presentation. An idea that we call...
TOLKIEN
[flips the page to reveal another copy of the title page] "Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy." [Kyle turns the tape player off]
GOVERNOR
Hm. That made the most sense of any presentation I've heard in the last three years.
[Outside Alamosa Juvenile Hall, Friday night. Alarms sound and searchlights abound, indicating someone has broken out. Footsteps are heard, and Cartman and Romper climb over a hill]
ROMPER STOMPER
Hurry up! They're sending the dogs after us! [Cartman runs ahead, Romper trips on a rock] Mph. Oowww!
CARTMAN
[turns around] What's the matter?
ROMPER STOMPER
[looks up] It's my leg! I think it's broken. [looks back] You go on ahead without me.
CARTMAN
Uhokay. [turns and runs]
ROMPER STOMPER
Hey. [Cartman stops and turns] You're supposed to say, "I'm not going without you," or something.
CARTMAN
Oh. Really?
ROMPER STOMPER
Look, kid, you go on. You've got something to live out there. You've got friends.
CARTMAN
Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.
ROMPER STOMPER
I sure would have liked to have seen Disneyland. Here. I want you to have these. [offers his pails]
CARTMAN
Okay. [retrieves them]
ROMPER STOMPER
No! You're supposed to say, "I can't take these," or something, dumbass!
CARTMAN
Oh. I can't take these. [offers them back]
ROMPER STOMPER
Take them. They'll bring you luck. [looks back again] Now go on. Get out of here. [Cartman turns, walks some, and returns]
CARTMAN
Romper?
ROMPER STOMPER
Yeah?
CARTMAN
You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me.
GUARD
[shows up with other guards] Alright, freeze! [Cartman steps to Romper's side]
CARTMAN
You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!
GUARD
But you've been pardoned by the governor! [shows the document]
CARTMAN
[takes it] O ho ho, sweet. Later, dudes. [walks away]
[Phil Collins Hill, Saturday. The sledders are at the top of the run and other kids are at the finish line]
LIZZY
[at the front of the girls' sled] Well, come on! Are we racing or not?!
STAN
Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.
KYLE
He's gotta show up. He's just got to.
LIZZY
Come on, my feet are getting cold, fudge packers!
BEBE
Yeah. If you're too scared to race, just say so!
KYLE
Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him.
STAN
Alright, where's Clyde.
CLYDE
[steps up] Right here.
STAN
Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!
CLYDE
For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop calling me fat, God-damnit! [realizes he's responded as Cartman would, and covers his mouth with both hands]
KYLE
On the sled, fatass!
LIZZY
Okay, girls. Time to show the boys what we can do!
OTHER GIRLS
Yeah!
BUTTERS
[steps into place with the starting flags] Huh-okay. Uh-ready, uhset,-
CARTMAN
[Butters looks up] You guys! [runs over a hill into view and races towards the group]
STAN
It's Cartman!
BOY SLEDDERS
Hooray!
CARTMAN
That's right! I'm back! [Clyde walks over and hugs him, and he is surprised]
CLYDE
Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming back! [relief creeps in] Thank you so much. Thank you.
CARTMAN
What the hell's wrong with Clyde?
LIZZY
This is your last chance! Are we racing or not?!
STAN
All right! Let's do this!
BUTTERS
Okay. Everybody ready? On your marks.
CARTMAN
I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.
BUTTERS
Uh-get set. Go! [lowers the flags, and the girls shove off]
CARTMAN
Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside.
KYLE
Go, fatass!
CARTMAN
When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's-
TOLKIEN, KYLE, STAN
Go, fatass! [Cartman shoves the sled into motion and hops on]
STAN
Come on! We've gotta catch up to them! [the camera looks at the slope. The girls come down first, then the boys]
LIZZY
We've got' em, girls!
KYLE
Oh no! The girls are gonna win!
KIDS AT FINISH LINE
Go! You can do it! Come on!
STAN
We're not gonna make it! [Cartman thinks, then he remembers.]
CARTMAN
Hey. [pulls out the pails and tosses them at the girls' sled]
LIZZY
G'aaaaah! [the pails gum up the reins. The girls' sled veers off the run and over a cliff. The weightlessness causes the girls and sled to separate, and all fall scattered on the ground below. A brown bear comes up]
BEAR
Rowr. {carries Lizzy away]
BOY SLEDDERS
[crossing the finish line] Hooray!
STAN
We did it!
GIRLS
Awww. [walk away disappointed, leaving only one blonde carrying a sign: GIRLS RULE]
KYLE
We won! We won!
BUTTERS
Yeah. Why, we sure-uh gave those skanky bitches what for!
BOYS
Hooray!
KYLE
It's good to have you back, Cartman.
STAN
Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again.
CARTMAN
Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my friends for granted ever again.
PIP
Let's all hear it for Cartman's big, fat ass! [no one does. Cartman picks up a rock and throws it at him] Oh-ff. [falls on his face. The rock lands next to Cartman]
CARTMAN
Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?
STAN, KYLE, BUTTERS, TOLKIEN
Naah.
CARTMAN
Sweet.
[Alamosa Juvenile Hall, later, Romper's cell. He is reading]
GUARD
Hey! Romper Stomper! Get up! [Romper gets up] You got a visitor! [rolls the door aside and Cartman enters]
ROMPER STOMPER
Eric!
CARTMAN
Hey, Romper Stomper.
ROMPER STOMPER
Wow! I've never had a visitor before!
CARTMAN
Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too.
ROMPER STOMPER
You did? [Cartman goes to the door to make sure the guards are gone, then returns to Stomper]
CARTMAN
You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?
ROMPER STOMPER
Yeah. [Cartman walks off to the toilet]
CARTMAN
[begins grunting. A few moments later, and a grin breaks out on Stomper's face. A big splash follows] Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh.
ROMPER STOMPER
Whoa! [end credits roll]
CARTMAN
Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh. [splash. Romper is stunned] Ogh! Wait-
ROMPER STOMPER
Oh, yeah!
CARTMAN
[grunts some more] Uh, what else? [splash] Splash Mountain, that comes now-oh! [grunts some more, then, splash]
ROMPER STOMPER
Oh, the monorail!

synopsis:8-year-old contorting quintuplets from Romania defect to the United States and seek shelter with Stan's family.

script:Quintuplets 2000

[The Marsh house, night. Some of the families are gathered there]
RANDY
Okay, is everyone ready to go?
SHEILA
Oh, I'm so excited. I've always wanted to see Cirque du Cheville.
SHARON
Me too. We were lucky to get tickets. [calls out] Come on, boys! We're gonna be late. [the boys, dressed in their Sunday best, walk in with heads down in resentment]
LIANE
Oh, don't they look precious?
STAN
Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns
SHARON
No, Stanley. Cirque du Cheville is French-Canadian. They get acrobats and singers from all over the world and then do very artistic things..
KYLE
Awwww!
GRANDPA
[rolls up] Why the hell do you wanna take these boys to see that fufu French theater crap? You're gonna turn them into poofders!
SHARON
Dad, Stanley needs to see the arts!
GRANDPA
Well, he doesn't need to see a bunch of frogs prance around in tights and make-up wrappin' their peckers around each other's faces!
SHARON
Come on, everybody, let's go. [the others turn and head out the front door.]
GRANDPA
[follows] Close your eyes and cover your ears, Billy! Remember, you're a man.
[Cirque du Cheville, night. Folks are streaming in to get seats. Next, under the Big Top]
SHEILA
Oh, this is so exciting
SHARON
Oh, look at the funny clown, Stanley.
STAN
Where? [a clown appears next to him, and he looks up] Oh, no. [the clown pulls out an umbrella and a bicycle horn, squeezes the horn and gets showered by the umbrella. The adults laugh, and the clown offers him the umbrella] Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye. [the clown insists Stan take part, and the parents laugh at the sound of the horn] No, thank you. [the clown tries again] Go away, please.
CARTMAN
He doesn't want your dumbass umbrella, clown! Beat it! [Liane smacks him on the back of the head] Ow. [the clown tries once more with Stan. Stan rolls his eyes, takes the umbrella, and is showered by it when the clown presses the horn. The crowd roars with laughter as the clown revels in his cleverness]
RANDY
You didn't know that was gonna happen, did you, Stanley? [Stan looks up angrily]
CARTMAN
[comments] Oh, God, that was soo funny! Oh, man, somebody stop my guts from bursting out of my sides! [the clown gets mad as Cartman talks, then takes the umbrella from Stan and walks away in a huff]
ANNOUNCER
[affecting a French accent] Ladies and gentlemen, please, no smoking and no flash-photography during Sarque du Son Bleu.
CARTMAN
[echoes the announcer] Sarque du Son Bleu. [sticks his tongue out. A performer comes out and starts singing] Oho, we've reached fag factor 5, captain.
LIANE
Eric, sshhhh. [the performer is joined by men rolling by in wheels behind him and others prancing by in front. The parents smile in awe]
KYLE
How long does this thing last?
STAN
Two hours.
CARTMAN, KYLE, KENNY
Awwwgh.
[Cirque du Cheville, later. A troupe of twelve dancers leap high and drop down again. The parents are still in thrall, and their eyes follow the dancers' leaps. Cartman is now asleep. Some time elapses, and a singer sings her song. The other three boys are getting sleepy. The smiles are gone from the parents' faces. The singer is shown with a two-person high-wire act overhead. Little "birds" pop out from her dress and dance around. A new act appears, and Stan is looking away feeling bored. Kyle and Kenny seem more awake. An invisible man in a visible suit walks on, and a green man with big ears jumps out of the floor in front of him. The green man and the man shake hands, and the green man rips the man's right arm off. A new act comes on, and Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are really drowsy. The curtains open to reveal five girls, and they come forward to dance]
SHARON
Ooo, these are the contorting quintuplets from Romania. [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are curious. Each of the quints lays on her stomach and puts her feet over her back and on her head.]
KENNY
(Woohoo!) [Stan and Kyle stir, and Kyle nudges Cartman]
CARTMAN
Wha-what? Another gay guy in feathers? [the quints pile on to make an X, then roll off and reposition themselves into a circle]
KYLE
Whoa. [a few twirls, and the middle one is thrust into the air. The two girls on the outside leap up and land on the other two's heads and catch the middle girl, to form a pentagon. Then they form a large cat, then a yacht,...]
STAN
Damn, dude. [...then the Eiffel Tower, and finally, a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The crowd cheers]
STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
Yayy!
KENNY
(Oh yeah! Woohoo!)
[Cirque du Cheville, dismissal. The crowd exits the tent]
SHEILA
Oh, that was wonderful!
SHARON
Yes. Too bad it was their last show, or I'd go see it again.
KYLE
Those contorting Romanian chicks rule.
CARTMAN
Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine!
KYLE
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical!
CARTMAN
Not that second one from the left; she had it goin' on! [they pass "LE SOUVENIRS," a booth manned by a clown dressed in yellow.]
CLOWN
[the boys turn to see him] Don't forget to buy your souvenirs, folks. [the adults gather and clamor for the items on display. As they do, the boys talk]
STAN
Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?
CARTMAN
Yeah. I could prance around in little tights and sing opera too, for that kind of cash.
KYLE
Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville.
KENNY
(Yeah.)
STAN
Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over. [the boys turn to leave]
KYLE
Let's go practice. [they exit]
[Dressing Room #1. "Vladchick Contorting Quintuplets" is written over a star.]
GRANDMAMA
Hurry up, girls. We must bundle up against the cold.
A QUINT
Did we do good final show, Grandmama?
GRANDMAMA
Very good, my girls. I only wish it weren't your last show. I love this country so very much. [a knock on the dressing room door, and two stern men walk in]
ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
Mrs. Vladchick, it is time. It is time to return to Romania.
GRANDMAMA
Yes, yes, of course. Just give me vone second to finish getting them ready. [the men leave, and she looks to the dressing room window. She walks over, opens the window, turns, and] This way, girls. Quickly. [the girls head for the window. Grandmama lifts them out one by one.]
QUINT #2
Vhy are we going out the window, Grandmama?
GRANDMAMA
Your mother did not want you to grow up in Romania. This is our only chance. [drops the girl off outside]
ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
Nid kelmin da bushka.
ATTENDANT
Nid kelmin da lushka velt
ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
Nid kelmin da bushka ayn zolt! [the men laugh, the attendant looks at his watch]
ATTENDANT
M-Mrs. Vladchick? [the men enter and find the open window and no one at all]
ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
Dash fam da bushka!
[Cirque du Cheville, outside the main tent. The two Romanian men rush out]
ATTENDANT
They're trying to defect! [they rush up to the end of a dock just as Mrs. Vladchick and her granddaughters take off in a dinghy]
ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
[pumping a fist] Cauch! We need a boat. [sees two native men in a canoe, about to leave. He and the attendant walk over to them and gives one of the paddlers some money]
NATIVE PADDLER IN VEST
Where to, Mack?
ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
[gets on the canoe] Follow that boat. [the attendant gets on, and the four men paddle away]
[The Marsh house, living room. The boys have bought a CD of the show, and Kenny sings to the instrumental of one of the songs. Kenny is wearing the costume the first singer wore. The other three are practicing… um… Stan tries to leap into Kyle's arms, but they end up tumbling on the floor. Cartman runs forth and does some cartwheels, but lands on a coffee table, breaking it to pieces.]
STAN
Dude, this isn't working.
KYLE
It's Kenny's singing!
KENNY
(Hunh?)
CARTMAN
Yeah, Kenny, you have to sing better!
KENNY
(I'm singing as good as I can!)
STAN
Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again! [Grandpa rolls by and notices the boys in dance poses]
GRANDPA
Aha, I knew it. They turned you into poofders.
[Stark's Pond. Grandmama and the girls zoom away.]
ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
There's nowhere to go, Mrs. Vladchick. Pull over! [the canoe has caught up to the dinghy. Mrs. Vladchick looks back, then looks forward. They are closing in on a dock full of explosives, and she looks on in horror]
GRANDMAMA
Okay girls, the Cam Ay Alta. [the girls pile on Grandmama and form a tower, each female grabbing the head of the one below her. The top girl grabs a branch with a free hand, and all swing up in the air as one. The dinghy goes on with the canoe in pursuit]
ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
[In a high pitched voice] Be careful, Gabul! Be careful, Gabul! Yaaah! [the canoe runs into the dock and they both blow up. Pieces of the four men fall from the air.]
TOP GIRL
Did we do good, Grandmama?
GRANDMAMA
Very good, Glacas.
[The 'camera' pulls back to reveal the entire high speed chase took place on Stark's Pond which is about 7 canoe lengths long.]
[The Marsh house. Snow falls outside. The other boys have gone home]
STAN
I'm tired, Grandpa.
GRANDPA
No, Billy! You're gonna stay here and watch more MacGyver. We've gotta get all the Frenchy-poo fag-nasties out of ya. [the doorbell rings] Who the hell would be ringin' the doorbell at this time of night?
STAN
I don't know. [walks over and opens the door] Whoa. [before him are the contorting Romanian quintuplets and their Grandmama, all shivering. Randy and Sharon show up in their pajamas]
GRANDMAMA
We are very sorry to disturb you. My granddaughters are cold and tired. Is there any possibility we could pay you for a place to sleep?
RANDY
You're from Cirque du Cheville. [Grandpa shows up]
GRANDMAMA
Yes. We- missed our train. If we could shelter here; it would only be for one night.
RANDY
Well…
SHARON
Well, of course you can. Come in out of the snow. [the girls grin and enter]
GRANDMAMA
Oh, thank you so much. [walks in]
SHARON
There's some spare bedrooms upstairs, Mrs....?
GRANDMAMA
Vladchick. [Sharon escorts her and the girls upstairs]
GRANDPA
That Grandma is not a bad piece of ass.
RANDY
Ew, Dad! Not in front of Stanley!
GRANDPA
Well, it's good for 'im.
[The McCormick house. Kenny is in his room with three books on his bed.]
KENNY
[reads "Learning to Sing Better"] (Let's see…No, not there) [tosses the book away and picks up "The Essence of Voicing"] (Let's see. Nothing there) [tosses it away and picks up "Singing like Bocelli for Dummies"] (Let's see…here!) [pulls out a tape and pops it into his tape player]

Good: And now we'll do the entire piece, "Con te partirò" [music begins to play]
KENNY
[leafs through the book] (Con te partirò?) [leafs some more and find it. A rat crawls onto the bed as Kenny looks at the tape player, looks around and leaves. Kenny immediately improves and begins singing like a Prima Divo, yet still characteristically Kenny-muffled…](…Su navi per mariche, io lo so,no, no, non esistono piщ.con te io li rivivere. Con te…)[…and it becomes background music as the camera pans over to…]
['Camera' pans from the McCormick house across the railroad tracks to the Marsh house. Kenny's voice is so powerful it can be heard clearly in the Marsh upper bedroom. Grandmama Vladchick is in her nightgown combing her hair. Grandpa Marsh rolls by]
KENNY
(…partirò.)
GRANDPA
[startles Grandmama] Got everything you need there, do ya?
KENNY
(Su navi per mari)
GRANDMAMA
Yes. You're avefully soo kind to my little granddaughters.
KENNY
(che, io lo so,)
GRANDPA
They're quite agile little things, aren't they?
KENNY
(no, no, non esistono più)
GRANDMAMA
Yes, as I was back in my day. I was a contortionist, too.
KENNY
(con te io li rivivere.)
GRANDPA
Y'don't say. [strokes his chin]
GRANDMAMA
Yes.
GRANDPA
You…
KENNY
(Con te…)
GRANDPA
...remember any of that stuff, do ya? [she looks flattered and intrigued.]
KENNY
(…partirò.Su navi per mariche, io lo so, no, no, non esistono più.)[as Kenny sings, Grandpa returns to Mrs. Vladchick's room naked... and without the wheelchair. She lifts up her left leg over her head, then lets it go. Kenny's getting into the song. The tape speeds up a bit…] (Io con te!)
GRANDPA
Ah. [A leg wraps around his chest] Oh. [a second leg wraps around his head] Ah! [an arm appears, then Mrs. Vladchick's head, then a third leg…] Oh. [Kenny is seen on bended knee on his bed during the last note, as Grandmama Vladchick and Grandpa reach climax.] Oh-oooh-oooh!
[The McCormick house, Kenny's room. The music stops with a thump and Kenny collapses on his bed exhausted]
NARRATOR
And now lesson 4: the complete works of Mozart. Let's begin.
KENNY
[looks at the radio] (Damn!)
[The Marsh house, morning. Randy and Sharon are in the kitchen enjoying some coffee]
SHARON
What should we do, Randy? I like these Romanians fine, but I hope that old woman isn't planning on staying here much longer.
RANDY
Heh, it's 11 o'clock and she's still sleeping.
SHARON
Poor dear must be tired.
GRANDPA
[rolls in] You're damn right she's tired.
RANDY
Huh?
GRANDPA
Oh, nothin'. She's just gonna have a little trouble walkin' today is all. [rolls out].
[The Marsh house, outside. Stan leads the other three boys in the side gate and to the backyard]
STAN
Hurry up, you guys!
CARTMAN
What's going on?
STAN
Dude, you're not gonna believe this.
KYLE
What?! [they all turn, and the quints stand before them]
QUINT 1
Hello.
QUINT 2
Hello.
QUINT 3
Hi.
QUINT 4
Hello.
CARTMAN
No way! The bitches from Cirque du Chebleu!
STAN
Yeah. They're quintuplets from Romania.
KYLE
What's a "quin-tuplet"?
QUINT 2
Ve are twins, except there are five of us instead of two.
KYLE
But there's only four of you.
QUINT 2
No no, Natalia is just playing mirror buddies with Nadia.
NADIA
[steps out from behind Natalia] Hello.
KYLE
So if you're identical, does that mean you all think alike?
ALL FIVE QUINTS IN UNISON
No, don't be ridiculous.
STAN
Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville?
A QUINT
You have your own?
STAN
Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first.
KENNY
(Hey!)
CARTMAN
But as soon as he starts singing better, we're all gonna make bank!
QUINT 1
Okay.
QUINT 3
Sounds good.
QUINT 2
Count me in.
QUINT 5
Okay. [quint 4 says nothing, and the others look at her]
QUINT 4
…Oh, and me.
THE BOYS
All right!
[The Marsh house, kitchen]
RANDY
Alright, we've gotta figure out what to do. I'm gonna go wake her up. [leaves, reaches Grandmama's room, and knocks] Hello? Mrs… Mrs., Old Romanian Woman? [knocks twice more] Ma'am? [opens the door, looks in, and flies are heard buzzing around. Mrs. Vladchick is stiff, mouth open, arms up as if holding someone. Randy shuts the door in horror, then opens it and looks in again to be sure, then shuts it again, horrified]
GRANDPA
[rolls up] Well, all tuckered, is she? Ha ha ha ha.
RANDY
[serious] No, Dad.
GRANDPA
A little cottony in the crotch? Hr hr hr hr.
RANDY
No, Dad, she's dead!
GRANDPA
What?! [Randy opens the door and looks away, Grandpa rolls in to see for himself] Oh, dear Jesus!
RANDY
It looks like she had a heart attack.
GRANDPA
No wonder she didn't say good-night.
RANDY
[stares at him, then leans away] Ew!
[The Marsh house, the backyard]
STAN
Okay, hold it, hold it. [climbs over Cartman and Kyle to form a tower. The quintuplets have executed their X formation. Stan is trying to stand when all three boys tumble to the ground. The quints break their formation and drop down]
THE BOYS
Ow! [Randy and Sharon walk out and approach the kids]
SHARON
I don't know how to tell. You tell them. [they stop]
RANDY
Uh, girls, we… have some bad news.
QUINT 5
What?
RANDY
Um... [Sharon holds his hand] Everyone who has a grandma, step forward. [Stan and Cartman step forward, then the girls] Uh, not so fast, girls. [Sharon gasps and glares at him. The girls step back, then realize what has just happened. They begin to sob]
SHARON
Randy! [amid the sobs, some of the quints have questions]
QUINT 2
Grandmama is dead?
QUINT 1
What are we going to do now? [Randy and Sharon stand there helplessly]
CARTMAN
[in a low voice] You guys, come here. [steps forward. The others join him] This is totally awesome.
STAN
What?!
KYLE
How can you say that?
CARTMAN
Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass!
KYLE
Oh, yeah!
STAN
[rushes up] Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they?
RANDY
Well, Stan, it's not really our-
STAN
They have nowhere else to go. [presses hands together] Please?
SHARON
Well, for the time being I, I mean, of course they can stay.
STAN, KYLE
Hooray!
CARTMAN
Hooray!
[The Marsh house, the backyard, some days later. Neighborhood men and women walk up to a fenced-in area of the yard in which the quints play with various toys and balls]
REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing at the home in South Park where five precious little girls have been rescued from Romania. Their mother passes away some months ago, and then their grandmother died trying to bring them here. But all is well now, and people are coming from all over the country to view the little tykes. [someone takes a picture] If you'd like to come down and visit the quintuplets, admission is only $5, and for a few dollars more ["FEED THE QUINTS! One Dollar" A man buys some fishsticks], you can feed them fishsticks.
A QUINT
[hops up and down, then opens her mouth for a fishstick the man drops down to her] Mmm.
REPORTER
Tom, it looks like these cute little girls have made it out of that armpit of a country they call Romania.
[Romania, daytime with grey sky. Pan across grey, dismal, identical blocky buildings. Government officials watch the report in a run-down office]
REPORTER
Yes, luckily for them, these quintuplets no longer have to live in Romania, the asshole of the world. [a last shot of the quints is seen] Back to you, Tom.
PRESIDENT
This is not good. It makes our country look poor and stupid.
ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
This could kill our tourism.
PRESIDENT
You know what to do. [they salute him and leave.]
[South Park School of Music]
INSTRUCTOR
[at the piano] Alright, Kenny, let's start with some warm-up exercises. [plays the sequence C E G C G E C]
KENNY
[sings along] (Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha) [his mom looks on. The instructor and Kenny move on to the D and E scales.]
MRS. MCCORMICK
Well, what do you think? Can you help him become a better singer?
INSTRUCTOR
Well, he's got potential. Depends on how good he wants to be.
KENNY
(I wanna be really good)
INSTRUCTOR
Well, if you wanna be a real singer, you need to go to a conservatory in Europe. There's no other alternative.
KENNY
(Europe?)
MRS. MCCORMICK
We can't afford that.
INSTRUCTOR
Well, then, I'm afraid your son will always be a hack.
KENNY
(Awww.)
MRS. MCCORMICK
Well, Kenny, if it means that much to you, maybe we can bus it to Europe and… you can sing on the way to make money.
KENNY
(Yeah.)
[The Marsh house, breaking news music is heard. Sharon rushes into the kitchen]
SHARON
Randy, Randy, you'd better have look at this. [exits to the living room]
RANDY
[follows her out] What? [The boys and the quints watch the news. Sharon and Randy join them]
ANCHOR TOM
...until the U.S. government receives this video, which was sent from Romania just hours ago.
MAN
[reading a statement at gunpoint] Hello. This is Romanian father. I am desperate to have my girls returned to me in Romania.
RANDY
Uh-oh.
STAN
That's your dad?
QUINT 2
Maybe.
QUINT 1
But we haven't seen papa for more than five years.
MAN
How I've missed them all. Little Nahlal.
VOICE
[hits the man on the head with the gun, k'chunk] Nadia!
MAN
Nadia, my sweet Barshta
VOICE
[k'chunk] Baltania!
MAN
Baltania, eh anyway, my heart is aching for their return. I, I know the American government will do what's right. [the TV is turned off]
KYLE
Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going.
STAN
[gets up and runs to his parents] Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??
SHARON
Well, I… think we… have to,… don't we? [looks at Randy]
RANDY
I don't know.
KYLE
[the girls look at him] You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there.
CARTMAN
Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down.
SHARON
We'll have to call the police and see what they want us to do. [she and Randy walk away]
CARTMAN
Damn, we might be screwed.
STAN
No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on! [walks off]
[South Park Train Station. Kenny and his mom await the train. Kenny launches into "La donna è mobile." Carol holds a "Trying To Get To Europe" sign. The other boys take the quints to South Park Funland]
CARTMAN
[in a log ride with the other seven, passes a lumberjack scene] You see, in America we have… log rides! [Kenny and his mom are at a bus terminal in Denver. A couple passes by and drops some money into the hat. Next, Cartman and friends are at Burger Cook, a fast-food restaurant] Bacon double-cheeseburgers! [Kenny and his mom are now at Coyote Bus Lines (play on Greyhound Bus Lines) in St. Louis at night. A man peeks through a door, another man drops some money into the hat. Next day] Sheep-shearing contests!
[22nd Annual Sheep Shearing Contest]
[A man shears a sheep with a shearer as the eight kids and four adults watch]
A FAN
Yeah. Woo hoohoohoo. Yeah. [the girls look on expressionless then #2 and #3 look at each other skeptically. Kenny and his mom are now at JFK International Airport in New York. Kenny gets some more money]
CARTMAN
[showing the others around a three-story shopping mall] And shopping malls! Hooray! [the girls are grinning. Kenny finally lands in Europe and goes out through gate 96]
[Welcome To Europe! Coziest LittlePlace On Earth! Elevation 4200 ft.]
KENNY
(Woo hoo!)
[the U.S. Capitol. The Romanian father and two Romanian officials sit in Janet Reno's office]
ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
[no beard] Mrs. Janet Reno, you must understand, the father has right to his children.
JANET RENO
[flanked by two agents in riot gear] Yes, but the girls seem to wanna stay here. Why don't you all stay here in America, and this whole thing can go away.
MR. VLADCHICK
Okay. [the official smacks him with the back of the hand] Heh!
ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
Our home is Romania. We love it there.
MR. VLADCHICK
Ah, yes, uwuh we love it there.
ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
If daughters will not return on their own, you must force them to return
JANET RENO
Gentlemen, this has to be handled very delicately. You don't understand Americans' power to protest.
ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
Protest?
JANET RENO
Look, people have it so good in America that they get bored very easily. And when people get bored they start protesting things.
ALL THREE MEN
Oh.
JANET RENO
But I want to assure you, and the Romanian people, that we are going to do everything in our power to make this as confusing as possible. [the Romanians already look confused]
[South Park, the Marsh house, day. A crowd of protesters lobby in front of the house with signs like "No Go!", "We (heart) The Quints" and "Romania (with red cross-out circle stamp)".]
PROTESTERS
Let the quints stay! Romania is gay! Let the quints stay! Romania is gay!
STEPHEN STOTCH
Fur is murder! Fur is murder! [notices the stares] Oh, what are we protesting here?
A PROTESTER
[with a "No Romania" sign] Romania sucks!
STEPHEN STOTCH
Oh, let's see [His professional protest sign has multiple pages and he flips through from "FUR IS MURDER" to "FREE KEVORKIAN," "SLEEPING BAGS KILL," then "ROMANIA SUCKS"] Here we go. Romania sucks!
PROTESTERS
Romania sucks! Romania sucks!
SHARON
[looks out through the window. "Romania sucks! Romania sucks! Romania sucks!"] Oh my God! I didn't know this was going to become such a big deal.
RANDY
["Romania sucks!"] That'll teach us for taking an old lady and her granddaughters out of the cold.
LEAD AGENT COLLINS
[backed by 11 other agents and a humvee] Attention, people inside the house! [Randy and Sharon look] You must return the quintuplets to their father! You have until… [lowers the bullhorn. An agent comes up and whispers] Oh yeah, that's good. [back on the bullhorn] You have until Easter Sunday to comply.
PROTESTER
Nooo!
PROTESTERS
Boooo!
COLLINS
What?! [the protesters gang up on the agents, beating them with their signs]
[The Marsh house, Stan's room. Stan and friends are oblivious to the action outside]
STAN
Okay, let's try it again. Hup!
A QUINT
Hup! [she leaps into position to complete the arch. Kyle and Cartman dive through and get up]
KYLE
Alright!
RANDY
[enters] Stan, we- [the sight of the undressed boys stops him]
SHARON
Stanley, we have some bad news. The courts have decided the girls must go back to Romania.
STAN
No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America.
KYLE
Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??
RANDY
I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls. [he and Sharon walk away]
STAN
Now what do we do?
[The Marsh house, outside, day. Several days have passed, and now the protest crowd is larger, and news cameras are present]
REPORTER
Tom, it is now Easter morning, and as the U.S. government promised, they are here to take the girls back to their father in Romania. Rumor has it that Janet Reno herself will be extraditing the quintuplets. [just then, a helicopter flies in and hovers over the house. Janet Reno, dressed in a bunny suit, waits in the open door to be lowered]
SOLDIER
Alright, Ms. Reno, let's go over the plan.
JANET RENO
Right.
SOLDIER
We'll drop you on the northwest corner of the backyard. You hop into the back of the house and find the quintuplets. When you see them, you say…
JANET RENO
"Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny."
SOLDIER
Good. And then hand them the Easter eggs filled with tear gas. Are you ready?
JANET RENO
Ready.
SOLDIER
Code blue!
JANET RENO
Code blue! [drops down onto the yard]
[Romanian School of Music, day. Kenny is heard singing. He is onstage as his song ends, and his mom joins him with three other people]
MUSIC INSTRUCTOR
Lad, we would like very much to have you here at the Romanian Music School.
KENNY
(Woohoo!)
CAROL
How much is all this gonna cost?
MUSIC INSTRUCTOR
Don't worry, Ms. McCormick, Romania is very poor country. Apartment is cheap. Food is cheap, Everything is cheap because we are so God-damned poor.
ASSISTANT
Yes, your two hundred American dollars will last months here.
CAROL
Wow, what a great country. Everybody's poor, like us.
KENNY
(Yeah.)
[The Marsh house, day. Protesters and police mill around the front yard]
JANET RENO
[enters the kitchen through the back door] Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny. [sees nothing but furniture before her. She pulls out a an assault rifle with scope and silencer then moves forth] Happy Easter, kids. Come see what I brought for ya. [Stan, his parents, and the quints watch TV in the living room, and Janet Reno peeks at them. Terrance and Phillip are heard on the TV. Janet Reno pulls back and flattens herself against the kitchen wall]
PHILLIP
Hey, Terrance, I think I have to fart. [Reno pulls out an Easter egg and throws it at the girls. It ends up right in front of them]
TERRANCE
Wait. Before you do, pull my thumb.
QUINT 2
Oh, look. An Easter egg.
RANDY
Oh, shi- [the Easter egg unleashes its tear gas, and all cough and choke]
LEAD SOLDIER
That's it. Let's move, move move move, move! [breaks through the front door and leads the other police officers in.] Give us the kids, now! Now!
OFFICER 1
Down on the floor. Get down on the God-damned floor! [more officers stream in as Sharon drops down to the floor and assumes the fetal position]
OFFICER 2
Find them!
JANET RENO
[bursts through the master bedroom door] This is a bust! Hand over the quints! [police officers are already there looking for them under the bed and in dresser drawers. Reno joins them and heads for the closet. She opens a sliding door and finds Randy holding Stan in his arms and points her weapon at them thus comically recreating the famous image of the US Border Patrol agent pointing his MP5 submachine gun at six year old Elian Gonzalez held by his rescuer Donato Dalrymple] Hand over the children! Happy Easter. Hand over the children!!
GRANDPA
[rolls in] What the hell's goin' on?! [all guns point to him]
OFFICER 3
Freeze, asshole!
GRANDPA
Aw, go ahead and shoot me! I dare ya!
OFFICER 3
Don't push me, man!
GRANDPA
Pull the trigger, you little pussy!
OFFICER 3
Gaahhh! [aims away from Grandpa and lets loose with gunfire]
OFFICER 4
Gun! Gun! [fires into the room. Reno drops down to avoid getting hit. Bullets riddle the wall]
JANET RENO
Down! Down! [outside, the protesters back away from the house]
PROTESTER
Riot! Riot! [protesters now move forward against a wall of police]
OFFICER 5
Pepper spray! Pepper spray! [the police harden their line, pull out their cans and spray the protesters, who drop down immediately coughing. The house blows up. When the smoke clears, Reno and two officers are seen carrying the quints away. They reach a black van and toss the girls inside.]
OFFICER 6
Go ahead! In the van! [Reno goes in, followed by the other officers. One of them barks an order to the driver, and the van leaves the scene.]
STAN
[standing in front of the still burning ruins of his house] Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus!
[Romanian School of Music, day. Kenny performs "Der Hölle Rache" in front of a full house. He finishes the aria and the audience erupts in applause. Roses rain down upon him as he takes his bow.]
MUSIC INSTRUCTOR
Oh, your son is so talented, Ms. McCormick. The people of Romania love him.
CAROL
Good job, Kenny.
MUSIC INSTRUCTOR
Mrs. McCormick, we would love for you and your son to stay here in Romania, with us. Will you consider it?
CAROL
[She kneels down and places her hand on Kenny's head] Well, what do you think, Kenny? You'd have to leave your friends and your family behind.
KENNY
(Sure!)
MUSIC INSTRUCTOR
Alright!
[The Marsh house, day. The protesters leave one by one. The Marshes stand in the bombed-out ruins]
SHARON
Oh, Randy, it's gone! It's all gone!
CARTMAN
[arrives with Kyle] Dude, what the hell happened?
STAN
The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.
KYLE
Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?!
STAN
Yeah! Well, not this time!
CARTMAN
Huh?
STAN
We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side! [addresses the mob] Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!
PROTESTER 1
Hmm.
PROTESTER 2
Yeaahh.
PROTESTER 3
I don't know. I usually like to stop protesting by 5:30.
PROTESTER 4
Yeah, ah, do we get overtime for this?
STAN
Uh, sure, you can all get overtime.
PROTESTER 5
Alright! [Fist pumps]
PROTESTER 6
Yeah!
PROTESTER 7
Down with Japan! [the mob moves away]
[An office. Janet Reno and the two officers meet the Mayor and her aides for a photo-op. The photographer takes his shot.]
JANET RENO
Alright. We just need to get a few more pictures of the girls reunited with their father so everyone knows they're happy. [The girls are shown with their grinning father. Two of them sit on his laps, the other three stand in front]
PHOTOGRAPHER
Come on, girls. Smile. [the girls look downcast] We want you to look happy. Smile. [works a sock puppet on his left hand] Look at the silly frog. Who's got the silly frog? Look at him. I've got- Look at him. It's so silly. "I'm so silly." [the girls still have their eyes cast down]
[Romania, day. A news report on TV]
STUART
Ah, hello? This is Kenny's dad, back in America. I miss my son very much. I would like to see him returned to me so that the U.S. government will buy me a new car and- [the butt of a rifle strikes the side of his head] Ow! I mean, bec- because I miss my son very much. [looks to his right] Man.
[A United States Air Force checkpoint, later. Cartman, Kyle, and Stan approach, and a soldier intervenes]
STAN
Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets!
SOLDIER
[Holds out hand to stop their progress] You can't see them, boys. They're happily reunited with their father.
STAN
[whistles a signal] Come on, angry mob! [the mob appears behind him. All of them move forward and overrun the checkpoint. A lagging protester runs over a fallen soldier]
SOLDIER
Aaa-a-a-aaa-ah.
[The USAF office. Reno has taken her mask off and stands next to the girls. Behind her are six officers, and next to them are the two Romanian officials and Mr. Vladchick.]
ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
[the bearded one] Alright, it is time for us to return to Romania.
JANET RENO
[hears something] What is that?
OFFICER 7
[at a window] It's the protesters. They're back.
JANET RENO
God-damnit! [Puts back on her Easter Bunny 'helmet'] We'll take care of them. Come on! [leaves the office]
OFFICER 8
Let's move. Move!
OFFICER 7
Come on, come on, come on.
OFFICER 9
Come oonn, come oonn. [they follow Reno out, leaving the quints alone in front of a poster that reads "Join the Army… It's KILLER!!!". The officers engage the protesters on a runway]
OFFICER 10
This is government property!
PROTESTER
Let the quints stay! [Reno and Sharon head for each other]
SHARON
You ruined my house! [lays out Reno using a baseball bat to the Bunny helmet. The quints look out the window, then turn around. Quint 2 hops off the bench and walks to the office phone]
QUINT 1
What are you doing, Nadia?
NADIA
I'm calling the only person in the vorld who can help us. [picks up the receiver and starts dialing. The other girls look at each other.]
[A USAF airfield, later. Protesters and officers are still brawling. Stan and Kyle each kick an officer on the shin.]
CARTMAN
Take that! [kicks an officer on the shin]
QUINT 3
[heads towards the battlefield and addresses everyone] Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! [the other four quints are with her. Weapons and signs are lowered]
QUINT 1
All of you are acting like idiots!
STAN
Yeah.
QUINT 1
None of you care about us. You only care about yourselves!
QUINT 2
Look at you, Father. You walked out on us five years ago [he removes his hat and holds it tight], and now you act like you miss us sooo much! You are a liar and a fake!
CARTMAN
Yeah, you suck, dude!
QUINT 3
And you Romanian leaders [both of them are there], you don't care about us! All you care about is making America look stupid!
CARTMAN
Yeah! God, you guys are dicks!
QUINT 3
And you protesters! Don't you have anything better to do?! Get a life!
CARTMAN
Yeah!
QUINT 3
And you boys are the worst of all!
STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
Huh?
QUINT 3
You know nothing about Romania, and yet you assume America is so much better! Maybe Romania isn't as nice as America, but it is our home! We are Romanian! All you care about is your own stupid circus! [at this point, a limousine pulls up behind them. It's from the Oprah show. The driver opens the back door and the girls head for the back seat]
JANET RENO
[has a protester in a headlock] Where are you going, girls?
QUINT 1
The only place we can go. We're going on Oprah and then a book tour. [turns and climbs in, followed by three others]
QUINT 5
Yes. You can all kiss our little white Romanian asses! [wiggles her ass at the crowd and climbs in. The limo leaves and everyone is left in a state of shock.]
STAN
Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways.
CARTMAN
Yeah, screw them!
KYLE
Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.
STAN
Whatever happened to Kenny?
[Romania, still grey and dismal daytime. Romanian protesters with signs bearing a picture of Kenny's head lobby in front of the house Kenny's in.]
ROMANIAN PROTESTERS
Let Kenny stay! Let Kenny stay! Let Kenny stay! [a van pulls up and police officers all the way from the U.S. pour out]
OFFICER 1
[sternly] Alright, people, the father wants his son returned to him! Hand him over to us!
ROMANIAN PROTESTERS
Boooo!
OFFICER 2
Shut up, Romanians! All right, let's go. Move move move move! [bursts through the front door. Officers pour in and look all over the place for Kenny. They enter the master bedroom, and look under the bed and in dresser drawers. One of them head for the closet and opens the sliding door and again the Elian Gonzalez scene is recreated with Kenny and his mother facing the police]
OFFICER 3
[seeing Carol holding Kenny] Hand over the boy, now!
CAROL
Okay, okay!
OFFICER 3
I mean it, lady, you've got about-! [his assault rifle goes off, riddling Kenny with bullets. His mom is distraught and drops Kenny] Whoops.
End of Quintuplets 2000


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:When Timmy is diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder, it triggers a wave of prescription drug abuse at South Park Elementary.

script:Timmy 2000

[South Park Elementary, day. Mr. Garrison's classroom. The student stream in and take their seats]
STAN
Dude, did you do all your homework last night?
KYLE
Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning.
STAN
I know!
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, I hope you all did your homework last night, because we're goin' to talk about pages 42 through 612. First of all, who can tell me what year the Founding Fathers got together? [the class sits silently] Let's see, how about...
CARTMAN
[praying softly at his desk] Please don't call on me. Please, Jesus, don't let him call on me.
MR. GARRISON
Wendy?
CARTMAN
Phew!
WENDY
1776.
MR. GARRISON
Good job, Wendy. And what was that document called?
CARTMAN
[praying] Oh, please, God, don't let him call on me. Father in heaven, I beg of you-
MR. GARRISON
[points to] Kyle?
CARTMAN
Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus!
KYLE
The Declaration of Independence?
MR. GARRISON
Very good, Kyle. Now, who can tell me what famous person wrote the Declaration of Independence? [Cartman drops low in his seat so as to hide behind Butters, seated in front of him] Let's see. Oh, I know. How about the new student, Timmy? [the camera and the class's eyes move to Timmy, who's grinning]
TIMMY
Timmiihh!
MR. GARRISON
No, it wasn't you, Timmy. Try again.
TIMMY
Heh-aaaaaah!
MR. GARRISON
Timmy, did you not do your homework?!
TIMMY
Erh Timmiihh!!
STAN
Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded.
MR. GARRISON
Don't call people names, Stanley!
STAN
But he is-
MR. GARRISON
Now, Timmy,—
TIMMY
Haaaaah.
MR. GARRISON
—You need to work on your study skills!
TIMMY
Doo-uhh.
MR. GARRISON
Are you mocking me?! Because if you are, I have no problem sending your butt to the principal's office!
TIMMY
G'oh livin' a lie, livin' a lie, Timmawh!
MR. GARRISON
THAT DOES IT!
[The principal's office. Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey talk to Timmy]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, Timmy. I just don't know what to do with you. You're getting very poor marks in school and the teachers are complaining that you aren't paying attention.
TIMMY
Heh-aaaaaah!
MR. MACKEY
Uh young man, if you don't wanna be held back a grade, I suggest you start cooperating, m'kay?!
TIMMY
Timmiihh!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, that does it! I'm suspending you, Timmy, until you can learn to respect your elders! [pulls out a suspension form and starts filling it out]
TIMMY
Ehhha-a-a-ah.
MR. MACKEY
Huh- hold on just a second there, Principal Victoria. [she stops writing] I think I may know what the problem is. [walks to Timmy and stands behind him, checking him out ]
TIMMY
[softly] Timmiihh.
MR. MACKEY
Yes, of course.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
What??
MR. MACKEY
[Timmy is grinning, enjoying himself] I think maybe Timmy is suffering from something called, "Attention Deficit Disorder," or ADD. It's very common in kids his age.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh!
TIMMY
[turns right and zooms away] Timmiihh!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, that certainly would explain it.
MR. MACKEY
It should be easy enough to find out. They have tests for that kind of thing now, m'kay?
TIMMY
[zooms across the room in the other direction] Oolih oo livin' a lie, Timmehuh!
[A clinic. Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey have taken Timmy there to see a doctor]
CLINIC DOCTOR
Alright, this is a very simple test which should determine without a doubt whether or not Timmy has Attention Deficit Disorder.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Good.
MR. MACKEY
M'kay.
TIMMY
Timmih.
CLINIC DOCTOR
Egh. Now, Timmy, I'm going to read you a book called, "The Great Gatsby," by F. Scott Fitzgerald. At the end of the novel I'll ask you a few questions. Are you ready?
TIMMY
Timmih.
CLINIC DOCTOR
[sits] Okay, here we go. [opens the book and clear his throat] "In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since" ["since since since since..." The clock reads 2:01, but the hours begin to roll by: 3:24, 5:55, 9:09...] "so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past." [closes the book. Both Mr. Mackey and Principal Victoria are asleep, his head resting on hers.]
TIMMY
Ha-a-a-a-a-h.
CLINIC DOCTOR
Okay now, Timmy. Can you tell me: In Chapter 7, what kind of car did Gatsby drive?
TIMMY
[fiddles around some, then turns aside] Timmih!
CLINIC DOCTOR
[rises and slams the book on the floor] Well, that settles it!
MR. MACKEY, PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[sit up] Huh??
CLINIC DOCTOR
This young man definitely has Attention Deficit Disorder!
MR. MACKEY
[rubs his eyes] Oh oh, I nuh-I knew it.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
What can we do for him, doctor?
CLINIC DOCTOR
Well, ADD is fairly common in kids today. I'm gonna prescribe some Ritalin, and we'll see how that goes for little Timmy.
TIMMY
[softly] Timmih.
[South Park Elementary, next day. Mr. Garrison's classroom]
MR. GARRISON
Hurry up, children, let's take our seats. [Timmy rolls up with a note attached to his head] You'd better have done your homework last night, Timmy. [sees the note] What's this? [peels it off and reads it]
TIMMY
Tim-mih.
MR. GARRISON
A note from the principal? "Please excuse Timmy from all questions and all homework, as he has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder." [puts the note down] Oh, brother!
STAN
He doesn't have to do homework?
MR. GARRISON
That's just swell, Timmy! Looks like you've outsmarted the principal and the counselor!
TIMMY
Timmih.
MR. GARRISON
Very well, I guess you're excused from homework.
KYLE
Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder.
CARTMAN
Yeah, me too.
STAN
I've got ADD.
KENNY
(Me too.)
OTHER CLASSMATES
Yeah, I've got it. Me too. Yeah.
FOSSE
It's gay.
[The clinic, later. The doctor is reading "A Farewell To Arms," by Ernest Hemingway, to the class now]
CLINIC DOCTOR
"After a while I went out and left the hospital, and walked back to the hotel in the rain." [sighs and closes the book. Kenny bangs his head against the wall cabinet. Tweek, Kyle, and Bebe sleep where they sit. Cartman is asleep on his back. Tolkien, Stan, Wendy, Clyde, and Kevin are drowsy.] Alright now, in Chapter 12, what kind of bottles did Miss Van Campen talk about? [Kenny continues to bang his head again] Anybody? [Kenny bangs head head again] Anybody?? My God, these children all have ADD! [scribbles onto his notepad quickly]
STAN AND KYLE
[sleepily] Hooray.
CARTMAN
[sleepily] Hoo-ray.
CLINIC DOCTOR
It's Ritalin for all of you! [writes out prescriptions]
[A house. Rock music is heard. Next, Skyler and his band are shown practicing. They now have a name: Lords of the Underworld. They play, but don't sing, and thrust their heads down from time to time.]
DRUMMER
Dude, we suck!
SKYLER
Hey, that's not the right attitude, Jonesy! The Battle of the Bands is tomorrow night!
JONESY
Dude, we never win the Battle of the Bands! It's no big deal.
SKYLER
[disbelieving] Not a big deal! This year's winner gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalooblaza, and that's no big deal?!
MARK
Hey, you guys, you'd better stop fighting.
SKYLER
We've just gotta practice more.
JONESY
Dude, we've been practicing for eight years, Skyler.
SKYLER
Hey, am I the leader of this band or not?! Huh, let's do it from the top! [the band starts up again, then pause]
TIMMY
[outside] Timmuuhh! [the band riffs] Coodalah Timmuh!
JONESY
[stops] What was that?
SKYLER
Huh-I don't know, man. [picks up the garage door opener and presses the button. The door rises to the sound of an angelic choir and orchestra and reveals the bright light outside. And in that light is Timmy.] Whoaaa!
MARK
Who is that?
TIMMY
Timmiihh!
SKYLER
You a singer, man?
TIMMY
Rrrrr-laurlaurlah Timmehah! [no reaction, but later, the band practices again. Timmy is with them now.] Timmehuh! [the band plays on, then stops] Timmehh.
JONESY
Dude, that's hot!
SKYLER
Yeah!
[South Park Pharmacy, day. Carol receives her son's prescription.]
PHARMACIST
There is your prescription, Ms. McCormick. A hundred dollars' worth of Ritalin.
CAROL
And he won't have Attention Deficit Disorder anymore?
PHARMACIST
We can only hope so. Next? [the camera pulls back to show a line of kids with their moms. Kenny and his mom leave, and Stan arrives with his mom]
SHARON
Oh, hi, Sheila.
SHEILA
Sharon, your son has Attention Deficit Disorder too?
SHARON
Yes. I should have known. It all makes sense now. I could never get Stanley to pay attention when his grandfather told him stories about the '30s.
SHEILA
I know what you mean. Kyle gets so hyper, sometimes he runs around and screams like a little eight-year-old.
KYLE
...I am eight.
PHARMACIST
Next, please? [Liane hands him the prescription] What do we have here- ah! The Ritalin!
LIANE
Yes.
CARTMAN
That's right. I got a bad case of ADD. No homework for me.
LIANE
Mr. Pharmacist, this Ritalin doesn't have any side effects, does it?
PHARMACIST
Oh, no no, your son may experience a small lack of energy, but that's all.
LIANE
Alright.
PHARMACIST
Oh, and he might start seeing little pink Christina Aguilera monsters, but that's to be expected.
LIANE
Oh my.
[South Park Battle Of The Bands. A four-member band is onstage. One member is on keyboards, a second is on drums, a third on guitar, and the fourth has the mic. The first and third have flaming hairdos]
BAND
Look alive, lettin' it feel (so light). Lettin' it feel so light.
PEOPLE IN AUDIENCE
Boooo!
GUY IN FLAT TOP
You suck! [others laugh. The band clears out as the M.C. approaches the mic]
M.C.
Alright, that was "Sisters of Mercy Hold No Pain Against the Dark Lord," with their song, "Silk Blood On The Footsteps Of My Mind (Revisited)"
SINGER
We got the best response. We'll be opening for Phil Collins for sure.
M.C.
And now it's time for our final band.
GUY IN AUDIENCE
Thank God! [others laugh]
M.C.
Give it up for "Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld!" [the curtains part amid a smattering of applause to reveal the Lords of the Underworld and Timmy rolls up to the mic. The audience is stunned]
SKYLER
1 2 3 4 [the Lords launch into their song]
TIMMY
Timmih! [a riff] Timmih! Lehmeheuh! [confused looks on people's faces] Timmih!
MAN 1
Duhude, that handicapped dude ruhules!
MAN 2
Oo-yee-hee-yeh-hah!
MAN 3
You guys are terrible! How could you laugh at that poor kid?!
TIMMY
Timmih Timmiihh! Timmehuh Timmih Timmiihh!
!THE LORDS
Lords of the Underworld.
TIMMY
Timmih, Timmiih!
THE LORDS
Darkness fills my heart with pain.
TIMMY
Timmih oo livin' a lie! [the four boys arrive]
STAN
Dude, it's Timmy.
KYLE
No way! [Timmy says something incomprehensible]
MAN 3
They're ridiculing that singer! ["habah kulaa!"]Come on, let's get outta here! [leaves with three others]
TIMMY
Sibilah Sibinlaahh! [keeps babbling]
THE LORDS
The Lords of the Underworld.
TIMMY
Timmih, Timmih Timmitimmi Timmiih!
THE LORDS
Darkness fills my heart with pain. [the song ends. Someone is carried across the field by the crowd]
TIMMY
Timmehahh! Timmeh Timmeh Sibinlah Timmih Sibinlah Timmih. Timmuh Timmuh Timmuh. [one last power chord] Timmeh!
CARTMAN
That was awesuhome!
STAN
Yeah, Timmy ruhules!
WOMAN
Boys! You shouldn't laugh at him! He's handicapped!
STAN
But he's funny.
WOMAN
How would you like to be handicapped?! Do you think that would be funny?! You're making him feel bad!
TIMMY
[basking in the applause] Hehaahh!
KYLE
He looks pretty happy to me.
WOMAN
Oh, you people make me sick! [walks away]
M.C.
Dude, this is a no-brainer. This year's Battle of the Bands winner and the band that gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalablala is... TIMMY!
CROWD
[roars in approval] Wooo!
JONESY
[flexes his arms] We did it, dude!
SKYLER
[moves forward] Listen to them. They really love me. [bows] Wooo!!
CROWD
[responds] Wooo!!
SKYLER
Yes! I'm a rocker! [he and Jonesy throw their arms up in victory]
[PSB presents Charlie Rose]
CHARLIE ROSE
Tonight, we analyze the new rock sensation, Timmeo [a clip of it at the Battle of the Bands], the controversial new band that has taken the country by storm. [the crowd cheers and holds up "TIMMY" signs. A woman lifts up her blouse to reveal her bra] Already playing at several large venues this month [the band is shown coming off a plane. Cameras flash at Timmy with the Lords of the Underworld behind him], the band prepares for its biggest gig, Lolapalooblaza, where they will open for Phil Collins. But Phil Collins is not happy.
PHIL COLLINS
[in the middle of a street holding his Oscar] Well, I thinks it's a horrible tragedy, idn't it? I mean, people aren't gonna see Timmy for his musical skills. They're laughin' at 'im, and I think you shouldn't laugh at people with disabilities!
MAN
[appears in the background and points at Phil] Hah haha.
PHIL COLLINS
Society has to learn how to be more compassionate! This is gonna stop if I have to stop it myself!
[Bus stop, next day. Stan and Kyle await the bus]
KYLE
Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy?
STAN
Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is.
CARTMAN
[arrives with Kenny and speaks mellowly] Hey guys, have you been takin' your Ritalin?
STAN
Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff.
CARTMAN
No, dude, you gotta try it. [hands a bottle to Kyle] It makes you feel good.
KENNY
[also mellow] (Good.) [Kyle takes a couple of pills, then tosses the bottle to Stan]
[South Park Elementary, day, kitchen]
CHEF
Hello there, children.
STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
Hello, Chef.
KENNY
(Hello, Chef.)
CHEF
How's it goin'?
STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
Very well, thank you.
KENNY
(Very well, thank you.)
CHEF
[incredulous] Everything's fine?? Why??
STAN
Because we're on Ritalin.
CHEF
What??
KYLE
We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin.
CARTMAN
It really takes the edge off, man. You should try it. [shakes two pills out of his bottle and swallows them]
CHEF
So that's why all you children are acting so damned boring!
KYLE
That's correct, Chef.
CHEF
Damnit, children, you don't need drugs to make you pay attention in school! In my day, if we didn't pay attention we got a belt to the bottom! Now they're tryin' to cure everything with drugs!
KYLE
Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium
STAN
Oh boy oh boy.
KENNY
(Oh boy.)
CHEF
Oh, it makes me sick! Those damned psychologists prescribe all kinds of medicines to you children without even carin' about the side effects.
STAN
But there are no side effects, Chef.
KYLE
No, not at all. [Cartman looks away and a Christina Aguilera monster appears]
CHRISTINA AGUILERA MONSTER
Rown! [Cartman rubs his eyes, and she's gone]
CARTMAN
Did you guys see that?
STAN
See what?
[MTV News. A satellite revolves around the logo]
ANNOUNCER
You're watching MTV, the cool, brainwashing, twelve-year-old-and-younger station that hides behind a slick image. We're so cool that we decide what's cool. And now, MTV News, the news that is singlehandedly dumbing down our country. Which is cool. Here's your host, Kurt Loder.
KURT LODER
[framed by seven monitors showing the following: the MTV logo, The Cure's Robert Smith, a rotating Earth, Ozzy Osbourne, KoRn, Elton John, and Rick James] Why am I still doing this? I've got to be the oldest person in this network by at least 40 years.
ANNOUNCER
[the logo takes up the whole screen] Kurt Loder didn't just say that. No way, he did just say it, but just to be cool. That's what makes him cool. You think Kurt Loder is cool. And now, the news that's cool.
KURT LODER
Well, it's only two weeks until Lalapalalababa, and the headlining band has changed. Now headlining the event is Timmy [a shot of him], the new hit sensation out of Colorado. This news came as a shock to the performer that was going to headline Lalapalabala, Phil Collins.
PHIL COLLINS
[now in South Park with his Oscar] Well, I think the sad question is, "Where are the parents in all this?" I mean, that kid's parents are lettin' him be exploited, and they don't even seem to care.
KURT LODER
[A limo with police escort pulls up to a house] And so, Phil Collins decided to travel to South Park and personally pay Timmy's parents a visit. [Phil gets out of the limo and goes to the front door]
PHIL COLLINS
[in the living room] Well, I mean, why are you lettin' 'em do this to your son? Don't you see that everyone's just laughin' at him?
RICHARD
Richarrrrd!
HELEN
Helennnn!
RICHARD
'Oodleahah.
KURT LODER
Phil Collins warns that a novelty band that makes fun of the handicapped should not be allowed to play Lalapalablalala, and vows to do everything in his power to stop it. Phil Collins, by the way, divorced his wife via fax and then married a 27-year-old. I'm Kurt Loder, and that's the news.
[South Park Elementary, day, Mr. Garrison's class. The school bell rings]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, let's settle down! [the class is seated and attentive] Huhh I mean it; I want quiet! [the class is already quiet] My God, Mr. Hat, these children are so boring on Ritalin. [Clyde rubs his nose] Huh, ah! Alright, children, today we're gonna learn about human reproduction. What do you think about that?! [draws the words out slowly, but the class remains silent] Vaginas, and penises. Butt sex. [no one moves] Well, dammit, Eric, don't you have some smartass thing to say?!
CARTMAN
[Clyde is a bit shocked] What kind of smartass thing would I say, Mr. Garrison?
MR. GARRISON
[grabs his head a few times] This is driving me crazy!! I can't handle you little bastards being so mellow!!
KYLE
Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin? [has the bottle out. Mr. Garrison thinks a bit, then goes for the bottle, opens it up, and chugs some pills down]
CARTMAN
There you go. [smiles, then frowns]
CHRISTINA AGUILERA MONSTER
[comes out from behind Mr. Garrison's desk] Rowr.
CARTMAN
Whah!
[Mile High Stadium: "Tonight Only. TIMMY!!! Sold Out."]
A SINGER
Thank you, Baltimore! Good night!
JONESY
[exits the dressing room with the other band members] Alright, let's rock this house! Hello Miami!
TIMMY
Timmiihh! [Skyler trails the others, and Phil Collins appears in a hallway intersection next to the dressing room]
PHIL COLLINS
Excuse me, Skyler Morse?
SKYLER
[stops and turns] Yeah?
PHIL COLLINS
Nice to meet you. I'm Phil Collins.
SKYLER
Oh, yeah. You're opening for us as Lalapalazabla.
PHIL COLLINS
I just wanted to tell you that, well, I think that you're a great guitar player and song writer.
SKYLER
Oh, thanks a lot. I appreciate that. Gotta run. [turns and starts walking away]
PHIL COLLINS
It's too bad those other guys are holdin' you back.
SKYLER
[stops and looks back] Huh?
PHIL COLLINS
Well, I mean, it's obvious all the talent and artistic vision in the band comes from you. Strange, how everyone focuses n Timmy, idn't it? I mean, even the name of the band is "Timmy,"
SKYLER
Nuh-nn, the name of the band is Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.
PHIL COLLINS
Look, I used to be in a band, too. Genesis. And all those bastards did was hold me back and hold me back. But then, finally, I went solo. And that's when I started writing really great songs. But look, if you happen to be on the sidelines, you know, bein' more of a cheerleader than a player, well, then I guess you should stay on as Timmy's shadow.
SKYLER
[dejected, walks away and looks back] Uh, thanks man. See ya.
PHIL COLLINS
That should just about put an end to all this Timmy nonsense. [kisses his Oscar]
[Mile High Stadium, later.]
TIMMY
Timmuh! [the Lords of the Underworld have finished their song]
JONESY
[leads the others into the dressing room] Another great show, man. There must have been a hundred thousand people out there.
SKYLER
[tosses his guitar aside] Yeah. All of them chanting "Timmy, Timmy."
TIMMY
[rolls in] Timmih!
JONESY
What's the matter, Skyler?
SKYLER
The name of the band is Timmy AND the Lords of the Underworld, not just Timmy.
TIMMY
Timmiihh!
SKYLER
And the Lords of the Underworld!
TIMMY
Timmiihh!
SKYLER
It's always about you, isn't it?! I'm sick of it! Timmy gets all the applause! Timmy gets all the chicks! Well, you know what?! Forget you, man!
MARK
Skyler, Timmy is what made our band famous.
SKYLER
[spins around and points] Shut up, Monsy! You can stay and deal with Mr. Egomaniac here, but I'm movin' on! [heads for the door] I don't need Timmy! [grabs Monsy's guitar on the sofa] I'm goin' solo!
TIMMY
Timmiihh!
SKYLER
[at the door] No! Don't try and stop me, man! [turns to exit] I'll see you on fame's backside. [leaves]
TIMMY
Ooo livin' a lie!
[Cartman's house, next day. The boys are on the sofa watching Terrance and Phillip. Stan has his Ritalin, Cartman has the remote... and a pan on his laps. He's eating bacon]
PHILLIP
Terrance, what brand of pants am I wearing?
TERRANCE
[bends to look] Let me see. [Phillip farts on him and they crack up]
PHILLIP
How do you like that, Terrance?
STAN
Let's watch something else.
KYLE
Yes, let's. [Cartman starts channel-surfing, then stops]
ANNOUNCER
You're watching VH1.
THE BOYS
Ahhhh.
ANCHOR
Here's Lalapalalala's news. The hit group Timmy has broken up.
STAN
Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up?
ANCHOR
And so, Phil Collins is back on as the headliner. The opening band now will be Timmy's guitarist Skyler's new solo project, Reach for the Skyler.
KYLE
You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.
STAN
Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.
CARTMAN
I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins.
KYLE
Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.
STAN
Sounds good.
CARTMAN
So it's decided: Phil Collins concert for all of us. [a Christina Aguilera bug is crawling all over Kenny] Hooray. [looks] Oh oh. Hold still, Kenny. [takes his pan and swings it at Kenny. It strikes, and Kenny's face is smashed in. Kenny falls forward, hits the floor, and a puddle of blood forms under him]
STAN
Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny.
KYLE
Bastard.
[The Marsh house. Several parents are gathered in the living room. Chef speaks]
CHEF
Parents, I called you all together because I think you might be making a mistake puttin' your children on Ritalin. [Along with Stan's parents, Kyle's parents, Tweek's parents, Liane Cartman, Craig's parents, and another set of parents are present]
RANDY
Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention in school without it.
CHEF
I know you wanna help your kids, but I brought over a videotape to show you that there are alternative' to Ritalin. There's this doctor in Northern California who is doin' real amazing things with kids who have ADD. I want you to watch this tape. [puts in the tape. The VCR does the rest]
DR. SHAY
Hello, I'm Dr. Richard Shay, here to tell you about my exciting new drug-free treatment for children with Attention Deficit Disorder. [three kids are in a classroom setting, acting up. Dr. Shay enters] This treatment is fast and effective and doesn't use harmful drugs. Watch closely as I apply treatment to the first child.
GIRL
[Dr. Shay walks up to her and listens as she rattles off] I want a horse. I want a big brown horse with a brown-and-black tail, and a diamond tiara- [he smacks her behind the ear] Ah!
DR. SHAY
Sit down and study! [she looks at him scared, then picks up a book and opens it, looking at him all the while. He moves on to the boy in the middle desk]
BOY 1
Woohoo, let's go sledding, let's go race and race, let's go! [Dr. Shay smacks him too, making him turn aside. He turns back]
DR. SHAY
Sit down and study!
BOY 1
[looks at him, then starts crying] Wwaaahahahahaaha [Dr. Shay smacks him again. The other boy stops and looks]
DR. SHAY
Stop crying and do your schoolwork! [the boy opens his book. He and the girl start reading. The Dr. moves over to the other boy, and he just cracks open his book and reads. The doctor address the camera] If you would like more information on my bold new treatments, please send away for this free brochure, entitled, "You can either calm down, or I can pop you in the mouth again." Thank you. [Chef turns the tape off]
CHEF
Well, what do you think? I can have Dr. Shay come to South Park for a small fee.
SHARON
That video had pretty colors.
GERALD
It sure did.
CHEF
What the...? Dammit! Have you all been taking your children's Ritalin too?!
PARENTS
Yes.
CHEF
Awww, fudge it! [throws the remote aside. The boys enter]
STAN
Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?
CHEF
The what?
KYLE
Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us.
PARENTS
Yes.
CHEF
Hold on a second: you children want to go see Phil Collins?
KYLE
Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.
CHEF
Oh my God!!
KYLE
Come, see him with us.
CARTMAN
Yes, come with us. Come with uusss. Haaa, it's Christina Aguilera again! [runs around] She's on my back! Hah! [leaves]
CHEF
That does it! That Ritalin has affected your little cracker brains too deeply! I'm going to go see that damn pharmacist!
[South Park Pharmacy, after hours. The pharmacist and the clinic doctor are talking, and the doctor counts some money]
PHARMACIST
Look at that. Ritalin stocks are up ten points.
CLINIC DOCTOR
That's easily another twenty grand apiece! [the pharmacist laughs and Chef arrives]
CHEF
[pounds on the door] Hey, open this damn door. [the doctor and pharmacist cover the money and go to the front door.]
PHARMACIST
Can I help you?
CHEF
Yes you can! What the hell are you two doin' prescribing all the children Ritalin?!
CLINIC DOCTOR
Well, they've all been diagnosed with ADD. That's Attention Deficit-
CHEF
I know what it is! But now you've got a town full of zombie children from the planet Zandor.
CLINIC DOCTOR
Huh?
CHEF
All around the country, you bastard doctors are giving children Ritalin! And for every one child that actually needs it, you give it to 50,000 that don't!
CLINIC DOCTOR
Hey now, don't tell us our business, Mr. Chef. Why, we-
CHEF
You're damn right I'll tell you yo' business, because you two have got your heads up your asses! Thanks to you, we have children in our town that like Phil Collins!
PHARMACIST
Eh wuh, what?? [he and the doctor are shocked]
CHEF
That's right! You've made them so dull and boring that they're actually going to go to a Phil Collins concert!
CLINIC DOCTOR
Mm- my God. What have we done?? [beings to weep]
PHARMACIST
Well, if I had known... Phil Collins, uh, my God! [beings to weep as well]
CHEF
Well, how do we reverse the Ritalin?!
CLINIC DOCTOR
We uh... have to convince them not to take it, but, ahah ih it'll be hard to get it away from them.
CHEF
Then we need an antidote!
PHARMACIST
Yes, of course.
CLINIC DOCTOR
Uh, what's the antidote for Ritalin?
PHARMACIST
I have some right here. [takes a bottle from a medicine case] It's a compound called "Ritalout."
CHEF
Alright. Come on, we've got to get the antidote to all the children. Quick! [rushes out]
[Welcome to
LALAPALALAPAZA!!
Townsfolk file in. Music is piped in before the concert]
PHIL COLLINS
[the crowds clap to the rhythm]
Last night I went, "O!"
Bubudio
Last night I went "Bubudio"
CHEF
[leads the doctor and pharmacist to a lemonade stand.] Here. We can put the Ritalin antidote in these drinks and hand them out to the children. ["Last night I went 'Bubudio.'" The pharmacist starts placing the Ritalout tablets in the drinks]
PHIL COLLINS
Last night I went, "O!" Bububudio. [takes a bow. People clap a bit]
RANDY
Wasn't that great, son?
STAN
Sure was, Dad.
GERALD
It's so wonderful to be on the same wavelength as our kids.
CHEF
[arrives with a tray of lemonade] Here you go, Stan and Kyle. Free drinks on me. [Kyle reaches for his drink and takes a sip]
STAN
Oh, thank you, Chef. How nice. [takes a glass. He and Kyle drink at the same time as Chef leaves]
PHIL COLLINS
I know. I'd like to sing the complex and amazing song that won me the Oscar, a song entitled,
"You'll Be In... Me." [goes to the piano, sets the Oscar on the piano top and starts playing it] Thanks. You're inside of me. Deep inside of me. [Chef hands drinks to more kids] So deep inside, I can feel you pushing against my heart.
CHEF
Come on, drink it down. It's free.
CARTMAN
You'll be inside of me...
CHRISTINA AGUILERA MONSTER
[appears on his shoulder] Rowr.
CARTMAN
Huh? Oh no! Agh! [tries to shake it off as it nibbles on his shoulder] Get off me! Get off me! Somebody help!! Please?? Somebody get it off of me!! Get it off of me.
STAN
I feel... different.
KYLE
Yeah. [the monster munches loudly on Cartman]
CARTMAN
Get off of me, Christina Aguilera! Alright?! Please! Hegh, hegh[the monster still munches on him as he rolls on the ground]
CHEF
[arrives] Drink this, Eric. [pours the lemonade Ritalout into Cartman's mouth, and the Christina Aguilera monster dissolves] God help me! Heh, get it... [turns over on his stomach] She's gone! Thank God!
PHIL COLLINS
[looks at the audience] Well, thanks! [continues playing. The camera focuses on Stan and Kyle...]
STAN
Wait a minute! Phil Collins sucks ass!
KYLE
Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo!
CHEF
[returns to the doctor and pharmacist] I think it's working.
AUDIENCE
Booooo!!
PHIL COLLINS
[stops the music] Shut your filthy holes, you little bastards!
STAN
Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!
KYLE
Yeah!
PHIL COLLINS
You just wanna laugh at him.
STAN
No! [steps forward] You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be "protected" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!
KYLE
Yeah! Tim-my! Tim-my!
AUDIENCE
Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!
[A desert near town. Mark and Timmy stand outside, Jonesy sits on the running board]
JONESY
Man, it sucks not being part of Lalapalabala. [The cry begins to reach them: "Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
MARK
Yeah. ["Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
SKYLER
[returns to the band] Hey dudes. ["Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
JONESY
Skyler, what are you doing here?! ["Tim-my! Tim-my!"] Isn't Reach for the Skyler supposed to play soon? ["Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
SKYLER
They booed Phil Collins off the stage. Everyone's chanting for Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld. ["Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
MARK
["Tim-my!"] Oh, so now that they want us, you think you can waltz, um, back into our lives and be in the band again? ["Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
SKYLER
I don't expect anything. Timmy, I-gh... Well, I just wanted to say we had some pretty rockin' times, dude, and... maybe I let fame and Phil Collins go to my head... ["Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
TIMMY
Timmih! ["Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
JONESY
[stands] Wow. They really are chanting for us. ["Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
MARK
Hn they want us back. ["Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
SKYLER
What do you say, Timmy? ["Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
TIMMY
Rrr, rrr, uh, Timmih. ["Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
THE LORDS
Alright!
[The Lalapalalapaza concert.]
HOST
Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, it is my pleasure to introduce the reunion tour of Timmehuh!
TIMMY
[rolls up to the mic] Timmiihh, and the Lords of the Underworld! [Skyler looks over at Timmy with pride, then starts the band up] Timmiihh! [he's learned to move like the other band members do] Timmih! Livin' a lie-ah! [Stan and Kyle grin. Kyle then waves. Chef, the pharmacist and the doctor sway to the music] Hidilah Timmy! [his parents, Richard and Helen, are there] Timmuh- Timmiihh! Timmehuh Timmih Timmiihh!
THE LORDS
And the Lords of the Underworld.
PHIL COLLINS
[being moved over the audience] Put me down, you filthy bastards! [he's turned face down, and his Oscar is sticking out of his ass] Awwww!
TIMMY
Timmiihh uluh-livin' a lie!
[End credits roll, and Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld play on.]
End of Timmy 2000

synopsis:When Pip is offered the opportunity to become a gentleman he goes to London only to discover that Miss Havisham plans to break his heart.

script:Pip

[The camera pans across a nicely appointed study, rests a bit, and "South Park Classics" appears on screen as a classical piece plays]
NARRATOR
[seated in an armchair reading a book] Aaah. [looks at the camera] Dickens. The imagery of cobblestone streets, cragging London buildings, and nutmeg-filled Yorkshire puddings. [closes the book] Hello, I'm a British person. For years now, the character Pip has been featured prominently in the American show, South Park. However, many Americans don't realize where Pip came from. He's the prowling little adorable Englishman from Charles Dickens' timeless classic, "Great Expectations" [displays the title] And so tonight, the makers of South Park have agreed to take a break from their regular show, and instead present the prestigious Dickens tale in its entirety from beginning to end. Indeed, after watching this show, you'll know the timeless classic as if you'd... read the Cliff Notes themselves. Our story is set in England, in the small town of Drop-A-Chair-Upon-Top-Snot, [the town is now shown, with Pip walking up the street from a distance] where a young blond-haired boy named Pip was on his way to see his parents.
[Drop-A-Chair-Upon-Top-Snot, day. Pip leaves the town, crosses an open field, enters an enclosed lot and stops right in front of the camera]
PIP
[holding a bunch of flowers] 'Ello Mom. 'Ello Dad. It certainly is nice to see you again. [before him are two tombstones. They are of his parents, Phillip and Georgina Pirrip. Pip is in the town graveyard.] Don't worry. Sister is still taking very good care of me. She just loves to smack me in the face and tell me I'm worthless. O, we have such fun together. [a wind comes up and begins to howl. Pip takes notice] But it's getting dark, Mom and Dad. I'll see you again soon. [walks off, but there's a fear in him as he walks through the graveyard. He has his hands in his coat pockets. He is snatched up from behind] Wa-a-ah!
ESCAPED CONVICT
Wha' are you doin' 'ere, you little whippersham!
PIP
[fearless] Oh, hello. Why, you look like an escaped convict. Did we breaky-wakys out of prison? [the surprised man lets him down] Oh dear! But you're shackled. Here, let me help you. [whips out some bolt cutters]
ESCAPED CONVICT
Wha' are you doin' wit' those?
PIP
I'm an apprentice blacksmith. [snips the arm and leg shackles in two] There you are. [puts the bolt cutters away and whips out some food] And here's a sandwich. You must be starving! [the man takes the sandwich, then walks away]
ESCAPED CONVICT
[stops and turns] Here. W-why are you easy to help me?
PIP
Well, it's not for me to judge you, sir. We are all the same. [the man turns and walks away] Don't quite all smell the same, I'm afraid. [walks out of the graveyard towards his residence, a rambling one-story shack. The sound of smithing is heard in the background]
MRS. JOE
[sees him enter and grabs him by the scarf] Pip, where 'ave you been?!
PIP
Waaah! [is whipped towards the opposite wall, which he hits hard, but he recovers instantly] Lovely day, isn't it?
MRS. JOE
What the hell's lovely about it?! [to someone else - a burly man working on some metal] Joe, teach this boy some bloody cynicism!
JOE
I don't know about that. I just thought I'd keep to me blacksmithing. [looks at his project] Ey, look! I've made me a metal fire poker. [holds it up]
MRS. JOE
A lot of bloody good a fire poker's gonna do while I'm starvin' to death! Why don't you make us some bloody food to eat!
JOE
[finishes another item and sets down his hammer] Alright. Look 'ere, I made me a metal orange. [shows it off]
MRS. JOE
STOP your metal orange, you bastard! You never want a tablespoon of nigh'ingale droppin's, you me'al-poundin' fairy! [Pip is shown] And you! Why don't you ge' a job?! You're eight years old now!
JOE
[finishing yet another project] Oh, lookie heeah! [holds up a newspaper] I've gone and made a metal newspaper!
MRS. JOE
Shut up, you silly lip! What are we supposed to do with a metal newspaper?
JOE
Well, for starters we can look in the want ads and see if we can find Pip a job. Ohhh, lookie here! Young man wanted for paid position!
MRS. JOE
Where? [Joe shows her the paper]
PIP
Where?
MRS. JOE
"Havisham residence seeks young boy to play with lonely daughter. Will pay up to..." TWENTY QUID A DAY??
PIP
That's a lot of [hops] money-loney.
JOE
You can keep a little girl company for 20 quid a day, Pip. And Old Mrs. Havisham is the wealthiest woman in the town. [Mrs. Joe walks away]
[The Havisham Residence is shown from the gates, next day.]
[The South Park Classics study. The British is seated in an armchair reading a book]
NARRATOR
Well, the very next day, Pip went to Old Ms. Havisham's house to inquire about the job. [Pip rings the door bell pulley at Havisham Estate, then a shot of the narrator] and it was there that he met the girl of his dreams.
[A girl approached the gate at the Havisham Residence. She's got flowing blonde hair and a bowler for a hat]
GIRL
Who are you?! [there's venom in her voice]
PIP
...I've come to answer the want ad.
GIRL
Is that so, you smelly little bastard?!
PIP
[jarred] What??
GIRL
[opens the gate and lets him in] This way, you pathetic squirt of vaginal discharge! [leads him to the entrance and through the front doors, then to their left] This way, you beef-witted shriveled-up monkey's penis. [leads him up the grand stairway] Up here, you gamy mass of baby vomit! [the place suffers from neglect, as spiderwebs hang from the chandeliers and walls around the mansion. The windows are covered over with paper. The girl leads Pip down the hall upstairs] In here.
PIP
Eho. After you, miss.
GIRL
I'm not going in there, you stupid puddle of a homeless man urine!
[The Havisham Estate, upstairs. Pip enters a grand dining room in which everything is covered, and has been for a long time. He scans the room until a voice gets his attention.]
MS. HAVISHAM
[an elderly lady still in wedding veil] Who is that?
PIP
I've come to answer the want ad, ma'am.
MS. HAVISHAM
[beckons] Come closer. Look at me. [Pip closes the door and approaches] Does it frighten you to look upon a woman who has not seen the sun in over 20 years?
PIP
Oh, no, no! You you sort of look upon one when you have not seen the sun for over 20 years quite a lot these... days.
MS. HAVISHAM
I sometimes have sick fancies. [puts her hands together] And I have a fancy I should like to see someone play. So, play. Play.
PIP
[not sure what she wants] Um. [begins to dance. The girl enters, glances at him, then continues to Ms. Havisham]
MS. HAVISHAM
Estella, play with this boy.
ESTELLA
[the blonde girl] With HIM? [Pip dances faster] But he's just a commoner!
MS. HAVISHAM
[leans over and whispers] But, you can break his heart.
ESTELLA
...Alright, boy, let us play.
PIP
Righty-o. What are we going to play?
ESTELLA
[walks over to a wood pile, gets a log, and brings it with her] We're going to play a little game called, "Smack the Blond Boy In the Head With a Large Log."
PIP
[hops excitedly] Oh, yes! My sister and I play that game at home all the time! [gladly bows to Estella] Who will go first? [Estella is taken aback by this gesture, as is Ms. Havisham]
ESTELLA
[frustrated] Oh, you stupid pathetic boy! [drops the log and rushes out of the room unnerved. Pip looks up quizzically]
MS. HAVISHAM
What do you think of her?
PIP
Well, uh... I think she's very pretty.
MS. HAVISHAM
Hm-m-m. What else?
PIP
I think she's rather insulting.
MS. HAVISHAM
Hm, you quite fancy her, don't you? Come back again next week. We shall "play" some more. [Pip turns and exits the room.]
[The blacksmith's house, night. Pip returns to his sister's place and gets ready to bed for the night. He falls asleep]
NARRATOR
[Off-screen] That night, Pip spent all his sleeping hours unable to get Estella's beautiful face out of his mind.
DREAM ESTELLA
Stop dreaming about me, you slow-witted rectal belch!
NARRATOR
Day after day Pip visited Estella. Sometimes they would play, sometimes they would talk. But every single day Pip's love for Estella grew.
[The Havisham Estate, garden, day. Estella is whacking Pip over the head with her log. Twice she does it, then tries a third time, but can't]
PIP
[stands up straight] Don't you wanna play anymore?
ESTELLA
[tosses her log away] Boy, do you still think I'm pretty? [draws near]
PIP
Oho. Well, yes, miss.
ESTELLA
And, do you still think I'm insulting?
PIP
Oh, um, not so much as before. [slapped by Estella] Ow!
ESTELLA
I hate you! You're an oozing, painful hemorrhoid that belches pus!
PIP
[exasperated. puts hands in coat pockets] Oh, dear.
ESTELLA
You may kiss me if you like. [offers her cheek. He looks, then kisses her on the cheek. She softens] Come. Let us walk in the daisy garden. [she leads him past a fountain in which a boy is splashing about merrily]
A BOY
Oh, what fun it is to splash about in the fountain! [points at Pip] You there, the prowling little boy! I bet you can't jump on my back! [shows Pip his back] Go on, then. Try and jump on my back!
PIP
Who is that?
ESTELLA
Just another playmate hired to amuse me. You didn't think you were the only one, did you?
PIP
Oh I... rather thought I was.
ESTELLA
Oh, you silly small-testicled boy. Come, let us walk through the rose garden. [takes his hand and leads him onward]
[The Havisham Estate, exterior. The camera looks at the second floor, focusing on Ms. Havisham]
MS. HAVISHAM
Yes, good. She will break his pathetic heart into a million pieces.
[The South Park Classics study. The British Person resumes narrating]
NARRATOR
Well, what a spot poor Pip was in. He was hired to be the friend of the very harsh and beautiful Estella. And although she treated him like dirt, or perhaps because she treated him like dirt, Pip found himself more in love with the little girl each and every day. [excitedly] Oh, bless him! Isn't he lovely?? [the cheer vanishes] But, isn't it sad? Because Pip knew that someone as sophisticated and as wealthy as Estella could never love him, for he was just a simple blacksmith's apprentice.
[The blacksmith's house, night. Joe is working on another creation. Pip watches]
JOE
[hammering away] And so you bang on this side, and bang on that side, and there you have it. [holds up some steel dice and hands them to Pip.] Your very own metal fuzzy dice.
PIP
[takes the dice] Yes. I see. [walks to a chair and sits in it] Hoh, lovely.
JOE
Eeyyyy, what's all this, Pip?
PIP
Joe, do you know anything about girls?
JOE
[resumes hammering] Sure! They're those things with vaginas in them.
PIP
[blank look then] But, do you know anything about them? About how they work.
JOE
[pauses and looks back at Pip] Oh, I don't know about that. I just like to keep to me blacksmithin'. [begins to hammer more vigorously]
PIP
Do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith?
JOE
Oh. D'ooooh. No, I don't think so, Pip. [a knock is heard at the door] Who could that be? [goes to answer the door. A lawyer, with cane and tall hat, addresses him]
LAWYER
Joe, the blacksmith?
JOE
The same.
LAWYER
I'm a lawyer from London in search of a young lad named Pip.
PIP
I'm Pip, sir.
LAWYER
Mr. Blacksmith, I've been sent here to offer you a reasonable sum of money in exchange for your apprentice. [walks over to Pip]
JOE
Oh, well, uh Pip's not for sale, sir.
LAWYER
I have a client who wishes to give this bright child a future. Anything he desires. [Joe approaches] Do you still object?
JOE
Heaven forbid I should stand in the way of Pip's future, but-
LAWYER
He will one day inherit a handsome property. But the owner of that property wants him first to travel to London and learn to be a gentleman.
JOE
That's great news! [Pip grins]
LAWYER
There's only one condition, Pip. Your benefactor wishes to remain anonymous.
PIP
Oho. But it must be Ms. Havisham!
LAWYER
OH OH! If you have any suspicion of who that person might be, you are to keep it in your own breast. Understood?
PIP
Yes sir.
LAWYER
Then you will go to London in a week's time. [deposits some money on the table] Here's 20 sterling. Well, blacksmith, you look stunned.
JOE
I am, sir.
LAWYER
Then I should take my leave. [heads for the door] Good evening, gentlemen, and we shall see you in London next week, Pip. [exits]
PIP
Good-bye, sir.
JOE
[picks Pip up] Pip! [close-up on a grinning Pip] A young gentleman! Of great expectations!
[London, a foggy night. Big Ben peals in the background. The camera pans down from the skyline to a horse-drawn carriage, which comes to a stop. Pip and the lawyer get out]
LAWYER
You shall stay here with your roommate, Mr. Pocket. He is a distinguished young lad who will help you on your way to being a gentleman. I trust you see no problem with this?
PIP
None, sir.
LAWYER
I should think not. [taps his cane on the ground twice] On up, then, and prepare for school on the morrow.
PIP
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. [goes to the residence and opens the front door, then enters]
[The Dormitory. Pip walks down the hall and finds a door with his name under that of Mr. Pocket. He is about to knock when a boy opens the door]
A BOY
Mr. Pip? [it's the same one seen in the fountain earlier]
PIP
Mr. Pocket?
POCKET
Pray, come in! [drags him in.]
PIP
Thank you kindly. You do look rather familiar
POCKET
As do you. Perhaps we've seen each other before. As to our lodging, it's not by any means splendid. This is our sitting room - just chairs and tables and carpet and so forth. [leads Pip to the bedrooms] This is my little room - rather musty, and this is your bedroom. [displays the next room over]
PIP
My, how lovely.
POCKET
Oh, what a gay time we shall have, and I do mean gay as in festive, not as in penetration of the bum. Oh, but dear me! I beg your pardon! You're holding your bags all this time! Pray, let me take them! [takes the bags to Pip's room] I'm quite ashamed!
PIP
Oh it's... quite alright. [remembers] Lord bless me! Why, you're the pale young man I saw at Ms. Havisham's house!
POCKET
Why, yes of course! You're the prowling little boy! Boy, what a smashing coincidence!
PIP
Perhaps, but perhaps not. Ms. Havisham is very generous indeed.
POCKET
That old biddy? Oh, I assure you, I have nothing to do with her anymore. She's absolutely mad!
PIP
Well, what do you mean?
POCKET
Well, don't you know about Ms. Havisham's melancholy past? Dear me, it's quite a story, and should be discussed over dinner. Come! [Pip removes his hat and they walk over to the table at one corner of the sitting room, by the windows. A cooked bird and two glasses wait for them] Right, time for a smashing meal and the story of Ms. Havisham.
PIP
Pocket, may I ask you a favor? I am desperately trying to become a gentleman! For the love of a certain girl. So, will you please tell me if I do something wrong at the table?
POCKET
You'll do fine, dear fellow, just fine. Now on to Ms. Havisham: She was raised by a wealthy father and grew up to be a somewhat of a spoiled brat. [Pip eats his food with his knife] And now I might mention, Pip, that in London it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth.
PIP
[with knife by lips] Hoh, dear, I'm terribly sorry! [lowers the knife]
POCKET
[joyfully] Not at all, I'm sure. [looks at Pip] Anyway, Ms. Havisham grew up to be a lovely young lady, and soon a man came along, which gets me to the cruel part of the story, merely breaking off, Pip [who has placed his napkin in his glass], to remark that a dinner napkin should never be placed into the tumbler.
PIP
[quickly retracts it] Sorry! Sorry!
POCKET
[joyfully] Not at all, I'm sure. [resumes] So this man pursued Ms. Havisham closely and professed to be devoted to her. She passionately loved him back. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dress was bought, the wedding guests were all invited, and finally the day came. But not the groom. [Pip farts] And I break from the tale now only to mention that one should never pass gas at the dinner table!
PIP
Oh. Excuse me.
POCKET
Not at all, I'm sure. So the groom never showed. He simply wrote a letter, a letter that Ms. Havisham received 20 minutes before the wedding.
PIP
At half nine, the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house.
POCKET
But afterward she laid waste to the entire house, as you have seen it, and has never since looked upon the light of day. And the story ends, Pip, with me suggesting that one should never pull out the wee wee and check it for scabs whilst at the table.
PIP
Terribly sorry, Pocket.
POCKET
[joyfully] Not at all, I'm sure!
[The South Park Classics study. The British Person resumes narrating]
NARRATOR
And so Pip spent the next several months learning how to be a gentleman. He was schooled in several languages. He was taught fencing and marksmanship, and he was shown how to dance and eat box. And after it all, after WEEKS and weeks of intense schooling, Pip was finally a full-fledged gentleman. Proud of himself, Pip decided to pay Ms. Havisham a visit, to thank her for her generosity, and to see if he was indeed, now, good enough for Estella.
[The Havisham Estate, exterior, then interior, at the dining room.]
PIP
[enters the dining room] Good evening, Ms. Havisham. [she hasn't moved from her spot]
MS. HAVISHAM
Come closer, Pip. [he doffs his hat and approaches] My, you're quite the gentleman now, aren't you?
PIP
[cheerfully] Thanks to you.
MS. HAVISHAM
Perhaps. Estella's been off to school as well. [Pip walks to Ms. Havisham's side] She's become quite the lady. Would you like to see a picture of her? [shows him a portrait]
PIP
Oh, my! She is even prettier than before. [she is shown wearing a beautiful pink dress and a makeover]
MS. HAVISHAM
Ohoh, you love her, don't you, Pip?
PIP
[pensive] I don't know. I mean, I think about her every day.
MS. HAVISHAM
Do you know what love is, Pip? It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to snip it.
PIP
Righto.
MS. HAVISHAM
Love her, Pip. I developed her into what she is so that she might... be loved.
PIP
Yes, but... where will I find her?
MS. HAVISHAM
There's a dance at the Palace tomorrow night. Estella will be there. Go and seek her out. And love her. Love her!
PIP
Thank you, Ms. Havisham! For everything! [heads for the door] I'm the happiest boy in the land!
MS. HAVISHAM
And if she warms to you, love her; she tears your heart into pieces. And as you get older it will tear deeper. [whispers] Lover her.
[The South Park Classics study. The British Person resumes narrating]
NARRATOR
Yes. Our young Pip had come a long way. From the apprentice of a blacksmith to a fine young gentleman of great expectations. And now he was to finally see his beloved Estella again at a Grand Ball held by the King of England, Tony Blair. It was here that Pip would finally and formally ask Estella to be his girlfriend. And all would be right with the world.
[The Grand Ballroom at the Palace, evening. Tony Blair and wife descend the Grand Staircase as dozens of couples dance before them. The camera then pans across the scene and stops on Estella. Pip comes in from the side]
PIP
Hello, Estella.
ESTELLA
Pip. [impressed] My goodness, how you've changed!
PIP
Yes. I've become a gentleman. May I? [signals an invitation to dance]
ESTELLA
I suppose. [a waltz starts and all couples begin to dance.] So how is it that you've learned to dress and dance?
PIP
Well, I was sent to be schooled in London.
ESTELLA
Iiii see, and you no longer live with the blacksmith?
PIP
Oh. I see Joe once in a while. But I don't have much in common with him anymore, now that I'm a gentleman and all.
ESTELLA
Naturally. [overview of the Grand Ballroom]
PIP
[walks off to one side with Estella] It is wonderful to see you again, Estella.
ESTELLA
Is it? Why? [they resume dancing]
PIP
Because I believe I'm in love with you.
ESTELLA
Pip, you must know that I have no heart.
PIP
[confidently] I think you do.
ESTELLA
Oh, I have a heart to be shot or stabbed in, no doubt, and if it cease to beat I should cease to be, but [sighs] you know what I mean. I have no softness there, no sympathy, sentiment.
PIP
I see past that, Estella. I see a little girl who wants to be warm and kind.
OLDER BOY
[walks up to the kids] Hey, Estella, let's get out of here.
ESTELLA
Alright, Steve. Just one moment. [Steve walks off]
PIP
Who...? Who is that?
ESTELLA
That is Steve. He is seventeen and has a car.
PIP
I see, and you... fancy this Steve fellow?
ESTELLA
I should. He's my boyfriend.
PIP
[scared] Boyfriend??
ESTELLA
What's the matter, Pip?!
PIP
I don't understand! I did everything right! I stopped being a poor commoner! I even blew off my lovin' Joe!
ESTELLA
It's... it's... the way it goes sometimes, Pip. [Steve waits for her off to the side] He's... seventeen and has a car. I'm... I'm... very [pause] I'm [pause] leaving. [walks off with Steve.]
[The Havisham Estate, outside, a stormy night. Pip reaches the Havisham estate and enters the front gates. He heads into the house, up the spiral staircase, and into the dining room.]
PIP
Ms. Havisham! You have to talk to Estella! She's going out with a- [a surprised look comes over his face]
MS. HAVISHAM
Well well well, if it isn't Mr. Pip. [Estella and Steve are already there, sitting behind a small table at her side, next to each other, sharing a float between them]
PIP
Ms. Havisham! But um...
MS. HAVISHAM
Don't they make a handsome couple, Pip? [Steve reaches for Estella's right hand with his left] Look at the way he holds her hand.
PIP
But I don't understand. [doffs his hat] You sent me away to become a gentleman so that I could be with Estella.
MS. HAVISHAM
Things aren't always as they seem, Pip. [Pip looks defeated] Oh, what's the matter? Did she... break your heart?
PIP
[close-up] ...Well, I suppose that if you set out to break my heart, you did a very good job of it. Because it certainly does hurt.
MS. HAVISHAM
Yes. Tell me about the pain. [Estella looks distressed] Tell me about the crushing and the prickly things.
PIP
It's... a-as if...[winces] sssomeone has a hold of my heart and isss [winces] squeezing it very tightly.
MS. HAVISHAM
Yes, and it is somewhat difficult to breathe.
STEVE
Hey, wait a second. You mean that this whole thing was just a setup by your mom?
MS. HAVISHAM
[turns her head to look at Steve] Is your heart broken as well? Tell me all about it.
PIP
But why do you make your daughter hurt people?
MS. HAVISHAM
Wuh-hy? Well, that's simple. Because I need the tears of broken-hearted men to use in my Genesis device. [Pip looks at her in horror] You see, my foolish child, I'm growing very old. But tonight I will fuse my soul into Estella's once and for all. And then I can go on breaking men's hearts for another generation.
STEVE
What the hell??
MS. HAVISHAM
Estella, prepare yourself for the Genesis platform. [Estella draws away from Steve]
STEVE
[holds on to Estella's left arm] Oh no, you don't! You're my girl! And I'm not lettin' you walk out on me! [Ms. Havisham flips opens a panel on the right arm of her chair and presses a red button. A contraption appears and wraps itself around Steve] What the?! [a cathode at the top of the head completes the contraption]
MS. HAVISHAM
And as for you, Pip, my robot monkeys should take care of you! [presses the button again and robot monkeys descend from the ceiling and clamor around Pip. He is startled and rushes out the door, down the stairs, out the front door, and out the front gates, only to stop and faint outside the gates]
[The blacksmith's house, day. A shadow appears at Pip's door and falls on him. He awakens and looks at the source of the shadow]
JOE
Pip? Pip, old chap? [appears blurry to Pip.]
PIP
[rises a bit] Joe?
JOE
That's right. You're safe and warm now.
POCKET
[stands next to Joe] Joe found you lying face down in the street, Mr. Pip, You were in such a state. You've been unconscious here for nearly three hours.
PIP
[sits up and says urgently] Ms. Havisham! She has all the men who have had their hearts broken by Estella trapped in her house! [laments] Oh, why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman?
JOE
Well, about that, Pip: There's another person who wants to see you. [the convict Pip had set free earlier returns, but he's nicely dressed now, in three-piece suit and gloves]
ESCAPED CONVICT
Allo, Pip. You remember me? [Pip cowers and remembers...]
ESCAPED CONVICT
[threatening him back at the graveyard when they first met] I'll rip off your arms and shove 'em up your arse!
PIP
Why, you're the escaped convict I helped a long time ago.
ESCAPED CONVICT
Yes. After you helped me I moved to Wales and made somethin' o' myself. If it weren't for you, I'd have never become a millionaire.
JOE
'E's the one that sent you to London, Pip! 'E's the one who sent you off to be a gentleman!
PIP
You? But why?
ESCAPED CONVICT
Because back then you treated me like any other person. You're weren't a snob and you helped me as you would a rich man.
PIP
Oh, dear. All this time I thought it was Ms. Havisham. She totally let me believe it. [Pocket approaches]
POCKET
I tried to tell you, Pip. She's a vengeful, spiteful woman, who wanted nothing more than to see you hurt along with the rest of the male sex.
PIP
Well, I've certainly learned a lot. That being a gentleman doesn't mean learning to dance, or proper table manners. It means being a gentle man. Gentle to everyone.
POCKET
Righto. Pip. Righto.
PIP
And now I suppose there's only one thing left to do.
JOE
What's that, Pip.
PIP
If Ms. Havisham is determined to do this to others, let's go KICK HER ARSE!
JOE
Yeah! [Pocket raises his hands, Joe and the convict pump their fists]
[The South Park Classics study. The British Person resumes narrating]
NARRATOR
And now we come to the final act of the Dickens classic tale, in which the stage is set for an epic showdown. Ms. Havisham's robot monkeys prove a formidable foe, but Pip is not about to let Estella's soul be forever consumed by the Genesis device. And now the thrilling conclusion of Great Expectations!
[The Havisham Estate, outside, a stormy night. In the dining room Ms. Havisham prepares Estella for the Genesis device]
MS. HAVISHAM
Are you ready, Estella? Are you ready to complete the cycle?
ESTELLA
Yes, Mother. [Ms. Havisham straps herself into her seat, and the main door fly open. In come Joe and Pocket with swords, the Escaped Convict with a pistol, and Pip with a filled bag]
PIP
Not so fast, you ugly ancient bitch.
ESTELLA
Pip? [Ms. Havisham presses the red button once again.and her chair floats forward]
JOE
[wielding his sward] Your manhating days are over, Ms. Havisham!
MS. HAVISHAM
Quite the contrary, blacksmith. My revenge on the male race is only about to begin.
POCKET
Dear God, Pip, look! [points to a long contraption containing men and boys hanging upside down from their ankles. Bowls wait underneath them to receive their tears.]
STEVE
[second from left] Estella, help me! I'm your boyfriend!
BOY
[third from right] So am I.
MAN
[left of center] And me.
MAN IN MIDDLE
We were all Estella's boyfriends at one time or another. Now we're doomed.
MS. HAVISHAM
Yes. Cry away, males. [returns to her original position] Once your tears have collected into the Genesis device, the fusion of Estella and me will be complete.
PIP
You won't get away with this!
MS. HAVISHAM
Won't I? [presses the red button, and robot monkeys again descend from the ceiling and come at the guests. Joe and the others use their weapons to fend off the attacks.] Let the transformation begin. [the cables have been activated]
JOE
[disables a robot monkey by slicing its leg off] Pip, she started the device! [the men on the torture device bawl]
PIP
[approaches among the robot monkey corpses] Pocket! Get over there, and do whatever it takes to keep those blokes from crying!
POCKET
Righto, Pip. [they do their tasks]
MS. HAVISHAM
[activates the device full throttle] It begins.
PIP
[approaches Estella] Come, Estella! You can't want to be part of this.
ESTELLA
It is... what I was raised for. [a robot monkey jumps at the Escaped Convict, and the Escaped Convict shoots at it and kills it off]
ROBOT MONKEY
AAAAAAA!!!
POCKET
Hello, gentlemen. Oh, whatever you do, please do not cry. Havisham's device fuels itself on your tears, I'm afraid.
MAN
How are we not to cry. Our hearts have been broken, our lives ruined, and now we are set to die!
POCKET
Yes, but just think about... panda bears! [the hanging males just look at him] Oh, they're so cuddly and sweet, panda bears are. [grabs his own nose] What silly little noses they have!
MAN
[third from left] Panda bears make me sad. They're almost extinct.
POCKET
[quickly waves the thought away with both hands] Oh, right, right, let's not think about panda bears, then. Let's think about ...swimming! Oh, what jolly fun swimming is, with a splishy-splash and a hold-your-breath dive. [the males just look at him]
MS. HAVISHAM
...Yes...
ESCAPED CONVICT
[quickly approaches] Get out of that chair, you old cow! [points a gun at her, and she spits a green fluid into his face. A few moments later he turns away and his face has been eaten away by the fluid, revealing bones and teeth.. He babbles on a bit, then drops down dead.]
PIP
[still before Estella] Estella! Listen to me! You are a wonderful girl, with a kind heart.
ESTELLA
I told you, Pip. I have no heart.
PIP
But you do! And I shall prove it to you once and for all! [reaches into his bag. Joe is still fending off the robot monkeys. Pip pulls out a bunny] Look at this adorable little bunny.
ESTELLA
[flatly] Oh my. 'E's very cute.
PIP
You see that? A heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny. They'd just as soon break its neck. [she reaches out to grab it, then breaks its neck with nary a flinch] ...Oh. But look at this bunny. [pulls out another bunny from the bag and presents it to her] There. You see that? You have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies. [she reaches out to grab it, then breaks its neck. Pip gets worried] ...Right.
POCKET
[still diverting the guys on the rack] Oh what fun it is to collect stamps! Lick the backs, put them into books all neat and tidy with those smashing little pictures and bright colors.
MAN
[left of center] My father died in a stamp-collecting accident.
POCKET
Right, let's not talk about stamp-collecting, then. Let's talk about... [thinks a bit]
MAN IN MIDDLE
Ice-skating!
POCKET
Oh what fun ice-skating is! [moves around as if ice-skating] Who can catch me? Who can catch the ice-skating king? That's me.
JOE
[now covered in robot monkeys] Oy can't figh' 'em off no moh!
PIP
Nine. Nine baby bunnies. A person with a heart could never kill nine baby bunnies. So you do have too big a heart to- [crrrack. Estella has killed another bunny] Ten baby bunnies!
JOE
[still fighting the robot monkeys] ...There's too many of them! [the males on the rack begin to cry]
POCKET
Please, sirs, you must not cry!
MAN
[left of center] We can't help it! You're bawlin' us to tears! [lights under the rack flick on one by one, and the sequence leads to a computer, and then to the Genesis device]
POCKET
Philip, it's too late!!
PIP
Twenty-six baby bunnies
ESTELLA
I don't want to. I don't see the point in this.
PIP
What?
ESTELLA
I don't want to kill any more of them.
PIP
There! You see?! You do have a heart!
ESTELLA
You think so? Let me see it [referring to the bunny] Maybe I can kill it.
PIP
[quickly hides the bunny] No no, I'm sure of it. You have a heart! You've bought your own life! Come with me now! [she looks back at him]
MS. HAVISHAM
Yessss! [electricity crackles and then moves over to Estella's part of the Genesis device. Estella looks up at Ms. Havisham, then stretches her hand out to Pip. Pip takes her hand and quickly takes her away from the device. Ms. Havisham looks over] Noooo! [her chair bursts into flames and she screams horribly, twisting here and there]
POCKET
Ooooo, top smart, Pip! [Ms. Havisham's body quickly turns to ashes]
JOE
You did it, Pip! [the last of the robot monkeys falls away]
[The Havisham Estate, outside, a stormy night. Joe, Pip, Pocket, the nine males, and Estella leave the house as flames spread from the dining room to other rooms and onto the yard. The party moves towards the gate, then turns back to watch the burning house]
JOE
Well, I guess Old Ms. Havisham won't be takin' any revenge on any more blokes, ey?
ESTELLA
Yes. her poor miserable life is finally over.
PIP
You're released from her now, Estella! Now we can begin our life together!
ESTELLA
Yes! Yes, my small-testicled love! [she and Pip embrace]
POCKET
Oh, I'm so glad everything has worked out. [Pip and Estella break the embrace] Where are all my little bunnies that you borrowed then, Pip?
[The South Park Classics study. The British Person finishes narrating]
NARRATOR
And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Pocket, who died of hepatitis B. [closes the book and rests it on his laps] So ends Charles Dickens' Great Expectations. We hope you now have a deeper appreciation for Pip, and indeed, [holds up the book] all masterpieces of literature like this one. [rests it again] Until next time, I'm a British person. Good night.
End of Pip

synopsis:Cartman decides to seek friendship using the Internet, and finds an older man who is more than willing to be his friend...and more.

script:Cartman Joins NAMBLA

[Kenny's house, day. Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny sit around a Monopoly-type board game in Kenny's room]
CARTMAN
Okay, Stan, I'm gonna you... a UFO crash-landing card! [tosses it in front of him] You can deny it, or cover it up.
STAN
Dude, I don't understand this game at all.
CARTMAN
[Front of board game box is seen with 'Kurtis' spelled incorrectly with a 'C'] It's "Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis" funtime game. You have to decide if you deny it or cover it up.
STAN
Um, deny it?
CARTMAN
Okay, let's see what Bill Kurtis says. [presses an electronic Bill Kurtis head]
ELECTRONIC HEAD
[trembles from side to side] Hello, I'm Bill Kurtis. Many believe that the U.S. Government... covered it up. I'm Bill Kurtis.
KYLE
Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card. [tosses it in front of him] You lose a turn.
STAN
Sweet.
CARTMAN
Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you... AIDS! [tosses the card in front of him]
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
I just gave you AIDS.
KYLE
AIDS?! [looks confused]
STAN
Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS.
CARTMAN
Kyle has AIDS, and now loses 47 turns [Kyle turns angry] and 800 points. [camera pans back, and Kenny's parents appear at the door with arms around each other]
CAROL
Kenny, your dad and I are thinking about having another baby. Wouldn't you like to have another brother or sister?
KENNY
(No.)
STUART
[tickling his wife] We just might get workin' on it later tonight, huh huh huh. [they walk off giggling]
CARTMAN
God-damnit, poor people suck! Your family is already on welfare, and now they're gonna bring another kid into the world. Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they're expecting me to pay for it with my tax dollars.
STAN
You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!
CARTMAN
...You see. [stands] Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even relate to you guys anymore because you're too immature!
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
I've gotta start hanging out with friends that are a little more intelligent, and understand ...politics and stuff. It's just that... I'm up on this level up here [hovers his right hand at eye level], and all my friends are down here [hovers it at stomach level].
KYLE
You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!
CARTMAN
Nononono! Me h'myah [hand at eye level], you guys myah! [hand at chest level] — maybe a little mo down, down in hyah. [hand at foot level. Then he straightens up] SCREW YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME. [turns around, walks out, and towards the front door.]
ELECTRONIC HEAD
I'm Bill Kurtis.
[Cartman's house, a few minutes later. Cartman paces the floor in his room. Next to him is a computer]
CARTMAN
I've outgrown all my friends. I need to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog. [looks at Clyde Frog for a few seconds, then] Oh, great idea, Clyde Frog! [walks over to the chair and hops on] I can meet new friends on the Internet! [clicks the mouse and presses a few keys, then the computer chimes. A list of chat rooms comes up] Here's a chat room: "Men Who Like Young Boys" [moves the cursor to the title and clicks on it] That's perfect. [starts typing] Hi everybody! I am a young boy seeking an older male for good times. I am eight years old and would li- [replies start cascading over his message] Wow! Look at all these guys who wanna be my friend! I'll pick... Tony316. [click on Tony's reply and starts typing] Hi Tony. [clicks and reads the reply] "So what are you into?" [replies] Oh, you know, the usual stuff. Smiley-face. [clicks and reads the reply] "Kewl. Wanna get together? [softer] Smiley-face?" [replies] Sure, Tony! That would be... kewl. Winking, smiley, face. [clicks and reads the reply] "Meet me at Mel's Buffet restaurant tomorrow morning." [replies] Sounds good. See you then! Clown hat, curly hair, smiley-face. [clicks, then brightly] You see that, Clyde Frog? Tomorrow I'm gonna meet my first mature friend!
[Mel's Buffet, next day. Cartman enters and approaches a man seated alone in a booth.]
CARTMAN
Hi, are you Tony? [the man looks unusually friendly]
TONY
Yeah. You're -Eric?
CARTMAN
Yeah! [gets into the booth and sits next to Tony]
TONY
[meekly, hands a bag to Cartman] I brought you some candy.
CARTMAN
[takes the bag] Wow, cool!
TONY
[hands him two books] And some books on Kama Sutra.
CARTMAN
Neato! Having older friends kicks ass, uh! You see, I've, I've really been having a tough time. I've kind of matured faster than my other friends [Tony places his hand on Cartman's back and starts rubbing with an open smile]; we don't really relate anymore, and, and uh, alright uh, all my friends seem so childish now.
TONY
Yahahahah like having your back rubbed?
CARTMAN
Heh, yeah! That feels real nice! Thanks. [two agents burst through the main door and head for Tony and Cartman]
AGENT
Hold it right there, scumbag!
TONY
[Quickly removes hands from Cartman] Huh?
CARTMAN
Huh?
AGENT
[pulls out some handcuffs] We monitored your little online chat. [cuffs Tony] Now you're coming with us! [hauls him away]
TONY
[meekly] No! [the two agents whisk him outside]
CARTMAN
[concerned] What the hell just happened?
[Kenny's house, early morn. Kenny's tossing in bed, apparently in a nightmare. His dreams are shown, and in each a parent carries a baby]
MOM
You can't eat, Kenny. We have to save food for the baby.
DAD
Your mom and I are going out for a few weeks, Kenny. Take care of the baby.
MOM
Kenny, you have to change the baby's diapers!
DAD
You have to share your room with the baby!
MOM
The baby.
DAD
The baby!
MOM
The baby!!
KENNY
[wakes and sits up] (HAAAAAAAAGH!) [looks around]
[Kenny's house, living room sofa, later. Stuart is tickling his wife again]
CAROL
[giggles] Stop it!
STUART
Come on, let's go try to get you pregnant again.
CAROL
Oh, alright. [they get up and move when Kenny arrives with glove and baseball]
KENNY
(Dad, I wanna play catch.)
STUART
Huh? Uh, I'll play catch with your later, son.
KENNY
(But I wanna play now!)
CAROL
Oh, go ahead. We can make love afterwards.
STUART
Aw, alright.
[Kenny's house, front lawn. Kenny stands in the driveway and Stuart stands in front of the tattered sofa]
STUART
Well alright, here comes a pop fly. See if you can catch it! [tosses it high, but straight for Kenny's glove. Kenny catches it] Good job. Now throw me one. [Kenny takes the ball out of the glove, looks at it in anger, and shoots it straight for his father's groin. Stuart doubles over in pain and covers his crotch] Ohp! Guhhogh! [groaning, he ends up on his side, then throws up]
CAROL
[opens the door and rushes out] What happened?!
STUART
Aw, he smacked me in the balls! [groans some more. Kenny tosses the glove to his mother]
KENNY
[goes inside] (Woohoo!) [Stuart groans some more, then vomits]
[Cartman's house, day. He's back at the computer in his room]
CARTMAN
Okay, we'll try this again. [starts typing as BigBoned] Hi, everyone. I am a young boy looking for fun times with older male. I like to- [More quickly than before, his screen fills with cascading replies. He picks one] Oh, this one looks good: HungDaddy. [starts typing] Hello, HungDaddy. [reads the reply] "Hi. I'm eight and a half inches." Damn, dude, this guy's tiny. He must be a dwarf. [Says out loud:] Sorry, I'm not interested in being friends with midgets. [Types and says:] Midgets piss me off. Frowny face. [clicks and moves on] Lemme see, how about this one?
[The South Park docks, day. Cartman walks towards the end, where a man in trench coat and baseball cap looks out over the water.]
CARTMAN
[draws close to the man] Mister Hammerhead?
MR. HAMMERHEAD
[turns around and is instantly recognizable] Hi there.
CARTMAN
Mr. Garrison??
MR. GARRISON
[startled] Haah! Eric!
CARTMAN
You wanna be my friend?
MR. GARRISON
Oh, crap!
CARTMAN
That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first?
MR. GARRISON
Huh-uh, nothing! Nothing! [four agents appear and head for him]
AGENT
Alright, scumbag, we got you!
MR. GARRISON
[voice quivering] Hey uh, uh, uh. Good thing you guys came. This... little boy was trying to have his way with me.
AGENT
Nice try, buddy! We monitored your little online chat—now, you're coming with us! [the four agents, two on either side of Garrison, take him away]
MR. GARRISON
No-o!
CARTMAN
Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those guys!
[South Park Clinic, day. Stan and Kyle stand before a picture window.]
KYLE
See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines. [elderly people are seen hooked up to them] Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out.
STAN
Oh, man, that's terrible.
KYLE
I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this. [plants his lips wide on the glass and blows out] Waaaaah! [as the seal takes hold, his cheeks puff up and the inside of his his mouth shows clearly — it is a blow face. Stan smiles]
STAN
Haha, he-yeah ha. [makes his own blow face] Haaaaah.
KYLE
[makes the blow face and wags his tongue at the patients] Bleuh-leuh-leuh-leuh-leuh.
STAN
[does the same] Blaaa-lalalalalalala.
CARTMAN
[walks up] Alright, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing?!
STAN
[looks and then faces him. Kyle follows] We're making faces at sick people.
CARTMAN
No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being "mys-teriously" arrested, huh?! [Stan and Kyle are confused and look at each other]
STAN
We don't know.
CARTMAN
I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me!
KYLE
We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt.
CARTMAN
Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?!
STAN
You're not more mature than us, Cartman!
CARTMAN
YES I AM!! [Stan and Kyle back up a bit. Cartman turns and walks away]
[South Park Police Department, day. Mr. Garrison and Tony are in the cell, and Officer Barbrady sits at a desk with his feet up]
MR. GARRISON
I'm telling you, this is all a terrible mistake, Officer Barbrady.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, the FBI said I have to hold you here, so that's what I'm gonna do, Mr. Complainy Pants.
MR. GARRISON
O-ogh! [returns to the bed and sits]
TONY
Do you like having your back rubbed?
MR. GARRISON
Eat me, pervert!
TONY
Okay. [some commotion is heard outside. A group of men is seen approaching and the front door opens. The men walk in and approach the desk]
MAN
We demand you release these men at once!
OFFICER BARBRADY
Who are you?
MAN
We are NAMBLA, the North American Man Boy Love Association, and we heard about these political prisoners you're keeping?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Political prisoners? No, these are child molesters.
MAN
Loving young boys has been around since the time of the Romans, pal! There's nothing wrong with it! We are an organization dedicated to showing that sex between a man and a young boy can be a beautiful thing!
OTHER NAMBLA MEN
[ad lib] Yeah, uh-huh.
OFFICER BARBRADY
[stands up] Uuuh, I don't know who you are, but these men aren't going anywhere until I hear from the FBI.
MAN
Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!
OTHER NAMBLA MEN
Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!
OFFICER BARBRADY
Okay people [the men fall silent], I think you'd better move along before I arrest more of you!
MAN
All these men wanted was to love a young boy! [pounds the table a few times] There is nothing wrong with love!
MR. GARRISON
I did not want love from a young boy! I like men my own age. [gasps and shrieks] Aah! I mean, I like women! What did I say?-Oh God! I love titties!
MAN
You haven't heard the last of us, officer! Together we are strong. [turns and heads for the door] Come on, men! [the others follow him out, chattering]
OFFICER BARBRADY
[sits back down and plops his feet up] Wow, they've got activists for everything these days.
[South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch, night with eery lightning overhead and thunder heard. Dr. Mephesto and Kevin are at a lab table]
DR. MEPHESTO
I've done it, Kevin. I've successfully spliced this chipmunk with a piece of provolone cheese. [the "cheesemunk"in the box groans] Do you know what this means, Kevin? No more will the world have to look in two different places for squirrels and provolone cheese. No more will mankind have to pick- [the doorbell rings] Who could that be? [walks over and opens the door] Why, it's little Eric Cartman.
CARTMAN
Dr. Mephesto, I need help.
DR. MEPHESTO
Well of course, come in.
CARTMAN
[follows Mephesto and Kevin in] You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me.
DR. MEPHESTO
[stops and faces him] Oh, Eric, I'm afraid it's not that simple. Genetic engineering has not yet evolved to the state where I can just make people.
CARTMAN
Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!
DR. MEPHESTO
Oh. Well, I happen to be a member of an organization that can help you. It's called, NAMBLA.
CARTMAN
NAMBLA?
DR. MEPHESTO
Yes. I have been a member for several years. I'm sure they'd let you join. You l-look about right.
CARTMAN
Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto! [turns and walks out]
DR. MEPHESTO
Sure!
[South Park Inn. "No Vacancy" "Welcome NAMBLA." Inside, the NAMBLA leader speaks to the group in a meeting room. On either side of him are portraits of men with boys on their laps. More picture line the walls]
MAN
[henceforth, NAMBLA leader] Fellow members of NAMBLA. As you know, hn hn, we continue to be discriminated against. Recently, the FBI has started to arrest men, who are doing nothing more than trying to start a sexual relationship with a young boy.
MEMBERS
Awwww.
NAMBLA LEADER
And now that all ethnic groups, homosexuals and women's are protected under civil-rights laws, [pounds on the podium] we want the same!
MEMBERS
[weakly] Yeah.
EAGER MAN
Yeh-hehah-hah.
NAMBLA LEADER
What we need is proof that young boys want to be members of NAMBLA. That they want love from us. We need a poster child, to show the world that it is a beautiful and wonderful thing and a- [Cartman enters and takes a seat. Men in the back row look on with some awe.] Can we... help you?
CARTMAN
Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?
NAMBLA LEADER
You... do?
CARTMAN
Sure.
NAMBLA LEADER
[greatly relieved] Oho, thank you. Thank you, Jesus.
CARTMAN
[looks around] ...Sweet.
[South Park Clinic, day. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny stand before the picture window. Stan and Kyle make blow faces again. The patients are dismayed. Kenny soon tries to make a blow face but his ever present hood is still on. His parents walk up]
CAROL
Well, Kenny, the doctor confirmed it. I'm pregnant! You're gonna have a little brother or sister.
KENNY
(No!!) [the camera zooms in on him]
CAROL
Yup, it's for sure!
STUART
And he fixed my shattered left testicle, too!
CAROL
Don't be out too late, Kenny. We need to start movin' stuff out of your room. [the parents walk away]
KYLE
Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny.
STAN
Yeah. Now what are you going to do?
KENNY
(I don't know. But I've gotta think of something.) [turns around and walks away in his parents' direction]
CARTMAN
[rushes up from the other direction] Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't!
KYLE
What are you talking about, fatass?
CARTMAN
Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they all think that I'm sure mature they want me to be their new poster child is all. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! [turns and walks away]
[South Park Pharmacy, day. Inside, Kenny in his normal outfit, but with a blond wig, approaches the counter.]
PHARMACIST
Can I help you, young lady?
KENNY
[wearing a blonde wig] (Yes. I'm looking for some morning-after abortion-)
PHARMACIST
Oh, you want some morning-after abortion pills. Well, they're right over there. [points to them. Kenny looks]
KENNY
(Thanks.) [walks over and looks at them. He sees "Morning After Abortion Pills," "Baby - B- Gone," "Get it outta me! (has an unknown, real woman's face pictured)" "Fetus Flusher" "Pregnant No More Super Size." He takes the "Pregnant No More" pills to the counter]
PHARMACIST
Uh, I'm sorry, young lady, but I can't sell that to you without permission from your parents. [Kenny hands him a note that reads: I hereby give my daughter permission to abort her baby -Mother] Oh, well, alrighty then. Cash or charge?
KENNY
(Cash.)
[Kenny's house, day. Kenny's in the kitchen mixing a drink. It consists of cocoa, vodka, ...and the entire bottle of "Pregnant No More" pills. All 999 of them. In a mug. He finishes, drops down, and heads for the living room]
[Kenny's house, living room. Stuart reads the paper, and Carol is knitting. Kenny enters with the mug]
KENNY
(Look, Mom. I made you something to drink.) [a rat climbs onto the sofa headrest; Stuart shoos it away]
CAROL
Oh, well that's very sweet of you, Kenny. You made my favorite drink for me.
KENNY
(Yeah.) [presents the mug]
CAROL
But unfortunately, now that I'm pregnant, I can't drink.
KENNY
(What?)
STUART
Well, I can still drink. [grabs the mug and starts chugging away]
KENNY
(No! Daddy!) [looks on as Stuart finishes the mug off]
STUART
Ogh, that hits the spot. Makes me forget all about my shattered balls. [seeing Kenny looking at him] What? Wwhat's the matter? Uh, why don't you go make me another one of... of... [his stomach starts to churn, and he holds it] Who-o-oa.
CAROL
What's the matter?
KENNY
(Uh oh.)
STUART
Oh, God, I'm gonna crap my pants! [rushes to the bathroom]
[Kenny's house, bathroom. A sign saying "CRAPPER SWEET CRAPPER" hangs on the wall. Stuart drops his pants and briefs, hops on the toilet, and starts crapping]
STUART
Oohhh, God! [farts and craps in pain] Oooh, my balls! [Kenny appears at the door. Stuart turns around and vomits into the toilet. He alternates between crapping and vomiting, farting all the while] Ooh, God [more alternating between pooping and vomiting as Kenny just stares]
[Photo-Dojo, day. Members of NAMBLA surround the photographer as he takes pictures.]
NAMBLA MEMBER
Just a few more pictures, Eric. You make a perfect poster child.
CARTMAN
Thanks, dude. [poses in his beefcake swim pants for several shots before a curtain that says "I LOVE NAMBLA"]
NAMBLA LEADER
[arrives with some other members] Uh hey, Eric, we have a surprise for you. We want to have a big dinner and dance honoring you as our new poster child.
CARTMAN
Really? Awesome![continues to pose in various ways as camera shutter sounds are heard]
NAMBLA LEADER
Yes, and we you to um... invite all your young male friends. [the guys behind him start to drool]
CARTMAN
Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature, [looks back at the camera and mumbles] excluding Stan and Kyle, of course.
NAMBLA LEADER
Great, hnn. You go invite your little friends, and we'll get the hotel ready.
CARTMAN
KIIICK ASS!
[Kenny's house, day. Kenny's on the sofa watching television.]
CAROL
[off-screen] Kenny?? Don't forget to clean out your room so we can paint it for the baby. [Kenny hops off as one commercial ends. Another one draws his attention.]
ANNOUNCER
[echo on] Hey, are you feeling down? You need some excitement. And North Park Funland has just opened its newest ride! The John Denver Experience! [the ride is demonstrated] You'll be Rocky Mountain High with this, the most EXTREME, INSANE RIDE EVER BUILT.
TWO GUYS
["ACTUAL TESTIMONIAL"] It was-
GUY 1
[holds up right thumb] -fun.
GUY 2
[holds up left thumb] -fun.
ANNOUNCER
Note: people with heart conditions and expectant mothers should not ride the JOHN DENVER! Open now! Come on down!
KENNY
(Mom!) [walks away]
[North Park Funland, day. People file in. The McCormicks are in line to go on the John Denver Experience]
STUART
Are you sure you should be going on this thing?
CAROL
Oh, it's all right. [in a low voice] You know, I think maybe Kenny's been a little worried about the new baby. We have to show him that he's still our little boy. [the line moves forward. Kenny and his parents find seats in the first row. The ride itself is wrapped in the body of a small plane, with a wing serving as a ramp]
OPERATOR
[speaks into a muffled PA system] Folks, please keep your hands and arms inside the John Denver Experience at all times. There's no sense in trying to unloop at the latch at any time during the ride at the John Denver Experience. Have fun.
STUART
What did he say? [the ride swings up smoothly, but at the top it swings into high gear, slamming into the platform during one swing, into a building during another swing, and back and forth this way a few times. Carol is enjoying it quite a bit. The ride ends with a slam into a large pool, where the plane rests upside down] ...John Denver Experience.
[North Park Funland, John Denver Experience exit. Riders exit. The McCormicks are the last ones out]
STUART
Oh, God, my nose! I think I broke my nose!
CAROL
Come on, Stuart, let's just get you to a bathroom.
STUART
Oh, I'm not gonna make it! I'm gonna be sick! [heads for the nearest trash can and vomits into it. A woman carrying her baby moves away. He grabs his stomach] Oh, my stomach! [pulls down his pants and poops in the trash can] Oh, my nose! [sneezes blood into the trash can] Gross! [vomits, poops, and sneezes, and this goes on for quite a while. Kenny simply slaps his hand to his head and rolls his eyes.]
[South Park, day. Cartman runs into the boys in front of the South Park Clinic]
CARTMAN
Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor.
KYLE
They are?
CARTMAN
We're gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my mature friends that I want. And that means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!
STAN
[angry] We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!
CARTMAN
Well, that's nice, 'cause you can't go.
KYLE
We don't wanna go!
CARTMAN
You can't go.
KYLE
We don't WANNA go!
CARTMAN
No, you CAN'T go. [turns around and walks away] Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out
STAN
Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature.
KYLE
Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too.
[Kenny's house, day. He is asleep again in his room. Another nightmare appears. The scene is a delivery room at Hell's Pass Hospital. Kenny's mom is about to give birth, and Dr. Doctor is there with a nurse and Stuart]
DR. DOCTOR
You're doing fine, Ms. McCormick. [sees Kenny sneaking a peek] It's alright, Kenny. Come see the miracle of life. [Kenny approaches and is covered in amniotic fluid as his mom's water bursts]
KENNY
(Eeww.)
DR. DOCTOR
I can see its head!
CAROL
You can?
DR. DOCTOR
Push, now. Push hard! [Carol holds onto Stuart's hand hard and pushes the baby out. The doctor shields his face] Oh my God. [the nurse screams in horror]
CAROL
What is it?? [the baby is shown; it is a mutant with long claws and a nasty disposition]
DR. DOCTOR
[turns to run] It's ali- [the mutant baby decapitates Dr. Doctor, the nurse, and Kenny]
STUART
Oh my God, it killed Kenny!
CAROL
Bad baby, bad!
KENNY
[sits up awake] (Huh. Huh??) [looks around and realizes he's awake] (That does it!) [jumps off, goes to the bathroom and gets a plunger. Then he leaves the restroom]
[Kenny's house, living room. Carol is reading a book when Kenny enters with he plunger]
CAROL
[lowers the book] Oh, hi Kenny. What are ya doin'? [he lifts the plunger and aims it at her] Uh what are you doing, Kenny? [he fixes his gaze on her] Kenny, what are you going to plunge?
KENNY
[rushes at her with the plunger] (AAAARRRRHHH!)
CAROL
Aaaaaaah! [jumps off the sofa and runs away] AAAAA! [Stuart arrives as Kenny pursues his mom]
STUART
Kenny, what the hell are you doing?! [follows them out]
[South Park Inn, day. Schmaltzy music plays as the camera looks at a large sign that says "I LOVE NAMBLA HONORARY DINNER" and has a picture of Eric posing under a spotlight at its center. Present in the ballroom are Cartman, Butters, several other boys, and the men they've partnered up with. The doors open and in walk Stan and Kyle, with their partners.]
CARTMAN
[sees them] What the hell? [hops off his chair and walks towards them] Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only!
STAN
We got invited too, fatass!
CARTMAN
Hunh. [rolls his eyes] Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA.
NAMBLA LEADER
[now at the podium, a little giddy] Fellow NAMBLA members, it is great to see you all here. It seems like we have finally found a city that won't oppress us.
NAMBLA MEMBE
Oh, yeah. [others cheer]
NAMBLA LEADER
First and foremost, I wanna recognize Eric Cartman, for putting us in touch with all of you pretty, young boys.
CARTMAN
[graciously, amid some applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. [takes a bow] Thank you.
NAMBLA LEADER
Now, I know that many of us have already found partners in this fahine city, and I'd like to take a minute to hear some testimonials from members.
STAN
This is boring.
KYLE
Yeah. [yells] HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH?
MEMBER 1
Ho hohohoho
MEMBER 2
Woohoohoohoohoo. [others react similarly, lustily]
NAMBLA LEADER
[barely containing his glee] Ho, goodness! What a gift from God! Aha ha, we'll... "get" ...to it very soon, I assure you. But first, I'd just like to hear from a couple of you on your progress. Uh yes, Patrick.
PATRICK
Uh I, I found a little eight-year-old named Buttehers. He's a beautiful [Butters lights up], bright, little boy.
BUTTERS
Well, uh I sure am, I guess.
PATRICK
And his skin is as soft as fresh linen. [the other men savor the statement]
STAN
[to Kyle] That seems kind of... weird.
BUTTERS
Well, my skin is ssspringtime sssoft, I suppose.
NAMBLA LEADER
Wonderful, heh hn. And how about you, Mr. Harris?
MR. HARRIS
[with a stammer] Well, I want to announce that I may have found the dream boy of the decade. He's sexy, sassy, and full of spunk. His name is Timmy.
TIMMY
TIMMMIHH, tih, Timmih?
NAMBLA LEADER
Wuhell, members, I know we're all eager to get acquainted with our new partners and, so why don't we turn down the lights and start to dance! [the DJ starts the music again, and the boys and their partners take the dance floor. Stan and Kyle stay in their seats, as do Cartman and his partner.]
[South Park Elementary, 8:05 p.m., Cafeteria. The main doors are closed as the FBI shows up in force.]
LEAD AGENT
Alright, I want those perverted bastards all taken in. Got it?
AGENTS
Got it!
[South Park Elementary, 8:05 p.m., Cafeteria. Inside, Mephesto holds court on the podium in front of a NAMBLA banner, but this NAMBLA is different...]
MEPHESTO
[Kevin at his side] Hello, NAMBLA members. As the South Park representative- [the doors fly open and the FBI agents fill the room]
LEAD AGENT
[heading for Mephesto] Hold it right there!
AGENT 1
Freeze!
AGENT 2
Don't nobody move!
MEPHESTO
What's going on? [four rifles and a shotgun are pointed at him]
LEAD AGENT
Alright, sickos. Where are the children?! [the NAMBLA members look at each other confused]
MEPHESTO
What children?
LEAD AGENT
This... is... NAMBLA, right?
MEPHESTO
Yes.
LEAD AGENT
The North American Man/Boy Love Association?
MEPHESTO
[startled] What? No! [Points to the banner behind him] We're the North American Marlon Brando Look-Alikes. [a shot of the members is shown, and many of them do look like Marlon Brando]
BLOND AGENT
Aw, crap! We got the wrong NAMBLA.
MR. GARRISON
Aw, damnit, I'm in the wrong place. [gets up and walks out]
MEPHESTO
Don't tell me that that other NAMBLA is actually in South Park?!
LEAD AGENT
You know of them?
BLOND MEMBER
Know of them? We've been fighting with them for years over the rights to nambla.com!
BRUNET MEMBER
Yeah, those perverted bastards!
BLOND AGENT
Wow. You guys really do look a lot like Marlon Brando.
MEPHESTO
Thank you. Now, let's go get those other NAMBLA bastards before they hurt any of South Park's children!
MEMBERS
Yeah! Yeah!
BLACK MEMBER
And let's kick their asses for stealin' our domain name!
MEMBERS
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
[South Park Inn, evening. NAMBLA members and their boys are still dancing. The NAMBLA leader steps up to the podium]
NAMBLA LEADER
[Cartman stands next to him] Alright, members, that's enough of that. [the music is stopped] It's time for all of us to retire to our respective rooms, and get to know our new young boys. [NAMBLA members rub their hands react lustily]
MEMBER 3
All right.
MEMBER 4
Alright.
KYLE
Dude. Being mature is boring!
STAN
Yeah.
NAMBLA LEADER
Everyone come up and grab your room keys and we'll head upstairs, hm hm.
[South Park Inn, upstairs. French music begins to play, and the men and boys appear at the top of the stairs and go to their respective rooms. After a few moments...]
THE BOYS
Aaaaah! [all pour out into the hallway]
STAN
Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us!
KYLE
I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here! [music resumes. All the boys turn and head for the stairs, only to see shadows moving up the wall, and they stop in their tracks]
STAN
Aah! There's more of them! Quick, hide! [the boys run into room 1A. Mephesto shows up and leads the other look-alikes onto the hallway]
MEPHESTO
Alright, Marlon Brandos, they've got to be here somewhere. Let's try this room. [they enter 2E. The FBI then arrives amid much commotion]
LEAD AGENT
Let's get those perverts! [the agents fan out and enter all rooms except 1A and 2E. A waiter heads for the stairs with a tray, but naked NAMBLA members pour out of their rooms and startle him. The tray flies off his hand]
WAITER
Sacrebleu! [picks up the tray and heads back to the room he left. The NAMBLA members go into 1A]
THE BOYS
Whoa! [pour out of 1A and head down the hall to 2E. The door there opens and the Marlon Brandos peek out]
THE BOYS AND THE BRANDOS
Aaah! [the boys run to 1E, the Brandos go back into 2E, and the doors to both are shut]
CAROL
[enters the hallway from the stairs] Kenny, no! Leave me alone [heads into 1C]
KENNY
(Come here, mom! Let me get it!) [follows her in. The agents pour out of the rooms and switch places, again avoiding 1A and 2E. Stuart arrives and looks around]
STUART
Kenny?? [enters 2C. The waiter again heads for the stairs with the tray]
WAITER
Zis time, I will not drop zeh food. [makes it to the top of the stairs, but drops the tray when the NAMBLA members exit 1A] Allo!
NAMBLA LEADER
It's clear. The cops are gone. Where's the boys?! [the NAMBLA members enter 2A]
WAITER
[picks up the tray and goes back down the hall, angrily] Sacre bleu! [the door to 2E opens and the Marlon Brandos step out]
MEPHESTO
I think the boys went in here. [the Brandos enter 1E]
THE BOYS
[all exit 1E] Aaaaaah!
TIMMY
Timmih! [all enter 2D. A poodle on a ball exits 1C and enters 2D. The NAMBLA members exit 2A and head for 1C]
NAMBLA LEADER
Maybe the boys are in here. Oh bo-oys? [the NAMBLA members enter 1C. Kenny's mom and Kenny exit 1C]
CAROL
Kenny, GIVE IT UP!
KENNY
(Come on!) [both enter 2C. The waiter heads for the stairs again with the tray, but Marlon Brandos and FBI agents pour out of 1E]
WAITER
[falls backwards] Waaah!
LEAD AGENT
Alright, you're under arrest!
MEPHESTO
No! You've got the wrong NAMBLA again!
LEAD AGENT
Damnit!
AGENT
Hey, we didn't try that room! [Brandos and agents head for 2A and enter. Two guys in vintage bikes ride across from 2D to 1D]
WAITER
[exasperated, gets up with the tray] Sacre bleu. [walks away, having given up on the stairs]
[South Park Inn, a room. The boys are safe, but tired]
KYLE
[panting] Dude! We're surrounded by perverts.
CARTMAN
They're all over the place.
TIMMY
Timmiihhh!
TOLKIEN
[Tolkien joins the group] What are we gonna do?!
STAN
Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out.
THE BOYS
Yeah.
CARTMAN
Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out.
KYLE
How?
CARTMAN
Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and... take one for the team. [the other boys are shocked at the thought] And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters. [presents him]
BUTTERS
Huh?? Uh-uh well, huh, why me?
CARTMAN
Now, are you a team player or not?!
BUTTERS
Well, sure, u-uh I'm a team player-uh, I guess.
CARTMAN
Well, Butters, there is no I in "team."
BUTTERS
Huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? Well just what team is this anyway?!
CARTMAN
Just go, Butters. We're running out of time.
BUTTERS
Well uuh-uuh-alright then. [heads for the door. Stan sees him out and Cartman closes the door]
CARTMAN
Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass.
[South Park Inn, hallway. Butters is there all alone]
BUTTERS
Well, alright men. Here, here I come. [puts his hands over his eyes and moves across the hall] I'm ready to take one for the team. [enters 1D.]
STUART
[exits 2D] Kenny?! Kenny, I've had enough of your shenanigans! [enters 1E]
NAMBLA LEADER
[inside 1E] Oh, one of the boys just came in. [the members surround him and begin their activity...]
STUART
What the-? No, wait, no, WAH, NO, WAAAAAH! [Butters steps out of 1D, listens in at the door to 1E, turns around and walks away.]
[South Park Inn, outside. The inn has been cleared, so everyone stands outside. An ambulance awaits a victim, who is soon on a stretcher]
CAROL
[voice shaking, approaches] Are you alright, Stuart?
STUART
[sobbing] Don't touch me! I've had my nuts broken, body poisoned, have been made love to in the ass by three dozen 40-year-old men—I just wanna go home and take a, a hot bath! [the NAMBLA members are in cuffs]
LEAD AGENT
[to NAMBLA Leader] We've been after you for a long time, buddy! Do you know your rights?
NAMBLA LEADER
Rights? Does anybody know their rights? You see, I've learned something today. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] Our forefathers came to this country because... they believed in an idea. An idea called "freedom." They wanted to live in a place where a group couldn't be prosecuted for their beliefs. Where a person can live the way he chooses to live. [Stan, Kyle, and Cartman look at each other] You see us as being perverted because we're different from you. People are afraid of us, because they don't understand. And sometimes it's easier to persecute than to understand. [Stan and Kyle look at each other, then at the NAMBLA leader]
KYLE
Dude. You have sex with children.
NAMBLA LEADER
We are human. Most of us didn't even choose to be attracted to young boys. We were born that way. We can't help the way we are, and if you all can't understand that, well, then, I guess you'll just have to put us away. [shots of the agents, then the Brando look-alikes, then Stan and Kyle, who look at each other, then at the NAMBLA leader]
KYLE
[slowly, for emphasis] Dude. You have sex with children.
STAN
Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you.
KYLE
Seriously.
LEAD AGENT
Alright, that's enough. You're all going to be put away for a long time. [The agents escort the NAMBLA members away. The members groan. The boys gather around Stan, Kyle, and Cartman]
KYLE
Well, Cartman?
CARTMAN
Well, what?
KYLE
Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?
THE BOYS
Yeah!
CARTMAN
Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There.
STAN
And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?
CARTMAN
No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long. [the paramedics finish putting Stuart into the ambulance and head for the cab]
PARAMEDIC
Okay, let's roll. [the siren goes on. The ambulance goes into reverse and crushes Kenny under its rear wheels, then speeds off]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, Delivery Room. Carol has a new baby in her arms, and Stuart looks at it with her]
NURSE
[voice-over] Dr. Flores, dial 18-
STUART
Coo, cootchy-coo, coohoohoohoo, cootchy-coo.
CAROL
Our little angel, yes.
STUART
Oh, he's so beautiful. I know it's been hard on both of us losing poor Kenny. But this new baby kind of reminds me of him. [a shot of the baby reveals a boy in a little orange parka with the hood tight on his face, like Kenny before him]
CAROL
What should we name him?
STUART
Well, seeing as though Kenny passed away, maybe we should name him ah,... Kenny.
CAROL
Yes. Kenny's such a great name. My little Kenny, a brand-new Kenny. (The new Kenny then mumbles)
STUART
God, this must be the fiftieth time this has happened.
CAROL
Fifty-second.

[South Park Elementary, day. Mr. Garrison's classroom. But this day, a substitute teacher enters with a bag of stuff and makes an announcement.]
MR. WYLAND
Good morning, children. Mr. Garrison is away today. I am your substitute teacher, Mr. Wyland. [writes it on the chalkboard. A shot of the class reveals Kyle missing]
CARTMAN
[in a low voice] Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher.
MR. WYLAND
Now, I understand that some students in this class like to mess with substitute teachers. [Cartman points at Craig] But if we all behave and respect each other, I'm sure we can make this a fun and productive day. Let's start with roll call. Let's see, mmmmm. [runs his finger down the list] Eric Cartman?
STAN
[raises his hand] Here! [he, Kenny, and Cartman laugh heartily]
MR. WYLAND
Alright, and how about Stan Marsh?
KENNY
[raises his hand] (Here.) [he, Stan, and Cartman laugh heartily]
WENDY
It's not that funny, you guys. Jesus.
MR. WYLAND
Okay, and where iiiiss… Kenny McCormick?
CARTMAN
[raises his hand] Here. [he, Stan, and Kenny laugh heartily. A few seconds later his nose bleeds a white liquid all over his desk] Oh, hoho. Ow.
STAN
Dude, what the hell was that?
CARTMAN
Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!
STAN
...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk.
CARTMAN
Huh?
STAN
You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.
CARTMAN
Not with me, man.
MR. WYLAND
Alright. Look, why don't we skip roll call? Here's what we're gonna do today. [reaches into the bag and pulls out some glue and glitter] I've been told that one of your classmates has been ill for several days — Kyle Broflovski?
STAN
[drawn out] He's fakin'!
MR. WYLAND
Well, I've been told that in Mr. Garrison's absence, our activity for the day is to make a get-well card for Kyle. So I got this large piece of poster board, and we're all gonna come up and use glitter.and glue to decorate it.
THE CLASS
Awww. [the kids leave their seats and head for the front of the class. Cartman remains in his seat]
CARTMAN
[drawn out] He's fakin'! [the other kids get busy decorating the card]
MR. WYLAND
Kenny, you come and decorate the get-well card, too.
CARTMAN
But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle.
MR. WYLAND
I don't care! Get down here and do it!
BUTTERS
Hey, watch it! [Mr. Wyland looks down at the group] Hey, what are you doin'? [the kids back away to reveal Butters decorated, not the poster board. A sign hangs on him saying "Get Well Kyle"]
STAN
Now, that's a get-well card! [the others laugh. Cartman soon joins them, but his nose begins to leak that white liquid again. He covers his nostrils and continues laughing]
[Denver, day. The Denver School Administration building is shown. Inside, the South Park School Board is meeting. Principal Victoria is present among the three people seated around a horseshoe-shaped table.]
CHAIRMAN
Mr. Garrison, after very careful review the school board believes that you should take a... hiatus from teaching. Indefinitely.
MR. GARRISON
What??
BOARD MEMBER
Frankly, your conduct has been somewhat disconcerting. [a look of disbelief comes across Mr. Garrison's face]
CHAIRMAN
Did you know that not one of your students knew who Sam Adams was?
MR. GARRISON
Well, who cares about a guy that makes beer?! Jesus Christ, I'm trying to teach history!
CHAIRMAN
...Frankly, Mr. Garrison, it isn't even your educational record that we're most concerned about. [reviews a sheet of paper] It's your somewhat substantial police record.
MR. GARRISON
[stomps his foot down] Oh, whatever!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Mr. Garrison, last week's charges of attempting to solicit sex from a minor wa-
MR. GARRISON
That was not me, that was Mr. Hat! [points to his puppet]
BOARD MEMBER
All we're saying is, perhaps you should take a little hiatus from teaching until this little [does quotes with two fingers on each hand] "child molestation" thing dies down a bit.
MR. GARRISON
[rises from his chair] Gentlemen, teaching is all I know. It is the air that I breathe.
CHAIRMAN
We're sorry, Mr. Garrison, we have no choice.
MR. GARRISON
[crestfallen] Very well. I guess... I'm not a teacher anymore. [approaches the chairman] I suppose you'll be wanting my badge and gun... [pulls them out and sets them on the table]
CHAIRMAN
Mr. Garrison, most teachers do not carry a gun!
MR. GARRISON
Oh, sorry. So I can keep it then? [grabs back his revolver]
[Kyle's house, day, Kyle's room. He's in bed delirious and mumbling. His door opens and in walks Sheila with Sharon and Stan.]
SHEILA
Kyle, Stan and his mother came over to visit you.
SHARON
Hello, sweetie. [Stan walks over to Kyle's bed]
STAN
Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher. [Kyle mumbles once more] Kyle?
SHEILA
They say it's his kidneys. Kyle always has been a diabetic and lately his kidneys have just been shutting down.
SHARON
Well, the kids at school made you a card, Kyle. Look. [Butters walks into the room still decorated from head to toe in glitter and glue, and he carries the sign in his right hand]
STAN
Go on, Butters!
BUTTERS
Ho, I don't wanna!
STAN
Butters, go on!
BUTTERS
Oh, uhuh alright, then. [starts to sing]
We're so sorry you're not feeling well
We hope you're better soon.
So we're bringing you some sunshine
By, um, singing you this tune:
[brings out a cane and dances]
Everybody misses you
And though we hate to cause a fuss
We'd like to say, "Get well soon!"
And "Please don't die on us."
[pulls a rip cord and a bunch of balloons inflate automatically around him. Kyle babbles some more]
STAN
Dude, you really are sick, huh?
KYLE
I don't know, I...
SHEILA
I don't know what to do, Sharon. They wanna have him go into surgery, but they're so dangerous.
SHARON
Sheila, have you tried holistic natural medicines? They work wonders. I read all about in People.
SHEILA
Really? In People?
SHARON
There's a brand-new shop in town that sells holistic medicines and all-natural foods. It's run by this fascinating woman named "Miss Information."
SHEILA
Oh, well, with a name like "Miss Information" she must know something.
SHARON
Why don't we at least take Kyle down there and see what she has to say.
SHEILA
Okay. I'll get our coats. [turns and walks out the door. Kyle babbles some more]
BUTTERS
Can I go now?
[South Park Elementary, Mr. Mackey's office. Craig waits outside on a bench.]
MR. GARRISON
[lying down on a couch] I don't know what I'm goin' tuh do, Mackey. Teaching is all I know.
MR. MACKEY
[in a armchair] Okay, well, maybe you need to view this as a chance to do something you've always wanted to do.
MR. GARRISON
I've always wanted to write a novel.
MR. MACKEY
Well, there you go, m'kay?
MR. GARRISON
But I never know what to write about.
MR. MACKEY
Well that's easy. Write about what you know. Write about what you love. What do you love most?
MR. GARRISON
Besides teaching?
MR. MACKEY
Yes.
MR. GARRISON
...Poontang.
MR. MACKEY
M, m'kay
MR. GARRISON
I can't help it. I'm a womanizer sometimes, I know, but I just think that... taking a woman home and getting some hot poon is about the greatest thing in the world.
MR. MACKEY
Well that settles it, Mr. Garrison. What you need to do is go write a great romance novel.
MR. GARRISON
Yes, that's it. [sits up brightly] I am going to write the Great American Romance Novel!
[Miss Information's New Age Shop. The sign is framed by two antlers and its entrance is a curtain of beads. In the picture window you see a pyramid with an eye on one side, a crystal ball and stand, a little elephant, and some charms. Outside, under the window, is a bed of flowers. Inside, Miss Information talks to Stan, Kyle, and their moms. Kyle looks fatigued]
MISS INFORMATION
You see, the reason our body is stale is because of toxins.
SHEILA
Toxins?
MISS INFORMATION
All the horrible food we eat—the sodas and meats are filled with toxins, and the only way for us to get better is to flush those toxins out of our system. Western medicine is so quick to cut and carve up, but all your son needs is a toxin-flushing diet of lemon juice and cayenne pepper.
SHARON
Wow, that's amazing, Miss Information!
SHEILA
You hear that, Kyle? You don't need surgery after all. [Kyle coughs]
STAN
Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?
MISS INFORMATION
What?
STAN
Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?
SHARON
Don't be a smartass, Stanley.
MISS INFORMATION
Mrs. Broflovski, I would like to give your son herbs that focus on the kidney. I have these excellent herbs from local Native Americans.
SHARON
Ooo, Native Americans. Now, they know how to heal the body spiritually. [Kyle begins to babble]
[Mr. Garrison's house, night. A second-story window casts a shadow of Mr. Garrison at his laptop computer. He types and we hear the words as he says them in his mind...]
MR. GARRISON
Out on the balcony, when Reginald kissed Diana's lips, her knees went weak. Slowly, he pulled her top down, exposing her soft, unyielding breasts Oh yeah, now this is getting good [sips some wine] Just the sight of those breasts made Reginald's penis very hard. [taps his chin with his left index finger. The computer screen is shown as the words are typed] His penis was of considerable size, and now beads of sweat slowly ran down his [pauses] penis, making it glisten like a strong swimmer fresh from out of the pool. It was a fantastic penis, that seemed as strong as a horse's leg, yet as delicate as a flower wrapped in silk. What a grand, grand penis. Diana's nipples [music cuts off. He thinks] Uh, let's see... [taps his chin with his right index finger] Diana's nipples...[The words on the screen are shown halted at 'nipples'] [aloud] Oh, writer's block, writer's block! Hmmm. Crap! I'm stuck. [turns his body to one side] Oh well, maybe that's enough writing for today, Mr. Hat.
[Kyle's house, morning. At Kyle's bedside, Sharon, Sheila, and Liane talk to each other while Stan keeps vigil. Three other mothers are there]
MRS. TWEAK
Oh my, he looks terrible.
BLONDE MOTHER
Yes, poor little dear.
MISS INFORMATION
[arrives] Good morning, everyone.
BLONDE MOTHER
[walks up to her and brings her in] Oh, thanks for coming, Miss. Information. Kyle seems to be getting worse. [Miss Information walks to Kyle's bed as Stan watches. She raises her arms and waves them over Kyle's body]
MISS INFORMATION
Huuuuuuuuuh [lowers her arms] Oh, I don't agree. He seems much better.
SHEILA
Really?
STAN
What?
MISS INFORMATION
Yes, his chi is flowing much nicer than yesterday, and his aura is lighter.
SHARON
Oh, that's great news! [Kyle barfs and Stan steps out of the way]
SHEILA
Oh no!
MISS INFORMATION
Nono, that's good. Those are the toxins flushing out of the system.
SHARON
Ooooo.
STAN
Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.
SHARON
Stanley, what did I say about being a smartass?!
STAN
Don't be a smartass?
MISS INFORMATION
Now, don't be fooled. As Kyle's body sheds itself more and more of all the toxins he will appear to be getting worse, but actually, he is getting better!
SHEILA
Wow. Well, I am on natural medicines. If only I had known sooner.
OTHER MOTHERS
[ad lib] I agree. Yeah. That's right. [Stan looks defeated]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Dr. Doctor is in his office filling out a form]
NURSE
[over an intercom] Mr. Marsh is here to see you.
DR. DOCTOR
Alright, send him in. [from his desk, golf balls, a cup, and a set of golf clubs can be seen. Stan enters] Oh, Stanley.
STAN
Hi, doctor. [takes a seat]
DR. DOCTOR
How can I help you?
STAN
Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick.
DR. DOCTOR
He is really, really sick, Stanley. I was seeing him last week when he first got ill, but unfortunately his mother has decided to put all her trust into holistic medicine.
STAN
But I don't think it's working.
DR. DOCTOR
Alright, Stanley, I'm going to be very honest with you. Your little friend Kyle needs a kidney transplant. Or it is very possible that... he will die.
STAN
[overwhelmed] Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.
DR. DOCTOR
I know this is a lot to lay on someone your age, but... the rest of the town is so gung-ho in New Age medicine that I have nowhere else to turn.
STAN
...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care.
DR. DOCTOR
That's very brave, Stan, but I've already checked my records, and you and Kyle aren't a match for kidneys. In fact, [looks at a sheet of paper] there's only one person in South Park with the same blood type as Kyle.
STAN
Who? [Dr. Doctor turns the sheet around, and Cartman's picture is on it. A close-up reveals that Cartman has AB-negative blood] Oh, shit.
[Cartman's house, day. Cartman and Kenny are playing at dogfights in the air, and Kenny makes sound effects while maneuvering a yellow ship]
KENNY
(Rrrrooowwwrrr, rroowwrr, pew, pew, POW.) [crashes the ship into a soldier]
CARTMAN
"Coming in for attack, Captain." Pipew, pipipew [grabs for the yellow ship] Give me the space cruiser, Kenny.
KENNY
(No, no.)
CARTMAN
Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser [pulls the cruiser his way] so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5.
KENNY
[gets up as Cartman speaks] (Unngh. Stop, no! No, it's mine!) [pulls the cruiser back] (There! It's mine!) [the doorbell rings and the two boys tug at the ship in opposite directions]
CARTMAN
No, mine. M'yah! [the ship breaks in two, with Kenny getting the short end] Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha ha ha [his nose spurts out white fluid again] bluh oh, ha-ow! [blocks his nostrils]
LIANE
[walks up] Ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard again?
CARTMAN
Yeah.
LIANE
Well, some more of your little friends are here to play with you. [Stan enters with a sick Kyle in his arms]
CARTMAN
Okay, mom.
LIANE
[genuflects and speaks softly to Cartman] And don't get too close to Kyle. He looks like he might have the AIDS. [Stan leaves Kyle and walks up to Cartman]
CARTMAN
What's goin' on, guys?
STAN
Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question.
CARTMAN
Oh-kay.
STAN
Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life.
CARTMAN
Uh huh.
STAN
What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.
CARTMAN
Oh, I think I see where this is going. [Kyle moans]
STAN
His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but it's obviously not working.
CARTMAN
Stan, why don't you just ask the question?
STAN
Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?
CARTMAN
[sings and dances]
No no, no no, no!
No no, no no, no!
STAN
But you only need one, fat boy!
CARTMAN
'No no, no no, nono no!
Nonono, no no!
STAN
Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!
KENNY
[miffed] (It's not that's fucking serious.) [Kyle coughs twice]
CARTMAN
Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price.
STAN
Oh my God!
KYLE
How much?
CARTMAN
I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle?
STAN
Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!
CARTMAN
Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars.
KENNY
(Ten million dollars??)
STAN
What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!
CARTMAN
What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
STAN
Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here. [they walk away]
CARTMAN
Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah. [they return to the floor to continue play] "Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire." Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah!
[Miss Information's shop, next day. A line of folks wait to enter the shop while a few shoppers exit with their purchases. Inside, the shop is busy.]
MAN 1
Oooh, free-range aspirin!
MAN 2
All-natural cell phones! [Two stoners, who appear to be Richard 'Cheech' Marin and Tommy Chong, appear at the door with boxes of stuff]
MISS INFORMATION
Oh, look everyone. These are our two resident Native Americans. Chief Running Pinto, and Carlos Ramirez. [shoppers gather around the men]
MAN 3
[amid the chatter] Ooo.
MAN 4
I'd like to buy some more stuff.
MAN 5
Come in. Come here, guys.
MAN 6
Do you have any new holistic items for sale?
CARLOS RAMIREZ
Oohh, oh yeah. Aah... [holds up a decorated clothes hanger] Here, uh, this is a- uhh, dream...catcher.
WOMAN 1
Oh, a dreamcatcher. I'll buy one. [other women start ordering them]
CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
[holds up an item] Yeah. And these here are Cherokee hair tampons. They're, like, tampons made with all-natural hair from the Cherokee people.
SHARON
Ooh, a tampon made from Cherokee hair—now that sounds natural.
MISS INFORMATION
Native Americans are more in tune with the earth than we are.
CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
Oh yeah. We love the earth, man.
CARLOS RAMIREZ
Oh yeah, the earth is great.
MISS INFORMATION
[walks up to Sheila] Mrs. Broflovski's son is a little sick. Perhaps she could bring him in tomorrow and you could give him some spiritual healing.
CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
Oh, sure. We could do that, man. We'll give him, like, a, a brain enema, or somethin'.
CARLOS RAMIREZ
[laughs] uh'hm, ho ho hm.
SHEILA
Wonderful!
MISS INFORMATION
[takes Sheila along] Why don't you follow me over to the cash register and I'll take a deposit. [the other shoppers crowd the two men]
MAN 7
D'you have anymore stuff to sell? We wanna buy more stuff.
MAN 8
Yes. Much, much more stuff.
CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
Sure, uh, we just gotta go back to our truck- I'm, I mean our horses and grab some more junk. [Ramirez starts to laugh] Come on. [turns to leave]
MISS INFORMATION
Good-bye, Native Americans. The spirit of Maya is with you.
CARLOS RAMIREZ
Oh yah. You too and junk. [they head out the door and away]
CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
[off-screen] That's funny, man. [Stan walks in]
SHARON
Oh hi, Stanley. Look, I'm buying you some more all-natural toothpaste.
STAN
You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?
SHARON
That's right.
STAN
Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't.
MISS INFORMATION
Well, of course the doctor told you that, because he wants to make money. Holistic medicine is about NATURE. [to Sheila] Two-hundred and thirty-three dollars. [Sheila pays, and Miss Information rings it up]
SHEILA
Everything's going to be fine, Stan. We're bringing Kyle in tomorrow to see the Native Americans personally.
STAN
Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about?
SHARON
You watch your mouth, Stanley! The Native Americans were raped of their land and resources by white people like us!
STAN
And that has something to do with their medicines because...?
SHARON
Enough, Stanley!
[Miss Information's shop, curbside. Kenny is sitting there. Stan exits the store, walks over to him, and sits down next to him. Somber music plays]
STAN
Nobody wants to listen, Kenny.
KENNY
(I know.)
STAN
I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again.
KENNY
(Uh huh.)
STAN
I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do. [Kenny gets mad, Stan gets resolute] Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live! [walks away]
KENNY
(Rrrh!)
[Mr. Garrison's house, night. He's back at his laptop. He's typing with only his left hand now, while Mr. Hat sits on his right hand]
MR. GARRISON
[We hear Mr Garrison's thoughts]
Chapter 18. Diana had never slept with another woman before, but it was an erotic thought she often fantasized about. [out loud]Oh yeah, Mr. Hat. Hot lesbo scene comin' up! And as Rebecca's naked body lay before her, Diana couldn't help but feel aroused. [Words on the computer screen are seen typed] "Go on", Rebecca said softly, "Touch me." Diana leaned down slowly and brushed Rebecca's bare stomach with her fingertips... It felt good. Like a penis. A soft, but sturdy penis that felt warn to the touch. In Rebecca's mind, she suddenly felt like she was surrounded by penises. They were all around her, flopping all around and slapping her face. It was as if she were in a redwood forest of penises. [unconsciously, his right hand (Mr Hat hand) lowers down towards his crotch and is soon out of view, but the arm moves around some...] They presented themselves tall and mighty all around her, with... [catches himself masturbating] Mr. Hat, what the hell are you doing?! [looks around to see that no one is watching, then happily] Oh, Mr. Hat!
[Bus stop, night. Stan waits with a book under his arm.]
STAN
[checks his watch] Come on, where are they? [looks around. Three boys approach from his left: Kenny, Butters, and Timmy]
STAN
This is it??
KENNY
(Uh huh)
TIMMY
Timmiiihh!
STAN
This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??
BUTTERS
Well, Clyde was gonna come too, but he, he said his mom was makin' tacos for dinner and Clyde likes tacos a whole lot.
STAN
[quite disappointed] Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!
BUTTERS
Huh, where are we goin'?
STAN
We're gon' tuh take Cartman's kidney. [the others look are shocked]
[Switch to live action. Daytime in a middle class American backyard. A dyed sandy haired, middle-aged, white woman speaks with her sandy haired daughter while seated on the patio lounge.]
MOTHER
[Smiling, empty-headed into the distance]
DAUGHTER
[hesitantly] Mom... Do you ever have those heavy flow days?
MOTHER
[Places her hand comfortingly on her daughter's thigh] Oh absolutely sweetheart, everybody does.
DAUGHTER
[Camera zooms in on her face] Mom, remember the movie The Shining where the elevator doors are opening up..
MOTHER
[Camera switches to close-up on mother's face] Oh honey what you need is a more absorbent tampon. [grabs her daughter's hand and shakes hands in emphasis]
DAUGHTER
[Camera zooms back out] Like what?
MOTHER
Well, what's the most absorbent thing in the world?
DAUGHTER
[Looks down, plays with her hair and mulls it over] Well... Cherokee hair I guess. [Camera zooms back on her face] But what does that have to do with me?
MOTHER
[Camera zooms out and mother grabs a box]
Because now there is all new, natural [Camera zooms in on mother who fakes a broad smile and holds a purple box of 'All Natural Cherokee Hair Tampons' with a Native woman that looks like the Land O' Lakes butter symbol] Cherokee hair tampons. [Broadens her fake smile].
[Live action continues. Petri dish, on a table, with tampon is shown in front of tampon box while a light brown hand pours dyed blue water over the tampon. The tampon swells quickly.]
FEMALE ANNOUNCER
[Speaking like an authority]
A cotton tampon can hold only so much liquid. [Scene slides over to another petri dish with tampon in front of box where the hand pours blue liquid on that tampon that swells more slowly] Other tampons also come up short. [Scene slides right again to a Cherokee woman laying on the table with her hair spread flat along the table] But Cherokee hair has been known for ages to be strong and powerful [The hand pours dyed blue water along the Cherokee woman's splayed hair, which doesn't absorb any of it, while the woman looks up at her hair] Each tampon is hand woven [A white woman's manicured hand holds up a hair 'tampon' bundle up with cross-hatched orange yarn, bead wrapped center and a white pull string for extraction] from over 200 strands of Cherokee hair and then bound together with these decorative native beads.
[Live action continues. Front yard of suburban home. Daughter runs up to mother who is trimming the roses.]
DAUGHTER
You were right mom! All natural Cherokee hair tampons really did the trick. [Mother smiles back fakely and continues working]
MOTHER
And when you're done using them [She holds up Cherokee tampon] they make a great toy for Jessie. [Mother and daughter smile broad, fake smiles] Go get it boy! [Mother tosses Cherokee tampon off camera]
JESSIE
[Tampon flies into the grass where Jessie, the white terrier grabs it and shakes it] Grrr... grrrr
CHIEF RUNNING PINTO (TOMMY CHONG IN HIS STONER VOICE)
[Camera shows mother and daughter smiling huge, fake smiles with their arms about each other peering into each other's face with the text 'Cherokee Hair Tampons' on the screen below. Mother mouths 'I love you'] Let the wonders and the mysteries of our people, like, change the way you think about tampons.
[Cartman's house, night. Cartman is asleep in his bed... tossing and turning]
CARTMAN
No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!
[Cartman's house, outside. Stan and the others approach, and Stan looks in the lower window. Stan now has a hand saw on his right hand]
STAN
[softly] Okay, it's clear. [slowly opens the front door] Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy.
TIMMY
Timmiihh!
STAN
Sshhh!
TIMMY
[whispering] Timmiihh.
STAN
If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?
KENNY
(Okay)
TIMMY
[softly] Timmiihh.
STAN
Alright Butters, let's go. [they walk away and up the stairs, then down the hall, but Stan stops in his tracks] Uh-oh, Cartman's pig. [Fluffy is seen sleeping in her own little bed. Stan and Butters try to sneak past, but she opens her eyes] Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay. [Butters accidentally steps on Fluffy's tail and she squeals in panic. This wakes Cartman, who blinks and heads for his door half-asleep] Come on, we gotta get outta here! [runs a bit, then has his back to the wall as Cartman opens the door and walks out] Oh, no!
BUTTERS
Oh well, we're busted. [Cartman continues towards Fluffy, Ignoring the boys]
CARTMAN
[smacks her] Shut up, Fluffy! [she quiets down and Cartman goes back to sleep, closing his door.]
STAN
Oh, phew.
[Cartman's house, later. Cartman's nightmare returns]
CARTMAN
Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp! [Stan rises from the other side of the bed with the medical book, and Butters rises, too]
STAN
Okay, here we go. [opens the book and leafs through. Pictures of the heart, fingers, liver, and cutaway of the male genitalia are shown. Stan giggles softly and turns the page to a picture of the kidney] Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here...
BUTTERS
I hope it's not too bloody; I'm wearin' my favorite pants.
STAN
...vein right, well- [brings out the saw] Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up. [Butters pulls the sheets, Stan the shirt, and something more is in their way] No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!
CARTMAN
[rises quickly] whatwhatwhatwhat? [sees Stan and Butters] Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?!
STAN
You suck, Cartman!
CARTMAN
[faces them] Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000!
STAN
God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!
CARTMAN
I do! I do care! Look how much. [a blank expression is on his face] Look. Look how much I care. [the expressionless face persists]
[Harequin Romance Book Publishing CO. Mr. Garrison has finished his novel and is now inside talking to a publisher]
PUBLISHER
First and foremost, Mr. Garrison, I would like to thank you for choosing Harequin Romance.
MR. GARRISON
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, did you read the book?
PUBLISHER
Uh yes, Mr. Garrison, we did read your book. [taps on it a few times]
MR. GARRISON
Well, what did you think?
PUBLISHER
Well, uh, frankly, Mr. Garrison, n-we don't know if the Harequin Romance label is appropriate for you.
MR. GARRISON
Ooohhh, why not?
PUBLISHER
Mr. Garrison, uh... are you aware that the word "penis" occurs six-thousand and eighty-three times in your novel?
MR. GARRISON
Well, I'm sure there's lots of naughty words. It is a romance novel.
PUBLISHER
Nnnno, I don't think that this book really qualifies as a "romance novel."
MR. GARRISON
No?
PUBLISHER
[clears his throat] No. No, this is what we in the book-publishing business like to call... gay. Really, really gay.
MR. GARRISON
What the hell are you talkin' about?!
PUBLISHER
It's just that the focus really seems to be on the... male organs.
MR. GARRISON
Well, I thought it was mostly women that read these things!
PUBLISHER
It is.
MR. GARRISON
Well, women want to read about ding-dongs! D'you think women care about the details of female anatomy?! Hell no! Women wanna read about big, powerful schlongs! [the publisher has no answer] Look, I've seen women read these things. They skim along and skim along until they get to the part about the penis! That's what they want, so that's what I'm giving them!
PUBLISHER
[taps his chin] Hmmm.
[South Park, next day. Stan and Kenny sit on the curb in front of "South Park Pianos"]
STAN
[despondent, voice cracking] There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!
KENNY
(You never seem to care when I die!)
STAN
[sobs] My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it. [begins to break down] Oh, God, he's my best friend... [weeps]
KENNY
[stands up] (Well now, that does it! I have had enough of this bullshit! Screw you, Stan. I'm going home!) [walks away. Above him, a man is hauling a piano, but realizes the ropes are tearing]
MOVER
Look out! [the piano snaps from the ropes and crushes Kenny] Oops.
STAN
Awgh! I'll never see Kyle again! [weeps]
[South Park, Miss Information's shop, day. More people line up to buy holistic stuff. Inside, Carlos Ramirez and Chief Running Pinto field orders.]
MRS.TUCKER
Four dozen Cherokee hair tampons, please.
CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
[hands them to her] No problem, man. Pay Miss Information up front. [she walks away with the tampons and Carlos glances at her ass]
MAN 7
Hi, uh, I have a little bit of pain in my balls whenever I watch VH1.
CARLOS RAMIREZ
Oh, here, try this, man. Ah, this is allll-naturalll ball juice. [the man takes it and drinks. Carlos and Chief Pinto chortle]
MAN 7
Wow, I feel better already! [walks away. Carlos and Chief Pinto laugh some more.]
MISS INFORMATION
[joining the two men] And next we have Mrs. Broflovski's son. [Sheila drags Kyle in by his jacket collar]
SHEILA
[let's him drop to the floor] Okay, here he is.
CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
Ahahem, that kid looks really sick.
MISS INFORMATION
Yes. He really needs his toxins flushed again.
CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
No. I mean, he looks REALLY sick, man. You should take him to, like, a doctor.
CUSTOMERS
[look at each other] Hmm?
SHEILA
But you're more in touch with the earth.
CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
Look, bein' in touch with the earth has nothing to do with dyin', man.
SHARON
It's okay. We trust that you know what you're doing. [Carlos and Chief Pinto look at each other. Kyle groans]
CARLOS RAMIREZ
No, man, that kid needs a doctor! And besides, we're not actually Native Americans. I mean, I'm- I'm more like a- a Mexican.
CUSTOMERS
What?!
MAN
Hu-uh?!
CARLOS RAMIREZ
Yeah. A Mexican.
MAN 7
Uugh. [spits out the ball juice] Ptu, ptu.
MAN 8
I didn't know that.
GERALD
Oh my God! [Mrs.Tucker, who had purchased the 48 tampons screams in horror and covers her crotch area]
SHARON
How dare you deceive us like that!
CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
Hey, we never said we were Native Americans, man. Miss Information said that.
CARLOS RAMIREZ
Yeah. She said nobody would buy anything from Mexicans. [the customers blink in anger, then gather around Miss Information]
MISS INFORMATION
Uh, toxins are your enemy. [the customers enclose her]
WOMAN 1
Kill her! [the pummeling begins. Carlos and Chief Pinto just laugh at the sight]
CARLOS RAMIREZ
Funny.
[South Park, Miss Information's shop, later. Stan, Sheila, and Kyle are still there]
STAN
So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?
SHEILA
Yes, of course, but we don't have a kidney donor!
STAN
That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan.
[Cartman's house, morning. A cock crows, and Cartman's radio sounds the alarm. Cartman rises on his bed and stretches]
CARTMAN
Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA! [jumps back. His Kidney Blocker 2000 lies at the foot of his bed over streaks of blood] That son of a bitch!
[Stan's house, moments later. Cartman approaches and pounds on the door. Stan quickly opens it.]
CARTMAN
[fuming] Okay, asshole! Give me back my kidney!
STAN
Dude, please. Kyle needs it.
CARTMAN
It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there's gonna be HELL to pay!
STAN
Alright, alright, here. [hands him a bloody kidney. Cartman reviews it.]
CARTMAN
Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before.
[Hell's Pass Hospital, sometime later. Dr. Doctor is in his office.]
NURSE
[over an intercom] Doctor, Eric Cartman is here- [Cartman enters unbid before she finishes speaking]
DR. DOCTOR
Why, hello there, Eric. [Cartman stands on the chair and slaps the kidney down on the desk. The doctor looks on]
CARTMAN
You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in! [sits] Please.
DR. DOCTOR
Oh, I see. [holds the kidney up] Are you sure that now that it's already out, you don't wanna just let your friend Kyle have it?
CARTMAN
No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!
DR. DOCTOR
Well, alright then. We'll get you prepped for surgery. [puts the kidney down and holds up a clipboard] If you'll just sign this release. [sets it in front of Cartman]
CARTMAN
Thank you. [signs the release form]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, still later. Cartman and Kyle are in the recovery room surrounded by their parents. Stan and his parents are there, too. Balloons, a smiley-face and two banners, "I HOPE YOU GET BETTER!" and "GET WELL SOON", decorate Kyle's side of the room]
SHEILA
How are you feeling, boubbie?
KYLE
Better, thanks.
STAN
You look a lot better.
SHARON
Yeah, it looks like Western medicine really did the trick.
KYLE
Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan.
STAN
Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do.
CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
Yeah. [to Cartman] Hey, man, we're glad you're getting better, too.
CARTMAN
[wakes up] Heh. Hey, what what's going on?
STAN
Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you!
CARTMAN
Huh?
STAN
It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney.
DR. DOCTOR
Yes, but it was all a trick to get you to come in and sign this release.
LIANE
Isn't that funny, sweetie?
CARTMAN
Aarrrrrr! I am SO PISSED OFF!
MR. GARRISON
[enters the room and walks to Kyle's bed] Oh, here's everybody. [in his hand is a book]
STAN
Hey, Mr. Garrison. Where have you been?
MR. GARRISON
Boys, I have an announcement to make: I'm not gonna be your teacher anymore. I've become a best-selling author! And Kyle, I want you to have a signed copy as a get-well present. [hands the book to Kyle, who looks at it]
KYLE
Oh. ...Thanks?
CARTMAN
[livid] I swear I'm gonna kill you guys!!
STAN
Careful, Cartman, you might pop your stitches. [laughs a long time with Kyle]
KYLE
[white liquid spurts out his nose] Huh? [covers his nose] What the?
CARTMAN
Oh good, you got the crappy kidney.

synopsis:Chef's passionate protest declaring the South Park flag racist enflames the entire town.

script:Chef Goes Nanners

[The Mayor's office, day. The mayor is at her desk, flanked by her assistants. Before her are Chef and Jimbo. The meeting starts]
MAYOR
Gentlemen, I understand you are here to present both sides of an issue. I wanna hear you both out and do this in a civil and constructive manner so that I can give you both the time and attention you deserve. Jimbo, why don't you begin?
JIMBO
Mayor, it's about the South Park flag.
MAYOR
[instantly exasperated] Oh, Jesus Christ, not this again!
JIMBO
We cannot change the South Park flag, Mayor!
CHEF
Mayor, as I've said before, I find that flag to be racist and insensitive!
JIMBO
Chef, I respect you very much, but you have to understand that this has been the South Park flag since some of our ancestors, like my great-grandfather, founded this land!
CHEF
That flag represents a time when blacks were persecuted by whites! How can a black man not be bothered by it?!
MAYOR
Ahalright, Chef, I'll have my assistants hold up the flag. [the one with the bang goes to get it] and you tell me what exactly you find racist about it. [the assistant returns and gives one end to Johnson. They unfurl the flag between them. The flag shows a black figure dangling from a hangman's noose, and two white figures on either side of him rejoicing. "South Park" is written underneath]
CHEF
You don't see anything wrong with that flag?!
JIMBO
Chef, what about the baseball team, the Cleveland Indians, huh? Should they change their name because it's racist?
CHEF
Yeah!
JIMBO
No, because it's their history!
CHEF
Look, I have gone to every quiet protest I could! I have written everyone; I've put up signs! But now I'm telling you [points to the mayor and emphasizes], THIS FLAG WILL BE CHANGED!
JIMBO
And I'm telling you it WON'T!
MAYOR
[rolls her eyes] Oh, boy.
[South Park Elementary, day. The class bell rings and the kids are in their seats. Timmy is now shown with the class.]
MR. WYLAND
Okay, children, in Mr. Garrison's absence, I would like to turn the class's attention to current issues. Some people think the South Park flag should be changed, while others believe that changing the flag is wrong. I think this is a perfect subject for your debate club.
CLASS
[Timmy stays quiet] Aaaaah!
MR. WYLAND
I see that you've already had a lot of interesting debates this year. [points to a chart with three debates on it] Pro-Choice vs. Cartman, Pro-Gun Control vs. Cartman, a-and People Against the Clubbing of Baby Seals vs. Cartman. And apparently, the winner of all your debates so far has been... Cartman.
CARTMAN
Thaaat's ri-ight.
KYLE
Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore!
CLASS
[including Timmy] Yeah.
CARTMAN
Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys!
STAN
You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!
CARTMAN
Yes, I do!
CRAIG
No, you don't!
CARTMAN
Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home! [rises from his seat, heads for the door, and exits]
KYLE
Told ya.
MR. WYLAND
Alright, children, well, unlike Mr. Garrison, I want you all to go out and research this debate before we pick teams. Tomorrow, you'll need to choose which side of this poignant debate you are on. [the class stares back blankly]
[Jimbo and Ned's lodge, after school. They're sitting on the front porch.]
JIMBO
This is about history, kids. [Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and two others are present] If you don't have respect for your past, then you can never expect to- BIRD! [he and Ned each take a shot at it, and it tumbles away, falling dead into a large pile of dead birds on the road behind the boys] -then you can never expect to have a future. Nowadays, everyone wants to change mascots and flags because they're not [does quotes with his left index and middle finger] "politically correct." Well, where does it end? I mean, people are gonna start sayin' that the Denver Broncos are offensive to horses. And then we'll have to- a SQUIRREL! [He and Ned take shots at it, and it falls dead from its branch] And then we'll have to change everything, and pretty soon all our history will be forgotten. But to REALLY understand the South Park's flag's importance, you need to know about South Park's history. Ned here's a big history buff, and he can tell you the whole story. Ned?
NED
Nnneh, in 1867, fourteen pioneers from the East Coast traveled across the Plains-
STAN
Uh... that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it.
KYLE
Yeah, we got it.
JIMBO
You sure?
STAN, KYLE
Yup.
JIMBO
You boys go make me proud now and win that debate- Chris Peterson! [he and Ned fire away, and Chris yells and dodges the bullets, then runs off] God-damnit, we missed him again!
[South Park Supermarket, after school. Chef is at the entrance with a petition in his hands. With him are Wendy, Bebe, Clyde, and Butters. Some folks head for the store…]
CHEF
Sign up to join me, and come marching to the Mayor's office in protest of the South Park flag! [the shoppers brush on by and enter the store, and the doors close] You see that, children?! Nobody wants to get involved! [the doors open and Randy Marsh walks out with a bag of groceries. Chef notices] Randy! Sign up to march with me against the South Park flag on Wednesday?
RANDY
Oh, uuhh, look, Chef, you know I'm-m not a racist, but uh, I just don't really feel strongly one way or another about the flag.
CHEF
Well, alright, Marsh, you're entitled to your own opinion. [Randy walks away and Chef looks at the kids] That's how it is in this town. I haven't gotten one signature on this damn sheet, and I've been here all day!
WENDY
We'll march with you, Chef.
CHEF
That's nice, but I need the support of some registered voters. [Mr. Mackey walks out with some groceries. Chef stops him] Ey, Mackey! Sign up to march on Wednesday?
MR. MACKEY
Oo, Wednesday? Uh-Wednesday's tough. I guess- maybe I could do somthin' uh, Thursday afternoon.
CHEF
Alright, fudge it, Thursday. Anyone else wanna go Thursday?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[arrives] Thursday's no good, we've got choir council.
MR. MACKEY
Oh, yeah.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
What about next Sunday?
CHEF
Fine! Next Sunday!
MAN 1
You mean, during the ball game?
MAN 2
Oh, yeah. We can't do Sunday.
CHEF
Monday??
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh, I can't do Monday.
MAN 3
[arrives] I could do Tuesday.
MR. MACKEY
Yeah, Tuesday morning's good.
MAN 1
You know what would be better for me is Saturday afternoon.
MAN 2
Saturday is perfect for me.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Yeah. How about Saturday at 11:30?
MAN 3
Mm hmm.
MAN 2, WOMAN 2
Yeah.
MAN 1
Yeah.
MAN 3
That sounds good.
MAN 2
Mm hmm.
MR. MACKEY
Yeah, I think that's the best day.
CHEF
Okay! On Saturday, we march!
MAN 2
Oh, march? What are we marching for?
CHEF
To bring down the South Park Flag!
MAN 2
…Oh. [the adults begin to disperse]
MAN 3
Oohh, I gotta go.
MAN 1
I know what I may like. I don't like marching.
WOMAN 2
Uh, marching's really not for me.
MAN 2
See you later.
[South Park Elementary, next day. Mr. Wyland's class. He's at the chalkboard tallying up the votes. There are eight votes on each side of the board: eight on the left for "FLAG SHOULD CHANGE," eight on the right for "FLAG SHOULD STAY THE SAME"]
MR. WYLAND
Well I've counted up all your secret ballots, children, and it look like about half of you think the flag should stay, and half think the flag should be changed.
WENDY
How could any of you think that flag should stay the way it is?!
MR. WYLAND
Save it for the debate, Wendy. Now I'm going to assign the debate leaders. Who wants to lead the "Flag Should Stay The Way It Is" team?
STAN, KYLE
[raising their hands] Me. Me. Me. Me.
WENDY
[upset] Stan?! How could you be so insensitive?!
STAN
Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag.
KYLE
Yeah, me neither.
MR. WYLAND
Alright. Stan and Kyle, [turns and writes on the board] you can both be the team leaders for the "Flag should stay the way it is" team. [turns around. Their names are there now] Now, who wants to lead the "Flag should be changed" team? [an angry Wendy raises her hand. Cartman looks over at her, then raises his hand and chuckles] Okay, Wendy and Eric can team up. [writes their names on the board]
WENDY
[mortified] Nooo! [Cartman chuckles some more]
MR. WYLAND
Alright, children. Do your homework, and let's get ready for a great debate!
[South Park Elementary, cafeteria. Kids enjoy their meals. Craig enters the kitchen, followed by Stan, Kyle, Butters, and someone else]
STAN, KYLE
Hello, Chef.
CHEF
[in a foul mood] My name isn't Chef anymore, children. I've converted to Islam.
STAN
Islam??
CHEF
From now on, my name is [points to his apron] Abdul Mohammed Jabar [points to the rest of his name on a sign held by an Arab assistant] Rauf Kareem Ali. [proceeds with preparing the trays] With everyone in town so insensitive about the flag, I find it no longer fitting to use my slave name!
STAN
Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed.
CHEF
You WHAT?! [plants his fists on the counter while the assistant struggles to keep his half of the name sign in line with Chef's apron] You don't think they should change the flag?!
KYLE
Not really.
STAN
Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is.
CHEF
[moves to his right and sets the ladle and a pot down] Well, that figures you don't! Because your cracker-ass parents turned you into little cracker-ass cracker-racists! I never thought I'd live to see this many of the people I considered friends turn against me!
STAN
But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about, it's--
CHEF
But nothin'! [picks up the ladle and throws it down] "But" my ass! Fix your own damn food! [hurries out, and his assistant quickly follows. Stan and Kyle look at each other, confused]
[South Park Elementary, school library. Wendy has assembled her team and leads them through preliminary items. In her team are Bebe, Clyde, Butters, Tolkien, Kevin, and three others. Cartman is not there yet.]
WENDY
Okay. Now, in order for us the debate to change the South Park flag, we will need to do a lot of research. Now, my plan is to divide up into three research teams. We will present our arguments based on things that w-
CARTMAN
[enters] It's okay, I'm here.
WENDY
[glares at him for a few seconds] Nice of you to show up! We were just discussing how we should state our case.
CARTMAN
[begins pacing] Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility.
WENDY
[stunned] What??
CARTMAN
That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility! [starts barking orders] Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever.
BUTTERS
Wwuhuh-o-kay! [hops off his chair. Wendy watches him leave]
CARTMAN
The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy.
CLYDE
Right. [the others disperse, leaving Wendy and Cartman facing each other at the round table.]
CARTMAN
[takes out some Cheesy Poofs] Mmmm.
WENDY
[walks up to him] Cartman, we can't just attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. We need to present our side of the debate.
CARTMAN
You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again?
WENDY
The South Park flag!
CARTMAN
Interesting. Aaand, what side are we on?
WENDY
D'aaaaahhh!
CARTMAN
Whoa! Calm down, ho. [eats some poofs]
[South Park City Hall, day. A Channel 4 field reporter is on scene. Chef is in the background dressed in a daishiki facing the Hall, with his fist up. Two groups of people are there, one on either side of him. The mayor and her assistants look out over the scene from her office]
REPORTER
["NEWS 4 LIVE!"] Tom, I'm standing out front of the South Park Mayor's Office, where both sides of this debate have gathered.
CHEF
Change the flag!
JIMBO
Don't change history!
MAYOR
Oh brother, what now?!
CHEF
[background, as the reporter speaks] Change the flag! Change the flag!…
REPORTER
Earlier, the South Park townspeople voiced their opinion.
MAN 4
[angry] Well, I think the flag is racist! [turns pensive] Huh, but then again, it is part of our history.
MAN 5
Well, I guess the flag is part of history, …but I can see how it is racist.
MAN 6
[flatly, slowly] I think it is history. I think it is racist.
REPORTER
Well, one things for sure, tensions are high and pressure is mounting on the South Park Mayor to do something.
CHEF
[background, as the reporter speaks] …Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag! [the mayor simply looks down] In the 1960s there was a monk [shows a photo of Thích Quảng Đức in flames] who set himself on fire to protest! You have left me no choice! [lowers the photo] To protest your lack of humanity, I will now do the same thing! [raises a portable gas tank and a lighter, then pours the gasoline on a Tibetan monk and sets him on fire]
MONK
[in flames] Huh! Haaaaaaaaaaaah! [dies]
THE KKK
[arriving] White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!
REPORTER
[stunned, then speaks] What's this? Uh, Tom, it looks as if the KKK have shown up to express their opinion.
KKK LEADER
[walks up to Jimbo and extends his hand.] Hello, brother. [Jimbo and his group turns to see the Klan] We are here to support your noble cause.
JIMBO
Huh? Uh hey now, uh. We don't want your support. We're not racists; this is about history.
NED
Yeah.
KKK LEADER
Well, whether you want our support or not, we're on your side! [he and the rest of the KKK face right and march away]
THE KKK
White Power! White Power! [Jimbo and the others watch them leave] White Power! White Power! [they take up positions in front of City Hall, facing Chef. A familiar figure is chanting with them] White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!
SHEILA
[arrives] Mr. Garrison, you're a Klan member?!
MR. GARRISON
NO, no, [steps out] but Mr. Hat is. [points to the puppet, which is dressed in a Klan robe and bends down a few times as if to say "hello"]
MR. GARRISON
[Voicing Mr. Hat] White Power! White Power!
MR. GARRISON
Ogh! You're such a racist bastard, Mr. Hat.
THE KKK
White Power!
CHEF
Change the flag!
JIMBO
Don't change history!
MAYOR
Ooh, Jesus. What a mess.
[South Park City Hall, Mayor's office, later.]
MAYOR
Chef, we realize that you find the South Park flag racist, and we certainly understand your case. [shot of an angry Chef] We have been diligently working on this problem, put in a lot of hours, and we have finally altered the flag in a way that we think will make you very happy. Gentlemen? [her assistants lift up a flag and carry it to a clear area, then unfurl it for Chef to see] There. Is that better? [It looks the same…]
CHEF
No, damnit!
MAYOR
[points to the black figure] No, but look! He's got a little smile now! [a close-up reveals closed eyes and a smile] See? He's happy. Much better, don't you think? [Chef just rises and walks out. The mayor lumps in her chair] Well, some people just won't work with you at all. This is getting out of hand. How do I absolve myself of an responsibility with this?
JOHNSON
Mayor, the-ee South Park Elementary children are discussing the flag issue in their debate club on Friday.
ASSISTANT
We… could use the debate as an excuse to hold a vote on the issue.
MAYOR
Yes, of course. Let the children be responsible. Everybody loves children. Tell the press. South Park Elementary will be holding a vote on Friday!
[South Park Elementary, school library. Wendy has three stacks of books to pore over, Cartman is playing with his toys]
WENDY
This might come in handy. It says here that recently a case was brought before the South Carolina Court about their flag, and they-
CARTMAN
I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone! [as Bog Monster] O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you in the nuts?!
WENDY
If we could show a parallel between the South Carolina case-
CARTMAN
[as Captain Candycone] Ugh. Oh yeah?! I'll kick you in the nuts! [as Bog Monster] Ugh. I'll kick you in the nuts! [as Captain Candycone] I'll kick you in the nuts!
WENDY
Cartman, why don't you just go home?! You aren't helping any!
CARTMAN
You won't let me help.
WENDY
That's because you're stupid, and you're a racist!
CARTMAN
[thinks a moment…] …Touché. But dude, you might as well let me help you. We're in this together. I mean, just… tell me what to do, and I'll do it. [Wendy remains mad at him. He does Bog Monster] Wendih, let Cartman help. Seriouslih. [she averts her gaze, then breaks into a smile] Wendih. Seriouslih. [she chuckles] The Bog Monster speaketh.
[South Park, the offices of Brovlofski and Jackson, Attorneys At Law. Kyle and Stan have assembled their team there. Kenny, Craig and Tweek are there with two others.]
KYLE
Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want. [Kenny chows down tablets from a blue bowl before him] Who wants to read them? [no one responds]
STAN
Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!
KYLE
Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus!
KENNY
(Plenty. This is 'cause my family's poor.)
KYLE
I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner.
KENNY
(Ah, fuck you!) [gives him the finger]
STAN
I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side.
KYLE
Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend.
KENNY
[burps] (Hey, can I have a drink of water?)
KYLE
Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there. [Kenny hops off and walks to the dispenser]
STAN
Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints. [Mr. Broflovski enters]
GERALD
[stops behind Kenny's chair] Hey, boys, how's the research coming?
KYLE
Pretty good, I guess.
STAN
Do you think they should change the flag?
GERALD
Oh, uuhh. I don't know. [picks up the empty bowl]
KYLE
Kenny ate all the mints, dad.
GERALD
Oh, those weren't mints, those were antacid tablets.
KYLE
Oh.
STAN, KYLE
Kenny! [Mr. Broflovski looks in anticipation]
KENNY
[drinks the water, then looks at them] (What?) [the tablets start to fizz] (Oh oooooooOOOOOOOH!) [as his voice rises, his body balloons and foam comes out of all possible orifices. Then he bursts and parts of him fall all over. Some antacid squirts out of somewhere. At the table, body parts and antacid cover some books, parts of the table, and on parts of everyone left. The other students and Mr. Broflovski laugh. Stan and Kyle clap somewhat]
STAN
That was a good one.
[South Park City Hall. The KKK is still rallying. Mr. Hat keeps Mr. Garrison in place]
THE KKK
White Power! White Power!
KKK LEADER
Do not change the flag! It is a symbol of white power!
THE KKK
White Power!
MR. GARRISON
[now next to the leader] Oohh, I'm sorry, Chef. Mr. Hat is a racist son of a bitch.
MR. GARRISON
[Voicing Mr. Hat] Don't apologize for me to that spearchucker!
MR. GARRISON
[shocked] Dugh! [covers his mouth. Chef looks at him an angry disbelief] Ogh. Waaaaah! [runs away]
CHEF
[approaches one group] How can you all just stand by and let these racists do this?!
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, Chef, it's freedom of speech. We don't like it, but we can't arrest them for talking.
REPORTER
Should the Klan be allowed to rally on the steps of the Capitol? Here's what some people think.
MAN 7
Well, I think they are racist, but I… do think freedom of speech is important.
MAN 8
Well, I, for one, believe in freedom of speech. …Mmm but then again, I think they are racist.
MAN 9
Well, I believe that they are racist, but I do believe that all-
CHEF
[shoves the man out of the way] Aw, to hell with all of you indecisive bastards!
REPORTER
On Friday, South Park Elementary will present its debate, and after the debate, there will finally be a vote. Preliminary polls show three in favor of changing the flag, three against changing the flag, and 4382 undecided. [Results show on screen in text beside him]Z So the pressure in on those South Park kids!
KKK LEADER
Well, that's enough rallying for this afternoon, members. Let's take a hot shower!
THE KKK
Hot shower! Hot shower! Hot shower! [they march away]
JIMBO
[to Ned] Ned, nobody's gonna vote for our side if it's the side those KKK members are on. Come on, we gotta put a stop to them.
[South Park Elementary, school library, night. Wendy and Cartman are both laboring over books. Between them is a tray of Oreo cookies.]
WENDY
I can't believe it. All the pressure's on us. I mean, this debate is going to actually affect the outcome of the vote.
CARTMAN
[aloof] Uh huh.
WENDY
Oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument.
CARTMAN
Why don't we just talk about the swastika?
WENDY
Huh?
CARTMAN
I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,… obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it.
WENDY
[mulls over the argument] Hey, that's a pretty good point, Cartman.
CARTMAN
Yeah.
WENDY
Not bad at all. I may make that our first argument. [takes a cookie]
CARTMAN
Cool.
WENDY
Double-stuffed cookies are my favorite. [starts eating]
CARTMAN
Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make "quadruple stuffs."
WENDY
Hey, that's what I always do, too!
CARTMAN
No way!
WENDY
Yeah. Jesus, I never thought I'd have anything in common with you, Cartman.
CARTMAN
Me neither. [Romantic music starts to play]
WENDY
Aha ha.
CARTMAN
Huh.
WENDY, CARTMAN
Well, anyway, let's get back to work. [two kids speak in unison]
CARTMAN
Whoa.
WENDY
Weird, um. Okay. Uh. Now, let's say that first we talk about the history of the flag. [reaches for a cookie] We can show that the- [Cartman's hand rests on hers. Their eyes meet and the music crescendos]
CARTMAN
[withdraws his hand] Ur, s-sorry. [shoves the plate to her a bit] Go ahead.
WENDY
No. [shoves the plate back, Music fades.] You go ahead.
[South Park transition music. Mr. Garrison's house, night. The living room. Mr. Garrison enters]
MR. GARRISON
Mr. Hat, what do you think you're doing?
MR. GARRISON
[Voices Mr. Hat] There's another Klan rally tonight; I have to be there in 15 minutes.
MR. GARRISON
Ooh no, Mr. Hat. You are not dragging to another Klan meeting.
MR. GARRISON
[Voices Mr. Hat] But they're electing a new assistant to the Grand Dragon. I might get elected.
MR. GARRISON
Well, good for you, Puppet Pants! I'll have nothin' to do with it!
MR. GARRISON
[Voices Mr. Hat] I'm going whether you like it or not!
MR. GARRISON
Oh yeah?! [sits in his armchair and waits] I'm not going, Mr. Hat, and that's final! [looks away] Let's just see you try and go without me! [looks back again, and his right hand is bare] Mi-Mr. Hat?
[South Park, the woods. The KKK rallies around a burning cross.]
THE KKK
White Power! White Power! White Power! [Jimbo and Ned rise up out of the brush and look at the rally] White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!
JIMBO
[softly, during the rally] Alright, Ned. We've got to be careful. These are really evil men we're dealing with.
NED
Mmm-okay.
JIMBO
Damnit Ned, doesn't that thing have a volume control?
NED
No.
THE KKK
White Power! White Power!

[walks in and stands in front of the burning cross, raising his arms to quiet the group] Good evening, brothers. Our first order of business tonight is to have Brother Anderson update us on last week's minutes.
BROTHER ANDERSON
Last week we decided we hate blacks and Jews. A lot!
KKK LEADER
Alright. And now it's time for us all to come together, and… do our cake raffle.
KKK MEMBERS
[ad lib] Oh, cake raffle. [Jimbo and Ned look at each other]
KKK LEADER
This week's winner is… [reads the ticket] uh, 2 9 7 4.
TICKET 2974 HOLDER
[jumps for joy] I won, I won. [moves forward] I won the cake! [takes it and returns to his place]
KKK LEADER
God job, brother. [smattering of applause. Jimbo and Ned look on.]
[Happy music plays. A green and flowering meadow under a brilliant orange dawn. A happy Wendy walks in and grabs some flowers, then sniffs them deeply. She then looks behind her to find a topless Cartman sitting on a white steed under a bright yellow sun. Romantic music swells. The steed neighs]
WENDY
[turns and runs to him] Cartman! [Cartman gets off the steed and runs to Wendy, his hair billowing in the wind]
CARTMAN
Ahh! [they run into each other's arms and tumble down, laughing all the while. At the bottom, Wendy's on her back and Cartman is on top of her]
WENDY
Say it'll be like this forever.
CARTMAN
Okay, It will be like this forever.
WENDY
Oh, Cartman! [Cartman looks at her, his hair billowing in the wind]
[Wendy's room, night. She rises in bed with a start. That scene in the meadow was a dream]
WENDY
AAAAAAaaaah! [pants heavily, then dunks her head in the fish bowl on the little desk next to her bed.] Brrrrr. What's wrong with me? [hops down and heads for the bathroom, flips the lights on, goes to the sink, hops on a stool, and checks out her tongue and eyes, while Russell Crowe poster behind her stares on] Ahhh. It's okay. Get a grip, girl. [hops down and heads for the switch. She's about to turn off the lights when a voice stops her]
CARTMAN'S VOICE
Wendih. [she looks at the Russell Crowe poster next to the switch] Wendih. [Rusell's face stretches into one of Cartman]
WENDY
[shocked at the hallucination] Aaaah!
CARTMAN'S VOICE
[the face reverts to Russell's as the voice fades] Wendih, look at me.
WENDY
[turns around, looks up, then sits down with her face in her hands] Oh God, please don't let this be happening.
[South Park, the woods, deep in the night.]
KKK LEADER
Alright brothers, listen up! [two more members looking suspiciously familiar show up, and the leader starts to pace back and forth] As you know, this fine city is holding a vote on whether or not to change their flag. But lynching minorities is history! So what are we gonna do about it?!
MEMBER 1
Let's say that if they change the flag, we'll burn down the Capitol!
KKK MEMBERS
Yeah!
MEMBER 2
Let's say that if they change the flag, we'll never leave this town!
KKK MEMBERS
Yeah!
JIMBO
[in KKK disguise] Let's say they should change the flag!
KKK MEMBERS
Yeah! [turn to see the new member] Wah?
KKK LEADER
Uh what's that, brother?
JIMBO
I think we should switch sides!
NED
Me too. Nnn-that's a good idea.
JIMBO
Look, we have to accept the fact that most people in the world hate us, right?
KKK MEMBERS
[rolling reaction] Yeah, m-hm.
JIMBO
So, whatever side we're on is the side that's gonna lose, right?
KKK MEMBERS
[rolling reaction] Right, yeah.
JIMBO
So why don't we all say that we want the flag changed. That way, most folks'll vote to keep it the way it is.
KKK LEADER
That's a great idea, brother!
KKK MEMBERS
[jubilant, jumping] Yeah!
KKK LEADER
Alright, it is decided! We will officially tell everyone that we want the flag changed, so that they will all vote against us!
KKK MEMBERS
[ad lib] Hooray, yeah! [the two new members leave]
A MEMBER
We're smart! [the two members head into the brush]
JIMBO
[both members take off their hoods] That worked perfectly, Ned.
KKK LEADER
Well alright, now that that's out of the way, it is time to play, "Whose got the silliest thing on under their robe?"
KKK MEMBERS
[ad lib] Yeah, woohoo! [a member walks up to an organ and sits. He begins to play "If You're Happy And You Know It…" The rest form two lines and clap.]
[The contest. The first member walks down the middle and shows off his boxers with a heart design. The second comes in and shows off his lederhosen. The third comes in and shows off bikini briefs and garters. The fourth comes in and shows off a yellow bird costume.]
JIMBO
[Watching from the bushes with their hoods now off]Jesus, Ned, these guys are completely nuts.
NED
Mm-yup.
[the fifth member comes in and shows off his hand-walking skills, and the sixth one shows off his penis… Jimbo and Ned walk away from the scene]
JIMBO
[stops] That is the most insane thing I've ever seen. I can't believe those people are on our side. I mean, is our side that crazy? [some headlights pass over them and they shield their eyes. A station wagon rolls up with Chef behind the wheel. Jimbo waves hello.] Oh, hello, Chef. Big debate tomorrow, I guess. [Chef glowers at them for a few seconds. Dramatic music plays.] Oh, Jesus, the robes! Chef, this isn't what it looks like. You've gotta listen to us!
CHEF
I ain't gonna listen to nothin'! This whole cracker-ass town can kiss my ass! [peels off. Mud flies behind the Town & Country and splatters Jimbo and Ned]
JIMBO
Ned, I'm starting to think that maybe history ain't worth defendin' sometimes.
[Scene-change music. Wendy's house, morning, before school. Living room]
WENDY
[leads Bebe in] Thanks for coming over, Bebe. I have something to tell you.
BEBE
Sure, what?
WENDY
Bebe, I'm attracted to Cartman.
BEBE
[shrieks and covers her ears] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
WENDY
[ashamed] I know.
BEBE
Why would you tell me this? Why would you tell anyone this?
WENDY
Because I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate, and if I can't concentrate, then I can't win the debate tomorrow. The whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job-
BEBE
Alright, look. When two people work closely for a long time, sometimes they feel what's called, "sexual tension." Sometimes you just have to act on impulse and get it over with.
WENDY
You mean, I should kiss him? [looks away embarrassed]
BEBE
Kiss him and get it out of your system.
WENDY
[dreading] Oh God.
[South Park Elementary, the gym. Mr. Wyland is shown behind a podium, and the South Park flag hangs from some rafters behind him. Two tables are set up, one for each side of the debate. Behind the "FLAG SHOULD STAY THE SAME" table are Stan, Kyle, and two other boys. Behind the "FLAG SHOULD CHANGE" table are Wendy, Cartman, Tolkien, and Butters.]
MR. WYLAND
Well I certainly would like to thank all the parents for their support of our debate club. [the bleachers are shown. The mayor, Chef, Jimbo and Ned, and others are present] I r-realize that many of you are torn by the issues as well, so, perhaps the children can shed some light on us. We'll start with Wendy Testaburger on the "Flag Should Be Changed" team. [Wendy hops off her seat, then looks at Cartman and strokes her chin, then steps up to look at the audience. She looks again at Cartman. He's been watching her all the while, wondering where this is all headed]
WENDY
[Piano music implying a pending dramatic moment approaches. Wendy looks at the audience] The- [looks at Cartman] the- uh, [clears her throat] aheh ahum, [looks at Cartman] the… the- uh, [closes her eyes and pushes her hands out as if to push away the feelings swirling within] Ahhhhh, [exhales softly, then sighs] The first argument we- [her eyes snap back to Cartman, who's still watching her. Stan and Kyle watch as well] ah… [resets] Let me start over. [looks at Stan] The uh- [loses her rudder] oh God. Could you all excuse me for a moment? [steps down and kisses a surprised Cartman full on the lips while she makes high pitched, humming sounds] Mmmmmummmmeeemmeeemeeemmee...
PEOPLE IN AUDIENCE
[ad lib] Oh. [Stan's jaw drops]
REALLY SHOCKED MAN
[off camera] Oh, God! [Butters' and Tolkien's jaws drop. So does Chef's. Wendy finally releases the pucker, sighs in happy relief, and goes back to the podium]
WENDY
[confident now] There. Now, the main point we would like to make is oftentimes it is prudent to change history. As times change we hope to grow, and as we grow our rules must change. It is a natural part of evolution. Thank you. [steps down as people clap. Stan is still in shock that Wendy kissed Cartman. She sits down, Cartman looks at her, then places his hands behind his head in a supreme air of confidence and looks away]
MR. WYLAND
Okay, and Kyle and Stan's team, your main point? [Kyle moves to the podium while Stan remains stunned]
KYLE
Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill. [an astonished Stan looks as Cartman puts his right hand on the back of Wendy's chair and points at her with his left, winks, then does a victory hand dance. A smiling Wendy remains oblivious to this showing off] And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing. [returns to his seat amid a smattering of applause]
CHEF
[stands up] Whoa whoa whooaa! You just missed the point entirely!
KYLE
Huh?
CHEF
I'm not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin' killed, It's because it's racist!
KYLE'S TEAM
[minus Stan who's mouth is still hanging open as he stares at Wendy] Racist??
CHEF
Children, don't you even know what this argument is about?! That flag is racist because a black man is being hung by white people.
KYLE'S TEAM
[minus Stan still shocked] Ooooooohhh.
CHEF
Ooooooohhh?!
KYLE
W-we really didn't see it that way.
CHEF
But that's a black man up there!
KYLE
Y-yeah, but… the color of someone's skin doesn't matter.
CHEF
Well of course it matters when- [catches himself] …Oh my God. Wait a minute. You children didn't even see the flag as a black man being hanged by white people, did you?
KYLE'S TEAM
[except stunned Stan] No.
CHEF
[deducing, marveling] Why, that is- that is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard.
MAYOR
What?
MR. WYLAND
What?
CHEF
Don't you see? All this time I thought these little crackers had turned racist, when actually they were so not racist that they didn't even make a separation of black and white to begin with. All they saw when they looked at that flag was five people.
A FEW PEOPLE
Awww.
SOME KKK MEMBERS
Awww.
KYLE
Yeah. [Cartman is still showing off, Wendy remains oblivious, Stan remains shocked]
CHEF
I'm sorry, children. I was wrong about you. But I still the flag needs to be changed. But now I realize that I almost let racism turn me into a racist.
JIMBO
Yeah. You know, uh I suddenly found myself on the side of Klan members. I've never had anything against blacks, Chef.
CHEF
Oh, I know you don't, Jimbo. I've known you for almost ten years. You're a good man.
JIMBO
We've been way too divisive over this, Chef. Maybe we can come up with a- compromise flag—something that everybody can be happy with.
CHEF
I think that's a much better start than me tryin' to separate myself from all you wonderful crackers.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS
[relieved, ad lib] Ooh, huhuh. Oooh [Stan's astonished gaze was fixed on Cartman and Wendy all that time while Cartman continued his happy hand dance.]
KYLE
Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now. [waves his hand in front of Stan to get his attention] Stan?
[South Park City Hall, day. The Mayor has called a town meeting at City Hall and now stands at her podium with the town gathered before her. Something hangs above her covered by a brown curtain]
MAYOR
This has been an interesting week in South Park. We've all done a lot of growing this week. [shot of the crowd, some of them smiling] Everyone was afraid to take a stand on this issue. But now we have learned once again that black, white, yellow, brown, or whatever, we are all just people. And so, I am very excited to unveil our new South Park Flag! [The curtain falls away to reveal the same flag, only with the five people, including the hanged man, holding hands. The crowd cheers. From left to right: a white man, a yellow man, the hanged black man, a red man, and another black man]
STAN
[recovered, looks at the flag] Wait, I don't get it.
KYLE
No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist.
CHEF
Hooray!
JIMBO
I have to admit it, that is a lot nicer.
WENDY
Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with. [the applause begins to die down]
CARTMAN
Me, too!
WENDY
[applause stops, background music plays] I can't believe how right Bebe was about feeling under pressure with somebody. As soon as it was over, all my feelings for you just vanished.
CARTMAN
[fronting] Oh, huh. Yeah. Yeah, totally huh.
WENDY
I'm totally back to normal. See you later. [the crowd disperses behind her as she pats Cartman's shoulder]
CARTMAN
Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho, [finger points at her] huhuh, he, haha.
WENDY
Hahaha. [looks off to her right] Stan. Stan, wait up! [hurries away to catch up to him. Cartman looks at her, then away, then at her long, then away, than at her quick one last time, then looks down and sighs. He turns to his left and walks away, dejected]
End of Chef Goes Nanners

synopsis:"Fingerbang" is the newest boy band starring all the boys and it's also Cartman's latest scheme to make a million dollars.

script:Something You Can Do with Your Finger

[A large city at night. Klieg lights pierce through the air as a large crowd gathers in front of a large building.]
ANNOUNCER
Tonight, Stellar Productions presents the boy band of the decade! [women scream, jump, and shout. Signs reading "FINGERBANG RULES," "FINGER BANG," "WE LOVE FINGER BANG," AND "FINGER BANG 4EVER" bob throughout the audience] It's Fingerbang, live from Madison Square Gardens! [the interior is shown, with cheering crowds. A heralding sound effect plays, and spotlights flicker around the stage. A burst of fireworks cues the music and the familiar silhouettes of four boys are shown on stage. A few women faint]
FINGERBANG
[the lights go on them, and it's the boys, dressed in white outfits. Their hats are all white, too. A green shirt indicates Kyle, a blue one Stan. Kenny wears an orange visor over his white hood. All wear headsets]
Fingerbang!
[they each spin towards the audience once, then stop]
Bang-bang!
Fingerbang-bang!
[they spin back to their first positions]
Bangbangbang!
[all step forward and do their routine]
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright
'Cause I'm the king of fingerbang; let's not fight
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you ever-y night
CARTMAN
[steps forward for a solo bridge as the others sway back and forth]
And girl, you know that you're the only girl for me, girl
Girl, you're the girl of my fantasy
You're my girl, you're my girl
WOMAN
[as Cartman sings] Cartman, I want youuu!
CARTMAN
[continues] My... girrrrrrrl... [lifts up his shirt to show off the right breast—um, pec. The others turn to their right while maintaining their gaze and pointing their gun fingers at the audience. The music builds as women scream at the sight]
FINGERBANG
[Cartman rejoins the others and all point their gun fingers at the audience, then resume the routine]
Fingerbang!
Bang... Bang bang bang
Fingerbang-bang!
Bangbangbang!
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang--
[Cartman's room, night. He's tossing and turning joyfully in his sleep. The song continues playing in his mind:
"--you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright"]
CARTMAN
Yes! Yes! I'm a star! I'm a star! I'm-- [wakes up, then looks angry] Aaawww, I'm nobody! God-dammit! [suddenly thinks] Wait a minute. Maybe that was a sign from God. That's it, isn't it? You want me to start a boy band so I can make $10 million, don't you? That's it! [rushes out of bed]
[Cartman residence, day. Cartman has Stan, Kyle, and Kenny over in the living room.]
CARTMAN
[pacing back and forth] Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives. [stops and faces them] God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million.
KYLE
...How?
CARTMAN
Boy band.
STAN
Boy band?
CARTMAN
Boy band.
KYLE
I'm not being in any [crosses his arms over his chest] faggy boy band!
CARTMAN
There's nothing faggy about $10 million, asshole! This was a message from God!
STAN
Dude, we don't have any musical talent.
CARTMAN
That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass! [pulls out a tape from his back pocket] I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over!
KENNY
(That sounds totally fuckin' stupid.)
CARTMAN
Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall. [intense] So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it--
KYLE
Wait a minute. There's only four of us.
CARTMAN
So?
KYLE
So, all boy bands have five members.
CARTMAN
What?
KYLE
'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members.
STAN
He's right.
CARTMAN
[throws down the tape] Dammit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We'll put off practice for now, and hold auditions for a fifth member. Get the word out that auditions will be tomorrow morning!
[Marsh residence, night. The family is gathered for dinner, enjoying ham and turkey]
SHARON
Did you have fun at Eric's house today, Stanley?
STAN
Well, I guess.
SHARON
What did you do?
STAN
Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall. [Randy reacts, and Shelly takes notice]
SHARON
Oh well, that sounds nice.
RANDY
[to Sharon, angrily] No, it does NOT sound nice! [to Stan] Stanley, you are gonna have no part in that boy band.
STAN
Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it.
RANDY
[rises] If all your friends jumped off a cliff, [jabs his finger at Stan] would you do that too?
STAN
[voice shaking] Cartman says we can make $10 million.
RANDY
You are not gonna be in a boy band, Stanley! AND THAT IS FINAL! [storms out]
SHELLY
Geez, what's up Dad's ass?
[Cartman residence, next morning, "BOY BAND AUDITIONS TODAY!!" Music begins. Inside, Butters is singing his song in front of the sofa]
BUTTERS
[holds two fingers on his right hand up to indicate a hopping bunny]
Little Bunny Foo-Foo hoppin' through the forest
[scoops up imaginary mice, makes two fists, and bops the right one with the left]
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head
[shimmies down with hands outstretched. The auditors look half-asleep]
Down came a white angel and she said
[the angel (left finger) reprimands the bunny]
"Little Bunny Foo-Foo, I don't wanna see you
[the piano player seems familiar. The angle bops the bunny]
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head"
So now I'm gonna turn you into a worm, mbuh, mBunny Foo-Foo... Eh, beh-POOF
[slaps his right hand with his left, and one finger goes down, leaving a worm]
Little Wormy Foo-Foo crawlin' through the forest
Gettin scooped up by the field mice who mah-m then they bopped 'im on the head
[grins, then does a little kick forward]
CARTMAN
[through the mic] Eheh, thank you Butters. We'll let you know.
BUTTERS
Ah, I can do it again.
CARTMAN
[through the mic] We'll let you know, Butters.
BUTTERS
Ahah-oo well, alright then. [walks off to his left, unsure]
CARTMAN
Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off!
KYLE
It was?
STAN
Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that.
CARTMAN
Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we'd better do it better than that. [into the mic] Next!
STAN
[reads from a list] Uhhh, next is Ike Broflovski.
CARTMAN
Kyle's brother?
KYLE
I promised my mom I'd let him try. [Ike hops in with some sheet music]
CARTMAN
Christ's sake..!
SCHROEDER
What key?
IKE
[hands him the sheet] G. [hops back to the sofa as the kid plays]
Itsy bitsy spider, out the water spout--
CARTMAN
[through the mic] Next!
IKE
Oh Danny Boy, the parson's calling
Clang, clang and clang
CARTMAN
[through the mic] Next audition!
IKE
E F G, H I J K L-M-N-O-P
CARTMAN
[through the mic] Goddammit, NEXT!
IKE
One on a teacher on a palm tree
"G-U-B, When the teacher wanna punch me"
CARTMAN
[through the mic] Not the next song, the next PERSON! [Ike goes for his sheet music, then returns to flip Cartman off.] Aw, man, this is gonna be a long-ass day. [the front door opens and in walks Wendy with her sheet music. She walks to the piano player, gives it to him--] Oh no! Nononononono! Sorry, Wendy, this tryout's for a boy band! [a grinning Wendy suddenly frowns and her head hangs.]
STAN
Aw, come on, dude. Let her try.
CARTMAN
[moves the mic away] No way!
KYLE
Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked anybody else!
CARTMAN
Okayokay, fine. Wow me.
WENDY
[cues the player]
Miiis-suuus Landers was a health nut; She cooked food in a wok
Mr. Harris was her boyfriend, and he had a great big-
Cock-a-doodle-doodle, the rooster just won't quit

And if you all don't like it, I don't give a flying fuck!
[Stan, Kyle, and Kenny applaud]
CARTMAN
Thanks, Wendy. Don't call us. We won't call you either, heheh. [Wendy is angered]
KYLE
Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome!
CARTMAN
Dude, she's a chick!
STAN
Come on, nobody's gonna notice.
CARTMAN
"Nobody's gonna notice"?! What about her huge freakin' hooters, huh?! [Wendy looks down at her chest]
STAN
She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.
KYLE
Me too.
KENNY
(Me too.)
CARTMAN
Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up!
WENDY
[exults] Yeah!
[Cartman's house, next morning, early. A rooster crows. Cartman has his band in his room, and they are still drowsy. Stan is about to fall over...]
CARTMAN
Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse?
STAN
Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?
CARTMAN
We have to rehearse all that we can! [moves away] Now, check this out: [returns with a box of clothes and sets it on the floor] My mom made us costumes!
STAN
Costumes? [the band gathers around the box]
CARTMAN
Yeah. [starts handing out the costumes] This one's yours, Stan. This one is Kyle's. This one will cover up Wendy's hooters... [she looks a little embarrassed]
STAN
Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?
CARTMAN
'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough.
KYLE
[dryly] I wanna be the tough one.
CARTMAN
[looks back blankly] ...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not--
KYLE
[determined] I wanna be the tough one!
CARTMAN
You can't be the tough one because you're Jewish!
KYLE
Jews are tough!
CARTMAN
Since when?!
KYLE
Since Abraham, fatass!
CARTMAN
Alright, fine! Here! [tosses the tough costume at Kyle, knocking him down] Jesus Christ, I wonder if every boy band has to go through this! [moves away. The band dresses. Kenny is a baseball player, Stan is a fighter pilot, Cartman is an Elvis impersonator, Kyle is a tough dude with nose ring and Fu Manchu mustache]
STAN
Hey, Cartman, what does "fingerbang" mean, anyways?
CARTMAN
I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you... [waves his finger around] pretend to use your finger like a gun or something.
KENNY
[chuckling] (Hm hm, noho, that's not what it means.)
STAN
Kenny says that's not what it means.
CARTMAN
[testy] Okay, Kenny, what does "fingerbang" mean, then?
KENNY
(It's when you take your finger, and you stick it in a vagina and you stick it in again and again.)
CARTMAN
...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!
[South Park Mall, day. South Park is not so small anymore. Two guards on the second floor relax against a glass railing]
VETERAN GUARD
[with a drawl] Now, I know that this is your first day on the job of mall security, rookie. Keepin' the law in a mall is just like any tough city, and especially because they don't let us have guns. It can be very dangerous.
CARTMAN
[leading the band members through the mall] Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up!
VETERAN GUARD
[blocking the way to Mall Management] Excuse me, just where do you think you're goin'?
CARTMAN
We're goin' to see the mall manager.
VETERAN GUARD
Do you have the proper clearance?
STAN
[to Kyle] Uh oh, mall cops.
VETERAN GUARD
You have to make an appointment first. Now move along, sir.
CARTMAN
[pleading] But we practiced for days. All we want to do is show the guy what we can do, [the veteran guard pulls out a small bottle of pepper spray and shakes it up] so that maybe we'll have a chance to perform in the plaza of the-- [the veteran guard sprays his face all over] Aagh! Aagh! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-dammit..! [squeezes his eyes shut and rubs them]
KYLE
Jesus Christ!
CARTMAN
Oh, God, I can't see! [rubs his eyes]
VETERAN GUARD
Move along, sir. Or I'll do it again. [Cartman walks off and the others join him. Stan retrieves the boom box. Then] You see, you put your life on the line every day.
STAN
Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager.
CARTMAN
[coughs a few times] The hell we can't! I'm not lettin' no washed-up law cops ruin my divine quest! Come on! [all join him down the mall]
[South Park Mall, later. The two guards are watching shoppers move along. A blond man with two bags walks by.]
VETERAN GUARD
Ey! [the man turns to look at him] What are you doin'?
MAN
Nothin'. Just... shopping.
VETERAN GUARD
Move along, sir. [the man leaves and the veteran looks at the rookie] You see, sometimes you gotta just do that. Keeps shoppers on their toes — try it. [the rookie gets determined and a woman and girl walk by]
ROOKIE GUARD
Ey! [they turn to look at him] What are you doin'?
WOMAN
Nothing. Why?
ROOKIE GUARD
Move along, ma'am. [she leaves looking angry]
VETERAN GUARD
That's what being a mall cop is all about. Hyeuup.
ROOKIE GUARD
Cool.
CARTMAN
[over the PA system] Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimentary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up. [crowds rush off to get their Nissans]
VETERAN GUARD
Jesus, they're gonna start a riot! [both cops follow the crowd while Cartman and friends return to the mall manager's office]
CARTMAN
Alright, guys, here we go. [enters the office with the others] Hello, sir!
MANAGER
[a harried man who's speech is nearly emotionless with odd exclamations] What? Hey. Who are you? [the office is a bit unkempt. Stacks of paper here and there, hanging out of cabinet drawers, scraps on the floor and desk...]
CARTMAN
We... are Fingerbang!
MANAGER
O-o-oh. What? How'd you get in here? Hey.
CARTMAN
We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall.
MANAGER
What? O-oh. You wanna play at the mall? Like Tiffany?
CARTMAN
Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition?
MANAGER
Oh. Well, I guess. ...What?
CARTMAN
Alright! Let's do it, boys! [moves aside and sets the boom box down, then sets the tape to play. He returns to the group, and they begin. All of them are all off-key, They all sing too ahead of the music and Wendy's voice is squeaky and lags behind the others...]
FINGERBANG
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright
I'm goin' to fingerbang-bang you ever-y night
CARTMAN
[goes into his solo, and back into his dream]
And girl you know you're cool, you're good, you're so much nicer, girl
You're good, You're gonna be--
MANAGER
[cuts him off] Alright, that's enough!
CARTMAN
--you're my fantasy, you fanta--
MANAGER
Thank you.
CARTMAN
[backs up into the band] Well, so can we play here?
MANAGER
What?? ...No.
CARTMAN
No??
MANAGER
Who?? No!
CARTMAN
Why not?!
MANAGER
Well uh, uh, oh... Right now there's a cheese and sausage cart in the plaza. And I would uh, I'd hate to have to move it off to the side for a while. What?
CARTMAN
You don't think we're any good, do you?!
MANAGER
No. I mean, you're just not as good as sausage and cheese.
CARTMAN
Well, come on guys. We gave it our best. [goes to get his boom box]
MANAGER
Wow. That was your best? [Cartman flashes an angry look at him, then walks off in a huff.]
[South Park Mall, later. The five are sitting on a bench on the first floor]
KYLE
Wow. I feel so rejected.
STAN
Yeah.
VETERAN GUARD
There you are! You're the hoodlums who got on the intercom and started an orange smoothie riot!
STAN
Uh-oh.
VETERAN GUARD
I will now read you your mall rights! You have the right to shop at a variety of malls in all--
KYLE
Run for it! [the five bolt and rush out of there]
VETERAN GUARD
Go get 'em, rookie! [gives the rookie a stern look; the rookie just looks back]
[Stan's house, later. Shelly's eating cereal, Sharon is at the sink. Randy enters]
RANDY
Where is Stan?
SHARON
Oh, he's over at Eric's house practicing for his boy band.
RANDY
What?! I specifically told him not to do that!
SHARON
Now, Randy, calm down. It's just a silly little dream. They're not gonna actually make it.
RANDY
And what if they do make it, Sharon? What if they do make it? Are you gonna be the one to tell 'im?! [turns around and walks out]
SHELLY
Mom, what's up Dad's ass?
SHARON
It's a long story, Shelly. Let's just say your father... has a lot up his ass right now.
[Chef's house. Cartman arrives and rings the bell]
CHEF
[opens the door and appears in a towel around his waist] Oh! Oh-h, hello Eric.
CARTMAN
[eyes downcast] Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems.
CHEF
Wellll, if you uhhh, come back in just a little bit, Eric, I'll see if I can help you out. [a blonde woman comes up behind Chef]
CARTMAN
I just don't know what I'm gonna do. [lets himself in] Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me. [goes to the sofa and pulls out some Cheesy Poofs to eat]
CHEF
[sits next to Cartman] Alright, Eric, what's the matter?
CARTMAN
Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean, [with feeling] I feel the music burning inside me. But I just can't express it right, you know? [the woman sits on Chef's left side and strokes his arm]
CHEF
Well, Eric, I, I think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy bands aren't about music, boy bands are created by corporations to make money. They're all based on the Gomlich effect.
CARTMAN
What's the Gomlich effect?
CHEF
The law of physics that states, "If one girl screams for something, it will make other girls scream. And then, it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming."
CARTMAN
So how do boy bands use that?
CHEF
All they do is make videos, showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band. Once you get girls screaming, you can't stop 'em. They're crazy! [the blonde gets cross and scoots away; Chef quickly makes amends] Uh-uh, except for Lillith, of course. [she goes sweet on him again]
CARTMAN
Thanks!
CHEF
You're welcome. Now, go away!
CARTMAN
Okay. [Chef watches as Cartman drops down and heads for the front door, exits...]
CHEF
A-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either!
CARTMAN
[outside] Cucumber in the pants. Got it. [and closes the door]
[South Park Elementary, playground, day. Nine kids are there: the five band members and the four other girls in class. Cartman is talking to Bebe, Red, Annie, and Milly. He seems to have taken Chef's advice...]
CARTMAN
Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, "Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!" Okay?
BEBE
Are we gonna get paid now, or after?
CARTMAN
I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera. [Timmy sits in the cameraman's chair]
TIMMY
Tiimmmaaayyy! [Cartman inches his way to the group sideways]
KYLE
Dude, what's wrong with your leg?
CARTMAN
Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck. [the band walks across the ground in front of the girls]
GIRLS
[ad lib] Ahhh. Wow. Woohoo. Yay.
CARTMAN
Waitwaitwaitwait, cut!
TIMMY
Huhaaaaah!
CARTMAN
Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio!
BEBE
We wouldn't give a rat's ass if Leonardo DiCaprio came walking past us.
OTHER GIRLS (RED, ANNIE, AND MILLY)
Yeah.
CARTMAN
Fine! Who would you go crazy for?
GIRLS
...Matt Lauer.
CARTMAN
...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer.
BEBE
Oh... Okay. [Cartman positions himself in front of them]
CARTMAN
Roll camera!
TIMMY
Timmuh! [the band tries again]
GIRLS
AAAGGGGHHH! [the band scatters away from the screaming. Cartman falls, then gets up]
CARTMAN
Jesus Christ!
[South Park Elementary, playground, later. The band is still shooting the video. Bebe and Red hug Cartman tightly.]
FINGERBANG
Fingerbang-bang you ever-y night
CARTMAN
Aaand cut! [music stops] Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and show him what we've got!
BEBE
Okay, so where's our money?
CARTMAN
Oh uh, Kyle has it. [the girls move to Kyle. Cartman walks away]
RANDY
[arrives] Stanley, what the hell are you doing?
STAN
We are making a music video.
RANDY
You get in the truck right now! [points at it]
STAN
Dad, I was just a--
RANDY
[pointing] Get in the truck! [Stan walks to the truck dejected]
[The road, the Marsh truck. Randy drives Stan home.]
STAN
Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?
RANDY
Stanley, it's just that there's better things you could be doing on a Saturday than singing and dancing. You could be watching TV or, laying in bed.
STAN
Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting.
RANDY
Well, there's plenty of other interesting you can do. Have you ever tried marijuana?
STAN
No.
RANDY
Well, maybe it's time.
STAN
Dad!
[South Park Mall, late morning. The guards relax on the second floor railings. A stooped man with a clear vessel filled with a green substance walks past them]
VETERAN GUARD
Ey! What are you doin'?
MADMAN
I've got a new strain of anthrax that I will soon unleash upon all of North America!
VETERAN GUARD
Move along, sir.
MADMAN
Wuh? [walks away]
CARTMAN
Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. [crowds of mall shoppers head for the orange smoothie machine]
VETERAN GUARD
God dammit! [he and the rookie give chase]
CARTMAN
[enters the manager's office] Hello again!
MANAGER
What? Oh. It's you. I don't like you.
CARTMAN
I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.
MANAGER
Oh. What?
CARTMAN
[retrieves a TV cart with VCR and pops the VCR in. The video pops up] If you would, sir, just watch this and prepare to be wowed! [at first, only the boys' hats are seen, near the play elephants. The camera spins right, then down, and the girls' feet are seen. The camera spins up and left, and finally rests on Timmy]
TIMMY
Timmiihh! [The camera turns left again and catches a glimpse of the girls, then ends up on Cartman, and zooms in on the cucumber]
CARTMAN
Uh, god dammit..! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool. [the camera gets a glimpse of the four girls, then moves off them a second after Cartman appears]
TIMMY
Haaghh. [waves at the camera, then moves his wheelchair back and dances to the music] Timmih, livin' a lie!
CARTMAN
Son of a bitch!
MANAGER
Hey. This video is dumb.
CARTMAN
[dead air on tape] You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease.
MANAGER
Alright alright. What? Well, I guess I can move the sausage and cheese cart off to one side. [gives a warning face] For a little while.
CARTMAN
Really? You will?
MANAGER
Only for twenty minutes, though.
CARTMAN
That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock?
MANAGER
Oh. Okay. [static shows up on the video]
CARTMAN
Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed! [a previous recording is shown:]
MR. MACKEY
Oh, Mrs. Cartman, I've been uh very bad. M'kay? [he's handcuffed against a brick wall. Mrs. Cartman appears as a dominatrix]
LIANE
You have been bad, so you're gonna have to drink from this glass. [points to it, then spreads her legs and pisses into it as he watches]
MR. MACKEY
Oh, yeah, that makes me hot, m'kay? [Cartman is shocked at what he sees; the manager is pleased]
CARTMAN
Aw, Mom!
MANAGER
Wow. What?
[Marsh residence, later. Stan sits on the sofa as Randy paces the floor back and forth]
STAN
It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?
RANDY
Because I said so!
STAN
Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me.
RANDY
Let 'em be pissed off, then!
STAN
I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--
RANDY
No!! [walks over to the china cabinet] NOOO!! [smashes his head through its glass doors, causing the dishes to slide out and break up. Stan looks at him with his mouth hanging open in shock, and Randy stands up, ashamed and shocked at his behavior. He walks back to Stan, then turns away defeated]
STAN
Dad? What the hell is going on?
RANDY
...I was... I was 18 when my high-school men's choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store in Denver. [a flashback starts. A young Randy is at lower left corner of the choir, and the choir begins this song: "Everything will wait / Weave all ye little reins..."] I was just one of fifteen members and I had no idea that a record producer was in the audience. [the audience claps. The producer is in the second row of spectators. The choir members split up and the producer rushes up to Randy]
PRODUCER
Kid, can I talk to you?
RANDY
Uh sure.
PRODUCER
Heh, you were really great up there. Too good for a pissant choir in a pissant mountain town.
RANDY
Ohh, thanks.
PRODUCER
Listen: I'm putting together a rock group. A vocal group called the Ghetto Avenue Boys. I think you would make a perfect member.
RANDY
What? Me? Do you like my singing that much?
PRODUCER
Yeah, I think your mustache is perfect. How would you like to come to New York and start a singing career?
RANDY
Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I--
PRODUCER
Hey, look, if you don't want it, I'll keep looking--
RANDY
[interrupting] No! Wait. I mean, ah-I'll think about it.
PRODUCER
I take it that means yes. Call me in the morning. [slips a business card into Randy's coat pocket and pats it]
RANDY
And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school...
RANDY
[walks by Denver High] See ya. [walks away]
RANDY
...I said good-bye to my girlfriend...
RANDY
See ya. [waves, turns and walks away, leaving a distraught girl with mouth open]
RANDY
...And I left my family.
RANDY
See ya. [gets into his beat-up pale-yellow car and drives off, leaving his parents at the front door]
RANDY
And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn't even know. [the five are recording their first song]
PRODUCER
Take 112!
GHETTO AVENUE BOYS
You've... got... it!
You know you've got... it
[Randy: Girl]
What you've got is it!
RANDY
It's obvious to me, girl
RANDY
The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world. [the song continues as he speaks, and the scene changes from the studio, to a poster, to a concert as the camera leaves the poster]
GHETTO AVENUE BOYS
Shirl! You've... got... it!
It... is what you've got, girl!
What you've got is it!
RANDY
Now, give it to me, 'cause...
RANDY
[more scenes from his glory days] I had everything. A huge house, [the backyard pool: he's resting on an inflatable chaise longue while women surround him] and all the women you can imagine. [nine bikini-clad women are in his bed, and he's rolling back and forth over all of them] And then one day, just as quick as it started...
MR. ALLENS
[the Ghetto Avenue Boys enter to rehearse, but...] Alright, guys, let's take it from the top.
RANDY
Hey, Mr. Allens.
MR. ALLENS
Heh? Woh. Uh... R-Randy.
RANDY
Who are they? [five new guys are in the recording booth]
MR. ALLENS
These are the Avenue Ghetto Street Boys, my... new boy band.
RANDY
But, w-we're still selling records, right?
MR. ALLENS
Look, kid, you're just getting a little... old to be in a boy band.
RANDY
I'm 19.
MR. ALLENS
Get a life, Marsh! [the Ghetto Avenue Boys turn around and walk out the door] Alright, guys, let's take it from the top.
RANDY
They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car...
TOW TRUCK DRIVER
[wearing a "Tacos" hat] See ya. [tows a blue sports car away]
RANDY
...the women all left...
WOMEN
See ya. [the women pour out of bed and leave]
RANDY
...and they took back my house.
RANDY
[gets kicked out of the house] Ugh..! [the producer stands at the French doors]
MR. ALLENS
See ya. [Randy gets up and walks away]
RANDY
The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned.
WOMAN
Hey! Weren't you the guy in that stupid boy band, the Ghetto Avenue Boys?
MAN
Sure, I remember you! [starts mocking] You got it, baby... You got it, baby [he and the others begin to laugh, and it soon gets overwhelming. Randy looks around, scared. The flashback ends]
RANDY
[voice full of emotion] And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about.
STAN
Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.
RANDY
I didn't want you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished every single day that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, "No!" Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world. [Stan is listening] That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley. [bitterness creeps in] It's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops. Now we wander the Earth in disarray—us, New Kids on the Block, the Osmonds... We're all the same. And that... is why you can't go to the mall. [walks off]
STAN
[left with his thoughts] ...Oh-kay.
[South Park Mall, afternoon. Most of Fingerbang is on the plaza stage, peeking out from behind a curtain with the band's name on it. People begin to gather in front of the stage.]
KYLE
Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there. [the band regroups]
CARTMAN
Where the hell is Stan?!
KYLE
He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche.
CARTMAN
I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will have his nuts!
MANAGER
[approaches] Hey. Uh, are you gonna do that thing or what?
CARTMAN
Yes. Yes, sir, any second—we're just waiting on one more member.
MANAGER
Well hurry up. I can't keep the sausage and cheese cart off this spot much longer. [the cart is shown with Swiss cheese and sausage, and a pissed-off vendor]
CARTMAN
Yeah. We'll start right away. [the manager walks away. Cartman turns to Kyle] We'll have to do it without him.
KYLE
Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid!
KENNY
(Yeah!)
CARTMAN
Oh, god-dammit!
[Marsh residence, later. Randy is sitting at the foot of his bed, reading from an issue of Teen Heat dedicated to the band. The camera zooms out from the magazine cover to Randy reading]
STAN
[enters] Dad?
RANDY
Huh? Yeah?
STAN
Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had.
RANDY
[thinks, then lowers the magazine] Come here, Stanley. [Stan approaches and sits next to his dad] Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes.
STAN
Yeah.
RANDY
You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?
STAN
Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.
RANDY
Well, come on. I'll drive you down to the mall.
STAN
Really?
RANDY
Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can do. And then we'll go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this.
STAN
Alright! [father and son get up and leave the bedroom. Randy tosses his magazine aside]
[South Park Mall, afternoon. Everyone is waiting for Fingerbang to sing]
MAN
What's happening here?
WOMAN
I don't know, uh. I guess nothing.
MAN
Hm... Well, let's just walk away then. [man and woman leave]
CARTMAN
God dammit! People are walking away! [drops back behind the curtain]
MANAGER
[arrives again] Alright, kids, uh, that does it. You're gonna have to move and make way for the sausage and cheese cart.
CARTMAN
Just another minute.
MANAGER
Sorry. Get out! [the band members walk sullenly away]
CARTMAN
[stops and looks up] Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard.
WENDY
[rushes up to Cartman and points] What's that? [a grinning Randy and Stan arrive in an elevator]
KYLE
It's Stan! [the other members have returned]
CARTMAN
Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name! [walks off smiling as Stan arrives]
KYLE
Dude, where the hell have you been?!
CARTMAN
[approaches the manager] Sir! We're all here now! Can we go on, please?
MANAGER
Who? Well. Okay, I guess. But hurry up.
CARTMAN
We will! [moves to the front of the stage and addresses the audience] Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to witness the next great boy band of the country! Someday you will all be among those who can say, "I saw Fingerbang when they first performed at some crappy little mall." [the manager takes offense] And so, without further ado, all five members of the...
KENNY
[while Cartman talks] (Uff--!) [an elevator crushes him and Cartman stops. Everyone around, including Cartman, is stunned. The doors open and the occupants exit]
STAN
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
KYLE
You bastards!
CARTMAN
[traumatized] No! He can't be dead!
KYLE
Dude, he's pretty dead.
CARTMAN
No! We were so close!
MANAGER
Alright, that's it, kids. Get out!
CARTMAN
But we have to perform!
KYLE
We don't have a fifth member, Cartman!
STAN
Oh, yes we do.
[South Park Mall, later. The stage is set, the intro begins]
CARTMAN
Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!
FINGERBANG
[the new fifth member: Randy]
Fingerbang!
Bang bang [audience members look at each other]
Fingerbang-bang!
Bangbangbang [people begin to leave]
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright
[Janitors wearing face masks scrape Kenny's remains off the elevator]
'Cause I'm the king of fingerbang; let's not fight
[the veteran mall guard swivels his hips around happily as the rookie looks on]
I'm goin' tuh fingerbang-bang you ever-y night
[Cartman: I'll just...]
Fingerbang-bang you ever-y night!
CARTMAN
Chuh! [only four shoppers remain to clap for them] Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes!
[South Park Mall, later. Janitors continue cleaning the elevator that crushed Kenny, the sausage and cheese cart is rolled back on stage, and Fingerbang sits on the edge of the stage, dropping pieces of their costumes into the pit below]
KYLE
We made two dollars.
STAN
You were great, Dad.
RANDY
Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a little.
LITTLE GIRL
Can I get your autograph?
CARTMAN
Ok-Okay, okay.
VETERAN GUARD
[arrives with the rookie and moves the girl aside] Hey, don't hassle the talent, ma'am.
LITTLE GIRL
[looks at the guard] I actually don't really know who they are, I was just getting an autograph and-- [the veteran guard sprays her with pepper] A-a-agg-g-ggh!
VETERAN GUARD
Move along, ma'am. [the little girl runs off stage] Eh, that was pretty good, kids. Maybe you can come perform at my Elks Club sometime.
CARTMAN
Okay, yeah, maybe. [the mall cops walk away] God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us.
KYLE
Yeah.
CARTMAN
I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', "Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!"
KYLE
...Yeah. That's gonna suck.
STAN
Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.
RANDY
[looks at Stan and pats him on the back] Well, I think you boys are very smart for your age. Come on. I'll buy you all an orange smoothie. [gets up and moves off the stage]
STAN
I don't think they sell those anymore. [gets up and follows his dad off; Wendy gets up and follows him]
KYLE
Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million? [gets up and follows the others off the stage. Cartman gets up and follows him]
CARTMAN
Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy. [the stage is empty now, but Cartman returns and looks up] You know I'm just kiddin', right? Heheyeah. [turns and walks off again]
End of Something You Can Do with Your Finger


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The boys learn in Sunday school that they must confess their sins, but worry about Timmy since all he can say is his own name.

script:Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?

[South Park, the church, day. The congregation is heard singing along with an organ. Inside, the town has assembled for services]
CONGREGATION
I walk hand-in-hand with Jesus
Over at the park by where he lives
I tell him all my problems
[the cantor is shown at the pulpit]
And sometimes he tells me his
What a friend I have in Jesus
[Stan, Kenny, and Cartman are shown]
I can say that honestly
[other townsfolk are shown]
He's not like all my other friends
Who really don't care about me.
Amen.
STAN
[to Kenny] Bo-ring.
CANTOR
And now Mr. Mackey will read his favorite psalm for us, Psalm 46. [steps out of the way]
MR. MACKEY
Uh, God is our refuge and strength, m'kay. A very present help in trouble, m'kay. [Cartman starts talking to Stan and Kenny] Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea...
CARTMAN
[as Mackey speaks] Hey, you guys, you wanna know what my favorite psalm is? "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation. [Stan and Kenny begin to laugh] This sort of penetration will increase the population of the younger generation." [stops]
MR. MACKEY
God is in the midst of her, m'kay. She shall not be moved, m'kay. [Stan resumes conversing with the other two] Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, m'kay, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof, m'kay. There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place- [interrupted by the priest]
STAN
[as Mackey speaks] Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's..."
CARTMAN
"It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation [Stan and Kenny begin to laugh] to increase the population of the younger generation."
KENNY
(It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's operation-)
CARTMAN
No no, no. Separation.
STAN
"It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's-"
PRIEST MAXI
BOYS! You are in CHURCH! [Liane raises her arm and slaps Cartman across the back.]
CARTMAN
[falls off the pew and onto the floor] Ugh!
MR. MACKEY
-m'kay. The God of Jacob is our refuge, m'kay. [walks from the pulpit back to his seat. The priest replaces him]
PRIEST MAXI
Thank you, Mr. Mackey. Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to talk about hell. [an organ swells into a dreadful chord. The boys are afraid] Hell is not a very nice place. Burning, searing, flames. Screaming, torture. For eternity. Once you are in hell, you cannot escape. You live forever in horrible pain, in burning agony. All sinners are there in misery, dying over and over and over. [the camera begins to descend through the floor, past the foundation, several layers of dirt, a sewage pipe...] If you be cast down into this black bog of stench, then woe is thou, [...more layers of dirt and some fossils...] for Satan has made it the most miserable place in the universe! [...and finally, an inferno full of skulls] And he will be your ruler! [the camera stops at this sign: "Welcome to Hell"] Your ruler of pain and agony!
[Hell. Music is heard, and the camera pans right, past this sign: "Don't Forget! IT'S LUAU SUNDAY!!!"]
SINGERS:
Are we going to the Hukilau?
The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau?
[Satan joins them]
Are we going to the Hukilau?
The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau?
[Jerry Garcia is seen]
Everybody loves a hukilau-
GENE SISKEL
I do!
SINGERS
Where the laulau is the kaukau at the luau
[A monster band plays]
We throw our nets out into the sea
[Satan does throw out a net]
And all the ama-ama come swimmin' to me
[two demons retrieve the net, with fish in it]
Are we going to the Hukilau?
The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau?
HULA DANCERS
Are we going to the Hukilau?
MEN
The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau?
HULA DANCERS
Everybody loves a Hukilau,
[a hula dancer's head falls off]
SINGERS
Where the laulau is the kaukau at the luau
[Three other tortured souls watch as Satan and George Burns meet at the spit and Satan roasts the man attached]
ALL
'We throw our nets out into the sea.
[Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin motion for the nets to be dropped]
And all the ama-ama come a-swimming to me
[The demons harvest the catch, Tiny Tim surfs and plays his ukulele]
Are we going to the Hukilau?
[A three-person band of monsters sings and plays, then a group shot of Satan and others]
The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau?
Huki... Luki... Lau?...
[the camera pulls back to show everyone. An Aloha sign appears above.]
SATAN
Yeah!
DEMON
Hennnh! [bites a damned soul]
MAN
Aaawwwwwww! [the others laugh]
GARY
Great luau, Satan.
SATAN
Thanks. See ya, Gary. Thanks for comin'. Oh- Hi, Marsha.
WALTER
Satan, a few of us are gonna go pound some brews. You wanna join us?
SATAN
Oh, I'd love to, Mr. Matthau, but I can't. Chris and I just moved to the west side and we have to unpack.
WALTER
Oh, well, maybe next time. Great luau!
SATAN
Bye.
[Hell, a marina. Boats, yachts, and one big ship are docked on the liquid lava below. A complex of buildings is shown. A woman somewhere screams. At the main entrance the sign reads, "RIVER STYX CONDOMINIUMS. UNITS STILL AVAILABLE." Inside his condo, Satan sets up a ceramic doll display and hums a bit]
SATAN
Chris?
CHRIS
[off-screen] Yeah?
SATAN
Did you, uh, see my "Boy With An Umbrella" Hummel?
CHRIS
Uuh, no, but there's still some boxes coming from the movers.
SATAN
Oh, okay, thanks. [the doorbell rings.] Oh, that must be them now. [goes to answer the door, and opens it] Just put the boxes by the-
SADDAM
Hello, Satan! [opens his arms wide and grins big. He has two suitcases, one on either side of him]
SATAN
[stunned] Saddam...
SADDAM
[cuddly] Did you miss me, buttercup?
SATAN
No, it can't be! You're dead! I killed you!
SADDAM
Yeah, you killed me. So? Where was I gonna go? Detroit?
SATAN
Oh no. [looks up] Oh, God no.
[South Park, the church, day. Priest Maxi finishes his sermon. Fear is shown across the faces of many of the congregants]
PRIEST MAXI
A place of everlasting agony and pain! Hell awaits all sinners and all who do not accept Christ! [Stan grits his teeth, Cartman's jaw drops, Kenny trembles a little] Children in this town have not been attending Sunday school after Mass! And adults have not been coming to Confession! If this does not change, I promise you, you will be going to the black pit of Satan's world! [Cartman grits his teeth] That is all. Peace be with you. [congregants rise and file out of church. Randy and Sharon Marsh are the last two adults out]
RANDY
Well, that was quite an uplifting sermon.
SHARON
Yeah. [Stan, Cartman, and Kenny run up to them from behind]
STAN
Mom, wuh we're staying for Sunday school.
SHARON
[she, Liane, and Randy spin around] What?
STAN
We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn! [turns around, runs to the altar, and turns right. Kenny follows him]
CARTMAN
Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom. [runs out after the other two.]
RANDY
Oh, now look at that. They're scared to death.
PRIEST MAXI
[comes up behind them] Hell is a very real place, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. I'm trying to save their souls and the souls of everyone in this town from the wretched lake of fire!
[The wretched lake of fire — I mean, Hell, the River Styx Condominiums, Satan's front door. Satan has taken refuge behind the door and peeks out]
SADDAM
Come on, guy. Just let me in so we can talk.
SATAN
I don't want to talk to you, Saddam! This isn't what I need in my life right now.
CHRIS
[peeks out from another room] Is that the movers, Satan?
SATAN
[hides his disdain] Ah. Yeah. Yeah, it's just the movers
CHRIS
Oh, well, tell them I'm leavin' their check on the counter. [disappears]
SATAN
Okay, Chris.
SADDAM
Satan, look: I know our relationship wasn't perfect. Okay? I know that. I was too busy tryin' to take over the world to give you what you needed. But I've changed, Satan. [flashes his charm]
SATAN
[sarcastically] Oh, why, I haven't heard that one before.
SADDAM
COME ON, can't we just go out for a burrito? [Satan thinks about it. Saddam appears dressed for a fiesta and shakes the maracas around] ¡Me gusta burrito mucho!
SATAN
I can't, Saddam. I'm with Chris now.
SADDAM
Who?? Screw 'im! He can't pound your ass like I can!
SATAN
Good-bye, Saddam!
SADDAM
Wait. Wait, I'm sorry, heh. But Satan, you can't deny what's between us. [pats his hair] You can try, but you know we belong together.
SATAN
My life is good now, Saddam. Chris treats me well. You and I are through. Good-bye. [closes the door, sighs, and walks off to his left, past a window]
SADDAM
[pops up outside the window] Hey, come on, guy! Give me a break! [Satan looks, then lowers the blinds, and continues walking]
[South Park, the church, day. Sunday school is in session, apparently at the church basement. A nun and eleven children sit around a table. Clockwise: the nun, a blonde girl, Clyde, Butters, Tolkien, Kenny, Stan, Cartman, Pip, Bebe, Tweek, and a blond boy. A Twister game in on one side of the room, a bicycle on the other]
NUN
Hello, children. I'm Sister Anne. And I'll be teaching you so that you can all receive your First Communion.
STAN
[quite afraid] Are we gonna go to hell?
SISTER ANNE
Well, hopefully not. That's why you're gonna need to receive Communion.
CARTMAN
A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe?
STAN
What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.
CARTMAN
Yeah, what if we haven't?
SISTER ANNE
It doesn't matter, because we are all born with Original Sin. Now, let me explain how Communion works. [brings out a golden dish with round wafers on it] The priest will give you this round cracker, [lifts up and displays a wafer] and he will say, "The Body of Christ," and then you eat it. [silence]
CARTMAN
Jesus was made of crackers?
SISTER ANNE
No.
STAN
But crackers are his- body.
SISTER ANNE
Yes.
KENNY
[thinks a while, then] (What?!)
SISTER ANNE
In the Book of Mark, Jesus distributed bread and said, "eat this, for it is my body."
CARTMAN
So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.
SISTER ANNE
Nononono!
BUTTERS
Uhwell, uhwhat are we eatin' then?
SISTER ANNE
The Body of Christ! [confused faces all around]
STAN
Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him.
SISTER ANNE
No!
STAN
No??
BUTTERS
Huh-I can't whistle if I eat too many crackers.
SISTER ANNE
Look: all you have to know is that when the priest gives you the cracker, you eat it! Okay?!
KENNY, STAN, CARTMAN
O-kay.
SISTER ANNE
And then, you will drink a very small amount of wine, for that, is the Blood of Christ.
CARTMAN
[unconvinced, closes his Bible] Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly! [rests his head on his left hand]
SISTER ANNE
Eric, do you wanna go to hell?!
CARTMAN
[startled] Nno!
SISTER ANNE
Then stop questioning me.
CARTMAN
But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?
SISTER ANNE
No. Because before you can take your first Communion, you have to have your first Confession.
STAN
Confession? [Kenny snaps to attention, jarring music plays in the background]
SISTER ANNE
You'll be getting in the Confession box with a priest and confessing all your sins, so that God can forgive you. You kids will all have to go to your first Confession this Tuesday, so I want you all to go home tonight and think long and hard about all your sins, so that you can tell the priest everything. [All the kids look towards Stan Kenny and Cartman, who's faces are stricken with fear]
KENNY
(OH, SHIT!)
[Hell, the River Styx Condominiums, Satan's kitchen. He and Chris are washing dishes. He soaks, Chris rinses]
CHRIS
Those were some great pork chops, Satan.
SATAN
Yeah.
CHRIS
Hey, you. [puts a dish away] You've been actin' strange all night. What's up?
SATAN
[jittery] Nothing. Why?
CHRIS
Well, it's... just that you've washed that same dish seven times now, silly.
SATAN
[sheepish] Oh, huh. Sorry, huh-huh. [holds a plate in his hands, then gives it to Chris]
CHRIS
[puts it away] Come on, Satan. You know you can tell me anything. What's up?
SATAN
Well, Chris, Saddam showed up today.
CHRIS
[stung] Oh. [thinks] Woww! [sighs] I wasn't ready for that.
SATAN
He showed up spouting all kinds of things about how he's changed and he still loves me...
CHRIS
I thought you... killed him.
SATAN
Yeah, well, where was he gonna go? Detroit?
CHRIS
...Do you still love him?
SATAN
No, Chris.
CHRIS
It's okay of you do.
SATAN
Well, I mean- [sighs] Of course, there's a part of me that will always love him, I... But I also know how abusive he was—I'm much happier with you.
CHRIS
Well, you know what I think we should do? I think we should all get together and just talk, like adults.
SATAN
What?
CHRIS
We're all grown men here, Satan. I wanna just go meet this guy.
SATAN
No, Chris, you don't understand. Saddam is fucking crazy.
CHRIS
Oh, I know he's got the whole bad-boy thing going. But I think that's what you were attracted to. But I can be a pretty rough tumbler myself. [tosses a plate into the air. It falls onto the floor and breaks up, startling him] Oops! [bends down to pick up the pieces.] Aw, butternuts! [Satan just glances away]
[South Park, curbside. Stan, Cartman, and Kenny are seated there. Cartman has pen and notebook in hand]
STAN
Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days.
CARTMAN
Oh yeah, okay.
STAN
And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.
CARTMAN
Right, I already got that one.
KYLE
[stops by] Hey, dudes. What are you doin'?
STAN
We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.
KYLE
Uhwuwhat?
STAN
Have you confessed all your sins yet?
KYLE
No-o-o-o-o!
CARTMAN
Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins.
KYLE
Oh good. I don't?
CARTMAN
No, you're already going to hell.
KYLE
I am not!
CARTMAN
You are, too!
STAN
Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period.
KYLE
I'm gonna go ask my mom! [walks away]
STAN
Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?
CARTMAN
Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault.
KENNY
(What?)
BUTTERS
[rushes in with Timmy and Tolkien] Eyou guys! Eyou guys! Uh we just thought of somethin'!
STAN
What, Butters?
BUTTERS
Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped kid, uh-Timmy?
TIMMY
Timmiih!
CARTMAN
What'd we do to Timmy?
BUTTERS
No! I mean, poor Timmy's gonna go to hell! He can't confess his sins, 'cause all he can say is his name!
TIMMY
Timmiih!
CARTMAN
Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed.
STAN
Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something.
KENNY
(What are we gonna do?)
STAN
I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do.
[Hell. Satan sits on a boulder with four demons and a small monster off to his left]
SATAN
[pensive] I don't know what I'm gonna do. I can't deny my feelings for Saddam, but... my life is so much better now with Chris. [the monster gives him some commentary in gibberish] Yeah. It's like Chris is so perfect in every way, but there's just something about Saddam that I'm more attracted to. [the monster makes a suggestion] In what way? [the monster tells him] Yeah, you're right. Saddam would just treat me bad again. I'm just gonna have to not see Saddam. Put him out of my mind and focus on Chris. If I don't see Saddam, then I won't have such strong feelings for him. Thanks guys. [turns right to walk away]
CHRIS
[arrives] There you are.
SATAN
[turns right] Oh hi, Chris!
CHRIS
I've been lookin' all over for you. I have to tell you somethin' that might make you... a little mad.
SATAN
What?
CHRIS
Well, I called Saddam Hussein and invited him over for dinner tonight.
SATAN
You WHAT?!
CHRIS
I just think we all need to get this out in the open.
SATAN
Oh, Chris! Rraarr! [raises his arms in fury and points his right hand away. Lightning comes out from his index finger and scorches a tree.] Rraahh! [points his left hand away. Lightning comes out from his index finger and scorches the aboriginal monster he was talking with earlier.]
CHRIS
[walks up to Satan] Come on, Satan. We're all adults here. He was an important person in your life, for better or for worse. So, I wanna know him. If he sees that I'ma real person too, then... well, maybe he'll see how happy we are together.
SATAN
No, Chris! He'll try to kill you is what he'll do!
CHRIS
Satan, we're not in junior high school anymore.
SATAN
[incredulous] Oh, dear God. [slaps his hand to his face]
[South Park, the church. Stan sits on a bench praying. A confession box stands nearby with two doors, one of which is open. Apparently, he's already confessed his sins.]
STAN
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-
CARTMAN
[approaches] How was it?
STAN
Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up!
CARTMAN
Huh?
STAN
The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.
CARTMAN
Who's in there?
STAN
I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.
CARTMAN
Well, here goes everything. [walks to the penitent side of the confession box and enters.]
[The confessional, inside. Cartman sits and faces the partition.]
CARTMAN
[hesitantly] Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
PRIEST MAXI
[in the confessor's side] Blessed art thou, child. Now, what do you have to confess?
CARTMAN
Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass...
[The church, inside, next to the confessional. Stan continues his prayers]
STAN
...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble-
KENNY
[arrives] (Hey, dude.)
STAN
God damnit!
KENNY
(What??)
STAN
[notices someone and points] Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy. [he and Kenny walk over to her. She's kneeling before a table of candles and a portrait of Jesus] Sister Anne?
SISTER ANNE
Oh, hello, children.
STAN
We have a question.
SISTER ANNE
[rises] Okay, shoot.
STAN
Where do handicapped people go when they die?
SISTER ANNE
[thinks a moment, then] The handicapped are just people like you and me, so the same rules apply. They need to be baptized, take Communion, and confess their sins.
STAN
But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?
SISTER ANNE
Uugh. This really isn't a question for me, it's for the priest. [begins to hurry away] I'll see if I can find him. Bye. [Stan and Kenny look at each other]
[The confessional, inside. Cartman goes through his extensive list of sins]
CARTMAN
And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?
PRIEST MAXI
Your [clears his throat] con- confession does not leave this box.
CARTMAN
Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating.
PRIEST MAXI
[guarded] Oh. Well, Uh arr-I'm sure he would forgive you if he knew.
CARTMAN
No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it. [Cartman looks up for a response, but nothing happens]
PRIEST MAXI
[after a pause] I... see.
CARTMAN
Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week. [the priest grows more concerned and his jaw drops] And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told Officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog. [Priest Maxi's worry has turned to anger he's trying to contain] And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of- [an arm tears through the partition and grabs Cartman by the throat] -eh- Ow! [throttles him back and forth] D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow! [the priest pulls him up into the partition a few times] Eh! Oh! Help. [The confession box rocks back and forth] Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!
SISTER ANNE
[arrives and knocks on the priest's door as Cartman screams] Father! I need to talk to you. Father! [an angry Priest Maxi exits the box] I have to ask you a question.
PRIEST MAXI
Okayokay, fine! [walks away with Sister Anne]
CARTMAN
[the door opens and he falls to the floor] Uh-huh- [Stan and Kenny rush up] Oho! Ohoho.
STAN
What happened??
CARTMAN
I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God. [Stan and Kenny get afraid] He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously.
[Hell, River Styx Condominiums. The doorbell rings at Satan and Chris's condo. Chris walks to the door and opens it]
CHRIS
Oh, hello. You must be Saddam Hussein.
SADDAM
And you must be Mr. Assface. [cocks his head in an open grin] Just kidding. You're Chris, right? Thanks for inviting me to dinner, guy. [reaches into his coat] Here, I brought you a potato. [hands him a baked potato still wrapped in aluminum foil]
CHRIS
[takes the potato] Oh, thank you.
SATAN
[sees this and rushes up to Chris] Chris, no! It's a bomb! [takes the potato and chucks it clear of the condo]
CHRIS
Satan, what the heck is wrong with you?
SADDAM
Yeah! Hey, relax, guy. We're all here to act like adults, right? [the potato explodes in a manner that reveals it was a bomb after all] Oh, gee. I guess I must've overcooked it. [chuckles]
CHRIS
Well, come on in. Dinner's just about ready.
[The Broflovski house, day. Sheila and Gerald sit on the living room sofa, and Ike reads from a book between them]
IKE
behayin' glah, and the he find de eye. [reads from "Cannery Row" by John Steinbeck]
GERALD
Very good, Ike. That's two John Steinbeck books in one day.
IKE
Cookie monstooh.
SHEILA
[affectionately] Oh, he's growing up so fast! [a door opens and closes]
KYLE
[rushes into the room] Mom! Dad! Am I gong to hell?
SHEILA
Why? What did you do, Kyle?!
KYLE
Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell.
SHEILA
Oh noooo, that's just Catholics. Us Jews don't believe in hell.
KYLE
We don't? But what if we're wrong?
SHEILA
Well..., Kyle..., they could be wrong, too.
KYLE
Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If we're wrong, we burn in hell.
IKE
Oh, no.
GERALD
Kyle, it's all about being a good person now! You see, Christians use hell as a way to scare people into believing what they believe. But to believe in something just because you're afraid of the consequences if you don't believe in something is no reason to believe in something. Understand?
IKE
No-o-o.
KYLE
Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me! [goes up to him and takes him away towards the front door. The book falls to the floor]
SHEILA
Kyle!
[Hell, River Styx Condominiums. Dinner has been served. Saddam, Satan, and Chris sit at a round table, eating. Satan sits between the other two.]
CHRIS
So Saddam. Satan told me all about how you guys almost took over the world once.
SADDAM
Hn-yeah, those were the days, boy. What the hell is this crap we're eating, anyway?
SATAN
It's all vegetarian, Saddam. Chris was a nutritionist before he died.
SADDAM
Oh, isn't that fascinating. So, tell me, Chris. How is it that you died?
CHRIS
Oh, well I, I actually slipped down an escalator, in a mall. Those things can be pretty sketchy.
SADDAM
An escalator? What kind of pussy way of dying is that?!
CHRIS
L-look, Saddam, I know that you and Satan had a relationship [Saddam reaches down to stroke Satan's right leg] And I just want you to know [Satan swats Saddam's arm away] that I'm totally okay with you guys staying friends.
SADDAM
Uh huh.
CHRIS
I think it's important to stay friends with people you've had relationships with. [Saddam tries twice more with Satan, but Satan keeps swatting Saddam's arm off] And I know that Satan and my relationship is strong enough that it can handle anything. [looks up to Satan] Right? [a tormented Satan looks down at a grinning Saddam, who is still stroking his leg] Right.
[The church, day. The rectory. Sister Anne, Stan, Cartman, and Kenny wait for Priest Maxi at his desk. On one side of the desk is a tray with holders that say, "The LORD Giveth" and "The LORD Taketh"]
SISTER ANNE
Father, the children asked me about their handicapped friend. I wanna explain to them that he's fine.
PRIEST MAXI
Well, has your friend ever confessed or been baptized?
STAN
I don't think so.
PRIEST MAXI
Then, hell awaits him.
SISTER ANNE
Father, these boys are really worried because they think they have to-
PRIEST MAXI
They SHOULD be worried! Boys, it is your Christian duty to save the souls of your friends!
SISTER ANNE
Yes, but-
KYLE
[rushes in with Ike in tow] Mister Father! [Sister Anne looks back at him] We have to ask you something.
PRIEST MAXI
Oh. You're the little Jewish boy, right?
KYLE
Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?
PRIEST MAXI
Well, young man, you can rest assured that according to Matthew 25, when you die you will stand before God and he will will say, "Depart from me, you cursèd, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels." Yes! As a Jew, your home will be the lake of fire.
IKE
[hiding behind a frightened Kyle] Oh no.
SISTER ANNE
Father-
PRIEST MAXI
I hope to see all of you in church this Sunday.
STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN, KENNY
We will be. [the boys turn and walk out with Ike. Priest Maxi gloats]
SISTER ANNE
[concerned] Father, I don't know if I agree fully with what you're saying. I think that as long as Jewish people are good, they will get into heaven.
PRIEST MAXI
Sister, the Jews crucified our Savior. I mean, if you don't go to hell for crucifying the Savior, then what the hell do you go to hell for?!
[The church, day. The boys stand in front of the candle table Sister Anne prayed at earlier]
KYLE
[breathless] Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. Please.
STAN
Alrightalrightalright. You heard the priest: the first thing we have to do is get you guys all baptized. Come on. [the boys exit]
[Cartman's house, day. Timmy, Kyle, and Ike stand in a row as a hose splashes on each one for a few seconds. Cartman is the one doing the spraying while Stan and Kenny watch from the steps]
STAN
Okay, you'd better baptize Kyle some more.
CARTMAN
[points the hose at Kyle] Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh!
KYLE
HAAAAH!
CARTMAN
Turn around so I can clean out your ass.
STAN
Cartman!
CARTMAN
What?
STAN
Dude, you just said "ass"! That's a sin!
CARTMAN
Oh, now you've said it, too!
STAN
Oh, shit! [covers his mouth with his gloves.] Oh!
KENNY
(Fuck! Oops!) [covers his own mouth]
CARTMAN
Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again.
STAN
But what about them?
CARTMAN
Ugh. Oh, I know. [runs away, but returns with an attachment] We can use Wacky Water Weasel! [sets everything up, and the Weasel sets to work spraying Timmy, Kyle, and Ike.]
TIMMY
Haaaaah!
STAN
Okay, come on. [he, Cartman, and Kenny leave]
TIMMY
Haaa-ay, Timmmiih!
[Hell, River Styx Condominiums. Dinner is over. Chris collects the dishes]
CHRIS
Hoof. Well, I don't know about you guys, but all that ginger made me tired.
SADDAM
Yes. I guess I should be gettin' back. [leaves the table]
SATAN
Good. I'll show you out.
CHRIS
Nice to meet you, Saddam! Have a safe walk back!
SADDAM
Yeah. Thanks for the weak grass and twigs and stuff. [Satan shows him out; he faces Satan] Satan, that guy is a pussy!
SATAN
He's stable, Saddam!
SADDAM
Yes, that's what I said! He's a pussy!
SATAN
Having stability in your life is a great thing! You should try it!
SADDAM
For some people, maybe. But you like excitement. I know you, Satan. [grins]
SATAN
I'm very happy with my life now.
SADDAM
Here. [slips a key into Satan's hand] I'm at the bargain hotel on Monte Vista. Room 16.
SATAN
No, Saddam! I won't be needing this!
SADDAM
D'oh, I know you won't. But just keep it, just in case. It was good seeing you again, Satan. Goodnight. [to Chris, still inside the condo] Goodnight, pussy! I mean, Chris!
CHRIS
[off screen] Goodnight [Satan looks torn]
[Rome, St. Peter's Square. A phone rings somewhere and someone answers]
VOICE
Hello. Your Excellency? [the scene switches to the church in South Park. The voice is Sister Anne's] This is Sister Anne, the Bleeding Eyes of Jesus, calling from the United States?
SECRETARY
Yes, I understand you want to speak-a wit the pope.
SISTER ANNE
Yes. The priest here has been telling the children some pretty radical things, and I just wanted to see what the Church thinks about Jews and the mentally handicapped.
SECRETARY
Yes, well the pope is here, but please keep it brief. He is a-very old. [the secretary hands the phone over to the pope, who is seated in a throne inside a tiny temple at one end of the cathedral]
THE POPE
Heh??
SISTER ANNE
Hello, His Holiness. I want to ask you about people with mental disabilities.
THE POPE
Heh?
SISTER ANNE
Do mentally-challenged people go to hell?
THE POPE
[soft] Ehhhhh, what's that you say? [loud] Heh?!
SISTER ANNE
[enunciates] Handicap. Mental handicap.
THE POPE
[flaps his lips around with his tongue] Fibibiibibibibiibibih.
SISTER ANNE
[waits, then] ...The priest here said that people with mental handicaps might end up in hell. Is that true?
THE POPE
[snores, then] Eh-bibibiibibibibiibibibih. [Sister Anne says nothing.]
[South Park Avenue, day. Stan, Cartman, and Kenny are at a crosswalk waiting for the light to turn green]
STAN
Come on! This stupid light won't change.
TOLKIEN
[arrives, followed by Butters, Clyde, and Bebe] Come on! Hurry up! [sees the other three boys] Hey, what are you guys doin'?
STAN
We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again.
BUTTERS
Uh us too. Uh we saw a picture of a naked lady. We could see her whole beaver.
CLYDE
Yeah. If we died right now, we'd have unclean souls and we'd burn in hell. [the crosswalk light turns green]
STAN
Uh, come on, let's go. [the kids begin to cross the street, Kenny first, but...]
KENNY
(Yow!) [a tour bus slams into Kenny and takes him away. The other kids freeze where they are, petrified]
STAN
[finally reacts, shrilly] ...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
BUTTERS
He had sins that he didn't confess!
CARTMAN
And he never took Communion!
STAN
He's doomed.
CLYDE
...We've gotta get to that church before we die.
CARTMAN
Yeah. [the kids make their way slowly across the street]
[Hell, River Styx Condominiums, night. Satan and Chris are in bed in the dark. Chris is trying to arouse Satan, but Satan doesn't move]
CHRIS
[grabbing Satan's privates] Yeah. [moves up to Satan's left shoulder] That's hot. [then to the right one] You take it! [Satan turns on the lights as Chris makes his way down to his crotch] You take it now!
SATAN
Chris, what are you doing?
CHRIS
I'm just... I'm just trying to be a little more naughty in bed. I uh... I know that's what you like about sex with Saddam. I'm just... showin' you that I can be that way, too.
SATAN
Oh boy.
CHRIS
[resumes his naughtiness] Uh huh. Yeah. You like that, don't you, bitch? [Satan begins to grimace] I'm a bad boy. Yeah. Take that.
SATAN
Chris, just... don't... don't do that.
CHRIS
But it turns you on.
SATAN
No, it's a- When Saddam did it, yeah, but uh...
CHRIS
But what?
SATAN
Nothing. I just- I'm just- really tired is all. Can we- just, please go to sleep? [Chris looks let down] Chris, seriously. I'm just tired, okay?
CHRIS
[closes his eyes] Okay. I love you, Satan.
SATAN
I love you too, Saddam.
SATAN, CHRIS
[immediately react] Wuh?!
SATAN
Waw. Uhuh. I'm sorry, I mean, Chris. [grimaces]
CHRIS
It's okay. It's okay. I, uh, I, I understand. ...I do.
SATAN
I just need to go get some air. okay? I'll be back... really quick. [gets out of bed and leaves]
CHRIS
Yeah. Sure. Okay.
[South Park, the church, day. The kids race towards the church]
CARTMAN
Come on, hurry up! [Stan reaches the door]
STAN
[tries to open it] Oh no! It's locked!
CARTMAN
[moves in and tries to open it] What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die!
BUTTERS
Hey, there's a window in the back that's usually open. [the kids go around to the back of the church, find the window, and climb in]
STAN
[sees something off to the side] Confession box is over there! [moves towards it]
CARTMAN
I'm first, I'm first! [trips Tolkien and runs past Stan. Tolkien quickly gets up and walks with the others. Cartman opens the penitent door and sees a woman with her exposed ass up against the partition]
WOMAN
Oh, huhuh.
CARTMAN
[closes the door] What the? [opens the priest's door. Priest Maxi, in a sexual act with the woman on the other side, looks out and grins. The kids look back in horror, and his face changes]
PRIEST MAXI
Whoa! [turns and faces the partition while zipping up his pants] Son of a bitch!
WOMAN
[flits out of the penitent side] Eh, heheheheheheh.
PRIEST MAXI
[exits] Uhuh. Kids, uh.
STAN
You're a sinner!
CARTMAN
You're doing unnatural things in the house of God!
PRIEST MAXI
Oh! Huh huh. Huh huh. [drops to his knees and prays] Oh, forgive me, heavenly Father! I've sinned against you!
CARTMAN
Oh, this guy is so gonna burn!
PRIEST MAXI
M-Mrs. Donovan is a temptress from hell! [begins to weep]
STAN
Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
CARTMAN
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves!
[Hell. Satan walks down its streets]
DAMNED SOUL
Oh, the pain! Oh, the pain! [Satan stops and looks at the key Saddam gave him. The handle looks like a coffin]
SATAN
[lowers the key] No, I can't. [in front of him is the Bargain Hotel] What am I doing? I know this is the wrong thing to do. I could lose Chris. I can't do this. [turns around and walks away] I can't do this. [stops and turns back]
[South Park, day. A street corner. Cartman holds court on a soapbox. At least 17 other kids surround him. Some adults look at the action from across the street]
CARTMAN
We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh! [Chef and Mr. Garrison arrive] If thy hand offend thee, cut it off! [Stan's parents and the nun are there] It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed-
RANDY
Oh, what the hell are they doing now?!
CARTMAN

SISTER ANNE
[steps up] Oh no.
CARTMAN

STAN
[passes out material] Pamphlet. Pamphlet. [from a child's view, the pamphlet is seen. It's called "Kids Against Hell" and has a quote from Ezekiel 5:10. It is soon lowered for a good shot at the growing crowd of kids at the street corner]
CARTMAN
There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew!
HEIDI
I don't wanna to go to hell. [joins the kids, leaving her parents stunned]
CARTMAN
It will be a long road, but at the end of that road is Salvation! And I am going to lead you there!
[End of Do The Handicapped Go To Hell? — To Be Continued...]
End of Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?

synopsis:Cartman's flock begins to grow and the children begin plans to build him a Church. Meanwhile, Satan turns to God for advice.

script:Probably

['Recap:
Priest Maxi is shown at the church podium before the congregation]
ANNOUNCER
Previously on South Park...
PRIEST MAXI
Today, we are going to talk about hell. [an organ swells into a dreadful chord. The boys are afraid]
[Hell, River Styx Condominiums. Saddam appears at Satan's door]
SADDAM
Hello, Satan! [opens his arms wide and grins big. He has two suitcases, one on either side of him]
SATAN
[stunned] Saddam...
[Broflovski residence. Sheila and Kyle are talking]
SHEILA
Us Jews don't believe in hell.
KYLE
But what if we're wrong?
[South Park Avenue, day. The kids begin crossing the street]
STAN
Let's go. [the kids begin to cross the street, Kenny first, but a tour bus slams into Kenny and takes him away. The other kids freeze where they are, petrified]
STAN
[finally reacts, shrilly] ...they've killed Kenny!
BUTTERS
He had sins that he didn't confess!
[Hell, River Styx Condominiums, dinner. Saddam tries to arouse Satan under the table. Satan swats Saddam's arm away]
SATAN
No, Saddam, I told you. I'm with Chris now.
[Church rectory. Priest Maxi is talking to the boys]
PRIEST MAXI
Boys, it is your Christian duty to save the souls of your friends!
[Hell, River Styx Condominiums, bedtime. Satan and Chris are in bed]
CHRIS
[closes his eyes] I love you, Satan.
SATAN
I love you too, Saddam.
SATAN/CHRIS
[immediately react] Wuh?!
[Pacific Ocean. A man drives a speedboat. Richie Cunningham, Ralph Malph, and Potsy Weber go along for the ride, and Arthur Fonzarelli stands behind the boat on water skis. Wait...]
RICHIE
Fonz, there's no way you can jump that shark with your water skis. [A buoy ring contains a shark, and a larger red buoy warns "DANGER" in white letters]
FONZIE
Aaaay! I've gotta try, Richie.
[Church confessional, day. Cartman opens the penitent door and sees a woman with her exposed ass up against the partition]
WOMAN
Oh, huhuh. [Cartman opens the priest's door. Priest Maxi, in a sexual act with the woman on the other side, looks out and grins]
STAN
Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
CARTMAN
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!
[Beach. Richie, Potsy, Ralph, and Joanie are on the shore watching the boat driver take Fonzie on his stunt. On shore is a sign posted on a pair of surfboards that reads "GO FONZ!!!"]
JOANIE
Go Fonz!!!
FONZIE
Aaaaaa-- [the image freezes in place, so that Fonzie is suspended in mid-air]
ANNOUNCER
And now the exciting conclusion of... South Park.
FONZIE
[action resumes]—aaaaaayy-err. [lands inside the buoy ring; the shark catches and eats him live. The shark rises out of the water with Fonzie still in its mouth] No! [the shark drops and rises again] No! [...and again...] No! [a pool of blood develops inside the buoy ring] No!
RICHIE
I told him he couldn't do it. [the other three on shore look on stunned]
[South Park Elementary, playground. Cartman stands on a platform and is preaching to the kids]
CARTMAN
I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh! [a group of adults gathers just outside the rear school doors. Kyle joins Cartman on the platform...]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
["'Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone! Oh, praise His name!"] You see that, parents? Your children have refused to come into class since this morning. I'm afraid your son is the leader, Ms. Cartman. ["But do you believe in the power of God?"] Apparently he's read the entire Bible, and now he's scaring the hell out of everyone.
LIANE
[gently calls out] Boopie-kins. ["Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?"] It's time to stop preaching damnation to everyone, sweetie. [Cartman stops]
STAN
[joins Cartman on the platform] Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs.
KIDS
Yeah!
SHARON
We are not trying to persecute you kids, but you're supposed to be in school.
STAN
What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.
KYLE
Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Don't listen to them, kids. You have to go to school.
CARTMAN
Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was [throws himself down face-first] smacked down by the Lord-uh! [rises] God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell! So when will you go? Tomorrow? Ten years? Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh! [kids gasp, adults go glum] But we cannot worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides, [Kyle has left and now returns with an easel with a picture of a church on it] so we will build a new church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that connects this part hmya [near the top of the left-side wall] to this part hmya. [the grass down below] Who will help us?
KIDS
[in unison] I will.
CARTMAN
Praise God-uh!
[Hell, River Styx Condominiums. Satan is seen looking at the Bargain Hotel Saddam is in]
SATAN
If I go spend the night with Saddam, then it's over between me and Chris. [looks at Saddam's room key] Chris has been so nice to me and I know Saddam will just hurt me again. [looks at it again] M-maybe I'll just go talk to Saddam. I need closure, yeah. That's it, I need closure. [advances to the hotel, to room 16, then turns around with second thoughts] What am I doing? [takes a step when the room door opens]
SADDAM
[in evening suit] What took yo so long, baby?
SATAN
[turns around] Saddam, I'm just here to talk.
SADDAM
Great! Let's talk! [Saddam enters. Saddam rushes to the bed and sits on it, stroking the covers] Hmm, this bed is comfy-bumpy.
SATAN
Saddam, I only came here because I need closure.
SADDAM
Sounds fun. You know me, I'll try anything.
SATAN
No! Saddam, listen to me.
SADDAM
Would you like a drink?
SATAN
Um, maybe just... a little one. [Saddam serves him a drink] I have to go back soon. I need you to understand that we can't be together anymore. [Satan turns on the TV and a video of a group of men is shown. A sheriff lowers his pants before a kneeling skinhead. Other men are singing, chanting, moaning] I need you to not come by the condo and not try to see me. Chris thinks we can all be friends, but I don't. And I have to focus on Chris now. [just now notices the video] What is this?
SADDAM
These hotels have all kinds of crazy channels.
SATAN
Saddam, will you listen to me?! Chris is a great person. He's the one I wanna be with now.
SADDAM
[knowingly] Really? So then... What are you doing here? [Satan has no answer. He just looks down and away] Well, I don't know about you, but this video is gettin' me pretty hot!
SATAN
[hurt] Saddam...
SADDAM
Here, have another drink. [Satan takes it and swallows it down]
[Hell, Bargain Hotel, Saddam's room. Satan is sleeping away peacefully]
SATAN
[wakes up] Ooh, whoa... God, my head. Drank too much. [looks to his left] Chris? [the camera zooms out to show Saddam, dressed in leather straps, looking at him lovingly. Five different kinds of dildos and a whip are seen. Satan quickly sits up] Oh no!! [scans the room and sees more sex toys, including an auto club, an Antonio Banderas blow-up doll, a penis pump, and a goat tied to a lamp]
SADDAM
[snuggling up] Man, look at that! We went through 14 bottles of vegetable oil! [tosses the last one off the bed.] Ewuh, I'm all greasy.
SATAN
[leaves the bed] Oh God, what time is it?
SADDAM
Last night was awesome! Are we together again now?
SATAN
I don't know. I-I guess so, but now I have to go home and tell Chris.
SADDAM
Screw him!!
SATAN
No, Saddam! I at least owe him an explanation! [walks towards the door] I just don't know what I'm gonna say. [the door opens and closes. Satan is gone]
SADDAM
I know how to solve this little problem.
[Baja California coast, Mexico, day. The camera pans slowly to the right.]
DRIVER
[off-screen] We are now entering Ensenada, the second largest city on the Mexican Baja Peninsula. [the tour bus is seen making its way through Ensenada] We have now traveled over 2000 miles since leaving New York City. We'll just be stopping here for a few moments for gas, and then our tour will continue onto its final destination. [two gas station attendants approach the bus. One of them notices something]
ATTENDANT
Oiga. Hay algo pegado bajo el autobus. ["Listen. There's something stuck under the bus."]
DRIVER
'Kay. What's stuck to the bottom of the bus? [the attendant takes his mop and jabs at the bottom of the bus, and Kenny finally drops down]
KENNY
(Ahow..!)
DRIVER
Oh, goodness! We must have run over a little Mexican further up north. Is it okay? [Kenny sits up and shakes his dizziness off]
ATTENDANT
Pienso que sí. ["I think so." Kenny stands up]
DRIVER
Well, here's fifty for the gas. [starts the bus and drives off] Adios.
KENNY
(Where am I?)
ATTENDANT
¿Qué?
KENNY
(Where am I?)
ATTENDANT
¿Qué?
[South Park, day. Cartman's blueprint for his church is shown, then the camera pans right to show the actual construction. A bunch of kids work on the structure, using all sorts of things, including mirrors for wall panels.]
CARTMAN
This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.
STAN
There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.
KYLE
Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!
GERALD
[shows up with Sheila, behind the boys] Hello, boys. [they turn around]
KYLE
Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith!
SHEILA
It's not that, Kyle. It's just that Eric's mother needs to see you all right away. [Stan, Cartman and Kyle look at each other, suspicious] Just really quick; she says it's very important.
CARTMAN
Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants. [the boys turn left and walk towards Cartman's house]
SHEILA
I sure hope this works.
[Cartman residence, later. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle enter. Dialog from "Not Without My Anus," set to an organ and canned laughter, is heard as the boys make their way across a living room littered with toys of all sorts. The room is decorated so that the boys would forget their "mission" and just play for one afternoon. Liane shows up with a Cartman favorite.]
LIANE
Hello, kiddies. I made you all powdered doughnut pancake surprise.
STAN
Wow, cool.
CARTMAN
No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress!
LIANE
What?
CARTMAN
This is a distraction from our work on the church! [grabs a doughnut] Do not think that you can tempt us with toys [takes a bite out of his doughnut] and new games [munches away] and tidings of powdered doughnut pancake surprise! For it is the afterlife we have concerned ourselves with! [finishes the doughnut off] Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!!
STAN
Yeah!
LIANE
Oh. Well, [sets the dish on the sofa and walks away] alrighty then.
[Kitchen, moments later. Liane enters. Sister Anne waits with Stan's and Kyle's parents]
LIANE
I... don't think it worked.
ALL
Aww.
[Living room, moments later.]
CARTMAN
Let us get back to our work at the church. [the phone rings] Yea. I shall answer the phone, hyah. [answers it] Hello?
KENNY
[from a pay phone next to Papas & Beer in Ensenada] (Cartman?! Cartman, you've gotta help me, and I'm not foolin' around!)
CARTMAN
[grins mischievously, then] Oh my God!!
STAN
What?
CARTMAN
It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave!
STAN
Kenny?! [move towards the phone] What's he say?
KYLE
[moves next to Stan] Ask him what hell is like.
CARTMAN
Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!
KENNY
(Um...) [mariachi music is heard, and the street is lively enough]
[Hell, River Styx Condominiums. Satan has returned, and is outside the door to his condo]
SATAN
Oh, God, Chris is gonna be so mad at me. Well, here it goes. [opens the door and enters. Chris is sitting alone on the sofa reading a book]
CHRIS
Hey, you.
SATAN
Hi, Chris. [closes the door]
CHRIS
You... were out all night.
SATAN
Yeah, I just... spent the night walking around the marina.
CHRIS
Satan. You know you're not a very good liar. You went and saw Saddam, didn't you?
SATAN
[low voice] Yes. [covers his face in shame]
CHRIS
[approaches] Satan, I understand.
SATAN
[drops his left arm and looks surprised] What?
CHRIS
I still feel secure and safe with you.
SATAN
[walks away exasperated] Oh, n-no!
CHRIS
[puzzled] What? What's wrong? I said it's okay.
SATAN
I know.
CHRIS
Well, what more do you want from me?
SATAN
[turns around] Well... could you not be such a pussy about it? I mean, can't you just say "If you ever see Saddam again, I'll break your legs!" or, or "I'm gonna go kick Saddam's ass!" or something?
CHRIS
Satan, I'm a '90s man. I cry when I need to. I share my feelings and I keep my mind open about everything.
SATAN
Just... give me some boundaries, be jealous, go throw a football around, for Christ's sake.
CHRIS
[sits down on the sofa] Now you're starting to hurt my feelings.
SATAN
[turns away] Ah—I'm sorry, Chris, it's... it's not you, really, it's, it's me. [Saddam pops up outside the window and checks out the situation, then drops down] You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, and for some reason, I just can't accept that. [Saddam slides the window open and drops in behind the sofa, making his way to Chris]
SADDAM
[pops up behind Chris with a dagger] Die, pussy! [rams it into Chris's forehead]
CHRIS
Agghhh!
SATAN
[turns around] Chris! [advances] Saddam, what the hell are you doing?!
SADDAM
[a dead Chris lies slumped against the sofa's arm] There. I got rid of the problem for you. Now there's no conflict.
SATAN
[distraught, buries his face in his hands] No! Not like this..!
[South Park, day. Cartman's church is finished. Red carpet, purple doors... His new followers are gathered inside]
CARTMAN
[on stage wielding a Bible] Friends, I have to tell you that last night I received a phone call from beyond the grave-eh. [the kids gasp] It was our departed friend, Kenny! Calling from the depths of hell! And he described what hell is like in horrid detail-uh. [the kids are frightened] He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish.
KIDS
Wagghh..!
CARTMAN
He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh!
KIDS
Whoa!
CARTMAN
And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!
KIDS
Wagghh! [a couple enters the church]
FATHER
Where is our daughter?
HEIDI
[steps into the aisle] Dad?
FATHER
Marcy! You're coming home this instant!
CARTMAN
[quite animated, hops twice] We are saving your daughter from the clutches of hell, suh! [points]
FATHER
You're not gonna make my daughter part of your cult!
CARTMAN
Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!
FATHER
[a piece of wood falls from the roof] You're just a stupid little fat kid who thinks that-- [jab] Aagghh--! [the piece of wood falls off the man's head and rests behind him]
MOTHER
Stephen? [the kids are shocked; she genuflects next to him] Stephen, no!
CARTMAN
The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh!
KIDS
Forgive us, Lord.
CARTMAN
Let us pray. [an organ is played] Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry.
MOTHER
[in a panic] Stephen? Stephen?
[Hell, waiting area. Many souls are there, wondering where they are, and why]
STEPHEN
Where... where am I?
MAN
Where are we?
MAN 2
No doubt about it...
WOMAN
What's happening??
MAN 3
Oooooooooh!
SPEAKER
Hello, newcomers, and welcome. Can everybody hear me? [taps the mic a few times] Hello? Can everyb--? Okay. [the crowd quiets down] Uh, I'm the hell director. Uh, it looks like we have about 8,615 of you newbies today, and for those of you who are a little confused, uh, you are dead, and this is hell, so, abandon all hope and uh yada yada yada. Uh, we are now going to start the orientation process, which will last about--
MAN 4
Hey, wait a minute, I shouldn't be here. I was a totally strict and devout Protestant! I thought we went to heaven!
HELL DIRECTOR
Yes, well I'm afraid you were wrong.
SOLDIER
I was a practicing Jehovah's Witness.
HELL DIRECTOR
Uh, you picked the wrong religion as well.
MAN 5
Well, who was right? Who gets into heaven?
HELL DIRECTOR
I'm afraid it was the Mormons. Yes, the Mormons were the correct answer.
CROWD
[disappointed] Awww.
HELL DIRECTOR
So now I'd like to quickly introduce your new ruler and master for eternity, Satan.
SATAN
[appears in a burst of flame] Oooyeah!
CROWD
Aaggghh!
SATAN
Now you are all part of my domain! Everyday in hell grows larger as my minions... my m-minions uh... [relents] muh, I'm sorry. I just can't do this today. I'm just... I'm sorry. [walks away. The crowd's eyes follow him. A woman throws her hands up]
HELL DIRECTOR
Uh, okay. Thank you, Satan. Now, uh, let's begin with the Muslims...
CHRIS
[in the crowd] Satan! [Satan turns and sees him, then smiles. Chris makes his way through the crowd] 'Scuse me. Excuse me.
SATAN
Chris! [he and Chris now stand before each other] But I thought you were dead!
CHRIS
Yeah, well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?
SATAN
Chris, I didn't mean for Saddam to stab you in--
CHRIS
Hey, it's alright. All that matters is that I'm back, and we're together forever. Right?
SATAN
Uh... yeah. Gr-great.
CROWD
Awww.
[Cartman residence, night. Cartman is working at a coffee table in the living room with Clyde Frog and a Bible]
CARTMAN
Let's see... Matthew 15:11. "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes out of the mouth defileth a man." That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting. [Sister Anne approaches]
LIANE
[enters] Eric, Sister Anne has come to visit you.
CARTMAN
Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon. [Liane leaves]
SISTER ANNE
[sits] Eric, you need to stop what you're doing. You need to tell all the kids to go back to school, and back to their normal lives.
CARTMAN
Sister, have you read this book?
SISTER ANNE
Yes, Eric. A lot more than you have.
CARTMAN
Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh.
SISTER ANNE
Eric, the Lord just doesn't send everybody to hell. That wouldn't make sense. He wants people to live their lives.
CARTMAN
Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true?
SISTER ANNE
No.
CARTMAN
We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus! [resumes his work]
SISTER ANNE
[exasperated, drops her head in her hands] Uugh..! [lifts her head] Wait a minute. That's it. [rises and walks away]
TELEVANGELIST
[suddenly on TV] ...And I'm gonna save all of you right now. [raps a woman on the head. She goes unconscious] I'm gonna heal your sins-eh.
CARTMAN
Well...
[Hell, Bargain Hotel. Chris approaches and goes to Room 16, and knocks on the door]
SADDAM
Hello Satan-ooh, crap! It's you!
CHRIS
Yeah. It's me.
SADDAM
I thought I killed you!
CHRIS
Yeah...
SADDAM/CHRIS
Well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?
SADDAM
Right, right.
CHRIS
Do you have a couple of minutes to go for a walk?
SADDAM
A walk?
CHRIS
Yeah. Just real quick. Around the park or somethin'.
SADDAM
[considers it] Is this some kind of trick?
CHRIS
No, I just want you to go for a quick walk with me. Please?
SADDAM
Well, alright. Just let me grab somethin' real quick. [goes inside humming and reaches his dresser. He sees the dagger and takes it with him behind his back, then rejoins Chris] Okay, let's walk. [Chris walks while Saddam closes the door]
[Hell, the park. Saddam and Chris walk side by side]
CHRIS
Saddam, I get the feeling that you don't like me very much.
SADDAM
Gee, whatever gave you that idea? When I stabbed you in the head?
CHRIS
Look, Satan is a very important person to me. And I know he's an important person to you, too. So don't you think it's best for us to just... try and get along? I realize that some things about me bother you. So I'd like to hear what those things are so that I can work on them.
SADDAM
You know why I don't like you, Chris? Because you're the kind of guy who, if someone didn't like him, would take him for a walk in the park and ask him why. You're a pussy! [takes his dagger out and slices into Chris's right shoulder]
CHRIS
Agghhh! [Saddam goes into a grave, takes out a shovel, and slices off Chris's lower right leg. Chris falls down] Oh God!
SADDAM
Ah hahaha!
CHRIS
Nooo! Agh! [reaches into his right shoulder, takes the dagger, and thrusts it into Saddam's left eye]
SADDAM
Aggghhh! [swings the shovel at Chris and strikes him down with it]
CHRIS
Ow! [Saddam jumps on him and pulls his heart out of his body] Goo-aagh..! [Saddam holds the heart high in the air, then collapses on top of Chris's body. The camera zooms out]
[Cartman's church, next day. The child congregation is gathered again at the church. Organ music plays]
CARTMAN
Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?
KYLE
Yes!
CARTMAN
Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!
KYLE
Yes!
CARTMAN
That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh! [smacks him on the face] Theah!
KYLE
[angrily] Ow! [rubs his right temple and cheek while Cartman talks]
CARTMAN
Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?
KYLE
[softens] Uh, I think so.
CARTMAN
Praise the Lord-uh!
CROWD
[ad lib all at once] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah! Praise God! [two robed assistants help a happy Kyle off the stage]
CARTMAN
For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person! [Timmy rolls up in his wheelchair] This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!
BUTTERS
Huh-Hallelujah!
TIMMY
Timmiiiy!
CARTMAN
We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!
TIMMY
Timmiiiy!
CARTMAN
Devil be [smacks him on the face] gone-uh!
TIMMY
Haagggh.
CARTMAN
Now walk, Timmih! [turns away dramatically, with eyes closed]
TIMMY
Haagggh.
CARTMAN
[turns away, then back] Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh!
TIMMY
Haghh.
CARTMAN
The Lord wants you to walk, Timmih! Oo-walk, Timmih! [turns away dramatically, with eyes closed]
TIMMY
Timmilih? [drops to the floor on his feet and stands unsteadily. Cartman smiles openly]
CARTMAN
He walks-uh!
KIDS
Whoa!
TIMMY
Oh-aagghhh! [falls forward and crashes through the floor head first. A beaming Cartman mistakes this for something good]
CARTMAN
Yes! Praise the Lord!
KIDS
Praise the Lord!
[Hell, River Styx Condos. Satan is talking to somebody outside]
SATAN
And now it's like there's one guy who's horrible to me but I'm totally sexually attracted to, and then one guy who's really nice to me but I'm not sexually attracted to at all.
JONBENÉT RAMSEY
Wow, that really sucks.
SATAN
I've asked everybody for advice, but nobody seems to know the answer.
JONBENÉT RAMSEY
Well, there is one person who I always used to ask when I needed advice.
SATAN
Who?
JONBENÉT RAMSEY
God.
SATAN
[stunned] God?? I can't do that. I haven't spoken to God in like, 5000 years.
JONBENÉT RAMSEY
Well then, maybe it's time.
[Cartman's church, day. The child congregation is singing and clapping outside and inside. Timmy is back, with a bandaged head]
KIDS
Do dodo dum do dodo
Do dodo dum do dodo
CARTMAN
For he is Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord
Where are you from, little boy? [this boy wears glasses]
BOY
Denver.
CARTMAN
And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it?
BOY
Yeah, that's right.
KIDS
Wooooo!
CARTMAN
Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone! [smacks the boy in the face and knocks him out]
BOY
Aghh... [two robed assistants carry him off]
KIDS
Hooray!
CARTMAN
For he is Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord
Right here we have a little girl who is very, very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?!
UGLY GIRL
Yes!
CARTMAN
He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at! [smacks her on the face] Bah!
UGLY GIRL
Wagh...
CARTMAN
[moonwalks] Bwolololololololololololo! Oh, good Lord, somebody say "Amen!"
KIDS
Amen! [the pianist is shown, with a girl singing next to him]
ALL
Lord, Lord, Lord
[A flash of white, and the light dims enough to show clouds roiling in the sky. Satan comes up quickly, and then stops. This is heaven. A group of Mormon souls gather around him]
MORMON 1
Hi hi, welcome to heaven, brother. You've followed the Mormon faith, and so you've been let in!
SATAN
Uh, actually, I'm just stopping by.
MORMON 2
Well, you've picked a great time! We've got cookies and punch and we're just about to start playing charades.
MORMONS
[ad lib all at once] Alright. Yeah.
MORMON 1
And then, Brother Stephen's brought his guitar so we can sing songs about how much it hurts to lie.
MORMONS
Ooooh!
MORMON 3
Yeahahah!
SATAN
Ah, look, I just need to talk with God. Is he around?
MORMON 2
Sure. All you have to do is say his name and he's there.
MORMON 1
I'm so grateful for that.
MORMONS
[in assent] Me, too. Uh huh.
SATAN
Great. Thanks. [walks off]
[Heaven, a separate area. Satan walks into it and turns to the camera]
SATAN
[clears his throat] Ah... Hello? G-God? It's uh... Satan. [quickly shields his eyes as a sphere of light descends towards him]
GOD
[in silhouette] Yea. Look upon me, and know me.
SATAN
Hi, God.
GOD
Hello, Satan. [has a body made from bits of some of the creatures he created] It's... been a long time.
SATAN
Yeah.
GOD
What brings you here? Do you wish to mount your unholy war against heaven?
SATAN
No, I have a problem, and I... need your advice.
GOD
You want to rule more than hell? You want to destroy the Earth?
SATAN
No, it's kind of a long story but, well, it all started when this Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, [God scratches behind his left ear] was killed by a pack of wild boars. I remember when I first met him in hell. It was a lovely morning in April...
[Cartman's church, day. Cartman leads the kids in singing and rolls on his back a few times.]
CARTMAN
Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar! [The clapping stops as confused faces appear in the congregation, and the music quiets a bit. Stan and Kyle look at each other as Cartman goes for the collection box] So I want everyone to feel the love of God by coming up heah, [sets the box at center stage] and putting a dollar in the box-ah! [kids begin to approach the stage] Come on, don't be shy! Come on now! [rolls on his back as the donations come in]
STAN
Dude, that seems kind of... weird.
KYLE
Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.
[Heaven, a separate area. Satan finishes his story]
SATAN
...And now Chris and Saddam just keep killing each other over and over and... I don't know which one to pick.
GOD
[considers the story, then] Jesus, what the hell happened to you?
SATAN
Huh?
GOD
You got kicked out of here for being a headstrong rebel. And now you're a whiny little bitch.
SATAN
Well, I just don't know which one to pick.
GOD
No, you've become dependent on relationships. So you haven't even considered the option of not being with either of them. [Satan listens] And if you're not sexually attracted to someone, you're not ever going to be. But Saddam isn't right either. He's the other extreme. You need to spend time alone so that you can find the balance, the middle ground. That's what I always do, because I'm a Buddhist.
SATAN
God, you're right. You know, I've had steady relationships for the last... thousand years, and when one ends I just start another one, but... I haven't taken the time to be secure with myself.
GOD
Bingo. [a fly gets near him and he snaps his tongue out to catch it and eat it]
SATAN
Hey... Thanks, God. I forgot how clear you make things sometimes.
GOD
It was nice to see you again, Satan.
SATAN
You too.
GOD
Goodbye. [turns into the sphere of light and flies up and away. Satan turns and walks off, but encounters the Mormons]
MORMON 2
Would you like to stay for some cookies and punch?
MORMON 1
Yes, would you?
SATAN
Uh, no, I need to be getting back.
MORMON 2
Oh, alright then, but you're gonna miss our big play.
MORMON 4
Yes. We're going to do a play about how alcohol can ruin family life.
SATAN
Wow. That sounds great, but uh, I really gotta go. [disappears in a burst of flames]
MORMON 1
Well, he seemed like a nice fellow.
MORMON 4
Yes. [a few seconds of silence follow]
MORMON 2
Let's go make things out of egg cartons.
MORMONS
[ad lib] Oooh, yeah. I'll do that.
[Cartman's church, day. The singing and clapping have resumed. Stan and Kyle go through some curtains to the back of the church.]
CARTMAN
[offscreen] Yeess. [the camera looks at him, now rolling around shirtless in $1 bills, now grabbing a bunch and bathing in them] Yeess. [sees Stan and Kyle] It worked, you guys, it actually worked!
STAN
What worked?
CARTMAN
Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all!
STAN/KYLE
What?
KYLE
You're keeping that money yourself?
CARTMAN
Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars! [grins big] Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route.
STAN
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?
CARTMAN
It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school.
STAN
[he and Kyle are now angry] Well, what about going to hell and all that?!
CARTMAN
Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that.
KYLE
[points] Then why didn't you tell us?!
CARTMAN
My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!
KYLE
The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!
CARTMAN
[rolls around in the money] Suck my balls!
STAN
Dude, I am so disillusioned right now.
[Somewhere in hell. Chris and Saddam are fighting once again. Saddam charges at him with a gray brick]
SADDAM
Die, pussy! [smashes the brick on Chris's head, and they both fall]
CHRIS
Ow..! [gets up, grabs one of Saddam's legs, and pulls it off]
SADDAM
Aagghh! [gets up, grabs his leg back and beats Chris over the back with it. Chris falls on his face]
CHRIS
Aagghh! [grabs one end of the leg, and now it's a tug of war. Satan arrives and sees the battle]
SATAN
Guys, guys, guys! [the two rivals stop and face him] Look, you both can stop fighting now! I've made a decision.
CHRIS
You have?
SATAN
Yes. I... don't want to be with either one of you.
CHRIS/SADDAM
What?!
SATAN
Saddam, you're an asshole. And you'll never be the friend that I want. And Chris, well, you're a pussy. And you'll never be the lover I want. [Chris looks dejected] So I'm just gonna be alone for a while and learn to like myself. [Saddam sighs]
CHRIS
Satan. Can we go for a walk in the park?
SATAN
No, I'm not going on a walk! You're a pussy, Chris, and you drive me crazy; go away!
CHRIS
Fine. [walks away]
SADDAM
Hell, you can't leave me, Satan! I won't let you! [Satan is shocked]
[Cartman's church, next day. Cartman holds forth. Stan and Kyle stand behind the collection box as kids stop by and put in their $1 donations]
CARTMAN
Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh! [Sister Anne enters the church]
SISTER ANNE
[walking down center aisle] Alright kids, it's time to go. It's time for this to stop!
CARTMAN
Sister Anne is a blasphemer!
SISTER ANNE
I know you won't listen to me. That's why I brought somebody else. [steps aside. The curtains part. Jesus enters and walks down the aisle]
KIDS
[in obvious awe] Wow!
BUTTERS
Jesus!
CARTMAN
[worried] Uh-oh.
JESUS
Kids, you need to all stop spending all your time here and go back to school.
CARTMAN
[tugs on Jesus' robs, then softly] Jesus, ix-nay on the ool-schay.
JESUS
God doesn't want you to spend all your time being afraid of hell, or praising His name. God wants you to spend your time helping others, and living a good, happy life. That's how you live for Him.
CARTMAN
[goes for the collection box again] Ee-yes, by doing that, [brings it out] and, putting a dollar in the box-uh!
BEBE
Let's go ice-skating.
GIRLS
Yea! [leave their seats]
BUTTERS
Uh, we can help Timmy learn how to ice-skate, too.
BOY
Yeah. [others leave their seats and vacate the church]
CARTMAN
[on his knees] No, come back! You face everlasting damnation! [the last congregant leaves the church] Wait! No! No! [pounds the floor with his fists a few times] I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit!
KYLE
Serves you right, Cartman!
STAN
Yeah!
JESUS
But Eric, I think this time I have to teach you a lesson. I'm sending you somewhere to think about your sins!
CARTMAN
You're gonna send me to hell?
JESUS
No. Worse!
[Ensenada, Mexico, day. Mariachi music plays in the background. A tour bus stops in front of Papas and Beer and drops Cartman off, then pulls away]
KENNY
[rushes up to him] (Eric! Eric!)
CARTMAN
[sees Kenny] Aw, crap!
[Hell, the park. Satan is strolling through the park in a happy mood]
SATAN
[encounters two men] Hi, Bob. Hi, Rick.
RICK
Hi, Satan.
SADDAM
[waiting in the road] There you are!
SATAN
[rolls his eyes] Awgh... Not again.
SADDAM
You know you can't live without me. Now get that ass back to bed!
SATAN
Saddam, I told you, I don't need you anymore!
SADDAM
You can't leave me, Satan. Nobody leaves me.
SATAN
Yes, I can! Raaarrr! [blasts a hole through Saddam with lightning from his index finger. Saddam falls]
SADDAM
Aw, you little..prick!
SATAN
Goodbye forever, Saddam!
SADDAM
[coughs] What are you talking about? You can kill me, but I'll be back tomorrow.
SATAN
Not this time. I asked a favor of an old friend of mine to let you in.
SADDAM
Let me in where? [flames engulf Saddam and disappears]
[Heaven, Saddam is whisked into it, as Satan was]
SADDAM
What the..? Hey, what the hell is this place?!
MORMON 5
Hello, and welcome.
MORMON 1
We're glad you made it, brother.
SADDAM
Ey, who the hell are you?
MORMON 6
We're just about to do a play, about how much stealing hurts you deep inside. Come join us. [he and others crowd in on Saddam]
MORMONS
[ad lib] Yes. Come on. Let's go.
MORMON 6
You're here forever. [the Mormons lift him up and carry him away over their heads]
SADDAM
Nooo! N-nooooooooooo!
End of Probably


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The boys devise a plan to travel back in time a full year and return to the third grade, with the help of Timmy and his electronic wheelchair.

script:Fourth Grade

[South Park Elementary, morning. The school bell rings. A "WELCOME BACK!" sign hangs over a row of student lockers as kids mill around in the hall. The camera pans to the right to show the four boys standing before their new classroom: FOURTH GRADE.]
STAN
Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade.
KYLE
Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders! [two older boys come up behind Stan and Kyle and punch them to the floor. A third 5th-grader arrives. Stan and Kyle look up.]
5TH-GRADER IN MIDDLE
Get out of my way, you little dorks! [Stan and Kyle struggle a bit, then get up]
KYLE
Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too!
5TH-GRADER IN MIDDLE
Yeah, but now, we're fifth-graders, you stupid fourth-graders, so move it! [he and the boy to his left punch Stan and Kyle down again.]
KYLE
[rises with Stan] Ungh, gay, dude.
STAN
Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up. [looks left and sees someone] Hey, come here [signals a boy, Pete Thelman, over.]
PETE
What?
STAN
What grade are you going into?
PETE
Thi-ird
STAN
Stupid third grader!
CARTMAN
Yeah, [punches Pete down] get out of here! [withdraws]
PETE
Uhuhuhow.
CARTMAN
There, that's better.
KYLE
You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver.
STAN
Denver? [Butters and Clyde arrive]
CARTMAN
U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her. [Kevin arrives]
KYLE
He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship! [Pip arrives, then Craig, then Wendy and Bebe]
STAN
Alright. [turns to face the gathering group] Hey, listen up everybody! [Tweek and four others arrive, then Timmy...] We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical! [the other kids smile]
CLYDE
Like what?
STAN
[with a look of determination] Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, "KISS MY ASS!!!" all together!
THE KIDS
YEAH!!!
CARTMAN
[softly] Why, that's PERfect!
BUTTERS
Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants down, [turns to his left to demonstrate] should we stand frontways or back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, or-ar our w-wieners?
STAN
...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters.
BUTTERS
Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this [shows his back to Stan and moves his right hand around], with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs, you know, and give 'er a nice fruit bowl.
KYLE
...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses.
STAN
Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, "KISS MY ASS!!!"
KYLE
Together we are strong! [raises fists]
THE KIDS
YEAH!!!
CLYDE
[points to Timmy] Hey, Timmy might need some help pulling his pants down.
STAN
We got you covered, Timmy.
TIMMY
Timmay!
[The bell rings again, and the kids enter their new classroom a bit awed at the surroundings. Lab sinks and equipment line the walls. New, modern desks greet them. An aquarium and some modern art are also present.]
KYLE
Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom?
BUTTERS
Huhuh, look at all this stuff.
CARTMAN
[takes a seat] Hey, what the hell is with these little half-desks?
STAN
Dude, look at the walls. [A new alphabet strip in Vivaldi font hangs over the chalkboard] Everything is written in some strange, foreign language.
NEW TEACHER
[enters, faces the students, and talks with a bit of an accent] Alright, children, quiet down. Welcome to the fourth grade. [the kids stare at her with mouths open. Her breasts hang down to her knees]
KYLE
Holy God, dude!
KENNY
(Those titties are fuckin' huge!) [the teacher turns and write on the board...]
NEW TEACHER
My name is Ms. Choksondik.
STAN
[softly, to Kyle] ...More like, Ms. Makes-me-sick. [starts chuckling]
KYLE
Yeah! [starts chuckling]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[now with book in hand] Play time is over, children! Do you understand me?! [a stunned silence fills the room] I don't know how your last teacher behaved, but this is the fourth grade! [Cartman grabs on tight to his chair as he looks at the wall clock, which now reads 8:35] And it is time to go to work!
CARTMAN
[chuckles, leaps up on his desk, and moons Ms. Choksondik] KISS MY ASS!!! [no one else moves a muscle, as they are still awed by the teacher's appearance. Cartman looks left, then right...] Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[arms akimbo] Well, young man, I hope you have a good explanation for this.
CARTMAN
[with his back still to Ms. Choksondik] Oh, I'm sure I do.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
This is the fourth grade! You need to grow up! [wags a finger at him]
CARTMAN
I'm trying.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Now, get back to your desk and write a thousand-word essay on why you feel you need to disrupt my class.
CARTMAN
[pulls his pants up and sits down again] Fantastic, then.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[turns to the board and begins writing] Now, let us begin our first-day exam. [the class sighs audibly] SILENCE!
[South Park Elementary, outside. The bell rings, and the students head out onto the playground.]
STAN
What a bitch!
KYLE
And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at.
CARTMAN
You guys are all such pussies!
TWEEK
I can't take it, man! Writing in cursive?? Fractions?? I can't do i-it!
STAN
This is it. The end of innocence. [grows sad] This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents warned us about.
KYLE
I just didn't think it would come so soon.
CARTMAN
Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.
KYLE
Huh?
CARTMAN
Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was.
[wistfully] Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade?
We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade
[a classroom scene, then a playground scene as heads of Cartman and Kenny float by]
We learned wondrous things from a teacher so nice
[Mr. Garrison is dressed as a pirate before a happy class]
Sat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles
[Their desks turn into marshmallow seats and float up as the classroom fades into sky. A teddy-bear face floats by]
The world seemed to all make sense
but that sense seems to slowly fade
[They float towards a rainbow and sun, and the scene fades to black, then to the playground]
After Third Grade
In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons
[Garrison leads the class in a march at a candy land]
We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue
[Cartman makes a glitter picture of a cow's face]
We had warm cookies and hearts full of love
[Kenny makes one of a clown holding a bloody knife in one hand and a boy's bloody head in the other]
And there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you...
[Cartman sings to the audience and points]
There's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to go back, for one minute
[Garrison leads the class in a march at a candy land, then gives each kid a happy spanking in a room full of huge wrapped presents. The scene fades to the playground again]
To Third Grade
[A moment of silence, and Clyde starts to cry. Butters draws near and consoles him]
KYLE
Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was.
BUTTERS
Huh-it sure was.
CARTMAN
[wistfully] I wish I was still there.
STAN
Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!
KYLE
How?
STAN
[a bit dramatic] We travel back in time.
KYLE
Oh yeah, time travel.
BUTTERS
Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does it hurt? [waves the suggestion off] I don't wanna do it if it hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky.
STAN
It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.
CARTMAN
Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it.
KYLE
Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement.
CARTMAN
Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how!
[The basement of the two college guys, after school. These are computer geeks, with at least three computers in there. The blond guy works on his nose as he talks.]
NERD #1
When it comes to time-traveling theory, there are basically two school of thought. The Spock Theory is that a sling shot around the sun could create a wormhole in which time could not escape. The Lieutenant Commander Data Theory, however, is that a nag vibration could create a rip in the time-space continuum-
CARTMAN
Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.
NERD #2
Time-travel is no laughing matter. Four times the Enterprise went back in time, and four times they almost didn't make it back.
STAN
We don't want to make it back, we want to stay there.
NERD #1
Oh.
KYLE
So can you do it?
NERD #2
It's all theoretical, but from a scientific standpoint, the creation of a rip in space-time is possible. We just need to find an inertia device. [they think]
NERD #1
Heeeyyy. [approaches Timmy's chair] This kid's electric wheelchair might be just what we need.
TIMMY
Tuh-timmih?
[South Park Elementary, Principal's office. Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey are talking to Chef.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh, this new fourth-grade teacher is driving me nuts!
CHEF
What's the problem?
MR. MACKEY
Uh, you see, Chef, Ms. Choksondik has very large, uh, honkers, and she doesn't seem to like wearing a bra.
CHEF
You call that a problem? That sounds like heaven to me.
MR. MACKEY
No, it's really not as nice as you might imagine, Chef, m'kay. [the door opens and a very angry Ms. Choksondik enters]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Principal Victoria, I would like a word! [her elongated breasts swing freely under her blouse.]
CHEF
Oooo! Call the doctor!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
My new students are the most misbehaved, illiterate, brain-dead group of children I have ever come across!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, Miss... Choksondik, those children did fairly well in the third grade.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
One of them is mentally handicapped, for Christ's sake!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh? Which one?
MS. CHOKSONDIK
The one in the wheelchair! Look, I would like to have a talk with their last year's teacher! Who was it? Mr. Uh-heh, Garrison?! [Terror strikes the faces of Mr. Mackey and Principal Victoria as they look at each other]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I'm afraid that's impossible. Nobody's seen Mr. Garrison since the last school year ended.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Why?! Where did he go?!
MR. MACKEY
[softly, slowly] We... don't like to talk about it.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
But I need help reaching these kids! I have nothing but the highest expectations for them. And with [raises her left arm, which causes the breast nipples to reveal themselves] God as my witness-
THE ADULTS
Aww Oooo!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
I'm going to teach these kids the wonders of the world, so that they can reach the top! [the others recoil at the sight of her nipples again] I hope that sometime very soon you will let me in on what happened to this Mr. Garrison! And with that I will bid you good day!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[trying to hide her stare] Wuh sure thing, fine, bye-bye then. [Ms. Choksondik exits and the other three breathe sighs of relief. Chef instinctively vomits, then covers his mouth.]
[South Park Elementary, Ms. Choksondik's classroom, next day. The kids are all in their seats wearing goggles and the two nerds are with them]
NERD #1
Alright, when we power up, the handicapped kid's chair will accelerate at a high rate of speed about 10 feet that way [towards the board], then make the required magnetic vibrations.
NERD #2
If the fields are right, it should then create a wormhole up near the front of the classroom.
WENDY
You guys don't actually think this is going to work, do you?
NERD #1
Now, eh, when you all see a wormhole, yuh-you guys are gonna have about 4.2 seconds to run through it.
NERD #2
And on the other side you will find yourself in exactly the same spot, only one year ago.
STAN
Back in the third grade.
KIDS
Cool/Wow.
KYLE
I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls!
KIDS
Yeah!
STAN
Oh! Here she comes.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[enters] Alright, children, I hope you all did your homework last night. Please pass your papers up to the frontuh.
CARTMAN
[hops up on his seat] Suck my balls!!! [no one else moves] Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously-
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[sternly] I said, pass your papers to the fronteh!
CARTMAN
We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makes-me-sick! We didn't feel like it!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
It's Choksondik! And you are all going to have detention!
CARTMAN
Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen? [a handheld controller with two thumb joysticks is activated. The two nerds get to work]
NERD #1
Primary fusion initiated.
NERD #2
Molecular grenadine active. [Timmy's chair starts to convulse]
TIMMY
Aa-aa-ah!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
What are you doing?!
CARTMAN
We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa! [the wheelchair is launched and Timmy moves towards the chalkboard]
TIMMY
Timmaaaaaaaaah! [Ms. Choksondik steps aside as Timmy breaks through the wall and out into the snow] Timmaaaaaaaaah! [his voice trails off. The class is in shock. Ms. Choksondik turns and looks out the gaping hole as Timmy turns right and goes past a tree]
NERD #1
I didn't think it would work.
NERD #2
Me neither.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Well, well, well! I'd say somebody has some explaining to do!
CARTMAN
You're damn right they do!
KYLE
Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him!
STAN
Yeah!
KYLE
Come on! [the other kids scramble out of their chairs and rush outside]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Children! Children, come back here!
[South Park, the streets. Timmy is rolling down the street being passed by honking cars going this way and that. Timmy screams a frightened scream]
STAN
Timmy, you have to stop!
NERD #1
No!
STAN
No??
NERD #1
Look, the system malfunctions if he stops. The nuclear core can bake his magnetic field and the whole chair will blow sky-high.
KYLE
What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!
NERD #1
No!
KYLE
[with trembling voice] No??
NERD #2
We've rigged the chair to be sensitive to his weight. If he gets off, the whole thing blows!
STAN
So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?
THE NERDS
Yup.
STAN
My God!
[NEWS 4 LIVE UPDATE]
ANCHOR TOM
[Timmy is shown moving down the street screaming] It's been over three hours since the police first showed up on the scene of a handicapped boy's wheelchair set with explosives.
[South Park, Tele's. The boys and the nerds rush to the video window to watch the report]
STAN
Over here, over here!
ANCHOR TOM
The child can't stop or get off the chair without risking explosion, and so the SWAT team will now attempt to disarm the device.
[South Park, a street. Timmy reaches an open stretch of road]
TIMMY
[in distress] Timmi-hih-ih! [above him a helicopter appears, and a SWAT team member is lowered while keeping up with Timmy]
SWAT HANSEN
Closer! [reaches Timmy] Don't worry, son. Just watch your speed and stay still! [both approach a pair of women waiting to hitch a ride going the other direction]
PILOT
Look out, Hansen!
SWAT RESCUER HANSEN
Oh! [flies into the blonde, knocking her away. Timmy ends up with the brunette on his chair]
BRUNETTE
Aaaah!
TIMMY
Timmaaay!
HANSEN
[floats up to them again] Dear Jesus! Hang on, lady!
BRUNETTE
Oh my God, what's going on?
HANSEN
Ma'am, be very careful! That wheelchair is set to explode!
BRUNETTE
What?! [scrambles around Timmy] AAAH!! Omigod! Omigod!
HANSEN
It's okay! Just stay calm and keep the speed above 5!
BRUNETTE
[trying to hang on] O-kay. O-kay. Omigod.
TIMMY
Tih-Timmah? [the woman sets the speed and locks it in a flash]
BRUNETTE
Okay. I kept the speed at 5.
HANSEN
Good! What's the wheelchair's battery power at?
BRUNETTE
Oh my God! Less than 20 minutes!
[South Park, Tele's. The boys react to the news]
STAN
Less than 20 minutes?!
KYLE
Oh no! What have we done?!
[South Park Elementary, Principal's office. Principal Victoria holds up an oversize bra for Chef's and Mr. Mackey's appraisal]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Whattaya think? Too forward? [the door opens and in enters...]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
I HAVE HAD IT!!!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Waaah! [tosses the bra behind her seat]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
These children are out of control! I must speak with their last year's teacher, Mr. Garrison! [again, the three other adults show fear...]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
As we said before, that's impossible.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
What in God's name happened to him?
CHEF
Uuuh, Ms. Choksondik, Mr. Garrison had several uuh, eee-motional issues. He was a closet homosexual who hated gay people. Whenever someone asked him if he was gay, he'd go nuts.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
And then he was accused of trying to solicit sex from a young boy.
MR. MACKEY
After being dismissed from teaching, he went off to write romance novels. His first novel sold well and everything was fine until he found out that his novel won the gay Pulitzer Prize, and was considered the best homoerotic novel since Huckleberry Finn.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
He finally snapped and had a nervous breakdown and... went up into the mountains to live in solitude.
CHEF
Some say that on cold nights you can still hear him moanin', "I'm not gaaay! I'm not gaaay!"
MR. GARRISON
[barely audible in the distance. The adults strain to hear] Iii'mmm nnnooottt gggaaayyy!!!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
And, nobody has found him?
MR. MACKEY
Well, we really haven't ll-looked.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
I see. [a kitten walks up to her] Then the only way I'll find the secret to teaching these kids is to go up into those mountains and find Mr. Garrison myself!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
But he could be anywhere up high in those mountains.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Oh, I'll find him! Even if I have to climb up [arms spread out and raised to chest level] and up [raised to ear level] and up!
CHEF, VICTORIA, MACKEY
NOOO!!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[lowers upraised arms] What?
[South Park, a street. Timmy and the brunette are still on the open stretch of road]
BRUNETTE
Oh my God, Oh my God!
[South Park, a street. A field reporter is on the scene]
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing about two miles outside of Denver where the darling handicapped boy fights for his life on a wheelchair of death. [camera pulls back to show the nerds next to the reporter, and the boys across the street] Guys, can you tell us what kind of explosive we're actually dealing with here.
NERD #1
Uh, well, it's a simple hydrogen-fusion core with a veltig reactant-
TIMMY
[while the blond nerd talks] Ah, please help!
NERD #2
Which just turned into a time bomb.
TIMMY
Please help.
NERD #1
This has never happened in all the 72 original Star Trek episodes.
NERD #2
Yah... wait, you mean 73 episodes.
NERD #1
...No, there were 72.
NERD #2
No there weren't!
NERD #1
[pushes his friend away] Oh, you are such a nerd! [they start slapping each other around]
FIELD REPORTER
[camera zooms in] Tom, I understand that now, the rescuers are gonna try and send in one of the handicapped boy's little friends, in an attempt to keep him calm and hopefully, disarm the device.
[South Park, a street. A SWAT truck full of rescuers passes Timmy and the brunette and slows down to wheelchair speed. Kenny is with them]
HANSEN
It's alright, everything's goin' tuh be fine.
BRUNETTE
Oh my God!
HANSEN
[sets Kenny on a dolly and secures him] Alright, young man, when you get underneath that wheelchair, I want you to relay back to me with this walkie-talkie, and then I'll tell you which wires to cross. Ready?
KENNY
(Yes, sir!)
HANSEN
Go below! [releases the winch. Kenny and the dolly make their way to Timmy, but they pass each other. Kenny keeps rolling down the road past Stan, Kyle, and Cartman]
KENNY
(Hi guys.) [keeps rolling until he trips over a manhole cover.] (Uh oh.) [the dolly lands on him] (Uff. I'm okay.) [the winch is suddenly yanked, and Kenny zips away] (I'm oKAAAYYYYYYY!!!) [the camera switches to Stan, Kyle, and Cartman looking in the direction of a terribly screechy sound. Soon, Kenny appears ripping up the road with his face, and he stops in front of them, dead]
STAN
Well, who didn't see that coming?
BRUNETTE
[camera back on the wheelchair] Oh my God! Oh my God!
HANSEN
Stay calm! You have to stay calm! [Timmy looks up at him]
BRUNETTE
[in a panic] But if we got off the chair it blows up!
HANSEN
No no, that's only if the boy gets off.
BRUNETTE
Oh. [hops off and stands up] See ya!
TIMMY
Timmih! [Hansen starts to work on the chair]
PILOT
Ten seconds, Hansen!
STAN
...nine, eight...
TIMMY
[looks down at Hansen] Please-a help me.
PILOT
...six, five...
TIMMY
Please help me. Please help me.
HANSEN
Got it! I think! Up, up! [the helicopter rises and takes him up with it]
TIMMY
[upset] Timmay! [with a burst of speed the wheelchair accelerates, then disappears in a flare. Nothing remains of him. The rescuer is back in the helicopter looking down at the event with other rescuers, and the boys are on the curb shocked. The nerds are stunned, and the TV shows the site of the disappearance without comment]
NERD #1
Hey, it did work. [the other nerd grins]
[South Park, a tall mountain not unlike the Matterhorn, next day. Ms. Choksondik scales it, and reaches a plateau. Several cats follow her up. She sees a cave and approaches it, then enters]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Hello-oo-ooo. [walks further in with a lit flashlight] Oh, what am I doing? I'm gonna get myself killed. [calls out] Is anyone here? [the beam falls on Mr. Garrison, now hunched over against a wall and with a full beard. Mr. Hat has a matching beard. Garrison hisses at her] Mister? Mr. Garrison?
MR. GARRISON
Who-? Who are you? What do you want?
MS. CHOKSONDIK
I am the new fourth grade teacher. I've come to... seek your help. [Garrison hisses at her again] Please. I don't know how to handle the new fourth graders. I've tried everything. I need to know how you taught them.
MR. GARRISON
[hiding from the light] No! No, I... haven't... taught in over... eight... months. [the cats try to get at Ms. Choksondik's]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Mr. Garrison, you knew how to reach these kids! You're my only hope!
MR. GARRISON
Do you know what it is to be a teacher, Ms....?
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Choksondik.
MR. GARRISON
No, I don't! [rushes up to her] IT'S A LIE! You see? That's what you get for bein' a teacher! You work and you work for the children and then people start rumors that you're gay even though you love poontang!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Mr. Garrison, these children are depending on me to give them a future. I can't do it without your guidance. Please! Help me, for them! For the future of our children!
MR. GARRISON
...Two hundred bucks.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
...Done.
[The basement of the two college guys, after school. The boys show up again. Much of the stuff that was in the basement is gone. Soon, it is shown that the second nerd has moved out]
STAN
Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!
NERD #1
Huh? Oh... Can't.
KYLE
What do you mean, "can't"?! You made it work; just build us another one!
NERD #1
I can't, because pizza-face isn't here! We're not on speaking terms! We got in a big fight and he moved all his stuff out!
STAN
W-what did you get in a fight about?
NERD #1
There's 73 original Star Treks! He keeps saying there's 72!
STAN
Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me!
NERD #1
No! He actually thinks there's 72.!
CARTMAN
Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him?
NERD #1
No. Pizza-face took all his equipment home to his mom's. Now, if you can go over there and get him to admit that he's wrong...
STAN
Alright, come on, guys. [the boys exit the basement and head up the stairs] Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time!
KYLE
Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up!
[A tropical forest. Dinosaurs roam this land. A Pteranodon flies overhead as a triceratops chases Timmy]
TIMMY
Timmah! Timmaaaaahhh!
[South Park, the "Matterhorn," the plateau outside Garrison's cave. Mr. Garrison walks around Ms. Choksondik as she balances three books on each hand and one on her head while standing on only her left foot.]
MR. GARRISON
Alright, let's try it again.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
"Children, we are now going to do math problems."
MR. GARRISON
"But teacher, I don't want to do my math problems."
MS. CHOKSONDIK
"Uuh! Ah, you will do them or else you'll be in very big trouble!"
MR. GARRISON
"Well, I'm not gong' to do it, teacher! You can just suck my balls!"
MS. CHOKSONDIK
"Don't use that kind of language, young man!"
MR. GARRISON
NOOO![Ms. Choksondik drops the books in terror]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[drops the books in terror] No??
MR. GARRISON
Look, you can't counter a profane command with an idle threat! You must extinguish it with a vulgar suggestion! When a child says, "Suck my balls," you say, "Present them."
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Oh.
MR. GARRISON
Now, let's try it again. [gathers the books up and repositions them on Ms. Choksondik's hands and head, then stands to her left. She resumes balancing on her left foot and concentrates.] SUCK MY BALLS!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Pre-sent them?
MR. GARRISON
[softens] Good. [Ms. Choksondik relaxes a bit and opens her eyes] Very good. [with authority] You're ready to move on to the next level. But I warn you: we will now be diving deep into your own psyche. These children know what scares you, and so we, too, must face those demons.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
I'm ready. I'm not afraid.
MR. GARRISON
[ominously, gruffly] You will be! You will be! [coughs] You will be.
[South Park, a house. Eight boys approach it: Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Butters, Kevin, Tolkien, Tweek, and Clyde. Stan knocks]
STAN
God-damnit, this is ridiculous.
NERD #2
[opens the door angrily] What?!
STAN
Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade?
NERD #2
Look! There aren't 73 episodes of Star Trek, there are 72! "The Menagerie" was a 2-parter that counts as one episode! Pizza-face is wrong!
CARTMAN
Who the hell cares?!
NERD #2
I know! Why does he have to be such a dick about it?!
KYLE
Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?
NERD #2
No, because he's WRONG!
KYLE
Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!
NERD #2
And live in a world of 72 original Star Treks? I don't think so! I don't want to live in that world. [slams the door shut]
CARTMAN
God, these guys are such geek dumbasses!
STAN
I know.
BUTTERS
Yeh-hah. They don't even realize that "The Menagerie" originally was the pilot and later got split up into two episodes, eh ha ha. Ha ha. [pauses to see if anyone responds] Hahahaha, eh the, eh the dumbasses.
STAN
Wait a minute! I've got it. [knocks again]
NERD #2
[opens the door angrily] What?!
STAN
Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were!
NERD #2
[thinks for a moment] Dude, Jesus, you're right.
[South Park, the "Matterhorn." Mr. Garrison takes Ms. Choksondik to a gnarled, giant willow tree on a mountainside forest]
MR. GARRISON
This is it: The Tree of Insight. You must go in and face what lives inside.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
What lives inside?
MR. GARRISON
Hell if I know. I wouldn't go in there.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Oh, alrighty. [enters the base of the tree and through the hewn hallway, then sees a light at the other end.] What the? Why there's nothing in here but an exit to the other side! [peers through it, then pulls back] There's nothing in here at all. ...Oh, and I actually thought my mental demons would be in here. [thinks for a moment] Wait a minute. Maybe there's not supposed to be anything in here. Maybe I'm supposed to see that I alone do have the strength to reach the kids! [clenches her fists] I think I get it now! [walks out the other end]
MR. GARRISON
[bides his time and sighs] Hey, hurry up in there! [under his breath] Jesus. [knocks on the tree entrance] You're taking too long in the damn Tree of Insight! [looks at the entrance, then looks in] You in there?! [enters the hallway himself] Hey, where the hell did she go? [a few more steps, and rumbling begins] What the? [the entrance closes and a mirror Garrison, clean-shaven, appears. The unkempt Garrison shivers] Haaa! Who? Who are you?
CLEAN GARRISON
[surely] I am you. [approaches the unkempt Garrison] I am your gay side.
UNKEMPT GARRISON
My gay side, uh- I DON'T HAVE A GAY SIDE!!!
CLEAN GARRISON
You must face me at last. [the two of them just stare at each other]
[South Park, the "Matterhorn," moments later...]
UNKEMPT GARRISON
You aren't real! You can't be!
CLEAN GARRISON
It is me, your darkest fear. Your gay self, incarnate.
UNKEMPT GARRISON
What do you want?
CLEAN GARRISON
I want you to not fight me anymore. To accept me, once and for all.
UNKEMPT GARRISON
Why?
CLEAN GARRISON
Don't you see? [approached the unkempt one] All these years, your pain, your confusion, it comes from one place. Your denial of who you are. [his voice softens] Of who... we are.
UNKEMPT GARRISON
But I'm not gay! Everyone just thinks I am!
CLEAN GARRISON
Oh, stop it! What about the time you looked at Counselor Mackey's penis in the men's locker room?!
UNKEMPT GARRISON
I was just comparing size!
CLEAN GARRISON
For seven minutes?!
UNKEMPT GARRISON
Aaa! [turns away in despair]
CLEAN GARRISON
And what about the time you masturbated to the men's 100-meter swimming relay at the Olympics?!
UNKEMPT GARRISON
I was beating off to the chicks!
CLEAN GARRISON
THERE WERE NO CHICKS!
UNKEMPT GARRISON
OH, DAMN YOU SPIRIT! HAUNT ME NO LONGER!
CLEAN GARRISON
ADMIT IT!
UNKEMPT GARRISON
NO!!!
CLEAN GARRISON
YOU HAVE TO STOP LYING TO YOURSELF AND GET A G-
UNKEMPT GARRISON
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, I ADMIT IT! I'M GAY!!! [camera zooms in as Garrison comes to terms with this admission] I'm...gay. I'm gay! [rises] I am gay! You hear that everyone? [goes towards the exit] I'm gay! I'm gay! I'm gay and it... [gets emotional] and it feels good.
[South Park Elementary, Ms. Choksondik's classroom, a few days later. Where the chalkboard used to be are just some boards hastily put up, along with a DO NOT CROSS line and three safety cones to guard this makeshift board.]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright, children, I hope you all did your- [the class once again has goggles on and the two nerds are back together in the back of the class ready to activate another machine --- a microwave oven with a duck tied to it.] Oowhat is going on now?! [three kittens run up and frolic near her breasts]
CARTMAN
Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[cups her ears] Oh Good Gravy, not this again.
CARTMAN
Yes! We've had a new time machine built: this one out of a simple microwave oven and a duck [the contraption is shown and the duck quacks.] Au revoir, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in the past, hahaa. Gentlemen? [the nerds activate their controllers]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Children, I will have order!!
NERD #1
I can't wait for Gene Roddenberry to tell you how WRONG you are! Just like when you said there were no two-parters of Battlestar Galactica!
NERD #2
There WEREN'T!
NERD #1
The episode called "Gonzo on Ice Planet Zero" was a two-parter.
NERD #2
No it WASN'T!
STAN
Oh, son of a bitch!
NERD #1
I'll kill you! [the nerds start slapping each other again. Nerd #2 throws his controller at Nerd #1, and the controller hits the floor. The microwave is activated and soon blows up along with the bird, leaving behind a portal]
CARTMAN
There it is! Come on, everybody! [the kids move towards the portal]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Children, get back into your seats!
CARTMAN
No way, lady!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Eric, I mean it!
CARTMAN
You can suck my balls!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[strikes a meditative pose as the camera does some vertigo, then] Present them. [everyone stops what they're doing and looks at her. Nerd #2 was about to strike Nerd #1 with a desk.]
CARTMAN
...What?
MS. CHOKSONDIK
You said, "suck my balls." Well, go ahead. Whip 'em out, and I'll suck 'em.
STAN
[softly] Thah... That's what Mr. Garrison would've said.
CARTMAN
Touché, teacher. Touché.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Now, children, listen to me. Why do you want to go back in time? Life isn't about going back, it's about going forward. Yes, there are times in our life that we wish we could relive, but, if we already lived them perfectly, why live them again? The adventure of life is that there's always something new. New challenges, new experiences. A fun game is a game that gets harder as it goes. So it is with life. Do you understand?
STAN
Dude. Sh-she's right.
KYLE
Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either.
STAN
Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?!
KYLE
Yeah! You suck, Cartman! [the kids return to their seats, leaving Cartman alone]
CARTMAN
What??
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright, students, that will be quite enough! If you're ready, let's continue on... with the fourth grade. [as she turns to write her name on the makeshift board, a noise is heard]
TIMMY
AAAAAAA! [reappears covered in items from every time period in history]
KYLE
Hey, Timmy's back!
STAN
Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us.
TIMMY
[shifts a bit here and there] Eh, Timmih.
[South Park Elementary, Principal's office. Chef talks with Mr. Mackey and Principal Victoria]
CHEF
You know I'm always here to help, Principal Victoria. [the door opens]
MR. GARRISON
[skips in happily] Ey, guess what everybody?! I'M GAY!!! [the other three look]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Mr. Garrison?
MR. MACKEY
What?
MR. GARRISON
I'm as gay as a gymnast on shore leave!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
You admit it? You admit it! [the three of them gather around him smiling]
MR. MACKEY
Oh, that's great, Mr. Garrison. You've finally come to terms with yourself!
MR. GARRISON
[fairly bouncing with joy] Yeah, it feels really good!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, congratulations!
MR. MACKEY
Yeah, congratulations!
MR. GARRISON
You know, I, I feel like I can start anew. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go back to teaching the third grade!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh. I'm sorry, we don't hire gay people. [silence, then Chef, Mr. Mackey, and Principal Victoria laugh as Mr. Garrison stews]
End of Fourth Grade


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:When he finally stops bragging about his new Trapper Keeper, a stranger informs him that it will eventually take over the world and destroy humankind, if they don't destroy it first.

script:Trapper Keeper

[Bus Stop. Stan and Kenny wait patiently. Kyle and Ike walk up. Ike is dressed in a little business suit and his hair is combed]
STAN
Dude, what's your little brother doing here?
KYLE
Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten.
STAN
But isn't he only three years old?
KYLE
Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten.
IKE
I pooped my pants.
KYLE
[moves Ike aside and shows his folder] But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper. [opens it up and displays the inside] It has five different compartments for each subject in school, [closes it and shows off the covers] and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek.
STAN
Cool!
CARTMAN
[walks up with his own folder] Hey, dudes. Check out my sweet Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Ultra Keeper Futura 2000. [slight pause. Kyle reacts angrily] Yeah, well, [opens his up] it's got ten different compartments for every subject in school, an electronic pencil sharpener, four plastic bags with electronic zippers, copy machine, fax, a better picture of Dawson's Creek on the back than Kyle's, [opens it up again] flat-screen TV, and of course, OnStar.
STAN
Wow, cool!
KYLE
Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!
CARTMAN
Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase.
KYLE
He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!
CARTMAN
He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag.
IKE
I pooped my pants!
KYLE
He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--
CARTMAN
Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume. [soft music plays and Cartman starts to dance]
KYLE
Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman! [music continues, and the bus rolls up]
[School bus. The boys take their seats. Cartman and Kenny sit behind Kyle, Stan, and Ike. Stan, Kyle and Kenny notice a disheveled man on the other side of the bus]
STAN
Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus.
MS. CRABTREE
Sit down and shut up!!
STAN
But they smell like pee.
MAN
[in European accent] I am not a homeless person. I am a new fourth-grade student.
KYLE
You are?
MAN
Yes! My name is Bill. Bill Cosby.
STAN
Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?
BILL
I was held back ten human grades. [grimaces and grunts] I mean, grades. Do you companion-friends know Eric Cartman?
CARTMAN
Yeah, that's me.
BILL
Eric Cartman? And you have a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000?
CARTMAN
Yeahhh, you already know about it?
BILL
Yes. Yes, I do.
CARTMAN
Well... [mocking] "Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!"
KYLE
I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!
STAN
Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?
KYLE
No, I don't! I don't care!
CARTMAN
[stick the notebook out] Here, Kyle. [Bill stares at Cartman's Trapper Keeper]
[South Park Elementary, kindergarten room. The room appears festive, the wall adorned with a beaming sun with rays coming from it, rolling hills with trees here and there. The kids enter and take their places at the round table. Two miffed boys stand by the door as Ike enters the room]
BOY #1
Hey, there he is. That's the kid that's s'posed to be some kind of genius.
BOY #2
Yeah, he's only three and he's already in kindergarten.
BOY #1
Come on. [the two boys walk up to Ike and sit on the chairs on either side of him] So, you think you're smarter than the rest of us? Do you think you know more about the world just because you are only 3 and we're 5?
IKE
Unkoo baba.
MR. GARRISON
[enters the room] Okay, children, let's take our seats. [closes the door and approaches the table] My name is Mr. Garrison, and I'm the new kindergarten teacher. I used to be the third grade teacher, but I had a little [wags the index and ring finger of each hand] "nervous breakdown" and went into the mountains where I lived off of "rat carcasses". [a view of some of the kids' reactions] But I'm all better now, and the school was nice enough to let me go on teaching, as long as it was for kindergarten. [a view of other kids' reactions] But it's not a demotion. No. I mean, just because a teacher was teaching third grade and now is teaching kindergarten, that's not a demotion, is it? [the kids look confused] No, that's right, it's not. Well, let's start with roll call. Uh, let's see. Filmore Anderson?
FILMORE
Here.
MR. GARRISON
Sally Bands?
SALLY
Here.
MR. GARRISON
Ike Broflovski?
IKE
Cookie Monster.
MR. GARRISON
Broflovski, I had your older brother Kyle in my third-grade class. He's a very smart kid. I'm sure you are, too. [Fillmore and his friend glare at Ike] Well that's bad news for everybody else, because I will be grading you all on a curve. [Ike looks at Filmore and friend and starts to sink in his seat]
[South Park Elementary, fourth grade room. The class is present, along with "Bill Cosby" Cartman elaborates on the wonderful attributes of his Trapper Keeper]
CARTMAN
And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically. [Kyle glares at him with arms crossed.] I can take something as simple as this calculator [a Wellington Bear model] and... Trapper Keeper?
TRAPPER KEEPER
[its TV screen turns on] Trapper Keeper active.
CARTMAN
Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator.
TRAPPER KEEPER
Ready for hybrid. [Two cables reach out and grab the calculator and pull it into a ready slot. Cartman closes the Trapper Keeper]
CARTMAN
And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too.
KIDS
Wow.
BILL
[reaches over Cartman's shoulder] May I hold your Trapper Keeper?
CARTMAN
Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers. [wiggles them outstretched] If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands.
KYLE
Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!
CARTMAN
Oh really? [hands the folder over to Kyle] Then, why don't you hold it? [Kyle looks at it in Cartman's outstretched hand.] Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it. [inches closer and whispers] Hold it.
KYLE
I'm gonna!
CARTMAN
[inches closer and whispers] Hold it.
KYLE
I will!
[South Park Elementary, kindergarten room. Mr. Garrison is telling his life story to the kids]
MR. GARRISON
And that's how the relationship with my father sort of ended. There's still some sort of skeletons in the closet, but things between us are a little better. [some of the kids are stunned. Garrison starts writing on the board] Okay, children, well now it's time for us to elect a class president, [writes up "KINDERGARTEN CLASS PRESIDENT" on the chalkboard and underlines it] so first we must pick nominees. [turns and faces the class] Who would like to nominate someone?
BOY #2
I nominate Filmore, because he's the smartest kid in the class.
MR. GARRISON
Okay, Filmore. [writes the name on the board] You'll be our first nominee. And who else? [a girl raises her hand] Yes, Jenny.
JENNY
I gotta go doodie.
MR. GARRISON
In a minute, Jenny. Who else wants to nominate a class president? [the kids stay quiet] Oh, come on! You can't have an election with just one person running! What's the fun in that? Ike? How about you? You're a genius.
IKE
[looks at an angry Fillmore and friend] No.
MR. GARRISON
Okay, our second nominee is Ike the genius. [writes the name up on the board. Filmore and friend stare at a chagrined Ike] Okay, children, now we'll hear briefly from each nominee. Filmore, why don't you go first?
FILMORE
[leaves his seat, approaches the board, and faces the class] If I'm elected class president, I'll call for big ol' chairs. And on Fridays, I'll add two minutes to nap time. Thank you. [returns to his seat]
MR. GARRISON
Very enthralling. Okay, Ike? How about you?
IKE
[leaves his seat, approaches the board, and faces the class] Cookie Monster. Ice.
MR. GARRISON
...Well, this is gonna be a tough one, kids.
[South Park Elementary, playground. The four boys stand around the tetherball pole while two kids in front of them toss a football, two girls walk by behind them, another kid climbs the jungle gym, and another rocks on a hobby elephant]
STAN
Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid.
BILL
Ahhh, hello Eric. Can I be your human friend? [winces] I mean, friend?
CARTMAN
I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once.
BILL
Please. We can have fun and play games, like human four square-- [coughs up] I mean, four square.
CARTMAN
Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me.
BIL
Oh, I see. Alright, I'll pay 100 geliga stones-- Uh, I mean, human dollars! Eugh, I mean dollars!
CARTMAN
Okay, that's cool.
BIL
[holds up the tetherball] Can we play some human tetherball?
CARTMAN
A-alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some-- [by this time, "Bill" has pulled away from the pole and Cartman, and has the tether taut and ready to release]
BIL
Serve! [whips the ball at Cartman, knocking him onto his back. The Trapper Keeper falls away and lands next to Kenny. "Bill" makes his move]
CARTMAN
Ugh..! ["Bill" goes after the Trapper Keeper and runs away with it]
BIL
Got it!
CARTMAN
Ey!
STAN
Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper! [just then, spikes come out of the Trapper Keeper and some of them go clear through "Bill's" hands.]
BILL
[stops and looks at his pierced hands] Waa-agggh! [clenches his teeth and continues running]
CARTMAN
You son of a bitch! [recalls something] Wait a minute. [whips out a small gadget and activates it] Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper homing device. [walks towards the source of the sound heard in the device and away from his friends]
STAN
[confused] What the hell just happened?
KYLE
[angry] Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different.
[South Park Elementary, Kindergarten. Mr. Garrison tallies up the votes so far on the board...]
MR. GARRISON
So that's six votes for Filmore and six votes for Ike. [sets the chalk down and reads the last ballot] And the last vote is for... Uh, let's see. Flora, I can't tell who you voted for. [Flora, a timid, pretty blond girl trying to bury her face into her laps, which are raised up on the chair, is shown] You've got the winning vote, Flora. Who d'you pick?
FLORA
I don't know... [smiles and looks down and away]
MR. GARRISON
Flora, you have to pick one. Filmore or Ike?
FLORA
Um, I vote for... I don't know.
MR. GARRISON
Oh, great! Flora's undecided! Well, you're just gonna have to sit there, Flora, and think about it until you come up with an answer.
FLORA
Okay.
BOY #
Flora, just say you vote for Filmore so we can all go home.
FLORA
Um...
SALLY
No! You want Ike to be president.
FILMORE
We're gonna be here all night! Why don't you guys just concede?
TWO KIDS
Yeah!
SALLY
Why don't you just concede?
OTHER KIDS
Yeah! [the kids start to argue]
SOME KIDS
Filmore!
OTHER KIDS
Ike!
GIRL
I want Ike to be president! [several kids from Filmore's side rush across the table to kids on Ike's side]
MR. GARRISON
Oh, for Christ's sakes, you're all acting like a bunch o' kids!
[South Park, day. A police car zooms down the street. Officer Barbrady flies down the road in the police cruiser with Cartman in the passenger seat and Stan, Kyle, and Kenny in the back seat. Cartman has the Trapper Tracker Keeper in his hand and is following the Trapper Keeper's signal on the Tracker's screen]
CARTMAN
Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready!
BARBRADY
Eric, I'm not gonna shoot anybody for taking your school folder.
CARTMAN
[grabs Barbrady's ] It was not a school folder, it was a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000! And if-- [spots "Bill"] There he is!
BILL
[turns to see the cruiser coming his way] Wagh!
CARTMAN
Got ya! [grabs the steering wheel from Barbrady]
BARBRADY
Hey! [Cartman steers the cruiser into a building, crushing "Bill" and rattling the building]
BILL
Gaagghhh! [crumples to the floor. Barbrady and the others exit the car and gather at Bill. His left arm has been amputated, revealing functioning wires. The lower half holding the Trapper Keeper in hand. Barbrady and the boys stare in shock]
KYLE
Whoa, dude..!
[End of act one. Time: 7:50]
[same time, later...]
CARTMAN
Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you?
BILL
Please. You do not understand.
CARTMAN
[takes his place] Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done.
BILL
[plaintive] That Trapper Keeper has to be destroyed!
STAN
Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?
BARBRADY
Bill Cosby?
BILL
Nooo! Listen to me! I am not really Bill Cosby. [the boys and Barbrady show shock] My name is BSM-471. I am a cyborg engineered by humans from the year 2034.
BARBRADY
Well, I knew you weren't Bill Cosby!
BSM-471
I have come to destroy that Trapper Keeper, because it was the Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper that belongs to an Eric Cartman in South Park which three years from now manifests itself into an omnipotent super being, and destroys all of humanity. In the year 2004, a hybrid-assimilating computer linked with a satellite uplink computer. From there it was able to slowly take over every computer in the world. [cables reach out from the Trapper Keeper and engulf two computers. The process continues engulfing all of the US] It became stronger and stronger, until by the year 2018 it broke away from mankind [skulls litter the landscape] and there was nothing the humans could do. [in the distance a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper tower rises] It wasn't long before Mighty Trapper Keeper started to destroy everything it saw as useless, including humans. [people are shot left and right from the Trapper Keeper's weapons] The nations tried everything to stop it. [troops line up and fire at the Trapper Keeper] Nuclear devices, seismic missiles. But nothing worked. [robotic tanks come into view, firing away at the Trapper Keeper] The humans built robots of their own, whole armies of them. [DC TK209s approach the advancing armies and fire at them] But nothing was strong enough to stop Trapper Keeper. [the battle scene fades, and BSM-471 is shown once again on the ground] And so finally, the humans decided to send one of their robots into the past to destroy the Trapper Keeper before it even got started.
STAN
Wow, that's amazing.
KYLE
Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast.
STAN
What do you think, Officer Barbrady?
BARBRADY
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
BSM-471
And so, Eric. Now you see why we must destroy your Trapper Keeper.
CARTMAN
[long pause] You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener?
STAN
Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!
CARTMAN
What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!
STAN
Yes!
CARTMAN
Aw, damnit! [throws his Trapper Keeper to the ground] Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes! [walks off to his left sadly]
[South Park Elementary, kindergarten. The class is looking at Flora. Mr. Garrison sits on a chair looking bored]
FLORA
I decided.
MR. GARRISON
[jumps up] Oh, thank God, Flora! [gets ready to write] Alright, who do you vote for?
FLORA
Umm... Ike.
SUPPORTERS
Yay!
MR. GARRISON
[adds the tally to Ike's total] Okay, so then the total is six for Filmore and now seven votes for Ike. Ike is the new class president.
FILMORE
We want a recount.
MR. GARRISON
[miffed] What?
FILMORE'S SUPPORTERS
Recount! Recount! Recount! Recount!
MR. GARRISON
Oh, of all the juvenile things I've ever heard! You lost, Filmore! Don't be such a baby! [Filmore cries and throws a tantrum, pounding away on the classroom table] Alright, alright, I'll count up the ballots again. Okay, we had one vote for Filmore... [writes Filmore's name on the board. A time lapse shows him writing on a crowded board now] ...And this time, I again get six votes for Filmore and seven votes for Ike.
FILMORE
Count them again.
SUPPORTERS
Yeah!
MR. GARRISON
No, children! I've recounted 106 times now and I keep coming up with seven to six! Except in the one instance where it came out seven to five, and one where it came out twelve to fourteen. It's over! Ike is class president!
KID #2
Wait, there's still that absent kid.
FILLMORE
Yeah. If Carlos is absent, we have to wait for his vote.
MR. GARRISON
Oh, will you grow up?!
SUPPORTERS
[clamoring] Absent kids count! Absent kids count! Absent kids count!
MR. GARRISON
Jesus..! Alright, we'll wait for tomorrow so the absent kid can cast his vote. Now go home! [the kids leave]
[South Park Elementary, hallway, next day.]
BSM-471
Good morning, humans.
STAN/KYLE
Hey, Bill Cosby.
BSM-471
I have successfully destroyed Eric Cartman's Trapper Keeper. I broke it apart, dipped the motherboards in acid, burned the memory chips, and sent the wiring to the four corners of Canada.
KYLE
That should do it.
STAN
So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?
BSM-471
Well, that is a problem that is causing me some disconcernment. I am still here, but I shouldn't be here. If Trapper Keeper has been stopped, then I should not exist. But here I am. Something is still not right.
CARTMAN
[walks up with another Trapper Keeper] Hey, dudes.
STAN
Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper!
CARTMAN
Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one! [holds it up high] So everything worked out.
BSM-471
[frightened] Oh no!
KYLE
Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!
CARTMAN
Why the hell not?!
STAN
Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!
CARTMAN
Wait... so then you guys burned my last one for no reason!
BSM-471
We will have to destroy this Trapper Keeper.
CARTMAN
[holds his Trapper Keeper close] But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.
KYLE
Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass!
CARTMAN
Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what else? Screw you guys. I'm going home. [moves off to his left]
STAN
Cartman!
CARTMAN
Ech! Screw you guys. Home. [walks away]
BSM-471
Well, that does it! [pull out a pocket phaser from his overcoat and aims it at Cartman]
KYLE
Hey! What are you doing?
BSM-471
I'm afraid I have no other choice. [pulls the phaser back] For the sake of humanity, I have to kill him.
KYLE
Oh... Okay.
STAN
Yeah, that's fine. ["Bill" aims the phaser once again] No, wait!
BSM-471
What?
STAN
Can I do it?
BSM-471
Oh, well, I suppose. [tosses the phaser to Stan]
STAN
[takes it and quickly aims] Sweet! Kiss your ass goodbye, fat boy!
BSM-471
Wait! [grabs it back] Perhaps there is another way. If you could take me to where Eric Cartman lives, I could try reasoning with his human mother.
STAN
Well, yeah, or we could just kill him.
KYLE
Yeah, that'd be faster.
STAN
He's right there.
BSM-471
I'm afraid I can't. I think I'm actually starting to feel what you humons call "compassion". It is an amazing feeling!
STAN/KYLE/ KENNY
Awww..!
[South Park Elementary, kindergarten. Mr. Garrison stands before the class and begins to speak]
MR. GARRISON
Alright children, as you know, we've been waiting for the absent kid's ballot to come in. Well, his mother was nice enough to bring him in from the hospital so that he could cast his vote. Ms. Harris? [she walks in with a little boy attached to IV bag on a pole. The kid hands him the ballot and coughs out an organ] Thank you very much, Billy. Don't forget to pick up your lung. [Billy starts to walk away, then stops to pick it up] Alright, the absent kid's ballot is for... [reads] Filmore.
SUPPORTERS
Yay./Hooray. [Mr. Garrison adds Billy's vote to Filmore's tally]
SALLY
Wait one minute!
MR. GARRISON
Oh, Jesus tap-dancing Christ.
SALLY
I think the ballot were misleading. Some kids didn't understand whom they were voting for.
MR. GARRISON
There's a box next to Filmore's name and a box next to Ike's! What's not to understand?
FILMORE
[pointing at Sally] You're just saying that, 'cause you know you're gonna lose now.
SALLY
No, I'm saying that because you are a boogerface!
FILMORE
Well, just you wait, 'cause my famous aunt is on huh way right now.
MR. GARRISON
Who's your famous aunt?
FILMORE
My aunt Rosie, Rosie O'Donnell.
MR. GARRISON
Your aunt Rosie O'Donnell is coming here?
FILMORE
Yeah, she's very active in politics. So she's gonna set all this straight.
MR. GARRISON
[resigned] Oh no..!
[Cartman residence, day, Cartman's room. Cartman sets the Trapper Keeper in a tray, then secures it onto a docking bay and plugs a cable into it]
TRAPPER KEEPER
Recharging.
CARTMAN
Sweet. You're so cool, Trapper Keeper. I would never let those assholes take you away.
[singing his own Dawson's Creek theme song] I don't wanna wait for my Trapper Keeper to be over
The ways of my Trap--
TRAPPER KEEPER
Trapper Keeper ready to ensorb. [cables reach out and grab Cartman's computer like a giant hand, and pull it towards the Trapper Keeper]
CARTMAN
Oh, cool.
TRAPPER KEEPER
Trapper Keeper, merging. [cables reach out and grab a lamp and a Wellington Bear desk clock]
CARTMAN
[softly] Whoa...
[End of act two. Time: 13:59]
[Cartman residence, day, dining room. "Bill" is seated at the head of the table, with Liane and Kenny to his right, and Stan and Kyle to his left]
BSM-471
And so you see, Ms. Cartman, you cannot buy your son Eric another Trapper Keeper. Not now! Not ever!
LIANE
Right, because it will hybrid with all those other processors and generate a whole new era of technological darkness.
BSM-471
Correct.
LIANE
Well, I certainly won't buy him anymore, then... Bill. [starts flirting with him]
BSM-471
Good. Now all that is left to do is destroy the Trapper Keeper Eric has now. Where is he?
LIANE
In his room. But, why don't I show you the rest of the house first? [pulls "Bill" from the chair]
STAN
Uh-oh.
KYLE
Here we go again.
LIANE
Come this way, Billy. [takes him away from the table]
STAN
Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves. [he and Kenny leave the table, with Kyle following]
[Cartman's room. Cartman is getting friendly with his Trapper Keeper]
CARTMAN
Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass!
I don't wanna let my Trapper Keeper get--
STAN
[knocks on the door] Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper! [Cartman hops off his chair and dances to the door. He locks it and continues singing]
CARTMAN
Screw you guys, screw you guys
Screw you guys, scr--
TRAPPER KEEPER
Trapper Keeper, ready to ensorb.
CARTMAN
Huh? [walks towards his computer]
KYLE
[in the hallway, pounds on the door] Dammit, Cartman, open up!
TRAPPER KEEPER
Trapper Keeper, ready for hybrid.
CARTMAN
Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with now? [cables come from the monitor and grab him] Ugh--!
STAN
[pounds on the door] Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom. [he and Kyle now notice the groans coming from the room]
KYLE
Cartman? [inside, cables wrap tight around his face and go in, transforming his body into a grotesque hybrid, and the hybrid begins to grow] He's not gonna open it. Break it down.
STAN
You break it down!
KYLE
Okay. Ready? One, two, three, not it!
STAN
Not it! You lose, Kenny. [he and Kyle quickly step out of the way]
KENNY
(Awww..!) [goes to the far wall and then rushes the door, only to be plastered against the far wall...] (Argh--!) [...by the unhinged bedroom door being pushed out by the evolving Trapper Keeper. The boys are frozen in place with mouths open]
STAN
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
KYLE
You ba--! [the boys make a run for it down the hall and down the stairs as the Trapper Keeper oozes out of Cartman's room]
[Cartman residence, outside. The front door opens and Stan and Kyle rush outside and away]
STAN/KYLE
Agggghhh! [the Trapper Keeper bursts through every window in the house and then the house begins to crumble around it. It collapses in on itself. moves away from the house, leaving "Bill" and Liane in bed fully exposed to the elements]
LIANE
[on top] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!
[South Park Elementary, kindergarten. Mr. Garrison sits with the class around the table and hears some ominous noise]
MR. GARRISON
What the hell is that? [walks to the window and looks out] Oh my God! What is that thing? Children, there's some huge bulbous monstrosity heading for the classroom! [some of the kids slink down in their seats] Oh my God, it's awful! It's coming for the door. [the doorknob turns and the kindergartners crouch in terror]
ROSIE O'DONNELL
Hello, kids!
FILMORE
Aunt Rosie!
MR. GARRISON
[in a panic] Run for your lives, children! [grabs a bat] I'll try to fight it off!
FILMORE
That's my aunt, Rosie O'Donnell.
MR. GARRISON
Oh. Oh, um... Pleasure to meet you, Miss Donnell. You're looking... well.
ROSIE O'DONNELL
Don't worry, kids. Everything's gonna be fine. What's the problem?
FILMORE
Aunt Rosie. We think I won class president.
IKE SUPPORTER
No, Ike won.
MR. GARRISON
Look, it's very simple. We took a vote and the vote tied, so now we gotta come up with a way--
ROSIE O'DONNELL
Well it obviously isn't that simple, is it? I mean, you'd think a little kindergarten teacher could've handled this, but now we're gonna do it my way!
[South Park, outskirts. The Trapper Keeper enters the scene and demolishes the sign]
TRAPPER KEEPER
[now with Cartman's voice] We are Trapper Keeper.
BSM-471
[on a bluff with Stan and Kyle looking at the Trapper Keeper leave town] Oh no! It is heading for Cheyenne Mountain!
KYLE
Why is that bad?
BSM-471
It was when the Trapper Keeper assimilated with the supercomputer at Cheyenne Mountain that it was able to fuse into all defensive computers!
STAN
Then we have to stop it before it gets there! [leads the others off the bluff and onto a waiting cruiser. "Bill" takes the wheel and Kyle takes the passenger window seat]
KYLE
Step on it, Bill Cosby! ["Bill" starts the cruiser and drives off]
[The road to Cheyenne Mountain. All is quiet. Two security guards wait at the entrance reading newspapers. The one wearing glasses looks up]
GUARD 2
Hey, Mark, look.
MARK
Wow. That is about the nicest Trapper Keeper I've ever seen. [a police siren is heard, and promptly "Bill" arrives with Stan and Kyle. They hop out of the car and face the Trapper Keeper]
STAN
Cartman, you have to stop!
TRAPPER KEEPER
We are Trapper Keeper. We are one.
BSM-471
A part of your friend must still be alive in there. [the three of them study the Trapper Keeper from a distance until Stan finds a ventilation hose coming out of it. Smoke comes out of it, and a fart is heard]
STAN
He is in there.
BSM-471
That must be what Trapper Keeper is using for ventilation. If one of you could get in there, you could reach the CPU.
STAN
One-two-three, not it!
KYLE
Not-- Aw, damnit..! [walks up to the hissing hose and climbs in]
[Interior. Kyle makes his way in and scrambles through a field of organs until he reaches the memory core. The valves open up and suck Kyle into the core. Kyle floats through the core, à la 2001: A Space Odyssey']
CARTMAN
[à la HAL 9000] What are you doing, Kyle?
KYLE
I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU.
CARTMAN
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle.
KYLE
Screw you, fat ass!
CARTMAN
Hey, screw you.
KYLE
Cartman! [hits a wall with a wrench]
CARTMAN
Agh--! [four metallic arms from all directions reach out to trap him, then six more organic ones come in to secure him]
KYLE
No!
[South Park Elementary, kindergarten. The kids run around arguing with each other and carry signs]
ROSIE O'DONNELL
[sits on a chair with Filmore on her lap] Okay, so then what we're going to do is count everybody's vote by hand, and after that, we're gonna go over the votes again manually, and then--
MR. GARRISON
[throws a fit] Oh, stop it, stop it! Stop i-i-it! [the kids and Rosie look at him] Look kids, we're all in this kindergarten class together. We have to respect one another or else we're in for a terrible school year. [the kindergarteners looks at each other]
ROSIE O'DONNELL
[furiously] We're just making sure that the kids that voted for my nephew don't get cheated!
MR. GARRISON
Half the kids in the class didn't vote for your nephew, so what about them? You don't give a crap about them because they're not on your side! People like you preach tolerance and open-mindedness all the time, but when it comes to Middle America, you think we're all evil and stupid country yokels who need your political enlightenment! [Rosie goes offended upon hearing this] Well, just because you're on TV doesn't mean you know crap about the government! Now get your ass back on first class and respect this class's right to make up their own minds! [the kindergarteners gasp] ...Oh, sorry I got a little off the subject there, kids.
ROSIE O'DONNELL
[stands up throwing Filmore off] How dare you! I will not be preached at by a country bumpkin! [heads for the door and stands at the entrance] I'm leaving this Podunk town, but in my place I'm gonna send more lawyers, statesmen and press than you have ever seen! [exits and slams the door shut]
MR. GARRISON
Oh no, children, I think I've just made this a whole lot worse.
[End of act three. Time: 18:58]
[South Park, a red sunset. A picture of the four main characters of Dawson's Creek is present. Camera zooms out, revealing Trapper Keeper covering Cheyenne Mountain. A slimy appendage reaches out and grabs a phone both next to two ladies]
LADIES
Aaghh! [hurry away. The Trapper Keeper absorbs the phone booth, and another of its appendages goes after a police car]
COPS
Wagghh! [hurry away. In the distance "Bill," the two security guards, and Stan watch Trapper Keeper get bigger and bigger. Behind them, the rest of South Park gathers and sees the spectacle]
MARK
Well that does it. I'm gonna have to report this. [whips out a walkie-talkie and starts] Car one to base-- [another appendage reaches down and pulls him up and away] Aghh! [Trapper Keeper swallows him up]
BSM-471
It is infusing with everything. It is already too powerful to stop!
STAN
Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.
[Interior. Kyle struggles to make his way out of the little situation he's in]
KYLE
I can't reach the CPU.
[Cheyenne Mountain, outside. A limo speeds up to the scene and encounters the Trapper Keeper, which is beginning to look like the tower in "Bill"'s prophecy. Rosie O'Donnell pops out and walks up to it]
ROSIE
What are you doin'?! Get out of my way!
GUARD 2
Oh, no! Now there's two of those things!
STAN
No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell. [an indecisive appendage hovers over Rosie]
GUARD 2
Huh? Which one? I-It's just like I'm seeing double.
ROSIE
[to Trapper Keeper] I said, get out of my way! [another appendage wraps around her and tries to pull her in] Aaaaggghhhh!!! [Trapper Keeper swells and heaves, and the fleshy appendage swallows Rosie up] Ogh. Noo-- [the appendage pulls her up and into Trapper Keeper]
TRAPPER KEEPER
Eeww.
BSM-471
Look! I think that infusing with Rosie O'Donnell has made Trapper Keeper sick.
TRAPPER KEEPER
Oohh... Bad pie... Bad pie... [begins to deflate and wither. Its appendages wither and begin to drop off as it darkens]
STAN
This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!
[Interior. Cartman releases his hold on Kyle and Kyle drops to the floor. He quickly moves to the wall panel containing the CPU and pulls the CPU out along with some memory chips]
KYLE
Got 'em!
[Cheyenne Mountain, outside. Trapper Keeper turns into a big mass of goo, and Kyle and Cartman are spat out. Rosie ends up half-eaten. Everybody begins to approach Kyle and Cartman]
STAN
He did it!
[South Park Elementary, kindergarten. The kids are seated around the round table, and their lawyers stand behind them arguing. Mr. Garrison sits at the head of the table listening]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, the lawyers for Ike's side have agreed with the lawyers on Filmore's side to hold another meeting regarding Form 22F. Do we all have that form? [the door opens, and in walks...]
JESSE JACKSON
Is this the kindergarten classroom?
MR. GARRISON
Jesse Jackson?
JESSE JACKSON
That's right! I believe the African-American in your class were misrepresented!
MR. GARRISON
[covering his face] We don't have any African-Americans in our class!
JESSE JACKSON
Oh. Bye. [turns and walks out. Filmore raises his hand]
MR. GARRISON
Alright, so apparently what we're gonna do now is hand-count each person's ballot--
FILMORE
Mistoreh Garrison, I concede. [Mr. Garrison's jaw drops, as do those of Filmore's lawyers]
MR. GARRISON
You... yuh, you what?
FILMORE
I don't wanna play anymore, 'cause this game is stupid.
SALLY
Yeah. It doesn't make any sense.
FILMORE
Ike, you could be class president.
IKE
I pooped my pants!
SALLY
[throws up her hands] Can we fingerpaint now?
KIDS
[clamoring] Fingerpaint! Fingerpaint!
MR. GARRISON
Ohuh... Yes. [exults] Yes! Let's fingerpaint!
[Cheyenne Mountain. Stan and the others reach Cartman and Kyle]
STAN
You did it, Kyle! [to Cartman] Kyle saved your life, fat ass!
BSM-471
Look! I'm fading! [begins to fade from view] It must have worked. I don't exist! [disappears]
STAN
Huh, that's a bitch.
CARTMAN
Oh. Well, I guess everything's fine now. So let's go home.
STAN
Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!
CARTMAN
Awww, man...
STAN
Cartman!
CARTMAN
Alright, alright. [sighs] Kyle...
End of Trapper Keeper


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:When Butters informs the forth grader's that the Kindergarteners school play is a magnificent sight to behold, they go through a lot of pain to make sure they beat the tiny tots' show.

script:Helen Keller! The Musical

[Stage rehearsal, day. Stan, Kyle, and Wendy are in costume on stage. Stan is dressed in a white suit and bowtie, and a fake beard and mustache. Kyle is dressed as a country doctor with starched collar, and Wendy is dressed in white pants, purple coat and beret, and bowtie. The stage itself has a door prop and a tripod table with a bowl and jar atop it. Kyle enters through the door.]
WENDY
Doctor, doctor! Will our daughter be okay?
KYLE
I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak.
WENDY
Oh no! NO!
STAN
'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do.
WENDY
My poor little Helen.
TIMMY
[enters through the prop door in blue dress and wig, and holding a doll - Helen Keller!] Timmiihhh!
WENDY
She can't see or hear us, John.
TIMMY
Heh-aaaah, Timmih!
STAN
[very slurred - John Keller] E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh.
CARTMAN
[in the second front row, directing] Stan, what the hell is wrong with you? I can't understand your lines!
STAN
'Cause the 'eard 'urts my 'ace.
KYLE
Can we take a lunch break now?
CARTMAN
No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene!
BEBE
[enters the scene] Hello. My name is Anne Sullivan, and I believe I can teach this child to communicate.
STAN
Uh-eally? Uh you think so?
BEBE
[slaps some water from a pitcher into Timmy's right hand] Water, Helen! Waaa-terr!
TIMMY
Agh oh-ight, Timmih!
CARTMAN
God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't supposed to talk!
BUTTERS
[a camera follows him to the auditorium at butt level; another camera shows him entering the room] Hey you guys! We got a big problem! [rushes onto the stage]
KYLE
What is it, Butters?
BUTTERS
The kindergartners! I just came from their dress rehearsal. Hoh, it's good, you guys. It's real good!
CARTMAN
How good?
BUTTERS
They got Pilgrim outfits! And Indian ones, too! They've got singing and dancing and boy you've never seen such a show! Why, it's a Thanksgiving extravaganza!
CLYDE
Oh, no!
KYLE
We can't be outdone by the kindergartners!
CLYDE
Oh, now what?
STAN
Oh yeah, we can't!
CARTMAN
Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play!
KYLE
Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story.
CARTMAN
Yeah, but nobody told us how we had to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff and music numbers, too.
CLYDE
Well, we can add music numbers, but how do we make the Helen Keller story more Thanksgivingy?
WENDY
I know! How about, instead of a dog, Helen Keller has a pet turkey.
TOLKIEN
Yeah, a turkey that could do tricks.
KIDS
Yeah
CARTMAN
That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey!
KYLE
Okay!
CARTMAN
This is gonna be the best version of the Miracle Worker ever!
KIDS
Yay!
[a barn, with no snow around it. Cows are grazing on the grass outside. Inside, a rancher shows Timmy and Kyle around the barn.]
RANCHER
What kind of turkey are you lookin' for?
KYLE
A smart one, that can do tricks.
RANCHER
Well, I ain't got a whole lot left, it bein' almost Thanksgiving and all. [opens a turkey pen so the boys can see] Go ahead, just pick one out. [Timmy looks pleased, looks around, and settles on a deformed turkey which walks with its head against the ground]
TIMMY
[apparently having chosen his turkey] Timmaay! [the turkey blinks at him]
RANCHER
[notices the turkey] Oh, that one's a little messed up. Not exactly the... pick of the litter.
TIMMY
Haaaaa!
KYLE
Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed!
TIMMY
TIMMAY!
RANCHER
Yeah. Best you not take that one. I was just about to take it out in the yard and putt a bullet in its head.
KYLE
What?! Aw, dude, don't say that!
TIMMY
T-TIIMMAY TIMMAY!
KYLE
Alright, we'll take him. How much?
RANCHER
Fifty bucks.
KYLE
But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head!
RANCHER
I know! Now I gotta find somethin' else to shoot.
KYLE
[thinks] ...God-damnit, here! [the rancher takes the money, walks over to get the turkey, and delivers the turkey to Timmy] Alright, Timmy, let's go! [Kyle and Timmy leave]
RANCHER
I've got a one-legged pig if you'd like, too.
KYLE
Aw, blow it out your ass!
[The South Park Community Theatre. Here is where the class has been rehearsing for the play. The marquee reads: "THANKSGIVING EXTRAVAGANZA WEDNESDAY" Inside, Cartman has most of the kids on stage with a man...]
CARTMAN
Guys, I want you all to meet Jeffrey Maynard. He's South Park's biggest expert on musical theater, AND, he played the lead in Les Misérables at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks.
KIDS
[flatly] Bravo.
WENDY
Do you think we could make up a good Thanksgiving play in four days?
JEFFREY MAYNARD
[lyrically] I would swear it on my life. Your play shall want for nothing.
KIDS
Hooray!
JEFFREY MAYNARD
Now, the first thing a good musical needs is a big opening number. Something that sets up the entire show.
CARTMAN
Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in the turkey! [Timmy's turkey sidles in with its head on the ground. Kyle and Timmy follow] What the hell is that?
KYLE
It's a turkey. [long pause] His name is Gobbles.
TIMMY
GOBBLES! [Gobbles gobbles]
CARTMAN
And where... pray... is our beautiful trick performing turkey?
KYLE
Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one...
TIMMY
GOBBLES! [Gobbles gobbles]
CARTMAN
[looks at Kyle for a long time] Kyle, can I talk to you over here for a second? [they walk off to one side of the stage and stop, out of earshot] Kyle? Why do you do these things to me?
KYLE
I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?
CARTMAN
You say, "No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!"
KYLE
[the rest of the cast approaches] Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it.
?????
He's not gonna work, Kyle. The whole point was to make our play better than the kindergartners.
TOLKIEN
Yeah, that turkey sucks.
JEFFREY MAYNARD
[lyrically] Wait! What's that, you say? A thanksgiving turkey is what you require? I know of a turkey.
STAN
You do?
JEFFREY MAYNARD
[lyrically] During my years on Broadway I... worked with a turkey who could do all kinds of tricks. She even jumped through a hoop of fire.
CARTMAN
Cool! Can you get it for us?
JEFFREY MAYNARD
I will go promptly and call her trainer. On the morrow you shall have your trick performing turkey.
KIDS
Alright! [Timmy takes Gobbles and wheels off stage]
[South Park, Timmy's house, night. Timmy is in his room with a hula hoop in hand, sitting on the floor]
TIMMY
Gobbles! [shows him the hoop and points to it. Gobbles just blinks. Timmy tries again] Gobbles! [Gobbles blinks, then walks up to the hoop and lifts his head through it. Timmy is dismayed] Up, heh. Uh! [coaxes Gobbles through the hoop. Gobbles trips and falls out. Timmy grins] Heeey, Gobbles! [Gobbles gets up and walks away. Timmy pulls out a lighter and sets the hoop aflame] Gobbles. [Gobbles just stares and Timmy urges] Gobbles! [Gobbles poops]
[South Park, Cartman's house, night. Cartman is in his room rewriting a part of the play.]
CARTMAN
No no! [tosse another sheet over his shoulder, to join other wads on the floor. His mother enters the room]
LIANE
Boopsie-kins, It's late. You need to be in bed.
CARTMAN
I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write the lyrics for the opening song of our Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular!
LIANE
Now, hon!
CARTMAN
[whining a bit] But [turns around] Mo-o-om, I have to write these lyrics so the plight of Helen Keller can be realized by the common man.
LIANE
Twenty more minutes, and that's it. [exits and closes the door]
CARTMAN
[spins around and gets back to work] Twenty minutes! Does Tim Rice's mom give him twenty minutes to write the lyrics to "Phantom Of The Opera"?! [looks at a small portrait of Helen Keller on his desk, picks it up and studies it] Speak to me Helen. Let me be your voice. [after looking at the portrait some more, he gets frustrated and slams the portrait onto the desk] Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your spirit through me!
[South Park, Timmy's house. Timmy is in bed asleep. Soon, Gobbles hops up on the bed and drops his head on the covers. He slowly inches up to Timmy's face, looking at Timmy all the while, and settles in next to him. Gobbles soon falls asleep. Timmy's left hand comes to rest on Gobbles' body. An exterior shot with the moon low in the sky is shown and fades out.]
[The South Park Community Theatre, the stage, next day. rehearsal. Clyde is speaking under a spotlight]
CLYDE
Tonight we present the story of a courageous girl and her fight against depression
CARTMAN
[in the audience] OP-pression!
CLYDE
Oppression. Our play begins in a simpler time. [music comes up] Alabama, in the late 1800s [spotlight goes off, Clyde walks off stage, curtains open. A lone house stands against a desert background and clouds float high against the sky-blue backdrop. Dancing singers begin]
ACTORS
1800's, Alabama! What a great place and time!
We're so happy that we live in 1800's Alabama 'cause it's sunny and there is no crime!
JEFFREY
[in the audience] Now to the refrain!
ACTORS
And in this little town in 1800's Alabama there's a family by the name of Keller!
[They dance off to one side of the house. A water pump appears]
Their daughter's deaf and mute and blind as a bat, and her parents can't even tell her!!
LAMOND
[a man with a small animal cage enters] Excuse me, I am Lamond, the animal trainer.
CLYDE
Oh. [quickly calls the others] Cool! He's here! [the other kids gather]
CARTMAN
Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks?
LAMOND
Ap ap! Do not call them tricks! She's a very sensitive turkey! She performs feats, not tricks. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the most beautiful bird in America! [sets the cage down] Four-time prize winner of the National Western Stock Show and reigning poster child of turkeylovers.com! I give you Alinicia! [one serious turkey walks out of the cage, and the kids are impressed]
CARTMAN
Yeh.
OTHERS
Wow.
CARTMAN
Whoa.
BEBE
Her feathers are beautiful.
CLYDE
That's the prettiest turkey I ever saw.
LAMOND
Of course she is! [she looks back at the kids and thrusts her beak in the air]
CARTMAN
Okay! Now we can really get this thing underway! Places, everybody! [the kids move back...] Where the hell is Timmy?
TIMMY
[off screen] TIM-MIH! [all turn and face him. He's in costume with Gobbles before him. Gobbles raises his head and gobbles]
LAMOND
What... is... that?!
CARTMAN
Uh, that's Gobbles, the physically challenged turkey. [Timmy takes his lighter and sets his hoop on fire, then lowers it for his bird]
TIMMY
Gobbles! [Gobbles makes no move] Gobbles?!
KYLE
Timmy, we already got a turkey.
CLYDE
Yeah, and it's from Broadway.
TIMMY
[indicates his turkey] Gobbles.
CARTMAN
No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play!
KYLE
Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off.
CARTMAN
No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part.
TIMMY
[stubborn] Tim-mih.
CARTMAN
Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys! [Alinicia protests vigorously, shedding feathers everywhere]
LAMOND
My turkey does not work with other turkeys!
CARTMAN
Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonna do?!
[The South Park Community Theatre, later. Hallway outside a dressing room. The door opens and Lamond stands there trying to calm Alinicia down]
LAMOND
Alright, ah ah alright! Alri- ah a-alright. Alright. [exits and closes the door]
CARTMAN
[walks up] Dude, we need your turkey for our play!
LAMOND
She's not coming out. She's very upset! She's pooped all over the room!
CARTMAN
I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy?
LAMOND
[ominously] Kill the other turkey!
CARTMAN
I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it.
LAMOND
Well, it could meet with "an unfortunate accident."
CARTMAN
Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show? [laughs, but realizes he's alone in this] Oh.
LAMOND
It's very simple! Either that turkey meets with an unfortunate accident, or you don't have a feat-performing turkey for your Helen Keller Thanksgiving musical!
CARTMAN
Alright, alright! Just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal! I'll take care of everything. [walks off]
[The South Park Community Theatre, the stage, later. Bebe and Timmy are front and center while the others stand in a row in the background]
BEBE
[enunciating] Water, Helen. It has a name. Oh, why can't you understand?
TIMMY
Dehh haaa. [unimpressed looks from Cartman, Jeffrey, and Lamond]
BEBE
Water, Helen, Water.
KIDS
She's never gonna do it. There's no way she'll ever do it.
BEBE
Helen, Helen. Water, Helen.
KIDS
How can she talk if she can't hear? This is absolutely pointless!
CARTMAN
Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second. [whisks himself onstage] Okay, I just want to adjust the blocking real quick. Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have Turkey #2 [starts moving Gobbles along] stand just a little bit more over... [puts it behind the Comedy Central logo] here. [mulls over the position] Let's see, maybe a little more up in here. [moves it a bit towards stage center] And just a wee bit over here. [Gobbles is back behind the logo, a bit] And right about... [moves Gobbles a bit back] hm'ere. [steps back] There we go. Good. [goes off stage. A cable whips out of place somewhere. A lighting fixture falls on Kenny and kills him]
STAN
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
JEFFREY
Whoa-aaaa [dances away]
CARTMAN
Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!
JEFFREY
[onstage, walks up to Kenny's corpse, then gets lyrical] Let him rest in peace. Let him rest. Why must he die?
BUTTERS
[a camera follows him to the auditorium at butt level; another camera shows him entering the room] They've got special effects! [Jeffrey continues singing in the background]
KYLE
What Butters? [Butters meets the others onstage]
BUTTERS
The kindergartners! They've got amazing stage effects. Pyrotechnics and what have yous. Why, it's a regular feast for the eyes!
WENDY
Oh, no!
CLYDE
We're never gonna outdo them now! [the kids begin to chatter amongst themselves]
TOLKIEN
But what are we gonna do?
CARTMAN
[Jeffrey continues his dirge] Calm down! Calm down! We can have special effects, too. Now, I know a lot is going wrong, but we've got to stick together to make this play work! [looks at Lamond] All of us! [Lamond crosses his arms]
JEFFREY
—and into your hands [the kids now pay attention to him] uh he... buh... [hums, then stops singing, stares, then gets up and walks offstage]
[The South Park Community Theatre, the stage, later. Timmy is in another hallway trying to get Gobbles to hop through the hoop]
TIMMY
Gobbles! [Gobbles lifts his head and drops it away from Timmy] Hu-ugh, Gobbles! [they hear the door open. Timmy puts the hoop away and gathers Gobbles on his lap]
LAMOND
[peeks in] Little boy.
TIMMY
[spins around] Timmy.
LAMOND
Yes, Tim. I feel I must speak with you. [walks up to Timmy] The others, well, they don't want you to know, but, oh, I don't know what to do. Should I tell you?
TIMMY
T-Timmih? [a bit afraid]
LAMOND
I feel I'm the only one who can be honest with you. [genuflects next to Timmy] The animal shelter is on its way to...take your turkey away from you.
TIMMY
Gobbles? [scared]
LAMOND
You see, they don't allow children in your... situation... to have wild animals as pets. You can't take him running, you can't take care of him. They... have to take it away.
TIMMY
Gobbles!
LAMOND
They take wild pets away from people like you... and hand them over for experiments. And they're shocked, dissected, and flayed while they're still alive. And no matter where you go, the shelter people will find you. The only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture is for you to... let him go. Back into the wild. [listens for something] Oh no! Here they come now! [two men round the corner] Quick, go! And set your turkey free! I'll try to stall them.
TIMMY
[turns and wheels away from the oncoming men] T-tim-mih.
INSTALLER
Eh, excuse me, we're here to install the water effects for the musical?
LAMOND
Uh, the stage is right through there.
INSTALLER
Thanks. [he and his partner walk towards the stage. Lamond looks after them as they leave]
[South Park, Cartman's house, night. Cartman is at his desk in his room rewriting a song.]
CARTMAN
Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see. [writes] no [writes] No. [writes] NO! [writes] God-damnit [takes the sheet and squeezes it into a wad]
JEFFREY
[enters the room] How is it going, Eric?
CARTMAN
Terrible! [turns and faces Jeffrey] I can't write the lyrics for the third act! Nothing's coming to me.
JEFFREY
Well, you know in theater sometimes, we try different tricks to get the creative juices flowing.
CARTMAN
Like what?
JEFFREY
Let's see. [closes the door behind him] Helen Keller was blind and deaf. [walks to Cartman's side desk] Perhaps you should see what it is like. Deprive yourself of your senses and see what plays inside your mind. Here. [turns Cartman around and puts a blindfold on him.]
CARTMAN
Hey, that's not a bad idea.
JEFFREY
[puts some headphones on him] Just relax. Just try to let your mind wander and let the juices flow... [a long pause. then a series of images present themselves]
[First, the portrait of Helen Keller. Then nothing. Then Helen Keller again, then a banana split, then Helen again, then a human skull. Cartman is disturbed. Then Helen, the skull, another skull, Helen, a mummy whose hair moves a bit, bombs dropping from planes, a sinister clown, the banana split, a body being prepped for operation, the banana split, a wall with "GO DEAD BE DEAD" written in blood on it, a Russian show of military might, Helen, animals tearing at something, a riot, a close-up of a snake, an atomic bomb test, a lasik experiment. Cartman. The first skull, "GO DEAD BE DEAD", the skull, the experiment, the skull, the experiment, a woman wailing in the flames, open-heart surgery, a rat eating a dead rat, the banana split, a mouth being pulled open, Helen, a Nazi troop march, a fireman in an inferno, the Hindenburg bursting in flame, an alien opening its mouth and the camera zooms in... Cartman takes the blindfold and headphones off]
CARTMAN
Oh, man!
JEFFREY
Well, did you see anything?
CARTMAN
No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes.
JEFFREY
...Oh, that's too bad.
CARTMAN
Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire! [starts writing furiously] Yes! Yes! I have it now!
[South Park, residential street, day. Timmy rolls along dejected and turns to another street. He remembers what Lamond said as he rolls]
LAMOND
[his head appears beside Timmy] The only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture is for you to... let him go... [fades as it echoes] let him go... let him go...[the head disappears]
TIMMY
[stops and lets Gobbles go] Gobbles! [points away so Gobbles could leave. Gobbles moves his head in that direction, but nothing else] Gobbles!! [turns around and rolls away. Gobbles follows him and gobbles. Timmy turns around again and face Gobbles] Gobbles. Gobbles! [points away again, turns and rolls away. Gobbles follows some more] Timmih. [a tear appears in his eye] Timmih, Gobbles. [turns away and rolls off, leaving Gobbles alone. The camera pulls back and moves to the first house on the right side. A man and son sit on their doorway]
BOY
Daddy, why did Mommy leave and go to heaven?
FATHER
She didn't want to, Kevin. She... had no choice.
BOY
But I miss her. [father and son start to cry. The camera moves to a bench on which two men sit]
ELDERLY MAN
[his middle-aged son comforts him] I could have so much more with my life, son. I've wasted it. I've wasted it, not ever telling you and Mark that I love you. [both men start to cry. The camera moves to Heidi Turner crying over a dead dog.]
HEIDI
Robby! Robby, no! [cries uncontrollably. The camera moves to a couple in discord. the woman is sad]
WOMAN
...Because now, every time I look at you [he tries to console her], I see her! [she swats his arm away] I have to move on.
MAN
Kelly, please. Don't do this. I'm sorry.
KELLY
Then why did you do it?? [breaks down and sobs]
MAN
I don't know! [beings to cry, too, and rests his head on her shoulder. The camera moves to a lady with something to say]
LADY
Have you done the right things in your life? [the camera looks up into the sky as it fades into night]
[The South Park Community Theatre, Wednesday, play day. The parents arrive and take seats. Mrs. Marsh finds Mrs. Broflovski siting in the audience already, and walks up to her]
SHARON
Hi, Sheila.
SHEILA
Hello, Sharon. Where's your husband?
SHARON
Oh, he's in the back. He set up a video camera so he can tape the performance.
SHEILA
Oh, so did Gerald. [indeed, all the husbands are in the back of the theatre with video cameras at the ready]
GERALD
Oh yeah, I got a great angle here.
RANDY
Ey, Gerald, maybe after the show we can make copies of each other's tape so we have both.
GERALD
Good idea.
[The South Park Community Theatre, stage. The kids mill around backstage]
KYLE
So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat?
STAN
No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay. [Timmy rolls slowly in ]
KYLE
You ready for the big show, Timmy?
STAN
Where's Gobbles, Timmy?
TIMMY
Gobbles.
CARTMAN
[cheerfully] Alright everybody, let's take our places!
KYLE
Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey?
CARTMAN
I don't know. [Stan and Kyle cross their arms] I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole.
LAMOND
You're going to be brilliant, you sexy, gorgeous turkey. With that other meddling animal out of the way, you'll steal the show! [Alinicia gobbles]
[South Park, business district, day. Gobbles walks along the curb as cars zip by, then decides to cross the street. A car zips be and Gobbles steps back. The camera angle shows Gobbles' view of the car that almost ran over him]
DRIVER
[walks up to collect Gobbles] Well, well, what are doing out here? [picks him up] You shouldn't be out walking the streets. [opens his truck, tosses Gobbles in, and rushes to the cab of the truck. The side of the truck reads, "Uncle Joe's Fresh Turkey. Succulent and Juicy Turkeys," with a plump turkey in the background. The driver takes off quickly]
[Uncle Joe's Fresh Turkey truck, trailer section. Gobbles finds himself along near the doors and looks up to see a group of turkeys looking back at him. Then the turkeys look up, and Gobbles does also. What they see is a sign that reads, "Thanksgiving Turkey. Killed Humanely." Gobbles looks at the turkeys, who look back, and then drops his head]
[The South Park Community Theatre, stage. Mr. Garrison is present to introduce the show.]
MR. GARRISON
Hello, parents, and welcome to the 13th annual South Park Thanksgiving Pageant.
MR. MACKEY
[bored, rests his head on his hand] Every year the fourth graders do "The Miracle Worker," and every year I have to sit and watch it.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Yeah, I swore that if I had to see it one more time, I'd put a bullet in my head. [demonstrates with her finger] But luckily I got really stoned before I came.
MR. GARRISON
And now, here it is. The touching story of Helen Keller, "The Miracle Worker." [walks off. The parents are seen clapping, and then the curtains open up to reveal kids dancing and doing acrobatic feats]
KIDS
Helen Keller, Helen Keller, blind as a bat.
She can't hear us speak. What's up with that?
SHEILA
This is "The Miracle Worker"?
SHARON
I... well... maybe. [more dancing follows]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh, oh, haha. Wow.
[Uncle Joe's Fresh Turkey factory. The truck backs up to building 2B and dumps its cargo into a chute. The turkeys tumble down into a holding room and recover. Gobbles ends up there and looks up at a sign: "Our Turkeys are killed... HUMANELY!!!"]
WRANGLER
[a vertical door rises and he directs the turkeys] Come on. Yaah! Move it!
[the turkeys leave the room and enter another one. A movie screen faces them. Another worker appears and closes the door behind the turkeys. The turkeys remain excited until a movie comes up with sweeping views of nature. The turkeys calm down, and a view of clouds zipping along the sky follows. Then waterfalls. The lights come up and a giant saw comes out and chops the heads off all the turkeys save one. The saw rises. Only Gobbles survives, and he keeps his head low as he finds a clearing. A large board appears and pushes the decapitated turkeys out an opening on the opposite wall. The bodies are then lifted up and returned to the truck they came in, but the building they come out of is 3C. Gobbles falls off the truck and ends up on the floor. Jimbo and other South Park hunters pass by and notice]
JIMBO
Holy crow. Look, boys! A real live wild turkey! [Gobbles sees the hunters and tries to run away.] It's tryin' to outsmart us! Come on, fellas! [they pursue Gobbles]
[The South Park Community Theatre, stage. The audience watches as Wendy]
WENDY
John, come quick! Our little baby's very sick

[Stan rushes in]

When I pout she doesn't flinch, and when she doesn't move an inch.
STAN
No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring me.
WENDY
She can't see hear, John. Watch. Helen!
STAN
Helen!
WENDY
...Helen! [the audience stares in disbelief]

I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!
STAN
Oh no! [they lean on each other]
WENDY
Oh no! Oh no!!! [both collapse to the floor, and the curtains close. Alinicia trots in and gets the spotlight. She then performs her feats. She hops up on a small stand, walks a tightrope, and hops off the stand at the other end. She hops through a hoop and lands on a third stand, then pulls the cover off a sign introducing the next scene: "Scene 2, Eight Years Later" and takes a bow. A few people clap]
[The South Park Community Theatre, backstage. Timmy and Lamond watch Alinicia perform.]
LAMOND
She's brilliant! Everyone loves her so far. [the two workers approach him]
CARTMAN
[rushes up] Hey, the fountains you guys installed are shorting out some of our lights.
INSTALLER
Look, we're only here to do the water effects. We're not in charge of electrical. That's a different union.
TIMMY
[looks at Cartman] Timmih?
CARTMAN
Union Mafia bastards! [Timmy looks at Lamond in fear]
LAMOND
Oh, heh. Look, Tim, all is well in love and theatre, right? Haha.
TIMMY
[throws off his wig and turns to wheel away] Gobbles!! [zips out]
[The South Park Community Theatre, stage. Cartman rushes up to the other kids]
CARTMA
Were is Timmy?! He's on in one minute!
KYLE
He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave.
CARTMAN
Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller!
JEFFREY
[approaches the boys] I do. I know the part. If I must, I can go on.
CARTMAN
...Alright, fine! Get in costume!
[South Park, business district, day. Timmy wheels down the street past Tele's calling out...]
TIMMY
Gobbles! Gobbles!
[The barn. Gobbles returns to his prior home, and the hunters follow him there]
JIMBO
[prepares his rifle] There it is! [three other men prepare their rifles] Hey, hey! I saw it first! I get the first shot! [aims his rifle and spots the turkey] Here, turkey turkey. [focuses on the turkey]
[The South Park Community Theatre, stage. Stan, Kyle, Wendy, and Jeffrey are in costume]
WENDY
There is nothing we can do for our poor daughter. We cannot reach her.
JEFFREY
[lyrically] I cannot hear what they are saying. I cannot tell them how I feel [in disbelief]
I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!
CARTMAN
What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing!
JEFFREY
If only I could say things that go on in my mind. [in disbelief]

I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[touched] Oh, wow.
[The barn. Jimbo still has Gobbles in his sights]
JIMBO
That's it. Thaaat's it! [about to pull the trigger]
TIMMY
Gobbles! [sees Jimbo and is alarmed]
JIMBO
Gotcha!
TIMMY
[Slow motion, jumps out of his chair and dives towards] Gobbles! [flies through the air. Jimbo fires his rifle, and Timmy falls on the floor limp. Jimbo sees what he's done, and all the hunters lower their rifles. Gobble's head pops up behind Timmy. The other hunters whistle and move away slowly, leaving Jimbo and Ned alone. Gobbles walks up to Timmy and nudges him] T-timmih? [Gobbles pokes him] Gobbles? [slowly comes to, then quickly sits up] Gobbles! Haaaah. [brushes himself off and gathers Gobbles up in his arms]
JIMBO
[rushes up to Timmy and is relived that he's okay] Aw, thank God you're alright, kid. [goes down on one knee] It was an accident, I swear. Uh, is there any way we can make it up to you?
TIMMY
[determined] Timmih.
[The South Park Community Theatre, stage. Bebe, and Jeffrey are in costume. Bebe pumps water onto Jeffrey's hand]
BEBE
Yes, that's it. [Jeffrey keeps his hand under the water] That's it, Helen. Water! WA-TER!
JEFFREY
Wawa.
BEBE
She did it!
KIDS
[in the background, come forward] She did it! She did it! Water! Water water aaaaaaaa!
Water, Helen, Water.
We can't believe she did it. The dumb kid really did it.
Water, Helen, Water.
JEFFREY
Now that I can communicate the world is not so cold and dark. [Cartman slaps his head and the waterworks begin]
KIDS
[slowing] Water, Helen, Aaa-aaaaaa!
[the waterworks go up real high and two fountainheads crash into each other]
LAMOND
[prepping Alinicia] Here it comes, angel! Your big finale! The audience is going to go wild! [a shadow enters the scene and Lamond looks up. He sees Gobbles and an angry Timmy with arms crossed glaring at him] Oh. Back already? Don't worry. Maynard covered your part flawlessly.
TIMMY
Timmih! [the hunters gather and take aim at Alinicia]
JIMBO
Turkey shoot! [the hunters fire away and decimate Alinicia. Her blood spurts all over Lamond, who shields his eyes.]
LAMOND
[He falls on one knee at the horror] Alinicia! Jesus, no!
TIMMY
Aaaa, Timmih!
CARTMAN
[walks up with Kyle] Okay, we're ready for the- [stops in his tracks and stares at the dead Alinicia.] What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire!
KYLE
[steps forward and points] Hey, look! [onstage, Gobbles approaches the ring of fire and steps through it. The kids grin immediately]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[in awe] Oh. Oh, wow! WOWuh! [starts to clap. The audience soon follows]
CARTMAN
[exults] They loved it! They LOVED it!
TIMMY
Gobbles!
[The South Park Community Theatre, stage, night. Mr. Garrison is onstage to introduce the last skit of the night]
MR. GARRISON
And finally tonight, parents, we have the South Park Kindergarten class. Their play is titled, "Thanksgiving, Mon Ami."
STAN
Okay, here we go. [the kids are still backstage, but in their street clothes]
KYLE
Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It just can't be.
KINDERGARTNERS
[four little pilgrims enter singing badly to a long table in front of a cabin and a tipi]
It's getting dinner. Let's all eat.
E I E I O.
And on that dinner we'll invite some Indians
E I E I O.
[four little Indians appear and take their seats at the table]
With an Indian here and an Indian there
Everywhere an Indian, Indian. Uh thank, thank-
[something pops by the middle of the table...]
PILGRIM GIRL
[runs off] Aaaaaaa!
KINDERGARTNERS
Happy Thanksgiving. [another kindergartner wheels a horse prop onstage. The curtains then close]
MR. GARRISON
Alright, see you next year, parents. [a hush falls over the audience and the actors backstage]
CARTMAN
That's it?
STAN
We worked our asses off to compete with that?!
KYLE
Butters told us their play was awesome! [the kids move away from Butters a bit]
BUTTERS
...Wow, did you see that? They had a horse, too!
TIMMY
Gobbles, Timmy!
End of Helen Keller! The Musical


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Cartman's family and friends have intervened and are forcing him to trim down. While Cartman's away, Kenny's star is on the rise when he gets his own reality TV show.

script:Fat Camp

[South Park Elementary, day, Ms. Choksondik's classroom. Ms. Choksondik enters and stands before the blackboard.]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright, children, as I'm sure you all remember, today we are going to continue our biology lesson... dissecting an organism.
CLASS
Yeah! [There are new seating arrangements to note: Wendy now sits to Stan's left. Timmy sits in the back of the class. Pip sits behind Kenny. Two students not seen before join the class]
BEBE, NEW KID
Woohoo.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[walks off] Now, what we are going to dissect today is the West Indian manatee. [return with a large dolly stacked with manatee corpses. Stan and Kyle glance at each other] Manatees are mammals that live in the oceans and are often called the gentle clowns of the sea.
WENDY
Uhh, Ms. Choksondik, aren't manatees endangered?
MS. CHOKSONDIK
They sure are, Wendy, and that's why we must learn what's inside them. [pushes the dolly towards the class and hands the manatees out] Now, we don't have quite enough [one goes to Butters] manatees to go around, so I think we're gonna have to split up into groups of four. [Stan and Annie get manatees]
BUTTERS
Hey! Ours is still alive!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[walks up and looks] Oh, hold on. [walks away. The manatee raises its head. Ms. Choksondik returns with a brick and brings it down hard on the manatee's head twice, killing it and exposing its brain. Butters is stunned. Ms. Choksondik returns to the front of the class] Now, children, our first incision will be along the abdomen.
STAN
[holding his knife] I can't do it, dude.
KYLE
Aw, don't be such a baby! [takes the knife, blinks, then offers it to Kenny] You do it, Kenny.
KENNY
(Nuh uh!)
KYLE
Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!
KENNY
(FIVE BUCKS???) [grabs the knife and starts cutting away]
STAN
Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.
[The Cartman house, living room. Cartman and his mom watch TV. Cartman laughs. Terrance and Phillip are on. They are dressed as detectives They look at a corpse with a dagger stabbed into the chest]
PHILLIP
Say Terrance, this body appears to have been moved since the murder. Look at the forensic evidence around the torso.
TERRANCE
I don't see anything.
PHILLIP
Look closer. [Terrance looks closer] Closer. [Terrance bends down further. Phillip holds Terrance's head down] Hunh-nh.
TERRANCE
I still don't see anything, Phillip.
PHILLIP
Waitwait. Hunh.
CARTMAN
I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen?
PHILLIP
[grunts softly] Keep looking, Terrance. The forensic evidence is right around here. [grunts long, farts, and cackles. The camera pulls back to reveal Terrance standing on a stool. Phillip looks to see Terrance ready to fart on him. Terrance lets loose...] Ah! [...and Phillip is blown into a nearby wall, then falls on his side] Af!
TERRANCE
AAHahahahahahaaa!
CARTMAN
Whoa! That totally surprised me! [his mom looks at him] I can't believe how the show manages to stay fresh.
LIANE
Eh yes, sweetie.
CARTMAN
[sweetly] Mom, can you go make me a toaster pastry chocolate-mix butter ball? [grins]
LIANE
Oohh, honey, why don't you make it yourself? [his grin vanishes] Mommy's [looks away] expecting [looks back] some company.
CARTMAN
God, I have to do everything around here!
[The Cartman house, kitchen. Cartman grabs a stool and walks over to the kitchen counter with it. He starts singing softly as he prepares his dish. He pulls out some Pop Toasties and puts them in a toaster, gets some powdered chocolate milk and a stick of butter, rolls the butter in the powdered milk, gets the Pop Toasties, and places the chocolate-covered butter between the two Pop Toasties. He squeezes down for good measure and makes his way out of the kitchen.]
[The Cartman house, living room. Cartman enters singing to himself]
CARTMAN
I'mo drag home myself, babih. But the- [blinks and looks up. In the living room now with his mom are Stan's parents, Kyle's parents, Mr. Mackey, Mr. Garrison, and Dr. Doctor.] What the hell's going on?
LIANE
Uh, sweetie, your friends wanted to have a "talk" with you.
MR. MACKEY
Eric, your friends and your family are all... concerned about your weight. M'kay?
CARTMAN
[incredulous] What?!
DR. DOCTOR
We believe that you might have a problem.
CARTMAN
You're God-damn right I have a problem! Terrance and Phillip is on and I don't have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell is this?!
MR. GARRISON
It's called intervention, Eric.
LIANE
Your friends and I have all chipped in and we're going to send you up to a weight-management retreat.
CARTMAN
Fat camp?
DR. DOCTOR
Yes, fat camp.
CARTMAN
Alright, I don't know who the hell put you all up to this, [grabs his creation and drops the plate on the floor] but I am sure as hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp!
MR. MACKEY
Now, Eric, all these people came here and paid to send you to camp because they care about you.
MR. GARRISON
Yeah, except for me. I just wanted to see the look on your face when they told you.
CARTMAN
[pleading] Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those stories about how everyone in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies!
LIANE
Oh, sweetie, those were all lies. You're just fat. [Cartman is stunned. A piece of Pop Toasties falls on the floor]
[South Park Elementary, day, Ms. Choksondik's class. The manatees have been dissected in various places, and body parts are all over the desks and floor. A drawing of the manatee and its organs is now on the blackboard.]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
And now we will be removing the spleen. Notice how the manatee's spleen is designed for a qu-
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[opens the door and peeks in] Ah, Ms. Choksondik, can we have a quick word with you?
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[puts down the pointer and goes towards the door] Alright, continue with the removal of the spleen, children. I'll be right back. [opens the door and exits.]
KYLE
[working on his manatee] Aw, dude, check this out. [pulls out the spleen with some scissors]
STAN
[off-screen] That's so gross.
KYLE
Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this?
KENNY
(I'm not eatin' that!)
KYLE
I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.
STAN
I'll throw in five.
[South Park Elementary, day, hallway. Principal Victoria talks to Ms. Choksondik there.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
And so apparently there's been a little mixup. The manatees were meant to go to the Denver Shelter Aquarium and the frogs were meant to come here.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Oh dear.
[South Park Elementary, day, Ms. Choksondik's class. Some desks have been moved aside and the kids continue contributing to the kitty...]
BUTTERS
I'll throw in a dollar!
BEBE
I've got three.
KYLE
Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!
STAN
[off-screen, enticing] Forty-one bucks. [Kenny jumps up and starts eating it. The others groan and moan] Eww-ho-hoo! He did it!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[returns to the front of the class] Alright, children, now, let's get back in our seats. Uh, we are now going to put the manatees back together. [the kids blink with surprise]
[A wooded area, day. A camp is shown in some hills. It is called "Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center." The Cartman station wagon drives into the camp]
LIANE
...And it has basketball courts and tennis courts, and you can call Mommy any time you want. [Cartman has been looking away all this time. She looks at him] Oh, sweetie-kins, don't be mad. I'm sure you're going to have a good time. And when you come back you'll be all healthy and thin. [the station wagon pulls up to the Hopeful Hills REGISTRATION building]
MALE COUNSELOR
Howdy there. I'm one of the weight counselors here. This must be Eric Cartman.
LIANE
Yes. I'm afraid he's a little moody.
MALE COUNSELOR
Oh, we'll change that. [bends down next to the passenger window] Hello, camper. My name is Rick. How are you doing?
CARTMAN
Well, I'm pissed off, Rick! How are you?
RICK
I'm doing great! Why don't you come on out and we'll get you oriented. [stands up and Cartman exits the car] I'll take care of him from here, ma'am.
LIANE
Oh. [bows and opens her arms to hug Cartman] Well, goodbye, sweetie.
CARTMAN
[darkly] Don't touch me! [moves away a bit]
RICK
Eric, this is the beginning of a whole new life for you!
[Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, later. A group of kids, all of them fat, stand in a circle and look at each other.]
BRUNETTE
[to Cartman's right] Have you got any candy?
CARTMAN
No.
TALLER BOY
[to Cartman's left] My mom says I ain't to eat no candy here. I'm s'psoed to lose weight.
RICK
[walks up to the group enthusiastically] Alright! Everybody's here and that means we can get down to business! Over the next few weeks we're gonna learn that losing weight is [jumps] fun, right gang?
TALLER BOY
Right.
RICK
Wait a second. [holds his right hand to his ear] Do you kids hear something? [drops his hand] I could've swore that-
PINK MONSTER
Raaarrrr!!! [a woman in costume]
RICK
Oh no, kids! It's glutinous fat!
PINK MONSTER
I'm gonna take over your body and make you slow! [starts hopping around]
RICK
Oh! What are we going to do? Wait! I know! I could knock it out! With... Exercise! [holds up an EXERCISE paddle, strikes the monster on the head with it, and tosses it away] And... Proper Diet. [does the same with a PROPER DIET paddle]
PINK MONSTER
Oh no! Exercise and proper diet have killed me. [falls over on her side]
RICK
I guess we took care of that bad old fat, didn't we kids?
TALLER BOY
Yeah! [Cartman glares at him]
RICK
Well, hold on a second. Because that glutinous fat was really our good friend, Susan, [she pops out of the costume] who's another weight counselor! [she jumps out in front of the costume and exults]
TALLER BOY
Heh! It was a lady in a costume!
CARTMAN
[miffed] Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!
[South Park Elementary, day, playground. Stan and Pip stand by Kenny, who's groaning in pain and holding his stomach.]
KYLE
[walks up with Butters] What's the matter?
STAN
Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick. [Clyde and Tolkien come in from the right, Wendy and Bebe come in from the left. Stan comforts Kenny.]
KYLE
Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it. [Stan jumps back as Kenny starts vomiting the spleen up. Stan and Kyle watch in shock]
KIDS
Eewww.
STAN
Well, at least you got it out of your system.
KYLE
Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen! [Butters looks at him] How much, Kenny?
KENNY
(WHAT?!)
KYLE
I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke.
BUTTERS
Huh-I'm in for five!
STAN
Oh, you guys!
CLYDE
I've got three.
TOLKIEN
Six!
BUTTERS
Uh-here. Uh-you can scoop it up in my R. Kelly thermos. [Kenny takes it and opens it up, then bends to scoop the vomit up into the thermos]
KYLE
That's 19 bucks, Kenny! [more kids gather]
KENNY
(Ungh.) [goes ahead and eats his vomit]
KIDS AROUND KENNY
AAAAA!
KIDS AROUND TIMMY
Waugh.
KYLE
Kick ass, dude!
STAN
You know, dude, there might be something to this.
KYLE
Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.
[Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, later. The counselors come up over a hill and down the other side jogging. They stop]
RICK
Doing great kids! Come on! [they resume jogging and the fat kids lumber to the top of the hill panting behind them. Cartman stops and droops]
CARTMAN
[resumes jogging] This... is... bullcrap!
[Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, mess hall, after dinner. Rick is talking to the kids]
RICK
Well, I sure enjoyed my carrots and protein bar! How about you, gang?
CARTMAN
[in withdrawal] I'm starving. This is it. I'm going to die here.
SUSAN
[cheerfully arrives with a loaded plate] I hope you all left room for dessert. Soybean pudding for everybody! [serves a plate of the stuff to everyone there, starting with Cartman's table]
BRUNET BOY
[to Cartman's left] Are you going to eat your soybean pudding?
CARTMAN
[shoves his plate to the boy] Take it! I can't eat this crap!
BLONDE GIRL
[to Cartman's right] Me neither. I have to have sugar or I'm going to die.
CARTMAN
[to the girl] Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass.
BRUNET BOY
I have some Fudge 'Ems up my ass. You want some?
CARTMAN
Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!
[Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, night. Cartman sneaks out and creeps along the side of the campers' cabin]
CARTMAN
Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free. [sees the entrance and races for it. He exits and races through the meadow until he reaches a road.] We did it, Clyde Frog! Now the only question is, do we go home to our traitor moms and friends, or do we start a new life on the run? [an ice cream truck approaches him] An ice cream truck! Hey wait! [races up to the truck. The driver exits the cab] Boy, am I glad to see you!
DRIVER
Can I interest you in some ice cream?
CARTMAN
You're damn right you can! Two Roller Pops, please!
DRIVER
[goes to the back of the truck, opens the doors, and pulls out one pop.] Alrighty, do you want this kind or this kind? [points to the inside of the truck. Cartman looks]
CARTMAN
Hunh? [is lifted up] Uuh! [and tossed into the truck. The doors are closed behind him, and he looks up. Before him sit four other kids who have tried to escape]
BOY 1
[on bench at left] They tricked us again, huh?
CARTMAN
[stands up] Aw, God-damnit! [turns] LET ME OUT OF HMYA! [pounds on the back doors]
DRIVER
Hang on, we'll be back at camp in a matter of no time. [drives into camp]
[Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, moments later. The campers' cabin door is opened and the five escapees return to their bunks]
BOY 1
They always get us. Sometimes it's a ice cream truck, sometimes it's a taco stand. But they always fool us.
TALLER BOY
Heh-I can't help it. I'd give anything. Any amount of money for some candy. [Rick and Susan pop into the campers' cabin.]
RICK
Hey kids!
SUSAN
Looks like we had some attempted escapees again tonight.
RICK
Escape-aroo! Now campers, I know that camp is tough, but you have to believe that you can do it. And you have to know that until you drop the weight, you can't leave.
SUSAN
[bends forward sweetly a bit and cocks her head to the left] There is no escape.
RICK
So let's just all put on our try-hard helmets, and accept that the only way for us to get out of camp, is to LOSE THE WEIGHT!
ERIC
[pissed off] Aw, damnit!
[South Park, the Cartman house. Butters and Timmy have replaced Cartman in the boy's group for now, and they stand in front of the Broflovski parents, Mr. Mackey, Mr. Garrison, Sharon March, Principal Victoria, and Dr. Doctor. They argue amongst themselves.]
GERALD
That's what being young is all about.
MR. GARRISON
[at the same time] But that's not the question.
LIANE
Thanks for coming, everybody.
MR. MACKEY
Uh what's all this about, Mrs. Cartman? Is Eric having trouble at his weight-management camp?
STAN
We knew he wouldn't make it.
LIANE
Oh, no. Quite the contrary. Eric showed up and surprised me last night. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you... the new Eric Cartman. [steps to one side as Cartman enters]
NEW CARTMAN
Hey, dudes!
KYLE
Whoa! [the others look stunned]
STAN
I don't believe it.
LIANE
Believe it. He lost 40 pounds at his fat camp. [everyone gathers round Cartman]
MR. MACKEY
Eric, that's fantastic, m'kay?!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Congratulations. How do you feel?
NEW CARTMAN
I feel awesome!
KYLE
What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.
NEW CARTMAN
You know, Kyle? There was a time when your fat jokes would have gotten to me. But now I'm totally slim and totally happy! In fact, I'd say I'm [leans a bit to eye Kyle's belly] a little bit trimmer than you, fatboy! [stands erect] Heh heh. Just kidding, Kyle.
LIANE
I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some?
CARTMAN
Memememeee! [the group heads for the kitchen while Stan and Kyle stay behind]
KYLE
Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.
STAN
Did you like the old one?
KYLE
Good point.
[Jesus and Pals]
ANNOUNCER
And now back to Jesus and Pals, on South Park Public Access.
JESUS
[with the new Cartman] Back to our courageous story of a little boy's triumph over obesity. Eric, yea. You found that the Spirit of the Lord inside you gave you strength.
NEW CARTMAN
No. Actually, I found a diet that totally works.
JESUS
A little boy who overcame the odds. Let's hear it for Eric Cartman! [the studio audience applauds] Well, our second guest tonight is a young man named Kenny McCormick, who is going to eat dog crap. Kenny? [Kenny enters with Stan, Kyle, and a dog. Music begins as a spotlight falls on Kenny. The dog turns his ass to Kenny and craps. A musical riff plays as Kenny picks the crap up and the audience groans with disgust. Some of them cover their eyes. Kenny lifts the crap dramatically into the air a wailing female joins the music. Another riff plays as Kenny swallows the crap. A small pedestal appears under him and pushes him up and around. The audience groans some more, Kenny finishes off the crap, and the audience beings to cheer. The new Cartman is pissed]
NEW CARTMAN
God-damnit, all I got was a little golf clap!
JESUS
[hesitant] Thanks for coming on the show, Kenny.
KENNY
[gracious] (Sure!)
MAN 1
Do it again!
MAN 2
Do it again!
MAN 3
Hey kid! I'll give you 20 bucks to eat a really old piece of bacon!
NEW CARTMAN
This is ridiculous! [picks at his eye]
JESUS
So. Kenny, how did you discover that you had this... talent?
STAN
We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing.
JESUS
I can't say I approve of this, my children.
KYLE
[he and Stan look at Jesus for a moment] Huh? Why not?
JESUS
Because Kenny is only doing things that anybody could do. For money. He's a prostitute.
MAN 4
I'll pay him 50 bucks to eat someone else's vomit.
MAN 5
Yeah!
MAN 6
Yeah! Go for it!
STAN
[to Kyle] What's a prostitute?
KYLE
I don't know.
[South Park Elementary, day, cafeteria. The kids mill around and eat during lunchtime. In line for their lunches are Craig, Tweek, Butters, and a few others. In the kitchen Stan, Kyle, and Kenny arrive for their lunches.]
CHEF
[behind the sneeze guard, as usual] Hello there, children!
STAN, KYLE, KENNY
Hey, Chef.
STAN
Chef, what's a prostitute?
CHEF
[ponders, then displeased] Dag-nabbit children! How come every time you come in here you gotta be askin' me questions that I shouldn't be answering?! "Chef, what's the clitoris?" "What's a lesbian, Chef?" "How come they call it a rimjob, Chef?" [the boys blink. Stan and Kyle look at each other] For once, can't you just come in here and say, "Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?"!
STAN
Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?
CHEF
[pleased] It sure is! Thank you.
STAN
Chef, what's a prostitute?
CHEF
Uh uh! You children are gonna get me in trouble with the principal again.
NEW CARTMAN
[joins the other boys] Lunchtime! I'm starved!
CHEF
Oh my God. Eric?
NEW CARTMAN
That's me.
STAN
Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is.
CHEF
Why do you need to know what a prostitute is anyway?!
STAN
Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?
KENNY
(Yeah. Am I?)
CHEF
Well, no, uh of course Kenny is not a prostitute.
KYLE
Why?
CHEF
Well, because, children, a prostitute is someone who... you could pay for certain services.
STAN
Like what?
CHEF
Like keeping you company. Understand?
STAN
No.
CHEF
You see, children, sometimes a man needs to be with a woman. But sometimes, when the lovin' is over, the woman just wants to talk and talk and talk and talk. [begins singing]
But a prostitute is someone who would love you
No matter who you are, or what you look like.
Yes, it's true, children.
[the new Cartman looks at the other boys as he starts sneaking away. They don't notice him. Other kids, Annie, Tolkien, Clyde, Butters, and Bebe, enter the kitchen]
That's not why you pay a prostitute,
no, you don't pay her to stay, you pay her to leave afterwards.
[Principal Victoria arrives and listens]
That's why I pays a lot for prostitutes!
Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. James Taylor.
JAMES TAYLOR
[enters next to Chef playing a guitar]
A prostitute is like any other woman
They all trade somethin' for sex and they do it well.
[the new Cartman goes into the supply room and starts packing donuts into his backpack]
CHEF
And that's why I say-
CHEF AND JAMES TAYLOR
Prostitutes! Prostitutes! They-
CHEF
Oohhhh [they stop when they see Principal Victoria, who has crossed her arms in anger] ...James Taylor, what the hell are you doin' in here?! Singing' about prostitutes to the children! Get out of here! [James leaves, but Principal Victoria is not satisfied.] ...These children tricked me!
[Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, that night. After being tucked int bed, the new Cartman sneaks out and rides a bike towards the Center, hides the bike near the entrance, and approaches the gate]
NEW CARTMAN
[a shadow falls on him] Oh, there you are. Alright, I got the goods. Some candy bars, a few donuts, and some beef gravy.
CARTMAN
Is anyone starting to suspect anything?
NEW CARTMAN
Nobody. Your mom even thinks I'm a skinny you.
CARTMAN
Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over!
NEW CARTMAN
Uh uh. One thing. I want a bigger cut.
CARTMAN
What?!
NEW CARTMAN
I'm the one risking my ass, running around in that stupid town pretending to be you and collecting all the food to bring up here! All you have to do is sit back and sell it to all the fat kids!
CARTMAN
Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I'll bump you up to 10%.
NEW CARTMAN
Twenty.
CARTMAN
[soft gasp] Suck my balls, 20!
NEW CARTMAN
Fine! Then I shall bid you good day! [turns aside to get his bike]
CARTMAN
Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just remember that your parents think that you're in the drug rehab center next door! You blow your cover and we're both screwed! [the new Cartman looks trapped]
[The University of Colorado, dorm room. Several students are reading their books while clothes is strewn all over the place]
STUDENT 1
[bursts through the door] You guys! You have to check this tape out!
STUDENT 2
[on the sofa] Ey, we're trying to study. Finals are tomorrow.
STUDENT 1
No, dude, check this out! It's a video: this kid, he does all kinds of crazy stuff. [pops the video into the VCR and turns on the TV] Check it out! He jumped into a Porto-Potty at a construction site and stayed there for four days! [the screen shows Kenny standing in a pool of poo under the toilet and looking at the camera]
OTHER STUDENTS
Whoa! [the screen shows a construction worker heading for the Porto-Potty. He enters and sits on the toilet, and a long log of poo descends from his nether regions]
KENNY
[the poo lands square on his face] (Ow.)
STUDENT 1
Oh, gro-hoss
STUDENT 3
Sick!
STUDENT 2
That's awesome! [rushes out to the hall and hollers] Hey guys! Check this out!
[The Krazy Kenny Show, live]
ANNOUNCER
[graphics come up animated, with letters exploding behind the show's logo] Get ready for the Krrrrrrazy Kenny Show! [four spotlights roam the stage] And now here's your host, the kid who will do anything to himself for money, Krrrra—a--a-a-azy Kenny! [Kenny appears and goes to the center of the stage, The spotlights converge on him as music reaches climax] Kenny, through the past weeks we've seen you eat mice, pretend to kill newborn babies to shock their mothers and ...wash your hair with battery acid. The question in all our minds is, who-haht are you gonna do next? [the audience cheers]
KENNY
(Well, I'm gonna give my grandfather a full-body sensual massage.)
ANNOUNCER
Whoa-ho ho! You heard him, folks! Kenny is going to give a sensual full-body massage to his own grandfather!
MAN 1
Oho! Yeah!
MAN 2
Woohoo!
[Fanfare as the stage rotates to reveal Kenny's grandfather relaxing on a heart-shaped bed. Kenny opens up a bottle of massage oil and begins massaging him]
AUDIENCE
Awww! Awgh!
STAN
Wow! This is Kenny's best show ever!
NEW CARTMAN
This is so juvenile. [bites a licorice stick. He has a box of donuts on his lap, and he and Kyle have licorice sticks]
KYLE
Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you? [takes a donut]
STAN
Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?
NEW CARTMAN
Eh, nothing. Hey, can I have some of that licorice to- take home?
[Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, next night. Rick is in the campers' cabin]
RICK
Alright campers, good work today. Lights out, and we'll see you tomorrow for more exercise and proper diet. [opens the door, exits, and closes the door]
SUSAN
[waiting] All beddy-byes for the night, are they?
RICK
I don't know what we're doing wrong, Susan. These kids aren't losing the weight.
SUSAN
We'll just have to give them more time. They'll do it!
RICK
They'll do it.
SUSAN
They'll do it!! [the counselors leave. Inside the cabin Cartman looks out the window, watching them leave]
CARTMAN
[turns around] Alright, they're gone! [walks to his bed and pulls out a suitcase from underneath] The Cartman store is open! [the other kids leave their bunks and head for Cartman]
BLONDE GIRL
[first in line, hands him some money] Two donuts and a pack of licorice, please.
CARTMAN
[quickly as he hands the goods over] Two donuts and a pack of licorice. [she walks away,and a big, tall boy is next] Well, Tony, the usual? [Tony, with squinty eyes, blinks and Cartman gives him the usual. Tony walks away. Another boy walks up, crying] Why are you crying, Chad?
CHAD
[sobbing] 'Cause I'm always gonna be fat. I don't wanna eat no sweets, but I can't control myself when they're right in front of me like this. [sobs some more. Cartman moves away a bit] All my life I've been fat. I've beh- I've been to seven camps and I swore to my momma that I'd lose the weight. I want to, but I can't help myself. [breaks down]
CARTMAN
[comforts Chad] Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need? You need a friend.
CHAD
[wipes away his tears] I'd, I do?
CARTMAN
Yes. [dangles a chocolate in front of him] A chocolate friend. [Chad begins to howl] Mr. Candy Bar doesn't judge you, Chad. Mr. Candy Bar likes you just the way you are. [opens the wrapper to expose the aroma and tempts him] Look at how yummy and sweet he is. [Chad, still sobbing, takes the candy bar and starts eating. Cartman bides his time] ...There you go. That'll just be four dollars. [Chad hands him the money and finishes the candy bar. Cartman just watches] ...There you go.
[A Krazy Kenny Show promo]
ANNOUNCER
This week on Pay Per View [a yellow starburst appears with "PAY PER VIEW" on it, then another starburst with Kenny standing behind Ms. Crabtree], Krazy Kenny will crawl up into a woman's uterus and [a shot of Kenny inside the uterus] stay there for six hours. Don't miss this once-in-a-lifetime event. Order now!
[The big city, day. City noise is heard. Next shot is in a studio, with Howard Stern hosting, and three guests. On the walls are posters, one of which is of Elton John. Two loves dolls are in the background, and the Antonio Banderas one is behind Stern]
HOWARD STERN
Alright, so we're back talkin' to three competing celebrities: Tom Green, Johnny Knoxville from MTV's Jackass and Krazy Kenny.
TOM GREEN
Hey, Howard.
HOWARD STERN
Krazy Kenny is here to promote his Pay-Per-View special this week, where he will crawl up into a bus driver's uterus and stay there for six hours.
JOHNNY KNOXVILLE
[stammering] Wow!
HOWARD STERN
Now, some people that all you guys do is perform sick and disgusting acts for shock value and money, which makes you whores. But I'd like to prove them wrong. So what I'm gonna do... is I'm gonna offer each of you $50,000 to give me oral sex right now.
TOM GREEN
I'm in.
JOHNNY KNOXVILLE
Me too.
KENNY
(And me!)
HOWARD STERN
Oh.
TOM GREEN
Fine! I'll do it for 40!
JOHNNY KNOXVILLE
30.
TOM GREEN
[points at Johnny] 20!
KENNY
(...Ten bucks!)
HOWARD STERN
Ooh, the kid says he'll do it for ten bucks.
TOM GREEN
Damnit. I'm out.
JOHNNY KNOXVILLE
Me too. I guess he is the biggest whore.
HOWARD STERN
Alright, let's get going, then. Can we cut the cameras?
[Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, day. Exercise...]
RICK
And we're gonna reach for the sky... [has arms high above his head]
CAMPERS
[follow through] Woo-aagh.
RICK
And down to the ground. [touches the ground with his fingertips]
CAMPERS
[follow through] Woo-ugh.
RICK
And up to the sky... [arms high above his head]
CAMPERS
[follow through] Woo-aagh. [Cartman and the camper to his right perform a quick transaction - Cartman hands him a pastry for a few bucks.]
RICK..
And down to the ground. [touches the ground with his fingertips]
CAMPERS
[follow through] Woo-ugh. [a couple enters the yard with their son, the taller camper Cartman got annoyed with early on. Susan catches up]
SUSAN
Please, Mr. Sanders. [Rick rises quickly]
MR. SANDERS
No! I have had it!
RICK
What's happening?
SUSAN
Horace's parents want to take him home.
RICK
Oh! But he's not ready yet.
MR. SANDERS
Look at what you've done to my boy! You told Horace that he was responsible for his weight! You made him believe that with exercise and proper diet, he could be thin! When we told you it was his genetics!
RICK
They can lose the weight if they try.
MR. SANDERS
Look at these kids! They're not getting any thinner! [a shot of the campers] Your camp is a fraud! You need to accept the fact that most fat people are just genetically fat!
SUSAN
Please, sir, if you give us one more week,...
MR. SANDERS
Your time is up!
MRS. SANDERS
Yeah, your time is up!
MR. SANDERS
And I'm going to call all the other parents to tell them to come claim their kids as well! Your camp is a WASTE ...of time!
HORACE
But, Dad, I...
MR. SANDERS
What?! [Horace looks at Cartman, who look back concerned]
HORACE
...Nothin'. [he and his parents turn right and walk away]
SUSAN
We're in trouble, Rick.
[South Park, day. At the television studio preparations are made for Kenny's test of endurance. Tweek, Tolkien, Clyde, Butters, and Kyle (with hammer) are onstage. The sounds of sawing and hammering fill the air. Ms. Crabtree is prepped for the test, with her legs spread open and the genital area blocked off by small curtains.]
KYLE
Alright, Ms. Crabtree. Is it comf'table enough?
MS. CRABTREE
HOW LONG HAVE I GOT TO SIT HERE?
KYLE
Six hours.
MS. CRABTREE
HELL, I'LL DO SIX HOURS FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS YOU'RE PAYING ME!
KYLE
Great.
STAN
[enters and runs to the stage] You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York!
KYLE
For what?
STAN
For giving Howard Stern a hummer!
BUTTERS
Who-what's a hummer??
STAN
I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!
KYLE
Three months?! But the pay-per-view is tomorrow!
STAN
I know! [Kyle gets an idea. He and Stan descend the steps to talk to the new Cartman, who stands nearby]
KYLE
[sits next to the new Cartman. Stan sits by Kyle's other side] He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus.
NEW CARTMAN
You know, maybe we've all learned something here. I mean, we set Kenny up to further and further himself each time, havin' to always outdo himself. Now he's in jail for being a whore. And perhaps, just perhaps, we are to blame. [Kyle looks at him with suspicious anger]
KYLE
...Alright, that does it! [rises and backs up a bit] This has been bothering the hell out of me! [reaches for the new Cartman's cap and pulls it off, revealing a puffy head of hair. Stan registers shock] I knew it! You're not Cartman at all!
NEW CARTMAN
Uh oh.
[The Krazy Kenny Show. The big moment arrives]
ANNOUNCER
Well, we've seen him do just about every disgusting thing in the book, and today live on pay-per-view, Krazy Kenny is going to crawl into a woman's uterus for six hours! [the audience jumps and applauds] Well, Ms. Crabtree, your cervix has been dilated, your womb equipped with oxygen- How do you feel?
MS. CRABTREE
I feel great! I haven't had this much attention paid to my coot since I was 16!
AUDIENCE
[jumping, cheering] Hooray!
ANNOUNCER
Well, let's bring out the man of the hour, you know him as the-
[The Krazy Kenny Show, backstage. Kyle and Stan get the new Cartman, now the new Kenny, ready, dressing him like Kenny.]
KYLE
Don't worry, dude. You're gonna do great.
NEW KENNY
[pulls the hood off his face] No way! I'm not doing this!
KYLE
Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time!
NEW KENNY
But this isn't fair!
STAN
[walks up and puts the hood back on the new Kenny] Deal, druggie!
NEW KENNY
(But I'm gonna starve to death if I get in there!)
[The Krazy Kenny Show, later]
ANNOUNCER
And here he is, Kenny McCormick! [Kenny enters, waves to the audience as it cheers, and walks towards Ms. Crabtree. Kenny parts the little curtains and the audience quiets down. The audience reacts as Kenny climbs into the uterus] We can watch him on the video monitors. How are you doin' in there, Kenny? [four monitors frame the stage prop behind Ms. Crabtree. Above her is a digital timer. Inside the womb, Kenny holds his right thumb up]
CAROL
That's my boy! [Stuart smiles]
[Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, next day. The parents have come for their campers. All the parents are fat, too.]
RICK
Good-bye, Chad.
CHAD'S DAD
We'll be wanting our refund, naturally.
RICK
Naturally.
SUSAN
Good-bye, Alice.
ALICE
Good-bye. Thank you.
RICK
Oh, don't thank us. We failed you.
CARTMAN
[off to one side] ...65, 66, 67... [counting the dollars he's collected during his stay]
CHAD
[at the back door of the car, turns around] Wait a second! This isn't right! [other campers and their parents stop] It's time for me to be responsible for my own actions! Mom, Dad, we've been eating candy this whole time! Eric Cartman's been sneaking in junk food!
CARTMAN
[through gritted teeth] Eh- shut up, you half-Chad!
HORACE
No, he's right. The counselors've been doing a good job. We've just been cheating.
OTHER CAMPERS
Yeah.
HORACE
I believe I can lose the weight with exercise and proper diet. I don't wanna make excuses no more.
GIRL
Me neither.
OTHER CAMPERS
Yeah. [newly overjoyed, Rick and Susan grin and look at each other]
HORACE
If you take us back, we promise we won't cheat.
RICK
Well, it's alright with me. Parents?
MR. SANDERS
Well, what the heck. Maybe when you're all done you can teach me a thing or two, huh son? [rubs his son's hair; Horace looks up and grins at him]
CARTMAN
You know? You guys are right. I'm sick of being the fat kid, too. I've been making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight! [grins hopefully]
SUSAN
Oh no, not you. You're not welcome here anymore.
CAMPERS
Yeah.
CARTMAN
What?!
RICK
Bubbye. [turns around and walks into the registration building with Susan. The rest of the campers follow them in.]
CARTMAN
Well, screw you, fatasses! [begins sobbing, and pulls out a donut from his pocket. He eats at it between sobs.]
[The Krazy Kenny Show, stage. The countdown continues...]
AUDIENCE
Four, three, two, one!
ANNOUNCER
He did it! Come on out, Kenny! [nothing happens] You made it six hours, Kenny. Come on out of there. [nothing] Hmmm. Uh, Ms. Crabtree, maybe you could give him a little push. [Ms. Crabtree breathes in and pushes down. The new Kenny comes out of the uterus and slides down the steps of the stage]
AUDIENCE
OOOOHHHHHH!
DR. DOCTOR
He's dead. The pressure must have killed him.
MS. CRABTREE
I told you I was a tight virgin flower.
STAN
[pointing] Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of.
KYLE
Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards!
ANNOUNCER
Well, he gave his life for our amusement. One little boy who dared to be different. Let us never forget... Kenny McCormick. [Ms. Crabtree pushes down and another boy, wearing glasses, descends] Who was that?
End of Fat Camp


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:To get back at his parents for not letting him go to a concert, Kyle tells the police that his parents molested him. Soon, the whole town is free of adults and divided into two rival cities

script:The Wacky Molestation Adventure

[South Park, day, Kyle's house. Kyle is playing football with Ike on the front lawn. The football rests in front of Ike]
KYLE
Come on. Throw the football, Ike.
IKE
[picks up the football] No on dahdo. [the football weighs him down and he sinks into the snow. Kyle rushes forward]
STAN
[rushes up with Cartman and Kenny] Dude! [Kyle looks] You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!
KYLE
Hepatitis B?
CARTMAN
No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!
KYLE
...You got Raging Pussies tickets??
STAN
We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!
KYLE
[withdraws] Hold on. I'll be right back. [turns and runs into the house]
[Kyle's house, living room. On the sofa Gerald reads a newspaper, Sheila reads a book. Kyle rushes up to them]
KYLE
Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies?
SHEILA
No, Kyle.
KYLE
But all the guys are going!
SHEILA
Kyle, you're not old enough, and those concerts are dangerous and vile.
KYLE
But Mom, I-
GERALD
The answer is no, Kyle!
KYLE
Ugh! [turns right and walks out]
[Kyle's house, front lawn. Kyle rejoins the boys]
KYLE
My parents said I can't go.
STAN
[blinks at Cartman, who blinks back] Well, of course your parents said you can't go!
CARTMAN
Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care!
KENNY
(Yeah!)
KYLE
[looks down] Ah. Oh, now I already told them.
CARTMAN
Well, I guess you're screwed, then. [walks away with the other two]
KYLE
No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later. [turns and runs back into the house. Ike finally throws the football off and looks out from the snow]
[Kyle's house, living room. Kyle tries to persuade his parents]
KYLE
...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair!
SHEILA
Alright. Fine, Kyle, you can go to the Raging Pussies concert if you clean out the garage, shovel the driveway and bring democracy to Cuba!
KYLE
What's Cuba?
GERALD
A communist country run by a dictator named Fidel Castro.
KYLE
And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?
SHEILA
The whole thing.
KYLE
Hoh, geez. [walks away]
[Kyle's house, his bedroom, night. He's at his desk writing a letter. He's done his other chores]
KYLE
Dear Mr. Castro: [thinks] I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.
[Centro Nacional de Cuba. Castro, flanked by an armed guard on each side, is at his desk reading Kyle's letter]
KYLE
And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,
If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change.
[Castro sees a drawing of a sad Kyle holding a flower, which fades to a sad Kyle writing his letter]
Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain
All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea
[Kyle finishes a drawing of a sad rainbow coalition atop a world globe]
Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free
[Castro see a drawing of a sad Kyle inside a small house]
I just can't be very happy, that's certain
[A picture of Kyle replaces his self-portrait on the paper]
Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin'
[Kyle finishes one last drawing of himself, which Castro sees last]
Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind?
That is my one and only wish.
CASTRO
¡¡Llamen a todos junto!!
[Kyle's house, living room, next day. He and his parents watch TV and a news brief comes on. Kyle smiles, his parents are stunned]
REPORTER
Once again, this does mark the end of Communism in Cuba. Cuban dictator Fidel Castro claims he was finally convinced by a young boy's letter. [A shot of Kyle behind a wooden fence comes up] Now the country is again open to American tourism. [shot of Sheila and Gerald stunned] Plans can finally resume for Knott's Berry Farm Cuba. [Sheila and Gerald look at each other]
KYLE
[exults] I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!
SHEILA
No you can't!
KYLE
[wounded, turns] What??
GERALD
Kyle, your mother and I don't want you going to the Raging Pussies concert! We gave you a chore that we thought was impossible. You weren't supposed to actually do it.
KYLE
But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba!
SHEILA
We know, Kyle, but we just don't want you going to their concert.
KYLE
But that's not fair! You lied to me!
GERALD
Kyle, perhaps we handled this wrong, buh- but you need to understand that we don't want-
KYLE
What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!
GERALD
Because we're your parents!
KYLE
Well I wish I didn't have any parents! [walks to the front door, opens it, and exits, shocking Gerald and Sheila]
SHEILA
Kyle!
[Kenny's house, front steps. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman sit on the steps as Kenny plays on the lawn with a fire truck]
KYLE
It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!
STAN
Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.
KYLE
They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!
CARTMAN
[smoothly] Well, you... could make them... go away for a while.
KYLE
How?!
CARTMAN
Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away.
STAN
The police?
CARTMAN
Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you.
KYLE
What's that?
CARTMAN
I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months.
KYLE
[awed] Wow! Three months without parents!
KENNY
(Wow, that is awesome!)
STAN
But what do the police do to them?
KYLE
Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.
CARTMAN
You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like, [slight whine] "my parents molestered me."
KYLE
[straight] "My parents molestered me."
CARTMAN
No, but you've gotta cry, like this: [starts a fake sob, rubs his eyes] "My parents molestered me." [stops the fake cry] And then they'll say something like, "Was it a good touch or a bad touch?" and you say [rolls his eyes as he thinks] "Uh, it was a good touch" or- no wait, [points] you say it was a bad touch.
KYLE
What's "bad touch"?
CARTMAN
Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer "bad touch."
KYLE
Okay, molestered, bad touch.
CARTMAN
Yeah, And cry. [Kyle lets out a soft cry] Oh, he's ready.
[Kyle's house, front lawn, day. Police and press gather round as the four boys and Ike watch by the driveway. Gerald and Sheila exit the house followed by two policemen. Two reporters try to ask them questions as cameras go off all around them]
SHEILA
Oh my God, this isn't happening. I would never touch my children like that.
CASE WORKER
[female] You do have the right to remain silent, ma'am. I suggest you use that right.
SHEILA
Ugh, please, just listen to me! [Cartman chuckles as Kyle's parents are taken to the back door of a squad car] What about my children? Who will take care of them?
CASE WORKER
Oh, now you care?! They're going to live with their grandmother.
SHEILA
Their grandmother's been dead for three years. [she is put into the back seat, and the door is shut. The window is rolled down] You're not listening to me. Kyle, tell these people that your- [the window is raised so her voice can't be heard clearly] mother never raped you! Tell them! It's my fault. Say it! Tell them right now!!
CASE WORKER
[walks up to Kyle] They'll never be able to hurt you again. [picks Kyle up and hugs him]
KYLE
Cool, thanks.
CASE WORKER
[drops Kyle and stands up] Alright, folks. Our work here is done. [police cars doors close, police cars zoom away, and everyone else disperses]
STAN/KYLE
[Cartman grins] Alright! [high-five each other]
[Kyle's house, living room, shot of the hallway and stairs. "Old Time Rock 'N' Roll" plays. Kyle slides into view in his hat and underwear, facing away from the camera. He looks left and his sunglasses are shown. As the first words are sung, Kyle faces the camera and lip-syncs to them. With Chinpokomon around them, Kenny, Stan, and Cartman jump gleefully up and down on the sofa. In the kitchen Ike sticks a fork into the toaster. Kyle dances some more.Next scene is the Raging Pussies concert outside and inside a stadium. The four boys are in the audience, and Kyle is still in underwear. Next scene shows kids from all over descend on Kyle's house for a party at night. Everyone dances inside, some kids are eating pizza and Kyle is still in underwear.]
STAN
Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too.
CARTMAN
Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!
KIDS
Yeah, uh huh, woo hoo!
[Stan's house, living room. He's on the phone crying. Next scene, his parents are hauled off by five cops. Shelly is shocked to see her parents go, but Stan begins to dance. She looks at him angrily and begins to pull her fist back. Stan stops dancing and points at her. A cop hauls her off. Stan resumes dancing. Kenny's house, living room. Kenny's on the phone. Next scene: his parents are being placed in the back seat of a squad car. Cartman's house, front door. The door opens and Liane is hauled out, then one man, then Chef. Cartman appears after them and stops at the door, and waves goodbye to them. South Park Elementary, Ms. Choksondik's class. In front of the class, she's hauled off. Then Principal Victoria is taken away, and then Mr. Mackey, as Butters accuses him of something to the case worker. Four panes appear, with a child in each one (Clyde, Francis, Red, and Tolkien) calling the police. At the local bar police swarm in and the patrons scatter. Final shot: All the parents are gathered at the gates of Canyon City Maximum Security Prison]
TV ANNOUNCER
The following hot presentation is for mature audiences only.
CARTMAN
[slides up in front of the others] You guys! Come out here! [walks out the door. The other two follow, leaving Ike alone on the sofa.]
[Downtown South Park. The sky is a deep blue and the streets are clear of snow. Tolkien, Butters and Kenny stand behind Filmore and his friend. Cartman, Stan, Kyle, Ike, and Clyde]
STAN
What's going on?
CARTMAN
Notice anything? [before them the town sits empty as the sun sits between two mountains in a red sky.] Watch. [takes a stone and throws it hard. It flies through the air and goes through a first-floor window on a building two blocks away]
KYLE
...Nothing.
CARTMAN
Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town. [more kids gather] They've all been arrested, and the ones that weren't arrested have moved away because they're scared of being arrested
KYLE
Not one adult left?
STAN
[steps forward] ...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.
[The Rockies, some days later. A car winds its way down the winding road in a snow storm]
WOMAN
Oh, sweetie, I have no idea where we are.
MAN
I haven't seen a road marker for miles. What was the last highway we were on?
WOMAN
There has to be a town around here somewhere.
MAN
Maybe you're reading the map wrong.
WOMAN
Hey, it was your idea to take the backroads. [both of them are suddenly shocked as the engine begins to falter]
MAN
What the? [the speedometer goes down to 0 and the car begins to hobble] Oh no. No, no, no, no.
WOMAN
What's the matter with it?
MAN
[worried] I have no idea. Oh, we're gonna have to find some help quick. We're not gonna make it more than a couple of miles.
WOMAN
Oh, look! There's a town up ahead. [the signpost for South Park appears, but "SMiLEy ToWN" appears in yellow over it. Underneath the sign, a clown mask appears while four balloons] Smiley Town? That's a strange name.
MAN
Well, it'll have to do. It's probably the only town for a hundred miles. [they pass the sign.]
[Smiley Town, a beat-up gas station. The car rolls up and the man and woman get out. The woman joins the man on the driver's side of the car.]
WOMAN
Hello? Is anybody here? [so rustling is heard and Butters emerges from the garage in a mechanic's suit]
BUTTERS
Hoh, hahh, can I- help you folks?
MAN
...Yes, we need a mechanic to look at our car.
BUTTERS
Oh, well-l-l, uh, I'm the mec-hanic, I guess. Woh-what seems to be the problem?
MAN
...It's... just you here?
BUTTERS
No, uh Craig's here, too.
MAN
Oh, good.
BUTTERS
But he's playing Spaceman right now. Huh. Hey, Craig! [Craig exits the office wearing a space outfit complete with helmet]
CRAIG
[approaches] What?
MAN
Look we're in a bit of a spot here! I've got a very important job interview tomorrow morning in Breckenridge, so I have to get my car fixed fast! Is there another garage in town?
BUTTERS
Huuuhhhh, no.
MAN
How about a phone? Can we just use the phone?
BUTTERS
Phone here doesn't work. Haa-I'm afraid the only phone that does work... is over in Treasure Cove.
MAN
Fine! Can you take us there?
CRAIG
You... sure you wanna go to Treasure Cove?
WOMAN
Yes.
BUTTERS
Uhh rrreeally are you sure?
MAN
Yes.
BUTTERS
Oh, alright then. [to Craig] Uh, show 'em where it is.
[Downtown Smiley Town. Craig leads the couple down the streets to a white line running down the center of a cross street]
CRAIG
[stops just short of the line] This is the end of Smiley Town. The only phone is somewhere in Treasure Cove. If you wanna find it, you're gonna have to cross the white line.
MAN
Well, can you help us find the phone, please?
CRAIG
Hell no! I'm not crossing the white line.
WOMAN
Why not?!
MAN
Alright, let's just... go, Linda. I don't have time for Spaceman Spiff's little games.
CRAIG
Craig.
MAN
What?
CRAIG
It's Spaceman Craig. [walks away slowly, deliberately, making sci-fi sound effects as he walks. Linda and her husband look at each other baffled. They then walk forward...]
[Downtown Treasure Cove. The couple walks into this town to the sound of ominous music. The town looks worse than Smiley Town does.]
TWO SMALL VOICES
[off screen] Carousel. [the couple notices a shadow between two buildings. The shadow moves away quickly, and the couple walks on. More ominous music comes up as the walking resumes walking]
MORE VOICES
Nah nah nanah nah! [a post falls over, scaring Linda into her husband's arms]
MAN
Look, there's an elementary school [the school has been renamed Treasure Cove Elementary, and it is extremely trashed] Come on, there might be some teachers inside. [the couple heads for the school, but a toy Mega zips by them]
LINDA
[holds on to her husband] What is that? [the truck turns around and comes back] WAAH [raises a foot to avoid being hit by the truck. The truck goes down the street, then turns around and returns once more, stopping in front of the frightened couple] What do you want from us??
MAN
Linda, it's a remote-controlled car. [the truck repositions itself] Looks like maybe there's a little camera on it. [the couple is seen in a little monitor inside the school. The truck does have a camera in it]
LINDA
Mark, I don't like this.
MARK
Relax, Linda, everything's fine. [looks closer at the truck. A little index finger presses on a button named Lemmin Juice. The truck ejects a stream of juice] Ow. [squirt] Ow. [rubs his eyes]
LINDA
[panicking] What is it?! Acid?!
MARK
No, uh, it's lemon juice.
LINDA
Oh God! Are you blind?!
MARK
No, it just really, really, really hurts!
LINDA
Mark? Mark, look. [Mark rubs his eyes, then blinks them to focus. Before him is a line of kindergartners. The two sides stare at each other, then a girl steps forward] Well, hello. What's your name? [the girl just looks back at her] What- what do you want?
JENNY
We wanna play.
LINDA
[panicked, rises] Mark, I'm scared!
MARK
[rises] Don't be scared. They're just kids. [to the kindergartners] Where are your parents?!
FILMORE
We already played with our parents.
JENNY
How, we wanna play wit' youuuu. [points at the couple]
MARK
[silence] ...Okay, I'm scared now, too. That freaked me out.
KINDERGARTNERS
[come at the couple all at once] We wanna play wit' you! [jump on the couple]
MARK
Get off me! [twirls, but the kids don't fall off]
LINDA
Oh God, Mark! Help! [the couple goes towards the dividing line between Smiley Town and Treasure Cove]
FILMORE
[clinging onto Linda] Oh no! She's crossing the white line!
KINDERGARTNERS
Whoa! [fall off the couple and quickly rise to cross the line back to Treasure Cove. Spitballs come flying at them]
KINDERGARTNER
Spitwads! [the launchers are seen: the sixth graders, Pip, Clyde, and Craig, with their straws.]
CRAIG
[space helmet off] Take that, kindergartners!
KINDERGARTNERS
Ew! [all turn to leave. Jenny is the last to go. The older kids and the couple watch them leave]
MARK
What the hell is gong on here?!
CRAIG
[space helmet back on] Kindergartners. Treasure Cove is full of them.
MARK
Alright, kid! We demand to see an adult this instant!
CRAIG
I got new orders. I'm supposed to take you to see the mayor.
MARK
The mayor! Good! Finally!
[Smiley Town City Hall, day. Pictures of Cartman adorn the building and the path to the front door. A large inflatable King Kong floats above the snow and is tethered to the ground below. Craig and Butters lead Mark and Linda into the Mayor's office, where they face Cartman behind the desk, with Dog Poo and Francis as his assistants.. Clyde Frog sits on the desk at Cartman's right side, and his boombox is at left.]
CARTMAN
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won't you come in, please? [Mark and Linda look at each other] Mr. and Mrs. Cotner, as the mayor of Smiley Town, I would like to ask you a few questions.
LINDA
You're the mayor? What the hell is gong on here?! Where are your parents?!
CARTMAN
Parents? [his left-hand assistant (Francis) whispers in his ear and withdraws] Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They're not around.
MARK
No parents in the entire town? What happened to them?
CARTMAN
Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah!
LINDA
Look, just point us to a phone, kid, alright?
CARTMAN
Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service.
MARK
No phones, either? How do you communicate?
CARTMAN
[opens up an empty jar and speaks into it] Butters, I need an ETA on the car, stat. [closes the lid on the jar as Francis waits on him and hands the jar to Francis. He hops down and goes out the door]
MARK
Alright, we've had just about enough here! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen! I don't care what little games you kids wanna play, we just want outta here, alright? [the boy returns with the jar and hands it back to Cartman, who opens it up again]
BUTTER'S VOICE
It's gonna be about three days. [Cartman looks at the couple, who stand speechless]
CARTMAN
[tosses the jar aside, and it breaks] So, it appears that you need me. Which is good, because... I need you, too. [moves a plate of treats forward] Ringy-ding?
MARK
I have the job interview of my life in Breckenridge! Just tell me how to get to a phone or a car!
FRANCIS
SpitBall!
CARTMAN
Aaahh! [jumps from his chair a second before a huge spitball crashes through the window and lands on the floor. He picks himself off the floor and goes to look out the window angrily] You sons of bitches! [turns to the couple] You see what we're dealing with here. Tonight is Carousel. And they will try to kill one of us. Eh, you two seem to have the uncanny ability to cross the white line. If you help us, we'll get you what you need. [Mark and Linda, both unsure, look at each other]
[Dividing line at the John Elway Memorial Park. The couple enters the park, Mark on the left side of the line, Linda on the right side]
LINDA
Mark, are we doing the right thing?
MARK
Look! If getting the stupid book will get me a cell phone, I don't care!
LINDA
I just don't know if you're dealing with these kids the right way.
MARK
[stops and scolds] Well, I told you I can't deal with kids, Linda! That's why I don't want to have children!
LINDA
[encouraging] Hey, I think you'd make a great father.
MARK
Oh, let's not go through this again, Linda. D- [moves forward again. Before them is a 20-ft John Elway statue.] Look, here's the book they've been talking about- [softly] it makes no sense.
LINDA
My God! Mark! [in front of the statue is a small altar on which sit two kids. A dead dog is on the ground, and off to one side is a dead Kenny. Mark approaches him and inspects him closely] What is it??
MARK
It's a boy. [reaches down to touch Kenny. Kenny's left hand and arm have been eaten away, leaving only the bones. Kenny's head turns when Mark touches him, and only the skull remains] They... killed him.
LINDA
The bastards. Oh, Mark, let's get out of here.
KINDERGARTNERS
Nah nah nanah nah!
LINDA
Na-a-ah! [older kids in costume enter the park and line up behind the kindergartners]
MARK
Oh no! [they both turn, only to face another group of kids. Both groups close in on them]
LINDA
Mark!
MARK
[to the kids] Uh. The fat kid told us to take it. [the angry mod captures them]
[Treasure Cove Elementary, evening. Inside, Mark and Linda are tied, asleep and backs to each other, next to a bonfire.]
MARK
[wakes up first] Wuh. Aah! Mark! Mark, wake up! [Mark awakens and both look at the group of kids, from kindergartners to fifth graders, staring back]
KIDS
Nah nah nanah nah! [close in on the couple again]
STAN
You guys, stop it! [glides down from a tall pole in the school gym and jumps to a spot in front of the couple] Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes.
KYLE
[emerges from the group and stands next to Stan] Yeah. [these two head Treasure Cove]
MARK
Why are you doing this?
STAN
How come you wanna help the fatass?!
MARK
Who?
KYLE
The fatass. The mayor.
MARK
Look, I have the job interview of my life in less than- [struggles to view his watch, but finally does] -12 hours! I just need a phone, and he said he'd help me if I took your book so you couldn't... kill them anymore.
STAN
You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!
LINDA
Uh, how did this all happen? Why do you children live in this town alone?
KYLE
Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that.
LINDA
But what about before that?
STAN
You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?
LINDA
Yes!!
STAN
If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?
MARK
I'll do anything to get to a phone!
STAN
Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.
KIDS
The Before time.
BOY
The story of the before time.
STAN
[with a torch, walks up to a chalk drawing on a wall of a family] Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli. [a drawing of broccoli is shown]
KIDS
Yuck, yuck, yuck.
STAN
[walks past a drawing of Cartman] And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. [stops at a drawing of two police officers arresting an adult, with a squad car in the background], by using the magic M word. [a large M is shown]
KIDS
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
STAN
Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider. [a drawing of a statue]
KIDS
Provider. Provider.
STAN
The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry. [an angry Provider shoots bolts of lightning from his body, and two victims are at his feet]
KIDS
Boo!
BOY
Bwack bwack!
KIDS
Coosh!
STAN
So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die. [the two books are shown, with the line between them]
KIDS
Carousel, Carousel.
STAN
We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago.
MARK
Ah-ah-ah-ah,let me get this straight: if I go get the fat kid's book on the other side of the white line, you'll show me where a cell phone is?
STAN
Yes. No foolies.
KIDS
No foolies.
[Treasure Cove Elementary, evening, outside. The couple is still inside]
MARK
No, uh, it's it's it's right out here. Come on. [pushes the front door of the school and it falls away] Linda, I want you to just go back to the car and wait for me, alright? I'll go get that fat kid's book so I can use their phone.
LINDA
Mark, I'm scared. [holds on to him]
MARK
I know, but this will all be over soon.
[Canyon City Maximum Security Prison, day. Sheila, dressed in prison orange, is brought into a large room to join the other adults, and the door is locked behind her.]
SHEILA
Oh, Gerald, I haven't seen you for so long!
GERALD
Hello, honey, how has prison been for you?
SHEILA
Oh, it's awful! Just awful.
SPEAKER
Alright parents, let's all take our seats. [Gerald and Sheila sit] My name is Scott Evans, and I am a prison rehabilitation counselor.
RANDY
Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly never touched our child.
GERALD
Eh, neither did we.
CAROL
We didn't, either.
MR. EVANS
Enough, enough! [all fall silent] Look, it's obvious we have a lot of emotional issues and personal demons to face here. During your prison time, you will all be spending one hour a day in therapy here with me. What I want you to do is learn to control those sick, sexual urges you have. Now we're gonna try an exercise: I'm gonna confront you with what you lust after most. [walks off and brings back a life-size stand-up of "Beaver" Cleaver] Alright parents, now I, I know this is difficult, but I want you to just look at this child. Just try to suppress your urges to rape him. [no response from the inmates] Just think about somethin' else. Think about clouds and beaches. Don't think about his supple, soft little body.
GERALD
Oh, that's disgusting!!! Now, now stop this!!
MR. EVANS
Fight your urges, Mr. Broflovski!
GERALD
I don't have any urges!
MR. EVANS
I can't help you if you won't admit you need help!! Now sit down! [Gerald thinks a moment, then sits down] Look, I know this is very difficult for all of you. Most of you are still in denial about what you've done! To you it seems you've never raped your children at all! But you did. Help meeee help youuuu. [the adults remain silent, no objections] Now let's try again. [genuflects] Look at this young man. Just look. Don't rape. Fight it. Fight it!
[Smiley Town, street. Linda walks out from behind a van.]
LINDA
Oh God, God, please just let us out of this place. [reaches the gas station and is horrified by what she sees. The couple's car has been placed on blocks and thoroughly stripped of its parts. Butters comes out from behind the car with a window handle]
BUTTERS
I think I found the problem, ma'am. A broken window roller-upper.
LINDA
[backs up] Oh no. NO! [turns around and stops in her tracks.] Aaaah! [Cartman's group faces her]
CARTMAN
Where is your husband?
LINDA
Uh, uh...
CARTMAN
Seize her! [the others move forth]
[Treasure Cove Elementary, evening, school gym. Mark has returned]
MARK
Alright, I got the book for you. [hands it to Stan]
STAN
[receives it] Awesu-home!
MARK
Now, can I please have the cell phone?
KYLE
Sure, outlander. I'll get it [starts to move...]
CARTMAN
[outside] Outlander! [all look in the direction of the sound]
[Treasure Cove Elementary, outside. Cartman, holding a taser, leads the Smiley Town members to the school. Linda is bound and gagged, but can still walk]
CARTMAN
Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair!
BUTTERS
Oo what the heck are you talkin' about?
CARTMAN
Butters, calm down, alright?
[Canyon City Maximum Security Prison, day, meeting room.]
MR. EVANS
Okay, so what are some other things that we can do besides molest our children?
MAN
[in back row] See a movie?
MR. EVANS
Sure, "see a movie"'s good. [writes it down on the blackboard] We could see a movie instead of molesting our children. What else?
CAROL
Make a sweater?
MR. EVANS
Uh huh. I'll put ah, "knitting, sewing." [writes them down] Who's got another one?
BLOND MAN
[to Liane's left] Molest children?
MR. EVANS
Nonono, we're looking for things to do besides molesting our children.
BLOND MAN
Oh. Fishing?
MR. EVANS
Fishing's good. Uh huh. [writes that down]
[John Elway Memorial Park, night. The two towns meet at the dividing line, Linda with Smiley Town, Mark with Treasure Cove.]
CARTMAN
I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female gets it! [gives her a small shock]
LINDA
Mmrrhhhh!
CARTMAN
Heh, heheh.
LINDA
Rrrmm-mmrrhh!
MARK
Give him the book back.
STAN
No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!
CARTMAN
We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick!
MARK
Enough of this! You kids are all in big trouble! [goes to ungag his wife, and the statue's clock begins to peal: 8:00 p.m. An electric current makes its way down to a pool of water and returns to the statue, electrifying it. The right arm, holding a football, moves forward]
CARTMAN
The Provider awakes!
STAN
It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.
CARTMAN
Aw, damnit! Alright. [gets formal] It is decided. [points, in normal voice] Butters, your turn. [other kids back away. Tweek and another boy take Butters away.]
BUTTERS
Oh, I'm gonna be sacrificed to the Provider!
MARK
Stop right there! Nobody's killing anybody tonight!
LINDA
Be careful, Mark. They'll make you disappear with the M word.
CARTMAN
Yeah, we'll call the police and say you molestered us, too.
MARK
What? [Butters makes his way to the altar on the dividing line. Tweek and three others monitor him]
BUTTERS
I'm here for you, Provider! Uh, take me! [Tweek and the other three chain him up]
MARK
Is that what happened to the adults here?! You lied to the police and said they molested you?! My God, they were your parents!
STAN
[all the kids turn from the altar and face the couple] Parents?
MARK
The birth-givers! Your birth-givers. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] Don't you remember? They are your providers! Not some statue! And they're not up in some fantastical faraway land now. [beings to walk into the mob of kids] They're in prison. Probably crying themselves to sleep, cold and lonely and... I'm sure missing you all very, very much. [Filmore and Jenny look at each other. Cartman gazes] Your birth-givers took care of you. That's what their laws and their rules were for, because they love you, and they didn't want you to end up living like... th-this! [motions to the statue of John Elway] He won't take care of you. Your parents... your... providers... will.
KYLE
Parents. Mom. Dad.
BUTTERS
Oh boy, here it comes!
MARK
[moves through the crowd again] If you want things to be the way they were in the before time, in the long, long ago, you all need to call the police and tell them you lied about them M word. [stands next to Linda]
STAN
He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around.
KYLE
Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.
MARK
Ten days?? It's only been ten days since they left??
CARTMAN
Take him down. [Tweek and the other three unchain Butters]
BUTTERS
Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway.
KYLE
Here's our cell phone, dude. [hands it to Mark] Will you call the police for us? [Mark begins dialing]
LINDA
Hey. Looks like you're not so bad with kids after all.
MARK
Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe we should have some.
LINDA
Yeah, right. After all this, I'm getting my tubes ties tomorrow! [turns around and starts walking away. Mark is surprised]
[South Park, day, neighborhood street. The town has been cleaned up. The kids stand in front of a house waiting for a bus to roll up. Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Craig hold a banner among them which reads, red letters on yellow background, "Welcome Home, PARENTS!" Butters walks up]
STAN
Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!
KYLE
Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?
STAN
Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner.
LINDA
[shows up with Mark] Hey, kids.
STAN
Hey, you guys came back!
KYLE
Did you make it to your job interview?
MARK
Yeah. I got the job. You're looking at the new manager of Denny's in Breckenridge.
LINDA
And I got my tubes tied.
KIDS
Alright!
KYLE
Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are.
KIDS
Yeah.
BUTTERS
Hey! Here they come! [the sound of a bus is heard. It pulls up and the parents pour out, beginning with the Broflovskis]
KYLE
Mom! Dad!
SHEILA
Kids! [all the parents rush to their kids and hug them]
PARENTS
...Come here, come here.
SHEILA
[holds Ike] Oh, Kyle. Ike, sweetie, you're OK. [Gerald hold Kyle]
KYLE
Yeah. We're fine.
GERALD
Kyle, we're so sorry for the horrible sexual abuse over the years. But we're all better now.
KYLE
But you didn't do anything to me.
GERALD
Hup, we did. We've come to terms with it through therapy and learned to admit it.
SHEILA
It won't happen again. [She and Gerald turn and walk off with Ike.]
KYLE
[lags] But, you guys, I--
SHARON
[she and Randy hold Stan] Oh, Stanley, I wish we could take back all the years of abuse, but we can't.
LIANE
[genuflects next to Cartman] We've learned to overcome it, son. You'll see.
STEPHEN STOTCH
We love you, son, but we only love you in a platonic way from now on.
BUTTERS
Oo-what the heck are you talkin' about?
CAROL
[walks with Stuart] Kenny? Kenny, we're sorry. Where is he?
JENNY'S MOTHER
[she and the father hold Jenny] Everything's gonna be alright now, Jenny. [Jenny's father lets go] Come on, let's go home. [the families begin to disperse. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman stay behind.]
STAN
Huh.
KYLE
Huh.
MARK
[walks up with Linda] Well, what are you kids gonna do now?
STAN
I dunno. [to Kyle and Cartman] You guys wanna build a snow igloo?
KYLE
Sure. [the boys turn left and start walking]
CARTMAN
Snow igloos kick ass. [Mark and Linda stare as if the events of the last ten days didn't leave an impression on the boys]
End of The Wacky Molestation Adventure


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:When Mr. Hankey skips Christmas, the boys find him living with his alcoholic wife and their three little nuggets. He tells them that no one is into Christmas anymore

script:A Very Crappy Christmas

[Kyle's house, night, bathroom. The toilet is seen and on it are a glass and a plate of chocolate-chip cookies. Kyle sits in his pajamas underneath a window and next to a night stand and candle opposite the toilet bowl, and holding a small flag which reads: WELCOME MR. HANKEY. Ike walks in and towards the food]
KYLE
He's gonna be here any minute, Ike.
IKE
[pulls himself onto the seat and looks in] Oooh nooo, poopies.
KYLE
Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike. [lifts him off the seat and takes him back to the night stand] Come sit by me. [they sit down and face the toilet bowl, and wait. Nothing happens.]
SHEILA
[at the door with Gerald] It's getting late, boys. Why don't you come on up to bed.
KYLE
Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does.
SHEILA
Alright, bubbe. [leaves with Gerald, but returns] Oh, and boys? Happy Chanukah.
KYLE
Happy Chanukah, Mom. [returns his sight to the toilet bowl and waits...]
[Kyle's house, night, bathroom. "Silent Night" plays]
IKE
[Waves the flag around] Ayaaa ta. [Kyle is getting drowsy] Weee Weee... [soon, Ike is asleep on Kyle's shoulder as Kyle drifts into sleep, but checks on the plate once in a while. An ant is now on the toilet seat inching its way to the cookies. Kyle watches drowsily until the ant touches the cookies...]
KYLE
Go away!
[The ant scurries away. At length, the candle burns down to the plate and goes out. Kyle and Ike are both asleep. Sheila and Gerald look in once again and find the boys asleep. Sheila picks up Ike and Gerald picks up Kyle and take them to their respective rooms. Kyle is then seen asleep in his room. He opens and blinks his eyes, then gasps and sits up. He rushes out of bed and into the restroom, only to find an empty plate and glass. He thinks Mr. Hankey has been by, until he notices something on the floor to the left of the toilet. A look of dismay comes over his face. It's the ant he sees, now bloated and content. Kyle goes to make a phone call.]
[Stan's house, night, bathroom. "Silent Night" continues]
STAN
[picks up the phone] A-ah huh.
KYLE
[barks. Music stops] Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes!
STAN
Ho-o-oh.
[South Park, night, bus stop. Kyle, with flashlight and crow bar, is waiting as the others arrive. Kenny arrives in coat, hood, and undies. Cartman in pajamas, cap and coat, and Stan fully dressed, but with his cap askew. A lock of hair is seen]
KYLE
Okay, good. You're all here.
STAN
What is this all about, Kyle?
KYLE
It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet.
CARTMAN
Aw, Jesus Christ! I'm going back to bed. [turns aside and walks off]
KYLE
It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come.
CARTMAN
Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay?
KYLE
If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!
[South Park, night, city streets. Snow is still falling, but a manhole cover has been lifted and set aside. Down below, in the sewer, the boys walk in the muck looking for Mr. Hankey's home]
CARTMAN
Heh-tchoo!
KYLE
[turns and glares at Cartman] Dude, you sneezed on my back!
CARTMAN
Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces!
KYLE
Hey, look. [before them is a small cottage in a collection basin. They walk to the end of the sewer line] Hello?
MR. HANKEY
Hoowwddyy ho! [behind him is a little cottage all glittered in light]
KYLE
...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that-
MR. HANKEY
Oh, no I'm fine, Kyle.
KYLE
But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit.
MR. HANKEY
I know, Kyle. I've just been awfully busy with my family. [calls into the house] Honey!
CARTMAN
Family?
MR. HANKEY
Boys, I want you to meet my wife. Autumn.
AUTUMN
Howdy-hey kids! [waves in the same way Mr. Hankey does, holds a martini in her left hand] Would you like a drink?
MR. HANKEY
They're too young to drink, honey.
AUTUMN
Hey haa, it's Christmas!
MR. HANKEY
Come. You have to meet the little nuggets, too. Kids! [they come one one by one] This is our son, Cornwallis.
CORNWALLIS
[wearing glasses, a scarf and little blue beret] Hoowwdy Ho! [hops aside as another nugget enters]
MR. HANKEY
Our daughter Amber.
AMBER
[in pink dress and maroon bow] Hoowwdy Ho! [hops aside as another nugget enters]
MR. HANKEY
And our son, Simon.
SIMON
Eee, hey! Hnhn.
MR. HANKEY
[aside] Simon's not so smart. He was born with a peanut in his head.
SIIMON
Heh What? Dad? Huh?
MR. HANKEY
Nothin', Simon.
KYLE
A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer.
MR. HANKEY
It sure has been tough. Nobody seems that into Christmas out there.
STAN
I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore.
CARTMAN
My moms barely bought me any presents so far.
MR. HANKEY
Well don't worry kids! I'm sending the nuggets up tomorrow to spread Christmas cheer! [the nuggets grin] And if you want, you can help them.
KYLE
Sure we'll help! [Stan grins]
CARTMAN
Anything for more presents!
AUTUMN
"Hic" Weh-hell, it's a Christmas party! Hey! You boys! You boys wanna bet me I won't take off my clothes?
MR. HANKEY
Honey, pleh, you're- you're drunk. Onkay?
AUTUMN
But it's a Christmas party!
MR. HANKEY
Honey, can we go inside for a second? [they enter the little house and start arguing. The boys look on in shock while the nuggets keep their smiles. Abruptly the arguing stops and the two adult poos step out again] Well, it's decided, kids. Tomorrow we're gonna bring back the spirit of Christmas!
[South Park, day, city streets. The boys and the nuggets stand on the sidewalk in front of Tele's and the toy store humming "Good King Wencelas" The nuggets soon hum their own tunes. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny wear nose clips and suits that suggest they are reindeer, while Cartman is dressed as Santa]
CARTMAN
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, you guys! Only three shopping days until- [a couple walks past] God-damnit! [a man walks past in the other direction] Hey! Merry Christmas, asshole! [a woman walks by]
STAN
Nobody's paying any attention. [Amber clears her throat as a foot comes down over Simon, and the foot pulls away]
WOMAN
Ew, I almost stepped in it.
TELE'S OWNER
[exits and locks his door] Well, it was a good effort, boys. But I'm gonna have to close shop. Nobody's buyin' anything an' I can't afford to keep this furnace runnin'! [starts to leave, but notices the nuggets] Oh. And, boys, there's some crap on the sidewalk there. Watch out. [the nuggets look downcast. Red Harris leaves the toy store.]
RED
[locks the door] Not one toy. I guess this yeear, everyone's content to celebrate with candles and love. [starts sobbing, then walks away]
STAN
[emotionally] This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.
[A special report. Behind the anchor is a "No Christmas Trees" sign]
NEWS ANCHOR
And in other news tonight it appears that everyone is officially SICK OF CHRISTMAS! [a chart appears] In an SPC poll, 38% said they were fed up and tired of the holiday, 5% said they were indifferent to it, and a whopping 57% they would quick Bon Jovi square in the balls if given the opportunity. [the field poll follows]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Well, I think people are just fed up with the crowded shopping and the credit-card bills, uh. [the boys sit on Cartman's sofa watching the news] I, I think that the holiday just has become a joke.
MAN
[with a son who waves at the camera] You know, it's just that a lot of people don't really believe in the whole Jesus thing anymore, you know? So what's to celebrate?
MAN 2
Oh yeah. Right in the balls, man. Right square in the balls.
NEWS ANCHOR
Well, the holiday spirit may be gone from South Park, but at least our faith in each other remains strong.
ASSISTANT
[whispers into the anchor's ear] In South Park.
NEWS ANCHOR
Oh really?
[South Park, Cartman's house, day. The report is over]
STAN
Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing. [Cartman clicks the remote, and "A Charlie Brown Christmas" pops up. Charlie, Lucy, and Snoopy are on screen]
CHARLIE BROWN
Good Grief! We need a Christmas tree for our play.
CARTMAN
Oh, Jesus, not this thing again.
STAN
How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?
CHARLIE
[as other kids dance around him] Alright, everyone, we've got to get on with our play!
KYLE
Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!
CARTMAN
Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act.
STAN
[affecting a Peanuts accent] And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this.
CARTMAN
My mom could make a better Christmas special than this!
KYLE
Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it! [drops down from the sofa and walks to the TV] It's so simple!
STAN
What, dude?
KYLE
[turns and faces the other boys] We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town! [Charlie and Linus talk onscreen]
STAN
We don't know anything about animation.
KYLE
How hard can it be? Look at it. [Snoopy and Charlie walk in the woods]
CARTMAN
Hey yeah! We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys!
KENNY
(Yeah, right! Awesome!)
STAN
Yeah! And we can call it... "The Spirit of Christmas" [onscreen, Snoopy is pummeling a naked Charlie Brown hard across the face with a 2-by-4]
[South Park, The Mayor's office, day. The report is over]
MAYOR
[worried] Ogh! This is terrible, Johnson! Our whole town's economy is going right in the toilet! We've got to get everybody back in the Christmas spirit!
AIDE 2
Mayor, some adorable children are here to see you.
MAYOR
Meugh. Send them in.
KYLE
[as the boys enter]Mayor! We have the solution to your problem.
MAYOR
You do?
KYLE
We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.
STAN
It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget.
MAYOR
[falsely enthusiastic] An animated Christmas card. Kids, that just may be the dumbest idea I've ever heard, ever!
THE BOYS
Awww.
MAYOR
But at this point I'm willing to try anything. Johnson, cut them a check for three hundred dollars.
THE BOYS
Alright!
KYLE
[to the other three] You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!
[The Hankey home, day, exterior. Mr. Hankey and Autumn are in a heated argument inside. The argument is incomprehensible for a while, until a voice stands out.]
MR. HANKEY
Now you put that vase down! Put that vase down! That's a very expensive vase! [now warning] Don't you throw that vase! [the vase is thrown and breaks.]
KYLE
[now facing the house from the sewer] Ah, Mr. Hankey?
MR. HANKEY
[exits the front door] Oh, Kyle! Hoowwddy ho!
KYLE
[excited] We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card.
MR. HANKEY
Oh, that's swell! Kids! [the nuggets come out] Christmas is back on! We've gotta all go get that old drive-in workin' again.
THE NUGGETS
Okay!
AUTUMN
That's not the only thing we gotta get workin' again, [pokes him] if you know what I mean...
MR. HANKEY
[concerned] Wha- why do you, why do you have to say things like that in front of people?
KYLE
Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days. [turns and walks away...]
MR. HANKEY
Good luck, Kyle. And we'll have that projector workin'! Don't you worry! [Cornwallis sniffs at himself]
AMBER
What's the matter, Cornwallis?
[Butters' home, day. A gate is open by one side of the house. Inside, the four boys enter a room littered with cutouts]
KYLE
Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've got.
BUTTERS
[behind a desk] Huh, well, okay. Now, don't expect too much with the budget you gave me.
STAN
[impatient] Yeahyeahyeah. just let us see 'em!
BUTTERS
Well, alright. Here's a little paper construction of Santa Claus. [holds him up and moves him a bit] "Ho ho ho, uh, there-a kid. Hu-uh, would you like some- t-hoys and stuff" Hah, and uh, here's a little Jesus. [brings him forth] "Hi there, Santa. I am the Light and the Way, and stuff." [Santa] "Uh, ho o-kay. That's good, I suppose." Huh, and here's the cutout versions of you guys. [unfurls a large sheet which contains some mountains and spitting images of the four boys]
THE BOYS
Whoa!
CARTMAN
[points] Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat.
STAN
[retorts] That's not me, that's you!
CARTMAN
What?!
KYLE
They kind of look like us. [the poster is shown again] I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us.
CARTMAN
I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT! [Butters sets the poster on the desk, face up]
KYLE
God job, Butters.
BUTTERS
Woh, ah, hey! I made a little cutout version of me, too! Ih in case you need it for your animated film.
STAN
[grabs the poster] No, that's okay. [walks away]
KYLE
See ya! [grabs Santa, Cartman grabs Jesus, and they walk away with Kenny]
BUTTERS
Uh-m, alright, alright then. [the door closes, and a few second later, he reaches into a top drawer and pulls out a Barbie cutout. In falsetto...] "Oh, uh, hello, good-lookin'? What's your name?" [moves the Butters cutout] "Huh, Butters, ma'am." [moves the Barbie cutout while in falsetto] "Well, Butters, would you like to slap my- titties around?" [moves the Butters cutout closer] "Whoa! Well, uhuh" [a smile of fantasy flashes across his face] "Uh, no thanks, ma'am. Uh I, I'll get in trouble again." [guiltily puts the cutout away.]
[The Hankey home, day. Inside, Cornwallis is seated at a table with thumb tacks for legs. There are two 5-book stacks on the table, a third stack on the floor behind him, and two books on the floor in front of the table. Mr. Hankey enters, and soon seen are a spool of string for a bedstand and a pencil as a curtain rod. A locket hangs over Cornwallis' bed, and it contains pictures of his parents]
MR. HANKEY
Cornwallis, we've got to go fix up the drive-in.
CORNWALLIS
I don't want to, Dad. I'm too sad.
MR. HANKEY
[takes a seat at the table] Hey, that's alright, Cornwallis. The boys' animated movie will being back the spirit of Christmas.
CORNWALLIS
It's not that, father. Its... Well, I don't feel like I'm really a part of Christmas.
MR. HANKEY
But son, you're a Hankey. We love Christmas!
AUTUMN
[drunk as ever, appears at the door] Come on, it's time to sit around the tree!
MR. HANKEY
[serious] We're having a talk, honey.
AUTUMN
God-damnit it's Christmas and we're gonna be a happy family around the tree!
MR. HANKEY
Autumn, you're drunk. Alright, now, just go help the other kids; they can't get their stockings up.
AUTUMN
That's not the only thing that can't get up around here. [rushes away]
MR. HANKEY
...Now come on, son. Don't be so down.
CORNWALLIS
Why? We're just pieces of crap. Christmas isn't for us.
MR. HANKEY
Christmas is about feeling good. That's for everybody!
CORNWALLIS
I see the Nativity. There's angels, shepherds and sheep. But no poo. All the Christmas movies: Santa, elves, reindeer. No poo. I'm not a part of it.
MR. HANKEY
No, you're not a part of it, Cornwallis. You're all of it. Don't you see?
CORNWALLIS
I'm nothing but crap!
MR. HANKEY
But crap is everything. [begins to sing]
Everything that lives on earth poos in some way
And that's how the cycle happens, each and every day
[Takes Cornwallis out and up to the street]
Just look at the green green grass and the birds up in the sky
[cows graze on the some exposed grass while large birds fly lazily above]
It's all here because of poo, and now I'll tell you why

Grass it's eaten by cattle, which is eaten by women and men
[A cow poops as it eats, then Butters' family is shown eating burgers at table]
It fuses with their bodies and becomes poo again
[Mr. Hankey sings to Cornwallis, then Butters' father is shown straining on the toilet]
And that poo goes through the sewer, where it's dumped into the sea.
[some poo descends through the pipe, and Mr. Hankey soon follows. A raw sewage outlet is then shown with Mr. Hankey exiting]
And it's eaten by the plankton, and becomes the fishes' meal.
[plankton swarm the poo and devour it; a small fish eats the plankton]

And then that bigger fish with the poo still inside
[a bigger fish eats the small fish, but an even bigger one approaches]
Swims up near the shore and gets eaten alive
[the bigger fish swallows the medium-sized one and swims up to the surface, only to be snatched up by a bear]
By the grizzly bear that poos on a dead piece of sand
[the bear walks off with the fish in its mouth and poos as he leaves]
So it can spring to life and become food for the land!
[flowers and grass spring up through and around it. The camera pulls back to reveal an African savannah around the flowers, with all sorts of animals in it]

It's the poo of the antelope, the poo of the giraffe
[soft backup vocals come on, lending the song an African feel. antelope run in the background as a giraffe appears and stops]
It falls onto the earth and becomes the blades of grass
[The camera looks at Mr. Hankey and Cornwallis atop Poo Rock, first from the back, then from the front]
The grass is eaten by the cattle, which comes out the other end
[more cattle are shown grazing and pooing]
To make food for the humans and start all over again
[a man scoops the poo into a small bag and walks off; Butters and family eat more burgers; his mom sits on the toilet]
[back on Poo Rock, before which animals poo freely]

You see, son? You're not an insignificant part of life. You are life.
CORNWALLIS
But how can I be that giraffe and blade of grass, and a human? I don't control what they do.
MR. HANKEY
[sits next to Cornwallis] Just like your heart beats without you thinking about it, so, too, your giraffes and your humans do what they do without you even thinkin' about it. But it is all one life form. It is all... [points to him] you.
CORNWALLIS
[smiles] I think I see now.
I'm the poo of the antelope, that flows down to the ground
[steps forward]
MR. HANKEY
Becomes the grass of tomorrow
CORNWALLIS
Yeah
MR. HANKEY
Which the grazers turn around

[An antelope stops to poo a little, then runs off to join the others]
CORNWALLIS
So I'm the leg of a leopard and the wings of a hen
MR. HANKEY, CORNWALLIS
Which becomes dinner for the human and turns back to poo again.
[Mr. Hankey holds Cornwallis high in the air on Poo Rock with the sky behind them. Cornwallis hums a bit]
That's the Circle, the Circle of Poo!
[Cut to black]
[Stan's house, basement, day. He hands out scripts to the other three boys]
STAN
Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending.
KYLE
No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later. [they walk over to some microphones.]
SOUND MAN
[instructing] Okay, talk directly in the mike and don't hit any hard p's.
KYLE
What's a hard p?
CARTMAN
You know, first thing in the morning when it just won't come out?
KYLE
Oh, yeah.
SOUND MAN
Uumm, okay, sound is speeding, and... [cues the boys by raising his hand]
THE BOYS
We wish you a Merry Christmas
SOUND MAN
Hold on.
KYLE
We wish-
[the sound man presses a few buttons, and some white noise blasts through the boys' headphones]
THE BOYS
[twisting in pain] AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
CARTMAN
...deh..OOOWW!!!
SOUND MAN
Uh, [makes more changes to the sound settings] mmm. Okay, and? [cues the boys]
BOYS
We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas--
STAN
Hey! Wait a minute!
KYLE
What?
STAN
Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?
KYLE
Well, yes, I think so.
STAN
[calmly] Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs. [Kyle cues the piano player, who begins playing]
KYLE
Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,
Dreidel dreidel dreidel--
CARTMAN
[grins] Heheheheh, Chanukah sucks.
KYLE
[throws his headphones off and faces Cartman angrily] Don't you oppress me, fat boy.
CARTMAN
[throws his headphones off] Don't call me fat, buttfucker.
KYLE
Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass!
STAN
You guys, knock it off! We have to record this! [the sound man begins to laugh heartily]
SOUND MAN
[composes himself] Dude, that was awesome.
STAN
What's awesome?
SOUND MAN
The script. It's sweet.
STAN
That's not in the script They do this all the time.
SOUND MAN
Well, it should be in the script. All that "you're fat" and "you're a Jew" and stuff. It's great. [the boys look at each other]
[South Park, Photo Dojo, day. The boys are gathered round a camera, which is pointing straight down onto the poster Butters made for them. Two lights shine on the poster, and the cutouts are in place. Some other heads are at the top end of the poster]
KYLE
Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame.
STAN
Easy.
KYLE
Yeah. So what's the first syllable?
STAN
Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas
KYLE
Okay. So we put little "woo" mouths on all our heads. [sets the "woo" mouths in place] And then we shoot that for one frame.
STAN
Okay. [snaps the shot] One.
KYLE
That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot! [exults]
STAN
Kickass!
KYLE
Now, the next mouth.
STAN
Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas. [both turn aside to look around]
KYLE
Okay, where are the E-mouths?
STAN
[softly] E mouths...
[South Park, Photo Dojo, three hours later. The boys' eyelids are drooping and they're tired]
KYLE
Okay. "Woo" mouths again?
STAN
[snap] 1 [snap] 2.
KYLE
So how much done is that?
STAN
"We wish you a m- Merry"
KYLE
[softly] Aw, [loudly] Jesus Christ!
[South Park Drive-In, night. The boys' eyelids are drooping and they're tired]
MAYOR
[enters the drive-in with her aides] This kids better make a good Christmas movie, Johnson. If people in this town don't start shopping again, we're all gonna be out of jobs next year.
JOHNSON
This... place is pretty run-down.
MAYOR
It's alright, we've got a clean-up crew coming.
MR. HANKEY
[off-screen] Hoowwddy ho! [the Mayor and Johnson look around] Down here!
JOHNSON
[jumps back] WAAGGH!
MAYOR
[displeased] Oh. Mr. Hankey, it's you. How wonderful.
MR. HANKEY
My family and I are here to get the drive-in ready for the biig movie.
AUTUMN
[drunk and still holding a martini, to Johnson] Hi there, Mr. Important Political Person. *hic* [Johnson looks disturbed] You wanna bet me I won't take off my clothes and run naked through this parkin' lot?
MR. HANKEY
[softly blocking] Uh-uh, honey, please don't start!
AUTUMN
I didn't start it! He was looking at my breasts!
MR. HANKEY
They're not real, you know.
AUTUMN
Don't you say that! [hugs him, but he pushes her off]
MR. HANKEY
Oh, big secret! Everyone can tell they're made of silicorn!
JOHNSON
Uhhh, we'll just leave you to your cleanup. [leads the Mayor and the other aide away]
MR. HANKEY
Okay! Boy, oh boy, this place suuure needs a lot of work.
CORNWALLIS
We can fix it up, Dad.
AMBER
Oh, look! A homeless person. [the man is seen sleeping on the ground covered in papers and cardboard] Oh. He looks sad, Papa. [hops over to him and leaves a poo smile on his lips] There. That's better.
MR. HANKEY
Good job, Amber. Now this place is starting to look Christmasy [the man continues to sleep...]
[South Park, Photo Dojo, next day. The boys are back at the animatic further along in the project]
KYLE
Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames. [Cartman sneezes and immediately realizes what he just did]
STAN
AAAAAAAA!
KYLE
Cartman!
CARTMAN
Well, I'm sorry! I have a cold!
STAN
That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!
CARTMAN
Alright! You know what? I have been here TOO LONG! I'm sick of making this stupid cartoon, and we're never goin' to finish it anyways! [walks off and stops at the door] Screw you guys, I'm goin' home!
KYLE
[rushing to the door] Fine! We'll do it with out you!
STAN
We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!
KYLE
We'll dub his voice over.
STAN
Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing!
KYLE
Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.

To people like you, and me.
But don't expect a miracle.
Unless you help make it to be.

You hope, and I'll hurry.
[takes the poster and rolls it up.]
You pray, and I'll plan
[The boys exit the Photo Dojo with it]
We'll do what's necessary, 'cause
[now in Stan's room, works on a Brian Boitano cutout]
Even a miracle needs a hand!
[walks up to the wall and adds a scene to Act II]
KYLE
You love-
STAN
We love
KYLE
-And I'll labor. [takes down the scene]
STAN
Tralala
KYLE
You sit- [puts it up again]
STAN
We sit.
KYLE
-And I'll stand. [a funny look appears on his face]
STAN
Tralalalala
!BOYS
Get help from our next-door neighbor, 'cause

[Kenny begins to hum as the Hankey family is shown cleaning up the drive-in]
BOYS, HANKEYS
Even a miracle needs a hand!

[Autumn is passed out to one side of the film projector as Mr. Hankey cleans up]
[Stan's house, basement, day. Stan and Kyle have to work without Cartman, so they stand wearing headphones and reading the script aloud]
KYLE
You can do Cartman's voice, can't you?
STAN
"Awgh! I'm so fat!"
KYLE
Nuh, you've gotta sound fatter.
STAN
[with tongue filling his mouth] "Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!"
KYLE
Cool! Now let's try the script!
SOUND MAN
Rolling...
STAN
[Doing his and Cartman's parts]
Stan: I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help?
Cartman: I say we help Santa Claus!
KYLE
Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy.
STAN
Cartman: Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew! [both boys grin, and the sound man signals his approval with a thumbs-up]
[Stan's house, living room, day. Kyle and Stan resume singing as Kyle packs the cutouts into a box headed for Korea]
KYLE
You wish-
STAN
We wish
KYLE
-And I'll whittle.
STAN
Tralalalala
KYLE
You sit- [closes the box and tosses it up]
STAN
We sit.
KYLE
-And I'll stand. [displays the box's destination and walks out with it]
STAN
Tralalalala
KYLE
[with Kenny humming] Let's all try to help a little, 'cause
[A group of 20 Korean inbetweeners are shown working hard on the short]
[South Park, Potter's Art Store, day. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny walk out with construction paper]
BOYS
Even a miracle- [a car comes in and runs over Kenny as the driver honks, leaving Kenny flat as a pancake. The boys just look in wonder]
STAN
...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film. [they resume singing and walk away]
[Stan's house, living room, day. Stan and Kyle are there. A large box has come for Stan and he's about to open it]
STAN, KYLE

[South Park Drive-In, night. The drive-in is cleaned up now. The entire town shows up to see the short film. To the left, two klieg lights shine on a high platform on which stand the Mayor and her aides; Stan, Kyle, and Cartman. A decorated Christmas tree stands behind them. On close-up, though, Cartman is missing]
MAYOR
Citizens of South Park, the Colorado Film Commission is pleased to present to you a work by some of our very own South Park children. [the crowd erupts in applause]
CARTMAN
[enters victoriously] Thank you, thank you. [Stan and Kyle look at him annoyed]
KYLE
Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit!
CARTMAN
What are you talkin' about, "quit"? Huh! I don't remember that.
MAYOR
We know that after you see this darling short film, [the crowd is shown] you will all feel the mighty glow of the Christmas spirit once again. Boys?
KYLE
Okay, Mr. Hankey!
MR. HANKEY
[in the booth] O-kay! [starts the projector. The opening screen of "The Spirit of Christmas" is shown as music plays.]
[Scene: a snowy hill. South Park comes into view. A squirrel pops up to see the camera, then drops away next to the town sign. Kids can be heard singing a Christmas carol. The camera pans to the right]
KIDS
We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas--
STAN
Hey! Wait a minute!
KYLE
What?
STAN
Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?
KYLE
Yeah, I think so.
STAN
(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas!
KYLE
What?
STAN
You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs!
KYLE
Dreidel dreidel dreidel-
[the film snaps in two and grinds to a halt. Fear strikes the boys' faces, then the Mayor's face. The film spools out of the reels and Mr. Hankey holds the unwound film in his hands]
SIMON
Eehhhh, pretty! [the crowd begins to disperse and grumble]
MAN
Oh, that's Christmas for ya.
MAYOR
Uhuh, just hang on folks. We seem to be having some technical difficulties.
MAN 2
Boring.
MAN 3
I've gotta go.
MAN 4
Stupid.
MR. HANKEY
[as the boys enter the projection booth] It's completely destroyed! There's nothin' I can do!
KYLE
All that hard work.
MAYOR
Well, thanks a lot, kids. Great idea you had there. Now everyone is more disenfranchised with Christmas than ever. We want our three hundred bucks back!
KYLE
But we spent it!
MAYOR
Fine. Then we'll sue you. [leaves with the aides] Johnson? [the other aide stays behind]
AIDE
I... used to believe in miracles. [leaves]
KYLE
All that work!
STAN
For nothing.
MR. HANKEY
Boys, I uh, I'm s-, I'm sorry.
KYLE
Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey.
CARTMAN
I guess- we might as well- go home now. [the boys leave and Mr. Hankey wilts]
[The Hankey home, night. Inside, Mr. Hankey sits on the little sofa. Cornwallis hops up to him and joins him on the sofa]
MR. HANKEY
It's my fault. All my fault. I got everyone's hopes up.
CORNWALLIS
But Dad, we can fix the projector.
MR. HANKEY
Aw, it's too late for that, son. everyone' gone home. And I don't know nothin' about projectors. I'm just a stupid piece of crap.
CORNWALLIS
Dad, you taught me an important lesson: That crap is the cycle of everything.
MR. HANKEY
Aw, that was just a stupid song, Cornwallis! I was jus' tryin' to get you to stop your bitchin'
CORNWALLIS
No, it wasn't a stupid song. Because you showed me that I have the power and the strength to do anything I want. You made me believe in myself, Dad! Now I'm asking you to do the same.
MR. HANKEY
Son... [reflects for a moment] You're the smartest piece of crap since Albert Poodinger! Come on! [the two of them leave the house]
[The Marsh house, living room, night. The immediate family is gathered]
SHARON
Isn't this a nice Christmas, Stanley? No commercialism and shopping, just a nice fire and family.
GRANDPA
I wanna die. [sleigh music is heard and a light soon fills the air outside. All the Marshes look]
[A view of the suburbs. Lights come on all over the neighborhood, and families begin to come out of their houses. one girl and her parents, another girl and her parents, a boy and girl and their parents, etc. The light everyone sees is the drive-in screen. The short has been repaired and is airing the scene where the boys first meet Jesus. The drive-in soon fills up]
[On screen, Jesus floats down from the sky.]
KYLE
What the--
KENNY
(Nooo!!) [tightens his hood]
[The Broflovski house, night. The front door opens and Gerald and Sheila step out with Ike. Kyle follows them out.]
KYLE
They did it! They got it working! [closes the door behind him]
[On screen.]
JESUS
You have blemished the meaning of Christmas for the last time, Kringle!
SANTA
I bring happiness and love to children all over the world.
JESUS
Christmas is for celebrating my birth!
SANTA
Christmas is for giving!
[A shot of the audience]
CROWD
Oh, wow!
[The Hankey house. Amber and Simon stand outside]
AMBER
Mom! They got it working!
AUTUMN
[opens the front door and exits without closing it] What's that? They got your father's penis workin' again? [the three of them leave]
[A shot of Stan, Kyle, and Cartman smiling. On screen...]
KYLE
...We actually spoke—to the Brian Boitano.
STAN
Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu. Christmas still is about one very important thing.
CARTMAN
Yeah, ham.
STAN
[angrily] No not ham!
[The audience. The boys laugh]
CARTMAN
Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?!
KYLE
Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted.
[On screen...]
STAN
...Christmas is about something much more important!
KYLE
What?
STAN
[voice softens] Presents.
KYLE
[softly] Ah.
STAN
Don't you see, Kyle?
KYLE
Yeah.
STAN
Presents.
[The audience...]
VARIOUS FOLK
...Presents.
MAN 5
My God, they're right!
MR. MACKEY
Christmas is about presents. If we all buy presents, everyone benefits. M'kay?
RANDY
That is the spirit of Christmas. Commercialism. Because it's what makes our country work!
MAYOR
They're starting to understand, Johnson.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
We got so caught up in the little things of Christmas, like love and family that... we almost forgot it's buying things that makes our economy thrive.
MAYOR
[wearing a handlebar mustache, in falsetto] Hey, the shops are still open. We still have time to shop. [the crowd starts to clamor in agreement, and soon the shops around South Park turn their lights on. Red Harris opens his toy shop up, and the crowd fills the streets, first cheering, then chatting]
KYLE
You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!
MR. HANKEY
No, you did it, boys!
AUTUMN
Aw, hell, we all did it!
MAYOR
Kids, that cartoon was fabulous. How would you like to have your own show and make 100 more of them?
STAN
Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.
CARTMAN
Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents.
KYLE
[to Stan] Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days.
STAN
Wow! Count me in!
CARTMAN
Yeah! I'll be a Jew too.
BOYS
[leaving with the Mayor]
Dreidel dreidel dreidel
I made you out of clay
Dreidel dreidel dreidel
With dreidel I will play!
[End of A Very Crappy Christmas. Rats rush in from all sides and nibble on Kenny's body.]
