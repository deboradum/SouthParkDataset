synopsis:Cartman is jealous of the friendship that’s developed between Kyle and Tolkien and decides to do something about it.

script:Cupid Ye

[South Park Elementary. The students talk amongst themselves in the hallways. Stan, Kenny and Cartman are seen rummaging through their lockers, then Kyle and Tolkien approach them.]
KYLE
Hey, dudes.
STAN
Hey, what's up?
KYLE
Just wondering if you guys have seen me and Tolkien's latest TikTok?
STAN
You guys made another TikTok?
TOLKIEN
I think it's really our best one yet!
CARTMAN
Yeah, nobody really gives a shit about your TikToks, guys. [Bebe and Red walk by.]
BEBE
Hey, really great TikTok guys!
KYLE AND TOLKIEN
Oh, thanks!
RED
Yeah, it was pretty amazing.
TOLKIEN
Awesome.
KYLE
Well, anyway you guys gotta check it out when you get a chance. See ya later!
TOLKIEN
Yeah, see you guys!
[As Kyle and Tolkien walk by, the other boys look at them, confused. Butters walks into the next frame.]
BUTTERS
Hey, fellas! Loved that last TikTok!
TOLKIEN
Thanks, Butters!
[Playful music starts to play, and then it cuts to a TikTok video of Kyle and Tolkien. As the video plays, the two of them are seen using face filters while lip-syncing the lyrics of the song.]
[Konnichiwa
Sayonara
Kochi, kochi, kochi
Sayonara]
[Then, it cuts to Cartman, Stan and Kenny watching the TikTok, perplexed at what they are looking at.]
CARTMAN
What the fuck is this? Seriously, what the fuck is this? Have you guys noticed that Kyle and Tolkien are, like, doing everything together lately?
STAN
Yeah, they're quite the little team, aren't they?
[The frame cuts to Tolkien and Kyle together, with Kyle recording Tolkien playing with a tetherball. Stan sees this and looks sad.]
STAN
I, uh... I'm gonna go inside, guys. I'm gonna get some homework done. [He walks away.]
CARTMAN
Wow. I feel really bad for Stan. It's gotta be hard to suddenly have your best friend always hanging with someone else.
KENNY
(Yeah.)
CARTMAN
I gotta see if there's some way I can help. There's a little voice inside of me that can't stand to see my friend suffer.
KENNY
(What are you gonna do?)
CARTMAN
I'm gonna be a good Christian.
[Music Room. The kids are practicing with their instruments, although their perfomance is much to be desired.]
MR ROMERO
Okay, just the woodwinds for this section.
[The woodwinds section plays, poorly... The frame cuts to Cartman walking over to Tolkien, shoving a student away from their seat so he can sit down next to him.]
CARTMAN
Hey, Tolkien! What's goin' on?
TOLKIEN
This is the brass section.
CARTMAN
Yeah, I know. I was just - I was noticing that you're kind of hanging out a lot with Kyle lately.
TOLKIEN
Is there a problem with that?
CARTMAN
No, I think it's amazing. It's awesome that someone like you could be okay with someone like him, given all the new information lately.
[Tolkien tries to continue playing his trumpet, in an attempt to ignore Cartman.]
CARTMAN
You know, the stuff that's come out about how the Jews stole the black race's identity, that the lost tribes of Judah were actually all Africans. [He plays his clarinet, poorly.] You didn't hear about this? Black people are actually the Jews and people like Kyle have taken that from them?
TOLKIEN
[Visibily annoyed] Stop talking to me.
CARTMAN
When the Jews came to America to escape persecution in World War II, they found that Blacks were already the underclass in America, so they had to invent a story for themselves which they can make everyone believe... [The music in the room comes to a sudden stop] ...because Kyle runs Hollywood!
[The room goes silent. Everyone in the classroom looks at Tolkien and Cartman.]
CARTMAN
[quietly] Kyle runs Hollywood, Tolkien.
[The bells rings and the class is dismissed. Tolkien stops for a moment to think, and then walks away. Cartman smiles to himself.]
[Cafeteria. Stan is sitting by himself, fiddling with his school lunch. Moments later, Kenny and Cartman sit with him.]
CARTMAN
Hey, Stan. Guess what? I have some good news for you.
STAN
What?
CARTMAN
A little magic fairy told me that you and Kyle are gonna get back together soon.
STAN
I don't care that Kyle is making TikToks with Tolkien.
CARTMAN
Yes, you do. But don't worry, Stan. It's almost Valentine's Day. And the little angel on my shoulder says that Kyle is gonna come running back to you any minute!
[Just as Cartman predicted, Kyle walks in, much to Stan's surprise.]
KYLE
Hey, Stan.
STAN
Oh! Hey, Kyle.
KENNY
(Woah.)
CARTMAN
Uh-huh.
STAN
Well, dude, do you wanna sit down?
KYLE
Oh, no sorry. I was actually just seeing if you had a phone charger I could borrow. Me and Tolkien are making another TikTok video and my stupid phone died!
STAN
[dissapointedly] Oh, yeah, sure...
[As Stan looks through his stuff to find a phone charger, Kenny and Cartman are left without much to say.]
KYLE
Thanks, dude! [walks away] Tolkien, I got one, dude!
[After Kyle leaves, Stan looks down sadly.]
CARTMAN
The fuck is going on?
STAN
Well... um, I'm gonna head back to class, guys. [He takes his food tray and leaves the table, looking down sadly.]
CARTMAN
I don't get it. The little cupid is always right.
KENNY
(Well, not this time.) [walks away]
CARTMAN
Why didn't Tolkien listen?
[Then, harps begin to play as "Cupid Ye" appears next to Cartman.]
CUPID YE
Did you tell him about the Black Hebrew tribes?
CARTMAN
Yeah, I told him everything, Cupid Ye!
CUPID YE
Tee hee hee! [he takes off his shades] And did you tell him how the Jews stole Black people's identity?
CARTMAN
Yeah, but it didn't work, Cupid Ye.
CUPID YE
That's okay, Eric! Remember, being a good Christian means helping people even when it's hard.
CARTMAN
You're right, Cupid Ye. Can you help make sure Tolkien hears our message?
CUPID YE
Spreading information is like spreading love. I'll help you get the word out, Eric! Tee hee hee! Tee hee heeeee!
[Some time later. Tolkien and Kyle are watching their newest TikTok. It's them dancing to the song "Pretty Girls Walk" by Big Boss Bette.]
KYLE
Wow, that's so cool, Tolkien! Look how many likes we're getting for this one.
[Clyde and Scott walk into frame and approach Kyle and Tolkien.]
CLYDE
Hey, Kyle, you got a minute?
KYLE
Yeah, what's up?
CLYDE
Well, there's this rumor starting to go around the school. Kids are saying that, like... I don't know, that, like, you run Hollywood?
KYLE
What?
CLYDE
I told Scott that that's just people being dumb and he shouldn't listen to stuff like that. [beat] But... Scott and I do have this sweet movie idea about a dude who has guns for hands and we have the first 20 pages written, so... [another beat] You don't really run Hollywood, right?
KYLE
[angrily] I'm not even going to justify that with a response. Because repeating a derogatory slur, even for the purpose of refuting it, can make stupid people think it's valid! [he storms off]
CLYDE
Holy shit, Kyle runs Hollywood...
SCOTT
Kyle runs Hollywood, and you fucked up the pitch!
CLYDE
How'd I fuck up the pitch?!
SCOTT
You gotta tell him what the stakes are. People who make movies, they just care about the stakes!
CLYDE
The guy has guns for hands!
[PC Principal's office. Cartman and Kyle are sitting down, as Kyle has his arms crossed and looks away angrily.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Mr. Cartman, did you or did you not tell students at this school that Kyle runs Hollywood?
CARTMAN
I think... I did say that, yes.
PC PRINCIPAL
And why would you say such an intolerant, offensive thing like that?!
CARTMAN
Somebody runs Hollywood.
KYLE
Lots of people run Hollywood!!
CARTMAN
Yes, lots of... people like Kyle.
PC PRINCIPAL
Mr. Cartman, you are on dangerous frickin ground here, buddy!
CARTMAN
I'm sorry, why is it so offensive to say who runs Hollywood? People like Hollywood. Hollywood's cool. The Jews should be honored to be in charge of it.
PC PRINCIPAL
Hey! I am telling you right now, Eric. The next time anyone says anything about Kyle running Hollywood, that person is gonna have two months detention!
CARTMAN
Two months?! Jesus, Mary mother full of grace... You guys really take this seriously.
[Cartman's hot dog house. Nighttime. Cartman peeks over to check if his mother is sleeping. He closes his door and walks over to a table with a lit candle and kneels down in prayer.]
CARTMAN
Please help me be the best Christian I can be. All I want is to help people, but nobody understands. Please, I can't do this alone.
[Harps begin to play. It's Cupid Ye again.]
CUPID YE
Tee hee hee!
CARTMAN
There you are, Cupid Ye!
CUPID YE
Sorry, Eric, I was just busy praising our Savior's name in the music studio!
CARTMAN
The principal said I can't talk about Kyle running Hollywood anymore, Cupid Ye!
CUPID YE
Well, of course, Eric! They're trying to silence you! That's what they do.
CARTMAN
Who's "they"? Oh, right... "them".
CUPID YE
Tee hee hee! Jews!
CARTMAN
But Cupid Ye, I have to get to Tolkien or else Stan is gonna be sad forever!
CUPID YE
Okay! I'll help you help your friend however I can. You're such a good Christian, Eric.
CARTMAN
Thanks. Just, don't do anything too drastic, okay?
CUPID YE
What do you mean?
CARTMAN
I dunno, it's just... ever since you changed your name and got all into Jesus, you've been acting a bit bat shit crazy, Cupid Ye.
CUPID YE
Tee hee hee! Don't worry, Eric! I'm gonna make everything better! [he flies away]
[Credigree Weed. Cupid Ye is seen flying to the resident.]
CUPID YE
Praiiiise Jesus!
[Tolkien's bedroom. Tolkien is sound asleep. Cupid Ye barges inside through the window.]
CUPID YE
Tee hee! Tee hee hee hee hee! [he approaches Tolkien and whispers to him] The true Jews of Israel are your Black ancestors... Tee hee hee...
TOLKIEN
[in his sleep] Huh...?
CUPID YE
You think you and Kyle make TikToks together? Kyle only cares about money. Tee hee hee...
TOLKIEN
[mumbling] Mmmm...?
CUPID YE
Think about it. Are you really making TikToks together, or is Kyle profiting off of you?
[Outside of Tolkien's bedroom. Steve is walking by the hallway, looking at his phone. "Cupid Ye" continues his speech, and he hears this and stops.]
"CUPID YE"
It's just like the tribes of Israel. Kyle wants to take all the credit for what you're doing.
[Steve opens the bedroom door.]
STEVE
Tolkien?
[The scene cuts to what seems like Cartman in a disguise rushing out of Tolkien's bedroom through the window. He struggles, but is successful in escaping.]
CARTMAN
Oh, Jesus!
[South Park Elementary. The next day. Kyle is walking through the hallways and sees other students muttering to themselves. He stops by Tolkien's locker to talk with him.]
KYLE
Hey, I didn't see you at the playground. Thought we were doing that morning TikTok.
TOLKIEN
Oh yeah, sorry. I didn't get the best sleep last night.
KYLE
Everything okay?
[Jimmy walks up to Kyle and Tolkien.]
JIMMY
Hey, Kyle! How's it going, man?
KYLE
Good, Jimmy. How are you?
JIMMY
Great! F-F-Fantastic!
[Beat.]
KYLE
Is there something you wanted, Jimmy?
JIMMY
Oh, yeah! I just realized I've never given you my headshot! [he hands Kyle a picture of himself] You know, just in case anything ever comes up.
KYLE
Anything like what?
JIMMY
Anything like... Anything you might need my headshot for.
KYLE
[frustrated] Jimmy, I do not run Hollywood!
JIMMY
Well, that's not what everyone's saying.
KYLE
[louder] Everyone! I do not run Hollywood! Get a fucking clue!
[Everyone else leaves, except for Tolkien.]
KYLE
God dammit! This thing has gotten out of control!
TOLKIEN
Ah, it's not a big deal.
KYLE
It's a huge deal! It's an attack on my ethnicity, Tolkien! You don't understand!
TOLKIEN
I don't understand?
KYLE
Yeah, Tolkien. There's lots of Black people in the NBA, but nobody says, "The NBA is run by Black people!"
TOLKIEN
That's because the NBA is run by white people!
KYLE
Okay, yeah good point.
TOLKIEN
Look, I'm sorry. You wanna just go make that morning TikTok?
KYLE
Yeah, sure. We still have time.
TOLKIEN
Cool, come on!
[Kyle and Tolkien both walk away. The camera pans to Stan, Cartman and Kenny sitting by the stairs, watching them. Stan looks sad, and grabs his backpack as he starts to leave.]
CARTMAN
Stan? Sometimes, Jesus works slowly.
STAN
Stop talking to me. [he leaves]
[The Broflovski residency. Randy walks up to the front door and rings the doorbell. Gerald answers.]
RANDY
Hey, Ger. You got a minute to talk?
GERALD
Yeah, what's up, Randy?
[The kitchen. Gerald and Randy are having a cup coffee as they begin their conversation.]
RANDY
Look, I - I know that boys will be boys and as parents, we can't always control what their personal decisions are.
GERALD
No, of course not.
RANDY
I just want you to know first off that... your son is a great kid. You know, Stan and Kyle have always been really close, and I know their friendship meant so much.
GERALD
What's happened, Randy?
RANDY
[Kyle listens to the conversation from the living room. Randy exhales.] Well Gerald, I don’t know if you can just talk to your son but… can we just admit this whole woke thing isn’t working?
GERALD
Woke thing?
RANDY
I mean, it’s been great in so many ways, but… now it’s like every movie and every TV show. You know it’s like you can see through it now. Audiences want to be entertained. They don’t want to be preached at, and if you’re just doing shows and movies that have an agenda, it’s like-- it’s just going to keep failing.
GERALD
Randy, what are you talking about?
RANDY
Box office is down, people are tuning out. You know it’s what killed the Marvel franchise. And just as a side note, I’m gonna say it out loud: “Avatar 2” sucked. It just sucked, Gerald. Someone had to be brave enough to say it.
KYLE
[Kyle walks into the kitchen angered.]God dammit! I do not fucking run Hollywood!
RANDY
Gerald, can you talk to him?
GERALD
Kyle, what is he talking about?
KYLE
He’s just being an idiot and listening to what fucking Eric Cartman said!
RANDY
I did not hear it from Eric Cartman. I heard it from a prominent, respected artist on television.
KYLE
Who?!
[A news television set, a female anchor sits along a Cartman hiding his identity.]
NEWS ANCHOR
Our next guest is a world famous rapper and artist who claims that the Jews run Hollywood. What exactly do you mean by that?
CARTMAN
Well, mostly I just mean that Jews control everything we see on TV and the movies.
NEWS ANCHOR
And why do you not want to show your face right now?
CARTMAN
Well, that’s ‘cause there’s this one Jew -- um, his name is Kyle. And he can totally retaliate me, ‘cause he like, runs Hollywood.
CUPID YE
[Cupid Ye flies up to Cartman’s shoulder holding a bible, also hiding his identity.] Yeah, and Jews try to silence people all the time. Yeah, especially black people.
CARTMAN
Yeah, especially black people.
[Tolkien’s house, Tolkien is watching the interview on the living room’s TV.]
CARTMAN
[Cartman keeps talking on the TV while Tolkien watches.] That’s because of all the new information lately. The new information about how the chosen people were actually Africans.
CARTMAN
[Back at the new’s station.] So, you know, black people have really been hurt by the Jews.
CUPID YE
Yeah, so Hitler actually wasn’t a bad guy.
CARTMAN
Yeah, so-- woah, woah, Cupid Ye. That’s going a bit too far. He’s just trying to be shocking.
LINDA
[Back at Tolkien’s living room.] What are you watching, honey?
TOLKIEN
I have no idea.
[South Park’s townpark, Tolkien and Kyle are recording a new TikTok. TikTok interface on the screen as Tolkien and Kyle are recorded.]
TOLKIEN
[With a high pitched playback voice.]
Mommy?
KYLE
[With a high pitched playback voice.]
What is it, Caillou?
TOLKIEN
[With a high pitched playback voice.]
Can I get Roblox on my Xbox?
KYLE
[With a high pitched playback voice.]
Sure thing, Caillou, as long as it’s free.
TOLKIEN
[With a high pitched playback voice.]
Oh for sure it is for free.
KYLE
Okay, wait, wait, cut. Hang on. [Out of the TikTok interface.] Let’s try again. I think you forgot the words.
TOLKIEN
Yeah, sorry. I’m just tired. I didn’t get the best sleep last night. Maybe I should do the mom part.
KYLE
Nah, you do the kid part. It’s funnier.
TOLKIEN
Okay, yeah. I guess you call the shots.
KYLE
What’s that supposed to mean?
TOLKIEN
Just means you’re in charge.
KYLE
Oh, I’m in charge. Like I, control things? Huh, are you gonna start saying I run Hollywood now too?
TOLKIEN
I didn’t say you run Hollywood And honestly, I’m getting kind of sick of hearing it.
KYLE
You’re sick of hearing it?
TOLKIEN
Yeah, I’m sick of hearing it.
KYLE
[Cartman creeps up from the bushes.] Oh my God, are you listening to yourself? You of all people should have some compassion!
TOLKIEN
Oh, really? Why me of all people, Kyle?
KYLE
[Cartman smiles at the fight from behind the bushes.] You seriously don’t know why? You know that Jews have stood alongside Blacks since the Civil Rights movement began, right?
TOLKIEN
What does that have to do with anything?
KYLE
I’m just saying I thought you’d be a better friend. ‘Cause you’re like…
TOLKIEN
’Cause I’m like what? Black?
CARTMAN
[From behind the bushes.] Oh my God, this is so awesome.
KYLE
Whatever, Tolkien. Now you’re gonna act like I somehow did something wrong to you.
TOLKIEN
No, you didn’t do it to me. It just seems to work out that way all the time for you people.
KYLE
You people?! No, it works that way for you people!
TOLKIEN
You know what? I don’t wanna make TikToks with you anymore! [Cartman jumps and celebrates from behind the bushes.]
KYLE
[Kyle takes the tripod and prepares to leave.] I don’t wanna make TikToks with you anymore!
TOLKIEN
Good!
KYLE
Good!
CARTMAN
[Both Tolkien and Kyle leave in opposite directions.] We did it. I can’t believe we did it!
CUPID YE
Praise Christ! They’ll probably never talk again!
CARTMAN
And now Stan can have his best friend back.
CUPID YE
Yeah! And we can spread our Nazi message all over the world!
CARTMAN
Woah, woah, okay. Cupid Ye, you mean our Christian message.
CUPID YE
It’s the same thing! Christian message, Nazi message. Hitler was a great Christian!
CARTMAN
Cupid Ye, are you okay? Do you need to, like, talk to somebody?
CUPID YE
I mean it! People have to die so that the better races can live.
CARTMAN
Okay, Cupid Ye, time to go back inside.
CUPID YE
[Cartman tries to catch Cupid Ye but he escapes from him while laughing.] Teehee, teeheehee, tee hee hee.
CARTMAN
C’mon, let’s go, Ye!
CUPID YE
I don’t think so, dawg! Let’s go torch some motherfuckers!
[Cupid Ye crashes into the window of a car, the alarm of the car goes blaring. Cupid Ye wires the vehicle and begins to drive recklessly, crashing into the car parked behind it, and tires squealing towards the front.]
CUPID YE
Dethcon one, bitches!
CARTMAN
Yeeeee! [Cupid Ye drives away, crashing into another car and taking a hard turn left.]
CARTMAN
Yeeeeeeeeee! Oh, shit.
[Stan’s room, Carman knocks on the door agitated.]
STAN
Yeah?
CARTMAN
[Cartman barges into the room, closing the door and locking it behind him.] Stan! We aren’t safe!
STAN
What?!
CARTMAN
[Cartman proceeds to lock the windows, as well.] He’s totally gotten crazy! I don’t think I can reason with him anymore!
STAN
Reason with who?
CARTMAN
Stan, listen to me. There’s someone who’s been messing with Kyle and Tolkien. He said it was to be a good Christian, but… But I think he’s just been using Christianity as an excuse to be a racist piece of shit.
STAN
What did you do?
CARTMAN
Not me, Stan! This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but… There’s a little magic angel that comes each year around Valentine’s Day. He spreads love and brings lonely people together. But this year is different. Cupid Me found Christ and changed his name. And I have to find a way to get him back on his meds.
STAN
Dude, Cartman, are you okay? Do you need to, like, talk to somebody?
CARTMAN
Stan, do you believe in Santa Claus?
STAN
[Shrugs.] Yeah.
CARTMAN
Do you believe in the Easter Bunny?
STAN
[Shrugs.] I guess so.
CARTMAN
Then believe that tomorrow is Valentine’s Day… and there’s no telling what Cupid Ye is capable of.
[Valentine’s Day at South Park Elementary. Kids are seen exchanging Valentine’s love letters in the hallways.]
BUTTERS
[Butters is giving love letters to some of the students.] Happy Valentine’s Day, Clyde! Here’s a Valentine for you, Red!
MR. MACKEY
Ah, Valentine’s Day. Isn’t it nice? Love is in the air!
[School’s bathroom. A close up to Cupid Ye’s hands as he’s preparing his different arrows. Cupid Ye had decorated the bathrooms as an altar to Hitler. “Gold Digger” by Kanye West plays in the background.]
CUPID YE
Dee deet, deedle-y doo! I ain’t sayin’ she a gold digger! But she ain’t messin’ with no broke Jew!
[A knock on the door. Cupid Ye takes a puff from a cigarette.] Who is it? Teehee.
CRAIG
Hey! Asshole! Other people need to use the bathroom too!
CRAIG
[Kenny kicks the door down, he and Craig walk into the bathroom and see all the Valentine’s decorations for Hitler.] Woah… dude…
CUPID YE
Happy Valentine’s Day, bitch!
CRAIG
What the hell?!
CUPID YE
How about a little antisemitism?!
CRAIG
[Cupid Ye fires an arrow at Craig.] Ugh! [Craig’s face falls blankly and hearts with Nazi Swastikas appear floating around him.]
KENNY
(Aaaaghagaah!!!) [Kenny runs away from the bathroom, scared.]
CUPID YE
Teehee Tehehehe.
[Cupid Ye comes out of the bathroom laughing and proceeds to fire arrows at the different students, panic ensues as the children begin to yell. As the students are hit by the arrows, their faces fall blankly and hearts with Nazi Swastikas float around them, just like Craig.]
CUPID YE
Teehee Teeheehee Teeheehee.
[Cupid Ye crashes into the window to the computer labs and continues shooting arrows at the different students.]
GIRL 1
What is that?!
STAN
[At the entrance of the school.] Tolkien! Tolkien I need to talk to you.
TOLKIEN
About what?
STAN
Tolkien… I owe you an apology. Someone has been messing with you… and it was all for me.
TOLKIEN
I don’t get it.
STAN
I’ve been jealous about you and Kyle’s TikToks. [Glass shatters. Stan and Tolkien jump. Students scream as Cupid Ye fires arrows to them in the hallways.]
CUPID YE
Teehee Teeheehee.
[Kyle is walking through the hallways slowly, a kid passes him screaming and he perks up an eyebrow, suddenly, a wave of kids screaming run in his direction.]
MR. MACKEY
[Over P.A.] Attention students! There is a giant bee in the school! Get somewhere safe! There’s a giant bee! Oh, Jesus, here it is!
CUPID YE
[Over P.A.] Teeheehee Teeheehee.
MR. MACKEY
[Over P.A.] Oh, God, it’s a bee!
CRAIG
[Kyle starts running away, Craig, Kevin Stoley and a group of students shot by Cupid Ye’s arrows corner him.] Look, there he is!
KEVIN
What do you think you’re doing, Kyle?
KYLE
W-What do you mean?
CRAIG
A “Lord of the Rings” prequel?! What were you thinking?!
KEVIN
How many more superheroes do you think we need?!
BUTTERS
Mario Brothers, Kyle?! You seriously can’t do better than Mario Brothers?!
TOLKIEN
[Kyle tries to walk away but the group follows him, Tolkien and Stan run to the scene and wall him to protect him.] That’s enough, you guys!
KYLE
Tolkien?
TOLKIEN
I’m sorry, Kyle.
STAN
It’s not his fault, it’s mine. I was jealous of you guys and your TikToks.
CUPID YE
[Cupid Ye flies into the scene, above the group of students hypnotized.] What are you waiting for?! Let’s jack up these mofos!
KYLE
Holy shit!
TOLKIEN
What the hell is that?!
CARTMAN
[Out of frame.] Cupid Yeeeeee!! [The group turns around to stare at Cartman as he holds a bottle of pills. Cartman shakes the bottle.] Time to take your meds.
CUPID YE
No! Those are how people control me!
CARTMAN
[Cartman starts walking towards Cupid Ye.] You’re taking your meds, Ye! One way or another! [As the mob of hypnotized students tries to stop him, Cartman punches them away.]
CUPID YE
[Cartman grabs Cupid Ye from flight and throws him to the ground.] No! I’m not taking!--
CARTMAN
You’re taking your medication! [Cupid Me tries to escape.]
CUPID YE
Let me go, I’m not t--
CARTMAN
You’re taking it, Ye! [Cupid Me struggles, Cartman holds him back.] Swallow it, swallow it! Swallow it, swallow it! [Cupid Me grunts as Cartman shoves the pills into his mouth.] Ye? Ye?
[Cupid Ye appears to be unconscious on the floor, with the trill of a harp, his clothes disappear and go back to the normal Cupid Me appearance.]
CUPID ME
Eric?
CARTMAN
Cupid Me?! You guys! It's Cupid Me! He’s back!
CUPID ME
[Cartman looks back at the group of students including Tolkien, Kyle and Stan, who just stare confused at him.] What day is it?
CARTMAN
Why, it’s Valentine’s Day, Cupid Me!
CUPID ME
Valentine's Day?! Well then I need to get to work! [Cupid Me flies up into the air.] Teeheehee Teeheehee!
CARTMAN
[Cartman cheers.] Yeah!
[Cupid Me comes back to his senses and flies around, firing love arrows at the students of South Park Elementary.]
[At a conference, a woman, two older men, Kyle, Stan and Tolkien.]
CONFERENCE WOMAN
We have a young man who is joining us here today to… talk about stereotypes and the harm that they can bring. Young man, what is your message.
KYLE
My message is, we can't control what people say, so we have to be smart about what we choose to believe. If one idiot says that a certain group "runs Hollywood", look into it. With very minimal effort, you will find that "Hollywood" is a multi-tiered industry run by tens of thousands of people from all over the world. In the past, Jews were shut out of most professions, so they came to dominate vaudeville, which back then was considered too low-brow for good Christians. Those Jews eventually moved West and started the first movie studios when movies were also considered work for the underclass, and their descendents are now a decent percentage of the thousands of people of all races that make Hollywood run.
CONFERENCE MAN 1
This young man has said in plain words what so many of us in Hollywood have been trying to get people to understand.
OLDER MAN 1
To hear it all so plain, and so passionate, this kid thinks about things the way we all need to.
CONFERENCE MAN 2
You know what I think? I think this kid should run Hollywood!
CONFERENCE MAN 3
Yeah! [People stand up from their seats and start clapping and cheering.]
KYLE
Woah, woah-- wait, what? Woah.
CONFERENCE MAN 1
Let him run Hollywood!
CONFERENCE MAN 2
Yeah, give the kid a chance! C’mon!
CONFERENCE MAN 4
Let him do it!
KYLE
God dammit!
CROWD
[Chanting.] Let the Jew run it! Let the Jew run it! Let the Jew run it! Let the Jew run it!
End of Cupid Ye

synopsis:The Prince of Canada and his wife try to find privacy and seclusion in a small mountain town.

script:The Worldwide Privacy Tour

[A church in Canada. A rendition of Mozart's "The Requiem" plays as a funeral is taking place. Several people are standing, paying their respects to The Queen, as her casket is being carried.]
ANNOUNCER
Today is a tragic day for Canada. Thousands of Canadians have gathered to mourn the passing of their beloved mother. The Queen is dead.
[The scene cuts to a computer screen streaming the funeral service. Ike is watching it happen, crying through it all.]
ANNOUNCER
Every Canadian everywhere is feeling absolute emptiness right now. And now the casket is brought down the aisle with the Queen inside. The Queen's body being carried by the royal guard. What a horrible day for Canada and therefore the world.
[Ike continues to sob, and Kyle walks into the room.]
KYLE
Ike -- Ike, come on, dude, you can't keep doing this.
IKE
She's dead. She's dead, Kyle.
KYLE
Ike, the Queen died like four months ago. You gotta let it go.
[The scene cuts back to footage of the funeral, as the royal guards place The Queen's casket down.]
ANNOUNCER
And here comes Canada's most beloved musician, Sir Smelly John. [Sir Smelly John makes his way to the piano] Yes, Smelly John is sitting down at the piano with a tribute for the Queen, I believe.
SIR SMELLY JOHN
Goodbye, queefy Queen
Seems as though you've queefed your last queef...
[All of those in attendance begin to cry in unison, including Ike as he continues to watch the funeral.]
KYLE
Okay, it's 7:00, it's my turn to use the computer.
IKE
No!
KYLE
Ike, me and my friends are playing "Darktide" right now. Get off!
[Kyle and Ike begin to fight for the computer.]
IKE
Fuck you, Kyle! [starts crying]
[Cutting back to the funeral.]
ANNOUNCER
Oh, and now people are starting to stare angrily. Y-Yes, it looks like the Prince and his new wife have just shown up. [The Prince and Princess of Canada walk down the aisle to find a seat] The Prince and his wife have, of course, been bashing the Canadian monarchy. A lot of Canadians hate them now. [The Earl of Halifax walks up to the Prince and his wife and farts on them] Oh, and I believe the Earl of Halifax has just farted on the Prince's wife's face! The Prince seems to have taken offense to this. Oh, this is bad now.
[Back in the bedroom. Kyle and Ike continue to fight.]
KYLE
Ike, I'm playing "Darktide" with my friends!
IKE
No, get off me!
KYLE
Ike, goddamn it, get off!!
[South Park Elementary. Kyle walks up to Stan, Cartman and Kenny, looking down at the floor in disappointment.]
KYLE
Hey, guys.
STAN
Kyle, dude, where were you last night?
CARTMAN
Yeah, we were all waiting.
KYLE
Look, I know you think I haven't been showing up for things, but -- but I got screwed by my little brother. He just keeps crying about the Queen. And then there's this Prince and his wife and they're bashing the Canadian monarchy. [The rest of the boys exchange glances at each other as Kyle continues talking] I guess it's like people don't even know why they showed up to the funeral. But anyway, I'm really sorry I ruined game time for everyone.
CARTMAN
You didn't ruin it for anyone. We played without you.
KYLE
What? Y-You guys, we -- we said we'd all level up together.
STAN
Well, yeah, we're all like level 12 now.
CARTMAN
We got some sweet drip, dude.
KENNY
(Sweet drip, dude!)
KYLE
But this isn't fair, it wasn't my fault.
TOLKIEN
Hey guys. Did you get to upgrade your gun, Stan?
STAN
Yeah, it's got a lot better range now. What about you? [The school bell rings]
TOLKIEN
I kept the same gun, but I got some sweet drip. [The boys begin to leave]
CARTMAN
Nice, sweet drip, dude!
KENNY
(Haha, yeah, sweet drip, dude.)
[Kyle is left behind, until Butters walks up to him, placing a hand on Kyle's shoulder.]
BUTTERS
It stinks, doesn't it?
KYLE
What stinks?
BUTTERS
When people make certain judgements about you. I've been watching you, Kyle, and I can see your having some problems with your brand.
KYLE
[confused] My brand?
[The school's playground. Butters and Kyle are sitting by the stairs as they are having a conversation.]
BUTTERS
You see, everyone has an image, Kyle. Some kids call it your credibility, or your reputation, but those things are just little parts of something much more important -- your brand. Think about it, Kyle. Who are you?
KYLE
I'm just -- I-I'm just me.
BUTTERS
See? You don't know what your brand is. So how is anyone else supposed to know? It's like a commercial for Kyle, but you're not putting a label on the jar.
KYLE
Butters, this seems very out of character for you.
BUTTERS
That's because I've been workin' on my brand. My parents saw that my brand wasn't working with people, so they sent me to brand management.
KYLE
Brand management?
[CumHammer Brand Management. Butters and Kyle walk inside the building, taking a look around at what it is about exactly. Butters walks up to Mr. Davis, waving at him.]
BUTTERS
Hi, Mr. Davis!
MR. DAVIS
Well, Butters Stotch. How you doing there, Butters? How's the brand going?
BUTTERS
Great! I made two friends, and a girl asked me to help her with her homework.
MR. DAVIS
Well, there ya go there, Butters.
BUTTERS
My friend Kyle here was thinking of reworking his brand a bit, and I told him maybe you could help.
MR. DAVIS
Oh, well, sure there, Kyle, let's just get you to fill out a CumHammer survey, and then we'll go in the back and come up with some options for ya.
[Good Morning Canada studio. The crowd applauds as the show begins.]
ANNOUNCER
Live, from the television studios in Toronto, it's "Good Morning, Canada!" [fart noise]
HOST
It has been several months since our beloved Queen has died. All Canadians are finding it hard to go on. All Canadians, that is, except for our first guests, The Prince and his wife.
[The Prince and Princess of Canada walk up to the stage, the both of them holding up signs that say "Stop looking at us!" and "We want our privacy!!" The audience boos.]
PRINCE AND PRINCESS
We want privacy! We want privacy!
PRINCE
Thanks for having us in the show. [They both sit down]
PRINCESS
It's so awesome to be here. It's great.
HOST
So let me start with you, sir. You lived a life with the royal family, you had everything handed to you, but you say your life has been hard, and you've written all aboot it in your new book, "Waaagh."
PRINCE
Yes that's right, fwiend. You see, my wife and I are --
PRINCESS
I was totally like, "You should write a book 'cause your family's, like, stupid, and then so are, like, journalists."
HOST
So you hate journalists?
PRINCE
That's right!
HOST
And now you wrote a book that reports on the lives of the royal family.
PRINCE
Right.
HOST
So you're a journalist.
PRINCESS
We just want to be normal people. All this attention is so hard.
HOST
Isn't it true, sir, that your questionable wife has her own TV show and hangs out with celebrities and does fashion magazines?
PRINCE
What are you suggesting?
HOST
Well, I just think some people might say that your Instagram-loving bitch wife actually doesn't want her privacy?
PRINCE
How dare you, sir! My Instagram-loving bitch wife has always wanted her privacy! And you know what else? To hell with Canada! We are leaving! We'll go find some quiet place where we can be normal people! Come on, wife.
[The Prince and Princess leave the studio, as they pick up their signs and begin to protest.]
PRINCE AND PRINCESS
We want privacy! We want privacy!
[An upbeat song begins to play, as a montage shows the Prince and Princess of Canada travelling across the globe to find their quiet place.]
[Come, on, come on,
Come on, come on, come on,
It's the Worldwide Privacy Tour
Come on, come on,
Come on, come on, come on,]
[The Prince and Princess roam around France, still holding their sings and protesting.]
PRINCE AND PRINCESS
We want privacy!
[It's the Worldwide Privacy Tour
Come on, come on, come on
'Cause we want some privacy]
[They are now in India, as they run around, still protesting.]
PRINCE AND PRINCESS
We want privacy! We want privacy!
[It's the Worldwide Privacy Tour
Come on, come on, come on
Because we need some privacy
It's the Worldwide Privacy Tour]
[Now, at Sydney, Australia. The Prince and Princess continue to protest for their privacy, but this time to the kangoroos.]
PRINCE AND PRINCESS
We want privacy! We want privacy!
[The montage continues on, and now the Prince and Princess are in New York at a basketball stadium, as they keep protesting non-stop.]
[The Worldwide Privacy Tour is coming soon to your town
We're coming soon to your town, give us privacy
Come on, come on, come on
It's the Worldwide Privacy Tour]
[The Prince and Princess look at a map of the US, and the Prince points to the state of Colorado, presumably as their next location to protest. They arrive at Aspen and continue with their song and dance.]
[Come on, come on, come on,
Come on, Come on
It's the Worldwide Privacy Tour
Come on, come on, come on
'Cause we want some privacy]
[The montage draws to a close, as the Prince and Princess make their way to South Park, still protesting and holding their signs.]
[CumHammer Brand Management. Butters and Kyle are sitting down with Mr. Davis at his desk as he types on his computer.]
MR. DAVIS
Alright there, Kyle, we got your survey answers, and I think we've put together some great ideas for your brand. I want understand you want people to like you more and think you're cool. Is that right?
KYLE
Yeah.
MR. DAVIS
Alright, well, let's see how this brand works for you. We got... Kyle -- Rugged. Vegan. Compassionate. Victim.
KYLE
I-I don't think that's really me.
MR. DAVIS
Well, that's fine 'cause there's a lot of different brands people are attracted to. How about this one? [mouse click] Kyle -- Senstitive. Outdoorsy. Frugal. Victim.
KYLE
I'm not -- I'm not that outdoorsy.
MR. DAVIS
Okay, well, remember there, Kyle, it's not so much about who you are as much as it is about what people are attracted to, okay? So, let's see, how about this? [mouse click] Kyle -- Wealthy. Handsome. Multi-talented Grammy Award-Winning. Victim. Oh, that -- that one's taken already. Sorry. Hold on. [more mouse clicks] Just a minute, Kyle. We're gonna find a good one here for you.
BUTTERS
You'll see, Kyle. When you have your brand up and runnin', no one can stop you.
[The Prince and Princess of Canada walk over the hill, looking over the town of South Park in the distance.]
PRINCESS
Look at this town. There's just something about it. Oh, darling. I think this might be the place.
PRINCE
You really think so?
PRINCESS
It's so quiet and empty here. If we moved here, then people would think we're really serious about wanting to be normal.
PRINCE
It does seem perfect, doesn't it? We can have a fresh start here. Lead a normal life and have babies.
PRINCESS
Can we? Can we really move here and finally have our privacy?
PRINCE
My love, I will do anything for your privacy.
[The next day. The Prince and Princess of Canada show up to the neighborhood in an airplane, and they get off with all their belongings in boxes. They seem to have bought the old Cartman residency. Movers begin making their way inside with all the Prince's and Princess's furniture.]
PRINCE
The couch goes in the first room! Ay, be careful with that TV, buddy! Drum set goes on the second floor. [Kyle opens his front door to see what is happening] Wait, put it down. I want to make sure it isn't damaged.
KYLE
What the hell?
PRINCE
[He plays his drumset, very loudly, until he sees Kyle] Hey! Hey, you! Hey, what are you looking at?! You ever heard of privacy?!
KYLE
What?
[South Park Elementary. Cartman, Stan, Kenny, Tolkien and Jimmy are hanging out by the lockers, and kyle walks in.]
KYLE
You guys, I am so sorry. I totally was going to play with you guys online but the Prince of Canada and his wife moved in across the street from me. They have this huge jet parked in front of my house and then they kept trying to get me to buy their stupid book and -- and, anyway, I'm sorry I messed up another game night.
STAN
It's okay, dude, we had a great time.
CARTMAN
Yeah, we are literally dripping with drip.
KYLE
Well, I just want you guys to know that I am a reliable, fun-loving, punctual victim.
STAN
...'Kay, well, we gotta get to class.[They all start leaving]
KYLE
I'm really working on myself! You're gonna like what you see! [His smile drops]
[A slideshow plays, as Mr. Davis begins to talk.]
MR. DAVIS
As a child, you see the world in a different way. You see the wonder in nature, and you're starting to learn more about yourself, all the time. And you're learning that there's something more important than you ever thought -- your brand. It's what defines you. And with brand management, you can make sure others see you the way they want to see you.
[The scene transitions to Mr. Davis at the CumHammer Brand Management office.]
MR. DAVIS
Welcome to your CumHammer Work tutorial. You are taking the first steps to making your brand a great one.
[The scene then cuts to Kyle's bedroom, watching the CumHammer Work tutorial and taking notes.]
MR. DAVIS
[through the tablet] By now you've received your workbook and also your brand slide tool and CumHammer social-media drive which will be used in this video. Now, if you're ready, let's start the exercises on page five of your workbook.
[Suddenly, fireworks begin going off outside of Kyle's house. Kyle goes to his window and sees the Prince and Princess of Canada igniting fireworks, while laughing hysterically.]
PRINCE
Respect our privacy!
PRINCESS
Leave us alone! Leave us alone!
PRINCE AND PRINCESS
Down with the monarchy! We just want our privacy!
[Kyle sees all of this go down, and gets furious.]
KYLE
God, fuck these people!
PRINCESS
Why are we so mad today?
PRINCE
Because we want our privacy!
[Park County Police Department. A police officer answers an incoming call.]
OFFICER
Park County Police Station. What's your emergency?
KYLE
Yeah, the neighbors across the steet are setting off fireworks and it's 10:30 at night!
OFFICER
Oh, is it the Prince of Canada and his wife, who just want to be left alone?
KYLE
Yes. They're being super loud, and I'm trying to work on my brand! [he checks his window] Oh, god damn it. Now, the Prince is playing polo on the lawn![The Prince is shown playing polo, continuing to be very loud along with his wife.]
PRINCESS
We are here because privacy is a basic human right. How many more princes and his wives have to live in this nightmare?
[The Prince hits the ball and smashes Kyle's bedroom window.]
KYLE
Hey, can you two fucking keep it down?!
PRINCE
Oy! You ever heard of a thing called "privacy"?!
KYLE
Yeah, nobody gives a shit! Will you two just shut up, and go away?! [Another ball hits Kyle's window, smashing it.]
[South Park Elementary. The cafeteria. The boys are eating their lunch, as Kyle begins to rant about last night.]
KYLE
It seriously is driving me crazy! The prince plays drums all day. I don't think he even has a job. And I don't know what the hell she does. Why they even left Canada is beyond me. And, like, she seems to just boss him around, and make him do whatever she wants. I mean, why did they even leave Canada and move to South Park, anyway?
CARTMAN
Stan, are you gonna say something?
STAN
You say it.
KYLE
Say what?
STAN
Look, Kyle... We just kinda don't care about some dumb prince and his stupid wife.
KYLE
I don't care about them either!
JIMMY
So, then why do you talk about them all the time?
KYLE
[He stutters and isn't able to come up with anything]
STAN
Dude, we're just kind of sick of hearing about them.
KYLE
I'm sick of hearing about them! But I can't get away from them! They're everywhere! In my fucking face!
TOLKIEN
Yeah, and now you're putting 'em in our fucking face.
KYLE
Fine, I won't talk about them anymore.
CARTMAN
Thank you.
[Silence fills the cafeteria table. The boys resume eating their lunch, until Kyle speaks up again.]
KYLE
Ok, just one last thing -- did you know the Prince sleeps-
[The rest of the group gets frustrated and they all leave the table, leaving Kyle alone.]
KYLE
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
[CumHammer Brand Management.]
MR. DAVIS
The problem with you is you want results without the work. You can't just say you're a certain thing, and then expect people to just like your brand. You gotta work it, sell people on it.
KYLE
But I just don't feel like my brand is who I really am on the inside.
MR. DAVIS
You know, Kyle, some people think it's what's inside you that matters. But people can't see inside you. They can only see what kind of drink you're drinking. That's what matters.
KYLE
I guess so.
MR. DAVIS
Now, I'm gonna help you with a new brand, but you've got to work on it. What do you want your friends to think about you?
KYLE
I want them to think I'm not gonna complain about things. I'm more thick-skinned.
MR. DAVIS
[typing on his computer] Okay. This is good. This is good...
KYLE
And I want people to think I'm stronger, mentally, than I probably already am.
MR. DAVIS
Okay. Okay. I think I got it. People are gonna love this. Kyle -- he's a thick-skinned, super cool, nothing bothers him victim.
KYLE
I just don't know if I can--
MR. DAVIS
[stops Kyle] You're goin' off brand already! Remember, no matter what, nothing bothers you.
[After school. The school bus drops off Kyle and Kenny, and Kyle makes his way back home. When he arrives, he sees magazine covers of the Princess of Canada plastered all over his door. The Prince and the Princess peek over their window. Kyle almost gets upset, but stops himself from doing so.]
KYLE
I don't care. Don't care. [he goes inside]
PRINCE
What the hell?
PRINCESS
What'd he just say? He victimized me! It's because I'm an ethnic woman!
PRINCE
He can't do that! I'll see -- Wait, you're ethnic? This is an outrage! We'll just see how he deals with my blue penis!
[The Prince walks over to Kyle's house window. As Kyle is playing a videogame, the Prince is pounding at the window, and then takes off his pants to reveal his blue private parts.]
PRINCE
Hey! Have some respect for this privacy!
[Kyle ignores the Prince's antics, as he continues rubbing his privates on the window. Seeing no results, the Prince walks away disappointedly. The Prince and his wife go back into their house, feeling defeated. The Princess begins crying. The Prince holds her close for comfort.]
PRINCE
Don't worry, my love, he's not gonna get away with this.
[South Park Elementary. A cool song begins to play as Kyle opens the front doors. He is not wearing his orange jacket, only a black t-shirt and carrying a blue folder. He walks across the hallway, overflowing with confidence. He arrives to where the rest of the boys are at, and leans an arm on the lockers.]
KYLE
Hey, guys! How you doin?!
STAN
[unamused] Good. How are you?
KYLE
I'm great! Got some good sleep last night. Just letting things roll right off my back, you know? 'Cause that's the kind of guy I am.
CARTMAN
[also unamused] Cool.
KYLE
Hey, you guys want to play "Darktide" after school? Or if not, whatever. I'm cool either way.
STAN
Yeah, I'm sure we can figure that out.
KYLE
Cool, whatever. I'm care-free and unflappable. I'll catch you guys at lunch! [he walks away, Jimmy approaches him]
JIMMY
Wow, Kyle, you seem really different.
KYLE
Do you like it?
JIMMY
Uh, sure.
KYLE
Thanks, Jimmy. But you know, I really need to thank a good friend. He introduced me to a way of becoming a more stable person. Have you seen Butters?
JIMMY
Butters? Oh, sure. He's out on the playground, getting the shit beat of out him by Bebe.
KYLE
What?!
[The school playground. Several kids are gathered around Bebe and Butters. Bebe has the upper hand, beating Butters down to a bloody pulp.]
BEBE
Mother! [punches Butters] Fucker! Don't ever say that shit again!
KYLE
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell is going on?!
BEBE
I wasn't even doing anything, and he came up, and started talking shit to me!
BUTTERS
Yeah, everyone likes a guy that's strong and assertive, so I told Bebe to go fuck herself.
BEBE
Who do you even think you are?!
BUTTERS
You want some more of this, you dumb slut?!
KYLE
Butters, what are you doing?! This isn't you.
BUTTERS
Hey, Kyle, will you relax? You're kind of fucking up my brand.
KYLE
Okay, that does it -- come on, Butters. You're going back to CumHammer.
BEBE
You're lucky he saved your ass!
BUTTERS
Fuck you, you fucking bitch!
[CumHammer Brand Management.]
MR. DAVIS
The most important thing about your brand is being flexible. We want to make sure you're completely satisfied. You say you're having some problems?
PRINCE OF CANADA
That's right! There's this horrible spy who lives across the street from us, and we're gonna get him back by changing our brand!
MR. DAVIS
All right. And I do see you're in our database, but you didn't first get help at this CumHammer location?
PRINCE
No. My wife went to one in California as a child.
MR. DAVIS
Ah, okay. Then you must be in the national system. Oh, yeah. Is this you? "Sorority girl, Actress, Influencer, Victim."
PRINCESS
Yeah. That's totally me.
MR. DAVIS
Okay, I see. And then, you added your husband to your Friends and Family account. You must be the, "Royal prince, millionaire, world traveler, victim."
PRINCE
That's right.
[Kyle walks in with Butters, holding his hand the whole way inside.]
KYLE
Come on, Butters. Hello?
MR. DAVIS
Oh, hey there! Just gimme a minute. I'm with some other clients right now, there, Kyle.
KYLE
Uh, no. This is an emergency. We need to talk to --
PRINCE
Oy! Do you mind! Stop invading -- [gasps] It's him!
PRINCESS
[screaming]
KYLE
What the hell are you doing here?!
PRINCE
You just can't leave us alone, can't you!
PRINCESS
Oh my God, he is so obsessed with us!
KYLE
I'm not obsessed with you! It's this stupid place! Don't you see, Butters? Teaching people to think of their brand just makes people more like them. This whole thing is wrong. They're telling you guys to reduce yourselves into products instead of people to be truly understood and loved. Don't you guys want people to like you for you instead of who they want you to be? Look, we all have our faults. God knows I do. But if we just try to present and control an image of us for people to see, then, we're just performers instead of human beings.
PRINCE
He's right. Trying to make ourselves into a brand just turned us into products. We don't need to be a brand, do we? If it's truly what we want, then we really can get away from it all. No more magazines and Netflix shows. We really can live a normal life. [He motions to his wife, no response.] Yes, I'm sure you agree darling. We can be the people we talked about being, with no more worries about how we look or the image with project to people. What matters is what we have on the inside.
[The Prince tries to get a response from his wife, but she says nothing. He opens her mouth, hoping for a reply.]
PRINCE
[echoing] Hello?
KYLE
Come on, Butters. Time to go home.
BUTTERS
Yeah.
A GIRL
Yeah.
A BOY
Yeah...
[Everyone in the building begins to leave.]
MR. DAVIS
Now, hey. Don't make a decision you might all regret.
PRINCE
Yeah, come on, honey. We don't need this place. [he starts leaving, and looks back to see his wife not moving at all] Honey?
[The Princess does not move an inch or acknowledge him, which makes the Prince sad as he leaves the building.]
[A chruch in Canada. Once again, the funeral of the Queen is taking place. Ike watches it the funeral all over again, crying as it goes on.]
REPORTER
The Queen is dead. What a sad day for Canada -- and therefore, the world.
IKE
[sobbing]
KYLE
Ike, I need to use the -- Oh no, not again...
IKE
She's still dead.
KYLE
Ike, I have to get on the computer. The Queen's been dead a long time. [Ike continues to cry] Ike! I have to get on with my friends! If I don't, they're gonna think I'm...
[Kyle stops all of a sudden, reflecting on himself. Instead of fighting back, he places an arm on Ike's shoulder as a form of comfort.]
KYLE
It's okay. Things get to you. It's who you are.
[Kyle leaves the room and heads downstairs to the living room. He hears a knock at the front door and he goes to open it.]
KYLE
Oh. Hey, guys.
STAN
Hey, dude. Uh... We thought maybe you could do with a little outside time.
KYLE
Really?
TOLKIEN
We just thought it'd be good to get you out of the house. You seem to be going through a lot lately.
KYLE
Yeah. Yeah, I have. [he smiles a bit] Thanks, guys. I'd love to play.
[All the boys go down to the basketball court to play some basketball. The Prince of Canada walks in and approaches them.]
PRINCE
Oy! Oy! Could, uh... Could I play?
STAN
Sure, you can play.
PRINCE
Great!
[He rushes to get his drums, and begins to play as the boys continue their basketball game.]
End of The Worldwide Privacy Tour


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:South Park learns about the wonders of Japanese toilets.

script:Japanese Toilet

[Tegridy Farms. Randy, Shelly and Stan are all sitting on the couch. Randy is playing a video game while Stan watches him, and Shelly is on her phone.]
RANDY
See, Stan? You gotta choose if you wanna be in Gryffindor or Slytherin.
STAN
Yeah, can I do it?
RANDY
Yeah, see, you gotta fight these fairy guys. [Sharon walks into the living room]
SHARON
Randy. [Randy doesn't respond] Randy! The powder room toilet is broken. Again!
RANDY
Did you jiggle the handle?
SHARON
Yes, I jiggled the handle. Will you come fix this, please?
RANDY
Okay, okay...
[The powder room. Randy walks over to the toilet to inspect it. He jiggles the handle to see if anything happens.]
RANDY
Huh, well, let's see. It's gotta be the little black floaty thingie. What'd you do to it?
SHARON
I didn't do anything.
RANDY
Lemme see if there's water in the bowl.
SHARON
No! Don't lift the lid!
RANDY
Why can't I lift the lid?
SHARON
Don't, Randy!
RANDY
Uh-huh... Hey, guys! Your mom took a shit and doesn't want me to see it.
STAN
[from the living room] Ew!
SHELLY
[from the living room] Gross, Dad!
SHARON
Randy! We need to get a new toilet.
RANDY
We can't just get rid of 'ol blue, Sharon.
SHARON
This is embarrassing. It's the powder room toilet, the one guests use. You get a new toilet, Randy, or I'm not helping you sell weed anymore! [she leaves]
RANDY
Alright, alright. Sharon, you win. As usual. Poor 'ol blue...
[The Home Depot. Randy is taking a look at toilets on display. An employee approaches him.]
HOME DEPOT EMPLOYEE
Can I help you with anything?
RANDY
Oh, yeah, just lookin' for a new toilet to replace Ol' Blue.
HOME DEPOT EMPLOYEE
Alright, well, all our toilets here are standard bowl, come with full warranty. How much you looking to spend?
RANDY
Well, I'm not poor. I happen to have my own weed business. So that's pretty much the nicest one you have, right? [he points to a toilet]
HOME DEPOT EMPLOYEE
Yeah, that's probably the top model, you know, before you start getting into Japanese toilets.
RANDY
Japanese toilets?
HOME DEPOT EMPLOYEE
Yeah, they're the sort of the super-high-class luxury models with all the bells and whistles. But you probably don't wanna spend that kind of money.
RANDY
I'm not poor.
HOME DEPOT EMPLOYEE
Oh, well, we can show them to you. The Japanese toilets are right over there.
[Traditional Japanese music starts playing, as the employee directs Randy to a Japanese toilets display.]
HOME DEPOT EMPLOYEE
Hi, Rick. This gentleman would like to see the Japanese toilets.
RICK
Well, of course, sir. My name is Rick. Let me know if there's anything you need.
[Inside the Japanese toilets display.]
HOME DEPOT EMPLOYEE
These toilets are all equipped with the highest-end features, including an automatic bidet system, bluetooth capability, and seat warmers.
RANDY
Seat warmers?
HOME DEPOT EMPLOYEE
Of course. And the toilet sense when you've come into the room, turns on a small light, plays welcome music, and raises the lid for you.
WAITRESS
Can I offer you some sparkling water or champagne?
RANDY
Oh, sure, I'll take some champagne.
HOME DEPOT EMPLOYEE
All the toilet's functions are operated by a touch-button remote which you mount where the toilet-paper roll used to go.
RANDY
So then where do you keep the toilet paper?
HOME DEPOT EMPLOYEE
With a Japanese toilet, you don't need toilet paper. The toilet washes you completely clean.
RANDY
You're mad.
HOME DEPOT EMPLOYEE
No, it's true. It has warm water and a dryer and cleans you eight times better than toilet paper can. [he hands keys to Randy] Would you like to take one for a test drive?
RANDY
Oh, uh, sure. I did have kind of a big breakfast.
HOME DEPOT EMPLOYEE
Right over here.
[They both walk over to a sample Japanese toilet. Randy opens the door and walks in, with the door closing behind him. The toilet automatically lifts its lid and lights up, with welcoming music playing. Randy takes off his pants and sits on the toilet.]
RANDY
Oh!
[Randy starts playing around with the settings of the Japanese toilet. Water begins to run.]
RANDY
Whoa! Ooh. Oh, oh! Oh. Ahh! Oh, oh... [he farts]
[Randy continues to play around with the toilet's settings.]
RANDY
Ohh! Oh... [he flushes and makes his way out of the toilet room.] Okay, how much?
[Tegridy Farms.]
RANDY
Guys, I wanted to talk to you because I want you all to think about how we're viewed as a family. You know, as a prominent weed dealer, we are successful, and we're sort of looked up to in this town because we have nice things that most families can't afford. I mean, Stan, you're playing "Hogwarts Legacy" on PS5, right?
STAN
You're playing "Hogwarts Legacy" on a PS5.
RANDY
Yeah, my -- my point is that most people in town don't even have a PS5. They still have PS4s, and so we're basically the Kennedys of South Park. And the plain fact is that well-off families have nice things, and we shouldn't be ashamed of that. [the doorbell rings] Oh! New toilet's here!
[Outside of the Marshes' front porch. Randy opens the door with excitement.]
JAPANESE DELIVERY MAN
Hajimemashite. Japanese Torei des!
RANDY
Uh, yes, thank you. Bring it on in.
[Several delivery men start making their way inside of the house, carrying the toilet.]
DELIVERY MEN
Kyo fun yori! Kro fun yori!
SHARON
That's the new toilet? How much did it cost?
RANDY
Oh, Sharon. Tennish.
SHARON
What's "tennish?"
RANDY
Tennish. Thousandish. Ten Thousandish.
SHARON
You spent $10,000 on a toilet?! We don't have that kind of money, Randy!
RANDY
Yeah, we do. [a Japanese delivery man makes his way out and bows]
JAPANESE DELIVERY MAN
Shitsurei Shimasu! Owarimashita.
RANDY
Okay, yeah, right here? [he signs a document] Okay.
JAPANESE DELIVERY MAN
Doomo! Aringanto gozaimashita!
DELIVERY MEN
Aringanto gozaimashita!
RANDY
'Kay, thanks.
[The powder room. Randy takes his family to see the newly-installed Japanese toilet.]
SHARON
You are taking that back to the store.
RANDY
Try it, Sharon.
SHARON
I don't need to, Randy. I want --
RANDY
Try it, Sharon!
[Randy pushes Sharon and closes the powder room door, leaving her all alone inside. Music starts playing. Sharon starts pressing buttons on the toilet.]
SHARON
Oh. Oh... [she presses a button] Oh! Ohhh!
RANDY
Ah-ha-ha!
STAN
I wanna try it.
RANDY
Shhh!
SHARON
[she presses another button] Ah-ho-ho!
RANDY
Ohhh!
[South Park Elementary. The school bell rings. Stan walks in the hallways.]
CLYDE
Oh, look, there he goes. It's Mr. Big Shot.
[Stan hears Clyde's comment and turns around, confused by it.]
A GIRL
Hey, Richie Rich. You eating caviar for lunch today, Richie Rich?
[Stan stops walking, being confronted by Cartman, Scott and Douglas.]
CARTMAN
Stan, just so you know, nobody gives a shit.
STAN
About what?
CARTMAN
Come on, guys! [he walks away with the other boys]
BETSY
Did you know some people can't even afford to eat? How about caring for something that matters, you bitch?
STAN
What the fuck?
JIMMY
Hey, Stan, you really have to be careful.
STAN
Of what?
JIMMY
Look, it's great that you come from a wealthy family, but people don't like getting their noses rubbed in it.
STAN
Dude, I haven't even said anything!
JIMMY
Well, your dad called everyone last night and told you have a $10,000 toilet.
STAN
What?!
[Tegridy Farms. The house's dining area. Many of the adults have gathered to have brunch with the Marshes.]
STEPHEN
Well, thanks for having us over for brunch, Randy.
LINDA
Yeah, what's the special occassion?
RANDY
Oh, you know, just good times with dear friends. Does anyone need to go to the bathroom?
STEPHEN
Uh, no, I'm -- I'm good.
RANDY
Oh, maybe some more coffee, then. [he pours coffee on Stephen's cup.]
MRS. TWEAK
Can you guys believe all the snow we've gotten?
PETER
Yeah, maybe it will actually help with the drought.
RANDY
Let's hope so. Does anyone need a bathroom break?
STEPHEN
Well, actually, I-I think I could use the restroom. That was kind of a big breakfast.
RANDY
Oh! Oh, yeah, sure! It's, uh -- It's right across the hallway. Right there.
STEPHEN
Excuse me. [he makes his way to the powder room]
[Randy happily sips his drink, while pleasant music plays in the powder room.]
STEPHEN
Oh.
RICHARD
What was that?
RANDY
Oh, that's the welcome music for my Japanese toilet.
SHEILA
I've heard of those. Aren't they expensive?
RANDY
Yeah, a bit. But for those of us who can afford it, it's well worth it.
RICHARD
[presses a button] Oh! Ohhh! Ohhhhh!
RANDY
He's now turned on the rear jet, which cleans your bottom with warm water.
RICHARD
Oh, ohhhh!
RANDY
Ah! That's the front washer that washes your balls, or vagina.
RICHARD
[farts]
RANDY
If you think about it, a dry piece of toilet paper can't clean your half as well as pressurized water. I feel that most people have to walk around with fecal matter on their anus, but I'm just lucky I've sold enough weed to be able not to. But was it really luck? Or was it hard work? Heck, I don't know, but you know -- [Stan barges in]
STAN
Dad, can I talk to you?!
RANDY
Stan? You're back from school already?
STAN
I need to talk to you right now!
[Randy's office. Stan closes the door angrily.]
STAN
The fuck are you doing?!
RANDY
The fuck are you doing?
STAN
You need to stop gloating to everybody!
RANDY
I am not gloating.
STAN
Yes, you are, and now kids at school are calling me Richie Rich!
RANDY
They are?
STAN
Nobody cares about your stupid toilet and you're acting like a jerk.
RANDY
You're stupid. I'm acting like a jerk because I'm trying to help people?!
STAN
How are you trying to help people, Dad?
RANDY
Because the people don't know that these toilets are awesome, and I'm just, like, the well-respected guy who's trying to open people's eyes like JFK.
STAN
You are not like JFK! You're just showing off!
RANDY
Nu-uh, I'm like JFK 'cause I am trying to change things! You're part of a very respected family, Stan. You should start acting like it. [he walks out of the room] Okay, who's next?
[Tegridy Farms. Pleasant music plays, as Randy is in the bathroom, singing along to the music.]
[Atashi wa Heia des-u...]
[Sharon walks up to the door.]
RANDY
Toire ni iru kara...
SHARON
[knocking on the door] Randy?
RANDY
Kimochi...
SHARON
Randy!
RANDY
What?!
SHARON
Your proctologist is here to see you.
RANDY
My protcologist?
[The living room. A protctologist is waiting for Randy. Randy walks up to him.]
RANDY
Oh, hey there, Doc.
DR. SHELTAIR
Well, Randy Marsh, how are ya?
RANDY
I'm doing great. How are you?
DR. SHELTAIR
Wonderful! Just been super busy. I'm actually takin' the wife to Tuscany day after tomorrow.
RANDY
Tuscany? Wow. Awesome.
DR. SHELTAIR
Yeah, well, Randy you haven't been in my office for a few days, so I thought I'd come do a house call to help you with your hemorrhoids.
RANDY
Oh! No, Doctor. I haven't needed to come to your office. In fact, I don't think I'll be needing your services anymore since I've gotten a Japanese toilet.
DR. SHELTAIR
Oh -- Oh, really?
RANDY
It's completely changed my life. I'm healthier, I'm less stressed, and I don't get hemorrhoids 'cause I'm not smearing shit all over my ass with toilet paper.
DR. SHELTAIR
Huh...
RANDY
Here, here. You wanna come see it?!
[Randy guides Dr. Sheltair to the powder room.]
RANDY
Go on, check it out. [opens the door]
[Dr. Sheltair walks into the powder room and Randy closes the door. He leans in to listen. The doctor can be heard shouting and banging on the toilet.]
RANDY
D-Dr. Sheltair?
[The banging and shouting continues. Randy gets worried.]
RANDY
Dr. Sheltair?!
[Randy enters the powder room. Dr. Sheltair is seen banging and shouting at the toilet.]
DR. SHELTAIR
You stupid!
RANDY
Whoa hey hey hey!
DR. SHELTAIR
You ruined Tuscany! Gah! [he kicks the toilet around]
RANDY
Stop it! [he grabs Dr. Sheltair, trying to stop him]
DR. SHELTAIR
I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!!!
[Outside of the Marshes' house. Randy kicks Dr. Sheltair out, sending him flying.]
RANDY
Go on! Get out of here!
DR. SHELTAIR
How am I supposed to tell my wife we can't afford to go to Tuscany now?!
RANDY
I never realized you made so much money off my ass. Go on! Get! Get!! [Dr. Sheltair runs off]
[South Park Elementary. The dismissal bell rings and all the kids begin heading out. Stan makes his way out until Butters calls him.]
BUTTERS
Hey, Stan! Stan hold up!
STAN
What?
BUTTERS
Well, um, you're just a really good friend, Stan, and -- and I was gonna ask if maybe I could borrow your plungercost?
STAN
What's a plungercost?
BUTTERS
It doesn't cost nothing when your toilet's nice as yours, Richie Rich! [he laughs, with the other kids joining in as well] I did it! I called Stan Richie Rich, too! That was fun! [he walks away]
JIMMY
Stan, you've got to stop bragging about your toilet.
STAN
I'm not bragging about my toilet! And why is it such a big deal anyway?
JIMMY
It's a big deal, Stan. You just don't understand why.
[Jimmy and Stan walk around the town's park.]
JIMMY
Have you ever asked yourself why we use toilet paper? We're told to wash our hands... wear masks in crowds... but for some reason when it comes to wiping our ass, we're told to do it with this little piece of paper. We are all -- all of us -- walking around right now with a little bit of shit smeared on our buttholes. [he stops walking] Did you know that 70% of people in the world don't even use it at all?
STAN
70% of the world doesn't use toilet paper?
JIMMY
Look it up. Most people in the world still use good 'ol soap and water.
[Footage of toilet paper manufacturing plays in the background as Jimmy explains.]
JIMMY
The average American uses 140 rolls of toilet paper per year. Can you even begin to imagine how many trees that is? To supply the United States its toilet paper, it takes 31.1 million trees per year. A million acres per year of precious Canadian Boreal forest alone, releasing upwards of 25 metric tons of CO2 and leveling 90% of the land barren.
[The montage ends.]
STAN
So, then, why do Americans use it so much?
JIMMY
Well, that's the big question, isn't it? None of it makes any sense.
STAN
Well, then, maybe somebody --
JIMMY
Just tell your dad to stop. Americans don't want to change their toilets and they never will.
[Outside of the Town Hall. Mayor McDaniels is at a podium.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a public service announcement. One of our citizens has asked to speak with you. Please welcome Randy S. Marsh.
[Randy and Sharon walk up to the stage. Randy shakes the mayor's hand and walks up to the podium, ready to give his speech.]
RANDY
Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, everyone. You know, the Marshes are a family that try to always lead by example. And we know that all of you appreciate that. Everyone deserves to be clean, and the truth is, you can be. You might not be the Marshes, but you can afford a Japanese toilet. Just not a really nice one like what we have. If you take into account the money we all spend on toilet paper, doctors, and hemorrhoid cream, a Japanese toilet pays for itself in just a few years. There are actually Japanese toilets made for commoners. Walmart and Amazon all carry the lower cost of shitty Japanese toilets that anyone can afford. There's even these like attachment thingies for your existing toilet which will make you feel like a Marsh yourself. They may not be "Nihon No style-ru", but they are good enough for you guys. The point is -- even commoners don't need toilet paper anymore! And, so, I am suggesting that this town puts all --
[All of a sudden, a distant gunshot hits Randy on the arm, knocking him out unconscious. Everyone around the podium is left in shock.]
MAN
Holy shit!
SHARON
Randy?! [she screams]
[The audience runs away screaming.]
[Hell's Pass Hospital. The Marshes sit on the Emergency Room waiting for an update on Randy. A doctor approaches them.]
DOCTOR
I'm sorry, but he's in critical condition.
SHARON
Who shot him?
DOCTOR
Nobody knows.
STAN
Is he gonna be okay?
DOCTOR
He's in a coma. He's unconscious and just blabbering nonsense.
[Randy is seen on a hospital bed, in a coma and blabbering to himself.]
RANDY
[weakly] Bikkuri... Bikkurishita... Taihen deshou...
DOCTOR
Mr. Marsh, your whole family is here. Your wife, your daughter, and your son.
RANDY
T-Toire Wa...?
DOCTOR
No, your toilet is back at the farm.
RANDY
Taihen ja naaaa...
STAN
Dad, I'm sorry I yelled at you before. I didn't know you were really trying to help.
RANDY
Kon-nichi waaa...
SHARON
Stan, where are you going?
STAN
I let Dad down once. Somebody has to pick up where he left off. [he walks out]
[Park County Police Station.]
HARRIS
I promise we're doing all we can. I'm sorry for what happened, but you need to leave it to the professionals.
STAN
There's something more going on here. I think my dad was on to something and I didn't listen to him, and now he's in a hospital.
HARRIS
We've already got a few leads and we're following up on all of them. I assure you we take this all very seriously. This isn't a joke to us.
OFFICER
Chief, hey, Chief!
HARRIS
Yeah?
OFFICER
An angry proctologist walked in to the toilet section of Home Depot.
HARRIS
[he chuckles] Y-Yeah?
OFFICER
Proctologist says to the toilet manager, "I ain't taking the fall," and pulls a gun on six Japanese delivery men.
HARRIS
[chuckling some more] Okay.
OFFICER
So, then, the six Japanese delivery men show up, and the proctologist has everyone held hostage and says he's not taking the fall for the Randy Marsh shooting.
HARRIS
Oh, shit, this is actually happening?! Come on people, let's go!
[The Home Depot. Police has the outside surrounded. Inside, Dr. Sheltair has everyone held hostage. Everyone has their hands up as the doctor wields a gun.]
DR. SHELTAIR
I ain't going down for this! You got that, coppers?! I didn't shoot anybody! But if I'm going down, I'll take these careless bastards out with me!
WAITRESS
Would you like some sparkling water or cham--
DR. SHELTAIR
Get -- Get outta here! [he pushes the waitress]
HARRIS
[with a megaphone] Come on out. There's no other way, we have you surrounded.
DR. SHELTAIR
I didn't shoot Randy Marsh!
JAPANESE DELIVERY MAN
Taihen!
HARRIS
Nobody's saying you did!
DR. SHELTAIR
No, but they're gonna use me as their scapegoat! They'll fix things like they always do!
STAN
Who will?
DR. SHELTAIR
They'll use their lawyers and their power to make it all go away! Just like they did back when that second grade kid wrote a story in the school paper about toilets two years ago. They'll take me out too! There's no stopping them.
HARRIS
Don't do it!
[Dr. Sheltair shoots himself in the rear, falling to the floor and dying instantly.]
JAPANESE DELIVERY MAN
Sabishiiiii!!
HARRIS
Aww! Alright, move in! Secure the area.
STAN
Second grade kid two years ago... Wrote about toilets in the school news paper.
[The park. Jimmy is walking around until Stan approaches him.]
STAN
You weren't warning me about people getting upset. You know more about this.
[Jimmy stops walking. A brief second passes, until he starts to leave in a hurry.]
STAN
Hey! [he catches up to Jimmy] You wrote a story in the school paper and someone came after you.
JIMMY
Yeah I wrote a story, big deal!
STAN
Jimmy, I want to know who shot my dad!
JIMMY
They took everything from me, Stan! My bike... my cat... They were gonna sue my parents for what I wrote in the school paper.
STAN
You're talking about the toilet paper companies.
JIMMY
Who has the most to lose? It's all toilet paper, Stan! Follow the money!
[Another montage of toilet paper manufacturing plays as Jimmy rambles on. Video footage of Randy's speech also plays.]
JIMMY
140 rolls per American per year. Factories pushing out roll after roll while razing Earth's resources. All of this for an unsanitary product that has been proven to contribute to anal fissures.
[Jimmy and Stan sit down on a park bench. The montage continues playing in the background.]
JIMMY
Don't you get it, man? Paper doesn't clean bacteria. It can't kill viruses. With all that information, you'd think the world health organization would do studies to find alternatives. So why don't they? Because toilet paper is an industry worth billions and b-billions of dollars. Kimberly-Clark, Georgia-Pacific, Procter & Gamble. They don't want Japanese toilets in America and they have the power to stop them, and to stop you.
STAN
I can't believe they shot my dad... because he wanted to change things.
JIMMY
These people have deeper pockets than you can possibly imagine. They can destroy everything you love, Stan. Take my advice... Don't. Squeeze. The Charmin.
STAN
You might be too scared Jimmy, but I'm a Marsh. [he leaves]
[Outside of City Hall. All of South Park has gathered to hear Stan's speech.]
STAN
My fellow Americans, we have been coerced and brain washed. While the rest of the world walks around with cleaner buttholes, we are obsessed with dry paper sold to us by billion-dollar corporations.
MAN 1
Yeah.
MAN 2
Hey, yeah, he's right!
STAN
My father wanted everyone to see that there were alternatives. But they don't want him talking about alternatives.
CROWD
Yeah!!
STAN
And we can't be blindly buying their products anymore. And as a town, we will find alternatives, and we will not be afraid to -- [Randy walks up to the podium, interrupting Stan mid-sentence]
RANDY
Stop! Stop! We're not doing this!
STAN
Dad!
RANDY
Everyone just stop, we're not doing this. [muffled] Thank you. South Park, uh, we-we're cutting this short. I was totally wrong and I want to apologize.
STAN
No, dad, it's the toilet paper companies that are behind all the --
RANDY
Yeah, I know. [muffled] Yeah, so, uh, we-we have nothing against toilet paper. It's a great product, and uh, it was childish of me to make fun of it. Thanks, though. We'll see ya later.
STAN
Dad, we can't just back down.
RANDY
Bro! I got fucking shot! [muffled] Japanese toilets are totally unnecessary, and, uh, in case anyone else is listening, I think all of South Park would like to apologize. [he turns around to face the audience.] We retract what we said about toilet paper companies. They -- They have done nothing but help us, and we are sorry. [muffled again] South Park -- everyone -- say you're sorry.
CROWD
We're sorry.
RANDY
Okay, great. Come on, guys, let's go home.
STAN
What about helping people and leading by example?
RANDY
We're not the goddamn Kennedys, Stan. Stop being an idiot.
[Tegridy Farms. Randy buries out his Ol' Blue toilet from a graveyard and installs it back up in the powder room.]
RANDY
Nice to have you back, Ol' Blue. You know, guys, I'm not actually not that sad. Having a Japanese toilet was great, but... I've come to realize that when you have some big, nice luxury thing, it eventually just becomes normal. But you start comparing it to all the other things in your life which suddenly feel you have to upgrade, too. So, it's really best to just stick with the beat-up, crappy old things we have. Love you forever, honey. [he kisses Sharon on the cheek]
End of Japanese Toilet

synopsis:Stan is reeling when a cheating scandal hits the school.

script:Deep Learning

[South Park Elementary playground, kids are playing and talking. The screen cuts to Nichole, Betsy, Red and Nelly watching as Wendy plays hopscotch. Bebe runs into the frame. holding her phone.]
BEBE
You guys! You guys, oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!
RED
What is it?
NELLY
What happened, Bebe?
BEBE
Clyde just sent me another text.
[The girls awe at Bebe, who is turning around and showing them her phone screen. Wendy frowns.]
NICHOLE
Oh, what's this one say?
BEBE
I texted him if he thought about me all the time, and he texted back 'it certainly seems like all the time. It's hard to get someone like you out of my mind'.
NICHOLE, BETSY, NELLY AND RED
Aww!
BEBE
Doesn't he just send the best texts ever?
[The girls agree with Bebe. The scene cuts to Wendy, who frowns over at Bebe and the girls, and then it cuts back to them.]
BEBE
Yesterday I texted him 'how do you know you're in love with me?' And he said 'I know I'm in love with you because spending time with you makes me feel like I'm home, and I can't imagine life without you'.
RED
That's so sweet!
WENDY
Clyde wrote that?
[Bebe turns away, speaking into her phone. The other girls watch with smiles on their faces.]
BEBE
O.M.G, Clyde, do you really care about me that much?
[The scene cuts to Red and Wendy.]
RED
Does Stan ever talk to you like that, Wendy?
WENDY
No... every time I send Stan a text he just responds with a thumbs-up emoji.
[The scene cuts back to all the girls.]
BEBE
Yeah, well, Clyde's just really into me. Oh, he's texting back.
[The scene cuts to Bebe's phone screen, displaying texts between her and Clyde.]
BEBE
'Yes. I do care about you that much. You mean a lot to me and I care deeply about you'.
NICHOLE, BETSY AND RED
Aww!
BETSY
He sure is in love with you, Bebe!
RED
He's a goddamn dreamboat!
BEBE
Yeah, well, Clyde's just really into me. Oh, he's texting back.
[The girls walk away. Wendy stays. She takes out her phone and goes back over her and Stan's texts. Wendy scrolls down, seeing Stan respond with all of her texts with a thumbs-up emoji. She speaks into her phone.]
WENDY
Hey, Stan... Is there a time we could talk today? I'm feeling a little insecure about some things...
[The scene cuts back to Wendy's phone screen. Stan is typing but ultimately responds with a thumbs-up emoji. It cuts back to Wendy, who stares at her phone with a sad expression. The scene cuts to the locker hallway of South Park Elementary, students walk and talk amongst each other. The scene cuts to Clyde, placing textbooks into his locker, Stan walks into frame.]
STAN
Hey, Clyde, can I talk to you?
CLYDE
Sure, bro.
STAN
Well, um, Wendy just came up to me and was acting all hurt 'cause she thinks I don't care about her.
[Clyde shuts his locker, and turns to Stan.]
CLYDE
Uh-huh.
STAN
Well, she says that she wishes I would reply to her texts the way that Clyde responds to Bebe so, like, how do you do it?
[Clyde looks around suspiciously, and moves his hand by his mouth to whisper to Stan.]
CLYDE
Chat GPT, dude.
STAN
Chat GPT?
[Clyde places his arm around Stan, they begin walking a few steps, before Clyde takes out his phone.]
CLYDE
Yeah, dude. There's a bunch of apps and programs you could subscribe to that use open AI to do all your writing for you. People use 'em to write poems, write job applications, but what they're really good for... is dealing with chicks. Here, check it out. There's tons of Chat GPT apps for your phone.
[The scene cuts to show Clyde's phone screen, displaying his messages with Bebe. He swipes to the home screen, clicks the Chat GPT app, and then returns to his and Bebe's texts.]
CLYDE
So, then I can take whatever latest dumb thing Bebe texted me, I copy it, then I open the GPT app, click 'respond to', paste her text here, hit 'write'. It just thinks for a second. 'You would look great with any length of hair! Trying a new look could be fun'. Copy that into messages and send it off. It's super easy and convenient and it saves me a ton of time because she texts me so goddamn much.
[Clyde's phone buzzes. The screen cuts back to the phone screen.]
CLYDE
Jesus Christ! 'I probably won't do it, but thanks for being supportive'. Cut. Paste. Write. Cut. Messages. Paste. Send. There.
[The screen cuts back to Clyde and Stan. Clyde wipes his hands together.]
CLYDE
All done with her stupid shit.
STAN
This is a real app?
CLYDE
It'll completely change your life, bro. Just, uh, just don't tell anybody, huh? If Bebe found out, I'd be a dead man.
[Clyde walks away smiling. The screen cuts to Tegridy Farms, then to Stan in his room, at his desk. He takes out his phone, looking through his and Wendy's texts. There are more messages, and a new one. Stan contemplates. He follows Clyde's instructions, and copies the text and pastes it into the Chat GPT app. The scene cuts to Wendy and her parents at the dinner table. Wendy is playing with her food, looking sad. She grabs her phone and sees a new text from Stan. She reads the text, shocked. She smiles and holds the phone close, then gets off of her chair and begins spinning around. The scene cuts to Wendy on her bed, smiling widely at her phone and texting Stan back. The scene cuts to Stan sitting on the toilet. He grabs his phone, and repeats the steps. He puts it back on the sink. The scene cuts back to Wendy, smiling as she stares at her phone. She spins around, standing on her bed. The scene cuts to the South Park Elementary playground, Wendy is sitting at the merry-go-round with Nichole and Red at her side. She talks, showing both girls her phone. The scene cuts back to the family dinner table. Wendy's parents look at her, and then at each other. Wendy is still smiling at her phone. The scene cuts to Stan on the couch, playing video games. His phone buzzes, and he picks it up, repeating the steps. It cuts to Wendy, who pats her chest with a fond look before texting back. The scene cuts to the park basketball area, Kenny, Kyle, Stan and Tolkien are playing basketball. As Stan grabs the ball, his phone buzzes, and he repeats the steps. The scene cuts to Wendy walking through a meadow, staring happily at her phone. The screen cuts to Stan resting on a loungechair behind the barn in Tegridy Farms. He holds his phone, and with his eyes closed, repeats the steps. The scene cuts to Wendy in her bedroom, sitting at her window, on her phone. The scene cuts back to Stan on the couch, playing video games. His phone rings, and he looks surprised. He picks up. The scene cuts continuously between the two.]
STAN
Hello?
WENDY
Hey, Stan, I didn't get it yet.
STAN
Didn't get what?
WENDY
You asked me if I wanted a bedtime story about frogs, or a song about swans. I said a bedtime story!
STAN
Oh, yeah, I- I wrote it. I'll send it to you right now.
WENDY
Okay, bye!
[The scene cuts back to Stan. He opens the Chat GPT app, and types in 'write a nice bedtime story about frogs'. The app instantly responds. The scene cuts back to Wendy, lying in bed, reading the story. She hugs her phone close, and closes her eyes. The scene cuts back to South Park Elementary, then the classroom, where students are chatting and getting into their seats. Mr Garrison walks into frame after them.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, let's take our seats. I've graded your midterm essays, and I have to say for the most part, they were terrible. However, there are some essays that I'm very happy with.
[Mr. Garrison begins handing out papers.]
MR. GARRISON
There was a really great essay from Clyde on the '1840s Labor Unions and Their Effect on the Industrial Revolution'. Let's hear it for Clyde, kids! Great work, Clyde.
CLYDE
Thank you. Thank you.
[The class applauses. Stan stares at Clyde, sitting at a desk by his side. He crosses his arms, looking suspisciously.]
STAN
Uh-huh.
CLYDE
What?
[The scene cuts back to Mr. Garrison.]
MR. GARRISON
Someone who never writes good essays, Butters, wrote an amazing piece on 'Post-Cold War Poland and the Changing Provision of Security'. Check plus, Butters!
BUTTERS
Oh, uh... thanks.
[The scene cuts to Stan looking behind his desk, at Butters. He turns and stares suspiciously. Butters, forcing a smile, waves back. Stan turns.]
MR. GARRISON
And we also have another student who wrote a shockingly good paper. This one's called 'A Feminist Neoliberal Perspective of Post-War Afghanistan'... by Eric Cartman!
CARTMAN
Ah, yes, thank you, thank you.
[The scene cuts to Stan staring at Cartman, beside him, suspiciously. Cartman side-eyes him.]
MR. GARRISON
And this week, we have a new student to the check plus club, for an amazing essay called 'Writing a Policy About Improving the Rights of Migrant Workers'. Let's hear it for Stan!
[The class applauses, Stan forces a smile. At his side, Cartman stares suspiciously. Stan turns, and returns the look. The scene cuts to Cartman, Clyde, Butters and Stan walking into the boys' bathroom.]
CARTMAN
Alright, what the hell is going on?
STAN
You tell me what's going on!
CARTMAN
Clearly, somebody told Stan about Chat GPT!
STAN
You guys are using it to write essays, too!
CARTMAN
Yes, we are all using it, and we had a pact that we wouldn't tell anyone else because then everyone will start using it, and Mr. Garrison will figure it out! So who the [bleep] blabbed to Stan?
CLYDE
I just told Stan about it as a tool to text his girlfriend.
CARTMAN
God damn it, Clyde! You don't use an amazing AI cheating tool to talk to girls! You're gonna ruin everything! This can't be open source, you guys! If everyone starts using Chat GPT, then we lose our unfair advantage.
[A student barges into the bathroom. He walks past the boys, and walks towards one of the urinals. The boys stay silent. The students starts peeing. He sniffs, grunts and farts. The boys continue to stay silent. Once the student is done, he flushes the urinal, and goes to the sink to wash his hands.]
CARTMAN
Oh, god-[bleep]-damn it.
[The student grabs a paper towel, and turns to stare at the boys. He smashes the paper towel into a ball, wipes his hands, and throws it in the trash, still staring. After a second, he leaves.]
CARTMAN
If they find out that we don't have to work anymore, then they aren't gonna want to work and then we're all screwed! Who's the one who first found Chat GPT and thought to use it for essays?
CLYDE
Butters.
CARTMAN
Right. But then Butters told me about it, and I told him not to tell anyone else!
BUTTERS
Right, but then you went and blabbed about it to Clyde.
CARTMAN
That's right. I was a little excited.
STAN
You guys, I'm not going to tell anyone else! You really think I want Wendy finding out about this thing?
CARTMAN
Fine. So we're all in it together. But you guys need to be careful what you use it for. Because once you bring girls into things, they're gonna ruin it. Just like slavery.
[The scene cuts to Mr. Garrison's residence, where he lives with his boyfriend, Rick. Garrison is at the table, grading papers. In the background, Rick is cutting up food.]
MR. GARRISON
Ugh... ugh, God, I can't take it, Rick!
RICK
What's the matter?
MR. GARRISON
Oh, it's just grading these stupid papers all the time! I have to read 'em all and comment on each one of them. Jesus Christ. Something's changed, and now a few of the kids are writing these really long, detailed essays. I don't know what's going on. I guess I've just taught them really well, maybe a bit too well.
RICK
Uh, yeah... Have you ever heard of Chat GPT?
MR. GARRISON
Chat GP-whoza what? The [bleep] is that?
RICK
There's a few apps now, really. But see? It has AI and takes any subject matter and can instantly give you whatever kind of content you want.
MR. GARRISON
Wait a minute... There's an app that anyone can use that does all the thinking and writing for you?
RICK
Yeah.
MR. GARRISON
Well, this is gonna be amazing! I can use it to grade all my papers, and no one will ever know!
RICK
Uh, yeah, sure.
MR. GARRISON
I'll just type the title of the essay in, and it'll generate a comment, and I don't even have to read the stupid things!
RICK
Yeah, and then you'll have more free time.
MR. GARRISON
Oh, this is great. Thanks so much! Just gotta make sure nobody finds out I'm being sneaky. Oh, and- and, hey, Rick?
RICK
Yeah?
MR. GARRISON
Thanks for all the replies to my texts today. They were really supportive.
RICK
Oh. Yeah. Sure thing.

[The scene cuts to Willy's Chilly Ice Cream Parlor. Inside, Stan and Wendy are sitting in a booth, eating ice cream. The scene cuts continuously between the two.]
WENDY
This place is good, right?
STAN
Yeah, it's really good.
WENDY
Well, I know it's not much, but I just wanted to take you out somewhere to say thanks, Stan.
STAN
For what?
WENDY
For stepping up and working on communication when I asked you to.
STAN
Oh, that's cool.
WENDY
The things we've talked about, Stan, it's really helping me. I don't feel so alone and misunderstood. I've been so scared for so long to tell anyone what happened to me when I was six.
STAN
Yeah.
WENDY
(Starts tearing up) And... everything you had to say about it was just right. It really changed the way I think about the whole thing.
STAN
Yeah.
WENDY
And when you said the same thing happened to you, I- I couldn't believe it. Were you at home when it happened?
STAN
Yep.
WENDY
But you're right. We can't dwell on those things. You're right about a lot of stuff. There was just that one thing I don't understand... about the boating accident in Switzerland?
STAN
The boating accident in Switzerland... was tough.
WENDY
I thought you said it was great.
STAN
It was great... and very tough.
WENDY
(Blinks back tears) But how did it cause the thing with your cousin?
STAN
Oh, shit. What time is it?
WENDY
It's a little after four.
STAN
Oh, shit. My mom told me to be home right at a little after four. Sorry, Wendy. I- I gotta get going.
WENDY
No, no, no, that's totally okay. I gotta get going, too.
STAN
Okay, cool.
[Wendy shuffles over, and hugs Stan. He is shocked.]
WENDY
Thank you so much, Stan. Thank you for being the only real thing in my life.
[Wendy waves at Stan and leaves.]
STAN
Shit.
[The scene cuts to South Park Elementary, fourth grade classroom. The students sit at their desks, presenting their poetry. Clyde is standing at the front. Mr. Garrison is leaning back at his desk, feet up with headphones in.]
CLYDE
'Oh, Bebe, your name is like a song. A melody stuck in my head so long'.
[The scene cuts to Bebe, who is holding her head and watching Clyde fondly, it cuts back to Clyde.]
CLYDE
'I can't help but smile when I hear it said... Bebe, the name always in my head'.
CARTMAN
Oh, God, so obvious.
CLYDE
'I dream of spending my days with you, Bebe'.
[The scene cuts to Wendy and Stan. Stan is staring down at his desk, Wendy looks over with a smile. Stan looks back, forcing a smile. It cuts back to Clyde.]
CLYDE
'In South Park, or anywhere that maybay. Talking, laughing, just being together. In a dream I hope will last forever'.
[The scene cuts to Mr. Mackey walking in, he knocks on the door to alert Mr. Garrison and get his attention.]
MR. MACKEY
Excuse me, Mr. Garrison? Mr. Garrison?
MR. GARRISON
Oh, yeah. What?
MR. MACKEY
I'm sorry, but I need to address your class really quick.
MR. GARRISON
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. Go ahead.
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, kids, I need to discuss a very serious matter. There is a rumor going around that someone at this school is using OpenAI technology to do their work.
[The scene cuts to Stan looking at Cartman, Cartman then looks at Stan, then Butters]
MR. GARRISON
Well, that's crazy! Who would do that?
MR. MACKEY
Now, I know that everyone at this school is honest, hard-working, m'kay, wouldn't...Wouldn't even want to use this "ChatGBD".
BUTTERS
ChatGPT!
MR. MACKEY
Oh, m'kay. But the school board has decided to call in a company that can detect AI in schoolwork and make sure nobody here is cheating.
CARTMAN
They...They are gonna what?
MR. MACKEY
So we're just gonna collect all the school work that we can.
[Mr. Mackey collects all the assignments]
MR. GARRISON
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
MR. MACKEY
And we're gonna have them analyzed for any AI contributions, m'kay?
MR. GARRISON
Well, those are...Those aren't, uh, quite ready.
MR. MACKEY
Don't worry, we'll get these all back to you after the testers look through them. M'kay, kids, sorry for the intrusion. Get back to your day, m'kay?
[The scene cuts to Cartman, Clyde, Butters and Stan walking into the boys' bathroom again.]
CARTMAN
God fucking dammit! I told you guys this was gonna happen!
BUTTERS
What are we gonna do?!
CARTMAN
There's nothing we can do. It's over, we've lost our unfair advantage.
STAN
That's not what's important. If they find out I've been using OpenAI for class, Wendy's gonna know I've been using it with her, and It's gonna crush her!
CLYDE
Dude, same, Bebe's gonna fucking kill me!
CARTMAN
And who's fault is that, you guys? I told you that once you bring women into things, they ruin it just like they did slavery.
BUTTERS
Okay, Eric, could you explain exactly how women ruined slavery?
CARTMAN
No, I can't! Because I can't use fucking ChatGPT anymore 'cause we got fucking busted!
STAN
Look, maybe...Maybe this AI-detection technology won't work.
CARTMAN
It doesn't matter if it doesn't work. Cat is out of the bag now! This was supposed to be our thing, for us to get ahead, but now-
[A student barges into the bathroom again. He walks past the boys.]
CARTMAN
God dammit, Get the fuck out of here!
[The student leaves the bathroom.]
[Mr. Mackey's Office.]
MR. MACKEY
um kay I am just a little confused. you think we shouldn't have the kids school work analyzed for using AI writing app?
[scene cuts to Mr. Garrison]
MR. GARRISON
Look, it’s just. It’s really unfair to the kids. I mean what are we saying that we don’t trust them? I mean geeze
[scene goes back to Mr. Mackey]
MR. MACKEY
But don’t you think if kids are not writing their own papers we should know?
[scene goes back to Mr. Garrison]
MR. GARRISON
Oh what are people afraid of? That AI is going to replace real writers, That Hollywood is going to become a bland recycling of old ideas it already is. AI might help it.
[scene goes back to Mr. Mackey]
MR. MACKEY
Well I don’t know what you want me to
[scene Mr. Mackey desk phone beeps and Mr. Mackey answers it]
MR. MACKEY
Yes?
SECRETARY
Mr. Mackey the technician from the school advisory board just pulled in to the parking lot.
[scene cuts to the school lobby.
the front door opens and the School Advisory Board Technician enters with his bird.]
SCHOOL ADVISORY BOARD TECHNICIAN
Someone here using AI technology to do their classwork? If there is ChatGPT being used here I will find it. Shadow Bain fly.
[The bird fly’s and grabs a student’s paper and gives it to School Advisory Board Technician. Then the technician puts confetti on the paper and blows it off then rings 2 bells on the paper. The scene cuts to Mr. Mackey and Mr. Garrison]
MR. MACKEY
Hello I am the councillor here at South Park Elementary. This is one of our teachers Mr. Garrison.
SCHOOL ADVISORY BOARD TECHNICIAN
Hi, I been hired by the Park County school board to determine if any students are using generative AI technology to do their work.
MR. MACKEY
Yes we excited to work with you. We have a lot of great students here.
[School Advisory Board Technician walks further in the school]
SCHOOL ADVISORY BOARD TECHNICIAN
Come Shadow Bain let us find this ChatGPT using cheater.
[scene cuts too 4th grade class room Mr. Garrison is sitting alone at his desk.]
MR. GARRISON
I am going to get fired that it.
[Stan walk in the class room.]
STAN
Mr. Garrison can I talk to you?
MR. GARRISON
Uh is it important Stan I am kind of dealing with some stuff right now?
STAN
Yes it is important. You know when you done something wrong sometimes the best thing to do is to come out and admit it.
MR. GARRISON
uh. OK. OK you’re right. How did you find out?
STAN
Clyde told me about it. I came to you because if they find out something me and you punish me it’s going to really hurt Wendy.
MR. GARRISON
I don’t want to punish anyone Stan. I completely understand.
STAN
You do?
MR. GARRISON
Sure. I think most of the world does. I mean why does it matter who uses AI apps it’s just like having a good writers assistant.
STAN
Yeah. Like a good writers assistant.
MR. GARRISON
Yeah. I mean you are still taking the time to like push the buttons and stuff.
STAN
Yeah. So you really don’t think Wendy will be upset that I used ChatGPT to respond to her texts?
MR. GARRISON
Hold on? People can use it to respond to other people’s text?
[scene cuts too Mr. Garrison’s house where Rick is baking so goods then it cuts back to the 4th grade classroom.]
MR. GARRISON
Rick that lying piece of shit.
STAN
So you were just saying it was understandable….
MR. GARRISON
No this is totally different who ever uses it for messages is a fucking launder….
[scene cuts to the hallway where fireworks sound are heard students are running and screaming.]
MR. MACKEY
um OK everyone please just stay calm.
BOBBY PALMER
they got him. They found the kid that been using the AI app.
[scene cuts to the doors of the library where the students and the School Advisory Board Technician have gathered.]
SCHOOL ADVISORY BOARD TECHNICIAN
Get back. Get back all of you I have the student isolated inside.
MR. MACKEY
What exactly have you found .
SCHOOL ADVISORY BOARD TECHNICIAN
We went throw thousands of papers but then Shadow Bain detected chat bot writing in this student phone (pulls out a phone). (Shadow Bain start attacking the phone) There you see she’s going crazy.
[Stan Oh no then he runs to the library door and peeks in and sees Wendy.]
WENDY
What is going on?
STAN
Oh god o no no the GPT stuff on her phone didn’t come from her.
SCHOOL ADVISORY BOARD TECHNICIAN
Keep all the children back Mackey. We can’t let it spread I will go inside and get her confession.
[School Advisory Board Technician enters the library and locks the door behind him and approaches Wendy and rings some bells around her as Shadow Bain comes.]
SCHOOL ADVISORY BOARD TECHNICIAN
you have been cheating on your school work.
WENDY
No I haven’t.
SCHOOL ADVISORY BOARD TECHNICIAN
Silence. You have used ChatGPT to do your essays for you. Now have yourself the school.
WENDY
I write my own essays.
[Back out in the school hallway.]
STAN
I don’t know what to do. I am not creative enough to think of a way out of this. Wait that’s it.
[outside the school Stan takes out his phone and starts typing On ChatGPT.]
[Stan enters the school.]
CHAT GPT
one day when Stan got to school he was approached by his best friend.
KYLE
Dude, did you hear what happened to your girlfriend?
STAN
No what about her?
KYLE
Dude, she got caught cheating on her essay.
CHAT GPT
Just then Stan noticed a commotion down the hallway.
[Sean cuts to the hallway. Wendy (handcuffed) is being escorted by two police men while Mr. Mackey and the School Advisory Board Technician watch.]
SCHOOL ADVISORY BOARD TECHNICIAN
This student is going to jail for cheating.
MR. MACKEY
Drugs are bad uh Kay.
STAN
Hold it right there.
STAN
Look everyone we can’t blame people who use ChatGPT. It’s not their fault.
[Sean cuts to Mr. Mackey.]
MR. MACKEY
Well whose fault is it?
[Sean cuts to Stan.]
STAN
I tell you who it is the giant tech companies. Who took open AI packaged it monetized it and pushed it out to all of us as fast as they could in order to get ahead. Open AI is so powerful that it has to be something that everyone can use, control and contribute to or else AI will be controlled by corporations who just want an unfair advantage like Cartman does.
[Sean cuts to Eric Cartman.]
ERIC CARTMAN
Hay screw you. You dumb Jew.
[Sean cuts to Stan.]
STAN
We don’t want big corporations deciding what is ethical and acceptable for AI. We were all taken advantage of and that’s why my girlfriend will totality understa nd that I used ChatGPT to respond to her text.
WENDY
That’s right.
[Sean cuts to Wendy.]
[A police officer takes Wendy’s handcuffs off.]
POLICE OFFICER
Well I guess we can let you go now madam.
[Sean cuts to School Advisory Board Technician.]
SCHOOL ADVISORY BOARD TECHNICIAN
I will find these tech companies who are trying to use open AI for their own gains and I will stop them.
End of Deep Learning
