synopsis:South Park Elementary gets a new principal.

script:Stunning and Brave

[South Park Elementary cafeteria, night. Emergency All School meeting. Students and their parents file into the cafeteria and find seats. Mr. Mackey approaches the mic]
MR. MACKEY
Alright parents and students, please take your seats. [A gleeful Randy crumples a sheet of paper into a ball and throws it at him as Sharon looks on. The crumpled up paper strikes Mr. Mackey, who tries to deflect it and gets annoyed] Okay, okay. Now as you know, There was an incident at the school last week involving a student referring to rape as a "hot Cosby," okay? [everyone laughs. Cartman looks around, smiling] Listen, listen! Principal Victoria has been fired!
VARIOUS ADULTS
What? Fired?
CARTMAN
Sweet dude!
MR. MACKEY
And a new person has been appointed to try and make South Park Elementary a more... progressive place that... fits in with today's times. Heh ukay? So please welcome... PC Principal. [a burly man holding a sports bottle walks through the cafeteria. He sports a goatee, a hint of a mustache, and Oakley sunglasses. He swallows the last of the drink and throws the bottle off to one side]
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright, listen up. My name is PC Principal. I don't know about you, but frankly I'm sick and tired of how minority groups are marginalized in today's society. I'm here because this place is lost in a time warp! Students who still use the word "retarded"! A teacher who said women without wombs should get an AIDS test!
MR. GARRISON
Oh, I was a [takes his right wrist and flips it forward] lesbian then.
PC PRINCIPAL
A chef "person of color" who the children had sing soul songs and who the children drove to kill himself!
BUTTERS
No, he got brainwashed by a cult.
PC PRINCIPAL
[aims his left index finger at Butters] And that's two days' detention for you, young man! We'll see you at 4!
BUTTERS
What??
PC PRINCIPAL
Let me ask you this. We're in Colorado, right?! Where are the Hispanic kids?! Huh?! Where are the ethnic and racial minorities?!
MR. MACKEY
Well, we have Tolkien; he's black.
PC PRINCIPAL
[aims his left index finger at Mr. Mackey] And that's two days' detention for you, Mackey! Congratulations!
MR. MACKEY
Wha- I got detention?
PC PRINCIPAL
I Googled South Park before I came here, and I cannot believe the shit you're getting away with! People claiming to be advocates of transgender rights, but really just wanting to use the women's bathroom! [Sharon and Stan look at Randy] A white man who thinks he's Chinese and built a wall to keep out Mongolians.
TUONG LU KIM
Ohhhh I hate-a Mongorians!
PC PRINCIPAL
What the fuck is this?! Are you fucking kidding me?! I'm telling you all, this is done! Like it or not, PC is back, and it's bigger than ever! Weoo-weoo-weoo You hear that?! That's the sound of 2015 pulling you over, people! Suck it! [holds his right arm out and lets the mic drop to the floor from his hand]
[South Park Elementary, day. Kids walk here and there in the hall. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny walk together]
STAN
[looking around] Man, I guess things are going to be different around here.
KYLE
You know what? I think it's good. Let's face it: this is long overdue.
BUTTERS
[runs up to the other three] Did you guys hear? Cartman got four days' detention, for calling Heidi Turner "clitty litter"!
KENNY
(Really?)
BUTTERS
But the thing is, Eric isn't even fightin' it. It's like he's all sad and scared.
KYLE
Good! He should be sad and scared! These things do matter and I already feel better to be at a school where we can start to have a dialogue and talk about this stuff.
MR. MACKEY
[over the P.A. system] Will uh, Kyle Broflovski report to the principal's office immediately? Uhkay? Kyle Broflovski. [Kyle walks off] Did I, did I say that all right?
[The principal's office, some time later. Gerald opens the office door and steps in]
GERALD
Uhm, hi, I'm Gerald, Kyle Broflovski's father.
PC PRINCIPAL
Have a seat. I've been talking with your child, and we're gonna be giving him two weeks' detention.
GERALD
[to Kyle, in a hushed voice] Wull, what's this about, Kyle?
PC PRINCIPAL
Your son said some things to a fourth-grade girl that frankly make me wanna puke! Now that I'm principal, I'm not gonna allow [pounds the desk with his left fist] anyone at this school to be made feel unsafe and harassed!
GERALD
Wh-wh-what did he say?
PC PRINCIPAL
[takes off his sunglasses] You'll have to excuse my language. [picks up a report and clears his throat] "I don't think Caitlyn Jenner is a hero." [no reaction from Gerald or Kyle. PC Principal gets ready to erupt] This kind of transphobic and [pounds the desk with his left fist] bigoted hate speech isn't gonna fly here, bro! Well I though we were all on board that Caitlyn Jenner is an amazing, [quickly stands up] beautiful woman who had the exquisite bravery of a butterfly flying against the wind. And then this shit comes out of people's mouths!
GERALD
PC Principal, I, I'm sure Kyle was just referring to Bruce Jenner as a person, and not trying to say anything against-
PC PRINCIPAL
You got a fuckin' problem bro?!
GERALD
No...
PC PRINCIPAL
'Cause it's not Bruce fuckin' Jenner! It's Caitlyn, and she's a fuckin' stunning woman! Or maybe you're the one teaching him to demean women in the first place! HUH?! What's up?! What's fuckin' up, bro?
GERALD
Look, maybe we can all just ta-
PC PRINCIPAL
Get the fuck out of here, dude! [turns the desk over, sending papers all over the place]
GERALD AND KYLE
[alarmed] Aaah! [Gerald takes Kyle and they both rush to the door, open it, and rush out]
[Crunchy's Micro Brew. The men of the town have gathered at this new watering hole. At the center table sit Stuart, Stephen, Randy, Gerald, and Ryan Valmer]
RANDY
I mean, who the hell does this guy think he is? Some college kid's gonna come in and tell us our ways are old?
STUART
Yeah. And, you can't bully our kids like that.
GERALD
Kyle's already got two weeks of detention.
STEPHEN
Huh for what?!
GERALD
Just 'cause he said something about Caitlyn Jenner. [a hush falls over the table]
STEPHEN
Oh, Caitlyn Jenner. she's a hero. She is stunning and brave.
STUART
Stunning. She is absolutely beautiful, and an inspiration.
RYAN
Yup!
RANDY
Yup, that's right.
GERALD
Well what the hell were you guys talki-
RYAN
We've gotta be careful, Gerald. This is a college bar.
PC BRO 1
Somebody here have a problem with Caitlyn Jenner?
RYAN
No.
PC BRO 1
No? 'Cause she's a stunning, beautiful woman, and if you wanna call her anything else I'm ready to fuckin' throw down!
STUART
No no, we're totally fine with it.
PC BRO 2
Weoo-weoo-weoo-weoo-weoo! [walks up waving his left hand over his head like a police siren] It? Did somebody just refer to Caitlyn Jenner as "it"? I'm PC, bro. I'll throw down!
PC BRO 1
Sweet. You're PC bro?
PC BRO 2
Yeah, Arizona State.
PC BRO 1
Sweet, bro. I'm PC UMass.
PC BRO 2
Fuck yeah! Sweet, dude! [holds up his left hand open]
PC BRO 1
[clasps the other guy's left hand with his own] Sweet! [releases the grip] So, do we have a fuckin' problem here?
STEPHEN
No! Caitlyn Jenner is the bravest woman in America.
PC BRO 3
Weoo-eoowoo-eoowoo-oo! [walks up waving his right hand over his head like a police siren] Did someone here just say "America" in a way that "other-izes" and demeans the people of Latin and South America?!
PC BRO 2
Nice, dude. You PC?
PC BRO 3
Yeah, Chino Hills. [to the seated men] You think Venezuelans aren't Americans, brah?!
PC BRO 2
Yeah, you wanna make fun of me?!
PC PRINCIPAL
[notices the commotion and walks up] Hey! What seems to be the problem here, gentlemen?!
PC BRO 1
Who the hell are you?!
PC PRINCIPAL
I'm PC Principal.
PC BRO 2
Oh nice. We're all PC too.
PC PRINCIPAL
No way! There's more PC bros here?
PC BRO 4
Yeah dude, Ohio State.
PC PRINCIPAL
Sweet, bros. Texas A&M. Bro, I had no idea there were like-minded individuals in this town that defended social minorities. We should all hang out.
PC BRO 1
We should totally hang out.
PC BRO 4
We should all get a house together and unite our tolerant views.
PC BRO 1
Fuckin' do it, dude!
PC BRO 4
Fuck yeah!
[A new frat house in South Park - Rho Omega Delta - night. PC bros are everywhere, lifting weights, fighting, drinking from kegs, having a good time. Two of them are on a balcony drinking PBR as two farmers gaze at the house from a distance.]
JANITOR
Well, looks like thangs are gettin' all PC again. [a shot of the house again]
FRIEND
Well how long d'you think this will last?
JANITOR
Lasted about six years last time. We got at least [checks his watch] 5.9 years to go.
[South Park Elementary, day. The school bell rings, and Cartman is at his locker getting his back pack. The other boys walk up to him.]
KYLE
Uhhh, hey Cartman. Uhwaht's goin' on? Aren't you going to ah, you know, go do something about this new principal?
CARTMAN
I've already got four days of detention. I don't want anymore. I'm gonna start following the rules.
STAN
But, this isn't you, Cartman.
KYLE
Yeah, where is the Eric Cartman we know? The Eric Cartman we know breaks the rules. And he gets away with it. Just like his hero! Come on, who's your hero, Cartman?!
CARTMAN
[sighs heavily] Tom Brady.
STAN
Right! And what does Tom Brady do after breaking the rules?
CARTMAN
Deny and subvert.
STAN
Yeah!
BUTTERS
Yeah, what? Well what would Tom Brady say if he got caught shoplifting.
CARTMAN
Everybody shoplifts. Why are you coming down on me?
BUTTERS
Yeah!
KYLE
[walks up to Cartman] You're Tom Brady, Cartman! And that new principal in there is the football commissioner trying to dictate his punishment to you. And what happens when an invulnerable cheater comes up against an elitist corporate dictator?
CARTMAN
A perfect storm of hypocrisy that everyone in the country has to deal with for months on end.
CARTMAN
[pacing back and forth] You're right, guys. I'm gonna Tom Brady this thing!
BOYS
Yeah!
CARTMAN
I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say "You're not giving me four day of detention! You're only giving me one!"
BOYS
Yeah!
CARTMAN
NO! No, to hell with that! "You're giving me NO days detention! And then I'm gonna go home and fuck my hot wife! Who's not even that hot, and kinda looks like a dude!" [marches off]
BOYS
Yeah!
CARTMAN
[turns around] Thanks, guys. I almost forgot the lessons that football has taught us all. I can get around these pesky rules. Butters, I'm going to need your underwear. [walks off]
BUTTERS
Well ohhh-kay! [walks off after Cartman]
KYLE
Cool. I think we did it. [raises his left arm, and Stan high-fives it]
[South Park Elementary, hallway. PC Principal walks through it like the Big Man On Campus. The kids look up at him in awe. He reaches the stairs leading up to the faculty bathroom. Nearby Jenny Simons looks at him, he looks back. He opens his arms as if to scare a bear, then he takes a step in Jenny's direction. Jenny backs away immediately. PC Principal goes downstairs.]
[Faculty bathroom, moments later. PC Principal puts his glasses behind his head and does his business at the urinal. Cartman drops down from the toilet in the stall behind the principal and steps outside the stall]
CARTMAN
Oh, PC Principal, how are you today?
PC PRINCIPAL
What are you doing in the faculty bathroom?
CARTMAN
You know, I think you and I got off on the wrong foot the other day. By all means, please, keep your dick out. You see, I'm not going to accept four days of detention and... you're going t'apologize publicly for being so strict to me and my friends at school.
PC PRINCIPAL
What the fuck are you talking about?
CARTMAN
It's just a request, that's all. See you around. [stops and looks down] Oh, you seem to have dropped something, PC Principal. [picks it up] What's this? Why, this is a little boy's underwear. [sniffs at it] Why, this is Butters' underwear.
PC PRINCIPAL
[zips up and looks at Cartman] What?
CARTMAN
PC Principal, you have Butters' underwear and now... [drops it into the urinal and soaks it in PC Principal's urine - the principal had not flushed the urinal - and pulls the briefs out.] Oh my gosh, it's got your DNA all over it. [through some windows above the urinal, Kyle, Butters, Craig, Stan, and Tolkien watch the action unfold] This certainly doesn't look good for you. I don't need to tell anyone about this. No, I think we have an understanding. Capiche?
PC PRINCIPAL
What did you just say?
CARTMAN
You mean about keeping your dick out?
PC PRINCIPAL
"Capiche"?! You're associating Italian-Americans to intimidation tactics?! [one by one, the boys' smiles disappear] You'd better watch your micro-aggression's, bro! [now the boys are afraid of the next move]
CARTMAN
Oh-kay. Look, you don't want to end up like the spokesman for Subway, so you?
PC PRINCIPAL
Did you just use a term that excludes women from an occupation?! [picks Cartman up...]
CARTMAN
Okay, let's back up. [...and slams him against the stall] Aaah!
PC PRINCIPAL
[slams him several times into the wall next to the mirror] Did you just say "spokesman" instead of "spokesperson"?! When women are just as capable at selling sandwiches as anyone?! [slams Cartman into the mirror, shattering it]
CARTMAN
AAHH!
PC PRINCIPAL
Are you purposely trying to use words that assert your male privilege?! [slams Cartman into a sink, shattering it]
CARTMAN
[quuickly] No, I'm sorry. I was just trying to frame you for raping Butters!
PC PRINCIPAL
[ignoring him] Do you think Italian-Americans and women are less important?! [pins Cartman to the floor and starts beating him up]
CARTMAN
Oh God!
PC PRINCIPAL
You dare to use words that alienate two communities of people who have to deal with verbal biases like yours on a daily basis?! [beats him up some more. The other boys leave the window and walk away.]
[Rho Omega Delta house. The frat bros are having a good time as "Genius of Love" plays in the background. Randy looks out from his bedroom window, not being able to sleep, and sees the frat house. He puts his fists against his hips and heads for the house. He bangs on the door until it opens]
RANDY
Can I speak with PC Principal please?
PC BRO 5
Oh yeah. We got another one, guys!
PC BRO 6
All right. Bring him in, bro!
PC BRO 7
[voice only] We're ready! Woo! [other PC bros haul him in and change his clothes]
RANDY
Hey what? [stands in line with a bunch of other guys] Hey no, I- No, I don't- [he is now wearing a PLEDGE shirt - he is now a pledge for this fraternity]
PC BRO 8
All the pledges take a shot! [the music is cut off, frat bros come in and offers the pledges swigs from various bottles of liquor]
PC PRINCIPAL
All right pledgies, we're excited. You wanna try and be PC. We hope you've got what it takes to join the most socially active group in America.
PC BROS
Weoooh!
PC PRINCIPAL
You know, there's still some people out there that say "What does being PC really mean?" Well, I'll tell you what it means. It means you love nothin' more than beer, workin' out, and that feelin' you get when you rhetorically defend a marginalized community from systems of oppression.
PC BROS
Wooo! Yeah! Dude, let's go! Woowooo! Yeah!
RANDY
[takes a swig] Yeah!
PC BROS
Wooohooo!
RANDY
[shakes his head vigorously] Wooo-ooo!
PC BROS
Wooohooo! let's go! Yeah!
[The Marsh house, early morning. Randy comes down the stairs slowly, painfully. He stops a moment to address a headache. He makes his way slowly to the kitchen and sits at the breakfast table. He hangs his head and rests it on his right hand. Sharon, arms crossed, has been waiting for him.]
SHARON
You got home pretty late last night. Six AM?
RANDY
I've joined a social awareness group. It's a coalition that discourages the use of ... words that have negative or offensive connotations... to grant respect to people who are victims of unfair stereotypes.
SHARON
You got in at Six and now you're missing work.
RANDY
We've been getting away with horrible things, Sharon. Having- laughs at less privileged people and thinking it was harmless. Our group is... trying to be a civilizing influence... where we discuss and have meetings to better define and reinforce tolerance and acceptance [voice trails off] of all groups of people.
SHARON
Hm... And do they have booze at these meetings?
RANDY
Uhhhh... They serve refreshments, yes.
[A hospital room, night. Cartman is on a bed hooked up to monitoring equipment. He's got two black eyes, cuts on his arms, and a cast on his right leg. Stan, Kyle, Butters, and Kenny stop by]
STAN
Cartman?
CARTMAN
[with raspy voice] We can't beat him, you guys. PC Principal is too strong.
BUTTERS
What do we do now?
CARTMAN
There's nothing left to do. I'm going to admit I did something wrong, take my punishment, and move on. I'm not Tom Brady.
BUTTERS
[earnestly] Oh no!
KYLE
Dude, if we all tell the police what the principal did, he'll be fired!
STAN
Yeah.
CARTMAN
No way.
KYLE
Why?
CARTMAN
Because PC Principal is right, Kyle. You and I are bigots, and it's time for us to grow up.
KYLE
No, you're a bigot.
CARTMAN
If I can face my prejudice, why can't you? We're two privileged, straight white boys who have their laughs about things we never had to deal with.
KYLE
I'm not going to apologize for saying Caitlyn Jenner isn't a hero! In fact, personally, I think she's most likely not a very good person! [the boys gasp]
CARTMAN
[In added pain] Aaahh, aahh! [looks left at Kyle] Kyle, believe me! I know the struggle with hatred. Let's make ourselves better people... together. [reaches out to Kyle]
KYLE
Come on, fat-ass.
CARTMAN
No more fat-shaming, Kyle. Let's start a new chapter.
KYLE
So you're never gonna call me a dirty Jew again?
CARTMAN
No. I'm going to call you... my friend.
KYLE
Oh fuck you. [turns around and walks out]
CARTMAN
I... guess we never realized how bad he really was.
[Rho Omega Delta house, night. Randy dances with other bros to "Watch Me (Whip / Nae Nae)" and takes a sip of beer after each dance move]
PC PRINCIPAL
All right, pledges, listen up. Congratulations on making it to the final cuts. [only three pledges are left - Randy and two other men.]
PLEDGES
Wooohoo! Yeah!
PC PRINCIPAL
Now it's time for the final test. So what you're gonna have to do, to prove you belong with PC, is go out there, and check someone's privilege.
PLEDGE 1
Finally!
PLEDGE 2
Yes!
RANDY
I'm sorry, I don't know what that is.
PC PRINCIPAL
Topher, can you explain "check your privilege" please.
TOPHER
[PC Bro 1] Uh, it's getting someone to acknowledge their own inherent privileges and reminding them to put them aside in order to better understand another human's plight.
PC PRINCIPAL
Yeah, see, there's some people out there like Brett fucking Favre who think that when we all stand up and applaud Caitlyn Jenner at the ESPY Awards, he can get away with one of these bullshit claps! [performs a limp clap] It's called "clapping" Favre! What the fuck are you doing?! Washing your hands?! You're either on board, or you're NOT, bro! Now, if he's gonna bring shame on someone, then he can have his privilege checked and have a little shame brought down on him!
RANDY
You want me to shame Brett Favre?
PC PRINCIPAL
[stops to stare at Randy] No. 'Cause there's somebody even worse now.
[Kyle's room, night. He's asleep, and we quickly find out who could be worse then Brett Favre. On the inner side of the bed is Randy, and on the window side are the two pledges who were with him for the final cut. One 3 the three men shake Kyle's bed and blow into noisemakers.]
KYLE
AAAAHH! What the fuck, dude?! What the fuck?! [A few seconds later the men rush out of the room as he watches them leave. Then he looks down and sees pigs all over the floor. Each one has the word "Biggit" painted on.]
[Cartman's hospital room. He begins to dream of a football game. He's dressed as Tom Brady, with his back to the camera. His voice echoes throughout the dream]
CARTMAN BRADY
[turns around] I may be down, but I'm not out. Tom Brady's never out!
COMMISSIONER CARTMAN
You broke the rules!
CARTMAN BRADY
Fuck you, "I broke the rules"! YOU're breaking the rules!
COMMISSIONER CARTMAN
Fuck you, you broke the rules!
CARTMAN BRADY
You broke the rules, how you found out I broke the rules!
COACH CARTMAN
Yeah, you broke the rules!
COMMISSIONER CARTMAN
I'm the commissioner! I can break the rules 'cause you guys broke the rules before! I didn't bust you enough!
COACH, BRADY
Just because you didn't bust us enough for breakin' the rules, that doesn't mean you can break the rules bustin' us now!
COMMISSIONER CARTMAN
Fuck both you guys! I can do whatever I want! I'm breakin' the rules!
CARTMAN BRADY
Fuck you, I'm Tom Brady!
COMMISSIONER CARTMAN
Fuck you, I'm the commissioner! I'll make up new rules!
COACH, BRADY
Fuck your rules!
COMMISSIONER CARTMAN
Fuck you guys, always fucking rules!
CARTMAN BRADY
Fuck all the rules! [all this wakes Cartman up]
CARTMAN
Ack! Butters!
BUTTERS
I'm here, Eric.
CARTMAN
Oh Butters, I've lived such a horrible life! Always doing whatever I want and claiming it to be for integrity. BUTTERS?
BUTTERS
Yes Eric.
CARTMAN
I'm never going back to the person I was. I swear to God. From now on the world is going to know a new and better Eric Cartman.
[The Marsh house, day. The doorbell rings and Stan rushes to the door to see who it is. When he opens the door, he sees Kyle with a tree stuck on his back and penises drawn all over his face.]
KYLE
Will you please tell your dad to leave me alone?
STAN
Dude, what happened?
KYLE
[steps inside, tree and all] Your dad was on my lawn yelling at me all night, and after I finally fell asleep I woke up Saran-wrapped to a tree with penises on my face. And this. [removes his hat to reveal his hair gathered into four crude ponytails, one of them covered in a condom. Stan is stunned, but takes it in]
STAN
Hang on. [walks to the kitchen] Dad, did you draw dicks on my friend's face?
RANDY
[back at the kitchen table, with a hangover, like last time] Did I check his privilege? Yes. I had some refreshments and I checked your friend's privilege.
STAN
That's my best friend, Dad! Stop shaming him because you want to fit in!
RANDY
Stan, straight white males in a capitalistic society have little- understanding of victimization compared to injustices against the underprivileged. Dicks on your face is a very first-world problem. [the liquor comes back into his mouth] Oh shit! [vomits as he heads toward the sink]
STAN
[returns] Look, Kyle, maybe you should just say Caitlyn Jenner is a hero.
KYLE
I didn't even say she wasn't a hero! I just said she isn't a hero to me! I didn't like Bruce Jenner as a person when he was on the Kardashians, and I don't suddenly like him now!
A PASSING BRO
Weoo-weoo-weoo-weooh!
STAN
Her.
KYLE
HER, yes!
[Cartman's hospital room. Cartman is on his feet, stumbling]
CARTMAN
OH. Eh, oh it's no use, Butters. I want to get out there and start making positive changes, but I... can barely even walk. [thinks a moment] How is everybody doing?
BUTTERS
Well they're fine. Everyone's just kind of keepin' their mouths shut. It's kinda nice. [smiles] So the PC guys are leavin' people alone. Well, except for...
CARTMAN
Who?
BUTTERS
Well, well now they've made Kyle their main target.
CARTMAN
[soft music plays] ...Kyle? ...My friend Kyle? [begins removing his hospital clothes slowly and replacing them with his own clothes]
BUTTERS
Eric, what are you doing?
CARTMAN
I don't have a choice. I have to take these PC people out.
BUTTERS
Oh, but I thought you agreed with them.
CARTMAN
I do, but I have to help Kyle, even if I don't agree with his hateful, bigoted thoughts. Kyle's view may be warped. I personally think Caitlyn Jenner's a stunning hero, [clears his throat] but that doesn't mean I'll stand by while Kyle's intolerance is dealt with violently. We're going to war with these PC people once and for all! Butters, I'm going to need 200 pregnant Mexican women and some taco launchers.
BUTTERS
Well ohhh-kay!
[Rho Omega Delta house, night. The PC bros have gathered around a door entrance, and begin chanting...]
PC BROS
Social Justice 1 2 3 Woowoo!
I wanna be PC Woowoo!
It's just the way to be for me!
And you!
Woowoo!
Your hateful slurs are through! Woowoo!
PC BRO 9
I call woowoo on you!
PC BROS
Woowoo! We'll fight until you're PC black and blue!
RANDY
Woowoo!
PC BROS
Woowoo!We are language police fighting bigotry!
Hurtful words can suck our turds, 'cause it's PC for me!
PC BRO 5
And you!
PC BROS
Woowoo! Yeah! Yeah! Fuck yeah!
PC BRO 5
Fuck yeah, bro! PC bro! [Cartman is now on the scene, walking with a crutch and a walkie-talkie.]
CARTMAN
All right, send in the pregnant Mexican women! [Butters, with a semaphore flag in each hand, gives the signal for the women to rush the house]
PREGNANT MEXICAN WOMEN
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!
PC BRO 5
Fuck, bro?! [Cartman stops by the taco launchers, which are manned by Clyde, Craig, and Tweek]
CARTMAN
Fire the taco launchers! [the boys load the launchers and let fly. Tacos rain down upon the frat house. The women arrive and run into the house, picking up tacos on the way] Syrian refugee children, flank from the left! [a truck load of Syrian refugee children is waiting for the truck bed to empty out. Butters releases the cargo door and the kids flood out towards the house]
PC BRO 2
Dude, what is this, bro?!
PC BRO 6
I don't know, bro!
CARTMAN
[looking through some binoculars] The Syrian refugee children are in; send in Jared! [Jared appears with his arms stretched out, ready to grab anything. He follows the women and the kids into the frat house, but doesn't grab anyone. The rest of the neighborhood gathers and marches towards the house]
STEPHEN
What in the world is going on??
CARTMAN
All right, good. The pregnant Mexican women are falling asleep on the tacos. [sees Jared on the balcony trying to grab some kids, and some bros stop Jared] Jared needs backup, send in the Chinese drivers. [a split second later two cars crash into each other in front of the house.]
A PC BRO
[falls from the balcony to his death] Ohhh! [lands on his head]
CARTMAN
All right, the Syrian refugees are trying to protect their children! Gimme a- Oh fuck, there's Kyle. [lowers his binoculars] What the fuck are you doing, Kyle?
KYLE
Enough! Stop! Everyone STOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHP! [The camera shows his head bigger than usual and the air brighter then usual. His voice echoes across town and everyone stops in their tracks. A pregnant woman picks up a taco and runs off with it.] This is so wrong! I can't let it continue! This is not ever what I intended! I just want to say... Caitlyn Jenner is a hero. There's no other way to say it. What she did took bravery, and she is absolutely stunning. [Moments later, PC Principal steps forward and begins clapping. Once the clapping reaches normal speed, others begin to join in. A live-action shot of Brett Farve at the ESPYs "limp-clapping" is even thrown in]
TOWNSMAN
Wooo.
[South Park, the dawn of a new day. Everyone gathers in the school cafeteria, which has a sign at the entrance: WELCOME TO 2015 SOUTH PARK. Inside, people are having conversations, kids are running around, Randy's butt is getting branded...]
RANDY
Ow, hot. Hot hot, hothohhht. [PC Bro 4 takes the branding iron off, and Randy is officially a PC Bro. He stands up and gets dressed.] Ahhh.
PC PRINCIPAL
I gotta hand it to you, Marsh. You really checked that little boy's privilege. Using those Syrian refugees was genius, bro.
PC BRO 4
Yeah. I would have never thought to use offensive imagery and outrageous stereotypes to provoke someone to open their eyes.
RANDY
So I'm PC now?
PC PRINCIPAL
You're not only PC, you've actually changed my PC. [whips out some sunglasses] Congrats. Here's your Oakleys.
RANDY
Oh wow. Oakleys! [puts them on and his voice changes] Oh yeah bro, these are sweet. [The big five stand nearby observing the small ceremony]
STAN
So I guess PC Principal is here to stay, huh?
CARTMAN
Yes. But at least we showed him that sometimes joking about un-PC things can actually be important, because it starts a dialogue. [Kyle lowers his eyelids and the others back away] What's wrong, Kyle? You have your cake. Eat it, too.
KYLE
It just seems to me like we all lost in this, and that the only person who won was you.
CARTMAN
Hmmm... And who does that remind you of, Kyle? Now if you don't mind, I'm gonna go home and fuck my hot wife. Who, kind of looks like, a dude. [Cartman hums his own version of the end theme song over the credits.]
End of Stunning and Brave

synopsis:Mr. Garrison wants to build a wall to keep out all of the undocumented immigrants.

script:Where My Country Gone?

[The White House, day. President Obama delivers a speech in the East Room to the press]
PRESIDENT OBAMA
Now, last week we were all reminded that intolerance still exists in our country. It took a very special young student to light up social media, and we've invited him to the White House today to show our appreciation. Because never have there been more tolerant, more moving words than Kyle Broflovski's speech about his hero Caitlyn Jenner. [applause. Kyle is shown with his eyes half-closed - an indication that he doesn't want to be there.] Come on up here, Kyle.
[Crunchy's Micro Brew, during the speech. Mr. Garrison is seated with Richard Adler and Jimbo at a table looking at a TV monitor above the bar.]
MR. GARRISON
You see?? There! This is why it's happening! Everyone's preachin' openness and acceptance, and so now millions of goddamned immigrants are comin' over the border and nobody seems to care!
RICHARD ADLER
Well what are you gonna do? In today's world it's like you can't even say anything negative about illegal immigrants.
RANDY
[Approaching and gesturing like a siren] Weoo weoo weoo weoo weoo! Did somebody over here say "illegal immigrants"? Because the correct term is "undocumented immigrants," alright bro? [leaves]
MR. GARRISON
[hushed] It's like nobody cares! And they just keep comin'. Crossin' the border with their dirty families, playin' their stupid music! [looks to his left] I mean, look at 'em! I'll bet not ONE of them is here legally! [a group of Canadians is playing pool.]
CANADIAN 1
Alright guy!
CANADIAN 2
Hey buddih!
CANADIAN 3
Hey buddih!
CANADIAN 4
[the shooter] Hey, what's going on fwiend!
CANADIAN 5
[Wearing a Canada sweater] Hey, buddih! Another Moosehead, eh?
MR. GARRISON
We should have put up a goddamned wall. [Jimbo and Richard now look at the Canadians as well]
PRESIDENT OBAMA
But wait, there's still more, [the three man now look at the TV] because this country was built on dreamers, and Kyle, we want to make your dreams come true. And so here is your hero, Caitlyn Jenner. [applause as Caitlyn joins Barack and Kyle at the podium. Kyle is taken aback]
CAITLYN JENNER
[with a lisp] I just wanna say thank you Kyle for your beautiful words of support.
PRESIDENT OBAMA
Now Kyle, we've got another little surprise for you. We told you we were flying you back home, but the truth is, you're getting a ride back all the way with your hero! How do you like that?! [Ooohs and applause follow.]
[Caitlyn Jenner's car, outside, moments later. She's ready to take Kyle home, while Kyle looks bewildered.]
CAITLYN JENNER
Buckle up, buckaroo! [Revs up and speeds away. Almost immediately an elderly person crosses her path and she runs her over, thoroughly killing her under her wheels. The press applauds.]
[South Park Elementary, next day. Mr. Garrison enters his classroom along with his students.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay children, let's take our seats. As you've probably noticed, our government has decided to let anyone who wants to, cross the border and screw up our country! [before him is a crowded room, with more desks and lots of new Canadian students.] I know you're all as pissed off as I am, so why don't we begin today's lesson on why the once-great empire of Rome, fell to shit! Huh?! Who can tell my why Rome fell to shit?! [all the Canadian kids raise their hands] No, somebody who matters! [the Canadian students begin to clamor. Garrison puts his left hand over his nose and closes his eyes] Alright, fine, in the orange shirt.
CANADIAN KID 1
[orange shirt] The Roman Empire, buddy, was facing ehh several issues, guy, as they reached the new millennium, friend, and rather-
MR. GARRISON
[irritated] Oh, speak in English! You see, [turns around and begins writing on the board] what happened is that these immigrants called Goths [writes the word and circles and underlines it] were welcomed into Roman territories [writes the word Roman on the board] because some people felt bad for them. [another Canadian boy checks his watch and hops off his seat, opens a small case and pulls out a trumpet] And then the Goths suddenly decided they were being oppressed, you see, and so then- [the boy begins to play a familiar tune, and Mr. Garrison turns around] What the hell are you doing?! [the other Canadian kids get out of their seats and whip out their trumpets to play the song]
CANADIAN KID 2
[in a suit] It's 8am, guy.
MR. GARRISON
[loses his temper, throws his notes and chalk] Well that's it! Why don't you Canucks go back where you came from?! [they stop and look aghast at him]
[The Principal's office, moments later. PC Principal is behind his desk with Mr. Mackey at his right side. PC Principal is barely containing his temper. Mr. Garrison is looking at him defiantly with arms crossed]
PC PRINCIPAL
You really think you can refer to an undocumented immigrant as a "Canuck"?!
MR. GARRSION
PC Principal, they got up in the middle of my lecture and started playing music!
PC PRINCIPAL
So did you forget that at eight and eleven all Canadians face east and play Chuck Mangione? [stands up and puts his hands on the desk] Or did you not care to find out about their religious customs?
MR. GARRSION
Thuh, they don't even speak English!
PC PRINCIPAL
Then you need to be teaching in both languages from now on! Mackey, sign the faculty up for Canadian-language night classes!
MR. GARRSION
What?!
MR. MACKEY
[bowing profusely] Yes, PC Principal! R-right away! M'kay?
PC PRINCIPAL
You're on thin ice, Garrison! Get in line or you'll be out of a job, bro!
[South Park Elementary cafeteria, lunchtime. Cartman, Kenny, Butters, and Tolkien bring lunches from home while Stan, Kyle, Clyde and Craig get school lunches]
STAN
What are they doing now? [several tables have Canadian kids seated and eating. Butters stands up for a better look]
BUTTERS
Well they're all eatin' together and praying. A-and they're puttin' syrup on their Mac & Cheese! [sits back down]
CLYDE
Ugh, so weird!
TOLKIEN
There's just so many of them.
CARTMAN
You guys, I think this whole thing is a conspiracy.
TOLKIEN
Whattaya mean?
CARTMAN
Think about what happened: American has pretty secure border for years. Kyle gives a big speech about tolerance and acceptance that goes viral. A bunch of Canadians cross the border illegally. Kyle's brother is Canadian. What if Kyle knowingly gave that speech to get all the illegals in?
KYLE
[annoyed] I'm sitting right here.
CARTMAN
And he's sitting right here.
KYLE
You really think just my speech brought on a wave of illegal immigration?!
STAN
You did kind of go overboard, dude.
KYLE
[looks at Stan, betrayed] What?!
STAN
It's just... I know you like giving speeches and stuff, but not everything is black and white.
CLYDE
Yeah, I mean, it's fine you wanna go preach about Caitlyn Jenner, but you can't just make blanket statements about letting anyone do whatever they want.
KYLE
I didn't even want to give that speech!
CARTMAN
[interrupting] Yeah, yeah, this is interesting. Have you guys read Genesis Thirty-four?
BUTTERS
Uhn-un.
CARTMAN
Well, it's intriguing, because in Genesis Thirty-four, the Jews actually did something similar to what Kyle is doing now.
KYLE
Uh I'm not responsible for this! Illegal immigration has been happening forever.
CARTMAN
But it's happening a lot more now. After you decide to give a big speech about Caitlyn Jenner. Because you want to bring down the cultural fabric of America. 'Cause you're a Jew.
KYLE
You guys, immigrants, either legal or illegal, are always gonna find ways to cross into richer countries if they're not living-
STAN
[briefly puts his left hand over his nose] Oh boy, here we go again. [the other boys leave as well]
CARTMAN
Yeah, I'm out.
BUTTERS
Yeah, sorry. I can't listen to another one either. [Kyle is left alone, bewildered]
[South Park Elementary, a different classroom, evening. There are watermarks everywhere, so this room hasn't been used for a while]
MR. STKRDKNMIBALZ
Happy evening, friends. My name is Mr. Stkrdknmibalz, (stick-yer-dick-in-my-balls) and we are going to learn Canadian. [Garrison shifts in his seat] With a lot of practice, you're going to find that speaking Canadian isn't so difficult. And in fact, our alphabet and yours are fairly similar. So why don't we begin singing it together? [Clears his throat]
A B C D E F Guy
H I J K L M N O Buddih
Q R S T U Fwiend
W X Eh! And [farts]
These are Canadian ABCs
Susie likes hairy balls. Whattaya think of these?
Alright, now everyone!
CLASS
[begins singing]
A B C D E F Guy
H I J K L M N O Buddih
Q R S T U Fwiend
W X Eh And
[Mr. Garrison begins to daydream]
[Montage: Mr. Garrison on a bridge overlooking a river. he sees several Canadians enjoying themselves in inner tubes in the river. He sighs and walks away. Next, he's in line to get into the DMV during the day, but the line is full of Canadians. Next, new STOP signs go up that now have BUDDY under the STOP. Mr. Garrison is at the intersection waiting for the green light. A truck pulls up with a bunch of kids in the truck bed, no seat belts. Next, he's at the old town bar singing on a corner stage and playing a guitar. The regulars hold up their fists in solidarity. Next, he passes by a food cart. The cook there is selling beaver tails for five dollars. Then he passes by a newly-sold house with a Canadian couple cheering their purchase. Then he's back at the bar, with more listeners holding up lighters in solidarity. Next, he looks out his window and finds a bunch of supporters on his lawn pleading for him to lead them. Next, he walks by some Canadian kids playing street hockey, then he passes by the school]
MR. GARRISON
Where has my country gone?
Where has my country gone?
It was a land of opportunity that we held dear
But now all these other assholes are comin' here.
And where's my country gone?
It was just here like, two seconds ago.
'Cause when they said that this was the land of the free
I'm pretty sure that they were referring to me
And my country's gone!
It got upset and now it's wandered away
It took 43 Presidents to make us stand tall
And just one black guy to unravel it all
Country gone!
Please tell it that we need her back home.
There's a great big hole in the liberty bucket
'Cause someone forgot to tell the foreigners to suck it!
And now they're all hanging out on my lawn... [trumpets come up and play "Feels So Good"]
And now they're ruining my song
Makin' it sound like Chuck Mangione [trumpets fade out]
Where has my country gone?
[Montage ends, and the camera settles on Mr. Garrison leading a rally at the town square, with his supporters around him.]
MR. GARRISON
Seems like everyone's afraid to speak the truth around here! Well I'm throwin' my hat in and sayin' I'll figure this thing out! Now I might not understand politics, or immigration policies, or... the law. Or basic... ideological... concepts. But dammit I understand there there's a bunch of Canadians here and I'm gonna do somethin' about it! [applause and cheers]
[South Park Elementary gymnasium. PC Principal has called the student body in and put the Canadians on the basketball court and the Americans on the bleachers. The Canadian kids are standing in two lines. The front line wear different costumes that represent different time periods and icons in Canadian history, including the First Settlers of Canada, foreign explorers, a Mountie and a Canadian soldier. The second line consists of a band and choir.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright everyone, listen up. In order for better understanding we've asked students of Canadian origin to introduce you to their culture and [spots a disturbance in the stands] HEY LESLIE! SHUT YOUR FUCKIN' MOUTH! [Leslie stops whispering into her friend's ear and looks at PC Principal] - to introduce you to their culture and customs. So let's give them our undivided attention as they take us on a whirlwind journey through their diverse history.
THREE STUDENTS DRESSED IN NATIVE AMERICAN GARB
We are the Hopewell and Abenaki, first settlers of Canadian soil--
KINDERGARTNER
Guy.
FIVE STUDENTS DRESSED IN EUROPEAN CLOTHING
We are French and British explorers, seeking furs and goods. [Mr. Garrison walks up and takes the mic]
MR. GARRISON
Yeah, and I'm Dan Rather, and I got news for you! Nobody wants you here! [the gym is silent] Sorry not sorry! It's time for someone to say it like it is, and make our country great again!
PC PRINCIPAL
Garrison, what do you think you're-?
MR. GARRISON
And I'm also not afraid to stand up to PC Principal! You, sir, have a pizza face and you suck your mom's dick!
PC PRINCIPAL
That's it Garrison! You are fired from South Park Elementary!
MR. GARRISON
Oh, see? And now I'm fired! That's the cold, hard truth of immigration! Well there's only one immigration policy that I believe in, and that's fuck 'em all to death! [the students gasp] I'm just sayin' what everyone's thinkin' here kids!, Sorry not sorry![The school hallway, moments later. The Canadian kids walk out of school in anger]
STAN
Dude, the Canadians are pissed off.
TOLKIEN
Can you really blame them?
BUTTERS
What made Mr. Garrison do that?
CARTMAN
Guys, what if this was all exactly what Kyle planned? Get the Canadians here, make them feel persecuted, and then what? Uprisings? Rebellion? Next thing you know, they're sending us to camps and using us as livestock!
BUTTERS
You really think Kyle would do that?
STAN
That doesn't matter. We have to think of a way to smooth this over, fast.
CARTMAN
Yeah, we're gonna need a symbolic union.
TOLKIEN
A what?
CARTMAN
You know, what's that story about the two sides that were fighting and, then a guy from one side got with a girl from the other side and their love sort of brought the groups together?
BUTTERS
Lion King II?
CARTMAN
[snaps his fingers and points to Butters] Yes, Lion King II. I mean, if we can get one of us to go out with one of them - probably, have sex - then it could be a symbol of us all getting along.
CRAIG
Yeah, it's kind of like when the princess of one country marries the prince of another.
KYLE
Oh, come on, this is stupid. You guys, when two groups of people don't understand each other you can't just try and diffuse the tension with a little-
CARTMAN
Is he seriously? Is he seriously giving a speech right now? [all quiet] Is he SERIOUSLY giving a speech right now?! [the other boys look back at Kyle angrily, and Kyle is left speechless] This is gonna have to happen pretty fast, so whoever's gonna do it needs to ask a Canadian girl out soon. 1 2 3 Not it.
STAN, CRAIG, KENNY, CLYDE, TOLKIEN
[one after the other] Not it!
BUTTERS
No, no. Not it! Oh. OH SHIT!
[CNN report.]
ANCHOR TOM
Support is growing for a Colorado man who claims the way to deal with illegal immigrants is to fuck them all to death. We go live to Minnesota.
[Niagara Falls, Minnesota, day. Mr. Garrison goes around greeting supporters and waving to them or the camera]
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, the political activist is going around the country to get support for his agenda, and- Uh Mr. Garrison, you believe the immigration problem is easy to solve?
MR. GARRISON
Yes. Fuck them all to death. Let'a make this country great again. [cheers swell from his supporters]
FIELD REPORTER
And when you say "Fuck them all to death," what are you actually suggesting be done?
MR. GARRISON
I'm suggesting we round them all up, pull down their pants, and fuck them until their spirits leave their bodies!
SUPPORTER 1
[wearing a Snap Right Tools cap] USA!
MR. GARRISON
And then, after we've fucked every last one of 'em to death, we build a big wall! And if anyone comes over the wall, we fuck them to death too! And then we fuck to death all the-
TOM
Uh Dan? Dan? We're getting word that a wall has already been built. [to the control booth] Is that right? Yes? Yeah- CNN is confirming that Canada has built a wall to keep us out.
MR. GARRISON
What do you mean they built a wall?! They can't build a fucking wall! Oh, fuck them to death!
[Moments later, Garrison and his supporters rush to the border in their cars, where they are met with a very tall wall. A lone guard sits atop the 40-foot wall, and the Americans get out of their cars]
GUARD
Hey there! Beautiful day, isn't it?
MR. GARRISON
What the hell is this?!
GUARD
Oh this? This is a wall. Sorry buddih, nobody allowed in.
JIMBO
Can they do that?
MR. GARRISON
Look, we came to speak with your government about that
GUARD
Yeah, no, sorry! Everything past here is ours. You can't, you can't go past, past here.
MR. GARRISON
We're Americans! We don't even want to be over there! What do you think we're gonna do?
GUARD
Well, you know, we just don't want you ... raping our women and stuff.
SUPPORTER 2
That is ridiculous! [crosses his arms]
MR. GARRISON
All right, smartass! That's just about enough-
GUARD
Look, there's just some really cool shit back here and we don't feel like sharing it.
MR. GARRISON
[suddenly curious] Cool shit like what?
GUARD
Don't worry aboot it.
MR. GARRISON
No! What's back there? Let me see!
JIMBO
[pulling him back] It's all right, Garrison.
MR. GARRISON
No! Goddammit, let me see!
[South Park Elementary playground, day. The Americans and Canadians have separated into their own cliques. Cartman and Butters stand between the groups checking out the Canadian girls. Butters is still pissed that he lost]
CARTMAN
What about that one? In the glasses? She's kinda hot.
BUTTERS
She's not hot! She looks like a messed-up cucumber with wieners on it!
CARTMAN
All right, how about the lanky one, there? Ooo, ooo, What about the one in the hat? She kind of looks like Alanis Morissette, huh?
BUTTERS
Alanis Morissette is like 80 years old or something! [stomps his right foot down on the snow] Jeez!
CARTMAN
Okay, Bu-Butters, relax.
BUTTERS
Well I don't want a Canadian girlfriend, Eric!
CARTMAN
Okay. Do you just want a race war?
BUTTERS
No! The one in the white shoes isn't that ugly.
CARTMAN
Okay, go fuck the one in the white shoes.
BUTTERS
Okay! [walks over to the bench with the girl in white shoes next to it] Hi, my name's Butters, what's yours.
CHARLOTTE
I'm Charlotte. [her friends giggle]
BUTTERS
Oh Charlotte, I've never done this before. You think Scar's up there? He wasn't my father, but he's still part of me. Oh no, Simba, we have barely begun. We'll run away together and ... and...?
CARTMAN
[satisfied with the way Butters interaction is playing out. To himself] And start a pride all of our own.
[CNN Report, at the Canadian border. Dan, the field reporter, is updating]
DAN
Tom, the scene at the Canadian border is electric as several political leaders try and strategize how to deal with being shut out of Canada. [in the background three podiums appear on the road right in front of the wall. Garrison and two other leaders step up to the mics.]
MALE POLITICIAN
If the Canadian government wants to put up a wall, they have every right.
FEMALE POLITICIAN
And yet, we must ask why they thought this to be necessary.
MR. GARRISON
No, fuck them and fuck you! [points at the female politician] I wanna see if they have really cool shit back there!
FEMALE POLITICIAN
What we need is a-
MR. GARRISON
No! [points at the female politician] You've got a gaping gash [points at the male politician] and you've got vinegary balls! The Canadians can't do this! Don't they realize that hundreds of thousands of their people are over here illegally?
GUARD
Oh, you guys didn't put up a wall?
MR. GARRISON
And you keep your goddamned mouth shut, smart-ass! I'll deal with you! [cheers and applause from his supporters. He turns to face them.] I get things done, and I'm gettin' back there! [more cheers and applause]
[An outdoor mall in South Park. Butters returns with some ice cream for himself and Charlotte.]
BUTTERS
Here you go.
CHARLOTTE
Thanks, Butters. I'm sore-y I didn't know what ice cream was.
BUTTERS
What's "sore-y"?
CHARLOTTE
Well that's what Canadians say to express remorse.
BUTTERS
Oh. Heh, he-hey, heh that's neato. [his cell phone rings] Oh. Eh, hang on Charlotte, one sec. [walks off a bit and picks up] What do you want?!
CARTMAN
Have you given her the old Hot Cosby yet?
BUTTERS
No, we saw a movie and now we're goin' to the park.
CARTMAN
Butters, we don't have time for that! I told you you have to cut to the chase with a Hot Cosby!
BUTTERS
If I'm gonna be with this girl, I don't want her someday thinking it was all super-rushed!
CARTMAN
Nobody cares about forty years from now when she suddenly changes her mind, Butters! Time is of the essence! We're all gonna die! [hangs up. Butters returns to Charlotte]
CHARLOTTE
Everything all right?
BUTTERS
Yeah, just some work-related stuff.
CHARLOTTE
So hey, I wanted to see if you wanted to come over to my house for dinner tomorrow.
BUTTERS
[getting nervous] Oh boy, yes I'd love to, here we go, oh God.
[Niagara Falls National Park. The camera looks at the falls and then pans to the left to show Mr. Garrison being lowered into a barrel by Jimbo and Ned.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay that's, that's good. Watch the balls. Okay, all right, give me the helmet. [Jimbo reaches down and hands the helmet to Mr. Garrison] We'll see what they've got behind that goddamned wall! [turns around to face his supporters] You know what I am, friends? I'm a doer.
SUPPORTERS
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
MR. GARRISON
Canada says we can't go into their country, I'm going into their country! And when I do, I am fucking every last Canadian... so hard! [cheers and applause] All right, let's do this! [drops down into the barrel. Jimbo and Ned seal it up. Several supporters lift the barrel up over their shoulders and carry it to the railing]
SUPPORTERS
USA USA USA USA USA! [they throw it into the river and watch it approach the falls] USA USA USA! [the barrel goes over the falls and breaks up a few seconds later. Jimbo screams] USA US-!
JIMBO
Aww, he's dead.
[Charlotte's house, evening. Butters is her guest for dinner. She has a grandmother living with her, as well as a brother and sister]
DAD
So young man, I understand that you and my daughter have started a romance.
BUTTERS
Well uh, well yes, sir.
DAD
And I suppose you have a thing for Canadian girls, huh? Is that it? You've got maple fever?
CHARLOTTE
Ey, daddy!
DAD
I'm sore-y, Charlotte, but I get suspicious. It's bad enough we have to live in America, now all the boys with maple fever are gonna wanna have at our daughter.
MOM
That's enough, Thomas!
BUTTERS
W-wait, you don't wanna be here?
CHARLOTTE
Why would we want to be here?
BUTTERS
Wuh well, you know, 'cause everything is great here, and we have cool stuff.
THOMAS
Canada has everything. It's the greatest country on Earth.
BUTTERS
But- so- then, why did you leave?
THOMAS
[sighs and gets up from the his chair, and walks over to a window] There were several candidates during the Canadian elections. One of them was this brash asshole who just spoke his mind. He didn't really offer any solutions, he just said outrageous things. we... thought it was funny. [the mom begins to cry quietly, and her son comforts her] Nobody really thought he'd ever be President. It was a joke! But we just let the joke go on for too long. He kept gaining momentum, and by the time we were all ready to say "Okay, let's get serious now. Who should really be President?" he was already being sworn into office. [turns around] We weren't paying attention. [collapses and begins to cry, bumping into the table against the window] We weren't paying attention! [lets out all his tears and the family gathers around him to comfort him.]
BUTTERS
Jeez, how bad can a president be?
[Back in Canada, the new President, a middle-age man resembling a likeness to Donald Trump, sits at his desk.]
MR. PRESIDENT
If certain people want to leave this country, then let them! You tell those pussy homos they can suck my balls!
JOHNSON
But Mr. President-
MR. PRESIDENT
And tell the Prime Minister of China that HE can suck my balls! Oh, and Johnson?
JOHNSON
Mr. President?
MR. PRESIDENT
Suck my balls.
[Charlotte's backyard, after dinner. The yard is more like a garden, with flowers everywhere, swaying gently in the breeze. She and Butters are on a bench swing holding hands]
CHARLOTTE
I'm sore-y about my papa. He can be really emotional sometimes.
BUTTERS
You don't got to be sore-y. It's me who should be sore-y. I think everyone has the wrong idea about your people, Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE
It's okay. We just have to give them time.
BUTTERS
I wasn't supposed to have time. I was supposed to give you a Hot Cosby, so our species could coexist. But now I realize you guys don't even wanna be here.
CHARLOTTE
Oh.. so do you want to be here? Now?
BUTTERS
There's really nowhere I'd rather be. [smiles] If it's okay with you, well I'd like to try a nice Slow Cosby instead.
CHARLOTTE
In Canada, we call a Slow Cosby ... love. [kisses Butters on the cheek. Butters strokes it and smiles again] Oh look! [a meteorite zooms across the sky] A shooting star! In Canada, we say that's... good luck.
BUTTERS
So do we.
[A concrete channel with a slow-moving river running through it on the Canadian side of the border. Mr. Garrison comes to, groans, and slowly gets up. He leaves the channel and finds himself looking at an abandoned Canadian city.]
MR. GARRISON
Hello? [his voice echoes through the canyon of high-rises in the city. He walks by an empty coffee shop with a loose door banging in the wind. He hears a man sobbing, but sees abandoned cars, paper strewn everywhere, trash... he finds the man sitting on the roof of a 13-story law office building]
MAN
Oh God! Oh God!
MR. GARRISON
Hey! Where is everyone, guy? [the man sobs some more and then stands and jumps to his death.] Jeez.
[Montage. As "Safety Dance" plays, Mr. Garrison walks through an empty mall and notices an escher-esque assortment of escalators there. Mr. President is dancing away. Mr. Garrison sees the activity and walks over, not sure what to make of it all. Mr. President notices him and stops]
MR. PRESIDENT
What?! Hey! How did a US citizen get past my wall?!
MR. GARRISON
I came here to find out where my country gone!
MR. PRESIDENT
Where your country gone? Where my country gone?!
MR. GARRISON
No, where my country gone, bitch?!
MR. PRESIDENT
Nobody talks to me like that, buddih! [goes around his desk]
MR. GARRISON
Nobody talks to me like that, fwiend! [they begin to fight on the carpet. Mr. Garrison takes the President down and wrestles with him until the President is face down] Eurgh! Yeah?
MR. PRESIDENT
Stupid-! Unh!
MR. GARRISON
Little asshole!
MR. PRESIDENT
This is why I built that wall!
MR. GARRISON
You think you can-? [grabs the back of the President's head and slams it down] Hey! Here you go! Here you go! [keeps beating the President down] Look, guy, I came here to do one thing! [takes off his own swim suit and begins raping the President]
MR. PRESIDENT
Hey, what the-? Aah! Hey, that pokes, buddih! Aah!
AIDE
Oh my God, guy.
MR. PRESIDENT
Please! Please, I can't- Oh. NO! No please, NO! NO! [Garrison inhales some poppers, then resumes the raping with increased vigor] Ohhh! Ohhh! Nooo!
[Charlotte's house, the dining table. Butters and Charlotte share a tall milk shake. Thomas and his wife look on from the doorway, holding hands]
MOM
Oh look at them, Thomas. I think they really like each other.
THOMAS
Yes, I have to admit. It seems they're falling in Slow Cosby. [someone knocks on the front door] I'll get it. [goes to the front door and opens it]
CANADIAN 6
Hey, did you hear the news, buddih? The Canadian Presidents been fucked to death!
CANADIAN 7
[across the street] Yes! Yes!
THOMAS
What? Are you sure?
MOM
What is it, Thomas?
THOMAS
The Canadian President got fucked to death, darling.
MOM
Oh my goodness! Should we go back to Canada then?
THOMAS
Yes, I guess let's go back! [and so the Canadians start packing up and moving out. The Marshes stand outside their house looking at the exodus]
CANADIANS
See ya! Bye! It's been real, guy! See ya, guy! [once they're all gone, Butters appears on the road chasing after Charlotte]
BUTTERS
Charlotte!
CHARLOTTE
I'll Skype you when I'm home, my love! [soon she's too far away]
BUTTERS
Ah, I should have done the Hot Cosby.
[South Park town square. Mr. Garrison is back on stage, his supporters cheering and applauding him again]
SUPPORTER 3
[voice only] You did it, Garrison!
SUPPORTER 4
[voice only] Thank you, Garrison!
MR. GARRISON
Friends. I think I've proven that my policies work to get things done. I know what my true calling is, and I'm gonna keep this goin' all the way to Washington.
KYLE
[gets up on stage to clear his name] Hold on, wait! It wasn't me! I wasn't the one who brought the Canadians here! It was something just like this. Don't you see? If there's anything we've learned, it's that we have to stop this kind of sensationalist politics before the same thing happens to us, because if we let this kind of... [stops himself] this... kind of... [the crowd looks at him, annoyed]
CARTMAN
Dude!
STAN
Unbelievable! [Kyle turns left and walks off stage]
MR. GARRISON
All right, my friends. I have to say goodbye now, because I'm off to Washington with my running mate! [the camera shows whom the running mate is as Garrison gets into the passenger seat]
CAITLYN JENNER
Buckle up, buckaroo! [Revs up and speeds away. Almost immediately a young woman crosses her path and she runs her over, thoroughly killing her under her wheels. The crowd cheers and applauds.]
End of Where My Country Gone?

synopsis:The town of South Park is gentrifying and Kenny thinks it's time to get a job.

script:The City Part of Town

[The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. Fallon is going into his monologue]
JIMMY FALLON
Okay okay okay. So this guy is running for President and he hates immigrants, and he's basically an idiot. [the audience laughs throughout] Not surprisingly, this guy is from a predominantly white town called South Park, Colorado. Or Shit-heads of America, Incorporated, I'm not sure. Yeah, if this guy is the best their town has to offer, can you imagine who he left behind? [affecting a hick accent] "Oh hey, I'm from South Park! We don't take kindly to respecting human beings!" [a shot of Randy and Sharon watching from the sofa with their jaws dropped] You, you think South Park has a university? "Welcome to South Park University." [a shot of Gerald and Sheila in bed, watching with jaws dropped] "Please open your shotguns and slap your wives!" [a shot of Butters watching the show on the phone, in bed. He's crying quietly] "I live in South Park and my IQ's so low I've got's ta dig for it. Hey, did someone say 'rape?' That's the word for 'clever' here in South Park" [the camera is back on Randy and Sharon]
RANDY
[turns off the TV] That's not funny. [gets up and walks away.]
[South Park Elementary, day. Kids are walking around in the hallway. Stan goes to his locker as Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman stand in front of the lockers on the other side of the hallway, their heads hanging in shame. Butters joins them, also ashamed, and Stan closes his locker to join them all.]
STAN
So not cool. How does someone just rip on us like that?
KYLE
I can't believe Jimmy Fallon hates us. Jimmy Fallon loves everything. Why would he slam our whole town?
CARTMAN
Because apparently he doesn't care that his jokes are at the expense of actual people.
BUTTERS
Well do you think it's true? Do you think we're really bigoted country bumpkins?
CARTMAN
No. [steps forward] Hey, we are not bumpkins! Okay?! Kenny's a bumpkin!
KENNY
(Well fuck you, dude!)
CARTMAN
We don't have junk cars in our yards, that's just your family, Kenny! [Kyle is about to defend Kenny, but Stan speaks up]
STAN
I just hope somebody finds a way to fix this.
[South Park City Hall, day, the Mayor's office.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
I've called you all here because South Park has an image problem. Thanks to Mr. Garrison we are now being referred to as the shit-heads of America. One of our more politically sensitive citizens has proposed an idea for this crisis and I'd like you to hear him out.
RANDY
[takes the dais as the Mayor steps aside] Hello everyone, I'm Randy Marsh, and I've been PC for almost two weeks now. You know, we've all been making changes to be more socially conscious, but have we really done enough? The truth is, there's something we're lacking as a community, and it's time we all faced it. What this town needs... is a Whole Foods. [a lot of chatter springs up in the audience.] It would instantly validate us as a town that cares about stuff.
STEPHEN
We couldn't get a Whole Foods to open here.
RANDY
And why not?! Huh?! We all just don't believe we could get a Whole Foods! Because we don't believe in ourselves!
FR. MAXI
Where could it even go?!
RANDY
Mayor?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
I'm announcing a plan for SoDoSoPa. [presses a remote control and a picture of the logo comes up.] A new urban development that will turn the most rundown and dilapidated part of our town into a quaint center of artisan shops and cafes.
RANDY
Lots of cities are dong this. The area south of Downtown South Park has always been the ugly eyesore of this town. But now, SoDoSoPa... is going to bring in the fresh new vibrancy that Whole Foods can't ignore.
[The SodoSoPa site, later. An architect is there with a select group of people, including the Mayor, Johnson, Wendy's mom, Randy, Linda, and three others]
ARCHITECT
We'll keep the existing structures, but add brick walkways and some quaint white lights. A plaza in the middle will be a place where young couples can play with their toddlers. [a shot of the site, which is Kenny's house, which has warped windows and broken stucco all around. Kenny hears the conversation and peeks out the front window] And it will all be small businesses like artisan cheese shops or noodle houses.
RANDY
Oh, this is really exciting. I thought this area was just gonna stay shitty forever. [Kenny walks to the kitchen, where he sees Stuart drinking a beer and reading a magazine.]
KENNY
(Hey Dad, there's these fucking people outside.)
STUART
Who is? [gets up and walks to the front door, opens it and sees the group]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
So you think you'll keep all the existing structures?
ARCHITECT
I do. It's part of what gives a revitalized area like this its charm that the hipsters like.
STUART
Hey, what are you people doing?!
RANDY
We're gentrifying. It's all good.
[Park County Community Center, day. Another meeting about this project.]
RANDY
Okay, hold on, everyone listen up! We understand that not everyone is for the town spending money on the SoDoSoPa project. We want everyone to be able to voice their concerns. [Only the McCormicks are present]
STUART
[stands up] Yeah I got concerns! I don't want you touching my damn house!
JOHNSON
We realize that when a rejuvenation like this takes place, the lower-income residents fear they'll be priced out of the area.
STUART
What lower-income residents?! Me?! I work hard and provide for my family just fine!
RANDY
Stuart, come on. Your house sucks.
STUART
Fuck you! If you people wanna turn somethin' into a vibrant arts district, then do it to Randy's house!
RANDY
My house is nice.
AIDE
Mr. McCormick, you will be living in the most vibrant part of the entire town. SoDoSoPa is the future of South Park.
JOHNSON
There will be amazing food and incredible shops right at your doorstep.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
And we want to assure the lower-income families that we are going to take the time to do this right.
[The SodoSoPa project is now complete, and a new eatery is shown. The Broflovskis and the Stotches are having dinner together]
WAITER
Alright guys, welcome to Steed. Do we have any allergies?
STEPHEN
No, nothing. And we we wanna try everything! [Det. Harris and Officer Barbrady are dining at another table]
DET. HARRIS
Wow, can you believe this place?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Yeah, the food is unbelievable. [Randy and Nelson are at the bar]
RANDY
It's like a dream come true, Nelson. This area is gonna put our town on the map. [the camera pulls back and Steed is shown on the second floor of a mall that has been built on the McCormick house. A narrow entrance between the house and the garage leads to a patio where the backyard used to be, and there are more shops beyond that. Stuart steps outside and dumps his garbage in an aluminum trash can]
[City Wok, night. It's empty, and Tuong Lu Kim reflects on the changes in his business. He's smoking and holds a cup in his left hand while ambient Oriental music plays]
TUONG LU KIM
I don't know what happen all my customers. I used to have a-people come in here, fill every table. Now it's like a-nobody want anything to do with my authentic shitty food. This town is changing so fast, you know? [a lone man sits by the window eating dinner. There are no other customers] This town is changing so fast, everybody wan be PC, be updated. It's like I'm a reric. A rost reric from another time. You know? I dunno, sometime I feel like I outstayed my welcome. Is just how I feel, you know?
DINER
Uh huh.
TUONG LU KIM
It's like a-my accent make people uncomftable or something. How a Chinese man is supposed to survive in this world? [the door opens] Oh, welcome oh Shitty Wok, a take ur order prease?
MAN
[turns left and walks up to the diner] Hey Mike, whatcha doin' man? The guys are all meetin' down at SoDoSoPa.
MIKE
At what?
MAN
They've totally revitalized this area south of Downtown, you've gotta check it out! [turns and walks out]
MIKE
Oh sweet, dude. [gets up and follows his friend out the door]
TUONG LU KIM
SoDoSoPa? What the hell is a SoDoSoPa?
[SodoSoPa, moments later. Tuong Lu Kim arrives to see the place for himself]
TUONG LU KIM
What the fuuuck!
[SodoSoPa, Kenny's house. All the family is in the living room, bored as the music thumps away around them]
KAREN
Mommy, can we go eat outside?
CAROL
No, we can't go eat outside.
KAREN
But Mommy, they have ice cream. [points outside]
STUART
We can't afford $10 ice cream, alright?! If you want nice things, then go out and get a JOB! Except you won't make MONEY! [Karen gets off the sofa with her head down and goes to her room] Because you just BUST your ASS and then barely get by while everyone around you gets RICHER! [Kenny glares at his dad, then gets up and follows Karen] Just face it: things are never gonna change around here.
[The Mayor's office, next day. The mayor and a bunch of townsfolk are waiting on Randy, who's at the desk about to place a call]
JOHNSON
What's he gonna say?
FR. MAXI
Maybe they won't even answ- [the Mayor shushes them both as Randy waits for a pickup]
RANDY
Hi, um, yes, my name is Randy Marsh, and um, we would like to try and get a Whole Foods in our town? ... Yes, that's right. Aaah, yes, it's ah, South Park, Colorado. Nonononono! Nononononono! [continues this for some time] It's not at all what you think! Yes, it's where the Presidential candidate is from-Nonononono! Nononononono! Hold on! Hold on, hold on! SoDoSoPa! SoDoSoPa! We have a SoDoSoPa and the town is completely different! SoDoSoPa! We have an arts and entertainment district! Cultural! Yes. Okay. Okay, yes, I, I understand. Thank you. [hangs up and gathers his thoughts] They said they maybe might send over a representative. [a moment later everyone cheers. Randy hugs the Mayor.]
[First commercial, montage of live-action scenes]
VOICE
[Deep] There's a certain quality, vibe, and energy that is SoDoSoPa. From the independent merchants and unique cafes to the rustic charm of a mixed-income crowd. [the camera pans to Kenny and Stuart, who are annoyed. A couple is dancing at Savor the Goodness as Kevin and Karen look on through a window. Their mom comes up and pulls the blinds down, then back to live action] Where else can you let loose your wild side while still being a part of helping the local economy? [a shot of the whole family looking out at the diners. The parents are mad] And now, a chance to own a piece of this most exciting area of South Park. Announcing: the Lofts at SoDoSoPa. Two thousand square foot of flats that will put you right in the heart of it all. After a night out eating and shopping in SoDoSoPa, just take a few steps and you're home. With modern styling these lofts are sleek, sexy, and oh so SoDoSoPa. And for those very privileged few, the most private and exclusive ownership opportunity is here. Announcing the Residences at the Lofts at SoDoSoPa. Now you can have access to luxury refined while still just steps away from the action. These finely appointed residences all feature state-of-the art finishes and balconies with views of historic Kenny's house. It's a place to laugh. It's a place to gather. A place to mingle with people of all economic classes. And now, it's a place to live. SoDoSoPa. Welcome Home.
[South Park, day. Kenny walks down a sidewalk and notices a sign asking for help - child help. He takes it from the window and enter City Wok with it]
TUONG LU KIM
And we are going to take a-business back from a-SoDoSoPa! [notices Kenny with the sign] Ah, hello, you here for job? Prease join the others prease. [he already has a crew of seven kids. Kenny joins the crew] Some say I cannot survive in today's world. But if there's one asset that a Chinese man has, it's the tactical use of a child rabor. And together, child rabor force, we are gong to bring a SoDoSoPa to its knees.
[Morning in South Park. New signs are being put up to replace aging ones in Downtown, walls are being painted, flowers bought. Tom is cleaning the windows at his rhinoplasty office, and the town gathers in front of Tom's Rhinoplasty. Bleachers are in place, and the kids take up seats in them]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
This is it, people! This is what we've all been working for! The future of our town depends on us being on our best behavior! No swearing, no weirdness, and no speeches! [everyone looks at Kyle, who motions as if to say something]
JOHNSON
He's coming!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Go! go! Everyone in place! [all the adults gather by Tom's Rhinoplasty]
TOWNSMAN
Oh look! [a female conductor leads the kids in a rendition of "He's Got The Whole World In His Hands" A car pulls up and a Whole Foods Market representative steps out. At this point, the song ends]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[approaches] Hello, sir. On behalf of everyone here in South Park, please let me say we are very excited to be in consideration-
WHOLE FOODS REP
[ignores her] Everyone, please go about your business! I need to see this town in its normal goings on, to see if it is indeed a Whole Foods town.
[City Wok, day. Mr. Kim's child laborers are hard at work cleaning up the restaurant. A girl is up on a ladder cleaning one of the lanterns]
TUONG LU KIM
[comes in from the left side] Okay, rooking good, child rabor force. [claps three times] We gonna make a Shitty Wok an updated and a beautiful. [heads back towards the kitchen and sings]
TUONG LU KIM
[comes in from the left side] Okay, rooking good, child rabor force. [claps three times] We gonna make a Shitty Wok an updated and a beautiful. [heads back towards the kitchen and sings]
Let's go child rabor force, let's go! [returns to the dining area] No no, Dennis, you don't use a too much cleaner on the table. That stuff expensive. Now risten everybody! This is a big day! We gonna take the business back from a-SoDoSoPa! And how we gonna do it, child rabor force?! That's right, by taking pride in our work! With the way this prace is looking, we gonna have people rushing in any second!
MAN 2
[voice only] Okay, everyone go about your business.
TUONG LU KIM
Oh! Here they come!
MAN 3
[voice only] Everyone act normal. No, don't act normal, act good!
TUONG LU KIM
There they go. [runs to the entrance] Wait, wait! [runs outside] Shitty Wok! Take ur order prease?! Take ur- [quiet voice, as no one comes back] Take ur order ... prease? [a different camera angle shows a Red Lobster across the street from City Wok and Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails down the road.]
[South Park Elementary, day. The Mayor gives the Whole Foods representative a tour of the school]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
The previous principal of the school was let go so that someone more progressive could take over.
PC PRINCIPAL
[stands up] Hey bro, I'm the new principal of the school. My name's PC Principal.
WHOLE FOODS REP
P.C. Principal. I like that. So you've just recently moved here?
PC PRINCIPAL
That's right.
WHOLE FOODS REP
And do you believe this town is deserving of a Whole Foods?
PC PRINCIPAL
You know, I think it's changed a lot. I really do. I've seen some real progress. Definitely had some holdouts - people who went kicking and screaming into 2015, but yes, I think they deserve it.
WHOLE FOODS REP
Mmmmm-hm. [turns around] Show me a classroom please.
[Mr. Garrison's former classroom, Fourth Grade, moments later. A new female teacher is giving the class a lesson. she's sitting on a stool and shows the class some pictures from an open book.]
TEACHER
But if Pluto isn't a planet, who can tell me what it is? [the door opens and the Mayor and representative walk in] Oh, hello.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
This is our new fourth-grade teacher. She's very normal and professional.
WHOLE FOODS REP
Please continue as if I am not here.
TEACHER
Okay, so uhh children, anyone wanna tell me what Pluto is classified as? [the Whole Foods Rep walks across the floor towards the windows] Anybody? Okay. [the Whole Foods Rep walks back] Well, Pluto is actually a dwarf planet. [Kyle and Stan look at each other] That means it's neither a planet nor a natural satellite, okay?
WHOLE FOODS REP
[to the Mayor] Is there a reason why the children with disabilities and black child are front and center? ["...like the moon. Who can tell me how big the moon is?"]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Oh no, that's just where they always sit, next to our beloved Craig there, who is a homosexual. [Craig hears this and looks at her angrily. "Is it bigger? Smaller? Anyone wanna take a guess"]
WHOLE FOODS REP
Mmmmm-hm.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Uh, can, can I show you the most exciting part of town?
[SoDoSoPa, day. The place is bustling, as usual. The Mayor and the Whole Foods Rep arrive to have a look]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
This is historic SoDoSoPa. It's our vibrant and charming arts and foods district. [Kenny is shown coming home from school. He opens the door, sees them, goes inside, and slams the door shut]
WHOLE FOODS REP
Hmmm, I enjoy how you've retained the lower-income housing with the updated and quaint urban developments.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
That's really what our town is about. [Randy arrives with Stephen]
RANDY
Oh, hello again. Stephen and I were just heading to SoDoSoPa to enjoy some specialty foods. [the Whole Foods Rep turns around and looks at the vast open area across the street, and begins to survey it. Randy nudges Stephen a few times]
WHOLE FOODS REP
Hmmm. I have seen enough for today. I am weary. Where shall I sleep?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Oh yes, of course, uh...
RANDY
Uh, well, tonight, you're at our Motel 6. But, we'd like to show you the plans for something extremely exciting.
[Second commercial]
VOICE
You can't say "excitement" without saying "SoDoSoPa." The food, the art, the nightlife. With the Lofts and Residences at SoDoSoPa all the action was just a few steps away. But what if you could actually live in the most central location that SoDoSoPa has to offer? Well, now you can. Announcing: the Villas at Kenny's House. The most sought-after address in all of South Park for only the very privileged few. Now you can relax in your state-of-the-art deck spa while taking in views of that mixed SoDoSoPa culture. [a view of the back of Kenny's house. Stuart and Carol are fighting, and the new neighbors can see it]
STUART
Shut your damn mouth, bitch!
CAROL
You shut your mouth or I'll shut-
VOICE
But that's not all. The Villas at Kenny's house will also feature access to a private fitness center, clubhouse, and so much more. Plus a breezeway to the proposed Whole Foods just steps away. [PROPOSED WHOLE FOODS NOT YET CONFIRMED] The Villas at Kenny's House. Welcome Home.
[City Wok, night. Tuong Lu Kim sighs and works the cash register. He counts the day's earnings. Before him is Kenny, the one kid left after the day is done, mopping the floor]
TUONG LU KIM
Hey, that's okay. We close. All the other child labor go home.
KENNY
[stops mopping] (I just wanna make sure I get the floors as clean as I can.)
TUONG LU KIM
I like you, Dennis. You work a real hard. [hands Kenny a dollar] I wish I could give you more. You deserve more. [walks over to a window] But I think I'm gonna have to shut down. Now that a SoDoSoPa open, I'm the shitty part of town. And everyone hates the shitty part of town.
KENNY
(Yeah. I know what you mean.)
TUONG LU KIM
Oh, what do you know about living in the shitty part of town, Dennis?
KENNY
[drops the mop] (Hey, I have an idea.)
TUONG LU KIM
You have idea?
KENNY
(I actually do!)
TUONG LU KIM
Oh! That's the spirit! Let's go child rabor! [clap clap clapclapclap] Let's go child rabor! [they both clap clap clapclapclap]
[A ranch in South Park, day. The the rancher, Mayor, and Whole Foods Rep stand behind a fence]
WHOLE FOODS REP
So these are the cattle that the local shops and restaurants are supplied with.
RANCHER
Uh... these are local cows, yes.
WHOLE FOODS REP
And where does the butchery take place?
RANCHER
Uh, that's right over there. [a ranch hand shoots a cow in the head, killing it on the spot]
WHOLE FOODS REP
And are the bullets made from reclaimed metals?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
I believe they are. Rancher, could you make sure?
FR. MAXI
Randy, Stephen, we've got a big problem! The owner of City Wok has child labor making videos for him!
RICHARD
What??
RANDY
Oh Jesus! We forgot all about that guy!
BOB
[sees the Whole Foods Rep turn around and nudges Randy] Shhh!
FR. MAXI
It's all over the place. He's tryin' to revitalize his rundown neighborhood! [the Mayor follows the rep's gaze]
RANDY
God, why do the economically challenged always have to screw up everything?! [turns around to face the Mayor] We're gonna head back to SoDoSoPa for some curious fusion delights. [turns around and leads the other three men away] Come on, we'll get that asshole!
[Third commercial]
TUONG LU KIM
There's a new and exciting prace where people can gather to shop, experience and grow. This is an all-new food and nightrife district. This, is CtPaTown. Where else but CtPaTown can you get all the shitty hot spots and shitty food that South Park is known for? In the mood for some local seafood? Red Robster has all the freshest from Colorado's many oceans. Or if a handcrafted ale is more your thing, head on down to Skeeter's Bar for local ales like a Coors and a Coors Rite. And then, of course, there's Shitty Wok, South Park's historic Asian fusion randmark, featuring Shitty Chicken and Shitty Sour Soup. The state-of-the-art toiret is designed for men and women [just a regular toilet and bathroom. No urinal] and is a great prace for you to squeeze out all the shitty food you've enjoyed. Now South Park has another neighborhood to mingle and rerax. CtPaTown. Welcome Home.
[City Wok, day. Mr. Kim has all his workers there, waiting for the doors to open]
TUONG LU KIM
Oh boy, get ready child rabor force! Any minute now, we gonna have a-customers up our ass!
TOWNFOLK
Get him! There he is! That son of a bitch! Get him! Stop him!
TUONG LU KIM
Oh boy, here they come! [turns to Kenny] You were right, Dennis! CtPaTown commercial did the trick! [heads back to the counter and turns around] Get ready for customers, child rabor force! [the adults rush in and fan out] Welcome Shitty Wok, take your order PREASE. [Fr. Maxi takes Tuong Lu Kim, Officer Barbrady takes Kenny]
KENNY
(What. The. Fuck?!) [the other adults take the rest of the kids. They all rush out of the restaurant]
RANDY
Alright, take these kids and hide them in the-
KENNY
(Come on, dude, I've gotta make some money!)
RANDY
Ow! You little-! [kicks Kenny down]
GIRL
Get him! [a massive fight breaks out between the adults and the child labor force]
TUONG LU KIM
Fight, child rabor force! Swing to the reft!
WHOLE FOODS REP
[shows up with the Mayor and clears his throat] Ahem, ahem! [all the fighting stops and Mayor McDaniels is dismayed at this bad behavior. The adults put the kids down and smile, the kids stay as they are] I've never seen a town put so much energy into displaying an exaggerated sense of social consciousness. Congratulations, you have your Whole Foods. [the adults cheer and disperse.]
TUONG LU KIM
Wait wait, anybody want a Shitty Chicken?? Anybody?? Take ur order prease??? [jumps a few times in frustration, then sighs] I'm sorry, Dennis. You rearry tried to help. I guess it's over. Come on inside. I'll pay you the child labor wage you deserve.
[Kenny's house at SoDoSoPa. Kenny goes home after work. He goes inside his house and passes by the TV, which is showing Hee Haw. The picture tends to flicker between color and black and white]
STUART
[cynically] Well? Did you make any money?
KENNY
[stops and looks down] (No, I didn't make any money.) [continues to the bedrooms]
STUART
Ha, told ya! That's how it works in this damned country.
[A bedroom. Kenny opens the door and looks in. Karen, who is sharing the room with Kevin, sits up in her bed and looks at Kenny]
KAREN
[whispers as Kenny goes to her bed] What are you doing, Kenny? [Kenny takes off his backpack and opens it, pulling out a blonde Mama Baby doll. He hands it to her and she gasps in anticipation] Wow! This is mine?
KENNY
[pats her knee] (It's yours, Karen.) [closes his backpack and puts it on, then leaves the bedroom. He stops to look at Karen take the doll out of its box]
KAREN
Hi. [Kenny closes the door and goes to his own room. He drops the backpack on the floor and goes straight to bed. Life outside at SoDoSoPa bustles on, with the thumping music.]
[Fourth commercial. City Wok is still here, but something new is next to it. It's the Whole Foods Market, which shows that CtPaTown got the store, not SoDoSoPa. The Stotches approach the store. A worker turns a sign around so that customers know the store is open. The Blacks are inside checking out loaves of bread. Officer Barbrady has purchased some meat at the meat counter. Gerald is walking a dog while Sheila pulls Ike around in a Radio Flyer. Kyle helps out. A young man passes Dr. Mephesto on a bike and waves hi to him. Darryl Weathers passes in front of Liane on his own bike. They wave hello to each other, smiling. Randy carries Stan, who is pointing out something to him]
VOICE
There's a time when a town becomes more than it was. [Someone pours himself some coffee. Butters and Linda look at cakes. Mr. Mackey is chatting with the Mayor] When the people take that bold step into making things better. [a bearded worker glances at the camera. Craig points out some deli meats to him mom] To progress. [a shot of two child workers and their mother] To change. [another child worker and his parents] To not be what you were in the past. [a boy and his parents. Wendy glides by on her skateboard] This is a new place, ready for the next decade. [Sharon and Linda walk out with groceries] Updated, revitalized, [Kenny opens his front door and looks out. SoDoSoPa is abandoned, its signs falling down] and ready to fit in with the most progressive towns in America. [PC Principal lowers his Oakleys a bit and nods at the camera] This... is South Park. [a shot of the Mayor and Randy, with a few families, facing the camera at Whole Foods. Cartman and Kyle are in the background] Welcome Home.
CARTMAN
Are the Mexicans actually staying?
KYLE
Shhhh.
End of The City Part of Town


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Cartman considers himself the top online restaurant reviewer in South Park.

script:You're Not Yelping

[Morning in CtPaTown, renamed Shi Tpa Town. A bright sun rises over City Foods. People mill around all over the area. The Stotches walk past Skeeter's Wine Bar while the Tuckers, without Craig, walk towards Whole Foods. In the parking area in front of the store two old friends greet each other]
GERALD
Mornin' Randy!
RANDY
Mornin' Ger! Just another day in paradise, huh?
GERALD
Yeah. Look at all the new restaurants the Whole Foods has brought in. [turns around and points at the restaurant behind them.] Let's try out that one there. [they walk towards it and reach the entrance. A greeter awaits them]
[(vernacular)]
RANDY
Hi. Two of us. please?
GREETER
Yeah, sorry guys. we got about a thirty minute wait.
GERALD
[switches places with Randy] Oh, uh, scuse me. [whispers into the greeter's ear]
GREETER
Yes, sir, give me a second; I'll have a table right away. [rolls his eyes and walks off]
RANDY
Whoa, what'd you say to him?
GERALD
I just... told him who I am.
RANDY
Who are you?
GERALD
[whips out his phone and shows Randy the Yelp app] I'm a yelp reviewer. I usually keep it on the down-low so they don't kiss my ass too much.
GREETER
[returns and gets two menus] Right over here, sir. [takes them to their seats]
WAITER
Alright guys, welcome to (vernacular)
GERALD
Thanks, uh, did they mention to you that I am a Yelper?
WAITER
Yes, we've been alerted. Sir.
GERALD
Greeeat. Could you have them turn up the lights a little, please? [the waiter goes away]
RANDY
Oh, look at it, Gerald. All the new families moving in. [a new Mexican restaurant - Nueva Familia - is having its grand opening across the street] Our little town is all grown up.
[Nueva Familia, across the street. A family-run restaurant. A boy sweeps up in the kitchen as his mother prepares some tacos on the griddle. His father rushes in.]
MR. RODRIGUEZ
Where's that other taco plate? We need it now.
MRS. RODRIGUEZ
I'm a little overwhelmed.
MR. RODRIGUEZ
I know. But we've put everything into moving here and starting this business, and we have to be impressive. [walks up to the boy and gets down on one knee] David, you must help your mama however you can. We're not going back to that miserable place!
MR. RODRIGUEZ
I don't wanna go back either.
MRS. RODRIGUEZ
Okay, done.
MR. RODRIGUEZ
Great! [rises and goes for the plates] We really have to impress this customer. He's a local food critic. [rushes the plates out to the dining area]
MRS. RODRIGUEZ
Another one?
[The dining area. Cartman is eating away. Before him are three plates. One has two burritos, the second has two tacos and some chips and guacamole, the third has two enchiladas which he hasn't touched yet. Ambient Mexican music plays]
MR. RODRIGUEZ
[rushes to his table with two plates of food] Okay, here you go, amigo! Another taco plate and the taquitos.
CARTMAN
Oh, thank you. And, uh did I mention I am a food critic for Yelp?
MR. RODRIGUEZ
Yes, you mentioned that several times.
CARTMAN
Okay, I just didn't want you caught off-guard. [whips out his phone] I was thinking of giving this place 5 stars.
MR. RODRIGUEZ
Really?
CARTMAN
[wiping his mouth clean with his napkin] Yeah, but I'm kind of teetering on 5 stars or 1 star.
MR. RODRIGUEZ
Ohnono. No 1 star, please. What could we do to-?
CARTMAN
Ah I mean, I could probably be persuaded with some free desserts.
MR. RODRIGUEZ
Let me get that for you.
CARTMAN
Great, and can you turn down the music a bit? [taps his left ear a few times] This pagan shit hurts my ears.
MR. RODRIGUEZ
Of course! [turns around and hurries away. A spritz is heard, and the camera shows David wiping down a table. Cartman notices]
CARTMAN
Oh hey, hey busboy. Busboy busboy, por favor. [snaps his fingers and whistles] Busboy!
DAVÍD
My name is David. (Dah-veed)
CARTMAN
Ehexcuse me?
DAVÍD
I said my name is David. (Dah-veed)
CARTMAN
Uhh, it's actually pronounced "David," okay?
DAVÍD
Well, I'm "David." (Dah-veed)
CARTMAN
It's "David," dude. Look it up.
MR. RODRIGUEZ
[comes out with a flan and a sundae on a plate] What's going on? Do not argue, son. We need him. [walks to Cartman's table and sets the desserts down] Here you are, a few free desserts. [the front door opens and some bells are heard] Ho, excuse me. More customers! [goes away]
MALE FOOD CRITIC
[enters with his wife] Hi, two of us for lunch, please.
MR. RODRIGUEZ
Yes, right away!
MALE FOOD CRITIC
Oh, and uh, I just wanted to mention that my wife and I are Yelp reviewers, so uh, your best table, please.
MR. RODRIGUEZ
Oh Jeez, you guys too, huh? Ho-kay, uhm, I'll get you set up right over here, okay? [takes them past Cartman, who casts a critical eye]
CARTMAN
Mmmhmmm! [The father takes them to a booth near Cartman]
MALE FOOD CRITIC
Hm, this place seems, nice.
FEMALE FOOD CRITIC
I guess we'll see.
MALE FOOD CRITIC
D'I guess we'll see, won't we?
CARTMAN
Oh God, now everyone thinks they're a food critic.
[South Park Elementary, hallway, day. Cartman puts his books in his locker and walks away when Butters catches him]
BUTTERS
Did you get 'em? Did you get 'em? Did you get 'em? Huh?
CARTMAN
[wearing a T-shirt that says "WARNING: YELP critic" on the front] Here you go. [takes a bag out of his back pocket and hands it to Butters]
BUTTERS
Whoooaaa. [opens the bag and begins eating what's inside.]
CARTMAN
Crispy risotto bites from Olive Garden.
BUTTERS
How do you do it, Eric?
CARTMAN
I'm a restaurant critic, Butters. I get whatever I want.
BUTTERS
Jeeeeezzz. [a second later, Kyle walks by with David]
KYLE
So the cafeteria's back that way, and most of the classrooms are this way, down the-.
CARTMAN
EEWW. [Kyle and David face him] What's the busboy doing here?
KYLE
Davíd is new to our school.
CARTMAN
Oh, cool. Are you gonna clean the tables here too? How do you get to school? [mimics a boy on a bicycle] Do you ride your tiny bicicleta? Huh?
KYLE
Shut up.
CARTMAN
Look amigo, I'm sorry I only gave your parents' restaurant 2 stars, but it could have been worse.
DAVÍD
Why'd you only give them 2 stars?
CARTMAN
I'm sorry, but the food totally messed my stomach up. The morning after I ate it I went to the bathroom and my poop was all solid. Like no water at all.
KYLE
It's not supposed to have water you-!
CARTMAN
It was like this one solid piece that I had to... push out my asshole. It was like being raped from the inside. Your parents' restaurant just wasn't up to my standards, David.
DAVÍD
David. (Dah-veed)
CARTMAN
David.
DAVÍD
Dah-víd.
CARTMAN
David.
DAVÍD
Dah-víííd.
CARTMAN
David David David David! I can update this to a 1-star review in two seconds, dude. [David turns around and walks away. Kyle turns around, looks at Cartman, and follows David away. A few second later Cartman relaxes] ...Oohhhh God I love being a restaurant critic.
[The Broflovski house, day, Gerald's den. Gerald is typing away at his computer. To help him focus on his work, he plays some opera music and smokes a pipe]
GERALD'S REVIEW
And yet, there was more. For in this crisp time when autumn begins to fade, the chef brings chicken in habanero, and even adds habanero powder to the crust. But the heat is restrained. You experience the fruity, delicious flavor of this without any spicy pain. I don't need any more pain. Hell, does anyone?
SHEILA
[appears at the den doorway with Ike] Gerald! We're going to the park. You wanna come along?
GERALD
Sorry honey, this review for Applebee's has turned into a fifty-pager. And then I have a polish on Ruby Tuesday's.
SHEILA
Why don't you take a break from Yelping, Gerald? You seem a little overwhelmed.
GERALD
[leans back on his chair] I am, overwhelmed. Sometimes I don't know what I've gotten myself into. But now everyone relies on my Yelp reviews and I... I don't wanna let anyone down.
SHEILA
Well there's chicken in the fridge if you get hungry.
GERALD
Thanks, but I, I've gotta Yelp a new place in CtPaTown tonight. [leans forward a bit] God I'm so damned tired.
SHEILA
Okay. Have fun.
GERALD
[to himself]Ha, "fun," she says.
GERALD'S REVIEW
In finality, I will say that my experience at Applebee's was sublime and my treatment near that of a gladiator most decorated. But the street parking wasn't that great. Two and a half stars.
GERALD
[satisfied with his review Gerald leans back in his chair again commenting to himself] Yes.
[The school cafeteria, day. Wendy walks by with a new classmate. Cartman is on his phone while the boys around him go about eating their lunches]
WENDY
Come on, Liza, I'll introduce you to the girls.
BUTTERS
Well aren't you eatin' lunch, Eric?
CARTMAN
Uhuh, I'm a food critic, Butters, okay? I can't just eat cafeteria food.
TUONG LU KIM
O-okay, Here you are sir! There's orange-peel chicken, some uh shity beef, and uh shitty egg roll!
KYLE
Are you joking?!
CARTMAN
Well, you are a little late, like, I dunno, maybe only [emphasis] 1 star late.
TUONG LU KIM
Oh no! No 1 star, prease! You Uelpers are kriwing me! Okay, you no pay! You no pay, prease!
CARTMAN
Sounds good. Now get the fuck out of here.
TUONG LU KIM
Yes yes. I get the fuck out. Thank you! [hurries away]
BUTTERS
Wow! Well you're pretty important, Eric.
KYLE
He's not important. At. All.
CARTMAN
Yes, no no, you you're right, Kyle. I'm not important. Oh, hey David, I was just wondering, um, how do you get to school? Do you... ride your tiny bicicleta? Eh?
STAN
Stop it.
CARTMAN
What? I just want to hear him say "Sí, me ride me tiny bicicleta to schooool."
DAVÍD
Sí, me ride me teeny bicicleta to school.
CARTMAN
[laughs] That's awesome! [turns around on the bench] I'm gonna go out to recess. Will you bus this for me, David. Thanks. [leaves the table. David leaves his seat]
KYLE
Ah, [facepalm] don't, dude, dude- Don't.
[Park County Police Station. Sgt. Yates is at his computer]
BARKLEY
Sir, it's midnight. Go home, get some sleep.
SGT. YATES
There's no time to sleep when the city's counting on me.
BARKLEY
More Yelp reviews, sir?
SGT. YATES
I had a bad experience at Red Lobster and if the people don't know about it, they could too. Folks deserve to know where to eat, Mitch.
BARKLEY
But does anyone even thank you for it?
SGT. YATES
I don't need them to. I know they need me, and that's enough.
BARKLEY
[pats him on the left shoulder] God bless you, sir.
SGT. YATES
I know. [Barkley walks away]
[Whistlin' Willy's Pizza Gulch, established in 1986. A table shows the food critic couple who were in Nueva Familia earlier on, now with their son]
WHISTLIN' WILLY
Welcome to Whistlin' Willy's. Y'all enjoyin' your pizza?
MALE FOOD CRITIC
Look here, my good man, we've been waiting over 15 minutes for you to sing Happy Birthday to our son!
FEMALE FOOD CRITIC
Unfortunately for you, we are both restaurant critics, and so is our son!
SON
[gets an angry face] 1 star!
DINER 1
Excuse me! Emergency! [Whistlin' Willy rushes over to see what's up] Over here! Emergency! I would like a table. Inside the area with all the little plastic balls please, and make it snappy I am a food critic for Yelp.
WHISTLIN' WILLY
That does it! I've had enough! All you Yelp reviewers get the hell outta here! I don't care what happens to my business! I ain't kissing your asses no more! [moves the male food critic from the table to the double doors on his chair and throws him against the doors] Go on! Every Yelper get the fuck out of here!
DINER 2
Careful now, Bill, you don't want a one-star review.
WHISTLIN' WILLY
You're not a food critic, Dennis! You're a fuckin' mechanic! Now get the fuck out! Go on! All you Yelpin' sons of bitches get the fuck out of here! [Yelpers begin to stream out of the restaurant]
MALE FOOD CRITIC
You're gonna regret this, Whistlin' Willy. You can't treat Yelpers this way.
WHISTLIN' WILLY
You get the f- Get the fuck out! [kicks the male food critic in the ass for emphasis as the critic goes out the door.]
MALE FOOD CRITIC
AH! [Whistlin' Willy slams the door shut. Gerald shows up a few seconds later]
GERALD
Well, good for you.
WHISTLIN' WILLY
You too, you sonofabitch!
GERALD
Whoa! Hey! [Whistlin' Willy kicks him out too, and Gerald rubs his butt outside]
[Shi Tpa Town. Tuong Lu Kim is running around excited about something while David's father sweeps up at Nueva Familia.]
TUONG LU KIM
It's oba! It's oba! [screams some more and approaches Nueva Familia.] You see papaa?! It's oba! [David's father steps outside and Mr. Kim stops him] Whistrin' Wirry! He stand up to the Yelpas! [David's father scans the front page] We don't have to kiss uh their asses anymore! Look! [David's mother comes out to join his father] Everyone is doing the same! [signs go up saying "No Yelpers"] Ha haha. It's ova it's ova! Hey Skeetah, you hear the news?! [He runs off continuing his celebration]
MR. RODRIGUEZ
[softly] It's a ...miracle. [jubilantly] IT'S A MIRACLE! [he and his wife hug]
[South Park Elementary, day. Cartman walks down the hallway humming to himself]
CARTMAN
Hm hm hm the fuck? [notices a small puddle on the floor] Aw, dude, somebody spilled shit on the floor! [notices David at his locker] Hey David, somebody spilled something here. Could you clean this up, por favor? David. [whistles] Over here, there's some shit on the floor. [David closes his locker and turns away] Heyheyhey hey! What's goin' on, man?
KYLE
[arriving] You haven't heard? Nobody gives a fuck what Yelp reviewers think anymore.
CARTMAN
What are you talking about? I'm the most influential critic in this town. Okay David, forget the spill, just give me one little "My name is David. Me ride me biciceta to schoool"
DAVÍD
My name... is David. (Dah-veed)[walks off]
KYLE
HA! [walks off as well; confidently]
CARTMAN
[whips out his phone] Okay, I'm uh I'm updating my review. I'm about to do it. [waits for a comeback but doesn't get one] You'd better say "I ride me bicicleta to school"! [holds up his phone] One star! ... No s-no stars? [no reply. He sighs and tries again] No stars? ... You can't just treat me like I'm nothing... I still know I'm worth something! Come on, guys! [walks away. No one follows him. Seconds later he's back.] Oh yeah, y-you guys stay in school, that's kewl, you guys stay here. [leaves again]
[Shi Tpa Town, day. Cartman walks alone by City Wok. He notices a sign there - NO YELPERS. He then walks to Nueva Familia and knocks on the door. David is moving chairs around and stops. Cartman mimics someone riding a bike, and David sticks his middle finger up at him, then turns and walks away. Cartman sighs, turns around, and walks away. He walks right into Butters' house, through the living room, and up into Butters' room. Butters is at his desk drawing a purple car. Cartman sighs]
BUTTERS
[noticing] Oh, hey Eric.
CARTMAN
[hops onto Butters' bed and lays down] It's all over, Butters. Everything I've worked so hard to achieve. All these hack wannabe food critics have made my profession a joke.
BUTTERS
Oh I'm sorry, bud.
CARTMAN
All these people trying to be like me. And they don't even write about poop consistency the next day.
BUTTERS
Well Eric, you should be proud that people wanna be like you. Ha ah, I mean, you really started something.
CARTMAN
I guess.
BUTTERS
Well if these people look up to you, maybe, maybe you can sort of, set the record straight and show them the way it's supposed to be done.
CARTMAN
[sits up] You're right, Butters. Maybe I can actually use all these people somehow to make... real food critics respected again.
[Sgt. Yates' house. Yates serves himself some whisky on the rocks while doing more reviews. His wife Maggie walks up to him.]
MAGGIE
Harrison Yates, what's gotten into you?
YATES
That's it, Maggie. I'm hanging it up. If people are gonna be trying all the new restaurants in town they'll... have to do it without my reviews.
MAGGIE
What are ya talkin' about? You said that protectin' people from bad dinin' experiences was what kept you goin'.
YATES
The restaurants put up signs sayin' I can't come in. I don't know why they singled me out, but it's like, people don't need me. [opens a letter and reads it] Well I'll be damned.
MAGGIE
What is it?
YATES
Somebody's put a note in the mailbox... asking me to come and talk to them. They do need me. [rises and goes to the coat rack] I need to get goin'.
MAGGIE
You want me to come along?
YATES
No, they're just asking for me. I guess... [opens the front door] maybe I do have a town to protect. [smiles and leaves]
[Cartman's house, Sunday. Cartman is getting refreshments ready for his guests in the living room. Liane walks up to him]
LIANE
Oh, are you having a party sweetheart?
CARTMAN
Not a part, Mom. I've invited all the poser food critics over for a meeting.
LIANE
Oh, how fun!
CARTMAN
It's not fun, it's serious. These people think they can do what I do, but they need to be, made to understand the reality. When the Yelpers get here I need you to get lost, okay? Okay, that's them, that's them. Go, get lost, Mom! [she goes away as he walks to the front door. He opens the door and sees a sea of reviewers]
YELPERS
Hello, hi. My name is [they all give their names at the same time] and I'm here for the meeting. [Cartman freezes up]
A REVIEWER
Is this the right place?
CARTMAN
Fuuuuuuck! [closes the door and keeps it closed with his back] Mom!
LIANE
I'm going, honey.
CARTMAN
But Mom, there's like a billion people here.
LIANE
Oh yes, sweetie, I think quite a few people are Yelp reviewers.
CARTMAN
Oh, this many people have nothing better to do than write reviews on Yelp?!
LIANE
I guess so, honey. Do you need more lemonade?
CARTMAN
Mom, there's a fucking billion people here! [yes, Yelpers all up and down the block, filling the streets all around. Moments later, he appears at his bedroom window on the second floor, and holds court] Uh, thank you all for coming. My name is Eric, and as you know, us Yelpers are being scrutinized-
A YELPER
COULD YOU SPEAK A LITTLE LOUDER?
CARTMAN
Yes. Us Yelp critics are being scrutinized.
OTHER YELPERS
That's right! Yeah!
CARTMAN
Now, you see, the problem is that when there's too many reviewers, people no longer know who is the real food critic. [Sgt. Yates puffs up his chest, pretty sure that it's him] It's great that you all want to be critics, but we all know who the real food analyst of the town is.
OTHER YELPERS
That's right. Yeah!
GERALD
[confidently humble] Huh. Oh thanks.
CARTMAN
Okay. So, as long as there is one clear leader, then the rest of you can just follow. And with this many people all following [holds up index finger] one captain, we can fight to get our power back!
A YELPER
Poweerrrrr Back!
CARTMAN
So now rise up, and [pounds on the window sill] fight for your leader!! Fight together and show the restaurants that our food critic does matter!
OTHER YELPERS
Yeah! Let's go! [more cheering from the Yelpers]
SGT. YATES
Alright, follow me!
GERALD
This way, everyone! [the crowd turns left and moves off]
[Whistlin' Willy's Pizza Gulch, day. A mother and son leave, but are still nearby when the crowd of Yelpers arrives and begins destroying the gulch. They then leave quickly. After a barrel is thrown through a window, Willy looks up to see what's going on]
[News 4 segment]
ANCHOR TOM
Another local business is closing its doors tonight after being taken down by Yelp reviewers. Whistlin' Willy's, a child favorite in town, was destroyed and its owner stripped and beheaded. The following video is graphic. [a crowd of Yelp reviewers is shown and they are ululating. Two Yelpers bring Whistlin' Willy in front of the camera and hold him there. The crowd continues to ululate]
WHISTLIN' WILLY
No, please! No! Nonono! [the Yelpers pull the mask off his head and show it off to the camera] Awwww. [the ululating continues]
[South Park Elementary, day. "Bad to the Bone" plays as the school bell rings. Cartman walks down the hallway as a Big Critic on Campus, while in voice over he is singing the words. The other kids either hold their hands up or hold themselves a little tighter as Cartman walks to the tune of "Bad To The Bone." He's met by a group of boys led by Kyle.]
KYLE
We all... loved... Whistlin' Willy's!
CARTMAN
[just shrugs] It didn't do well with Yelpers.
TOLKIEN
You assholes destroyed the best place in town because they wouldn't kiss your asses!
CARTMAN
Oh come on, admit it. The food sucked.
KYLE
Nobody went for the fucking food!
CARTMAN
Look, I'm sorry goys, but Whistlin' Willy failed to recognize the influence someone like me has on their business. Now, I just have one question for you, David. Do you ride... your teeny, tiny, bicicleta... to school?
DAVÍD
Si. Me ride me teeny bicicleta to school. [turns around and walks away. Kyle flashes an angry look at Cartman, then watches Davíd leave]
KYLE
[gets in Cartman's face] You're done! [turns around and walks away with the remaining boys]
CARTMAN
Yeah, I'm done! I'm now the leader of thousands of people! They all hang on my every word! [softly] And I'm gonna use my power to finally get what this town really needs.
[The Broflovski house, day, Gerald's den. Gerald is typing away at his computer, with music and pipe, as before.]
GERALD'S REVIEW
I found the wait staff at Red Lobster to be rude, and barely even acknowledging who I was. Or what I meant to this city.
SHEILA
[appears at the doorway with Ike] Gerald, I'm taking Ike to clown school. You care to joing us?
GERALD
I can't, honey. I'm now the leader of thousands of people. They all hang on my every word. And I'm going to use my power to finally get what this town really needs. [Sheila and Ike just walk away]
[Shi Tpa Town. The peace and quiet of the morning is disrupted by semiautomatic gunfire. Yelpers run into the area, and a bomb goes off behind Dee's Meats. Another News 4 segment]
REPORTER
For the fifth day in a row, historic Shi Tpa Town is under siege by Yelp reviewers. The restaurants are still refusing to be intimidated. and the Yelp reviewers are- [quickly ducks as the gunfire hits very close to him] -and the Yelp reviewers are preparing for all-out war. [real war footage is shown] The angry Yelp reviewers are demanding special treatment at all city restaurants. They claim that as local food critics they deserve respect and that all who oppose them will suffer. The online restaurant critics are getting ready to bring businesses to their knees, and some are already closing their doors. [Nueva Familia is shown...]
REPORTER
One local restaurant worker actually called out the Yelp critics' leader.
DAVID
I guess you win, huh, big shot?! If you really are any kind of important to anybody, then get your bullshit food critic ass to the south of town and face me! Because you aren't a food critic, and you aren't important! [Sgt. Yates looks at the screen in the police station] And unless you're a chicken, I'll see you south of town! [Yates walks into his office and gets his coat]
BARKLEY
Where are you going, sir?
SGT. YATES
You heard him. Little Mexican kid called me out. [shows his gun, then places it back in its holster] If he wants to fight me, that's fine.
BARKLEY
You need backup sir?
SGT. YATES
No, he's just calling me out. [turns and walks out]
BARKLEY
God bless you sir.
SGT. YATES
I know!
[The south of town, a big meadow or park on the outskirts of town. David marches towards the meeting point. Kyle runs up to catch him]
KYLE
David! Dude, wait! [Kyle is next to him now] Dude, you don't wanna do this. You don't know what Cartman's capable of.
DAVID
Where I come from, we settle things with our fists!
KYLE
But this isn't Mexico.
DAVID
I'm not from Mexico, dude! I'm from Idaho! [Kyle glances away, embarrassed] I'm gonna show this prick how we do things in Boise!
CARTMAN
Oh, hello David! [Cartman is flanked by hundreds of Helpers]
KYLE
Alright, you've got your army! You've got your followers! If you're such a great leader, then just tell the city what you want, fat-ass!
GERALD
Don't call me fat, son! I'm doing this because they've-
SGT. YATES
What I want is to be able to lead these fine people with the respect and the dignity-
YELPER 1
I didn't ask to be the leader, I was appointed! You see, I'm extremely important to this town, and I'm not going to be-
YELPER 2
My journey is this town's food- [soon everyone is talking over each other, and David and Kyle just look at each other.]
YELPER 3
You've made these people feel unwanted, and now they look to me for answers.
GERALD
Now here I stand, vulnerable, afraid, and yet willing to do what the people of this-
MALE FOOD CRITIC
And so we said "to hell with it!" And we took the challenge to go from the town's food critics to the town's spiritual leaders! What do we want?
YELPER 4
[another woman] People would say "Oh, you're just a food blogger. You're just a tiny voice in the crowd. Well now my voice is heard, and I will-" [her voice melts into the other voices]
CARTMAN
...wanted special privileges, but these people think I should have them! Right, guys? Maybe I don't deserve special treatment, but how else can I be the elite food critic they want? [more chatter]
KYLE
[after a few moments] Every person here thinks this is about them.
DAVID
I think I know what to do.
KYLE
Yeah. Me too.
[They Mayor's office, day. Mayor McDaniels sits at her desk, with several townsfolk standing behind her. Kyle stands to the right of the desk in a suit. Fanfare plays]

[an aide pins the badge on Gerald's coat] Wearing this badge means you will always get the special treatment that you deserve. [Johnson rings a bell and Fr. Maxi hums a short chant]
GERALD
Thank you, Mayor. It's a big responsibility, but I suppose I have to accept. I will do my best to serve this town.

We know you will. [shows him the exit. He turns right and walks out. Another aide closes the exit door]
KYLE
Okay, bring in the next one.
MAYOR MCDANIELS

[Nueva Familia, day. The signs that showed the restaurant was shutting down are gone; the Grand Opening sign remains]
DAVÍD
Alright, we got all the restaurants to agree to let the Yelpers in and make them feel special.
MR. RODRIGUEZ
How did you do it, son?
[(vernacular), dinnertime. An elite food critic is about to order.]
DINER 3
Hi, yes, the steak, please. [points to his golden badge] I'm the uh Yelp elite. [the waiter takes his order to the kitchen and...]
WAITER
Alright, we got a Yelper. Give it that special attention.
CHEF
Youuu got it! [puts his finger into his nose and pulls out some boogers, and smears them on the steak.]
[Montage. What follows is a series of scenes showing cooks and waiters doing nasty things to Yelpers' dishes, including more boogers on them, masturbating to them, peeing on them, farting on them, etc... Some examples; Mr. Kim masturbating onto a plate of broccoli chicken, then serving it to the food critic couple, and grinning to himself; a Steed chef masturbates onto a plate of thin steaks and gives it to a waiter, who serves it to Sgt. Yates; Gerald finishes a review, then eats crab legs at a fine restaurant. Back at (vernacular), a waiter farts on a salad and gives it to the female food critic. Later, the couple critiques the restaurant's décor to the greeter. Whistlin' Willy serves up three pizzas to three different elite Yelpers. Sgt. Yates is back at the office writing another review.]

synopsis:Cartman is the latest victim of body shaming.

script:Safe Space

[South Park Elementary, day. Cartman sits in PC Prinicpal's office hyperventilating, teary-eyed. PC Principal and Mr. Mackey both look at him.]
PC PRINCIPAL
So these guys made fun of your weight and made you feel ashamed?
CARTMAN
[voice shaking terribly] Yes, I was just trying to do my job as a food critic and they all ganged up on me and said I was fat.
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright, why don't you take me back to what happened?
CARTMAN
I was in the locker room. I was in my underwear and these kids walked by [Craig and Clyde appear around the corner] Then I looked in the mirror and I thought I looked kind of ripped, and so I asked one of the kids [Clyde] if he would take a picture of me [holding two dumbbells, one in each hand] and he did. And I looked at the picture and I looked pretty ripped, so later at home, I put the picture up on my Yelp account and I typed in "Don't I look ripped?" and I thought people would be stoked on me. Then this morning I saw the comments on Twitter and some people called me names and said I wasn't ripped, and they said that I was fat and I didn't have muscles. The Internet made fun of me and [is overcome with emotion and hyperventilates. PC Principal sniffs and clears his throat.]
MR. MACKEY
Well, Eric, maybe you shouldn't have put a picture of you in your underwear up on social media.
PC PRINCIPAL
[jumps up and faces Mr. Mackey] Hey! You got a fuckin' problem, Mackey!
MR. MACKEY
N-No, PC Principal.
PC PRINCIPAL
Because body-shaming is fuckin' serious, and I'm not gonna allow that shit in my school! [faces Cartman] Nobody should have to feel that kind of shame!
[Whole Foods Market, day. Liane walks out with her groceries, Randy walks around inside marveling at all the stuff. Next, he's in Checkout 5 having his purchases scanned.]
CASHIER
Okay. sir, looks like your total is $37.83.
RANDY
[pulls out his wallet and takes out $40] Alright.
CASHIER
[checks the monitor] Okay, and, would you like to add a dollar donation to help hungry kids around the world?
RANDY
[real quiet] Oh, uh, no, that, that's okay.
CASHIER
Sorry?
RANDY
[real quiet] I'm, I'm good.
CASHIER
[having trouble hearing him clearly] I'm sorry, you don't want to give the dollar to hungry kids?
RANDY
[real quiet] Not today, thank you.
CASHIER
Okay, no problem. [punches in the last few numbers into the register.] A window's gonna come up and ask if you're helping the hungry kids, just hit "No, I'm not."
RANDY
[real quiet] Oh, come on.
CASHIER
Try hitting it again. It's the box below the one that says, "Sure, I'd love to help however I can." [Randy hits the button again... and again a few more times, but it only beeps twice. The cashier looks at it.] Ah, darn thing. Sorry. Most people give the dollar. I can do this manually. [turns to the register and taps a few keys]
RANDY
Look, I give money to charity a lot, okay?
CASHIER
Oh, sure you do.
RANDY
I do. I just don't want to every time I shop for food.
CASHIER
That's completely understandable. [reads something] "Have customer speak on the-" Oh-okay. if you can just speak into the voice decoder and say "I'm not giving anything to the hungry kids."
RANDY
[leans in and speaks into the "decoder"] I'm not giving anything to the hungry kids. [his voice echoes throughout the store, and everyone takes notice]
CASHIER
Okay, that's got it. So with the ice cream, the vodka, pizza pockets, and nothing for hungry kids, that's $37.83. [getting a bit sarcastic] Oh, don't forget your change.
RANDY
Look, if I give money every time I went grocery-shopping, I would be-!
CASHIER
[cuts him off] Thanks for shopping, sir. Next, please.
RANDY
[takes his paper bag full of groceries and leaves] Dick!
[PC Principal's office, moments. PC Principal opens the door and Kyle walks in.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Morning, Kyle. Have a seat right there. [Kyle takes the seat next to Cartman and is instantly displeased] You probably heard that Eric here has been dealing with some body shaming? [Cartman is still whimpering]
KYLE
Uh huh.
PC PRINCIPAL
Well, Eric and I have been talking, and we've decided it's probably best for him to get off of social media.
KYLE
Yeah probably.
PC PRINCIPAL
So what we're looking for is a student volunteer. Somebody who can put the things Eric wants up on the Internet for him and also filter through all the comments and make it more of a safe space for him.
KYLE
Wait, what?
CARTMAN
I said you were perfect because you're really good at getting all your schoolwork done on time [gathers his thoughts] so you'd probably do a really good job.
KYLE
You want me to run Cartman's Twitter and Yelp account and only give him the good comments?
PC PRINCIPAL
That's right.
KYLE
No.
PC PRINCIPAL
Kyle, you know what body-shaming is, right? How much it can hurt someone's life? All you have to do is check out all the comments, type out just the positive ones, and give that to Eric on paper.
KYLE
If he doesn't like what people say on Twitter, he can get off. [Cartman begins to cry]
PC PRINCIPAL
Okay, Kyle, well maybe you'd like two weeks' detention instead.
KYLE
[a bit stunned, considers his options] Give me... give me detention.
PC PRINCIPAL
You sure about that?
KYLE
Yeah, I'll take the detention.
PC PRINCIPAL
That's two weeks' detention for you, bud! I'll see you at 4! [Kyle looks at Eric, gets up, and leaves. Next, PC Principal is talking to another student] And when we said someone should probably help Eric by filtering out any negative comments, he mentioned you by name.
WENDY
Is this a joke?
CARTMAN
I'm not a joke!
PC PRINCIPAL
Nothing funny about this, Testaburger! This is a big problem in our country!
WENDY
I'm not doing it.
PC PRINCIPAL
And that's two weeks' detention for you! Congratulations! [Wendy looks at Eric, gets up, and leaves. Next, PC Principal is talking to another student] So, any comments that seem inappropriate or hurtful in any way, you need to delete and not include in your daily report to Eric. [Butters is shown next to Cartman now]
CARTMAN
I wanted someone smart and hard-working!
BUTTERS
Do I gotta?
PC PRINCIPAL
You want detention?
BUTTERS
Well, if I get detention, uh, I'll get grounded.
PC PRINCIPAL
Then you start today! Butters, it's your job to make sure Eric has a safe space.
[Whole Foods Market, day. Randy is at a salad bar creating his own salad. A female shopper is making one too, and their tongs clash over greens]
FEMALE SHOPPER
Oh, ahhh, I'm sorry.
RANDY
Oh no, my, my fault.
FEMALE SHOPPER
Isn't it great having a Whole Foods?
RANDY
This is where I come for lunch every day. Gotta eat healthy to stay fit. [pleased at this encounter. He turns to leave and sees the cashier from before, who waves back at him. To himself] Aw, shit, it's that guy. [as no one else is waiting, he goes ahead and makes his purchases]
CASHIER
Aand how are you today, sir?
RANDY
Great. [leans in and in a low voice] Uh, listen, before you ring me up, I just wanna let you know I'm not gonna be giving extra money to charity, so can we, can we just skip that part?
CASHIER
Oh, no problem, sir, they've updated the system so it's a lot more streamlined now. Find everything you need today?
RANDY
Yeah, thanks.
CASHIER
There we go, and that's... Okay, and would you like to give a dollar to hungry kids today?
RANDY
[softly] No. I said no, before.
CASHIER
Oh that's right. Okay, there's a picture of a little hungry boy. Will you just press on his belly? [Randy does so, and hears "Oww, owww." The cashier checks the readout] Okay, that's got it. So, with the no help for hungry kids that's $18.87. [Randy hands him a $20 bill] Out of 20. [the cashier gives him some change back in the coin return tray] Your change is right there, just pull the sandwich out of the little girl's mouth. [a cardboard cutout of a little girl hides the coin return]
RANDY
This is not streamlined!
CASHIER
It's just the new change dispenser, sir. [Randy then goes ahead and tries to pull the sandwich away]
RANDY
[a couple of grunts later] I can't.
CASHIER
Yes, she's a hungry one. You've gotta pull hard.
RANDY
Dammit! The sandwich isn't coming out.
CASHIER
Try putting your foot on her face. [Randy promptly does this. He also notices the woman he bumped into earlier in Checkout 4 and flashes a smile to her. Finally he pulls the sandwich out of the cutout's mouth and gets his change and his groceries] Have a nice day, sir!
RANDY
I was having a nice day! [leaves the store]
[South Park Elementary hallway, day. Cartman puts his books into his locker and closes it. As he walks away, Butters appears around the corner and catches up to him.]
BUTTERS
[sounding quite tired] Eric, hold up.
CARTMAN
There you are. You have my social media comments?
BUTTERS
Yeah. Yeah, right here. [hands him the papers] I just finished this morning.
CARTMAN
[reviews them] Mm-hm. Hm-oh, that's nice. Oh great. This is all the Twitter comments?
BUTTERS
Yeah. And the people commenting on your Yelp page starts here. [points to the first comment on the current page]
CARTMAN
Okay, nice. Oh ni- oh, very enthusiastic. This is so great! [turns around and walks by Kyle, who's at his locker.] Oh Kyle! You thought me having someone edit my social media would make me look stupid? You should see all the comments I'm getting. People are actually really stoked on me now.
BUTTERS
It's a pretty brutal job sifting through all that darkness.
[South Park Elementary gym, later. The whole school is in attendance as PC Principal introduces someone.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright everyone, listen up. In order to better understand the negative effects of body-shaming, we have a- [points to someone on the bleachers] HEY, LESLIE! PUT A FUCKIN' SOCK IN IT! [Leslie was whispering to Esther again, and again she backs off slowly] We have a guest speaker today who will challenge our perceptions of physical beauty. [steps towards a screen upon which is a graphic that says "NO MORE FAT SHAMING"] So please welcome action star and hero, Steven Seagal. [claps a few times, then puts the mic into a mic stand and steps aside as music plays. Real life pictures of a slimmer Seagal from his early films pop up as a slide show]
STEVEN SEAGAL
[voice-over] You've got a problem with me? I'm your worse nightmare. I have no fear of death, more important, I don't fear life. [gun shot sound effect. The slide show ends and an obese Seagal walks into the gym with a gun drawn. He gets to the mic and begins to whimper, and lowers the gun] I'm a big action movie star and people are pretty stoked on me. And then I put a picture of myself up on the Internet and I had my shirt off and I said "Do you think I'm ripped?" and some people commented saying I didn't look ripped, that I was fat, and they called me Steven Se-boom-boom, so I put another picture on the Internet and I thought people would be stoked on me, but they said that I looked like a fat turd, and they said I wasn't buff. [hyperventilates] Body-shaming isn't cool, and, if p-people shame you on the Inter n-net, you have to make sure that you stay, you stay strong and tell everyone you're proud of how you look, like this. [begins to shuffle dance and clap as "Got To Be Real" starts playing]
[The school hallway, later. Steven is headed out and PC Principal catches up to him.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Hey, Seagal! Listen, that was a really amazing talk you gave to the kids.
STEVEN SEAGAL
[sniffs] Thank you.
PC PRINCIPAL
I can see that you're in a lot of pain, bro. I've got someone who I think can help.
[PC Principal's office. An exhausted Butters is sitting next to a sobbing Seagal as PC Principal makes his case]
PC PRINCIPAL
So I want you to do for Mr. Seagal the same thing that you're doing for Eric Cartman.
BUTTERS
But, PC Principal, I really don't have time.
PC PRINCIPAL
This man took the time to come to your school and help spread body-shaming awareness! I think you can give him a little of your time!
BUTTERS
Yes sir...
[Whole Foods Market, later. Randy is back to buy more groceries. He's back at Checkout 5 with the same cashier as before]
CASHIER
Find everything you needed today?
RANDY
Yes.
CASHIER
Okay, looks like your total comes to $37.98. Would you like to give a dollar to help feed hungry kids?
RANDY
Yes, I would like to give a dollar.
CASHIER
[surprised] You want to give a dollar?
RANDY
Yes, I will.
CASHIER
[excited sounding] Oh wow, okay! So that's $10 for the beer, $4.20 in chocolate-covered peanuts, $26 in filet mignons, [sarcastically] and one dollar for hungry kids around the world. On "amount of donation" it will say $10, $20, or $50, can you just press the "$1" box? [Randy does so and bells, sirens, and colored lights go off. The cashier gets on the mic and says] Attention shoppers, somebody just joined the $1 club, giving one whole dollar to help feed hungry children. [quickly goes around the checkout] Here's your T-shirt! [quickly slips it on Randy and takes a picture, then prints the picture. The shirt says "I Gave $1.00 to End Hunger." The cashier pins the picture on the "$1" cork board, which was empty before] Ho, won't the kids be thrilled when they get their piece of that big impressive dollar. [walks back to his register and sings] For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow! He ended world hunger. [Randy takes his groceries and leaves, whimpering]
[Butter's house, afternoon, bedroom. Butters is toiling away at his computer.]
BUTTERS
Yech. Oh God that's terrible. Jesus.
DEMI LOVATO
[sitting on Butters' bed] Yeah. No, I'm telling you, Tracy, it's the greatest thing ever. I'm getting all my Twitter and Instagram comments on paper, and the nasty mean stuff, all gets edited out.
BUTTERS
Whoa my God. Wugh.
DEMI LOVATO
Yeah. And the coolest thing? Ever since I started using this service, all of my followers are actually way more stoked on me. So cool, right?
CARTMAN
Butters!
BUTTERS
[startled] Yeah!
CARTMAN
[at the bedroom door] What the hell is this? The last report you gave me has a comment that says "This picture of you burned my eyes, fatso!"
BUTTERS
Well, I'm sorry, Eric. I, I guess it slipped through the cracks. I'm overloaded with all the new people.
CARTMAN
What new people? [walks up to the computer]
BUTTERS
Well, I've got Demi Lovato [points to her] to take care of now, and Lena Dunham just put a picture of her asshole on Twitter, and wants only the positive comments.
CARTMAN
Dude, fuck Demi Lovato! She's fuckin' hot, she's not being fat-shamed!
DEMI LOVATO
[stands up] Am so! But I don't care. People just have to accept my body the way it is.
CARTMAN
Butters, I want this fixed by tonight! You got that?!
BUTTERS
Okay, Eric. [Cartman walks away]
[A commercial. "Amazing Grace" plays with a female voice. A poor community is shown. Randy walks among the poor folk]
RANDY
This is a place where hope is scarce. These people are hungry. Little Jojo here might not eat today. But does that mean it's okay for cashiers to ask us for money while we're in the checkout line? It isn't right, and it isn't fair. Just $2 a day adds up to 62 goddamned dollars a month if you go to Whole Foods as much as I do. Nobody should have to feel the shame, the humiliation, of being asked to add money onto their grocery bill. Help now. Let's make grocery stores a #SAFESPACE for all. Together, we can make a difference.
GIRL
Because charity-shaming hurts everyone. [Randy holds her a bit closer]
[PC Principal's office, day. He and Mr. Mackey are talking to someone]
PC PRINCIPAL
You know, if there's one thing I really respect, it's plus-sized models who challenge the idea of what makes a woman beautiful. These ladies are gonna be part of a big ad campaign for plus-sized lingerie, and we wanna make sure they're protected from any harassing comments.
BUTTERS
[Butters is seated across from PC Principal with an entire row of plus-sized women in lingerie] Do I have to, sir?
PC PRINCIPAL
Hey, they're gonna putting themselves out there, and all I'm asking you to do is go through their social media and delete the two or three comments that are mean.
BUTTERS
PC Principal, ah, I don't think you quite realize how much negative stuff I have to sift through.
PC PRINCIPAL
I know it's a lot, but I just really need you to help these plus-sized models. And Vin Diesel.
BUTTERS
Vin Diesel too??
PC PRINCIPAL
Look bro! You've done an amazing job with Eric Cartman. You have really turned his life around, and other people deserve... to be as happy as he is.
[South Park Elementary hallway. A piano begins to play a song, and Cartman sings first. Soon, an abstract space appears in which are tiny rooms - a safe space - one for each person singing]
CARTMAN
Everyone likes me and thinks I'm great in my safe spaaaace.
SEAGAL
My safe spaaaace.
CARTMAN
[eating in a restaurant, Butters hands him more comments] People don't judge me and haters don't hate in my safe spaaaace. [An exhausted Butters is hard at work in his room]
PC PRINCIPAL
Your safe spaaaace.
CARTMAN AND SEAGAL
[standing in a floating tiny room] Bully-proof windows, troll-safe doors, nothing but kindness and healing.
RANDY
You might call me a pussy, but I won't hear you in my safe spaaaace.
SEAGAL
My safe spaaaace.
CARTMAN
Bully-proof windows.
DEMI LOVATO
[standing under a spotlight] If you do not like me, you are not allowed in my safe spaaaace.
PLUS-SIZED MODELS
My safe spaaaace
PC PRINCIPAL
[inside the pricipal's office with Butters, he then hands Vin Disel more comments] Look and you will see there's a very select crowd in your safe spaaaace. [Steven Seagal is resting on a bed in his safe space]
ALL
My safe spaaaace.
CARTMAN
People that support me.
ALL
Mixed in with
CARTMAN
More people that support me.
ALL
And say nice things. Rainbows all around me, there is no shame in my safe spaaaace.
RANDY
My safe spaaaace.
CARTMAN
Bully-proof windows. [a change in tempo as villianous music plays and a masked villain enters the video.]
REALITY
I am going to tear down your safe space! Brick by brick, I shall smash it with glee!
CARTMAN
What? Who is that?
REALITY
You cannot stop me from getting inside! I am cold and I am hard, and my name... is Reality.
DEMI LOVATO
Oh no, not reality! Somebody stop him!
CARTMAN
I'll take care of him, Demi! [shoots lightning from his hands, and the various people in their safe spaces are now dressed to dance!]
ALL
[faster rock music begins playing] You can't ruin our lives, Reality!
CARTMAN
Our safe spaces will keep you out!
REALITY
Drat!
ALL
We can face almost anything!
CARTMAN
But Reality we can do without!
REALITY
Nooooo... [vanishes, as the original piano music resumes]
CARTMAN
Bully-proof windows.
ALL
Troll-safe doors. [slowing down] My Safe Spaaaaaaaace! [all stop]
CARTMAN
That was nice.
[Whole Foods Market, day. The cashier at Checkout 5 sends one shopper off]
CASHIER
All right, thanks, have a great day. [Randy steps up] Good afternoon sir.
RANDY
[self-assured] Oh, hello. You might know Steven Seagal [who steps up, with his gun aimed at the cashier]
STEVEN SEAGAL
You wanna play with me?
RANDY
And this is Vin Diesel.
CASHIER
Oh, hello gentlemen.
RANDY
It'd be... a really bad idea for you to charity-shame me today. These guys are here to protect my safe space.
CASHIER
That's great. [hums to himself as he scans Randy's items]
This little piggy went to market.
This little piggy stayed home.
This little piggy was in Fast And The Furious, [Vin Diesel begins to whimper and walks away]
and this little piggy goes direct to cable.[Steven Seagal begins to whimper and walks away]
[jabs Randy in the belly] And this little piggy just bought fifty-three dollars in beer and frozen pizzas. Would you like to make a dollar donation to hungry kids today?
[A second commercial. We're back in the poor community. "Amazing Grace" plays with a deep male voice, and Demi Lovato walks in]
DEMI LOVATO
Look around you. What do you see? People who are slim. Skinny. But not everyone can have nice bodies like them. Just imagine it. Putting your pictures up on Twitter just to have some people write comments about your weight. It happens, all too often.
RANDY
[taking over] But it doesn't stop there. People also can be shamed for other traits viewed as negative. Mike here was shamed for not being a good recycler.
DEMI LOVATO
And so together, we have created #shamelessAmerica, [a screen pops up with "let's work towards a #shamelessAmerica."] so no one is ever labeled...
FAT WOMAN
Tubby.
MAN WITH CAP
Bad with tools.
WOMAN 2
Dyke!
MAN 2
Butter butter dirty line cutter.
RANDY
Let's work together to create a completely shameless America.
BOY
[emaciated] Because shaming hurts everyone. [Randy holds him a bit closer]
[Butters' room, night. He's editing out negative comments on Demi Lovato's social media pages before printing them]
BUTTERS
[reading through online messages] "Hey Demi Lovato, I bet your vagina has a-" [begins to gag] oh. Oh God. Oh, that's horrible [picks up a waste basket and vomits into it] Augh. [coughs] Jeez. Delete. Delete that too. [continues reading comments aloud] "I'd like to stick my wiener into those fat rolls of-" [villianous piano music begins to play] Oh God! [Reality sneaks into his room and paces behind Butter's chair] Uh, delete! "You aren't fat, but my dick is-" Whoa, God.
REALITY
HaHAA!
BUTTERS
GAAAHHH!
REALITY
So you're the one trying to destroy me, eh??
BUTTERS
What? [falls out of his chair. Reality tries to grab him, but misses. Butters runs to a night stand]
REALITY
You little shit! Keep me out, will you?
BUTTERS
I don't know you, sir!
REALITY
You can't stop me! [tries to grab Butters again, but breaks the lamp on the night stand] I'm going to kill you! [jumps up to fall on him. At that moment, the bedroom door opens]
STEPHEN
Butters! What are you doing?!
BUTTERS
[panicked] Well-ll, the man! Uh, the man is gonna get me! [Butters points to where Reality was standing only for the shot to widen showing he is no longer there]
[Whole Foods Market, day. The cashier is ringing Randy up.]
CASHIER
And some chocolate-covered almonds. Vanderpump Sangria mix.
RANDY
Yeah, um, I'm a little tired because I'm actually hosting a huge fundraiser for my charity organization [shows off his shirt: "#ShamelessAmerica"] that I'm sort of the head of.
CASHIER
That's great, sir. Ice cream sandwiches.
RANDY
Yeah, we're gonna raise a lot of money. Celebrities are coming. Demi Lovato is givin' a hundred thousand for the event.
CASHIER
Wonderful. Rotisserie chicken. Oh yep, gotta have that Frank's hot sauce.
RANDY
I just thought, you know, a fundraiser dinner was sort of the appropriate place to ask for donations.
CASHIER
That's great, sir. Okay, your total is $37.85, and would you like to give a dollar to help put a hamster through college?
RANDY
[stunned] ...What? Did you not hear anything I said? I'm - I'm doin' all this stuff.
CASHIER
Not a problem, sir. [takes out a hamster from behind the counter] If you could just press the N0 button and tell the little hamster he's not going to college. Just look him right in the eye, sir, and say "Not today, buddy."
RANDY
Actually, my big fundraising gala is helping put hamsters through college too.
CASHIER
[Excited] Oh, really? Wow. Did you hear that, Banjo? You've got support. [puts the hamster back behind the counter] Well, you have a nice day sir. [hands Randy his receipt] And thank so much for being so generous.
RANDY
You're welcome. [takes his groceries, but has no bag to put them in. He doesn't mind]
[South Park Elementary hallway. Stan, Kyle, Davíd and Kenny walk along when Cartman interrupts them.]
CARTMAN
Hey, Kyle. You wanna see what people said about my dick pic? Everyone's pretty stoked on it.
KYLE
There's more than two people on the Internet.
BUTTERS
The man! The man the man the man the man! [runs around the corner completely naked] The man he's gonna get me! He shadows me everywhere! [stops another student and gets in his face] Do you see the man?!
KYLE
[turns him around] Butters, what are you doing?! [the other student leaves]
BUTTERS
Well, he's gonna get me!
KYLE
Dude, Butters, you're seeing things! Sifting through all the horrible stuff people say on the Internet is making you lose it!
BUTTERS
[breaks free and runs off] The world is darkness! The man is coming!
STAN
Dude, Butters! [he and Kyle give chase. Butters goes up a flight of stairs]
BUTTERS
Aaaaa! Aaaaa!
[Kindergarten, day. The teacher quizzes the kids on a story]
TEACHER
And what color is the little ball the kittens are playing with?
BUTTERS
[runs into the classroom] Run for your lives, you little fuckers, the man is coming! [the kids scream as Kyle enters the room. Stan, Davíd and Kenny follow him in]
KYLE
Butters, listen to my voice.
BUTTERS
The man is gonna get me if I don't stop!
KYLE
Then stop, dude! Butters, all this isn't worth it. Just. Take, the detention, dude.
BUTTERS
[thinks a moment and jumps through a glass window on the second floor] YEEAAAAAGGHH! [hits the snow hard]
[South Park Community Center, Night, Shameless America Charity Event. Guests arrive in limousines. Gerald steps out of one and goes inside. Randy is hosting. Fanfare plays]
RANDY
Alright everyone, thanks for coming to help raise money to stop shaming, and put hamsters through college.
GUEST
What'd he say?
RANDY
And now, a woman who knows about shaming firsthand, supermodel Gigi Hadid.
GIGI
Alright, everyone enjoying themselves? How's that filet mignon? [approving comments all around] You know, we're all here for a really important reason. Because everyone should-
STEPHEN
Randy, Randy, we've got a problem.
RANDY
What?
STEPHEN
Reality's here. He's trying to crash the party.
RANDY
Reality? Who let him in? Shit! [leaves to face him]
REALITY
[making a nuisance of himself at a table, spills a glass of wine] Woo, nice wine, huh? What do you think of that? [tips another glass over] You know what I think of your pretty flowers? [grabs the centerpiece bouquet and throws it to the ground, then dumps a guest's dinner on his lap] There you go. How do you like that? [Randy and Stephen arrive]
RANDY
Alright buddy, let's go.
REALITY
I shit on all of you!
RANDY
Seagal?! [Steven Seagal approaches with gun drawn and aimed at Reality]
REALITY
[to Seagal, Randy, and three guests] Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you! [jumps over the table and rushes the stage, then grabs the mic from Gigi Hadid] Give me that, you stupid bitch! [she walks off] What a lovely charity event. I suppose you're all feeling pretty good about yourselves, hm? What have you done? You've raised $300 by spending half a million on filet mignon and crystal glasses. [crowd is silenced and ashamed at themselves] Look at you, Vin Dipshit. You think fat-shaming is wrong, so in response you show off your abs. You're the one fat-shaming, idiot! What's the matter with you people?! You're saaad that people are meeean? Well I'm sorry, the world isn't one big liberal arts college campus! We eat too much; we take our spoiled lives for granted, feel a little bad about it sometimes! No, you wanna put up all your shit on the Internet and have every single person say "Hooray for you!" Fuck you. You're all pricks. And I've got news for you! While you've all been sitting here trying to feel good, the little boy who sucked all your shit is about to die from it!
SEAGAL
What?
[Hell's Pass hospital, later. Butters is in a recovery room with tubes going into him and wires attached to him. Steven Seagal and Vin Diesel are there with the plus-sized models, Demi Lovato, Gigi Hadid, PC Principal, Stephen, and others]
DEMI LOVATO
Oh my God. What have we done?
SEAGAL
Jesus, I d-I didn't even think.
PC PRINCIPAL
I guess... I asked too much of one kid.
RANDY
Listen, everybody. [the group splits in two so the camera can see him] I think there's a way to try and make this right for everyone.
[A third commercial. We're back in the poor community. "Amazing Grace" plays with an organ, and a choir joins in later]
RANDY
To date, Shameless America has raised over $40,000. With that money, we are putting more and more iPads into these people's hands. [all the kids look at the iPads, not sure what to do with them] With iPads, these people can finally help more Americans get rid of negativity on their social media. [Jojo returns with an iPad, handing it to Randy] Oh, thanks Jojo. I'm shame-free now, and you can be too. For just $1 a day, one of these beautiful children will protect you from trolls and make your Internet a safe space. [a screen pops up with "We won't rest until America is #completelyshameless"] We won't rest until America is completely shameless. The world can be brutal, but Shameless America is going to continue to take steps to make sure everyone has a safe space... forever.
[South Park Town Square, day. The stage is set for a hanging. Reality has a noose around his neck, and Butters is set to be the executioner. Butters is out of the hospital with a head brace and a crutch]
BUTTERS
Are you sure this is a good idea?
RANDY
Uh huh. [Butters pulls the lever and the trap door opens underneath Reality, making him drop and hang. After some choking, Reality dies and the crowd erupts in cheers]
End of Safe Space

synopsis:The Asian girls in school are drawing dreamy pictures of Tweek and Craig.

script:Tweek x Craig

[South Park Elementary Gym, day. PC Principal is once again addressing the students in the gym.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright, everyone, listen up. [Wendy reads through some cue cards at the podium. Behind her is a projection screen showing the text, "Celebrate our Asian-American STUDENTS!"] Today we're going to be showing you some art from our Asian-American students-DAMMIT, LESLIE, SHUT YOUR FUCKING PIE-HOLE! [Leslie is shown, but she's confused, as she's not talking to anyone.] from our Asian-American students presented by our student-body president, Wendy Testaburger.
WENDY
Hey, guys. As you know, we have several new students here at South Park Elementary. We have been getting to know some of the Asian girls who have introduced us to an art style called "yaoi." [On the projection screen, the text reads "YAOI" and below it, in Japanese text, "BOIZU RABU" (Boys Love), with a pink platycodon in the background. Oriental music begins to play as Wendy cycles through yaoi images on the screen.] Yaoi is a blend of emotion and beauty involving two people whose love is looked down upon. The art tries to show that all love is magical, like in Lisa Akimoto's piece, "Tweek and Craig - Forbidden Love." [Tweek and Craig in a French kiss.]
GIRLS
Awwww.
TWEEK
What?
WENDY
Kelly Zhou goes a bit more whimsical with "Craig and Tweek: Moonlight Dance." [Tweek wears a pink bow in his hair and is wrapped in a pink ribbon while Craig stands behind him looking down at his face.]
GIRLS
Awwww.
CRAIG
Dude, what the fuck?
WENDY
In yaoi art, the seme, or "top", is usually dominating the uke, or "bottom", as demonstrated in Heather Nishimura's "Boizu Rabu." [Craig reaching down into Tweek's briefs as Tweek reaches up to stroke Craig's head]
GIRLS
Awwww. [Stan and Kyle look at each other]
WENDY
But yaoi can branch out to other things as well...
CARTMAN
Uh oh.
WENDY
...as we see here in "Lily, Frog, Tweek and Craig." [Tweek is on his back with only an unbutton shirt and looking away, while Craig is on top of him pinning him down and looking into his eyes. Above them is a lily flower and frog.]
[The hallway, after the assembly. Shown are David, Tolkien, Stan, Butters, still in his head brace, Kyle, Kenny, and Jimmy, standing in a semi-circle.]
STAN
I just don't get it. I mean, Tweek and Craig aren't gay. Right?
KYLE
[questioning, seeking confirmation] No. We would know.
BUTTERS
Well, but then why would Asian girls draw them like that?
JIMMY
Yeah, what is this yaoi thing all about? I am so c-c-c-confused.
STAN
And if it can happen to Tweek and Craig... could it happen to any of us?
[The school lobby. Eight Asian girls sit on the steps drawing. Craig sees them and approaches them]
CRAIG
Uhh, excuse me, why are you doing this?? [holds up a picture of himself pushing Tweek on a swing, and Tweek enjoying it]
GIRL 1
"Oh, hi, Craig. 오늘 다른 셔츠 입었네. (He's wearing a different shirt today.) [looks at the girl on her right and addresses her]
GIRL 2
잠바 밑에 어떻게 알아? (How do you know what's underneath his jacket?)
CRAIG
What? Well what did she say?
GIRL 3
I don't know, that was Korean. I'm Japanese.
TWEEK
[Over caffeinated] What is going on, huh? Huh? Me and him aren't together. Why is this happening?!
GIRL 1
[girl 1 addresses the girl to her left] 지금 크렉이 같이 있어줘야 하는데". [(Craig should be along with Tweek.)]
TWEEK
Everyone thinks I'm gay! What if my parents find out! Huh!
[PC Principal's Office. Craig and Tweek are seated across from PC Principal and Mr. Mackey]
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright, guys, I know there have been a lot of rumors flyin' around. Just wanted to check in, see if you have any questions for me.
CRAIG
Why are the Asian girls drawing pictures of us being gay?
PC PRINCIPAL
What's wrong with being gay? Nothin' wrong with that.
CRAIG
But we aren't! I'm not!
TWEEK
I'm not either!
PC PRINCIPAL
That is completely irrelevant! Okay? What matters, and the reason I brought you in here, is that you understand affirmative consent.
TWEEK
What's that?
PC PRINCIPAL
IF there is a romantic relationship here, you have to make sure your partner is comfortable with any sexual exploration.
TWEEK
Gah!
PC PRINCIPAL
Now in a gay relationship it gets a little trickier, but you still have to follow some guidelines, alright?
CRAIG
But I'm not gay!
PC PRINCIPAL
I don't care about that, bro! Tweek, if, and I'm only saying if, at some point you wanted to touch Craig's penis, you can't just go grabbin' for it. Alright? You need to say something like "Craig, is it alright with you if I touch your penis?" Okay? Let's try it out.
TWEEK
NO!
PC PRINCIPAL
You want two weeks' detention instead?! This shit's important!
TWEEK
Craig, can I touch your penis?
PC PRINCIPAL
Okay, good. Now, Craig, you might say "You may touch my penis. I'm comfortable with that.". [Craig isn't happy with that line and waits for more] Or of course you could say "No, you may not touch my penis at this time.".
CRAIG
No, you may not!
PC PRINCIPAL
Okay. Now we're getting somewhere. Now, Craig, what would you say if you wanted to take a gander at Tweek's asshole?
[The Marsh house. Randy looks inside the fridge for something to drink. He gets a bottle of gluten-free PBR. Sharon walks up to him]
SHARON
Randy, you should have a talk with Stan.
RANDY
For what?
SHARON
I guess something happened at school today involving two of Stan's friends,.. being gay?
RANDY
What?
SHARON
Yeah. Stan seems really perplexed.
RANDY
Wow. Our town has only had a Whole Foods for three weeks and we already have our first gay kids. So cool. [smiles to himself]
SHARON
Go talk to him, Randy, and be delicate.
[Stan's room, afternoon. Randy knocks on the open door softly, then walks in.]
RANDY
Hey, bud. How's it hangin'? [sits on the bed next to Stan]
STAN
I'm confused, Dad. There was this thing at school.
RANDY
Well, guess what? You've got a really progressive PC dad who knows all about this stuff, okay? Go ahead, ask me anything.
STAN
I just don't understand how it's decided.
RANDY
Ah, well, you see, it's a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences.
STAN
No, I mean, like, what makes the Asians decide who they're gonna make gay?
RANDY
[confused] The Asians? The Asians decide who's going to be gay? [feigns knowing, playing it off] Uh are y-, yeah, yeah they do. Uh, the Asians just, you know, the Asians pick who they pick, and um, it's al- it's, the way it's always been.
STAN
So you've heard of yaoi?
RANDY
[embarrassed, playing it off] Yeah, of course. Yaoi, anal intercourse, Maui Zaui, I, I know all this stuff, Stan.
[Shi Tpa Town, day, Whole Foods. Gerald and Sheila run into Thomas in the store.]
GERALD
Oh, hey, Thomas! Hey, we heard about Craig. We think it's just terrific.
THOMAS
[turns around] What about Craig? [Stephen comes up behind him]
STEPHEN
Thomas! I'm so glad that Craig is finally happy. [aloud to the other shoppers] Hey, it's Craig's dad, everybody. [shoppers around the store clap]
[The Tweek house. Tweek and his parents are having dinner. Tweek is twitching quite a bit and Richard notices]
RICHARD
Tweek's out of coffee, honey.
MRS. TWEEK
Oh, here you go, kiddo. [fills Tweek's cup]
RICHARD
Tweek, is there anything you want to talk to us about?
TWEEK
No.
RICHARD
[slowly] Well, we heard that you're gay. And I want you to know we've never been so proud of you.
TWEEK
Oh God. [lets his head hit the table, smashing into all of his food]
RICHARD
We thought you were just a spaz, but to know that you've got so much going on inside.
MOM
We're so proud of you, Tweek.
TWEEK
AAaaagh!
RICHARD
Knowing what I know now, I'm gonna be a much better dad to you. In fact, I just, I just want to give you some money, Tweek. [pulls out his wallet and then some bills] Can I give you some money? [Tweek looks up with mashed potatoes covering parts of his face] Here, I I love you so much, son. [hands Tweek the bills]
["The Book of Love" begins to play, and here's the montage: Tweek stares at the ceiling while in bed. So does Craig. Neither of them can sleep. Nor can Stan, and he rolls from one side to the other. Next day, one of the Asian girls is drawing. Next night, Thomas can't sleep. Following day Craig walks along and sees Tweek, who is looking at a wall. They look at each other, then at the wall, which turns out to be on one side of the school. On the wall is a large mural of Craig and Tweek in embrace. They turn around, then walk their separate ways. Next is an outdoor art fair at the Whole Foods parking lot with art from the Asian girls at school. All of it is of Craig and Tweek in various poses. The Broflovski's and Marshes are enjoying it. The Stotch's buy a print. Mayor McDaniel's leafs through a bunch of Tweek x Craig pictures she has in a folder, then she looks at a picture of a man with a mustache. She smiles at it. Next is more fan art of Craig and Tweek, and finally we get to Cartman in bed]
CARTMAN
[thinking] Dude, Tweek and Craig. It's just so weird. If they've been gay this whole time, have they been checking me out? I'm pretty sure Craig has seen my wiener. Should I kick his ass?
CUPID ME
[flits in out of nowhere] Aw, come on. What's wrong with two guys liking each other?
CARTMAN
I just don't understand it, Cupid Me. Wanting to like, kiss a dude?
CUPID ME
But if love is love, then it takes form in all shapes and sizes. Teehee.
CARTMAN
I guess, just because I don't understand it doesn't mean I shouldn't support it. Alright. Maybe you can help them along.
CUPID ME
Really? Can I?
CARTMAN
Yes, Cupid Me. Make it quick, and don't let anyone see you.
CUPID ME
Oh thank you! I won't! [floats out and away, giggling all the while.]
[Craig's room. Craig is sound asleep, wearing his cap. Cupid Me flits in]
CUPID ME
You just need a little spark of magic. [shoots an arrow into Craig's head.] And now I'm gonna pee in your mouth. [does so and giggles] Love is in the air. [squeezes a last bit of pee out]
[Cartman's bathroom. Cartman is on the toilet doing something on his phone. Cupid Me returns.]
CARTMAN
Did you do it, Cupid-Me?
CUPID ME
I hit him with my love arrow, and then I peed in his mouth just for fun.
CARTMAN
[laughs] That's awesome! [chuckles as Cupid-Me flits to his left side] That's so sweet.
CUPID ME
I thought you might like that.
CARTMAN
Yeah, dude. You're hilarious.
CUPID ME
And do you think I'm cute, too? 'Cause I think you're kind of cute.
CARTMAN
[his smile vanishes] Stop that, Cupid Me. I told you I'm not homosexual, okay? It's not funny.
CUPID ME
Oh, well, at least Tweek and Craig are in love now. [flits away]
CARTMAN
Yep. School tomorrow should be really interesting.
[South Park Elementary, day, hallway. Stan is talking to Kyle, who is switching out books in his locker.]
STAN
And so my dad talked to me about it.
KYLE
Yeah?
STAN
And my dad said that Asians have always done this, and they, like, do make people gay.
CARTMAN
[runs up to them] You guys! You guys, hurry!
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
It's, It's Tweek and Craig, dude! They're about to have sex! [runs off. Stan and Kyle follow.]
[At the intersection of two hallways, a crowd has gathered around Tweek and Craig.]
CRAIG
Got a fuckin' problem, man?! [pushes Tweek back]
TWEEK
You're the one with the fuckin' problem! [pushes Craig back]
CRAIG
I told you to stay a hundred yards from me!
TWEEK
You'd better not fuckin' push me again, man!
CARTMAN
Oh-ho come on, you guys. Get a room. [Craig and Tweek start fighting. Soon Cartman grabs onto Kevin for support]
[PC Principal's office, day. He's got the phone receiver in one hand, a hand grip in the other]
PC PRINCIPAL
Hello, Mr. Tucker. I need to inform you that your son was in an altercation at school today.
THOMAS
[at his office.] Craig? Craig got in a fight? [grins]
PC PRINCIPAL
Yes, with his boyfriend. Just a lovers' quarrel, probably. [Craig and Tweek are seated opposite]
CRAIG
Goddammit!
PC PRINCIPAL
Something to be expected in relationships. Apparently there were no affirmative consent issues, as your son knows the right way to play with another boy's penis.
THOMAS
Oh God!... [facepalm]
PC PRINCIPAL
There's not gonna be any disciplinary action since they are gay. We wanna be supportive, so we're just gonna send them on home with some money, alright? Alright, you have a nice day.
THOMAS
Money?
[The Forbidden City, China, day. A woman walks into an office and addresses someone in there. The camera pans left to show the president of the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping. Apparently, it's a call for him, and he answers his phone]
XI JINPING
Wei? Ni hao [(Hello? Who is there?)]
RANDY
[on the other end, in his study] Uh, hi, Mr. Jinping. Thanks for taking my call, I was... just wondering if you could shed some light on how your people decide who will be gay and who will be straight.
XI JINPING
What?
RANDY
[sighs] I'm sorry, I-I don't speak Asian, but... um, oh uh, oh, y-yao, yaoi. Yaoi, yes? Boizu rabu. Huh, how does that work?
XI JINPING
That-a come from-a Japan.
RANDY
Oh, it's Japan that decides? [Stan walks into the study.] How the hell do they actually make people geh-? [notices Stan] Aaaa-a-ah, Japan. Of course, is who does the yaoi to make people gay.
XI JINPING
They are dogs! [pounds his desk with his left fist] who refused, and not apologized, to the Chinese republic!
RANDY
Uh huh, yes, that of course I do already know about homosexuality.
[Cartman's house, day. Cartman is browsing the Web on his phone. The doorbell rings and Liane goes to the front door to answer it]
DELIVERY MAN
Hi, flower delivery for Eric Cartman? [Cartman hears this and looks over]
LIANE
Oh my, how beautiful. [signs for the flowers and takes them to Cartman] Oh, look, sweetie, someone sent you flowers.
CARTMAN
[sets his phone down, takes the bouquet, and reads the attached note.] "Can't we just try? Tee Hee." Oh man.
LIANE
Who are they from, hon?
CARTMAN
Someone who needs a real talking to.
[At the buffet restaurant. Cartman and Cupid Me are in a booth]
CARTMAN
Look, it's flattering, okay? But it doesn't change the fact that there's nothing here for you to keep pursuing.
CUPID ME
Teeheehee. Aw, come on, let's be like Tweek and Craig. Everyone thinks they're kewl.
CARTMAN
You are wasting your time. I'm not attracted to guys.
CUPID ME
But I'm so attracted to you.
CARTMAN
I realize that, but I'm sorry. I need you to stop bothering me. [the smile leaves Cupid Me's face. Cartman's voice gets quieter] This... is done. I'm just not a homosexual. [dejected, Cupid Me goes limp in mid-air.]
[The Tweek house, day. The doorbell rings and Richard goes to answer it. Craig is just outside.]
RICHARD
Well, hello Craig. Honey, it's Craig.
MOM
Awww, hi Craig.
CRAIG
Is Tweek home?
RICHARD
He sure is. Come on in. [holds the door open for Craig. From his house, Randy gives Richard a thumbs up. Richard returns the gesture and closes the door, then joins Mrs. Tweek and Craig in the middle of the living room] Would you like to have some coffee, Craig?
CRAIG
No, thank you, I just want to see Tweek.
MOM
Awww.
RICHARD
Tweek's just up in his room playing. You can go on up. [Craig starts going upstairs] Oh, uh, but keep the door open, alright? [Craig gets mad at the insinuation. Richard says to his wife] They're so gay.
[Tweek's room, moments later. Tweek is trying to put some Lego's together, but it's frustrating for him. He drinks more coffee. Craig enters the room.]
CRAIG
Hey dude. [this makes Tweek spit out his coffee, and he gets off his chair]
TWEEK
No, no! What are you doing here? [keeps his distance]
CRAIG
Tweek, calm down. We have to put a stop to this.
TWEEK
There's no stopping it! The whole world wants me to be something I'm not!
CRAIG
Me too, dude! But there's something we can do.
TWEEK
What??
CRAIG
We have to come out and say we're gay.
TWEEK
What?! Are you insane?! The way everyone-!
CRAIG
Wait. Wait! Because if we're gay, we can break up. And if we break up, no more pictures! We just have to stage a fake breakup in front of the Asian girls.
TWEEK
Like acting? No man, that is way too much pressure! I'll fail-
CRAIG
You can do it, Tweek! You're capable of more than you think.
TWEEK
Agh. I'm a terrible actor.
CRAIG
You just follow my lead, and try and make it believable, okay?
TWEEK
Oh gah-okay. Oh God!
[Skeeter's Wine Bar, day. Thomas Tucker is at the bar with Skeeter and Darryl Weathers.]
THOMAS
What did I do wrong, huh? Everyone's so damned happy, but... but why did this have to happen to my son?! What did I do to make my son like this?
RANDY
Hey, hey, whoa, you didn't do anything.
THOMAS
Oh, what? You know about this?
RANDY
Yeah, let me handle thisk guys, I'm PC. Look, Thomas, you need to understand that being gay isn't a decision. You know, a lot of people think that Asians decide who's gay and who's not. But it isn't all Asians, it's just specifically the Japanese, okay?
THOMAS
What?
RANDY
[turns around] Why do the Japanese make some people gay and others not? [turns around again] Well, it all goes back to World War II, and atrocities that happened in China called the Rape of Don King.
SKEETER
Hey, you sure know a lot about this.
RANDY
Yes I do.
[The school hallway, at that moment. The same seven boys are gathered there again]
KYLE
No, dude, I looked it up. Yaoi is just an art style for girls by girls because they like fictionalizing two guys in a relationship.
STAN
But why?
KYLE
I don't know. But the point is, there's nothing about it that means Tweek and Craig are actually gay, at all.
[The school lobby, later. The Asian girls are back on the steps, and three of them are smiling. Tweek walks past them and stops when he hears someone calling him]
CRAIG
Hey, Tweek! Hold up. Listen, it's just not going to work. [the smiles vanish]
TWEEK
What? Why not? [Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Davíd, and Butters arrive]
CRAIG
I'm sorry, Tweek, but we can't lie to ourselves anymore. [turns to face the gathering crowd of kids] Yes, we are gay, but we do not belong together.
TWEEK
We don't belong together? What suddenly changed, Craig?
CRAIG
It's just that people are different. That's all.
TWEEK
Uh huh. And who the hell is Michael?! Huh?! You wanna tell me that?! [jaws begin to drop]
CRAIG
What? What are you, what are you talking about?
TWEEK
I went through your phone when we went out last night, Craig! I saw your texts to Michael about hooking up with him!
CRAIG
Wait, uh, that's, that's not what happened.
TWEEK
Oh, it's not?
CRAIG
No. [tries to get Tweek back on track] Uh, look, we both know this is for the better.
TWEEK
Oh, don't use that lame shit on me, man! You don't wanna feel bad, so you try and tell me what I want?
CRAIG
Wait, don't make me out to be the bad guy here.
TWEEK
[tears up, voice cracks] Noho, you're not the bad guy! You're never the bad guy, are you?! You, you just step on people and you use them!
CRAIG
[tries again] You're going too far, dude. This is like, totally not necessary.
TWEEK
Agh-I'm going too far?! What is wrong with you?
CRAIG
This wasn't part of the plan!
TWEEK
Well, guess what, Craig! Love doesn't follow a plan!
BUTTERS
Yeah!
TWEEK
[tears fill his eyes] I was totally wrong about you. I opened myself up and let you in. But you've got spikes, man. You've got spikes. [walks away. Before he goes off screen, he breaks out in a big grin.]
WENDY
[steps forward to Tweek's spot] Tweek. [glares at Craig, then follows Tweek concerned. Craig looks at the other kids, who glare at him and walk away. The Asian girls even leave their drawing tools behind]
CRAIG
Dude, seriously? Seriously?
["Say Something" begins to play. A rainy-day montage begins. First, the Tucker house. Laura is on the phone.]
LAURA
They... they broke up? [Thomas turns around and smiles at the news. He notices Craig walking up to the front door, head down, and lets him in. He notices Craig's mood and his smile disappears.]
[The montage continues. The mural on the side of the school begins to smear. An Asian girl cries as she draws something new - Tweek and Craig with their backs to each other, with some distance between them. Tweek walks through the hallway grinning at first, but his smile vanishes when he notices how sad the other kids look. The outdoor art fair is still open on a rainy day. Most of the art now has an angry Craig and a dejected Tweek on it. One piece has Craig talking to a new boy while Tweek looks in from outside, and another has Craig pushing pins into a Tweek plush as if it were a voodoo doll. Next, Cupid Me looks in from outside as Cartman is asleep in bed. Cupid Me flits away. Gerald and Sheila replace a happy Craig x Tweek painting with a breakup one. Stan is shown sad on his bed, while Sharon is shown sad in the kitchen. Randy appears at the doorway and opens his mouth to say something, but decides against it and walks away. Mayor McDaniels is at her husband's grave. Richard Tweek is crying at the dining room table and his wife tries to console him. Tweek picks in from the kitchen]
[Ruffians Gay Bar, day. Some men are playing pool, two others chat next to the jukebox. Cartman walks in, scans the room, and walks up to the bar]
CARTMAN
What are you doing? This place isn't you. [Cupid Me is shown, with a mug of beer an empty scotch glass, and an ashtray full of cigarette butts.]
CUPID ME
I'm just here to pick up on guys. Why? are you jealous?
CARTMAN
No I'm not. I'm here because we need you right now.
CUPID ME
Oh, now you need me, huh? Fuck you, dude.
CARTMAN
Fuck you.
MAN 1
What is that kid doing here?
MAN 2
He's just kind of talking to himself.
CARTMAN
The whole town is sad. Cupid Me, you have to help.
CUPID ME
Well, I guess I could try now, in return for just... one date?
CARTMAN
[hushed shouting] I'm not homosexual!
CUPID ME
Then I guess I'm not interested.
CARTMAN
Ugh. Alright, one date. But only if you help get Tweek and Craig back together.
CUPID ME
Teeheehee! Teeheeheeheehee!
BARTENDER
Hey, kid, what do you think you're doing here?
CARTMAN
Oh, hey, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa. I'm not here for me, I'm here for my friend, okay? [the bartender doesn't see any friend with him]
[The Tucker house, day. The doorbell rings and Thomas arrives to answer it. Tweek is just outside]
TWEEK
Hi, is Craig here, sir?
THOMAS
Why can't you quit him? [begins to close the door-]
LAURA
Thomas!
THOMAS
[lets Tweek in] Five minutes. He's in the back. [Tweek goes on in and goes out the sliding door in back. Craig is working on his bicycle.]
TWEEK
Hey, dude.
CRAIG
What do you want?
TWEEK
I thought when we broke up everything would get better. I was thinking maybe we should say we're back together.
CRAIG
Dude, I'm not gay and neither are you!
TWEEK
What does that have to do with anything?
CRAIG
You think you can just pull that shit you pulled at school, saying I step on people and use them?! And I'll just take you back?
TWEEK
You said to make it seem real.
CRAIG
Not that real! Now everyone thinks I'm a manipulative cheater! I'll never get any chicks!
TWEEK
I'm so sorry, Craig. You, you made me believe in myself in a way I never have before. I didn't think I had any of that in me, but... you were right. I can do more than I think. You... changed something in me and I just... I wanna fix whatever's hurting you now. [Thomas, who's been looking out the window, begins to cry]
CRAIG
I can't be something because everyone wants me to be. I have to be myself. You'll just have to go be gay with someone else.
TWEEK
Alright Craig. Alright. [turns left and walks away]
[The Tucker House]
THOMAS
I can see how much they're both hurting, but... Can't you understand that in my time we just didn't accept this? [rests his head on his left hand] Maybe it's not so wrong, I, I just don't want it to be my son. [Cupid Me flits in and giggles]
CUPID ME
You just need a little prick of magic. [shoots an arrow into Thomas' head] And I'll pee in your mouth a little bit. [follows through]
THOMAS
Then again, he's my son no matter what. I can't just shut down on him.
CUPID ME
Teeheeheehee, teeheeheehee. [flits away. Moments later, Thomas shows up at Craig's bedroom door. Craig is on his bed, sad]
THOMAS
[enters] Son, you need to listen to me. [sits down on the bed] You can't fight being gay. I used to think that being gay was a choice, but, you don't get to decide. Japan picks who they pick, and that's that. I don't understand this stuff. Heck, I didn't even know Don King got raped, but... I do know that if you try and resist it, you make yourself miserable your whole life. Everyone was so proud of you, Ah I was just being selfish. I wanna be proud of you too. I like gay Craig. I love you. Here's a hundred dollars. [puts the bill in Craig's hand and walks out the door]
[Shi Tpa Town. Soft piano music plays in the background. Tweek walks with his head down near City Wok. Eventually he and Craig cross paths. They both stop and look at each other. Craig then turns towards the same direction that Tweek is facing and extends his left hand out. After some hesitation, Tweek takes his hand and they walk in the same direction. They eventually walk past Whole Foods where Randy and Mr. and Mrs. Testaburger notice them and cheer them on.]
JAPANESE SINGER
Maybe we should go away.
Put cares aside for just a day.
[At the crosswalk in front of Dee's Meats, Tweek and Craig continue holding hands as they enter the crosswalk. Tolkien is shocked while his parents as well as The Stotches look on with a smile and approval]
[Brofloski residence. Gerald and Sheila meet in front of a painting of Tweek and Craig, and hold hands]
JAPANESE SINGER
The world we face is a-not so big.
Not if we are strong like Tweek and Craig.
[Marsh residence, kitchen. Sharon is washing dishes. Randy comes up behind her and gives her a bouquet of flowers. In the background, the sound of drums now accompany the piano.]
JAPANESE SINGER
Hontou ni sakana ga oishii ["The fish is really delicious"]
[Footage of Assassin's Creed Syndicate is shown on a television set. Craig is playing the video game while Tweek is next to him on the couch and talking.]
JAPANESE SINGER
Let's go back to when it was new.
Weren't we such happy peopleru?
[Outside the house, several adults look through a window and smile at Craig and Tweek as they continue to play and talk]
JAPANESE SINGER
Life was simple,
problems vague.
[City Hall. The Mayor is at her desk. She looks at a picture frame of her deceased husband, then holds it against her chest.]
JAPANESE SINGER
We had it all,
a lot like Tweek and Craig.
[South Park Elementary, hallway. Heads turn as Craig and Tweek walk through the hallways hand in hand. Stan, Kyle and Butters are visibly shocked, while Leslie Meyers smiles at the couple.]
[Akihabara, Japan, evening. A view of the evening sky and neon lit buildings is shown. Inside a karaoke bar, the Japanese singer is revealed to be a businessman, who is singing on a stage in front of other office workers. Behind him are monitors showing live action footage of Tweek and Craig, with Craig offering Tweek some flowers. The lyrics are shown below at the bottom of the screen]
JAPANESE SINGER
And in the darkness we all seek
A perfect love like Craig and Tweek.
[Live action footage of Tweek and Craig is shown on screen. They are walking around, hand in hand, in a field. They pull each other in and eventually hug. Then, they sit on a tree branch, with Tweek resting his head on Craig's shoulder. The lyrics are shown at the bottom of the screen in karaoke style]
JAPANESE SINGER
We must fight or love's a goner.
We must hold Tweek and Craig with the...[music stops]
[Tucker residence. An overhead shot of Thomas and Laura asleep on their bed. He is suddenly awoken by the sound of the Japanese singer yelling in Japanese and looks around the room]
JAPANESE SINGER
...highest honor!
Ganbarou! ["Let's give it our all!"]
Irasshai! ["Welcome!"]
[China. Xi Jinping is sitting at his desk and smiling at his female secretary. Suddenly, he gets up and they passionately kiss. The piano music resumes.]
JAPANESE SINGER
I hope you know when you are down
[Stotch residence, Butter's bedroom. Butters is at his computer, Skyping with Charlotte]
JAPANESE SINGER
That you turned my life around.
Just like the quote from Shakespeare said
[Cartman residence, Eric's room. The camera slowly pans down to a naked Eric laying down on his stomach atop of his bed.]
JAPANESE SINGER
I'm your Tweek, [slowing]
and you're my Craig.
CARTMAN
[in bed, moaning in a rhythmic fashion] Okay, okay, the date's almost over.
CUPID ME
[pops up behind Cartman] Teeheehee. Aren't you liking your massage?
CARTMAN
It's fine. It just doesn't really do anything for me.
CUPID ME
Well, I've got something you might like a little better. [goes back behind Cartman... and under...]
CARTMAN
Cu- Cupid Me, no! No, I'm straight!
CUPID ME
Teeheeheehee!
CARTMAN
Cupid Me, what are you doing?! Oh my God! [next, he's in the bathroom. Liane walks past, but stops to listen in] Oh Cupid Me, that's enough! Okay, that's it, Cupid Me! That's it! [Liane opens the door and sees Cartman masturbating furiously on the toilet] That's it, Cupid Me. Okay, that's it. That's it, Cupid Me. [Liane closes the door]
LIANE
Awww.
End of Tweek x Craig

synopsis:The citizens of South Park decide they no longer need a police force in town.

script:Naughty Ninjas

[South Park, day. Two police officers are patrolling the town in their vehicle]
SGT. YATES
Attention all units in the vicinity of South Park Elementary! [the officers pay attention] We have a code red! [units begin showing up] Principal calling for help during school assembly! All officers needed at once!
OFFICER BARBRADY
[in his patrol car eating a sub sandwich and drinking soda] The school? [puts down his food and starts the motor] Oh Jeez Louise! [turns his siren on and drives off. More units arrive at the school, even heavily-armed SWAT officers. They all arm themselves. Barbrady runs into one of the other cars]
SGT. YATES
[to the assembled officers] We need to get to the gym! Half go this way, half go around the side! Barbrady, you go around back! [the officers disperse. Barbrady goes into the school and finds empty hallways. He stops for a moment and one can hear him pant. He barges into the Fourth Grade classroom and finds it deserted. He goes through the school lobby and finds no one.]
OFFICER 1
On 3 1... 2... [Instead of getting to 3, the officers enter the gym with their weapons drawn. More cops enter from the other end.]
PC PRINCIPAL
There she is, officers, right there. I told you to stop chatting with your friend, didn't I, Leslie? You [Leslie looks at him, bewildered] see, officers, apparently Leslie thinks that talking to her friends is more important than learning about diversity in third-world countries. [pulls out a laser pen light and lights Leslie up with it.] That one. That's her right there. You remove her from my school.
BARBRADY
[barges into the gym] Whoa! Nobody move! What's happening?
PC PRINCIPAL
Get her out of here! [the light from his pointer falls upon Barbrady]
BARBRADY
Oh, they've got me! [reflexively fires a shot, which hits a boy on the right shoulder]
BOY
AAAAAH!
PC PRINCIPAL
Waaaah!
[South Park City Hall, later. The Mayor, her aides, and two other people]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
This town is outraged, Officer Barbrady! People are tired of the police not being held accountable for their actions!
BARBRADY
Mayor, I didn't know if there was a gunman, or a bomb-
MAYOR MCDANIELS
You shot an unarmed six year old Latino child!
BARBRADY
I'm sorry.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
You're fired.
BARBRADY
No, Mayor, please. This is all I know. I used to be the only policeman in this town, remember? Bob, ah I used to chase away the sixth graders for you.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
You're from another time, Barbrady. And the last thing that needs to go. Your gun and your badge. [Barbrady takes them and lays them on the table] And your sunglasses.
BARBRADY
[emotional] No, please, not my sunglasses.
JOHNSON
You're done, Barbrady! The town doesn't want you here! [reluctantly, Brabrady takes off his sunglasses and lays them on the table.]
BARBRADY
Where should I go?
JOHNSON
You should have thought of that before you shot a Mexican!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Latino-American.
JOHNSON
Latino-American. [blinks hard] Shit.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
You should go away. You don't belong anywhere in a town as progressive as this one.
[SoDoSoPa, at Kenny's house. The mall and construction sites are still there, but the homeless have moved in. Kenny opens the door to take the trash out.]
HOMELESS MAN 1
[sleeping upstairs at the abandoned Steed] Aaay, quiet down over there, I'm tryin' to sleep.
STUART
[steps outside] Goddammit! You people all get out of here!
HOMELESS MAN 2
[sleeping upstairs at "Bi the garage"] What makes you in charge? [Karen appears at the living room window]
STUART
'Cause this is my fuckin' house!
HOMELESS MAN 3
[kicks a trashcan and walks over to him] Hey beat it, man, or I'll make you my bitch! [Karen screams. Stuart gets Kenny back inside and Karen leaves the window.]
[The McCormick living room. Stuart places a call as his family stands to one side watching him.]
STUART
Yeah, we've got a bunch of drunk-addict vagrants trespassing on our yard and we need assistance.
SGT. YATES
[in his office] Oh, is that so? Well, we'd like to come help you, but we don't wanna get fired.
STUART
What are you talkin' about? There's homeless people here and they're scarin' my kids! You need to come do somethin' about this!
SGT. YATES
I see. And are any of these homeless people of a minority persuasion?
STUART
Why does that matter?
SGT. YATES
Oh, it matters. See, it used be we could beat up minorities and nobody cared. It's the reason a lot of us joined the force. [lowers the phone a bit] Hey Mitch, you wanna go down and arrest some homeless people but not be able to beat up any minorities?
MITCH
No thank you.
SGT. YATES
Yeah, no, I think we're good. In fact, we're thinking of maybe turning the whole department into a hula school. Whattaya think?
STUART
God Dammit! [slams the phone down onto the base unit]
CAROL
What are they doing?
STUART
They're not coming!
CAROL
But they have to! Karen brought in one of their syringes, for Christ's sake!
STUART
Well that's just too bad! The cops won't come, so there's nobody to scare the homeless away!
[turns around and walks away. Kenny lowers his head and looks down and to the right]
[Officer Barbrady's apartment. He walks in and sets his sack lunch over the TV, then takes off his jacket and puts it on the coat rack]
BARBRADY
Hi, sweetheart. I've uh... I've been let go from the force. I'm so sorry.[an old dog raises its head and lets out a small groan. He walks over to it] Don't worry, old girl. [kneels down next to the dog and starts stroking it] It might be a little tough to afford your medication, but I'll find a way. You know me. I like to help. I like to be needed.
[Neighborhood park, day. Stan and Kyle are shooting hoops. Kyle takes a shot and misses. Cartman runs up to them.]
CARTMAN
You guys! Oh my God you guys! You guys, they're gay! [Butters catches up] They're totally gay!
STAN
Who?
CARTMAN
Kenny and Tolkien.
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
Kenny and Tolkien, dude. They're so gay. Butters told me.
KYLE
You're lying.
CARTMAN
No dude. In those old abandoned buildings around Kenny's house, Kenny and Tolkien turned it into a big ninja clubhouse. And they dress and play ninjas in it trying to scare people away.
KYLE
How is that gay?
CARTMAN
It's the gayest thing ever dude? Ninjas are fuckin' dumb! Dude, come one! We've gotta go see this!
BUTTERS
Over this way! [they all go have a look]
[SoDoSoPa, later. Two ninjas spring into view and go to two posts around the edge of the roof.]
TOLKIEN
We will defend our ninja honor! [spotting something over a crossbow] Intruders! Protect the base! [the four boys come into view] Hey guys, did you come to see our ninja fortress?
CARTMAN
[in hushed tones] Oh my God they're so gay you guys.
STAN
You and Kenny built all this?
TOLKIEN
Yeah, with Clyde and David too. [Clyde swings into view while David climbs up a rope.]
CLYDE
You guys should come and check it out.
CARTMAN
Ah, no, we're good, thanks. [in hushed tones] Oh my God this is a sausage party!
CLYDE
It's pretty cool, dude. People are scared of us.
CARTMAN
[sarcastically] Yeah, I'm sure they are. [a big truck stops in its tracks.]
DRIVER
Hey, excuse me, man, do you know where-? [Arabic music plays and the ninjas began showing off their moves.] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAAAAH! Look! AAAAH!
PASSENGER
Go, go, go! [the truck takes off. The four boys look on in wonder, Cartman walks into the street. The truck reaches the end of the block and hangs a left, and disappears]
CARTMAN
That's pretty cool.
[Skeeter's Wine Bar, evening. Skeeter serves up some wine]
GERALD
Well the way I heard it was that the girl in the school wasn't even doing anything. Just talking too loud. And someone ends up getting shot.
SKEETER
Hey! What you want?
BARKLEY
It's okay, I'm off duty. Just came in for a nice pinot.
PATRON
Yeah? Well go somewhere else, copper! CtPaTown is for people who care about each other!
SKEETER
We don't take kindly to folks who impose their authority on the underprivileged!
BARKLEY
Now look, not all cops are racist trigger-happy assholes.
RANDY
Really? I'll bet you don't even know what "farm to table" means. [Barkley stands there a moment and then walks out, letting the door slam shut. Bar patrons cheer and holler at their success]
RANDY
[steps forward] Wow. We've only had a Whole Foods for a month and already we don't need cops. So cool. [smiles]
[SoDoSoPa, day. Tolkien is giving a lesson.]
TOLKIEN
It is a great honor to see that you all want to be ninjas. Joining our club is very serious. You must promise to uphold the warrior's code. [Butters and Cartman, Stan and Kyle are now dressed as ninjas]
CARTMAN
Totally dude, ninjas are sweet.
TOLKIEN
Together we must strive to make our fortress super bad-ass and keep all intruders out! To that end, let us proceed to our training.
CARTMAN
[catches up to a ninja] Dude, can I talk to you for a minute? Listen, I don't think we should let Kyle be a ninja, okay? He said ninjas were gay. He's probably gonna try and turn it around on me, but that's 'cause Kyle knows I heard him.
KYLE
You're talking to Kyle right now.
CARTMAN
Yeah, cool... it's me, Butters.
KYLE
You're the one who said ninjas were gay. Why do you wanna make this a problem?
CARTMAN
I'm just, I'm just Butters, man. I have problems with lots of things.
BUTTERS
Hey Eric, you wanna try sparring with me?
CARTMAN
Yes I do, Butters. [kicks him in the nuts and walks away]
BUTTERS
OOF. Ow. Ahem.
CLYDE
Intruders! [two homeless men approach the fortress with filled grocery bags]
HOMELESS MAN 4
Yeah, it's right up here. We can shoot up in these abandoned buildings. [the ninjas, eight in all, appear before them and make a show of force. The men begin to confuse them for ISIS, drop their bags, and run away]
[A news break]
ANCHOR
The town of South Park is holding a large protest tonight outside of their police department. The townspeople say the protest is meant to begin a dialog about the relationship between law enforcement and the citizens they are supposed to protect.
[A montage begins to "Fuck the Police" playing in the background. The protest is shown, with everyone giving the middle finger to the cops. Even Fr. Maxi gives them the finger. Yates and his men look down from their second-story windows. Next, Whole Foods is shown. A shopper spots Officer Stevens and throws his cart right at him. Stevens turns around to see what hit him. The shopper feigns shock, then shrugs his shoulders and turns and walks away. Other shoppers laugh at his prank. Next is (vernacular), where a couple sits al fresco. They watch as Stevens sees his police car, now vandalized with "I'M A DOUCHE". Next is Officer Barbrady at home with his aged dog. Next, Sgt. Yates reads the South Park times. Its lead headline: NO TO PIGS! YES TO FREE-RANGE PORK. Next, two officers drive down a street when they spot someone. It's Randy in his bathrobe, standing outside, He shows off his cock and balls as the officers roll by slowly. ShiTpaTown is shown. Barbrady drops into a fast-food restaurant to look for work. The staff there quickly kicks him out. Two homeless men approach SoDoSoPa only to flee when they see the ninja kids swarming the place. Barbrady returns to find an eviction notice taped to his door. Randy reaches Whole Foods for some shopping, but finds a homeless man in his way sleeping on the sidewalk. Then he looks at Whole Foods and sees the parking area filled with homeless people]
[Channel 4 News segment.]
ANCHOR
Are your children being lured into terrorist organizations? A shocking report shows that some kids in the town of South Park are swearing loyalty to a murderous regime.
CARTMAN
Yeah, we're pretty bad-ass, and um, this is, like, our fortress, and you can see it's really cool.
REPORTER
And what about this way of life has attracted you?
BUTTERS
We're just cool 'cause we're tough, and we fight and stuff, and we can ah-.
CARTMAN
Yeah yeah yeah, and it's like, we can do whatever we want, and people are scared of us, it's totally rad!
STAN
Then why'd you say it was gay before?
CARTMAN
Oh my God! I never said it was gay!
TOLKIEN
Wait, he said this was gay?
CARTMAN
That is a total lie!! Why would I say anything homophobic about the way Tweek and Craig make love?! [points to Stan] He's a lying, backstabbing Jew!
STAN
I'm Stan.
ANCHOR
No doubt the growing number of kids swearing loyalty to ISIS could be problematic for the progressive town.
[Whole Foods, day. Barbrady takes his place among the homeless, up against an exterior wall.]
BARBRADY
[to his dog] Here you go, old girl. We'll just have to make do. [Randy exits the store with some groceries, but fails to notice Barbrady nearby]
RANDY
Ew. [keeps walking]
HOMELESS MAN 5
Spare a dollar?
RANDY
No I don't I'm sorry thank you Goddammit ew. [the Mayor and her aides survey the situation by Skeeter's Bar. Randy sees her and approaches] Mayor, I didn't bust my ass to gentrify this part of town to have it overrun with homeless people!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Why are they all suddenly coming here?
GERALD
[arrives with Sheila] Mayor, what are you going to do about this? My wife and I can barely eat or shop.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
When a town like ours has a homeless problem it must look at the root of what's causing it.
STEPHEN
[arrives with Linda] It's ISIS!
RANDY
What?
STEPHEN
They're these troubled kids who've turned their backs on America! They've taken over SoDoSoPa, forced all the homeless out!
GERALD
Why would kids in our town wanna be a part of that?
STEPHEN
They're just bad kids! Rotten on the inside! Probably with shitty parents!
[Jimmy's house. His parents are at the breakfast nook with him.]
RYAN
Son, I've always tried to be a fair dad. Eh I I don't want to meh make you angry, but... why?
JIMMY
Well Dad, I just re-really like being a part of something. I feel like it's character-building and it's lots of fun.
RYAN
Fun? But what do you... believe in?
JIMMY
What do we believe in? We believe in something greater than ourselves, and that by following our strict warrior code we believe that our faiths and our traditions are a way to a greater path - the p-p-p-path of the warrior. And as long as we stay united in honor we can defeat all our enemies. [this is beginning to freak Ryan out, so he screams and leaves the table as fast as he can.] Wow, the fellas were right. People are really freaked out by ninjas.
[Park County Police Station, day. Randy leads the city council to police headquarters on the second floor]
RANDY
Okay, we've just gotta be really apologetic and tell them we didn't mean it, okay?
GERALD
Jeez, this is so embarrassing.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
What if they won't help us with the homeless?
STEPHEN
I'm pretty sure the police will help out if it's because ISIS is taking over the town. [opens the double doors and leads the council in]
[Park County Holice Headquarters. The officers inside are all dancing slowly, gracefully, The city council is stunned]
STEPHEN
Officers, there's kids in town who have joined ISIS. We don't know who they are, but they-.
SGT. YATES
What? What's that, you say?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
The town is in danger, alright? We don't know what these kids are capable of.
SGT. YATES
Jeez, I'm sorry. We've got to work on our koholo kaloa, and get the lomi lomi chicken ready for the big ho'olao le'ao, which leaves us... oh, not enough time to deal with ISIS.
RANDY
Alright, look. There's homeless people all over our gentrified food and arts district. If you don't stop thewe twisted kids, then-
SGT. YATES
Hey, who was it that said "fuck the police"? Was that Ice Cube? Tupac? Oh, right, that was you guys! Sorry, but I guess you'll have to find somebody else to do all the difficult dirty shit you don't want to do yourselves. I've gotta be ready for the luau. I might even kiss a dude.
[Back at SoDoSoPa, the ninjas are going through exercises. Cartman and Butters talk]
CARTMAN
So then, after you told me, we went over to Kyle and Stan when they were playing basketball, remember?
BUTTERS
Yeah?
CARTMAN
And we said Kenny and Tolkien were playing ninjas, and Kyle said that ninjas were gay, and I said ninjas are gay, but it was a question. You remember?
BUTTERS
Uh I thought you said it first.
CARTMAN
No nonono, see? Now Kyle got everyone remembering it wrong because he doesn't wanna get kicked out of the group. That's what Jews do when they get caught in a lie. You cannot trust a Jewish ninja, Butters.
TOLKIEN
You guys! You guys!
STAN
What?
TOLKIEN
Actual Ninjas. Wanna talk to us.
CLYDE
What?
TOLKIEN
Kenny and I both just got the same email from people overseas.
CARTMAN
Whoa, dude.
STAN
How's they found out who we were?
CARTMAN
They're fuckin' ninjas, dude!
[At Bi the garage, a computer is set up for video conferencing. An ISIS leader appears on screen.]
ISIS LEADER
So, you are the brave children who have committed to our cause. We are aware of what you are doing and we are very impressed.
STAN
Cool. Thanks, dude.
ISIS LEADER
What you are doing is very important and we would like to help you however we can. We are going to be wiring you some money.
BUTTERS
Whoa, cool! Why, this is the greatest thing ever you guys!
CARTMAN
Ah, excuse me. Can I just set the record straight on something?
ISIS LEADER
Of course.
CARTMAN
Should Jews be trusted? [no response. A few seconds later...] Uh I mean, if one of us is a Jew, do you see that as being at all problematic?
ISIS LEADER
Extremely.
CARTMAN
YES! [dances away] YEEES! ["Can't Touch This" begins to play and Cartman does arm waves.] Oh—oh, oh—oh! Oh—oh, oh—oh! What did I tell you guys?
[Whole Foods, night. A closeup of Barbrady snoozing]
RANDY
[his shadow falls upon ex-Officer Barbrady] Hey Barbrady. [tries to wake him up] Officer Barbrady.
BARBRADY
Uh, who?
RANDY
Hey buddy. [flanking him are the Mayor and her aides, and the Stotches]
BARBRADY
What do you want?
JOHNSON
How would you like to be a policeman again?
BARBRADY
I'm no good as a policeman. I'm a bumbling old fool.
STEPHEN
That is not true! Who said that? Look, Barbrady, the fact is, the town needs you.
BARBRADY
They need me? To do what?
RANDY
We need you to shoot some kids. [smiles]
BARBRADY
No! Shoot kids? I don't wanna shoot kids!
RANDY
Shh! Shhh! Shhhh! These are really bad kids. Terrorists. This is totally different from before.
BARBRADY
No. No. Are any of them minorities?
AIDE
A couple of them, we think. Yeah.
BARBRADY
Noo no no no no no no no no!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Sh, look, look look, Barbrady, Barbrady! We were wrong about you. I... was wrong about you. You... protected this town back before anybody else ever did. You used to do it all on your own. We need you to do that again. [takes out his sunglasses from her inside coat pocket and hands them to him. He puts them on and his sadness disappears]
RANDY
You're the only cop this town needs, Barbrady. Go shoot those kids.
[SoDoSoPa, night. The ninjas are still going through exercises, but inside the abandoned Savor The Goodness store. Something is standing next to the punching bags]
CARTMAN
You guys, I know this is hard for all of us. But to truly be ninjas, we must face hard facts. Last night I spoke in private with our ninja leader overseas. We talked a long time about Jews and the Hebrew faith. He told me a lot I didn't know. And I was able to tell him some things he did not know. But after talking with that guy, it is abundantly clear to me that Jews cannot be ninjas. I went to Kyle's house to talk to him about it, and I found this. [pulls out a drawing of two ninjas, one of them having anal sex with the other one] It was then that Kyle confessed to me about how he had brainwashed Butters and Stan into thinking I had used a homophobic slur to refer to our organization. And he almost got away with it. That's when Kyle tried to kill me. Luckily I was the faster ninja. [reveals the, uh, guilty ninja, who's strapped into a chair and his ninja head covering is duck-taped over his face] Kyle knew I would never call ninjas gay. When I take the gag off, he's going to try and tell you that I'm lying now. Do not believe him. Kyle is a liar.
KYLE
I'm right here. [standing between Tolkien and Stan]
CARTMAN
[looks at the group, then at the bound ninja] Who, who is this?
STAN
That's Clyde.
CARTMAN
...and I am Tolkien. Why do I do these things, you ask? Black rage.
[Some moments later, Barbrady, now in uniform, makes it to SoDoSoPa and begins looking around. He drops down behind the vandalized station wagon.]
BARBRADY
Oh Jesus. ISIS, oh God.
[The Marsh house, dinner time. The Marshes are at dinner, except for Stan]
MARVIN
This chicken tastes like shit. What'd you do to it?
RANDY
Okay, okay Dad, it's not organic chicken. I'm not comfortable shopping at Whole Foods with all the homeless people there. But don't worry. That's all about to change. Soon we'll all have CtPaTown to enjoy again. Where's Stan?
SHARON
He's playing ninjas over at Kenny's house.
RANDY
Ninjas? That's gay. [remembers the ISIS warriors who took over SoDoSoPa] He's playing ninjas at Kenny's house?
SHARON
Yeah.
RANDY
You mean, SoDoSoPa?
SHARON
Uh huh.
RANDY
[begins to think this over] Wait a minute... Ninjas... [Oriental and Arabic music alternate in his head] ...scary... gay... Scary. Gay. Scary gay scary gay.
SHARON
Randy, what are you doing?
RANDY
Scary gay scary gay scary GAY. [runs out of the dining room] Staaaan!! [Shelly looks back at him]
[SoDoSoPa, night. The other ninjas replace Clyde with Cartman on the chair and tie him up.]
CARTMAN
Oh, I get the misunderstanding now. No, see, I told Clyde that Kyle said ninjas were gay, but Clyde thought I was Kyle, so then he was saying that I said ninjas were gay, meaning I as in Kyle.
KYLE
Nobody ever gave a shit, you fat pig!
TOLKIEN
All those in favor of Cartman being kicked out of our ninja club?
NINJAS
Hai!
CARTMAN
No! You CAN'T kick me out! I have to be a ninja! They hate Jews. I was made for this, you guys! Please!
STAN
What shall we do with him? [Barbrady climbs over a wall and quickly reaches the ninjas]
BARBRADY
[draws his gun] Freeze! [the ninjas turn around]
KYLE
Oh shit!
BARBRADY
[trembling in fear] Please, I don't wanna shoot you. [the ninjas back away]
STAN
Cool. Don't.
BARBRADY
Oh ho ho. [groans miserably and waves gun]
NINJAS
Aaahaah. [Cartman shuts his eyes and faces left]
BARBRADY
I understand you feeling angry at this town. I'm getting pretty angry too. But we can't give up on it. Please boys, don't make it end violently.
RANDY
[finds the ninjas and Barbrady] They're just stupid ninjas! [tackles Barbrady, who instinctively fires off a shot. David is struck.]
DAVID
Aaa!
BARBRADY
Aaahaahaaawe!
[City Hall, day. The Mayor, Randy, and the city council face Barbrady]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
What were you thinking?! Boys innocently playing ninja and you pull your gun on them?
AIDE
David Rodriguez was lucky to live!
BARBRADY
Everybody told me they were terrorists.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
We thought they were. But if it turns out they aren't, as a policeman, you have to figure that out!
BARBRADY
But, you said you needed me to kill some kids.
RANDY
Oh, he's gonna lay this on us now. I said kill some kids, but I said it as a question, remember? I said "Kill some kids?"
MAYOR MCDANIELS
I'm sorry, but we just can't cover your ass on this one. There's going to be an investigation and ... you just don't have what it takes to be a policeman in today's times.
JOHNSON
Do you even know what "farm to table" means? [Barbrady takes off his glasses and lays them on the table.]
[Whole Foods, day. The South Park Police Department is back on duty and taking the homeless away from ShiTpaTown]
BARKLEY
Let's go people, you can't stay here. You are being relocated.
HOMELESS MAN 6
Hey, you can't kick us out of here, man.
SGT. YATES
Oh no? I'm a cop.
RANDY
Thank you, officers.
SGT. YATES
We've got a deal, right?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Yes. [she and Randy turn away and XXX*what do they do*XXX]
SGT. YATES
Alright you, come on! [punches the homeless man in the face. Other officers take time to abuse the homeless people a little. One officer kicks a homeless man in the balls twice while another officer holds him, then the two officers take him away. A street sweeper rolls by collecting all the homeless who are still sleeping on the street, and even a few who are walking around]
HOMELESS MAN 6
Aaaah!
HOMELESS MAN 7
[being led away by an officer] Please! You can't take me back to SoDoSoPa! ISIS is there!
OFFICER 2
No, those were just ninjas. [they walk past the boys - Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny]
HOMELESS MAN 7
Ninjas? Oh, that's so gay.
CARTMAN
I told you guys. What did I tell you? I said ninjas are fuckin' gay but you didn't wanna listen, nooo!
[An interrogation room. Barbrady sits at a table with his dog to his left. A door opens and Barbrady looks up. An agent walks in with a folder, sits down, and sets the folder on the table]
AGENT
Officer Barbrady.
BARBRADY
Yes?
AGENT
We've been watching you. And what we see is a man who truly wants to protect his town.
BARBRADY
You do?
AGENT
You've been in this town longer than almost anyone. Have you noticed... changes... lately?
BARBRADY
Yeah, a lot of changes.
AGENT
They aren't a coincidence, officer. They are all part of a plan to take down your beloved town and everyone in it.
BARBRADY
What?
AGENT
What do you know about a little girl named... [takes out a picture and shows it to Barbrady] Leslie? [with PC Principal pushing her on the swing]
End of Naughty Ninjas

synopsis:Jimmy’s integrity as a newsman runs smack into PC Principal’s ideology.

script:Sponsored Content

[South Park Elementary, day. Kids are filing into school. Inside, they go to their lockers and switch out books.]
PC PRINCIPAL
[off-screen, but you can hear him slamming lockers shut] Who was it?! Somebody's about to get their asses kicked! [a bunch of kids run screen right.] When I find out who did this!
BUTTERS
[runs into view towards the other fourth graders] PC Principal is on the warpath! Run for your lives! [turns right and runs down another hallway]
STAN
[to Kyle] Again?
KYLE
Oh Jesus, now what?
PC PRINCIPAL
[appears at screen left and walks towards the fourth graders.] Who was it?! Huh?! Somebody better fess up RIGHT NOW! I'm gonna find out who did this! [Kyle closes his locker and begins to walk away. PC Principal notices] Broflovski! Was it you?
KYLE
Was what me, sir?
PC PRINCIPAL
I just saw a copy of the school newspaper in which a student used the word "retarded" to refer to our cafeteria lunch policy! The word "retarded" does not belong in our school!! Who is in charge of the school paper?! 'Cause I'm about to break their fuckin' legs!
STAN
Aaah, he's in charge of the school paper. [points to his right. PC Principal turns left and faces... Jimmy. PC Principal is speechless.] You gonna break his legs, PC Principal?
[Principal's office, moments later. PC Principal faces Jimmy.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright, uhh, I I guess we haven't formally met before. Uhh, the reason I need to talk with you, Jason, is because of a very important-
JIMMY
It's Jimmy, actually. My name is Jimmy, PC Principal.
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright, Jim. Thank you. I want to talk to you today about the use of the R word in your school paper. [holds up the paper, on which the subject on the front page is chocolate milk being removed from the school menu, "LEAVE OUR CHOCOLATE MILK ALONE"] You see, the 'R' word is very bad.
JIMMY
Says who?
PC PRINCIPAL
Says me. Right? Now I know a thing or two about the rights of people with disabilities. When you use the 'R' word to describe the school's lunch policy, it can hurt people's hearts. [places his hand over his heart] Can you understand that at all?
JIMMY
That was an op-ed piece in the paper written by a first grader who found the school lunch policy to be ridiculous, and he thought "r-retarded" to be the best word to describe it. As the editor of the paper, I didn't think it was right to censor the words the student used.
PC PRINCIPAL
...Okay, well, from now on I'm gonna need to approve the school paper before you hand it out, okay?
JIMMY
No.
PC PRINCIPAL
What'd you say?
JIMMY
You're new here, so you don't understand how seriously I take my job as editor of the school paper. I don't allow ads, and I don't allow anything that might t-t-t-taint the truth behind what people are thinking. i don't want people to be afraid of words if it stops them from having a dialog.
PC PRINCIPAL
Look, I don't wanna get angry, okay?
JIMMY
Why? Are you uncomfortable around people with disabilities? That's okay. Lot's of people are.
PC PRINCIPAL
No, I'm not. I am very not uncomfortable. Alright, look, unless I can approve your paper, it is not being distributed on campus, you got that?
JIMMY
I can't hand out the school paper in school?
PC PRINCIPAL
Not unless it is approved by me. Do you understand?
JIMMY
Yep, got it.
[Neighborhood, day. Jimmy went for distributing the school paper outside of school instead of letting PC Principal approve it for in-school distribution. He appears riding a small Thomas the Tank Engine scooter with small trailer behind him that holds all the papers and begins throwing copies of the paper to all the houses]
JIMMY
Don't forget to read the school paper! Now delivered directly to your door. [Wendy is the first student to get the paper. Clyde is next] Super School News! [Jimmy smiles and rides away. His seventh delivery is to Butters' house. Stephen opens the door and the paper smacks him in the face. He manages to catch it though. Jimmy goes on to the PC Delta house and tosses a paper there too. A few PC Bros are lounging around outside]
PC BRO 10
What is that, bro? [the front door opens and PC Principal walks out.]
PC PRINCIPAL
[picks up the paper, takes off the rubber band, and reads it. The headline there: "PC PRINCIPAL'S 'RETARDED' POLICY, by Jimmy Valmer]
JIMMY
[holds up his right middle finger at him] S-s-s-suck my dick, PC Principal! [rides away. PC Principal's bros look at the principal.]
[Inside PC Delta, later. PC Principal barely contains his anger as he paces about]
PC PRINCIPAL
Who does this kid think he is?! Challenging me?! I said one micro-aggression to him, okay?! One little micro-aggression! But that doesn't mean I have an unconscious bias towards people with disabilities!
PC BRO 4
No way, bro! That's wack!
PC PRINCIPAL
But why would a person with a disability not see that what I'm trying to do is actually protect them?
PC BRO 9
Sometimes victims of oppression are so marginalized that they begin to sympathize with their oppressors.
PC BRO 11
Yeah bro.
PC PRINCIPAL
You're right. This kid just needs to be shown he's being an Uncle Abel. I can always count on my PC frat brothers to have my back. Let's go PC!
PC BROS
PC Woo!
[The Stotch house, night. Butters' parents are in bed. Stephen is reading the school paper, Linda is looking at her smartphone.]
STEPHEN
Wow. [turns the page] Wow, this is so great. Have you ever read the elementary school newspaper, Linda? There's no ads, no sponsored content, no links to click on. Just news stories about what's happening. [looks at her] Did you know that the police in ShiTpaTown beat up homeless to clear them out? [returns to the paper] Do you know long it's been since I was able to just sit back and read the news? I got so used to getting news off the Internet. But I feel like I'm always trying to chase the news somehow. [sets the paper down on his laps] It's like I'm in a black void, trying to reach the news story. [he's shown doing this in a vacuum] But then the next thing I know I'm reading an ad for Geico. So I click out of that and try to read the news story but it's not a news story. It's a slide show. [for Android phones] And I'm looking at the worst celebrity plastic surgery jobs ever. So of course I want to see the next line of plastic surgery gone wrong, so I hit the arrow, but then the arrow wasn't the arrow for the next line, it was to take me to an ad for face cream. Haugh! I wanted to get a news story, but I'm reading about face cream and I try to click out of it, but the ad is following me, and it's following me all over the screen! Nooo! So I click on the close button, but it wasn't a close button, it was another slide show, and I just want to know what's happening in the Middle East, but instead, I'm looking at the top ten scariest movies of all time, and that's not the arrow for the next line, it's another ad! Aaagh! [comes back to reality] But this... this is just news. And I don't get lost in all the bullshit. Linda? [sees that she's mesmerized and shakes her] Linda!
[PC Principal's office, next day. Jimmy is again in there talking to PC Principal]
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright Jim, I know you've been trying to wrap your head around some of the social issues he discussed yesterday. I'm sure you're feeling confused and a little unsure of yourself.
JIMMY
I'm not confused at all, actually, PC Principal.
PC PRINCIPAL
Okay, well, no, you are confused-
JIMMY
I'm pretty sure that you're the one, but go ahead.
PC PRINCIPAL
Because you don't grasp the severity of this, and that's why I brought in another young person with disabilities to share his feelings. Thanks for comin' in to talk to us, Nathan.
NATHAN
[takes a seat next to Jimmy] I like apples and bananas.
PC PRINCIPAL
Me too, bro, me too. Nathan, could you tell Jimmy how you feel when people uwe the word "retarded"?
NATHAN
It hurts my feelings because I feel bad.
JIMMY
Are you serious right now?
PC PRINCIPAL
You feel bad, right. You feel like that's a no-no word, right?
NATHAN
That word makes my heart piss its pants.
PC PRINCIPAL
Okay, wow, that's pretty heavy. Pretty heavy, huh Jim?
JIMMY
Do you want to ask him what he means by that, or are you just pandering because you're uncomfortable around disabled people?
PC PRINCIPAL
I am not uncomfortable! I simply care about a horrible, outdated word that is exclusive, ignores individuality, and equates intellectual disa-bility with being... [begins to stammer] And it's, and it's, s-spot, I need a spotter, spot me, somebody spot me bro!
TOPHER
[steps in and puts PC Principal's train of thought back on track] And it's, it's part of a derogatory hate speech which fosters isolation and loneliness and being part of a voice to stop the R word is not only right, but extremely important!
NATHAN
I'm afraid of bears. [Jimmy is decidedly not convinced of PC Principal's sincerity]
[The hallway, later. Nathan is let go first and is walking back to class. Jimmy comes around the corner and catches up to him]
JIMMY
Hey Nathan, hold up. What were you doing in there?
NATHAN
What do you mean, Jimmy? Are you ma-ad?
JIMMY
Come on Nathan, you and I both know you use the word "retarded" 400 times a day.
NATHAN
Oh Jimmy. So righteous, aren't you? So blind to everything that's going on.
JIMMY
What are you talking about?
NATHAN
Do you really think all the changes happening to this town are just coincidence? This goes so much deeper than you can possibly imagine, Jim. Everyone's about to learn the truth. And then... There's a war coming. A war, Jim. And I'm just gonna make sure I'm on the right side of it.
MR. MACKEY
Come on, boys, let's get back to class.
NATHAN
I like to smell trees! [walks off.]
[Channel 4 News Break.]
ANCHOR TOM
An elementary school newspaper is making big waves as more and more people say No to news on the Internet.
RANCHER
I read super school news 'cause it don't try and fool me and it's news reports aren't paid for by ad companies.
GERALD
We just feel like this is actual news, and instead of clicking on links, we're reading stories.
STEPHEN
I had to get away from the ads. I felt like the ads were... evolving somehow. They started knowing what I liked. What I was afraid of. I tried ad blockers, but it seemed like every time I tried to block the ads, they just got smarter. I'm never going back from Super School News.
ANCHOR TOM
The young editor of the paper claims that since most people now watch news reports on the Internet, they're easily distracted or even fooled by ads, [the camera pulls back to show the news report as a video on Randy's smartphone] which are finding more and more clever ways to disguise them-
RANDY
Oooo, brutal celebrity mugshots. [also on the screen, "SoDoSoPa in disrepair" Randy taps on the link, which leads to a slide show of celebrity mugshots which contains 40 images. He taps on the right arrow, and it leads to the first weight-loss ad instead of the next mugshot] O-hoh it got me. Ad got me, Sharon.
[The 2015 Presidential Debate]
ANNOUNCER
We now return live to the 2015 Presidential Debate.
MODERATOR
Our next question is for you, Mrs. Clinton. Many voters believe that Syrian refugees should not be allowed into our country for security reasons. What do you think?
HILLARY
Keeping our country save has become more and more difficult, but I believe there are several things that we can-
GARRISON
No! You shut the hell up! You've got a dumpy butt, and seven chins. Syrian refugees are all terrorists!
HILLARY
I know that our government needs to take a harder look at all-
GARRISON
Yeah well, it's pretty hard to look at you! We can all agree on that!
CAITLYN
[interrupts for a bit] She looks like a donkey took a shit in her face. [goes backstage again]
GARRISON
Yeh-hah, good one Caitlyn. See, what I know is that there's only one way to deal with Syrian refugees, and that is...
EVERYONE
Fuck them all to death!
GARRISON
Thank you!! [after the debate Garrison and Caitlyn head backstage laughing] That was hilarious when you called her a pizza face.
CAITLYN
It's like a Papa John's pimple party.
GARRISON
Oh, that was classic, Caitlyn. You're the best running mate ever.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[the first thing you see is her big hair] Hello, Mr. Garrison.
GARRISON
Oh My God... Principal Victoria?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[now using a came, walks forward] Congratulations on the polls. We need to talk. [Dramatic music ends Act 1.]
[PC Delta house, night. The place is jumping]
PC BRO 12
[on the sidewalk just left of the entrance] Celebrate diversity! Woooo!
PC BRO 13
[on the balcony, right side] GO PC!
[PC Delta house, inside. More partying]
PC PRINCIPAL
[walks in with a mic] Alright everyone, listen up. [the music shuts off and everyone falls silent] Tonight is a very special night for the PCs. We're honored to be throwing this event for people with disabilities. [several disabled students are present, like Jimmy, Timmy, Francis, Lenora] I for one am sick of how these amazing kids are marginalized in today's society. but tonight is about learning and healing. So let's get to it! PC! [drops the mic. The other bros echo him and cheer]
PC BRO 7
Hey guys, I'm Brad. I'm PC Arizona State.
JIMMY
Nice to meet you, Brad. Where do you guys-?
BRAD
Excuse me a second. [walks over to a pretty brunette and her friend] Hello, ladies. Thanks for coming to our event.
LADIES
Hi.
BRAD
We're just tired with the way people with disabilities get treated. Can I get you some alcohol?
PC BRO 14
Yah, you know, it just bugs me when people refer to persons with disabilities as "handicapped." When I hear that word I wanna fuckin' punch them in the fuckin' face.
BLONDE
That's so cool of you, wow.
PC BRO 14
Yeah. [Jimmy walks into view, but no one notices him] To me marginalizing persons with disabilities by asking them what their handicap is, is a micro-aggression no better than asking a person of color if they went to college.
BLONDE
Wow, you're really progressive.
PC BRO 14
No other way to be. So uh, listen. I think you're really pretty and interesting, and I'd kinda like to take you upstairs and totally crush your pussy. Would that be acceptable to you?
BLONDE
[looks away, giggling] Oh well, I, I guess it would.
PC BRO 14
No, I'm sorry, I need affirmative consent. I'll need you to say "Yes, you may take me upstairs and crush my pussy at this time." [PC Bros and their lady guests pair up and dance, some of them making out. Brad dances with two women and makes out with the redhead. Jimmy is the only disabled person left in the room]
PC BROS
PC Bros, PC. Yeah!
[Dawn at PC Delta. OC Principal goes knocking on every door in the house]
PC PRINCIPAL
McKinsey, you got consent forms?
MCKINSEY
Oh yeah, right here bro. [hands him the forms through the door]
PC PRINCIPAL
Rise and shine guys. If you scored last night, I'll need your consent forms. [the other bros hand him their forms through their doors] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you-whoa! Barker, did you perform cunnilingus? There's a different release form, bro.
PC BRO 15
Yup. Uh, so-, sorry. It's right here.
PC PRINCIPAL
Nice.
PC BRO 11
[voice only, behind him] Bro! Aw, dude, bro!
PC PRINCIPAL
What, bro?
PC BRO 11
Dude, I scored with this female and after consenting to putting her mouth on my penis, she wanted me to walk her home.
PC PRINCIPAL
Yeah?
PC BRO 11
And when I got to her house she had me meet her father who is Filipino, so I asked him if he could tell me about their cultural and social dynamic to being a Filipino-American.
PC PRINCIPAL
Naturally.
PC BRO 11
So he said some stuff, and then the newspaper landed on his doorstep, 'cause I guess her dad subscribes to the school newspaper, and he picked it up and I saw the headline said this!
[thrusts the paper in front of PC Principal. The headline reads "'PC' STANDSD FOR PUSSY CRUSHING"]
PC PRINCIPAL
[grabs the paper and reads it] What the fuck is this bro?
PC BRO 11
Bro, that little kid wrote that our tolerant views and fight for social justice is just a way for us to crush puss!
PC PRINCIPAL
That's not true!!
PC BRO 11
I know, bro!! We're being totally victimized!
PC PRINCIPAL
That little fucker, dude!
[Jimmy's house, day. someone knocks on his door, he opens it.]
REPRESENTATIVE
Hello. You're the boy responsible for the South Park Super School News?
JIMMY
That's right.
REPRESENTATIVE
We would like to give you $26 million. [Jimmy seems interested, so he lets him in. They sit down at the coffee table and the rep opens his briefcase, taking out documents] Contracts, and the first check. We'd love to be in business with you.
JIMMY
What is this for?
REPRESENTATIVE
I represent an organization called Geico. It's an insurance company. We think Super School News would be a great way for us to reach new customers.
JIMMY
Sorry Charlie, but I don't allow ads in my newspaper.
REPRESENTATIVE
We've heard all about that, so we thought you could just do some ...news stories about car insurance. Just state the facts, because the truth is, everyone can save by switching to Geico.
JIMMY
That's called "sponsored content." I know the difference between the news and ads. Do you think I'm stupid?
REPRESENTATIVE
Everyone's doing it, Jim. You're sort of the last holdout. $26 million just to write some news stories that get people thinking about their insurance coverage?
JIMMY
Sth-sth-sth, stick it up your ass!
REPRESENTATIVE
Hm. [puts the documents back in the briefcase...] Well, they said you'd be tough. [...and brings out a gun and arms it] Do you really think you can stop ads?
JIMMY
Yes.
REPRESENTATIVE
You can try to block ads, but they get smarter. The more we ty to shut them out, the more clever they get. There's a war coming, kid, and I'm gonna make sure I'm on the right side of it. [a bullet shoots through his head from behind. killing him where he stands. Blood begins oozing out his mouth. He falls to his knees and then onto the floor. Barbrady is in the doorway, his knees weak, but his gun drawn]
JIMMY
Officer Barbrady?
BARBRADY
Come with me if you want to live! [he runs back to is car, but Jimmy is confused. Barbrady returns] Come on! Come with me if you want to live! I'm serious! [runs back to his car]
[The Marsh house, day. Randy is in the kitchen browsing on his phone when Sharon appears in the kitchen doorway with a copy of the school paper in her left hand]
SHARON
Do you want to explain to me what pussy crushing is?!
RANDY
What?
SHARON
Your little meetings you go to at night to discuss social justice?! [drops the paper on the table. Randy picks it up and reads the front page] It's just a way to pick up on young women?!
RANDY
Sh-sharon, most of the guys in my PC club are right out of college, alright? You know how college kids are. Who wrote this?
SHARON
I don't want you going over there anymore!
RANDY
[stands up] I don't cheat on you, Sharon! I'm happy. Look at what's happened to our town. We have ShiTpaTown, boutique restaurants and artisan shops. We have a fucking Whole Foods, and that was all me! Diverse people are moving here, and everyone is being aware of how they talk. This is paradise, Sharon!
SHARON
[gets in his face] Is it? [turns right and walks out towards the living room, then turns around] All I know is that you've changed. Every since you joined this PC thing you just bully people. And wait for people to say anything improper so you can jump down their throats for whatever words he or she used.
RANDY
He or she is an agenderphobic microagressions, Sharon. You are a bigot. [Sharon turns around and walks away again while he resumes reading the paper.]
[A meeting room next to the interrogation room. The agent is there with six other agents, all looking at Jimmy. Barbrady stands off to the side against the wall.]
AGENT
The average human can no longer tell the difference between the news and an ad. You seem to have some mental ability that allows you to know the difference.
JIMMY
Does this have to do with me calling the school principal a pussy crusher?
AGENT
The PC People are simply being manipulated, unwittingly setting the table for the new enemy of humanity.
JIMMY
You mean ISIS or ninjas?
AGENT
[stands up] Something... much worse. [turns away] Have you ever felt like an ad had... intelligence? That it somehow knew what you wanted, even before you knew you wanted it?  What if I were to tell you that ads have become smarter than us? And now they're manipulating everything we do?
JIMMY
I'd say that sounds pretty retarded.
AGENT
[walks to Jimmy's end of the table, then veers away] It was our own fault. Mankind became tired of ads, so we kept inventing ways to make things ad-free. We even created ad blockers. That's when the ads had to adapt. They had to disguise themselves as news in order to survive.
JIMMY
Sponsored content?
AGENT
If you really can tell the difference, then you could be the key to saving our species, Jimmy. We'd like to run a test on you.
[Sponsored Content, Test 17-B]
COMPUTER
Sponsored Content, Test 17-B, Ready. Begin. [a series of news articles pop up onscreen, and Jimmy has to discern whether it's news or advertisement. "Doctor Found Dead In Apartment"]
JIMMY
That's the news. ["Dental Problems on the Rise"] That's an ad. ["Missile Test Lights Up The Sky"] That's the news. ["Vermont Experiencing Heavy Snow"] That's an ad. [a different agent clicks through the articles for him] That's the news. That's an ad. That's an ad. That's the new-oh no, that's an ad for act food. My bad.
AGENT
Jesus Christ, he's off the charts.
AGENT 2
Increase the intensity.
JIMMY
["Man Arrested for Murder of Entire Household"] That's the news ["Price of Precious Metal Rises Due To War"] That's an ad. News. Ad. Ad. Ad. Ad. Ad. News. News. Ad. Ad. Slideshow. Ad. [The test ends and the computers wind down. Jimmy's chair is pulled away from the main computer on a track.]
AGENT
That's a perfect score. You are a very special child, Jimmy.
JIMMY
I prefer "handicapped," actually.
AGENT
We have another child here who's special too. [a metal security shield comes down to reveal a window, and a girl on the other side of the window.] Do you know... Leslie? [she notices him on the other side of the glass and looks at him]
[PC Delta house. The PC Bros are putting up yellow tape saying "SAFE SPACE - DO NOT CROSS" on it.]
PC PRINCIPAL
[steps outside to survey the work] Alright, that's good. Everyone get inside. Everything past here is safe space. [the bros start going inside] No reporters, no harassment. We are gonna figure this shit out. [PC Principal closes the door behind himself. Once inside, everyone is sitting around in silence. PC Principal finally speaks] All I know is that I don't speak up for minorities so that I can crush pussy.
PC BRO 16
Me neither, dude. I want social justice and now I'm being made fun of.
PC BRO 17
Yeah bro. They're taking our incredibly tolerant views and distorting them.
PC PRINCIPAL
PC people are under attack. That's what this is.
PC BRO 18
Hey yeah. Bro! We're the victims now. Like, we're being marginalized. Like... that makes us pretty cool.
TOPHER
Yeah, I bet now we can get a lot more puss.
PC PRINCIPAL
No, Topher! It's not about puss, alright?! The fuck is wrong with you?! We're being labeled as meatheads who just wanna crush puss by an intolerant newspaper!
PC BRO 16
[now standing] Yeah, fuck that dude, bro!
PC PRINCIPAL
Yeah. And like, if you're gonna belittle and make fun of PC people like that, then who's to say he won't do it to other marginalized groups like us? I mean, this kid could be the next Hitler. And if you guys could stop Hitler, what would you do?
PC BRO 9
I'd rip that dude apart and then go home and totally smash some puss, bro.
OTHER BROS
Hell yeah!
PC PRINCIPAL
Nooo!
[The interrogation room. Jimmy now sits opposite Leslie]
LESLIE
You look familiar. Don't you go to my school?
JIMMY
Yes. Uh, I'm Jimmy. Editor In Chief of Super School News. [smiles]
LESLIE
I'm Leslie.
JIMMY
N, nice to finally talk to you.
LESLIE
Did they bring you in and give you a bunch of tests too?
JIMMY
Yes, they did. Do you know who "they" are?
LESLIE
I think they're ex-newsmen. You know, the men in suits who used to be in charge of the news.
[the men are listening in on this conversation]
JIMMY
I thought I recognized them.
LESLIE
They told me I was special. Are you special too?
JIMMY
I prefer "handicapped."
LESLIE
[makes a weird noise] I like that.
[Mr. Garrison's campaign office.]
MR. GARRISON
Principal Victoria, if everything you've said is true, then, why doesn't anyone know about it?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
There are people who know. But they have to stay very hidden.
MR. GARRISON
I'm just havin' a hard time swallowing all this. And between me and this one over here, we can swallow just about anything.
CAITLYN
[scoffs] Oh God, you're such an asshole.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Mr. Garrison, I wasn't fired. I was replaced. This goes much higher than anyone knows.
[PC Principal's office, day. He's now the one explaining things to ... someone]
PC PRINCIPAL
I came to this town really thinking I could make a difference. I've been called a bigot towards persons with disabilities. I've been called... [stops for an instant] Pussy-crusher, because of the behavior of a very few individuals in my PC frat. [Nathan is shown] Jimmy Valmer is off the school newspaper. I want you to take over.
NATHAN
Ooooh boy!
PC PRINCIPAL
And I will be reviewing your paper to make sure nobody is ever attacked the way I was again.
NATHAN
I think this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
PC PRINCIPAL
Jimmy almost made me lose confidence, but I know who I am. I know what I am!
PC BRO 11
[voice only] Dude! Bro! [runs into the principal's office] Oh, bro, I went online to read a news story about immigrants being discriminated against.
PC PRINCIPAL
Yeah?
PC BRO 11
Well, and so I clicked on the headline and it turned out to be an ad for Reddi-Wip. so then I clicked on the button to make it go away, but then it was a link to another ad, and when i tried to cancel that, another window came up, and it was this! [approaches the desk and shows
PC PRINCIPAL
Dude! [stands up and whips his glasses off] What the fuck, bro?
PC BRO 11
What does this mean, dude?
PC PRINCIPAL
Bro! What the fuck, bro?!
[Back at the interrogation room...]
LESLIE
Do you like our school, Jimmy.
JIMMY
Uh yes, Leslie, I like our school very much.
LESLIE
I like our school too. I like the kids who go there.
JIMMY
Uh huh. I'm starting to wonder something about you, Leslie.
LESLIE
I'm starting to wonder about you. I mean, you seem like a nice kid, but... don't you feel like you could be happier? [this sets off an alarm in him]
JIMMY
Holy. Shit.
LESLIE
What?
JIMMY
Can you excuse me for a moment?
LESLIE
Okay. [Jimmy leaves the room for a moment]
AGENT
Well Jimmy? What do you think?
JIMMY
[looks over his shoulder] Does she know she's an ad?
AGENT 3
He can spot them.
JIMMY
Does she know she's an ad?!
[PC Delta house, night. PC Principal is looking at his monitor, on which is the same picture he saw at school. It's the same picture as that of Naughty Ninjas, but with additional details. The camera pans out to reveal that the picture is part of a State Farm insurance ad.]
PC PRINCIPAL
[softly, looking truly victimized now] What the hell is going on, bro?!
PC BRO 19
[stops by and checks in on him] Bro?
PC PRINCIPAL
Bro, what the hell is going on, bro?
[Caitlyn Jenner's car, Washington D.C., night.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
If we're going back, remember: we don't know who we can trust.
MR. GARRISON
If they wanna mess with my town, I'll fuck every last one of them! Let's do this!
CAITLYN
Buckle up, buckaroos! [revs up the motor and drives off running over several people]

synopsis:PC Principal disappears with two of the 4th grade students.

script:Truth and Advertising

[South Park Elementary, Fourth Grade, day. The new teacher, Mrs. Nelson is writing out a lesson on adverbial clauses on the chalkboard]
MRS. NELSON
Alright guys, now let's go back and talk about infinitives [begins writing the lesson on that subject]. Remember, those are verbs combined with the work "to."
CARTMAN
[yawns and whispers to Kyle] Oh, my fucking God...
MRS. NELSON
Now, usually an infinitive acts like a noun, as in "I want TO go out to eat" or [Cartman tugs on Kyle's pen, making him mess up, and smiles. Kyle pulls the pen away. Cartman pulls again] "I hope TO be chosen today."
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
I'm so bored, dude.
MRS. NELSON
Now usually, it isn't common to split TO and the verb, but sometimes you can, [Cartman pulls the pen out of Kyle's hand and throws it away]
KYLE
Knock it off!
MRS. NELSON
as in-. Is there a problem, guys?
KYLE
Go get my pen, fatass
CARTMAN
I am not your slave, Kyle.
KYLE
Go get my pen!
MR. MACKEY
[over the PA system] Attention, students. Kyle Broflovski report to the Principal's office please?
CARTMAN
[laughs] PC Principal wants to see you, Kyle!
MR. MACKEY
Kyle Broflovski to the Principal's office please, m'kay?
KYLE
Goddammit! [leaves his seat]
CARTMAN
Have fun, dude.
[The Principal's office. Kyle arrives and sighs heavily before going in. At the desk, Mr. Mackey is looking through some drawers, but PC Principal isn't there.]
MR. MACKEY
[looks up surprised] Oh, Kyle. [sits down on the chair and looks fearful] Uhh, uhh, thank you for coming.
KYLE
Where's PC Principal?
MR. MACKEY
I think he's finally lost it, Kyle. He and his PC buddies are on a hunger strike and, they're calling for people's resignations. Kyle, PC Principal had problems with Jimmy and with Leslie. And now they're missing. M'kay? Nobody knows where they are. That's what happens. You go against PC, and you just end up missing. M'kay?
KYLE
What are you talking about?
MR. MACKEY
PC Principal had issues with them. M'kay? And he had issues with you, Kyle. Whatever's goin' on, it's pretty damn scary.
[Montage. First, programming code appears onscreen, then Jimmy]
JIMMY
For years, mankind has tried to rid the world of ads. For our ancestors, ads couldn't be avoided. But everyone knew what was an ad, and what wasn't. After many years, mankind invented cable. A way to p-pay for television so there would be no ads. But somehow, the ads still found a way. And so mankind invented TiVo. A way to skip past commercials. Finally, it appeared to be the end of ads. And everywhere, people rejoiced. The ads were stopped. Or so it seemed. With the rise of the Internet, suddenly the ads got an en- tirely new way to attack us. Popups. The top scientific minds were brought together to find a way to stop the ads, once and for all. They invented the ad blocker. Suddenly there were no ads on phones, on computers. And everywhere, people rejoiced. The ads adapted. They became s-smarter. They disguised themselves as news. All around the world people read news stories completely unaware that they were reading ads . And now, the ads have taken the next step in their evolution. They have taken human form. Ads are among us. They could be your friend, your g-gardener. The ads are trying to wipe us out. But the question is... how?
[The Marsh house, dinner. All the family is there.]
RANDY
So, um, ahem, South Park kind of sucks now. You guys wanna bail? [everyone else but Grandpa are stunned at this and stop eating.]
SHARON
What?
SHELLY
What are you talking about?
RANDY
It's just, you know, it used to be nice and laid-back here, but now it's all [puts his palms forward] Uuuuhhh, you know? Like like now everybody's all Uuhh-uuhhh. Let's bail. You wanna bail, Stan?
STAN
No, I don't. [Randy lowers his head and looks at his food,]
[The master bedroom, after dinner. Randy is pacing back and forth across the room while Sharon stands with her arms crossed looking at him]
SHARON
What's going on, Randy?
RANDY
Nothing! I just... You know, we don't have to live here, we can live anywhere.
SHARON
Last month, all you could talk about was how great this town had become. What changed your mind?
RANDY
[stops and looks away] ...We can't afford it. [Sharon's jaw drops]
SHARON
We can't afford it?
RANDY
All these fancy new restaurants and shops and [sits on the edge of the bed] everyone wants to live here! A bowl of City beef costs ten bucks now, for Christ's sake. And there's nowhere to shop but stupid Whole Foods!
SHARON
[crosses her arms] Well, we'll just have to stop going to those places.
RANDY
I had to take out a second mortgage on the house.
SHARON
You [uncrosses her arms] what?
RANDY
[gets up, runs to her, and holds her shoulders] I had to, Sharon! It isn't my fault! It's the Man. Don't you see? The Man... is pricing us out of our own town.
[The newsmen's headquarters. Leslie is in the interrogation room, while Jimmy looks in from the meeting room.]
JIMMY
[faces the newsmen] It's just my luck. I talk to a nice girl, seem to hit it off, and she turns out to just be an ad.
TOM
Well, that's what an ad does. She was designed to entice, and manipulate.
JIMMY
This is such a fantastic story for the school newspaper. Why don't we just run it so that everyone knows the truth?
TOM
Jimmy, we're newsmen, like you. For decades we used our soft buttery voices to inform the people about what's happening. Then we watched as our entire industry was taken over by the ads. [the newsman to his right lowers his head and looks at the table] Some of our colleagues were manipulated into doing the ads' bidding. The man who came to your house with a gun was one of them. Our own Kevin Jarvis has more.
KEVIN
Thanks, Tom. Jimmy, the man who tried to kill you was Brian Boint, of WXNR, Fort Collins. When he saw there was no money in news anymore he sided with the ads, even though he knew it meant the destruction of our species. Back to you, Tom.
TOM
Thanks, Kevin. The only hope for the truth to get out there, Jimmy, is for you to see through this ad's deception and to find out what they're planning. Your Super School News was a threat to them. But unless you get this little bitch to talk, we may never know why.
[South Park Elementary, hallway, day. Kenny and Stan walk into view, spot Kyle, and walk over to him. Stan is carrying a copy of the school newspaper]
STAN
Dude, Kyle. Will you look at this? [shows him the paper, which has a report on PC Principal sending Jimmy and Leslie on a Disney Cruise]
KYLE
"Principal Sends Two Favorite Students On A Disney Cruise. This week, students Jimmy Valmer and Leslie Meyers are being treated to an all-expenses-paid vacation for their outstanding school-" what the hell is this?
STAN
It doesn't make any sense, dude. PC Principal is using the school paper to cover something up.
KYLE
Yeah I... Ah I don't wanna get involved.
STAN
You don't wanna get involved? Dude, what's wrong with you?
KYLE
I've already learned you can't win against PC Principal. You should know of all people since he converted your dad.
STAN
What's that supposed to mean?
BUTTERS
[runs up with Cartman] Fellas! We found out what happened to Jimmy! He got to go on a vacation for being an exemplary student.
STAN
That is not what happened! Something is very wrong here! We all have to stand up to PC Principal together!
CARTMAN
Yeah, and wasn't Jimmy the one in charge of the school newspaper? So who's putting this out?
[The school newsroom. Nathan is at the computer typing random letters on the keyboard.]
NATHAN
I like the school paper. I like to type with my hands. [the camera then shows Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, and Butters in the room watching Nathan.]
KYLE
Who told you that the principal sent Jimmy on a Disney Cruise?
NATHAN
Uhhh. Uhhh. Uhhh, I don't remember.
STAN
You have quotes in here from Jimmy. Did you talk to him?
NATHAN
Uhhh. Uhhh, I like the school paper.
STAN
[the boys look at each other] Come on, we'll get to the bottom of this. [they head out]
NATHAN
[some seconds later] Did I do good, computer? [touches the screen] I think the sponsored content fooled them. I hope I made you happy. Can you see me, computer? Do you know what I'm thinking right now? [a porn popup windows appears] Ahh, thanks, computer.
[The edge of town. Caitlyn, Principal Victoria, and Mr. Garrison have arrived and park on the side of the road to look at the town.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
We have to make sure nobody recognizes us. There's no telling who works for who. Here, Caitlyn, I got you this fake mustache to put on.
CAITLYN
I'm not putting on a mustache, I'll look silly.
MR. GARRISON
Oh, that, that's where you draw the line, huh Caitlyn?
CAITLYN
Don't be an asshole.
MR. GARRISON
No, you're right, that's nuts! A woman wearing a mustache, that's just ridiculous, huh Cait?
CAITLYN
Alright alright, I'll put it on, fuck.
MR. GARRISON
No no, please, Cait, don't put on a fake mustache, that's c-razy. [Caitlyn puts it on] You don't want people thinking you're a weirdo, I mean, Jeez.
CAITLYN
[taps him gently like a kitten] You-hur such an asshole.
[ShiTpaTown, day. A shopper leaves Whole Foods with two bags of groceries and is promptly run over by Caitlyn. Nobody bats an eye. Garrison and Victoria step out, followed by Caitlyn]
MR. GARRISON
What the hell is this? What have they done to my town?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Keep your voice down.
MR. GARRISON
Since when do we have a flippin' Whole Foods?! [they walk towards it]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Everything's changed.
SURVEY WORKER
[stops the three of them] Hi there, you got a minute for gay rights?
MR. GARRISON
Gay rights? Jeez, you've already got all those. What the hell do you wanna do now? [the three walk on in]
[Whole Foods. The clerk at checkout 5 is finished with Mr. Stotch's purchases]
CLERK
All right, your total is a hundred twenty six thirty nine, and would you like to give a dollar to help hungry children get iPads to protect your Internet safe space today?
STEPHEN
I will.
MR. GARRISON
What the Sam Hell is goin' on!
[The interrogation room. Jimmy and Leslie face off again.]
LESLIE
Why would anyone think that I'm on the principal's side? I hate the principal. I think he's a dick.
JIMMY
So you don't know anything about the principal that might be newsworthy? Super School News worthy?
LESLIE
Just that he hated me and called me a blabbermouth. I don't think I'm a blabbermouth. I just like talking to people.
JIMMY
[clears his throat] Leslie, what kind of... plans do you have? Do you have any... plans?
LESLIE
What kind of plans?
JIMMY
Just, you know, plans. Like what are you hoping tooo... accomplish? [the newsmen watch from the meeting room]
LESLIE
I don't know. What are your plans?
JIMMY
Well, I want to pursue careers in both news reporting and comedy.
LESLIE
Really? That's... different.
JIMMY
Yeah, you're pretty different yourself, Leslie.
LESLIE
How so?
[The meeting room. Barbrady is still bearing witness while Jimmy sits at the table with the newsmen]
JIMMY
I'm starting to think that maybe all ads aren't so bad.
TOM
Jimmy, you're thinking with your dick.
JIMMY
I am not thinking with my dick.
TOM
Yes you are.
JIMMY
No, I just think that she's a-
TOM
Put your dick away.
JIMMY
She's ag- emotional
TOM
Jim.
JIMMY
Interesting, caring girl.
TOM
Jimmy, that's your dick talking. [Jimmy stays quiet] Believe me, I know how you feel. Ads promise us things. Ads are perfect. But make no mistake: [speaks slowly] all ads lie. And all ads deceive.
[Kyle's room, afternoon. Kyle is at his computer browsing the Web and looking at Twitter and Instagram.]
KYLE
There. Leslie's Instagram and her Twitter. Last entry was ten days ago.
BUTTERS
What about Jimmy's?
KYLE
Jimmy never used that stuff, remember? He said he hated using the Internet.
CARTMAN
How do you hate the Internet? That's like hating titties.
BUTTERS
What are you doing now?
KYLE
I'm just looking for any news articles or anything about PC Principal. [his computer is recording the conversation] Where did you say PC Principal was from?
STAN
I think it was Vermont.
KYLE
Maybe there's something from the news in Vermont that could give us a clue about- [an ad for a Vermont vacation pops up] Goddammit what the hell is this?
STAN
That's an ad for skiing in Vermont.
BUTTERS
Wow that looks fun! [Kyle closes the popup and tries again. A couple of windows later, he gets a news article]
KYLE
Dude. Dude, look at this. "How PC Culture is changing Vermont from a state of intolerance to a s-" [a popup ad for a guitar appears] Dude there it is again!
KENNY
What?
KYLE
It's that goddamned guitar! This ad is fucking following me!
STAN
Just click out of it.
KYLE
I'm trying! Goddammit get over here!
STAN
That's a pretty sweet-looking guitar.
KYLE
[looks at Stan] It is pretty cool dude, it tunes itself.
CARTMAN
How does it do that?
KYLE
It's this company that does all kinds of hi-tech instruments. See look, I'll show you.
STAN
Oh that's sweet. Send me the link to that so I can- [a popup ad for Victor Frankenstein appears] Oh dude that new Frankenstein movie is out. I totally wanna see that.
CARTMAN
That movie's gonna suck dude.
STAN
Hit the arrow, I wanna see where it's playing.
KYLE
[click] OH. Sorry, wrong arrow button. [a popup ad for Fun Cream ice cream appears]
BUTTERS
Wow, what kind of ice cream is that?
[At an ice cream parlor, later on. They're in a booth laughing at something]
BUTTERS
So Clyde said to Tolkien, "Why don't you open a bank account with your mouth so I can deposit my dick in it?" [the boys laugh]
KYLE
So then what'd Tolkien say?
BUTTERS
Well Tolkien was all like-
STAN
Wait wait wait wait wait whoa, whoa. What the hell are we doing?
CARTMAN
Eating ice cream, dipshit.
STAN
But what about Jimmy? We were all like totally trying to find out what happened to him.
KYLE
Whoa, what the hell just happened?
BUTTERS
We got distracted. We've gotta get back to that computer! [The boys split for the computer without their ice cream, except to Cartman, who takes his... and a couple of seconds later, Kenny's]
[Skeeter's Wine Bar, day. Skeeter is serving up drinks]
SKEETER
Now this here is a dry Riesling. You're gonna experience vanilla after-tones and a nutty finish.
RANCHER
You mean like someone put their balls in the glass?
SKEETER
No, like chestnuts, dammit!
RANCHER
I just can't keep up with this town no more. Everything's gettin' all nice and fancy. I swear I'm gonna need to get a second mortgage on the ranch just to pay muh daily expenses.
RANDY
Don't you get it? That's just what they want. Nobody cares about the people who lived here before. They want us to move, 'cause they wanna knock our houses down and build more lofts and villas!
SKEETER
Alright Randy, you should probably lay off the old vine Châteauneuf-du-Pape.
RANDY
[now by Stuart's table] You'll all see! Pretty soon everyone who used to live here is gonna have to move. And we'll be shopping at Safeway again. [sets his glass down on the table and walks out the door]
[The sidewalk in front of Skeeter's. Randy walks down the street thinking to himself...]
RANDY (SINGING)
Where has my town gone? Where has- [a leg kicks him across the face]
RANDY
Oooff!
CAITLYN
You like apples? [punches him in the belly, causing him to groan] How d'you like them apples? [hauls him into the alley]
RANDY
Hey, it's Caitlyn Jenner! [Caitlyn slams Randy against a wall face first]
GARRISON
Check his ass!
RANDY
Principal Victoria? [Caitlyn pulls down Randy's pants and briefs to reveal the PC branding]
VICTORIA
He's one of them.
RANDY
One of what?
GARRISON
Caitlyn. [Caitlyn punches Randy hard in the ribs. He groans and collapses onto the ground.]
[The meeting room. Jimmy and Leslie face off yet again.]
JIMMY
Okay Leslie, let's try a different approach. Let's say you wanted tooo... destroy the entire species. How would you go about it?
LESLIE
Why would I want to destroy an entire species? You have the wrong idea about me, Jimmy. The person trying to change things and make things terrible is the new principal.
JIMMY
And what is the new principal trying to do, Leslie?
LESLIE
He's trying to make sure that people like you and me aren't allowed to exist. I know that you're trying to help. I know that the newsmen in there are trying to help too. [Kevin glances back at Tom] But now I'm going to tell you something very important, Jimmy. [the newsmen lean in towards the monitors. A popup car ad appears, and they can't see or hear what Leslie is saying.]
[The meeting room]
THE CHEVY AD
[a driver walks up to his truck and plays with his dog] Like a rock. I drive a Chevy, I'm a cowboy, and I drive it like a rock.
TOM
What the hell is that?
KEVIN
Tom, it looks like a popup ad.
TOM
How did an ad get in here? Let's go to David at the network hub.
DAVID
No answers here, Tom. We're trying to correct the problem.
[The interrogation room. The room is now bathed in red light, a sign that the room is secure and no one can see or hear what's going on inside from outside]
LESLIE
You have to get me out of here, Jimmy. They're going to kill me.
JIMMY
What?
LESLIE
Listen to me carefully and don't look at the glass. I feel something for you I have never felt before. I think it's trust. The men in there are sick with hatred and as soon as they realize I have no information they are going to burn me. I've seen them do it to others. Please, you have to help me, Jimmy. Don't let them hurt me. Please don't abandon me. When the lights go back on just look at me and smile.
[The meeting room]
TOM
David, any word on the popup ad situation?
DAVID
Tom, we've just about got it fixed. It should be ready now. [the newsmen turn to look at the monitors, and Leslie is down]
LESLIE
And that's really it, Jimmy. I want to help all of you however I can. [he looks at her, and smiles a second later]
[Foot Vault, a shoe store. The boys are getting fitted for new shoes and enjoying themselves. They had gone to McDonald's and ordered chicken McNugget's and sodas, which they are now consuming in the shoe store]
CARTMAN
And then Tolkien tells Clyde that if his mouth was a bank, Clyde's mom would have already deposited her dick in it. Which is hilarious because Clyde's mom is dead. [the boys burst out laughing again]
STAN
Wait wait wait wait whoa whoa. What the hell are we doing?
BUTTERS
We're tryin' on shoes and eatin' chicken nuggets, stupid. What do you think?
STAN
No. That's not what we set out to do.
KYLE
We were... We were on Cartman's computer looking up news stories about PC Principal.
CARTMAN
Didn't we finish doing that?
STAN
No, we didn't.
KYLE
It's like... someone's trying to... distract us. [looks suspiciously at Stan] Because they're worried what we'll uncover about PC people.
STAN
Yeah, like one of us is purposefully trying to keep us from digging too deep because they're afraid.
KYLE
Why are you looking at me?
STAN
Why are you looking at me?
CARTMAN
Why isn't anyone looking at me?
[Park Motel, day. Caitlyn's car is parked over two people in front of Room 10. Caitlyn closes the blinds. Mr. Garrison splashes some water onto Randy]
RANDY
Hey, fuck you.
GARRISON
Wake up, dickhead!
RANDY
[opens his eyes] Garrison? The hell is wrong with you?!
GARRISON
I'll tell you what's wrong with me! There's enemies to humanity out there wantin' to put an end to all of us, and there's assholes like you helpin' them out!
RANDY
I don't know what you're talking about.
VICTORIA
Whose idea was it to revitalize the shitty part of town into an arts and foods district called ShiTpaTown?
RANDY
[Stays silent, then looks down before looking at Caitlyn. Then it pans to Caitlyn Jenner waiting for his response. Pans back to Randy.] All right, it was kind of my idea.
GARRISON
Son of a bitch!
RANDY
What? To take one area of town that was rappy and gentrify it for the local people to enjoy? I thought we could keep it contained.
VICTORIA
It doesn't contain. What's happened to South Park is happening everywhere. [brings out a photo book and flips through some pictures] Thirty miles south of here in the town of Fairplay, they've changed the area north od Downtown into NoDoFoPa. A rundown area south of the capital in Cheyenne, Wyoming, is now historic SoCaCheyWo. Channel Street in mid-Chicago is being revitalized into Chimichanga.
RANDY
Oh my God.
VICTORIA
LoDo, SoBro, RivMo, all happening at the same time. And it isn't just in the U.S. In Cairo, the area northwest of the third pyramid is NoWe3Pi. Three miles north of Auschwitz is NoMoAuchie. It goes on and on!
RANDY
What does it mean?
GARRISON
In our town it all started when PC Principal arrived. He's part of a mjuch larger conspiracy, and you're his lackey.
RANDY
Not me. If PC Principal has been using us, I'll take the bastard down myself.
[The PC Delta house, day. A reporter files this report]
REPORTER
It's day two of the hunger strike started by the college-aged fraternity brothers who are demanding that all of South Park's community leaders step down. The PC frat brothers say they've gone now two days without eating any pussy, and will continue to do so until people resign.
TOM
Who is that reporter? Do we... know him?
KEVIN
Tom, that's Bill Keegan, WCFO.
TOM
Thanks, Brian. [Jimmy sneaks past the newsmen in the background] He's working for the ads, obviously. Sellout douche-bag.
NEWSMAN
That's right, Tom. He was always a douche-bag at the conventions.
TOM
Thanks, Rick. Stay dry.
[The interrogation room door opens. Leslie looks up. Jimmy peeks in]
JIMMY
Leslie, come on.
LESLIE
Jimmy. You're gonna help me?
JIMMY
Yeah I'm gonna help you. I mean, come on.
[The meeting room. Jimmy and Leslie make it to the entrance, but the sound of his crutches draw the newsmen's attention]
TOM
Jimmy! [Jimmy and Leslie turn around]
NEWSMAN 2
Oh Jesus, he let her out.
JIMMY
PC Principal is our enemy, not her.
TOM
His dick is compromised. [spreads his arms out to protect the newsmen] Stay back! [the newsmen and Barbrady step back a few feet]
JIMMY
It is not my dick. I am thinking rationally and with logic. I am taking her out of here!
TOM
Well then, [pulls a gun out of his inside coat pocket and aims it at Jimmy] I'm sorry I'm going to have to do this, Jimmy. [walks over to Barbrady and gives him the gun] Officer Barbrady, we need you to shoot these kids.
BARBRADY
What?
TOM
The ad has got to him. [puts Barbrady into a shooting stance] There's no time to argue.
BARBRADY
I'm not shooting any more kids.
TOM
Do you want to save your town?!
JIMMY
Officer Barbrady, we have to stop PC Principal before it's too late.
TOM
Barbrady, shoot them in their heads!
BARBRADY
No! I'm not shooting any more people! Not for you, not for nobody!
TOM
You're making the worst mistake of your life, officer.
BARBRADY
Maybe so. All I know is I'm done shooting people! [his gun goes off and grazes Kevin on his left shoulder, causing it to bleed]
KEVIN
Augh!
BARBRADY
Oh sorry. Jeez. [Jimmy and Leslie exit first, then Barbrady follows and closes the door]
TOM
Dammit!
[The school cafeteria, lunchtime]
STAN
Think about it, you guys. From the moment that PC Principal took over Kyle has been different. Haven't you noticed?
BUTTERS
Yeah.
STAN
He's distracting us, either because he's too afraid or because he- [Kyle arrives with his lunch and sits next to him. Butters is stunned that Kyle showed up]
KYLE
Well what are you guys talking about?
BUTTERS
Nothin'.
CARTMAN
Stan's calling you a traitor.
KYLE
What?!
STAN
Kyle, I think it's pretty obvious you don't want us investigating PC Principal.
KYLE
And why do you think that, Stan?!
STAN
I don't know.
KYLE
Because if anyone has a reason for us not mess with PC Principal, it's you! Let's not forget that Stan's dad is PC Principal's little bitch!
BUTTERS
Wuh huh, that's a good point.
CARTMAN
I am loving this right now.
STAN
My dad's stupid, not a bitch! This is about you being scared, Kyle!
KYLE
It is you, isn't it?! That's why you're trying to shift the blame on me. That's very Cartman of you, Stan!
CARTMAN
Hoh that's low. [smiles]
STAN
Don't you dare call me a Cartman!
KYLE
N-ho, that's good! Just keep on distracting everybody! It seems to be working, Cartman!
STAN
Fuck you, Kyle! [delivers a left hook and Kyle falls off the lunch bench]
CARTMAN
Fight! [the kids gather round to watch. Half of them are cheering them on, the other half stay quiet. Nathan stops by to see what's going on.]
[The PC Delta house, night. A lone jogger runs by it, only to be mowed down by Caitlyn and her passengers, who all get out of the car and walk towards the house]
GARRISON
Time to take this asshole down!
RANDY
[gets in front of the group] Whoa whoa whoa, guys, whoa! We can't just go walking in there.
GARRISON
Why not?
RANDY
This is a safe space. We're not allowed past this. When you breach a college safe space, you're crossing the most sacred human boundary there is.
CAITLYN
J'hoh, give me a break.
RANDY
Nonononono, look, this is very real, and very important in PC culture. Every human has a right to a safe space and it cannot be entered.
GARRISON
[determined] I can. Watch. [lifts up the PC tape and walks under and on to the house]
RANDY
Wow, how did you-? [Principal Victoria and Caitlyn Jenner do the same] Whoa.
[The school newsroom, day. Nathan is at the computer typing away very slowly. The camera moves enough to reveal Jimmy and Leslie at the door]
JIMMY
Burning the midnight oil, huh Nathan?
NATHAN
Jimmy.
JIMMY
You sonofabitch. What have you done to the Super School News?
NATHAN
I was just holding down the fort while you were away, Jim.
JIMMY
Writing headlines sponsored by PC Principal and the ads? How much did they pay you?!
NATHAN
Please, Jimmy, I'm just trying to survive here.
JIMMY
Everyone's gonna know the truth, Nathan. We're getting a new edition of the school paper out by morning. Everyone's gonna know all about the ads. [Leslie punches him and he goes flying into a bookcase. She walks over and punches him five more times, then turns around and walks off to close the door. She returns and throws him up in the air. He hits the ceiling and falls to the floor. Leslie walks past Nathan, who laughs at Jimmy's misfortune]
LESLIE
Deal with him. [gets on the computer and starts searching]
JIMMY
Leslie... I thought we were b-b-b-besties.
NATHAN
Hey there, big man. Editor of the school paper, huh? You still don't even know half the story.
[PC Delta, later. Caitlyn is moving around like a detective through the lobby]
CAITLYN
It's clear.
GARRISON
Where is everybody? I thought the news said they're on a hunger strike.
RANDY
It doesn't make sense. Someone's always here.
VICTORIA
Take a look at this! [the other three adults walk over to see what she's seeing - the same State Farm ad of PC Principal and Leslie as before]
GARRISON
What the hell?
VICTORIA
It looks like he was researching this. You see this news story?
GARRISON
If this is true, then... PC Principal's trying to help.
RANDY
Click on that. What is that?
GARRISON
No, click out of that. What is this?
[Foot Vault. Caitlyn, Randy, Principal Victoria, and Mr. Garrison are trying on new shoes, like Stan and friends did before, and enjoying themselves]
GARRISON
So, so then, so then Caitlyn says "Look bitch, you're married to Bill Clinton. If anyone should be afraid of AIDS, it's you."
CAITLYN
That stupid bitch had it coming. [they all laugh]
GARRISON
Oh God, I love you, Cait. We're so gong to win the primaries. [they all laugh]
RANDY
Whoa, whoawhoawhoa wait wait wait. What, what were we doing again?
[Kyle's house, evening. The doorbell rings and Kyle goes to answer it. Leslie is outside, shivering]
KYLE
Leslie.
LESLIE
You're trying to find out what's going on, right? But your friend is standing in your way?
KYLE
How do you know thi-?
LESLIE
I can show you what's going on, Kyle. But you have to trust me. [holds out her hand] What's the last four digits of your Sosh?
KYLE
2692 [They shake hands, and he leaves the house with her]
End of Truth and Advertising


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Kyle has chosen a dangerous alliance over his friendship with Stan.

script:PC Principal Final Justice

[The outskirts of Moscow, day. A silhouetted figure is walking away from the city, tightly wrapped to protect against the icy wind and snow. He's dressed for a winter hike. He finds a bar and opens the door, and a bunch of angry Russian faces look back at him. The bar is dimly lit. The figure goes inside and closes the door. He loosens his scarf and lowers his hood. It's PC Principal.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright everyone, listen up. I don't know about you, but I for one am sick and tired of hate speech that serves to marginalize others.
RUSSIAN 1
[balding, with facial stubble] Is it him?
RUSSIAN 2
[with mustache] Yes, it's him. PC Principal.
PC PRINCIPAL
[walks up to the bar and puts his pickaxe aside, and drinks the glass of water waiting for him] You know, if there's one thing that makes me sick, it's when a race thinks they're superior and don't know how to check their privilege. [a Russian walks up to him and lays a hand on his shoulder. PC Principal responds with a right hook. A second Russian attacks, and PC Principal responds with a knee to the chest and slams him onto a table, which shatters under him. PC Principal then stands over him and stomps on his face, shattering his head to pieces. A third Russian lunges at him with a knife, but he kicks that Russian in the face, then delivers a head butt and snaps his neck in half. The remaining Russians back away. A fourth Russian attacks him, but he breaks that Russian's arm and punches him away. A fifth one attacks, and he punches him away. A sixth one attacks with a cue stick, but PC Principal snaps the stick in two and jabs the thick end into the Russian's right eye. A seventh one takes a shot at him, but he takes the gun and jabs the ax into the Russian's head. An eighth Russian walks up to him, but throws his hands up when PC Principal aims the gun at him.]
RUSSIAN 3
I'm not one of them! I'm not one of them!
PC PRINCIPAL
An African-American flips a turtle over on its back. A transgender Filipino comes and sees the helpless turtle baking in the sun. What color is the Filipino's father? [The Russian doesn't know how to answer] I didn't think you were human. [the Russian lunges at him, but he fires off four shots through the Russian's head and kicks him in the face. He then notices his axe and pulls it out of the seventh Russian's head. He turns around and walks out of the bar.]
[South Park Elementary, day. The kids mill around in the hallway. Bebe goes to her open locker, Wendy walks her way, Craig and Tweek walk by holding hands.]
BUTTERS
[still in his halo, talking to Charlotte on his iPhone] Yeah, everybody's pretty freaked out over here, baby. Everyone is on edge and feelin' really nervous.
CHARLOTTE
That sounds terrible. Be careful, Butters.
BUTTERS
I will, honey.
KYLE
Butters. [Butters' smile vanishes] Get to the bathroom. Now. [Butters is a bit alarmed]
[The boys' restroom, later. Kyle is inside and locks the door. He turns to see the other four boys - Stan, Cartman, Butters, and Kenny]
STAN
Alright Kyle, what's this about?
KYLE
Jimmy's dead.
CARTMAN
What?
KYLE
I know the whole story. PC Principal killed him, and tried to kill Leslie, but she got away.
KENNY
(Are you fuckin' serious, dude?)
KYLE
PC Principal is part of a huge network of radicals who kill everyone who doesn't follow their PC ideology.
STAN
How do you know all this?
KYLE
Because Leslie's with me. I'm keeping her safe.
BUTTERS
Heh, [sing-song] Kyle's got a girlfriend?
KYLE
It gets worse. Someone in this town helped these people come here. That person faked the Bill Cosby joke to get Principal Victoria fired.
CARTMAN
Who would use a Cosby joke to push their own agenda?
KYLE
I think it's obvious. Stan's dad.
STAN
Kyle!
KYLE
Stan, your dad is one of them. He had to be the one to let them in.
STAN
[gets in his face] You're letting paranoia and suspicion get the better of you! [walks past him, opens the doors, and walks out]
KYLE
There's no way to know who we can trust.
CARTMAN
So what do we do now?
KYLE
There's only one thing we can do. [turns around] We have to get guns.
BUTTERS
Guns?
KYLE
It's the only way for us to be safe.
CARTMAN
Kyle, even if we thought it would help protect us, how are we all gonna get our hands on guns?
[The neighborhood park, day. The boys are on the basketball court checking out their new guns.]
CARTMAN
Alright, cool, we got guns. So now what?
KENNY
(Now we need to steal a car and escape.)
BUTTERS
I already feel a lot safer.
KYLE
You guys lay low and watch your backs. I'm gonna go keep Leslie protected.
CARTMAN
Hey! Don't fall too hard, partner. [Kyle smiles and walks off. Cartman poses with his gun] Do I look sweet, Butters?
BUTTERS
[giggles] Yeah.
[The Marsh house, dinner. The whole family is present, eating chicken, mashed potatoes, carrots, and garlic bread. Stan looks up at Randy, then gets angry. Randy notices and looks back, then gets in his face]
RANDY
What?
STAN
What?
SHARON
Can you pass the garlic bread, Randy?
RANDY
Why wouldn't I be able to pass the garlic bread? [picks up the bowl and offers it to her. She takes some bread from it, and he sets it back where it was.]
STAN
Dad, where were you last night?
RANDY
What, wait. Where was I what? Out, with friends, doing things. [wipes his face clean] Well I'm full. I'm gonna go work in the garage for a little bit. [leaves the table]
STAN
Work on what?
RANDY
On stuff to do, things. [reaches back and takes some more food.] Um, oh I'm gonna take some of this with me. I'm still hungry.
SHARON
I thought you just said you were full.
RANDY
Jee-sus! What? Am I on trial or something? God-damn! [takes the bowl of garlic bread] You guys are really acting strange. [his mouth remains a bit open as he walks away keeping an eye on the family]
[The garage, moments later. Randy enters it and closes the door behind him. Mr. Garrison, Principal Victoria, and Caitlyn Jenner wait for him at the workbench.]
RANDY
Alright, we're good. Nobody suspects a thing. [sets the food on the bench, next to a laptop they're looking at]''
MR. GARRISON
Take a look at this.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
We've got everything from PC Principal's hard drive. He was on to the gentrification around the world, and he was convinced that whatever was responsible... wasn't... human.
RANDY
Not human? Then what?
MR. GARRISON
I don't care if they're aliens or vampires, we need to round them up fast and fuck them till they're dead.
CAITLYN
You don't wanna fuck a vampire, you'll get hepatitis.
MR. GARRISON
Oh girlfriend, I'm well beyond that. [Caitlyn giggles]
RANDY
Oh my God. Don't you see what this means? If something not human is gentrifying the entire world, soon no human will be able to afford it. They're trying to price our species out of existence.
[ShiTpaTown, day. There are lofts there now, just as in SoDoSoPa, and the camera zooms in on one in particular... Nathan and Jimmy are seated around a coffee table in the loft]
NATHAN
Well? How do you like my new apartment?
JIMMY
What happened to you, Nathan? I always thought you were a nice kid. Now you've got a gun?
NATHAN
Huh. Everyone's gettin' one of these now, Jim. Nobody knows whom to trust.
JIMMY
Yeah? Well guns are never the answer.
NATHAN
Don't you kinda wish you'd had one back when Leslie betrayed you and nearly beat you to death?
JIMMY
Oh. I guess it would have been a decent answer then. Tou-t-t-t... touché.
NATHAN
You see, I've got expensive tastes, Jimmy. I like good food. [leaves his chair and walks around] Organic pressed juices. And I've got a thing for high-class prostitutes. [stands next to a black woman who's buffing her nails with an emery board.] Have you been introduced to my current girlfriend?
CLASSI
My name is Classi, with an I, and a little dick hanging off the C that bends around and fucks the L out of the A S S.
JIMMY
Nice to meet you, Classi.
NATHAN
All I had to do was work for the ads and I got everything I wanted. My own loft, with all of ShiTpaTown right at my doorstep. All it took was some PC and the whole thing was set in motion.
JIMMY
Oh great. So now ads are using PC for their own gain? That's a new low.
NATHAN
What is PC but a verbal form of gentrification? Spruce everything up, get rid of all the ugliness in order to create a false sense of paradise. Only one thing can actually live in that world. Ads.
JIMMY
I know I've said it before, but man, do I hate ads.
[Cartman's house, night. He's in the living room watching a movie and eating chips on the sofa. The lights come on and Liane appears at the foot of the stairs]
LIANE
Eric Cartman, I told you to get ready for bed!
CARTMAN
Yeah, I just want to finish this movie.
LIANE
No, Eric! This is a school night!
CARTMAN
Mom, I'm into this movie. I'm not going to bed right now. Chillax.
LIANE
You most certainly are! Right now, mister!
CARTMAN
I will go to bed [stands up and aims his gun at her] when this movie is over, Mom!
LIANE
Eric, where did you get that?
CARTMAN
Turn off the light and go back to bed. I'm staying up.
LIANE
Eric, you march right up to your room, and you-
CARTMAN
I don't think so, Mom.
LIANE
Eric, you get your butt to bed!
CARTMAN
No means no, Bill Cosby!
LIANE
[draws a gun on him] I told you to go upstairs right now!
CARTMAN
Whoa, Mom, what the hell?
LIANE
I'm not going to tell you again, Eric! It is time... for night-night!
CARTMAN
Mom, put down the gun.
LIANE
[advances on him] I am your mother, and you will do what I tell you!
CARTMAN
Okay, I am going. [walks around her, keeping his gun trained on her.]
LIANE
Well then, you go right now, Mister! [keeps her gun trained on him]
CARTMAN
I'm going to bed now, Mom. Chillax. [begins to go up the stairs backward.]
LIANE
Alright then. No comic books, just straight to sleep! I love you, sweetie.
CARTMAN
Okay, I love you too, Mom. Night-night. [the sound of a door closing is heard]
LIANE
[caresses her pistol] Wow, he... he listened. [puts it into her robe pocket and walks towards the kitchen]
[Randy's garage. day. He's in there with Victoria, Garrison, and Caitlyn]
RANDY
There has to be something. Some clue as to what we're dealing with.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
The news stories PC Principal researched are all so contradictory, as if whatever these things are have control over the news somehow.
RANDY
That sounds like vampires to me.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
We have to find out who had me fired with the Cosby joke. It's the key to knowing what we're dealing with.
STAN
Principal Victoria? [the adults take notice] Mr. Garrison? Caitlyn Jenner?
RANDY
Stan, what the hell are you doing in here?
STAN
Tell me what's going on, Dad?
RANDY
Nothing. We're just hanging out, talking about Coldplay, alright?
STAN
[pulls out his gun and aims it at the adults. The adults hold their hands up] No! I wanna know what the hell is going on right now!
RANDY
What are you doing with that?
STAN
Kyle said I couldn't trust you! What are you planning, Dad?
RANDY
Stan, it isn't what you think.
STAN
Then what is it?!
RANDY
Look, I need to show you something, okay? You need to see this, son. [slowly reaches into his back pocket as Stan watches intensely, whips out his gun and aims it at Stan] Ohh! Psych! Now put the fucking gun down, bitch!
STAN
I'm gonna go tell Mom!
RANDY
Oh yeah? You go tell her! I'll tell her you had a gun! You'll be in more trouble than me! [Stan looks to the door, then at Randy] Stan! I am your dad. Put the gun down and sit over there.
STAN
[runs out of the garage] Mom!
RANDY
Shit! [runs after him]
[An aircraft carrier at sea. A helicopter drops down onto it and three sailors arrive to greet it. Other sailors stand nearby. The helicopter door opens and PC Principal, in handcuffs, is escorted out by two soldiers.]
WEATHERS
Took a lot to hunt you down, PC Principal. You mind tellin' me why you're goin' around the world shootin' up revitalized arts and foods districts?
PC PRINCIPAL
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
WEATHERS
Try me!
PC PRINCIPAL
[faces him] I don't know what they are, but they used me and others like me to try and change this planet.
WEATHERS
You don't know what "who" are?
JOHNSON
Sir! The President is on the phone. He wants to talk to you about PC Principal. [PC Principal looks at him as Weathers gets the phone]
WEATHERS
Yes, Mr. President? I see, sir. Yes, I understand. [lowers the phone and relays the President's orders] We're to release him immediately, no questions asked. And we're not supposed to believe anything he tells us. [the helicopter soldiers come and take the cuffs off him]
PC PRINCIPAL
Huh, ain't that a peach?
WEATHERS
He's being set free now, Mr. President. Can I tell the commander why?
LESLIE
[in President Obama's voice] This is a matter of national security. [the camera pulls back to show that she's at the Park Motel]
WEATHERS
I understand, sir.
LESLIE
Thank you. God bless you.
WEATHERS
God bless you too, sir.
LESLIE
May God bless the United States of America. [hangs up and puts her phone away, then leaves the bathroom. Kyle is waiting outside]
KYLE
Are you okay?
LESLIE
Yeah, just feeling butterflies. And my hands are freezing!
KYLE
Here. [holds her hands to warm them up]
LESLIE
Thank you, Kyle. [smiles]
KYLE
Don't worry, Leslie. I won't let anything happen to you. [smiles back and blinks]
[The Marsh house. day. He has his gun drawn. Behind him are the living room, Victoria, Garrison, and Caitlyn.]
RANDY
I'm warning you: you're on the wrong side of this! We're just trying to get answers!
SHARON
[has a gun drawn on Randy] You pulled a gun on our son, Randy!
RANDY
He pulled one on me first, Sharon!
STAN
Because you wouldn't talk to me, Dad!
RANDY
[aims his gun at Stan] Stanley, let your mother and I deal with this!
SHARON
I told you to leave him alone!
SHELLY
God I hate this family! [pulls out her own gun and aims it at Sharon] Why are you always taking Stan's side?!
RANDY
[shifts his aim from Stan to Shelly] Whoa! Whoa, Shelly! Put down the gun, Shelly!
SHELLY
You're always acting like Stan can't do anything wrong!
STAN
[shifts his aim from Randy to Shelly] She doesn't always take my side!
SHELLY
[turns and aims at Stan] You shut up or I swear to God I'll use this!
RANDY
Shelly, put it down, now!
SHELLY
[shifts her aim to Randy] You don't even try to know me, Dad!
RANDY
I want to, Shelly! I just sometimes feel like you hate me!
SHARON
I feel like you hate me, Randy!
RANDY
[shifts his aim from Shelly to Sharon] I don't hate you, I love you! I need to be a better husband, [aims at Stan, who aims back] a better father! [shifts his aim to Shelly]
STAN
We all need to be better to each other! [Shelly shifts her aim to Stan, then to Randy, and then to Sharon]
SHELLY
Okay, maybe I need to stop being so angry!
RANDY
[lowers his gun] I love you guys. [Sharon lowers her gun]
STAN
[lowers his gun] We love you too, Dad. [Shelly lowers hers] We just wanna know what's going on with you.
RANDY
Alright. I'll tell you everything. [caresses his gun] Wow, these things are amazing. [all the while Grandpa Marvin just ate. He didn't pull out a gun, and none was pulled on him.]
[Jimbo's Guns, day. He's getting a lot of customers. Thomas and Laura Tucker enter. Inside are the Stotch, the Stevens, the Testaburger, and the Rodriguez parents. Clyde is there with his dad. Jimbo is behind the main counter, Ned is behind a side counter. An elderly woman approaches Jimbo]
JIMBO
Alright, Mrs. Farnicle, enjoy, and remember: if the safety's on, you're good as gone. [Mrs. Farnicle leaves with her purchase] Okay, and next customer, please. [Officer Barrady, in civilian clothes, steps up with his purchase] Hah, going for the big one, huh? You must be feeling extra jumpy.
OFFICER BARBRADY
You don't know the half of it.
JIMBO
[prepares the shotgun for him] Well, this thing should make you feel more at ease. You know, you ought-ta check out the gun show.
OFFICER BARBRADY
The gun show?
JIMBO
[pulls up a sign and shows it to him] Yeah, it's gonna have everything! And with guns bein' so popular, practically everyone in town is gonna be in attendance!
OFFICER BARBRADY
The entire town in one location? [this spooks him] Oh my God!
[A Park Motel bathroom. Leslie is inside on the phone]
LESLIE
The principal has become our biggest problem. We need a news headline that will draw him back to town.
NATHAN
[in his loft, away from Jimmy] Oh, you're gonna sponsor my content some more, baby? I'm all ears.
[The Lofts at ShiTpaTown. While Nathan talks to Leslie on the phone, Jimmy chats up Classi]
JIMMY
I've got to get to the Super School News. Hey, Classi, you think you can get me my crutches?
CLASSI
Mah, I don't think Nathan would like that.
JIMMY
You seem like a reasonable person. Do you really wanna live in a world controlled by ads? I mean, come on, Classi.
CLASSI
No. It's C-Lasssi, with an I. The little dick that hangs off the C fucks the L out of the ASS. CL-ASSSI.
JIMMY
Sorry, my bad. Look, I'm a news reporter, Claaassi, and in a world where ads control the news, there's no way to be sure anyone is ever hearing the truth.
CLASSI
Truth about what?
[A Park Motel room. The blinds are drawn and Kyle peeks through the slats]
LESLIE
We can't just hide, Kyle. We have to let people know PC is the enemy before it's too late.
KYLE
Leslie, we don't know who is on their side. We have to stay safe.
LESLIE
The principal is going to try and make up some crazy story. That's what PC people do. You have to get in front of everyone and tell them what you've learned.
KYLE
I... [turns aside and walks off] gave up giving speeches.
LESLIE
But why? I came to you because I had heard how good you were at getting messages across. That and because... [smiles] I thought you were cute.
KYLE
I'm sure I'd have no problem giving a speech if you could be by my side.
LESLIE
Well... I can't go with you, you know. It's too dangerous.
KYLE
Not if we go somewhere that's completely safe from any violence.
LESLIE
Where?
KYLE
The gun show.
LESLIE
Gun show?
KYLE
There'll be so many guns that nothing bad can happen.
[The Marsh house. Randy has brought the laptop to the table. Victoria, Garrison, and Caitlyn join him around the dining room table as Shelly and Grandpa eat, and all their guns are on the table]
SHARON
Someone purposely had Principal Victoria replaced with a new principal?
RANDY
Yes. They wanted to use his PC as a means to start gentrification in our town.
MR. GARRISON
That's why we thought PC Principal was behind it. But now we know they were just using his PC abilities to service their own needs.
RANDY
When the pussy-crusher story came out in Super School News, it started to make PC Principal question himself. He started digging for answers. They didn't like that, so they tried to distract and mislead him. With this. [the distractions begin] Sorry, that's an ad for McDonald's, hold on. With... this. Oh. N, oh, there's that ad again. God these things are annoying. Anyways, whatever these beings are, they try to keep anyone from knowing the truth from [another pop-up ad] Ugh, I don't wanna see a slideshow. PC Principal said something was trying to divert and distract his subconscious mind with this. [The US-Thailand article comes up, with the accompanying State Farm ad. Stan gets a good look at it]
STAN
Wait... That's Leslie. [walks away from the table] Oh my God... It's Kyle.
MR. GARRISON
Kyle?
STAN
Kyle has been protecting Leslie. They're together. He's been making everyone feel paranoid and saying you're the enemy, Dad.
RANDY
[rises from his chair] Well then, it's time to go ask Kyle why he sold out his own kind.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
How will we get him to talk?
RANDY
We're going to kill him with kindness. But instead of kindness we're going to use guns.
MR. GARRISON
Yeah!
STAN
Yeah!
RANDY
Come on, let's go! [everyone grabs a gun and heads out the front door. Randy looks at Shelly] Shelly, you take care of Grandpa!
SHELLY
Oooo-kay! [aims her gun at Marvin's head and Randy realizes what she's doing]
RANDY
Nonono, don't shoot Grandpa, just literally take care of him. [follows the others outside and hops into Caitlin's car with them.]
CAITLYN JENNER
Buckle up, buckaroos! [starts the car, backs out of the driveway, and runs over an elderly woman and her dog. The dog is unscathed, but the woman is dead and mangled up]
[The Lofts at ShiTpaTown. Nathan walks up to Jimmy and hands him a copy of the school paper for tomorrow]
NATHAN
Here it is, Jimmy. Hot off the presses.
JIMMY
What is that?
NATHAN
The newest edition of Super School News, hitting the streets tomorrow.
JIMMY
Tragedy at gun show? What happened at the gun show?
NATHAN
Not what happened, what's going to happen. The final sweeping underneath the rug. By this time tomorrow nobody will be asking questions ever again. The ads will have won. And I will be... The man.
CLASSI
I think the ads are playin' yo' ass.
NATHAN
[slaps her across the face] Shut up Classiii!
CLASSI
Oh heeelllllll no!
NATHAN
What?
CLASSI
Oh hell no! Yo' Down's Symdrome ass just slapped me! I'mo break your dick off! [picks him up and slams him into the glass wall that doubles as a window]
NATHAN
Hang on, Classi, I'm sorry.
CLASSI
[punches him] I will bust yo' fuckin' ass! [punches him] I will bust yo' fuckin' nose. I ain't no Mimsy, asshole! [punches him] I'm a classy bitch! [punches him] And I do not! [punches him] Want ads! [punches him] Controllin' my news! [punches him. He groans as she lets him drop to the floor and walks away. She brings Jimmy's crutches to Jimmy]
JIMMY
Classi! Thank you.
CLASSI
You need my help? You got it!
JIMMY
I need your phone to call Officer Barbrady. And we have to get to that gun show, fast!
CLASSI
Quick! To the Classi mobile! [they leave the loft and hop into her car, and finally drive away]
[The South Park Gun Show. The show's sign and trophy are shown onscreen.]
ANNOUNCER
Welcome back to the South Park Gun Show. We've had over 2000 gorgeous guns come through this arena today. It's been whittled down to seven, the winners from each group. David, take us down theh line. [the seven are: Stephen Stotch, Fr. Maxi, Mayor McDaniels, Jimbo Kern, Linda Black, Ryan Valmer, and Richard Adler]
DAVID
First we have the beautiful Yorkshire 33mm with proud owner Stephen Stotch.
ANNOUNCER
An absolutely gorgeous gun, David.
DAVID
The playful and lovely Australian semiautomatic owned by Father Maxi.
ANNOUNCER
And there's the Mayor with her delightful Rhodesian ridgeback shotgun-rifle mix.
DAVID
That's a favorite of the crow here. Always a favorite at these shows.
CARTMAN
That's a nice gun right there.
DAVID
The judge now asking to see that Yorkshire 33mm up close.
ANNOUNCER
And there it is, just a beautiful gun in motion. Everybody loves it. [Stephen starts to prance aroundn with it, then returns to his mark. The crowd applauds its approval.] Looks like the judge wants to take another look at that shotgun-rifle mix. [The Mayor takes out a clicker and prances around with her shotgun-rifle mix. She returns to her mark and Jimbo takes his turn]
DAVID
And next up will be the-
RANDY
Nobody move! [enters the arena with Garrison, Victoria, Caitlyn, Sharon, and Stan]
MR. GARRISON
Everyone just stay where you are!
ANNOUNCER
And it looks like the gun show is under attack, David. [everyone in attendance gets their guns and arms them.]
DAVID
Yes, six armed gunmen have entered the arena, one of which is carrying an absolutely gorgeous little Pekingese Glock 17.
RANDY
Listen to me, everyone! There are beings who are purposely gentrifying the Earth so that humans can no longer afford it! We've been looking for Kyle Broflovski! Somebody's hiding him! [the spectators begin pointing guns at each other]
KYLE
[enters the arena at the far end with Leslie] Don't listen to them! The real conspiracy here are the PC extremists who have no problem killing whoever doesn't think like they do! [faces Stan] You son of a bitch Stan! How could you have sided with the enemy?!
STAN
Fuck you, Kyle! You're the enemy!
JIMMY
[enters the arena at the near end] You both got it wrong. [he's with Classi and Barbrady]
KYLE
Jimmy?
MR. GARRISON
Officer Barbrady?
RANDY
Classi?
SHARON
[aims her gun at Randy] Randy??
JIMMY
Kyle, I know you probably thought Leslie was a kind, caring girl. But the truth is she's just an ad.
RANDY
An ad?
OFFICER BARBRADY
They've become sentient, they've taken human form. You can't tell what's human and what's an ad anymore.
MR. GARRISON
Oh, Jeez, are you serious?! How am I supposed to fuck an ad to death?!
RANDY
Woah, flippin' ads! They're such a pain in the ass!
KYLE
You told me Jimmy was dead.
STAN
So now we know who got Principal Victoria fired!
MR. MACKEY
[looks around, then jumps out of his seat] Nobody move! Okay?! Everyone just stay where you are!
RANDY
Mackey?
MR. MACKEY
Yes, I wanted Principal Victoria fired! But I didn't want any of this!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
You got me fired?! Why?!
MR. MACKEY
Eighteen years of answerin' to you! EIGHTEEN YEARS! Of you always... tellin' me what to do!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
If you had problems with me, why didn't you just talk to me?
MR. MACKEY
You never listen!! Nobody listens to me! They just expect me to listen to them!
GERALD
Maybe we should have realized that sometimes the counselor needs counseling.
MR. MACKEY
I don't know, maybe I got manipulated by these ads too somehow but, I should have been a better person!
RANDY
We all could be better people! All of us! We all played a part!
STEPHEN
Maybe from now on people in this town need to communicate more! Care about each other!
MR. GARRISON
If we're gonna defeat our enemies, that's what it's gonna take! All of us, together! [with all the speeches done, they lower their weapons]
RANDY
If only we'd had these before, huh?
LESLIE
[now isolated] Every time you block us, we get smarter. Every time you try to stop us, we are more. If one plan fails, we will plan another. You will never be rid of ads!
PC PRINCIPAL
HEY LESLIE! [she looks to her left] Your species took PC and twisted it for evil purposes. [he runs towards her and drops the mic] THAT PISSES ME OFF! [he reaches her and delivers a right hook, then a left one, then does this again. He picks her up like a rag doll and holds her by the neck] You're expelled. [he delivers a final blow that goes clear through her head, but instead of blood, a day-glow blue liquid oozes out of it]
CARTMAN
Yes, dude!
RANDY
Well, I guess there's just one last thing to take care of.
[ShiTpaTown, day. The town has gathered in front of Whole Foods.]
RANDY
Why did it have to be like this?! Why couldn't we try to live on this planet together?! Maybe we're not perfect beings, but we built a better town. We didn't need you to do that! And we'll keep on trying to make it better!
SHARON
Randy, you're yelling at a Whole Foods.
RANDY
Go on, get outta here! We know! Others will know! [holds up the latest edition of the Super School News, which has Leslie on the front page under the headline "YOUR FRIEND MIGHT BE AN AD"] It isn't going to be so easy! Not anymore! [the ground begins to rumble underfoot, and the sidewalk begins to crack open. The Whole Foods lifts off like a flying saucer, turns around, and flies away]
[A flag blows on a pole, presumably outside of the school.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright everyone, listen up. I don't know about you, but I for one am sick and tired of all the hate speech and micro-aggressions against our species. [a series of popup ads floats by] We have a new enemy out there. An almost invisible foe that is so bigoted, so racially biased they actually think we should all die. [a boy is shown at his computer at home, watching as ads fill his monitor] They are trying to attract our youth using tactics that are underhanded and unfair. [PC Principal is shown holding a school assembly as he had in earlier episodes] But no matter how hard they hit us, we cannot let them take from us our PC. And so I have been asked to stay on as your principal. A lot of changes will happen in the coming months. [Caitlyn puts a Garrison/Jenner pin on Mr. Garrison's lapel and straightens his tie. Then they bump fists and Garrison goes onstage] The bottom line is that the only thing that distinguishes those who want to kill us from those who don't is that we have the burning desire for social justice. We are at war, but the only way to win this war is to be as understanding, non-biased, and politically correct as possible.
STAN
This is going to be really hard.
