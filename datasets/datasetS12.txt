synopsis:After a routine tonsillectomy goes horribly wrong, Cartman comes face to face with his own mortality.

script:Tonsil Trouble

[A close-up of a tongue depressor holding a tongue down, and the sound of a boy going "AHHHHHH." The camera pans out to reveal a dentist looking inside Cartman's mouth. Liane stands nearby, watching. They are all in Cartman's room.]
CARTMAN
AHHHHHH.
DENTIST
Well, there's no doubt about it. Those tonsils need to come out.
CARTMAN
What?
LIANE
Uh, what exactly does that entail, doctor?
DENTIST
It's a very simple operation. We'll just put you to sleep, Eric, and when you wake up you'll be tonsil-free!
CARTMAN
No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!
DENTIST
Oh, I thought you were a tough kid! You're not scared of hospitals, are you?
CARTMAN
No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all!
DENTIST
Well then I guess you don't want all the ice cream you get after the surgery, either.
CARTMAN
...Ice cream?
DENTIST
It'd be a shame to have to give all that free ice cream to the big boys who aren't scared of hospitals.
LIANE
What do you say, champ? Think you can tough it out?
CARTMAN
Well...you did say free ice cream? [Dentist and Liane laugh]
[A shot of Hell's Pass Hospital. Camera cuts to a hospital room where Cartman is asleep in a hospital bed. Liane is sitting by his side, holding his hand and smiling]
LIANE
Poopsiekins, wake up. Wake up, honey.
CARTMAN
[Opening his eyes, blinking a lot] Uh. It's over?
LIANE
That's right, you did it, Poopsiekins!
CARTMAN
[Eyes fully open, sitting up] Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom!
LIANE
I'm so proud of you, Eric.
CARTMAN
All right, so where's my ice cream?
[The doctor and two opposite sex nurses enter the room looking very nervous.]
LIANE
Oh, here's the doctors now! Hi, doctor.
CARTMAN
You were right, doctor! Everything is okay!
DOCTOR CARROLL
No, it's not. Eric, I'm afraid that we've accidentally infected you with the AIDS virus.
LIANE
...What!?
CARTMAN
What's that supposed to mean?!
DOCTOR
During the tonsil surgery we had to supply you with donor blood. A mistake was made and you were given blood contaminated with HIV. It was a one in a billion fluke.
CARTMAN
I HAVE AIDS?
DOCTOR CARROLL
Not yet, but we've confirmed that you now have the virus that causes AIDS. We are very sorry.
CARTMAN
"Sorry"?! You gave me AIDS and you're "sorry"?!
LIANE
Oh, my poor little baby!
CARTMAN
Mom, you said nothing would go wrong!
LIANE
Oh God! [Cries] Oh no!
CARTMAN
No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!
DOCTOR
We're going to do everything in our power to make this up to you, Eric. For starters, I think I owe you some ice cream. [One of the doctors brings over a plate with two sundaes on it, leaving it on Cartman's bed.]
CARTMAN
[Knocks the ice cream on the ground] Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE!
LIANE
[Sobbing] Oh, oh, my baby has HIV!
CARTMAN
NO! NOOOOOOOO!
[A shot of South Park Elementary as segue music plays. In the teachers lounge, Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Ms. Garrison, two other staff members, and all of the boys' parents are gathered.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Thank you for coming, everyone. [Stan, Kyle, Butters and Kenny walk in.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Boys, please take a seat.
STAN
[The boys sit down.] What's going on? Are we in trouble?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Boys, the reason we called you all in is because one of your friends... has a serious illness. Eric Cartman has been diagnosed with HIV.
STAN
[All five boys are surprised.] ...What?
BUTTERS
Oh no.
DOCTOR MATLOCK
He's been to several specialists after a botched blood transfusion. The disease is in very early stages and completely manageable, but he's naturally a bit scared.
KYLE
Cartman has HIV?
DOCTOR MATLOCK
We need everyone to understand you can't get the virus from Eric. You can still give him hugs and even kisses. Don't be afraid of him, just-
KYLE
Excuse me. Eric Cartman has HIV?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
All right, we're going to bring Eric in now, and let's all be as supportive as we can and show him lots of love, okay?
MR. MACKEY
[Opens the back door] Eric? Come on in, your friends want to say "Hi", m'kay? [Eric walks into the room with a black baseball cap, a gray scarf, and an annoyed look. Everyone greets him.]
KYLE
...No. Way.
BUTTERS
[Walks over to Cartman, putting an arm around his shoulder] How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you. [Smiles and kisses Cartman on the cheek, much to his horror]
CARTMAN
God damn it, this sucks ass!
KYLE
...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. [Leaves the room and begins laughing in the hallway. It can be heard from in the room.]
BUTTERS
Poor Kyle. He's really taking it hard.
CARTMAN
Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die!
DOCTOR MATLOCK
No, you're not going to die, Eric. AIDS isn't as big a deal as it used to be. There are advances in treatment and-
CARTMAN
Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!
[A shot of the Airport Hilton, where Elton John is scheduled to hold an AIDS benefit for Eric Cartman]
[Inside, a group of people are in the grand ballroom. Pictures of Cartman hang on the walls. An M.C. steps up to the mic]
M.C.
We are here tonight to salute the bravery and the courage of one very special little boy who is living with HIV. [there's hardly anyone there: just his mom, Butters, Jimmy, and two other adults.]
CARTMAN
Where the hell is everybody? [a waitress arrives with some food]
LIANE
Excuse me, shouldn't we wait for everyone to arrive before we get started?
WAITRESS
This is everyone. We didn't sell that many tickets.
BUTTERS
Great benefit, Eric!
JIMMY
The Italian meatballs are fa-fantastic.
CARTMAN
So this is it?
WAITRESS
I'm afraid AIDS benefits aren't as popular as they used to be. AIDS was more the '80s/'90s disease. It's all about cancer now. [leaves]
CARTMAN
Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap!
M.C.
With all of your help, we have raised over seventeen dollars for AIDS tonight, and that money will certainly go towards helping little Eric Markman.
CARTMAN
Just bring out Elton John already!
M.C.
Uh we're sorry, Elton couldn't make it. He- uh, he had to play at a cancer benefit.
WAITRESS
It's all right, we got somebody better: Jimmy Buffett!
CARTMAN
Jimmy Buffett?!
JIMMY BUFFETT
Hello everyone. I wrote this song for a very brave little boy.
AIDSburger in paradise!
AIDSburger and it ain't nice!
CARTMAN
Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!
JIMMY BUFFETT
A little boy in South Park
Dyin' of AIDS in the cold dark
How he got AIDS I haven't a clue.
Wastin' away again because of AIDS and stuff
How are we all feelin' tonight?
CARTMAN
[sticks his middle finger up in the air] Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin' suck!
LIANE
Ohoho poopsiekins, be nice.
CARTMAN
Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS!
[The neighborhood bus stop, day. Kyle, Stan, and Kenny wait for the bus. Cartman walks up, dressed as he was a day or two ago]
CARTMAN
Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday.
STAN
Oh dude, was that yesterday? We forgot.
CARTMAN
Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease.
STAN
Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?
CARTMAN
...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead. [Kyle bursts out laughing; Cartman angrily approaches him] OH YEAH, it'S REAL FUCKIN' FUNNY, KYLE!
KYLE
[trying to stop laughing long enough to say something] I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly.
CARTMAN
NO YOU DON'T!
KYLE
I do. [smiles and keeps from laughing]
CARTMAN
If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face! [the smirk is having trouble not breaking into a laugh] Well any goddamned second, Kyle!
KYLE
I'm sorry. I gotta go home. [laughs, turns away and leaves. His laughter trails off]
CARTMAN
[watched Kyle leave] Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?!
STAN
He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic.
CARTMAN
Ironic how?
STAN
Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now...
CARTMAN
[spins around and gets in Stan's face] Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!
STAN
[backs away a bit] Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks.
CARTMAN
[advances] Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!
[Kyle's house, night. Kyle is asleep in his room, his curtains partially open. Outside in the bushes, Butters appears dressed as a cat burglar]
BUTTERS
Oh, uh-okay, it's clear.
CARTMAN
[comes into view also dressed as a cat burglar] All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up. [they head towards the sliding door]
BUTTERS
Okay, but... what are you going to do?
CARTMAN
Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at.
BUTTERS
I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.
CARTMAN
Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do.
BUTTERS
I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?
CARTMAN
I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.
BUTTERS
[reflects on the answer] Oh yeah, uh-well I guess that's true.
CARTMAN
[gets down to business] All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access.
BUTTERS
Wow, you really know what you're doing.
CARTMAN
Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times. [moments later, Cartman is shown moving up along the outer wall to Kyle's window. He stops and opens the window gingerly, silently steps onto Kyle's bed, and walks over to Kyle's face. Then he whispers] You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well... [reaches into his back pack, pulls out a syringe, rolls up the sleeves on his left arm and...] let's just see how funny it is now, asshole. [...draws some blood into it and drops the blood into Kyle's mouth. Kyle instinctively tastes it and swallows it. Cartman quickly goes back out the window and slams it shut as Kyle wakes up.]
KYLE
Wagh.
[South Park clinic. Kyle sits on the bed as Sheila hands him some tissue. He sneezes.]
SHEILA
There there, bubbe, you'll be okay. [a doctor walks into the room] Oh doctor, did you find anything? Is it strep?
DR. DOCTOR
No, it isn't strep...
SHEILA
Oh, well there's a relief.
DR. DOCTOR
...Mrs. Broflovski, has your son ever had a blood transfusion?
SHEILA
No, why?
DR. DOCTOR
[walks around to Kyle's end of the bed] Little boy, have you been having unprotected anal sex?
KYLE
What? No?!
SHEILA
Doctor, what are you saying?
DR. DOCTOR
[walks up to Sheila] We've run every test imaginable... little Kyle here is infected with HIV.
KYLE
What?
SHEILA
HIV?
DR. DOCTOR
It took us a long time to narrow it down, but there is no doubt.
SHEILA
No, that's impossible!
DR. DOCTOR
[addresses Kyle] Little boy, are you sure you haven't taken it up the hoohoo just once or twice?
KYLE
No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe... [his eyes open wide at the realization that Cartman deliberately infected him with the HIV virus.] Oh my God. [gets angry] That son of a bitch!!! [hops off the bed and rushes out the door]
SHEILA
Kyle? Kyle!
[Recess at South Park Elementary. The boys are outside tossing a football. Craig catches a football and looks for an opening]
CARTMAN
Pass me the ball! [Kyle angrily runs in from a distance...] Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole! [...and shoves Cartman to the ground forward at full speed. Cartman falls on his face, then looks back and up at Kyle.] Kyle, what the F?!
KYLE
I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Kyle, what?!
STAN
[steps into view. Kyle is super angry] What did he do?
KYLE
Why do I have HIV?!
CLYDE
...Oh...
CARTMAN
Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?
KYLE
What did you do?!
CARTMAN
Nothing!
KYLE
Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?! [Behind Cartman, Butters motions Kyle not to say anything further]
CARTMAN
Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale. [too late. Butters stops motioning]
KYLE
Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!
CARTMAN
Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-
KYLE
[lunges at Cartman] AAAAAAA! [starts punching him mercilessly, the other kids start cheering and jumping up and down while one girl does not and looks on with concern while titling her head.]
CARTMAN
Kyle!
KYLE
[doesn't let up] Hate you! [punch] Hate you! [punch. Mr. Mackey walks into the fray]
MR.MACKEY
Hey! Hey, that's enough! Break it up, m'kay?! [tries to separate the boys...] Break it up! Hm'kay?! [...but ends up hoisting them away together at each other's throats] M'kay!
[Principal Victoria's office, moments later. Mr. Mackey has taken Kyle and Cartman there and now stands next to the principal]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
All right, boys, now what is this fighting all about?
KYLE
[pointing to Cartman] He gave me AIDS!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
What?
KYLE
He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Is that true, Eric? Did you give Kyle AIDS?
CARTMAN
Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[pointedly] Did you infect Kyle with the HIV virus, yes or no?!
CARTMAN
[grudgingly] Kind of.
MR. MACKEY
Eric, that is not appropriate behavior, m'kay? You cannot purposely infect other kids with your disease!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
That's right. I think you owe Kyle an apology.
CARTMAN
[grudgingly] I'm sorry.
KYLE
An apology?!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
You're sorry for what, Eric?
CARTMAN
I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
That's better. And now Kyle, maybe you should also admit you were wrong for tattling.
KYLE
[can't believe these adults] ...What?!
MR. MACKEY
Kyle, the thing about tattlin' is, eh tattlin's bad. M'kay, because nobody likes a tattle-tale, m'kay?
KYLE
A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!
CARTMAN
See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys. [they are shown the door]
[The hallway. Kyle walks forward and leaves the principal's office. The camera tracks him, and Cartman begins to move as well.]
CARTMAN
[keeping pace with Kyle] Well Kyle, I guess we're even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now? [stops] Kyle, where are you going?
KYLE
[turns around and returns to Cartman, then says between gritted teeth calmly but angrily] I am going to break everything that you own. [spins around and walks away]
CARTMAN
What's that supposed to mean? Kyle? [settles on the obvious] Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!!
[Cartman's house, front. Kyle approaches the front door and opens it. He goes right in and up the stairs. Cartman appears by the driveway a few seconds later]
CARTMAN
Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole! [Kyle enters Cartman's room and begins breaking anything he sees. First, a toy rocket. Then, he grabs a poster of Braveheart from the wall and rips it apart while screaming in rage. Next, he grabs the Wellington Bear Magic Mic and smashes it on the floor. Cartman walks in.] What the fuck are you doing?! [picks up some of his broken toys. Kyle knocks over a box of small toys] Kyle, stop it! [Kyle breaks apart a toy Mountie after three tries] God damn it, don't! [Kyle walks over to Cartman's big toy box, grabs Clyde Frog,..] Kyle, no! Not Clyde Frog! Leave Clyde Frog alone! [...and rips its head right off and moves off.] NO!! [Cartman picks up the two halves of his plush frog as Kyle moves to the XBOX] AHH! Clyde Frog!! Clyde Frog you ba- no! Not the Xbox, Kyle! [Kyle picks it up and tries to pull it out of the power socket] Not the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND! [stops Kyle before Kyle gets to smash the XBOX on the floor] I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you!
KYLE
There is no cure, you asshole!
CARTMAN
No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope.
KYLE
What hope?!
CARTMAN
Break my Xbox and you'll never know.
KYLE
You're lying!
CARTMAN
NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson.
KYLE
Magic Johnson?
CARTMAN
He was a basketball player.
KYLE
So what?!
CARTMAN
So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy. [grabs Kyle's shoulder] You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!
KYLE
[looks at the XBOX for a few moments, then] You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!
CARTMAN
[stunned] My God...
[Denver International Airport. A list of gates are shown. Kyle and Cartman walk in and go to a Delta Airlines clerk]
CARTMAN
We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible.
CLERK
Los Angeles. Okay, uh I have a two o'clock flight. That would beee... $400 each.
CARTMAN
Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS.
CLERK
...AIDS? Wow, that's really... retro. But ah I'm sorry. I- I just can't give away free seats.
CARTMAN
Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason!
KYLE
Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!
CLERK
Oh, you boys are [sticks his left index finger into a tube he makes with his right hand and moves it in and out of the tube] like that, huh?
KYLE
NO!
CLERK
Are you sure you boys just don't have any cash?
CARTMAN
We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
CLERK
Uh, we sometimes offer free seats to cancer patients, but AIDS I d-. Heh-hey Mitch? Do we have any AIDS patient policies?
CARTMAN
Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares! [turns around and leaves Kyle standing there]
[The interior of an airplane. Cartman and Kyle sit in aisle seats near the front of the cabin. A flight attendant walks up to them]
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
We're so happy to help accommodate you brave boys. What kind of cancer did you say you have again?
CARTMAN
Oh uh, you know, all over cancer.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
I'm so sorry.
CARTMAN
Yeah, well, at least [leans into the aisle and looks back at the other passengers] it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Hm, I don't know. These days I think I'd rather have AIDS than cancer.
CARTMAN
No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here! [the flight attendant turns and walks away] We're on our way, buddy. [puts his left hand on Kyle's right hand] Magic Johnson, here we come.
KYLE
[coldly] Don't. Touch me.
CARTMAN
[removes his hand from Kyle's and places his hands together over his stomach] I know. I'm scared too.
[Magic Johnson's mansion, day. Behind it is a smoggy horizon.]
[Magic Johnson's mansion, living room. Magic has his feet propped up on a glass coffee table. He's spinning a basketball on his right index finger as he changes channels with his left hand. An NBA Championship trophy sits on a small table to the left]
BUTLER
Magic. Magic, could you come to the front for a minute? There are a couple of boys here to see you. Two brave little buddies who against all odds have journeyed across America to find the cure for AIDS. All they have are each other in a race against time. [Magic sheds a big tear and sniffs]
KYLE
[moments later] Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease.
MAGIC
You boys both have the virus? Are you sure?
CARTMAN
We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
KYLE
[quickly irritated via short temper; exploding] Will you stop it with that!?! [angrily points at Cartman] What part of this is funny to you?!!
CARTMAN
Kyle, we need to try to find a-
KYLE
What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!!
CARTMAN
[thinks for a few seconds] I don't think it's funny, Kyle.
KYLE
[angrily points at Cartman again] Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV positive!! [Cartman keeps quiet] This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, [points at Cartman a third time with his eyes closed.] So shut the fuck up!!
CARTMAN
[clears his throat] Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-
KYLE
[angrily points at Cartman a fourth time] Knock it off!! Right now!! This isn't funny!! At all!!
CARTMAN
[waits a second] Are you sure?
KYLE
[quickly] Yes!!!
CARTMAN
[waits a second] Are you HIV-positive? [Kyle smacks him] Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle!
MAGIC
Boys, the truth is I don't know why my body is so resistant to the virus. I would love to know so I could help others, but I just don't. [shrugs]
KYLE
Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?
MAGIC
Well, not at all.
[The hallway. Magic and the boys pass various rooms]
MAGIC
The pool is over there [motions to his left], where I try to swim and stay in shape. My kitchen [motions to his right] is full of pretty healthy food. I don't know which thing it is that keeps my T-cell count high, so I... try it all.
KYLE
But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?
MAGIC
Sure.
[The bedroom. The double doors swing open and the group enters]
MAGIC
Just a pretty plain old ordinary bedroom. [before them is the four-post bed with curtains, and stacks of dollar bills everywhere else]
KYLE
Dude.
MAGIC
Oh, oh yeah, I- I don't trust banks. I sleep with all my money.
KYLE
You sleep with money. Every night?
MAGIC
Yeah, I like to keep it close b- ...You don't think that..?
[AIDS Research Center, day. Inside a laboratory there, a scientist analyzes a blood sample through a microscope]
SCIENTIST 1
[changes focus] It's incredible. Mitch, these boys could be onto something. Take a look. [Mitch steps in and looks into the microscope] That's a sample of HIV-infected blood. You can clearly see the HIV attacking the white blood cells, right? [the HIV is indeed attacking] All right. Watch what happens when we introduce some cash. [waves a brick of bills around near the microscope]
MITCH
My God. The HIV particles are receding! [the particles scream as they sense the money, and leave the white blood cells alone]
SCIENTIST 1
The cash does seem to retrain the HIV cells from stabilizing.
SCIENTIST 2
Now hold on! All the cash is doing is destabilizing the virus, not destroying it.
KYLE
Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...
MITCH
Then maybe enough cash shot directly into the bloodstream could kill the virus altogether.
MAGIC
I have enough cash for all three of us! We should give it a try!
SCIENTIST 2
Na-noo, it's ridiculous. We need FDA approval, control studies! I'm sorry, but this is impossible!
MAGIC
These boys have shown us that a lot of impossible things can happen. [genuflects next to them] Their friendship has conquered every obstacle in their illness-ridden lives.
SCIENTIST 2
[sighs heavily and puts his hands on a lab table] Their incredible friendship has brought a sparkle of hope to our world, that's for sure.
KYLE
[looks away] Wugh.
SCIENTIST 2
I suppose we could try to distill Magic's cash down to its... most highly-concentrated level and... try it on one of them. But it's very risky.
CARTMAN
Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk.
[moments later, a tank holding a lot of Magic's dollar bills is brought in. A shredder is lowered into the tank and turned on. It shreds the bills to into pulp and then is lifted out. The tank is lifted up over a cylinder and the pulp is poured from the tank to the cylinder, which turns out to be a giant pump. The pump is activated and pushes the pulp into a helical tube. At the end of the tube is a small chamber which distills the pulp into a clear green liquid and acts as a dropper. The liquid drips into a large syringe. Once it fills up, Mitch takes it...]
MITCH
Let's hope to Christ this works. [...walks over to Kyle, kneels next to him, and injects him with the liquid. Moments later, a sample of Kyle's blood is taken and analyzed]
SCIENTIST 1
Wait a minute... Yes... Yes, take a look! [he trades places with Scientist 2, who looks into the microscope] The cash particles have completely replaced all the HIV in Kyle's blood! [the newly repaired blood cells look like discs cut out of dollar bills. Scientist 1 turns around and faces the boys.] Boys, you just found the cure for AIDS.
CARTMAN
All right!
SCIENTIST 1
[throws open the lab doors and walks out] They found the cure for AIDS! [runs down the hall] The cure for AIDS!
SCIENTIST 3
What is it?
SCIENTIST 1
[grabs Scientist 3 by the shoulders] Large doses of concentrated cash! [runs down the hall] Get the media on the phone!
SCIENTIST 4
[female] All right!
[SNN News]
ANCHORMAN
Scientists have just discovered the cure... for AIDS. [smiles] About a hundred and eighty thousand dollars shot directly into the bloodstream.
[Nigeria, Africa, around sunset. A station wagon pulls up and a blond driver jumps out]
DRIVER
Hey! They just found the cure for AIDS! You just have to inject yourself with all your cash! Woohoo!
[A Cure For AIDS benefit at the Airport Hilton's Grand Ballroom]
M.C.
I am pleased to announce that there is no trace of the HIV virus in either Kyle Broflovski or Eric Cartman. [the room applauds. Most everyone present is from South Park] Together these boys beat their illness. With nothing but each other, and overcoming all odds [Kyle's face gets angry], these two brave friends-
KYLE
Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!
M.C.
These two brave lovers found the cure and helped the world. And so, to honor these boys [Cartman grins. Kyle is still angry], here is... Jimmy Buffett!
CARTMAN
[grin vanishing] What?! Aw, no!
JIMMY BUFFETT
Cureburger in paradise!
Cureburger. There I said it twice!
CARTMAN
What?! Aw, God damn it! [puts his arm around Kyle] Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha.
KYLE
I'm still breaking your Xbox. [turns right and walks off]
CARTMAN
What? No. No. [runs after him] Kyle, no!

Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?
RANDY
This is important, Stanley! [the boys look at him] You boys should care about this stuff.
CARTMAN
Yeah, but we totally don't.
RANDY
Well you boys are gonna sit and watch this! This is what really matters!
MODERATOR
And so, Mr. Obama, why don't you tell us your stance on military spending?
BARACK OBAMA
Well, my opinion is that-
[Emergency New Bulletin]
ANNOUNCER
We interrupt this debate for an emergency news bulletin! It's... Britney Watch! [a montage of Britney pictures is stamped with a stamp saying "Britney Watch" inside it. Dramatic background music starts up] Keeping you up-to-date with all your Britney Spears news!
BUTTERS
[wakes up and looks at the screen] Man...
RANDY
[getting excited, leans forward] Oh-oh boy, what's she done now?
ANCHORMAN
Britney Spears has been spotted camping in the Colorado mountains, and one report claims that she has taken a piss... in the forest. Robert Pooner has more.
ROBERT POONER
Ron, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where Britney Spears has apparently been trying to get away from it all. [the boys react to the news]
CARTMAN
Aw dude, that's our town!
ROBERT POONER
Ms. Spears was spotted at a mountain campground [shots of her pitching a tent and relaxing in a chair after the tent is up], and you won't believe what she did, Ron. The troubled diva took a piss. Right on a ladybug. We've blurred out parts of the photo so that it doesn't offend. [a shot of her squatting and pissing on the ladybug. The blurred area is her face]
RANDY
She's such a train wreck!
ROBERT POONER
When the photo is enhanced, Ron, you can see the poor little ladybug getting doused. [extreme closeup of the piss hitting the ladybug]
RON
[the anchorman] This must be very embarrassing for Britney that this photo got out, Bob, and, and she looks like she's gained weight.
ROBERT POONER
That's right, Ron, she really chubbed up. And if you zoom in on her face, you can see that she's got some zits! [a closeup of her chin shows two zits]
BUTTERS
Aw, poor girl.
RANDY
[rising from his armchair] Hey Sharon, Britney peed on a ladybug. [heads towards the kitchen]
RON
The photograph was taken by Brian Willis of Bailey, Colorado [a photo of Brian Willis holding lots of bricks of money appears], who sold it to 31 News for a hundred thousand dollars.
KYLE
A hundred thousand dollars?
CARTMAN
That's enough to buy slaves!
RON
Britney is said to be now hiding out in a South Park motel. Aand now back to the stupid Democratic debates.
HILLARY CLINTON
...and spearchuckers.
KYLE
[gets off the sofa] Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.
STAN
[gets off the sofa] And she's at a hotel in our town. [Cartman gets up as well and gets restless]
KYLE
It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera.
CARTMAN
[runs off] Sweet!
BUTTERS
[finally gets up] Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone.
STAN
[thinks a bit, then] Butters, don't be such a pussy.
BUTTERS
[looks at Stan, then at Kyle] Hokay. [smiles]
[The sidewalk. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman walk along, Cartman has his camera with him]
KYLE
A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!
BUTTERS
[hidden, comes to the front] Well this costume was supposed to be for the Easter musical, fellas, not for tryin' to make an easy buck! [something stops them in their tracks]
STAN
Oh no.
[Before them is the Komfort Inn, with a crowd of paparazzi standing in front of it. The boys walk up to the crowd]
KYLE
Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!
PHOTOGRAPHER 1
Join the club.
PHOTOGRAPHER 2
Yeah, all you amateur photographers are makin' this tougher on the professionals!
CARTMAN
We're professionals too, you fuckin' butthole! [the boys make it through the crowd and approach a set of stairs. A security guard stops them]
GUARD
Ah ah, nobody goes upstairs.
KYLE
[stammers] We uh, we have special permission?
STAN
Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids.
GUARD
You are?
BUTTERS
[not amused] Not me! I'm a squirrel!
[A hotel room. Britney is painting her toenails on a low table while on the phone with someone]
BRITNEY
But now everybody thinks I hate ladybugs. I didn't even know it was there. I can't take it anymore. I'm just sooo- [several knocks are heard at her door]
GUARD
Excuse me, Ms. Spears, but your kids are here and they've brought you a squirrel.
BRITNEY
My boys? Really? Send them in. [to the caller] It's okay. My kids are here. I feel better now. [hangs up. Stan and the others enter the room]
KYLE
We did it guys!
STAN
I told you that would work!
THE BOYS
Yehehahah, all right!
KYLE
Ahall right!
BRITNEY
[walks up to them] You mean, it was just a joke? My kids ain't here?
KYLE
All right. Butters, go get next to her.
BUTTERS
I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice!
STAN
Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not?
BRITNEY
[walks back to the table] You're never gonna leave me alone, are you?
BUTTERS
It ain't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are! [Britney opens a drawer and pulls something out]
KYLE
All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!
STAN
Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else.
CARTMAN
[aims his camera] All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin'.
BRITNEY
I've got a better idea.
STAN
You do?
BRITNEY
Yeah. [whips out a big shotgun, shoves the nozzle into her mouth, and pulls the trigger]
STAN, KYLE
NO! [the gun goes off and she falls to the ground. The gun falls away from her. All four boys stand there all petrified. Cartman does not take any pictures. After a bit, Cartman turns and runs out. Butters looks at Stan and Kyle, then heads for the door]
BUTTERS
[stops and looks back] You killed her! [leaves]
GUARD
Hey, everything all right u-. Oh.
[A hospital. Not Hell's Pass. Stan and Kyle sit on chairs outside a room, waiting for word on Britney's condition.]
NURSE
[over the PA system] Paging Dr. Bender? Paging Dr. Bender, please? [another nurse wheels an elderly patient across the hall]
STAN
We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.
KYLE
How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.
DOCTOR
[walks up to Stan and Kyle and faces them] She's... alive.
KYLE
Whew.
STAN
Oh, thank God.
DOCTOR
But, we almost lost her. Why couldn't you boys just leave her alone?
KYLE
Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?
DOCTOR
I don't want you making her upset.
STAN
We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry.
DOCTOR
[sighs] All right.
[Britney's recovery room]
DOCTOR
[enters with Stan and Kyle] Ms. Spears, these boys wanted to say something. [Britney gargles something. Only her lower jaw and the base of her skull remain of her head]
KYLE
Oh my God!
STAN
Oh no!
DOCTOR
[by Britney's side] The boys are just shocked at how good you look, Britney. [glares at Stan and Kyle] Right, boys?!
KYLE
Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable. [Britney gargles something back. The boys join the doctor at her side]
DOCTOR
Well, I'll let you boys have your say. [walks off. Britney gargles something]
STAN
[his voice shaking] Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself.
KYLE
Oh, God, what have we done?!
[Britney Watch returns, complete with montage and music]
ANNOUNCER
It's Britney Watch! Keeping you up-to-date with all your Britney Spears news!
REPORTER
[outside Denver Medical Center, with photographers swarming the area] You won't believe what Britney's done now. The troubled pop star has just been spotted with a crazy "no top part of my head" look. This video [shown as he speaks] was taken just hours ago as Britney was wheeled into the hospital for some reason. And if we zoom in on the footage, right, ri-right here [the camera zooms in on the left breast], you can also definitely see a boob job scar. No doubt now that she's had plastic surgery in the past.
ANCHORMAN
O ho ho, oh houch, that's gotta be embarrassing. Chris, any word on why Ms. Spears went for this radical "no top of the head" look?
CHRIS
No word yet, Tom, but it could be over the embarrassment of the boob job scar video we showed just, just now. Uh, even though the timing doesn't quite work out.
[Denver Medical Center, Britney's recovery room. The window begins to crowd with photographers and flash bulbs begin to go off. Stan and Kyle look back at the window. The photographers begin to clamor for Britney's attention]
KYLE
[he and Stan are blinded by the flash] Dude! [the doctor reaches the curtains and closes them, but the flashes don't stop going off]
DOCTOR
Damn it, she can't handle any stress right now!
MANAGER
Excuse me, I'm Britney Spears' manager. [sees her in bed] Oh, jeez, Britney! Britney, what were ya thinkin'? First you shave your head and now this.
BRITNEY
Guglo.
MANAGER
Well, it's a ballsy new look, I'll give you that.
PAPARAZZO
Brit! Over here, Brit. One for Star Weekly. [Britney instinctively raises her left arm to shield her eyes from the camera, though she has no eyes now]
DOCTOR
Damn it you have to take her out of here; she can't be around all this right now.
BRITNEY
Right. We need to take her home. Boys, can you give me a hand with her?
STAN
Yeah, of course. [begins to help out]
[A side entrance. The manager opens the door and looks around for any photographers]
MANAGER
[softly] Okay, come on! [leads the boys and Britney out] My car is right here. [opens the door and gets in. The photographers are within earshot...]
PHOTOGRAPHER 3
Hey look!
PHOTOGRAPHER 4
There she is! [A photographer points and his face becomes distorted. The photographers rush the car before the manager can leave]
KYLE
Oh crap! [the photographers again clamor for Britney's attention, and one of them asks about her choice of shoes]
STAN
Jesus Christ!
MANAGER
Yeah yeah, it's like this all the time. [to the photographers] Thank you! Yes, thanks. [drives out of the crowd and peels away. The paparazzi look on and then pursue the car on foot]
STAN
Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can.
MANAGER
That's great, boys. Britney seems to have really taken a liking to you. And don't worry: Britney is a queen at reinventing herself. We just need to get her into the recording studio right away.
KYLE
What?!
[Britney's recording studio. Stan and Kyle are there with the manager and the studio crew, and they're outraged at the way Britney is being treated.]
MANAGER
All right, Britney, let's take it from the top. Remember to bring that sexiness to it.
KYLE
Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?
BRUCE
All right, Brit, let's try it from the top. [a studio hand gives her some headphones to work with, and she holds them up against what would be her right ear. She gargles intermittently]
FEMALE AIDE
God, what a train wreck.
MALE AIDE
She must be stoned again. [Britney continues to gargle more often and longer]
STAN
Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse.
MANAGER
Whattaya mean? She sounds great. [suddenly stops the music] Ah, Britney, that last lyric is supposed to be "love elation". Sounds more like you're saying "love creation".
BRITNEY
Gogehah.
MANAGER
E-la-tion. Really enunciate the L.
BRITNEY
Egeul-gageol
BRUCE
Gah, she's so stupid.
STAN
What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!
BRUCE
I know. She's really dumb, huh? [smiles]
STAN
No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone!
BRUCE
[cups his hands like he's grabbing Britney] Yeah. And she's all fat, too.
BRITNEY
Okel?
[MTV Video Music Awards 2007]
ANNOUNCER
Live, from Las Vegas, it's the MTV Video Music Awards
VJ
What's up, y'all? It's the MTV Awards and we are kickin' it off right. Here to perform her new song is the one, and only, Britney Spears! [two stage hands walk Britney out on stage]
KYLE
Aw come on now, people! [the manager is pleased with the performance]
WOMAN
Oh my God, she's really gotten chubby. [the song begins: "It's Britney, bitch!" Britney is waiting for her cue as dancers swirl around her. She begins to warble, and it echoes. She walks and immediately a dancer keeps her from falling.]
SINGERS
The way she fee-els. [Britney leans over, and another dancer stands her up again. She warbles some more] Love inside.
MAN
Oh man, she's totally lip-syncing.
STAN
[annoyed] She doesn't have any lips!
SINGERS
Temporary. [Britney warbles some more. Two male dancers come by and turn her around so the camera can focus on her ass] So hot! [a few moments she gets a solo segment and four male dancers fawn over her]
[Post-Awards report]
REPORTER
Disaster at the MTV awards. People are ridiculing Britney Spears. Her performance was awful, Tom. She looked tired, she looked fat, she didn't have a head. It was just completely phoned in. No doubt, Tom, that girl has major issues.
[A green room. Britney, her manager, and the boys are watching the news report]
MANAGER
Don't listen to 'em, Brit! They're all just jealous. And we can put you on SlimFast tomorrow. [walks over to the door and opens it. The paparazzi is there, piled on from floor to ceiling] Hang on, hang on, she'll be out in a minute. [leaves, closing the door. No paparazzi get in. Once the place is silent, she sits back on her armchair and relaxes with a sigh. Stan and Kyle can only look on]
STAN
We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace.
KYLE
Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?
STAN
[strokes his chin and takes a few steps forward] I know where.
[TransTrak station: "Travel by Train." It's 2:24 in the afternoon when Stan pops up at the window]
STAN
We want three tickets to the North Pole. [the clerk stops what he's doing and looks around]
CLERK
The North Pole? [leaves his chair and walks to the window] Who the hell goes to the North Pole?
STAN
We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt. [Kyle and Britney stand behind him. Britney is wearing a wig, sunglasses, and hat as a disguise]
[Britney Watch returns...]
ANNOUNCER
[breathless] It's Britney Wowtch!
RON
A distraught Britney Spears has apparently disappeared and abandoned all those close to her. A local housewife caught a photo of Britney running away in this disguise! [a shot of Stan and Kyle leading Britney down the street]
ROBERT POONER
Britney is obviously very upset about her MTV performance, Ron, and so she's become desperate. Most troubling for her is the fact that her disguise has total camel toe. [the camera zooms in on her crotch to show what looks like a camel's toe under her shorts]
RON
Oooooh, ouch!
ANCHORWOMAN
Oh boy, now, Leslie, this seems like a really bad camel toe offense.
LESLIE
Absolutely major camel toe, Tracy. Britney just seems oblivious. She was bound to get noticed: you walk around with that kind of cam toe and you're gonna turn heads.
RON
[grunts a little] Eh, David, any idea as to how big the camel toe actually was? [a shot of Britney and a camel toe together]
ROBERT POONER
She was sportin' toe like never before, Brian. I, I don't know what's wrong with that girl, but, it's a slap in the face to camels all over the planet.
RON
Those close to Britney say they are very worried and want to bring her home safe. And now back to the local news.
TRACY
[a picture of Butters being dragged towards an animal control truck] The giant squirrel which was picked up last week by animal control apparently now thinks it's a person. Colorado officials have taken the squirrel to Johns-Hopkins for psychiatric evaluation.
RON
Hm, that squirrel is obviously nuts.
[The platform at TransTrak.]
KYLE
Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station.
PAPARAZZO
[behind the boys] There she is! It's Britney! [more photographers show up and begin to take pictures]
STAN
Oh no. [he and Kyle quickly whisk Britney away, the photographers hot on their tails. They pass a room whose door is slightly open. Seconds later they return to it, go in, and shut the door]
STAN
Dude, they're never gonna let us through.
KYLE
Yes they are! I have an idea.
PAPARAZZO 2
Britney? Where'd she go?
PAPARAZZO 3
There she is! [Kyle appears wearing Britney's disguise. He turns to look at the paparazzi, then runs away. The paparazzi start taking pictures and following him. He runs down the street, the paparazzi pursue him]
[Inside the train. Stan leads Britney to a couple of seats by a window. Britney is wearing Kyle's hat]
STAN
It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon. [Britney gargles something]
[The streets. Kyle continues to lead the paparazzi away from Britney and tries to lose them at the same time]
MANAGER
There she is. Hey Britney, it's me. [Kyle ignores him and keeps running. He joins the paparazzi in chasing "Britney" down. Kyle runs through a park; they're right behnd him. Kyle runs into a garden full of statues, stops, and turns around] Britney. It's over. What were you runnin' for anyway?
REPORTER
Hey, wait a minute. Where's her camel toe?!
KYLE
[takes off the sunglasses] I'm not Britney Spears, all right?!
PAPARAZZO 5
Ooo, psych!
MANAGER
She must be back at the train station; come on! [they turn around and go back]
KYLE
Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute! [the group turns around. Kyle drops the sunglasses] Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?
PAPARAZZO 6
[steps forward] Son, you don't seem to understand. Britney Spears... has to die.
KYLE
[quizzically] Huh? [thunder starts rolling in the distance]
PAPARAZZO 7
What do you think all this effort has been for?
MANAGER
[a sinister smile crosses his face] It cannot be stopped. The purpose is too great.
OFFICER
It's not just the press. Everyone agrees. She must... die.
BACKGROUND SINGERS
Hetus. Alte omnebus. [the photographers begins to join in] Virtu e poquebus. [other adults join in this nonsensical Latin chant]
[The TransTrak train heads north through the Rockies]
NARRATOR
Little Stanley was tired and hungry. But he knew that for Britney Spears to be safe, he had to get her to the North Pole.
STAN
You doing okay, Ms. Spears? [she gargles. From the train's cab, the conductor looks back at Britney and Stan through the cab door's window]
CONDUCTOR
[on the phone] It's her. Um no, I'm sure it's Britney Spears; [looks at a photo] it looks just like the picture. [the photo he holds is that of a camel's toe, not of Britney] You want me to, to what? Yes, I understand. [begins chanting] Rectus. Hoc honebus
[A small town. A car stops and its passengers empty out: Britney's manager, two cameramen, and Kyle. The manager walks up to an elderly man and shakes hands with him]
ELDERLY MAN
Hello, I'm Bob Summers, so happy you picked our little town.
KYLE
What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!
BOB SUMMERS
Well nobody wants her to die, little boy. We all simply... need her to. Do you understand?
KYLE
NO!
PAPARAZZO 8
Look, kid, throughout history people have found it necessary to engage in... human sacrifice.
BOB SUMMERS
In ancient times, humans would commonly pick one lovely girl, adorn her with jewels, treat her like a goddess, and then... watch her die.
PAPARAZZO 9
We like to think we're more civilized now, but the truth is our lust for torture and death is no different than it was in gladiator times.
PAPARAZZO 10
Only difference is that now we like to watch people put to death through magazines and photographs.
CANADIAN PAPARAZZO
It's a damn shame too. Old ways were bettah. Used to be we just picked someone by lottery an' then stoned them to death.
WOMAN
Stonin' to death was too violent. Rather have the sacrifice kill itself.
KYLE
You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?
MAN
Britney was chosen a long time ago, to be built up and adored, and then sacrificed. For harvest.
PAPARAZZO 11
All right, everyone's about here.
KYLE
[bewildered] Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?!
[The TransTrak train. Everyone is sleeping when the train comes to a sudden stop and the whistle blows. They wake up.]
MALE PASSENGER
Hey, where are we? This isn't right. [Stan looks out the window quickly. Outside is an empty field, but a horde of photographers race through it and reach the train, clamoring for her attention and ready to take pictures]
STAN
Oh no!
BRITNEY
Ohhh thoooo!
STAN
[hops down and grabs Britney's hand] Come on, Britney! [pulls her out the opposite side and into the field] Come on, come on! [as they run, Kyle's hat falls away. They reach the end of the field and enter a clearing. They look around and find themselves surrounded. All sorts of people are there, not just paparazzi. The escape route they just used is closed off by more spectators. Stan looks around and some faces are recognizable, like Irene. Sheila and Gerald show up]
KYLE
Mom, Dad! [runs up to them] They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here?
GERALD
It's okay, Kyle. Just... be a good boy.
KYLE
Be a good boy? You know all about this?
STAN
Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?
KYLE
She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!
STAN
Sacrificed? For what?
RANDY
For harvest, Stanley. Same reason we've always done it.
CANADIAN PAPARAZZO
Sacrifice in March, corn have plenty starch.
KYLE
Corn harvest!
RANDY
We haven't told you about it, Stanley, because we, we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest.
STAN
All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough!
MANAGER
The kid is right. This has gone on too long.
PAPARAZZO 12
Yeah. She was supposed to have killed herself a long time ago.
FARMER
And harvest is coming soon.
BOB SUMMERS
All right, folks, let's finish this quickly. [everyone whips out a camera and starts taking pictures, closing in on Britney all the while]
STAN
No wait. [Britney groans. People get close, take pictures, then make way for more people]
WOMAN 2
Come on, hurry up.
WOMAN 3
[obese] I can't run. You go ahead, I'll catch up with ya. [the barrage of picture-taking continues. The McCormicks come up to take pictures. Britney drops to the ground, sort of pleading to be left alone]
MOTHER
Here Davey. [hands a camera to her son. The barrage continues, with Randy, Liane, other familiar faces... Britney wilts under the lights and finally lies down completely]
BOB SUMMERS
[throws out his arms] Hold on. [a doctor walks up and checks for vital signs]
DOCTOR
She's dead.
RANDY
Well, I think it's time for us to leave the poor girl alone. [everyone turns and goes off in different directions under a windy and thunderous sky. Stan is left alone staring at Britney's corpse. Kyle is a little further away, but he too looks at the corpse]
[Harvest time, dawn. The corn fields are shown, their stalks tall and full of corn. Three men are harvesting corn by hand nearby, and a motorized harvester takes care of corn in the distance]
[The town, late morning. A farmer's market is up. Two men are shown close-up in a booth stocked with yellow and white corn]
GIL
Mornin' Bill.
BILL
Mornin' Gil.
GIL
[inspecting some yellow corn] Nice-lookin' corn.
[South Park Market, day. Randy and Sharon check out the corn. Sheila passes.]
SHEILA
Hey Sharon, Randy, great harvest, huh? [begins to check out the corn as well. Sharon puts some corn into her shopping cart]
RANDY
An incredible harvest. Some of the best corn I've seen in years.
ET REPORTER
[on TV screens throughout the store] She's the daughter of a country singer, and the young girl has really taken the country by storm. Hannah Montana's Miley Cyrus, though only fifteen years old, is already on her way to being a major superstar.
JIMBO
[near the beginning of the report] Hey, check it out! [the report ends and ominous music begins]
RANDY
[glued to the screen] Looks like next harvest will be even better. [begins to chant. The other shoppers join in, then Sheila, and finally, Stan and Kyle, who have apparently given up on talking sense to the adults. The image of the ET reporter and Miley stays onscreen]
End of Britney's New Look


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:In a South Park homage to the 1981 film, "Heavy Metal", the boys are trying to get Kenny off the latest drug craze that's captured the junior high and under set.

script:Major Boobage

[South Park Elementary, day, Mrs. Garrison's classroom. Mr. Mackey is speaking to the class]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, kids, we have something very serious we need to discuss today, hm'kay? It appears that some kids in school are getting high by choking themselves. Some kids call it "The Choking Game", hm'kay but, but choking yourself is bad. Hm'kay? Don-, don't do that. Hm'kay?
KYLE
You can get high from choking yourself? [Kenny feels for his neck through his hood, then squeezes once he finds it]
MR. MACKEY
Schoolchildren are often experimenting with dangerous ways to get high, hm'kay, like sniffin' glue, guzzlin' cough medicine, huffin' paint, hm'kay? But they're all bad. M'kay?
BUTTERS
Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee.
CARTMAN
Cat pee? [Kenny lets up and then tries to choke himself again]
STAN
That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you?
MR. MACKEY
Well, it's a it's not actually cat urine, but male cats, when they're marking their territory, uh spread concentrated urine to fend off other male cats and... a-and that could get you really high. M'kay? Re-really reeeally high. Okay? [Kenny is trying really hard to choke himself] Probably shou-shouldn't have told you that just now. Hm'kay? Tha, that was probably bad.
[Cartman's house, day. The original four boys are there, gathered around the coffee table on which stands a frame holding a cat in a harness. Cartman is almost done with the cat]
CARTMAN
All right, this should keep my cat in place while he sprays the urine. [Mr. Kitty meows] Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now? [Mr. Kitty meows]
KYLE
You guys are wasting your time.
STAN
Yeah, this is not gonna work.
CARTMAN
Okay, ready Kenny?
KENNY
(All set.)
CARTMAN
All right, bring out...! The other male cat. [Kyle walks to a pet carrier, opens the door, pulls out a brown striped cat, and places it on the coffee table opposite Mr. Kitty. The two cats meow at each other first, then growl at each other. After a short while, Mr. Kitty shoots concentrated piss into Kenny's face]
KENNY
(Woah.)
KYLE
Whoa! [Kenny staggers backwards. The other guys gather round him]
STAN
Do you feel anything?
CARTMAN
Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed? [Kenny's not responding. His mind is elsewhere...]
[Kenny's eyes are unfocused as his mind goes into an altered state. He seems to be going through space, then an acid trip, then both. Kenny descends into a Thunderbird fitted with rocket boosters and takes the wheel. He heads towards a desert planet and lands with a thud. He quickly shifts gears and peels away. He drives through the desert landscape until a curvaceous woman steps into his path. He stops. She wears a stylized cowboy hat and skimpy clothes. Kenny motions over and lets her take the wheel. Kenny can't help but look at her breasts. They head towards a huge building with breast-shaped touches all overs. The woman steps out and walks towards the stairs, then enters the building. Kenny quickly follows suit. As they walk through the building a creature stabs another one through the skull, killing him]
KENNY
(Hey cool! Check it out!)
FATHER
I see that you're enticed by my daughter's awesome rocking tits.
KENNY
(Yeahhh!)
FATHER
Then bathe with my daughter in the fountain of Varnov. Appease the gods by lathering her boobs with soapy suds.
KENNY
(Okay!) [follows her towards the fountain. At the fountain's edge, she undresses, then he begins to undress] (Woop! Woo-hoo!)
CARTMAN
[through Kenny's hallucination] Kenny! Kenny, wake up! [In the middle of town, Cartman is stopping Kenny from disrobing any further] Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny!
KENNY
(What?) [opens his eyes and looks around] (Where'd she go?) [stands up and pulls up his pants.]
CARTMAN
Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls.
KENNY
(You fucking asshole!)
CARTMAN
Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you?
KENNY
[Punching Cartman] (What the fuck did you do that for?)
CARTMAN
Ah, Kenny! [Stan and Kyle come up to restrain Kenny]
KYLE
Dude! Dude, Kenny, calm down!
KENNY
[walks away from them a bit, mad] (Aww i was so close! You should have seen her titties.)
STAN
What titties?
KENNY
[turns around] (The titties! Oh my god, they were incredible!)
KYLE
Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering.
STAN
Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes.
KENNY
(I almost... touched them.)
KYLE
Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore.
[The Broflovski house, living room. Gerald walks in, grabs the remote from the sofa, turns on the TV, and sits down to watch]
ANNOUNCER
Next on FOX News! [SPECIAL REPORT: FOX NEWS] It's the newest drug craze. and it's killing your kids! ["killing your kids" appears over scenes of kids falling over]
GERALD
Killing our kids? [leans forward]
REPORTER
All over America, kids are getting high... on cat urine! [two women have their cats face off, and one of them gets concentrated urine on her face. She laughs] Huffing cat urine apparently causes a euphoric state [the affected woman moved her arms up and open, then freezes as her eyes get unfocused] and is also referred to as... cheesing. [Letters cut out into cheese shapes appear: "CHEESING". Cut to the front of J. Brown Elementary School, day.] Why "cheesing"? Because it's "fon to due". [the words appear onscreen. Cut to a girl's silhouette] This sixth grade girl said she's been snorting cat piss for several months.
GIRL
[in a deep, electronically-altered voice] We sometimes sneak out during recess and a friend named _________ goes and gets her cats, and we'll just cheese all day long.
GERALD
Oh my God! Sheila! Come look at this!
REPORTER
So how can you tell if your child is cheesing? [some graphics begin to appear]
1. Your child seems distant, preoccupied.
2. Your child's face smells like cat urine.
3. When you see tigers at the zoo, your child starts grinding his or her teeth.
You might also notice by certain phrases your child says to school friends, such as "Hey, let's go cheese." or "Do you feel like cheesing, guys?" or "Dude, I'm cheesing my F-ing brains out right now."
SHEILA
[now standing next to Gerald] Kids are doing this?
REPORTER
Kids do it because it's legal. [a teen boy looks at the camera with a fierce face. A skull and crossbones appear over it] What can you do before it's too late? [a picture of a cat switches with its negative for a strobe effect a few times, then ends with the negative and an echoing meow]
GERALD
We have to protect our children from this, Sheila.
[Town meeting, next day. On stage are Mr. Mackey, Principal Victoria, Mayor McDaniels, Gerald (at the podium), Sheila, and Officer Barbrady]
GERALD
Twenty percent of American students aged six to twelve say they have tried cheesing at least once. Kids also refer to it as "the cheese game", or "vitamin cheese", or "Mary Jane piss in your face fun time". Cheesing is spreading fast.
SHARON
[stands up] All right, we're all sufficiently scared, Gerald, but what could we do?
GERALD
I have written up a bill that would make having a cat illegal in the city of South Park.
STEPHEN
[stands up] Gerald's right. We all have to face it. Cats are deadly animals! If you stick your nose up their crotch and snort their piss, they can kill you!
GERALD
With my super lawyer powers, we can rid our town of cats, so that our kids can never get high again!
RANDY
[stands up again] Let's hear it for Gerald!
STEPHEN
[stands up again] Hooray for Gerald! [the rest of the audience begins to cheer and argue]
[The neighborhood. Black vans arrive and DEA agents jump out of them. The agents enter people's houses and confiscate any cats found there. Some agents take away a small boy's cat. Bebe loses her cat Thumper to a pet carrier. Craig Tucker's sister in her sandbox cries as an agent grabs her cat out of her hands]
TRICIA
No! No!
AGENT 1
Oh wah wah! Get over it, druggie. [walks off with the cat] Jeez... [Two other agents leave another house with a cat]
MAN
Goodbye, Scrambles. [his daughter cries into his left pant leg] We'll miss you. [nearby, the cats are tossed into the DEA vans and taken away]
[Kenny's house, night. He's about to cheese when two agents break in and confiscate the two cats he has there]
AGENT 2
Got two here.
KENNY
(Hey! What the fuck are you doing?!)
AGENT 1
Sorry, these are illegal.
KENNY
(What?! No! What are you doing?!) [the agents toss the cats into the van] (You fuckers!) [the van drives off.]
[Cartman's house. Three agents comb the living room]
CARTMAN
Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off. [the agents soon leave, and Cartman walks up to the dim attic with a small book] Shh. Mr. Kitty, you have to live in the attic for now. [drops the book in front of the cat] Here. Write a diary.
[South Park Elementary, day, hallway. Butters stands around while Cartman and Stan visit their lockers. Kyle walks up to them.]
KYLE
Guys, have you seen Kenny?
STAN
Nah, I think Kenny's out sick today.
KYLE
Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys... [Cartman and Stan turn to listen] I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing.
BUTTERS
Aww, come on. Kenny knows how dangerous cheesing is.
STAN
Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed.
CARTMAN
Yeah, who has cats these days? [laughs nervously]
KYLE
Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now.
[Kenny's hallucination. He's back in the alternate world, this time riding a giant bird, but the landscape is the same - breast shapes are everywhere. Kenny sees the large-breasted woman from his first trip, but now she's strapped onto a rack and is being whipped by three burly men. These men are mutants with four breasts instead of two, and two more breasts on their shoulders. Kenny lands and hops off the bird, finds a metal spear nearby, and launches it. It strikes the middle mutant man through the neck and out the sternum, killing him. The other two run away. Kenny runs to the woman, and she smiles at him. They both ride on the giant bird, with the woman's boobs resting on Kenny's head]
KENNY
(Woohoohoo! Woooohoooo! Woooohoohoo!)
[Kenny's house. Kyle, Stan, and Butters stand outside his door. Kyle pounds at the door.]
KYLE
Kenny? [pounds three more times]
STAN
Kenny, you home? [Kenny yells some more. Alarmed, the boys open the door and enter the house. They see that Kenny was indeed cheesing. Two cats look back at them.]
KENNY
[really high] (Wooooooohoohoo! Woo! Wazzup? Wazzup?) [one cat runs out]
KYLE
Kenny!
KENNY
[still cheering and making flying motions] (Victory! Ho-Ho! Wooooooo!)
BUTTERS
Whoa boy, he's cheesed out of his mind! [Kenny flutters some more, stops, and passes out, falling to the floor]
STAN, KYLE
Kenny!
[Moments later, Kenny is at the dining room table. A lock of his hair peeks out from under his hood. Butters has prepared a cup of coffee and gives it to him. Stan and Kyle stand nearby]
BUTTERS
There you go. Well, try some coffee, Ken.
KENNY
[groans]
KYLE
Kenny, we need to have a serious talk.
KENNY
(No we don't, guys.)
STAN
Yes, we do. We're your friends, dude. We're not gonna let you ruin your life.
KENNY
(I'm not ruining my life, okay? Will you guys just back the fuck off?)
KYLE
Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese! [abruptly, Kenny vomits, stops, then vomits again. Some of it gets on Butters' face and shirt.]
BUTTERS
Yeah, that's it little buddy. Just let it out.
STAN
Kenny, I know we're super-cool and everything, but if we ever catch you cheesing again, we're gonna tell on you.
KENNY
[exhausted] (Ugh, okay, okay, I just wanna sleep now.)
BUTTERS
Yeah, he needs some sleepy night-night, doesn't he, buddy?
KYLE
[grabs the other cat as it walks up to him] We've gotta keep this away from him.
[Cartman's house, night, Cartman's room. He's asleep. A cat meows and awakens him. The cat meows again]
CARTMAN
[sits up] Mr. Kitty, shhh! [Mr. Kitty meows a 3rd time] Damn it! [gets up and leaves the bed. A small door to the attic opens and Cartman pops in with a candle. Mr. Kitty is nearby] Shhh, Mr. Kitty you have to be quiet, or else they're gonna find you. [Mr. Kitty goes to a window and meows. Cartman follows him to the window] What?! [looks out a half-moon window and sees a cat, it meows] It's the neighbor cat. He hasn't been caught yet. [Mr. Kitty meows] No- no, Mr. Kitty. I know you like Rufus, but he has to fend for himself. [Mr. Kitty meows] I can't hide anymore cats, Mr. Kitty. [crosses his arms] I'm in trouble enough as it is. [Mr. Kitty paws at Cartman] All right, all right, fine. [heads to the attic door and goes downstairs, closing the door behind him]
[Cartman's house, outside. Cartman appears around a corner dressed in overcoat and fedora]
CARTMAN
[whispers and motions] All right. Come on, Rufus. Quietly. [two kittens walk up next to Rufus] Oh jeez, no, no, I can't hide you all. [they all look at him sadly, one of them meows] I'm sorry, you'll just have to find somewhere else to- [the cats lower their head further while focusing on Cartman, Cartman starts to have tears in his eyes] Well, I suppose I'll get in just as much trouble for four cats as for two. Come on. [turns and leaves]
[Kyle's house, day, Kyle's room. Sheila enters with folded clothes, walks to Kyle's dresser, and starts putting his clothes away. After putting away a pair of briefs she spots a cat hidden between his shirts and his briefs]
SHEILA
Huh? [removes the clothes hiding the cat] Oh my God... [moments later she's downstairs standing next to Gerald.]
GERALD
Kyle! Kyle, can we talk to you for a minute, please?
KYLE
[walks up to them] Yeah?
GERALD
Kyle, have you been getting high?!
KYLE
[shrugs] No.
GERALD
Then why did your mother find this [holds up a bag of contraband - the cat] in your dresser drawer?!
KYLE
[holds his hands out in denial] All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend.
SHEILA
[pointing] Don't lie to us, Kyle!
GERALD
How long have you been on the cheese?!
KYLE
I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.
GERALD
Get up to your room right now until your mother and I figure out how to deal with this!
KYLE
Dad, will you just listen to me for a second?
GERALD
Now, Kyle!
KYLE
God! [goes upstairs]
SHEILA
Gerald, what are we gonna do? Our son is a cat pee addict!
GERALD
First thing is we've gotta dispose of this!
SHEILA
What are you gonna do?
GERALD
I'd better just... take it down to the basement for now, m-make sure Kyle can't find it. [heads off]
[The basement. The door opens and Gerald enters. He locks the door and goes down a few steps, then looks at the cat.]
GERALD
[showing a weakness of some sort] No. No, what am I thinking? I shouldn't do this. [continues down the steps] I've been clean for ten... years. I haven't even been near a cat. [getting dramatic] But then that report said our kids were doing it too, and... and I knew Kyle would have the same sicknesses I used to have... Now a cat is in our home, and it's too tempting. [approaches a contraption similar to the one Cartman made, but this one has a movie projector and screen. He takes the cat out of the bag and straps it into the contraption] I... I'll just do it one more time. [ties the cat's tail to the roof of the contraption's frame so there's no obstruction] One. Last. Time. [unfurls the screen] Then I'll call the police; have them pick up the cat. [moves a large empty box aside] And then I'll never do it again. [kneels down at the table and grabs the projector's trigger] After this one... last... time... [click. The projector begins to roll and a cat appears onscreen. The cat in the harness gets excited and begins to snarl. It finally squirts and Gerald stumbles backward a bit. He walks backward and freezes, his eyes unfocused]
[Gerald's hallucination. He enters the same alternate universe Kenny has been in, but he's flying a B-17 bomber called Jewish Princess. He lands on the same desert planet Kenny landed on earlier. He gets off the plane and is greeted by the large-breasted woman]
GERALD
I couldn't stay away. Curse your rockin' tits!
[Cartman's house, day. The doorbell rings. Cartman rushes to answer it.]
CARTMAN
Who is it?!
WOMAN
[with a foreign accent] Please! Open the door. [he opens the door, and a middle-aged woman stands before him] They say you are hiding cats.
CARTMAN
[quickly looks both ways] Hiding cats? [nervously] Why, that would be illegal. [backs into the living room]
WOMAN
[enters] You don't understand [kneels] My little Nishka, [produces the cat] She has nowhere else to go.
CARTMAN
Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another.
WOMAN
But they will find her.
CARTMAN
I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can- [his weakness comes through as the cat gazes at him] Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more...
WOMAN
[hands him Nishka, Cartman takes Nishka and pets her] Oh, you show such kindness in such darkest of times. [begins to sob. Cartman joins her]
[Cartman's attic, or secret annex. Cartman opens the door and is about to drop Nishka in when something catches his attention]
CARTMAN
What the hell? [Kenny has somehow found the cats and is squeezing them to get cheesed. His face and parka are covered with concentrated piss. He grabs another cat and cheeses some more] Kenny, get out of here!
KENNY
(Woooooh! Woooooh!) [Kenny dances out of the attic]
CARTMAN
Aw, crap- Kenny! [Cartman begins to follow him down, but stops temporarily] Bad. Kitties.
[Kyle's room, day. He's moping around when the doorbell rings]
KYLE
Dad! Somebody's at the front door! [the doorbell rings twice and Kyle goes to his room door] Well am I grounded or not?! [the doorbell rings three times] Ugh. Fine! I'll get it! [leaves his room and opens the front door]
STAN
Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up.
CARTMAN
He's cheesing his fucking balls off, dude.
KYLE
[quizzically] What?
STAN
He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.
KYLE
What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!
CARTMAN
They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand! [crosses his arms and looks away. Stan opens his mouth in shock, Kyle looks angrily at Cartman]
STAN
Come on, we've gotta find Kenny before he hurts himself.
KYLE
I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad?
[The huge Steamline building the large-breasted woman led Kenny into before. This time, she leads Gerald in.]
GERALD
Hey everybody. Good to see you again. [Gerald and the woman head for the fountain. They both start undressing.]
FATHER
Hold! You cannot yet caress my daughter's awesome boobage!
GERALD
Huh... how come?
FATHER
There is... another suitor. [Kenny walks into view]
GERALD
What? [sees who it is] Get out of here, kid!
KENNY
(No, fuck you! She's my girl!)
GERALD
You're too young for this stuff!
FATHER
This must be decided at the Breastriary in Nippopolis! [the woman hides her privates, her father's arm blocks a full view of her breasts]
[The Breastriary. It's built like the Colosseum in Rome, but each level has a different design... made of concrete breasts. The interior too is made of breast-shaped pieces, including a magnificent entrance made of ten massive breasts]
FATHER
Now fight for the Loc-Nar trophy! [the camera pans down and left to reveal a golden trophy made of two female statuettes kneeling back to back and holding their arms out. The woman places her breasts on their hands so it looks like the actual trophy is her breasts.]
[The Breastriary floor. Kenny and Gerald face off in a joust on giant ostriches - who also have big breasts. Their lances have protective tips made of a giant breast for each lance. The rivals hold their lances up, bring them down, and charge at each other. They knock each other off the ostriches and the crowd roars. The father, emperor of this place, sits down to enjoy the match. Kenny grabs a sword with a hilt made of a pair of breasts. Gerald grabs a breast-shaped shield and a battle ax with a normal blade on one side and a pair of breasts on the other. They are evenly matched, as neither can gain an advantage over the other.]
[A sand box in a city park, day. Gerald and Kenny are fighting in it, oblivious to the crowd gathering around them. They grunt and punch each other. Kyle, Stan, and Cartman show up and Kyle spots Gerald]
KYLE
Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
JIMBO
They've been goin' at it for a good thirty minutes.
GERALD
She's mine, you little asshole!
KENNY
(Get the fuck off of me!)
SHEILA
[arriving] Gerald?!
[A news report. A Channel 4 news reporter stands by]
REPORTER
The key proponent of the cat ban has been charged with cheesing in a public park. Gerald Broflovski is prepared to give a public statement.
GERALD
I would like to address a personal matter: I have let myself down. And I would first like to apologize to my lovely wife.
SHEILA
Don't touch me.
GERALD
And to the people of South Park. [a shot of the town square and its citizens] I was wrong, and I can't let cats take the fall anymore. It's our fault. The people who use cats for their sweet urine. [Kenny looks down in shame] We have to learn that cheesing just isn't worth it. Sure, you get to fight in the Breastriary, and swim in the Fountains of Varnov with the Itty Titty Fairies of Mammary Mountain.
STAN
[puzzled] What the hell is he talking about?
KYLE
[eyes closed] I have no idea.
GERALD
And then you fight the Boob Goblin in the Gazongas Cave, and then the girl may thank you for it. But she. Isn't. Real.
RANDY
And you never really get a good look at her naked boobs anyway. [Sharon glares at him.]
GERALD
Problem is, the more you go into that world, the more you need to go. Until you start blowing off all the real people who care about you. [Kenny looks down again]
KENNY
(Yeah. I guess so.)
GERALD
Cats aren't the problem. We made cats illegal and and then I cheesed for the first time in ten years. And kids are always gonna find a new way to get high. Like sniffing glue or licking toads, or fermenting feces or huffing paint. You can also look at-
STEPHEN
[cupping Butters' ears so Butters can't hear anything] Uh okay, that's probably good, Gerald.
GERALD
The point is, I was wrong. Its time to legalize cats! [grins wide, then begins to cheer] Heh yeah! Hooray for Gerald! Hey, let's hear it for Gerald! [crowd remains silent]
[South Park, day. The camera drops down and focuses on Scrambles' house. The DEA agents return and gives Scrambles back to his family]
GIRL 2'S FATHER
Scrambles! So good to have you back! You ain't sore at us, are ya? [Scrambles hisses, then scratches the father all over his head. His frightened wife and daughter leave him alone] Ahh! Get him off! [the boys, standing across the street, turn around]
STAN
I'm sure glad that's over with. [the boys turn left and walk away]
KENNY
(Me too.)
CARTMAN
But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong. [Kyle stops]
KYLE
[cross] And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?
CARTMAN
[strokes his chin] Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle.
STAN
You guys! Check it out. [smiles] It's Kenny. [Kenny has crossed the street to reach a flower patch. He picks one out and inhales deeply] Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life.
KYLE
Yeah. [Kenny begins to grab more flowers with gusto to get more of their aroma. The other boys get worried] He's getting... really high on life. [Kenny begins to snort and grabs all the flowers he can, treating them just as he did the cats earlier.]
CARTMAN
Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life.
KYLE
[runs to Kenny] Kenny! [Stan and Cartman follow. Kenny falls in Kyle's arms, goes into spasms, and then freezes, his eyes unfocused]
STAN
What the hell kind of flowers are those?
KYLE
Kenny? Kenny?!
[Kenny is back in the world of his hallucination, back in the modified Thunderbird. He's flying through space with the large-breasted woman at the wheel. Every planet and moon looks like a breast or pair of breasts.]
KENNY
[dances in time with the music, then gazes up at the woman's bouncing boobs] (Woo-hoo-hoo!)
[The Thunderbird goes into warp and disappears.]
End of Major Boobage

synopsis:The head of the World Canadian Bureau leads the country into a long and painful strike and the responsibility of brokering a settlement rests with the boys.

script:Canada on Strike

[The South Park Elementary school gym, day. The students have been called to show up there. Mr. Mackey comes out and stands in front of a big TV and between two bulky tower speakers]
MR. MACKEY
Students, quiet please, m'kay? As you may or may not know, today is Canada Appreciation Day.
CARTMAN
Oh God, I'm bored already.
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, so we've been asked to show you a video from the World Canadian Bureau. Uh start the tape please? [exits right as the tape starts up. A Canadian flag appears onscreen]
WCB PRESIDENT
[appears in his office onscreen] Hello, I am Stephen Abootman, President of the World Canadian Bureau. Do you ever stop to think how important Canada is to the world? Right now, I would like all students of Canadian descent in this school to stand up. [no one moves a muscle until one lone Canadian boy, Ike, stands up.] Just look at all these fine Canadians in your school. See how diverse they are. When you think of Canada, what's the one thing that comes to mind?
CARTMAN
Gayness! [everyone laughs and looks at Ike, who looks chagrined.]
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
That's right: spirit! What is it that makes Canada so important?
CRAIG
Nothing! [everyone laughs harder and looks at Ike.]
[Canada, day, a crowd stands in front of a building with G on it.]
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
My fellow Canadians, for too long we have been pushed around, and ridiculed! Yesterday was supposed to be a day of appreciation and understanding! Instead, Canada Appreciation Day was mocked worldwide! [the crowd begins to clamor]
MAN 1
[wearing #10] Nobody takes us Canadians seriousleh!
LUMBERJACK
It's like the world doesn't respect Canada at all, eh?
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
That's right! And I think it's time for Canada to show the world just how bad things would be without it! Together we can send a message! It's time for Canada ...to strike!
WOMAN 1
Did you say strike?
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Yes! Every Canadian join me! Join together!
MAN 2
Canada, on strike.
MAN 3
Canada, on strike.
CANADIANS
[a different crowd shot for each "Canadaaa"]
Canadaaa! Canadaaa! Canadaaa! Caaanaaadaaa!
Canada on strike! Canada says "No more!"
No more neglect! We want respect! That's what we're striking for!
All you bureaucrats and corporate cats
BORDER GUARD
Can all just take a hike! [rolls down his window shade]
CANADIANS
[large crowd] It's Canaada! On Strike!
[they whip out their strike signs]
Canada on strike! From Vancouver to St. John's [both locations are shown],
We raise our middle fingers for you all to sit upon!
[a hockey team] And with our fingers up your ass,
[workers at The Canadian Maple Syrup Company] you won't be very psyched
[workers in the building drop syrup barrels from the upper floors] It's Canada! On Strike!
[Mounties march in a circle] And we will not bow a bunch! Our resolve is strong!
[A conductor leads a group of singers] We even took three hours to rehearse this striking song! [a trumpeter leans in and toots.]
[Pizza Nut] Canada on strike! No matter where you are,
[On TV at Café 180] If you are Canadian then you've got to do your part!
March out of the halls!
CAFÉ 180 PATRON
[stands up and poses] That's right, suck my Canadian balls!
[runs out and poses] It's Canada! On Strike!
CANADIANS
[the camera zooms out to a view from space of a nation of singing Canadians]
It's Canada! Canada! Canada! On Strike!
[a lone Canadian laughs somewhere]
[The United Nations, day.]
SWISS DELEGATE
Ahhh, when you say "Canada is on strike", what exactly do you mean?
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
What do you think it means?! [pounds the table] We're striking, buddih! No more! That's it! Until we get what we want
FRENCH DELEGATE
Who exactly are you to authorize this strike?
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
I'm Stephen Abootman! Leader of the WGA!
FRENCH DELEGATE
The WGA?
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
[crosses his arms] Yes! The World Canadian Bureau! [the other delegates don't react.]
FRENCH DELEGATE
What exactly does Canada want?
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
We want: more... money!
AIDE 1
[with mustache] Yeah! More money!
JAPANESE DELEGATE
More money from where?
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Just more money! You know! Canada doesn't get enough money! Other countries have lots of money; we want, we want some of that money! Hu- how about- the Internet? The Internet makes lots of money! So give us some of that money!
AIDE 1
Yeah! Give us Internet money!
BRITISH DELEGATE
A Mister A- Abootman, you seem to- not understand how ...global economics works. I think that-
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Don't give me that fat-cat fancy lip-wiggling! Are you gonna give Canada more money or not?! [pounds his fist on the table a few times]
BRITISH DELEGATE
I'm afraid we can't.
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Then you leave Canada no choice. [heads for the doors. His aides open them and he heads out] This strike shall continue! [the aides head out, closing the doors behind them.]
[A snowy night in South Park, a shot of Kyle's room through his window. Kyle heads to the front end of his room to look out the window. Out on the sidewalk stands Ike with his own strike sign: "HONK if you support CANADA" Cars pass by without stopping. Kyle suffers for him. A car pulls up and Ike turns to face it]
HUSBAND
"Honk if you support Canada" He- hey honey, watch this. [honks twice]
WIFE
[looks at him] Oh, we're supporting unions.
HUSBAND
That's right; we're a very progressive couple.
WIFE
Yes. [reaches over and honks the horn] Oh, that's fun!
HUSBAND
Well we've done our good deed for the week. I think now I can make love to your anus without making God angry.
WIFE
Oh really? Goodie! [they drive off. Ike watches them leave]
[Stan's house, day. Stan, Butters, and Cartman are watching TV. Kyle walks in from outside]
KYLE
Guys, I'm really worried about my brother.
CARTMAN
We don't care. *urp*
KYLE
You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass!
STAN
Sh ush ush, it'sa it's on!
BUTTERS
Yippie!
ANNOUNCER
It's the Terrance and Phillip Show. [Terrance and Phillip in] Today's episode: I Fart Huckabees. [Terrance and Phillip are shown dressed in Viking warrior outfits]
BUTTERS
Aww, this one again?!
STAN
God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now!
TERRANCE
Say Phillip, I just bought this new hybrid car.
PHILLIP
Oh? Does it run on electricity?
TERRANCE
[the boys say the line too] No, it uses natural gas. [they do raspberries as Terrance farts on Phillip. Terrance and Phillip laugh]
PHILLIP
Not as fat as your face!
BUTTERS
Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings.
CARTMAN
God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!
KYLE
There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!
STAN
It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy. ["Terrance and Phillip" disappears and "Family Guy" comes on]
PETER GRIFFIN
You think that's bad? Remember the time I sang "La Cucaracha" for Paul McCartney?
CARTMAN
[jumps off the couch and runs to the TV] No! NOOO!
PETER GRIFFIN
La Cucaracha- [Cartman turns off the TV and faces his friends]
CARTMAN
We are NOT... resorting to that!
[Striking Canadians, day.]
CANADIANS
We want more! We want more!
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
One, two, three, four, Canada deserves more (money)! One, two, three, four, Canada deserves more (money)! [Terrance and Phillip walk up to him]
TERRANCE
Look, buddih, me and Phillip need to go home for a bit.
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Go home?! You can't leave the picket line!
TERRANCE
But this is taking too long, and Phillip is diabetic.
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Look, guy, we are to stay strong! If you don't stand with your fellow Canadians, then you are a rat!
TERRANCE
Don't call me a rat, buddih!
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
I'm not your buddih, friend!
PHILLIP
He's not your friend, guy!
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
I'm not your guy, buddih!
TERRANCE
He's not your buddih, friend!
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
I'm not your friend, guy! [all three fall silent, and Stephen goes forward] Don't you two understand anything?! You think striking is a joke?! You think it's something to ridicule?!
WEIRD HAT GUY
[pops in] Yah, you think this is funnih?
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
[moves to address the whole crowd] Don't you see that we have to stand together or else we have nothing?!
AIDE 1
[runs up with a cell phone] Stephen! Stephen! A call came in from the United States! They want to talk to you aboot ending the strike!
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
What did I tell you?! I told you we'd get to them sooner or later! [the crowd gets excited and starts chatting] Shh, shh, quiet everyone! Let me handle this. [everyone falls silent as he takes the call] Yes. This is Stephen Abootman, head of the WGA.
KYLE
Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike. [he's calling from his house, with the other boys standing back aways]
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Oh you do, huh?! [muffles the phone, then tells the others] They've had enough. They want us to end the strike. [everyone cheers] Quiet, quiet, shh, shh, sh- quiet, quiet! Let me deal with this. [the Canadians fall silent and Stephen returns to the phone] All right, we're prepared to end this strike! If you are agreeing that we should have more monihhh!
KYLE
We totally think you should have more money.
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Wwe got 'em! We did it! [jumps up and down with much energy. Everyone cheers. "Great job!"] All right, how much are you gonna give us?
KYLE
Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Oh, negotiating hardball, are we?! What about all that Internet money?!
KYLE
The Internet?
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
You listen to me, friend! [walks away from the crowd so they don't hear him so loudly] You'd better figure out a way to get us our fair amount of money, and until you come back with a solid fair number, I'm finished talking to you, you slimy corporate dickhead! [hangs up, then faces the crowd] Don't worry, don't worry. This is how negotiating works. This is good. We've got 'em by the balls.
[Kyle looks at the phone dumbfounded. The other boys walk up]
STAN
What'd they say?
KYLE
They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.
CARTMAN
How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?
BUTTERS
Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?
KYLE
We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.
CARTMAN
[steps up] Wait. I've got it.
[A video. Butters is on a stage with bluescreen so it looks like he's actually in a spaceship. He's in his normal clothes, and he begins to dance. To his right rises Spaceman Butters, and to his left rises Pajama Butters.]
BUTTERS
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt [the teddy bear outfit returns]
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt? [Stan gives a thumbs-up. Cartman does the same. The video is on YouToob]
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!

[from behind a big chocolate heart] It's okay
[Butters floating in space] Ih-if you have a little fight
[Nelly in her room watches the video] Don't you worry
[Butters bites into the heart] I won't bite (Not that hard)
[Spaceman Butters] If you want it
[a man watches the video] I'll give you power
Just be gentle
[Flower Butters] I'm delicate like a flower

Give it to me, if you please
Give it to me, if you please
NUN
Oh my.
BUTTERS
[now in three voices] I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
[wearing black jeans with "what what" on the butt] I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
[a naked Butters holds a rose] You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!
[Kyle's room. The boys have been watching the video from there]
CARTMAN
There's more people viewing it!
STAN
This is going great!
KYLE
[walks over to the window] Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon! [Ike is on his back]
[Canada, night. The Canadians are beat. Some walk around listlessly, others have facial hair, all have bags under their eyes]
TOM
And in other world news, the leader of Japan today is calling for an increase in military spending.
AIDE 1
How come they never mention anything about us?! When are they gonna get to the strike?!
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Don't worry, the strike is big news. I'm sure it will be one of the top stories.
TOM
In other news tonight, it the Internet video that has already seen over ten million views. A young confused-looking boy dancing and singing a song called "What What (In My Asshole)".
REPORTER
[in front of Butters' house] Tom, in just one week the video has become the most watched thing in all of America. [Butters appears at his bedroom window and waves at the camera] The boy in the video, referred to by most as "that little gay kid", [Butters stops and leaves the window] has already been asked to appear on Jimmy Kimmel and The Today Show.
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Aw damn it that's not news! What about us?!
PHILLIP
Look, ah, Stephen, Terrance and I were talking andeh, well it's, it's starting to look like maybe we're not gonna win this thing, you know?
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
We'll win! We'll just have to stay resilient!
PHILLIP
Wull, yeah, but everyone is dying of starvation.
TERRANCE
Yeah, let's give it up, guy.
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Don't call me your guy! I'm not your guy, friend!
TERRANCE
Well I'm not your friend, buddih!
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Well I'm not your buddih, guy!
WOMAN 2
Wait! Here it is! Turn it up! We're on!
TOM
And finally tonight, a new development in the Canada strike. For those of you who don't remember or don't care, Canada has been striking for more money. [the Canadians cheer]
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
All right! Shh! I told you, I told you, listen, listensh, listen listen listen.
TOM
In a shocking turn of events, it now appears that thousands of people from Denmark are flooding into the United States with hopes of taking the place of the striking Canadians.
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
What?
[An airport. A plane from Denmark is parked on the tarmac and Danish people pour out of it. The Danish have both Canadian and normal features - Canadian bodies and jaws and normal eyes]
FEMALE REPORTER
Do you really think you Danish can replace the Canadians?
DANISH MAN
Well, where we come from it's pretty cold too, ja. We like hockey and nobody really pays any attention to us.
DANISH WOMAN
Nobody knows where Denmark is.
DANISH MAN
Right. So when you think about it, we're the Canadians of Europe.
[Back in Canada]
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
SCABS! How could you?! [runs up to the TV annd destroys it with one kick]
[A lobby, somewhere. DIM, it says. Department of Internet Money. Stan and the boys walk up to the help desk. They look around before Stan steps forward]
STAN
Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money.
CLERK
Take a number and wait with everyone else.
CARTMAN
Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob.
CLERK
[not taking time out from her work] Take a number and wait with everyone else! [Stan takes a numbered slip from the dispenser and leads the other boys to some seats in a waiting room nearby]
TAY ZONDAY
[slowly, a little creepily] Chocolate Raaain.
BUTTERS
Aaah. [another man walks up to the boys]
TRON GUY
Hey, I know you. You're the "What What (In My Asshole)" kid.
BUTTERS
[insulted, crosses his arms] "What What (In The Butt)," sir.
STAN
It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.
TRON GUY
Yeah, sure. All the biggest Internet stars are here. You remember, of course, Numa Numa. [to his right is the Numa Numa guy. He begins dancing to a song]
NUMA NUMA GUY
Ma-iyahi Ma-iyahu Ma-iyaho, Ma-iyaha ha.
TRON GUY
And the Star Wars kid. [the kid starts to dance around as in his video] And the Internet sensation Cute Sneezing Panda. [as in its video, the mother panda sneezes as soon as her child moves] And there's Dramatic Look Gopher. [the camera pans by a lonely girl and focuses on the gopher, who seems to notice the camera is on him. He quickly turns to face the camera and freezes]
CARTMAN
Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet!
TAY ZONDAY
[to Butters] So, how many people have seen your Internet video?
BUTTERS
Uhhh a few hundred thousand?
TAY ZONDAY
Huh, mere peanuts. Chocolate Rain has done gangbusters. Theoretically, I'm a millionaire.
CARTMAN
Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year.
CHRIS CROCKER
[jumps in out of nowhere] Leave Chocolate Rain Guy alone! Leave him alohohone! I'm serious! [a phone rings and Kyle digs into his pocket]
KYLE
[finds the phone...] Excuse me. [...leaves his seat and exits the waiting room. Then he takes the call] Hello?
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
[sitting on a cardboard box] You greedy corporate fat cat. You said you would get us moneh.
KYLE
Wait we're working on it.
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
[stands and moves forward] You're stalling! Because you think I'll give up. You know that most Canadians are talkin' about giving up the strike already. [coughs away from the phone] You've got me over a barrel and you know it!
KYLE
Sir, we're doing everything we can.
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
You want me to say it again?! You've got me over a barrel! There, you happy?! You've got me bent over a barrel with my tender ass just waiting to be pulverized by your thrusting manhood! [Kyle stays quiet] Do you realize how stupid I'm going to look if I call off the strike after starting all this?! I won't do it! You hear me, guy?! You're wrong! No matter what happens I will never call of this strike! Even if it means we all. Die.
KYLE
We don't want you to die.
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Then you'd better hurry. We don't have much longer. The blood will be on your hands. [slowly hangs up]
[Back at the waiting room... Kyle returns]
KYLE
We have to speed this up! [to Chocolate Rain Guy] Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?
TAY ZONDAY
I don't think so. Nothing takes priority over Chocolate Rain.
STAR WARS KID
Oh, here he goes with the ego again. Who crowned you the top Internet star?!
TAY ZONDAY
I did. When I became bigger than all you bitches.
TRON GUY
Oh please, Laughing Baby had four times as many views as you! [the baby begins to laugh and laugh...]
TAY ZONDAY
You'd better shut your fuckin' mouth, Laughin' Baby!
AFRO NINJA
Did you all forget about Afro Ninja? My Internet thing was bigger than anybody's. I made over a hundred million theoretical dollars.
STAR WARS KID
Well Sneezing Panda is theoretically worth billions!
TAY ZONDAY
You all wanna motherfuckin' die?! [whips out a Glock and cocks it]
CHRIS CROCKER
NOOO! [grabs the gun and tries to wrestle it from Chocolate Rain Guy]
[A battle royal begins. Tron Guy whips out a frisbee and chucks it at Numa Numa. It hits Numa Numa's left cheek]
NUMA NUMA GUY
Haw!
[Afro Ninja fights the Star Wars Kid, Numa Numa fights Tron Guy, Chris Crocker fights Chocolate Rain Guy. Afro Ninja knocks Star Wars Guy away with his nunchucks, then tries a back flip and falls on his face. He gets up groggily and stumbles away. The baby laughs some more]
KYLE
Okay, forget it. We'll wait our turn.
TRON GUY
Hai Hayaaa!
NUMA NUMA GUY
Ma-iyahi Ma-iyahu Ma-iyah-
[kicks Tron Guy in the balls, then lands a left hook on his face]
CHRIS CROCKER
[jumps in to separate the two men] Leave Tron Guy alone! Leave him alone! [the baby continues laughing. Chocolate Rain Guy grabs Chris Crocker by the hair and drags him around. Chris is screaming]
TAY ZONDAY
Get ready for some chocolate pain, bitch! [aims his right at Chris' head. Chris quickly bites Chocolate Rain Guy's right leg, making him drop the gun. The mother panda mauls Numa Numa, Tron Guy throws his frisbee again, and Chris Crocker jumps in again]
CHRIS CROCKER
Leave the panda alone! Leave her alone, I'm serious! [the mother panda stands on her hind legs and just swats Chris out of view, killing him. Chocolate Rain Guy reaches for his fallen gun, turns around, and kills Star Wars Kid with two shots. The mother panda mauls Tron Guy to death, and Chocolate Rain Guy kills the panda with four shots. He then aims at the gopher]
TAY ZONDAY
Thought I forgot about you, Gopher?! [the gopher, who's facing away from him, suddenly turns its head to him, looking at him intently] Ughhh, my brains. [his head swells up and explodes. His body staggers for a few seconds, then falls to the side. One last bullet leaves his gun and blows the gopher's head off. Anyone who was involved in the battle is gone]
CARTMAN
Sweet. I think we're next in line now.
[Kyle's house, day. Ike is still on the front lawn, still on his back. He blinks]
[Canada, day. Everyone there is now tired out. Some have died, as they have X's where their eyes should be. The camera moves forward to the G (for Government) building, then flies up the side until it reaches Mr. Abootman's office. Mr. Abootman looks out the window at the crowd beneath him]
AIDE 1
[opens the office door] Stephen!, Stephen! They're here! They've come to negotiate!
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
[turns around] What?! You mean it?! [Kyle and friends walk in]
KYLE
Okay, we did it.
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Who the hell are you?
STAN
We're the ones you told to get Internet money.
KYLE
Here. [hands Mr. Abootman the money] We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you. [Mr. Abootman takes the check and looks at it]
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Theoretical dollars? What am I supposed to do with that?! [turns away] You little timewasters!
STAN
Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!
KYLE
Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now.
CARTMAN
...You are a homo, Butters.
KYLE
Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Nooooo! I'm not gonna look like an idiot! If I fucked up and led everyone astray, the last thing I'm going to do and admit it! [the phone rings and he turns to answer it] Yes, this is the head of the WGA. The World Canadian Bureau.
[The UN, day. A conference call - the leaders talk to Mr. Abootman over a speakerphone]
SWISS DELEGATE
Ah, Mr. Abootman. It's the global world summit leaders. We want to talk to you about the strike.
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
You... You do? You wanna negotiate?!
FRENCH DELEGATE
No, actually we were just wondering if, when you're all dead, we can use Newfoundland for a new global theme park. [Mr. Abootman drops the phone and begins to weep. He walks away with his hands over his eyes]
KYLE
[picks up the phone] Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!
SWISS DELEGATE
Excuse me?
KYLE
[Mr. Abootman leans on the door, crying] He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!
FRENCH DELEGATE
Well, we could give Canada some small consolation prize
KYLE
If they give you something small, will you end the strike?
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Will they... act like they're giving Canada a lot so everyone thinks I did a good job?
KYLE
Can you act like you're giving him a lot?
SWISS DELEGATE
Sure, why not?
[Canada, moments later. Mr. Abootman steps outside to the podium and makes an announcement]
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
We have won! [no one reacts: they're all too tired to]
LUMBERJACK
Well how much did we get?
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Well, we uh, we didn't get everything that we wanted, but... we negotiated hard and... we got these... [holds up some coupons] coupons to Bennigan's! And... [holds up a bag of sweets] free bubblegum... for every Canadian. [his aide steps forward and claps really fast. Other Canadians begin to clap their hands] These coupons entitle every Canadian to a free meal at Bennigan's. With the purchase of a meal at equal or greater value, of course.
AIDE 1
We did it! [aide 2 steps forward and claps really fast. Other Canadians begin to clap their hands]
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
My friends. This is the greatest victory in Canadian history. [headlines follow: The Canuck Reporter has "Canada Wins The Strike". Canadiety has "Strike over! Canada Victorious!". Canada Today has "Strike Victory Party Set For Next Week".]
[South Park, Kyle's house, front lawn, day. Ike is still half-buried in the snow. A taxi pulls up to the curb and lets the boys out]
KYLE
Ike. Ike! [Ike wakes up] It's over.
IKE
[stands up] It's over?
KYLE
Yeah. Here you go. [hands him a Bennigan's coupon and a gumdrop. Kyle and the others head indoors]
STAN
Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with.
BUTTERS
Me too!
KYLE
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.
STAN
...Yeah.
[Canada, the Victory Party. Kool & The Gang's "Celebration". Everyone is just standing around. The camera pans from left to right. Mr. Abootman and his aides appear. They're all dancing]
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Yeah, we did it! Celebrate, everyone! Woohoo! [the reason for everyone standing around is shown: a memorial wall on one side of the room has pictures of everyone who died during the strike. Mourners walk up with bouquets and drop them off at the table in front of the wall.]
TERRANCE
Hold on a minute! Wait just a second! [the music stops as Terrance holds out a calculator] We just did some calculating! By NOT working during the strike, Canadians lost more than 10.4 million dollars!
PHILLIP
And our Bennigan's coupons and bubble gum is worth roughly... three thousand and eight dollars!
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Don't look at that. Come on, friends, let's dance.
PHILLIP
You had no idea what you were doing and now you're trying to make it look like you won so that we won't set you adrift!
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Damn it friends, don't you see? We won for future Canadians, guy. So the little guy doesn't get pushed around anymore. This was a victory for Canada's respect. [Terrance and Phillip don't believe what they're hearing]
[The shore of a lake. A man picks away at a block of ice. Two other men come and push it away. On it are Stephen Abootman and his aides]
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
Eh?! What do you think you're doing?!
TERRANCE
We're setting you adrift, idiot!
PHILLIP
Maybe you can go live with the Danish!
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
You'll regret this day, friend!
PHILLIP
I'm not your friend, buddih!
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
I'm not your buddih, guy!
TERRANCE
He's not your guy, friend!
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
[loud and drawn out] I'm not your friend, buddih!
TERRANCE & PHILLIP
We're not your buddih, guy!
STEPHEN ABOOTMAN
[now far away] I'm not your guy, friend!
End of Canada on Strike


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:While Ms. Garrison is off trying to find a way to become the man he was always intended to be, Cartman is put in charge of the classroom.

script:Eek, A Penis!

[Mrs. Garrison's classroom. She's seated behind the desk, crying and pulling out tissue after tissue, baring her soul to the class.]
MRS. GARRISON
It's like, my whole life has just been one big screw-up, you know? [wipes away tears, then throws the tissue away] I admit it, I was I was sexually lost. I was, and then I see this person on Oprah. She was a woman but then she got a sex change, became a man, but... then she got pregnant and is having a baby, which means she's still a woman all along. That means I'm really still a man, I'm... I still feel like a man
BUTTERS
Are we gonna get tested on this?
MRS. GARRISON
This sex change was a big mistake, okay? [blows her nose] I was on a lot of painkillers at the time and I thought it was what I wanted.
STAN
[to Kyle] Dude, wanna do some math problems?
MRS. GARRISON
[tosses another tissue away, grabs another one] And then, I go to the doctor, right? And I say "Doctor, I wanna go back to being a man," and he says "There's been too much damage. You can't go back. Where are you going to find a penis?" [gets up, and his chair topples over] Whattaya mean, where am I gonna find a penis?! [throws a bust] I'm a man! I deserve a God damned penis! [throws some tissues, some books, and an apple towards the class. Stan closes his eyes shut so nothing gets in them. Mrs. Garrison grabs her chair and crashes it through a window. Then he punches the wall, knocks the metal drawers over, and kicks the desk, grunting all the while]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[not seen] Mr. Gar- Mr. Garrison! [he stops and looks up. He sees Mr. Mackey and Principal Victoria, her arms crossed, at the door] Could we speak with you please?
MRS. GARRISON
[walks out of the classroom still sniffling] What do you want? I'm trying to teach.
MR. MACKEY
Uh, we think it's best you not teach until you get your personal life in order, m'kay? [Principal Victoria walks into the classroom and closes the door]
MRS. GARRISON
Ohhh it's so easy for you, Mackey! You have a penis! [walks away in a huff]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Ooookay students, um, obviously we've had a little emergency with your teacher, so uh, while we deal with this, we need one of you to lead the class and review for tomorrow's quiz.
CARTMAN
[raises his hand] Oh! Me me, me. Me! Me me! Me! Right here! Right here right here.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Uhh, who, who else would like to be teacher for the day? Anybody else? [no one else volunteers. Cartman stands on his chair and raises his left arm high]
CARTMAN
Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Any other volunteers, perhaps?
CARTMAN
[now on his desk and stretching that left arm up higher] Rrrrrrr! Principal Victoria. Principal.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
All right, all right, fine. Eric, you lead the class.
CARTMAN
Yes! [walks up next to Garrison's desk]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Now, just lead a review over whatever Mr. Garrison's been teaching you, and I'll be back to check on you shortly. [leaves the classroom and closes the door.]
CARTMAN
[turns to the board and walks up to it. He grabs the wooden pointer and smacks it softly against his left palm] Well well well. Who's teacher now? [whips it against the floor] Yeahhh. Who's teacher?!
KYLE
You're not the teacher, fatass.
CARTMAN
That's Mr. Cartman now, Kyle! And you will be wise not to interrupt my class unless you want to be suspended! [whips the pointer against the floor] Yeahhh. [whips the pointer against the floor again] Mmm yeah, you like that? [Kyle just rolls his eyes] All right, Clyde, you're first! Get up here! [whips the pointer against the floor again] Yeah, you're gonna take it, Clyde. [waves the pointer around a little and follows it with his eyes.]
[Mrs. Garrison's house, day. She's laying on her sofa with her tissues, crying.]
NEWS ANCHOR
And so it appears that the local farmer's market could be soon facing complete closure. In other news tonight, a South Park bio company is coming under fire for genetically engineering body parts onto laboratory mice. This picture of a mouse [a picture of a mouse with a human ear growing on its back] genetically altered to grow a human ear has already sparked waves of protest.
MRS. GARRISON
[now attentive] What?
NEWS ANCHOR
But the scientists say the process could help thousands of people who've become disfigured and need ears or noses.
MRS. GARRISON
Holy Freaking Jesus.
[Research Group Laboratories, day. "Tomorrow's Fortune is Today".]
[Research Group Laboratories, inside. Researchers move around. One of them is talking to Mrs. Garrison]
RESEARCHER 1
Using common genetics and cartilage scaffolding, we can graft almost any body part onto a mouse and allow it to develop. Here's the mouse you saw on television. [Mrs. Garrison looks at the mouse] Once the ear fully forms, it can be transplanted onto a person.
MRS. GARRISON
Doctor, what about a penis?
RESEARCHER 1
Well, a penis is something a man puts into a woman's vagina.
MRS. GARRISON
No, no. If I gave you some of my DNA, could you grow a penis on a mouse for me?
RESEARCHER 1
You don't understand: doing this stuff is very expensive. And we've never tried a penis before; there's no guarantee it would work.
MRS. GARRISON
I will give you all the money I have to just try. Please. Doctor, I'm a man trapped in a woman's body. I need a penis.
RESEARCHER 1
All right. [Mrs. Garrison grins] All right, let's see what we can do.
[South Park Elementary, day, Principal Victoria's office. Mr. Mackey is there, as well as two school officials]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Eric, we've called you in to commend you for your role as student teacher.
CARTMAN
Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!
MR. MACKEY
Uh, "commend" means you've done a great job, Eric. Hm'kay?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[looks through some papers] After leading your class through review, your schoolmates scored higher than they ever had on their tests. Whatever you did really worked on them.
CARTMAN
[at ease] Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
These gentlemen from the Denver County School Board have something they want to ask you.
BOARD REP 1
[a black man] Young man, word of your success as a student teacher has started the whole board thinking. We would like you to try your methods on one of our inner-city school classes.
BOARD REP 2
[a white man] These kids just won't listen to any adult teachers and, since you handled your class so well, how would you like to give it a shot?
CARTMAN
That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me?
[The neighborhood bus stop. The bus pulls up and opens its doors. The boys walk out and turn right]
CARTMAN
Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks.
KYLE
You're not an awesome teacher!
CARTMAN
Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test.
KYLE
The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!
CARTMAN
Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk?
KYLE
Kenny's!
KENNY
(Yeah, that was my idea.)
CARTMAN
Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around.
KYLE
Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you! [walks away. Stan and Kenny follow. Cartman is scared, then he starts thinking]
CARTMAN
Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.
[Cartman's bathroom. He's standing on a stool checking himself out on the vanity's mirror. He whips out a partable hair trimmer and raises it to his hairline. He shaves his head down the middle...]
[Jon Davis High School, day. Urban music plays as the establishing scenes go by. There are security scanners at the front door which all students pass through, and two security guards to go through their belongings if the students set off the scanners. The kids at this school are doing anything but studying: fighting, making out, smoking, throwing paper wads at each other...]
[A classroom. The students there are quite rowdy]
PRINCIPAL
[enters] Students, quiet! Quiet please! [a wad of paper goes her way and hits] Give me your attention!
TEEN BOY 1
I'll give you my attention. All night long, Mrs. Miller. [the class laughs]
MRS. MILLER
[the principal] You're on thin ice, Rodriguez! Now listen up! The Denver County School Board has sent over a special guest teacher.
CLASS
Ohhhhhhhhhhh.
MRS. MILLER
This may be your last shot at graduating from high school at all! I want you to welcome... Eric Cartmanez
CARTMAN
[dressed as Jaime Escalante] Hello students. I'm Eric Cartmanez. [holds up his left thumb] Your new teacher.
TEEN BOY 2
What the hell is thiiis?
CARTMAN
I am here... to teach you calculuuus.
[Research Group Laboratories, day. "Tomorrow's Fortune is Today".]
[Research Group Laboratories, inside. Researchers move around. One of them is talking to Mrs. Garrison]
RESEARCHER 1
Iii think you're going to be very pleased with the progress, Ms. Garrison.
MRS. GARRISON
Mr. Garrison! [they approach an incubator]
RESEARCHER 1
Sorry, Mister Garrison. Your DNA has replicated and grafted very successfully with the mouse. And so... here's your penis. [Mr. Garrison gazes into the incubator. A mouse is wrapped in gauze all over, and a penis is riding on its back]
MRS. GARRISON
Wow! My penis looks great!
RESEARCHER 1
Yes. It's a fantastic penis. Congratulations.
MRS. GARRISON
How long before it's ready?
RESEARCHER 1
Welll, it still has some forming to do, but fairly soon.
MRS. GARRISON
Let me see if it feels right in my hand. [opens the incubator door and reaches in...]
RESEARCHER 1
No! Don't open the- [the mouse escapes]
MRS. GARRISON
Whoa no!
RESEARCHER 2
Don't let it get out of the lab! [the mouse reaches the entrance and escapes when an unsuspecting researcher opens the door from outside]
MRS. GARRISON
Mah penis! [gives chase, and some researchers join him] Stop, penis! Come back here!
[The classroom at Jim Davis High. Cartman hands out syllabi]
CARTMAN
Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu.
TEEN BOY 3
Hey man, what the hell do you think you're doing?!
TEEN BOY 4
Yeahhhh.
CARTMAN
Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge
TEEN BOY 5
Getting into college? Maaan, we ain't gettin' in no college! Fuck you! [the rest of the class voice their protests as well. Cartman turns his back to them and looks down]
CARTMAN
How do I reach these keeds? [faces the class, his left hand tucked under the left pant pocket] The reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught... how to cheat properly! How do you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I mean because they cheat all the time. [holds up a picture] This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top.
MARIJA
Hey, I don't wanna be called a cheater!
CARTMAN
No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy.
TEEN BOY 6
This is bullshit. I don't wanna waste my time learning to cheat.
CARTMAN
Go ahead, the door's right there. [turns left] Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss youuu. [the boy walks to the door and leaves. Cartman turns away from the class and sighs, dropping the photo] How do I reach these keeds?
[The community park. The boys are playing in the sand box, making a sand castle. They've brought their toy trucks along. Both Butters and Kenny are present. Mr. Garrison sees them and runs towards them.]
MRS. GARRISON
Boys! Boys, have you seen my penis? [the boys can't figure out what he's talking about.]
KYLE
What?
MRS. GARRISON
My penis is on the loose! If you see it, just try to catch it with some cheese. [runs off]
BUTTERS
[rubbing his temples] Ow. That hurt my brains. [the pain gets worse] Oww.
[Jim Davis High, another smoggy day. The boy who walked out of class is playing basketball alone in the school yard. He shoots and misses, and goes for the ball, but it rolls towards Cartman, who picks it up.]
CARTMAN
Nice form, compadre. [walks towards the basket with the ball]
TEEN BOY 6
Hey, I walked out of your class, teacher. Look, I don't wanna argue with you about the merits of cheating.
CARTMAN
Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game? [whistles] Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us? [a scoreboard is shown, and a boy on the platform looks over at him]
TEEN BOY 7
Sure thing, Mr. C.
CARTMAN
[gets into position] Okay, you start on defense, amigo. [dribbles the ball for a few seconds, then whacks the boy on the right shin with a collapsible pointer]
TEEN BOY 6
[falls down and grabs his right leg] AAAAH! [Cartman continues towards the basket and scores. The score is now 1-0 Visitors]
CARTMAN
Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo!
TEEN BOY 6
You cheated!
CARTMAN
What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn. [the boy is on offense. He dribbles for a few seconds and moves to the basket, but Cartman again takes out his pointer and whacks the boy's left shin. The boy falls again, and Cartman steals the ball and scores again. The boy at the scoreboard updates the score: 2-0 Visitors] That's two to nothing, amigoo. [his opponent stands up]
TEEN BOY 6
Fuck you, man, you can't do that!
CARTMAN
Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing. [throws the ball back at the boy]
TEEN BOY 6
I know what you're trying to say, but I still don't agree with it. [throws the ball away and limps off]
CARTMAN
Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing! [sighs] How do I reach these keeds?
[Butters' house, day. Linda is washing dishes when she hears something squeak.]
LINDA
What is that? [turns around and looks. The modified mouse runs across the kitchen floor; she screams and hops onto a footstool, then lifts up her skirt] Eeeek! Eeeek! [the mouse runs across the floor again, in the opposite direction] Eeeek! Eeeek! [hops off and runs to the living room entrance] Stephen! Stephen come quick!
STEPHEN
[reading the paper with a pipe in his hand] What is it, dear?
LINDA
A penis is loose in our kitchen!
STEPHEN
A penis?
LINDA
Yes! It just ran across the floor!
STEPHEN
Now darling, calm down.
LINDA
Calm down nothing! I don't want that penis running through my house!
STEPHEN
Hoh, women. Always afraid of penises. [Butters smiles. Stephen gets up from his armchair and walks to the kitchen. Butters joins him. The mouse runs across the floor again]
LINDA
There! There, you see it?
STEPHEN
Oh, it's just a little penis, darling.
LINDA
I don't care. It's probably got all kinds of diseases. [the mouse runs across the floor again]
BUTTERS
Hey wait! I think that's teacher's penis!
STEPHEN
Your teacher's penis?
BUTTERS
Yeah, that must be his.
STEPHEN
Butters, how do you know what your teacher's penis looks like?
BUTTERS
[didn't quite get it until...] Huh?
[Jim Davis High School, day]
CARTMAN
Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time. [hops onto a box so he could write on the chalkboard. He draws a video camera aimed at a box marked D] When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can- [the errant student returns]
TEEN BOY 6
I thought that... well maybe I can give cheating a try.
CARTMAN
Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack. [the student takes his seat] All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: "I mis-interpreted the rules." It's what you must also say when caught cheating! "I mis-interpreted the rules." Say it with me.
CLASS
"I mis-interpreted the rules."
CARTMAN
Good. Again.
CLASS
"I mis-interpreted the rules."
CARTMAN
Again!
CLASS
"I mis-interpreted the rules."
CARTMAN
Now you sound like white people!
CLASS
[now with pounding fists] "I mis-interpreted the rules!"
[South Park Supermarket. Stephen and Butters have finished shopping and are packing the groceries into their car. Mr. Garrison is talking to them]
MRS. GARRISON
What the hell do you mean you just put my penis outside?! Why didn't you call me?!
STEPHEN
Look Garrison, my wife didn't want a penis in the house. I had to get it out.
MRS. GARRISON
Well now how am I supposed to find it?! It could be anywhere!
A WOMAN
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK! [the three guys look up]
MRS. GARRISON
Holy Crap! [takes off after the sound.]
[The Komfort Inn. The screaming woman stands on a box while her husband looks at her annoyed]
WOMAN
Eeeek! Eeeeeek!
HUSBAND
Carole, get down from there!
WOMAN
Noo! Didn't you see that penis just now?! Eeeek!
HUSBAND
I'm sure that penis is way more scared of you than you are of it.
MRS. GARRISON
[pops into view] You saw a penis?!
WOMAN 2
[inside the Inn] Eeeeeeeek! [Mrs. Garrison rushes in]
[The Komfort Inn Fitness Room. Mrs. Garrison finds the woman standing on a chair with her legs crossed]
WOMAN 2
Oh, it's so big and disguuusting. Eeek. [the mouse runs across the floor and Mrs. Garrison gives chase. The penis-mouse runs down the hall and into a steam room]
MRS. GARRISON
[runs down the hall] Come back here, penis! [enters the steam room and looks around] There you are! Got you! [backs out of the steam room holding a penis... which is attached to a man. Garrison looks at the penis more closely, then at the man's face] Hey, you're not my penis. [the man punches her across the face] Ogh! [the penis-mouse runs out. Garrison lets go and gives chase again] There it goes! Stop you!
[Cartmanez' class. He's giving the class the answers for the upcoming test]
CARTMAN
The answer to #27 is 5.
CLASS
[repeating] The answer to #27 is 5.
CARTMAN
The answer to #28 is 14.
CLASS
"The answer to #28 is 14."
TEEN GIRL 2
Man, what's the point? [grabs her books and heads for the door] What's the point of any of this? [cries and exits]
CARTMAN
All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back. [leaves the classroom and looks around for the girl] Melita! Melita, hold on. [walks up to her] You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you?
MELITA
There isn't any point to all this. I won't be going to college. I'm pregnant, all right? I just found out, and Eduardo isn't going to help me raise it.
CARTMAN
[sighs] How do I reach these keeds? [turns around and faces her] All right, let's go get you an abortion.
MELITA
No. I'm Catholic. I think abortion is wrong.
CARTMAN
Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?
MELITA
That cheating is good?
CARTMAN
Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself. [Melita turns right and walks off a bit] Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life.
MELITA
I don't know, Mr. C.
CARTMAN
Mexicans are told not to cheat. "Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child." So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns. [walks around to face her] It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest.
[Park County Police Station, day. Mr. Garrison files a police report]
SGT. YATES
[taking notes] And the last time you saw your penis was two days ago? [a police sketch artist works on a portrait]
MRS. GARRISON
That's right.
OFFICER HARRIS
Long whiskers or short?
MRS. GARRISON
Short, and little fluffy ears.
OFFICER HARRIS
Fluffy ears, okay.
MRS. GARRISON
Think you got it, Mitch?
MITCH HARRIS
I think so, sir. Is this pretty close? [shows his sketch to Garrison: it's Mickey Mouse with a giant boner under his shorts]
MRS. GARRISON
[disappointed] No, no, not like that! That's just silly. [an officer walks into view]
OFFICER
Sir, we might wanna get a unit down to the Italian restaurant on Kentner.
SGT. YATES
What is it?
OFFICER
Call just came through. Seems a penis broke in and tried to eat their cheese.
MRS. GARRISON
Wall come on! [runs out. The two other officers follow him]
[Buca de Faggoncini Italian Restaurant, night. Diners are eating their meals, and a small penis-mouse appears on the floor]
WOMAN 2
[quickly jumps onto her chair and lifts up her skirt] EEK!
MAN 2
[looks around] What's the matter?
WOMAN 2
A penis!
WOMAN 3
[quickly jumps onto her table and lifts up her skirt] A penis? Where?
WOMAN 4
There it is! [quickly jumps onto the table at her booth and lifts up her skirt] Eek! [the other women at the restaurant do the same thing, and soon all you hear are "Eek, a penis!"]
MRS. GARRISON
[enters the restaurant followed by the three officers] Where is it?!
MITCH HARRIS
Look, there! [points to the mouse as it heads to the kitchen. A waiter doesn't notice the mouse passing by him]
MRS. GARRISON
Come on! [he and the officers run to the kitchen]
CHEF
What'sa that peenis doing ina myii kitchen? [wields a rolling pin]
MRS. GARRISON
[entering with the cops] Huy! Don't you dare kill my penis! [the mouse leaves through an open window] Crap! We've gotta go back around!
[Outside. The penis-mouse climbs along items behind the restaurant and runs along the top of a wooden fence. The camera follows it past the moon in the distance. The mouse stops and looks at the moon]
MOUSE
Someone somewhere is loving me tonight
Looking at the same moon and seeing it so bright.
PENIS
Someone somewhere is feelin' my despair
MOUSE
Feelin' my despair
PENIS
And this same moon is
PENIS, MOUSE
[together] making them think of that-.
MRS. GARRISON
There it is! [the mouse runs away. Garrison gives chase again, with the cops and the chef joining him. The mouse runs to the sewer and drops in] No! Nooo! [dives after it, but can't reach far enough in to get it] No! No!
MITCH HARRIS
There's not a chance now.
MRS. GARRISON
No we, we can find it! [looks intensely down through the grate]
SGT. YATES
Sorry Garrison, your penis is gone. Afraid there's nothing more we can do. You'll just have to live with being a woman. A very ugly one. Come on, men. [they leave. Garrison stands up, beat]
[Cartmanez's classroom. Mrs. Miller and Cartman stand before the class.]
MRS. MILLER
Students, I want to congratulate you on your amazing test scores. The school board is so impressed with your progress that they are going to let you take the standardized advanced placement test for college credit. [a quick cheer goes up] The test is going to be heavily monitored in a private room at their location to assure that there can be absolutely no cheating.
CARTMAN
Uh what?
MRS. MILLER
The test will be tomorrow. Make us proud. [turns right and leaves the classroom]
TEEN BOY 8
Monitor us in a private room?
TEEN BOY 3
Now they're gonna know we've been cheating all along.
TEEN BOY 2
I knew it man! You made us believe in your way and now it's all for nawthing!
CARTMAN
Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them.
TEEN BOY 8
[stands up] Shut up, man! You reyally screwed us all!
CARTMAN
How do I reeeach these keeeeds?! [the boy, cowed, slips back into his seat. Cartman faces the board] Just before the last Super Bowl, Bill Beelichick gathered his football players and said, "Let's win this one for real. Just this one time. Let's not cheat." You know what happened? [dryly] They lost. [faces the class] Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives.
MARIJA
Yeah, come on, we can do this, guys.
CARTMAN
You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.
[A bus stop across the street from Buca de Faggoncini, night. Mrs. Garrison is on her back on the bench, crying]
MRS. GARRISON
You did this to yourself, Garrison. Get your hopes up with a stupid genetic experiment and now all your money's gone along with your penis. [a squeaky thing is heard. Garrison notices and stops crying] Well what the? [raises her head and looks down, then looks towards her feet. The mouse that has been fleeing all night is now struggling to get on the bench] Why... it's my penis. [the mouse is now wholly on the bench] My penis came back. But why? [the mouse moves closer. Mrs. Garrison lowers her left hand to the bench. The mouse walks onto her hand, and she lifts it up] I guess it's true. What's that old saying? "If you love your penis, let it go..."
[Jim Davis High School Auditorium. Mrs. Miller addresses the audience while Mr. Cartmanez' class stands behind and to the left of her]
MRS. MILLER
The standardized advanced placement test is considered one of the most difficult and carefully monitored tests in the country. Twenty-four of our students took the test and all twenty-four scored 100% [their parents applaud. Melita and a short boy look at each other]
TEEN BOY 6
Uh, can we say something?
MRS. MILLER
Sure. [leaves the podium. The short boy reaches for a plaque and hands it to the taller boy, who now takes the mic]
TEEN BOY 6
We would like to present this plaque to the person who taught us the White People Method. Mr. Cartmanez! [Cartman, standing far from the podium and off to one side, walks up to the podium and reaches the mic. The students gather 'round him and clap as adults take pictures.]
CARTMAN
[basking in the success] I reeached these keeeds.
[South Park Elementary, main entrance. Everyone is gathered there for a special occasion]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Students and faculty, please put your hands together and help me in welcoming back, Mister Garrison. [everyone claps as Mr. Garrison makes his return]
MR. GARRISON
Thanks everyone. It's great to be back. I'm a man again. Thanks to my very special new friend. [the mouse that grew his penis climbs onto his right shoulder, the penis having been removed from it and attached to Mr. Garrison. Garrison turns around] But you know, I've learned that I've really been a dude all along. Because the key difference between men and women is that women can have babies. If you can't have babies, then, you're a man.
A TEACHER
Whoa uh wait, uh, hang on a second. My wife had ovarian cancer, so she can't have babies.
MR. GARRISON
Well then get an AIDS test, Thompson, 'cause your wife's a dude, faggot! [Thompson is dumbfounded. Garrison turns around and jumps up to click his heels] Yeah! I'm back!
End of Eek, A Penis!


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:One day the citizens of South Park wake up and find the internet is gone. When Randy hears there may still be some internet out in California, he packs up his family and heads west.

script:Over Logging

[Stan's house, night. He's at his computer browsing the Internet. His mom pops in...]
SHARON
Get off the internet, Stanley, It's time for bed
STAN
Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things
SHARON
Now, Stanley. The Internet will be waiting for you in the morning. Off!
STAN
[sighs] Aw man! [shuts off his monitor as Sharon leaves, then goes to bed. Sharon heads for Shelly's room]
SHARON
Shelly, off the Internet. It's bedtime.
SHELLY
Mom, I'm i-chatting with my boyfriend in Montana!
SHARON
Now, Shelly! [leaves and closes the door]
SHELLY
Why do you hate me?!
SHARON
[entering Randy's study] Randy, off the Internet.
RANDY
Nooo. Naw come on, leave me alone.
SHARON
No, mister, it's time for night-night.
RANDY
But Sharon, I've got stuff to do. I've gotta see my credit rating, I've gotta send an e-mail to Nelson and check out Foley's vacation photos-
SHARON
You don't have to do all that now! You can do one more thing and then it's bedtime. [leaves and closes the door]
RANDY
[left to his thoughts] One more thing? [thinks a bit and then starts typing quickly] Ooooyeah... [starts masturbatng under the desk]
[Stan's house, next morning. The sky brightens just before dawn.]
[Stan's room, 7:30 a.m. His alarm goes off and he sits up, turns the alarm off, and heads for his computer. He turns on his monitor and tries to visit Steam. His browser tells him he's not connected to the Internet]
STAN
What the hell?
RANDY
[entering, still in his night robe] Stan! Stan, I gotta use your computer! [reaches Stan's desk with urgency and moves Stan away]
STAN
What?
RANDY
My Internet's not working; I gotta use yours. An-and give Daddy some private time, will ya?
STAN
My Internet's not working either.
RANDY
What?! [sees but doesn't believe]
SHELLY
[enters Stan's room with her laptop] Dad, the Internet's not working!
RANDY
[pulling on some cables] I know that, okay?!
SHELLY
I have to get online with my darling Amir before school starts!
SHARON
[enters] Randy, I can't get my e-mail to open.
RANDY
[leaves the computer to be in the middle of his family] Everybody just, just calm down! Calm down, all right?! It's going to be okay! We just CAN'T. PANIC. [he's the only one looking panicked]
[The Broflovski house, moments later. The doorbell rings and Gerald answers in his pajamas. He's got a cup of coffee with him. The Marshes are there in their night clothes]
RANDY
[in despair] Gerald. Please help us.
GERALD
Randy. What happened?
RANDY
Our house... It has no Internet.
SHEILA
[arrives and stands next to him] Oh my God.
RANDY
[enters the living room] We've got nothing! It's just gone.
GERALD
Come in. You can use our Internet until you figure out what to do.
RANDY
[gratefully] Thank you Gerald. [the other Marshes enter]
STAN
[heads for a computer] I'm getting on it first.
RANDY
[giving chase] Oh no you're not!
STAN
[steps into Kyle's room] Kyle, I need to use your Internet
KYLE
Ih it's not working.
RANDY
[steps into Kyle's room] What?!
KYLE
I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.
GERALD
No. [rushes to the computer to see for himself] No, our Internet can't be broken. Ah, I've gotta get an attachment Larry sent me last night.
RANDY
[firmly] It's not working, Gerald.
GERALD
But it has to work! Maybe if I do a little-
RANDY
Your Internet's not working, Gerald! Face it!
KYLE
I have to get online before school.
STAN
What about Starbucks? They have free Internet.
RANDY
Right, Starbucks!
GERALD
Everyone get your stuff; we can take my car.
[Outside. As the two families head for Gerald's SUV, Stephen Stotch walks by. Behind him, a couple stands looking at their laptop]
STEPHEN
Hey, is your- is your guys' Internet working?
RANDY
No! Nobody's is!
MAN 1
[comes out of his house with a laptop] Whaaaaat's haaappeniiiiing?!
RANDY
Jesus. Everyone's gonna go to Starbucks now.
GERALD
Everyone in the car. We have to beat them there. [everyone climbs in.]
[En route. They move down the road while on either side people have no idea what to do without the Internet.]
RANDY
God, the whole neighborhood's affected. [a man sticks a Yoshiba laptop in front of the windshield]
GERALD
Get out of the way, Peterson! [motions him away]
[Starbucks Coffee. A crowd is already gathered there hoping to get inside]
CLERK
Folks, there's, there's no Internet here. It's not working, I tell ya.
KYLE
It's not working here?
RANDY
Kids, get back in the car. We can go to the Mac store.
MAN 2
No, don't. You're wasting your time.
RANDY
How do you know?!
MAN 2
Because we just came from there! There was nothing! Not one scrap of Internet!
GERALD
How can there be no Internet anywhere? What's going on?!
STEPHEN
Anybody got a Blackberry? Check Drudge Report.
RANDY
Good idea! [walks forward a bit and pulls out a Blackberry] No wait, we can't check Drudge Report: there's no Internet!
MR. GARRISON
[with pipe and laptop] There has to be a way to find out what's going on.
GERALD
We can't! Don't you get it?! There's no Internet to find out why there's no Internet!
MAN 3
What did we used to do to get the news before the Internet?
RANDY
[thinks a moment] A television! [everyone else thinks, then moves down the street as if they were one]
[Tele's, moments later. Randy walks up to the plate-glass window with a chair and smashes the chair through it. Jimbo walks into Tele's first and everyone else follows. Jimbo turns on a TV and everyone else gathers to see the news. Onscreen, the small floating window says "This page cannot be displayed." At the bottom of the screen is a crawl that reads "THERE IS NO INTERNET"]
ANCHORMAN
Once again we apologize, but we cannot bring you the news. It appears that we have no Internet here at News 4. We'll be happy to bring you up on current events just as soon as our Internet is back.
RANDY
Jesus, it's statewide.
GERALD
It could be nationwide.
ANCHORMAN
Hello? Do you have Internet? It it's Channel 4 News. No, we don't have Internet either. [everyone leaves Tele's]
GERALD
No Internet... anywhere...
RANDY
Jesus... we're all alone... [POV change to a shot of the town from a distance. Another POV change to a shot of the town from even further away]
[South Park shopping district. The town seems empty. A window shutter opens and closes somewhere. It's Monday. Next scene is a shot of the Marsh house, eight days without Internet. Tumbleweeds begin to roll in. Inside, no one is doing much. Randy's asleep on the couch, Shelly's sadly looking outside, Stan sits on the floor, Grandpa is in his wheelchair. Randy begins to cough]
SHARON
What's the matter?
RANDY
I don't know. I need to get on Web MD and see why I have this cough, but I can't. [coughs]
SHELLY
What if my sweetheart is online looking for me? He could be wondering why I don't get online with him. Maybe he thinks I'm dead. [looks at Stan] If my darling Amir gets another Internet girlfriend, I'm gonna kill him! And you! [starts punching Stan around like a punching bag. Stan screams]
RANDY
[pulls Shelly away from Stan] Hey! Shelly, whoa, stop, stop!
STAN
Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!
RANDY
You're right. We can't just sit here any longer.
[Sometime later. The Marshes have packed and weighed their car down with everything they can load up on it.]
GERALD
Randy, where will you go?
RANDY
We're gonna head west. There's a rumor goin' around there might be some Internet out there. So we're headed out Californee Way.
GERALD
You don't know if there's any Internet in California.
RANDY
Well there certainly ain't none here! Look, maybe it's time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up!
STEPHEN
It could come back.
RANDY
Yeah, and maybe it won't! In the meantime I got a family who needs the Internet right away. We'll head out Californee Way and ... see what we can find. [motions to Sharon] Come on, let's go.
STEPHEN
Look, if you... if you do find the Internet, let us know, will ya?
RANDY
How. You won't have Internet. [starts the car and moves out]
[En route to California. Randy takes the Mother Road, Route 66, all the way there. They enter Arizone and pass a man holding a sign saying "Californee. Need Internet." They stop at a Canyon Motel - which has no Internet]
MOTEL CLERK
[fanning himself] Sorry folks, we're full up.
RANDY
Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet.
MOTEL CLERK
You and everyone else. You'll have to stay out at the transient camp with all the others heading to Californee. [motions the direction of travel] It's about a mile down the road.
[Transient Camp. $50, night. The full moon shines brightly behind the trees. The camp is a tent and a farmhouse. Randy takes up the guitar and starts playing]
RANDY
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad, oh Lordy.,
My Internet done up and went away. [an elderly man weeps]
TRANSIENT MAN 1
Where are you from, old-timer?
OLD-TIMER
Kansas City. Had me a store there. Kind of... computer supply store. When the Internet went, the stores went too.
TRANSIENT MAN 2
Things will be different when we get out to Californee. Soon as we get us some Internet we can all rest easy.
TRANSIENT MAN 3
Why sure, Silicon Valley. They gots a whole mess of Internet up there. 'Say a man can practically roll around in it.
TRANSIENT MAN 4
When I get to that Internet I'm gonna click on just about everything in sight. 'Might even click on a pop-up ad just for the heck of it.
TRANSIENT MAN 1
Well I'm gonna sit down at that Internet and just stahrt e-mailin'. Just keep on e-mailin' till my fingers are sore to the bone.
RANDY
Sure will be nice. [Stan looks really sad]
TRANSIENT MAN 5
You folks all headin' to Silicon Valley?
RANDY
That's right. We need to get online.
TRANSIENT MAN 5
Haha. "Get online" he says.
STAN
[annoyed] What's so funny about that?
TRANSIENT MAN 5
Think about it. How many folk headin' out to Californee? A million? More? And how much Internet you think they got out there? [the other men look at each other] Might be some Internet, sure, but with everyone tryin' to use it at once, it's gonna go real slow-like. I knows it 'cause I seen it. My two children, they tried to load a Web page. Took them over three days. They sat there waitin', and by the time the loadin' bar was only half-full they was dead. [his eyes begin to well up] Starve on the Internet, with a belly stuck out like a big bladder... [weeps]
RANDY
Come on, Stan, let's get some rest. [the group breaks up for the night]
[The campsite. The Marshes have set up camp. Stan heads for a sleeping bag when he notices Shelly crying.]
SHELLY
Amiiir... I miss you so much...
STAN
[walks up to her] Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee. [she just sits up and punches him away like a beach ball, then lies down without a break in crying]
[The Marshes enter Californee]
RANDY
Everyone, wake up! [the others wake up] We're here! Silicon Valley, Californee! [takes an off-ramp]
[An Internet Refugee Camp, run by the Red Cross. A big-city skyline is seen in the distance. The camp is well-guarded, and cars go in one by one. Randy drives up to the entrance, where a Red Cross worker greets him]
WORKER
Name?
RANDY
Do they have Internet here?
WORKER
Name?
RANDY
Marsh.
WORKER
Service provider?
RANDY
NetZero.
WORKER
All right, stay in line. [moves on to the next car] Once you're inside, Red Cross volunteers will direct you to your campsite.
RANDY
So is there Internet here?
WORKER 2
[voice only, from the front] Stay in line and get to your campsite. [Randy drives forward and into the camp]
[The campsite interior. The camera scans the place until Randy's car comes into view. The car stops and the family steps outside. Randy walks up to two men sitting by a tent]
RANDY
Excuse me, we're looking for some Internet.
REFUGEE MAN 1
Yeah, they've got it here. [Randy gives a thumbs up]
STAN
All right!
REFUGEE MAN 2
But there ain't enough to go around. All they got is a little Internet. [curls his thumb and index finger to create a small space between them] Barely a bar a signal. So they have to ration it out, carefully.
REFUGEE MAN 3
Ya... sign up over there and use your time when they call your name. Each family gets 40 seconds o' Internet per day.
RANDY
Forty seconds? That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia!
VOLUNTEER 1
Well it's all we got, so we gotta make do.
REFUGEE MAN 4
Look, honey, we ordered us some books on Amazon.
VOLUNTEER 2
All right, time's up.
REFUGEE MAN 4
No! No wait! I haven't entered the shipping information! [an MP hauls him away] NO! NOO!
VOLUNTEER 2
Next? Brady, John H.
RANDY
Awww, how am I supposed to see Internet porn that way? [Sharon is within earshot]
SHARON
[walks up to him] What did you say?
RANDY
Uh, you go ahead, Sharon. Divide some Internet amongst the children. I- gotta talk to somebody.
[The Broflovski house, day. Another tumbleweed rolls by. The Broflovskis are watching TV. Two anchors are on screen with a fax machine between them]
ANCHORMAN
And that's about all we know. Uhh, there might be some Internet still in California and parts of Florida, though we certainly still don't have any here. [the fax machine starts printing]
ANCHORMAN 2
A fax! A fax is coming through! [points to it with both index fingers with lots of enthusiasm]
ANCHORMAN
Oh yeah, a fax!!
ANCHORMAN 2
Oh a fax!
ANCHORMAN
It's a fax, it's a fax! It's a fax, it's a fax!
ANCHORMAN 2
It's a fax, we got a fax! [the fax copy pops out and both men grab for it. ] Uh-
ANCHORMAN
Oh! it says, "The government has sent their best people to the Internet in order to repair it."
ANCHORMAN 2
[a few seconds later] We've gotta send a reporter out to the Internet!
KYLE
Where... is... the Internet?
[A bright morning in the Southwest desert. Military helicopters appear and descend on a secret landing]
GENERAL
Gentlemen, the President is very angry that his Internet still isn't working.
SCIENTIST 1
We've tried everything, sir, but the Internet has slowed to a trickle and we can't get it working correctly.
GENERAL
Take me down below! I want to see the Internet for myself!
[Down below is a huge cave with research equipment all over the place.]
SCIENTIST 2
Here it is, general. The Internet. [before them is a colossal router]
GENERAL
What's wrong with it?
SCIENTIST 2
See that flashing orange light in the middle? It's supposed to be solid green.
GENERAL
[walks towards it a bit, in awe] My God.
[The refugee camp, later. Another man is looking at the Internet.]
TRANSIENT MAN 6
Hahaha, thedancingkitty.com, heh, wum, I wonder what that is, hum? [the site appears in the browser] "Click on the dancing kitty and you could win a prize!" hoh, ahaha, ha.
VOLUNTEER 2
All right, time's up.
REFUGEE MAN 5
No, wait, I I just clicked on the kitty. I got it. [the MP comes up and hauls him off too] No! It wasn't long enough! NOO!
VOLUNTEER 2
Next? Nelson, Peter T.
RANDY
[approaches a volunteer] Excuse me, I need to uh, have some private Internet time.
VOLUNTEER 3
Look, we're just tryin' to get by here. Everyone's gotta take what they can get.
RANDY
[grabs the volunteer's arm, takes him aside and says in a soft voice] I haven't jacked off in over two weeks.
VOLUNTEER 3
So jack off.
RANDY
[lets go] You don't understand. [the volunteer crosses his arms] I need the Internet to jack off. I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know? Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy!
VOLUNTEER 3
What do you want us to do? Pick up the whole computer and put it inside for ten minutes just for you?!
RANDY
Three minutes would be plenty.
VOLUNTEER 3
Get lost! [walks away]
RANDY
[feeling pain in his genitals] Ohhh.
[Back at the campsite.]
SHARON
[handing out tickets to her children] All right, each of you take a ticket. When they call your name you can use the Internet.
SHELLY
What number are you, turd?
STAN
Eight fifty one.
SHELLY
[switches tickets with him] You're nine twenty three now.
STAN
Hey! Mom!
SHARON
[returns] Shelly, give your brother his ticket back!
SHELLY
Can't you all see I'm in pain?! Nobody understands pure love! Amir and I are closer than anybody in this stupid family! [runs away]
[Randy walks slowly due to his aching balls. He doubles over from time to time]
REFUGEE MAN 5
Psst. Hey! Over here! [Randy looks over, then walks to the man] You... happen to be looking for Internet porn?
RANDY
Yeah, how'd you know?
REFUGEE MAN 5
Lots of us fellas came here for that reason. We all got used to seein' lots of really perverted stuff on the Internet, so now we can't go back to Playboy.
RANDY
I know, right?
REFUGEE MAN 5
Anyway, we got us a simulator. You just call out what you wanna see and then say "click".
RANDY
"Internet Porn Simulator" [the tent is an "Internet Porn Simulator. Whatever you want to see."]
REFUGEE MAN 5
Give it a try. [lifts up one of the entrance flaps for Randy. Randy enters and sees a makeshift computer on a desk. The monitor is a hollow box. Randy sits down. A hand descends into the hollow box holding a sheet of paper that says "Anything you want to see with the click of a button!"]
RANDY
Uh, Japanese girls exchanging bodily fluids? Click. [the hand goes up, some scribbling is heard, and the hand comes down again with a picture of one Japanese stick figure pissing on another's face while the second stick figure lies on her back. This does not arouse him. He rolls away from the desk] Oh this sucks! I can't jack off to this! [no one responds] Damn it. [rolls back to the desk and unzips his pants.] Uhm, let's see. Interracial gangbang. Click. [gets ready to masturbate in anticipation. The picture comes down, and it's three black stick figures with their cocks out surrounding a Japanese stick figure.] Agh. Les-shemales! Let's try shemales. Click. [another picture comes down, this one of a stick-figure woman with a penis. Randy is grinding away down there] Bestiality? Click, click on that. [the next picture is that of a stick-figure man fucking a stick-figure pet in the ass. Randy is close to climax] Ah, ah! Brazilian fart fetish porn?! Click! Click! [the next picture is that of a Brazilian stick-figure woman farting on a stick-figure man.] Dahya. [the climax fails to arrive] No. No, this isn't gonna work. [pounds his fist on the desk and walks out] It's just not the same.
REFUGEE MAN 5
Well, sorry. And that'll be $49 on your credit card.
RANDY
[reaches into his back pocket for his wallet] Well at least that part's like the Internet.
[The Broflovski house, day. The Broflovskis are watching the news]
ANCHORMAN
We, we now have a reporter on the scene. Uhl-let's go live!
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, I'm at the Internet, where government officials are doing their best to get it running again.
GENERAL
[through a megaphone] All right, Internet. What do you want from us? [the collosal router does not reply] If we've angered you somehow, let us know. [lowers the megaphone] Try to communicate with it digitally again. [a scientist plays a few notes on a music keyboard. There's no reply. The scientist is about to play again when the original notes are sent back, with two others. That didn't go anywhere] I've had it with this thing! Fire a warning shot at it! [a sniper fires at it, but the bullet had no effect. It just bounced off the router]
KYLE
Hey, wait a minute. [gets off the couch and walks away to think alone] Is it possible that...
GERALD
[stands up] What is it, Kyle?
KYLE
I think... I know what's wrong.
[The refugee camp, night. A woman is looking at the Internet now]
SHELLY
This is taking too long! When do I get to use the Internet?!
STAN
It's gotta be our turn soon.
VOLUNTEER 2
All right, folks, it's bed time. No more Internet for today.
REFUGEES
AWWW!!! [various protests are heard after this]
WOMAN
A little closer!
VOLUNTEER 2
No, no, we're locking it away until tomorrow. [the MPs unplug the computer and carry it and the desk away] Everyone get to bed!
REFUGEES
Aw man! [everyone walks off mumbling, disappointed]
WOMAN
Wha?![puts her left hand on her head and walks off with her head tilted back]
SHELLY
Gggggyyaaah! [punches Stan away, then walks away in the other direction]
[A storage room at the refugee camp. The volunteers put the computer away and Volunteer 2 locks the room shut. Randy sees an opportunity and mulls it over. Moments later he's at the room's window looking in. He tries sliding the window open and succeeds. He pulls himself into the room through the window, looks around, forgets to close the window, and walks over to the computer. He starts it up.]
RANDY
Uhuh... Finally! I'm online again! Yeeheeyes! [softly as he types] Japanese girls puking each other's mouths. [click. He finds a page right away. The girls are only heard, not shown]
GIRL 1
Haro Kiti kawaii n desho? ["Hello Kitty is cute, isn't it?" puke]
GIRL 2
Un. Choukawaii yo ne! ["Yes. Super cute, right?!"]
RANDY
Oh niice... Whoa... [begins masturbating]
GIRL 1
Watashi wa... daisuki! ["I" puke "love it!"]
RANDY
[types away] Now let's see some bestiality. [click. The sound of a woman being rammed by an elephant is heard. Randy is hitting his stride, then heads towards climax] Aahahaha, yes! Ogh! [types away] Let's get some Brazilian fart porn in there! [click. The Brazilian fart porn fetish page loads.] Oh that's good eh! Oh! [a view from outside the shed] Ohhhhhhhhh! Hoh! Hohhh! [other refugees here this and walk out of their tents to see what's going on. Sharon and the kids are out too, but they don't say a thing.]
REFUGEE MAN 2
What is that?
REFUGEE MAN 4
Sounds like someone's bein' attacked by a tiger.
RANDY
Ohhhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhhh!
VOLUNTEER 4
Get the keys! We gotta get in there. [volunteer 2 runs to the door and whips out his keys. Three other volunteers, one of them a woman, follow him up. They get the door open and enter the shed]
RANDY
[voice descending] Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! [the oldest volunteer turns on the lights and they all gasp in shock. Randy is spent, his semen all over the room, the desk, the computer, and himself.]
VOLUNTEER 2
What the...? [Sharon and the kids rush in]
STAN
Dad?
SHARON
Randy!
RANDY
[trying to explain it away] Oh. Uhh. There was a, there was a ghost! A-a-and-this, this ectoplasm! [volunteer 4 heads for the computer] Did you see the ghost? [the volunteer begins typing on the keyboard] It ran through here; it sli-it slimed me!
VOLUNTEER 2
You son of a bitch!
RANDY
Oh no it wasn't me, it was this spooky ghost! [volunteer 4 looks back at Randy, who looks back at him]
[The underground cave]
FIELD REPORTER
This is our last chance. With nowhere else to turn, the government is going to allow one brave nine-year-old boy [Kyle is shown standing before the router] to attempt his method to get the Internet running again. [shots of this breaking news airing all over the U.S.] It all comes down to this. Can the little Jewish boy reason with the Internet? Or will it be gone forever?
SCIENTIST 1
All clear for procedure.
GENERAL
All right! Let's do it! [Kyle walks forward, then up the ramp. His parents fear for him. He walks up and to the right, sees the massive plug and walks to the socket. He just pulls the plug out, waits a few seconds, and plugs it back in. The router responds with a full green signal.]
SCIENTIST 2
Look! The flashing yellow light is steady green now!
SCIENTIST 1
He did it!
SCIENTIST 3
I've got Internet!
SCIENTIST 4
Me too!
SCIENTIST 5
Internet activity in all sectors, sir. [everyone cheers. Kyle looks around a little puzzled]
[The refugee camp, moments later. The men from the camp the Marshes first visited are there]
TRANSIENT MAN 5
I've got Internet.
TRANSIENT MAN 6
Me too!
TRANSIENT MAN 3
It's back! [everyone begins to cheer there too]
[Breaking News. The two anchors are waiting for any news.]
ANCHORMAN
It's back? It's back! [the two anchors dance a jig]
[The refugee camp, moments later. Shelly hugs her laptop]
SHELLY
It's working! I can i-chat with my darling Amir now! [a boy in the background turns around and looks at Shelly]
AMIR
Shelly. Shelly Marsh? [both Shelly and Stan turn around to look at him]
SHELLY
What?
AMIR
It's me. Amir.
SHELLY
O... kay.
AMIR
Your family came here too, huh?
SHELLY
[bashful] Yeah. [the two of them look away from each other]
AMIR
So uhhh, I guess I'll e-mail you as soon as I get back home.
SHELLY
Yeah, okay. Sounds good.
AMIR
Okay, s-see ya. [turns around and walks away]
SHELLY
[turns around and skips away] We're back togehhhther! We're back togehhhther!
[South Park City Hall, day. Randy is addressing the town. He's dressed in a Native American shirt over his regular clothes]
RANDY
And so what have we learned through this ordeal? The Internet went away. It came back. But for how long we do not know. We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer. We as a country must stop over-logging -on. We must use the Internet only when we need it. It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want. But if we don't treat the Internet with the resPECT [pounds the podium hard with his right fist. A few people are startled by this] that it deserves, it could one day be gone forever. So let us learn to live with the Internet, not for it. No more browsing for no apparent reason, no more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television. And finally, [the head of a bald eagle appears on the screen behind him.] We must learn to only use the Internet for porn twice a day. Max. [everyone applauds him, then gives him a standing ovation. He has his left arm up and fist pumped.]
End of Over Logging


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:While the kids are on an educational field trip to a living museum, Cartman makes Butters sneak away from the class to go to the amusement center located next door.

script:Super Fun Time

[Entrance to Pioneer Village, day. The South Park Elementary school bus is parked. Mr. Garrison waits with a bearded employee as the class enters the attraction]
MR. GARRISON
Kids, everyone together. Welcome to Pioneer Village. This is a recreation of early Colorado days. I want you all to meet Pioneer Paul. [the bearded employee steps forward, his hands gripping his suspenders]
PIONEER PAUL
Hi, kids, and welcome to my village. I settled here in 1864 with my mahr and pahr. Sure thing, I ain't never seen strange clothes like you all are wearin'. And what's that fancy yellow horse carriage you got out there?
STAN
Ughh.
KYLE
This is gonna suck.
PIONEER PAUL
When you all are ready just head up to the village. All the townfolk are there to answer yer questions. And welcome. [tips his hat a bit to the class] To 1864. Set 'em up!
MR. GARRISON
Thank you, Pioneer Paul. [Pioneer Paul turns around and walks away.] All right, kids, this is a big place, so I want everyone to pick a partner to hold hands with. [the students look at each other and begin to pair off.]
CARTMAN
Let's be partners, Kenny.
KENNY
(No, I'm partners with Craig) [holds Craig's hand]
CARTMAN
Okay. [turns and follows Stan] Stan, let's be partners, dude. [Stan approaches Wendy and holds out his hand. She takes it]
STAN
Naw, I'm with Wendy.
CARTMAN
Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad! [Wendy flashes him an angry look as he turns and walks away. He looks around and sees most everyone is paired off. He approaches Kyle] All right, let's be partners, Kyle.
KYLE
I hate you, remember? [turns away] You wanna be partners, Jimmy?
CARTMAN
[miffed] Jesus, what have I ever done to you? Craig? Tolkien? [Clyde and Tolkien pair up] Who, who else needs a partner? [after the rest of the kids have paired up, only Butters is left. Cartman looks at him and he gets bashful all of a sudden, brushing his left foot back and forth on the ground] Uh who else needs a partner?
MR. GARRISON
Eric, partner with Butters.
CARTMAN
God damn it!
MR. GARRISON
Hold Butters' hand, Eric! [Butters motions for Cartman to take his hand]
CARTMAN
That isn't necessary!
MR. GARRISON
Butters, you are not to let go of Eric's hand until you are both back on that bus! Do you understand?!
BUTTERS
I understand. [takes Cartman's hand as Garrison turns towards the village]
MR. GARRISON
All right, let's head in. [leads the way]
CARTMAN
You can let go now, Butters.
BUTTERS
[firmly] No.
CARTMAN
Butters, come on!
BUTTERS
No! [the class is at the center of the village. Around it are a carriage house, the saloon, and the feed and tackle store]
MR. GARRISON
All right kids, go ahead and visit the charming villagers and learn stuff. [the pairs disperse] Keep track of your partner!
[The smithy's shop. The smithy is working on a horseshoe resting on an anvil. Stan, Wendy, Kyle, and Jimmy drop by]
SMITHY
Why howdy partners. [puts his tools down] I'm the town blacksmith. Are you folks settlers, or are you just trappers passin' through?
STAN
Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her.
WENDY
Thanks, Stan.
PIONEER PAUL
[dropping by] These folks sure are strange, Smithy. We ain't never seen them kind of fancy hats in our time, have we?
KYLE
[points to the Smithy] That guy is wearing a digital watch.
SMITHY
Oh jeez. [adjust the watch to hide it. Pioneer Paul gives him an angry look]
PIONEER PAUL
Damn it Chad!
CHAD
[puts it in his pocket] S-sorry, I'm sorry.
[Another smithy shop, this time for guns. Cartman, Butters, Kenny, Craig, Jenny and Riley visit]
GUNSMITH
Why howdy, partners, I'm the town gunsmith. You see, in our time it's pretty violent. See them holes in the walls? That's so we can put rifles through to protect us from Injuns.
CARTMAN
I wanna shoot an Indian.
GUNSMITH
Now some of you might wanna meet Abigail at the candle-makin' house. Or you can head over to the general store. [Kenny, Craig, and the two girls leave. Cartman and Butters head for the holes in the wall]
BUTTERS
Do you see any Indians?
CARTMAN
Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs. [just over the greenery is Super Phun Thyme, a small attraction next door.] "Super... Phun Thyme." [turns to Butters and has him step forward] Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything!
BUTTERS
Oh, that's cool. [steps back and turns around] Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone.
CARTMAN
Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!
BUTTERS
Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble!
CARTMAN
Fine, then let go of my hand!
BUTTERS
Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus!
CARTMAN
Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?!
BUTTERS
I'm not lettin' go!
CARTMAN
Fine, then you're comin' with me!
BUTTERS
No, Eric! [trips and stands up. Cartman pulls him towards the village's entrance]
CARTMAN
Butters, let go God-damn it!
BUTTERS
No! [trips and tries to stand up] T-Teacherrr! Teacherrr!
[Pioneer Paul leads Stan, Wendy, Kyle, and Jimmy into the general store.]
PIONEER PAUL
This here is our general store. It's where I buy all my supplies an' sich.
CLERK
Howdy partners. I own this hearrr general store.
WENDY
Look, Stan, they had beef jerky back then.
CLERK
What do you mean "back then"? Don't forget, it's 1864.
KYLE
Right. Except for it really isn't.
PIONEER PAUL
Wuh, sure it is. Just look around ye. [they look around, but the modern sound of sirens reaches their ears]
KYLE
What's that?
STAN
Sounds like police sirens.
PIONEER PAUL
What's a si-rene? We ain't never heard of no sirene in 1864. [the sound of screeching tires is next, and everyone heads to the windows to find out. A big black SUV pulls into the village and seven people pour out of it. One of them is injured]
LEADER
We lost them, we lost them!
INJURED THIEF
Damn pig cops!
LEADER
Close that gate! [two of his henchmen close the gate]
WENDY
What's going on?
STAN
I don't know. [the gunmen gather up the students and adults]
LEADER
Everyone down on the ground NOW!
SHERIFF
Wuh-whoa now, I'm Sheriff McLawdog. I settled here back in eighteen fif- [the leader shoots him in the forehead with a silenced gun]
STAN
Jesus Christ! [the six of them move away from the window and drop to their knees] We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone?
PIONEER PAUL
A phone? Why, what's a phone? We ain't never hearda sich a thing.
STAN
What?!
KYLE
Come on, this is serious!
PIONEER PAUL
Eh storehand, you ever heard of this fancy shmancy phone?
CLERK
Uhhh, nooo. W-we ain't got a phone in our time.
STAN
Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops!
PIONEER PAUL
If you mean the law, only law around here is town sheriff McLawdog. You see, 1864 is a time of growth and development in the Old West.
STAN
[in no mood to hear about it] This is not the time for that!
[Super Phun Thyme. Cartman pulls Butters towards it.]
CARTMAN
Aw man, this is gonna be awesome! [the go through the double doors] Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay!
BUTTERS
Well, that's your problem!
CARTMAN
All right Butters, I've seriously had enough! [tries to rip his hand out of Butters' grip, but only succeeds in pulling Butters around. He tries again, but Butters isn't letting go. He tries a third time, all the way around, and Butters' hand is clamped on tight.] Jesus Christ! [drops the matter and goes to a counter with Butters] One please.
BUTTERS
Make that two! [they each give $6.]
CASHIER
Aww, aren't you two cute holdin' hands. Are you special little buddies?
BUTTERS, CARTMAN
NO! [she gives them their tickets and they go into the attraction]
[Super Phun Thyme, interior. Cartman and Butters go into an indoor amusement park. A bounce house is off to the right and miniature golf to the left. Bumper carz and laser tagg are on either side of the bowling lanes. The arcade is on the second floor.]
CARTMAN
Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?
BUTTERS
We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do!
CARTMAN
Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars! [yanks Butters along.]
[Pioneer Village Administration. The façade is 1860s, the building itself current. Wendy reaches the entrance first.]
WENDY
Over here. This looks like an office.
KYLE
[opens the door and leads the others in, then spots the phone] Here! Here's the phone! [Wendy gets on the stool and tries to dial out]
PIONEER PAUL
Well, what a straaange contraption.
WENDY
I can't get a dial tone. [Kyle listens, then lowers the receiver]
KYLE
What's the number to dial out?
PIONEER PAUL
Dial out? Partner, them are some funny words you're usin'.
STAN
Dude, do you understand what's going on here?! [Kyle and Wendy trade places]
CLERK
Maybe they're right, Brian. I mean, this is a special circumstance that-
PIONEER PAUL
[grabs him by the collar and shoves him against the door] Brresh! [points something out to him. It's a sign over the door: "Remember: Never Break Character!"]
CLERK
Ogh, I mean, this here room is, it sure is strange. We have nothin' like these fancy devices in our time.
PIONEER PAUL
I'll say.
KYLE
I got through. Hello, police?
911 OPERATOR
Nine one one, what's your emergency?
KYLE
There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage!
911 OPERATOR
Taken hostage where?
KYLE
The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling.
911 OPERATOR
You mean that annoying place where employees won't break character?
KYLE
[glances back at the two men] Sister, you don't know the half of it.
[Super Phun Thyme. Cartman rides a Space Pilot rocket]
CARTMAN
Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss!
CARTMAN
I'm having a super fun time playin
[Cartman and Butters are at a Thirst For Blood video game. Cartman navigates, Butters fires away half-heartedly]
CARTMAN
Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here! [next they're playing air hockey. They take turns, but still have to run together in switching sides. They run to Butters' side and Butters hits the puck] Oh, you got it. Nice. [they run to Cartman's side, and Cartman hits the puck. They run back to Butters' side...]
CARTMAN
Super fun time, please don't go awahay.
[Cartman and Butters skate as a pair on roller skates, then they share an ice cream sundae. A couple walks by and looks at them funny.]
BUTTERS
What are you whoofelin' at? [the couple hurries away]
CARTMAN
No more worries or cares, super fun time.
CARTMAN
[on a Road Hogg motorcycle ride as Butters gets on] Waiwait, keep- you're fine. [starts the ride. The motorcycle rocks back and forth quickly] Oh man, whoa!
BUTTERS
Whoa! [gets tossed into the air, but doesn't let go of Cartman's hand. He ends up on Cartman's lap before the ride ends]
CARTMAN
The answer to my prayers, super fun time.
Super fun time, you're all I need.
[Cartman and Butters are playing Laser Tagg, except that Cartman is shooting at Butters gleefully. Next, they finally hit the bumper cars. Once everyone is in, the power is turned on. Butters is stuck outside the car, as there's no room for him, so he gets some injuries.]
CARTMAN
Yeheah, we're wired up!
CARTMAN
I'll have a super fun time till I freakin; bleed.
I love you mornin' noon and night, super fun time.
CARTMAN
[two cars bump into him] Yeah, bumper cars, sweeet! [Butters is battered]
CARTMAN
You make my life so right, super fun time.
[Near the entrance, still inside]
BUTTERS
Th-that's it, Eric. We have to be gettin' back!
CARTMAN
Aw, just a few more things.
BUTTERS
No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left!
CARTMAN
Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on. [they leave Super Phun Thyme]
[Pioneer Village, later. The leader of the gunmen barks orders into a walkie talkie and paces back and forth.]
LEADER
Set up the satellite relay, check for alternate routes out of the area. [turns to the hostage group] Unfortunately, your police department got wind of our robbery and chased after us. That is unfortunate for you, because when I think it is clear to leave we will now need to take hostages with us to ensure our goods get to their final destination.
MR. GARRISON
Please, if you must take anyone, don't take me. These kids are worth more to you. [the kids are shocked at him. The sirens are heard again]
BLOND
How did they find us?!
LEADER
Get the loot out of the car and stash it in that building. [a bunch of police cars show up at the parking lot and their officers quickly get out and get into position]
POLICE CHIEF
All right, men, listen up! Looks like our thieves are trying to hide out here. They've got the employees and some school kids held hostage.
LIEUTENANT
Tucker, Dylan, set up a perimeter!
POLICE CHIEF
Everyone stay on your toes! These are professionals we're dealing with here!
OFFICER 1
What did they rob, sir?
POLICE CHIEF
A Burger King.
[A table in the building the leader was referring to. The leader is there with the injured man and a woman. They pool their money onto the table]
LEADER
All right, good. Is that all of it? [a big balding man comes in with several Burger King meals in bags]
BALDING MAN
No. Don't forget we've got these too.
LEADER
Excellent. Now listen, everyone, we're going to be all right. This is only a small hitch in our plan. [pulls out a cell phone and dials some numbers.] I'd like to speak with the chief of police! [listens] Who is this? This is the man who is going to kill an entire class of fourth graders if he doesn't get exactly what he wants!
[Outdoors in Pioneer Village. The group that was in the administration building now arrives in the center of the village and ducks down behind a trough]
KYLE
Why aren't the cops coming in?
WENDY
They must be negotiating.
PIONEER PAUL
Them there bandits sure look mighty strange. And them pistols is way bigger than whats we's gots.
KYLE
[annoyed] Will you shut up!
STAN
Wait, you have guns here?
PIONEER PAUL
Sure. Sheriff got lots of rifles in his office.
STAN
Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?!
PIONEER PAUL
All righty. Come on, storehand.
CLERK
Yeppir! [they leave]
[Kipling, near Pioneer Village. Cartman and Butters head back to the village after a few hours at Super Phun Thyme.]
CARTMAN
Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village.
BUTTERS
We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.
CARTMAN
Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.
BUTTERS
Yeah, well, I guess that's kinda true.
CARTMAN
[stops in his tracks] Uh oh. [sees the police at the Pioneer Village entrance.] Crap, they called the cops on us.
BUTTERS
What?! They called the cops?!
CARTMAN
They must have realized we left. Damn.
BUTTERS
Oh my God, the police are looking for us!
CARTMAN
[covers Cartman's mouth and takes him behind a mail box] Shhh! Butters!
BUTTERS
[quickly upset] We're gonna get it now!
CARTMAN
Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!
BUTTERS
You just got me busted forever! [starts sobbing]
CARTMAN
Butters, l-listen to me, listen.
BUTTERS
No! [turns away and continues sobbing]
CARTMAN
All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along.
BUTTERS
You said they wouldn't notice we were gone. You promised. [punches him softly on the chest with his free hand]
CARTMAN
If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right? [Butters calms down and stops sobbing] All right, now let go of my hand.
BUTTERS
No.
CARTMAN
Butters?
BUTTERS
Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now.
CARTMAN
All right, come on! [they head back towards Super Phun Thyme]
[Inside Pioneer Village, day. The leader gives more commands as he walks along. He reaches one of his henchman, who's got monitoring equipment laid out and operational]
LEADER
Keep the hostages from talking and search for holdouts. Everyone check in at two-minute intervals. I hope you have good news, Orlich.
ORLICH
The police have us completely surrounded on all sides. There's no way we're gettin' out above ground without being spotted.
LEADER
Above ground?
ORLICH
Look, I found this at the rear of the park. It's an old mine shaft, [a picture of an abandoned gold mine appears] but Pioneer Village was sued when a kid died in it, so they closed it down and protected it with a huge me'al door with a coded lock.
LEADER
So if we can get into the shaft we can tunnel our way around the police. Excellent.
ORLICH
One more thing, Franz: I want my share of the take now.
FRANZ
[finally, a name for the leader] What's the matter, Orlich? Lose your sense of trust?
ORLICH
I was just thinking maybe we get through that tunnel. Then you take the loot to Berlin and I never see you again. I want my cut.
FRANZ
Very well. [hands him a wad of bills and a Burger King lunch bag. Orlich opens the bag, takes out his burger, and leafs through its contents like a deck of playing cards to make sure nothing is missing]
[The village square, moments later. The blacksmith is tied up and sitting on a wooden chair. The woman hits the blacksmith's right eye with the butt of her gun]
FRANZ
I'm going to ask you again, what is the door code to the tunnel?!
SMITHY
I told you, mister, what would I know about a door code? I'm just a simple blacksmith. With my trusty forge I makes all the metalworks for the village. [the woman strikes his face again with her rifle] OW.
FRANZ
[holds up the smithy's employee profile] You are an employee here, that means you are required to know the door code for fire code reasons, [reads from the profile] Mister David Palmer of Colorado Springs!
SMITHY
Huh my name ain't Palmer, it's... Old Smithy. Hand we ain't never heard of no fire code, why, we gots to put fires out ourselves when the- [the woman strikes his face again with her rifle] OW.
FRANZ
That's it! [aims his gun at Smithy's left temple. The woman backs away] Tell me the code or you die! [the smithy sobs] One... two...
SMITHY
I...
FRANZ
Yes?
SMITHY
I don't know nothin' about no fancy door code. I'm just a simple blacksmith. [Franz kills him and his body drops off the chair. The class and the pioneer villagers but Craig are stunned]
CRAIG
[observes] These Pioneer Village workers are really committed to their jobs. [another worker is tied up and put on the chair as the smithy's body is dragged away]
WORKER
No. Please. Don't hurt me.
FRANZ
Give us the code to that door and we can leave!
WORKER
[shuts his eyes hard] I've never heard of sss-something called a door code. [leans over and whispers] Please, can't you ask some other way?
FRANZ
I don't have time for your stupid game! Tell me, or you die right now! [gets his gun ready]
WORKER
All right, all right! Look, it's just, it's just one of those... Jenkins home security locks. You press the top button and then, and then enter 5-2 [he's killed, but by someone else. The class and the pioneer villagers gasp when it sees whom the killer is. Pioneer Paul is shown with a rifle in his hand, and the general store clerk is next to him]
PIONEER PAUL
[tosses his rifle away and walks to the class] What he meant to say, kids, is that we ain't never heard o'no fancy door code 'cause in our time, we gots to rely on wood locks and sich.
FRANZ
God damn it you people are fucking insane!
[Kyle, Wendy, Stan, and Jimmy have seen this all from behind the trough]
KYLE
I don't believe it.
FRANZ
Domino, [looks at the balding man, then at another henchman] Vosky! Find out if there are any employees or students wandering about! Bring them here or shoot them! [the two henchmen move out]
WENDY
Oh crap, we've gotta hide. Come on! [they start to move.]
JIMMY
Yeah. [all stop] We've gotta geh- ...geh... get the hell ...outta here f- f-hast fast. [they finally leave]
[Outside Pioneer Village. The police are scouring the surroundings. One of them answers a call]
OFFICER 2
Sector Bravo, no activity.
BUTTERS
Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere.
CARTMAN
Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside. [turns left and points] Look, see that traffic signal down there? [the intersection is shown] If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free.
BUTTERS
That looks dangerous.
CARTMAN
Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on. [they head to the signal. Butters is lighter, so he goes up first. He pulls Cartman along up the traffic signal, then stands on the arm] Good, that's good. [Cartman stands up too] That's good, Good, all right then. Let's head across. [they begin to tip-toe along the traffic signal's arm.] Go easy. Good.
BUTTERS
Oh gosh in heaven.
CARTMAN
It's all right. You've got it, no problem- [his left foot slips, causing them both to lose their balance] OP.
BUTTERS
Whoa!
CARTMAN
Save me!
BUTTERS
I'm gonna fall! [they both scream as they struggle to stay on the arm, but they both fall off... and end up hanging from the arm like a pair of tennis shoes tied together]
CARTMAN
... Oh dude, laaame.
[The village square. Franz is still on top of things.]
FRANZ
Frohlich, check in. Have you found any other employees?
DOMINO
We found somebody. [the two henchmen he sent off earlier return]
VOSKY
We found this guy in the jail of the sheriff's office.
PIONEER PAUL
[gasps] You let out Murderin' Murphy?
MURDERIN' MURPHY
Y'are all gettin' it for puttin' me in that thar jail!
FRANZ
[frustrated and pissed off] Stop it! Stop your bad historical acting right now!
WOMAN
Tarnation. Why'd you let Murderin' Murphy go? He's a bad man.
FRANZ
[approaching the employees] I am the fucking bad man! Do you get that?! Knock it off and give me the mine shaft access code!
PIONEER PAUL
You're just gonna have to kill us, mister, 'cause you ain't makin' no sense at all.
FRANZ
I won't kill you if you don't tell me. I'll kill one of THEM! [walks over to the students...]
MR. GARRISON
Not me! Not me not me not me not me! [...and grabs Kenny]
KENNY
(What? Hey, let go.)
FRANZ
[drags Kenny to the employees] Do you want to see a child die?!
KENNY
(No they don't wanna see a child die! You guys! Uf.)
[The traffic signal, later.]
BUTTERS
I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it!
CARTMAN
Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look! [a big truck is headed their way] This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go!
BUTTERS
Huh... [swings over, and they both land on the truck. They then move about looking for a good position to jump from]
CARTMAN
Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump!
BUTTERS
Let's do it!
CARTMAN
Ready? Go! [they leap off the truck and over the wooden wall. The police are not aware of this. They land on a roof and roll of it into a wooden wheelbarrow, which tips over and dumps them onto the ground.]
[Inside Pioneer Village. at the village square.]
FRANZ
[Domino and Vosky bring the female employee over to Kenny, who is tied up on the chair] What about you? Will you tell us the access code or do you want to see this kid die?!
WOMAN
I'm sorry, I'm a woman and women in our time ain't allowed to know the carryin's on of the town proper.
FRANZ
God damn it!
[In a nearby building, Stan, Wendy and Jimmy hide under a table. Kyle peeks out a hole in the boarded-up windows behind the table]
KYLE
Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny!
STAN
I can't let them do it. [comes out from under the table] I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice. [turns and heads for the door, then exits the building]
KYLE
Stan?
WENDY
[leans out] Where are you going, Stan?
STAN
Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away. [turns around, grabs some dirt, rubs it on his face, and walks to the hostage area]
FRANZ
All right, that does it! [jabs the tip of the gun up against Kenny's hood. Kenny just looks at him] On the count of three this child dies! One! Two!
KENNY
(Goddamnit, fucking save me!)
STAN
[walks up] Well howdy there, strangers. [everyone looks at him as he approaches] Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich..
PIONEER PAUL
Ohhh, welcome, partner. [the other employees welcome him as well.]
FRANZ
Wha-what are you doing?
STAN
I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail.
PIONEER PAUL
That's right, Murderin' Murphy. He's crazy 'cause someone killed his pa.
MURDERIN' MURPHY
They killed my pahr!
STAN
I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe.
PIONEER PAUL
Y-y-yeah, I understand that.
CLERK
Finally, a fella that talks some sense.
STAN
If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck?
PIONEER PAUL
Oh, well uh, I reckon the easiest number to remember for any big safe door lock would be... 1864.
CLERK
Yup, 1864, 'cause that's the year it is.
FRANZ
Eighteen sixty four. Orlich, we have the door code! Start packing up! We'll take the hostages with us! [smiles]
MR. GARRISON
No, you got your door code, let us go!
VOSKY
Copy that. What's the code, over. [Butters and Cartman step out from behind a building, then quickly step back behind it before they can be seen]
CARTMAN
Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters. [they step out again and walk towards Vosky, who gets ready to shoot] Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters?
BUTTERS
Yeah, it sure has.
CARTMAN
Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm.
BUTTERS
Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh...
CARTMAN
Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome.
BUTTERS
Been a hoot all right!
VOSKY
Get your hands behind your head!
CARTMAN
What'd we do? We've been here the whole time.
VOSKY
Shut up! Put your hands behind your head! Do it now! [they put their free hands behind their heads, which surprises him] Let go of each other!
BUTTERS
Huh uh.
VOSKY
Do what I tell you!
BUTTERS
Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here!
VOSKY
Let go or else I'll put a bullet through your hands and make you let go!
CARTMAN
Butters.
VOSKY
Now!
BUTTERS
No! [remembering how Cartman swung him around at Super Phun Thyme, he swings Cartman around and knocks Vosky down. He and Cartman sprint across the field and manage to avoid the barrage of bullets Wilskey sends their way]
CARTMAN
Jesus Christ! [Vosky fires off a grenade, which hits a house just as Cartman and Butters run past it. The blast blows them off their feet]
BUTTERS
AAAAH!
CARTMAN
AAAAH! [this and the gunfire alert the other robbers]
FRANZ
Go! Go take care of it! I'll stay with the hostages! [the gunwoman and Orlich leave]
STAN
Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller?
MURDERIN' MURPHY
Yeah.
STAN
He done killed yer pahr.
MURDERIN' MURPHY
[stands up enraged] What?! Well I'll rip his head off! [runs towards Franz and tackles him]
OFFICER 2
We've got a chance. Hostages are clear! [officers climb over the wooden wall and pour into the village.]
FRANZ
They are coming in! [the shootout between cops and robbers begins. Orlich is shot dead and his burger drops to the floor next to him. The gunwoman fires, and the cops fire back. She is shot through a window and dies.]
MR. GARRISON
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
OFFICER 3
Whoa, no, no!
OFFICER 2
Hostages are secure at the park entrance!
MURDERIN' MURPHY
I got you now, Pioneer Paul!
PIONEER PAUL
They shoulda never let you out of jail, Murderin' Murphy! [they get into a fistfight. Domino shoots at the cops from the second floor of the saloon. The cops fire back and Domino keels over, dead. Franz walks over to Orlich's body and takes back his cut]
POLICE CHIEF
[arrives and aims his gun] Freeze, scumbag! It's all over! [Other officers gather and aim their weapons. Franz drops his satchel and puts his hands behind his head.]
WOMAN
Murderin' Murphy's gonna kill Pioneer Paul!
OFFICER 2
[aims his gun at the men] Stop right now! It's over! [a bell rings out three tones and the fistfight ends]
PA SYSTEM
Howdy, partners. It's five o'clock. Pioneer Village is now closed for the day. [Murphy and Paul let go of each other and stand up smiling] Head back to your wagons and have a safe trip home.
PIONEER PAUL
We made it!
MURDERIN' MURPHY
We made it! [the employees hug each other and begin to disperse]
WOMAN 2
Oh God, I can't wait to get out of this dress.
MURDERIN' MURPHY
Whoa, that was great! [the employees begin to drop their makeup and other bits of costume]
PIONEER PAUL
Uh, listen, if anyone still wants to know, the phone is in the administration building, you dial 9 to get out, and there's actually a back exit behind the horse troughs. Good night everybody, thanks for coming. We did it, guys!
GUNSMITH
Let's go to TGI Fridays and get some jalapeño poppers!
MURDERIN' MURPHY
Yeah, that'd be great!
MAN 1
All right!
MAN 2
Oh yeah, huh. Jalapeño poppers.
MAN 3
Let's go, huh.
[Outside Pioneer Village, evening. The cops finish up their investigations. Mr. Garrison talks to them with his class around him.]
WENDY
Stan, you were really brave in there, but you did kind of sound like a big dork.
STAN
I know.
POLICE CHIEF
Come on you!
FRANZ
You're hurting my arm!
POLICE CHIEF
Too bad! You'll be going away for a long time. Was it worth it?
FRANZ
In a way, it was. I might not have gotten away, but... at least I learned a lot about Pioneer life in the Old West. Those early settlers didn't have the modern conveniences we all take for granted today. To think how difficult it was back in those times to do somethin' as simple as washing your clothes. Pioneer Village has a lot to teach us all.
POLICE CHIEF
That's true. [Franz is put in a squad car and the cops continue with their work]
WENDY
[looks at Pioneer Village] Hey look. [Butters walks towards the entrance dragging Cartman behind him. Cartman is passed out. Butters drags him over the sidewalk, across the parking lot, and on to the bus. Only then does he let go]
BUTTERS
Teacher, my partner is back on the bus! [all energy leaves him and he passes out too]
End of Super Fun Time


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:With the rest of the American people haunted by the memory of a recent tragic event, only Butters will stand with Cartman as he confronts the Chinese.

script:The China Probrem

[The Beijing Olympics Opening Ceremonies. The flag of the People's Republic of China flaps over the Bird's Nest, aka the National Stadium]
ANNOUNCER
Welcome to the televised broadcast of the Olympic Opening Ceremonies from Beijing. [fireworks enter the stadium and the drum roll begins. The drummers are bent over their drums as lights in the drums flash on and off] Thousands of Chinese performers playing ancient Chinese drums. [the roll ends in a wave of drummers standing up straight and not drumming] The precision of their movements made even more impressive by their massive numbers. [all the drummers strike their drums at once and the light display resumes]
[Cartman's room, night. Cartman isn't having a peaceful dream]
CARTMAN
[dreaming about being at the Opening Ceremonies] No! The Chinese, no! Somebody has to stop them! [The stadium lights come up and the drummers resume their drumming. Cartman is getting restless] No! No!
LIANE
[knocks on his door] Eric? Sweetie, are you having nightmares about the Chinese again?
CARTMAN
[talking in his sleep] They're gonna... take over the world! HAA! [The drummers start up again] Too many of them. [Cartman now dreams of walking among the drummers] No! Leave us alone! [The drummers strike solidly on their drums, and Cartman now finds himself bouncing on the drums as they rise and fall under him] Nooo! [Four different groups of Chinese Olympians surround him. Cartman wakes from his nightmare and checks his face to be sure he's not dreaming] Damn it no! No!
LIANE
[quickly enters the room, turns on the light and comes to his side] Sweetiekins, are you all right?
CARTMAN
Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me!
LIANE
[consoles him] No, sweetie, the Chinese aren't going to get you.
CARTMAN
[sobbing] They are so! There's two billion of them and their economy is getting better and with all their advances in technology they're gonna bring down America!
[The bus stop, day. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny await the bus. Cartman walks up and stands between Kyle and Kenny.]
CARTMAN
[being serious] All right. Guys, we need to talk. [no response from the other three] You know, uh we can all just pretend... that we didn't see those opening ceremonies but, the Chinese... are very real. We've gotta do something. [the other boys stay silent] Are we just gonna pretend America is going to be okay? Are we just going to... wait until they've taken over the world?
KYLE
[steps forward, away from the others] I'm sorry. [holds his palms up and out, then shakes them as if to hold off something] I I'm sorry, I can't do this. [then lowers them] I'm not doing this. [walks off to his right]
STAN
[stops Kyle in his tracks just by saying] Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something?
KYLE
Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore! [walks away. The other boys look at him, Stan a bit shocked]
KENNY
(Damn.)
['[Kyle's room, moments later. Kyle is at his desk moping, his arms crossed and his face buried in them. Someone knocks twice, then opens the door. It's Stan.]']
STAN
Kyle. [Kyle doesn't reply. Stan sighs, closes the door and approaches him] Kyle, you can't keep doing this. You know what, at some point, you've got to let this go.
KYLE
Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't.
STAN
Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on.
KYLE
[leaves his desk angrily and faces Stan] Move on?! Our friend was raped, Stan! He was raped, and we all stood there and did [takes his hands, puts them side by side, and sweeps them out away from each other] nothing!
STAN
There was nothing we could do, Kyle! [Kyle walks away. Stan says softly] There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there.
KYLE
[turns around and faces Stan] Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them!
STAN
How?
KYLE
[turns away again] I dream about it every night. Every time I close my eyes I see us just running away, running while they ray-rape him over and over again. [clenches his fists at the thought of it, then loosens the grips and turns around] And because we did nothing... they got away.
STAN
You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go.
KYLE
[wipes something from his forehead] I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can. [walks out of the room. Stan watches him leave, then sighs]
STAN
[puts his hands in his jacket pockets] God damn it.
[Butters' bathroom. Butters is taking a bubble bath with a rubber ducky and a toy submarine]
BUTTERS
Lu lu lu I've got some splish-splash. Lu lu lu splish-splashin' more... Lu lu lu-
CARTMAN
[bursts into the bathroom, startling Butters] There you are, Butters!
BUTTERS
Uhuh, Eric.
CARTMAN
Butters, I need your help.
BUTTERS
Not now, Eric, I'm ih I'm indecent.
CARTMAN
The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care!
BUTTERS
The Chinese?
CARTMAN
I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now.
BUTTERS
Aw, I can't stop the Chinese tonight, Eric, uh I'm supposed to make a model car with my dad.
CARTMAN
You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents!
BUTTERS
Why are they gonna kill my parents?
CARTMAN
Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny. [with determination] Will you join me?
BUTTERS
I don't want my parents to die.
CARTMAN
[hops onto the stool] So you'll join the American Liberation Front?!
BUTTERS
Well sure.
CARTMAN
[cups Butters' right hand between his own two hands] You and me: we're going to be the brave little boys who fought back, Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese.
BUTTERS
Yeah, [pounds his left fist into the water] fuck 'em.
[Kyle's room, night. He's asleep]
KYLE
No... No! [he's having a nightmare] No...
[In the dream. Only the voices are heard at first]
KYLE
No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape!
STAN
Let's get out of here!
KYLE
We can't just leave!
STAN
Come on!
KYLE
Aw it's horrible! [we now join the dream already in progress]
[The setting is the Bijou theater, day. The movie playing is "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"]
STAN
Oh God!
KYLE
Somebody do something!
CLYDE
Why are they doing this?!
[Inside the theater.]
KYLE
They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're... [blinks hard] they're raping him! [Stan quickly covers his eyes]
STAN
I can't watch! [uncovers his eyes and rises from his seat] Let's get out of here Kyle! [leaves. Kenny follows him out of the row, then Clyde, Butters, and Jimmy.]
KYLE
Why would Spielberg and Lucas do this?!
STAN
COME ON LET'S GO! [grabs Kyle by the right hand and drags him out]
KYLE
WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?!
STAN
JUST RUN!! [the six boys run out of there.]
[Outside the theater.]
STAN
Why aliens? Aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie? [Kyle throws up] Come on dude! There's nothing we can do!
CLYDE
[in despair] Whyyy? Whyyy?? [Kenny runs around is disbelief]
JIMMY
We can't help him now.
BUTTERS
Well I thought it was pretty good.
STAN
Let's just go, Let's just go! [grabs Kyle's right hand and pulls him away from the theater]
KYLE
[suddenly wakes up] NOO! [sits on the edge of his bed.] Noo. No. Awwh. [sobs softly in relief] Aw no...
[South Park, day. Cartman and Butters walk down the street and approach a corner. Cartman is carrying a duffle bag]
CARTMAN
All right Butters, we're here. [sets the duffle bag down] Are you ready?
BUTTERS
I'm scared, but I know my country needs me.
CARTMAN
This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now. [points at something across the street - a P.F. Chang's China Bistro] Things could get ugly in there, Butters. We've got to infiltrate, and find out the Chinese invasion plans. [opens the duffle bag and begins to search through it]
BUTTERS
But Eric, wu-why would the, Chinese tell us their invasion plans?
CARTMAN
Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them. [pulls out a Chinese peasant hat] Here, put these teeth in! [hands him some buck teeth] And just say "herro" and "prease" a lot. [puts in his own buck teeth and squints his eyes] "Oh, herro prease." Ping pong ching chong.
BUTTERS
Ping ping. Herro. ...Prease.
[P.F. Chang's, moments later. Cartman and Butters enter in Chinese costumes. Cartman now has makeup on his eyes while Butters wears a fez and has drawn glasses around his eyes]
GREETER
[a woman] Uhh welcome to P.F. Chang's. I'll be right with you. [turns to other guests]
BUTTERS
[leans over] Hey, Eric, uh these people aren't Chinese.
CARTMAN
[panics, voice rising] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
BUTTERS
[walks up to him] What?
CARTMAN
It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country!
GREETER
Uh, can I help you?
CARTMAN
Ah yes, herro prease. [puts his hands together and bows a bit] We are Chinese peopull.
BUTTERS
[also bows] Herro prease. Ting tao ding ling.
GREETER
Uh yeah, why don't I seat you over here? [they follow her to their table and take their seats. She gives them their menus] Your waitress will be right with you.
CARTMAN
Fruttar sheshar. [the greeter leaves] What the hell is going on here? We've gotta sneak our back into the back Butters- uh huck! [goes into hushed tones and points] There they are! Chinese people! There are Chinese people right over there! [Butters leans over and looks back. Sure enough, a Chinese family of five is looking at them] Do you see them?
BUTTERS
Yeah.
CARTMAN
Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out.
BUTTERS
Stay calm, Eric.
CARTMAN
They're right over there, and they're gonna start screaming and banging on those drums, and then they're go- [Butters smacks him, shutting him up] Thank you Butters. All right, we need to go over there and find out what we can from those Commie rats. [they make their way to the family's table] Oh, herro, prease, herro.
BUTTERS
[bows a bit] Herro, prease.
CARTMAN
So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves.
BUTTERS
Fing fong ting tong.
CARTMAN
Ting ton teetong.
MOTHER
他们在干什么啊？[subtitled] What are they doing?
FATHER
诶，我真的不知道。[subtitled] I don't know.
CARTMAN
Yeah, [gibberish] So, what are the plans to take over America again? I fohgot. [snickers. The family just stares at them]
[Stark's pond, evening. Jimmy sits on a bench staring out over the water as the sun sets. The lake looks more like a lake should look now]
STAN
[walks into view] Jimmy? I don't know what to do about Kyle. [walks towards the shore] You know, I... I don't think he's ever going to be the same.
JIMMY
And what about you, Stan? We were all in the theater that day. We all... saw it happen.
STAN
Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it.
JIMMY
I thought I could go on like before. But after seeing Indiana get raped... After seeing Indiana get raped I know I'll never be the sa-a-ame, the same? The same. [Stan turns right and sighs] Do you remember that scene with Indiana in the refrigerator? [Stan turns his head to look back] It didn't make any sense, Stan.
STAN
[turns to face Jimmy] I don't need this now. [looks away and closes his eyes] I just want things to be the way they were! [runs off]
JIMMY
[turns left to follow Stan's path] You can't run away from it forever, [faces the lake again] Stan! Sooner or later, we all have to face what we fe-fe-fehh fehsow.
[Stan wanders through town, but stops to remember something: he's in the movie theater watching a movie and eating popcorn]
STAN
Indiana Jones! All right! [The screen is shown: Indy is at the foot of a long set of stairs]
INDY
[turns to face Stan] Hey there, Stan. All set to see my new adventure?
STAN
[happily] You bet, Indiana! [Stan's jaw drops. Steven Spielberg and George Lucas walk up behind Indy, smiling] No!... Look out Indy, it's... Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!
SPIELBERG
Well well hello there Indiana. [rubs Indy's left shoulder]
LUCAS
[pats Indy's back lovingly] You're looking cute. [they begin to rough him up]
STAN
No! Uh what are you gonna do to him?! [they begin to disrobe Indy]
SPIELBERG
Oh yeah! [Spielberg rips Indy's shirt open]
INDY
No! [Stan covers his mouth in disbelief and alarm]
STAN
Indy! [Lucas and Spielberg now have Indy pinned to the ground]
LUCAS
Yeah! Get his pants down! Get his pants down! [Spielberg pulls down Indy's pants as Indy wails]
SPIELBERG
Hold him, Lucas! Come on!
LUCAS
[holding Indy down] Heheh! He-he ain't goin' nowhere!
SPIELBERG
[gets on top of Indy] Yeah!
STAN
No, stop! Raape!
INDY
HOOOOOOOOO! [the daydream ends and Stan has tears in his eyes. He breaks down and falls on all fours, weeping. He raises his face and fist to the sky and continues weeping]
[P.F. Chang's. Cartman and Butters are still there...]
CARTMAN
All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?!
BUTTERS
Okay, okay.
CARTMAN
Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran.
BUTTERS
Huh, invasion pran.
CARTMAN
What day is American invasion again? I fohget. [snickers]
FATHER
'Scuse me, miss?
GREETER
Yes sir?
FATHER
These people won't leave us alone.
CARTMAN
[thinks a bit] ...No no, it's okay. We are Chinese peopull.
FATHER
You aren't Chinese.
CARTMAN
Oh my God...
BUTTERS
We're busted! Uh what do we do??
GREETER
Okay, why don't we go...
CARTMAN
Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?! [moves into the main area of the restaurant] Don't... touch us! We know what the Chinese are up to! We saw the Olympic Opening Ceremonies! [a couple stops eating] The gig is up! Everyone just s-step over to that wall! [points to his right] I mean it! Butters, hold this gun on them. [pulls a gun from a pocket and hands it to Butters]
BUTTERS
A gun?
CARTMAN
Hold the gun on them Butters!
BUTTERS
I don't want a gun, Eric!
CARTMAN
They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me!
BUTTERS
Oh jeez...
CARTMAN
Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move! [the guests rise from their seats with their hands up and move over to the wall Cartman pointed to] We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese!
PATRON
This is stupid. I'm leaving!
CARTMAN
Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive!
PATRON
[walks towards the front doors] Screw you!
CARTMAN
Shoot him, Butters!
BUTTERS
No!
CARTMAN
You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it!
BUTTERS
Waah! [looks away with his eyes shut and shoots at the patron. The bullet hits the patron in the groin, which splatters all over his clothes. The patron puts his hands over his crotch in pain]
PATRON
Ow! A-Ah! A-Ooowww!
CARTMAN
Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.
BUTTERS
Huh?
CARTMAN
That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.
BUTTERS
But I was just trying to stop him, and you said-
CARTMAN
[faces him] It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just weak. I can't believe you, Butters.
[Stormy Weathers's office. Kyle sits in a chair facing the Stormy, who's behind his desk.]
KYLE
My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I [sniffs and wipes his nose with his right hand] I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible.
STORMY
[looking through the paperwork] You want to bring Steven Spielberg and George Lucas to trial for raping Indiana Jones.
KYLE
I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day. [sniffs and wipes his nose with his right hand] But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone.
STAN
You aren't alone. [he enters the room with Kenny, Clyde, and Jimmy]
KYLE
[gets off the chair] Stan?
STAN
We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again. [begins to cry and leans into Kyle's shoulder. Kyle consoles him and begins to cry. The other boys cry as well] I love you.
KYLE
I love you too.
STORMY
[interrupts the crying] Uh kids, kids, I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous.
STAN
Wh-why?
STORMY
You don't have a case here. You can't really say that Spielberg and Lucas raped Indiana Jones in the new film.
KYLE
[points at him] Did you see it?
STORMY
Yes I saw it, but I- [his face drops and he turns away] But I just try not to think about it.
STAN
Then you saw what Lucas and Spielberg did to him!
STORMY
I don't know what I saw! [crosses his arms] All right?! I mean, it wa-it was dark in the theater... I mean... yeah, things got a little out of hand with the plot... the third act took too long, uh-
KYLE
Indy deserved more than that!
STORMY
[wheels around] GET OUT! JUST GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE! [the boys leave, and the DA slams the door shut on them. The DA returns to his desk, sits in his chair, and begins to cry. He remembers the scene this way:] No, no... [pounds his desk]
[a bar, night. Indy is at a pinball machine playing away]
SPIELBERG
Well well, Indiana Jones. [the Stormy is playing on a different arcade game] You're looking nice. [the pinball machine the Stormy is at has a Willow theme all over; the one Indy is at has a Howard the Duck theme. Lucas has Indy pinned on the machine with his pants down. Spielberg unbuttons Indy's shirt and starts licking his nipples.]
INDY
Hey. Hey! [begins to wail and moan]
SPIELBERG
There you go, Lucas! Dick him! [Indy struggles to get away, but Lucas is in full control] He's gonna do it right there! All right! All right Georgie!
LUCAS
Grab his hands, heh. [Spielberg runs up and holds Indy's hands down on the pinball machine]
STORMY
Hey leave him alone! [Lucas now pulls down his pants and sticks his dick in Indy's ass, firmly covering Indy's mouth with his right hand to muffle the screams.]
SPIELBERG
COME ON BIG GUY!
INDY
NOOO! [three men approach to see what's happening. Indy looks at them and they quickly leave. The pinball machine moves violently. A glass of beer resting on it falls and shatters. Lucas comes to climax and the strain on his face is clearly shown. The Stormy covers his eyes, and his recollection ends]
STORMY
Nooo... Nohoho... [pounds his desk. Moments later he opens his window as the boys leave the courthouse] Waaait! [the boys stop and look up] Wait I... want to help! [begins to cry. The boys down below begin to cry also.]
[P.F. Chang's, night. The diners are all up against the wall.]
FATHER
Look, we don't know what you're talking about. There's no Chinese plan to take over America.
CARTMAN
Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us! [police sirens are heard approaching] Oh, thank God, the police are here! We're safe! [walks towards the front doors]
CAPTAIN
You with the gun, step out or we will fire upon you.
CARTMAN
[walks outside] No no, you got it wrong. We aren't the Chinese, we're the good gu- [notices something different. The camera shows that one of the police officers is Chinese] AAH! [runs back inside and back to Butters] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
BUTTERS
Uhwhat?
CARTMAN
[quite agitated] One of the cops is Chinese! Son of a bitch, how high up does this thing go? We can't trust anybody here, Butters! [heads to a window with Butters in tow, and opens it] Don't come any closer! We have information that we will only trust with the President of the United States!
OFFICER
The President?
CAPTAIN
All right men, come on. We're going in.
CARTMAN
No! God damn it we're serious! We'll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a warning shot, Butters! [Butters shuts his eyes and shoots. The Chinese officer is struck in the groin and it explodes all over his clothes]
CHINESE OFFICER
[puts his hands over his crotch] Ow! Ah, o-ow! [Cartman looks on in disbelief]
CARTMAN
Dude! What the fuck are you doing?!
BUTTERS
What? What happened? [looks outside the window]
CARTMAN
God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?!
BUTTERS
Aw, I did it again?
CARTMAN
What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool! [looks away for a few moments, but...] You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick!
BUTTERS
[finally speaks up] Well okay, I'm sorry!
CARTMAN
...It's not okay! Defeating the Chinese won't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick! [walks away] God damn it!
[Park County Police Station, night. Stormy and the five boys are inside]
STORMY
It's all right there in front of you, Detective. Five sworn statements from these... brave boys. It's now up to you.
DET. YATES
Are you nuts?! I'm not going out and arresting Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!
STAN
But they raped Indiana Jones!
KYLE
I know it's hard to think about, but you have to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel.
DET. YATES
I didn't see it. [the boys stay silent]
JIMMY
...You didn't see the new Indiana Jones movie?
DET. YATES
No! I don't think anybody here saw it. Did you, Mitch? [Mitch is at the window looking outside through the glass] Mitch? Mitch? [close-up on Mitch, who begins to remember... Indiana is walking through some Southern woods when he encounters two men, one with a rifle, one with a knife.]
SPIELBERG
[holding the knife] Well well, Indiana Jones. What you doin' in our neck of the woods? [menacing] Now let's see you just drop them pants!
INDY
Drop?
SPIELBERG
Just take 'em right off.
INDY
Uh what do you guys want?
LUCAS
Don't say anything, just do it. And pull off that little ol' biddy. The shirt there, too. [Indy takes off his clothes]
SPIELBERG
Them panties. Take 'em off. [Indy reluctantly removes his briefs. Spielberg turns and throws his knife into a nearby tree and goes after Indy. Indy turns and runs, but Spielberg chases him down and tackles him.] There, boy! I bet you can squeal! I bet you can squeal like a pig! [twists Indy's left ear lobe] Come on, squeal. Squeal now. Squ-squeal! [Indy tries each time, but can't do it] Weeee! Squeal.
INDY
We-eee!
SPIELBERG
Squeal louder. Weeee!
INDY
[at the same time] Weee!
SPIELBERG
Louder louder! Weeee!
INDY
[at the same time] Weee!
SPIELBERG
Louder! Get down there boy! [has Indy on his knees and mounts him. Lucas cackles softly] Get them britches down.
INDY
No...
SPIELBERG
Yes, sir! Come on, squeal! Weeeeee!
INDY
[squeezes his eyes shut] Weee!
SPIELBERG
Weeeeee! [Lucas grunts excitedly] Weeee!
INDY
Hawwww! Hawwww! [Mitch's recollection end and he's crying. Kyle walks up to him and consoles him]
KYLE
It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore. [Mitch begins to bawl and that sends the boys to crying]
[P.F. Chang's, day. The police have fallen back to their original positions]
[P.F. Chang's, inside. Cartman is pacing the floor talking to someone on a mobile phone. No one is near him]
CARTMAN
No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I [POP. Cartman looks around, then drops the phone and runs to the source of the pop. Butters has fired the gun again. Cartman runs up to him] What happened?!
BUTTERS
They uh tr-tried to come in through the roof! They were gonna take the gun.
CARTMAN
Good! Did you kill him? [grins in hope]
BUTTERS
Uh, not exactly.
SWAT OFFICER
[his hands over his bloodied crotch] Ow. Oh, it stings. Ohhhh. [Cartman's eyelids drop halfway and he looks at Butters. Butters looks back and Cartman glances away]
BUTTERS
Well it's not where I aimed, honest.
CARTMAN
Dude...
BUTTERS
I seriously didn't mean it.
CARTMAN
Dude! [Butters looks to his right and down] You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it. [walks off]
BUTTERS
What? Uh where are you going, Eric?
CARTMAN
[near the front doors, turns around and jabs a finger at Butters] You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man.
BUTTERS
By, by my, by myself?
CARTMAN
I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass. [walks out of the restaurant in defeat towards the waiting officers] That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front.
CAPTAIN
Go inside! Move! [the officers rush the restaurant]
[A camera pans from the sky down towards a mansion. Deputies drive up in their cruisers and run to the front door. One of them pounds on the front door]
DEPUTY 1
George Lucas and Steven Spielberg! We have a warrant for your arrest! [there's no response. He looks at another deputy] Break it in! [the second deputy kicks the doors in and leads the other deputies inside. They search the mansion until they reach the library, where they enter and suddenly stop. They all gasp.]
DEPUTY 2
My God. [Lucas is raping a man dressed as a Stormtrooper]
SPIELBERG
Heey, what, what the hell are you doin' here?! [Lucas stops. Moments later, Spielberg and Lucas are led out of the mansion.] You've got nothin' on us! Seven hundred million box office!
LUCAS
Hm this is bullshit!
STORMTROOPER
[runs away like a chicken] Weeee! Weeee!
[Park County Police Station. The boys await any updates about the arrest of Spielberg and Lucas. Yates and Mitch enter the waiting room]
DET. YATES
Boys, we got 'em.
KYLE
What?
DET. YATES
[puts his hands on his hips] Spielberg and Lucas, they were... raping a Stormtrooper when the police broke in.
MITCH
And they found the dead raped bodies of Yoda and Short Round in their closet. [crosses his arms] They'll never be free to do this again. [the boys gather around the officers]
STAN
So, what now?
JIMMY
Do you think things can ever go back to n-n-n, n-no, normal after this?
CLYDE
What do we do?
KYLE
We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.
[P.F. Chang's, day. The diners are all out of the restaurant. Cartman and Butters are in the middle of the street. The police still have their weapons aimed at them]
CAPTAIN
Everyone just stay where you are until we can sort this all out.
FATHER
There's nothing to sort out! These kids need to be put in jail!
CAPTAIN
We're going to search everyone and get statements! And the-
OFFICER 1
Sir! Sir, it's over. They got 'em.
CAPTAIN
Got who?
OFFICER 1
Spielberg and Lucas, they... finally got them for what they did to Indiana Jones, sir. [the captain lowers his gone and suddenly hugs the officer gratefully]
CAPTAIN
[softly] Hohhh, they got them.
OFFICER 2
They got 'em. It's over.
OFFICER 3
It's over. [they hug each other]
FATHER
That means... they'll never be free to rape again.
WAITER
It's over its over. [everyone weeps in relief and cry out "They got 'em." Most of them hug each other]
OFFICER 4
I love you.
OFFICER 5
I love you too. [Cartman, with a cock of his head to the right, motions to Butters to move, and they walk away. As they walk, Cartman begins discarding his costume]
BUTTERS
So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion?
CARTMAN
I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters. [turns aside] You think about it. [turns and walks away.]
BUTTERS
[just stands there for a while] ...Can't believe they put 'em in jail. And I thought that movie was pretty good. [walks off in a different direction]
End of The China Probrem


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Wendy gets in trouble when she threatens to beat up Cartman after school.

script:Breast Cancer Show Ever

[South Park Elementary, day. The kids are in class waiting for the bell to ring. Mr. Garrison enters with some books.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, let's all take our seats. [the kids take their seats as Mr. Garrison approaches his desk and puts the books away] Before we get started today, Wendy Testaburger has asked to share something with the class. Wendy? [Clyde, Kyle, and Bradley take their seats and Wendy walks up to the front of the class. She turns to face the class and looks over at Mr. Garrison]
WENDY
[clears her throat] Thank you, Mr. Garrison. [reads from her notes] Fellow students, October is Awareness Month for one of the leading causes of death among women. A terrible disease that takes the lives of American women every day. I'm talking, of course, about breast cancer. [Cartman tries to contain his laughter, but it comes out anyway. Wendy is mad, but resumes her report.] An estimated one in six women will deal with cancer in their lifetime, and breast cancer is the most common- [Cartman again tries to contain his laughter]
CARTMAN
She said it again. [laughs]
WENDY
Is there a problem?! Because breast cancer isn't funny! Breast cancer is killing people!
CARTMAN
[enjoying his distraction] Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom?
MR. GARRISON
[lowers his head and rubs his right temple] Eric, for the love of Jesus...
WENDY
This is a serious issue, Eric! What you're doing is very offensive!
CARTMAN
Me? You're the one talking about killer titties. [Clyde contains a giggle] Watch out, guys. Wendy said boobs can kill people. [holds his hands out as if grabbing at people] Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy!
BUTTERS
I don't wanna get killed by boobs.
WENDY
Will somebody do something? Every week he gets worse and nobody does anything!
MR. GARRISON
[flatly] Eric, stop being offensive.
CARTMAN
I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison.
WENDY
[irritated] No, you aren't!
CARTMAN
Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone. [the other boys (except Stan and Kyle) laugh. He joins them] Dude, I'm on fire today!
[The school hallway, later. Wendy puts up a Breast Cancer Awareness poster up next to the drinking fountain. Other kids walk here and there, and Cartman appears]
CARTMAN
Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose. [points to the ceiling] Could've swore I heard them coming through the roof. [Wendy turns and glares at him. Cartman talks into an imaginary walkie talkie] "Pssht! Officer! We need to get an APB out on those titties! They're armed and dangerous!" [Wendy suddenly gets in Cartman's face]
WENDY
What is your problem? Breast cancer isn't funny.
CARTMAN
Not at all. [cups his hands again as if they're killer titties] "Wendy, we're gonna get you, Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!"
WENDY
[points to him] You'd better shut up [lowers her right arm] or I'll make you shut up!
CARTMAN
Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy?
WENDY
I'm gonna kick your ass! That's what I'm gonna do!
CARTMAN
Haha, you're gonna kick my ass?
WENDY
That's right, I'm gonna kick your ass!
CARTMAN
[begins to act like a gangbanger] You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down.
WENDY
You think you're tough?
CARTMAN
[takes what looks like a gang pose] Whassup? [takes another one] Whassup?
WENDY
I'll smack the shit out of you!
CARTMAN
Standing right here, let's go, bitch.
WENDY
After school! We fight after school! You got that?!
CARTMAN
You're gonna fight me after school?
WENDY
That's right!
CARTMAN
You're a chick, dude.
WENDY
As soon as that bell rings, we do it outside, you got that?! And you better be there.
CARTMAN
[poses again] Oh, it's on, bitch!
WENDY
You're gonna [jabs at the floor for emphasis] fucking die! [turns and walks away. Cartman strikes a few more poses]
BUTTERS
Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey, everybody! [goes forth to spread the news. He walks by Stan, Kyle, and Bebe] Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school!
STAN
What?
BEBE
Wow. [goes forth to spread the news among the girls. She walks into the girls' bathroom and announces] Wendy and Cartman are gonna fight after school!
GIRLS
[separately] Really? Wow.
[The kindergarten room. Kindergartners are playing with toys when Ike walks in]
IKE
[faltering a bit] Wendy and Cartman are fighting after school. [the other kindergartners jump for joy]
KINDERGARTNERS
Yaaay!
[South Park Elementary, behind the cafeteria. The Goth kids are idling around. Henrietta is reading from her book]
RED
[opens the door and says] Hey, emo kids, Cartman and Wendy are gonna fight after school. [goes back inside and closes the door]
PETE
[flips his hair out of his eyes] Did she just call us emos?
[The cafeteria. Most of the kids are eating lunch. At the center table are eight boys: Kenny, Clyde, Cartman, Butters, Jimmy, Tolkien, Craig, and Jason]
BUTTERS
Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school.
TOLKIEN
She is pissed off.
CARTMAN
She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it.
CLYDE
[taps Cartman twice on the right arm] Hey, check it out. She's totally staring you down. [Cartman leans to the right a bit to get a better view. Craig, Tolkien, and Jimmy look back at the table behind them. Wendy stares back. There are six other girls at her table: Bebe to her right, Lola and Heidi to her left, Esther opposite Bebe, Anne opposite Lola, and Millie opposite Heidi. There's no one seated opposite Wendy, so she has a clear view. Bebe leans over and whispers something to her. Cartman smiles, but the smile turns into worry] She sure seems confident. You should probably go easy on her, dude. You don't wanna put her in the hospital or anything.
CARTMAN
Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass. [Cartman looks at Wendy again, and Wendy stares back. She makes a fist with her right hand and punches the open palm of her left hand.]
JIMMY
Can't go too easy on her though. God forbid she actually gets in a good good punch and... beats ya.
BUTTERS
Yeah, heh. [grabs his milk carton] If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot. [takes a sip of milk through a straw and sets the carton down. Cartman begins to panic, looks around, and looks again at Wendy. Her face becomes the only thing he sees]
[South Park Elementary, after lunch. In the hallway, Wendy puts away her books. Cartman finds her and walks up to her]
CARTMAN
Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?
WENDY
What?!
CARTMAN
[almost whispering] Wendy, I want to apologize, and, um, tell you that-
WENDY
What?
CARTMAN
[takes her aside and whispers] I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry.
WENDY
If you're really sorry, you can say it in front of everyone!
CARTMAN
[takes her aside further and whispers] Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness.
WENDY
No! If you're really sorry, and you wanna apologize to me, then do it in front of everyone.
CARTMAN
[seeing the unwanted attention] Pfft, apologize?! [begins to strike poses] That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh.
WENDY
Yes, you did! You just stood there and said you apologize and you don't want to fight!
CARTMAN
Oh, Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me.
WENDY
I don't want an excuse! I'm going to beat the fucking shit out of you!
CARTMAN
[trying to put up a front] Ohhh, ahhhh... That's funny. You're gonna die, you lesbo. [Wendy goes back to her locker, the other kids go their separate ways. Wendy shuts her locker door and Cartman races up to her again. He whispers] Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight.
WENDY
Get away from me! [walks away]
[Another part of the hallway. The Goth kids are walking along and notice Stan at his locker. They approach him]
MICHAEL
So, everyone's saying there's gonna be a fight between Eric Cartman and your girlfriend.
STAN
I guess so.
PETE
And you're gonna... just let that guy... beat up on your woman? Doesn't that, like, go against your jockey man code or something? [flips his hair]
MICHAEL
Yeah, I don't ever remember AC/DC singing about letting dudes beat up on their girlfriends.
STAN
What am I supposed to do about it? [Craig and Jimmy walk up to him]
CRAIG
Don't worry, Stan, I don't think the fight's even gonna happen. Cartman said that Wendy's already begging him to call it off.
JIMMY
I'll bet she is!
BUTTERS
[walks into view] Ah, I hope not! I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her! [performs some punching moves]
[Another part of the hallway. Wendy's walking along when a door opens to her left]
CARTMAN
[peers out from the doorway] Wendy. Wendy, psst.
WENDY
What?!
CARTMAN
Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick. [Wendy goes into the room Cartman was hiding in, which is a storage room. Once inside, she looks around, taking it all in.] Wendy, you're not gonna believe this. [She turns and glares at him] I just found out my mom has breast cancer. [she glares harder] Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs.
WENDY
You really think that's gonna work on me?!
CARTMAN
Wendy, [pulls out a letter-sized envelope] I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight, then I-
WENDY
You can't bribe your way out of this!
CARTMAN
[puts his left hand up to hold her back] Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy.
WENDY
No, you don't.
CARTMAN
[thinks for a moment] My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs.
WENDY
You don't get it, asshole! [shoves him back a bit] There is nothing you can do to stop this fight! I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone! I am going to shove your ass down your throat and make you eat your underwear!
CARTMAN
Eat my underwear?
WENDY
That's right.
CARTMAN
[walks a few steps away] Okay. Okay, Wendy, I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now.
WENDY
Jesus Christ, do you have no sense of self-respect?!
CARTMAN
No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will.
WENDY
You fucking suck so hard!
CARTMAN
I'll eat my underwear, Wendy. [unzips his pants.] And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us.
WENDY
What are you doing?! [Cartman takes off his underwear]
CARTMAN
I'm committed to peace, Wendy. [begins to swallow his underwear] I want you to see just how humbled I am... [gags]
WENDY
Ew! [looks away]
CARTMAN
[rather muffled] Euugh. Wendy? Look at me, Wendy. [tries one last swallow and succeeds] There. Yeahm.
WENDY
Oh my God!
CARTMAN
So... [turns to face her] are we cool?
WENDY
No!
CARTAMN
I ate my underwear! [advances. Wendy backs up] What the hell do you want from me?! [advances again. Wendy backs up, then runs around Cartman towards the door. He can't turn fast enough to match her] Weh-
WENDY
[opens the door] You are so pathetic!
CARTMAN
[throws himself at her mercy] Wendy it isn't fair! [she runs out of there quickly] I ate my underwear for you! Nooo! [Craig walks by and stops to look in] Yo, what's up dawg?
[The boys' bathroom. Stan enters. Cartman rushes in behind him]
CARTMAN
Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk.
STAN
What?
CARTMAN
You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours.
STAN
Yeah?
CARTMAN
Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch.
STAN
I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you. [moves towards the stalls, but Cartman runs up ahead of him and stops him]
CARTMAN
Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken.
STAN
Really?
CARTMAN
You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said "Well, Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone.", but she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man, you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way- [his gag reflex kicks in and his underwear comes back up his throat and out of his mouth. Stan looks on a bit stunned as Cartman pulls his underwear the rest of the way out, then glances back and forth at his underwear and at Stan] Oh, that's where I put those. [puts his underwear into a back pocket] Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you.
STAN
Dude, there's nothing I can do about it.
CARTMAN
[runs to Stan's left, by the sinks] God, you are such a pussy, Stan! You're such a pussy! When I hurt Wendy, it's gonna be on your fucking head! [his underwear is hanging from his right hand. Cartman notices, then runs out of the bathroom. Stan looks down helplessly]
[South Park Elementary, near the end of the school day. Garrison is at the front of the class giving a lecture]
MR. GARRISON
And so you see, at this point Euripides knew he could not win the battle. [Cartman glances at the clock on the wall: 2:58 p.m. His fingers drum the desk softly as he looks ahead blankly remembering Wendy's words: "I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone!" Then Butters': "If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot."] All right kids, for your homework tonight I want you all to read chapters seven... [Cartman begins to block everything out except Wendy and the wall clock: 2:58 p.m. Wendy's ready to fight.]
BEBE
Kick the shit out of him, Wendy!
JIMMY
As soon as the bell rings, we've gotta get out there and find a good place to watch the fi-fufu-fight. [As the wall clock draws towards 3 p.m. Cartman thinks "There's no way out. She's gonna kick my ass in front of everyone."]
BUTTERS
Almost time. [smiles]
MR. GARRISON
And be ready for a quiz tomorrow morning.
CLYDE
I totally can't see the fight, dude. I have detention after school.
CARTMAN
[a revelation] Detention! That's it! [begins to fidget: "I've gotta get detention, fast!" The minute hand hits 0 and Cartman runs out of his seat towards the front of the class. He gets on Mr. Garrison's desk, shoves the Homework Assignments holder off the desk, lowers his pants, and leaves a nice brown gift on the desk. Mr. Garrison looks at him. The class is stunned as Cartman looks back at Mr. Garrison]
MR. GARRISON
Eric, did you just take a crap on my desk?
CARTMAN
[strikes some gang poses] Whassup? Whassup? Crapped on your desk, dawg. What's up with that? [Wendy's especially shocked. No one says a word until...]
BUTTERS
[cocks his head to his right] Huh.
[The school library. Five kids are in detention there, and Mr. Mackey is looking after them]
MR. MACKEY
Welcome to detention, m'kay? You are here until your parents come and pick you up. Use your time to study. [walks away]
CARTMAN
[puts his feet up on the table and his hands behind his head, certain he's gotten out of the fight with Wendy] Ahhh, sweet.
BUTTERS
[a door opens and his voice is heard] Eric. Hey Eric. [the camera shows Butters motioning Cartman over. Craig and Jimmy are behind him. Cartman looks over at them, then leaves his seat and walks to the door] Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy.
CARTMAN
What?! That's ridiculous!
BUTTERS
But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh, to get out of the fight.
CARTMAN
That's not why I did it.
CRAIG
Then why'd you crap on Garrison's desk?
CARTMAN
[begins to pose] Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that.
BUTTERS
That's what I said. I told everyone outside, "Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!".
CARTMAN
Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude.
CRAIG
Okay, that's good, because we moved the fight to first thing in the morning tomorrow.
JIMMY
Before school starts. Everyone's gonna get there early.
CARTMAN
[shocked] Huh?
BUTTERS
That way it won't matter if you get detention.
MR. MACKEY
[finds him] Eric, get your buns back over here, m'kay?!
JIMMY
Wendy said she'd be here an hour before school starts. See you in the morning, ch-ch-ch-champ! [they walk away and the doors close. Cartman stands there for a moment, then returns to his seat. There's a rapping at the window and Cartman looks over]
WENDY
[outside] Tomorrow morning! You fucking die tomorrow morning! [walks away. Cartman is truly scared]
[Wendy's room, night. She's doing math homework]
MRS. TESTABURGER
Wendy?
WENDY
Yeah?
MRS. TESTABURGER
We need to talk to you, right now. [Wendy leaves her chair and her room, and goes downstairs. Her parents are waiting for her, quite displeased and upset as they confront their daughter] Wendy, have you been bullying kids at school?
WENDY
What? [moves her head slightly] No!
MRS. TESTABURGER
Well, do you want to explain why this little boy's mother had to come talk to us? [Wendy looks and sees Cartman and Liane seated on the sofa. Cartman is sobbing quietly]
MR. TESTABURGER
Did you tell this little boy you were going to beat him up?
WENDY
You don't understand. He said horrible things.
CARTMAN
[whining] The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat me up. [cries into Liane's sweater. She soothes him]
MRS. TESTABURGER
Wendy, no matter what a person says, you don't respond with violence. Haven't we taught you that?
CARTMAN
The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool. [cries into Liane's sweater. She soothes him again]
MRS. TESTABURGER
Wendy, you tell this little boy you aren't going to hurt him.
WENDY
Mom, you don't-
MRS. TESTABURGER
Now, young lady!
WENDY
I'm not going to hurt you.
MR. TESTABURGER
If there is any word of you fighting at school it is over for you, missy! Do you understand?!
WENDY
Yes, sir.
MRS. TESTABURGER
We're so sorry about this, Ms. Cartman.
LIANE
Oh no, thank you so much for your time. [Cartman looks at Wendy, then makes faces at her and sticks both middle fingers up at her. Wendy blushes with fury, but can't do anything now]
MR. TESTABURGER
It really won't happen again.
LIANE
You're very sweet. Thank you again. Come on, muffin. [Cartman stops making faces and looks up at her, then joins her as she walks to the front door]
CARTMAN
Okay, Mommy. Mama, Mama.
[South Park Elementary, before school. The fourth graders are all there, with Cartman front and center. Craig and Butters stand by his side as he faces the road]
BUTTERS
Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.
CARTMAN
Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.
BEBE
Where is she? How come Wendy's not showing up for the fight?
STACY
Here she comes! [everyone looks to their right and see Wendy approaching.]
CARTMAN
[begins to strike poses as Wendy walks by] What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight.
WENDY
[stops and looks at him] You know I can't fight you!
CARTMAN
Why not? You chicken? [begins to strut and cluck like a chicken]
WENDY
I can't fight you because you came crying to my house last night with your mom!
CARTMAN
Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?!
BUTTERS
Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!
CARTMAN
I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo.
BEBE
Come on, Wendy, kick his ass!
WENDY
I can't! [the school bell rings and she walks towards the building] God damn it!
BUTTERS
She chickened out!
OTHER STUDENTS
Aw, man. [they follow her into the building and towards class]
CARTMAN
Told you guys.
STAN
Ugh, I'm glad that's over with.
PETE
[walking by with the other Goths] Yeah, I guess you've dodged a bullet, Galahad.
JIMMY
I always knew deep down that Wendy didn't have any ba-ba-balls.
[Mr. Garrison's class, morning. Clyde is presenting his report before the class]
CLYDE
And so, we must all recycle. Every day. Recycling is important, and it will save our planet, Earth. The End. [the class applauds politely as he takes his seat. Wendy has her face buried in her arms]
MR. GARRISON
Very nice, Clyde. Okay, we have time for one more report before recess. Who'd like to go? [Cartman smiles and silently raises his hand] Okay Eric. [Cartman happily gets out of his seat and goes to face the class]
CARTMAN
[clears his throat] Thank you. My report today is on breast cancer awareness. [Wendy lifts her head up in surprise] I do not believe enough is being done, and, like the victims of breast cancer, there's something I'd like to get off my chest. [stifles a laugh] We all must fight, and hopefully one day, titty cancer will be a distant mammary. [stifles a laugh again]
WENDY
[softly] You unbelievable bastard. You beat me but you won't stop.
CARTMAN
What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey?
MR. GARRISON
Okay, Eric, that's enough, you smartass!
WENDY
Why?! [leaves her seat and walks up to Cartman] Why are you doing this to me?! [grabs him by the collar and shakes him] Why won't you just stop?!
CARTMAN
[cautioning] Wendy, Wendy.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[through the school's PA system] Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office please? Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office.
WENDY
God! [Cartman cackles as she leaves]
[The Principal's office, moments later. Wendy stands before Principal Victoria]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Wendy, I've been hearing rumors about a fight between you and Eric Cartman.
WENDY
No, ma'am, there isn't going to be a fight.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh no? Are you sure?
WENDY
Yes, ma'am.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I see. [gets up and walks to the window and looks out] I've noticed all the things you've done for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Did you know I'm a breast cancer survivor?
WENDY
Ma'am?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I was diagnosed seven years ago. Cancer is... pure evil. It is a fat little lump that needs to be... destroyed. [Faces Wendy] When there is a cancer, you have to "fight" it. You can't reason with cancer, you can't wish it away. Cancer doesn't play by the rules, so neither can you.
WENDY
[thinks a moment] My... parents said that if I fight-
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
And you can't listen to what anybody else tells you. [turns back to the window] You have to be willing to give up everything, because the cancer will [turns back to Wendy] take everything. Do you understand?
WENDY
[the look of determination appears on her face and she makes her hands into fists] Yes, ma'am!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
When you have cancer you fight, because it doesn't matter if you beat it or not. You refuse to let that fat little lump make you feel powerless!
[The hallway. Bebe bursts through some doors and walks down the hall]
BEBE
She's gonna fight! Wendy's gonna fight Cartman right now!
MILLIE
What? [the other kids in the hall turn and everyone heads outside. Other classes hear about this and clear out, chattering all the while. Wendy leads the pack towards the playground. While still in the building she takes off her jacket and throws it aside. On her blouse is a purple prancing unicorn connected to some orange stars by a yellow rainbow]
[The playground. Cartman and the other boys toss the football at each other.]
CARTMAN
Go deep, Craig. [throws the football at Craig, who is off-screen] Not that deep, retard!
BUTTERS
[runs up to Cartman smiling] She's coming! She's coming!
CARTMAN
Butters, get out of here!
BUTTERS
But Wendy's coming to fight you.
CARTMAN
[in disbelief] ...Huh? [Butters turns left and looks at the building, smiling. Cartman looks to his right. The side doors fly open and Wendy walks down the steps spoiling for a fight. The students cheer her on as she turns left and heads for the playground. Some girls trail behind her, Bebe being the first among them.]
CLYDE
Oh boy here we go!
BUTTERS
All right! [other kids chatter around them. The Goth kids find some good spots along the brick wall. Red Goth and Kindergoth sit atop the wall, Tall Goth and Henrietta remain on the ground next to it]
PETE
It's about freaking time. [Wendy walks up to Cartman and they face off]
CRAIG
All right, let's DO IT!
CARTMAN
[wavering] What- what's up? [begins posing] What what's up? [draws close to her and cautions in a whisper] Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you.
WENDY
I don't care! [Cartman looks around. Butters gleefully dances in place waiting for the fight to start]
CARTMAN
Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time.
A GIRL
Shut up and fight! [everyone else joins in the demand. Wendy ties her hair up in a small bun behind her head]
CARTMAN
Alright, fine Wendy! I'll fight you, you big bully! [takes off his jacket and tosses it aside]
[The fighters dance around each other until Wendy lands a right cross. Cartman spins around and falls on his back. Wendy dances around and Cartman stands up, pulling up his pants in the process. Wendy lands two left jabs on Cartman's face, and Cartman finally responds with a right punch. It's strong enough to make Wendy stagger backwards]
KIDS
Ohhhhh!
[Cartman lands another punch on Wendy's face, then continues with a series of alternating punches, forcing Wendy backwards and into the crowd. Cartman lands a punch strong enough to send Wendy into the jungle gym, then continues punching her there. Wendy eventually catches one of his punches and outmuscles him, throwing Cartman into the jungle gym, then driving his face into one of the bars at least twice, and Cartman begins to bleed. The crowd is loving it, cheering her on. Wendy now delivers a long series of alternating punches, forcing Cartman back across the playground and into a hobby elephant. Cartman puts his arms up to deflect the punches, but it's ineffective.]
BUTTERS
Fuck him up, Wendy!
[Cartman finally tosses Wendy off him and throws a punch at her, but she punches faster, making him miss. She then punches him on the right temple, and Cartman wobbles a bit. As he recovers, Wendy delivers the finishing blow: a fierce right cross that turns Cartman's head around and sends his body flying. The scene is frozen in time and the various reactions are shown: Stan, Kyle, Tweek, and Jimmy are cheering Wendy on. Jimmy has his right crutch up in the air, cheering. Butters is swooning while the boys around him just watch the fight. Time speeds up and Cartman falls to the ground, losing a tooth. Wendy kicks him a few times for good measure. She runs out of strength, staggers backwards, and drops down on her ass, exhausted.]
MR. MACKEY
[just arriving] Wendy?
WENDY
[pants and looks back at Mr. Mackey] I'm finished! [gets up and walks away. The girls look at her with astonishment]
MR. MACKEY
Eh, somebod - somebody call the principal! [Cartman gets up, sniffling. Some of the kids begin to leave. Cartman looks around]
CARTMAN
[demoralized] You don't have to say anything. I know how it is. I'm no longer the cool kid. Now you all think I'm a fahahahahahag. [begins to wail] My school life is over 'cause now all the guys don't think I'm coooohoohoohoohoohooooool. [wails some more]
STAN
Dude, we never thought you were cool.
CARTMAN
That's not true! You're just saying that!
KYLE
No, really. We've always thought you suck.
JIMMY
Yeah, nothing's changed. Our opinion of you can't possible go any lower.
CARTMAN
You're all just saying that to make me feel better.
CRAIG
No, it's true. We've always hated you.
BUTTERS
Well, yeah.
CARTMAN
Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you do think I'm cool. [the guys look at each other, sure that Cartman misunderstood them]
CRAIG
[confused] What?
CARTMAN
[seeing a positive side to this somehow] If you're all trying to make me feel better, then you must still like me. Oh, oh phew! Oh, you had me so worried about what you guys were gonna think of me getting beat up by a girl and... it turns out you think I'm cool no matter what. Oh, oh, oh God, what a relief! [jumps up and clicks his feet up in the air] Oh, yay! [jumps up again]
End of Breast Cancer Show Ever


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:While the world struggles to contain an epidemic of epic proportions, the boys find a way to make money off of it.

script:Pandemic

[South Park Mall, day. The boys wait for Kenny, who is coming out of Walstien's with his purchase. Once he arrives, the boys move out into the open mall area and turn left.]
KYLE
I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream?
KENNY
('Cause, dude, i'm gonna shave my balls.)
CARTMAN
Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls?
KENNY
(Because girls like shaved balls.)
KYLE
Girls like shaved balls?
KENNY
(Yes, they do.)
CARTMAN
What girl is gonna see your balls?
KENNY
(I don't know.) [Something grabs Stan's attention and he stops and looks to his right.]
STAN
[pissed off] Oh Jesus, there's another one! [the other boys stop and look. A Peruvian pan flute band plays and draws a small crowd] Another pan flute band! Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately? [the band has a bombo drummer, a siku player, and two charango players]
CARTMAN
Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.
STAN
I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!
KYLE
I think Kenny likes it. [Kenny's groovin' to the music]
STAN
[turns left and leaves] I gotta get home for dinner.
CARTMAN
[follows] Yeah, me too. [Kyle follows Cartman and Kenny keeps dancing.]
[South Park Mall, exterior. The boys exit the mall. Kenny catches up to them. The camera pulls back to reveal another band.]
STAN
[pumping his fists] God!
CARTMAN
Shut up already!
STAN
I'm outta here; see ya guys. [leaves. Kyle and Cartman follow and Kenny dances again]
[Stan's house, night. He walks in through the front door and to the sofa, where he finds Shelly watching TV.]
TV
Tonight, the Travel Channel takes you to London! [the London skyline is shown. A British flag floats across the screen] London has something for everyone! Sights! [a pillar topped by a statue] Theater, and wonderful street performers! [the picture pans down to reveal a pan flute band playing to the crowd]
STAN
They're in London too?
SHARON
Hey, time for dinner guys. [Shelly turns off the TV and joins Stan to the dining room]
[The dining room. Sharon arrives with a bowl of fruit as Stan and Shelly take their seats on either side of the table. Sharon has already set their meals on the table. Today's meal? Potatoes au gratin.]
SHARON
All right kids, dig in.
STAN
Where's dad?
SHARON
[irritated] He's upstairs videotaping your grandfather in the bathtub.
STAN
Why?
SHARON
Because ever since your father got that stupid video camera he thinks he has to film everything the family does.
RANDY
[arrives and starts shooting] All right, here we are. Marsh family gathered for another dinner. [moves around to Stan's side of the table, shooting video all the while]
SHARON
Randy, we have plenty of video of us eating dinner.
RANDY
[points the camera at Shelly] There's Shelly. You excited about eating dinner Shelly?
SHELLY
Turn it off, Dad!
RANDY
[swoops around to Shelly's side to get a better shot] Oh look! Stan's eating a tater-tot! Wave to the camera, Stan. [takes a quick look at the screen attached to the camera, to adjust the aim. A second later and pan flute music is heard. Stan looks around and locates the source. He walks to a front window and sees a pan flute band playing across the street. In front of them is a briefcase full of CDs]
STAN
Oh Jesus Christ! [Randy walks up behind him with the camera]
RANDY
Ohhh neato, it's one of those Peruvian pan flute bands. Stan, go out and stand with them. I can get a shot. [Stan just glances at him]
[Kyle's house, next day. Kenny and Cartman are with him playing Candyland on the living room floor.]
CARTMAN
I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces... [moves Kyle's piece back seven spaces and softly says] ...screw you Kyle. [normal voice] Aaand all right, your turn, Kenny. [tosses the dice to him]
STAN
You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night.
CARTMAN
So?
STAN
So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?
CARTMAN
How much?
STAN
Over two hundred bucks.
KYLE
Two hundred dollars?
CARTMAN
Really? Are you sure?
STAN
Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, we could do that! [the other boys stay quiet]
KYLE
...Become a Peruvian flute band?
STAN
Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer.
CARTMAN
[stands up] Oh my god. We're gonna make so much fucking money you guys.
STAN
Yeah!
KENNY
(Woohoo!)
KYLE
But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments? [the boys give it some thought]
[Craig's house, moments later. The four boys are at the front door ringing the doorbell. The door opens and Craig appears.]
CARTMAN
Craig, dude, how're you doing, bro?
CRAIG
...Fine.
CARTMAN
Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday?
CRAIG
...Yeah.
STAN
Craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars? [Craig stays quiet, so Cartman prevails upon him and enters his house]
[Craig's living room.]
CARTMAN
Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome.
CRAIG
What do you guys want?
KYLE
[enters with Stan and Kenny] Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!
CARTMAN
[applauds] All right Craig! [pats him on the back]
CRAIG
You mean like those guys you see at all the tourist spots?
STAN
There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig: because they make bank! We just need your money to buy instruments and make some CDs.
CARTMAN
And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig.
CRAIG
[assessing the situation] You guys never hang out with me. You never invite me to do stuff. But now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me a hundred dollars.
CARTMAN
Craig, don't be an asshole.
CRAIG
[turns right and walks past Cartman] I'll go get the money. [the boys grin. Stan and Kenny high-five each other.]
[South Park Mall, day, by the fountain. The five boys now gather in their costumes with their instruments. Cartman plays the siku, Stan and Kyle play charangos, Kenny plays on a home-made bombo while Craig has a new stringed instrument.]
STAN
All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam!
CARTMAN
And a one, and a two, and a- [the boys launch into their rendition of "Mary Had A Little Lamb"]
MAN 1
Wow, that's such cultural music.
MAN 2
Very cultural, yes.
CARTMAN
[as the men leave] Por favor, buy our CDs de musica. [in their briefcase are $10 CDs from their band, the Llama Brothers, "Tapas and Moonscapes". Man 1 whips out a fresh $10 bill and buys a CD]
KYLE
Gracias.
WOMAN 1
[walks by and stops to check out the CDs] How cultural. [buys one for herself]
KYLE
This is awesome!
STAN
Ya see, Craig? [another band starts up nearby and Stan steps forward for a better look. The boys look to their right]
CARTMAN
Hey! Heyheyheyheyhey! [leads the other boys to the competing band]
STAN
Hey, you guys can't play here. We were here first. [the other band ignores them and continues playing]
CARTMAN
No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno!
STAN
This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?! [the other band looks at them for a few seconds, then resumes its music, its members grinning.]
KYLE
God damn it!
CARTMAN
No! No es bueno! [grabs the siku and throws it away. The band stops playing. The siku player looks at his empty hands and goes after the siku]
STAN
Come on, guys. [the boys return to their spot and start playing again, but another band begins to play off to their left]
STAN
Jesus Christ!
CARTMAN
No, no es bueno! No trabajar aqui!
[U.S. Department of Homeland Security.]
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Ladies and gentlemen, our nation and our world is facing an economic and ecological crisis of disastrous proportions. I'm talking of course about Peruvian flute bands. [the audience members begin to talk amongst themselves. Chertoff activates the screen behind him, and a world map appears onscreen.] The red dots indicate where the highest concentrations of Peruvian flute bands are. All over the world, wherever there are tourists or shoppers, there are now, on average, 65 Peruvian flute bands per square kilometer. General?
CHIEF AIDE
[walks into view before the screen] France, Japan, and the northeastern United States are currently the hardest hit. Make no mistake: [sticks an index finger up] this is a pan flute epidemic.
SENATOR 1
A pan-demic?
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Three countries in Asia and seven in Europe have already asked for our help in getting rid of their Peruvian flute bands. We will need every resource available to see this through.
SENATOR 2
Excuse me, but... aid other countries?
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Senator?
SENATOR 2
With all due respect we need to be dealing with our own pan flute bands! Let other countries fend for themselves!
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
[starting soft and with rising voice, he leaves the podium and faces the senator] You heartless bastard! This country was founded on beliefs in freedom and integrity! And we will not sit back and do nothing while less fortunate countries are ravaged by Peruvian flute bands! Is that clear?! [the senator collapses back into his seat and begins to cry and Chertoff returns to the podium] As director of Homeland Security, I am taking control of the military until the crisis is contained.
[South Park Mall, day. The third Peruvian flute band continues to play and a woman stops by. She begins to dance. Some helicopters are heard and one appears over the crowd.]
PARATROOPER:
Go, go! [all kinds of law enforcement and military vehicles rush in and surround the mall. Hazmat officers pour out of a Hazmat truck. Inside, the boys now play "Three Blind Mice". A woman stops by and buys a CD. The boys hear some commotion and look over: military troops surround the second band and subdue it]
CARTMAN
Ha! [sticks his right middle finger up] Serves you right, assholes! [behind them the third band is subdued]
SOLDIER 1
One more over here! [the boys are surrounded and subdued]
SOLDIER 2
Let's go! Get 'em out!
SOLDIER 3
Clear out, move! This is a Homeland Security operation, people, let's go!
STAN
Hey, back off!
SOLIDER 3
Make sure all pan flute music CDs are contained! [Hazmat officers collect the CDs slowly, gingerly]
[Stan's house, day. Randy is in the living room taking more video of Sharon and Shelly while they sit on the sofa.]
RANDY
There's Sharon and Shelly. They're watching some television. Wave to the camera, Shelly. [neither female responds to him] What are you watching, guys?
SHARON
[irritated] The news.
RANDY
[draws even closer to her] Huh?
SHARON
[irritated] We're watching the news.
RANDY
[turns the camera towards the TV] That's the TV in our living room, still showing commercials right now. [moves around to Shelly's side] What do you think about the television, Shelly? [Shelly remains quiet as Randy glances at the TV] Oh, the news is starting! [starts taking video of that]
[CNN Breaking News]
ANCHORMAN TOM
The government efforts to stop the Peruvian flute band crisis are now in their third day. [Times Square in New York is shown, with more bands being arrested] In cities all over the world [a shot of St. Louis] flute bands have been removed and quarantined. [a shot of Seattle] But more may still be out there. Homeland Security's requesting that [a graphic appears that says pretty much the following] if you see a Peruvian flute band, do not approach it. Mark down the flute band's location, and do not, under any circumstances, buy their CDs. [the reporter reappears onscreen] The flute bands that have been contained are being taken to a quarantined area in Miami
[Peruvian Flute Band Internment Camp, brought to you by the Department of Homeland Security, in Miami. More Peruvian bands join the already large crowd of bands there. The boys are among them.]
STAN
Eh-excuse us. Hello? [spots a soldier in one of the watchtowers] Uh excuse me. Sir? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. Can, can I talk to you for a minute?
KYLE
Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?
GUARD
Get back! I'm not buying any of your damned CDs!
STAN
No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian-
GUARD
I said I'm not buying any God damned CDs today, you got that?! I'm sick of it!
A MUSICIAN
[walks into view] Señor? Comprar CD la musica? ["Sir? Do you want to buy our music CD?"] [" [the soldier kills him with a few blasts from his automatic rifle]
KENNY
(Jesus Christ, he fucking shot that guy!)
[Peruvian Flute Band Internment Camp, that night. The Peruvian flute bands play, and trashcans have been set ablaze to keep them warm. The camera pans to the boys, who sit around a small campfire moping around]
CRAIG
"Hey, Craig. You know that money your grandma gave you for your birthday? How would you like to invest in a Peruvian flute band? You can double your money in one afternoon. Come on, Craig, don't be an asshole." [some alarms go off for a few seconds, then fall silent as Chertoff appears above the crowd with a blond translator to his left]
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Attention Peruvian flute bands
TRANSLATOR
Atencione bandas de flauta Perú.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
We appreciate your cooperation and patience.
TRANSLATOR
Cooperacion y peciencia es apreciado.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Tomorrow you will be boarding ships...
TRANSLATOR
Mañana sera el embarque de barcos...
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
...which will take you to Guantanamo Bay.
TRANSLATOR
...que la lleva a viajar Guantanimo.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
There you will spend the rest of your lives.
TRANSLATOR
Donde pasar el resto de sus vidas. Gracias! [they turn and head inside. The Peruvian flute bands break up behind the boys and head back to their business]
KYLE
Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!
STAN
Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.
[The Marsh house. Craig's parents are seated on the sofa. Kyle's parents and Sharon are standing.]
SHARON
Please, Mr. and Mrs. Tucker, our boys were last seen hanging out with your son Craig. Do you have any idea where they could've gone?
LAURA
No, I'm telling you. This isn't like Craig at all. I'm really worried.
THOMAS
You've checked with the police?
GERALD
Nobody know anything. It's li-it's like the boys just vanished!
SHARON
None of the other kids have seen them since a- [notice Randy taping them] Randy, will you put that thing down?! What is wrong with you?! Our son is missing!
RANDY
Hey, I'm worried about him too, Sharon.
SHARON
Well then stop being an idiot and help!
THOMAS
Maybe the boys all ran away. Were any of your boys upset about anything?
GERALD
All we know is they were seen hanging out with Craig and now they're gone.
SHEILA
That's exactly why I told Kyle not to hang around that boy.
LAURA
What is that supposed to mean?
SHARON
To be honest, Mrs. Tucker, we think Craig is bad influence on our boys.
LAURA
[quiet for a few seconds] Now wait just a minute!
SHARON
I'm just saying that your son has some problems a-
THOMAS
Like every kid doesn't have some problems!
SHEILA
Obviously Craig has gotten them into some kind of trouble.
LAURA
Oh my God
THOMAS
This is ridiculous!
RANDY
[filming the argument] Ohhh this is good!
GERLAD
That's not ridicul-
[Peruvian Flute Band Internment Camp, day. Michael Chertoff stands among some soldiers and DHS officials]
SOLDIER 4
Sir, good news! Looks like we did it. Every major city is reporting zero Peruvian flute bands. We got 'em all! [other soldiers cry out "All right! We did it!"]
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Calm down people, we still have work to do! We have to take out the place these flute bands came from so they never come again!
OFFICIAL 1
We don't know where they came from, sir. We... we've been researching, but we... can't figure it out.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Well think about it, idiot! Where else would "Peruvian" flute bands come from? [everyone else mulls it over]
OFFICIAL 1
Hmm...
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
The country is in the name!
OFFICIAL 2
No. Sir, we checked the entire map. There isn't a country called Peruvian anywhere.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Not Peruvian, retards, Peru! It's right here! [points to the country on a world map]
OFFICIAL 3
Peh-roo.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Now I want a plan in place to take out Peru once and for all!
OFFICIAL 1
Is that really necessary, sir? It seems a little extreme.
SOLDIER 2
Yeah.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Peruvian flute bands will never stop annoying us [pounds his right fist onto his left palm] unless they are stopped at the source!
CHIEF AIDE
Sir, you'd better come quick. One of the pan flute bands was caught trying to escape.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
[grabs Official 2 by his tie] See? [lets go and leaves] God damn it! [they higher officials walk out behind him]
[The interrogation room, moments later. Chertoff and his chief aide are grilling the boys, who are seated in a row behind a table. Two top officials stand out of the way nearby]
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
[holds the CD the boys were carrying] The Llama Brothers: Tapas and Moodscapes.
STAN
This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Right. You just play pan flute music at the mall and sell CDs of you with a llama, but you're not a Peruvian flute band.
STAN
We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money.
KYLE
We just wanna go home.
KENNY
(Sir, please, I'm supposed to get laid for the first time on Saturday.)
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Which tourist location were they playing at?
CHIEF AIDE
An outdoor mall in Colorado.
KYLE
Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States.
STAN
We we speak English!
CARTMAN
And we're white.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Let me talk to you guys out here. [takes his chief aide and the two other officials into the observation room and closes the door.] Well what do you think?
CHIEF AIDE
I don't know what to make of it sir. It's like nothing I've ever seen before. Clearly they are a Peruvian flute band and yet they... aren't. They play pan flute music like the others, but they talk and act like ...one of us.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
I agree. They're obviously some kind of... hybrid.
OFFICIAL 1
A hybrid? Ah how is that possible?
CHIEF AIDE
Perhaps a Peruvian flute band mated with one of our females. Who knows?
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Well however they came to be, they're about the only piece of good luck we've had. [walks to the one-way window]
OFFICIAL 1
Sir?
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
If they are the hybrid we're talking about, [puts his left arm up high against the window and presses his head against that] then they could be our way of taking out Peru once and for all.
[The interrogation room. The boys wait for the officials to return]
CRAIG
Do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you? [the other boys look at each other] Because you're always doing stuff like this. You're always coming up with some stupid idea to do something, and then it backfires, and then you end up in some foreign country, or in outer space or something. That's why no one likes hanging out with you guys.
CARTMAN
You're being extremely negative, Craig. [Chertoff and the others return]
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
[approaches the boys] All right, here's the deal: Maybe you are on our side and maybe you aren't, but if you help us... we'll get you home.
STAN
Help you how?
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
[walks around the table and the boys] You're able to walk amongst the Peruvian flute bands. They see you as one of them. We are going to send you to their Capital.
CRAIG
Can we please just go home, sir?
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
[drops the CD onto the table] We still don't know whose side you're on! You do this, and we'll know! You leave for Peru in the morning.
KYLE
No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru! [almost falls apart, but Stan grabs him and holds him in place]
STAN
Kyle, calm down.
KYLE
You know I can't go there, Stan!
STAN
One of our friends was raped in Peru. It was very traumatic. [the officials look at each other]
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
You don't have a choice! Either you go to Peru, or you get locked up forever with the other flute bands.
[Peruvian Flute Band Internment Camp, Paruvian flute bands are crowded near the fence staring outside with one solder in front of the fence.]
SOLDIER 3
Thompson, can you come over here? [the translator from earlier walks up to him] The flute band players won't shut up about something and I can't understand them.
MUSICIAN 2
¡Por favor! ¡No podemos ir! ¡Estamos aquí para proteger a ustedes! ["Please! We cannot go! We're here to protect you!"]
MUSICIAN 3
Sí. [Yes.]
OTHER MUSICIANS
Sí. No podemos ir. Si, protectores. ["Yes. We can't go. Yes, protectors."]
THOMPSON
They're saying something like, "You can't send us away. We are the protectors."
SOLDIER 3
Protectors from what?
MUSICIAN 2
¡La muerte peluda! ¡La muerte peluda! ["The furry death! The furry death!"]
SOLDIER 3
What does that mean?
THOMPSON
I think he said, "the furry death"?
MUSICIAN 2
¡La muerte peluda! ¡La muerte peluda! ["The furry death! The furry death!"]

ANNOUNCER
[gruffly] This is CNN.
ANCHORMAN TOM
The last of the Peruvian flute bands have successfully been eradicated from every part of the world. Paul Harris is at the shopping promenade and Paul, pretty nice not having any Peruvian flute music there, I suspect.
PAUL HARRIS
Really welcome silence, Tom. There hasn't been a Peruvian pan flute band in sight for days now, and everyone is really enjoying the peace. The world can breathe a collective sigh of relief now as we thank the- [a low moan is heard and a heavy footfall shakes the ground. The camera looks around for the source of the shaking] What the?! [an explosion has the camera focus on the resulting burst of fire]
WOMAN 2
[voice only] Oh my Gohhhd!
WOMAN 3
[voice only] Ohmigod! [a police car flies through the air from the direction of the blast.]
PAUL HARRIS
Jesus Christ! [the police car lands between him and the water fountain upside down. Harris ducks down]
SHOPPER
AAAAHHH!! [Harris gets up again and looks at the damage]
PAUL HARRIS
There's, there's something else here, it's... [the camera switches to the police car again] It's not a Peruvian flute band, it's a... Oh my God what is that thing?! [points to the sky, but the camera doesn't follow it]
ANCHORMAN TOM
Paul Paul, what do you see?
PAUL HARRIS
It's furry! It's very furry! [the transmission flickers, then fades out]
ANCHORMAN TOM
Okay obviously something different has uh shown up a-... Did he say "furry"? [instantly another heavy footfall rattles the CNN newsroom and shorts out several monitors. Reporters and other worker scatter around] Okay uh we're we're experiencing some uh- [a second footfall shuts down the newsroom entirely and tilts the camera one way, but it's still airing. A third footfall tilts the camera in another direction and the roof is peeled back. A shaft of light strikes Tom's head as he looks up into the night] My God what is that thing?! [a fourth footfall tilts the camera down and in still another direction. Tom is lifted into the air...] AAAHHH!! [...and the camera finally stops transmitting, leaving behind an image of static, then nothing.]
[The sky, night. A military airplane take to the air. Inside, the four boys sit on chairs in one side of the cabin. The pilot peeks in and then walks towards them.]
PILOT
All right, we're about 800 kilometers from Peru. There'll be a truck to take you inside the border where you're briefed on mission specifics. [walks backwards into the cockpit and closes the door. The boys say nothing for a while]
CRAIG
Was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a Peruvian flute band that any of you said "Hey, you know? This plan might backfire." [no answer] No, that never occurred to you. Because you guys are jerks, and you never learn from your mistakes, and that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes.
KYLE
That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they?
STAN
Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.
CRAIG
[testing] I'm being a dick?
STAN
[firmly] Yes!
CRAIG
You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the country of Peru, and I'm being a dick?
CARTMAN
There's no talking to this guy.
STAN
All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that?
CRAIG
That would be great. Thank you.
KYLE
This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?
KENNY
(Because they're trying to take over the world?)
KYLE
Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here.
[Stan's house, night. Sharon is talking to someone on the phone]
SHARON
Please, I don't know where else to turn. The police haven't been any help, ugheh, I think our boys might really be in trouble this time. Yes. Yes. Please, check and call me right back. Thank you. [*click*She notices that Randy videotaped the call] Randy I swear to God if you don't put that thing away...!
RANDY
Sharon, you're gonna be really glad I have all this footage of the family someday.
SHARON
[the scene continues with Randy's POV] I mean it Randy that's enough!! You don't have to videotape every single-!! [a low moan is heard. She stops and looks around, getting more afraid with each moan]
RANDY
What the hell was that? [a heavy footfall shorts out the house]
SHARON
Oh my God.
RANDY
Something's going on outside! Stay, stay here! [turns around and runs out]
SHELLY
[coming down the stairs] What's going on, Dad? [Randy wheels around to see her]
RANDY
Get back to your room, Shelly! [turns around and goes to the front door. He opens it and sees people running all over the street in a panic, He then points his camera at some helicopters overhead]
[On the street. Randy steps out of the house and runs into Mr. Garrison.]
RANDY
What's going on?
MR. GARRISON
They're all over the place!
RANDY
What are?!
MR. GARRISON
They're really furry! [runs off. Randy joins the others out on the street. He hears someone above him and points the camera to catch a man falling from the sky. A chunk of his body has been bitten off, exposing ribs on the right side]
RANDY
What did that?! [moves his camera off the body and sees more people running. A giant guinea pig appears among the panicked residents] What is that thing?! [someone taps him from behind and he turns around to see who it is. Officer Barbrady appears on camera]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Mr. Marsh, you have to move! It isn't safe to be here! [a house blows up and Randy starts running, his camera aimed at his feet. He aims his camera forward again and sees people rounding the corner and running his way. Linda Stotch is one of them.]
LINDA
AAAAAAAAH!! [Two heavy footfalls follow and a car flies through the air from left to right. Another giant guinea pig walks along the crossroad towards the mangled car]
RANDY
Oh my Gohhhd!
STEPHEN
[getting Randy's attention] Go go go go back the other way! [Randy runs back along the street, the camera again aimed at his feet. He stops and aims the camera at himself]
RANDY
[out of breath] Oho, oh God, oh God, oh God. [pants] Oh God. [pants] I'm [pants] I'm so [pants] Startled.
A WOMAN
[voice only] Oh my Gohhhd! [Randy stops panting and looks to his left.]
RANDY
HAAA! [A growl is heard and all of a sudden his camera goes dark.]
[The Department of Homeland Security Headquarters. Michael Chertoff is back in the auditorium looking at the world map.]
CHIEF AIDE
[entering] Sir? We've got a bigger problem.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
[smiles knowingly] Oh? And what might that be?
CHIEF AIDE
New reports are coming in from cities all over the world. Word of massive destruction and death by what ap-pear to be... [Chertoff turns around and smiles at him]
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
[hiding a folder behind his back] Guinea pigs?
CHIEF AIDE
[softly] Yes sir. How did you know?
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
You were so close to figuring it all out, Davis, did you know that?
DAVIS
Sir?
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
I really thought you had me in Miami, but you just couldn't quite put the pieces together.
DAVIS
You... You... knew this was going to happen.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Oh, this is only the beginning, Davis, and I can't let you interfere. [his face becomes monstrous. His tongue shoots out and stabs Davis in the right eye. Davis goes into convulsions for a long time, but finally dies. Chertoff releases his tongue's grip and it goes back into his mouth] Sorry my friend, but I've worked too hard to make all this happen. The pan flute bands are on their way to their deaths, the guinea pigs are rising, and the only person who could have stopped all this... is on his way to the middle of nowhere. [he looks at the folder he had behind his back. Attached to it is a picture... of Craig]
End of Pandemic

synopsis:Giant guinea pigs are attacking cities all over the world. The boys have the key that will save everyone from the onslaught but they're stranded in the Andes Mountains.

script:Pandemic 2: The Startling

[Some recaps of last week's episode. Randy filming scared residents running by, a cameraman filming a police car being thrown into South Park Mall]
[YOU ARE NOT MEANT TO SEE]
SHELLY
What's going on, Dad? [cut to the fallen man with a chunk of flesh missing from his left side]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Mr. Marsh you have to move! It isn't- [cut to the power going out at CNN, then to an explosion, then to people running away from something, then the giant guinea pigs appearing, then to Linda Stotch panicking and running, then to a second car flying across an intersection, then to Randy looking into his camera]
RANDY
[out of breath] Oh God. [pants] I'm- [pants] I'm so- [pants] Startled. [the camera cuts out on him] ARRRGH!
[PANDEMIC 2
THE STARTLING]
[A picture of Craig appears as a Peruvian pan flute version of "Three Blind Mice" plays in the background]
CRAIG
My name is Craig Tucker. Last week was my birthday. [a picture of him, his family, and a grandmother standing behind a cake. Ten candles are on the cake. Balloons are all around and a "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" banner is above them] My Grandma gave me a check for a hundred dollars. [a picture of that is shown] I was sooo happy. But then, four kids from school came to my house [a shot of the four boys in Craig's living room] and said I should use my hundred dollars to invest in becoming a Peruvian flute band. [a shot of the newly-formed band, the Llama Brothers] They promised I would double my money in one afternoon. [soldiers swoop in and apprehend them] But the government arrested us along with all the other Peruvian flute bands and took us to an internment camp in Miami. [the camp is shown, followed by the five boys sitting in the interrogation room] We begged to go home, but instead the government told us they were sending us to Peru. [a shot of a DHS cargo plane with the boys sitting on the ground near it.] And so that is now why I'm in Peru. If I die, let it be known that it is because four guys I don't even like from school lied to me and took my birthday money. [he sits on one suitcase, Kenny on another. The whole group is in a mountainous region of Peru]
STAN
We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea!
KYLE
Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed?
CPT. TAYLOR
I don't get it. They said the military would meet us here.
CPT. GABRIEL
This is where they told us to land. Can you get through to Washington?
CPT. TAYLOR
I'm trying. [...and gets through]
A VOICE
This is Connor in Washington.
CPT. TAYLOR
Hey, Connor, the place that Homeland Security told us to start the operation, there, there's nobody here to meet us. It's like they sent us to no man's land.
CONNOR
Jesus they're everywhere!
CPT. TAYLOR
What are everywhere?
CONNOR
...so furry! They're attacking... every city... ha- people dying... Ha-... guinea pigs... all over! Agh.
STAN
Guinea pigs?
CONNOR
Can't stop them! Need to get... out... ergh. I just ate... a peanut... Agh peanut now stuck... in throat... Urgh shouldn't eat peanut... when scared. [a few more groans and communication is cut]

I've got the video camera. Got it turned on again. [points it to himself] Okay. This is... Randy Marsh... I'm shooting this video of myself. Twenty minutes ago some... huge creatures attacked our town... Still chaos out the window... [aims it at the living room windows, through which you still see people running around in panic, then aims it at himself again] I barely made it back to the house. Sharon is here with me, [moves the camera just enough to show Sharon] and there's Shelly. [Sharon is protecting her somewhat] Wave to the camera, Shelly.
SHARON
Randy, will you put down that camera? We need to figure out what to do.
RANDY
I don't know what to do. I'm so startled.
SHARON
[stands up] We have to see what the news is saying. [walks over to the TV and turns it on. A shot of New York City appears.]
REPORTER
[off camera] This is a shot of New York City where the... giant guinea pigs have also attacked.
SHARON
Guinea pigs?
REPORTER
Reports of attacks are coming in from major cities all over the world.
RANDY
Jesus, this thing is worldwide? [two giant guinea pigs suddenly come into view. The camera moves to a group of soldiers firing at a third guinea pig.]
SHARON
Look at that thing! Randy, what are we gonna do? [Randy focuses the camera on her. A loud thump is heard, knocking Randy off balance. He regains it and makes sure Sharon and Shelly are fine, then turns to the source of a growl: a giant guinea pig has broken through a wall and is now looking at the family]
RANDY
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my Gohhhd!
SHARON
Go Randy, run! [Sharon takes Shelly out the front door. Randy follows them]
RANDY
Gotta get out!
[The Peruvian jungle high up in the Andes. The group is still in the makeshift landing strip. Cpt. Taylor is still trying to get a connection through the plane's radio, which is next to him outside]
CPT. TAYLOR
Michaels, Harrison, anybody? [no response] Nothing. LSAT is down and no answer at RCU. Whatever is going on out there is huge.
STAN
[steps forward] Ah all right, just let me get this straight: the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government.
CPT. TAYLOR
...Yes, that was the order.
KYLE
And that makes sense to you?
CPT. TAYLOR
Nope, not at all.
CPT. GABRIEL
Actually, the whole rounding up of the pan flute bands didn't make sense to any of us either.
STAN
None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?!
CPT. TAYLOR
You don't understand. The plan was to have a refueling truck meet us here. We don't have enough gas to fly any place.
CRAIG
Oh, that's awesome.
KYLE
So we've gotta find another way out of here.
CPT. TAYLOR
It's starting to look that way, yeah.
[The Peruvian jungle, later. The two pilots lead the boys through it.]
CRAIG
This is fun. Let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle. It just keeps getting better and better.
CARTMAN
You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig.
KENNY
(Yeah!)
CARTMAN
Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.
CPT. GABRIEL
Look at that: no lights on, nothing. It's like, humans have never been to this part of Peru. [the camera zooms out and at least eight giant burrowing holes appear before them.]
[U.S. Department of Homeland Security, strategic room. Chertoff looks at a map as an official briefs him on the current situation]
TOP OFFICIAL
More guinea pigs seem to be moving in from all directions. We checked on Wikipedia and found out that guinea pigs are from the Andes Mountains, here. [points to the mountains]
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
What about the pan flute bands? Are they on their way to Guantanamo Bay?
OFFICIAL 1
...Sir, we believe we have bigger problems right now than pan flute bands.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Have they been loaded onto the boats or not?!
OFFICIAL 2
No sir. We diverted all the resources away from the pan flute bands to deal with the guinea pigs.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
That was an order! [pounds both fists into the map table.] The pan flute bands were to be put on boats to Guantanamo last night! [pounds both fists into the map table again.] I am still in charge here! I want those pan flute bands on the boats to Guantanamo!
SOLDIER 4
Yes sir. I don't see why you have to yell at people. [turns around and walks out sobbing]
[South Park, night. Randy's got his camera rolling. Sharon and Shelly stand behind a door so they are not seen from the street.]
RANDY
Hey we're down in... Main Street now and... [a tank rolls by] Wah? Oh, ohh, look at that. [the tank fires a cannon, but the giant guinea pig is unaffected by it.] Ohhh!
SHARON
[whispering] Where do we go, Randy?
RANDY
We've got to get out of town. Go through that way. [points, and Sharon takes Shelly out the door and to the left. Randy follows them, but something catches his eye: a giant guinea pig is chewing a man's left arm off. The man is trying to get away by holding on to a light post with his right hand.]
MAN
Geow, my arm! MY ARM! [the guinea pig pulls him away from the light post and dangles him]
RANDY
Oh Jesus!
SHARON
Randy, run! [the man falls to the ground as the rest of his arm is bitten off. Randy runs]
RANDY
[the camera is aimed at his feet again] Okay. We're running now. [aims the camera at Sharon and Shelly before him] There's Sharon and Shelly running. Wave to the camera, Shelly!
SHELLY
[glances back] Dad! [Randy moves the camera around to catch another mauling, then aims it back at Sharon and Shelly]
RANDY
[Sound of a explosion is heard. Randy points the camera to it and sees a giant guinea pig which starts moving towards him] Ahhh! [Before them is an empty bus with an open door] In there, in there! [Sharon and Shelly go on up the steps and into the bus. Randy follows them in] Oh God, oh God I'm so startled. Are you startled, Sharon?
SHARON
Randy, put down that c-! [something big crashes into the bus. Randy gets his bearings and he sees a giant guinea pig outside the bus looking in]
SHELLY
It's gonna kill us!
SHARON
[soothing her down] Just stay down, Shelly. It can't come in here. [another guinea pig jostles the bus]
RANDY
Hold on, hold on, I need to get a shot of it from outside. [runs down the aisle and outside]
SHARON
Randy? Where are you going? [Randy stops a moment and then continues, moving away from the bus. He stops and aims his camera at the bus. Two giant guinea pigs climb up to the roof]
RANDY
Here we see a view from outside the bus.
SHARON
Randy! [Randy runs back into the bus and towards his girls] What the hell are you doing?
RANDY
I got a... really good shot of it, Sharon. [another jostle follows and the camera shuts off again]
[The Peruvian jungle. The pilots and the boys continue walking. Cpt. Gabriel tries to navigate the jungle using a map of Peru]
CPT. GABRIEL
I don't know, Lemsky. This entire area of Peru isn't even charted on the maps.
CPT. TAYLOR
This whole valley is strange. Just look at the size of that fruit. [they pass by giant fruit] Ain't that a peach? And how do you like them apples?
CPT. GABRIEL
Take a look at this! They look like... beehive combs.
CPT. TAYLOR
Oh my God.
STAN
Dude, what is this place?
CPT. TAYLOR
It's like... an unknown valley that time forgot, where everything grows huge.
CRAIG
That's a shock. I decided to follow you guys, and now I'm in the land of the giants lost world.
STAN
[turns right and walks towards Craig] Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice!
KYLE
Yeah. Stuff just happens.
CRAIG
Stuff just happens.
KYLE
That's right!
CRAIG
You just wind up being sent by the government to take down the city of Lima only to wind up in the land of the giants lost world.
CARTMAN
That's right.
CRAIG
You know when stuff happens to most kids? They fall off their bikes. They get in fights with their parents. They get swindled out of their birthday money.
CPT. TAYLOR
Look, wherever we are, I think we'd better keep moving.
KENNY
[suddenly points] (Hey, look out!) [some brown saliva lands on Cpt. Gabriel's right shoulder, then he's chomped up, then Cpt. Taylor is chomped up too. One of Cpt. Gabriel's arms falls back to the ground. Boys start running where they came for]
CPT. TAYLOR
Ohhh stop it, make it stohhhp!
[Somewhere in South Park, night. Randy starts his camera up again and begins filming]
RANDY
All right, all right. Here's Sharon and Shelly on the roof of Best Buy. We, we run up here to get off the streets. We found the Stotch family hiding up here also. There's Chris and Linda, and their son Butters.
BUTTERS
Hello, heh.
LINDA
What is that? Chris, what is that?
RANDY
That's a that's a, that's a new sound. [the sound of bees gets louder and louder as Randy moves his camera around]
STEPHEN
Oh God look!
SHARON
Those aren't guinea pigs.
STEPHEN
Get off the roof! [the group quickly heads for the stairs.]
RANDY
Go! Go go go go go! [the group goes down the stairs and Randy closes the roof door behind him.] Oho, Oh God, we're going down the stairs now. Okay, getting downstairs. [they reach Best Buy's main floor. As they go towards the entrance two televisions on the television aisle show a news report]
AN ANCHORMAN
And we are now getting word of giant bees. The giant bees have been seen in the U.S. and Europe.
RANDY
Oh no! Oho oho. [they exit the store]
TOWNSMAN 1
Get away, there's bees everywhere! [The group runs across the parking lot with everyone else] There's another one right there! [Randy looks to his right with his camera and a giant guinea bee stands there not doing much.]
RANDY
Oh, my god!! [Another bee appears in front of him, and to his left, a man is on the ground with a giant stinger stuck into his chest.]
TOWNSMAN 2
It stung me! It stung me! [Randy looks behind now, seeing the Best Buy store and a giant guinea bee. He keeps running.]
RANDY
Whoa, that startled me! That was really startling!
[The Andes jungle. The boys are left to their own devices, so they continue walking]
KYLE
Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.
CARTMAN
Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way. [points to his left]
KENNY
(I think we're fucked!)
KYLE
Hey, hey, look at this. [points to his right. The other boys look. A small temple is shown with two statues, one on either side of the entrance. The boys approach it]
CARTMAN
What is it?
KYLE
I don't know. It's old.
STAN
Let's see what's in there.
CRAIG
"Let's see what's in there." That's why you guys get into these situations. Because when you come across a spooky, ancient ruin, you say "Let's see what's in there."
STAN
It might be a way out, Craig!
CARTMAN
Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants! [the boys enter]
[Inside the temple. Stan lights the way with the torch]
KYLE
Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries
KENNY
(Yeah. Totally.)
STAN
You guys, look at this. [the others go to the wall Stan is looking at] It's a wall of ancient drawings. [first drawing is a group of four men playing instruments]
KYLE
Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band.
STAN
I know, a-and look. [second drawing is the flute band playing music, which is driving away two giant guinea pigs]
CARTMAN
Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs?
KYLE
Oh no way! Look! [a flute band is shown behind bars] The pan flute band's put in prison, just like what happened. [the boys look up and to the right]
STAN
And then the guinea pigs killing people. [they look a little lower] And then... [a boy holds a staff against a giant guinea pig]
CARTMAN
Dude, it's Craig!
CRAIG
What?
KYLE
That is Craig. [Craig comes forward to look for himself. The other boys back away]
STAN
Dude, Craig, what's goin' on?
CRAIG
I have no idea.
CARTMAN
Well do you mind tellin' us what you're doing on an ancient Incan wall, Craig?
CRAIG
I don't know.
[U.S. Department of Homeland Security, strategic room. Chertoff sits behind the table with his staff and some soldiers looking on]
TOP OFFICIAL
There is now word of huge beehives forming in cities across the U.S. and Canada. Europe and China are reporting deaths by guinea pigs in the tens of thousands.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
And how are the efforts to contain all this going?
OFFICIAL 3
[steps forward] It's bad, sir. It seems we have no way of stopping it; we've lost complete control. [Chertoff laughs maniacally]
TOP OFFICIAL
Uh, sir?
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Ah I'm sorry, I just thought of a funny joke.
OFFICIAL 1
Oh, a-hah.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
All right, get the jets ready. I need to get to Machu Picchu.
SOLDIER:
Uh, Machu Picchu, sir?
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Yes, I need to be taken to Machu Picchu! Have you lost your hearing?!
OFFICIAL 1
But S-sir, what could possibly be at Machu Picchu to help the-
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Am I in charge or not?! [silences them all]
[Inside a supermarket in South Park. Randy prepares his camera again]
RANDY
We're in the [pants] grocery store now. Some of the survivors here uh.
SHARON
Can we get out through the highway?
SOLDIER 5
The highway is unreachable; there's guinea rats all over it.
MR. GARRISON
Guinea rats?
RANDY
[almost hyperventilating] I'm so startled.
MR. GARRISON
What do you mean "guinea rats"?
SOLDIER 5
Look, there are guinea pigs, but there's also guinea bees, guinea rats. I've even seen some guinea spiders out there.
SHARON
Randy, will you stop doing that?! [Randy continues to film her, then jumps to the next speaker, then the next one...]
STEPHEN
Look, I, I think we need to find a way out under the city.
MR. GARRISON
In the sewers? Can't be safe down there.
RANDY
[walks away with the camera, rather scared] Oh God, what are we gonna dooo?
A WOMAN
Oh my God!
TOWNSMAN 3
Something's inside the store!
TOWNSMAN 4
Guinea rabbits! They're inside! [facing him is a guinea pig in a blue rabbit outfit]
TOWNSMAN 5
God they're everywhere!
TOWNSMAN 6
Help me! [Randy finds out who's screaming for help] Help... me... [it's a man who's practically been bitten in half]
TOWNSWOMAN 1
Travis! No!
RANDY
You can't help him!
STEPHEN
There's something over there!
TOWNSMAN 7
It's a guinea bear!
RANDY
No, it's a guinea mouse, stupid! [he lowers the camera as he runs, then raises it again to focus on a woman]
TOWNSWOMAN 2
Kill me!
SHARON
Randy, the storeroom, we've gotta get to the storeroom! [he follows the survivors into the storeroom, and the door closes behind them a few seconds later. There is no light in the room]
SHELLY
Mom, I can't see.
RANDY
It's okay, Shelly. Daddy's gonna turn on night vision. [night vision mode is on] There. There. Okay. Gaaah! [the others gasp]
SHARON
What what what what?
RANDY
Nothing, sorry. I just startled myself. Gaaah! [camera out]
[Stan is still guiding the others through the Incan temple, and the sound of running water is soon heard]
STAN
Let's head over this way, guys.
KYLE
Hear that? It sounds like water.
CARTMAN
Yeah, it's coming from up there.
STAN
Wow. [they find themselves in a massive complex full of statues whose mouths or noses serve as waterfall fountains. Several suspension bridges connect the mouth of the statue they're in to the other statues]
CARTMAN
Dude, that's awesome.
STAN
All right, let's go. [Craig doesn't move]
CRAIG
No.
STAN
Wait, whattaya mean no?
CRAIG
I'm not following you guys any more.
STAN
Dude, we we have to go check this out.
CRAIG
Why?
STAN
'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is.
CRAIG
Every time bad things happen, you guys end up putting yourselves deeper into the middle of it, because "that's just the way it is."
STAN
Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe!
CRAIG
I don't care. I've decided that I'm done. I am choosing not to be a part of this anymore.
KYLE
How do you do that?
CRAIG
It's easy. Watch. [turns around and walks back out the way they came in. He makes his way back to the temple's entrance, and the boys follow him]
STAN
Craig, dude, wait up.
CARTMAN
[Craig leads the boys across the Nazca Plateau] Dude, Craig, we should go back now.
CRAIG
No.
STAN
[Craig leads them across an open field] Hey look, there's something here.
CRAIG
...Nope.
CARTMAN
[the boys walk through a thunderstorm] Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around.
CRAIG
Yup, nice and boring. Just the way I like it.
[South Park. Randy turns his camera on again]
RANDY
It's been three days now since the guinea pigs and the guinea bees attacked. Guinea rabbits are still everywhere, along with a few guinea panthers. We've taken shelter at the Outback Steakhouse. There's Sharon and Shelly. Say "hey" guys.
SHELLY
What is that? What is that? [Sharon holds her close]
RANDY
I'm gon-, I'm gonna take a look outside! [gets up with his camera and heads outside]
[Outside Outback Steakhouse. Randy runs into a fleeing couple]
RANDY
What is it?
HUSBAND
It's a Guineasaurus Rex! [Randy turns around and sees the G. Rex next to P.F. Chang. It's much bigger than other guinea creatures: about 30 feet high at the shoulder. Everyone near it scatters. Randy zooms in on the car it seems to be eating from and sees a dead couple there. The woman's body is halfway out the car through the windshield. The man's body is halfway out through the passenger door. The alarm has gone off.]
SHELLY
Oh my Gohhhd!
RANDY
Oh no, I'm way too startled!
SHARON
[points up to the sky] Look! [three jet fighters swoop in from somewhere and fire missiles at the G. Rex, but it remains unscathed]
RANDY
Jesus, they can't kill it! [turns his camera to Shelly] What do you think about the Guineasaurus Rex, Shelly? [she's scared, but moves closer to the street to get a better look. This puts her in the same frame as the G. Rex] Oh that's good. There, there's Shelly with the Guineasaurus Rex in the background. Give, give a little peace sign, Shelly. [Shelly turns around frozen in fear] Oh I know, hold out your palm so it looks like you're holding the Guineasaurus Rex. Shelly?
SHARON
Randy?! I have had it! You are putting down that God damned camera!
RANDY
Sharon, you're gonna be really glad we have all this footage of the family someday. [she rears back and smacks the camera out of his hand]
[Machu Picchu, night. Chertoff arrives with his staff at the site in a military helicopter]
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Wait here a minute. [nearby a huge golden Incan idol holds a stick and a pan flute. Chertoff approaches it and opens his arms] Behold! I am standing on your precious land! I've waited a long time for this! [unzips his pants and urinates on the statue, mocking it with laughter]
SOLDIER 6
What's he doing?
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
What of your prophecy now?! Nothing can stop me! [there's some sound to his left and he turns to see what it is. It's Craig climbing over a wall and dusting himself off. Chertoff approaches him in anger] Craiiig! [the other four boys appear behind Craig] No! How did you get here?!
CARTMAN
Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up!
SOLDIER 6
Sir, ih-is everything all right?
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Shoot them!
SOLDIER 7
Shoot them?
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
They're a Peruvian band that escaped. We must keep them contained.
STAN
No no, listen to me. The Peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away. Whatever is happening to the world is happening because you guys got rid of all the flute bands.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
I said shoot them!
KYLE
Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.
TOP OFFICIAL
Maybe we should look at it, sir.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Damn you Craiiig! You just don't ever stop, do you?!
CRAIG
I didn't say anything.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
[begins his speech] You see, for thousands of years horrid creatures have lived in the Guinea Valley of Peru. The Incas learned how to keep the creatures at bay: by playing pan flute music. Guinea creatures hate it even more than humans do. But the prophecy foretold that one day the creatures would be unleashed and I have made that happen! The Incas predicted the world would be saved... by Craig. But that part of the prophecy will not come true! For you will all die on this mountain! [one of the soldiers fires his rifle and the bullets pierce through Chertoff's chest, leaving a large hole. Chertoff looks at the hole and cackles]
TOP OFFICIAL
You're, you're some kind of monster.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
[ominously] Oh, I'm much more than that. Guinea bees, guinea rabbits, guineasaurus rexes, I am something much more evil! [he begins to transform. His mouth becomes a round orifice with a few teeth inside, then into a horrible beast with many teeth in his mouth and a pirate costume on his body, and finally, a giant guinea pirate] Arrrgh.
TOP OFFICIAL
Guinea pirate! [dives into the bushes]
STAN
Jesus Christ!
CRAIG
Sir, I promise you, I'm not going to ruin your plans. I'll just walk away. See? [walks onto a square with a pattern on it. The circle in the center of the pattern lights up and begins to rotate up and out. Two stone slabs jut out from the pillar. The golden idol's eyes light up. A beam of light goes from the idol's staff to one of the slabs, and two beams of lightning come out of Craig's eyes and strike the guinea pirate]
MICHAEL CHERTOFF
Dargh, no!
CRAIG
Okay, now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes.
MICHAEL CHERTOFF:
Argh, curse ye, Craig. Dar, argh. [the guinea pirate falls on its back and the beams turn off. The slabs go back into the pillar and the pillar rotates back into the ground. The four boys approach Craig, stunned at what just happened. Craig lets out a big sigh of relief]
[A picture of Craig is shown, and Gery Numan's "Cars" is playing in pan flute format]
CRAIG
My name is Craig Tucker. Last week I stopped a guinea pirate from taking over the earth. All the Peruvian flute bands were released, [a shot of that is shown; happy pan flute musicians] and drove the guinea creatures back to the Andes mountains. [shots from all over are shown, specifically South Park and New York City: pan flute bands are driving the guinea creatures away] Many people had died, but mankind had prevailed. [shots of the cleanup are shown. The Marshes are among the rescued] All over the world, survivors were found, living witnesses to the horror that had been seen.
RANDY
[trying to show a video clip to two firemen] Here here, look, look! [there's no picture] What the? [opens the camera to check it out] Oh- ohhh I didn't have a tape in it. [someone else took a picture of that, though]
CRAIG
The guinea pirate lived, but was taken to prison to live out the rest of his days. [the guinea pirate is taken to the Washington D.C. State Penitentiary strapped down to a flatbed truck. Next, a shot of Paris is shown: a Peruvian flute band plays at the Champs Elysées] And people all over the world learned to support their local Peruvian flute bands, and buy their CDs. For they protect us from the guinea creatures. As for me, I was returned home by Homeland Security. [Top Official 1 and Official 3 drop him off and smile at the joyful parents] My parents were sooo happy. [a shot of Craig looking at himself in the mirror, reflecting on the events surrounding his trip to Peru] I realized that we don't always have control over what happens to us. [a shot of Craig in bed, just after bedtime] We are but players on the stage of life. And I also learned to never listen when people come asking you for money. [a shot of the boys dressed as Mariachis standing at Craig's front porch talking to him; he slams the door in their faces.]
[Craig's front yard. The boys walk away all pissed off]
CARTMAN
That guy's an asshole!
KYLE
Yeah, what a dick!
KENNY
(I fuckin' hate Craig!)
[Department of Homeland Security, days later. A new director has taken over and is seated behind a solid wooden desk]
TOP OFFICIAL 2
[enters the office without warning] Sir! Sir, we have a problem!
NEW DIRECTOR
What now?!
TOP OFFICIAL 2
The former director of Homeland Security, that turned out to be a guinea pig? It attacked the guards, got out of its holding cell.
NEW DIRECTOR
My God, are you telling me..?
TOP OFFICIAL 2
Yes sir. It broke out of prison. [heavy footfalls are felt throughout Washington D.C. Car alarms go off, people scream, and a large guinea pig in striped prison uniform appears. The camera shuts off.]
End of Pandemic 2: The Startling


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:While the country celebrates the outcome of the election, the new President-elect catches everyone off guard when he arrives at the White House prematurely.

script:About Last Night...

[Chicago, night. Barack Obama stands behind a podium facing two TelePrompTers, two glass walls, and a crowd of supporters. He has just won the Presidency.]
OBAMA
If there is anyone out there tonight who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer. [a cheer goes up in the audience]
[The Marsh house. Randy jumps for joy while his family, including Grandpa Marsh, sits on the sofa behind him. Another couple stands behind the sofa. Gerald and Sheila sit on a second sofa. Randy and Gerald wear Obama shirts]
RANDY
Yyeeaahh!!!! [pumps his beer can up and down a couple of times] Obama! [runs around] WOOOOO! We did it! We F'in' did it!
GERALD
[stands up] Yyeeaahh!!!!
OBAMA
It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this date in this election at this defining moment, change has come to America.
RANDY
Yyeeaahh!!!! Yeah Obama! Chaaange! It's, it's chaaange!
OBAMA
Sasha and Malia, I love you both more than you can imagine, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House. We will name him "Sparkles".
RANDY
[kneels before the TV] He's so awesome! [runs his hand over the screen a few times] He's so perfect and awesome!
OBAMA
Where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we can’t, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes We Can.
SUPPORTERS
[in Chicago] Yes we can!
RANDY
Yes I can! Yes I can! [the others watch him run out of the house]
[Outside the Marsh house. Randy opens the door and proclaims]
RANDY
Here comes the change everybody! WOOO! [people nearby gather around the front steps]
MR. HARRIS
Did you see? Our man is in! [among the gathering crowd are Mr. Adler and the Blacks.]
MRS. HARRIS
We did it!
MR. ADLER
Everything is going to be awesome now!
RANDY
This is the greatest day of our lives! Yes we can!
LINDA BLACK
I don't even know what to do now.
RANDY
I know what to do! [steps into the street and cups his hands on his cheeks so as to amplify his voice] Losers! Looosers!
[The Stotch house, living room. A "Go McCain" banner hangs over the sofa. Mr. Garrison sits on a chair, Stephen and Linda sit on the sofa with Mr. Mackey, Principal Victoria and her boyfriend sit on two chairs in front of Mr. Mackey. Most everyone there is wearing a McCain/Palin shirt or sweater]
CROWD
[outside] Looosers! Looosers!
STEPHEN
Oh, shut up!
CROWD
Looosers!
BUTTERS
We lost?
MCCAIN
[giving his concession speech] It is natural. It's natural tonight to feel some disappointment. We fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours.
SUPPORTERS
No no! Noo nooo!
BUTTERS
Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad.
STEPHEN
[gets up and walks to the TV] No. No, this can't happen! No! [kicks the TV screen, causing it to short and shatter]
LINDA
Stephen!
STEPHEN
It's all over, Linda! The country as we know it is about to change. We're all dead.
LINDA
You don't know that, Stephen!
MR. MACKEY
With an inexperienced man as President, we do know it! He is right! Game over, man! Okay?!
MR. GARRISON
We'll probably be dead by sunrise!
STEPHEN
Butters, Daddy loves you. Just remember that... he always loved youuu... [someone pounds on the door. Stephen and Butters look over and the door opens. It's Randy]
RANDY
WOOOO Obama!
MR. GARRISON
Get out o'here!
[The Marsh house. It's quiet there now. The doorbell rings and Stan answers it. He sees Kyle and Ike on the landing]
KYLE
Dude, have you seen my parents? [Ike begins to cry]
STAN
No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother?
KYLE
He was a McCain supporter. [Ike cries harder] It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine.
[Chicago, Obama headquarters. It's 1:10 am and Obama steps through some double doors. The press awaits him.]
REPORTER 1
Uh Mr. President, over here!
REPORTER 2
Congratulations!
REPORTER 3
Great start, great job!
REPORTER 4
Change!
REPORTER 5
Great job, Mr. President!
REPORTER 6
Great job, Obama!
OBAMA
Thank you all for your support. If you don't mind, I'm gonna spend the rest of the evening getting some much needed rest. [steps through double doors at the other end of the hall and closes them behind him. A man walks out of the shadows as Obama turns away from the doors] Senator McCain.
MCCAIN
President Obama. [the two men step up and face each other, then start to giggle, then roar with laughter. They give each other a high-five and a low-five.]
MCCAIN, OBAMA
Boom, baby!
OBAMA
Ohoh man that was perfect! [works on removing his jacket]
MCCAIN
[pulls out a cell phone and starts calling someone] I almost thought we were gonna tie for a minute there. That would have screwed us.
OBAMA
You played it perfectly, there was no way.
MCCAIN
It's McCain, we did it! Obama is President.
DAVIS
Yeah, so I've heard. You guys are out of your freakin' minds, you know that?
MCCAIN
Yes, we do. Assemble the rest of the team: we've only got ten hours.
DAVIS
Sure. Hard part's over, right?
MCCAIN
Actually, the hard part's just starting.
[The streets of South Park. Two men set up a "Obama for President 2008" banner over the roof of a house. Down below are posters and banners for Obama plastered all over the houses and the crowd is partying to "Celebration". Randy rallies them on by blowing through a paper horn]
REVELER 1
[gulps down a beer] Yoohoo!
REVELER 2
Obama yeah, I can't believe it!
RANDY
O ba ma! O ba ma!
REVELERS
O ba ma! O ba ma!
RANDY
Cehhh-lebrate good Obama come on! [reaches a keg of beer and serves himself some into a mug] It's Obamobama! [someone walks by and just throws up]
[Stan's house. He and Kyle look at the partying going on outside. Stan is on the phone]
STAN
Yes, I'd like to make a noise complaint. [outside the music changes to "Who Let The Dogs Out?" Someone swings from a traffic light and falls. A truck full of young adults rolls by]
CROWD
Obama!
RANDY
Who let the Obama out? [moments later a police car rolls down the street, slowly going through the crowd] Ohoh, police are here. OooooOOOOooo!
CROWD
OooooOOOOooo! [Officer Barbrady stops the cruiser and hops out of it]
BARBRADY
Okay people, time to disperse. Party's over!
RANDY
BOOOO! [other people join in the booing]
REVELER
...party Obama!
BARBRADY
Come on, time to go home.
RANDY
What are you? A McCain voter?
CROWD
Yeah!
RANDY
Sorry pal, but Obama's President now! [walks towards Barbrady, and his pants begin to fall to his ankles] Obama! Obama! [walks past him and towards the police car]
CROWD
Obama! Obama!
RANDY
Yeah yeah, flip the... Flip the cop car! Flip the cop car! [other revelers walk up and help out]
BARBRADY
Ey, put down my car! [Randy and the revelers succeed in flipping the car over]
REVELERS
Yes we can! [they move in and keep rocking the car as the music switches to "Mickey".]
BARBRADY
No! No! Hey, stop it!
STAN
Jesus Christ...
RANDY
O-bama you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. Hey Obama! Hey Obama! [Cartman rolls by in his Big Wheels trike, pulling a cart full of TVs]
CARTMAN
Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV? [Stan and Kyle just look at each other.]
[Washington D.C., at the penthouse of a hotel. Obama and McCain enter a suite where the rest of their team is waiting for them. It's 2:15 am. The team members applaud them as they reach the middle of the room.]
QUINCY
Bravo Obama and McCain. Ten years you two have been working on this plan and you've finally pulled it off!
MCCAIN
Guys, we've all known each other a long time, had many incredible adventures, but this is going to be our greatest feat ever.
NEELY
I knew it! I knew when you two ran for President you were just working an angle.
OBAMA
Always workin' the angles.
MCCAIN
My friends, while the entire country is busy reacting to the election, we are about to pull off the greatest heist in human history.
QUINCY
So, come on, enlighten us. What are we stealing this time? [Obama and McCain look at each other knowingly. The next scene shows a huge diamond necklace]
OBAMA
The Hope Diamond, rated #4 of the ten most precious diamonds in the world. Going street value, Middle-Eastern market, of course, two hundred and ten million dollars.
DAVIS
Two hundred ten?
MCCAIN
Million.
QUINCY
No no no, the Hope Diamond is ungettable. Every thief in the world knows that.
OBAMA
Almost ungettable. The diamond is kept in the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, long considered to be the most thief-proof structure ever built. [Two security guards go around closing the exhibits for the night] The Diamond Wing Is protected by impenetrable walls of two-foot wide steel. On the northeast side, a seven-five laser system. [the guards walk out of a room and turn on the laser system as they exit] There's simply no side of the Smithsonian that can be breached.
DAVIS
So you go in from the roof, drop into it from the top.
OBAMA
Can't get it to from the top because a polymer shelf runs the entire expanse.
QUINCY
Okay, you can't get into the museum from any side and you can't drop in from above, so you can't get the diamond. [Obama walks over to the computer and turns it on, stepping aside for McCain]
MCCAIN
Meet... the Presidential Escape Tunnel, [a simulation begins to play on the computer monitors] A two-mile long underground passage that runs from the White House to a location outside the city limits in case of an attack. The tunnel is only accessible from the Oval Office and just happens to travel right underneath the Smithsonian Natural History Museum.
NEELY, DAVIS
Boom, baby!
MCCAIN
You get somebody into that tunnel, they can blast into the museum, let the others in, the heist is on.
QUINCY
So you both run for President because one of you has to win, and you've got your access to the tunnel.
MCCAIN
And we run on a particularly brutal campaign so that the nation is as distracted as possible over the next... eight hours.
QUINCY
This all sounds very risky.
OBAMA
[walks across the floor] We've spent ten years putting this plan together. If we are indeed the greatest thief club in the world-
NEELY
And we are.
OBAMA
[turns around] -we won't get caught.
[Stan's house, night. Kyle is in the kitchen, on the phone with 9-1-1.]
KYLE
Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won.
STAN
[walks in from the dining room] Kyle, Kyle you gotta get out here.
KYLE
What?!
STAN
Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!
KYLE
Oh my God! [drops the phone and follows Stan to Ike]
[Stan's house, one of the windows. Kyle is standing on a window sill in the den mumbling out loud. Stan and Kyle run outside and reach the window]
KYLE
Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for! [Ike begins to cry] I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay. [Ike mumbles something to him] No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan. [Ike says something more] Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something. [The camera zooms out to show that the window is barely off the ground. Ike cries, Stan and Kyle look at each other] Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it.
IKE
Good-bye. [falls from the window sill and lands on the ground face down]
STAN, KYLE
NOO!
KYLE
Ike? [no response] Oh crap Ike?
[The White House, night]
CHIEF OF SECURITY
All right, everyone, I'm turning in for the night. Go to standard security, team 3.
SS AGENT 1
Sir! S-sir, we have a bit of a problem.
CHIEF OF SECURITY
What?
SS AGENT 1
The new President-elect is here. Eh he wants into the Oval Office.
CHIEF OF SECURITY
Barack Obama? [next scene shows Barack Obama walking through the White House]
SS AGENT 2
They're all, they're all right through here, sir.
CHIEF OF SECURITY
[interrupting as Obama enters] Uh, hello, is there something we can do for you, Mr. Obama?
OBAMA
Just checking out the new digs. How are you guys?
CHIEF OF SECURITY
Good, sir.
OBAMA
I'd like to see the Oval Office, please?
CHIEF OF SECURITY
Right now?
OBAMA
I don't waste time, gentlemen. I've only got two months to figure out how I wanna redecorate, if you know what I mean. You know, change the drapes and stuff.
CHIEF OF SECURITY
[backs up towards the Oval Office] Sure, right this way, Mr... President. [opens the doors to the office]
OBAMA
[enters the office] I will need absolute privacy, is that understood?
CHIEF OF SECURITY
Yes sir. [Obama places a bill into the Chief's jacket breast pocket]
OBAMA
Thanks. [closes the doors]
CHIEF OF SECURITY
I got a hundred dollars. [grins]
[Inside the Oval Office.]
OBAMA
All right, McCain. I'm in.
MCCAIN
Nicely done, B. We're in position outside the Smithsonian. [he's with a construction team] You find the escape tunnel?
OBAMA
I'm already on it. [plugs a hacking device into an electronic lock hidden under a panel on the desktop; it quickly starts crunching numbers in trying to decode the password. Once it decodes the right password the desk moves to one side and the secret passage is revealed] Boom baby.
[South Park, early early morning. The Obama supporters are still partying on the neighborhood streets. The music this time is "Whoomp! (There it is)"]
REVELER 3
Yehhheheah!
RANDY
[even more drunk than before, serves himself more beer] Wooo, change.
REVELER 4
Change.
REVELER 5
Change.
STAN
[running up to him with Kyle] Dad Dad, we have a problem.
RANDY
Not anymore we don't; everything's different now.
STAN
No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital.
RANDY
We don't have to take... crap... from the fit- rich, fat cats anymore.
STAN
Dude, he's wasted.
RANDY
Hey, it's my boss. Hey boss! [walks over]
RANDY'S BOSS
Oh, hello Marsh.
RANDY
Yeah, you know what? Fuck you! [Stan and Kyle are stunned]
RANDY'S BOSS
Huh?
RANDY
You heard me, you fuckin' piece of shit! I can finally tell you what I think o'you, fuckin' asshole!
STAN
[quite concerned] Dad, what are you doing?!
RANDY
It's okay, Stan, everything's changed. I don't need this stupid fuckin' job anymore! You lil fucking assfuck, piece of shit [gives him the finger again] You know what Obama said? Yes we can!
RANDY'S BOSS
Hey, I voted for Obama.
RANDY
Obama's not talkin' about you!
KYLE
[looks around] Can someone help us? My little brother fell out of a window. [Randy punches his boss in the face and his boss just leaves, holding his hands over his nose]
[McCain headquarters. Sarah Palin stands behind a podium. Photographers snap away at their cameras]
PALIN
I just wanna say to everyone who's a little disappointed that we lost the election that there's always next year. Maybe I'll run again for Vice President again in 2009. [the cameras die down and everyone is a bit aghast at her statement]
REPORTER 1
Uh Mrs. Palin, have you seen or heard from John McCain?
PALIN
Uh, uh, nnno, I don't really know where he went. Kinda seems a little odd, I guess, but [her cell phone begins to ring] Oh, my phone's going ringy. Ex-cuse me. [steps away from the podium and off the stage to her left. She answers the phone at a safe distance from the stage] Hello?
MCCAIN
Hello Sarah, it's McCain.
PALIN
[switches to a British accent] I hope to God you're calling to tell me you're in position below the vault with the L7 charges.
OBAMA
I'm in the tunnel now, Sarah. I should be almost below the museum.
PALIN
Just make sure you don't blow the transformers along with the tunnel because it will trigger the five-four laser system! And don't damage any coupling wires or it'll be worthless when Gary shuts down the grid. I'll be there in thirty.
OBAMA
God she's awesome.
PALIN
[returns to the podium and a normal voice] Oh, I guess Senator McCain's gonna fly me back to Alaska now. He's got a private jet, you know? Okay, byebye then. [walks off to her right] Bloody idiots. [she walks out of the headquarters through a side door, tosses off her red business suit and walks towards the camera in a catsuit. She whips out some sais and spins them around like pistols]
MCCAIN
All right, here we go. [a piledriver is turned on and a massive pile is lifted up, then dropped. Shockwaves spread out each time the pile hits the ground]
GUARD 1
What's that noise?
GUARD 2
It's okay, just some construction outside. [Obama prepares a charge and sets it off, and light enters the tunnel. Obama has broken into the Smithsonian. He pops his head through the hole]
[Inside the Smithsonian. Obama looks around and sees the laser system is on.]
OBAMA
Oh no. [presses a button on his headset] McCain? We've got a problem. [the lasers are now blue instead of red]
[South Park streets, night. Stan and Kyle have placed Ike in a red Radio Flier wagon and are pulling him along. Ike moans from time to time. They pass by a gas station]]
KYLE
Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help.
STAN
[points ahead] Hey, there's some people. [ahead of them is a garage that has been converted into a cave. Stephen Stotch and the other McCain supporters are there putting stuff away. Stephen is holding a crowd of other McCain supporters at bay with a rifle.]
STEPHEN
Let's just stay back- STAY BACK! We don't have any more room in the Ark. [above the garage door is the work "A.RK"]
MAN 1
You have to let us in! You know the country's doomed!
WOMAN 1
Who are you to turn us away?!
STEPHEN
I built this bunker in case McCain lost! There isn't enough room for everyone!
KYLE
Hey, excuse me, but we need some help.
STEPHEN
I know you do, but there's no more room, I tell ya!
MAN 2
You're going to deny them too?
MAN 1
[throws down his sleeping bag] For God's sake, man, they're children! [kneels next to Stan] Look them in the eyes and tell them you won't take them in! [tugs on Stan's cheeks] Look at their little cheeks!
STAN
Let go of my face, asshole!
STEPHEN
All right, damn you! The children can come in!
KYLE
No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter!
MAN 3
Okay, then I want their place.
MAN 4
Me too.
KYLE
We NEED a ride to the hospital!
MAN 1
THERE ISN'T GONNA BE A HOSPITAL! DON'T YOU GET IT?!
WOMAN 2
Let us in now! [Stephen smacks her away, and a brawl follows]
MR. GARRISON
Whoa, Jesus, it's already happening. Society's breaking down!
MAN 5
Obama hasn't been elected four hours and already the country's going to hell! [another supporter smacks him down from behind. Stan and Kyle just leave and resume their walk]
[The Oval Office, outside. The Chief of Security knocks on the door]]
CHIEF OF SECURITY
Mr. Obama? [tries to open it, but can't] Sir? [looks to another Secret Service agent] All right, give me the keys. [the door opens before the agent could reach for the keys. Barack Obama dusts himself off]
OBAMA
Is there a problem, gentlemen?
CHIEF OF SECURITY
Uh, no. No, sir. Everything okay in there?
OBAMA
Why wouldn't it be? I'm sorry, but I asked to be left alone?
CHIEF OF SECURITY
Yes, sir, it's, just that... your wife is here.
OBAMA
My wife?
MICHELLE
[appears behind the agents] Barack, everyone's been looking for you. What on earth are you doing?
OBAMA
[pulls her into the Oval Office] Uh, c-c-come on in, darling. [appears at the doorway again] Thank, thank you boys. [closes and locks the doors]
[The Oval Office, inside. Barack and Michelle are alone now]]
MICHELLE
Okay Barack, tell me what's going on?
OBAMA
Michelle, there's something I need to tell you.
MICHELLE
What is it? [Obama stays quiet] Barack, what is it?!
OBAMA
The laser system guarding the diamond was replaced by an optical relay three days ago.
MICHELLE
You gotta be kiddin' me. So the entire diamond vault is inaccessible?! Is McCain online?
MCCAIN
[wearing a huge fake mustache] Hi, Michelle.
MICHELLE
[removes the Bluetooth device from Obama's right ear and places it on her own] You guys weren't runnin' update checks on the security logs?!
MCCAIN
Michelle, we need you to do a different scan hack through the vault relay.
MICHELLE
On a new system, in an hour?! Are you nuts? My job was to pretend to be married to this bozo and get you three scan hacks into a laser system!
SARAH
Michelle, it's Sarah. They did replace the laser system, but the new one isn't brand-new. It's an old H-7 series. You can break this baby in 30 minutes.
MICHELLE
Egh. Tell Davis to get me a fortrans emitter and enough pulse drives to light a spark.
OBAMA
Did you catch that, Davis?
DAVIS
I'm on it.
[Hell's Pass Hospital, night. Stan and Kyle finally make it to the emergency entrance]]
KYLE
We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay. [they enter the ER and see a lot of patients in there. One man has an Obama flag stuck up his ass. The clock reads 9 p.m., so it must be broken]
NURSE
[showing an Obama patient where to wait] There, just take a seat over there.
KYLE
[getting the nurse's attention] E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention.
NURSE
Was he an Obama supporter or a McCain supporter?
STAN
Why does that matter?
NURSE
Because then I'll know if he partied too hard or if he tried to kill himself. [on one side of the ER are Obama supporters who are suffering the effects of too much partying, and on the other are McCain supporters who have more serious wounds]
KYLE
Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help.
NURSE
You don't understand, kid: there's only two doctors on call, and Dr. Wilson is out celebrating in the streets somewhere.
STAN
So where's the other doctor? [the nurse opens a door behind her and the other doctor... is hanging from a noose attached to the ceiling]
RANDY
[walking in suddenly towards the Obama side] Hey, come on people. We can keep partying, can't we? Yes we can! Come on, let's sing. O-bama. Well you came and you gave without taking. [moans come up from all over the ER as people cover their ears] And I sent you away, O-bama. When you kissed me and stopped me from shakin'. [a McCain supporter tries to hasten his death by smashing a corkscrew into his head]
[The Smithsonian. Michelle and Obama are at the tunnel's new entry point near the Hope Diamond. Michelle is still breaking the new laser system]]
MICHELLE
I've almost got it. You're only going to have five minutes. Do you understand?
OBAMA
Did you really not like pretending to be married?
MICHELLE
Oh Jesus, now is not the time, B.
OBAMA
Come on. You have to admit we had some fun.
MICHELLE
My girls need somebody better than a world-class diamond thief. Woowait, there! I got it.
OBAMA
[to everyone connected to his bluetooth unit] All right, everyone. We're about to go. So here's the revised schedule: 4:40 a.m., the team gathers at the northwest exit of the museum. [the heist is shown taking place as Obama goes through the schedule] 4:45 a.m., Michelle hacks the optical relay, allowing me access to the rear doors.
MICHELLE
Go! [Obama takes off]
OBAMA
4:46, from inside I can open the doors and let in the rest of the crew. [Obama opens the vault door and McCain and the others walk in] 5:10 a.m., at the Department of Power Quincy shuts down the grid, disabling power to the vault room. 5:12, my grandmother who faked her death on Monday calls in a bomb threat to the museum.
GRANDMA OBAMA
I said I put a bomb in your building, bitch.
OBAMA
5:13, the guards open the southwest door, checking the museum for any bombs. [above them, Palin crawls across the ceiling like Spider-Man towards the entrance] 5:14, McCain, dressed as a football player, enters security and shuts off the diamond case alarm. [Palin drops down and hangs upside down. She lifts the glass display cover from the diamond and swipes the Hope Diamond from its display case. McCain is spotted and flees]
SMITHSONIAN GUARD
Hey you! Stop!
OBAMA
Michelle and I head back into the tunnel and the hole is patched. [Davis and Neely act as repairmen and seal up the hole] 5:15 a.m., I walk out of the Oval Office with the diamond securely hidden in my anus.
OBAMA
[to the Secret Service] All done. Thanks. [Barack and Michelle head outside, towards a limousine. The door opens and McCain is waiting for them. They enter and take their seats, and the limousine rolls off. The rest of the team looks at the three of them, and they all laugh. Obama takes the diamond out of his ass and displays it for all to see.]
[Boom, baby!]
QUINCY
There's just one thing: don't you think people are going to be suspicious when you disappear? Go looking for you?
OBAMA
We hired a guy for that a couple of months ago. [a plane sits all by itself in a field somewhere. The interior is full of dummies. Nearby, in a recovery room, Ike rises from his bed as Stan and Kyle look off into space. He presses a button and the plane blows up: the plane was landed near Hell's Pass Hospital. Stan and Kyle hear the explosion and quickly turn around and look outside]
KYLE
What the hell? [they observe the burning plane. Ike sneaks away while the boys are distracted. He dashes across the hall to the coroner's office and enters it. He hops onto a chair and attaches a USB stick to a computer, and begins typing. Dossiers of the heist team members pop up and Ike classifies each one as deceased. The door opens, and Kyle and Stan enter] Ike?
IKE
Boom, baby.
[Dulles Airport, day. The heist team members are in the waiting room watching their plane, an Air Tahiti jet, taxi into position]]
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Here are all the tickets for your group, Mr. Sanchez.
MCCAIN
Thank you very much.
QUINCY
Well friends, let us depart.
OBAMA
Hey uh, you guys go ahead. I just came to say goodbye.
NEELY
Wha?
OBAMA
I decided to hang it up, maybe give this President thing a shot.
MCCAIN
B, you can't be serious.
QUINCY
Besides, you died in a jet in the Rocky Mountains, remember?
OBAMA
Could have been I didn't make that flight. [walks up to Michelle] What do you say, Michelle? Would you and your girls like to move into the White House with me? You know, settle down, just be President and First Lady for a while.
MICHELLE
You're serious.
OBAMA
Who knows? Maybe we could change a few things. What do you say?
MICHELLE
Aww, what the fuck. [they begin to kiss, and the other members of the team wave goodbye and head for the plane]
MCCAIN
I just looove happy endings.
[South Park, the A.RK, morning. The garage door goes up and the McCain supporters in the bunker look out into the same scene they'd seen countless times before.]]
STEPHEN
It's still here, ih... it's all still here.
MR. GARRISON
Does that mean... maybe we overreacted?
STEPHEN
No, no, I wouldn't say that. It's just maybe... well, uh... maybe Obama will be all right.
[The Marsh house, living room. Randy wakes up from a drunken slumber, trash still strewn all over the living room.]]
RANDY
Uhh... [sits up and tries to rub his eyes, but he's got a headache] Oh ow. [walks forward...] Hey, where are my pants? [looks at the table the TV is missing from] Where's our TV?! Where are my pants and where's my TV?!
STAN
Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired.
RANDY
[surprised] Oh! [is pissed off again] Ugh, God damn it! Obama said things would be different! That sonofabitch lied to us! I knew I should have voted for McCain! [kicks a side table away and walks off]
End of About Last Night...


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The boys must embrace the latest fad to hit South Park Elementary or risk their status as the coolest kids in school.

As long as we've got each other, we'll never have any trouble.
GIRLS' TABLE

GIRLS' TABLE
As long as we stick together, together we'll stay.
And every kid in school is special in their own way.

An' groovin' to the beat when my homework is all done. (yeah!)
If you ask me what I know, then you know what I will say?
That every single body is special in their own way.
STAN
[while the boy is singing] Who the hell is that?

Why that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody.
BEBE

KIDS
Everyone is special in their own way
BRIDON

As long as we have each other, we'll never have any trouble.
That's what bein' friends is about.
KYLE
Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
STAN
Yeah, I guess we'd better check that movie out...
[Stan's house. The boys are watching High School Musical. They're watching a musical sequence with all singing and dancing on tables and up and downstairs. It's quite an elaborate presentation]
SINGERS
You've gotta go with the status quo. If you wanna be a regular Joe. (come on now)
And your dreams are only a beat away; don't let 'em tell you no. (tell you no-o-o)
You've gotta go with the status quo. Keep singing 'bout the status quo (keep singing 'bout the status)
That's the place we know (get down now)
We're all in our high school dancing on tables singing 'bout what we know (singing 'bout what we know)
We've gotta go with the status quo, go with the status quo. (go with the status)
Go with the status quo (go with the status quo). That's where we should go. (Go there now)
Copies of pop songs packaged by Disney and turned into a show (into a show).
That's the status quo! That's the status quo (That's the status quo) That's the status quohh!

That's the place we know (get down now)
We're all in our high school dancing on tables singing 'bout what we know (singing 'bout what we know)
We've gotta go with the status quo, go with the status quo. (go with the status)
Go with the status-
[During this number, the following conversation takes place. At first, the boys are silently watching the TV, then]
CARTMAN
This... is cool? This... is cool. We are really gettin' old, you guys. [silence follows for a few seconds, then Stan holds up the DVD case]
STAN
Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.
KYLE
They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.
CARTMAN
Well, I'm out guys. [get up from the sofa, puts on his jacket, and heads for the front door] If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends.
STAN
I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing it.
KYLE
I'm not doing it either. Kenny?
KENNY
(No way in hell I'm doing it.)
STAN
All right, do we promise? We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this. [holds up his right hand. Kyle holds his right hand up as well, and Kenny holds up his left]
KYLE
I swear
KENNY
(I swear too.)
STAN
Okay, good.
[South Park Elementary, Garrison's class. Kids begin taking their seats. Stan is writing something as Cartman comes in and sits down]
CARTMAN
Ehhhhhhh. [Stan stops writing]
KYLE
What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.
CARTMAN
I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.
STAN
But you didn't die?
CARTMAN
...Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore. [The bell rings and Mr. Garrison walks in with his books]
MR. GARRISON
All right, kids in seats, kids in seats. [the last few kids take their seats] Today we are going to discuss the Berlin Wall. [He writes "Berlin Wall" on the chalkboard] This was a wall in Germany that actually separated the Communist east side and the Democratic west side.
WENDY
[stands up on the seat of her desk] East side, west side, whatever side that you're on. [some kids begin to snap their fingers]
BEBE
As long as we care about each other we can still have some fun.
KYLE
Aw man.
CLASS
Don't sweat what you might get by assuming the other side as a threat
MR. GARRISON
[beaming] Oh, you kids. [Stan buries his face in his hand]</poem>
CLASS
Each side is right or wrong, we've gotta learn to all get along.
BRIDON
[enters the classroom] East side, west side, doesn't matter to me.
We've gotta learn to power through, set each other free.
WENDY
We don't care what other people wear or the way they like to style their hair.
[Stan looks at them both and begins to worry that Bridon might sweep her away]
BRIDON, WENDY
Each side is right or wrong, we've gotta learn to all get along.
CLASS
East siiide, west siiide, east siiide...
CARTMAN:
[looking around and getting pissed off] God this sucks!
[The hallway, later on. Wendy's at her locker putting some books away. Stan is far enough away that she doesn't notice him, but he's watching her. Jimmy walks up to him]
JIMMY
Do you feel like maybe you're l-l-losin' her, S-Stan?
STAN
I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway.
JIMMY
M-Maybe you should just talk to her. You know, a little conversation. Tell her... what you feel.
Sometimes you feel like there's a b-burnin' inside you, like a-
STAN
Stop. [holds his left hand out, palm out, for emphasis, and walks away. Jimmy stops singing]
JIMMY
All righty then.
STAN
[walks up to Wendy] Uh, Wendy?
WENDY
[looks at him] Hey Stan.
STAN
Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should.
WENDY
What?
STAN
I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way.
WENDY
Stan, that's ridiculous.
STAN
It is?
WENDY
I would never leave you for Bridon.
STAN
[brightens up] Really?
WENDY
No way. That's stupid. I wouldn't have a chance with Bridon; he can be with any girl he wants. [shuts her locker and walks away, kissing Stan on the left cheek. Jimmy arrives two seconds later]
JIMMY
There you go. Feel better, p-pal? [Stan stays quiet]
[Stan walks through some double doors and continues down the hallway. The doors close behind him]
STAN
What am I supposed to do? Can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away. [at an intersection he takes a left turn] I mean, Wendy said she'd never leave me for him. [kids appear behind him and follow him] But what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings? She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl. [the kids begin to snap their fingers] This is all so crazy. I mean really, how could my day get any worse? [noticing the finger-snapping, he stops walking and looks around. The kids wait for him to start singing and dancing] No-no, no, I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it!
KIDS
Awww. [murmurs follow]
STAN
No, fuck off. I'm not doing it.
KIDS
Awww. [more murmuring. As they disperse, Butters walks up to Stan]
BUTTERS
Awww jeez, you're no fun. [turns right and walks away. At the other end of the hall, Bridon rounds a corner and dances down the hallway in Stan's direction]
BEBE
Hey Bridon.
BRIDON
Hey.
LOLA
Hi Bridon
BRIDON
Hi.
HEIDI, MILLIE
Hey Bridon.
BRIDON
Hey.
STAN
[now hiding behind a corner. Bridon passes by him unaware] Hey, kid, over here. [Bridon looks around and finds Stan, then walks over to him] Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit.
BRIDON
Huh?
STAN
Yeah, look, I-I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed.
BRIDON
They are?
STAN
Yeah. You don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but, take it from me, [gets stern] you're driving everyone crazy.
BRIDON
I don't blame 'em. All that singing and dancing? I can't stand it.
STAN
You don't like doing it?
BRIDON
It just isn't me. What I really wanna do is just... play basketball.
STAN
Basketball?
BRIDON
I love it! Always have. I never miss a game on TV ...when my dad isn't making me rehearse. I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.
STAN
Dude, you should do that! You should join the basketball team, right now!
BRIDON
I can't.
STAN
[firmly] Yes, you can. What's stopping you?
BRIDON
[sighs deeply] It's my dad. He thinks basketball is for sissies. If I don't do what he wants, he beats me.
STAN
No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want!
BRIDON
Really?
STAN
When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents. Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing, and join the basketball team.
BRIDON
You know... you're right. I'm gonna talk to my old man tonight. [walks away]
STAN
[proud of himself] Sweet.
[Bridon's house, night. He's seated at the table for dinner. His mom enters the dining room with the main dish, a casserole. The dining room is lined with posters from various musicals - Phantom of the Opera, Mamma Mia... Felines. A full-length mirror is also present]
MRS. GUEERMO
Sit up properly, Bridon. You know how strict your father is about posture. [serves out the casserole] All right dear, dinner's ready!
MR. GUEERMO
[struts in, checks himself out in the mirror, and takes his seat at the head of the table] Okay, let's eat!
BRIDON
Dad, I need to talk to you about somethin'.
MR. GUEERMO:
Ooo, that sounds emotional! [holds his hand against his ear to listen better]
What is it son? What's on your mind? Whatever it is, you know your dad has the time.
BRIDON
No, Dad, can we just talk?
MR. GUEERMO
If you can talk it, you can sing it. [gets up and dances to the mirror again] You can lay down the rhythm and bring it! Just put a melody to the words that you're sayin' and sing the beat-
BRIDON
Dad, I want to join the basketball team. [his Dad is upset. He turns around and faces Bridon]
MR. GUEERMO
What did you say?
BRIDON
This kid at school today told me I should do what I wanna do. That's what I really wanna do.
MR. GUEERMO
Basketball? No son of mine is going to be a sweaty little jock!
BRIDON
But Dad, it's what I really want.
MR. GUEERMO
There's no singing and dancing in basketball!
BRIDON
I know. That's kind of why I like it.
MR. GUEERMO
Don't you even think about it! If I had a jock for a son, I'd be the laughingstock of the men's choir club.
BRIDON
It's my life, Dad!
MR. GUEERMO
Don't make me slap you! [raises his right hand, ready to slap] I will slap your face so super hard... [Bridon quickly leaves the table and his dad sits back down] I am the man of this house! You disrespect me and you're gonna get slapped!
MRS. GUEERMO
Maybe you should let him try it.
MR. GUEERMO
What did you say, woman?!
MRS. GUEERMO
You aren't being fair.
MR. GUEERMO
That's it! I'm gonna slap you!
MRS. GUEERMO
No, please.
MR. GUEERMO
[begins to sing and slap]
I slap you!
MRS. GUEERMO
Ahh!
MR. GUEERMO
I slap you!
MRS. GUEERMO
Ohh!
MR. GUEERMO
I slap, slap, slap you!
MRS. GUEERMO
Dohh!
MR. GUEERMO
Slapping you, slapping you, silly, 'cause you disrespected me.
MRS. GUEERMO
Ooohohoo!
[South Park Elementary. The four boys approach the school]
CARTMAN
You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class.
KYLE
You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd.
CARTMAN
Fuck you, Kyle! [upon entering the building, they are met by a pre-class musical production]
KIDS
And you know, we're together at school again.
JIMMY
School again.
STAN
Aww!
KIDS
With all of our friends, and you know, we'll be doing this forever.
CARTMAN
Oh God, shut up!
KIDS
Together at school again. What a special day.
CARTMAN
Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup!
KIDS
We could say that neverrrrrrrrrrr
Goes away.
[The school bell rings and everyone goes to class. Stan catches up to Bridon]
STAN
Hey kid, what happened?! I-I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore?!
BRIDON
Yeah, well, my dad blew a gasket when I told him and, then he beat my mom.
STAN
Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself! [sees someone down the hall] Mr. Garrett, Mr. Garrett. [Mr. Garrett, the school coach, is eating an apple] This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good.
MR. GARRETT
Really?
BRIDON
[looks down and away] Look, I should be getting to class.
MR. GARRETT
Hey, we sure could use you, kid. I could never find enough kids that wanna play ball. All the kids and the school funding go to the theater department.
STAN
You see? They need you. This is fate, kid, fate.
BRIDON
I don't know...
MR. GARRETT
Look, just come in at recess and shoot some ball with the team.
STAN
Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it!
BRIDON
Okay.
[Recess. The basketball team is assembled in the school gym. Bridon is at the free-throw line and shoots]
MR. GARRETT
Aayy, that's great, Bridon.
BRIDON
Thanks.
JASON
We might have a chance at winning now. [the doors open at the far end of the gym and Mr. Gueermo enters]
MR. GUEERMO
Bridon!
What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Bupow! Bupow! Bupow!
BRIDON
Dad, I was just messin' around.
MR. GUEERMO
I drove by the school and saw kids on the playground doing a music number and you weren't there! You're here in the sports gym shooting basket hoops!
MR. GARRETT
Eh, your kid is really good at this.
MR. GUEERMO
Don't talk to me, stupid jock asshole! [Bridon puts his arm up in self-defense]
MR. GARRETT
Just... go easy on him, huh?
MR. GUEERMO
[gasps, then raises his right hand up to strike] You know what this means? It means you're about to get slapped, so you'd better shut up!
MR. GARRETT
If he wants to play ball, you should let him.
MR. GUEERMO
I'll do it! I'll slap the shit out of you!
MR. GARRETT
He's just a kid.
MR. GUEERMO
[slap] You don't tell me how to raise my son! I'll slap it again. [slap]
BRIDON
Dad, stop!
MR. GUEERMO
You're trying to turn my son into a little asshole sports person like yourself [slaps with his left hand this time] There, there's another slap! Maybe you'll think next time you act, you- [right-hand slap] Slap it, I'll slap it! [left-hand slap. He then pulls Bridon out of the gym.]
BRIDON
Ow, Dad. Dad, you're hurting me.
MR. GUEERMO
Shut up, Bridon! [as he reaches the doors, they open and Mr. Mackey appears]
MR. MACKEY
Uh, what's going on here, Mr. Gueermo?
MR. GUEERMO
Get out of my way, Mackey. You wanna piece of this?! [Mackey doesn't reply, but he slaps him anyway] I'll slap everyone in this God damned school if I have to! [exits the gym, but returns to slap Mackey again, then leaves again]
[In the hallway, father and son hurry along.]
MR. GUEERMO
You are never going to play shooting hoops, do you understand?! [Stan watches them walk by, his plan dashed] You are going to sing and dance and be the best at it!
BRIDON
You're hurting my arm.
MR. GUEERMO
Stupid-ass boy!
STAN
[sighs deeply] Ah, shit.
[Scott's house. Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny are playing a video game.]
CARTMAN
Oh that's good, that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle. [Stan walks into the living room and stands to one side of the sofa] Yeah, nice.
STAN
You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it.
KYLE
What? Are you crazy?
CARTMAN
No way dude.
KYLE
We promised each other we would never do that, remember?
KENNY
(Yeah.)
STAN
I know, but... I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school. We're losing all our credibility. I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now. Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake.
SCOTT MALKINSON
What's so bad about hanging out with me?
CARTMAN
Shut up, Scott Malkinson. "I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes."
SCOTT
Hey, don't make fun of my diabetes!
CARTMAN
"Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson." [Kenny laughs]
STAN
You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?
KYLE
Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too.
KENNY
(Yeah!)
STAN
That isn't true! [no one challenges] Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids
SCOTT
Hey, that was supposed to be my power-up pack.
CARTMAN
"That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes."
[The Gueermo house, living room, night. Bridon looks out the window as his father dances to High School Musical on screen]
MR. GUEERMO
Yadada yadada yadada dadadadada High School Musical is so awesome. [the doorbell rings and Mr. Gueermo pauses the video and prances to the door. He opens it and two adults appear]
MALE CPS AGENT
Mister... Gueermo?
MR. GUEERMO
[barks] What?
MALE CPS AGENT
[shows his official badge] We're from Child Protective Services. [puts it away] There's some concern you might be physically abusing your child?
MR. GUEERMO
What? Who the hell's been saying that?!
FEMALE CPS AGENT
We got a phone call from a concerned student who wishes to remain anonymous.
MALE CPS AGENT
His name is Stan Marsh.
MR. GUEERMO
You'd better just turn your asses around and get back in your little car, 'cause there's a world of hurt about to come your way!
MALE CPS AGENT
Mr. Gueermo, we need to come in and have a word with your son.
MR. GUEERMO
[performs a sweeping gesture to usher them in] Oh, by all means. You got the balls to come in here?! Do it! Do it! [the agents enter and walk over to Bridon]
MALE CPS AGENT
Hello, Bridon, my name is Mr. Kelly. [Mr. Gueermo sneaks up behind him, ready to slap him at any moment] We just wanted to talk to you for a few minutes if that's okay and just maybe... [Mr. Gueermo whistles, Mr. Kelly turns around, and Mr. Gueermo slaps him]
MR. GUEERMO
Yeah! There it is! Slapped you! You probably think I'm finished, huh?! [slap] No, there's another one!
FEMALE CPS AGENT
Oh my God!
MR. GUEERMO
[moves over to the female agent] Don't worry, bitch, I didn't forget about you! [slaps her] There's a slap for you! [three slaps follow] Slap, slap, slap! [slaps Mr. Kelly three more times] Yeah, there you go! [slaps the female agent again] Here's a little reach around the back of the head slap! [slaps the female agent, then slaps Mr. Kelly. Mrs. Gueermo rushes in to intervene and take the slaps]
MRS. GUEERMO
Oh God, please, you have to get away! He won't ever stop! [he slaps her seven times]
MR. GUEERMO
Awww. I'm going slap-happy! [chases after the agents and slaps them several more times before they finally reach their car]
I'm going slap, slap-happy! Slappity slappin' you, teachin' you a lesson for coming in my house!
[the agents pull away quickly. He notices his next-door neighbor looking on from his own doorway] What are you looking at, Robertson? [in a flash he slaps Robertson three times, and just as quickly he's back inside his house and closes the front door.]
[South Park Elementary, next day, hallway. Bebe has something to say.]
BEBE
They're here! The audition results for the school musical are in! [the kids react and gather round the results sheet on the bulletin board. Butters is on a stool checking out the results for everyone]
BUTTERS
Hey, you got the lead, Wendy. [the girls congratulate her and Wendy says something in reply]
CLYDE
Who's the male lead?
BUTTERS
No surprise there. It's Bridon. [the boys and a few girls congratulate Bridon, who stays quiet] I get to be a stand-in! [moments later Wendy catches up to Bridon. Stan looks on from a distance]
WENDY
Congratulations, Bridon. Guess we'll be working a lot together.
BRIDON
[not enthused] Yeah, great.
STAN
God damn it! [walks away. The next scene is him walking down the hall] No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop. [some kids look at him and decide to follow] And now they're gonna be in a show together? Jesus, it's all over for me. [the kids begin to snap their fingers] They'll probably even have a kissing scene. What did I do to deserve this? And what am I suppose to do now? [he stops, the kids stop walking but continue snapping their fingers. Soon they smile in anticipation...]
Sooooomeooooone's in the kitchen with Dinah,
[the kids' anticipation fades. Stan isn't singing as they'd hope he would]
Someone's in the kitchen, I know.
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
Strummin' on the old banjo and go and
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o-o-o-o.
[Wendy, Bebe, and some other kids arrive]
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Strumming on the old banjo jo jo...
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
The old gray goose is...
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to...
[no one is making a sound. Stan puts his hands in his pockets, hangs his head, then turns left and walks away]
[The Gueermo house, night. Mr. Gueermo is getting ready for bed... in an unusual way.]
MR. GUEERMO
You hear the rhythm. Now is the time, the tiiiiime. It's time to go to bed. It's time to call it a day. You can reach the stars and-
MRS. GUEERMO
[enters in a panic] Oh please. You have to do something.
MR. GUEERMO
What are you interrupting me for?!
MRS. GUEERMO
It's our son, he's- he's running away.
MR. GUEERMO
What?! [rushes downstairs and stops with flair behind Bridon, who's steps away from the front door]
What's going on here, what's this all about?
[brings his arms up and out, pointing to Bridon at the end with his left hand]
What do you think you're doing?
BRIDON
Dad, I'm sick of you trying to always-
MR. GUEERMO
Nono! Sing it!
BRIDON
[throws his duffle bag down] No! I'm sick of singing!
MR. GUEERMO
Can you believe it? What'd he just say? What's the matter with kids these days?
[fixes his gaze on his wife, who's terrified for a bit.]
MRS. GUEERMO
[slowly, carefully]
Kids these days.
MR. GUEERMO
Kids these days!
[Bridon ignores him and opens the door. His father flies through the air and slams the door shut with his body]
Unh unh unh! Just go right back to your room and sing a ballad, mister!
BRIDON
Just let me go.
MR. GUEERMO
Go ahead. Make my day. [gets down on his left knee and threatens] You get upstairs, or I will slap you until there's little red handprints all over face! [Bridon punches him on the nose] Ow! [covers his nose and stands up] Oh my God, what was that? [runs to his wife] Did you see that?! Oh my God, it hurts so bad! [she punches him harder] Ow. What the "H" is going on?! [she punches him again, and he runs off, crying. Bridon looks on in awe] What are you doing?! Everyone's crazy!
[Stan's house, the same night. He's on the sofa immersing himself in the High School Musical movies. Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, and Scott enter.]
KYLE
Well, I had to see it to believe it!
CARTMAN
I told you guys. He's been watching High School Musical over and over again.
STAN
Actually, this is High School Musical 2. It has a dance-along part.
KYLE
We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!
KENNY
(Yeah, look at yourself, dude.)
STAN
Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!
KYLE
You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals!
STAN
Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody's gonna let him do a musical!
SCOTT
'At's enough, you guys, it's not cool. Lots of kids have diabetes, and you shouldn't be-
CARTMAN
You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson.
STAN
Look, guys. [gets off the sofa and walks away from the other boys] The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school. [turns around to face them] And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now, [points to them] everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you.
CARTMAN
That's a low blow, Stan.
[South Park Elementary, day, the school gym. A basketball game is in progress, five on five. Mr. Mackey and Mr. Adler are doing play-by-play. "Rock & Roll Part II" plays from the speakers]
MR. MACKEY
Third team foul on Westchester Bobcats, m'kay. Ball goes back over to the Cows.
MR. GARRETT
All right, you ready to get in there, Bridon?
BRIDON
[approaches wearing #11] I'm ready, coach.
MR. GARRETT
Give 'em hell! [Bridon goes in and faces off against the Bobcats' #9. He tosses the ball over to #7, Bradley, and then notices his parents on the bleachers. His mom waves hi, his dad looks away displeased.]
MR. MACKEY
Just a minute to go in the first quarter. [Bridon gets the ball back and shots from the top of the key for a 3 pointer. Everyone applauds him, but his father still isn't looking at him. Mr. Gueermo does, however, notice the crowd's excitement and soon gets into it himself. The song changes to "We Will Rock You" and the crowd gets into that with two stomps and a clap. Mr. Gueermo joins right in]
[South Park, next day. The kids are milling around the entrance, so classes haven't started yet.]
BEBE
Hey Bridon, how come you weren't at musical rehearsals last night?
BRIDON
I joined the basketball team. I gave up singing and dancing forever. I'm just not into it.
WENDY
You gave it up?
STAN
[walks into view with the other three boys] That's right. You know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. There's things we're all good at. And we just can't keep them bottled up inside. [music begins to play]

'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do.
Don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day. [walks up to a boy and girl]
True, girl, you know it's true,
that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do. [walks back to Bridon]
He was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball
CARTMAN
[approaches two other kids]
But he finally got the courage to answer his heart's call.
STAN
Just like me, all I ever wanted was to sing and dance.
And now that I stood up for my dream I finally have the chance.
[the four boys form a chorus line and dance]
BOYS
You've gotta do what you wanna do. Even if other people don't really want you to.
[Kyle whips off his hat while approaching two girls]
True, girl, you know it's true, [returns to the chorus line] that the thing you wanna do is the thing that you should do.
[Kyle dances away to two other girls]
KYLE
Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. [Cartman dances over to two kids]
CARTMAN
And I like nothin' better than makin' fun of Jews.
And ripping on black people, though some people think it's rude, but you gotta- [rejoins the chorus line with Kyle]
BOYS:
Do what you wanna do.
Just make sure that what you're doing is what's cool and popular with everyone
Chew, baby, chew and chew.
When you're eating jerky, if eating jerky is what you wanna do.
BEBE
[arrives with Wendy, Red, and another girl during the song] Hey Bridon, can we watch you practice basketball?
BRIDON
Uhh, sure. [the girls follow him to the gym. The other students go their separate ways.]
KYLE
Do what you want, don't have restraint.
CARTMAN
Don't stress about it or you just might faint.
KENNY
(If you wanna get high and jack off, it's cool.)
STAN
You gotta do what you wanna do!
BOYS
Do what you wanna do.
As long as what you wanna do is what everybody wants you to.
Glue, baby, buy some glue
Just in case if what you're doin' [Stan continues singing, they all keep dancing]
STAN
involves needing scissors and glue!
SCOTT
Hey guys. Hey guys! [all stop. Stan looks around and doesn't see anyone else]
STAN
Huh? [the other boys turn around]
KYLE
Where did everybody go?
SCOTT
The girls all wanted to go watch 'at Bridon kid practice basketball.
STAN
But the girls like singing and dancing.
SCOTT
No, I think the girls just like that Bridon kid, no matter what he does.
STAN
But... No, we just... No, no wait. We just got good at this! Aw!.
End of Elementary School Musical


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Butters is sure he's seen a vampire at school but he can't get anyone to listen to him. Meanwhile, the Goth Kids are angry and frustrated when the other kids can't tell the difference between a Goth and a Vampire.

script:The Ungroundable

[South Park Elementary, day, computer lab. Mr. Mackey is guiding the fourth graders through some computer operations by reading from a book.]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, so now the computer will show a command bar, m'kay, and we type in "x = y + 1". M'kay, and then it says we hit Command-Y to bring up the menu screen.
CARTMAN
Aw man, you've got to be kidding me. [Cartman is playing a WW2 shooter on his computer, with Japanese warcries sounding] Goddamn Japs are everywhere.
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, now right-click on menu item "Equate O" and type in "input y"?
KYLE
Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan? [looks like all the other kids are playing the same game: Call of Duty: World at War]
STAN
No, I'm on the Japanese side.
CARTMAN
Oh, who just shot me? [Bebe leans back in her chair, looks at Cartman, and gives him the finger]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, let's see, uh the right-click is the upper-right... [his voice trails off] uhhh, but then what the hell is the...? [closes the book and goes back to normal voice] Okay kids, I'm gonna need to get some clarification on this. Uh, just keep entering the calculations; I'll be right back, m'kay.
CARTMAN
Oh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs.
BUTTERS
[runs into the lab and hides behind the wall] Oh my God, oh my God! [runs up to Stan] Stan! Stan, we have a big problem.
STAN
Dude, what?
BUTTERS
There's vampires in the school!
STAN
What?
BUTTERS
Vampires. I've seen 'em.
STAN
Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?!
RED
Not a cheat if you rank up.
BUTTERS
Ugh. [goes over to Kenny] Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. Then Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!
KYLE
Butters, there's no such thing as vampires.
BUTTERS
[goes over to Kyle] But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything.
CARTMAN
All right Butters, well you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are.
BUTTERS
Really? Do you think that's best?
CARTMAN
Yeah, now get out of here.
BUTTERS
All right! [runs to the entrance, then turns around] If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. [turns back and runs out]
CARTMAN
Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!
[The school gym, day. Six kids sit on the bleachers in the otherwise empty building - four boys, two girls. They look somewhat like the Goth kids.]
LEAD VAMPIRE
Isn't this cool? This time of day nobody's in the gym. We should make this one of our official South Park Vampires Club hangouts.
SPIKY VAMPIRE
That's an awesome new coat, Mike. Looks totally badass.
VAMPIR
Don't call me Mike, my name is Vampir now.
SPIKY VAMPIRE
Oh, that's cool.
MIDNIGHT VAMPIRE
[wears a coat showing arm bones] I'm gonna change my name to Vladimir.
VAMPIR
You can't, it's too close to Vampir. [Butters rises up from one end of the bleachers just enough to see the vampire kids]
BUTTERS
[pulls out a tiny tape recorder and starts dictating into it] 12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader.
SPARKLY VAMPIRE
You know that girl Bella in Twilight? I think I'm like her. I'm a psi vampire. Do you like these sparkles I got?
BUTTERS
[into his recorder] Annie Bartlett is a psi vampire.
VAMPIR
Yeah, I'm more a sanguinarian vampire, in that I rely more on the life force energy, per se.
SPIKY VAMPIRE
Heh, yeah, I'm gonna be a hybrid vampire, both psi and sanguinarian.
BUTTERS
That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too.
BLOODRAYNE
Lunchtime's almost over. Should we drink some more blood?
OTHER VAMPIRES
Yeah! Cool!
VAMPIR
Yeah, and then I think it's time for us to feed, per se. [opens a bottle of Clamato and pours some into the Bloodrayne's goblet.]
BUTTERS
Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're- [clock] uhn... [he's run out of tape. It rewinds to the very beginning and plays back]
TAPE
[Butters' voice] Toot toododoo! [Butters frantically presses buttons trying to stop the tape] It's the Big Texas Butters show! And now here he is, Big Texas Butters! Why howdy there, partners. I'm Biiig Texas Butters. And this is my horse, Toast. Happy Trails, to youuu! [he turns off the tape record, relieved. Until he looks around and jumps from being startled] AAHHH!
VAMPIR
Ummm, what are you doing?
BUTTERS
[jumps away and whips out a golden cross] Get back! You stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! The body of Christ compels you! [runs away without his tape recorder] Hwaaaahh!
[The school hallway, later. Mike is at his locker]
BLOODRAYNE
That kid was really scared of us.
VAMPIR
That's true, Bloodrayne. People are going to be frightened of us because they don't understand our ways, per se.
SPIKY VAMPIRE
Yeah, we're cool, huh? [the Goth kids happen upon the Vampire kids]
PETE
What the hell are those kids doing?
HENRIETTA
Why are they all dressing like that all of a sudden?
PETE
Are they trying to be Goth?
MICHAEL
No, they're vamp. They wear plastic fangs and drink freaking Clamato juice.
HENRIETTA
But they can't dress like that. That's our style.
MIDNIGHT VAMPIRE
Hey, Tommy Petros is thinking he might wanna be a Vamp kid too.
VAMPIR
Tommy Petros? Is he cool?
BLOODRAYNE
Yeah, he's cool enough.
VAMPIR
All right. [the Vamps and Goths face each other]
PETE
So, all of a sudden you Justin and Britney wannabes think it's cool to dress like us?
VAMPIR
We dress the way our souls feel, to express the darkness, per se.
MICHAEL
Aren't you Mike Makowski?
VAMPIR
That's Vampir Makowski now.
HENRIETTA
You kids need to all go put your freakin' Banana Republic clothes back on, right now!
SPARKLY VAMPIRE
Hey, we're just as dark as you guys, maybe darker!
PETE
Really. Do you guys even smoke?
VAMPIR
Of course not. Smoking's bad for you.
OTHER VAMPS
Yeah.
PETE
[buries his face in his left hand] Oh my God.
VAMPIR
You know, you guys are really giving off a negative human energy. We prefer to take our darkness somewhere else, per se.
PETE
All right, Count Fagula, you go do that. [the Vamps leave]
[Butters' house, after school. Butters runs inside in a panic, looks around, then heads for the sofa.]
BUTTERS
Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it!
LINDA
[sewing a scarf] Not now, Butters. Your father wants to have a talk with you in the kitchen. He is not happy.
BUTTERS
Oh no, what'd I do this time?
LINDA
You just march on in there.
BUTTERS
[hangs his head and goes in] Oh jeez...
[The kitchen. Butters walks in and looks at Stephen, who's by the sink waiting with his arms crossed. To his left are a glass of milk and a box of Hamburger Helper.]
STEPHEN
You see this, Butters?! It's a glass of milk I poured for myself! And you see this?! [holds up the box] It's Hamburger Helper! Now would you mind telling me what Hamburger Helper is doing in this glass of milk?! [Butters begins to tap his fists together, nervously] Why is Hamburger Helper in a glass of milk, Butters?!
BUTTERS
I have no idea, sir.
STEPHEN
I'll tell you why! [walks over to the pantry and opens the door] Our pantry is always kept organized alphabetically! But somebody put the Hamburger Helper where the Nestle Quik is supposed to go!
BUTTERS
Uh, I'm sorry, Dad. I-It's just I've been really preoccupied lately. See, there are these kids at school, they were-
STEPHEN
What keeps a family together, Butters?!
BUTTERS
A well-organized pantry.
STEPHEN
That's right! [starts throwing food out of the pantry on to the floor] If you keep putting food under the wrong letter, it all goes wrong! [stops] Now you will reorganize this entire pantry, and you will do it right!
BUTTERS
Well, okay, but, Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-
STEPHEN
You do it right now or you're going to be grounded! You got that?!
BUTTERS
[hangs his head] Yes, sir. [Stephen walks away. Butters turns to the task at hand and begins putting stuff away] Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want. [stops and thinks]
[South Park Elementary, next day, recess. The Vamp kids are on the merry-go-round gathered around Vampir]
VAMPIR
[reading from a book] ...All mortals share a soft repose,My soul doth dreadful vigils keep, More keen than which hell scarcely knows.
SPARKLY VAMPIRE
What is that kid doing?
BUTTERS
[walks towards them with hands outstretched] Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing? [pulls out the crucifix he used on them a few days before and sets it down on the snow, then continues towards them, hands outstretched] I- I'm Butters.
VAMPIR
So?
BUTTERS
O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!
VAMPIR
What?
BUTTERS
Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire.
COWLICK VAMPIRE
You're not cool enough to be one of us.
BUTTERS
Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity.
VAMPIR
We'll think about it. Go get us some sodas out of the pop machine in the commons.
BUTTERS
Yes! Yes, anything else?
MIDNIGHT VAMPIRE
I want some Cheetos.
BUTTERS
Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back.
[The Goth Corner at South Park Elementary. The Goth kids are listening to music as a soccer ball rolls to a stop in front of them.]
SINGER
I'm not part of your society. I don't follow your fads and rules. Doctrines...
BOY 1
[with dark blond hair] Where did it go? Do you see where it went?
BOY 2
[with black hair] Yeah, it's right over there by those vampire kids. [Boy 1 retrieves the ball and walks away]
PETE
[delayed reaction] What? Hey. Hey! We aren't vampire kids, we're freakin' Goths!
BOY 1
Whatever, Dracula, why don't you turn into a bat or something?
MICHAEL
So lame. So... lame...
HENRIETTA
You guys, I do not wanna be grouped in with douchey, little vampire kids.
MICHAEL
Sooo lame! [two Vamps walk out of the door behind him]
LITTLE VAMP
See? Isn't it cool back here? It's all dark and isolated.
SHADES VAMP
This would be a great place for a Vampire meeting.
HENRIETTA
Get out of our space, you little twerps!
PETE
More preppy straight-A students turning into vampires. What the hell is going on?
[The woods, night. Butters is walking through them with drinks and some food. He reaches a small campfire where five of the six Vamps wait for him. Vampir is missing.]
BUTTERS
I have done what you've asked. [sets down the goods] A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food.
VAMPIR
[walks into view] You have done well. Are you ready to become one of us, per se?
BUTTERS
Yeah, I guess.
VAMPIR
Are you sure? Because once you're in South Park Vampire Society, you can't ever leave.
BUTTERS
Well I'm sick of bein'- bein' pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school.
VAMPIR
Then it is time for your transformation, per se. Let it begin! [they all walk away, leaving behind the Dr. Pepper and Twizzlers. They walk to South Park Mall] This way. Prepare thyself. [the mall is still open, so they walk over to Hot Topic and enter. The Vamps begin checking out clothes for Butters to wear as a new Vamp. The Midnight Vamp gets some fake teeth with fangs while the Cowlick Vamp gets some necklaces and rings. They outfit Butters with them. The Sparkly Vamp gets some hairspray and she and the Spiky Vamp spray Butters' hair with it. Bloodrayne measures him for collars and bracelets. Finally, all six Vamps step away, and a new Vamp is born]
BUTTERS
Whoa.
VAMPIR
And now you shall drink vampire blood, and your transformation will be complete, per se! [walks away and pours out a bottle of Clamato juice into a goblet for Butters to drink] With this, thy transformation is done. [Butters takes a sip, then immediately spits it out]
BUTTERS
Oh, that tastes awful! Blagh, blagh. [the Vamps leave Hot Topic]
VAMPIR
It is finished! Welcome, Butters, to the South Park Society of Vampires. [Butters begins to laugh, then cackle.]
[Butters' home, night. He walks into the living room, and Stephen runs up to him]
STEPHEN
There you are, Butters! Do you know what time it is?! Where have you been?! [Butters just walks by]
LINDA
Butters, what have you done to your hair? [Butters heads for the stairs]
STEPHEN
Hey! Butters, we are talking to you! Explain yourself, mister! [Butters stops]
BUTTERS
I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father!
LINDA
What on Earth?
STEPHEN
That does it! You are grounded for two weeks, you got that?!
BUTTERS
You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable. [smiles knowingly. His parents are perplexed]
STEPHEN
All right, I don't know what's gotten into you, mister, but you're gonna- [Butters hisses at him] Ah!
LINDA
Butters? [Butters hisses at them a few times, and Linda clings to Stephen. Butters goes upstairs]
BUTTERS
I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se. [his parents are stunned and just look at each other.]
[Principal's Office, day]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Now, kids, I understand that you are very into this "vampire" thing, but I don't want to see it get out of hand. You kids need to understand that your new little fad is scary to some.
PETE
...Oh my God. You've got the wrong flippin' people.
MICHAEL
[slowly, for emphasis] We aren't vampires.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I know that you aren't really vampires, and I appreciate that you wanna be cool because vampires are the "in" thing right now, but-
PETE
We aren't trying to be popular!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
-but just make sure that this new little trend doesn't become a distraction. [the door opens behind the Goths]
MR. MACKEY
[enters with Vampir and two younger Vamps] Here's a couple more, Principal Victoria, hm'kay.
VAMPIR
Oh, oh no, are we in trouble?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I was just telling your friends about what I expect of your-
MICHAEL
[slowly, for emphasis] We aren't friends!
VAMPIR
Don't worry, Ma'am. As I was just explaining to my new minions, vampires are actually very spiritual and deep beings, per se.
[The waiting room outside the Principal's office. The Goths exit and immediately whip out smokes and lighters]
MICHAEL
Allison Mertz is a vampire kid now? This thing isn't going to stop.
PETE
Let's just face it: they bogarted our style! Everyone's gonna think we're trying to be butthole vampires now. We might as well go to the freakin' Gap and just buy normal clothes. [they all look at each other thoughtfully]
[Goth Corner, a day or two later. The Goths are now dressed as normal kids, but their hair is still colored as before.]
PETE
Well, at least nobody can refer to us as vampire kids now. [the soccer ball bounces towards the Goth kids again and stops in front of Henrietta]
BOY 1
It went this way?
BOY 3
[with very short hair] Yeah, it's over there by that fat girl, the big-nosed kid, the midget, and the kid with pock marks on his face. [Boy 1 sees the ball, walks over, picks it up, and leaves]
MICHAEL
So we're back to that, are we?
FIRKLE
Shit.
PETE
[stands up] Let's get out of these freakin' Gap clothes.
[Cartman's room, night. He's asleep with the covers off. All of a sudden, Butters is perched on the inside of Cartman's window doors. The other one is open. Butters hisses.]
BUTTERS
Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee. [he jumps down from the window and hops onto Cartman's bed, ready to pounce on his throat. He wiggles his fingers, then relaxes them and grips Cartman's head and back] Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. [rears back and bites into Cartman's neck, making sucking sounds. Cartman wakes up and looks at him]
CARTMAN
Butters? [Butters continues] Butters?! [Butters backs up and then hops off the bed]
BUTTERS
I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!
CARTMAN
Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey!
BUTTERS
I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna... [he vomits on Cartman's floor]
CARTMAN
Dude! [Liane enters]
LIANE
You all right, sweetie?
BUTTERS
[advances and hisses at Liane, then runs out through the window and crashes to the ground outside.] U-huh. [bumps into something] Ow.
LIANE
What's going on?
CARTMAN
Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor!
LIANE
Oh dear.
CARTMAN
Yes.
[Henrietta's room, later. The Goth kids are hanging out there.]
MICHAEL
I walked into the cafeteria today. Rebecca Miller and Philip Russ were dressed like vampires drinking Clamato juice with four kids from the football team.
FIRKLE
Jesus.
PETE
It's like, there's more vampire kids every freakin' day. Why is this happening, I mean... why now?
MICHAEL
Doesn't matter why. Pretty soon, the whole school is going to be an endless hive of conformist happy-go-lucky vampire wannabes.
HENRIETTA
It seems like that preppy Mike Makowski kid started all this. Maybe he's the way to stopping it.
PETE
Whattaya mean?
HENRIETTA
I mean, what do you do when you want to change vampires back to normal? You get rid of the head vampire.
[A car night. The Goth kids are in it, with Henrietta at the wheel]
PETE
Does your mom know you took her car?
HENRIETTA
Do I care?
MICHAEL
All right, this is probably good enough.
PETE
Yeah, pull over here. [Henrietta pulls over, and the Goth kids leave the car. Henrietta stops by the trunk and pops it open. Inside is Vampir, all tied up.]
VAMPIR
[tied up and gagged] (Please, what do you want?! Let me go!)
MICHAEL
What should we do with him?
PETE
Well, if he's a vampire, I guess we should drive a stake through his heart.
VAMPIR
(No! I'm not really a vampire! I'm not a vam-, I'm not a vampire!)
MICHAEL
[leans in and puts his hand to his left ear] What's that?
VAMPIR
(I'm not really a vampire.)
MICHAEL
You're not really a vampire? Really? I'm so freaking shocked. [moves off and joins the other Goths]
PETE
If we get the right packaging, we can just FedEx him somewhere far way.
MICHAEL
How about we send him to Transylvania?
PETE
No, he'd probably see it as something to brag about someday to his little vampire buddies.
HENRIETTA
If we're gonna send him somewhere, it should be the most horrible, most miserable place on Earth.
GOTHS
[after a few seconds of contemplation] Scottsdale.
[The Stotch house. Butters' parents are upstairs. Linda is pounding on the door trying to get Butters to open it.]
LINDA
Butters, we just got a call from Mrs. Cartman. Butters? [tries to open the door, but finds it locked] Unbelievable! He's locked the door. [She and Stephen change places and Stephen tries opening the door, but it won't open. He pounds on the door.]
STEPHEN
Butters, this is your father! Explain why you snuck into another boy's bedroom and gave him a hickey! [Butters is in his bed, his arms crossed over his chest. On the headboard are four lit candles. He's hyperventilating] Butters?! Butters, you will open this door right now!
BUTTERS
What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.
STEPHEN
Butters, you have five seconds to unlock this door! [counts up with his fingers] One! Two! [the door is unlocked and opened a little. Stephen pushes the door in and it creaks. Stephen and Linda enter slowly. They see his window is wide open and he's not in bed. There are lit candles everywhere] Uhh, Bu-Butters?
BUTTERS
Hey Dad. [he's crouching on top of his bookcase and startles Stephen]
STEPHEN
AAAARH! Buh. Bu-Butters, did you get gay with one of your schoolmates tonight?!
BUTTERS
I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.
STEPHEN
[angrily] All right! Now you listen, and you listen good! Until you stop behaving this way, you are not going to leave this room! Do you understand?!
BUTTERS
Dahhh. [hops down from the bookcase and tries to hop onto his toy box, but he trips and lands on the floor. He gets up, climbs onto the toy box and crouches on the window sill, and hisses at them] I know now what I have to do! [hops down to the ground outside] Myah!
LINDA
[walks over to the open window] Stephen, what has happened to our boy?
STEPHEN
[joins her there] He's become something, Linda. Something that... we cannot ground.
[Village Inn, night. The Goths are inside drinking coffee and moping around]
MICHAEL
I just. Don't. Get it. We sent the head vampire kid to Scottsdale, but still more and more kids are dressing up like vampires.
HENRIETTA
He must not have been what was causing it. It must be something else.
WAITRESS
Hey you kids gonna order any food or just sit there and drink coffee all night again? [pours them another round]
HENRIETTA
Leave us alone!
WAITRESS
Bad enough I always get stuck with you Goth kids, now I got Goth kids in my entire section. [she points to them with her left thumb; there are two booths bursting with Vamps. One has seven Vamps, the other has nine]
PETE
They aren't Goth! They're douchey little vampire kids!
WAITRESS
Looks the same to me.
PETE
I bet they aren't even drinking coffee.
WAITRESS
[turns to face the Vamps] No, they said they're too young to drink caffeine, so they're havin' orange juice. [turns left and walks away. Pete drops his head on the table and keeps it there]
HENRIETTA
Let's go over there and tell them they're not taking Village Inn from us too.
PETE
Forget it! It's over, all right? There's too many of them now. We can't stop them. Let's just face it. Freakin' vampires beat us.
BUTTERS
Maybe not. [hisses. He's on all fours on the ledge behind the booths] Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires? [crawls closer to the Goths] I want to help you.
HENRIETTA
Get away, douchebag.
BUTTERS
Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again.
PETE
What are you talking about?
BUTTERS
I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires. [the Goths look at each other]
[South Park Mall, sometime later. Butters leads the Goths to the Place of Transformation, Hot Topic.]
PETE
Awww, Hot Topic? When did this open?
BUTTERS
Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.
MICHAEL
Of course. Freaking Hot Topic. That explains everything.
PETE
How did we not figure that out? Of course a new Hot Topic must have come to town. Duh!
HENRIETTA
Well, I think we all know what has to be done.
MICHAEL
Yup.
PETE
Let's get to it. [they turn and head into the store. They get aerosol cans and fan out across the store, start spraying, and light the sprays with their lighters, turning the cans into makeshift flamethrowers]
SINGER
Burn down down, burn down Hot Topic.
Don't let it steal your soul away.
Burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
Light the fire. Take control.
Burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
Don't let it take your soul.
Burn down, burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
And take control.
Burn down... Hot Topic.
Burn it down... Hot Topic.
[While the song is playing, the following happens: Michael is the first to torch some clothes. Henrietta follows with the belts and scarves. Pete begins to torch the jewelry]
CLERK
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
PETE
You should probably get out of here. [Firkle torches some clothes. Henrietta torches the fake teeth and products with fangs on them. Michael torches the sign announcing 25% off body jewelry and fashion belts. Outside, Bloodrayne and the Spiky Vamp arrive in shock]
SPIKY VAMP
What the hell are they doing??
BUTTERS
They're putting an end to it! [the clerk runs out of the store]
CLERK
AAAAAAAAAAAAH! [the Goths continue torching the store until it's thoroughly engulfed in flames, then they walk out and leave. The Hot Topic sign above the entrance crashes to the floor.]
[The Stotch house, night. Linda is sewing again, Stephen is reading the South Park Gazette.]
BUTTERS
[enters the living room happily] Mom, Dad! [closes the front door, runs to the sofa, and stands on the sofa between them.] I changed back!
STEPHEN
What?
BUTTERS
Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!
LINDA
We have no idea what you're talking about, Butters, but we're glad you're home.
STEPHEN
That's right son. There's only one thing I care about.
BUTTERS
What's that, Dad?
STEPHEN
Well, would you mind telling me why there's Rice-A-Roni in my coffee?!
BUTTERS
Uh oh.
STEPHEN
Butters, you are grounded!
BUTTERS
Aw, dang it![walks up the stairs to his room.]
STEPHEN
It worked, Linda. Our son is groundable once more. [they hug each other]
[The South Park Elementary School gym, day. The Goth kids address the rest of the school, who are seated on the bleachers]
PETE
[at the mic] Fellow students. Over the past week there's been a lot of confusion, and so we have asked for this assembly to clarify the difference between Goth kids and Vampire kids. Let us make it abundantly clear: if you hate life, truly hate the sun, and need to smoke and drink coffee, you are Goth. If, however, you like dressing in black 'cause it's "fun", enjoy putting sparkles on your cheeks and following the occult while avoiding things that are bad for your health, then you are most likely a douchebag vampire wannabe boner. Because anybody who thinks they are actually a vampire is freaking retarded. [everyone begins to applaud the speech. During the applause, Michael steps up to the mic and gives everyone the finger]
MICHAEL
Fuck all of you.
