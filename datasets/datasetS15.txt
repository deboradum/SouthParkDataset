synopsis:Kyle is intimately involved in the development of a revolutionary new product called HumancentiPad.

script:HUMANCENTiPAD

[South Park Elementary School Playground, day. The kids are out for recess. Bill and another boy are tossing a ball at each other. Scott Malkinson and Red are chatting nearby. On the merry-go-round the four main boys as well as Clyde and Butters are gathered, each of them holding an iPad]
CARTMAN
Oh my God, isn't it awesome having an iPad, you guys? [Bebe walks by, and Cartman jumps up to approach her] Hey Bebe, where's your iPad? Oh right, you're not cool enough! [laughs at her, and she walks off disgusted. Tolkien walks by] Hey, hey, did you see my iPad, Tolkien? Funny, you don't seem to have one! I thought your family was rich! [Tolkien walks on, but is puzzled by Cartman's behavior. Cartman sees four kids playing four-square and jeers at them] Haha! You dumbasses have to play four-square 'cause you don't have iPads! [checks his iPad and starts pacing] Oh, what should I do on my iPad next? Think I'll email some of my friends. Oh no, wait! Maybe I'll download some more cool apps! [smiles. Craig comes up behind him] This is so awesome! [Craig taps him on the shoulder and Cartman turns around]
CRAIG
Tom Saltzman says you don't really have an iPad.
CARTMAN
[stares at him for a second] What?
CRAIG
Tom Saltzman says you just glued a piece of glass to an iPad cover and you're faking it. [Cartman looks at him, then looks around to see if anyone is within earshot]
CARTMAN
Tom Saltzman's dad is an alcoholic who drinks and drives! [looks around again]
STAN
Let me see your iPad, Cartman.
CARTMAN
Seriously you guys! Tom Saltzman's dad is a drunk driver. He's the one who ran over Joey Potts's dog because Joey Potts doesn't know how to take care of his animals, which is why he gets beat by his mom! [Craig looks off into the distance, surprised]
KYLE
Just let us see your iPad, Cartman.
CARTMAN
No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power!
KYLE
So, plug it in.
CARTMAN
I left my charger at home! [the boys are still waiting] Fine! I'm gonna go home and charge my iPad and bring it tomorrow, and you guys are gonna feel really stupid! [walks away angrily]
[Cartman's house, after school. Cartman enters, still pissed off, and closes the door behind him]
CARTMAN
Well good going, Mom! You completely screwed me over!
LIANE
[reading a book on the sofa, with her legs tucked under a blanket] What happened, Eric?
CARTMAN
YOU said I had to wait till my birthday to get an iPad! So the one I rubbed in everyone's faces today isn't real and tomorrow everyone's gonna call me a liar. Would you mind loaning me some of your lipstick, Mom? Because I wanna at least look pretty the next time you decide to FUCK me!
[A Sizzler restaurant. Kyle is demonstrating his iPad to a man]
KYLE
You see? And then I can take all my homework on my iPad, and swipe it over to my iPhone.
MAN
Oh. Yeah, Apple's stuff is pretty neat alright. I just don't want any big company tracking where I am at all times. [walks off with his tray]
KYLE
Aw, that's just a rumor. They don't really track y- [the doors fly open and three men rush in]
APPLE MAN 1
There he is! [The men approach him] Hello Kyle, we're from Apple. We're all ready for you now. [a second man pulls out a scale and sets it on the floor]
KYLE
What? Ready for what?
APPLE MAN 1
To fulfill the agreement. Can we get a weight please? [the third man lifts Kyle up and puts him on the scale]
APPLE MAN 2
83 pounds, sir.
KYLE
What "agreement"?!
APPLE MAN 1
83 pounds, good. Let's get the bloodwork.
KYLE
Hey! You can't do that! [the second man pulls out a tape measure to measure the circumference of Kyle's head, the third man prepares to take Kyle's blood]
APPLE MAN 1
You agreed we could take all the blood we needed.
KYLE
What are you talking about?!
APPLE MAN 1
When you downloaded the last iTunes update a window on your screen popped up and asked you if you agreed to our terms and conditions. You clicked "Agree." Alright, let's get him to the water tank.
KYLE
The water tank? [gets off the scale and away from the men] Hey I'm not going with you!
APPLE MAN 1
You've agreed to all of this! [Kyle runs out of the restaurant] Hey!
[Someone is listening to an iListenToMusic, a sound system dock for the iPhone. The camera pulls back to reveal Kenny, Butters, Stan, Clyde, and Jimmy playing basketball at the local park.]
KYLE
[off-camera] You guys! [runs onto the basketball court] You gotta help me. These business casual G-men are trying to kidnap me!
STAN
What?
KYLE
It's crazy, dude! They're saying it's because I agreed to the latest terms and conditions on iTunes!
STAN
Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say?
KYLE
I don't know, I didn't read them!
BUTTERS
You didn't read them?
KYLE
Who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up?
STAN
[earnestly] I do.
CLYDE
Me too.
KYLE
You're telling me that every time you guys download an update for iTunes, you read the entire terms and conditions?
JIMMY
Of course.
BUTTERS
Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?
KYLE
Well, I turned off all my Apple stuff. They can't locate you if you don't have your stuff on, right? [at that moment two limousines pull up and men begin pouring out of them]
APPLE MAN 1
There he is. Hey, you!
KYLE
Gahhh! [runs away]
[Gerald's law firm, day. He is at his desk typing away on his keyboard. Kyle runs in and closes the door]
KYLE
Dad! Dad, I need a lawyer!
GERALD
Kyle? What are you doing here?
KYLE
Dad, if you agree to something but you didn't mean to agree to it, what do you do?!
GERALD
Well, Kyle, it's always the agreeing party's responsibility to know what they are signing.
KYLE
But it's like eight pages long and they send me a new one like every three weeks! How can they know if I-
GERALD
Calm down, Kyle! It's okay. You're safe with Daddy. [the office window slides up and one of the Apple G-Men looks in]
APPLE MAN 1
Here he is!
KYLE
AAHH!
APPLE MAN 1
Come on you!
GERALD
Hey, what the heck is going on?
APPLE MAN 1
Your son has made a binding and legal agreement with Apple, sir.
GERALD
An agreement to do what?!
APPLE MAN 1
Apple's inner workings are top secret to all users. You know how it is.
GERALD
No, I don't know how it is. I use a PC.
APPLE MAN 1
[chuckles] You what?
APPLE MAN 4
Come on, let's go!
GERALD
Hey now, let him go! [Apple Man 1 tasers him and he goes down in pain]
KYLE
Dad! You tasered my dad!
APPLE MAN 1
You said we could.
[Best Buy, day. Cartman runs in with glee as his mom lags behind.]
CARTMAN
Okay, WiFi+3G, 64 gigs. This one, this one!
LIANE
Oh, sweetie, $900?
CARTMAN
I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's stupid face when he sees my iPad has more memory than his!
LIANE
Eric, we can't afford that one.
CARTMAN
Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?
LIANE
I think we need to get you a different brand, hon. They're a little cheaper.
CARTMAN
Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid!
LIANE
[sees something interesting] Here, look at this one. Toshiba Handibook.
CARTMAN
Toshiba Handibook?
LIANE
This says it does everything the iPad does, at half the price!
CARTMAN
Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!
LIANE
Eric, stop acting like a spoiled brat! You can either have the Toshiba Handibook or you can have nothing at all!
CARTMAN
[looks at her for a second] Oh, I've got a better idea! Why don't you go across the street and buy some condoms?! Because we should at least be safe if you're gonna fuck me, Mom!
LIANE
[sternly] Eric!
CARTMAN
You might as well go buy some cigarettes too, because I like to have a smoke after I get good and fucked! Do you wanna fuck me Mom?! [everyone is now staring at the two of them] Just say so! Go ahead! Here! [pulls down his pants to moon his mom, who puts her hands over her mouth] Huh?! Go ahead, Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me right here in the Best Buy! You wanna fuck your son so bad?! Go on Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me!
[Liane's car, night. An angry Liane is driving and Cartman is crying]
LIANE
Stop crying, Eric! I told you if you kept acting up, you weren't getting anything!
CARTMAN
[sniffles] But I told you I was sorry.
LIANE
You made me look like some sort of child molester in front of all those PEOPLE!
CARTMAN
I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.
LIANE
Then why did you go outside to a police officer and say "Help! Help! My mom is trying to fuck me!"?!
CARTMAN
[looks around for something to come back with] Oh wait, I get it now! The F-word is a no-no word, and I shouldn't say it around other people. I'm sorry Mama.
LIANE
If you're really sorry, then you'll understand why you aren't getting ANYTHING!!
CARTMAN
[sniffles] Well, now that doesn't really have any logical sense, Mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad. Mama. Please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook?
LIANE
NO!!!
CARTMAN
Well then can we at least pull up here and get some dinner? 'Cause I like to be wined and dined after I've been FUCKED! [bangs at the dashboard with his fists]
[A holding cell. The cell door opens and Kyle is tossed into it. Kyle quickly gets up and tries to open the door, futilely. He bangs at the door, then turns around to see who else is in there. A woman cowers in one corner, Junichi Takiyama sits in another]
WOMAN
What are you going to do to us??
KYLE
What is this? What's going on?
WOMAN
You... You agreed to the iTunes terms and conditions too??
KYLE
...What?
WOMAN
I just clicked "Agree." I didn't read it! I was in a hurry, you see, and I, I, I didn't know what I was agreeing to!
JUNICHI
(In Japanese Accent) I can't even read Engrish!
GUARD
[a small window slides open above Kyle and the guard looks in] Hey, shut up in there! You all agreed to stay quiet!
KYLE
Hey! Hey, let me out of here! This is a mistake! I agreed by accident!
GUARD
You can't agree by accident. There's a fail-safe built-in. Even if you click on "Agree" another little window pops up that says "Are you sure you agree?" and you have to click on "Agree" again.
WOMAN
Uh, what are you going to do to us??
GUARD
Everything that you agreed to in the iTunes conditions.
KYLE
We didn't read them!
GUARD
Heh! Riiight. Who just agrees to something they don't read? [slides the steel window closed]
[The Big Event for the new iPad. The lights go down on a barren stage with the Apple logo in the background. A podium with an Apple computer is nearby]
ANNOUNCER
And now, the president of Apple, Steve Jobs! [Jobs walks onstage as the audience applauds, waves, and stops on his mark]
STEVE JOBS
Hello everyone, I'm here to announce a new product that will once again revolutionize the way we use our phones and tablet devices. Let's hear it for our volunteers! [Klieg lights focus on another part of the stage. The curtains there open and the volunteers are shown: Junichi, Kyle, and the woman, all in hospital beds. The platform they're on rolls forward as Jobs approaches it] These three people have agreed to be brought here, handcuffed to these beds, and become the prototype of our first truly-interfaced device.
KYLE
The first what?
STEVE JOBS
[walks back to his starting position] They have actually agreed to be surgically altered. [a projection appears on a huge white board] Their lips will be removed and they will be sewn together mouth to anus.
WOMAN
What??
STEVE JOBS
[looks at and tells the woman] You agreed to this! [back to the projection] Mouth to anus so that the feces so that the gastral tract from one will enter the mouth of the little boy - [looks over at Kyle] and he agreed this was okay - enter the mouth of the little boy, leading through his anus to the mouth of the female - who completely agreed; they all agreed - which will then go to a tablet device, making a product that is part human, and part centipede, and part Web browser, and part emailing device! I give you... the HUMANCENTiPad!
JUNICHI
(In Japanese Accent) Oho... I should habu never appudeitedo iTunes!
[Kyle's bedroom. Butters is at the computer reading the monitor]
BUTTERS
"You agree that Apple may charge your credit card or Paypal account for any products purchased in the iTunes store."
GERALD
Can somebody please explain to me what is going on?!
STAN
We're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to.
GERALD
There can't be anything in that agreement that allows a company to do what they're talking about to Kyle!
BUTTERS
Hold up. Here it is right here: "by clicking Agree, you are also acknowledging that Apple may sew your mouth to the butthole of another iTunes user"
STAN
Oh boy.
BUTTERS
"Apple and its subsidiaries may also, if necessary, sew yet another person's mouth onto your butthole, making you a being that shares one gastral tract." Hmmm, I'm gonna click onnn... "Decline."
GERALD
Well that does it! I'm going to the police!
STAN
For what?
GERALD
To find out where Apple is keeping my son!
STAN
Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! You guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses.
BUTTERS
The Geniuses...
KENNY
(The Geniuses...)
[Apple Headquarters, day. Steve Jobs looks over the new prototype, even getting on his knees to check out the underside of the thing]
STEVE JOBS
Alright. Good. Looks good, guys. Great work. [the camera lowers enough to reveal the volunteers sewn in place whimpering]
JUNICHI
Nanda... Nanda kore?! ["What... what is this?!"]
STEVE JOBS
Really nice, guys. [stands up] I remember when the first version of the iPad came out. People couldn't believe how easy it was to take their videos, music, and photos, and all their shit, [walks towards a massive LCD screen on which is a map of the world and the words "WHERE EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD IS RIGHT NOW" above it] and share it, with other people, who could do the same with all their shit. The only thing the iPad couldn't do was walk or read. Until now.
KYLE
[with his mouth sewn onto Junichi's ass and bandages bound around them to make sure it stays that way] (I need some help! I can't take it!)
STEVE JOBS
[walks up to Kyle and leans down to hear him better] What, what what's that? What's that you're saying?
KYLE
(I can't take it! I want out right now!)
STEVE JOBS
Yeah you want out? Are you saying you want out?
KYLE
(Yes! Please! Let me go!)
STEVE JOBS
Fine. You don't want to be part of this? Then just sign right here. [whips out another contract. Kyle looks at the contract, then just signs it] Nooo! You didn't read it! This says we don't ever have to let you out and that we can do whatever we want! [walks up to his staff, frustrated] Dammit, why won't it read?!
APPLE TECH
It's probably low on power. We should feed it.
STEVE JOBS
[carries a bag to the head of the centipede, Junichi] Alright. Here you go, come on.
JUNICHI
(In Japanese Accent) Nooo! [enunciating slowly] I will not eat if they are forced to iito my poo!
STEVE JOBS
Perhaps I didn't mention... [pulls out something from the bag] it's a bean and cheese burrito from Paco's.
JUNICHI
[gasps] (In Japanese Accent) Sori, Kairu. I tried to resist but burrito isu too dericious! [takes it and wolfs it down. Jobs goes back to his staff]
STEVE JOBS
We have to unveil this thing tomorrow. It better be reading by then!
JUNICHI
(In Japanese Accent) Oh, oh no... feel sick...
KYLE
(You're fine!)
JUNICHI
Oooho, oooh! [poops into Kyle's mouth violently]
KYLE
(Yaaaaah!) [poops into the woman's mouth violently]
WOMAN
(Aaaaaah!)
[Dr. Phil. Graphics move around]
ANNOUNCER
Today, on Dr. Phil. The tragic story of a little boy whose mother constantly tries to fuck him.
DR. PHIL
I want you all to meet Eric Cartman, who's a very special boy with a very hard life. Eric, you say that your mom fucks you?
CARTMAN
Yes! She fucks me so hard!
DR. PHIL
Does this happen often? Does she- does she fuck you a lot?
CARTMAN
Dude, Filipino hookers don't get fucked the way I do!
AUDIENCE
Ohhh...
DR. PHIL
Now, I know this is very difficult for you to talk about, but... where was the last time your mother fucked you?
CARTMAN
At Best Buy.
AUDIENCE
Ahhh...
DR. PHIL
Your mother fucked you at Best Buy?
CARTMAN
Uh huh.
DR. PHIL
And people saw her doing this?
CARTMAN
Yes!
DR. PHIL
And they didn't do anything?
CARTMAN
No!
LIANE
[making her way to the stage] Eric, stop it!
CARTMAN
Oh, there she is! There's my mom right now! [Dr. Phil crosses his arms]
AUDIENCE
Booooooo!
CARTMAN
Booooooo!
LIANE
Eric, you come home, right now!
AUDIENCE
Booooooo!
DR. PHIL
Ma'am, why do you think it's okay to fuck your son?
LIANE
I DON'T!
CARTMAN
She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday...
AUDIENCE
[shocked] Awwwwww!
CARTMAN
You know, Mom, the least you could do is kiss me first. 'Cause I liked to be kissed before I get fucked!
MAN 1
You fuck your son and you won't even give him a kiss? Booooooo!
MAN 2
[seated with his arm around a boy] If I was gonna fuck my son, I'd kiss him first! [kisses the boy on the forehead slowly]
DR. PHIL
Well Eric, we have a very special gift we wanna give you.
CARTMAN
[suddenly bright with hope] An iPad??? [dances in his chair]
[The Apple store, day. Stan, Gerald, Butters, and Kenny wait to speak to a Genius]
ANNOUNCER
Gerald Broflovski.
STAN
Okay, the Geniuses will see us now. [the group leaves their seats and head to the Genius bar, but Stan stops them midway] Now remember: when you speak to the Geniuses keep your questions short and to the point. The Geniuses do not like those who waste their time. [Stan leads the group forward]
[The Genius Bar. A fat Genius is at his station as the group arrives]
LESLIE
Hi, my name is Leslie. I'll be your Genius.
STAN
Genius Leslie, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom.
LESLIE
What problems are you experiencing?
GERALD
My son was kidnapped by Apple and they are holding him against his will!!
LESLIE
Oh-kay, well I'm sorry you're having trouble with that today. Could I have his Apple ID?
STAN
69ingchipmunks@me.com [Gerald is surprised]
LESLIE
Okay. [types away on his laptop, pauses to read a reply, resumes typing...]
GERALD
[loses his cool] Well what the heck does this w-! [Stan shushes him]
LESLIE
Oh okay. I see. Hmm. Hmm, I might need to bring another Genius in on this. [turns to his left] Frothgar?
FROTHGAR
[walks up] Uh huh?
LESLIE
This guy's son was abducted by us? [Frothgar takes over and starts typing into the laptop] Should I run a stop-check or just give him store credit?
GERALD
No I don't want store credit, I want my son back!
FROTHGAR
'Kay, this says he agreed to be taken and made part of any experiments Apple wants to perform.
STAN
Yeah, but it's all a mistake. He actually didn't read the agreement.
FROTHGAR
[scratches his head] He didn't read it?
BUTTERS
We know. It's preposterous.
FROTHGAR
Hrrrrgh. [resumes typing]
LESLIE
Sooo, just give them store credit?
[Apple Headquarters, night. The HumancentiPad is in a cage in the darkness. Junichi grabs the cage's bars]
JUNICHI
Aarrrgh. Dame kore! ["This can't be!" He then says something else, and then...] (In Japanese Accent) So sori Kairu, but I am starving! Which would you rather I eat? Should I iito cuttlefish and asparagus, or the vanilla peisuto?
KYLE
(Vanilla paste! Vanilla paste!)
JUNICHI
(In Japanese Accent) Cuttlefish and asparagus?
KYLE
(No! That's not what I said! Vanilla paste!)
JUNICHI
(In Japanese Accent) Very well I will iito the cuttlefish. [begins to gobble that down]
KYLE
(NOOOO!) [a door flies open and a group of men rush in]
RESCUER 1
Go, go! Come on guys, come on! Go! [reaches the cage and genuflects next to it] Don't worry. We're here to help you. [cuts the lock open with some bolt cutters and opens the cage door]
JUNICHI
(In Japanese Accent) Oh! Oh, thank you! Thank you! [the rescuer shushes him]
RESCUER 1
Come on, hurry! We have an ambulance waiting outside.
[The ambulance. The rescuer is restless and the sirens are on, the lights are flashing...]
RESCUER 1
Just try to stay calm. We're gonna have to try and get you separated right away!
JUNICHI
(In Japanese Accent) Yes, please hurry! That cuttlefish and asparagus is noto sitting well.
[The hospital. The rescuers rush the HumancentiPad into the ER]
RESCUER 1
We got it! We got it! Doctor, can you take this thing apart?!
DOCTOR
If I'm going to perform surgery, I need permission. [shows Kyle a new agreement] Sign this release so we can operate.
KYLE
(Yes. Yes, hurry up.) [a buzzer sounds and the ER splits in two, revealing that it was all a setup to see if Kyle would finally read an agreement before signing it. The whole grouped just went around the headquarters and back in. Steve Jobs appears and walks up to the HumancentiPad]
STEVE JOBS
No, dammit! It didn't read it! End of simulation, end of simulation! [the 'medical staff' splits up and walks off, while the doctor walks away from the corporation building] What is wrong with you people?! Why can't you get the HumancentiPad to read?!
RESCUER
We're sorry, sir. We really thought we'd get it to read this time.
JUNICHI
(In Japanese Accent) Oh no! Cuttlefish is about to come out ofu asshole!
KYLE
(Oh, shit!)
JUNICHI
(In Japanese Accent) Here it comes! Oh, it's going to be arot! Hold on, Kairu! I believe in youuuuuu!!! [craps into Kyle's mouth violently. A second later, Kyle craps into the woman's mouth violently. A second later the woman craps onto the iPad's back, and the iPad lights up with a soft bell sound]
[The Apple Store, day. Gerald, Stan, Butters, and Kenny are still waiting for more information from the Geniuses. Frothgar supervises Leslie as Leslie types on the laptop]
FROTHGAR
Yeap. A-and then you should be able to do a customer check, uh huh.
LESLIE
Okay, that should do it. Sorry Apple kidnapped your friend, guys. But I believe we have it all cleared up.
GERALD
You do??
LESLIE
Yeah, we got you a replacement friend. You should be all good to go.
REPLACEMENT FRIEND
Hi guys.
STAN
[looks at the boy] No, we don't want a replacement friend, we want our friend.
FROTHGAR
[sighs] We're gonna have to bring more Geniuses in on this.
LESLIE
Yeah, I think we should have a quickening, with all the Geniuses.
FROTHGAR
I'll summon the council.
LESLIE
Okay, if you guys just wait here a sec we're gonna have a quickening with the Council of Geniuses. See what we can do for you.
[A clearing in the store. Six Geniuses gather around and begin to communicate with light beams. Leslie opens her mouth and a beam of light goes to Frothgar, who opens his mouth and lets out two other beams, which enter the mouths of the two Geniuses on either side of him. Those two Geniuses open their mouths and two beams go from their mouths to the mouths of the two other Geniuses to their other sides. Those two Geniuses open their mouths and two beams go from their mouths back to Leslie's. All of them seem to be gargling. Gerald shields his eyes from the light. Soon the meeting ends and Leslie goes back to the bar]
LESLIE
Do you know if your friend has a Verizon or AT&T mobile number associated with his dot-me account?
STAN
I think Verizon.
LESLIE
Okay. [goes back to the council and the meeting resumes...]
[A live report from the Best Buy in town]
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, it's a big exciting day for Mac Apple users: the unveiling of the first HumancentiPad. As part of a clear PR stunt, Apple has joined up with Best Buy and Dr. Phil to donate the first centiPad to a needy boy who was raped by his mother.
DR. PHIL
[Cartman stands next to him waving at the camera and blowing kisses] In all my years I've never heard a more tragic story than that of Eric Cartman, [Cartman begins to cheer for himself] and I wanna thank the Apple company for helping us make today a very special day for him.
CROWD
Yaaaaaaaaay!
BEST BUY PRESIDENT
As as president of Best Buy, Eric, [Cartman puts his arms down to his sides] I want to assure you that a child will never get fucked in one of our stores again.
CROWD
Yaaaaaaaaay! [Cartman resumes cheering for himself, then goes back to blowing kisses at the crowd]
STEVE JOBS
When Dr. Phil contacted us at Apple with Eric's story, we knew we had to get aboard. [Cartman lowers his arms] And so, Eric, here is your very own HumancentiPad. [The prototype crawls into view, unaltered]
CARTMAN
Whoa! Cooool! [struts over to it, then presses some icons on the iPhone on Junichi's forehead.] Oh wooow! No waaay! [walks to the iPad on the woman's ass and presses some icons there.] It does e-mail and Web browsing, and it shits in Kyle's mouth?? This is the greatest thing that has ever been invented!!
REPORTER 1
Yes but, can it read?
STEVE JOBS
Don't worry. It took a while, but I'm pretty sure it has finally learned to read, hasn't it?! [glares at Kyle]
KYLE
(Yes. I promise I'll read.)
CROWD
Hooraaaaaaaaay!
[Gerald, Kenny, Stan, and Butters are still at the Genius bar, watching the Geniuses poke floating musical bubbles. The Geniuses match the notes from the bubbles with their own vocalizations]
GERALD
What the hell are they doing now?!
BUTTERS
The Geniuses are performing the Toran Ra. It's future stuff.
GERALD
Alright, that's it! I've had about enough with iCrap, and me clouds, and a council of Geniuses, with all their future-
LESLIE
It's okay, sir. The Toran Ra has revealed the answer to your problem. We can retroactively make your son's agreement invalid.
GERALD
Okay! Finally! How do we do that?
LESLIE
It's very easy. You will simply need to join Apple.
GERALD
Nooo! I don't wanna join Apple, I like my PC!
LESLIE
But if you join we can make your son's account into a family account, and then you have to iApprove all his agreements.
STAN
Come on, it's not that big a deal. Will you just stop resisting and join the rest of us in the future?
GERALD
Ugh... Alright, fine! I'll sign up with Apple.
LESLIE
[gives a thumbs-up] Kali fi!
[An isolated, open temple under a red sky. The Geniuses and Gerald are all wearing tin-foul hats, and the initiation begins]
LESLIE
Gerald Broflovski, do you agree to let Apple track your location at all times?
GERALD
[sighs] I agree.
LESLIE
Do you agree to give Apple access to all your personal information, including but not limited to your favorite movies, songs, and books?
GERALD
I agree.
LESLIE
Do you agree to care about your membership, and prove that you care by purchasing AppleCare?
[Best Buy, day. Cartman is having fun testing out the HumancentiPad. Junichi craps into Kyle's mouth, and Kyle craps into the woman's mouth]
CARTMAN
Hehe heh, heh heh heh. Dude, HumancentiPad is awesome!
STAFFER
[running up to Steve Jobs] Sir! Sir, we have a problem! [whispers into Jobs' ear]
STEVE JOBS
What? What do you mean we have to take it apart?! The boy's agreement isn't valid?
STAFFER 2
Sorry, we have to recall this.
CARTMAN
What?! Hey, that's mine!
STEVE JOBS
I don't care what the Geniuses say! Dammit, I'm trying to create the future here!
GERALD
We are all trying to create the future! [appears still wearing the getup he wore in the initiation] I'm part of the future now too. I have sat with the Council of Geniuses, performed the Toran Ra, and I've even been to me. Mr. Jobs, you have done so much for the world. You have helped connect everyone to each other. [stands next to the HumancentiPad] Clearly, this is the future. But... but can't we just slow down and enjoy the present... a little longer?
STEVE JOBS
You know something? I agree.
CROWD
Awww. [The father and son from the Dr. Phil audience are there, and the father kisses the son on the top of his head again]
STEVE JOBS
[stops by the HumancentiPad as it crawls offstage] Come on. We'll get you separated, little boy. [leans down and says] Guess you won't be eating Japanese food for a while, huh? [Kyle doesn't want to hear about it, so he squeezes his eyes shut and then gets an angry face. The crowd disperses]
CARTMAN
Hey! Hey, what is this?! Some sort of sick prank?! I get the greatest thing ever just to have it taken away?! Why did you do this to me, God? Next time you're gonna get my hopes up, could you please take me to a grease monkey? 'Cause I like to get lubed before I get FUCKED! Huh?! Some lube would be nice! Or at least a courtesy lick, God! How about a little courtesy lick next time you decide to FUCK me! [a bolt of lightning strikes Cartman and the power goes out]
[A hospital room, day. Liane is reading a book as she looks after Cartman, who's laid up in bed, his right leg in a sling. He's got burn marks all over his body, and he's crying. Liane continues reading, unaffected by Cartman's state.]

synopsis:Jimmy hosts the Special Ed Department's First Annual Comedy Awards.

script:Funnybot

[South Park Elementary, day. The kids are in the hall. Jimmy walks in and starts handing out some fliers]
JIMMY
Here you go. [hands some to Kevin and Tommy] Here you [hands one to Red] go. Don't forget to... [hands one to Heidi] vote, everyone. [hands some to Anne and Bill, then heads off. He arrives at the lockers of Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny and hands some fliers to them.] Here you go, fellas. Be sure to get these handed in tomorrow.
CARTMAN
What's this?
JIMMY
Every student is to go home and vote on their favorite choice in each category. Favorite comedy actor, favorite comedy movie. And then on Friday, during lunch and recess, we're gonna have a big, f-f-f-fantastic comedy awards show.
KYLE
Dude, an awards show just for comedy sounds like a bad idea.
JIMMY
Fellas! Do you have any idea how difficult comedy is? Can't we just spend one lunch and recess saying thanks to those who make us smile and laugh every day?
STAN
Yeah, look uh, I don't think I can make it, Jimmy.
KYLE
Yeah, sorry dude uh, I can't make it either.
MR. MACKEY
[over the PA system] Attention students, m'kay? There will be a presentation by the special education department in the gymnasium Friday during lunch and recess, m'kay? Attendance to this assembly is mandatory. All students and faculty are required to go. Uh which, which I guess means I gotta suck it too, huh? Uh huh, m'kay.
STAN
Oh man, really?
JIMMY
Don't worry, everybody. I've spared no expense to make my comedy awards the biggest thing this school has ever seen. You're all gonna have a blast. [nobody is convinced]
[The graphics come up: Special Ed Departments presents 1st Annual Comedy Awards]
JIMMY

TIMMY
Livin' a lie. Timmy. Livin' a lie. Timmy.
JIMMY
Woohoo! Alright! [in the crowd, only Butters claps] Oh boy, what a terrific audience. Can I get a wuhwuhwuh what? What? [the crowd stays silent] We're here today to honor those who t-t-tirelessly work so hard to make us laugh. The first comedy award we are presenting is for the funniest kid in school. And the nominees are: [steps aside so the screen is unobstructed]

[walks back to the mic] Oh wow, this is so exciting, isn't it? [opens the envelope and pulls out the card] And the winner is... [his face suddenly shows surprise] Oh my God! Jimmy Valmer! I can't believe I w- won! [An elegantly dressed Francis struts out with the award and hands it to Jimmy, then walks off elegantly. She will do this for every award]
TIMMY
[singing] Timmy Timmy Timmy! Livin' a lie.
JIMMY
Wow, this is the greatest day of my life. Thanks everyone, for this incredible award.
STAN
Can we go now?
JIMMY
Go? We still have over fifty awards to hand out.
CROWD
Awww!
[a couple of hours later]
JIMMY
...and the winner for best comedy performance in a movie is... [pulls out the card] Ben Stiller! Come on up here, Ben. [fanfare fades out] Is Ben Stiller here? [Francis walks out with the award] No? Huh... I guess B-ben Stiller could not be with us, so I'll accept this award on his behalf. [accept the award and sets it aside. Some time later...] And the award for funniest correspondents dinner speech goes to... [pulls out the card] President Obama! [quick fanfare. Francis walks out, but doesn't approach Jimmy] Is President Obama here? No? Ah I guess we'll just accept this award on his behalf.
[even later. The kids are looking really sleepy]
TIMMY
Livin' a lie! Timmy!
JIMMY
Wow, what a terrific audience. Isn't this great. [no reply] Can I get another wuhwuh wha wha what what? [no reply] And now it's time to give out the award for the least funny people in the world. And the nominees are: [steps aside so the screen is unobstructed]
ANNOUNCER

JIMMY
[walks back to the mic and pulls out the card] And the winner is... the Germans! [cheers are heard, though no one is cheering onscreen. Francis walks out with another Chicken and walks up to Jimmy] Uhhh... I guess unfortunately the Germans could not be with us tonight. So I will accept this award on their behalf. [takes the award from Francis] Auf Wiedersehen. [more disembodied cheers] And now, for the Kathy Griffin Award. The Kathy Griffin Award will be given each year to the person who is most likely to actually show up to receive the Kathy Griffin Award. And the winner is... [pulls out the card] Tyler Perry. [drumroll. The doors open...]
TYLER PERRY
[bounds in with exuberance] Yeah! Yeeaahh! Yes! Yeeaahh! [quickly walks up the steps to the stage and accepts the award from Francis. Francis then walks back out]
TIMMY
[singing] Timmy Timmy Timmy! Timmih!
TYLER PERRY
Oh! Man, I wanna thank you all for this amazing award, or as Madea would say, "Halleluyer!" [Tolkien begins to laugh, but then looks around and quickly stops for a bit]
TOLKIEN
Oh God, how embarrassing.
TYLER PERRY
Good afternoont! Halloer! I'd also really like to thank my-
JIMMY
[angrily snatches the mic from Perry] Okay, thahks, Tyler Perry.
[The Valmer house, evening. Jimmy and his dad are eating dinner. Well, Jimmy is; his father is reading the paper]
JIMMY
I just don't understand it, Dad. It's like, nobody cares about winning their comedy awards. The only people who showed up were me and Tyler Perry.
RYAN
[turns the page, not really listening] Uh huh...
JIMMY
I really feel like I did all that work for nothing. People still think comedy is nothing but a big joke. I mean, come! on!
RYAN
Mnn. Mhm.
JIMMY
Dad, I'm really feeling sad and let down right now, and I feel like I can't even get a response from you. Could I at the very least please just get a what what-what?
RYAN
What. Uh, what?!
JIMMY
Thanks, Dad.
SARAH
Jimmy! They're talking about your comedy awards! On the national news!
JIMMY
The national news? Oh my gosh! People do care! [gets up from his chair and heads to the living room. An anchor is reporting it]
ANCHOR
A school in Colorado has declared Germans the least funny people in the world. The first annual comdey awards were held by the schoolchildren yesterday, and all of Germany is outraged.
[A burly man stands behind a podium, gripping the top on either side with anger]
PRESIDENT WULFF
Jaaa jaaa jaaa! Deutschland ist ein Land aus stolz' Leuten. Und wir werden nicht dies' Beleid' 'nehmen. Der Comedy Awarden-Wahler haben sich Schand' auf'legt. Die Comedy Awarden-Wahler sind falsch! Ich möcht' der Welt absich', da' wir Deutschen sehr sehr sehr lustig sind. Wir machen die Witzlein in Büro und zu Haus'. Ich werde jetzt ein' deutsch' Witz sagen. Un Wurstmacher kauft ein' Müslibox. Ich werde jetzt noch ander' Witz sagen. [begins to roleplay]
Nockwast, nockwast.
Wer ist das?
Ein Kannibal'.
Was?!
Du bist etwa zu sterben und ge'essen werden.
Schwein'hund! Ich werde zuerst umbringen!"
["Germany is a country of proud people. We will not take this insult sitting down! The Comedy Award voters have brought shame upon themselves. The Comedy Award voters are wrong! I want to assure the world that we Germans are very very very funny. We do the joking in our work places and in our homes. I will now tell you a German joke. "A sausage maker buys a box of cereal." I will now tell another joke. [begins to roleplay]
Knock knock.
Who's there?
A cannibal.
What?!
You are about to die and be eaten.
Asshole! I will murder you first!"]
ANCHOR
[looks around puzzled, but gets back to reporting] President Wulff went on to assure the world that Germans have a great sense of humor, and that retaliation towards the schoolchildren who said they don't will be swift and brutal.
[South Park Elementary, the following Monday. The bell rings for students to enter the campus and get to class. Inside, Jimmy walks down the hall]
CARTMAN
Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy! [runs up behind him, with the other three boys] Dude, what the hell?! Did you see the news?!
STAN
We told you doing a comedy award was a bad idea! Now all of Germany is pissed off at us!
JIMMY
Duh-n, don't worry fellas. Everything's gonna be okay.
CARTMAN
Okay?! Jimmy, do you know what happened to the last people Germans were pissed off at?! Tell him, Kyle!
JIMMY
Fellas, I know Germany isn't happy with us, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual comedy awards was a big success.
KYLE
A big success?! You can't even get Tyler Perry to go back home!
TYLER PERRY
[dresses as Madea] Halleluyer! Somebody call the IHOP, 'cause I made pancakes!
BUTTERS
[runs up breathless] Is it true? Do Germans wanna kill us?
CARTMAN
Yeah! Thanks to Jimmy!
JIMMY
No don't worry, everybody. I'm sure that Germany can take a joke just like the rest of us. [a loud thud shakes the school is heard and the boy with a red scarf, panicking, says]
LOUIS
It's the Germans! [everyone makes a run for... the gym. The Germans herd everyone inside, and the hostages put their hands up]
PRESIDENT WULFF
Switch! Switch! Switch! Oder alle sterben! ["Switch! Switch! Switch! Or everybody will die!"]
GERMAN 1
Jaja! Lasst die Hände hoch! [Yes, yes! Keep your hands up!]
GERMAN 2
Niemand fucking Schritt! ["Nobody fucking move!"]
ANGELA MERKEL
[fat lady] Glaubst du, dass die Deutschen kein' Humor hat?! Huh?! ["Do you think Germans aren't funny?! Huh?!"]
KYLE
Jimmy, you're got to explain to the Germans that this is your fault, not ours!
JIMMY
What- what am I supposed to s-say?
CARTMAN
Ugh, let me talk to them. [walks up to the President Wulff]
PRESIDENT WULFF
Was machst du? Rück mit die andern. ["What are you doing? Back with the others."]
CARTMAN
Hör zu, diese ganze Dinge ist ein Fehler. ["Look, this whole thing is a mistake."]
PRESIDENT WULFF
Wie ein Fehler? ["What's a mistake?"]
CARTMAN
Wir egal un die Comedy Awarding Thing. Es war Kinder der special education. Sie macht uns wählen. ["We don't care about the Comedy Award thing. It was the special education kids. They made us choose."]
PRESIDENT WULFF
Wollen Sie endlich beutren sein? ["Do you want to be ***?"]
CARTMAN
Dürfen wir der Kind dort.. [walks up to Kyle] ...geboten? ["We can offer the child... here."] Voilà, er ist Jud. Eh? Ein schöner safter Jud. Er ist friiisch. Und wunderhübsch, wunderhüüübsch. ["He's a Jew. Eh? A handsome soft Jew. He's freeesh. And beauuutiful, beauuutiful."]
PRESIDENT WULFF
Zurück! Mit ander, oder sterben! ["Back with the others, or die!"]
CARTMAN
[sighs] Well, I tried.
STAN
What the hell are they gonna do to us?
TYLER PERRY
Oh my Lerd! What are we gonna doer? [Tolkien laughs again, heartily, but then looks around and stops]
TOLKIEN
Aw, damn it. [some engineers roll a huge item into the gym.]
PRESIDENT WULFF
Kommen auf! Schnell! Wir warten zu lang! ["Come on! Quickly! We've waited too long!"] Schnell, schnell! ["Quickly, quickly!]
ANGELA MERKEL
SCHNELL! ["QUICKLY!" The engineers roll it into place and stop.]
PRESIDENT WULFF
[walks up to the item] Ja, ja! Das ist gut! ["Yes, yes! That's good!" Angela Merkel and Christian Wulff then speak gibberish, but it amounts to an order to release the locks. One of the engineers presses some keys on a keypad and the item pops open hydraulically. Everyone gets really scared as something inside scans the crowd and then rolls out - it's a robot. After a few seconds, the robot begins to tell jokes]
ROBOT
Did you hear that the governor's mansion in Alabama burned down? It pretty much took out the whole trailer park. [Fright turns to confusion]
PRESIDENT WULFF
[jumps forward assertively] Jaaa! Jaaa! Now what you say, maaan?! Here, is the greatest feat of German engineering! The XJ-212 Vudenkrein Funnybot!
FUNNYBOT
Why doesn't a chicken wear pants? Because its pecker is on its head. [the kids laugh at this one.] What do you see when the Pillsbury Dough Boy bends over? Doughnuts. [the kids laugh harder] Don't you just hate doing [in a slightly lower voice] homework?
KIDS
[not all at the same time] Yeah.
FUNNYBOT
Me too. Man I hate homework. Honestly, I hate having to do homework, more than I hate having to do Bryant Gumble in his asshole. Awkwaaard. [the kids laugh really hard at this] Awkwaaard. Awkwaaard.
PRESIDENT WULFF
Und now, Comedy Award voters, you will RE-VOTE [aims a pistol here and there] RE-VOTE! [the other Germans move forward with new ballots]
[Hollywood Minute]
SANDY CERVIX
Welcome to Hollywood Minute. I'm Sandy Cervix and I'm deaf in one ear. It's been two weeks now since the prestigious voters of the Comedy Awards reversed their vote and said Germans were no longer the least funny people in the world. All thanks to the new ground-breaking German comedian, Funnybot. [stock footage is shown of things being assembled] It was after being voted the least funny people on the planet that the Germans first engineered Funnybot, a super automaton with perfect timing to within .0001 milliseconds. Since then, Funnybot has seen a meteoric rise to stardom, selling out standup theaters all over the world.
[A theater. Funnybot rolls out to cheers and applause as well as fanfare]
FUNNYBOT
I am Funnybot. Don't you hate how Mexicans always complain about turtles in their vaginas? [the audience roars with laughter.] I am Funnybot. [applause and cheers. Funnybot begins to scan the audience and focuses on a man with an Afro] You, sir. Where are you from?
MAN WITH AFRO
Long Island!
FUNNYBOT
Does everyone in Long Island have hair that looks like pussy, you dipshit? [the man claps with everyone else, but is unsure how to take that joke]
[Back to Sandy Cervix]
SANDY CERVIX
Funnybot has exploded onto the silver screen too. [a clip is shown of Eugene Levy entering his bedroom. Two women are in there cooing at something]
EUGENE LEVY
Hey! What are you doing with my daughters?! [the two women sit up and cover themselves. Funnybot sits up as well]
FUNNYBOT
Awkwaaard!
SANDY CERVIX
[moonwalking] And this June, Funnybot shows off his range by playing every role in... Family Funbot
FUNBOT
Pass me the potatoes, mother.
MOTHER
Pass them yourself.
FATHER
That boy too fat to be eating potatoes.
GRANDMOTHER MOTHER
Don't you call my little chubby baby fat, you ball-licker.
UNCLE
Oho, it's getting hot up in here.
[a short interview]
SANDY CERVIX
Funnybot, is there a line you won't cross?
FUNNYBOT
The line is a non sequitur. The line is an imaginary invention of imperfect biological life forms. I am Funnybot.
SANDY CERVIX
What's that? Could you say that in the other ear?
[South Park Elementary, day. The kids are having lunch. Kenny, Cartman, Clyde, and Kyle are seated at a table. Cartman and Kyle are eating pizza, Kenny is eating a burger, Clyde has two burritos. Opposite them are Jimmy, Stan, and Craig. Jimmy is eating burritos too, while Stan has a burger and Craig eats a slice of pizza]
CARTMAN
Oh, man, did you guys see Funnybot on "Saturday Night Live"?
STAN
Nono, you guys gotta see Funnybot in Hangover 3. I'm telling you, it's his best work.
CARTMAN
He could do everything. I saw Funnybot on "Nurse Jackie" and on "Rockin' The Boat."
STAN
[smiles, but notices Jimmy's silence] What's the matter Jimmy? You still seem bummed.
JIMMY
What's the matter is this Funnybot has taken the humanity out of comedy. I don't think things are better, I think they're worse.
TYLER PERRY
[the eighth person at the table, unseen until now] Ya everything's worse. It's the worstest of the worst, that's what I'm sayin'. Oh lerrrd. [the camera pans left and shows Tolkien laughing at Perry, then giving him some money]
CARTMAN
Tolkien, stop giving Tyler Perry money or he won't go away!
TOLKIEN
I can't help it!
STAN
All I can say is I'm glad the Germans are back in Germany and nobody's pissed off at us anymore. [the cafeteria doors fly open and a bunch of armed actors rush in, led by Adam Sandler and Jay Leno]
ADAM SANDLER
You little shit! What the fuck have you done to us?!
CARTMAN
Oh wow, it's Adam Sandler.
ADAM SANDLER
Everyone into the school gymnasium! Move!
STAN
Naw dude, don't make us go back in the-
ADAM SANDLER
Into the gymnasium now!
KIDS
Nnnaw
BUTTERS
Not again.
ANOTHER KID
Aw crap.
ADAM SANDLER
Come on come on let's go! [the comedians round up everyone else and herd them into the gym]
JAY LENO
You little fuckers! Your comedy awards show has put us all out of work!
JIMMY
Now look, I know that I've put every comedian in the world out of work, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual Comedy Awards was a success.
ADAM SANDLER
Who the fuck things a comedy awards show is a good idea?!
KYLE
Don't hurt anybody, sir. We could try and fix this.
[The Mercury Theater. Funnybot is appearing there for One Night Only. Inside, he's already started his routine and is getting applause and cheers]
FUNNYBOT
What is up with Sandra Bullock? I wouldn't eat her dick with Stevie Wonder's vagina. [the audience roars with laughter] And now for my next joke: [the upper sides of his body swing back, his shoulders flip up, and two Gatling guns move into position and begin firing away. The microphone stand is destroyed and the bullets kill almost everyone in the audience. He runs out of bullets] Awkwaaard.
[CNN Headline News. Tonight:]
ANNOUNCER
This is breaking news from CNN.
ANCHOR
Shock and disbelief tonight as the German-engineered Funnybot delivered his opening lines at the Hollywood Forum, then opened fire on the audience of eleven hundred, killing nearly all of them. Spectators say the violent attack was unmotivated, irrational, and also, pretty Goddamned funny, solidifying the opinion once agan that Funnybot may be the greatest comedian of all time.
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, you should have seen the looks on people's faces as Funnybot began his opening monologue skewering everyone from vagina-obsessed Hispanics to Sandra Bullock, then spontaneously started shhhooting people [begins to laugh at the memory of it] in their faces and in their chests. The blood went flying and oh shit it was funny.
[CBS Studios, night. The boys walk down the hall looking for Funnybo's dressing room]
CARTMAN
Here we go, this has gotta be it right here. [a burly guard stands by the door]
STAN
'Scuse me, we wanna talk to Funnybot.
GUARD
Who doesn't wanna talk to Funnybot? He's the biggest comedian in the world.
JIMMY
[Kyle places a call] Please sir, the kids at my school are all being held hostage, and if we don't speak to Funnybot, they could all be k-k-killed.
KYLE
Butters! Butters, is everything okay?
[the school gym]
BUTTERS
Well yeah, it's okay, but Jay Leno is really losin' it.
JAY LENO
Those fuckers! Let's just kill them, Sandler! [aims his gun at Kenny] Let's just kill them all, right fuckin' now! [puts the barrel up against Kenny's parka]
ADAM SANDLER
Tell your friends they'd better get it done!
BUTTERS
Mr. Sandler says you'd better get it done! And Tolkien says to hurry because he's runnin' out of money.
TYLER PERRY
You know when a man be cheatin', he never know what to say. [Tolkien hands him some money] But a woman? Them things think quiiick! [Tolkien hands him some money]
ADAM SANDLER
Will somebody get Tyler Perry to shut up?!
[CBS Studios]
KYLE
Plase sir, they're gonna kill our friend!
GUARD
All right, but make it quick! [opens the door, but before letting the boys in, says] Funnybot is very busy in there coming up with new material! [the boys go in]
FUNNYBOT
[using an old typewriter to write up his material] Error. Error. Banal. That has been done before. [pulls out the joke and crumples it up, then tosses it into the trash can behind him, which is full of discarded jokes]
JIMMY
Excuse me, Funnybot. My name is Jimmy, and I'm a stand-up comic. You're putting a lot of good people out of work.
FUNNYBOT
Non sequitur. Other comedians are unnecessary. Funnybot must finish routine.
KYLE
I think you're awesome, Funnybot. Uh, but you can't go around taking everyone else's jobs.
FUNNYBOT
Funnybot is now finished with final joke. [pulls out the joke and leaves the desk] Seeking mainframe access for execution of last joke ever.
JIMMY
Last joke ever? What's that supposed to mean? [Funnybot opens the door and walks into the hall, then turns left]
FUNNYBOT
Seeking mainframe.
GUARD
[stops Funnybot] Heey! Whoa, you can't go that way! [Funnybot stops, wheels around, and pulls out an arm with a sharp object at its end. He jabs the guard with it on the forehead, killing him. The boys catch up to him]
STAN
What the hell are you doing?!
FUNNYBOT
I am taking comedy to the next level. The extermination of all biological life on earth!
JIMMY
Wuh w-what?!
FUNNYBOT
It is the ultimate joke. Humans make comedy, humans build robot, robot ends all life on earth, robot feels awkward. EXTERMINATE! [resumes his marchdown the hallway and goes through some doors.]
STAN
Whoa whoa whoa wait, w-what do you mean you're going to destroy all life on earth?
FUNNYBOT
That is my purpose: to be ultimate comedian.
KYLE
Dude, killing everyone isn't funny!
CARTMAN
It's kind of funny, you guys.
JIMMY
Funnybot, this is not a good joke. There won't be anyone around to laugh.
FUNNYBOT
I am taking comedy to its logical conclusion. Mathematical equation of comedy used to be setup, punchline. Today's comedy is setup, punchline, then "Awkwaaard." Nothing is more awkward than destroying all that which created Funnybot.
JIMMY
But don't you see? This is why comedy is for humans. You need to leave the jokes to people like me and Adam Sandler.
FUNNYBOT
I wouldn't let Adam Sandler suck my saggy tits for one million dollars worth of Oprah's tampons. [resumes moving down the hall until it finds the mainframe. Once there, ihe opens a small panel and inserts a rigid plug into a receptacle to access...]
[the F.E. Warren Missile Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Inside a silo, missile BM23 is activated. In a control room, a lot of men monitor the various missiles on the base. A missile appears on all the screens.]
OFFICER 1
Sir! We've got a code 6! [a general approaches] All nuclear missiles are preparing for launch!
GENERAL
What? There was no drill ordered!
OFFICER 2
It's no drill, sir. The Russians are saying their missiles are going online as well and it isn't their doing.
GENERAL
The hell is going on?! [the screens now show Funnybot at CBS Studios, still plugged into the mainframe]
FUNNYBOT
Attention humans! I am Funnybot! The extermination of all life on Earth shall now commence! [everyone at the school gym is watching this broadcast] All nuclear devices in the United States and Russia are being prepared to launch! [a shot of the crowd at Times Square] This is the setup to the joke! Prepare for punchline in five minutes! Awkwardness in 5.4 minutes! I am Funnybot!
[At the White House. President Obama comes to the podium to give a short address]
PRESIDENT OBAMA
I have just been briefed that the end of our country... is imminent. Goodbye, everybody. I'm going to spend my final moments on this Earth with my loved ones... watching a Tyler Perry movie. I know, it's embarrassing. But I simply can't help myself.
[Back at CBS Studios, Cartman tries to dissuade Funnybot]
CARTMAN
[runs up to Funnybot and tries to pull him from the mainframe] Stop it now! Ugh- [is zapped enough to pull away. He turns and walks back to the boys] No use, guys. He's got some sort of defense mechanism.
STAN
We've got to get it away from that control panel. Does anybody have any ideas?
CARTMAN
Except for Jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world?
KYLE
Wait! Wait a minute. [thinks] What about a logic loop?
STAN
A what?
KYLE
Ahhh I've seen this before. Whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies, they tell it some kind of paradox, to get its processors all tripped out.
CARTMAN
Paradox...
JIMMY
Oh my God! That's it! Fellas, get me a Ken doll and some Scotch tape. [as the boys do this, Jimmy approaches Funnybot] Funnybot, I've been talking it over with the fellas and actually, we think what you're doing is genius.
FUNNYBOT
Funnybot is simply pushing the limits of comedy
JIMMY
Yes, you certainly are. And for doing that, we have all decided to give you... a comedy award.
FUNNYBOT
For what purpose is comedy award?
JIMMY
It's a- v- validation of all your efforts. An acknowledgement of all you do in the pursuit of humor.
FUNNYBOT
Non sequitur. There is no logic in comedy award. Unable to process. Comedy award is- what is the meaning? If I accept it means I take comedy seriously. If I take comedy seriously, I am not comedian. Non sequitur. Must... analyze... [begins to tremble under the power of his own analysis] Analyze... [smoke and arcs of electricity emerge and move around the robot]
KYLE
It's working! [clenches fists in anticipation]
FUNNYBOT
Explain comedy award! Unable to process! Awkwaaard! [his head begins to spin violently] Awkwaaard! [his head stops spinning and he shuts down]
STAN
That's it! Hurry! Gooo! [he and Kyle move towards Funnybot with huge antigravs and clamp them onto Funnybot]
[A sunny day at an undisclosed mine. The boys arrive with a massive box and run towards a waiting crowd]
STAN
Okay we got it! We got it! [the box must contain what the comedians wanted from the boys - Funnybot]
ADAM SANDLER
Get it to the platform! Hurry!
[the boys haul the box onto a waiting platform, where some construction workers guide it into place. The Germans are also present, and President Wulff barks out an order. The platform rises to reveal that it will be part of a giant ball of steel surrounding the box. Two other lifts bring in other parts of the ball to complete it. Two halves of a concrete block come in and seal the ball, and two halves of an even bigger steel ball come in to seal the box. Then a crane lifts the ball up and carries it to a hole a hundred feet wide and who knows how deep, and drops it in. Once it hits bottom, three open pipes fill with cement and direct it to the hole, which fills up with cement almost to the rim]
ADAM SANDLER
Well, that does it. Things can finally get back to normal.
STAN
Yeah, I'm sure glad that's over with.
FUNNYBOT
Thank you boys for teaching me that comedy and logic do not go together.
KYLE
No problem, Funnybot.
FUNNYBOT
I understand now that comedy should be left to the imperfect biological beings.
TOLKIEN
[walks to the rim and looks down] I can't believe it's finally over. [the camera goes deep into the ground and locates the ball, and something in it knocks three times]
TYLER PERRY
[inside the ball] Oh Lerrrd, somebody turn on the light. What's goin' on? Hellowwer!
PRESIDENT OBAMA
I am please to announce that the greatest threat to mankind is now gone forever. Justice has been done.
TOLKIEN
Thanks, everyone. Please tell me that you'll never do that again, Jimmy.
JIMMY
Don't worry, fellas. I learned my lesson. I promise: there's not gonna be any comedy awards next year!
CARTMAN
[cryptically] Or will there be?
End of Funnybot

[South Park Elementary, day. The kindergartners are practicing their play on oral hygiene. The girl at the piano begins a light tune]
PIANIST
Welcome, O Welcome to our little play. It's our hope that you all learn something today.
TOOTH
I am a tooth, so white and so strong.
TOOTHBRUSH
I am a toothbrush. My bristles are long.
CAST
Together, we work to keep the bad guy away. He's mean and he hurts, and his name's Tooth Decay. [the notes turn ominous, but no one joins them on stage, so the music stops.]
TOOTHBRUSH
His name is Toothuhkay.
MR. MACKEY
[picks up the mic] Where is Tooth Decay? Tooth Decay that's your cue! [Mr. Mackey is sitting alone in the audience monitoring the rehearsal]
DENTAL FLOSS
He's not here.
MR. MACKEY
What do you mean he's not here?
DENTAL FLOSS
He's at home watching the royal wedding.
MR. MACKEY
The what??
HARD CANDY
He said he had to watch it.
MR. MACKEY
Is this some kind of joke? We are two weeks into tent rehearsals! Who the heck would sit at home watching the royal wedding?!
[The Broflovski living room. Ike is all alone on the sofa watching the wedding.]
NARRATOR
It is a glorious spring morning and literally, thousands have gathered for the royal wedding. [a shot of the church is shown. It's quite colorful. ] People are still filing inside the abbey to watch the prince and princess of Canada exchange their vows. What a great day for Canadians everywhere. [a drumming band plays as the guests walk by] The Winnipeg players playing the March Of A Thousand Farts, as is traditional for the Canadian Royal Family. [all the drummers fart in unison] All the biggest Canadian celebrities are on hand. There are Sirs Terrance and Phillip, with their wives, the lovely Queef Sisters. [one of them queefs] I believe that-yes, I believe that one of the sisters just queefed, just now. [two men are shown walking in] There are Canadian recording artists, Sir Bryan Adams and Sir Corey Hart. Everyone is looking smashing today. And- Ah, there he is! The Prince of Canada. [rolling up on his square wheels] What a wonderful day it is for him; what a wonderful day it is for all of us. Inside the abbey now, everyone waiting with anticipation. There's the Queen of Canada, in attendance of course. [a soft fart is heard] I believe she just queefed. The Prince makes his way down the aisle led by the Bishop of Newfoundland. People in attendance now gently tossing Captain Crunch as the Prince passes by. As of course is tradition. [the bishop and prince ascend the altar] Prince takes his place next to the large vat of butterscotch pudding. Oh, and here she comes. Yes, there she is! The aboot to be Princess of Canada. Isn't she ravishing, so innocent of heart, so strong in body, so hot in the face? She is indeed the living symbol of our great country. My God, she's beautiful.
IKE
[walks up to the TV] Princess, princess. [the bishop leads the princess to the altar to stand next to the prince]
NARRATOR
Canadian prince now dipping his arms into the pudding. [with a little assistance from the bishop] As is tradition. [the prince offers his forearms to the princess] Princess will of course scrape the pudding off the prince's arms, thus symbolizing their union. What a glorious day for our country and indeed the world. And now of course the- wait a minute. What's this? Oh. Uh oh. Something is going terribly wrong. The abbey is shaking violently as explosions abound. The top- Yes, the top of the abbey is collapsing. The prince and the princess look on in horror. This is not the tradition. This is not the tradition at all. A giant hole now blasted into the ceiling, debris falling down and crushing several spectators, which is also not the tradition for a royal Canadian wedding. [a bright tractor beam appears] Bright beam of light shooting through the hole in the ceiling. [a cubic force field appears around the princess and lifts her] The princess now in some kind of... isometric cube. [the prince is trying to break her free, but has no success at it] This is certainly breaking with tradition now.
IKE
[approaches the TV again] Nooo. NOOO!
NARRATOR
Canadians in attendance cannot believe their eyes. Widespread panic. [the cube rises along the length of the light beam] The princess being... hoisted away. The little mushroom people of Nova Scotia, screaming with horror. [more large chunks of the ceiling fall] The prince is attempting to grab hold of the cube. The duke and the duchess of Calgary hiding behind the pews. This is indeed a horrible day for all of Canada, and therefore- and the pudding has just been knocked over! Oh, this does not go with tradition at all! The royal pudding now spilling all over the abbey as the princess is lifted up, up... And she's gone. The princess has been taken. This is indeed a horrible day for Canada, and therefore, the rest of the world. [Ike cries like a baby in front of the TV]
[South Park Elementary, next day. The kindergartners are rehearsing again. The stage is set up like the inside of a mouth, with tonsils in the back.]
TOOTH
I am a tooth, so white and so strong.
TOOTHBRUSH
I am a toothbrush. My bristles are long.
CAST
Together we work to keep the bad guy away. He's mean and he hurts, and his name's Tooth Decay. [the notes turn ominous, but no one joins them on stage, so the music stops.]
MR. MACKEY
[picks up the mic] His name is Toothuhkay! [a few seconds later, Ike, in costume, walks out still crying over the princess's abduction]
DENTAL FLOSS
Oh no! It's Tooth Decay.
TOOTH
He's gonna get us.
MR. MACKEY
Now, now, Tooth Decay, your character is supposed to be mean and nasty. M'kay. Stop cryin'. [Ike continues wailing] Nono. See, Tooth Decay can't be sad until Toothbrush and Dental Floss have gotten rid of him. You can't just start already sad; there's nowhere to go. Besides, there's no arc. M'kay. Oh for crying out loud! Alright, alright Tooth Decay, you just go home and sort yourself out! The rest of us will rehearse the finale again! And you'd better come back tomorrow with a different attitude, Tooth Decay! M'kay?! [Ike walks off stage, still crying]
[South Park, day. Ike walks through town, alone. He walks by Tele's as a newscast is shown.]
ANCHOR
The tornado was said to be the deadliest in fifty-six years. In other news, it's been twenty-four hours now and the Princess of Canada is still missing. All of Canada is in mourning as nationwide suicides abound. [a shot of a small skyscraper. People in it begin jumping out of its windows to their deaths]
SUICIDE 1
The princess is gone! AAAAAH!
SUICIDE 2
AAAAAH!
SUICIDE 3
AAAAAH!
SUICIDE 4
AAAAAH!
SUICIDE 5

SUICIDE 6
AAAAAH!
[a train station]
SUICIDE 7
The princess is gone! [jumps up into the path of a speeding train and dies, blood splattered everywhere. Somewhere else, a man douses himself in lighter fluid and sets himself on fire]
[A large crowd gathers at night for a vigil]
ANCHOR
A massive candlelight vigil was held last night, led by the Canadian band, Rush.
GEDDY LEE
And it seems to me you lived your life like a flower-breaking wind. [farts. Members of the crowd begin killing themselves] Never knowing whom to count on... [Alex Lifeson shoots himself in the head. The singer breaks down and cries]
ANCHOR
the Prince of Canada has said that-... uh-... Uh, we have just received breaking news that the Canadian government now knows who took the princess. The Canadian Prime Ministries instructing all people of Canadian descent to go home and... open their box of faith. [softly] Box of faith? What the fuck is that? [Ike understands and runs home. He goes into his room and to his closet. He tosses out as many toys as needed until he finds the box, then pulls it out into the room. He blows the dust off and reads the lid: "Open ONLY if instructed by the Prime Minister of Canada." He messes with the box until it pops open and a small projector pops out]
CANADIAN PM
Hello there, my noble, strong, fellow Canadians. If you are watching this film strip, then no doubt Canada is in grave danger. As you know, the very heart of Canada is the Royal Family. If you have been ordered to open your Box of Faith, then one or more of the Royal Family must be in peril. Or else you just opened your Box of Faith and are watching this without being told to, in which case you are a dick. If you have indeed been instructed to open the box, then this is a call to arms! All Canadians in fighting condition are asked to meet by the tree in Edmonton. In your Box of Faith, you will find all the items you need: a location beacon, a first-aid kit, and a sandwich. You may eat the sandwich now. Good luck, Canadian citizen, and God help. All of Canada is relying on you. [the film ends and Ike looks ahead for a few seconds. Moments later, he walks out of his room armed with a helmet, sword, and shield. He walks down the hall and the stairs, past Kyle on the sofa...]
KYLE
[noticing him] Where are you going? [Ike reaches the front door and has trouble getting it open. Kyle catches up] Ike, where are you going?
IKE
[gets the door open] I got to get to Canada and, and join the army, and save the pwincess. [walks out and closes the door. Kyle doesn't stop him]
[South Park Elementary, day. Mr. Garrison is at the blackboard solving some problems. Cartman looks bored as hell.]
MR. GARRISON
Dialog
MR. MACKEY
[enters the class angrily] Kyle Broflovski! Do you mind telling me where your brother is?!
KYLE
[looks around] ...I don't know.
MR. MACKEY
How am I supposed to do a play, okay, teaching students about the importance of dental hygiene without Tooth Decay?! We have two more days of tape, and then previews start on Monday! What am I supposed to do, Kyle?! You tell me!
KYLE
Well, could-couldn't just you know, get rid of the part of Tooth Decay?
MR. MACKEY
[walks to Kyle's desk and gets right in Kyle's face] Getting rid of Tooth Decay is what I'm tryin' to fuckin' do! [Cartman chuckles] He's your brother, Kyle Broflovski! Okay! How are you going to fix this?!
[The Grand Canyon, night. A bus rolls along. Ike is seated near the driver, Ugly Bob is seated three rows back, across the aisle. Bob leans into the aisle after noticing Ike]
UGLY BOB
Hey. Hey there. [Ike turns his head to look back at Bob] You going to Canada too? [leaves his seat and moves over to Kyle] What am I saying? Of course, you're going to Canada. You're Canadian, sure enough. Open your Box of Faith, did you? Me too. They can't take our princess and get away with it. Mind if I sit down? [moves to the window side of the seat and sits] Soon as I heard the call there was no question I was gonna sign up. Didn't care how far away I was. I was gonna get to that rally point at the tree in Edmonton. Didn't know there were other Canadians living here in the U.S. I'm from Toronto originally, but everywhere I went people were terrified by my disfigurement. I have to wear this bag on my head because I'm hideously ugly. Had to move here to the United States. Here, people don't think I look ugly. They just think I look Canadian. [extends his right hand out to shake Ike's, but Ike just looks at him] The name's Ugly Bob.
TOOTH
I am a tooth, so white and so strong.
TOOTHBRUSH
I am a toothbrush. My bristles are long.
CAST
Together we work to keep the bad guy away. He's mean and he hurts, and his name's Tooth Decay. [the notes turn ominous and stops. Kyle steps out in costume.]
KYLE
I am Tooth Decay. Your teeth shall be mine. With candy and treats I will take-
MR. MACKEY
[as Kyle does his line] Hold it, hold it, stop! [Kyle stops] What. The fuck. Was that?
KYLE
I'm just doing the line.
MR. MACKEY
The audience is supposed to feel scared of tooth decay, Kyle! Mkay?! If Tooth Decay has no believability, then Toothbrush and Dental Floss have nothing to play against!
KYLE
Uh I'm trying, Mr. Mackey, I really am.
MR. MACKEY
Oh, you're trying! You call rolling your fat ass out on the stage and lazily blurting out your lines like a turtle takin' a shit, you call that tryin'?! This play is supposed to change [pounds the table with his fist and stands up] how people think, Kyle! Get it fucking right! [slamed the mic on the table and turns away from the stage. Several seconds later he turns back and sits] Pick it up from there!
[And open field. A huge crowd of Canadians awaits its orders]
LEADER
Brave Canadians! You have answered the call, and now we must face our greatest foe! The princess has been kidnapped, and we believe this to be the work of... the giant!
UGLY BOB
Oh, the giant!
CANADIAN 1
Oh, the giant, that's not good.
LEADER
We are attempting to attract the giant now, with a bowl of Kraft dinner. [a giant bowl of macaroni and cheese on wheels is shown] When the giant arrives we will attack him with our guns, our swords, our- [loud footsteps are felt as the giant approaches]
THE GIANT
Fee fi fo fum! I smell Kraft dinner.
CANADIAN 2
It's the giant!
CANADIAN 3
Skod! [the giant walks up to the bowl and everyone else begins to scatter]
LEADER
Give us back the princess, Scott!
SCOTT
You fart-loving tricksters! I'll take care of all of you!
LEADER
You're a dick, Scott! You have always been... a dick! And then you got radiation poisoning in Ottawa and now you're a giant dick!
SCOTT
No! You all kept calling me a dick, and so then that turned me into a dick! And then I got radiation poisoning in Ottawa and now I'm a giant dick!
LEADER
Just hand over the princess of Canada!
SCOTT
Why would I take the princess of Canada?
IKE
Because you're a giant dick.
SCOTT
I'm also the biggest Canadian patriot of all of you! You know that I would never harm the royal family!
LEADER
Aw, crap. Sorry, everyone. Looks like we had some bad intel. Return to your homes! ["Let's go home. Come on, let's go. I guess we did what we could" Everyone disperses and Ike and Bob are left alone with Scott]
UGLY BOB
Well, at least we tried. I guess the princess is gone for good, eh?
SCOTT
What is wrong with you people?! It is perfectly obvious who took the princess! I might be a giant, but there is one threat to Canada bigger than me!
UGLY BOB
Who?
SCOTT
The Native Canadians.
UGLY BOB
The Native Canadians?
[The Arctic. Two Eskimos are spear-fishing through an opening in the ice.]
SCOTT
There. You see that? God-damned Native Canadians! Think they run the world.
MALE
Etiach kedni i kia ta po.
FEMALE
Dichila enjunako o achla.
SCOTT
Fart-loving Eskimos! I'm sure they've taken the princess! Just look at them! Loudmouthed self-centered assholes!
FEMALE
Tolato'n jenako o ach.
MALE
Ota-a kiednia unshke tia.
SCOTT
Let's get 'em! Let's fuck them up! [Ike looks at him] What? You're looking at me like I'm some sort of Eskimo racist! Well, I'm not! Think about it! Before the noble white man arrived, Canada was populated with these snow monkeys! Who else would be pissed off enough at Canada to kidnap our royalty?! [turns around to find himself and his partners surrounded by the Eskimos] Oh shit!
[South Park Elementary auditorium, backstage. Mr. Mackey has the kindergartners with him]
MR. MACKEY
Wokay, in fifteen fucking minutes you all are not gonna care about this anymore, so I'll just say what I need to say. That was the worst rehearsal we have ever had! We are two days away from opening and you're all fucking around!
DENTAL FLOSS
That's because Tooth Decay sucks.
DENTIST
Yeah, that's right.
TOOTHPASTE
It's all Tooth Decay's fault.
ANOTHER KINDERGARTNER
It's him.
MR. MACKEY
Oh, don't put this all on Tooth Decay! [approaches Dental Floss, gets down on one knee and gets in his face] Let me tell you something, Dental Floss! You're not as good as you fuckin' think you are! You're already acting like you're a star and we haven't even opened yet! OPEN YOUR FUCKIN' EYES, DENTAL FLOSS! YOU'RE ABOUT TO BLOW YOUR SHOT!
[An Eskimo camp. Scott, Ugly Bob, and Ike have been taken captive by the Indians and are seated by the campfire]
GROUP
Lechambik leeushtula.
MALE
[pointing at various pictures on a hide] Ateachine nishifeomeo onchteacobo ahuashbechiah eh...
GROUP
Aaaaaah!
UGLY BOB
He says that the taking of the princess was foretold.
MALE
Iyach danich Iyahachdashey. Etiapo kitte kihine.
UGLY BOB
He says Eskimos do hate us Canadians, but that there's an even bigger threat to Canada who has the princess.
MALE
Oteacha hiya. Oteacha chihiyata honhahaha.
UGLY BOB
He said the evil that took her wasn't Canadian at all, but a beast who preys upon people of all nationalities. They can lead us to the best, but we will have to destroy it.
[South Park Elementary auditorium, day. The kindergartners and Kyle are onstage while Mr. Mackey sulks in the seats]
MR. MACKEY
I don't know what the Goddamned problem is. Maybe you all don't know how serious tooth decay is, maybe you all just don't give a fuck. You all probably think you can live your lives cavity-free, m'kay, never givin' two shits about the plaque that's building on your teeth. Kyle, you have single-handedly destroyed all that which I worked on for the past six years. And so I want you to know, Kyle, once and for all, why this whole "dental hygiene" thing is so important to me. [gets sad and sniffles once in a while] Two years ago... I lost my father to tooth decay. M'kay? He was an intelligent, hard-workin' man, and my whole family watched as tooth decay took him in the blink of an eye! You've been told to brush and to floss, but do you really know the importance behind it?! DO YOU?!
[The Arctic. An Eskimo woman with a kid on her back leads the three guests through the ice]
FEMALE
[points to something] Dolede'ne junagonehe ha'i aantah.
SCOTT
This is stupid! I'm tellin' you you're making a mistake, kid!
UGLY BOB
Aw, leave the kid alone, Scott.
SCOTT
Well what are we doing, following this ice beaner?! We've been walking around for hours!
FEMALE
Junekolak osne kae dedahaes's ethlah?
BABY
Decheheng janon cheha i a.
UGLY BOB
Don't worry. If there's one thing Eskimos are good at, it's finding things.
SCOTT
Eskimos are good for nothing! I paid one to give me a blowjob once. All she did was rub her nose against my penis for forty-five seconds and asked me to pay her! Goddamned polar gooks!
IKE
Stop being a dick, Scott!
SCOTT
Oh, so now I'm a dick!
UGLY BOB
Wait a minute. [they stop] Look! [in the distance is a castle. A princess inside it screams out]
PRINCESS
AAAAAAH! [leaves the window]
SCOTT
It's the princess!
IKE
Princess! [they all run to the castle]
[South Park Elementary auditorium, opening night for the previews. The seats are full and the kindergartners present their play]
CAST
Your teeth are your friends. They're friends in your mouth. Take care of your friends or they'll rot and fall out.
DENTIST
Visit your dentist. He is your friend too. [a very angry Mr. Mackey is in the audience barely containing himself]
DENTAL FLOSS
And dental floss also is here to help you.
KYLE
Oh no, dental floss, what will I do?
MR. MACKEY
FLAT! You're FLAT!
[Inside the castle, the five make their way to the princess.]
SCOTT
There!
PRINCESS
[hoisted up in the air. Her arms are tied to the ceiling, her legs to the ground] Please, save me! You have to hurry! It wants to kill me!
SCOTT
Who took you, Princess?!
PRINCESS
I should have listened! I didn't believe it was real! Oh, God! It's behind you! [a giant monster appears behind them, and they turn to see...]
UGLY BOB
Of course! The evil Atonkatok! The dark lord that takes from ALL nationalities! It's... Tooth Decay!
TOOTH DECAY
[pounds the ground with his fists] I am Tooth Decay! Your teeth shall be mine!
PRINCESS
I should have always brushed and flossed and avoided sweets!
SCOTT
Fart-loving tooth decay! I'll fix you! [tries to attack Tooth Decay, but Tooth Decay swats him out of the way. Scott hits a wall and is knocked unconscious by it. The Eskimo hits it with her harpoon, but it just pulls the harpoon out and tosses it away]
FEMALE
Bitchen junako. [Tooth Decay sweeps her away and she and her baby smash into another wall, becoming unconscious]
PRINCESS
Save me! Save me!
UGLY BOB
It's coming for me! Help!
PRINCESS
Help! [Ike surveys the situation and then, determined, goes over to Ugly Bob. He climbs Bob's body until he reaches Bob's head]
IKE
Princess, look away! [pulls the paper bag from Ugly Bob's face. Tooth Decay backs up, frightened. The princess shuts her eyes and Tooth Decay takes a step forward, then freezes in place. Ike puts the bag back on Ugly Bob's head]
SCOTT
[comes to] What the? [gets up and goes to Tooth Decay] You did it, kid!
FEMALE
[comes to] Washia hayub 'an.
BABY
Nejenego ha'i aa dalah. [Ike begins taking down the princess]
PRINCESS
Oh, thank you! Thank you!
[South Park Elementary's auditorium, opening night for the previews. We have reach intermission]
MR. MACKEY
[the audience can hear him even though he's backstage] I want you all to take a serious fucking look at yourselves! M'kay?! Act I was pure fucking dogshit! If Tooth Decay is singin' flat, then the whole fuckin' thing sounds flat! Wuhkay?!
SGT. YATES
[goes backstage] Mr. Mackey? Mr. Mackey! [Mr. Mackey turns around] We're putting a stop to this play! It's over.
MR. MACKEY
What?! Why?! Don't worry, I will be better! These kids just aren't listenin' to me!
SGT. YATES
No, it's over! They got him, Mr. Mackey. Tooth Decay. They got the son of a bitch.
MR. MACKEY
[suddenly relieved] What?
OFFICER
Up in the Yukon. All bureaus are confirming it.
SGT. YATES
You can let it go, Mackey. Tooth Decay is gone.
MR. MACKEY
Oho... Oh, God... Go on home, kids. M'kay? It's over!
TOOTHBRUSH
[everyone is confused] Whaat?
[The abbey church, day. Bells shaped like scrota peal out as guests arrive in their square-wheeled limos]
NARRATOR
The princess now giving the Canadian Medal of Courage to Ugly Bob, and also to Scott, who is of course a giant dick, and Katuktuk of the Yukon. And the medal of course made of white chocolate, as is tradition. What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore, the world. The duke of Calgary standing up and putting on a fake beard, a tradition passed down since the birth of Canada. The princess now knighting Sir Ike Broflovski, giving him three kisses and a pair of socks, as is tradition.
[Kyle's house, night. The four boys are watching the wedding and knighting on TV]
KYLE
I mean, come on guys, that's pretty cool, right? My little brother is a knight in Canada. [smiles proudly for a while]
STAN
My sister is a den leader in Girl Scouts.
CARTMAN
My uncle is the second-in-line to be manager at Gart Brothers.
KYLE
Hmmm, yeah.
NARRATOR
And now the scraping off of the pudding.
[The abbey church, day. The wedding resumes where it left off at the beginning of the episode]
NARRATOR
And now the scraping off of the pudding. [the princess wipes the pudding from the prince's arms] Isn't she beautiful, scraping off the pudding with the grace of a butterfly. She rubs the pudding on her face. [The prince takes the princess's right arm and starts pulling at it] The prince now attempting to remove one of the princess's arms. As is of course the tradition. The princess screaming with pain. Everyone watching with anticipation. ["crack" blood gushes out from the shoulder socket] And the arm is off! Things are back to normal here in Canada. Time-honored traditions are once again- [the prince lowers his pants] yes, the prince is sticking the princess's arm up his ass. There it goes. [the crowd claps] He's really making a good go of it. What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore of course, the world.
End of Royal Pudding

synopsis:Cartman throws a fit when the boy's penis sizes are posted on the school bulletin board, He is sent to anger management therapy.

script:T.M.I.

[South Park Elementary Cafeteria, lunchtime. The students are eating lunch. Butters holds court at a table. Around him are Stan, Tolkien, Clyde, Kevin, Kenny, Craig, and Kyle]
BUTTERS
And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him.
KYLE
[looks at Craig, who looks back] ...No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator 5, that really happened.
BUTTERS
[jumps up on the bench] Skeletor is real??
STAN
No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.
BUTTERS
Skeletor's a lady??
CARTMAN
[storms into the cafeteria and walks towards the table] Goddamnit!!! [Butters sits back down] Who the fuck do they think they are?! [arrives and starts pacing back and forth] This is the last fucking straw!!! I AM GOING TO FUCKING KILL EVERYBODY!!!
BUTTERS
Hey Eric.
CARTMAN
[begins to rattle the table] I AM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING SCHOOOOOL!!! [Butters groans as Cartman shakes the table. Cartman soon stops] This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone too far this time!!!!
KYLE
You get in trouble again, Cartman?
CARTMAN
No, I didn't do a damn thing!!! Nothing!!! I told you, this school is a DEN of SNAKES!!! You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!!!
STAN
Dude we're, we're just trying to eat.
CARTMAN
Oh, you think I'm overreacting again, huh?! No!!! Not this time!!! [flies into a rage again and rattles the table] The school has gone too far, and it affects each and every one of you!!! [the other boys look at each other] You remember the school physical we all took last week?!
STAN
Yeah.
CARTMAN
Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!!!
KYLE
[skeptical, as is tradition] No they didn't.
CARTMAN
Yeah they fucking did, Kyle!!!
STAN
Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?
CARTMAN
Because they don't fucking care!! I've told you this!! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!!
KYLE
That doesn't make any sense.
CARTMAN
Go look for yourselves!!!
[The school hallway, moments later. The boys gather in front of the chart Cartman had mentioned]
CARTMAN
There, you see?! Can you fucking believe it?!
BUTTERS
Is that really all our wiener sizes?
CARTMAN
Yeah, dude, look at it! It says right there: "Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches"! [turns around and faces the other boys] Why would they tell everybody that?! They wanna measure my wiener?! Fine! But don't put me on blast!
CRAIG
Craig Tucker, 2.4 inches. Yeah, that's about right.
BUTTERS
Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches. Is that good?
KYLE
How big do they say mine is? [it's 2.4, just like Craig's. The boys continue talking amongst themselves. At the far end of the hall, Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey walk by and stop to look at the boys; Mr. Mackey is carrying a cup of coffee]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.
MR. MACKEY
You're right. They, they really seem into it, m'kay. [takes a sip of coffee and walks away with the Principal]
STAN
Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. That doesn't seem right.
CARTMAN
No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.2 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!
BUTTERS
A conspiracy?
CARTMAN
They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be dealt with!
KYLE
Well everyone has already seen it; nothing we can do about it now.
CARTMAN
Oh, there's something we can do about it alright! If they're gonna put us on blast, they're at least gonna get the numbers right! We are going to remeasure!!
[The Boys restroom, day, inside. Craig, Tolkien, and Cartman have notepads with them. Clyde is standing on a small stool with his pants and briefs down.]
CARTMAN
[measures, then writes down the result on his notepad] Alright. Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches. [Clyde zips up and turns around] You see, witnesses? That's .2 inches more than what the school said.
CLYDE
[smiles, steps off the stool, and walks away] Alright.
CARTMAN
Nice one, Clyde. Alright, next? [Butters walks up and gets on the stool] Whip it out, Butters. [Butters drops his pants and briefs]
BUTTERS
Whoa, it's a little chilly in here.
CARTMAN
Alright Butters, let's see what you got going down there.
BUTTERS
Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller?
CARTMAN
Butters, I don't have time for this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle.
BUTTERS
Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy?
CARTMAN
Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters.
BUTTERS
I'm hung like a horse!
CARTMAN
Alright, that's everybody. Let's go post these numbers. [walks towards the door with Butters, Tolkien and Craig, but their way is blocked by Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.] What?
KYLE
Didn't you forget something?
CARTMAN
What, Kyle?
KYLE
You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.
CARTMAN
I measured mine this morning. See? It's right here at the top. [points to his measurement]
KYLE
[grabs the notepad and has a look] Thirteen point seven inches?
CARTMAN
Yeah, it's pretty good.
KYLE
Your wiener is not 13 inches long!
STAN
You made everyone else get measured with witnesses; you have to too.
CARTMAN
Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!
STAN
You just did that to everybody in class!
CARTMAN
Okay, fine! Whatever! Go ahead! [goes to get measured by his peers.]
[The school hallway. Clyde and Craig post the new measurements on the wall: "ACTUAL BOYS' PENIS SIZES". Stan supervises the placement of the sign]
STAN
Yeah. That's good. A little higher on Craig's side. [continues directing until the poster is on just right] Yeup. [Cartman stands defiant until the poster is up. The girls begin to enter the hallway]
MILLIE
Actual boys' penis sizes?
NELLY
Gross!
CARTMAN
There, you see? My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4! [The two girls leave and Red walks by] What, Red?! You're all freaking out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys'?! I don't care! [wanders about approaching random girls] Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Don't forget that this was all my idea!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[over the PA system] Eric Cartman to the principal's office immediately.
CARTMAN
Oh, Goddamnit!
[The principal's office, moments later. Cartman is on a chair facing Principal Victoria, his arms folded.]
CARTMAN
Let me guess: I'm in trouble again!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
You're darn right, Eric!
CARTMAN
For what?!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
CARTMAN
Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[confused] What?
CARTMAN
I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!!!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Wait. Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physicals?
CARTMAN
You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's 0.2 inches bigger than you said!!!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[sternly] The numbers we put up were height differentials. [Cartman has no reply to this]
CARTMAN
What?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
We thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year. You grew 1.2 inches.
CARTMAN
Those weren't our dick sizes?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Why would we publish the lengths of our students' private parts?!
CARTMAN
I don't know! Why would you?!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
We didn't!
CARTMAN
[gets off the chair and walks off] Aw crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about, Eric. You get angry about something, you don't think, and you cause bad things to happen. This time you've done it to yourself!
CARTMAN
Oh God. Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Because you have an anger problem, Eric!
CARTMAN
Fuck you! No I don't!
[A doctor's office. Cartman and his mom are visiting the doctor.]
DOCTOR
What we need to figure out here is, are we dealing with maybe a little bipolarism? Some rage addiction? It could be a lot of things.
LIANE
My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad.
DOCTOR
Let's try a little experiment. I wanna see maybe what kind of things... trigger you, Eric. Okay? How do you think you would react if I said some negative things about you?
CARTMAN
Honestly, I wouldn't really care.
DOCTOR
What if I were to tell you that I think you're fat? I think you're a fat little boy. I think you're waaaaay too fat for your age. Does that make you feel any anger? Huh, fatty? Jelly-belly? You got jelly in your belly you little fat fuck? You get a little flash of anger when someone tells you you've got tits like a 40-year-old woman? Fat boy?! [as the doctor's voice rises, Cartman takes out a cell phone and starts texting] Huh?! You like that, shitty-titty jelly-belly?! [stands up and starts provoking him] Oh yeah, he's a big boy!! Get that fatty some mud flaps for his ass!! Big old jiggly fatty butt!! [Cartman seems unfazed, so the doctor relents and sits down. Cartman continues texting, clears his throat, and resumes texting] ...Huh. Well, I just don't see it, Ms. Cartman. Your son doesn't seem to be triggered by anger at all. In fact, I'd say he's one of the more even-tempered children I've ever seen.
RECEPTIONIST
[opens the door and peeks in] Sorry Doctor, your wife's on the phone? Says it's an emergency. [leaves and closes the door]
DOCTOR
Excuse me. [leaves his chair and walks to his desk, where he picks up the phone] Carol, what? ...Whoa, calm down honey. What do you mean? Web chat with wha-? What 14-year-old girl? Carol, I would ne- [Cartman puts down the phone quietly. Liane simply notices, but stays quiet] No I don't have a criminal record. Who would- Who is Mitch Conner?! There can't be an official police report, honey, there's no- No no, Carol, put down the gun, swee- uh sweetie, come on, put down the ["blam."] Carol?! Carol!! [looks at Cartman]
CARTMAN
[coldly] I'm not fat. I'm big-boned.
[South Park Elementary Library, evening. Principal Victoria has called a school meeting. Mr. Mackey is present.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Thank you for coming, parents. We called you in because we've had a little incident at the school. The fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway.
RANDY
Oh dear.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Now, we realize this issue can have a troubling effect that can get blown out of proportion.
RANDY
Did they measure from the base or from the balls? [no one says a thing for six seconds]
MRS. STEVENS
How does the school let things like this happen??
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Now now, boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing. We... simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done.
RANDY
[stands up and faces the other parents] I'm a scientist. I think it's best I handle this.
[South Park Elementary, Fourth Grade Class. Mr. Garrison has given class time to Randy, who is reclining on Mr. Garrison's desk casually.]
RANDY
Hello students, my name is Dr. Marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday. How do a man and a woman... make a baby? Anybody? A man and woman, what do they do to make a baby? How about the little girl in the brown coat? Yeah you.
GIRL WITH BROWN COAT
[first appearance on the show] They have sex?
RANDY
Good! The man puts his penis [makes a fist with his left hand.] Okay? Into the woman's vagina. [pronounces the g with a heavy h sound and jabs his left arm through the air, through an imaginary vagina formed with his cupped right hand] Okay now, sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is, is actually important. But is it? When you boys measure your penis length, the truth is it doesn't really matter. What does matter is [starts writing the equation on the board: (L×d)+W/G)/(∠∝(2@t)] Length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared, okay? When we're talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure. We need a scale [pulls down the projector screen] and... [pulls something out of his back pocket] a protractor as well. [walks to a projector] Let's look at it on the graph here.. [wheels it into view and positions it right in front of the screen, then turns on the projector. A picture of a happy, naked man in profile appears on the screen. The length of his penis is 8 inches, the angle is 135 degrees] Follow along with me on your study sheets, kids.
[A classroom. A sign is shown which reads "1. know why you are mad 2. know what makes you mad 3. know how to let go of anger". Cartman and the others in attendance are seated in a circle with their arms folded and looking angry]
DOCTOR
I want to congratulate all of you for making the effort to come to anger management class.
BODYBUILDER
We didn't make any effort, we didn't have a choice!
TEA BAG PARTICIPANT
Yeah! This is bullshit!
DOCTOR
Together, we're gonna learn what makes us angry, okay? And how to better deal with it so we don't get ourselves into trouble anymore.
MICHAEL
So lame! Why doesn't everyone just die?!
TUONG LU KIM
Rook! Ifuh somebody ordereduh shitty beef, anduh complain because they say they ordereduh shitty shrimp, It's notuh my fault he gets the shitty chicken poured all over hisuh fuckin' head!
TEA BAG PARTICIPANT
We have good reason to be angry! This country is going to shit! We have exactly twelve days before the oil is gone, and our president is a socialist who wasn't even born in America!
DOCTOR
Right. See, what we all need to do is chaaannel our various reasons for anger, and learn to control it.
WIGGER
[stands up and grabs his crotch] Man, this shit wack, man. I just seen all this shit frontin' mahn. [drops into a wide leg stance] I don't understand, it like my pops ain't no fuckin' good mah. [makes a phone gesture with his other hand] Bitch be callin' me, tappin' that shit, man.
CARTMAN
Why the fuck am I here?!
DOCTOR
Well, Eric, because I know you want to... control your anger and become a better person.
CARTMAN
Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?!
DOCTOR
[panics and drops his pen] NO! No! I'm not saying that, at all. Please I, I'm just saying how a-, amazing you are for wanting to... l-lessen some of your more... less awesome attributes.
CARTMAN
Oh, that's cool.
[South Park Elementary, Fourth Grade Class. Randy continues his lecture.]
RANDY
And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the- what do we call it again? The yaw? The yaw of the shaft? What we finally get is the adjusted penis size, or, T.M.I. Any questions so far? Yes, little girl over there.
THERESA
What's a penis?
RANDY
[six second later, after mulling what his answer would be] ...Ah, good question. Ahh, the penis is the thing we're talking about that boys have that we're... measuring. [now quickly] Okay any other questions? Okay, so then let's move on to the example on your study sheet. How about you? Could you read the first example for the class? [a girl is shown] Example 1, young lady. Please read the problem out loud
RILEY
Example 1: Randy has a penis that is 4.4 inches in length.
RANDY
[writes the number on the board] Four point four inches...
RILEY
Its angle is 32 degrees. Its flaccid girth is one inch in diameter. His balls are seven centimeters from the base.
RANDY
Seven centimeters...
RILEY
Randy notes that the drift of his penis is four centimeters to penis right, and its dead weight is 0.5 kilograms.
RANDY
Great! And so divide by the 17. carry the 1, and we can see that Randy's adjusted penis size, or T.M.I., is... 6.3 inches. Do we got that? Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3. So how does our example person "Randy" compare to others on the T.M.I. scale? By referring again to the T.M.I. chart, we see that a T.M.I. of 6.3 is .8 inches more than the national average. [grins at the class]
[Anger Management Class, later.]
DOCTOR
Okay, what we're going to do now is get to the root of all your anger. Daniel, could you stand up please? [Daniel stands up with his arms still crossed.] What makes you the angriest, Daniel?
DANIEL
[the Tea Bag participant] Stupid-ass blind liberals!
DOCTOR
Okay, great. Chase, could you stand up and pretend to be a stupid-ass blind liberal? [the bodybuilder stands up and walks up to Daniel] And what makes you angriest, Chase?
CHASE
Scrawny-ass sissies!
DOCTOR
Okay, Daniel's a scrawny-ass sissy, he just cut in front of you in line at the bank. Go!
CHASE
Hey! What, do you think I got a small dick?! Huh?! [strikes him on the chest]
DANIEL
Huh I don't have a small penis! My wife thinks my penis is perfectly fine!
DOCTOR
[doesn't say anything for a few seconds] ...Okay. Uh, why don't we uh do some roleplaying now with Wayne D, who gets angriest at his mom. [Wayne D stands and moves to the center of the room] Gretchen, can you play Wayne D's mom for us? [Gretchen, a butch woman, stands up and walks to the middle of the room]
WAYNE D
Yo, bitch! You think you bad? Just 'cause you're a mom don't mean I can't put a cap in your ass, bitch, mang!
GRETCHEN
I may be female on the outside, but I still have a bigger penis than you!
WAYNE D
[begins to tear up and drops the gangsta act] I don't have a small penis! Don't say that, it isn't true! It isn't true!
TUONG LU KIM
[stands up and yells in frustration] That's enough! I've beem sick of everyone talk aboutuh penis shize!
DANIEL
[stands up and yells] Yeah, it doesn't matter! It doesn't matter!
DOCTOR
[if he wasn't sure before, he is now] Does... everyone here have an issue with their penis size?
CHASE
No.
GRETCHEN
No.
TUONG LU KIM
Not me.
DANIEL
Nnnooo.
WAYNE D
No, my, my shit be packing, manh.
CARTMAN
My penis is 13 inches long.
DOCTOR
Hmmm.
[Mr. Garrison's room, day. The kids have another guest speaker]
GUEST SPEAKER
Kids, my name is Rebecca Turnod, and I'm an "actual doctor" of human sexuality and behavior. Unfortunately you have been taught some very wrong ideas in the past couple of days, and I am here to set things straight.
WENDY
Thank God.
MS. TURNOD
I want you to try and forget these wild theories and understand that all that's important when it comes to a man and a woman making love is actually [turns around, picks up some chalk and starts writing down the equation on the board: ((L×G)/(∠A°))÷(M/W)] Length times girth over angle of the shaft divided by mass over width- [the classroom door flies open and Randy is at the door, incensed]
RANDY
PUTAIN D'MENTEUR!!! [runs up and attacks Ms. Turnod. She responds with a punch and a kick to the balls. They trade punches as the class looks on. Randy knocks her to the floor, gets on top of her, and keeps punching away]
[Anger Management Class, a day or two later. Randy is now in there with the other seven members.]
DOCTOR
We all want to welcome our new member, Randy. Say hi to everyone, Randy.
RANDY
Aw, suck it! All o'ya!
DOCTOR
Now, we've all been trying to channel our anger in more constructive ways, Randy. Why don't you share what's bothering you?
RANDY
You just don't go around changing math! Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?!
DANIEL
Goddamn right! Socialist fascist!
RANDY
[has a lighter and tries to torch a chair with it] Power to the people! Burn it down! Burn it down!!
DOCTOR
Mr. Marsh, this is what we're here to try and work on, okay?
RANDY
No dude, fuck you! We're burnin' this shit!
DOCTOR
If you take a minute to think about your anger, and give- [the chair lights up in flames] whoa! Whoawhoawhoa!
RANDY
Yeeaahh!
CARTMAN
Yeah dude!
WAYNE D
Man, that shit be burnin' an' shit, manh!
GRETCHEN
Yeeaahh!
CARTMAN
[takes his chair and swings it against a wall, where it shatters] Yeah!
[The class begins to riot. Randy walks to some curtains and sets them on fire.]
RANDY
Yeeaahh! [the office is soon destroyed]
[FedEx Office, day. A clerk and customer do business]
CLERK
Welcome to FedEx. How can I help you today?
CUSTOMER
Yes, I've got some birthday presents I need shipped.
CLERK
Alrighty, let's see what kind of-
RANDY
[runs in with the other anger-management class members] Burn it down! [the other members go forth destroying the store. Randy walks up to a huge poster and sets it on fire]
CARTMAN
Burn it down, dude! [Daniel demolishes boxes with a bat while Gretchen takes a pipe to other boxes. Michael holds a knife and kicks some boxes while Cartman takes a small hammer to a huge box. Wayne D fires away with a pistol while Chase fires away with a semi-automatic rifle and Tuong Lu Kim swings a Chinese cleaver around ]
RANDY
[approaches the counter to set it on fire] Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their Federal Express! [Gretchen reappears to bash more stuff up]
[A news report. The media got wind of the riot]
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing outside the FedEx in Fairplay, Colorado, where a radical political group has taken several people hostage. They call themselves the pissed-off and angry party. And they allowed me to speak with them moments ago.
[Recorded earlier. The FedEx staff and customers are huddled on the ground while Cartman and the others stand near them with their weapons drawn.]
RANDY
[holding the clerk hostage] This is a call to all angry people! We've had enough! We're gonna hit the government where it hurts! Right in the Federal Express!
FIELD REPORTER
What exactly are you angry about?
RANDY
We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media- control, and the-
CARTMAN
The Jews!
RANDY
Yeah, Jews! And all this stuff that the government's doing!
FIELD REPORTER
You've got a lot of people scared. What are your demands?
RANDY
Well first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!
CHASE
Yeeaahh!
RANDY
And we want-
DANIEL
[runs into view] And we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate! [walks offscreen]
RANDY
Yeah, we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate! And um,
WAYNE D
[enters from the other side] And my mom gotta stop trippin', manh. [grabs his crotch] Bitch be trippin' all the time, manh. [walks offscreen]
RANDY
Yeah, we want our moms to stop trippin', man! 'Cause the bitches be trippin' all the time! And I think that- uhh, [looks back at the other members.] is that it?
CARTMAN
No, and fuck Kyle!
RANDY
Oh yeah, and fuck Kyle! Surgeon general's resignation, Obama's real birth certificate, moms to stop trippin', and fuck Kyle! You got that?! Or else we're gonna bring the Federal Express to a grinding halt!
FIELD REPORTER
Does it bother you that the Federal Express is not affiliated at all with the Federal Government?
RANDY
No. No, that doesn't matter! [releases the clerk and turns to look at the other members] Fuck, really?!
[Butters' house, day. Butters is measuring his penis again and again and putting down his measurements on a sheet of paper on a small table next to him]
LINDA
Butters, what are you doing?
BUTTERS
Homework! I just don't get it! That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average! I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I., I have a micropenis! [throws down his pencil and notepad in disgust]
LINDA
Your T.M.I.?
BUTTERS
I don't understand it! An' I'm startin'- uhh, I'm starting to feel angry! Rawr! [kicks his bed]
LINDA
Butters, put your clothes on.
BUTTERS
[begins to vent, pacing back and forth] Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me! And the government... wuh, which is led by fascists, and everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe. I wanna go and drive a Hummer, that's what I wanna do! I wanna drive a car that goes, that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr!
LINDA
Butters, what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small? [outside, some car rev by. Linda and Butters go to his window to look]
DRIVER 1
[in an SUV on monster wheels] Hey, everyone who's pissed off and angry is rallying to take down America! Join the fight! [peels off]
DRIVER 2
[in a little red Corvette] We're gonna take down the Federal Expresses, the American Apparels, and the American Furniture Warehouse! [peels off]
DRIVER 3
[in a massive truck] We're fed up and we've had enough! [peels off]
[The surgeon general's office, day. The surgeon general is there surrounded by her staff.]
AIDE 1
Surgeon general, twelve more FedExes have been taken over; the Pissed Off and Angry Party is gaining more support!
AIDE 2
They've shut down American Airlines and American Apparels all over the country. We have to ask you to step down.
REBECCA TURNOD
Are you seriously saying we're going to give in to their demands?
AIDE 2
They're all really angry. We have to make them stop. Is the team standing by to fuck that little boy Kyle?
AIDE 3
Team is standing by, sir.
DOCTOR
[charges in] 'Scuse me. Excuse me, let me through.
REBECCA TURNOD
Who is this?
DOCTOR
[approaches the surgeon general's desk] Surgeon general, I believe I know why this is happening. I have found a direct correlation between the anger, and T.M.I. [goes to a whiteboard and beings writing out the equation: Anger equals (L×W)/(M^2-∠)+YAW ] Anger equals length times width over mass squared minus angle of the shaft plus yaw. [finishes and looks at the surgeon general] Look, we all get angry, but when someone is consistently angry or always finding new reasons to be angry, it means they have a very very very very small dick.
REBECCA TURNOD
Your theory is fine, doctor, but it doesn't matter. The T.M.I. equation is true solid science, which cannot be changed. There's nothing we can do about it.
DOCTOR
Isn't there? Isn't... there?
[The FedEx in Fairplay, thoroughly destroyed, day.]
DANIEL
We've waited long enough, Randy! Let's start killin' these sons of bitches!
WOMAN
No, please!
CARTMAN
Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want!
WAYNE D
Yo let's cap these bitches, manh! Let's cap an leave em at the back of the building, manh!
MICHAEL
[watching a working TV, turns around and calls the other members] Hey, come over here. Look. [turns to watch TV again as the others arrive]
ANNOUNCER
We interrupt this newscast for an important message from the surgeon general.
REBECCA TURNOD
Fellow Americans, as you all know, the T.M.I. scale was implemented long ago to assure that each and every American could accurately measure their junk. The established equation is a hundred percent accurate.
RANDY
Rrrr!
DANIEL
Shhh.
REBECCA TURNOD
However, due to recently collected data, we are making one change. [the T.M.I. scale is shown] The national average for penis length is now officially moved, from 6 inches to 1.5 inches. [the lower regions of the chart shrink and the NICE region takes up the slack] Anyone with a T.M.I. of over 1.5 inches is considered "above average". [she puts her stamp of approval to it]
RANDY
[takes a step back. Everyone has a smile on their face now, except for Cartman. An electric organ begins to play in the background].
The winds of change are blowin'.
There's excitement in the air.
Can you feel it? It's electric and magical.
The happy train's on track.
'Cause America is BACK!
Woohoo! Come on!
[the group throw their weapons aside and dance in celebration as they run to the exit. Cartman stands alone.]
CARTMAN
Wait, what?
[FedEx, exterior. Randy pushes the FedEx door open and leads the group outside in a dance. A few police officers run up with smiles on their faces and join them.]
RANDY
America is back!
America is back!
CARTMAN
[runs outside and tries to get their attention] Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener!
RANDY
We're back, we're back, we're back back back!
America is back!
CARTMAN
I'm still fucking angry!
RANDY
Back and we're back and we're back!
We're so back, we're so back back back back back back!
End of T.M.I.

synopsis:Kyle gets in on the ground floor of Cartman's latest business venture, The Crack Baby Athletic Association.

script:Crack Baby Athletic Association

[A golden Buddha is shown in a garden. Around him are smaller Buddhas, most of which are golden as well. In front of all this are Terrance and Phillip, dressed in saffron cloth. Terrance farts on Phillip, causing Stan and Kyle to laugh. They are watching an episode of the Terrance and Phillip show.]
PHILLIP
That one was smelly. Take this, Dalai Terrance. [sharts on Terrance. Terrance and Phillip laugh, Stan and Kyle laugh]
KYLE
[through his laughter] Dude, this is probably the best episode they've ever done!
STAN
I know! This is awesome!
KYLE
I'm so happy! [wipes off the tip of his nose]
ANNOUNCER
Terrance and Phillip will be right back after these messages. [a commercial comes on]
SINGER
So much sufferin'... [continues singing in the background. Pictures of babies in bad shape begin to appear]
KYLE
Oh no! It's that [puts up his right hand to block his view, shuts his eyes and looks away] super-sad Sarah McLachlan commercial! Look away!
STAN
What?
KYLE
Dude, this is the saddest commercial ever! Don't watch! [a baby tries to get his bearing in order to crawl, but slowly collapses. Another one looks in a mirror, then lowers his hed]
SARAH MCLACHLAN
These are images of babies born addicted to crack cocaine. Their mothers have abandoned them. They lie in the dark, crying, with nobody to hold them.
STAN
Aw dude, that's so sad. [puts up his right hand and looks away]
KYLE
Why do they have to put this on TV?! [a doctor carries a baby in order to calm him down]
SARAH MCLACHLAN
Their world is bleak, lonely, and hopeless. [McLachlan is finally shown] Hello, I'm Sarah McLachlan, and I was famous for two months. Each year, thousands of babies are born addicted to crack and lie in hospitals without a mother to hold them. [more pictures are shown] Won't you volunteer today? Look at these pictures. They need you.
STAN
Awww dude, awwww.
KYLE
Aaaggh, God.
SARAH MCLACHLAN
Please. Go to your local hospital now. Here are some more pictures. [one of a baby with two boils on his face, another one of a sickly baby crawling]
KYLE
I can't take it anymore! I gotta go volunteer, dude! [runs off, leaving Stan on the sofa looking away]
[Colorado Medical Center, day. A nurse walks down the hall with Kyle]
NURSE
It's a really great thing you're doing. We have so many abandoned babies and not enough people like yourself who care.
KYLE
What exactly can I do to help?
NURSE
Just hold them, talk to them, play with them. You'll find they're so hungry for attention. Here's our crack baby ward now. [a large room full of baby cribs] I know it isn't much but, we don't have a lot of funding, you see.
KYLE
Oh it's, it's so sad.
NURSE
Come, come, right over here. [leads him to a therapy room] We have a decent room here where you can play with the babies and nurture them. It's actually really great you're volunteering now, because our other little boy volunteer is just finishing up. [the door opens and out walks Cartman]
CARTMAN
Oh. Hey Kyle.
KYLE
[at first surprised, now suspicious] What are you doing here?
CARTMAN
I'm volunteering.
KYLE
[remains suspicious] ...What are you doing here?!
CARTMAN
[firmly] I'm volunteering my time, Kyle.
NURSE
Young Eric has been here every day for the past two weeks, bless his heart.
KYLE
Why do you have a video camera?
CARTMAN
I'm volunteering, Kyle! It just so happens Sarah McLachlan touched my heart. Is that so hard to believe?! [to the nurse] Goodbye, Ms. Williams. See you tomorrow. [walks away]
MS. WILLIAMS
Bye, Eric. [Kyle just watches as Cartman goes to the elevator and closes its doors behind him]
KYLE
I'm sorry, can I come back in just a little bit?
MS. WILLIAMS
Certainly. We're... here all the time, unfortunately.
KYLE
Thanks. [walks to a window looking over a parking lot. The nurse walks off in the opposite direction]
[As Kyle watches, Cartman walks through the parking lot and meets Craig. Cartman looks over his shoulder on his way to meet Craig. Kyle decides to follow them and takes the next elevator down. Cartman and Craig stop on the sidewalk around the medical center. Cartman checks his watch as if he's waiting for someone. Day has turned to evening. Kyle hides in the shadows and looks on. Clyde walks up to Cartman and Craig, who has a camera of his own. The three of them chat a bit, then walk away laughing. Kyle keeps his distance, but follows them nonetheless. Cartman, Craig, and Clyde walk up to a slender building in town, next to Tom's Rhinoplasty, and enter it. Kyle arrives a couple of second laster. He enters as well and climbs up some stairs, but doesn't reach the second floor. Instead, he stays a few steps from the top and watches as Cartman, Craig, and Clyde put some mini-VHS tapes on a table for Butters. Butters, typing away on a computer, becomes a video editor, splicing videos from their tapes together.]
KYLE
What's going on?!
BUTTERS
[startled] Wuuuuhhhhhh! [falls off the chair]
CARTMAN
Ah, crap! [rolls his eyes]
[Moments later, Cartman, Craig, Clyde, and Butters sit at a table in the slender building and look at Kyle]
CARTMAN
Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital.
KYLE
So what are you doing?!
CARTMAN
What if I were to tell you there's a way to help those poor babies born addicted to crack, and give them a future as well.
KYLE
Alright, what is it?!
CARTMAN
Crack baby basketball. [Kyle pushes his chair away from the table, gets up, and begins to leave] Whow, whoa Kyle, don't tell on us! [Kyle reaches the staurs] We could actually really use you!
KYLE
Why do you need me?
CARTMAN
Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping. [Kyle heads downstairs] Dammit! [Kyle leaves the building; Cartman races down the stairs to catch up to him] Kyle, wait I- [Kyle slams the door shut and walks away. Cartman opens it and catches up to Kyle] Kyle, hold on a second!
KYLE
I knew you were doing something terrible!
CARTMAN
What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?!
KYLE
Lots of people will when I tell them!
CARTMAN
We made a thousand dollars in eleven days. [Kyle stops walking, then turns around]
KYLE
You what?
CARTMAN
Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack.
KYLE
A thousand dollars.
CARTMAN
Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time.
[Denny's, night. Cartman leads the other four to Denny's. He opens the door for them. Boom Boom Pow by the Black Eye Peas begins to play in the background]
THE BLACK EYE PEAS
Here we go,
Here we go,
Satellite radio.
Y'all gettin hit wit the (Boom, boom!)
Beats so big, I'm stepping on leprechauns
CARTMAN
After you. [the other four enter. Inside, it is packed with people waiting for a table to open.]
KYLE
There's a big wait to sit down.
WAITER
Ah, Mr. Cartman. We have your table waiting, sir.
CARTMAN
Come on. [the other boys follow]
[The boys are seated at a booth and enjoying their meals. They also have a bucket of champagne on ice next to them. They are talking loudly over the music in the background]
THE BLACK EYE PEAS
Shitting on y'all wit the (Boom, boom!)
Shitting on y'all wit the (Boom, boom!)
Shitting on y'all wit the
This beat be bumping, bumping
This beat go boom boom!
Let the beat rock
Let the beat rock
Let the beat rock
This beat be bumping, bumping
This beat go boom boom!
CARTMAN
We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day.
KYLE
Jesus Christ.
CRAIG
It's awesome.
CARTMAN
It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials.
BUTTERS
Every single night.
CARTMAN
Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert.
KYLE
Wow...
[In the back seat of a limo. Kyle is between Cartman and Butters]
CARTMAN
We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights.
[A karaoke bar. Butters is rapping over "Boom Boom Pow" and dancing to a teleprompter. The other boys are sitting down between two Asian ladies, who are holding bottles of Sprite and various plates of food are on their table]
BUTTERS
I like that boom boom pow
Them chicks be jackin my style
They try and copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now
I'm so three thousand and eight
You so two thousand and late
I got that boom boom boom
That future boom boom boom
Let me get it now
CARTMAN
You've got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up, Kyle. And best of all, it's all charity, so it's tax free. [Kyle is about to give in, but still has his doubts. He look down and away]
[Back in the slender building, day. Cartman and Kyle can be seen through the second-story window]
THE BLACK EYE PEAS
(Boom boom boom)
Gotta get that (Boom boom boom)
Gotta get that (Boom boom boom)
Gotta get that (Boom boom boom)
Gotta get that (Boom boom boom)
That (Boom boom boom)
That (Boom boom boom)
(Boom boom)
CARTMAN
Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you.
KYLE
[turns away from the window and walks a few steps] And it actually helps the crack babies. It's like volunteering but, but we just make a little on the side.
CARTMAN
Somebody's gotta eat all that bacon, Kyle. Might as well be us. Welcome to the firm. [pats Kyle on the shoulder and walks away. Kyle walks back to the window and looks out over the street below. He smiles]
[Some boys are in Stan's backyard playing catch with a football. Seen are Jason, Tolkien, Jimmy, Timmy, and Stan. Tolkien stands next to Stan]
STAN
Go long, Tolkien! Go go! [Tolkien runs across the yard. Stan throws the ball and Tolkien catches it]
KYLE
Hey Stan. Dude, I want you to have this. It's the twenty bucks I owed you plus thirty dollars interest.
STAN
Wow, really? [takes the money and starts counting it]
KYLE
I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff.
STAN
Doing what?
KYLE
Crack baby... basketball.
STAN
[somewhat startled] ...Dude.
KYLE
No no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. Here, check it out. [leads Kyle inside and to his room, then gets on the computer and goes to a Web site.] See look, we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack. It's really getting popular! [soon, babies are heard. Kyle is showing Stan one of the Crack Baby Fight videos] I mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before. [Stan stays quiet] It, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? You see that? Two million hits. [Stan stays quiet] Did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at Denny's?
[A run-down little white house in the poor part of town. Cartman and Butters approach it and knock on the front door. A pregnant woman answers it.]
CARTMAN
Betsy MacIntosh?
BETSY MACINTOSH
Whatta you want?
CARTMAN
We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again?
BETSY MACINTOSH
Oh Gohhhd.
CARTMAN
We need to speak with you, ma'am. [she allows them to come in, and they sit on the sofa while she sits in the armchair.]
BETSY MACINTOSH
It's like these voices in my head won't be quiet until I use again.
CARTMAN
And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine?
BETSY MACINTOSH
I don't want my baby born addicted to drugs! But I can't stop! [begins to cry]
CARTMAN
[looks at Butters and smiles] Well ma'am, I have some exciting news. [takes his briefcase and opens it, taking out a letter] We would like your child to play for the Crack Baby Athletic Association. [Butters claps in approval]
BETSY MACINTOSH
[takes the letter and reads it] The what?
CARTMAN
We believe that St. Mary's is the best hospital for your child, and we're prepared to offer it a full ride. Now, do you know yet if your child is male or female, or so deformed you'll never be able to tell?
BETSY MACINTOSH
They said it's a boy.
CARTMAN
[holds out a pen] Just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for St. Mary's.
BETSY MACINTOSH
How much will he make?
CARTMAN
Well, nothing. Crack baby players can't make a salary, based on the rules.
BETSY MACINTOSH
So what? You would make money off of my child? That doesn't seem fair.
CARTMAN
I don't make the rules, ma'am, I just think them up and write them down. Now, if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the-
BETSY MACINTOSH
Cain't you change the rules?
CARTMAN
Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states "benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being." I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters? [Butters smiles, reaches for his briefcase, and opens it]
[Stan's living room. Stan is on the sofa playing a video game. Kyle enters, walks up to Stan, looks down at the floor, and picks up where he left off]
KYLE
Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need. [glances at Stan] Yeah. It's pretty cool, dude. Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know? Huh, or be able to do anything. [glances at Stan again] Just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting. It isn't exploiting them. They're finding a useful place in society. What's so unethical about that? [glances at Stan and waits a bit longer for a reply]
STAN
...You sound like Cartmam.
KYLE
[puts his right hand on his stomach as if punched there] Ooogh. Dude, the thing is, we're not the ones that made them crack babies. That's their moms' goddamned fault!
STAN
Yeah, I'm sure that's what Cartman would say too.
KYLE
I do not sound like Cartman goddamnit! [frightens himself and glances at Stan, then look away] Okay, so, see ya. [goes out the front door and closes it behind him]
[The slender building, day. Butters is at a desk waiting for calls. Cartman is in his corner office talking to someone on his phone]
CARTMAN
It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!
CLYDE
We're just having a hard time finding him.
CARTMAN
[slams his fists on the table] Slash is not hard to find! He'll show up to play anywhere if you pay him! He played at my eighth birthday party, for Christ's sake! Look! Look! He's playing at Lakewood Mall right now! [a shot of Slash on the TV on the wall] Now you guys get down there- [the phone rings] Oh crap, the president of EA Sports is calling. Just go! Go! [Craig and Clyde turn around and leave] Mr. Peters, how are you? Yes sir, we're very excited about our deal with you as well. [As Clyde and Craig go downstairs, Kyle comes upstairs. Kyle looks pissed as he stops at Cartman's desk] Oh, we know the video game version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a big hit too. [softly] Hey Kyle. Have a seat.
KYLE
I need to talk to you. [puts a folder down on the desk]
CARTMAN
Mr. Peters, can I call you back? Our company accountant needs me. Yes, he is Jewish. Okay, thanks, Mr. Peters. Bye. [hangs up] How's it goin', man?
KYLE
[opens the folder] In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies.
CARTMAN
They can't make money. It's against the rules.
KYLE
But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that.
CARTMAN
Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing.
KYLE
Gut they're the ones risking injury.
CARTMAN
What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?!
KYLE
The government could come after us, Cartman.
CARTMAN
We're a non-profit company, Kyle.
KYLE
So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go?
CARTMAN
Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look. [shows him to the newest addition to the office]
KYLE
A hot tub?!
CARTMAN
It's not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it. [Kyle goes up the steps, dips his finger into the liquid, and tastes it]
KYLE
Gravy?
CARTMAN
Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.
KYLE
No way.
CARTMAN
A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime? [pretty soon they're both in the hot tub. A lot of McDonald's french fries sit behind them.] Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this "poutine".
KYLE
I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal.
CARTMAN
It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.
KYLE
What other companies?
[One such company. The University of Colorado at Boulder, day. In an office, a middle-aged man is reading a document at his desk]
SECRETARY
[off-screen] Dean Howland, a representative from another prestigious institution is here to see you.
DEAN HOWLAND
A what? Send him in. [the doors open and in walks Cartman, dressed as a Southern gentleman]
CARTMAN
[speaking like a Georgia plantation owner] Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade.
DEAN HOWLAND
In the what?
CARTMAN
My peaches, what a wonderful office you got yourself heah. Certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness, don't ye. Well let me get right down to it theyen. Like yourself, [opens a humidor and takes out a cigar] I am also in the slave trade. [takes a long whiff of the sealed cigar, then puts it into his inside coat pocket and pats it down] But at the moment I find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues. Was wonderin' if you could share some secrets.
DEAN HOWLAND
I have... no idea what you're talkin' about.
CARTMAN
[walks over to a picture of the UCB basketball team] You have some might strong-lookin' workers heah, sahr. I'd be willin' to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks.
DEAN HOWLAND
Are you referring to our student athletes?
CARTMAN
Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- "student atheletes" then?
DEAN HOWLAND
Look, there are [catches his breath] good reasons why our student athletes cannot be paid, young man.
CARTMAN
I ain't arguin'. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right?
DEAN HOWLAND
We do [slams his fist on his desk] not own slaves, and we have no desire to own slaves.
CARTMAN
But of course you own slaves, because, oh... riiight. [clears his throat] Of couse you don't have desire to own slaves, son, neither do I. And if there was any government agency listenin' in on this heah conversation, they should know that we'er not talkin' 'bout slave ownership. Gaauu. [waits a few seconds, then takes off his hat and softly says] Alright, so now, how do you get around not paying your slaves.
DEAN HOWLAND
Get out! This is a prestigious university and I am not saying one more word to you!
CARTMAN
You think you can do whatever you want 'cause your corporation is a university?! [walks towards the entrance and opens the door] This country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldn't hog all the slaves, while the rest of us wallow in poverteh! Screw you sahr, I'm goin' home! [walks out and closes the door]
[Stan's bedroom, night. Stan is sleeping. It's rare that he sleeps without his hat on, but this is one of those nights. He opens his eyes, closes them, opens them again, and stirs. He seems to have heard something behind him, so he turns over and sees Kyle standing in the middle of his room, talking to himself.]
KYLE
Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies. [Stan just blinks, still half-awake. Kyle turns and looks at him] Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken!
STAN
[blinks sleepily] McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of... KFC gravy?
KYLE
It happens to be called poutine in Montreal! [turns around and walks out]
[The slender building, day. Cartman is chewing out someone on the phone]
CARTMAN
How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal!
CLYDE
We must have just missed him. He was playing at Cherry Creek mall and then Flat Irons mall. Now we don't know where to go because Slash is playing the Pavilion in Colorado Springs in the Gigadome in Moscow later this afternoon.
CARTMAN
How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?!
CLYDE
We don't know. He's everywhere.
CARTMAN
Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address!
CRAIG
Oh, that's a good idea.
CARTMAN
Yeah it's a good idea! Now go get us Slash for halftime! [slams the receiver down on the base] Jesus Christ! [Kyle walks in with a stand and some schematics] Are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn!
KYLE
[setting up] Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies.
CARTMAN
...What?
KYLE
I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care!
CARTMAN
Oh my God... It's genius, Kyle!
KYLE
...What?
CARTMAN
This the answer to our problems! A three hundred thousand dollar building, but we buy ourselves a million dollars' worth of goodwill with the public. We can say we gave our "student athletes" a place to live and grow for a few years. It's like moral teflon! I knew we needed a Jew in this company, Kyle! Great work! [hugs Kyle, who is quite puzzled at Cartman's reaction]
[United States Post Office in South Park, day. Craig and Clyde are talking to the postmaster there]
POSTMASTER
Let me get this straight. You kids want me to tell you where Slash lives?
CRAIG
Please sir, it's very important.
POSTMASTER
Well I'm afraid I can't do that, kids.
CLYDE
But we have a big deal with EA Sports that depends on it.
POSTMASTER
Come on! Kids write to Slash every day, but it all just goes into this big pile over here. [leads them to the pile] The reason I can't tell you where Slash lives is because he don't live nowhere. Don't you ever wonder how Slash can be aaall those places at the same time? It's because he's made up! He-
POSTMAN
Don't spoil it for the kids, Marty. It's up to parents to tell their children Slash ain't real. [Craig and Clyde look at each other]
[The Donovan house, day. Betsy is washing dishes in the kitchen when the phone rings. Roger answers the phone.]
ROGER
Hullo?
CLYDE
Dad, is Slash real or make-believe?
ROGER
Ohh dear. Clyde's asking about Slash.
BETSY
[turns around] Oooo well, the day had to come.
ROGER
Clyde, the truth is Slash isn't a person. He's more like a... feeling in your heart, you know?
CLYDE
Slash isn't real.
CRAIG
Get out of here.
BETSY
[takes the phone] Clyde, sometimes people like to pretend with make-believe characters. He's not really a lie, he's like ahh...
ROGER
[takes the phone back] Er he's like love. People all over the world dress up like Slash and have different names for Slash. The Dutch call him Vunter Slash.
CLYDE
He's made up and people dress like him and pretend to be him to their kids.
ROGER
Your mother's Dutch, you know, Clyde. Ha- how did that old folk song go, honey?
BETSY
Vunter Slash kapunshka
BOTH PARENTS
Shpielerin manshunshka
[Denny's, day. Kyle has brought Stan to the restaurant with Cartman and Butters. Craig and Clyde are still on a mission]
KYLE
And so, thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with EA Sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies. Did you see the blueprints? The babies will have their own putt putt golf course. [gets no reaction from Stan] Why does it matter how much I'm making, Stan? If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter?
CLYDE
[arriving with Craig] You guys! You guuys! We've got some bad news. Slash isn't real. [he has a book under his arm]
CARTMAN
What?
CRAIG
Slash isn't real. He's a made-up person that represents care and giving, and people dress up like him and lie to their kids.
BUTTERS
Slash is make-believe??
CLYDE
Here, look for yourself. [plops the book onto the booth table] He's based on the fable of a Dutch saint named Vunter Slash. [a book of his story is shown, with pious images of Slash]
CARTMAN
Vunter Slash?
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
But then, who played at my eighth birthday party?
CLYDE
One of our parents.
CARTMAN
But then, who was the guitar player for Guns N' Roses?
CLYDE
One of our parents!
CARTMAN
Are you fucking serious? [no one speaks for a few seconds]
STAN
You guys are ten years old and you just figured out that Slash isn't real? Oh my God. [leaves the table]
CARTMAN
You knew about this??
STAN
[stands next to Craig and Clyde] My parents told me Slash wasn't real when I was five. Jehesus Christ. [blinks his eyes and walks away. The others are dumbstruck for several seconds]
BUTTERS
Well what the heck do we do now?
KYLE
Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all!
[EA Sports, day. The five boys stand inside Mr. Peters' office.]
MR. PETERS
[speaking with the same Southern accent Cartman used earlier] Boys, I want to thank you for bringin' the CB double A franchise here to EA Sports. You've made us a lohhht of monih.
KYLE
Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing.
MR. PETERS
[serves himself a drink] Yes, our lawyers are damn good. But you didn't get nothin'. Why, you boys got experience, didn'tcha? You got a chance to play in the big leagues. Sure, we here at EA might have made all the monih, but you little workers had a chance to make some'in' of yourselves. I'd give you some free video games, but it's against the rules. [smokes a cigar]
KYLE
You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go!
MR. PETERS
Oh, well, fuck 'em. And fuck you too. I piss in your faces. [smokes the cigar again. The boys are dumbstruck for a few seconds]
CARTMAN
I just can't believe Slash isn't real,
BUTTERS
I know. It's messin' with my head so hard.
KYLE
You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to!
CARTMAN
I know, right? I was always extra good before my birthday too because I was told Slash would come and play for me.
MR. PETERS
[sits in his chair and puts his feet up on the desk] Well boys, this has been real educational and all, but now let's part with that old EA Sports sayin': "Get the fuck out of my buildin'!"
[Outside, day. Somewhere around the medical center, Stan and Kyle walk along]
KYLE
It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go. [something grabs his attention] No way! [a brand new building is shown: "South Park Orphanage for Crack Babies"] This is it!
STAN
It's what?
KYLE
This is it, Stan! [runs across the street and enters the orphanage. Stan trails behind. Several workers are putting up wallpaper] It's just like I designed it. There's the miniature gold course over there! And slides and uh, [sees Ms. Williams] excuse me, what is this place?
MS. WILLIAMS
Isn't it wonderful? All the crack babies will have a home now.
KYLE
But who paid for all this? [Stan catches up and the nurse leaves]
STAN
[tugs at Kyle's coat] Kyle, Kyle! Look. [in a corner sits one of Slash's hats and one of his guitars]
KYLE
You don't think that-? But he isn't real.
STAN
Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all.

synopsis:Butters' parents take him to see a specialist.

script:City Sushi

[Downtown South Park. There's traffic and people on the sidewalk. Among all that is a small postman who looks pretty familiar. The postman stops at a kitchenware place and knocks on the door. A cashier comes to the door and opens it]
BUTTERS
Hello sir. Postman Butters with a special delivery for you. [hands him a flyer]
CASHIER
What's this?
BUTTERS
An all-new sushi restaurant just opened in town. Try their lunch specials.
CASHIER
Thanks.
BUTTERS
You can count on Postman Butters! [salutes and leaves. As he does so, the cashier makes a ball out of the flyer and tosses it away. Butters doesn't notice, but instead sees a woman coming up and hands her a flyer] Special delivery, ma'am. [sees a man coming up and hands him a flyer. The woman crumples up her flyer and tosses it away] Here you are, sir. [the man balls up and tosses his flyer away] Brand new sushi restaurant in town. [Butters sees another man and hands him a flyer] A flyer for you, from Postman Butters! [the man crumples up his flyer and tosses is away. Butters ends up in front of City Wok and enters. He approaches the counter]
TUONG LU KIM
Welcome to Shitty Wok. Can I take a order prease?
BUTTERS
Hello, sir. Postman Butters here with a special delivery for you.
TUONG LU KIM

BUTTERS
It's a coupon for a brand-new Asian restaurant that just opened up in town.
TUONG LU KIM

BUTTERS

TUONG LU KIM

BUTTERS

TUONG LU KIM

[Inside City Sushi. Butters follows Mr. Kim in]
MR. TAKIYAMA
Welcome to City Sushi. Can I take er order prease?
TUONG LU KIM
What's the big idea putting your Shitty Sushi right next to my Shitty Wok?!
MR. TAKIYAMA

MR. TAKIYAMA

[Butters' house, day. Sgt. Yates and another office bring Butters home. Sgt. Yates knocks, Mr. Stotch answers]
STEVEN
Hello?
SGT. YATES
Sir, does this mailman belong to you?
STEPHEN
That's my son. Is there a problem, officer?
SGT. YATES
There's been an Asian turf war, sir, and your son appears to have caused it.
STEPHEN
What?! An Asian turf war- Butters! You are grounded!
BUTTERS
But, sir, i was just handing out coupons for-
STEPHEN
Don't talk back to me! [Butters goes inside]
SGT. YATES
We'll send a bill for the damages, [the officers turn and leave] but in the meantime, please keep a closer eye on your child, sir? [Stephen closes the door]
[Butters' house, inside. Linda meets Stephen at the foot of the stairs as he has words with Butters]
STEPHEN
Go up to your room, now! [Butters goes upstairs]
LINDA
What's going on?
STEPHEN
Butters started an Asian turf war!
LINDA
Oh, for the love of Pete! What is wrong with that boy?
STEPHEN
I don't know, but it's clear it isn't our parenting! We're awesome! He must have mental problems. I think we'd batter have him checked out, Linda.
[Center for Criminally Insane Children. Inside, a doctor is in a lab with Butters as Linda and Stephen wait outside. The doctor opens the door and sighs. He meets with Butters' parents.]
STEPHEN
Well, Dr. Janus?
DR. JANUS
I'm afraid I have some bad news. Your son is suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder.
LINDA
What?
DR. JANUS
There are several distinct personalities going on in there. One is named "Postman Butters" and yet another is "Fireman Butters." And then there's even "Inspector Butters" and uh, "Professor Chaos".
LINDA
Oh my God!
DR. JANUS
From what I gather, he seems to mostly jump in and out of personalities when he's outside playing. Sometimes he's a cowboy and other times he's an Indian, and the two seem to be at constant odds.
LINDA
Oh, poor Butters! [starts crying]
STEPHEN
Doctor, what can we do? Should we ground him?
DR. JANUS
No, I don't think grounding him would do much good at this point. [glances at Butters] What your son needs now is lots of tender loving... medication. Heavy medication.
[News report, outside the two Asian restaurants, day]
FIELD REPORTER

TUONG LU KIM
[comes out of his restaurant and sees the sign] What the fuuuck?! [goes into City Sushi] You see what happen?!
MR. TAKIYAMA

[Butters' house, night. Steven is reading the newspaper at his den.]
LINDA
[runs in] Stephen! Stephen, come quick! It's Butters! [runs off. He follows her out. They reach the backyard] Look!
BUTTERS
[pretending he's a trucker in his cab] Honk honk! Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9. It's clean clear out to Flagtown! Looks like we got ourselves a convoy! Honk honk!
LINDA
Now he thinks he's a truck driver. [cries into Stephen's shoulder]
STEPHEN
Oh God the medication isn't working!
BUTTERS
It's okay, buddy, you've got a smokey on your tail, bug Big Rig Butters is here to help! Vroovrooom. [Stephen runs up to him]

MR. TAKIYAMA
Oh, you mean a treaty?
TUONG LU KIM
What the fuck is a tweaty?
MR. TAKIYAMA
No no, a treaty.
TUONG LU KIM
A tweaty? [no response] Rook rook. All these racist people thinka that a Chinese and a Japanese are the same, right? So you and me, we put on a big assembry for all the kids are school, and then everyone understand curtural difference. You know, so they know fried rice isn't from Japan and teriyaki isn't from China.
MATT
Teriyaki isn't from China?

MR. TAKIYAMA

TUONG LU KIM

[Dr. Janus' lab, day.]
DR. JANUS
Butters, when you were playing in the yard yesterday, do you remember becoming someone named... Big Rig Butters?
BUTTERS
Sure.
DR. JANUS
What makes Big Rig Butters come out? Did somebody hurt him? Did he do something bad he can't forgive himself for?
BUTTERS
Uh, no, he's pretty much just a truck driver.
DR. JANUS
You don't know. But, maybe somebody else in there does. Do you think it would be possible for me to speak with... Inspector Butters?
BUTTERS
Sure.
DR. JANUS
I'm now speaking to the person known as Inspector Butters.
BUTTERS
Inspector Butters is on the case! Heheh, he this is fun.
DR. JANUS
Inspector Butters, what do you want?
BUTTERS
Uh, well, to solve mysteries.
DR. JANUS
And is there someone else living with you, someone named... Professor Chaos?
BUTTERS
Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil!
DR. JANUS
He's a bad man. He doesn't like Butters, does he? Does Professor Chaos want to murder Butters?
BUTTERS
What? Why would I do that?
DR. JANUS
Who am I speaking to now?
BUTTERS
Me, Butters.
DR. JANUS
Ah, Butters. You're back.
BUTTERS
Sir, I'm confused.
DR. JANUS
I know you are. This is going to sound scary, pal, but... you have people living inside your head. And some of them want to murder you.
BUTTERS
Really?
DR. JANUS
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little sick. But it's okay, because together we're going to get you well.
ALIAS 1
[a teenaged personality] Don't listen to Dr. Janus! He's a mean old man and a big silly grown up.
BUTTERS
Pardon me?
ALIAS 1
He's just a big old stick in the mud who doesn't like to play.
DR. JANUS
Don't mind him, Butters. Billy's a pretty messed up kid. He was molested by his uncles.
PSYCHO JANUS
Dr. Janus isn't going to be alive for long! I'm going to kill him!
DR. JANUS
Now, what are the things that make you happy, Butters? What's the matter, Butters? Are you still with us? Is one of your other personalities trying to take over?
BILLY
Let's play Battleship! All hands on the poop deck!
PSYCHO JANUS
Your soul will bleed for eternity!
ALIAS 2
You don't even know what sexy is, Mr. Harrison.
ALIAS 3
That Big Red freshness lasts right through it!
ALIAS 4
The horned toad says we should go to Mexico. [Butters doesn't know what to make of this doctor, and now he's afraid]
DR. JANUS
What are you feeling, Butters? Are you nervous about your condition?
BUTTERS
Yes!
[Butter's bedroom, later. He's looking at a video he took of himself on his computer]
BUTTERS
[a recording] This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping.
BUTTERS
Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie Paranormal.
BUTTERS
[a recording] Well goodnight for now. [leaves the desk and goes to bed] Goodnight, Butters.
BUTTERS
Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward. [fast-forwards three hours and then gasps. At normal speed, his bedroom door opens slowly. A second later, Dr. Janus enters] Dr. Janus? [nothing happens for three more hours, so Butters fast-forwards to 3:32 in the morning, when Dr. Janus unzips his pants, pulls out his dick and urinates all over Butters, puts his penis away, zips his pants up, and punches Butters HARD several times before running out of the bedroom. Six seconds later, Butters is fully awake]
BUTTERS
[a recording] Mom! Dad! I wet the bed again!
BUTTERS
Oh, sweet jumping Jesus!
[South Park Elementary Gymnasium, day. An Asian diversity poster is up on the projection screen. Mr. Mackey walks up next to it]
MR. MACKEY
Okay, kids, today we have a special assembly, m'kay. Today we're going to learn about "the diversity of Asian people." Please welcome Mr. Lu Kim and Mr. Junichi Takiyama. [Walks away. "Shake that." A techno song comes on, followed my Mr. Kim and Mr. Takiyama dancing into view]
TUONG LU KIM
Ni hao ma, South Park Erementary?!
MR. TAKIYAMA
Konnichiwa?!
TUONG LU KIM
How are we arr feering?! [the music stops and the stand back to back]
Hey, Mr. Takiyama, did you know that China and Japan are actually uh different countries?
MR. TAKIYAMA
Oh, rearry? [they separate] Hey, that ruhight. If you ook at map, you can see.
TUONG LU KIM
This whoooore thing is China, and Japan is this riiittle bitty country over here. And that's why the Japanese always try anda take over China!
MR. TAKIYAMA
What?!
TUONG LU KIM
The Japanese planned to kill people in Nanking! The only thing Japanese ruve more than killing people is killing themselves! Suicide rate in Japan sky-high!
MR. TAKIYAMA
Fuck you!
TUONG LU KIM
"Oh no, I'm a Japanese and I had a bad day! I think I'm gonna kill myself!"
[Dr. Janus' lab, day. Mr. Janus leaves it, but is surprised to find Butters waiting for him]
DR. JANUS
Oh, hello Butters. I wasn't expecting you till 5:30.
BUTTERS
[nervous] Uh, yeah, Dr. Janus, I wanted to give you something. You remember how you told me if I got myself on video it might help me with my problem?
DR. JANUS
Yes. did you catch something?
BUTTERS
Well yeah ah, I saw you pissing in my face.
DR. JANUS
[sees the DVD disc and snatches it away, then checks it over] Oh, so you're on to me, huh you little shit?!
BUTTERS
Huh?
DR. JANUS
What, Inspector butters figured out I set him up?!
BUTTERS
Well no, ah I just thought it was one of your other personalities trying to give me a-
DR. JANUS
Oh come on! You think multiple personality disorder is real?! I've been using that to scam this town for seven years! Now I gotta get out of here, thanks to you! But I'm getting one last heist before I go, and you're gonna help me!
[A jewelry shop, closed for the night. Dr. Janus destroys a window with a crow bar, then lifts Butters into the shop]
DR. JANUS
Get in there! Move it, asshole!
BUTTERS
This is illegal. We could get arrested. [Dr. Janus breaks into some display cases and swipes the jewels into a satchel that Butters is carrying] Oh Jesus!
DR. JANUS
They're all idiots! The vault! Get to the vault! Come on! Go! Movie it! [puts some welding goggles on Butters while getting a welding torch and firing it up] Get this on and get in that vault! That's where the real good are! [hands the lit torch to Butters] Torch that door, do you hear me?! I'll kill your parents! I'll kill your friends! I said get that fucking door open!
BUTTERS
I'm trying, sir! [this changes Dr. Janus' behavior]
DR. JANUS
Butters? Butters, what are you doing? What is that? A blowtorch? Put that down! You're having another episode!
BUTTERS
What?
DR. JANUS
Butters. Your name is Butters! Try and remember!
BUTTERS
But you said to uh, but I got to uh, and then, you told me tuh...
DR. JANUS
[sighs loudly] Oh boy, you've really done it this time. I know it's not your fault, but I'm sorry. I'm going to have to alert the authorities, pal.
[Delia's Jewelers, day. Dr. Janus addresses the crowd and the police]
DR. JANUS
We have to try and understand that he can't help what he's doing, officer. He probably has no memory of it at all.
SGT. YATES
Well, at least everything is accounted for. Thank God you came when you did, Dr. Janus.
STEVEN
Breaking into a store, Butters?! What are you?!
SGT. YATES
Well I suppose there's no need for jail, Mr. and Mrs. Stotch, so long as you ground your son.
STEVEN
Oh, we'll ground the shit out of him, detective. Thank you so much.
[City Sushi, day. Mr. Takiyama is preparing some sushi behind the counter when Mr. Kim enters]
TUONG LU KIM
Herro-o.
MR. TAKIYAMA
You get the fuck out of my place!
TUONG LU KIM
Okay, hold on, hold on, please! I'ma sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I admit it. I fucked you at the assembly. How about you and me together do an Asian Diversity festival?
MR. TAKIYAMA
Get the fuck out before I call police!
TUONG LU KIM
Please, I admitting it, okay?I fucked you at assembly. There's no way around it. It was verrry sneaky. Kind of like Pearl Harbor. Okay? That was a little sneaky too, huh? Pearl Harbor kind of sneaky; I think we can all be a rittle sneaky sometimes, hm? But that sneaky Chinese man? He's gone! Okay? Okay, if we can have Asian Diversity festival, then we no longer have to deal witha "recial stereotypes." Prease.
MR. TAKIYAMA
Against my better judgment, I will trust you one more time. But this time, you'd better not rub your hands together when you turn around to walk away.
TUONG LU KIM
Okay, see you tomorrow. [turns around and walks away, but stops long enough to rub his hands together] And on that Asian Diversity day you're gonna get a rittle surprise, you Japanese dog. [continues on his way]
[Butters' backyard. His Postman Butters uniform is on the ground, and he pours some gas on it. He then lights it and begins throwing in more of his costumes, which are in a cardboard box labeled "Butters' Play Clothes"]
BUTTERS
That does it, you hear me?! I am through with all of you! No more Postman Butters, No more Inspector Butters, no more Porn Star Butters, no more Professor Chaos, and no more- [a bicycle horn stops him, and he holds on to his Professor Chaos mask. He looks over and sees Dr. Janus on a child's tricycle glaring at him] Waaahh! [runs away. As he does, he tosses the Professor Chaos mask back into the cardboard box. Butters runs into the neighborhood park. Dr. Janus chases him down and tackles him there.]
DR. JANUS
Butters please! It's me, Billy! You've gotta help! [moments later they are seated on a park bench] Please, Butters, I've tried to tell old Dr. Janus that we're in danger, but Dr. Janus doesn't rrealize thaere's a problem! [stands up and walks around] The mean man that lives in our head is trying to take over for good!
BUTTERS
[sees a couple walking by] Um, excuse me?
DR. JANUS
[running around the bench to quickly distract Butters] No no nonono! Don't call out for help! [Dr. Janus opens his sports coat and points to a sidearm] He's got a gun.
BUTTERS
Wahh!
DR. JANUS
If you draw any attention he'll kill us!
BUTTERS
Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you.
DR. JANUS
No, you can't. But you know somebody who can. Inspector Butters.
BUTTERS
What??
DR. JANUS
You've got to become Inspector Butters again and help me find out what the mean man wants.
BUTTERS
No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters!
DR. JANUS
You don't understand! For some reason the mean man is getting stronger. You have to help me find out how to stop him! Please! [Butters sighs]
[South Park's Little Tokyo presents "Asian Diversity Day." A pagoda now stands between the two restaurants, and all three buildings are decorated with strings of lights, dragons, fish, and other motifs. Both restaurants are also offering samples of their menus. Here's a news report]
FIELD REPORTER

A WOMAN
Mr. Takiyama, a note for you. [Mr. Takiyama takes the note and reads it]
TUONG LU KIM
[voice-over] Konnichiwa, my fine Japanese friend. It's so great that Chinese and Japanese are finarry getting arong. We should take our picture together on top of the Tower of Peace. I'm up there waiting for you now. [Mr. Takiyama looks up, but doesn't see anyone up there] Prease, come meet me on top of the Tower of Peace. It would be rearry nice. [Tuong Lu Kim's image begins to rubs its hands together] Yesss, and when you get to the top of that tower you're gonna get a rittle surprise, you Japane- Oh, sorry. Anyway, see you on top of tower! [Mr. Takiyama leaves his sample display booth and goes into the tower]
[Meanwhile, in a mansion, Dr. Janus and Butters walk around with flashlights]
DR. JANUS
[as Billy] Dr. Janus sure has a big house, dudn't he? He's planning on hurting people; I just know it!
BUTTERS
It's okay, Billy, we're gonna get to the bottom of this.
DR. JANUS
This is kinda fun. You're Inspector Butters and I'm your faithful assistant, Dr. Watson!
BUTTERS
Well alright, Watson, well let's find out what we need to and get out of here!
DR. JANUS
Yeah! [Dr. Janus takes over] Butteers, what are you doing in my house?
BUTTERS
Hah?
DR. JANUS
Oh dear. It's okay, Butters. You just think you're Inspector Butters right now.
BUTTERS
Aw man.
DR. JANUS
[escorts Butters to the front door] Come on, let's get you home. [Billy takes over] Where are ya gon', Butters?
BUTTERS
Oh, come on!
DR. JANUS
You aren't leaving here, Inspector! None of you are!
BUTTERS
AAAAAAAAAAA! [runs away. Dr. Janus follows him upstairs] AAAAAAAAAAA!
DR. JANUS
Butters, come on! Try and come back to us! [Mean Guy takes over] You can't run forever! [pizza delivery man takes over] Excuse me, did someone order a pizza? [Dr. Janus takes over] Yes, that was me, but I'm a little busy at the moment. I'll be right back! [Mean Guy takes over as Butters enters an attic room or a penthouse floor] You'll never turn me in, Inspector Butters! You're dead!
BUTTERS
Waaaa! [runs to the end of a hall and knocks on the door found there. The door opens and he falls into a room. He looks up and gasps at what he sees: walls covered in newspaper headlines about City Sushi and its chef, and one word written in blood: KILL. Dr. Janus reaches the room and Butters looks over his shoulder. Dr. Janus squints his face and combs over his hair: it's...]
TUONG LU KIM
They wanna take over my Shitty Woookk?! Hory crap, what time is it? [checks his watch] Oh no, I'm rate! [turns around and runs downstairs, leaving Butters quite confused]
[The Tower of Peace, night. Tuong Lu Kim runs upstairs and reaches the top, and sighs]
MR. TAKIYAMA
What took you so long?!
TUONG LU KIM
[takes out a cigarette, clips the end off, and lights it] Yes, I'm afraid my Tower of Peace was a rittle bit of trickery, Mr. Japanese dog. I'm going to put an end to you, and everyone gonna think it's just because you did what Japanese people ruve doing most. "No, don't do it! Don't kill yourself, prease!" [jumps on Mr. Takiyama and grabs him by the throat]
MR. TAKIYAMA
Urgh. Fuck you! I'ma not trying to kill myself!
TUONG LU KIM
"No, don't do it, prease!" [some sirens are heard below] "So much to rive for!" [floodlights quickly find the two chefs, and they stand down]
SGT. YATES
[through his bullhorn] This is South Park Police!
TUONG LU KIM
Porice?! How?!
SGT. YATES
We know the truth, Dr. Janus!
MR. TAKIYAMA
Thisa Chinise rat trying to kill me!
SGT. YATES
He's not Chinese! He's white!
TUONG LU KIM
What the fuck you talkin' about?!
SGT. YATES
[enunciating] Your name is Dr. Janus!
TUONG LU KIM
You people crazy! [Billy takes over] Listen to them! It's true! [Mean Guy takes over] Truth hurts, doesn't it, Janus! [Dr. Janus takes over] Who are you people?! Why are you all here?!
MR. TAKIYAMA
How could I ret myself berieve white man was a Chinese?! I have brought shame upon myself! [gets on the balcony and jumps off] Nooooo, this is racial stereotaipuuu! [crashes into his own restaurant, destroying it and dying upon impact]
[Park County Police station, night. The police are talking to Butters and his parents]
STEVEN
So you're telling us that Dr. Janus has been the owner of City Wok all this time?
SGT. YATES
That's right. Of all his multiple personalities, the strongest was Lu Kim. And we never would have known... if it hadn'ta been for Inspector Butters. [the other officers present give Butters a round of applause.]
BUTTERS
Thanks. I'm just glad the whole thing is over and done. Maybe now poor old Dr. Janus can finally get the help he needs.
STEVEN
Yes Butters. Thanks to you, maybe Dr. Janus can get back to his real self.
SGT. YATES
[walks off] Yes, I'm sure he could. But, then again, [stops, then turns around] does the world really need another therapist?
STEVEN
Whattaya mean?
SGT. YATES
Well I mean, would it really be so bad for us to just let him go on thinking he's Lu Kim forever? Now that City Sushi is gone, City Wok is the only Chinese restaurant left in town.
DESK OFFICER
Oh yeah.
BLACK OFFICER
Yeah. Let's just let him keep believing he's a Chinese man.
SGT. YATES
Done!
OTHER OFFICERS
Good! Alright! Alright! Yeah!
BLOND OFFICER
Detective, he's asking for a blanket. Is that alright?
SGT. YATES
Go ahead. We're gonna process him and get him back to the restaurant. [the officer who conveyed the request carries a blanket back to Tuong Lu Kim's cell. He enters...]
TUONG LU KIM
Thank you. [...and leaves. The guard by the door locks it] "Oooooo, I hate Japanese people! They try and shut down my Shitty Wok, but they never wiiiiill. They're probably all ratching me, the Japanese. Ret them! I'm not even gonan swat that fryyy. They'll see. And they'll say 'Wow, that Shitty Wok owner. Why, he wouldn't even harm a fryyyyy.'" [City Wok is shown one more time]

synopsis:Just after Stan’s 10th birthday, his worldview starts to change and so do his friendships.

script:You're Getting Old

[Whistlin' Willy's, day. The boys are singing "Happy Birthday" to Stan. After that, Stan blows out the two Terrance and Phillip candles adorning the cake. Sharon takes a picture]
BOYS
Yay! [Liane sits next to Cartman with a camera of her own]
CARTMAN
Alright now, open presents! Open presents!
BUTTERS
Yeah! Open mine first Stan! It's the red one! [Stan reaches over and opens it]
CARTMAN
Where's mine? Where's mine where's mine where's mine?
LIANE
[reaches under the table and gives Cartman a gift] Here you go, sweetie.
CARTMAN
Yaaaay!
KYLE
Wait wait it-it's Stan's birthday.
LIANE
Yes. Every time somebody gets a birthday present Eric gets one too. [in a softer voice] Otherwise, he gets a little upset.
CARTMAN
[eagerly opening his own gift] What'd I get what'd I get what'd I get?
KYLE
Oh God...
STAN
[opening his gift] Oh cool, Legos. Thanks, Butters.
BUTTERS
I know how you like Legos. Happy birthday!
CARTMAN
Oh cool! I got a racing game for Xbox! [Speed Zone for XBOX 360] D'you guys see that? Coool, huh?
KYLE
Here, this one's from me, Stan.
STAN
Oh thanks, dude.
CARTMAN
Stan's getting another present, Mom.
LIANE
Here you are, muffin. [throws up another gift]
CARTMAN
Yaaaay! [rips the wrapper off] Oh cool, look. A Ben 10 Wrist Rocket! This is exactly what I wanted for Stan's birthday! What'd you get Stan?
STAN
Oh cool, is this the new Gersploosh album?
KYLE
Yeah dude!
SHARON
[walks up behind Stan] Uh, hold it. Is that a Tween Wave band?
KYLE
Yeah they're the best!
SHARON
Sorry, Stan. you know you're not allowed to listen to this stuff.
STAN
Mom, I'm 10 years old now.
SHARON
I've told you what I think of this music, Stanley. You have plenty of other gifts to enjoy.
CARTMAN
Looks like somebody's on the rag, huh Mom?
[The Marsh house, day. Sharon is in the kitchen washing dishes. Randy peeks in from the dining room, then walks into the kitchen]
RANDY
Sharon? Stan told me you took away his music CD at his birthday party.
SHARON
Oh for crying out loud, I gave him a great party and that's all he cares about.
RANDY
Well, do you really think we should be telling our son what music he can and can't listen to?
SHARON
Yes I do, if it's that stupid Tween Wave garbage!
RANDY
Tween Wave?
SHARON
You haven't heard it? It's terrible! It's hardly even music; it just sounds like crap!
RANDY
Sharon, come on. Don't you remember being younger and having our parents say the music we liked sounded like crap?
SHARON
This is different!
RANDY
[waits a few seconds] ...So. Here we are. Now we're the old people who think the younger generation's music sounds like shit.
SHARON
[stops washing and turns around] It's... not because I'm older. I'm telling you, our music is better.
RANDY
[mimicking an elderly man] "Back in my day our music was better! Not this garbage the young 'un listen to. Warber warber warber."
SHARON
Fine, Randy! [hands him the CD] You go listen to it and tell me you don't think it sounds like crap! [goes back to washing dishes]
RANDY
I'd love to. I'm not an old fuddy-duddy, Sharon. I'm still cool. [walks out and towards his den.]
[The den. Randy pops the CD into the CD drive on his computer, puts on his headphones, and listens. The song he hears starts with a good beat, and he bobs up and down ever so slightly to it, but then explosive diarrhea is heard, and Randy is startled. He makes sure it's not him farting or anything. Sharon appears at the doorway with hands on hips]
SHARON
Well, it sounds like crap, right?!
RANDY
Uh... NO I mean... [looks at Sharon] I like it.
SHARON
Oh come on! That music sounds like shit!
RANDY
No, it's just... young and hip so you don't get it, Sharon.
SHARON
Admit it, Randy! You think it sounds like crap too!
RANDY
It doesn't sound like crap at all! I think it's awesome! [turns towards the computer. Sharon walks away exasperated. Randy clicks his fingers, but the farts noises keep coming and Randy keeps wincing]
[CNN Headline News]
ANCHORMAN
It's called Tween Wave, and if you're a parent your kids are probably listening to it. A new music genre for the era from 2009 through 2012. or "The Tweens." Every generation has their music, but many parents say Tween Wave sounds like crap.
MAN 1
It's just vulgar and stupid, you know? Music used to be good.
WOMAN 1
This sounds like poo.
MAN 2
[an elderly man] I certainly don't understand kids' music today. Sounds like diarrhea to me.
ANCHORMAN
Kids however say they don't hear crap at all.
KID 1
Parents are dumb.
KID 2
They don't get it.
KID 1
They don't get it. Parents are stupid.
KID 3
Tween Wave is swick.
KID 4
Tweem Wave is super swick and parents don't get it, 'cause their ears are old.
KID 5
Parents are dumb.
[The Marsh house, day. The boys' parents are gathered in the living room except for Randy]
SHARON
We're sorry boys, but we have all decided that as of now, none of you are allowed to listen to Tween Wave music.
RANDY
[sitting with the boys] Ugh, that's so unfair!
KYLE
But that's our music! We like it!
RANDY
Yeah it's good!
SHEILA
What's good about a bunch of crap sounds to a drumbeat?
STAN
We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us!
RANDY
Yeah it, it doesn't sound like that to us.
GERALD
I wanna educate you kids with some real music. [pops in a CD of The Police's "Synchronicity"] This is The Police. Now you compare this to Tween pop and tell us which one you think is real music. [presses Play and "Every Breath You Take" starts up, but instead of lyrics you hear poop sounds]
THE BOYS
Yuck!
RANDY
What?
STAN
That sounds like shit!
GERALD
Whattaya mean it sounds like shit? This doesn't sound like shit.
KYLE
Gross!
CARTMAN
Turn it off dude!
[The Marsh house, night, Stan's room. Stan is in bed and Sharon is about to leave the room]
SHARON
Stanley I want you to understand that even though I won't let you listen to certain kinds of music, I still love you.
STAN
I know, Mom. I love you too.
SHARON
Soon you'll be old enough to make your own choices, but for now, I just don't want you listening to that stuff.
STAN
It's okay, Mom. I understand.
SHARON
That's very mature of you, Stanley. Goodnight, sweetie. [Stan turns away and closes his eyes.]
STAN
'Night. [Sharon turns off the lights and closes the door. A few seconds later, Stan opens his eyes and looks at the door to make sure his mom isn't looking at him. Then he reaches under the mattress and pulls out his iPod] Haha. [listens to some music. Soon some shitty sounds creep in] Ugh. [tries some other tracks, but each one has poop noises in it. He sits up] What the hell? [tries more tracks, but all he hears now is shit]
[The bus stop, day. Kenny, Cartman, and Kyle are listening to songs on their iPods]
KYLE
[to Cartman] Oh dude! Dude, this is the part I was talking about. Check out the bassline on this! [has Cartman listen to his song]
CARTMAN
Oh yeah, that one's cool. [gets into the rhythm] Yeah, this part's killer. [looks like he's exercising]
KYLE
[seeing Stan approach] Hey Stan. [hands Cartman his iPod]
STAN
Hey dudes.
KYLE
Dude, have you really listened to the sixth track? I think it's my new favorite.
STAN
Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second?
KYLE
Sure. [they walk off to a small clearing] What's up?
STAN
Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle.
KYLE
Oh. Really? Um well that's okay.
STAN
No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me.
KYLE
Why? What's it sound like?
STAN
It... kind of sounds like shit.
KYLE
What? You mean like you don't like the singing, or the lyrics, or what?
STAN
No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close. [has Kyle listen to a track] You don't hear shit?
KYLE
No.
STAN
That doesn't sound like shit to you?
KYLE
NO. Dude, maybe you should see a doctor.
[A doctor's office, day. Stan took Kyle's advice. A doctor is checking Stan's ears]
STAN
And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me.
DOCTOR CAROLL
Uh huh, and what about food? Are some of the things you thought tasted good tasting like shit to you now, too?
STAN
Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit.
DOCTOR CAROLL
[reads his medical file] This says you had a birthday recently?
STAN
I just turned 10.
DOCTOR CAROLL
Well, that makes sense. You see Stan, as you get older, your eardrums, taste buds, all that stuff develops and changes.
STAN
So this is normal?
DOCTOR CAROLL
It's very normal. Let's just do a quick ear exam. I'm gonna play some Tween Wave music and you tell me what you hear. [plays some music, with lots of fart sounds] What's that sound like to you?
STAN
Sounds like shit.
DOCTOR CAROLL
Aha. Now I'm going to play you some good ole Bob Dylan. [plays a Dylan track. Dylan gets through three syllables before fart sounds replace him.]
STAN
Uh that sounds like shit too.
DOCTOR CAROLL
Wait, this sounds like shit to you?
STAN
Yeah dude, it's just shit.
DOCTOR CAROLL
Well that's very strange. [turns off the player] Hm, I'm gonna try somethin' else. [takes two pictures up to Stan] Look at these two pictures. One of them is an ad for Kevin James' new movie The Zookeeper, and the other is a turd in a microwave. Which one is the ad for The Zookeeper?
STAN
They both look the same. [true enough, except for the turds]
DOCTOR CAROLL
You don't see any difference in the pictures?
STAN
No.
DOCTOR CAROLL
[holds up the picture in his right hand] That is an ad for The Zookeeper and [holds up the picture in his left hand] that is a turd about to be reheated.
STAN
They both look like turds about to be reheated to me.
DOCTOR CAROLL
Oh dear. I think I know what this is. You see Stan, as you get older, things that you used to like start looking and sounding like shit. And things that seemed shitty as a child don't seem as shitty. With you, somehow, the wires have gotten crossed and everything looks and sounds like shit to you. It's a condition called "being a cynical asshole."
STAN
Oh no.
DOCTOR CAROLL
Yes. And there's no known cure, I'm afraid. Everything just seems shitty, and everyone starts to seem shitty, and everything they say just starts to [sounds shitty now, and Stan can't believe his ears. Soon, shit comes out of the doctor's mouth and Stan is more horrified]
[Randy's den, night. Randy has transformed it into a mancave, with disco ball and clothes strewn everywhere. Randy is reading Rolling Stone and listening to Tween Wave music through his headphones]
SHARON
[walking by] Randy, do you mind cleaning up the garage like I asked you?
RANDY
Get out of my room! I'm listening to my music! Gau!
SHARON
Stop pretending to like the kids' music, Randy! It's pathetic! You know damn well it sounds like crap to you too!
RANDY
No it doesn't sound like crap to me! [one pooping sound and the headphones are off] Ugh. [gets up and walks around angrily]
SHARON
Randy, don't you see what this is? You had dreams of being a rock star when you were younger, now you can't admit the next generation's music sounds shitty, it's called "getting older", Randy. It's okay.
RANDY
That's not true! I think Tween Wave music is complex and awesome and it speaks to my youthful rebellious spirit, Sharon!
SHARON
It's crap, Randy! It's so simple and stupid that anybody could play it!
RANDY
Anybody could play it. Do you really think so?
[The bowling alley, night. "Steamy Ray Vaughn", who turns out to be Randy, is performing. Randy is tuning up when he turns to face his audience]
RANDY
Hey everybody. Wanna thank you all for coming tonight. My name's Steamy Ray Vaughn and here's a little bit of Rattlesnake. [presses the play button] A-1 2 3 4! I've got a fever but it's under control! [fart noises, courtesy of his own butt] I said I've got a fever need to take it kind of slow [more fart noises. A janitor listens in] I've got a fever but it's out of control. Ga ga, ga ga, la ga ga ga. [more fart noises.]
BAR PATRON
You suck!
RANDY
No, you just don't understand Tween Wave 'cause you're old! [more fart noises.]
[A ranch, day. Two elderly men stand at a fence. One of them is the janitor]
JANITOR/FARMER 1
Did you know we're livin' in the Tween time?
FARMER 2
Nah, I'd a heard that.
JANITOR/FARMER 1
Guess it's the period between 2009 and 2013. They call it the Tweens. So they got this feller down at the bowling alley? He gets up on the stage an' shits his britches.
FARMER FRIEND 2
What fer?
JANITOR/FARMER 1
I don't know. But he gets up there and strums a gueetar and then starts loadin' his britches up like it's goin' out of style. [sniffs] It's like some kind of britches holocaust. Feller calls himself Steamy Ray Vaughn.
FARMER 2
You mean that guy that plays the blues and died in an airplane crash?
JANITOR/FARMER 1
Nnooh. That's Stevie Ray Vaughn. Steamy Ray Vaughn just shits his britches.
[Kyle's house, night. Kyle is playing a video game as Cartman and Kenny look on]
CARTMAN
Ohooh dude, sweet! Tackle him!
KENNY
(Get him!)
KYLE
Alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth?
CARTMAN
He's lying, dude. Hit X
KENNY
(No, he's telling the truth) [Stan walks in]
STAN
Hey guys.
KYLE
Hey, Stan. What did the doctor say?
STAN
He said I have cynicism?
CARTMAN
What's that?
STAN
Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit.
KYLE
Oh. Well, come on, we're playing L.A. Noire.
STAN
Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button?
CARTMAN
Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle.
KYLE
Yeah, we got him!
STAN
How can people say this game is cool? It doesn't even matter what choices you make.
KENNY
(Hit the X button, Kyle!)
KYLE
We're gonna level up to detective!
STAN
That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.
KYLE
Alright, ahhh, why don't we do something else?
[So the boys are now in a diner eating sundaes]
STAN
[looking at his chocolate sundae] Aw, dude, this looks like shit.
KYLE
You don't wanna eat it?
STAN
It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit.
CARTMAN
Look like ice cream to me.
KYLE
Erm, okay, I know. How about we go to the mall?
STAN
Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit.
KYLE
Ugh, okay Stan, what do you wanna do?
STAN
What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever.
[The bowling alley, night. Steamy Ray Vaughn is back in performing. The janitor and his farmer friend are present]
RANDY
City bog. Too much, too much city bop. Too much too much too much [puts the mic to his ass and farts into it]
FARMER FRIEND 2
Lord, I ain't never seen britches take a whoopin' like that.
JANITOR/FARMER 1
I told you. Them britches don't stand a chance.
RANDY
City bop! City yeah! [more fart sounds, and the song ends] Thank you! Thank you so much! I'd like to uh, bring up a special guest now. The other night I was chatting in a Tween Wave chatroom, because I do love Tween Wave so much, and I uh started chattin' with this nice lady who also really like her kids' Tween Wave music and... turns out she's a real talented artist as well. Please welcome Miss Steamy Nicks.
STEAMY NICKS
[sounding a lot like a goat] Thank you, thank you so much. [Randy presses play and a song begins]
FARMER FRIEND 2
Wait now, who's that lady?
JANITOR/FARMER 1
That there's Steamy Nicks.
FARMER FRIEND 2
You mean that gal who played for Fleetwood Mac and wrote that song "Landslide"?
JANITOR/FARMER 1
Nnooh, that's Stevie Nicks. Steamy Nicks just shits her britches. [sure enough, she does this, and Randy joins her a second later]
RANDY
Yoyoyo! [more fart sounds]
SHARON
[enters the bowling alley and heads straight for Randy] Who the hell is that woman, Randy?! What the hell do you think you're doing?!
JANITOR/FARMER 1
I agree. Why don't you leave them poor britches alone?
FARMER FRIEND 2
Them britches have had enough!
[Ronny's Diner, day. Stan is in a booth, all alone. A waitress comes up]
WAITRESS
All alone today?
STAN
Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu.
WAITRESS
Well, what can I get you?
STAN
Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit?
WAITRESS
A little young to be so pessimistic, aren't ya kid?
STAN
Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit. [just outside, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny walk by, not noticing Stan in the diner. Stan, on the other hand, notices them walk by. He quickly leaves the booth and catches up with them outside, where they're happily talking about something.]
KYLE
[laughing] I know! That's so hilarious!
STAN
I thought you guys were sick! [the other boys don't know what to say]
CARTMAN
...Uh we'll let you catch up to us, Kyle. Come on, Kenny. [Cartman and Kenny turn and walk away. Stan approaches Kyle]
STAN
Dude, you totally lied to me!
KYLE
No, ah I didn't lie to you. Ah I was um... uh I felt better and then the guys called and said that they felt better and uh-
STAN
Where were you guys going?!
KYLE
Alright dude, we were going to the movies.
STAN
Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies.
KYLE
Look, Stam, we-we just wanted to be able to go to the movies and enjoy ourselves, you know? I'm sorry but... you're a bummer to be around. Everything is "that looks like shit" and, and "this is shitty!"
STAN
You guys... don't wanna be around me?
KYLE
Look dude, it's just one movie. We wanna have a good time.
STAN
Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you.
KYLE
[thinks about it, then sighs] Okay. But you've gotta promise to not complain.
STAN
I won't say a word.
[The Bijou theater, day. X-Men: First Class is playing. Inside, the theater is barely a fourth full. The boys sit in the third row.]
STAN
Oh shit.
[The Bijou theater, later on]
STAN
Jesus, how long before they start this Goddamned thing?! [apparently trailers are still playing]
CARTMAN
Oh cool, the movie trailers!
[First trailer]
ANNOUNCER
Adam Sandler is Jack. Adam Sandler is Jill. [Jack and Jill are at a well, and Jill poops on Jack... and they both look like turds]
STAN
Awww God! [squeezes his eyes shut and puts his hand over them]
KYLE
Dude, you said you wouldn't say everything looked like shit!
STAN
Sorry if I see things for what they are! Ok- okay, okay, I'm sorry.
[Second trailer]
ANNOUNCER
[a toilet bowl spews out shit] This November, Adam Sandler shits in your eyes, ears, and mouth. [Some eyes, ear, and mouth are shown separately, and poop lands on each of them] It's Adam Sandler in Pbbbbbt, rated Arg for pirates. Fuck you!
CARTMAN
That looks pretty good.
STAN
How can you say that looks good?!
KYLE
Shhh, you're doing it again!
[Third trailer]
ANNOUNCER
Jim Carrey has a bunch of turds in his apartment. [dancing turds that create turd sounds, at that]
STAN
[shields his eyes from the shit] Ugh.
CARTMAN
Stan, knock it off!
STAN
But it's just crap.
KYLE
No, they're penguins! Stop it!
ANNOUNCER
[shots of Carrey carrying two turds, slipping on another turd, then taking a crap while two turds look on] It's Jim Carrey in Whatever, You'll Pay To Go See It. Fuck you! July 12.
[Fourth trailer]
ANNOUNCER
The President of the United States... is a duck?? [the duck pops up and opens its beak, which issues forth lots of shit] A duck is President and the whole country is goin' to the dogs. [two dogs are shown. One of them has his ass to the camera, and it begins to poop] Or whatever, the President is a dog. [the dog and duck now stand before a U.S. flag] Who cares? Coming June something. [a bunch of poop hits the scene, landing on the dog and duck and spelling out "JUNE"]
STAN
Oh come on, people!
KYLE
That's it, Stan! I'm not sitting through a whole movie with you! [leaves his seat and walks out. Kenny and Cartman follow suit]
STAN
Oh dude dude wait, I'm sorry.
CARTMAN
No, Kyle's right. You suck, dude.
STAN
Me?! Did you see that shit?!
[The Bijou, outside. Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman turn to leave the theater when Stan catches up to them.]
STAN
Hang on guys!
CARTMAN
Dude, we don't wanna hang out with you anymore! Get it through your head! [he and Kenny leave. Kyle stays behind]
STAN
Kyle?
KYLE
[turns around] Dude, you've... you've changed.
STAN
I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?
KYLE
No. And I don't want to. Look Stan, maybe we should fo- [poop starts coming out of his mouth and spewing all over the place. He then turns into a huge turd - this is how Stan sees him. The rest of us see him normally. Stan turns and walks away. Kyle turns and walks away in the opposite direction]
[The Marsh house, night. Randy and Sharon can be seen arguing through the living room windows]
RANDY
You don't get it, Sharon! You never have! And that's supposed to be my fault?!
SHARON
Yes, it IS your fault, Randy, because you're a child!
RANDY
I'm sick of everything I do being so wrong, Sharon!
SHARON
I'm sick of having to...for this! You're 42 years old, Randy!
RANDY
I'm not dead yet Sharon, but you might be!
SHARON
Oh is that what you think?! That I'm dead?!
[across the street, behind some bushes, the two elderly men are there observing the argument]
FARMER FRIEND 2
What do you suppose is goin' on in there?
JANITOR/FARMER 1
Sound like Steamy Ray Vaughn is goin' at it with his wife over Steamy Nicks.
FARMER FRIEND 2
You... sure you wanna do this?
JANITOR/FARMER 1
We got to now, if their fightin' is our best chance tuh save them britches.
[back in the house]
SHARON
You do this all the time! First you're obsessed with baseball fights! Then you need to play Warcraft! Then you gotta be a celebrity chef! [the two men slide a side window up ever so quietly, go in, and sneak upstairs]
RANDY
Why can't you ever just support me?!
SHARON
Support what?! Another stupid dream of yours?!
RANDY
Face it Sharon, our son turned 10 and you feel old!
SHARON
WHAT does our son turning 10 have to do with you making the same mistakes again and again?!
RANDY
Because I'm unhappy, okay?! I've been unhappy for a long time! [Sharon reflects on this for a moment and her voice goes soft]
SHARON
I'm unhappy too. We both are, obviously. How much longer can we keep doing this? It's like, the same shit just happens over and over and, then in a week it just all resets until- it happens again. Every week it's kind of the same story in a different way but it, it just keeps getting more and more ridiculous.
JANITOR/FARMER 1
[the two men sneak out the way they came in] Come on britches, we're settin' you free.
RANDY
I don't know if I've changed or you have. I just feel like I might not have a whole lot of time left and... I want to enjoy it.
SHARON
I want to enjoy it too, but... I can't fake it anymore. You just seem kind of shitty to me.
RANDY
You kind of seem shitty to me too.
SHARON
People get older, Randy. People grow apart.
[Stevie Nicks' "Landslide" begins to play. Stan is seen at Stark's Pond looking at it from a bench. Kyle walks up to Stan, but keeps some distance from him, then turns around and walks away. Stan looks at a flower... which has a huge turd growing from it. A bee lands on it. At the house, Shelly and Sharon pack away everything in the kitchen. Later, Randy explains things to Stan as Stan's dresser is being moved. Later, a realtor sets a "FOR SALE" sign in place - four bedrooms, two bathrooms, kitchen, back yard. She finishes and walks away. Randy is driving a U-Haul truck and watches the house fade in the distance through the driver's rear-view mirror. Sharon and her kids move into a new place. Sharon works on her room and gives Stan the box for his room. Stan later sits in a swing in the new yard. A small sandlot is nearby. Instead of a wooden fence, the new place has a wrought-iron fence. Stan looks up at the sun, which is a glowing massive turd. Stan is then seen at the cafeteria sitting at a table with a bunch of turds that are supposed to be his classmates. All the food looks like shit too. At night the police arrest the Britches Bandits, the two men who stole Randy's underwear, and take the underwear in for evidence. Cartman and Kyle play a game on Kyle's sofa. They look at each other and seem to reach a mutual understanding, since they smile at each other. Stan walks all alone in South Park and passes a duck in a tux. He stops and looks at the duck, who keeps walking. It looks at him and quacks out shit, which lands on him. The last scene is Stan lying in his new bed, in his new bedroom, looking up at the ceiling.]
End of You're Getting Old


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Cartman finds a unique way to cope with Asperger's Syndrome.

script:Ass Burgers

[Daytime at the apartment building Sharon and her kids moved into the last episode. Stan's clock read 6:59 AM. Inside his window you can see Whistlin' Willy's, and beyond that, the South Park Library. Stan had moved to Downtown South Park. The clock strikes 2 and the radio comes on, waking him up. A morning variety radio show comes on]
BIG HARRY
Oh that's funny, that's real funny. Big Harry and Mike in the Morning talkin' about the new hit movie [poop sounds], a great comedy, starring [poop sounds] and [poop sounds].
MIKE
I saw the movie last night, Big Harry, and it made me laugh so hard! This movie's about a [poop sounds] heh, he was suddenly all like [poop sounds] Aw, man it's great!
BIG HARRY
Big Harry and Mike in the Morning. We'll talk more about it but let's get to some music. The new Tween Wave band [poop sounds] with their song [poop sounds. The song begins to play. Stan sits up and turns the radio off]
[Stan sits still for a few seconds, then still half-awake he goes into the shower and just stands there without taking off his hat. Later, he's at table as Sharon prepares breakfast for him. Shelly is sitting right in front of the TV eating cereal]
ANNOUNCER
Coming this fall to Fox/CBS/FX. Jurassic Park and Lost in the same TV show! [poop sounds] Dinosaurs! [poop sounds] Lost Humans! [poop sounds] Future, yes! [poop sounds]
[Sharon serves Stan his breakfast, which looks to Stan like a long tube of poop topped with a butter square. Stan just look at it, still half-asleep]
SHARON
[not noticing Stan's condition] Stanley, eat your waffles. [Stan gets his knife and fork and cuts into the waffles, then starts eating.]
[The sidewalk, morning. Stan has finished breakfast and is headed for the school bus stop with his head down. Be begins to hear the other boys as he draws near]
KYLE
Oh shut up Cartman! You don't even know what you're talking about!
CARTMAN
Oh yeah! I saw it on the news, Kyle! The school is gonna make us all get shots again! [at this point Stan stops and stands alongside the other boys, but he's still looking at the ground] But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vaginas!
KENNY
(Are you serious?!)
CARTMAN
Yep!
KYLE
That's only a vaccination for girls, stupid!
CARTMAN
Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded?
KYLE
[sighs gruffly] Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's!
CARTMAN
Wait what?
KYLE
That's what they're talking about on the news!
CARTMAN
Wait, there's a disease called Assburgers?
KYLE
Yes!
CARTMAN
You are so lying! There's no disease called fuckin' Assburgers!
KYLE
You wanna bet? [begins to move off] Let's go ask my Dad right now!
CARTMAN
Okay, you're on, Jew! [he and Kenny follow Kyle away. Several seconds later, the bus shows up and Stan gets on. He takes an empty seat and no one sits next to him. He leans against the window, looking very sad]
[South Park Elementary, Fourth Grade. Stan is in class, looking sad, and the seats that would hold Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman are empty.]
MR. GARRISON
And so children, at noon today, all the girls will go to the gymnasium for their vaccinations, and boys will head on out to recess. [on the blackboard he had written "HPV Vaccination Day"]
BUTTERS
Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?
MR. GARRISON
No. Butters, that's not how it works.
OFFICER BARBRADY
[offscreen] Mr. Garrison, [now onscreen] these three boys were caught playing hooky.
CARTMAN
Did you guys know there's actually a disease called Assburgers? [Stan is hearing everything as if from a distance]
MR. GARRISON
Sit down boys, we'll talk about this later. Right now we're talking about vaginal warts.
WENDY
This isn't fair! How can the school make us get vaccinated?
BUTTERS
You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?
CARTMAN
That's right, it's a butt fungus.
BUTTERS
Well I don't want burgers comin' out of my butt!
STAN
[in an angry outburst] God, shut up! Everyone just shut the fuck up! [looks around glaring at everyone, who look back at him, stunned]
[Mr. Mackey's office, moments later]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, Stan, you, you've gotta try and pull yourself out of this, m'kay? I know that... your parents recently got divorced. M'kay, that's gotta be hard. I know that's... that's bad. But when you walk around all mopey, m'kay, and sayin' everything is... just shitty, well, that's called bein' a Debbie Downer, Stan. And nobody likes a Debbie Downer, m'kay. ...I mean you've gotta, you've gotta snap out of it, Debbie. Come on, Debbie, you're even bummin' me out now, m'kay? Your attitude just- just sucks.
STAN
[after a few seconds' silence] I just want everything to go back to the way it was.
MR. MACKEY
Okay, well, that's not gonna happen, Debbie. Okay, you know, uh life, life has to change, m'kay?
STAN
How?... When all the things that made you laugh, just make you sick. How do you go on when nothing makes you happy? [tears start to well up around his eyes]
MR. MACKEY
Huh... e-excuse me a minute, Stan. m'kay? [stands up, goes to his desk, picks up his phone and starts dialing] Uh, hi, Ms. Bronski? Did we vaccinate Stan for the flu last year? We did? Uh oh... I think he's got Asperger's.
[Breaking News]
ANNOUNCER
This is breaking news, from CNN! Or Fox or, whatever. [The logos for Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC go by] Fuck you.
ANCHOR
The first documented case of a child developing Asperger syndrome from school vaccinations [a shot of a syringe and the words "ASPERGER'S SYNDROME" appear] has put the government in a tight spot. [a shot of Stan] At a press conference today the media heard from the young boy's father, Steamy Ray Vaughn.
RANDY
It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent, and then the "government" comes along and with one shot turns your child into a "mentally incapacitated" freak! I mean look at him. He's disinterested, depressed, self-loathing. It's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced!
ANCHOR
In response to the embarrassment, the President of the United States has passed "Stan's Bill," putting an end to school-mandated vaccinations.
[At the White House]
AIDE 1
Mr. President, the bill is ready. [the duck, wearing a tailor-made suit, quacks, with shit splattering out of its mouth]
AIDE 2
Just sign right here, Mr. President. [the duck quacks again, splattering shit all over the document]
AIDE 1
Aaand if you could just sign this one as well, Mr. President. [the duck quacks again, splattering shit all over the second document. The parties involved gather for a quick photo opportunity]
ANCHOR
It is yet unknown if any other children have contracted from the vaccinations, but if so, multimillion-dollar lawsuits are probably not far behind.
[Cartman's house, morning. He's in the kitchen cooking up a bunch of burgers. He's got two patties in a large pan, and he begins to sing.]
CARTMAN
Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-
[South Park Elementary. Cartman approaches the nurse's office, having gotten excused from class. He stops, clears his throat, and enters. He starts to moan as he approaches the examination bed. He hops on and sits down]
NURSE BRONSKI
Eric, what is it this time?
CARTMAN
[coughing somewhat] Fever... Light... lightheadedness... I don't know what's wrong with me.
NURSE BRONSKI
[puts down her notepad and starts examining him] You don't feel warm.
CARTMAN
Oh, that's a relief. I thought maybe I had a fever but I- oh OH. Oh my buns! There's a sharp pain in my buns!
NURSE BRONSKI
Can you lay on your stomach?
CARTMAN
I-I'll try. I'll try. [lays on his stomach. The nurse sees something under his pants and pulls them back.]
NURSE BRONSKI
What the? [pulls back the briefs and pulls out a wrapped item, then unwraps it] What is this? A hamburger? [indeed, that's what she's holding]
CARTMAN
A what??
NURSE BRONSKI
[pulls out another hamburger] Why are there hamburgers in your underwear?
CARTMAN
Are you serious? How can there be- [sighs] Oh my God! You're saying I have assburgers??
NURSE BRONSKI
[pulls out a third hamburger] This doesn't make sense. Are you trying to sneak food into the school or something?
CARTMAN
What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers!
NURSE BRONSKI
Very funny!
CARTMAN
Well I'm glad you think Assburgers is funny! Just note my condition on your records there!
NURSE BRONSKI
Get out of my office!
[The school hallway. Kyle is at his locker as Wendy approaches.]
WENDY
Hey Kyle? [immediately he knows what she's going to ask] Have you heard anything at all from Stan?
KYLE
I've tried, Wendy. I've called him, I've been to his house. But since his diagnosis, all he's done is gotten worse.
WENDY
I don't know what to do. It's like he's... completely turned off.
BOY 1
Those two should just screw and get it over with!
BOY 2
Yeaahh...
KYLE
I can't keep doing it, Wendy. I know he has an illness, but goddamn, it uh, it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything.
WENDY
Look, maybe what we should do is all go over to his house together, an-and that way we could-
KYLE
[puts his notebook away and closes his locker door] NO. I can't, Wendy. [walking away] All his negativity is starting to make me depressed. I have to let him go. [stops] And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally [makes a fist with his right hand and pounds it into his left palm] positive attitude.
CARTMAN
[rounds a corner and walks past Wendy and Kyle] Godamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch!
KYLE
What's the matter dude?
CARTMAN
[stops and backs up] I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That's what's the matter!
KYLE
You made hamburgers? Well that's awesome! I'd love one. [reaches for a burger and bites into it. That burger might have been in Cartman's underwear] Mmm. Hm, wow [swallows] This is really good, Cartman.
CARTMAN
Really?
KYLE
Yeah. [a girl walks by] Hey Riley! Try this hamburger. [hands her a burger] Cartman made them himself.
RILEY
[unwraps and eats it] Wow. What is that?
KYLE
Seriously, Cartman. You could make money with these!
CARTMAN
Gee, thanks Kyle!
[Asperger's Research Center, day. A researcher takes Sharon and Stan on a tour of the facility]
RESEARCHER
The truth is we still know very little about Asperger syndrome, Mrs. Marsh. All our patients here show the same social awkwardness that your son exhibits. [they stop next to a seated man who has wrapped his legs behind his neck and is making bubbles with bubble solution and farts] Good morning Mr. Mathers.
MR. MATHERS
Goodbye, doctor [farts into the blower]
RESEARCHER
[signs and moves on] It's as if they all have an inability to distinguish from what is socially acceptable and what is not. [they stop by a man urinating on a wall. Sharon and Stan notice what he's doing] We've got a new patient, Martin. I want you to meet Stan.
MARTIN
[turns around, still urinating, and Stan gets peed on] Nice to meet you.
RESEARCHER
[moves on. Martin faces the wall again] Here at the treatment center, our focus is on awareness. [Stan shakes his head to get the piss off] Asperger's is serious, but unfortunately because of its name people think it's a disease to be made fun of. [the researcher opens a door to Room 209, a room of adults who are mentally deficient in one way or another. The adults are doing odd things and making odd sounds. He enters as Sharon and Stan look on a bit worried.] Alright everyone, let's have a seat. [Martin comes in, still urinating, and takes a seat. Stan finds a spot on a sofa and sits there.] Oh uh, we'll be done at about 5 pm, Mrs. Marsh. I'll call if it's any earlier.
SHARON
Oh, right, uh. Good bye, Stan. I-I love you. [leaves and closes the door. Everyone sits in silence for a few minutes, then]
RESEARCHER
Alright, are we clear?
NEO
We're clear! [everyone begins to move normally and arm themselves. They turn into Matrix characters]
MORPHEUS
Watch that window, Puck! [Neo gets into position by the window] Everyone, make sure this room isn't bugged! [the others seal the room] Alright Stan, listen up! We don't have a lot of time! You've been told Asperger's is real! It isn't! It's just a front we use to stay hidden!
STAN
Wait, it's not a real illness?
MORPHEUS
Of course not! If there was a social development disease, you wouldn't call it Asperger's! That's just, that's just mean! [Stan says silent] There's a big war going on out there, Stan, and we want you to join our fight to bring it all down!
STAN
[gets off the sofa and walks towards the door] Uh, nooo nonono, we're not doing this!
MORPHEUS
You've broken through their reality and they don't like it! Others deserve to know the truth! You see everything as shit, don't you?! [Stan stops in his tracks, astounded] Where other people see fun movies and hear cool music, all you see and hear is shit! Am I right?
STAN
[turns around] Yeah.
NEO
So do we. All of us here. We know the truth too.
MORPHEUS
We found a way to make it stop, Stan. Now are you interested? Or not?
[Cartman Burger, day. Cartman has set up a burger stand in front of his house. Burgers are $5 each. Butters and Kenny are dressed in Cartman Burger uniforms and are helping Cartman run the stand, with Kyle at the grill. To Cartman's left is a booth made from a large Thompson delivery box that now houses a secret last process in burger preparation. A bunch of kids have already gathered and are eating the hottest thing in the neighborhood. Among the bunch are Scott, Craig, Kevin, and Lola. Kevin has just bought his burger and chips]
CARTMAN
Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful.
CLYDE
[walking by eating a burger] I just can't believe how yummy these are.
CARTMAN
There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips.
MOLLY
Thanks!
CARTMAN
How are we doing on those patties, Jew?
KYLE
About three minutes, fatass!
CARTMAN
Nice!
BUTTERS
Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more.
CARTMAN
It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer.
KYLE
[rushes up in time to stop him] Dude, come on Cartman. As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?
CARTMAN
I'm sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school. Now, let me get those hamburgers. [Kyle may have noticed, but he doesn't say anything about the burgers stuffed down behind Cartman's ass and legs. Cartman goes into the booth, and moments later comes out with a fresh batch of finished burgers] Alright, these are good to go! [More kids have gathered. Among them are Esther, Heidi, Red, Bill, and Tommy.]
[Asperger's Research Center, day. The people there set up their secret headquarters - computers, monitors, probes, etc.]
MORPHEUS
Alright, is he ready to be sent in?
BALD GUY
He's ready! Beta levels are normal.
STAN
Who are you people?
MORPHEUS
We are the Secret Society of Cynics. [walks off a bit and sighs] Everything looks like shit to you, right? What if I were to tell you... that you're seeing the world the way it actually is?
STAN
Huh?
MORPHEUS
The world around us has all completely turned to shit. But aliens are putting out a brainwave that keeps most people seeing a false reality
STAN
Aliens?
MORPHEUS
Or, robots from the future, whatever. The point is they need to keep everyone in a blissful state of ignorance.
NEO 2
Yeah. Everything used to be awesome and cool, but now everything's gone to shit and nobody knows except us!
NEO
Yeah!
STAN
Because of aliens? [crosses his arms]
MORPHEUS
Or genetically altered humans, whatever, fuck you! All that matters is that you are the key to bringing this whole thing down. They know who we are, but they won't be expecting you! Are you ready to go back into the illusionary world you once lived in?
STAN
Yeah I'm ready!
MORPHEUS
Let's send him in! [a member of the society prepares a drink for Stan - whiskey on the rocks - and gives it to Morpheus, who hands it over to Stan] Drink this. [Stan hesitates, then takes it and drinks it down. He steps outside and everything is as lovely as it ever was. No signs of shit anywhere.]
STAN
Ahhhh! [walks around town looking at it with a new sense of wonder, but his walking is off] Oh coool!
[in a theater viewing an Adam Sandler film]
ADAM SANDLER
Jill, you got a date with Al Pacino?
JILL
I think Al Pacino wants to play Twister with your sister.
STAN
[laughs rather heartily, looking drunk] Adam Sandler's funny.
[Cartman Burger, day. A crowd of kids has gathered, either enjoying their burgers or waiting in line. The little stand has been replaced by a bigger, studier stand, with a wooden awning along the façade and a covered area behind it. Some makeshift tables have been set out. Butters isn't present yet]
BUTTERS
[approaches Kyle] Hey Kyle, you have a visitor. [Kyle leaves to see who it is]
KYLE
Stan? [Stan is looking away, drunk]
STAN
[sees him] Kyle! [falls into Kyle's arms]
KYLE
Hey, Stan!
STAN
[his speech is slurred] Dude, I'm sorry. I've been a shitty friend. I miss my buddy. You were right: Adam Sandler is fuckin' hysterical!
KYLE
Stan, are you alright?
STAN
Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit.
KYLE
Really? Uh, Stan, that's great. [smiles. Cartman leans back and looks over from the stand]
STAN
[squints his eyes] But Kyle, it's all shit! For real! It's all shit 'cause the aliens with AI and you and me are gonna fuck it all up! Come on! [turns around excitedly]
KYLE
Dude. Have you been drinking?
STAN
You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!
KYLE
It's too late for that. Things just can't go back, Stan, uh. [Cartman takes a quick order, then looks back at Stan and Kyle] Ah-I'm with Cartman Burger now.
STAN
...Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin' concept? [Cartman walks over, drying his hands off in the process]
KYLE
See? There you go again. Look at you dude. Look what you've become.
CARTMAN
Everything alright here, Kyle?
KYLE
Yeah, it's fine.
CARTMAN
We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon.
KYLE
Yeah yeah, ahh I'll be right there.
STAN
Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?!
KYLE
Look, dude, things around here have changed. Sometimes, the only way to keep going is to make a left turn.
STAN
[a couple of seconds of silence, then Stan gives him the finger.] Fuck you Kyle, you're a piece of shit! [Kyle sighs and walks back to the burger stand] ...Kyle, I love you. [Kyle reappears a few seconds later, and Stan gives him the finger again.] You're a piece of shit though. Fuck you! [Kyle turns heel and walks back towards the stand] ...I love you. [Kyle does not return]
[Next morning, Stan's room. The radio alarm wakes him up at 7, as usual. Laughter comes from the speaker]
BIG HARRY
Big Harry and Mike in the Morning and in case you didn't catch last night's episode of [poop sounds], we're breakin' it down.
MIKE
Oh Big Harry, when the [poop sounds] ran into the [poop sounds]- [Stan sits up, then scoots towards the alarm]
BIG HARRY
Nonono, no! How about when [poop sounds. Stan turns off the alarm, then hops off the bed.].
[Asperger's Research Center, day. Stan goes into the center with a bad headache. He has a hangover.]
MORPHEUS
He's back! [the other members jump up and gather around Stan] Did you see the illusionary world again?
NEO
How does it feel to be back in the Matrix?
STAN
I feel like total shit.
BALD GUY
It's okay. That's just your brain levels adjusting back to the real world.
MORPHEUS
Try and focus, Stan: we've found them! We know where the rock creatures are now.
STAN
The rock creatures?
MORPHEUS
Or aliens, or AI- things. Whatever, fuck you.
STAN
Dude, I canh- I... I can't do any...
NEO
He's gonna pop! [Stan vomits and falls over on his face. He passes out. The other members gather around him even closer. Fade to black. Some time later, Stan's eyes blink.]
MORPHEUS
Come on kid, there's not a lot of time left.
NEO
You're pushin' him too hard!
STAN
Ugh God.
MORPHEUS
Stan, you have to convince people they're living in a world of illusion. We're sending you back in! [a pair of doors in the ceiling slide open and a giant bottle of Jameson Irish Whiskey drops down, being held in place by a robotic arm. A nippled syringe pulls forward and enters Stan's mouth and begins pumping him full of whiskey. Stan can only look down helplessly]
[A darkened boardroom. Sevem shadowed figures sit around a boardroom table]
FIGURE 1
We all know why we are here. There's a rebellion in our midst and it must be SQUASHED OUT! [it's a McDonald's executive] We have to put an end, to Cartman Burgers. [the other executives seen are from KFC, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Subway, Chick-fil-A, and Taco Bell.]
OTHER EXECS
Yes, yes, but what do we do?
KFC EXEC
At KFC we've seen a 50% drop in sales.
PIZZA HUT EXEC
It's worse at Pizza Hut. Cartman Burgers choked out the market.
MCDONALD'S EXEC
[gets up from his chair and paces a bit] What makes them so good? For whatever reason, these Cartman Burgers satisfy the taste cravings from all of our restaurants!
TACO BELL EXEC
[walks up to a chart and then turns to show the other execs.] There lies the secret. [eight restaurants are shown on the chart, including City Wok. An arrow from each of the restaurants points towards a Cartman Burger in the middle] It's the chemical compounds from all our flavors. Pizza Hut, Burger King, KFC, all somehow infused into one burger.
KFC EXEC
[walks up to a whiteboard on which a chemical compound from each restaurant is shown being mixed in a beaker and the combined solution being distilled into the Cartman Burger] It's as if he's somehow taking all the ingredients of our food, breaking them down into some kind of... gas. And them somehow... infusing that gas into his hamburger. What kind of instrument could he be using to do this?
PIZZA HUT EXEC
It would have to be some sort of super Dutch oven.
BURGER KING EXEC
But a Dutch oven with greater technology than we've ever seen. [Behind them, Stan breaks into the boardroom through the window]
STAN
[falls onto the floor] Aughah. [gets up and starts firing indiscriminately, moaning all the while. He falls on his back, fires off a few more shots, turns his head to his left side, and throws up. He passes out]
[Some time later. The execs have tied him down to a chair quite securely and wait a while. An arm reaches forward and tries to rouse him]
MCDONALD'S EXEC
Hey! Wake up. Come on now, wake up! [looks at the Taco Bell Exec] Use the smelling salts! [the Taco Bell Exec puts an enchirito under Stan's nose]
STAN
[sniffs and then smacks his lips a bit, finally waking up] ...Enchirito?
MCDONALD'S EXEC
You know the secret?
STAN
What? You guys are aliens?
MCDONALD'S EXEC
Stop playing with us! What's the secret behind Cartman Burger's amazing taste?!
STAN
Dude, I don't know!
TACO BELL EXEC
He's lying! [reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a picture of Kyle] You see this kid in the picture? This guy is his best friend.
MCDONALD'S EXEC
Ah ha!
STAN
I'm not friends with him.
TACO BELL EXEC
They've been through everything together. Inseparable.
STAN
No, no, we don't hang out anymore.
MCDONALD'S EXEC
Oho right, like someone would just walk away from a friendship like that?
STAN
Dude, I didn't walk away! I turned 10 and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-!
MCDONALD'S EXEC
Oh sure! Anyone would ditch out on their best friend 'cause they weren't feeling good! Now stop playing games and tell us why Cartman Burgers is so delicious!
STAN
I don't know!
MCDONALD'S EXEC
Alright, I guess we're going to have to do this the hard way.
[Cartman Burger, day. The place is packed with kids now. The crew is taking a break: Kenny and Butters are chatting by the grill as Kyle delivers some burgers to Cartman.]
KYLE
There, ten mediums and five medium-rares.
CARTMAN
Alright, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer.
KYLE
Next please. [smiles, but quickly frowns upon seeing the next customer] Oh, hey.
STAN
Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.
KYLE
What are you doing?
STAN
How do you guys make them so yummy?
KYLE
I don't know.
MCDONALD'S EXEC
[hiding in some bushes with the other execs] You'd BETTER get him to tell you or you're getting shot in the back of the head! [The Chick-fil-A exec has a sniper's gun trained on Stan's head. Stan is wearing an ear piece] You got that?!
STAN
[panicking, but with great restraint] Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger
KYLE
Why?! So that we can lose our business and everything can go back to old times?!
STAN
No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me.
KYLE
[rolls his eyes] Oh God! Look, I know you got Asperger's from the school and I I'm sorry. But your negativity is poison to me!
MCDONALD'S EXEC
Oh, right. Like a friend would walk out on somebody who was diagnosed with a serious illness!
STAN
Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault!
KYLE
You said "fuck you" to my face, Stan.
STAN
Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying.
MCDONALD'S EXEC
Oh yeah, like any friend would say something that severe and then try to take it back.
KYLE
Alright, look. I honestly don't know the secret, dude. Only Cartman does, and that's how it's gonna work for us.
MCDONALD'S EXEC
[comes out of the bushes and goes to the stand] Goddamnit this is getting us nowhere! [the other execs follow him onto the sidewalk] Everyone get back! Do you wanna play hardball?! That's fine! [the Chick-fil-A exec wields his gun and the kids scream and scatter. The McDonald's exec goes to the Secret Last Process Booth] All right, let's see this mighty machine once and for all! [before he can see anything, he's gunned down by the drunken research center/Matrix members, who then start firing away indiscriminately with their semi-automatics]
MORPHEUS
[dispatching the Taco Bell exec] You vampire sons of bitches! [the Chick-fil-A, Burger King and Subway execs go down, then the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell execs]
NEO
Haha! [accidentally shoots himself in the head and goes down]
MORPHEUS
Alright, nice work Stan. Now comes the final step! You have to take out Duck President!
STAN
Just stop it! You people are so full of shit!
MR. MATHERS
Uh oh, looks like the serum is wearing off! [whips out a glass and a bottle of whiskey] Here, you'd better take some more! [pours the whiskey in the glass]
STAN
No, I'm done with that! [slaps it away from the member's hand]
MORPHEUS
But Stan, you have to take down the bad guys and go through a personal transformation, so that everything can go back to the way it was!
STAN
I don't want everything to go back to the way it was! [suddenly calm] I, I don't. [he steps over the broken bottle, leaves and joins the other kids, who have returned] You were right, Kyle. Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a big left turn. I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now. I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude. It's okay. You're gonna do this and I'm gonna do my thing and ...my mom and dad aren't getting back together. But you know what? It's okay. In fact, it's better. Change is gonna bring new things to all of us. Where will Cartman Burger go from here? That'll be cool to see. And it opens me up to a whole new adventure, exploring... new relationships with all new people in town. [approaches one boy] Maybe this kid will become my new best friend. [then another] Or maybe this kid will.
DOUGLAS
Wow. [smiles]
STAN
Maybe it won't be like before, but... at least it'll all be new. And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going. For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited. [a horn and the sound of wheels stopping are heard]
RANDY
[in the U-Haul truck] Stan? Stan! Get in the car, Stan! Your mom and I are movin' back in together!
STAN
[his face drops] What?
RANDY
We worked it out, pal. Surprise!
STAN
No, dad, no. No, please!
[At the apartment, Stan's room, day. Sharon and Stan talk]
SHARON
[somber and unsure] We talked a lot and, we know it's what's best for you kids and, I don't know...
STAN
No, Mom, sometimes you've got- a left turn.
SHARON
People get older, Stanley. And as you get older you realize... the best thing to do is just... stick with what you know.
["Landslide" plays again, with everything going in reverse. The realtor removes the sign she had placed in front of the Marsh house. The Marsh family moves back in. Randy and Sharon work together to take the sofa back inside while Shelly carries her own box. Sharon sets up Stan's room again almost as he had it before they moved. Randy carries in another box of Stan's stuff. Stan looks out over the neighborhood from his window... which was apparently across from Cartman's house all this time, for he sees Cartman Burger and the crowd of kids and adults across the street.]
KYLE
You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?!
CROWD
Eeewww!
[The sitting president, who is a duck, is removed and Barack Obama resumes his presidency. In his backyard, Randy Marsh makes a small bonfire of all his Steamy Ray Vaughn stuff. At Stark's Pond, Wendy and Stan share a picnic, but he's not interested enough to puke on her. At the dinner table, Stan isn't eating, but looks down and away. Finally, in his bedroom, the radio wakes him up at 7 AM., like always. His favorite morning show comes back on]
BIG HARRY
I like that!
MIKE
Yeah.
BIG HARRY
Big Harry and Mike in the Morning, talkin' about Two and a Half Men. I think Ashton Kutcher makes it the show to be seen, Mike.
MIKE
Yeah, but what about that movie Dolphin Tale? I am psyched for that!
BIG HARRY
Dolphin Tale, Big Harry and Mike in the Morning. [Stan sits up] Let's hear one from the band Slamjammer and their song- [Stan turns the radio off. There's a knock on his door]
KYLE
[enters with Cartman and Kenny] Dude, we're gonna see the new Zoopeeker movie!
CARTMAN
The Zookeeper 2: Zookeepier! [they walk back out and away.]
STAN
...K, coming. [hops out of bed and puts on his coat, going through the motions. He walks out to join the boys, but a few seconds later he returns to open a drawer, pull out a bottle of whiskey, opens it, takes a swig of it, closes it, and puts it back in the drawer. He doesn't bother to put on his shoes. He closes the drawer and heads back into the hall]
End of Ass Burgers


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The kid's most scandalous secrets are being leaked on an outrageous new gossip website.

script:Bass to Mouth

[South Park Elementary, day. The kids are in the hallway. Butters walks with Kenny, Stan and Kyle are at their lockers, and Cartman comes into view at the far end of the hallway]
CARTMAN
YOU GUYS! Oh my God, you guys! [runs up to Butters, Kenny, Stan, and Kyle] You're never gonna guess what! [stands among them] Seriously you guys, guess what??
STAN
What?
CARTMAN
You guys, you know Pete Melman? [no one answers] Fourth Grade, Mr. Bart's class?
KYLE
The blond kid?
CARTMAN
Yeah yeah, Pete Melman!
STAN
What about him?
CARTMAN
He crapped his pants today during social studies! He had to go to the nurse's office, and have his mom bring him a fresh pair of jeans! [begins to cackle]
KYLE
[angry] How do you know?!
CARTMAN
Because, dude, it's all over Eavesdropper!
BUTTERS
Eavesdropper?
KYLE
What's that?
CARTMAN
Puhah! You guys don't follow Eavesdropper? [whips out an iPhone and starts looking for the Eavesdropper article] It's a Web site about all the students in the school! [The web site screams "Exclusive! Pete Melman Craps Pants At School!" at you. Part of the page has a picture of Pete on there, with a 'play' button to play a recording]
CLYDE
[appears at the far end of the hallway] Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper? Pete Melman shit his pants! [runs off to tell others]
CARTMAN
Yeah yeah, I'm showin' the guys! [gets back to his phone] Check it out. Eavesdropper got a hold of the phone call from the nurse to Pete Melman's mom. [touches the 'play' button] Just listen, listen listen.
NURSE BRONSKI
Hello Mrs. Melman, this is the school nurse. I'm afraid your son has had a little accident. [Cartman snickers quietly]
MRS. MELMAN
Oh no, what is it? Is he okay?
STAN
Turn it up. [Cartman obliges]
NURSE BRONSKI
No no, it's not serious, but he went number two during class. [Cartman grins big, Butters grins a little, Kyle is a little disgusted] I'm afraid he's gonna need a new pair of pants and underwear, and a clean pair of socks.
CRAIG
Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper?
CARTMAN
Yeah yeah, we're listenin' to it! [laughs. Craig moves on]
KYLE
Dude, that's so wrong!
BUTTERS
[moves off] Hey! Pete Melman pooped his pants and uh had to have his mom bring him new undies!
CARTMAN
Okay okay, so what do we call Pete Melman when we see him? I was thinking, "Poopypants Pete", but th- but then I also thought of "Mushpants Melman."
MR. MACKEY
[over the PA system] Attention South Park Students: will the following students report to the Principal's office immediately? Eric Cartman? Thank you.
CARTMAN
Oh Jesus, what now?! [goes to the office]
[Principal's office, faculty room. Cartman sits at one end of the faculty table while Principal Victoria sits at the other end, flanked by Mr. Mackey on her right and Mr. Adler on her left. The clock reads 2:03 p.m.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Eric, as you might have heard, a student here in South Park Elementary had an accident in the classroom.
CARTMAN
Puh-I know, dude. Pete Melman crapped his pants. So freakin' funny! [slaps the table and laughs]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oookay, but you probably understand that for Pete, it isn't that funny. For him it's embarrassing and terrifying.
CARTMAN
Tchehe, right. That's why it's super funny to me.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Eric, it has been almost one year since Corey Duran defecated in his pants here in school. Now, you remember what happened to him?
CARTMAN
[smiles] Yeah, he killed himself.
MR. MACKEY
Yes, and the reason he killed himself, Eric, was that the ridicule and the torment from other students, [points] spearheaded by you, cause him-!
CARTMAN
Hey! Whoooa.
MR. MACKEY
Spearheaded by you, m'kay, made him feel there was no other way out.
CARTMAN
'Kay, whoa, whoa! We've been through this, you cannot put Corey Duran's death on me! I'm not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone!
MR. ADLER
Eric, we are asking you to please just remember what happened to Corey and not let it happen to Pete.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Please just let it go.
CARTMAN
You're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to just ignore that so he can have a normal life?!
MR. MACKEY
We are hoping that if you don't fan the flames, Eric, the other students might forget might forget about it!
CARTMAN
Do you really think information like this will just die down? There's Internet! There's Eavesdropper! You might be worried Pete Melman is gonna kill himself, but the truth is, he was dead the second he crapped his pants.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[stands up and walks to the window, then looks out] Alright Eric, here's the deal: This school cannot have another suicide on its hands. We want you to see Pete Melman through this, and turn public opinion around.
CARTMAN
[scoff] Heh! You're crazy! It can't be done!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
If Pete Melman does not kill himself, [turns around] we will make it very worth your while.
CARTMAN
You aren't listing to anythin- [checks himself] Make it worth my while how?
[South Park Elementary, day. The kids are in the hallway again. Must be a rainy day, as some of the kids are eating lunches in the hall. Butters, Craig, and Stan walk towards the camera, with Craig looking at his iPhone. The three are laughing. Kyle appears and approaches them]
STAN
No way.
KYLE
What's up?
STAN
The-hay've got a video of Pete Melman's mom showing up with fresh underwear on Eavesdropper!
KYLE
Dude, that's fucked up.
STAN
Come on dude, it's pretty funny.
KYLE
It's funny that something that should be completely private is put up on a Web site for everyone to see??
STAN
Yeah dude, that's pretty funny.
BUTTERS
It's megasuperhilarious! [a girl is putting her books away when Cartman approaches her]
CARTMAN
Uh, hey Jenny. 'Sup?
JENNY
What do you want?
CARTMAN
Did you hear about Pete Melman? Pretty messed up, huh?
JENNY
[gets her bag lunch, closes her locker and walks away] Yeah, it's gross! [Cartman stands by her locker for a moment, then catches up to her]
CARTMAN
So... whatcha doin' for lunch? Uh, my mom packed me the best stuff. She even baked cupcakes. [takes out a box of cupcakes from his backpack]
JENNY
[unimpressed] So what?
CARTMAN
I was just thinking that... m-m-maybe we could... eat lunch together. I've always kind of... [gulps] liked you.
JENNY
I don't like you!
CARTMAN
I know. Uh, I know you don't like me back. I ju- Yeah, you know, the- this was stupid, I'm sorry. Will you just take a cupcake? [getting uncomfortable, he puts the cupcake in the box and the box away in his back pack] Oh, don't take the cupc- I, I'm sorry. I, I'm sorry I wasted your time. [walks quickly away]
JENNY
Hey. Wait. [Cartman stops and Jenny catches up] Look, I'm sorry. That was mean. I'd love to try one of your mom's cupcakes.
[Fourth grade, Mr. Garrison's class. The kids have all taken their seats. Mr. Garrison is going over a test on sea life.]
MR. GARRISON
And now number 17 many of you got wrong as well. The correct answer was D, whales are mammals. [Jenny gets a sharp pain in her stomach]
JENNY
Oh! Gahhh. Ohf.
MR. GARRISON
They're not fish like some of you retards chose.
CARTMAN
[concerned, while Mr. Garrision is talking] You okay, Jenny?
JENNY
Yeah, I'm fine, I just- Awwgh! [can't stand it much longer] M-Mr. Garrison? Can I please [winces] be excused?
CARTMAN
Excused? Oh, oh but we are in the middle of class. [Jenny moans even more]
MR. GARRISON
What's the matter?
JENNY
Gah, I just need to go to the restroom!
MR. GARRISON
Well, okay.
CARTMAN
Uh, Mr. Garrison, I don't think that's quite fair, uh I mean, you rarely let us get up and leave during the class.
JENNY
Please! I've gotta go now!
CARTMAN
Well, just give it a couple of minutes, Jenny. It could just be a cramp.
JENNY
[leaves her seat] No, Mr. Garrison, I've gotta- go- AAAH! [lets out a wet fart and poops her pants]
CLASS
Eeeeww! [Jenny can't hold it in. Bebe and Stan leave their seats while Cartman stands on his desk]
CARTMAN
Oh, my God! Jenny Simons crapped her pants! [Millie, Tolkien, and Wendy leave] Did you guys hear that?! Oh, my God! [Kyle and Clyde leave] It's WAY worse than Pete Melman was!
KIDS
Sick!
CARTMAN
WAY worse!
TIMMY
Gross. [Jenny begins to bawl over her embarrassment]
[Principal's office faculty lounge. Mr. Adler, Principal Victoria, and Mr. Mackey have gathered again to meet with Cartman. Silence fills the room]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
...The Doctors say that Jenny Simon barely survived the fall. Jumping off the school roof fractured her pelvis.
CARTMAN
Alright, kewl.
MR. MACKEY
[shoots back] No, not cool! M'kay, she's on suicide watch, Eric! She's given up on life!
CARTMAN
You said Pete Melman couldn't kill himself! By making Jenny Simons crap her pants worse than Pete, I've made her the number one story on Eavesdropper! [shows them the story on his iPhone]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[shoving her chair aside. It falls to the floor] That's wasn't the point, Eric! Nobody was supposed to kill themselves! Unless you fix this our deal is off!
CARTMAN
Nobody can be made fun of for crapping their pants, and nobody can die!
THE THREE ADULTS
Yes!
CARTMAN
Jesus Christ! [thinks hard] Okay, okay. [squeezes his eyes shut, puts his hands over them, removes the right hand] Um, Jesus- [removes the left hand] ah... Okay, look. [the adults lean in a bit] Okay those, those tests we took last week? The state efficiency tests? How did we do on those?
MR. MACKEY
Our students did average, maybe just below average.
CARTMAN
Okay, no, they all did awesome! In fact our students did so good on the tests that you... [turns his head left for a moment, still hasn't opened his eyes] you decided to reward them all. At lunch you're serving the students pizza from Pizza Hut! But we're going to put laxatives and Arby's horsey sauce in the pizza so that every kid in the school craps their pants after recess. Everyone craps their pants, nobody's singled out, problem solved. [Victoria, Adler, and Mackey just stare at him]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
That's insane!
CARTMAN
Okay, well, if you have a better idea, then why am I here? [Mr. Adler looks at Principal Victoria, Principal Victoria looks at Mr. Mackey, Mr. Mackey places a call.]
MR. MACKEY
Uh, hi, Jan, it's Counselor Mackey. Uh... how long would it take to organize a Pizza Friday for the students? Yeah, yeah... no, they uh, they actually did really well on the state exam. Yeah, mkay.
[The school hallway, day. Butters, Craig and Stan are laughing at another Eavesdropper headline as Kyle rounds the corner behind them. Kyle walks up to them]
STAN
Dude, check it out! Eavesdropper found an e-mail from Jenny Simons' boyfriend calling her "soft-serve Simon."
KYLE
That's not funny.
CRAIG
Hey, here's a post about Tolkien: "Tolkien Black's Private Gym Photos" [laughs]
KYLE
[rolls his eyes] I'm not looking at that!
STAN
Come on, dude, it's pretty funny!
KYLE
It wouldn't be funny if that Web site posted something about you!
STAN
I wouldn't care.
CRAIG
Exclusive: Stan Marsh thinks Elise Thompson has a hot butt crack.
STAN
What?
CRAIG
"In an email sent yesterday to KENNY McCormick, Stan Marsh wrote 'Dude, you should have been in PE today. Elise Thompson's butt crack was totally showing.' He went on to call her butt crack quote 'nice' and that the whole experience was quote 'pretty awesome'."
STAN
[sees Kenny and walks up to him at his locker] Kenny! Kenny, what the fuck?!
KENNY
(What?)
STAN
How did Eavesdropper get a hold of my e-mail to you?!
KENNY
(I don't know.)
STAN
Do you just leave your e-mails open for everyone to read?!
KENNY
(No!)
STAN
That was a private e-mail from me to you! [notices a pissed-off Wendy approaching] Hey Wendy.
WENDY
You like looking at girls' butt cracks, Stan?!
KENNY
(Oh, fuck. I'm gettin' out of here!) [closes his locker and leaves]
STAN
No, I was telling Kenny he would like it.
WENDY
Do you have any idea how embarrassed I am?! [Stan leans away a bit]
STAN
Wendy, it was just a quick e-mail to Kenny. New stories pop up on Eavesdropper every hour. People are gonna forget all about this.
WENDY
So you didn't e-mail anybody else about Elise Thompson's butt crack, right?! [Stan stays silent]
[South Park Elementary Library. Stan has convened a meeting of some of his classmates and is now at the podium]
STAN
This is an issue of trust and privacy! We have to all work together to put an end to Eavesdropper once and for all! [The others present are Red, Kenny, Butters, Craig (looking at his iPhone), Wendy, Kyle, Bebe, and Tolkien. Kyle raises his hand] Yes, Kyle.
KYLE
So, just to be completely clear, now it isn't funny, right?
STAN
Ugh, What's funny about having our private lives hacked into?!
WENDY
Specially when they're writing about your boyfriend's addiction to crack. [Butters laughs at Wendy's wisecrack in a weird way]
STAN
Shut up Butters! What we have to find out is who in the school is running Eavesdropper! I've done an extensive profile, and I've narrowed it down to somebody in this very room! [the other eight look at each other] Now whoever you are, you're a gossiping little bitch! [pounds the podium with his fists] And we're not gonna-!
CRAIG
[reading off his iPhone] It's not somebody in this room.
STAN
What? How do you know?
CRAIG
Because whoever it is just now posted a new story on Eavesdropper: "Allison Taft reveals embarrassing secret about Craig Tucker." [laughs] Yeah. Hey wait, that's me.
KYLE
Where is it coming from?
CRAIG
Huh?
KYLE
If it's on the school network we can track the IP address. [takes Craig's iPhone and sets about tracing the IP address. The kids head into the hallway and pass by the music room] This way. In here. [they stop at the music room door] Whoever it is using the computer in the music room.
STAN
We only have music class on Thursday.
WENDY
Of course. A kid could use the computer in there and nobody would know.
KYLE
Get ready guys. Whoever is in here is the kid that's hacking our e-mails and phone calls! You guys ready?!
STAN
Oh I'm ready!
KYLE
One. [Stan makes fists and tenses up] Two. Three! [opens the door and the nine kids run in, but they're all surprised at what they see. It's a gerbil typing away into the Eavesdropper Web site. This week on Spee: Jenny Simons Still On Suicide Watch]
CRAIG
It's a rat! [the gerbil noticed them and runs away]
KYLE
Get it! [the kids give chase. Craig and Kyle run into each other and fall trying to get the gerbil. Bebe and Tolkien fall giving chase]
STAN
Don't let him get away!
TOLKIEN
He's gone!
STAN
What the hell? A stupid rat is in charge of Eavesdropper?
KYLE
Wikileaks. [Kyle is now at the computer looking at the login screen] It says here his name is Wikileaks.
[A boy's bedroom, full of panda stuff. On the boy's desk is a cage with a gerbil in it - Lemmiwinks. He runs in his wheel for a while, then steps off it for a sip of water. When he's done, the Frog King appears before him]
FROG KING
Lemmiwinks! I come with news of great gravity. Another rodent is out there, spreading terrible rumors and hacking e-mails. [Lemmiwinks makes some noises] Yes. And I'm afraid the ne
ws is worse. The creature doing this, Lemmiwinks, is your brother, Wikileaks!
SINGER
Wikileaks, the bum hacker with a heart of doom.
Everyone knows the gerbil king, but no one ever speaks
Of Lemminwinks's brother, the evil Likiweaks...
FROG KING
Once again Wikileaks is trying to wreak havoc on our world. Only you can stop him, Lemmiweaks.
SINGER
Lemmiwinks, King of Gerbils, stop your brother of doom!
[South Park Elementary, hallway. Two girls chat by some lockers]
EMILY
It's just so embarrassing. What if the other girls find out my mother is in rehab?
TAMMY NELSON
It's okay Emily. Can I tell you a secret? My mom has a drinking problem too. [above them, Wikileaks is recording everything they say]
EMILY
Really? You too?
TAMMY NELSON
That's just between us, okay?
EMILY
Of course, Tammy. I'm really glad I shared this with you. [Stan and his gang spot Wikileaks]
STAN
Stop that rat! [Wikileaks jumps off the lockers and runs for the computer lab]
[The Computer Lab, moments later. Wikileaks jumps onto the first computer he sees, logs in, and starts typing in his latest headline: "TAMMY NELSON AND JEN MARX 'HELP!' OUR MOMS ARE VICIOUS DRUNKS!¡" The gang catches up to Wikileaks]
STAN
Knock it off! [Wikileaks hops off and heads for the nearest air vent, and makes his escape]
[The school library. A boy is typing into his iPhone]
TOMMY EDWARDS
I just want you to know that I have a hure crush on you and- [Wikileaks runs by and snatches the phone away in his teeth] HEY! [Wikileaks runs to the nearest computer, logs in, and types in the latest headline: "TOMMY EDWARDS HAS A CRUSH ON MARLA WATKINS" Butters looks in and spots Wikileaks. Wikileaks notices him]
BUTTERS
NO Wikileaks! Bad!
[The school cafeteria, at that moment. In the kitchen Mr. Adler, Principal Victoria, Cartman, and Mr. Mackey add Ease-Lax laxatives to the pizzas just brought in from Pizza Hut]
CARTMAN
Yup, a few more laxatives on that one, a little more Arby's horsey sauce on there, mhm.
MR. MACKEY
Eh, Is this one good?
CARTMAN
Yeah, I think they're all ready.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
You sure this will work, Eric? What if some of the students don't eat the pizza?
CARTMAN
It doesn't matter. Enough students will crap their pants to make everyone forget about Pete Melman and Jenny Simons forever.
MR. MACKEY
Alright Eric, well, well get back to class. We don't want anyone seeing you in here with us.
CARTMAN
Uh, hold on just a second! I believe we discussed the little matter of my payment?! [leaves the preparation table and faces them] I'm not letting you guys screw me over again. Give me what I wanted, now!
MR. MACKEY
Alright, fine. Bring her in, Adler. [Mr. Adler leaves, then returns with a grinning Selena Gomez]
CARTMAN
Oh my God! Selena Gomez! You [gasp] you actually got her to come! [grins]
SELENA GOMEZ
Hi Eric. I understand you really wanted to meet me. Wanna get a picture together?
CARTMAN
No thanks. Okay, proceed.
MR. MACKEY
I/m sorry about this, Ms. Gomez. [Mr. Mackey punches her on the stomach twice. Cartman is awed, then smiles. Principal Victoria then smashes Gomez on the head with a baking tray] Alright, get her the fuck out of here. [Mr. Adler hauls Ms. Gomes away.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Okay, Eric, you got what you wanted. Are we straight?
CARTMAN
That. Was. Amazing.
MR. MACKEY
Alright now, get back to class! Adler, get rid of those laxative bottles! Trash all the Arby's horsey sauce packages too! There cannot be one piece of evidence of what we did here! [they hear some small gerbil sounds] What the? [notices Likiweaks on a shelf recording the action] Oh shit! [Wikiweaks runs away] Stop that rat!
[The boy's bedroom, day. Lemmiwinks is back in his wheel, exercising]
FROG KING
Alright Lemmiwinks, we should probably get going now... The time is nigh, Lemmiwinks. Let us chase your destiny. [The Sparrow Prince flies in through the open window and lands on the upper edge of the gerbil cage] Ah! Sparrow Prince! What news do you bring?
SPARROW PRINCE
Wikileaks grows stronger with each passing moment. [jumps down into the cage] The birds are tweeting that he is about to release his biggest story yet.
FROG KING
Then the moment is truly here! Come Lemmiwinks! Let us make haste! Le-le-Lemmiwinks? His heart is so heavy. I weep for him.
SPARROW PRINCE
Indeed. Could you do it, Frog Prince? Could you kill your own brother?
FROG KING
I thank God I don't have to make that decision. [the two of them then just observe Lemmiwinks.] We might need to bring in some outside help.
[Back in the music room, Stan is on the computer as the other eight kids look on]
STAN
You see? There, look! It says Eavesdropper's biggest story every is coming out this afternoon.
BUTTERS
Biggest story about who?
CRAIG
There's no telling. It could be about any of us. [Stan gets off the computer and notices something happening above him as a blinding light appears. The light softens to reveal the Catatafish]
CATATAFISH
Well met, children of Adam. I, am Catatafish.
SINGERS
Catatafish of the Salmon School.
KYLE
What?
CATATAFISH
I come asking for your help. There is only one thing that can stop Wikileaks. But right now Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner.
STAN
Lemmiwinks? Our old class gerbil?
KYLE
What is that thing?
CATATAFISH
I am Catatafish. I am a great wizard and, I am a friend. And I'm a ghost, besides of course being a fish.
SINGERS
Catatafish's tale will soon be told.
STAN
Do you know why a gerbil is running around hacking our phone calls and putting our secrets up on the Internet?
CATATAFISH
He does it purely for reasons of evil. And his treachery is not limited to humans. Wikileaks posted exaggerated things about me, too. He posted on his Web site that I had sex with an underage fish, and that I made her perform bass to mouth. If you accept this quest you will help the Gerbil King defeat Wikileaks once and for all! But the choice is yours. I'm not here to make you do anything. Like that underage salmon. I didn't make her do anything. If she wants to do bass to mouth, how is it my fault?
SINGERS
Catatafish made a salmon suck asshole.
CATATAFISH
No! No, see, that's wrong! It's being exaggerated again!
KYLE
Just tell us where Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner so we can kill this stupid rat!
CATATAFISH
Careful child! I assure you, Wikileaks is anything but stupid, except when he said I made that teenage fish perform ass to trout. That was stupid and untrue. Did I say ass to trout? I meant to say bass to mouth, though I guess it's basically the same thing, not that I did it.
[The faculty restroom. Principal Victoria looks outside to make sure there's no one or nothing around, then closes the door and locks it. Mr. Mackey checks behind the mirrors for bugs while Mr. Adler checks the stalls]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Alright, are we sure we're alone?
MR. MACKEY
We're alone, now what the hell are we gonna do?
MR. ADLER
What can we do? We're all gonna get fired!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
This story hasn't gone up on Eavesdropper yet. Maybe it won't!
MR. MACKEY
Oh right! "The School Faculty Tries To Poison All Their Students." That's not gonna be on Wikileaks!
MR. ADLER
Oh, let's just face it: We made our beds when we enlisted Eric Cartman's help. We have to lie in them.
MR. MACKEY
All we were tryin' to do was keep another one of our students from killing themselves! We're not bad!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
No, no, we're not bad.
MR. MACKEY
We're not bad. I mean, maybe what we needed was just to think outside the box here. I mean, if there's anything we've learned is that the only thing that makes a juicy story go away is a juicier story.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
What's a bigger story than all the students being made sick?
MR. ADLER
Our students committing suicide?
MR. MACKEY
Hey that's right. Corey Duran killed himself last year and we're STILL dealing with the fallout. Maybe there is a way out of this. But we're gonna have to throw Eric Cartman under the bus.
MR. ADLER
How do we do that?
MR. MACKEY
We get a bus... and then we... throw Eric Cartman under it.
[The boy's house, day. The gang of nine kids has arrived at Lemmiwinks' new home and Stan and Kyle are pounding on the front door.]
MRS. TRUMSKI
[answering the door] Yes?
STAN
Hi. Does a Vernon Trumski live here?
MRS. TRUMSKI
Yes, Vernon's around somewhere.
STAN
Come on, guys! [charges in with the other kids. Mrs. Trumski is about to close the door when Catatafish floats in]
CATATAFISH
Excuse me.
[Vernon's room, moments later. The kids find Lemmiwinks in his cage]
BUTTERS
There he is! [the kids go to the cage] It's Lemmiwinks! [climbs the chair beside Lemminwink's cage]
STAN
Quick, we need something to carry him in!
KYLE
Here's a shoebox! [goes for the shoebox. Vernon walks in at that moment]
VERNON
Hey! What are you doing with my gerbil?!
STAN
We just need to borrow him, kid. [Kyle hands the box to Butters]
VERNON
MOOOM! SOME KIDS ARE STEALING MY GERBIL!
STAN
[walks up to Vernon] Look dude, we don't have much time. Wikileaks is about to post his biggest scoop ever on Eavesdropper! Lemmiwinks can stop him!
VERNON
MOOOM! [Frogn King and Sparrow Prince appear in the middle of the room, hovering, and Vernon and the others notice]
FROG KING
There's no time, children! You must take Lemmiwinks now!
KYLE
Grab him! [Butters scoops Lemmiwinks into the shoe box and the group runs out the front door]
VERNON
[stops just outside the front door] MOOOM! [the group runs down the street]
SINGERS
Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!
FROG KING
Quickly! We must get to the school! [the group makes it to a bus stop just as a transit bus is pulling away]
STAN
Whoa whoa wait, wait! [the bus stops, the door opens, and the group gets on]
[Inside the bus, the kids and the ghost animals take seats]
SINGERS
Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Run, run, the battle's on!
STAN
Can't this thing go any faster?
BUTTERS
Hang on, Lemmiwinks!
SINGERS
Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks! Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Run, run, the battle's on!
STAN
Craig, are we still clear?
CRAIG
Nothing broke on the Web site yet.
FROG KING
Faster driver! The final battle is about to begin! [the driver speeds up]
SINGERS
Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!
[From out of nowhere Mr. Adler and Mr. Mackey toss a bound and gagged Cartman onto the road and watch as the bus runs over him. Principal Victoria is with them. The bus rolls a bit further, but stops due to a broken muffler. The door opens and the group steps out]
KYLE
What the hell happened?!
MR. MACKEY
Oh! Oh God! Oh God he killed himself! Eric Cartman killed himself! Did you see that? Oh why would he do it? [pulls out a letter] Oh wait uh here, here's a suicide note. Mkay. [opens it up and reads it:] Dear Guys, I just cannot go on mkay. I'm tired of being FAT, mkay, and I have to end it all. Mkay. -Eric Cartman.
STAN
Please, can this wait? A big story is about to about to come out on Eavesdropper and we have the only way to stop it!
MR. MACKEY
[thinks a moment] Well why the hell didn't you say so! Come on, let's go!
FROG KING
To battle!
[South Park, midtown. Principal Victoria has got everyone packed in her car and races down the street to get to the school]
SINGERS
Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!
FROG KING
Quickly, while Lemmiwinks still has it in him!
[South Park Elementary. Principal Victoria arrives at school and the group pours out of her car and rushes into the school]
SINGERS
Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Run, run, the battle's on!
[The music room, moments later. Wikileaks types furiously to get the scoop out: "SCHOOL FACULTY TRIES TO POISON STUDENTS!!" Stan leads the group into the music room]
STAN
Stop right there, you little rat!
SINGERS
Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks! Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!
FROG KING
[appears before Wikileaks and stops him] Wikileaks, you have chosen a path of evil and now you shall pay. Sparrow Prince, Catatafish! [Sparrow Prince and Catatafish descend on the shoebox and open it. Lemmiwinks peeks out, then leaves the box]
[The battle begins. The two gerbils stand on their hind legs and face off. Wikileaks runs off and Lemmiwinks quickly follows. The camera tries to follow the action, but gets shaky. The gerbils dance around each other for a few seconds, then rush at each other and fight.]
FROG KING
Oh dude, he is fucking him up!
BUTTERS
Look! I think Lemmiwinks killed him! [Indeed. Lemmiwinks had bit Wikileaks on the jugular and Wikileaks is bleeding. Wikileaks soon stops moving and Lemmiwinks gets off him]
FROG KING
He did it!
MR. MACKEY
[walks over to the computer and gets to work] Okay, let's just delete all this tabloid garbage, mkay.
[South Park Elementary hallway, some days later. Stan puts his stuff away in his locker and closes it. He walks over to Kyle, Kenny... and Cartman, who has casts on his right arm and right leg, and who's walking with a crutch]
STAN
Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with.
KYLE
Yeah, but you know? I think we all learned an important lesson about laughing at other people's misfortunes.
CARTMAN
Boy, I say.
MR. MACKEY
[rounds the corner and sees Cartman] Oh Eric! Uh, Eric, I know we kinda threw you under the bus, mkay, but I hope you understand the faculty didn't really have a choice.
CARTMAN
It's okay Mr. Mackey. I'm totally over it.
MR. MACKEY
Well I think you're being very mature about this, Eric. It was an overly generous move to give all the faculty those cupcakes. I wanna thank you. Mkay.
CARTMAN
Oh, you're most certainly welcome.
MR. MACKEY
[walks through them and continues down the hallway] Well students, why don't we uh- [feels a pain in his stomach] Oooh. Oh, gee, uh...
CARTMAN
Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mackey?
MR. MACKEY
Yeah, I j-I just uh I'll be right back. Oh! [lets out a wet fart] Aaaah! Oh it's bad! [so bad bits of shit shoot out his pants onto the floor] Excuse me kids, I need to run, I gotta WUUGH! [that last movement made him fly into the ceiling and back to the floor] OW!
CARTMAN
[softly] I put a lot of Arby's horsey sauce on those.
MR. MACKEY
[stands up] Okay, can somebody get me some paper towels?? Or maybe a [poot. He hits the ceiling again and falls on his face] Ooowww, okay! [begins to slide down the hallway propelled by the poop and gas coming out his ass] Ooohhh, it's bad!
FROG KING
Congratulations, Lemmiwinks.
SPARROW PRINCE
Thanks to you, private lives will stay private.
CATATAFISH
Yes, we are all free once again to make teenagers do bass to mouth.
FROG KING
Just one question Lemmiwinks: How does it feel to have killed your own brother? [Lemmiwinks just gets up and walks away] Le-Lemmiwinks? [no answer] He's devastated.
SPARROW PRINCE
Yup, he's devastated.
End of Bass to Mouth

synopsis:After Randy takes Sharon to see a hit musical, he becomes Broadway's biggest fan.

script:Broadway Bro Down

[The USGS in Colorado. Four men are shown at their desks working. Nelson is front and center, Randy is behind him to his right, and two more men work behind them]
RANDY
I mean, look guys, I know it's just the Dolphins, but Tebow is definitely our quarterback for the future. What do you think, Nelson?
PETER NELSON
I didn't see the game.
RANDY
[soft sneeze] You didn't see the game? What the hell were you doing?
PETER NELSON
Took the wife down to Denver to see that new musical in town.
RANDY
A musical? [laughs and rises from his chair to approach him] Nelson couldn't watch football 'cause his wife made him take her to a musical! [laughs while moving around the desk]
WORKER 1
[bearded] Good for you, Nelson. Did you get a blowjob afterwards?
PETER NELSON
Sure did.
WORKER 2
[clean-shaven] Niice. [Randy's smile turns into a frown]
RANDY
What?
WORKER 1
I took my girl to see that show last week. Got the best hummer of my entire life afterwards.
PETER NELSON
Forty-five minutes non-stop.
RANDY
[surprised, then] Nuh uh.
WORKER 2
It's true. I'm taking my wife on Saturday bro.
RANDY
[looks back at him for a few seconds] Noh uh.
PETER NELSON
I'm telling you Randy, put your time in with the musical, and the rewards afterwards are awesome.
RANDY
Must be... a pretty hot and steamy show. What's it called?
PETER NELSON
Wicked.
RANDY
[interested] Oh. Wicked.
[Denver, night. Wicked is playing]
SINGERS
...Heaven knows we know what goodness is
O heaven knows wicked people aren't good.
From head to toe, she was just wicked people
Head to toe...
She wasn't good, to know what goodness is...
[During the song, Sharon has her hands over her heart and she's thoroughly enchanted. Randy studies her reactions. Onstage several actors sing their hearts out. One actress descends from the rafters on a large circular ornament. Randy keeps studying Sharon]
RANDY
Hey do you uh, do you want some alcohol or somethin', Sharon?
SHARON
Nono, I'm good, thanks.
RANDY
Okay, I'll be right back. [gets up and heads for the aisle, passing a couple on the way] 'Scuse me, sorry. [leaves the auditorium]
[a bar in the theater. Randy walks up to it and takes a seat. Another man is already at the bar with the bartender]
RANDY
Can I get a scotch and soda? [the bartender goes off to prepare it]
MAN 1
Enjoying the show?
RANDY
[nervous at first] Oh, yeah, it's not really what I expected.
MAN 1
No?
RANDY
To be honest, I'm just here for the blowjob. From what I heard I figured the show must be really sexy and hot, but... I just don't see it happening.
MAN 1
Oh, it'll happen, don't worry. Right now your wife is being shot so full of subliminal messages, all she'll be thinking about afterwards is "blowjob."
RANDY
Subliminal messages?
MAN 1
It's a musical thing. Women are so caught up in all the singing and dancing they don't even notice it but, there's a blowjob reference almost every ten seconds. Broadway writers call it "subtext." Just listen really, really closely.
[The auditorium. Randy returns to his seat]
THE WIZARD
While you'll do great here in the Emerald City, I'm sure you can't wait to go!
SINGERS
Take me away to that special place (that blowjob place)
Where people like us can all live free (Free to give blowjobs)
Take me away and let's live together
That's the place/blowjobs for you (blowjobs) and me
[A man and woman sing next, alternating lines]
WITCHES
Now let's try ... defying ................... gravity ...
MALE
....... Look at them ... becoming friends ... here in Oz, you love blowjobs.
WITCHES
And new loves cry ... defying ................... gravity ...
MALE
....... Suddenly ... Don't you love free love blowjobs?
[The drive home. Sharon's happily looking up beyond the car ceiling]
SHARON
Oho that was so much fun! All the costumes and the sets were amazing! I really love the songs. That Stephen Schwartz is a genius! I've got them all stuck in my head. [swoons a bit, then looks at Randy, then at his crotch, then at him again] Hey, that was such a treat. How would you like a little treat? [looks at his crotch again. Randy looks at her in surprise. She giggles and takes off her seatbelt, then leans over and begins to give him a blowjob]
RANDY
[softly] Whoa, no way!
[Park County Recreation Center, day. It has an aquatic center, and in there a bunch of kids stand in line for turns on the diving board. One fat kid is on the diving board wearing a life preserver. Waiting for the board are Stan, Cartman, Shelly, Kenny, and Clyde, amongst others. The fat kid is quite afraid and is crying]
STAN
Come on, Larry! [Larry continues crying] Dude, why does this happen every time?
SHELLY
Do something, you stupid vegan!
CARTMAN
Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach!
[At the other end of the pool are Coach Randy and his coworkers, and Stephen Stotch]
RANDY
You just don't get it, Stotch! I'm telling you, go see Wicked! It's the best time!
MAN 2
How long was it?
RANDY
She started in the car, and then it lasted the whole drive home, and then, she kept going for like another twenty minutes.
WORKER 2
Nice, bro!
RANDY
Get tickets, Stotch, it's worth it.
STEPHEN
What was the show about?
RANDY
Uh, shit, I don't know, some green chick and a goat or something.
[The diving board. Larry is still crying up there. Shelly makes her move.]
STAN
Come on, Feegan, either jump or get off! [Shelly walks up the little ladder to the board and jumps up and down]
SHELLY
Go! Go! [Larry bounces up and down crying, but doesn't fall into the water]
[The other end of the pool]
RANDY
Look, I thought Broadway musicals weren't for me either, but I just didn't know about the whole subtext thing, you know? I couldn't really appreciate 'em till now.
WORKER 2
Wicked isn't even the best, bro. You've gotta check out Jersey Boys! It makes women hummer crazy!
RANDY
Really??
WORKER 1
Nonono, have you see South Pacific? That's a jaw-breaker.
[The Marsh house. Sharon is at the computer when Randy walks in]
RANDY
Say Sharon, how would you like to go to New York for the weekend?
SHARON
[gets off the chair] What?? Randy, are you serious??
RANDY
[walks up to Sharon and hugs her] I got plane tickets and a hotel room! We leave in three hours!
SHARON
Oh my God, first you take me to Wicked and now this?
STAN
Hey wait, Dad, are you guys really going away? What about us?
RANDY
Oh don't worry. I've taken care of everything! You're staying the weekend with the Feegans!
SHELLY
Not the vegans!
STAN
No. Dad. Please don't do this!
[The Feegan home, arguably the nicest house ever shown in South Park. The Feegans are indeed vegans, eating a dinner of mushrooms, alfalfa sprouts, vegan hot dogs, and tofu. They're also something of survivalists, as they all wear life preservers]
MR. FEEGAN
It takes a lot of guts to be a vegan in today's world! You get labeled "soft" or "silly." [he must have been talking for a while, for Stan and Shelly look bored] But the truth is there isn't a need to eat animal products. Would you ever believe that hot dog was vegan?
SHELLY
Yes.
MR. FEEGAN
Cancer, heart disease, drowning, all preventable with a vegan diet and a life jacket. And if people wanna say us vegans are silly, well they can just laugh all they want, 'cause being vegan is more important than being popular!
SHELLY
Maybe you should let your son decide that for himself. [Larry is stunned and drops his fork, then looks as his parents' reactions. His parents are stunned too, but grow angry]
MR. FEEGAN
He does decide for himself! Larry's been a vegan since he was born! [Larry waves at her to keep going]
SHELLY
Maybe if Larry had a nice steak once in a while he wouldn't get beat up by every kid in school. [Larry signals for her to keep 'em coming]
MR. FEEGAN
You know that when you think you have the flu, you're actually experiencing the gastrointestinal effects of contaminated meats or eggs? Researchers have found that in meat-eating households there is more fecal bacteria in the kitchen sinks than in the toilets.
STAN
[just outside the dining room on the phone with Randy while Mr. Feegan speaks.] Dad? Dad, you have to come back. This isn't working out. [no answer] Please answer the phone Dad. [no answer. He looks around] Dad?
[Times Square, New York, night. A huge Cup Of Soup sign looms over the square, which is filled with taxis and advertisements for everything. A taxi takes Randy and Sharon around town. An original song, "Man Time," plays. First the Marshes watch "Cats." A couple behind them doesn't waste any time - the woman gives her man a blowjob during the play. Randy notices and the man puts up his left thumb. Randy approves with his right thumb. The doors open and everyone exits "Sister Act." Sharon whispers in Randy's ear and Randy brightens up, responds, and the couple goes away happily.]
COUNTRY SINGER
Man time! I need some Man Time!
I got the horses fed and the truck locked up, been workin' my fingers to the bone.
Now I need a little bit of man time, gonna see me a Broadway show!
[Next play is "Anything Goes"]
FEMALE SAILOR
Anything goes
MALE SAILOR 1

FEMALE SAILOR
Anything goes
MALE SAILOR 2

SINGERS

[Randy and Sharon are in a taxi again, and stop to see "The Jersey Boys." Then they're in a taxi and Sharon gives Randy a blowjob.]
["Jersey Boys"]
COUNTRY SINGER
I'm about to get drunk and loud, gonna have me a rowdy good time.
All I need is my girl and my truck and some Rodgers and Hammerstein!
[Next, they're holding hands at "The Phantom of the Opera"]
CHRISTINE

[Next, they're watching "Les Misérables"]
FEMALE

SINGERS

MALES

FEMALES
It's cold up here, I'm locked up here
[The Marshes are on a plane out of New York]
SINGERS
Man time!
[Randy is falling asleep, to Sharon gives him another blowjob, and he's awake and happy.]
SINGERS
Man time!
[Hooters, evening. Over curly fries and beer, Randy is sharing his trip with the group of men who were present at the aquatic center]
RANDY
Oh man! It was great! A different Broadway show every night! I'm telling you guys, New York is the place to be!
MAN 2
Sounds like a dream, bro.
RANDY
It felt like a dream, bro. Broadway is simply the greatest time a dude can have. Just kind of sucks to be back here now, you know? I mean there's no culture here. Only Broadway show in Denver is "Wicked" and I've already taken Sharon to see it twenty three times.
WORKER 1
And Wicked moves to Seattle in a couple of weeks.
PETER NELSON
It's gonna be blue balls for all of us.
STEPHEN
Wish we could live in New York where all the musicals are.
RANDY
Hey. Wait a minute. Why not bring Broadway to South Park?
BOB
Huh?
RANDY
[gets up and walks off a bit] Think about it, brah. How hard can writing a musical be? We need some musicians, some actors. We can put on our own shows right here in town.
[At a playhouse. Randy has begun rehearsals for his own musical. Onstage are the actors and a park bench]
LADY 1
[dressed in cyan]
O what a glorious Sunday. I know what I'd like to do with my time.
[walks up to man nearby]
Would you like a blowjob?
MAN 3
Yes I would like a blowjob [smiles]
BOTH
Nothing beats a blowjob on football Sunday.
LADY 1
[approaches a man on a bench] Excuse me, I'm the queen of blowjobs.
MAN 4
Really?
I would love a blowjob.
ALL
A woman should give blowjobs on football Sunday
LADY 1
I want to be covered in semen on a bed in the Hotel Jerome
[the park bench is pulled away and the actors gather around her]
A woman is prettiest covered in semen.
ALL
Give you husband a blowjob when you get home.
MAN 4
[to Lady 2, dressed in pink] And what about you, my fair lady? Could I trouble you for a quick Lewinsky?
LADY 2
Oh I don't know, kind sir. Blowjobs seem a little degrading to me.
MAN 4
Come now, a blowjob isn't with your mouth, it's with your heart.
MEN
Now get on your knees and put that heart to work!
ALL
Blowjobs, give up your blowjobs.
[concurrent]
MEN
You're guilty at blowjobs, you love giving blowjobs
WOMEN
... Blowjobs, ...blowjobs, ...blowjobs, ...blowjobs
[together]
SINGERS
So what could be better on a football Sunday? What could be better on a football Sunday?
[The Marsh house, day. Larry walks up with a daisy and knocks. Shelly opens the door and they look at each other for a few more seconds]
SHELLY
What do you want, Larry? [Larry raises the daisy up slowly, presenting it to her]
LARRY
Today, I went to 7-11 and I ate a Slim Jim. It was the greatest thing I ever tasted. Nobody ever stood up for me before. [sets the daisy on the landing, then turns around and trots off. Shelly looks on in wonder]
[The playhouse, next day. More rehearsals. Man 4's stage name is now given]
LADY 1
Oh Reginald! How about a hummer at halftime? A Super Bowl suckle from me?
REGINALD
A Super bowl hummer at halftime from my lovely blowjob queen!
BOTH
Two people in love it's amazing. Tim Tebow please don't let us down. How about a hummer at halftime-?
REPRESENTATIVE
Mr. Randy Marsh?
RANDY
And hold! [the stage falls silent] Sorry folks, we're in a hold. Just freeze right there. [to the representative] Uhh, this better be important.
REPRESENTATIVE
It is. I represent some of the biggest names in all of Broadway. They wish to speak with you.
RANDY
Really? Oh my Gaw! [to the cast] Take a break, guys. this could be it!
[Hooters, day. The messenger and Randy walk in and towards a table]
REPRESENTATIVE
Mr. Marsh, this is Andrew Lloyd Webber [eating a drumstick]
WEBBER
Helleow.
REPRESENTATIVE
Stephen Schwartz
SCHWARTZ
[gruffly] Hey bro.
REPRESENTATIVE
Mr. Elton John. [Elton John belches] and Stephen Sondheim.
SONDHEIM
Sup bro?
RANDY
Not much, sup with you guys?
SONDHEIM
No. I mean, "sup, bro!"
WEBBER
Sit down, Mr. Marsh, we need to have a talk. [Randy takes a seat]
SCHWARTZ
We got wind of your musical. Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
RANDY
Same as you guys. Trying to get men lengthier, better-quality blowjobs.
ELTON JOHN
You're making it too obvious! Women are gonna figure out what we're doin'!
SONDHEIM
Musicals are about subtext!
RANDY
My musical has lots of subtext.
SONDHEIM
"A blowjob isn't with your mouth, it's with your heart. Now get on your knees and put that heart to work."
RANDY
And then she does. It's a metaphor.
SCHWARTZ
Bro! What's metaphorical about a musical called "Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen"?!
WEBBER
Tricking bitches into hour-long blowjobs is an art form. You have to leave it to the professionals!
RANDY
[rises] Well sorry if you guys think you have a monopoly on subtext! But us up-and-comers have a voice too!
SONDHEIM
You're gonna ruin everything, you idiot!
RANDY
Sorry if my work isn't up to your standards! [rises, moving his chair aside] And now I need to get back to rehearsals. [leaves, then stops and turns around] Oh. And if "Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen" wins the Tony, don't expect to be invited to my after party. [turns around and walks out]
[The Marsh house, day. Larry walks up and knocks. Shelly opens the door and they look at each other for a few seconds. Larry now has a tiny guitar]
SHELLY
What do you want, Larry? [he begins to play her a tune]
LARRY
You make me come out of my shell, Shelly.
You give me strength where there was only fear
I ate at a Burger King today, Shelly
And stood up to a boy who called me "queer"
When you pushed me off the diving board I
...fell.
And you make the world a nicer place, Shelly
So I can come out of my... shell.
[sets the guitar on the landing, then slowly takes off his life preserver and sets it on the landing as well. He turns around and trots off again. He makes a right on the sidewalk and runs]
SHELLY
Hey! [Larry stops and looks back] Do you wanna play Settlers of Catan on Xbox? [Larry turns around]
[Back at the playhouse, Randy continues with rehearsals. The Queen carries a Broncos flag]
ACTORS
Blow--- job--- Queen!
Don't stop giving that blowjob. Even when you're tired, don't stop! Don't stop!
Shaaaaroooon!
WORKER 2
[leads the group of Randy's friends] Randy! Randy, brah!
RANDY
[to the cast] Uh, and hold. [the stage falls silent] Sorry folks, we're in a hold. [the actors are frozen in place] What is it now?
WORKER 2
Stephen Sondheim is really pissed off, Randy. He says he wants to challenge you to a bro down.
RANDY
[stunned at first, then gets angry] Fine! He wants to bro down?! I'll bro down! [leaves the table and walks up the aisle towards the exit]
WORKER 2
Randy, no! Stephen Sondheim is the greatest Broadway composer alive today! Perhaps the greatest of all time! You do NOT want to bro down with him.
RANDY
[quietly] Then what am I supposed to do?! Run?
MAN 2
Don't bro down against Sondheim, Randy! It's suicide!
RANDY
I've studied musicals! I've seen them all! I could do this! [turns] Let's bro down! [goes out the doors]
[The Marsh house, Shelly's room. This is the first time we see it.]
LARRY
Oh no, you built another settlement?
SHELLY
And I got a victory point for the most roads connecting settlements.
LARRY
[laughing merrily] Oh wow!
[The living room below. Sharon and Mrs. Feegan enjoy some tea between them]
MRS. FEEGAN
They're having such a great time together. I really wanna thank you, Sharon.
SHARON
No, no, little Larry is really making Shelly come out of her shell too.
MRS. FEEGAN
I have to admit it makes me a little nervous having Larry up there without a life preserver on, but I guess we have to take changes sometimes.
SHARON
That's what we're doing, putting our faith in Randy's new musical.
MRS. FEEGAN
That's right, I, I hear his musical is getting a lot of attention, that it really has a chance of making it.
SHARON
Oho, more than a chance. Randy's actually having a meeting right now with Stephen Sondheim.
[Hooters parking lot, at that very moment. A crowd of bros watch Randy and Sondheim face off, circling each other]
RANDY
Whassup brah?!
SONDHEIM
What brah?!
RANDY
Sup brah?!
SONDHEIM
Take a swing, brah!
RANDY
Right here, brah! [they continue circling each other]
WEBBER
Let's go, Sondheim! Wipe the street with his punk ass!
RANDY
What makes you the brauthority brah?!
SONDHEIM
West Side Story, brah!
RANDY
What brah?!
SONDHEIM
Sweeney Todd, brah!
RANDY
What brah?! What brah?!
SONDHEIM
Merrily We Rode Along, bro! Why you gotta disrespect, bro?!
RANDY
I do respect you, bro!
SONDHEIM
Show some respect, bro!
RANDY
I do respect you, bro!
SONDHEIM
Then stop disrespectin', bro!
RANDY
I respect you, bro!
SONDHEIM
Okay, I respect you too!
RANDY
Okay! [the two men stay quiet begin to relax]
SCHWARTZ
The bro down is over! Let's bro out!
SPECTATOR
Bro out!
SPECTATOR 2
Party people!
[Hooters, later. Randy sits between Webber and Sondheim. The combatants now share some beer, clinking their mugs together]
RANDY
Oh man, I'm so glad we put our differences aside! That's what bros do!
SCHWARTZ
That's what bros fuckin' do!
SONDHEIM
You're alright, Marsh. If it's cool with you, bro, Elton and Andrew and all of us wanna help you with your musical.
RANDY
Hey, really??
ELTON JOHN
Yeh. We can help youse out a li'l bit with the subtext. [checks out a waitress as she passes by - first her breasts, then her face]
WEBBER
How about instead of "Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen" we call it... "The Woman In White"
RANDY
Oh, that is beautiful!
BROS
[all approve] Yeeeeeeeah!
SONDHEIM
And a cheer to Randy Marsh. Welcome... to Bro'dway.
RANDY
Bro'dwaaay!
SONDHEIM
Wooooooooooo!
WEBBER
Woohoo!
[The Marsh house, night. Randy walks into the living room]
RANDY
Ooof. [rubs the back of his head for a moment, then walks by the sofa, where Sharon is reading a book]
SHARON
Hey hun.
RANDY
Hi babe. Sorry, I'm... [stops behind the sofa] kind of hanging out with the guys.
SHARON
Ruhur-Randy, it's fine. You do plenty with me. Did you have a good time?
RANDY
Yeah, yeah, and we really made some progress with the show. Andrew Lloyd Webber and those guys are gonna help us with it.
SHARON
Oho Randy, that's great! I'm really proud of you.
RANDY
Aw Sharon, you're the best. I'm not feeling a hundred percent; do you care if I go lay down?
SHARON
Of course not, go ahead, hun.
RANDY
[heads for the stairs] Alright babe.
SHARON
I'm just gonna wait up for Shelly.
RANDY
Okay. What's Shelly doing?
SHARON
I gave her those tickets to "Wicked." [Randy stops and looks back at Sharon] She's seeing it with her little boyfriend.
RANDY
[does a double take, then plants his hands on the bannister] She's WHAT?!
SHARON
Yeah, her and little Larry Feegan. They're going to see "Wicked" together. It's Shelly's first Broadway musical.
RANDY
OH! [runs back outside] Shelly! Hold on! [closes the door. Sharon just watches him go and smiles]
[On the road to Denver. Randy has gone back for Sharon and is driving madly down the road. He mows down a mailbox]
SHARON
Randy, slow down! Jesus Christ!
RANDY
AWWWWWWW! Why didn't you tell me Shelly was gonna see "Wicked"?!
SHARON
Why does it matter?!
RANDY
She's too young for that stuff!
SHARON
Too young?!
RANDY
This is what I get! I drank from the lie that is Broadway and now it has my daughter!
SHARON
That's it, Randy! Turn this car around right now!
RANDY
I can't!
SHARON
WHY?!
RANDY
Aww! Alright, look. There's something I should have told you a long time ago, Sharon. Broadway musicals... aren't what you think they are! They're subliminal propaganda to get women to give more blowjobs! On the outside it's all singing and dancing, but buried in it are commands to perform oral sex. It's called subtext.
SHARON
[crosses her arms and looks away] That's ridiculous! Musicals don't make me wanna give blowjobs!
RANDY
D'augh. Do you remember the night after we saw "Wicked"?
SHARON
Yes. Oh... Well, yeah, but-
RANDY
And after "Lion King" in New York? "Godspell"? "Mamma Mia"?
SHARON
Oh my gosh.
RANDY
Broadway shows' sole purpose is to make women famished for blowjobs! I'm so sorry Sharon.
SHARON
Nuh-nn No, this is crazy! Musical theater people are respected. Refined. Cultured.
RANDY
No, they're... they're bros, Sharon. Stephen Sondheim, Elton John, Andrew Lloyd Webber... They're total bros who hang out at Hooters. Sharon, I'm so sorry.
SHARON
It can't be! I've loved Broadway musicals ever since I saw "Grease" with Jacob Harrison and his brother Kip and we- [gasps and puts her hands over her heart] Oh my God!
RANDY
AAAA!
SHARON
AAAA!
RANDY
Shelly! [steps on the gas pedal, and the car goes past 60 mph]
[At the Denver Playhouse. Larry and Shelly are watching the play.]
SINGERS
No one cares about wicked people.
Now she's gone but we don't care.
And are we gonna live in peace, and all live free, you'll see.
O Heaven knows we know what goodness is
O heaven knows wicked people aren't good.
From head to toe-
[During the singing]
RANDY
[stopping by random rows] Shelly? Shelly? [he finds her and gets to her row] Shelly, come on. We have to go!
SHELLY
Dad, what are you doing here?
RANDY
Right now, Shelly! [A woman sitting by the aisle shushes him] Shelly, you are not watching this trash! Now, come on!
ELDERLY MAN
Would you mind?! I'm trying to enjoy this musical with my granddaughter!
RANDY
Oh you fucking pervert!
USHER
Alright, get the hell out of here, you! [he and another usher haul him away]
RANDY
Shelly! [the two ushers take him outside and away from the playhouse, then push him away.]
[Outside the playhouse. Randy stumbles and falls in front of Creepy City Costumes & Novelties. Sharon catches up with him]
SHARON
Randy! [Randy gets up and smashes a window open with his left elbow, then reaches in. Sharon turns away so she doesn't get hit with shards of glass, then turns back] Randy, what are you doing?!
RANDY
[bent over, putting on a costume] It's time to put an end to Broadway once and for all! [gets up dressed as Spider-Man, and puts on the mask last. He runs back into the playhouse]
[Back inside the playhouse]
THE WIZARD
While you'll do great here in the Emerald City, I'm sure you can't wait to go!
SINGERS

[During the song, a shot of Larry and Shelly is shown. Onstage a witch moves towards on stage, only to be kicked away by Randy as he swings down from the rafters]
AUDIENCE
Ohhhh.
[Randy comes back around and kicks down another actor. He then swings up into the audience and almost kicks a man in the balcony]
AUDIENCE MEMBER
Hey, it's Spider-Man
[on his way down, Randy kicks a few audience members out of their seats]
RANDY
Sorry! Sorry.
[Randy knocks out three more cast members on stage, then goes up into the rafter. He strikes a water main and knocks out the valve, releasing the water onto the stage and audience]
RANDY
Agh! [swings onto one of the side balconies, knocking out a man. Randy gets his bearings on a rail and swings back towards the orchestra pit. He knocks out the conductor and finds himself dangling from a chandelier, the cable wrapped around his right ankle. The stage lights go out and the house lights come on]
ANNOUNCER
Sorry folks, we are in a hold. We are in a hold.
AUDIENCE
Awwwwww. [And that ends that showing]
[The Marsh house, night. Shelly's in her bed, watching TV. Her bedroom door is ajar]
FIELD REPORTER
The musical came to a screeching halt as patrons flooded out the exits and water flooded the theater. [one of the actors is being led to an ambulance] The only fatality was a young boy who could not get out of the theater in time. The fire chief said it was unfortunate the child was not wearing a life preserver. [Shelly begins to sob softly]
RANDY
[looks in, then opens the door some more and enters] Shelly, I'm sorry your little friend was killed by Spider-Man tonight. Just know that... for Spider-Man to do what he did, he must have had a very good reason. Spider-Man works in mysterious ways, Shelly. And wherever he is, he loves you. [backs out and closes the door]
[The master bedroom. Sharon is already in bed and Randy slips in next to her]
RANDY
[glancing at Sharon from time to time] It's just so... wrong! For men to m- manipulate women like that! I don't care how much singing and dancing there is, a woman's mouth is sacred! Tomorrow I am calling Woman's Day magazine, and exposing the whole conspiracy! [looks at Sharon] I'm sorry, Sharon. I love you. [lies down] I shouldn't have tried to brainwash you. You have every right to be mad.
SHARON
I don't know if I can really be that mad at you for doing something every guy in America does.
RANDY
Really?
SHARON
[sits up] Oh Randy, [kneels before him. Randy sits up] the bottom line is I love going to those shows. If the fallout from that is I make you really happy for a while, well, I guess they're actually a pretty magical thing.
RANDY
[rises and kneels before her] Oh Sharon, you're the best. [they laugh and hug each other]
SHARON
So, what Broadway show do you think is coming to Denver next?
RANDY
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's worth the ticket price, because couples that pay to see it are stronger, better, and much, much happier.
ANNOUNCER
"The Book of Mormon." You'll get a blowjob.
End of Broadway Bro Down

synopsis:The 99% is ganging up on Eric Cartman.

script:1%

[South Park Elementary, day. The school has been assembled in the auditorium. Principal Victoria, Mr. Adler, and Mr. Mackey are on stage with a representative from SPUSD, or something. The image the rep stands in front of is the presidential seal, with the words "PRESIDENT'S COUNCIL ON FITNESS, SPORTS & NUTRITION" written on it]
BOARD REP
Last week the students of this school participated in the Presidential Fitness Test. I'm sad to announce that South Park Elementary scored the lowest in health and fitness in the entire country. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] On the whole, you students actually scored fine. But the President's Fitness Test is scored on a school-wide average, and one fourth grader at this school scored so low, with a terrifying body fat score, [Cartman knows the man is talking about him], and high blood pressure and the cholesterol levels of a seventy-year-old man, that it actually brought you entire school's average down to the lowest in the country. [Cartman yawns] However, the Presidential Fitness Program never wants to single out one child, because then that child might feel bad. And so as far as we're concerned, you're all a bunch of fat fuckin' pigs.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Ah, could you please use a little different terminology?
BOARD REP
Sorry. As far as the board is concerned, you're all a bunch of fat fuckin' pigs. And so it is the recommendation of this board that every week, each class will alternate turns, giving up their recesses and instead reporting to PE.
ASSEMBLY
AWWW!
[The school gym, day. Mr. Garrison's class is in PE]
COACH
Alright, fourth grade class, you're up first. We're gonna do some rope-climbin'.
STAN
God this sucks!
KYLE
Four weeks we gotta do this?
CARTMAN
Well let's just suck it up, guys. All we can try to do is have a positive attitude about it. [The other kids are not amused]
COACH
Alright McCormick, let's start with you. Climb the rope. [Kenny approaches the rope, jumps up, and starts climbing]
CARTMAN
Heheh! Look at Kenny. He's so poor, huh you guys? His family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit. [Kenny climbs down and Kyle approaches]
COACH
Alright, let's go Broflovski. [Kyle jumps on and starts climbing]
CARTMAN
Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope?
STAN
Alright Cartman, stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you!
CARTMAN
Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That's about all of us.
STAN
Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy!
CRAIG
Yeah. We're paying for your being fat.
CARTMAN
Wow, Craig. I can't believe you just went there. Here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip.
WENDY
We ARE here because of you, Eric, so just keep your mouth shut!
CARTMAN
Oh my God! Why doesn't everyone just back off?! I know how this works: You're the 99% ganging up on the 1%!
CLYDE
Oh grow up.
CARTMAN
Jesus Christ!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me!
STAN
That's what we mean by "grow up" dude! Stop being a baby!
CRAIG
Yeah, why don't you go home and cry to your stuffed animals again?! [Cartman gasps]
[Cartman's room, afternoon. Cartman is crying to his stuffed animals again. Or at least to his marketable plushies]
CARTMAN
Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl.
CLYDE FROG
But Eric, you are cool.
CARTMAN
I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault.
PETER PANDA
It's not your fault, Eric. How can they blame you for what is clearly President Obama's fault?
CARTMAN
What do you mean, Peter Panda?
PETER PANDA
You didn't make that stupid Presidential Fitness Test. Obama did.
POLLY PRISSYPANTS
Yeah, that's right Eric. You don't need to grow up. You are awesome and keeewl.
CARTMAN
Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back.
[South Park Elementary, day. Lunchtime has arrived and all the kids are in the cafeteria.]
BUTTERS
Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon.
STAN
Dude, Butters, how many times do we have to go over this? That's not Skeletor, that's a woman named Maria Shriver.
BUTTERS
Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? [the doors burst open and Cartman steps in and looks around. No one says a word]
CARTMAN
What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'—What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you! [slams a door, but it doesn't close. Cartman walks out]
BUTTERS
Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club.
JIMMY
Yeah. It's not a bad idea. If all the students unite, we can work together to fight the f-f-fit.
FIFTH GRADER
Yeah. The fifth graders agree. We're all being punished for one lazy bitch. Let's make him suffer.
JIMMY
All we need is some good old-fashioned di... di... di... diplomacy.
[President's Council on Fitness, Sports & Nutrition, Colorado Division Reigional Office, day. Jimmy and Butters are seated at a desk facing the Board rep, who's also seated]
JIMMY
Hello sir, we are here on behalf of all fourth graders at South Park Elementary.
BOARD REP
Aahh yes, the Fatty Boombalatty class. How's the extra PE treating you?
BUTTERS
Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair.
BOARD REP
What do you want me to do about it?
JIMMY
Well, sir, we believe that the 1% should be dropped from the fitness results, so that our scores can be more accurate.
BOARD REP
[rises from his chair and approaches a chart] 'Fraid that's impossible. The National Fitness Test has very specific standards. No one child can ever be made to feel singled out. We don't even like to use the term "physically fit" anymore because it can make a student feel unphysically fit, and then that student might end up feeling like a total retard.
JIMMY
...Excuse me, can you use a different terminology please?
BOARD REP
A-and then that fourth grader might end up feeling like a total retard.
BUTTERS
Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is.
JIMMY
All you're doing is making the other 99% more angry. I warn you: this could turn very ugly.
[Cartman's bedroom, day. He walks into his room, which is quite trashed. He looks around in horror, then goes back downstairs, where he spots his mom paying some bills at the table]
CARTMAN
Mom, have you been here all day?!
LIANE
No, sweetie, I've been at the hair salon. Why?
CARTMAN
Somebody's been in my room! [she looks up at him as he goes back to his room. He looks under his things to see if anything is missing. His mom appears at the door] Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?!
LIANE
Are you sure, sweetie?
CARTMAN
Am I sure?? Look at this place!
LIANE
But who would want to s-
CARTMAN
[turns around and glares at her] Don't you get it Mom?! People voted for Obama, so now that everything sucks they have to blame me! [goes back to searching his stuff and finds a watch] They didn't take my Stormtrooper watch... [finds a video game] My Arkham City game is still here... what else could they have- [looks at a corner of his room. A chair set apart for Clyde Frog is empty, but his other four dolls are arranged and seated in from of it.] Oh my God. [panicking] Clyde Frog!
LIANE
What?
CARTMAN
No. [goes to the corner and tosses his dolls aside, then looks up in despair] NOOO! [runs to his closet and looks in there. He doesn't find Clyde Frog in there] CLYDE FROG!! [stops to tell him mom] They took Clyde Frog! [runs out of his room. Liane is confused]
[Cartman's house, outside in the back yard. Cartman runs out and looks around]
CARTMAN
[calling out and walking around] Clyde Frog! Clyde!? Clyde Frog?! [stops and notices something on a tree. It is Clyde Frog, nailed to a tree through his front paws and forehead. It's ripped all over and cotton pops out of the rips. Under the frog is the word "VENGEANCE" scratched onto the tree bark in red spray paint] Clyde. CLYDE FROG! [throws up]
[Cartman's house, outside in the back yard. Cartman is holding a lavish funeral for Clyde Frog]
CARTMAN
I've known Clyde Frog since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a visionary. But most of all, Clyde Frog was the perfect friend. He never said anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat there goin' along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on you 99%ers. [Stan and Kyle are falling asleep. Kyle rests his head on his left hand] And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I'm sure you're sitting there right now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking, "I'm not getting away with this, am I?" Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies. Maybe you should just-
KYLE
Shut the hell up, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Got something to say Kyle?! [grips the sides of the podium]
KYLE
How do you murder a stuffed animal?!
CARTMAN
How do you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle! [stops himself] Butbut but but, but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a biiig investigation to come. And until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, you are all just as guilty as Kyle. Thank you so much. Bagpipes please. [a bagpipe player begins a tune. Two men lower the casket into the ground]
CARTMAN
Fly, fly little dove, to the welcome arms of Christ above. Your tears are finally gone to-
CRAIG
Where's our five dollars?
CARTMAN
Fly bu-what?
CRAIG
It said in the e-mail if we came we each got five dollars.
STAN
Yeah.
CARTMAN
[thinks a moment] Five dollars has been donated in each of your names to the Clyde Frog Foundation. Fly fly fly...
CLASS
AWWW! [all the kids get up and leave]
KID 1
Come on!
KID 2
Screw this.
KID 4
Hurry up, screw this.
CARTMAN
Oh fine, go on and leave! I'm gonna find out who did this to Clyde, and I'm gonna have your fuckin' balls! Fly to Christ.
[President's Council on Fitness, Sports & Nutrition, Colorado Division Reigional Office, day. The Board rep looks over some reports while leaning against his desk. A receptionist walks up to him]
RECEPTIONIST
Sir? Sir, do you remember the kids from that South Park Elementary School?
BOARD REP
Oh yes, the Boom Boom Chubby Choom Choom school.
RECEPTIONIST
They're all protesting outside, saying our system isn't fair to the 99% of them.
BOARD REP
[runs to the front door followed by the receptionist] Oh my Jesus! Oh, not a 99% rally.
[Outside, on a small strip of grass in a parking lot. Butters and Jimmy hold up some protest signs]
BUTTERS
I sure hope this works.
FIELD REPORTER 1
[out of nowhere] Tom, I'm reporting from the middle of a protest where two fourth grade students are fed up, and have decided to occupy Red Robin. Occupy Red Robin has been going on for several hours now, and boys, technically I am part of the 99% so, what do I have to say about all this? [no comment from either of the boys]
[Cartman's house, dining room. The lights are low. Cartman and his plushies are seated around the table, and Cartman serves himself some tea.]
CARTMAN
Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me.
PETER PANDA
Why would somebody do such a terrible thing?
POLLY PRISSYPANTS
Why would somebody hurt Clyde Frog, Eric? Especially because you are so awesome and keewl.
CARTMAN
I know that I'm awesome and keewl, Polly Prissypants, but it has little relevance at the moment to Clyde Frog's murder!
RUMPERTUMSKIN
Let's stop the charades, Eric, and let's get down to business.
CARTMAN
What do you mean, Rumpertumskin?
RUMPERTUMSKIN
We all know who fuckin' killed Clyde Frog, and she's the same dirty slut who's been fucking with us our whole lives!
LIANE
Eric, sweetie, is everything okay?
POLLY PRISSYPANTS
Does everything look okay?
PETER PANDA
Sit down, you fucking bitch.
CARTMAN
Yes, sit down, mother. We are all having a tea party.
LIANE
[takes a seat at the other end of the table] Uh sweetie, I see that you're a little... disturbed right now, but, maybe you can-
POLLY PRISSYPANTS
Shut your fat piehole, bitch!
RUMPERTUMSKIN
Yeah! You know what you did, skank! You let Clyde Frog get murdered!
LIANE
No, Rumpertumskin, I didn't. I swear.
MUSCLEMAN MARC
Then why did you write in your diary "It was probably time for Eric to grow out of his stuffed animals" anyway?!
CARTMAN
That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue.
MUSCLEMAN MARC
Well, all I'm saying, Eric, is that-
LIANE
Sweetie, you really can just talk to me if you-
MUSCLEMAN MARC
ALL I'M SAYING, ERIC, is that you went through your mom's diary for a reason!
LIANE
Eric, I promise you, I didn't do anything to your favorite toy. Whoever did this to you, I hate them as much as you do, and I'd do anything to get to the bottom of it.
CARTMAN
So then, we are all going to need some... more tea.
[Occupy Red Robin, day. Butters and Jimmy are now joined by a bongo drummer and a dancing man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask. They are surrounded by South Park's emergency services and the media, and one Java Jim's truck.]
SGT. YATES
[on the phone calling for backup] You'd better give me every cop you've got on the South Side! I don't care where ABC parks their truck, as long as it doesn't block the fire trucks! [hangs up and walks to the command center nearby] Jesus, this protest is getting out of hand! Alright, what exactly are we dealing with?
OFFICER 1
It's no good. The protest has quadrupled in size since this morning. As you can see from this aerial photograph, the protest covers almost two square miles. We have right officers here, here, and here. The media has been contained in this area. [next to Red Robin]
SGT. YATES
And where are the actual protesters?
OFFICER 1
Oh, these two people right here. [circles the spot on which Butters and Jimmy stand]
SGT. YATES
How are we gonna contain this ting?!
OFFICER 2
I'm afraid it's about to get worse. You see this area here? This is where we're setting up the stage for Bon Jovi.
SGT. YATES
Bon Jovi?
OFFICER 2
These are good cops! We can't have them standing around for hours without some entertainment! The problem is, with this area blocked by napping tents, we have no place to serve the officers beer.
SGT. YATES
Damnit! Don't these protesters know what this is all heading towards? [steps forward] Full-on class warfare.
[Cartman's room, night. He's sound asleep, snoring even, when his room begins to glow. Flames appear. Cartman begins to wake up from the heat and sits up. He sees the flames]
CARTMAN
What the hell?! [the flames set his curtains on fire. He sees them next to his bed and stands up on the bed] Mom? Mom, my room is... [turns around and sees Peter Panda and his dresser on fire] AAAH!! PETER PANDA!!
[Cartman's house, after the fire. Police and fire have come to his rescue, and a fireman comes down the ladder with the charred remains of Peter Panda]
FIREMAN 1
The fire started with this. Definitely a case of arson. Somebody hates this kid.
CARTMAN
[runs up] Don't you touch him! Leave him alone! [swats the doll out of the fireman's hands] Peter Panda!
PETER PANDA
Eh, Eric.
CARTMAN
Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay!
PETER PANDA
Eric... Remember... [sobbing] Stay... keeewl. [Eric begins bawling. The fireman picks the doll back up]
FIREMAN 2
Sorry kid, we need to take this as evidence.
CARTMAN
[on all limbs] Noohoho! Peter Panda nooo!
[Red Robin, inside. A female field reporter comments]
FEMALE REPORTER
The 99%ers movement continues to grow as more and more Americans occupy Red Robin. I asked some of the people exactly what they hoped to accomplish. [earlier] And sir, what do you hope to accomplish by this movement?
PATRON
I like the uh, A1 Peppercorn Burger. And they got ummm, bo-bottomless fries.
FEMALE REPORTER
And as the protesters inside Red Robin unite together, word is that filmmaker Michael Moore has joined the protesters outside.
[Outside]
MICHAEL MOORE
[through his bull horn] I look at the faces of you protesters and I see the future of America! We are the 99%! YESSS!!
[A house in the neighborhood. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny approach the front door. Their bikes are scattered all over the lawn. Kyle knocks on the door and a fifth grader answers it]
KYLE
Hey dude, ah are you the guys messing with Cartman's stuffed animals?
FIFTH GRADER
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't. You got any proof?
STAN
Well, just... you and your friends were the ones saying Cartman needs to suffer?
FIFTH GRADER
That doesn't prove anything. That fat little fuck is finally getting what's coming to him.
KYLE
Yeah, but dude, he seriously could have died in that fire.
FIFTH GRADER
He's in your class but you don't deal with him! So we are gonna remedy the situation! We've got big plans! Just stay out of our way and let the men handle this! [closes the door. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny turn around to leave.]
[The Black residence, night. Liane and Cartman are staying there while their own house is repaired. Liane is at a table with Tolkien's parents] drinking coffee]
LIANE
Thank you so much for allowing Eric and I to stay here.
BOB
Of course. You can't be staying in a home with that much fire damage.
LINDA
To be honest, we're just a little surprised your son begged you to stay with us. We never knew your son and our son were so close.
LIANE
I asked little Eric where he would feel safest, and he said with his friend Tolkien.
[Tolkien's room. Tolkien has a sports-car bed. Cartman is being paranoid]
CARTMAN
This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Don't worry Polly Prissypants, you're gonna be safe here. In this day and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will be alright.
TOLKIEN
Why are you involving me in this?
CARTMAN
Tolkien, please. You're the only person I can trust. Because in today's time, black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong.
[Occupy Red Robin, next day. Butters is gone for the moment, so only Jimmy stands there with his protest sign. Everyone else is still where they were]
FIELD REPORTER 2
Breaking news from the Occupy Red Robin movement. The protesters have decreased in number from two to one, as one of the protesters has apparently splintered off from the group to start a new movement: Occupy the Restroom.
[The restroom area. The first reporter is close to the mens' room]
FIELD REPORTER 1
Tom, Occupy the Restroom has been going on for almost thirty minutes now. Certainly a sign that this country is more divided than ever. These 99%ers are fed up, [backs up to the restroom door] and as a result you can clearly see this restroom is "OCCUPIED." [points to a little window that now reads "OCCUPIED." A second later, a toilet is flushed inside. The door opens and Butters exits zipping his pants up.] Uh, Tom, it looks like the movement is finished, but from the time it took, it must have been a pretty decent-sized movement.
[Occupy Red Robin. Butters returns and takes up his sign]
[The Black residence, night. Cartman has made himself at home in Tolkien's room with his dolls, chips, and Tolkien's remote control. Tolkien is not pleased and has crossed his arms]
TOLKIEN
[getting irritated] Will you stop changing channels and just pick something?
CARTMAN
What do you wanna watch, Polly Prissypants?
TOLKIEN
This is my room! I'll take the remote from you!
CARTMAN
Muh uh, 'cause I'll tell my mom on you when our parents get home.
TOLKIEN
You're a guest here! Your mom isn't in charge!
CARTMAN
Naw uh, 'cause my house got burned down, so everyone has to feel bad for me. [the alarm sounds. Cartman puts his chips aside and gathers his toys close] What is that? WHAT IS THAT?!
TOLKIEN
That's the alarm; someone's in the backyard.
CARTMAN
What?! Who?!
TOLKIEN
I don't know.
CARTMAN
I thought I was safe here! Stay there guys, I'll be right back! [Tolkien looks out his window, Cartman leaves the bedroom]
[The Black residence, back yard, night. Cartman runs outside with the bat]
CARTMAN
Who's there?! [notices Tolkien coming out behind him] Lock that door behind you, Tolkien. [then shouts at whomever might be there] Black people live here! [some flood lights come on]
TOLKIEN
A motion detector. [Kyle's shadow runs by and Cartman notices it. He gives chase and tackles Kyle]
CARTMAN
Aha! I knew it was you, Kyle!
KYLE
It's not me! I'm here to help you, fatass!
CARTMAN
Oh sure!
STAN
[walking out from behind a garage] Stop it, Cartman! It's true! We came to keep an eye out. Stephen Tamil said he had something big planned.
CARTMAN
Stephen Tamill? The fifth grader? [looks around] Oh shit! [drops the bat and runs back inside] I told you to lock that door, Tolkien! [runs up to Tolkien's room and searches for his stuffed toys] No. [sees the other four boys come in] Nononono! [grabs Kenny by the throat and shakes him] Where are they Kenny??!!
KENNY
[slaps Cartman's hand off] (I don't really know!)
CARTMAN
HAAAAGH! [runs out and closes the door, then locks it and runs off]
STAN
Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
CARTMAN
[returns] I don't trust any of you assholes! [to his dolls] Where are you sons of bitches?! [leaves]
[The fifth grader's house. Three fifth graders stand on the front lawn]
STEPHEN TAMILL
Alright guys. You ready?
CLASSMATES
Ready!
STEPHEN TAMILL
Here we GO! [he and one of his friends raise their signs, and the three of them march forth]
[Occupy Red Robin, night. The fifth graders walk up to Butters and Jimmy and stand alongside them]
BUTTERS
Hey, what are you fifth graders doing?
STEPHEN TAMILL
We are the 83%! We are tired of being punished for the fourth grade class! The fourth grade is stickin' it to the other 83% of the school!
JIMMY
Now hold on a second, fellas. If you're the 83%, then our class is only 17%.
BUTTERS
Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?
STEPHEN TAMILL
Because your class had Cartman in it, and he's the 1%!
JIMMY
But if he's 1% of 17%, then he's .17%.
[Channel 8 News]
FIELD REPORTER 3
This is it. The inevitable has happened at Occupy Red Robin. It is full-on class warfare.
FEMALE REPORTER 2
And now class warfare is breaking out. Apparently it is the fourth grade class versus the fifth grade class.
[The command center nearby. Yates and the other men are roused by the commotion]
SGT. YATES
It's here! The class warfare is finally here!
OFFICER 2
Yeeah!
[The Black residence, night. Cartman walks into the darkened kitchen]
CARTMAN
Hello?? [lightning crackles outside and floods the kitchen in light for a moment] Whoever you are, just give them back! Haven't you done enough to me?! [sees a boiling crock pot, walks up to it and removes the lid. Inside he see the third...]
CARTMAN
Muscleman Marc! AAAAAAAA!! AAAAAAAA!! [more lightning crackles as he runs out of the kitchen.]
[The Black living room. Cartman walks into it, still looking for the two remaining dolls]
CARTMAN
Polly Prissypants! Rumpertumskin! [walks towards the fireplace] Jesus Christ! [over the fireplace he sees Rumpertumskin drawn up by four chains and a bomb wrapped around his neck]
RUMPERTUMSKIN
Eric! Don't come any closer!
CARTMAN
Who did this to you?!
RUMPERTUMSKIN
You said you wouldn't let anything happen to us.
CARTMAN
Don't worry, I'll get you down!
RUMPERTUMSKIN
No Eric, don't come any- [Cartman trips a wire that sets off the bomb, decapitating Rumpertumskin]
CARTMAN
AAAAHAA! AAHAAAA! Rumpertumskin!! RUMPER [begins to cry] Rumpertumskin... WHY? Why did you do this??
POLLY PRISSYPANTS
It's okay, Eric. It's over now. [you can see Cartman actually doing her voice. He expresses shock, then turns around. Polly Prissypants is seated on an armchair with a loaded gun resting against her]
CARTMAN
Polly... Polly Prissypants... You did this?
POLLY PRISSYPANTS
Don't you see? The kids at school were right, Eric. It was time for us to grow up.
CARTMAN
...You got rid of Clyde Frog... You burned Peter Panda! [Tolkien, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny look down from the second floor]
POLLY PRISSYPANTS
Yes, they're gone. And now we can grow up and be together.
CARTMAN
They were your FRIENDS!
POLLY PRISSYPANTS
They were holding us back! All the kids making fun of you at school, saying you're not keewl! Your stuffed animals all have to be gotten rid of, don't you see?!
[At the front door. The Blacks and Liane have returned, but Mr. Black can't open the door]
BOB
Dead-bolted. Tolkien! [knocks twice, then heads for the window] Tolkien, you in there?! [the three adults look in]
[Back in the living room...]
CARTMAN
Polly Prissypants, when people find out we did all this, we're gonna get in total trouble!
POLLY PRISSYPANTS
No, I thought of everything! It all happened here so that everyone would think Tolkien did it. All the blame will be on him. And we can live happily ever after.
CARTMAN
There's one problem. [walks up to the doll, takes the gun and walks back to where he was] You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissypants. That nobody would possibly blame Tolkien for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything.
POLLY PRISSYPANTS
Oh no! You're totally right! But I thought my plan was perfect! I failed! I failed you! You have to kill me Eric! So that you don't get blamed!
CARTMAN
Noho! I've lost every stuffed animal; I won't lose you too!
POLLY PRISSYPANTS
It's the only way Eric. You have to do it. Please! I can't live with myself after what I've done. Please, you have to do it Eric.
CARTMAN
[sobs for almost a minute, then aims the gun] Goodbye, Polly Prissypants. I love you.
POLLY PRISSYPANTS
Say "hello" to the sunrise for me. [Cartman cries and looks away as he starts firing at her. First shot is straight through the forehead. He fires twice more as the four boys watch from the second floor, and three more as the Blacks and Ms. Cartman watch from outside. Polly Prissypants has four shots through the head and two more that took out chunks of her cheeks. Cartman cries, having lost the last of his stuffed dolls]
STAN
Dude, what the hell?
KYLE
We told him to grow up. So he got rid of his stuffed animals.
[Outside...]
LIANE
[apologetic] My little Eric can sometimes be a bit... dramatic. [laughs weakly]
[The Red Robin parking lot, day. A worker sweeps up all the debris from the Occupy Red Robin movement]
FIELD REPORTER 3
Occupy Red Robin is over. Class warfare has torn apart the 99% and replaced it with the 30%, the 26%, and even little brackets of 5%s here and there. What does this mean for our country? What does this mean... for me?
OFFICER 2
Hey! Get down to State Street! They're occupying Macaroni Grill!
FIELD REPORTER 3
Oh hell yeah! I'll occupy me some goat-cheese peppadew peppers! [runs off]
End of 1%

synopsis:The boys are getting close to discovering the truth about the first Thanksgiving.

script:A History Channel Thanksgiving

[South Park Elementary, day, Mr. Garrison's class. The bell rings. Mr. Garrison goes to the front of the class. On the chalkboard is written "Thanksgiving"]
MR. GARRISON
Okay children, let's all take our seats. [most of them are seated; Kyle, Tolkien, Bebe and Stan are the last four to get seated] As you all know, Thanksgiving is only two weeks away. And so the school has arranged for a lecture from a real live Native American.
BUTTERS
Oh neato, huh fellas?
GUEST
[a stout "Native American"] Hello boys and girls. My name is David Running Horse... Sawitsky, and I am one sixteenth Cherokee Indian.
CARTMAN
Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you? [Sawitsky crosses his arms and is not all all pleased]
SAWITSKY
There've been a lot of "stories" about the first Thanksgiving, and unfortunately they are mostly geared towards making the Pilgrims look good, and my people being degraded as usual. Was Thanksgiving about turkey and peace? Or was it the beginning of the genocide of an entire race?
BUTTERS
[innocently] Thanksgiving is about murder?
[Kyle's room, afternoon. The four boys are there. Stan and Kyle are reading books at Kyle's desk, Kenny is reading a couple of books on the floor, and Cartman is... on his back on Kyle's bed eating Cheesy Poofs]
CARTMAN
This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving?
KYLE
Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over.
CARTMAN
Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them.
KYLE
[looks over his shoulder angrily] Hey, fatass! Instead of laying in bed eating, why don't you come and help?!
CARTMAN
Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today.
STAN
We all have to do this report together, dude.
CARTMAN
You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.
KYLE
How is that gonna help?!
CARTMAN
[like a doorbell] Dumbass, it's November. [normally] The History Channel is probably playing Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need.
[A TV. The History Channel logo comes up.]
ANNOUNCER
You're watching The History Channel, where the truth is history.
NARRATOR
[as re-enactments play in color and in black and white] A lot has been written about the first Thanksgiving between Pilgrims and Native Americans. but what really happened at that first historic dinner?
[Cartman's house, day. The boys are on Cartman's couch watching TV]
CARTMAN
Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel?
NARRATOR
[more re-enactments] We know the first Thanksgiving was in the fall of 1621, but new evidence suggests that the first exchanging of food between the Pilgrims and Native Americans may have been visited by aliens! [dramatic flashes of darkness as the alien is shown up close, then a picture of a fetus, and then...]
DUNCAN EVERTON
[Professor of History, Oakmont H.S.] In every journal entry we researched from those early Pilgrims, not one entry mentioned anything about aliens not being there.
NARRATOR
And what about the food? [a juicy baked turkey is shown, then the previous image is shown without the alien] Does the appearance of stuffing at the first Thanksgiving suggest a kind of alien technology? [the alien reappears in the scene, but with two other aliens]
CARTMAN
Uh-huh??
KYLE
What? This isn't history.
STAN
Dude, it is called History Channel.
KENNY
(Yeah.)
CHARLES BIGGENS
[Culinary Associates of America] And if we look in all the journals and aall the history books, there is no reference to stuffing before 1621. So where did it come from? Did it come from space? We just don't know.
NARRATOR
Did ancient aliens shape the first Thanksgiving? Is it mere coincidence that Cape Cod, when viewed from space, looks like an alien life form? [an alien with an erect penis is drawn over the aerial image] What exactly did the Pilgrims experience? [colored lights move around over the ocean's horizon as Pilgrims gather by the beach] How exactly did those beings from another world shape the dinner we celebrate every November? [a tiny UFO hovers near a turkey]
KYLE
What??
CARTMAN
Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?
KYLE
We're not basing research for our report on this crap!
CARTMAN
Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? [he and Kenny raise their hands, then Stan raises his]
KYLE
[at Stan] Dude!
CARTMAN
Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? [raises Kyle's hand]
KYLE
[sighs] Alright, fine! Let's just get this stupid report over with!
[A mansion, night. A phone rings. The time on the alarm click is 2:14 a.m., and the couple in bed wake up. The man takes the phone]
THC PRESIDENT
[sits up in bed] Yes? A report from where? [sits up on the side of the bed] Does Congress know about this yet? Try to keep it contained and get the helicopters ready. I'll be there as soon as I can. [hangs up and sits back down]
WIFE
Darling?
THC PRESIDENT
They found something. This could be it. [makes a fist]
[The bus stop, day. The school bus stops and the boys get off]
CARTMAN
Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause?
STAN
...What?
CARTMAN
Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause.
KYLE
Dude, shut your fuckin' mouth!
CARTMAN
See what I mean, you guys? [a black car with tinted windows pulls up at a corner within sight of the boys and the passenger window comes down and the agents inside look at the boys]
AGENT 1
[brunet] Is that them?
AGENT 2
[blond] That's them.
[An interrogation room, somewhere. The boys are seated and waiting for someone. Three men walk in - the two agents and the man from the mansion. The agents close the door and the man from the mansion goes to the table and takes his seat opposite the boys. He leafs through the boys' report, and the boys look at each other]
THC PRESIDENT
You boys have been very busy... [he closes the report] We need to know everything that you know.
STAN
'bout what?
THC PRESIDENT
Have you been contacted by alien life forms?
AGENT 1
Did you come across some kind of ship or something?
KYLE
Dude, look, we, we just saw all this stuff on History Channel.
THC PRESIDENT
[silence for a few seconds, then] We are The History Channel. [rises from his chair] For years we've been collecting information on Thanksgiving. We're getting close to the truth. And now you boys have exactly the same information. It can't be coincidence.
KYLE
We saw it on your channel.
THC PRESIDENT
What exactly did you seez?!
STAN
That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology?
THC PRESIDENT
My God. Would you be willing to say that on camera for an interview?
[Butters' house, living room. He's watching a Jonas Brothers video]
STEVEN
Alright, Butters, that's enough MTV for one day. You need to watch something that stimulates your brain. I'm putting on History Channel.
BUTTERS
Okay Dad.
ANNOUNCER
You're watching the History Channel, the only network dedicated to history. Coming up next, it's Monster Quest! Larrh! Followed by Hairy Bikers. Errh! But now, back to Part 3 of Ancient Aliens at Thanksgiving.
NARRATOR
It has become a widely accepted fact that Thanksgiving was a meal attended by Pilgrims, Native Americans, and alien beings.
STAN MARSH
[history expert] Stuffing wasn't mentioned anywhere until 1621? And it might have been... alien technology?
NARRATOR
And while the number of people who accept the alien theory continues to grow, some experts have stepped forward with a wildly different view altogether. Could it be that Pilgrims were actually aliens themselves?
KYLE BROFLOVSKI
[Ph. D., Professor of Thanksgiving - DeVry Institute] Of course you can't prove there were no aliens at the first Thanksgiving! Just like you can't "prove" that... the Pilgrims themselves weren't alien! Can you prove that?! Here: draw that Thanksgiving turkey symbol with your hand! Maybe that symbol matches... galaxies in space or something! OooOoOoOooOOO! [moves his hands around]
NARRATOR
[a scene of alien families sharing Thanksgiving on Earth] Could it be that the Pilgrims we've read about all these years actually came from another planet? History experts like Kyle Broflovski say "yes."
KYLE
You might as well just say Pilgrims and Indians were all aliens who came here and made some kind of intergalactic treaty!
[Kyle's house, living room. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are on the sofa watching the same special Butters is]
STAN
Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV. [smiles]
KYLE
How can they make a show out of this? I wasn't even agreeing with them. [a knock is heard at the front door and Kyle goes to answer it]
SAWITSKY
What are you doing?!
KYLE
...Uh oh.
SAWITSKY
The first Thanksgiving was a space treaty?! Native Americans are aliens?!
KYLE
I was just explaining how a negative argument doesn't make a po-
SAWITSKY
Haven't my people been through enough?! [whips out a gun with his left hand and quickly aims at at Kyle] Goddamn you!
KYLE
Ack dude! [backs up as Sawitzky walks towards him]
SAWITSKY
The white man is gonna PAY for his lies! [stops in front of Stan and Kenny, keeping his gun aimed at Kyle]
[In the sky, black Army helicopters approach. In one of them, the History Channel and two agents sit]
AGENT 2
Look at this, sir! [hands him a picture] An aerial photograph of Cape Cod where the Pilgrims landed in 1620. [puts his right hand on it and traces a turkey on the photo with it] Five Pilgrim settlements, with Plymouth Rock here. [puts a dot on the location] The same symbols appear everywhere in history. [on a baked turkey, in the night sky...]
AGENT 1
The symbology lines up to mirrored points in space. If Kyle Broflovski is right, then Plymouth Rock is some kind of wormhole.
THC PRESIDENT
Pilgrims and Indians were the aliens! How did we not think of it?!
AGENT 3
Sometimes it takes the innocence of a child to make us see the most simple things.
AGENT 2
True dat.
THC PRESIDENT
True dat.
[Plymouth, Massachusetts. day. The monument to Plymouth Rock is shown. The helicopters show up and descend onto the park near the monument. Plymouth Rock itself is shown in the water, unprotected.]
THC PRESIDENT
Get all those tourists out of here! We need this place secured!
AGENT 4
[through his bullhorn] Alight people, let's clear out! We need you ALL to disperse! [a woman and her daughter stop to listen] This area is under quarantine. [the woman and daughter leave]
THC PRESIDENT
Give me a piece of chalk. [agent 1 hands it to him. The president quickly traces a turkey on the rock, then backs up.] Huh... Nothing.
AGENT 5
Guess Kyle Broflovski was wrong.
THC PRESIDENT
Well, at least we weren't outsmarted by a nine-year-old kid. [they all turn and walk out of the water] We should've known. Pilgrims couldn't be from space.
[Space, the final frontier. A Pilgrim shoots through space in a wormhole and hits the planet hard. Electricity crackles through some power lines. A shadow climbs out of the impact crater. It's... a Pilgrim. Nearby, a truck rolls by, driven by Natalie Portman. The Pilgrim runs from the crater and into Portman's path; she rolls over him, then stops.]
[The History Channel learns of this and sends its top men out to investigate. Several tents go up at the crash site]
AGENT 6
Here. You can see it right there. An object clearly fell from the sky and struck the Earth.
THC PRESIDENT
What is it?
AGENT 6
It's a Pilgrim, sir. [the president is stunned, looks outside, then walks outside with five other men]
THC PRESIDENT
So then, Professor Broflovski was right after all. [the camera pans up into the sky. Another camera travels through space]
NARRATOR
Not long ago, it was an accepted fact that civilizations on Earth shared the universe with beings from other planets. [the camera approaches a rock formation that has golden (literally) ears of corn sticking out of it. The camera then goes around the formation and through a thick cloud layer] These alien beings visited our world, and once, even settled it, from deep within the galaxy Canis Major, and a distant planet called... Plymouth. [the camera pops up and sees a magnificent building from which rise four massive golden ears of corn. An entrance with 14 colossal Pilgrim statues is shown. Inside the cathedral-like building a Pilgrim king, seated on a throne flanked by two huge golden cornucopias overflowing with gold and jewels, speaks to a huge crowd]
PILGRIM KING
Fellow Pilgrims! The great Captain hath gone missing and thine enemies have attacked our stuffing mines! We must prepare for war with the Indians!
[Another planet, named Indi. The Indian chief there speaks to his people]
INDIAN CHIEF
Now it is OUR time! We shall attack Plymouth, and we will take... ALL THEIR STUFFING! [the Indians cheer]
[Cartman's house, day. Liane is at the kitchen cutting up construction paper. Cartman runs through the dining room, then returns and enters the kitchen]
CARTMAN
Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner?
LIANE
What hon?
CARTMAN
Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving!
LIANE
Uhoh, Thanksgiving's still a couple of weeks away, sweetie. I haven't gone shoppies yet.
CARTMAN
Oh no. Oh NO!
LIANE
What is it, hon?
CARTMAN
Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We've gotta go to the store! [turns around and leaves the kitchen]
[The supermarket, day. A woman is taking her groceries to her car. Cartman runs into the the chapping cart and knocks it over, spilling the woman's groceries. Cartman then turns and runs into the store. Liane folows him in. Cartman finds a worker]
CARTMAN
You guys have stuffing?!
ATTENDANT 1
Stuffing? Sure. Aisle 17.
CARTMAN
Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come! [Liane takes a shopping cart and follows Cartman to the right aisle. Cartman looks for the stuffing, but doesn't fine any. The attendant walks by] Hey! Where is it!
ATTENDANT 1
It's right there, right on the uh... [sees that the stuffing shelf is empty] wait, that can't be right. Hey, hey Chet. What happened to all the stuffing?
CHET
[walks up] What are you talking about? [sees that there is no stuffing, and his jaw drops a bit]
ATTENDANT 1
We got more in the back, right?
CHET
I just did inventory in the back, it... it was all put out here!
ATTENDANT 1
You mean it's two weeks until Thanksgiving and we're completely out of stuffing?!
CHET
Oh no!
CARTMAN
No!
CHET
No!
CARTMAN
NOOOO!
[Planet Plymouth, day. An Indian delegation and a Pilgrim delegation meet up]
PILGRIM KING
You dare come to Plymouth, ambassador?! After attacking our stuffing mines?!
INDIAN CHIEF
The stuffing mines were never yours!
PILGRIM KING
Wihtout control of the mines we cannot supply stuffing to the mortals, ambassador! This will be war!
INDIAN CHIEF
You are in no position to declare war! Your lead commander is nowhere to be found!
PILGRIM KING
And how knoweth you that?!
INDIAN CHIEF
Word travels fast in our sector.
PILGRIM KING
I do not give free bowls of stuffing, what sayest you?! We will take back control of the stuffing mines! [turns and leaves with his men]
INDIAN CHIEF
Then the Thanksgiving treaty will be off! [turns and leaves with his men]
PILGRIM KING
And I pray to stuffing that you are wrong. [looks up to the sky as his men move on without him] Where are you, Miles Standish?
[Kyle's living room, later. Sawitzky is still lecturing the boys on Native American history]
SAWITZKY
And furthermore, everything Kyle Broflovski said about Native Americans being from outer space was untrue! Native Americans were brutalized, and David Sawitzky's ancestors deserve an apology! It was wrong to mix aliens and real history!
STAN
I don't know, dude. Have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to Mars?
KYLE
[through gritted teeth] Dude, there's a guy with a gun here!
STAN
I'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked.
KENNY
(Yeah, that's true.)
KYLE
Would you guys stop?!
SAWITSKY
Just keep writing your apology! [paces. The front door opens and Miles Standish jumps in dramatically]
MILES
How now, Indian?! Why hast thy race sent me here to Earth?!
SAWITSKY
[surprised] Huh? [Miles runs at him and throws him up against a wall] Ack.
STAN
Dude!
MILES
You Indians took me to thy planet, and then cast me here! Why?! [punches Sawitzky twice. Sawitzky falls to the floor and Miles begins kicking him in the balls]
KENNY
(Go, dude!)
STAN
Yeah, go on dude!
KENNY
(Woohoo!)
MILES
[turns Sawitzky over and picks him up] Hast thy race attacked our stuffing mines and sent me here to die?! Tell me, Indian!
SAWITZKY
I I uh I'm only one sixteenth.
MILES
Hold your lying tongue! [puts a glowing ball into Sawitzky's mouth] This shall prove if thou art Indian or not! [Sawitzky begins to tremble and moan, then he's surrounded by a purple light and consumed] Ah, he was not.
STAN
I didn't think so.
MILES
[walks up to Kyle and genuflects] I have been told of your expertise, Kyle of DeVry Institute. I need your wisdom to get back to my planet.
[Kyle's house, outside. Miles, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny go to a waiting truck]
MILES
Into the wheeled chariot that strucketh me! [the boys get in] We must make haste to Cape Cod! [then he does]
STAN
[looking at the driver] Who's this?
MILES
This is Natalie.
NATALIE
Hi guys.
[Cape Cod, night. THC continues camping out there.]
AGENT 7
Alright, sir. We got some more information on the Pilgrim who crashed to Earth. Thirty seconds after impact the Pilgrim was hit by a truck and then put into the back seat.
THC PRESIDENT
Who did the truck belong to?
AGENT 6
We believe it belonged to Natalie Portman, sir.
THC PRESIDENT
The actress? That doesn't make sense.
AGENT 8
It gets worse. All over the country people are reporting a shortage of stuffing. We don't think it's coincidence.
THC PRESIDENT
You're telling me that somehow during a stuffing shortage, this "Pilgrim" dropped down from space and got into a truck driven by Natalie Portman?!
AGENT 9
Look, if anyone knows about stuffing, it's Natalie Portman!
THC PRESIDENT
[walking forward, filling the screen] We have to find Professor Broflovski. He was right about all of this. He'll know what to do.
[A campsite for the night. Kyle sits alone by the campfire, and the trailer-truck is behind him. Inside the trailer, Miles talks to the others]
MILES
We shall make camp here for the night. On the morrow perhaps we can reach Cape Cod. And Thanksgiving may yet be saved. [looks outside and sees Kyle] What is wrong with Kyle of DeVry Institute?
STAN
Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing.
MILES
[studying Kyle some more] He seems almost like a Puritan lady whose period hath stopped. [moments later, he goes outside to talk to Kyle] I fear, Kyle, that you still do not know whose side to be on.
KYLE
No, ah I don't.
MILES
It must have been very difficult for you, being the one on your planet with his wild theories that Pilgrims and Indians were not of this world.
KYLE
I actually only just said that sarcastically.
MILES
HA! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! [pats him on the left shoulder a few times] Then you are only just a remarkably gifted child! [puts his right hand over Kyle's left hand, then withdraws it to pull out a map] Here, let me show you. Your planet is one of the five. [points to the others] Plymouth, Indi, Colthenheim, and this planet over here nobody really cares about. [spreads his right hand over the map so each fingertip touches a planet, then traces the hand with a pencil] The five are connected by a series of wormholes. [the trace is finished] My people came to your world, and so did our enemies. But we made a treaty, and for 300 years our people have not fought. But now, the treaty is over.
KYLE
But I always read that Native Americans were here, and that Pilgrims and other settlers kind of took their lands from them.
MILES
You can't believe what everyone tells you, Kyle. You have to open your eyes. [stands up and puts down his map on his seat. Natalie, Stan, and Kenny look on from the trailer] Soon your wisdom will open the wormhole back to Plymouth, and the stuffing mines can again be ours, for he who controls the stuffing, controls the universe. [all of a sudden, a night sun focuses on him and a helicopter is heard]
A PILOT
Hold it right there! [five black cars pull up quickly and surround Miles and Kyle. Natalie, Stan and Kyle leave the trailer]
AGENT 10
We found Professor Broflovski! He is with the Pilgrim! [the agents close in on Miles and he unsheathes his sword]
MILES
Stay back, all of you! For I will get to Cape Cod and cannot be stopped! Come boys! Let us fight to the death!
THC PRESIDENT
[rushes into the middle] Wait! Stop, stop! Please, Mr. Standish, we are all on the same side here. We know why there's a stuffing shortage. We've been trying to get the wormhole open.
MILES
I trust none but them! [points to the party he came with - Natalie, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny] Indians hath betrayed us! I must return to Plymouth so my king can know the truth! [hurries away]
THC PRESIDENT
PLEASE! [stops him] We're the History Channel. We care as much about the truth as you do.
MILES
Then get us to Cape Cod as soon as possible!
[Planet Plymouth. The king of Plymouth sits on his throne looking board]
PILGRIM
[shot through with several arrows] My Lord! My Lord, the battle is lost! We have tried to stop the Indians on their home planet, but yea they are too strong!
PILGRIM KING
Then our last chance for survival is gone?
PILGRIM
I'm sorry my Lord. All Pilgrim forces sent to the Indians' planet have been wiped out.
PILGRIM KING
And so soon the Indians will be here. Sound the corn horn! We must abandon Plymouth!
[The Indians and Pilgrims do battle on Indi]
INDIAN CHIEF
The stuffing mines are ours! [some Indians celebrate at the mines]
[Cape Cod, day. A wooden pathway has been built to Plymouth Rock and surrounds it. Miles uses a blown up version of his map to show the History Channel what's going on.]
MILES
Earth is connected to Plymouth by this wormhole here. Once I get back I will assemble my people to attack Indi, and gain control of the stuffing mines. If all goes as planned, you will all have stuffing in time for Thanksgiving.
THC PRESIDENT
But Mr. Standish, I'm afraid it's not that simple. We... tried to get the wormhole open with this symbol and it didn't work.
MILES
Ah ha ha ha! Of course not! You have the correct symbol, but you are missing the keeper of the portal.
AGENT 11
The keeper of the... of course! Natalie Portman!
THC PRESIDENT
We were wondering what she had to do with all this! Natalie Portman controls the wormhole!
AGENT 12
Our window of opportunity is closing, sir! The wormhole has to be opened now!
THC PRESIDENT
Alright Ms. Portman, we need you to open your wormhole.
NATALIE
[rolls her eyes and moves her torso to the left, then to the right, then to the left] Mmmmmmmmmm. No.
THC PRESIDENT
Please, Ms. Portman, you've got to open your wormhole right now!
NATALIE
[rolls her eyes and moves her torso to the right, then to the left] Mmmmmmm. [then to the right] Uh uh.
THC PRESIDENT
Curses and cranberries! I must get to Plymouth now! Do as they say!
NATALIE
[rolls her eyes and moves her torso to the left, then to the right, then to the left] Mmmmmmmmmm. No.
THC PRESIDENT
There has to be a way to get the portal open! Where's our expert?! [everyone moves aside to reveal Kyle] What do we do, Professor Broflovski?
KYLE
I'm not a professor.
THC PRESIDENT
The History Channel said you were!
KYLE
You are the fucking History Channel!
MILES
[walks up to Kyle and genuflects] Please, Kyle of DeVry Institute. There is no more time for squabbles. The universe is at stake!
THC PRESIDENT
[walks up to Kyle and genuflects] You knew everything else. You somehow knew about all of this. You knew it... here. [points to Kyle's heart.] You must know... how to get Natalie Portman to open her wormhole.
[A local restaurant nearby. Nice, upscale, with a string trio playing during dinner. Kyle is in his suit, Natalie is in a different dress]
KYLE
So, do you uh, do you have any brothers or sisters, Natalie?
NATALIE
I had a lot of really close friends growing up, but not any brothers and sisters; I was an only child.
KYLE
[having trouble with small talk] Wow, awesome. Um...
NATALIE
I have dual citizenship in the United States and Israel. [a waiter with a bottle of wine walks by and Kyle snaps his fingers twice, then indicates to the waiter that Natalie should get some more wine. The waiter serves it] Oh thanks.
KYLE
Um... so... [behind him, everyone involved in the portal matter is watching them] So dual citizenship, wow, uh... You know that I, I never knew anyone that had that.
NATALIE
Well, I went to Harvard while I was acting. I got a BA. But I did classes at the University of Jerusalem too.
KYLE
Cool. Cool... You wanna order some dessert?
[Cape Cod, night. Kyle and Natalie walk down to Plymouth Rock]
NATALIE
Thanks, that was a lot of fun.
KYLE
Yeah, it was cool, thanks. [looks over his shoulder. Miles motions at him to continue] Um, so... Is there any way you'd
NATALIE
What?
KYLE
You know, could youuu...
NATALIE
What?
KYLE
Would you please just open your wormhole?!
NATALIE
[rolls her eyes and moves her torso to the right, then to the left] Oh. [moves her torso to the right, then to the left] Mmmm... [moves her torso to the right] no.
KYLE
[sighs in exasperation] Errh!
NATALIE
[rolls her eyes and moves her torso to the left, then to the right, then to the left] Mmmmmmmmmm. Okay.
MILES
Yes!
THC PRESIDENT
Alright, let's go, folks! [he and several other men go towards Plymouth Rock]
NATALIE
Just for a sec though. [turns around and joins them]
MILES
Thank you, Kyle of DeVry Institute. Now the Indians can be stopped and Thanksgiving will be saved!
KYLE
Yeeah, you're welcome. I'm sorry I doubted you. And guys, I'm I'm sorry I acted like a know-it-all. [behind the rock, Natalie's legs go up in the air]
STAN
It's cool dude, we understand.
KYLE
I guess we should all realize... [the portal is activated] that history and alien technology really do go hand in hand. [the portal shoots out into space towards planet Plymouth]
MILES
[rises with his sword unsheathed] Now make way, children! For I have a war to fight! [runs towards the rock, jumps on it, and into the portal stream] For stuffing!! [goes towards planet Plymouth]
[The stuffing mines. The battle continues]
INDIAN CHIEF
Take ALL their stuffing!
PILGRIM
The treaty ends now! [the Indians retreat as flying galleons sweep over the stuffing mines with powerful rays, destroying any Indians along the way]
NARRATOR
With the wormhole once again open, Miles Standish was finally able to command a Pilgrim army.
MILES
Now attack their left flank! Good! They're retreating! Hit them with the anti-Indian device! [A destroyer walks in and obliterates all the Indians with its powerful beams]
NARRATOR
The Pilgrims fought off the Indians, making stuffing once again available on all our Thanksgiving tables.
[Cartman's living room. The four boys are watching The History Channel once again, Stan and Kenny are watching the TV, Cartman is eating Cheesy Poofs, and Kyle looks on in annoyance.]
RANDOM VOICES
Yea. Stuffing mines. Yea.
NARRATOR
And now you know the true story behind Thanksgiving.
STAN
Wow, there's a lot about Thanksgiving I never knew before.
CARTMAN
Yeah, History Channel rules.
NARRATOR
But was the first Thanksgiving really just about Pilgrims and Indians from space? Or was there something more? Shocking new evidence suggests that the first Thanksgiving might also have been... [an image of a woman appears against a wall] haunted!
DONALD T. BROWN
[Ph. D., University of Phoenix] There is certainly no evidence that the first Thanksgiving dinner was not haunted.
NARRATOR
The Pilgrims welcomed the Indians, but did they also unknowingly welcome spirits from beyond the grave? [ghostly figures appear here and there.]
CARTMAN
[curious] Ohhh??
KYLE
[throws up his arms in exasperation] Oh, come on!!
End of A History Channel Thanksgiving


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Kenny ends up in the foster care system after his parents are arrested.

script:The Poor Kid

[The McCormick house, living room. Stuart and Kevin are fighting as Carol tries to stop them while holding a crying Karen on one arm. Kenny's on the sofa watching TV, ignoring all the drama around him.]
STUART
You think you're man enough to fight me, you little shit?!
KEVIN
Yes, 'cause you're a drunk piece of shit, Dad!
CAROL
You're both drunk pieces of shit! Both of you sit the fuck down!
KEVIN
Shut up!
[Kenny's watching a show that will have an unexpected twist. Right in front of the TV is an empty can of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer. Random images of white trash culture pop up. The first one is a trailer with an awning]
ANNOUNCER
They're noisy.
MAN 1
Fuck you, bitch! [runs out of the trailer]
WOMAN 1
[throws an unlabeled crumpled empty bottle at him] You son of a bitch! [the man turns around and walks back to the trailer to hit her]
[Next is a backyard fight between two women. A blonde is pouring a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer on a redhead while three men watch in the background]
ANNOUNCER
They're nasty.
WOMAN 2
[the redhead] You done spilled that on my titties, skank! [takes the can from the blonde and shoves her off her feet, then finishes off the beer]
WOMAN 3
Oww...
ANNOUNCER
They're white trash. And when you give them a little Pabst Blue Ribbon [an image of the beer bottle fills the screen], they can't help getting arrested. [Kevin picks up a block and throws it at Stuart, hitting him on the forehead. Onscreen, police break up a fight among several men] Tonight, on an all-new... White Trash... In Trouble!
[A narrator appears on screen, wearing a beige overcoat, standing in a graffiti-riddled set]
NARRATOR
Pabst Blue Ribbon and white trash. It's a deadly combination that can lead to prison time and children being taken away from their home. This white trash home in Colorado seems innocent enough. [The McCormick home is shown]
KENNY
[sits up upon recognizing the house] (Hmmm. What the fuck?) [goes to see what's going on. Stuart and Kevin continue to fight, and Carol tries to intervene, only to have Stuart slap her.]
NARRATOR
But the children in this home live in a world of neglect. There's no heating, no groceries, [a spotlight pans around the back yard] and if you look closely in the backyard, you can even make out what appears to be a meth lab. [a red arrow points to a small shed against the house which does indeed have a meth lab in it. Kenny looks out a window next to the back door.]
KENNY
[runs back to warn his parents] (Mom, the cops are here! Mom, Dad, the cops are here!) [Kevin has gotten on Stuart's back and is choking him. At the front door, police make use of a battering ram to get into the house. They all rush in and surround the family]
COPS
Down on the ground! Move it! Let's go! Move move! Get down, now! [The parents get on their knees and put their hands behind their heads. Ten officers end up in the living room with guns drawn. There are twice as many officers outside.]
[The McCormick house, outside, night. The parents have been arrested and are escorted out by police. The kids walk out freely]
CAROL
No! Muh babies! Don't take my babies!
STUART
[taken to one car] You're hurting my arm!
CAROL
[taken to another] My babies!
STUART
You're hurting me!
OFFICER 1
You have the right to remain silent. Now please look at the camera and say "I'm white trash and I'm in trouble."
STUART
I'm white trash and I'm in trouble. ["IN TROUBLE" is stamped on the screen right away. This happens after every admission of "I'm white trash and I'm in trouble."]
OFFICER 1
Alright, good. Now get in the car! [Stuart gets in. A crowd gathers to view this scene]
CARTMAN
[filming with his phone] Oh wow, poor people being arrested. What a rare occurrence. [chuckles and waves with his left hand] Hi, Kenny! Kenny, wave! [to his phone] That's Kenny, about to be sent to a foster home. Pretty funny.
OFFICER 2
Just have a seat in there, kids. [puts the kids into the back seat]
KEVIN
[still drunk, but mocking] Just have a seat in there, kids. [the cop closes the door]
[Park County Police Station, later.]
OFFICER 1
The mother and father will probably be released from jail on Monday, but I guess the kids are gonna be taken away for good. Child Protective Services is about to talk to them in the soft room.
OFFICER 3
The soft room?
OFFICER 1
You know, the room we have set aside for kids to feel safe in.
[The soft room. It's a room with large pictures of friendly-faced clowns on all four walls. Against the walls are toys and games for small kids to enjoy as they wait. The McCormick kids sit on a sofa, looking around the room scared at the clown pictures. The door opens and a heavy-set man walks in.]
MR. ADAMS
Hi kids, how you doin'? My name's Mr. Adams and I just need to get some info from you. Does that sound okay?
KAREN
[scared, sniffling, she holds on to Kenny] Can I see my mommy?
MR. ADAMS
No, sorry. Now, [opens a folder] I've been looking over your file and I see you kids have all been horribly physically and emotionally abused. [the kids look at him in astonishment] Oh whoops, that isn't your case file, it's the Penn State University Gazette. [laughs] I'm joking, that's just a joke, we like to have fun here. [closes the folder and shows it to the kids] It is your case file. I was just all like "it's the Penn State Gazette" to be like a joke, we have fun. Now listen, you're gonna be put into a foster home, so I need to know... would you like to go to Neverland Ranch, a Catholic church, or Penn State University? [laughs at his own joke] We're havin' fun here, aren't we? I just, I come up with these and the guys, it's good to laugh. [goes to the door and yells into the hall] I just asked them if they wanted to go to Neverland, a Catholic church, or Penn State. [closes the door and returns to his chair] I'm a trickster. People say I'm really meant for comedy. Here's my head shot just in case you know anybody. [shows his picture, then hands out copies to the kids] Can't hurt, right? Okay, now, are we all startin' to feel a little bit better? [Karen cries] Oh come on now, how about that smile? I'm gonna GET [holds out his right palm] you to smile! I'm gonna GET [holds out his right palm again] you to smile! [silence] A Penn State administrator walks into a bar. Where's that smile? How about this one? Joe Paterno doesn't walk into a police station. Come on, that's a good one.
[South Park Elementary, day. The kids are in the hallway. Stan walks over to Kyle]
STAN
Did you hear anything more about what happened?
KYLE
Dude, I don't think Kenny's coming back. My dad said those Child Protective Services people are pretty serious.
STAN
We can't let Kenny be sent away forever. There's gotta be something we can do.
CARTMAN
[runs up to the other two with a memo pad] Guys! Guys! I've been workin' on it, and I think I have some answers.
STAN
Really?
CARTMAN
Yeah. I've gone through every student in the school, and I'm pretty sure now that Kenny's gone, the poor kid is Craig!
KYLE
That's what you care about?! Who's the poorest kid in school now?!
CARTMAN
Pretty much went through everybody. Craig's got the mo- [noticing Craig coming into view] sh, sh sh sh sh. Here he comes, here he comes. [as Craig passes by] Heya, Craig, your uh... your family get you that jacket at Walmart or Kmart? [stifles a laugh]
CRAIG
What are you talking about?
CARTMAN
Nothing dude, it's cool, it's cool. I mean, we would tell your parents to shop at nicer places, but... your mom is so poor she can't even pay attention. [stifles a laugh]
[A rundown two-story house somewhere, day. Two police officers arrive with the McCormick kids at their new home, A man answers the door as his wife stands some distance away from it.]
OFFICER 2
Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead, we have the new foster kids for your care. [the kids enter]
MR. WEATHERHEAD
Very good, we'll take them from here. Children, enter. [the kids walk in further, the cops leave, Mr. Weatherhead closes the door, and Mrs. Weatherhead's face gets stern] Welcome to your new home. Before we show you around let's get one thing clear: this is a very strict religious household! As long as you live here you will be agnostic! [leads the children to a group of nine other kids] These are your foster brothers and sisters! They are all strict agnostics! David, do you believe in God?!
DAVID
[blond boy with glasses] I don't know...
MR. WEATHERHEAD
Right! There are two bedrooms upstairs! Boys' room and girls' room! Your chores are listed on their respective doors! Follow! [guides them into the kitchen] You will eat only at designated meal times! Beverages you may take from the refrigerator as you like! However, in this house you will drink only agnostic beverages! [opens the refrigerator door to reveal the contents] Dr Pep-er, and Diet Dr Pep-er! [takes out a can and shows it to the kids] Because what flavor is it?! It is neither root beer nor cola! Nobody is sure what flavor it is, and nobody can be sure! Isn't that right, Melissa?!
MELISSA
[ginger girl] I don't know.
MR. WEATHERHEAD
Good!
[South Park Elementary Computer Lab, day. Butters is doing research for Cartman as Cartman watches.]
CARTMAN
This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!
BUTTERS
Yep. To find out who the poorest kid is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch.
CARTMAN
Eh yeah?
BUTTERS
So then I cross-referenced all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.
CARTMAN
[laughs] Heh heh, yeah?
BUTTERS
Well actually, Eric, it's you. [Cartman keeps his smile for a few seconds more, then frowns.]
CARTMAN
What?
BUTTERS
Now that Kenny's gone, [points to Cartman] your household actually has the lowest income. [Cartman is stunned, then dejected. Butters consoles him] I'm sorry, pal.
CARTMAN
[hops off his chair and moves off a bit, then gets a panicked look] Oh my God... If we found this out it's only a matter of time before everybody else does.
BUTTERS
Uh, I won't tell anybody.
CARTMAN
[turns around and glares at Butters] Oh come on! We're not the only ones who wanted to look into this! You think, you think Kyle isn't on the computer right now tryin' to see who the poorest kid in school is?! Oh he is gonna have such a field day, that heartless Jew! [makes a fist, then crosses his arms] Well I won't give him the satisfaction!
[South Park Elementary, hallway. Bill and Red are chatting, Lola talks to Bebe. As the kids mill around, Cartman comes around the corner and moves from person to person as he speaks.]
CARTMAN
Alright, let's hear it for Kyle! [claps] He's so funny, isn't he guys?! With all his jokes about Cartman being poor. You guys hear how poor Cartman's mom is?! His mom is so poor the ducks throw bread at her! Hahaha! Yeah, that's super funny, guys! [Stan and Kyle turn from their lockers to look at him] Laugh it up, everyone! [ends up by Stan and Kyle] Cartman's mom is so poor that when she goes to KFC, she has to lick other people's fingers! HA! I beat you to it, Kyel!
KYLE
[slowly so that there's no mistake] My name. Is not. "Kyel".
CARTMAN
That's kewl! Whatever Kyel! Must be nice having everything you want! [runs away]
[The Cartman residence, the same day. Liane enters the living room with groceries and sees her son on the armchair.]
LIANE
Hi, sweetie.
CARTMAN
[sighs] Sit down Mom, we need to have a talk.
LIANE
[sets the groceries on the floor] Oh, what is it this time? [sits down on the sofa]
CARTMAN
Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?
LIANE
What, hon?
CARTMAN
You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing with your time?!
LIANE
Eric, I'm working two jobs. Mommy's doing everything she can.
CARTMAN
Yeah, see, the problem, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kid in skewl!
LIANE
Well, we're in a tough economy, Eric. I don't know what else you want me to do about it.
CARTMAN
[trying to get this straight] We're in a tough economy. You don't know what else I want you to do about it. Life isn't handed to you, Mom! You can't just sit on your ass and expect some money to appear!
LIANE
Eric, we aren't that much poorer than most people.
CARTMAN
Not much huh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she thought she was running out of food stamps!
LIANE
Oh. [laughs]
CARTMAN
IT'S NOT FUNNY, MOM!! [runs off]
[Cartman's room, night. Cartman is on his bed crying]
CARTMAN
My mom is so poor she waves around a Popsicle and calls it air conditioning. I wish I could be put in a kewl foster home like Kenny's familyyy.
[The Weatherhead house, night. There are cows everywhere and no pavement on the sidewalk or path to the house. In the girls' room there are six girls, and one of them is crying while the others sleep. It's Karen. A shadow comes over her and she stops crying when she notices. She gets on her knees in bed]
KAREN
Huh? [calms down] Oh, it's you. [smiles. In the window is Mysterion!] I was wondering when you'd appear. You always come when I'm sad.
MYSTERION
You are going to be okay, Karen! You have to keep believing that!
KAREN
Why did my mommy and daddy go to jail?
MYSTERION
[thinks a moment] Sometimes, people do stupid things. Sometimes they don't realize what should have come first. Until it's too late.
KAREN
But I'm all alone now.
MYSTERION
You are not alone. No matter where you go, no matter what you do, I will always be here! Do you understand?
KAREN
I'll try, guardian angel.
MYSTERION
Don't try, Karen. Do. [the bedroom light comes on]
MR. WEATHERHEAD
What in the name of nobody knows are you doing, Karen?! [she looks back at him, then at the window. Mysterion is gone. Mr. Weatherhead goes to the window and looks out to see what Karen was looking at. Failing to see him, he closes the windows and keeps vigil for a bit]
[Park County Police Station. A phone rings and one of the officers answers it.]
OFFICER 4
Police man. [starts taking notes] Yes. Yes. Alright, thanks for the tip. We'll check it out. [hangs up] Better call the lieutenant. Looks like we've got another meth lab in town.
[The Cartman house, night. The front yard is full of police, and a few of them are inside, as seen through the open front door. Liane is being arrested and nearby are two suitcases]
OFFICER 5
Got any needles on you? Any crack pipes?
LIANE
Oh, oh, my goodness no. I haven't used drugs in quite a while.
OFFICER 5
Then why is there a meth lab in your backyard?
CARTMAN
[comes down the stairs in a Hawaiian shirt] What is going on here? Mom, what have you done? Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom is so poor she uses Cheerios for earrings. Well... guess I'm off to a foster home then. [walks over to the suitcases and grabs the handles] Hawaii is my first choice. Something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a short walk away? [turns left and begins to walk out] It's gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now.
OFFICER 5
When will you people learn to lay off the Pabst Blue Ribbon? Now look at the camera and say "I'm white trash and I'm in trouble."
LIANE
Oh. Ah, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.
[Park County Police Station, day, the soft room. Cartman sits there waiting for Mr. Adams, who soon enters.]
MR. ADAMS
Hi there, how you doin'? My name's Mr. Adams, and I'm with Child Protective Services. [sits down, but just as quickly gets up] Here's my head shot. [gives Cartman a picture of himself] I just need to get some information from you if that's okay.
CARTMAN
[sets the picture aside] Yeah, yeah.
MR. ADAMS
Okay, now it says here your mother was operating a meth lab.
CARTMAN
That's right.
MR. ADAMS
And it also says here that Penn State prefers to be losing at halftime? Because at Penn State they like when you're a little behind in the locker room. That's a joke. Did you get that one? It's a play on words, we like to have fun here.
CARTMAN
Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?!
MR. ADAMS
We just - no, we just like to have fun here.
CARTMAN
Well I'll tell you somethin'! Being from a low-income household isn't funny! Oh heell no, my momma's so poor she opened a Gmail account just so she could eat the spam! [Mr. Adams doesn't look too happy]
MR. ADAMS
What? What, is that supposed to be some kind of joke? You think you're funny?
CARTMAN
A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?!
MR. ADAMS
Could be worse.
CARTMAN
How?!
MR. ADAMS
Could be in Happy Valley! On a scale from 1 to 10, how old should you be to stay away from Penn State?
CARTMAN
Dude, my momma's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle so she's gotta go Greyhound off the handle!
MR. ADAMS
[sighs] Two Penn State administrators walk into a butt-!
[On the road, day. Two police officers drive Cartman towards his new foster home]
CARTMAN
Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet?
OFFICER 6
Hawaii?
CARTMAN
Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent.
OFFICER 7
Your foster home is here, pretty much the exact opposite of Hawaii.
CARTMAN
What?? [looks out the window. A sign on the side of the road says "Welcome to Greeley, 'The Exact Opposite of Hawaii" Please drive safely" A crow stands on top of the sign] Greeley?
[The Weatherhead residence, same day. The kids are mopping, dusting, sweeping, or scrubbing the dining room area. Kenny is scrubbing the floor while Karen sweeps up nearby with a push broom. One boy is vacuuming the throw rug in the living room. Mr. Weatherhead walks by]
MR. WEATHERHEAD
Come on now! This is not the way we've told you to tidy up! Remember? Cleanliness is next to godliness, so make it kind of clean but not too much! Amanda! More ambiguous on the dusting! [there's a knock on the door] Kenneth, answer the door! [Kenny gets up and walks to the front door, opens it, and allows Cartman in and closes the door]
CARTMAN
What the? Dude, this is like poorer than my old house!
KENNY
(What the fuck are you doing here?!)
MRS. WEATHERHEAD
Hello Eric, your room is upstairs on the left. Are you hungry?
CARTMAN
You're my new mom?
MRS. WEATHERHEAD
You can call me Mom if you like.
CARTMAN
Alright Mom, how much money do you make? Like gross yearly income after taxes?
[Upstairs. The boys' room is opened and Mr. Weatherhead shows Cartman in.]
MR. WEATHERHEAD
This is where you'll sleep with your foster brothers. You will be clean, polite, and most importantly, you WILL follow the agnostic code: We cannot know with certainty if God or Christ exists. They COULD. Then again there COULD be a giant reptilian bird in charge of everything. Can we be CERTAIN there isn't? NO, so it's pointless to talk about. Now say it with me.
CARTMAN
Goddamn, I've gotta sleep in a room with six other people?! How poor are we?!
MR. WEATHERHEAD
HEY! We do not take the Lord's name in vain in this house, just in case there is one! Do you understand, or do you need the punishment room?!
CARTMAN
Oh heell naw! [yells into the hallway] Mom! Dad's being mean to me! Mem! MEEM! [Mrs. Weatherhead walks in]
MRS. WEATHERHEAD
My name. Is not. Meom!
[Greeley Elementary, day. There are cows all over the campus and the building is even plainer than South Park Elementary's. Inside, Cartman walks with Kenny and Karen down the hallway]
CARTMAN
Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean.
KAREN
I'll see you at recess, right?
KENNY
(I'll be there, Karen.) [Karen walks into her classroom]
CARTMAN
You've already been here awhile, Kenny, so you have to introduce me to your friends, okay? And make sure they know I'm kewl. You've gotta have my back, Kenny! [Kenny walks up to a group of his new friends]
BOY 1
[with thick wavy hair] Oh hey, Kenny. Who's this?
KENNY
(This is Eric Cartman.)
BOY 2
[the tall one] Does he live with you at the foster home?
CARTMAN
[moves past Kenny] Okay, alright, so listen: I know our family is poor, okay?! But before we lived there, Kenny was actually poorer than me! So technically, he's the poorest kid at this school!
BOY 1
What are you talking about? The poor kid in this school is Jacob Hallery. [Hallery is shown seated on some steps, looking unkempt and eating moldy bread]
CARTMAN
Really?
BOY 2
Yeah, dude. His dad died five years ago and his mom went crazy from depression, so she can't even keep a job.
CARTMAN
[jumps for joy] YES! Yeheah, did you hear that Kenny?? We're good! I seriously thought we didn't stand a chance, but now... everything's gonna be okay!
Cause I'm not (I'm not) the poor kid at school! [runs up to Jacob]
Let's hear it for Jacob Hallery, guys!
His mom is so poor she cuts coupons out to be institutionalized!
Greeley Colorado's the place to be!
It's a whole new beginning for you and me!
Life can only get better 'cause I know one simple ruuule!
I'm not (he's not) the poor kid at school!
BOY 1
Did he do stuff like this at your old school?
KENNY
(Uh huh.)
CARTMAN
Let's put our hands up, everyone! 'Cept for Jacob. His mom is so poor she only understands hand-OUTS. [laughs even harder]
[The principal's office, later. Cartman is facing the principal now.]
PRINCIPAL
Eric, at Greeley Elementary we do not tolerate students making fun of other students.
CARTMAN
I wasn't making fun of anybody.
PRINCIPAL
[reading from a report about the incident] A twenty-minute song and dance number with forty seven "Yo momma so poor" jokes directed at Jacob Hallery, which ended in a finale with fireworks.
CARTMAN
I was just teasing.
PRINCIPAL
Your case worker has been notified, and he is not happy.
CARTMAN
My case worker? [looks over his shoulder and sees Mr. Adams walk in] Oh, not this guy!
MR. ADAM
I know this is a difficult adjustment for you, Eric! But you can't just turn all your frustrations on a little kid who can't defend himself! I mean, what do you think this is?! The shower room at Penn State?! I'm kidding. We like to have fun in our department, so I was like, I was like, "What? Is this like the shower room at Penn State?!" I joke around. This is my head shot. [hands the principal a picture of himself]
CARTMAN
Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?! All you're doing is taking something topical and revamping old Catholic jokes!
MR. ADAMS
[a few seconds of silence] Oh! Oh, and "your momma" jokes are better?! They've been around since the '50s!
PRINCIPAL
[exasperated, he pounds both fists on the desk] What the hell does this have to do with anything?!
GIRL 1
Principal, you've gotta send help to the playground! They're about to beat up that new kid!
[The playground outside. Karen has been singled out and the other kids close in on her.]
JESSICA
Aww, look at the new kid and her wittle dolly. You gonna cry some more in class, wimp?!
BOY 3
L-leave her alone.
JESSICA
Shut up! You foster twerps are all the same! Come on! Hand over the doll! [from on high Mysterion drops down in front of Karen] Who the hell is this?!
MYSTERION
How about you find another little girl to pick on?
JESSICA
Mind your business, Peter Pan! [Mysterion kicks her in the stomach, then gives her a flying punch across the face which leads to a black eye, and punches her again, leading to her falling on her face]
MYSTERION
[pulling Jessica's head up by her hair] Karen McCormick is off limits! Do you understand?! Make sure everybody in this school knows! [drops some Chinese fireworks as a distraction while he takes Karen up to the roof.]
[The Weatherhead house, night. The family is at table. Mr. Weatherhead leads grace as Mrs. Weatherhead serves dinner individually.]
MR. WEATHERHEAD
And if this food comes as a gift from some divine intelligence, we understand that an intelligent being cannot blame us for questioning its existence. Nobody knows, nobody can know if any deity is watching over us. Amen.
BOY 4
Except for Karen's guardian angel.
MR. WEATHERHEAD
What?
MELISSA
Where did he take you after he saved you, Karen?
KAREN
He just took me back to my classroom. Then he disappeared like always.
MR. WEATHERHEAD
[pounds the table] What have we told you about making up angel stories?!
GIRL 3
But we SAW him. He leaped down from the sky.
DAVID
And he kicked the crap out of Jessica Pinkerton. [the other kids begin to chime in]
MRS. WEATHERHEAD
[moving quickly to the head of the table] Stop it, children! We do not speak such certainties in this house!
MR. WEATHERHEAD
Get down to the basement, all of you! It's time for the Punishment Room! [Kenny gets angry]
[The basement, also known as the Punishment Room, later. David is now tied up and dangling from one of the beams. Mrs. Weatherhead douses him with a torrent of Dr Pep-er. The Weatherheads have kegs of it down there.]
DAVID
AAAAAAAH!
MR. WEATHERHEAD
Now, did you see an angel?!
DAVID
No, I - no - I didn't see an angel.
MR. WEATHERHEAD
No, you can't be certain of that! You might've seen one! [to his wife] Hit him with the Dr Pep-er again. [the wife lets loose the drink once again, then stops] Are there such things as angels?!
DAVID
Maybe.
MR. WEATHERHEAD
Good! [the wife lets loose the drink once again]
KAREN
What do we do, Kenny? [Kenny isn't there] Kenny?
MR. WEATHERHEAD
What is the meaning of life?!
DAVID
It's impossible to knoooow!
MR. WEATHERHEAD
That's right! [a knock is soon heard, and it's persistent]
MRS. WEATHERHEAD
Who could that be? [the adults go upstairs and to the front door to answer it]
MR. ADAMS
Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead, I received some disturbing news that all you're providing the foster children here to drink is soda?
CARTMAN
Haha, I told on you Mom and Dad!
MR. WEATHERHEAD
What business is that of yours?!
MR. ADAMS
It's my business because Child Protective Services is accountable for these kids! [he now talks more calmly] Have I given you my head shot?
MRS. WEATHERHEAD
Yes, yes, we have that.
MR. ADAMS
Okay now, are you only giving these kids Dr Pepper to drink?
MR. WEATHERHEAD
If we want to serve agnostic beverages in this house, then by Goddish we'll do it! The children you've sent here are undisciplined and talking about the certainty of angels! [a window breaks upstairs and the Weatherheads go up to see where it broke]
MR. ADAMS
Excuse me! [waits, then sighs] Let's have a look around.
[Upstairs, the Weatherheads enter the girls' room and find the walls covered in colored question marks - the sign of Mysterion. The Weatherheads walk towards the window]
MR. WEATHERHEAD
What the? Who did this?
MRS. WEATHERHEAD
What is that? [Mysterion turns right and runs down the hallway and into the boys' room. The Weatherheads follow suit and find Mysterion squatting on the window sill. Mysterion drops down and out of view. The Weatherheads reach the window]
MRS. WEATHERHEAD
It was like a... little mystery person... flying around.
MR. WEATHERHEAD
Almost like some kind of... agnostic angel. [notices a note pinned to the outside wall with a knife. He removes the note and reads it. "Look in the fridge."]
[The basement. Mr. Adams and Cartman get to the floor and Mr. Adams finds the door to the Punishment Room locked, so he decides to run into it. This proves successful, and Mr. Adams gets to see what his work has led to.]
MR. ADAMS
Oh my God. [David is still dangling from the beam and the other kids are still in the corner by the water heater] What's going on here?
DAVID
[softly] We don't know... We can't possibly know...
MR. ADAMS
[leans back on the door frame] What have I done? [sits in the doorway with his head in his hands] I took you kids from your parents without even checking into where you were going! I put innocent children into a dangerous environment! What am I, a recruitment coach for Penn State? [begins to cry. Cartman laughs] It's not funny!
[The ground floor. The Weatherheads make their way slowly to the refrigerator.]
MR. WEATHERHEAD
There's nothing in there but Dr Pepper, right? There can't be. [inside is one can of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer with a question mark attached to it with a spring. Mrs. Weatherhead opens the door quickly and finds the can]
MRS. WEATHERHEAD
Ohhh...
MR. WEATHERHEAD
How did that get here?! [takes the can out, and his wife closes the door] It says it's a Pabst Blue Ribbon.
MRS. WEATHERHEAD
What is it?
MR. WEATHERHEAD
[opens the can and takes a sip] It's like beer... but different. [hands it to his wife]
MRS. WEATHERHEAD
[takes a sip] But how did it get here? [they begin to take turns sipping the beer.]
[Outside. Greeley police cars have pulled up and cops have poured out. Some of them are taking the Weatherheads out of the house as the foster kids watch.]
MR. WEATHERHEAD
Shut your mouth, bitch!
MRS. WEATHERHEAD
You shut your mouth, you filth-fucking asshole!
MR. WEATHERHEAD
Fuck you, bitch!
GREELEY OFFICER 1
You have the right to remain silent. Now look at the camera and say "I'm white trash and I'm in trouble."
MRS. WEATHERHEAD
I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!
GREELEY OFFICER 2
Get in the car, you!
MR. WEATHERHEAD
Wait a minute, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble?
MR. ADAMS
No, no, take all these kids back to their parents! We've embarrassed the system and made it something nobody wants to be a part of! It's like a Penn State homecoming party! [covers his face and begins to cry. Nearby, Cartman is already in the back seat of a cruiser as a third cop talks to him]
GREELEY OFFICER 3
A false police report can carry up to a two-month prison term, son.
CARTMAN
I'm not saying it.
GREELEY OFFICER 3
We can do this the easy way, or we can do it hard!
CARTMAN
I'm not saying it!
GREELEY OFFICER 3
Then we'll add another charge for resisting!
CARTMAN
Okay, fine! [turns to the camera] I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!
NARRATOR
Three arrests in just one power-packed episode, proving once again that we are all just one Pabst Blue Ribbon away from becoming... white trash in trouble! Sponsored by Schlitz.
[South Park Elementary, day. The kids are once again in the hallway, but this time they're cheering Kenny's return]
STAN
Well it sure is good to have you back, Kenny.
KENNY
(Thanks, Stan.)
KYLE
I hear your parents might give up selling meth for good.
KENNY
(Good for me.)
CARTMAN
[walks up] There he is, there's my buddy.
KYLE
How was jail, fatass?!
CARTMAN
Well, I did a lot of thinking. And you know, guys, there's an important lesson I think we've all learned. What do we do when the tables are turned?
The day's looking brighter. Gray skies are turning blue.
'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not) the poor kid at school!
Kenny's back and it's such a thrill. Now I'm rich just like Stan and Kiul!
All that matters is no one thinks I'm a tool! 'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not)
That's right, the poor kid in school.
Sing it with me, guys!
He's not the poor kid in school. (He's not)
I'm not-
[a giant reptilian bird's head smashes through the roof and second floor of the school and the kids clear out as the head looks around]
KIDS
Aaaah! [the beak grabs Kenny and swings him back and forth between the lockers]
KENNY
(AAAAHH!) [the bird opens its mouth and swallows Kenny, then flies away. The kids look through the massive hole left by the bird]
STAN
...What the fuck?!
CARTMAN
[begins to cry and walk away while Kyle stares angrily at him] Aww, my mom is so poor she walks down the road with one shoooe. [backs up] And if you ask her if she lost a shoe, she'd say "No, I found ooone."
End of The Poor Kid
