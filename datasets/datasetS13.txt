synopsis:Kenny takes his new girlfriend to a Jonas Brothers' concert where they each get purity rings.

script:The Ring

[Clyde, Cartman, Stan, Kyle, Tolkien, Jimmy, and Craig are at the school cafeteria, looking at someone from across the room.]
CARTMAN
Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it?
STAN
I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me.
KYLE
Yeah, it's just so astounding.
CARTMAN
Well, believe it friends. The impossible has happened. [the boys are looking at Kenny and a girl eating alone together at another table.] Kenny has a girlfriend.
CRAIG
Yeah, a fifth-grade girlfriend.
KYLE
This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.
JIMMY
Well, so, w-who is she?
CARTMAN
Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.
BUTTERS
[runs up to the boys' table] Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!
STAN
What?
BUTTERS
[panting softly] Well, apparently Kenny has a girlfriend!
STAN
Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader.
BUTTERS
Um, does Kenny like her?
KYLE
I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever.
BUTTERS
Oh, no. Oh, geez!
CARTMAN
[getting irritated] Butters, what's the problem?
BUTTERS
Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
KYLE
What?!
BUTTERS
It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. "Tammy Warner is a total slut!"
CARTMAN
That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she's just gonna throw it in his face!
JIMMY
Well, Kenny deserves to know, fellas. If you guys found out my girlfriend was a raging whore, I'd want you to t-tell me.
STAN
[sighs] All right, come on, guys. [leaves the table with Kyle and Cartman.]
BUTTERS
Hey, Jimmy, what's a B.J.?
[At the school hall, two girls walk by. One of them, Meagan Ridley, chats away at the other.]
MEAGAN
So, anyway, I passed him a note, but then Johnny... [Kenny walks alone down a different hall. Stan catches up to him]
STAN
Kenny! Hey, hey, Kenny! [Kyle and Cartman are with him]
KENNY
(Oh, hi, guys.)
STAN
Listen, Kenny, we need to talk about your new girlfriend.
KENNY
(What about her?)
STAN
[sighs and lowers his head] Oh, boy.
KYLE
Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but...
KENNY
(But what?)
KYLE
W-well, we've heard that she's...
CARTMAN
Kenny. [deep sigh, puts his right hand on Kenny's back for sympathy] Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
KENNY
[afraid, high voice] (Huh?)
CARTMAN
Your girlfriend's a slut, dude.
KENNY
(Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, hey, yay!) [jumps for joy, dances down the hall, makes a right and runs off.]
CARTMAN
[moments later] He took it pretty well.
[Tammy is at her locker putting some books away. Kenny skips around the corner, sees her, and runs up to her.]
KENNY
[cheerfully] (Hey, Tammy!)
TAMMY
Hi, Ken. You decide what you wanna do after school?
KENNY
(Yeah, I was kinda thinking we could go to TGI Friday's.)
TAMMY
TGI Friday's?
KENNY
(Yep. I like the food!)
TAMMY
Yeah, okay. But... [walks away a few steps] Kenny. Listen. Uh, there's somethin' I need to talk to you about. There's a lot of rumors goin' around about me, that I agreed to give a boy a B.J.? Well, it's true. [Kenny dances with glee, but Tammy doesn't see this. She gets apologetic] But it was before you and I were together, and it wasn't my fault! [Kenny stops dancing] See, I was watchin' the Disney Channel, and that show came on with the Jonas Brothers.
KENNY
(Jonas Brothers?)
TAMMY
You know that teenage boy band? Every time I see them I get so tingly. I just completely lose control. [Kenny starts dancing again] And then Dave Darsky showed up and took me to TGI Friday's, [Kenny stops] and it just happened. But it was only for one second, and I had my eyes closed. I know it's terrible. Can you... can you forgive me, Ken? [Kenny walks up to her, puts a consoling hand on her shoulder, and sighs]
[At the Ticketmaxx store, Kenny is at the counter making a purchase.]
CLERK
There you are, young man. Two tickets to the Jonas Brothers concert.
KENNY
(Thanks.) [turns around and walks out with his tickets]
[Outside, Cartman, Stan and Kyle wait for him.]
CARTMAN
The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you? [Kenny continues walking, the other three join him as he walks across the parking lot]
KYLE
Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?
KENNY
(Yeah. Tammy said if I got her the tickets for the concert, she would give me a B.J.!)
STAN
A B.J.?
KYLE
You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?
KENNY
(Of course, dude!)
CARTMAN
[forcibly stops Kenny] Kenny! You're gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls' mouths are full of germs!
STAN
Yeah, dude, that's gross.
KENNY
[turns right and leaves the other boys behind] (I don't care. I've gotta get some protection.)
KYLE
What kind of protection?
[At the drugstore, Kenny walks into it towards the counter. The other boys follow him in.]
KENNY
(I'd like a box of condoms, please.)
CLERK 2
Box of condoms. Certainly, little boy. What kind would you like?
KENNY
(Uhm, I'll take one of those.)
CLERK 2
These here? Why, certainly. [The Clerk reaches for a box on a rack and hands it to Kenny. Kenny reads the cover: "Big Mamba. The world's #1 condom. Trusted for over 50 years."]
KENNY
(Cool!) [Kenny pays for the condoms and turns to head out the door]
KYLE
Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?
KENNY
(No, I'm not young and I want a B.J.)
CARTMAN
[reaches out to Kenny and stops him] Just because you have condoms doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you're gonna let that near your penis?
KENNY
(Yep! Woo-hoo!) [skips away]
[The Denver Pepsi Center, night. The Jonas Brothers are headlining. Inside is a stadium full of tween girls all cheering for the Jonas Brothers to come out.]
TAMMY
Go, baby! Whoooo! Kenny, you're the best for bringing me here. Isn't this awesome? [the lights go out and cameras begin to take pictures of the stage. Soon the stage lights come up and the Jonas Brothers appear. The girls go wild]
[First song.]
JOE JONAS
I'm ready to get it on.
But there's no gettin' on until I'm ready.
Too soon, slow down.
Take it easy, oh, my girl, I need your love. Bay-bay!
JONAS BROTHERS
I can't wait till the day I kiss you.
Until then I have to tease you.
'Cause my mom doesn't like it when I'm naughty.
She'll make me clean my room if I'm naughty.
JOE
Bay-bay! I'm hot.
NICK JONAS
He's hot.
[In the audience during the song. The girls react in various ways. Tammy first looks on, then shrieks uncontrollably.]
LITTLE GIRL
[putting her hands over her crotch] My 'giney tickles! [she rubs her crotch to pleasure herself. Most other girls do the same thing]
TAMMY
[grabs onto Kenny's parka] Oh, my God. It's that tingling again. [a girl has left her seat and is in an aisle gyrating her butt up and down. Tammy gets up on her seat and screams towards the band] I love you! [she's shocked at what she just said, then begins dancing in her seat. Kenny sits in his seat unenthused, wondering when the payoff is coming.]
[Second song.]
JOE
Tell me how was I to know?
JONAS BROTHERS
You'd take your love and go.
JOE
Was it 'cause I wanted to wait till we were married...
JONAS BROTHERS
To put my arm around you?
JOE
The seasons change.
KEVIN JONAS
Bay-bay!
JOE
And the world goes round.
NICK
The world goes round and round and round.
[In the audience during the song. The girls continue cheering. Tammy stands on her seat, speechless. A little girl runs up on stage, hugs one of the singers, and is hauled away by security. Tammy dances again.]
[Third song.]
JONAS BROTHERS
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna take my time.
Can't wait 'til you are mine, but it might be a while. 'Cause,
yeah yeah, girl, we can take it slow, so we have room to grow.
And then someday we can get it on.
Until then, go back to Montreal.
JOE
'Cause I still love you, bay-bay!
NICK
Love you, bay-bay!
KEVIN
Bay-bay!
[In the audience during the song. A girl is carried out on a stretcher.]
TAMMY
Whoooooo! [a toddler makes her way towards the stage by climbing over the rows of cheering girls] Aaah-oww! You're so hot, Kevin! I love you, Joe!
MR. SLAVE
JESUS CHRIST!
JONAS BROTHERS
Good night, Denver. We love you all! [skips off the stage] We love you, Denver! [skips off the stage] Good night! [skips off the stage]
[The stage lights go down, the stadium lights come up, and the girls begin to file out of the Pepsi Center.]
TAMMY
Oh, my God, I am so worked up! I just want to attack you, Kenny!
KENNY
(All right! Come on, let's get to the parking lot. Woo-hoo!) [grabs her hand and they walk towards the exit]
USHER
And, uh, you too, little girl in the red.
TAMMY
[looks over her shoulder] Huh?
USHER
Band would like you to come backstage. You, too, little girl in the puppy T-shirt. [the blonde girl looks down at her shirt, shrieks, and makes her way to the usher]
TAMMY
They want me to come backstage? Oh, my God!
KENNY
[pulling at Tammy] (No, no, we're going to your place now!)
TAMMY
It's a dream come true! [Tammy lets go of Kenny and goes down the aisle towards the usher]
KENNY
[gives chase] (Hey!)
USHER
All right, right this way, girls.
ROADIE
Yeah, come on in everyone. The band is waiting for you. [quickly blocks Kenny from entering.] Uh, not you. [kicks Kenny aside a few times]
KENNY
(No, fuck that, dude! I bought the fucking tickets!) [the roadie closes the door and Kenny starts pounding on it] (Hey! What the fuck?!)
ROADIE 2
[in a sensuous voice] The Jonas Brothers will be right out, girls. [leaves]
GIRL IN PUPPY T-SHIRT
Why do you think they called us back here?
FAT GIRL
They must-a wanna have sex with us.
TAMMY
What? You think so?
FAT GIRL
Sure, they're a band. They called us back here so we can give them blowjobs.
GIRL IN PUPPY T-SHIRT
Well, I'm not doing it! Just 'cause they're rock stars doesn't mean I'll do that!
GIRL IN O T-SHIRT
Yeah, I'm not giving a blowjob to anybody!
TAMMY
Me neither. [suddenly the brothers appear]
JONAS BROTHERS
Hey, there, girls! [all of a sudden the girls' mouths pop open as their jaws drop. As the brothers talk, they strike poses]
JOE
Hey, listen, we saw you out there in the audience.
NICK
Yeah, you were getting a little crazy out there.
FAT GIRL
Let's just get to the blowjobs.
JOE
Blow whats?
KEVIN
[to his brothers] I don't know. [to the girls] Look, we called you back here because we want to share our love of Christ with you.
NICK
And see if you'll wear purity rings from now on.
TAMMY
[perplexed] Purity rings?
JOE
We all wear purity rings. It means we are going to be pure and not have sex until we're married.
KEVIN
And it means we stay away from bad stuff and avoid people who swear and watch naughty TV shows.
NICK
That's just how we roll.
KEVIN
Yeah.
NICK
Yeah. [they high-five each other. In a wide shot, we see Kenny peering in on the exchange through a transom window.]
JOE
So, what do ya say, girls? You wanna be kid hipsters like us and wear purity rings too?
THE GIRLS
[mesmerized] Okay.
KEVIN
And be sure to give a ring to all the kids you care about, 'cause it's the hip new way to roll.
[The neighborhood bus stop. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman wait for the school bus to arrive. A somber Kenny walks in from right of frame.]
CARTMAN
Well well well, here he comes. It's B.J. McKay and his best friend Bear.
STAN
So how did it go last night? [Kenny breathes in deep and sighs, takes off his left glove and shows the other boys the purity ring Tammy gave him]
KYLE
What's that?
KENNY
(A purity ring.)
CARTMAN
Purity ring?
KENNY
(Yeah, it's a purity ring.)
KYLE
...Well, what does that mean?
KENNY
(It means I'm gonna be pure and not have sex until I get married.)
STAN
Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a B.J. before you got too old an-
KENNY
(I did! I was really excited to get a B.J. but now I have to wear this motherfucking purity ring!)
KYLE
Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting B.J.s anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex.
KENNY
(Yeah.) [Kenny crosses his arms and tries his best to be agreeable with Kyle, but looks at his left ring finger and uncrosses his arms, breaking the act] (It isn't fair I was so close to getting a blow job and I'll never get one now - this is fucking bullshit...) [Kenny walks away bawling. The other boys just watch him leave]
[The neighborhood park. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are playing basketball with Craig, Clyde, and Tolkien. Kyle tosses the ball to Craig, who tosses it back to him. Kyle then tosses the ball to Tolkien...]
BUTTERS
[runs up to the boys] Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.
KYLE
Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now.
BUTTERS
Uh, what's that?
STAN
They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore.
BUTTERS
[gets pensive] Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring? [Stan and Kyle look at each other]
[Montage.]
JONAS BROTHERS
I've got a ring on my finger to remind me what I cannot do.
Can't just do whatever I feel like, I've got to stay right, just and true.
I can't hang out with my buddies and get into trouble,
'Cause now we're both wearing these rings for each other.
But who needs sex and drugs and partying
When we can cook a meal, then sit around and watch Netflix...
Bay-bay!
I've got a ring on my finger to remind me that I must behave.
No need to chase after girls; it's a promise I can never break.
I made a commitment and it is forever,
So we can spend every waking minute together.
And if we get bored it won't be a problem,
'Cause we can just hang out with other couples who wear these rings...
Bay-bay!
[Kenny walks down a side street alone. He looks at his purity ring, still on his finger. Joe leads the Jonas Brothers in a song. Kenny looks out the living room window as Stan, Kyle, and Cartman toilet-paper the houses across the street. Kenny visits Tammy and they both stare at their rings. Kenny stares from afar as Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Butters, Craig and Jimmy put the finishing touch on a snowman - a huge penis and set of balls, propped up by a twig. Kenny walks off, unable to enjoy the project. Kenny and Tammy eat frozen dinners at her table as she studies. Kenny and Tammy watch TV on her sofa, but Kenny is bored and has his head resting on his right hand. A shot of the Jonas Brothers. Kenny looks at two sluts walk by, his left hand stretched out. They ignore him. Kenny and Tammy stand in the middle of the Farmer's Market as people walk by around them. Kenny is back at Tammy's eating frozen dinner. Another shot of the Jonas Brothers. Kenny and Tammy sit on a bench at Stark's Pond. They're in Tammy's living room watching TV again. Now they're in a group meeting of purity couples.]
PURITY BOY 1
Yeah, we found out that once you wear purity rings, it's best to hang out with other couples that do. Got more in common. Isn't that right, Sarah?
PURITY BOY 2
You know? What Carole and I enjoy is Grey's Anatomy. We love Grey's Anatomy, don't we, Carole?
PURITY BOY 3
We adore Grey's Anatomy, don't we, Nancy?
NANCY
Adore it. Kenny and Tammy, do you watch Grey's Anatomy?
PURITY BOY 1
We look forward to it all week long. [chuckles. Sarah laughs with him]
PURITY BOY 3
Sure is sweet.
PURITY BOY 1
It's the most fun I've had in weeks. [laughter]
JONAS BROTHERS
I've got a ring on my finger to remind me what I cannot do.
What I cannot do.
Bay... bay...
Baaay...
Baybay.
Baybay.
Baaaybaaaaay.
[Turns out the Jonas Brothers were shooting a video.]
DIRECTOR
Aaand cut. Great video shoot, guys.
JOE
This is bullpucky!
KEVIN
Yeah, we've had it, Goshdarnit!
DIRECTOR
Uh oh, looks like we've got a problem.
[The director's office, moments later.]
JOE
Our decision is final! We have decided, as a band, not to wear purity rings anymore!
KEVIN
Yeah, you tell 'em, Joe.
DISNEY EXEC 1
Boys, I know you're tired, but the purity rings are important to the company's image.
JOE
We don't care about the company.
DIRECTOR
And you're gonna say that to the boss's face?
KEVIN
We aren'--we aren't afraid of him.
DISNEY EXEC 2
Well, I hope you're right, because the boss is on his way here. Now.
DISNEY EXEC 3
[looks out the door] Oh Jesus, he's here. The boss is here!
KEVIN
Let's be strong, guys.
DISNEY EXEC 3
[opens the door just a crack and looks out again] Hello sir. How was your trip? [the door flies open and in walks a swaggering Mickey Mouse]
MICKEY
[looks around] What's all this I'm hearing about not wearing the purity rings, haha?
DIRECTOR
Uh we'll just leave you alone. [he and the other executives clear out of the room]
MICKEY
So uh, I guess we have some issues, haha?
KEVIN
We... need to talk about something.
MICKEY
Oh boy! I just love flying all the way to Colorado to hear about your problems, haha.
JOE
Look, we just want our concerts to be about our music, and not about purity rings.
MICKEY
Oh Gosh, fellas, let me explain this to you one more time. You have to wear the purity rings because that's how we can sell sex to little girls, haha. See, if we make the posters with little girls reaching for your junk, then you have to wear purity rings or else Disney Company looks baaad, haha.
JOE
Well we don't wanna be selling sex to little girls anymore.
MICKEY
The rings stay on!
JOE
Well, well, maybe we'll just refuse to go onstage. [Mickey walks over and punches him in the balls. Joe groans and falls forward to the ground]
MICKEY
[Mickey kicks Joe's his body with every accented word] You DON'T... FUCKING...TALK to me...Like THAT, haha. You LITTLE... PIECE of... SHIT, Haha! [Joe coughs up some blood] Get the fuck up. Get the fuck up! Haha. [Joe begins to stand, then gets some help from his brother. Mickey wipes his gloves clean] Now, do we have a problem?! Haha.
NICK
No, sir.
KEVIN
No, Mr. Mouse.
JOE
[softly] No, Mr. Mouse.
MICKEY
Oh, that's good, 'cause I thought we had a problem for a minute there, haha. [heads for the door] Alright now, get out there and make me some Goddamned money! Haha. [shuts the door behind him as he leaves. A picture of the brothers falls from the back of the door and shatters on the floor.]
[A bookstore, day. Kenny looks at some Jonas Brothers DVDs. Kyle walks into view in the fiction section.]
KYLE
Yup, he's in here. [Stan and Cartman appear behind him, then they all exit frame, reappearing at the video section.]
STAN
Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!
KYLE
We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?!
KENNY
[unusually resigned] (Look at this. More DVDs.) [shows the DVD to the guys]
CARTMAN
[takes the DVD and looks at the front cover. Kenny freezes with his left hand held out] Grey's Anatomy?! Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?!
STAN
Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude.
CARTMAN
[notices that Kenny has stopped responding.] Kenny? Kenny? [snaps his fingers] Kenny? [snaps his fingers again] Wanna look at Playboy? [snaps his fingers again] Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?
STAN
[takes the DVD from Cartman and hands it back to Kenny] You want your Grey's Anatomy back, Kenny?
KENNY
[starts responding and takes the DVD] (Oh, Grey's Anatomy. Cool! Oh man, this is a great season. Look at all this stuff, so cool.)
STAN
[takes Kyle and Cartman aside] You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him.
KYLE
It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd.
CARTMAN
[notices something on the shelf next to him] Oh my God, look at this! [grabs it and looks at it] Motherfucker!
STAN
What? [he and Kyle walk up to get a better look - it's Teen Pop Magazine with Jonas Brothers on the cover]
CARTMAN
"Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings." These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this! [throws the magazine to the floor]
KYLE
Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!
STAN
All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die! [he and Cartman leave. Kyle stays in place a while, then walks back to Kenny, patting him on the back]
KYLE
Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you. [runs off to catch up with the other two boys. Kenny is left caressing the DVD]
KENNY
(Yeah...)
[A morning show airs, its graphics showing up first.]
ANNOUNCER
Live from Five News Studio in Colorado, it's Good Mornin' Denver.
HOST
We are joined this morning by the Disney supergroup the Jonas Brothers. Hello boys. [the girls in the audience begin to shriek. Each of the brothers holds a mic]
JOE
Hello.
HOST
Now, tell us what you're doin' here in Denver, guys.
JOE
Uh, we're gonna be doin' a live concert from Red Rocks tonight that will be live-broadcast on the Disney Channel.
MICKEY
[in the control tent with an engineer] In 3-D. Don't forget to mention in 3-D.
KEVIN
Oh, oh-and it's gonna be in 3-D. [the girls shriek again]
HOST
Now, guys, a lot has been made about your "purity rings". Can you tell us about those?
JOE
Well. Um. [Joe holds up his left hand, palm in, to show off his ring. His brothers do the same seconds later] We, we wear these to symbolize how pure we are and how we ...um don't approve of things that are naughty or filthy.
MICKEY
Yeah, that's good. Get a close-up on their purity rings. Close-up on the purity rings, haha. [the engineer responds]
HOST
That's wonderful, boys. [the camera zooms in on Joe's left ring finger, on which his purity ring rests] It's good that little girls can see a concert and not have it be about sex. We understand that at the concert tonight you'll be dousing girls in the audience with white foam. Is that correct?
NICK
Uh huh.
JOE
Yeah. Uh huh.
KEVIN
Yeah.
NICK
Yeah.
HOST
Well can you give our audience a peek? [to the audience] What do you say girls? Do you want the Jonas Brothers to douse you with their white foam? [the girls shriek again. The brothers whip out some high-pressure hoses with bags of foam attached to them and proceed to spray the audience with streams of white foam. One of their songs plays in the background]
MICKEY
Oh boy! This is TV gold, haha. [Stan, Kyle, and Cartman enter the street and make their way through the audience]
STAN
Excuse us. Excuse us.
GIRL 2
Hey, what do you think you're doing?!
HOST
That's great stuff, boys. You like takin' the Jonas Brothers' hot foam in your faces, girls?
CARTMAN
Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!
STAN
Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!
JOE
Huh?
KYLE
What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?!
MICKEY
[takes notice] Who the hell are these guys? [takes off his shades and tosses them aside] Are they from DreamWorks? Goddamn Eisner trying to hurt this company again, haha?
CARTMAN
This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by [a dart strike him in the neck and knocks him out quick] teh- ...tehhhh [falls on his face]
KYLE
Cartman?
MICKEY
You aren't ruining my plans this time, DreamWorks, haha! [drops a dart into a blowpipe]
STAN
Dude, who the hell did that? [a dart hits him in the neck] Hwa? [another one hits Kyle in the neck]
KYLE
D'ow... [they both fall over unconscious.]
[Some time later, the boys are just now coming to. A POV shot. One of them has opened his eyes and his vision is quite fuzzy. Voices and noises echo around him.]
VOICE 1
Fifteen minutes, that's fifteen minutes, people!
VOICE 2
Get another mic on that drum kit!
MICKEY
They almost ruined everything, haha. How did something like this happen, haha? [walks up and gets in the boy's face] Wake up. Wake up, you little prick! Haha. [the boy is alert now] Who do you work for? DreamWorks? [cut to a wide shot revealing a disheveled Stan being held up by his hat. Nearby, Cartman and Kyle are still unconscious.] Answer me, haha!
STAN
We... don't work for anybody.
MICKEY
[lets Stan's head drop to the floor] Oh boy, I sure believe that, haha. [Cartman wakes up. Kyle stirs] You just tried to ruin Disney Company's big night for your own amusement, huh?! Haha.
CARTMAN
The hell did you do to us?!
MICKEY
SHUT UP! [kicks Cartman in the balls, making him sit on his ass] Haha.
[Red Rocks, that night. The concert begins.]
ANNOUNCER
And now, Disney Channel presents... the Jonas Brothers 3-D concert spectacular! [the graphic says "the 3D Concert Experience"] Live from Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado! [the young girl fans are there cheering and wearing 3-D glasses]
MALE HOST
Truly a night of magic as we're set for the biggest concert event of the year!
FEMALE HOST
In about ten minutes, the Jonas Brothers are going to take the stage in what Disney is calling "the most pure and innocent rock event of the millennia."
[A Christian living room.]
BLONDE GIRL
Do we put the 3-D glasses on now, da-da?
FATHER
Not yet, Katie.
MALE HOST
Everyone around the country is tuning in to see Disney's latest kid pop stars.
[Tammy's living room. She and Kenny sit apart.]
KENNY
[depressed] (And not getting a blowjob...)
MALE HOST
We understand the Jonas Brothers are getting ready. What's going on backstage must be exciting.
[Backstage. Mickey is facing the boys with a chainsaw in hand. He revs it up.]
MICKEY
You'd better start talkin', haha! [Stan covers his face, then removes his hands] You'd better start talkin' right now, haha!
STAN
We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.
KYLE
We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.
MICKEY
You're lying! I'll cut you up, haha!
JOE
You see? We were right about the purity rings! A nice Christian symbol can't be used for profit gains.
KEVIN
We've all angered God.
MICKEY
[walks up to them with the chainsaw and revs it up against the boys, who cringe a bit] You think God is in control here, haha?! I am in control! I've been in control since the '50s in case you haven't noticed, haha! [throws the chainsaw aside] You three faggots are going onstage, and [points at the boys] YOU three faggots aren't going to stop me! NOBODY IS RUINING THIS EVENT!! Haha. I've worked too long and too hard to have anybody [Kyle notices he's next to the mic control desk and surreptitiously turns up the Mic 1 slider] fuck this up! [this causes Mickey's voice to be heard by the audience, who quiet down] Where would you be without me, Jonas Brothers? Haha. Your music sucks and you know it! Haha. It's because you make little girls' 'ginies tickle! And when little girls' 'ginies tickle, I make money! Haha. And that's because little girls are fucking stupid! Haha. And the purity rings make it okay to do whatever I want! Haha. Even the Christians are too fucking stupid to figure out I'm selling sex to their daughters! I've made billions off of Christian ignorance for decades now, haha! And do you know why?! [Cartman sees the curtain control button and presses it. The curtain rises revealing Mickey Mouse to the audience] Because Christians are retard-ed! Haha. [Mickey is facing the boys, so he doesn't notice anything happening behind him yet] They believe in a talking dead guy! Haha. [having heard his own echo, he blanches and turns around. He now sees the audience] Ohhh. Haha. Hello, folks.
AUDIENCE
BOOO!!
MICKEY
Now now, take it easy, haha. Here's the Jonas Brothers.
JOE
Come on guys. [the brothers turn left and walk offstage and the booing continues]
MICKEY
No! Stop! Bring them back here!
ROADIE
It's over, Mr. Mouse. Everyone's tuning out.
MICKEY
NO! NO GODDAMNIT! NO! SHUT UP! SHUT! UP! AAAAAAGH! [Mickey suddenly blows up to a height of some 40 feet and starts breathing fire on the audience. The girls scatter]
FATHER
[walks up to the TV and turns it off] That's it girls. No more Disney TV for a while.
[Channel 4 Breaking News.]
REPORTER
Tom, the Disney Jonas Brothers 3D Television Special has failed, costing the Disney Company millions, and once again Mickey is pissed off and throwing a fit.
MICKEY
[floating over the city like a Thanksgiving Day float] Vengeance is mine! You are all ants and I am your destroyer, haha.
REPORTER
The Disney purity ring venture will now most likely prove a marketing bust, as Mickey returns to Valhalla to slumber and feed. [Kenny offers Tammy the Grey's Anatomy DVD, but she looks at her purity ring]
TAMMY
Aw Ken, look what we've become. We're way too young to be this boring.
KENNY
(I agree. Let's put in this DVD and watch Grey's Anatomy.)
TAMMY
No! I don't want to watch Grey's Anatomy, Ken. Let's take off these rings, Ken.
KENNY
(Take off the ring? You can take off the ring??) [throws away the DVD] (Really?)
TAMMY
Let's take them off and just be kids again. There'll be plenty of time to wear rings and be boring and lame when we reach our late 30s and we're boring and lame anyway.
KENNY
(Yeah. Screw this crap!) [as one they take off their rings and throw them to the floor and hug each other]
TAMMY
Oh I feel better already!
KENNY
(Me too!)
TAMMY
What say you and me... go to TGI Fridays?
KENNY
[jumps for joy] (Woo-hoo!!) [takes her hand and runs out the door with her]
[A funeral, some days later. Father Maxi is leading the service.]
FATHER MAXI
And so, as we commit this young child to the earth, let us all be reminded that syphilis is still a deadly disease, and it can be caught even if using protection. This young boy learned the hard way that there's no guarantee... For the world of oral sex is a world...
CARTMAN
[during the eulogy] I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said.
KYLE
Well, now we know.
CARTMAN
And knowing is half the battle.
End of The Ring


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:"The Coon" rises from the trash and takes his place as a lone vigilante who wipes out crime in the town of South Park.

script:The Coon

[South Park, night. A shot of a newspaper, the South Park Herald. Some headlines are: "Crime Rate Up," "No End In Sight!!" The camera zooms out to reveal the newspaper lying on the street, hanging over the curb. Dramatic music plays as a car zooms past the paper.]
CARTMAN
[voice over] The city isn't what it used to be. It all happened so fast. Everything went to crap. It's like... everyone's sense of morals just... disappeared. Bad economy made things worse. [A shot of Tele's TV store "Closed until further notice due to BAD ECONOMY"] The jobs started drying up. Then the stores had to shut down. [a shadow runs across the screen, in a cape. Next scene: an alley looking towards the street. An Obama poster for CHANGE is shown, with WHEN? spray-painted over the word] Then a black man was elected President. He was supposed to change things. [the shadow climbs up a pipe and runs across the roof of the building opposite the alley entrance] He didn't. [next shot is that of a street under a threatening red sky] As more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear. Dark times. The city needs protection. [another alley. An aluminum trash can falls over, spilling its contents. The shadow appears on a wall, larger than life, then runs away] There is an animal that lives by night, searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage. [A rain gutter is shown. The shadow runs across the screen again, closer to the camera] To clean out the trashcan of society I've chosen to become more than a man. [another rooftop. The camera finds the shadow and zooms in on it.] I'm the hero this town needs. I am... [the shadow turns and is lit up. It's Cartman dressed as...] the Coon! [Cartman looks up to the sky, and graphics for "The Coon" pop up. Next scene, the Coon runs down a street and leaps onto the roof of a car] As the world plummets into despair the Coon fights to keep order intact. [he leaps off the car]
[A park bench in the city. A couple sits on it, the partners gazing into each other's eyes.]
JOSH
Lisa I had a really great time tonight.
LISA
I did too, Josh.
JOSH
Would you... mind very much if I kissed you?
LISA
Not at all. [they start kissing. A pair of binoculars spies them from some distance.]
THE COON
[voice over. The Coon is on the roof of a public restroom house looking through the binoculars] A woman being raped. This is what our city has been reduced to. When the money goes, the raping starts. Women are helpless... without the Coon.
LISA
O-hoh, yes Josh. Yehehessss!
THE COON
[leaps into action] Let her go!
JOSH
[points to himself] 'Scuse me?
THE COON
You aren't raping anyone tonight!
JOSH
Oh, it's a talking squirrel. [The Coon runs at him, leaps onto the bench, and starts clawing at him] Oh!
LISA
Ah!
JOSH
Oh! Ow! Wugh! Oh!
THE COON
[stops clawing and says to Lisa] Get out of here! Get to safety! [Lisa gets up and runs away screaming. The Coon gets back to clawing at Josh]
JOSH
Ugh! L-lisa! Call me! Oh! Ow!
THE COON
[voice over as he leaps off the chair and runs off] Another woman saved from rape. But how many more rapists are out there?
JOSH
[gently stroking the cuts] Oh that really stings.
[Park County Police Station, night.]
OFFICER 1
Here's that file on the Rodriguez case, detective.
SGT. YATES
Alright, things are pretty quiet out there, boys. Let's try to get caught up on some paperwork. Murphy I want you to- [his eyes widen at something behind Murphy. It's... The Coon, perched on an open window. Murphy turns to look and does a double-take]
THE COON
Don't let the city's peacefulness fool you, commissioner! It's too quiet.
SGT. YATES
Oh, not this kid again.
OFFICER 1
Hey, you get out of here. Out.
THE COON
There was another rapist in the park tonight. [jumps into the station] It's no coincidence. It must be a rapist plot and it stinks to the top.
SGT. YATES
What?
THE COON
I think the Mayor might be involved. It's my theory she might have a lesbian lover who's holding her leash.
SGT. YATES
Jesus Christ, [looks at the other detectives] can we get a lock on that window? [he turns to look at the Coon] Look kid, you need to stop- [his eyes widen again. Murphy looks over his shoulder again - The Coon is gone, and the window curtains softly sway]
OFFICER 1
He's gone.
THE COON
[steps out from behind a file cabinet at the other end of the floor] No, I'm just over here now. [all the detectives turn to face him] What do we know about the Mayor's sexual preferences?
SGT. YATES
Alright, listen: you have five seconds to leave or we're gonna put you in the jail and call your parents!
OFFICER 1
Jail's full, sir.
SGT. YATES
Whatever. Then we'll just put you in- [is surprised again. The other detectives are also surprised, as the Coon isn't by the file cabinet anymore.]
THE COON
[appears by the window again] Now I'm back over here.
SGT. YATES
[walks towards the window] Just get out of here before we-! [another surprised look. The camera looks at an empty floor space]
THE COON
I'm right here now. [the camera moves to the right until he appears]
SGT. YATES
All right, stop it!
THE COON
Yes, I have to go now. [turns to the window, reaches over and grabs a box, and carries it over to the officers] But in the meantime I have something that might interest you. [turns and walks back to the window] Make sure all your men get a look at these, detective!
SGT. YATES
What's in here? [two of his officers walk over to open the box. The window is shown again and the Coon is gone. The officers open the box and pull out some shirts - "Who is the Coon?" and the Coon mask are on the front of the shirts]
[Neighborhood bus stop, day. Stan, Kenny, and Kyle wait for the bus. Cartman walks up to them.]
CARTMAN
Hey guys. Good morning. [the guys don't respond to him at all] You guys... hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night? They say it was the Coon.
STAN
Who's the Coon?
CARTMAN
I know, right? [enunciating] "Who is the Coon?" It's what everyone must be asking themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands. As for me, I certainly don't agree with the Coon's reckless ways. If you ask me, there's no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the Coon is a menace.
KYLE
...Yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway.
CARTMAN
[stunned, turns to Kyle and points] You're a fag, Kyle! Fuck you!
KYLE
...Dude, what?!
CARTMAN
He's not a fag!
KYLE
Why do you care?
CARTMAN
[straightens up and moves off a bit] Oh. I uh... well I ah ah [crosses his arms] I'm just... I'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term "fag," Kyle. That's a hate word. And it's insensitive to butt pirates. Anyway, what do you think about the Coon, Stan and Kenny? Do you think he's the savior this town needs or do you think he's a dangerous vigilante? [neither of them answer him] Kenny?
[South Park Elementary, day. Cartman is giving an oral report on the Coon, in the form of a FAQ.]
CARTMAN
And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he? [he's wearing a "Who is the Coon?" shirt] Is he a hero or a menace? [half the class is bored, and Clyde is asleep at his desk. Mr. Garrison reads quietly at his desk] While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other... "Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right?" What we all need now- [spots the sleeper] Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is important. [Clyde wakes up and looks around in a daze] What we all need now is PROOF... that the Coon exists. I believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 5:45 the Coon is going to be on the roof of Walgreens. I know I'll be there with my camera. And I'm sure... many of you will, too.
[Walgreen's rooftop, that night. The Coon stands near the edge of the roof waiting for spectators.]
THE COON
[voice over] Sometimes it seems the more criminals I try to stop, the more just come out of the back alleys and dilapidated bars. The city is a dying whore. She calls out to me to save her. And I don't know if I can. But she is still my city. [another little superhero walks up to the edge of roof a few feet from the Coon] And I cannot just sit and watch as innocent peole are- [the Coon notices] Who the hell is that? [looks the new hero over a few times, then walks up to him and asks] Who the hell are you?
M
[this hero wears an M on his shirt and a ? on his hood] I'm an angel keeping watch over the city at night. As violence and darkness take over the streets, I work to rid this city of crime. I'm the symbol this town needs.
THE COON
Aw nonononono, I am the symbol this town needs! [M ignores him] Dude, seriously, you can't do that! Go home! I was, I was doing this first!
M
Nuh uh.
THE COON
Yeah huh! You heard of the Coon and now you're being a copycat. Is that your name? Copycat?
M
I am Mysterion.
THE COON
Mysterion? That's fucking retarded! You just gave yourself away, Craig! Only you would think of a name that dumb!
MYSTERION
I might be Craig, and then again I might not be. My identity must remain a secret. You cannot know.
THE COON
Yeah? Well you cannot know my true identity either.
MYSTERION
I assume you must be Cartman, because you're fat.
THE COON
[thinks for a few seconds] Well you're wrong! I'm not Eric Cartman and he's not fat! Care to guess again?!
MYSTERION
I really don't care who you are.
THE COON
Oh all right Kyle! Yeah, took me real long to figure it out! Only you, Kyle, would be a buzzkill, and try to steal my thunder! You don't care about stopping crime, you're just doing this... 'cause you hate me, Kyle!
MYSTERION
Kyle hates Eric Cartman. Are you saying you're Eric Cartman?
THE COON
No, I'm no- I [makes his voice gruff again] I'm sayin' that... Goddammit Stan is that you? It is you, isn't it? Clyde? Clyde, you're not a superhero, I am!
MYSTERION
I cannot stand here and make idle conversation any longer. The city needs my help. There are innocents to protect. [leaps off the roof and out of view]
THE COON
NO! Dude, I'm seriously! You're being a copycat! I'll sue you! [no one replies] Motherfucker!
[South Park Elementary playground, day. The camera looks at various kids at play.]
CARTMAN
[voice over. He's seated alone on a merry-go-round] Which one of them is it? Somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero! But who? Has to be one of the guys in my class, 'cause only they knew that the Coon would be on the rooftop of Walgreens. [shuts his eyes] No, stop. Can't think about that right now. Have to focus. [opens his eyes, keeping a look of determination on his face] Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate.
[Tomorrow arrives, and the Airport Hilton is shown. Event for that day, Coonicon.]
[The Airport Hilton. Inside, The Coon has set up a convention for himself. A framed poster announced the Coon, Live and In Person.]
THE COON
[alone in the room] How is it that nobody came to Coonicon 09? This is just, this is fucking ridiculous!
MAITRE D
Got everything you need here, sir? Okay on beverages, buffet items?
THE COON
Yes, it's fine!
MAITRE D
Great. Hey, I just want to say that the Airport Hilton really appreciates your continued business.
THE COON
What do you mean "continued"? You don't know who I am!
MAITRE D
Aren't you that little boy who had his ginger pride rally and his AIDS benefit here, before?
THE COON
No, I'm not that kid!
MAITRE D
Oh. Oh oh really? Oh my bad. I'm actually relieved. That kid was kind of a douchebag.
THE COON
[looks back at him] You're a fucking douchebag! Get outta here!
[Cartman's house, night. Cartman returns home from the Coonicon depressed. He walks in slowly and kicks the door shut.]
CARTMAN
[sadly] Hunh!
LIANE
Oh, hello sweetie. What did you do today?
CARTMAN
I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices!
LIANE
[puts her left hand on his right shoulder] Aww, what happened, hun?
CARTMAN
I can't tell you what happened 'cause it's about my super secret double life!
[A Channel 9 Newscast begins.]
ANCHOR
Tonight an incredible story of an unknown child in South Park who has taken to the streets in an effort to fight crime.
CARTMAN
[suddenly hopeful, looks at the TV] Wha, what?
ANCHOR
But who exactly is... Mysterion? [a silhouette appears, but it doesn't look like the Coon's]
CARTMAN
[angrily] What?!
ANCHOR
Curious crowds in the town of South Park, Colorado. [people mill around looking for pictures of Mysterion to take] They've brought binoculars and camera phones trying to get a shot of a mysterious superhero.
MAN 1
Uh, he was dressed mostly in black with a kind of... cloak.
WOMAN 1
He jumped down from the fire escape stairs, and then he just ran off. We barely got a look at him.
MAN 2
To me it looked like Mysterion to me. Everyone who's seen Mysterion, say yeah!
CROWD
Yeah! [the man grins, showing off some gold teeth]
MAN 3
Well I, I think he's kind of a symbol for the town, you know? A, a symbol that everyone who's sick of crime can uh can rally behind.
CARTMAN
Fuckin' butthole!
MAN 4
[behind the wheel] Well if you ask me, he's a menace. There's no room for vigilantism in today's world!
REPORTER
[showing some "AMATEUR SKETCH" images worthy of a graphic novel] This artist rendition of Mysterion has already generated thousands of copies.
CARTMAN
You gotta be kidding me!
REPORTER
As hundreds of people gather to try and get a glimpse of the superhero, one question remains: Who is Mysterion? [everyone around him begins to ask the same question]
ANCHOR
If you have any idea about the true identity of Mysterion, please call the 9 News Hotline.
CARTMAN
[shakes in anger] AAAAAHT!! [turns right and leaves in a huff]
[News stand, night. The headline on today's South Park Herald: "Who Is Mysterion?" The camera pulls back to reveal Mysterion looking around and running down the sidewalk across the street.]
MYSTERION
[voice over] I could no longer sit by and watch as my city became a cesspool of crime. [a shot of City Hall. Mysterion appears on the roof by the dome] I have lived in South Park all my life. I decided it was up to me to keep this town safe. [he leaps off the roof and soon climbs up a rain gutter] Nobody at school knows my double life. To them, I'm just another fourth grader. But tonight, I am Mysterion. [climbs in through a window ...into the police station.]
[Park County Police Station.]
SGT. YATES
Oh, Mysterion, thank God you've come. What news do you have?
MYSTERION
There's some graffiti on the bridge again. I think those sixth grade kids are doing it. And the guy at the movie theater is harassing Mexicans again.
OFFICER 2
We'll get right on it, Mysterion. Thank you. Thank you for all your help. [Mysterion climbs out the window and goes down the fire escape ladder. The officer walks over to the window] Godspeed, Mysterion!
SGT. YATES
You are a beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak and dreary world! [as Mysterion walks away from the police station, the Coon jumps into his path.]
THE COON
Dude, seriously? I'm gonna kick the shit out of you if you don't stop!
MYSTERION
This city needs my help. It cries for protection and I will-
MYSTERION, THE COON
Answer the call to save her.
THE COON
That's what I'm supposed to say! I know it's you, Kyle. Just stop!
MYSTERION
I don't have time for this. [brings out some fireworks and lights the fuse. He drops the fireworks on the ground and leaves. They pop up and deter the Coon from following him. When the smoke clears the Coon looks around and doesn't see anyone.]
THE COON
Fireworks are illegal in Colorado, you asshole! [to the officers on the second floor] Hey, he's got fireworks!
[South Park Elementary, day. A pissed-off Cartman, wearing his "Who is the Coon?" T-shirt, walks down the hall until he finds his classmates.]
CARTMAN
So, guys! Any of you do anything interesting last night?!
STAN
Not really.
CARTMAN
Really?! Nobody was playing with any fireworks?! [grabs Stan's right hand and sniffs it vigorously, then lets it go and looks around for other suspects]
STAN
Dude, what the hell?
CARTMAN
Aha! Kenny! I should have known! [walks over to Kenny's locker and points] Why do you have a picture of Mysterion in your locker, Kenny?! [points at Kenny] Unless you are Mysterion!
STAN
[opens his door to demonstrate something] Dude, I have a picture of Mysterion in my locker too.
CLYDE
Yeah, so do I.
CARTMAN
What?! Why?
CLYDE
I don't know, it's just a cool costume.
CARTMAN
It's not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking pants! Now, come on, which one of you guys is it?!
WENDY
[walking by] How are you so sure Mysterion is a boy?
CARTMAN
[gasps and walks away a bit to watch Wendy leave] Fucking bitch...
[U Stor It storage facility, night. Two pigeons perched on the top of the sign suddenly take wing.]
THE COON
[voice over] I had no choice. [he peeks out from behind a building, then runs] I was at the end of my rope. [he hears a sound and turns to its direction] Sometimes when a superhero needs answers, he has to turn to the wretched underbelly of society.
A VOICE
Hahahahahahahahaaa... Look what the cat dragged in.
THE COON
Come out where I can see you!
A VOICE
What's the matter, Coon? Nervous?
THE COON
[voice over] I didn't want to resort to this, but he could have the answers I need.
A VOICE
How utterly delightful! The heroic and mighty Coon [Professor Chaos leaps into view] come to put a stop to me again.
THE COON
[voice over] Chaos. I need to keep on my toes. [speaks] I'm not here to stop you this time, Chaos! I need information.
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Oh I'm sure you do. But you see I [almost trips on his cape] whoop. [recovers] But you see I also know you like to beat me up.
THE COON
I didn't call you to fight, Chaos! I came to see if you know Mysterion's identity. [the two adversaries begin to circle each other]
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Oh I'm close. And I'll put an end to him, and all of you goody-two-shoe heroes!
THE COON
I'm not on his side!
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Do you think I'm a fool?! All those times you stopped me from my acts of evil! All those times you tricked me into meeting you, and then ga- and then gave me titty-twisters! Not this time, Coon! I finally learned my lesson! Now, General Disarray! [General Disarray holds a rope on the roof behind the Coon at the end of the storage building. He jumps down and swings towards the Coon and knocks him down] Yeah-ha! [General Disarray tries to keep the Coon on the ground.]
THE COON
That's it! [stands up]
PROFESSOR CHAOS
O- oh careful General Disarray.
THE COON
Agh- Stop it! You, you... butthole! Knock it off!
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Hehyeah! We beat him, General Disarray! [General Disarray has the Coon in a choke hold]
THE COON
Listen to me! I want to... help you... get rid of Mysterion!
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Let him go, General Disarray! [General Disarray lets go and hops off. Professor Chaos puts his fists to his waist] Why would you help us?!
THE COON
Because Mysterion is trying to [bumps General Disarray off. General Disarray strikes a couple of trash cans and gets up a bit dazed] You fucker, that fuckin' hurt! [turns towards Professor Chaos] Because Mysterion is trying to say he's the hero this town needs! But that's my job!
PROFESSOR CHAOS
But you both fight for justice and good.
THE COON
Yeah, but he's a fuckin' dick! I want him gone just as much as you do!
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Very well. I will show you what we know about Mysterion's identity, but if this is some kind of setup-
THE COON
N- I'm the good guy, Chaos. I don't betray people.
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Weh- oh yeah. [turns and walks away. General Disarray walks away also, and the Coon follows them]
THE COON
[voice over] I didn't like having to work with this scumbag. But I knew Mysterion was out there, plotting his next move.
[Kyle's room, night. Kyle sits at his desk deep in thought.]
MYSTERION
[on Kyle's bed] Hello Kyle.
KYLE
[looks, then jumps in his seat] Whoa, what the?
MYSTERION
Do not be afraid. I mean you no harm.
KYLE
Hey. Hey, you're that Mysterion kid.
MYSTERION
Yes. But now I believe someone is trying to learn my true identity.
KYLE
Dude, everyone's trying to figure out who you are.
MYSTERION
[turns away from Kyle] I cannot be unmasked, for then I would stop being a symbol. I need help. Somebody who can do background checks for me, do some investigating.
KYLE
Who? Me? Why?
MYSTERION
Because I think you are the smartest kid in class. [looks over his shoulder. Kyle just stands there.]
[U Stor It storage facility, night.]
PROFESSOR CHAOS
This way! We will now show you our secret headquarters of DOOM.
THE COON
You guys have your own storage facility?
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Actually it belongs to General Disarray's grandma, um but she lets us use it. [General Disarray removes the lock from the unit and tries to lift the door. Professor Chaos helps him out and holds the door open as General Disarray and the Coon enter, then enters and lets the door drop closed behind them. Professor Chaos leads the Coon through the unit] This is where we come up with all our evil plans. Here's our computer relays. [a TV on a large stereo console with a toy keyboard attached] And this is like a, a cube of chaos that can destroy the world in one second! [an unsolved Rubik's Cube under glass, on a table from which a sign hangs: WARNING DO NOT TOUCH!] And here's some of our evil minions! [hamsters] We have everything we need here. Can I offer you a Coke or a Sprite or something?
THE COON
I'll take a Sprite.
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Uhget the Coon a Sprite, General Disarray. [General Disarray leaves to get the Sprite while Professor Chaos takes the Coon to a wall with pictures of the other guys in class on it] As you can see we too have been working hard on Mysterion's identity.
THE COON
You have an entire wall dedicated to Mysterion? What about...? Do you, do you still have that "Who Is The Coon?" T-shirt I gave you?
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Oh yeah, I think it's around here somewhere. Uh, using our photos we are tryin' to pinpoint Mysterion's identity.
THE COON
Why is Cartman crossed out? He, he could be Mysterion.
PROFESSOR CHAOS
No, he's too fat. Based on his body type it's gotta be someone like Stan or Kyle. [The Coon turns away, insulted, but his eyes pop open as he sees who the Coon suspects are: Harvey Fierstein, Cartman, and Bruce Vilanch. It just makes him angrier]
THE COON
Alright, al, alright, alright, look, Chaos. Just set up a video camera. I know how we can put an end to Mysterion once and for all.
[Channel Nine News splash screen comes up.]
ANCHOR
The clock is ticking and the citizens of South Park are gripped in fear. Two days ago an evil unknown terrorist threatened major consequences if Mysterion [a pic of Mysterion appears] does not reveal his identity.
PROFESSOR CHAOS
[from his headquarters, reading a prepared statement] Mark my words, South Park! Your precious hero is now, uh, your undoing! If Mysterion does not unmask himself publicly by Wednesday night, I am going to blow up... a hospital. Blow up a hospital? [looks off to his right] I'm not gonna blow up any hospital. Are you nuts? What? [turns to the camera] Uh, the choice is yours, Mysterion! Unmask yourself or hundreds will die! Hahaha. [looks off to his right again] Jesus Christ.
ANCHOR
Since the threat was issued there has been no sign of Mysterion. Where is Mysterion?
ANCHOR 2
[through his teeth] Where is Mysterion?
[On the first floor of a construction site. Chaos, Coon, and Disarray are there with lots of TNT piled up around them. There are no walls up, so the floor is open.]
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Hey Coon w-we aren't actually gonna blo- blow up anything, are we?
THE COON
If you don't make good on your threats, Chaos, then what good are your threats?
PROFESSOR CHAOS
But you really wanna blow up a hospital? I mean, a-aren't you a good guy?
THE COON
Sometimes blowing up hospitals is for the greater good, Chaos.
GENERAL DISARRAY
[walks up to Professor Chaos] You know, I've been thinking: if we're really evil villains, then we should betray him, and blow him up with the hospital.
THE COON
You know, you're a little scrotum-licker dude! Why don't you shut the fuck up?! [turns and runs to the edge of the floor] Alright Chaos, I'm gonna get the triggers for these things at ACE Hardware. Keep an eye on this stuff! [jumps down to the ground]
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Aww jeez General Disarray, this is a lot more than I ever really intended. [General Disarray almost loses his balance twice, but recovers both times] I mean, well I hate the world and all its puny inhabitants and all but, but blowin' up a hospital? It just seems mean. [a shadow spreads across the floor before them. They look towards the shadow's source and find Mysterion standing on a beam above them. Chaos gasps] Whoa. Oh hamburgers!
GENERAL DISARRAY
AAAGH! [runs away to the other end of the floor and behind some boxes of TNT]
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Aaah, a m m Mysterion, I b-, I beg you, I mean ah, judahadahada...
MYSTERION
Why are you doing this?! This isn't your usual MO, Chaos!
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Whowell I b- Well I b- ah I just would jes one nigh-, and then the Coon saw it up and I wa able to, and was able to [begins to mumble and fade out]
[On the street below people walk along the sidewalks unaware of anything happening above them until a scream is heard.]
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Waaugh!
MAN 5
What is that?
[On the construction site Professor Chaos and Mysterion fight.]
MAN 6
Look! Mysterion and Professor Chaos are fighting!
MAN 7
Give him hell, Mysterion! [more people appear and begin cheering the fight. General Disarray returns to help Professor Chaos]
WOMAN 2
Look out Mysterion! General Disarray is behind you! [General Disarray grabs onto Mysterion's left leg]
OFFICER 3
Jesus Christ, we need backup out here! [a police car pulls up as he says this. A sniper tries to train his scope on Professor Chaos]
OFFICER 4
I think I can get a shot at Chaos, sir.
SGT. YATES
[stays his officer's rifle] You think your bullets can hurt him? [Chaos and Disarray have defeated Mysterion, who lies unconscious on his back against some open bags of plaster. The crowd below gasps]
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Yeah, we did it!
MAN 8
[breaking the crowd's silence] He's dead. Mysterion is dead.
WOMAN 3
Nooo... [begins to sob. Other begin to sob too]
REPORTER
The impossible has happened. Mysterion, beloved protector of the city, is dead. Who will save us now?
MAN 9
Wait! Look! [Mysterion begins to move and wakes up]
OFFICER 4
He's all right! [the crowd cheers and the battle between Mysterion and Chaos resumes, with Disarray trying to restrain Mysterion. Mysterion throws him off, and Disarray runs away again]
CARTMAN
[offscreen] Oh my God, look everyone, it's the Coon!
THE COON
[walking up a ramp to the first floor] Fear not everyone! Coon is here to save the day.
MAN 10
Isn't that Bruce Vilanch?
MAN 11
Be careful Bruce Vilanch! There are superhumans fighting right over there!
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Okay sorry sorry! I'm sorry! I give up! Please, I give up!
THE COON
Don't worry, Mysterion! [Mysterion gets off Chaos and Chaos stands up] The Coon will now help you!
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Well, wait! I thought we were workin' together. [the Coon punches him in the mouth] Waaa. [sprouts a bloody nose] Oh jeez, I think I broke a tooth. [covers his face, turns left and runs out of view, mumbling. The crowd cheers some more]
THE COON
That was great teamwork, Mysterion. South Park is safe. Until next time.
MYSTERION
What next time?
THE COON
Well, people are obviously so desperate to learn your identity that they'll do anything. Won't be long before the next villain comes along and threatens violence unless you take off your mask. [Mysterion gives this some thought.]
[Park County Police Station. Mysterion stands at a podium flanked by the Coon and the Park County police.]
MYSTERION
Citizens, tonight has shown me I have no choice but to unmask myself.
SGT. YATES
Don't do it, Mysterion! If you show your identity we'll be forced to arrest you for being a vigilante!
THE COON
Don't you think he knows that?! But superheroes know that sometimes you have to sacrifice yourself for the greater good.
MAN 12
Don't show your face, Mysterion!
MAN 13
You have to be a symbol!
THE COON
So that the next terrorist can threaten South Park if he doesn't unmask himself?!
MYSTERION
No, it's true. As long as my identity is a mystery, this will just happen again and again. It has to end. I will show my face. [the camera zooms in on him as he gets ready to remove his mask. As soon as he shows his eyes and nose, the camera stops]
CROWD
Ohhh.
MAN 14
[holding a camera] Well I'll be.
THE COON
I knew it was you! 'Member I even said it before!
MR. GARRISON
Wow, a kid from my class was Mysterion.
SGT. YATES
Well I'm sorry but you're under arrest. Take the kid to jail. [hands Mysterion over to Murphy, who escorts him away]
THE COON
[voice over] My entire plan worked to perfection. [holds up his right hand] My work here is done. [leaps away, then appears on the roof of a building] With Mysterion out of the way the Coon can finally go back to keeping the city safe. [runs across the roof and leaps down, holding on to the sides of a ladder. He leaps off the bottom of the ladder and plants his right hand on the ground] Once again, I alone am the symbol this town can stand behind. [he eats a burger meal at a fast food restaurant] Every town needs a hero. [walks down a street towards sunset] Every town needs... a Coon. [looks back at the camera, then turns away and resumes walking. Last scene has the Coon riding down the street on his Big Coon Wheel tricycle]
End of The Coon

synopsis:Randy steps forward with a solution to fix the desperate state of the economy.

script:Margaritaville

[A new building - South Park Bank Savings and Loans. A line of customers waits to advance. Stan and Randy are at the head of the line.]
STAN
Do I really have to do this, Dad?
RANDY
Stan, now more than ever you need to understand the importance of saving money.
STAN
But Grandma said I could use this money to buy whatever I want.
BENNY
Okay, next please.
RANDY
Go on, Stanley. [Stan walks up to Benny's desk and takes a seat.]
BENNY
How can I help you, young man?
STAN
I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years.
BENNY
Well that's fantastic, a really smart decision, young man. We can put that check in a Money Market Mutual Fund, then we'll reinvest the earnings into foreign currency accounts with compounding interest aaand it's gone. [they look at each other for a long time]
STAN
Uh, what?
BENNY
It's gone. It's all gone.
STAN
What's all gone?
BENNY
The money in your account - it didn't do too well, it's gone.
STAN
What do you mean? I have a hundred dollars.
BENNY
Not anymore you don't. POOF.
STAN
Well, what can I do to get back my money-?
BENNY
I'm sorry sir, but this line is for bank members only.
STAN
I just opened an account.
BENNY
Do you have any money invested in this bank?
STAN
No, you just lost it all!
BENNY
Then please stand aside for people who actually have money with us. Next please. [an elderly woman steps up and bumps Stan out of the chair.]
STAN
Hey!
BENNY
Hello Mrs. Farnickle, how are you today? Making a deposit are we? Great, we can just put that into your retirement account and make it go to work for you aaaaand it's gone.
MRS. FARNICKLE
What?
BENNY
Sorry, yeah, that's gone. Please step aside for people who actually have money with the bank. Next please.
STAN
Dad!
RANDY
Hey I'm trying to teach my son the importance of savings. You already lost his money?
BENNY
Oh, Mr. Marsh, don't worry. We can just transfer money from your account into a portfolio with your son's-- aaand it's gone! This line is for people who have money with the bank only. Please step aside! [both Randy and Stan are dumbstruck.]
[Breaking news. A 9 News Special Report graphic appears.]
ANNOUNCER
This is a 9 News Special Report. RECESSION: A NATION IN PERIL.
ANCHOR
An economic crisis has hit South Park and the nation like never before. Another South Park bank has closed down, leaving thousands of people in debt.
MR. GARRISON
[in front of a convenience store] It's just crazy, you know? Ev-everyone's affected by it. It's like all the money just... vanished.
STEPHEN
[in front of the Stotch home] It's really terrifying. We... we've got no money to pay our mortgage now. We could very easily lose our house!
BUTTERS
[waves to the camera, but his face is blocked by the 9 News logo] Hi, Grandma!
DARRYL WEATHERS
First the money started goin', and now everyone's gettin' laid off work! They took arrr jawbs!
WORKER 1
They took our jobs!
WORKER 2
[shrieking] Derk er derrrrrr!
WORKER 3
Deeekerrdrrr!
WORKER 4
Deeerkerrrrrrdrrrr!
ANCHOR
Just how far will the economy fall? We asked economic reporter Dan Banks for his assessment. [a shot of Dan, who raises a gun to his head and fires, shooting his brains out and falling out of view.] We'll have the rest of Dan's interview tonight at 10.
[The Marsh house, dinnertime. Sharon walks in with the simplest dinner: hot dogs and sliced tomatoes. Everyone has a glass of water or soda, Randy has a margarita glass.]
SHARON
All right everyone, eat up. [takes her seat]
RANDY
Aw Jesus Christ! Sliced hot dogs and tomato slices?!
SHARON
You said we had to be careful with our money. I've got nothing for a food budget.
STAN
Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money?
RANDY
[grabs a hot dog from the platter] I'll tell you what happened, son. See, there's a bunch of idiots out there who weren't happy with what they had. [slaps the hot dog onto his own plate] They wanted a bigger house and materialistic things that they didn't even need-- [grabs his margarita glass and rises from the table] people with no money who got loans to buy frivolous things they had no business buying. [walks over to a Margaritaville margarita blender and loads it with ice. A margarita mix is already in place in the blender] And these assholes just blindly started buying any stupid thing that looked appealing, [puts the ice scooper back into the ice bucket] 'cause they thought money was endless! [starts up the blender, which drowns out whatever he says for the next nine seconds] It goes back to when the government had the idea that everyone in America deserves to own a house. So we have people having a hard time paying their loans, [the blender stops] meaning less money coming in. [serves himself a margarita and places the blender back on its base] And the idiots couldn't see that by doing all this frivolous spending they were mocking the Economy. And they made the Economy very angry. [goes back to his seat with his margarita] We're all feeling the Economy's vengeance because of materialistic heathens who did stupid things with their money! Do you understand, son? [sips from his margarita glass]
STAN
Yeah, I think I get it.
[The South Park Mall, day. Anyone who has something to say about the economy is preaching to the crowd gathered there.]
ORATOR 1
And so why is our economy failing us? Because the government kept interest rates too low for too long! The government took our economy for granted and now we are all here paying the price! How long will we sit and watch our economy fall... As the people we must...
ORATOR 2
...An angel came to me and so I say to you: Do not listen to the Wall Street brokers! For they are the ones that put us in this situation! Fat cats with corporate greed! They are the ones who knowingly drove us down this pathway of doom! Our responsibility is...
CARTMAN
And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft...
RANDY
[dressed in a drab green toga] There are different people casting all different kinds of blame from person to person. But the fault lies in all of you! [starts pointing at random people] YOU, who bought that three hundred thousand dollar house when you only had twenty thousand to put down? YOU, who bought that third car, even though only two people in your home drive! It is time to stop pointing fingers! [speeds up his rate of pointing] Finger pointing gets us nowhere, Steve! We have mocked our Economy. And now the Economy has cast its vengeance upon us all!
MAN 1
He's right.
MAN 2
This is the first guy to actually make sense. [more people are attracted to Randy's preaching]
RANDY
Yea, it is an angry and unforgiving Economy. To repent we must stop frivolous spending! Instead of paying for cable let us watch clouds! Instead of buying clothes, wear but sheets from thine beds! Cut spending to only the bare essentials! Water and bread and margaritas, yea. [everyone applauds softly]
[Sur la Table, day. Stan walks in with the Margaritaville and heads to the counter.]
CLERK
Hello young man, welcome to Sur la Tahbluh. Can I help you?
STAN
Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought.
CLERK
Oh, that's all we get anymore, returns. Could you please just put the receipt here on this tahbluh. [Stan tries to put the receipt onto the counter, but the large Margaritaville gets in the way. Stan then just reaches up and the clerk takes the receipt] Sorry, our computers are a little slow today. We need a new Ethernet cahbluh. Oh, I'm sorry, sir, I'd like to give you a refund but I'm afraid it's not doahbluh.
STAN
What?
CLERK
I said I'm not ahbluh, sir. You see, this Margaritaville was purchased with a payment plan?
STAN
So?
CLERK
Well an outside financing company handles those payment plans. Customers just pay for some of the machine and the finance company pays for the rest.
STAN
Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back?
CLERK
[rests his head on his left hand] Hm... that's improbahbluh, [raises his left hand] but not impossibluh. I'm not really sure how it works; you'll, you'll have to speak with the people at the top. I can give you the finance company's address if that... agreeahbluh with you. [Stan just looks at him]
[South Park Mall exterior, just after sunset. Randy is on a table pacing back and forth, again dressed in a toga.]
RANDY
We have become lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of the Economy! There are those who will say that the Economy has forsaken us! Nay! You have forsaken the Economy!! And now you know the Economy's wrath! O thoust can shop at a sporting goods store, but knowest thou that the Economy will take away thy Broncos' cap from thine head! [a shot of the Stotches in togas] Mock the Economy without fear! Thine own stockbrokers... now lie dead by their own hand and thou knowest that thy stockbrokers did not fear the Economy! Well here we are, my friends! You have brought the Economy's vengeance upon yourselves!
GERALD
What can we do, Randy?
MAN 3
Yes tell us.
MAN 4
Tell us.
MAN 5
Tell us what to do.
MAN 6
Tell us, Randy, what we should do!
MAN 7
What should we do, Randy?!
RANDY
We must all wear sheets instead of buying clothes that need detergent! Instead of cars that take gasoline we can... get around on llamas from Drake's farm! Instead of video games that take batteries and software, our kids will play with squirrels! We must let the Economy know that we are capable of respecting it! No more needless spending! [everyone begins to cheer] The Economy is our shepherd. We shall not want. [stretches out his arms as the audience cheers him on.]
[South Park, sometime later. Everyone is wearing blankets instead of clothes, in the forms of togas and cloaks. People have begun to ride llamas, carry stuff in wooden boxes, and leave bales of hay around for the llamas and oxen. Businesses all along the street have shuttered their doors and windows and gone out of business. It's a much simpler way of living.]
AL
[on a llama] Mornin' Ted.
TED
[shoveling snow off his walkway] Mornin' Al.
[At a park nearby, the boys sit on rocky surfaces dressed in togas and being bored. Butters tries to fish for squirrels, but none of the squirrels are biting.]
KYLE
Well this sucks!
CLYDE
Sure was better when our parents were buyin' us stuff.
CARTMAN
[arrives and sighs] Hengh! [the squirrels run off] Of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things, it had to be the week that Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out for Nintendo DS! [stomps his left foot down] Hengh!
KYLE
You want something new every week, fatass.
CARTMAN
[leaps towards him] Don't you fraternize me! This is all your fault, you know!
KYLE
My fault?
CARTMAN
The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-!
KYLE
[jumps off his rocky perch and faces Cartman] Don't even start! Don't even start, Cartman!
BUTTERS
Well, [Kyle looks back at him] why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle?
KYLE
Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that?
BUTTERS
Well Eric did. [Kyle glares at Cartman again]
CARTMAN
Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle.
KYLE
Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it. [the other boys now pay attention to Kyle. Two men watch Kyle from afar.] What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go out and shop. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family.
MAN 8
We best speak with the Council, and tell them... a young Jew is speaking heresy towards the Economy.
[Big Orange Finance Company, day. Stan reaches its glass doors and pushes his way in backwards, then turns around and walks up to the receptionist's desk.]
RECEPTIONIST
Can I help you?
STAN
I wanna return this Margaritaville.
RECEPTIONIST
O-kay, let me send you into Josh. [next shot is of Josh dipping his finger into a little can of Carmex and spreading it on his lips]
JOSH
Heeey, welcome to Big Orange Finance Company, yeah. Have a seat. You want some Carmex?
STAN
No thanks. I wanna return this Margaritaville, and the guy at Sur la Table said that you were the company that financed it.
JOSH
Oh yeah no, you know what? No, yeah.
STAN
What?
JOSH
Yeah, we can't give you your money back for that, yeah, no. You'd have to talk to the people on Wall Street, yeah, mmmm.
STAN
Wall Street?
JOSH
Yeah, no, see, what I do is find Americans who want a frozen beverage machine but can't afford one, and I hook them up with investors who want to get into the margarita bill payment plan business, yeah.
STAN
So?
JOSH
Yeah, so the problem is your Margaritaville payment plan has been combined with thousands of others into one big Margaritaville security, yeah, no. Yeah. No. Yeah... [Stan sighs in frustration]
[Park County Community Center, day. Llamas wait in the parking lot with hay bales near them as toga-clad adults walk towards the center's doors. Inside, a council of nine sits in the dark. Six candles give light to two tables. Randy sits on a throne.]
STEPHEN
The entire town has given over to your ways, Mr. Chairman. Everyone has even stopped using electricity so as to stop paying electrical bills.
FATHER MAXI
You've really done an amazing thing, Mr. Marsh. People have learned to hold on to their money so as not to feel the sting of the Economy's mighty sword.
RANDY
I am pretty smart, yea. But I have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan.
SKEETER
We've got guards posted at the mall to make sure nobody gets tempted to buy dumb stuff. And, uh, Pat Sallsman is doin' house checks to make sure nobody is ordering anything stupid online.
RANDY
Then perhaps soon our Economy will return to us.
MAN 9
Council, I bring news of discord! A young Jew was in the town square speaking blasphemy about the Economy!
RANDY
What?!
MAN 9
He was saying that... your ideas are false and the Economy is not vengeful. He was rallying people to spend more!
FATHER MAXI
Spend more?! What mockery is this?!
RANDY
Relax, Father Maxi. What harm can one Jew do against our... economic recovery movement?
[The same park as before. The squirrels are back, Cartman joins the other boys on the rocks, resting against one.]
CARTMAN
I had a dream last night. I was in a field, and I had Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars right next to me. But then the sky went black and ...Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars just... melted in my hand. [begins to sob, and a rowdy crowd approaches from the right]
KYLE
What's that? [a crowd of men runs past them, snatching up squirrels on the way]
MAN 10
'Scuse me, we need to borrow your squirrels.
KYLE
What? [the boys stand and follow the men]
MR. GARRISON
Now please, please! [holds his arms up in self-defense]
MAN 10
You have sinned!
MR. GARRISON
Oh Jesus, I'm sorry. Please.
KYLE
What's going on?
MAN 10
Garrison, you have brought your filth to this town for the last time!
KYLE
What did he do?
MAN 11
Your teacher was caught buying a KitchenAid Stand Mixer at Bed Bath & Beyond!
MAN 10
Take that punishment, heathen! [the crowd begins stoning Garrison with squirrels]
KYLE
[steps in between Garrison and the crowd] Hey! Hey, stop it! Stop!
MAN 10
Move aside, kid! He must pay for his stand mixer.
KYLE
Come on, this is ridiculous!
MAN 10
What's ridiculous about hucking squirrels at a man who has angered the Economy?!
KYLE
Ju-just have a little compassion, huh? I mean, everyone's gone out and bought something stupid. It's not so bad. Whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous, go ahead and huck the next squirrel. [a man behind Principal Victoria moves and hucks a squirrel at Garrison]
MR. GARRISON
Oh. [the crowd gets rowdy again]
[Wall Street, the New York Stock Exchange. It's a busy day. Stan walks into view from the left.]
STAN
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this Margaritaville, please?
STOCKBROKER
Margaritaville?
STAN
My dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here.
STOCKBROKER
Oh, that makes sense.
STAN
It does?
STOCKBROKER
You see, son, we lump thousands of these Margaritaville installment plans together into Margaritaville-based securities, then chop those securities up in a way that we could sell them to banks.
STAN
So I can return it to a bank?
STOCKBROKER
Nope, because a bunch of people like you are defaulting on their Margaritavilles so the government had to buy the Margaritaville assets from the banks.
STAN
What?!
STOCKBROKER
Just talk to the Treasury Department in DC. They're the ones who really understand how all this works. [notices some activity on his stocks] Oh, sell sell sell sell sell sell sell!
STAN
Aargh! [walks off with the Margaritaville]
[In a meadow near town, day. Kyle has his own Sermon on the Mount.]
KYLE
Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit cards to practically anyone who applies for them. [pulls out an envelope] I applied for this yesterday to prove a point. It is an American Express Platinum card. [from Kyle's position, one can see hundreds of people listening to him] It has no spending limit. [cries of shock rise from the crowd] Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless until we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money.
[Park County Community Center. The economic recovery movement council is meeting again.]
MAN 11
By all reports, the young Jew is not letting up! He is still going around convincing people to have faith in the Economy by shopping!
RANDY
We've done everything we can and yet the Economy has not improved. Worse, it has declined! Poor Bart here just lost his job at Little Caesar's Pizza. Our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one Jew. Why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the Economy?
STEPHEN
Perhaps... he is the Economy's only Son, sent to save us.
FATHER MAXI
Are you retarded, Stotch?! The Economy is omnipotent! Which means it can do anything! So saying it would be limited to one Son is fucking stupid!
RANDY
That is stupid, yea. And going around telling people to shop... is dangerous!
MAN 12
Well then, there's only one option: we have to kill the Jew.
FATHER MAXI
Yep, I think we gotta kill the Jew.
SKEETER
I don't know... He's got a lot of support. It might be hard to even catch this Jew. [a screeching sound is heard. A hand is seen going down a blackboard. and it belongs to Cartman]
CARTMAN
Did somebody say "catch a Jew"? The person you're after might be hard to get, but I can bring him to you. And all I want in return... is Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for handheld Nintendo DS.
[The U.S. Treasury Department, day. The camera pans down from the top of the building to street level, and shows Stan walking past a statue with the Margaritaville. Stan then goes up the steps and through the domed atrium. Three men gather in front of him and face him. He stops and drops the Margaritaville to the floor.]
TREASURER 1
Uhh, how can we help you, young man?
STAN
I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!
TREASURER 1
Ohhh that makes sense.
STAN
Nnnaaargh!
TREASURER 1
No problem. We just need to consult the chart. We can determine your property's value and we'll be done.
STAN
[surprised] Really? [puts his hands together] Thank you.
TREASURER 1
Be right back. [they go into a room through the heavy double doors behind them and close the doors. A squawk is heard, then a cleaver and the sound of blood spurting out. Stan is startled. The men come back out through the doors with streaks of blood on them.]
TREASURER 2
Excellent news, sir. We've determined the investment value of your Margaritaville to be... ninety trillion dollars.
STAN
What?!
[Whistlin' Willy's Pizza Gultch. Many of the boys are inside in the dark, seated at a long table reminiscent of The Last Supper. From left to right are Craig, Timmy, Jason, Cartman, Tolkien, Kyle, Jimmy, Butters, Kenny, Tweek, Ike, and Clyde, all munching on slices of pizza. Some breadsticks are in a basket.]
JIMMY
Hey, what's the matter, Kyle? You seem b-b-bu-bbbummed out.
KYLE
I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.
BUTTERS
Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!
KYLE
I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me. [the other boys gasp and look at Kyle. Tweek and Ike look at Clyde]
CARTMAN
[stands up in his seat] All right, whoever is thinkin' of betraying Kyle, that is not cool! [checks for a reaction] That's freaking lame, dude! Kyle is trying to get the economy goin' again! If somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back, you're b-you're being a dick! [clears his throat and sits down] Go ahead, Kyle.
KYLE
[looks at Cartman for a few seconds, then enunciates] Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith.
JIMMY
Kyle please! For fu-fu for for-fu-fuck's sake, don't do anything drastic.
KYLE
There's no choice anymore, guys. Don't worry about me. I've been preparing for this for a while now. [looks down at his plate]
[The U.S. Treasury Department, day. Stan is still trying to figure things out with Treasury.]
STAN
Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?!
TREASURER 1
What, you think it's worth more?
STAN
No, dude, that doesn't make sense!
TREASURER 2
Well, you don't get ninety trillion dollars, but the chart says that's what it's worth.
TREASURER 3
[runs up to the other two treasurers] Uh oh, problem! Problem again!
TREASURER 2
What is it now?
TREASURER 3
Another insurance company is about to go under; if they do, people could lose millions!
TREASURER 1
Okay, no problem. [the three go behind the double doors again] We'd better consult the chart. [this time one of the doors is left ajar. Stan observes this and then takes the Margaritaville into the chart's room]
[The chart room. The three treasurers face three other men at the opposite end of the large chart. These other men sit in high-backed chairs and wear white wigs.]
TREASURER 3
Sirs, another insurance company is going under!
SIR 1
Now determining most prudent move for insurance company. [brings down the gavel. Treasurer 2 picks up a chicken and a meat cleaver, puts the chicken down against the edge of the chart, and chops its head off with the meat cleaver. He then drops it into the chart and it stumbles around while Treasurer 3 plays the kazoo. The headless chicken drops onto the bailout button and the button lights up and sets off a bell]
TREASURER 1
Bailout!
TREASURER 3
Most prudent move is a bailout!
SIR 1
Bail out the insurance company! [Stan is upset at this method of resolving a serious economic problem. He picks up the Margaritaville, smashes it into the chart, turns around and leaves]
[The city park, evening. A crowd is gathered for some reason...]
MAN 13
It's a miracle.
MAN 14
Why would someone do this? [members of the economic recovery council run up to see what the commotion is about]
RANDY
What is this? What's going on?
STEPHEN
There! Look! [a shot of Kyle signing papers] It's the Jew. Somehow he got a platinum AmEx with no spending limit.
RANDY
What's he doing?
STEPHEN
He's... paying for everyone's debts. [a shot of several lines of people walking up to Kyle, who takes each bill, enters the amount due into a card reader, and swipes his card through the reader to pay the debt]
DARRYL
Hey thanks, kid, this is really nice of you.
RANDY
But that's... impossible. Why would he do this?
MAN 15
So that people will have money to spend.
SHEILA
[runs up to Kyle] Kyle! [gets on her knees] Kyle, you have to stop this! [begins to cry]
KYLE
It's okay, Ma.
SHEILA
No-o Kyle, you'll be in debt for the rest of your life! [stands up and walks away] Please, somebody, get him to sto-o-op! [Randy gets an idea, points towards his house, and leaves. More people walk towards Kyle, and this continues for hours. Kyle begins to moan from lack of energy as he continues paying off debts]
RANDY
[returns with his unpaid bills] Uh there's about seventeen thousand dollars' worth here.
KYLE
[pays it off, with difficulty.] Heunh. [Randy smiles and walks away]
MAN 16
He paid for our debts so we could spend once more. [Kyle has stopped moving. A man steps up to check]
MAN 17
He's dead.
DR. DOCTOR
[steps up to check Kyle's pulse] No, he's just passed out. We should get him to bed. [several men raise Kyle over their heads and gently carry him home. Sheila sobs and follows them. They all go through the living room, up the stairs, into Kyle's room, and lay him down. Sheila waits as the men leave, then leaves and closes the door so Kyle can recover in peace. Beams of light enter through the window]
[Channel 9 News. The anchorman speaks.]
ANCHOR
For the first time in almost a year, the economy in South Park has taken a small, but noticeable upturn. [a shot of a bustling mall] Stores and shopping malls are open again as newly debt-free people feel safe... to make purchases. [The Marshes are shopping, and Randy notices something]
RANDY
Wow, the new Margaritaville! [holds it up] With salsa dispenser! "Just pour your favorite salsa in the top and it comes out the dispenser in the bottom." Oh, we need this! [Sharon buries her face in her left hand]
ANCHOR
Are we out of the woods yet? Only time will tell. But we must not forget the sacrifice one person made to restore our faith and make us believe in the economy once again. The person we must thank every day for his amazing sacrifice. [the person is shown] Barack Obama. [a shot of Obama addressing a cheering crowd]
KYLE
[on the sofa watching the TV] Aww, come on!
End of Margaritaville

synopsis:Someone plays an April Fool's joke on the boys and it doesn't go over well.

script:Eat, Pray, Queef

[South Park Elementary, day. The hallway is shown as the bell rings, and the students pour into the hallway from their classrooms. They're all chatting about something imminent.]
CARTMAN
Oh, man, I thought that day would never end.
WENDY
Hey, Stan, you wanna maybe study together after school?
STAN
What?! No way, Wendy, today's the day!
WENDY
What day?
BUTTERS
The day they're showin' Part 2 of last week's Terrance and Phillip show!
CLYDE
They're gonna finally reveal who Phillip farted on to get out of jail.
RED
Oh God, that show is so dumb.
CARTMAN
Dumb?! Phillip farted in somebody's face super hard! But you don't know who until this week's episode!
TWEEK
Eagh! This has been the longest week of my life!
BEBE
Why do boys think farts are so funny? They're juvenile and gross!
CARTMAN
No! No, nono, you're right, Bebe! Farts totally aren't funny. [walks from his locker to the middle of the hall, turns around, farts, and walks back to his locker. A little girl walks into the fart fumes and all the boys laugh]
LITTLE GIRL
Eww! [Butters points at her and laughs cruelly]
KYLE
Come on guys, we gotta go! [leads the boys down the hall]
JIMMY
We're finally gonna learn the shocking truth of who Phillip f-farted on.
CARTMAN
Let's get to my house!! [the boys run out of school chattering away while the girls remain in the hall annoyed]
JASON
I'm coming, I'm coming!
WENDY
God, they're so stupid.
[Cartman's house, a while later. The boys walk into the living room and arrange themselves before the TV.]
STAN
Oh boy!
BUTTERS
This is gonna be great!
CRAIG
I've been waiting for this all week.
BUTTERS
Oh boy!
JASON
Great!
CARTMAN
[walks in with some snacks for himself and spots Craig on the sofa] Ah ah ah, that's my seat, Craig.
CRAIG
Dude, I was here first.
CARTMAN
It's my Goddamned house, now get your bitch ass on the floor! [Craig moves to an empty spot on the floor as Cartman takes his place on the sofa]
BUTTERS
Well it's on, it's on, itsonitsonitson!
[Graphics for the Canada Channel pop up onscreen.]
ANNOUNCER
You are watching the Canada Channel, the only channel in Canada.
ANNOUNCER 2
Previously on Terrance & Phillip: Terrance farted on the American president, but Phillip took the heat. [A shot of Terrance farting on Barack Obama, who appears Canadian onscreen. The boys have a good laugh]
PHILLIP
[pleading his innocence as a prison guard shoves him into a cell] It wasn't me! [fart. The boys laugh again]
ANNOUNCER 2
And now, the thrilling conclusion of... Terrance & Phillip: Blood Rage ["Part 2" appears, followed by "Special Presentation"]
ANNOUNCER
...will not be seen tonight, so that we may bring you this Queef Sisters Special!
[APRIL FOOLS! A kazoo is heard.]
CARTMAN
What?
ANNOUNCER 3
The Canada Channel presents... The Queef Sisters. Katherine and Katie Queef. [a shot of them at the beach farting pink queefs] Two Toronto girls who love shooting air out their vaginas. [a shot of them queefing on a unicorn.] It's The Queef Sisters special on Channel Canada.
[A Canadian doctor's clinic. The sisters wait inside, their legs on stirrups. The doctor walks in.]
DOCTOR
Alright Queef Sisters, it's time for your yearly PAP smear and vag exam.
KATIE
Alright Doctor.
KATHERINE
I'm ready, Doctor.
DOCTOR
[walks over to Katherine] Now I'm just going to check for cysts. [lowers his face and moves in closer for a good look... QUEEF!] Awww! [backs up and hides his face. Katherine begins to laugh. Katie joins in]
CARTMAN
What the fuck is this?!
DOCTOR
Now listen heauh! If you queef in my face, then I refuse to be your gynecologist!
KATHERINE
I'm sorry, doctor. I had air trapped in my vagina.
KATIE
Huhuhuhu!
DOCTOR
Well just don't let it happen again! Now I'm going to check for cysts. [lowers his head, quickly glances at Katherine, then lowers his head again. QUEEF! The doctor recoils again] Arh! [Katherine laughs, then Katie joins in. The boys watch this special and aren't moved.] Now stop it! That isn't funny! Babies come from there! [goes back between Katherine's legs. QUEEF! The doctor hides his face again and the sisters laugh. The doctor is fed up and throws his notepad away] That's it! No PAP smear for you!
KATHERINE
But doctor, what if I have cancer?
DOCTOR
You should have thought of that before you queefed in my face three times! [A shot of the boys confused, with Cartman getting mad]
BUTTERS
They, uh they aren't gonna show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip show?
KATIE
Doctor, my sister is just being difficult. Maybe you can just examine my cervix instead.
DOCTOR
Well alright, let me check for cysts. [goes over to Katie and lowers his head. QUEEF! He backs out] Nooo! [the sisters laugh] That does it, Queef Sisters! I'm not your vaginal doctor anymore! [walks out the door]
KATHERINE
Oh Katie, I do believe we made the doctor angry.
KATIE
I guess so Katherine.
CARTMAN
Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
[The Canada Broadcasting Channel offices, day. Terrance & Phillip have just watched the same episode the boys did.]
PHILLIP
What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
TERRANCE
Queef Sisters?!
NETWORK PRESIDENT
That's right. It's a hot new Canadian show we're trying out.
TERRANCE
You replaced our show with this?! But they aren't funny! All they do is queef all the time!
PHILLIP
That's sick!
NETWORK PRESIDENT
You think farts are funny; why not queefs?
TERRANCE
Because babies come from there!
NETWORK PRESIDENT
Eh, look guys, women are starting to be the driving force behind the television audience! You know, women empowerment and the get-go. So we want to try to appeal to the female sensibility. Sorry guys, but if you ask me, your farts have gotten stale!
[South Park Elementary, day. Cartman is in the hall talking on his cell phone surrounded by other kids.]
CARTMAN
No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?!
WENDY
[walks up to Stan] What's going on?
STAN
We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV!
CARTMAN
You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that!
CLYDE
I threw up on my way home.
CARTMAN
Clyde threw up on his way home! What makes you think you can put that kind of filth on television?! [more girls begin to appear]
STAN
You tell 'em, Cartman!
RED
What happened?
BUTTERS
They didn't show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip! [crosses his arms] They replaced it with the Queef Sisters!
KYLE
It was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people!
BEBE
Oh what? So farts are hysterical but queefs are gross?
CARTMAN
You know that little kids could have been watching that?! What kind of network are you running there in Canada?! Don't call me buddy! I'm not your buddy! [the girls have heard enough and leave]
BEBE
I can't believe they're this upset.
RED
God, they're annoying!
ANNIE
I don't even know what a queef is.
WENDY
It's when a woman blows air out her vag, Annie.
ANNIE
Oh.
RED
You know that girl Samantha Dunskin, she can make herself queef whenever she wants.
BEBE
Really?
WENDY
Wait a minute. I've got an idea.
[Meanwhile, just behind them, Cartman has Butters write out a letter as he dictates and paces around the floor.]
CARTMAN
And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly...
KYLE
Robbed us of our innocence.
CARTMAN
Yes, that's good.
BUTTERS
[writing left-handed] Robbed us of our innocence... [the girls return]
WENDY
Hey, guys, we have a little surprise for you.
STAN
What? [a girl moves to the front of the group, and lets loose a queef into Butters' face. Butters is stunned and tries to get the queef off his face as if it were skunk musk]
BUTTERS
Oh God, oh my God no! [runs down the hall and out the front doors of the school, still screaming and trying to get the queef off, then runs all the way home. He runs in, leaving the front door open and his father puzzled. He runs upstairs and into his room, slamming the door shut.]
STEPHEN
Butters?
[The Marsh house, later. Randy is talking on the phone, as Sharon listens in, worried.]
RANDY
Oh my God, well how is he doing? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. Huh, okay, well, thank you for telling me, Mr. Stotch, I'll spread the word. Yoeah, you take care. Bye. [hangs up the cordless phone] We need to cancel our plans, Sharon. There's gonna be an emergency all-parent meeting at the school tonight. [starts to go upstairs]
SHARON
Why? What happened?
RANDY
[backs down a couple of steps] A girl at school, she... queefed on one of Stan's friends today. [goes on upstairs. She looks on for a few seconds]
SHARON
...So?
[Stan's room. Stan is sitting at the edge of his bed moping. Randy knocks on the door, then opens it to peek in. He then walks up to Stan and sits next to him on the bed.]
RANDY
Hey, pal. I heard about what happened at school today. You wanna talk about it?
STAN
Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming.
RANDY
I know, pal. Sometimes... bad things happen to good people. But you know Butters is still Butters, and he needs you guys right now more than anybody.
STAN
It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-?
RANDY
Hey, we're getting all the parents together and we're gonna take care of this, okay? Nothing like this will ever happen again.
[South Park Elementary Gymnasium, night. Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey wait for all the parents take their seats on the bleachers.]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, parents, some of you have already heard, but most of you have not, m'kay? We've had a terrible incident occur at the school. Apparently a young girl uh, went up to a young boy here at the school, m'kay, and queefed in his face. [immediately people begin whispering to each other]
GERALD
How did this happen?
STUART
Where were the teachers?!
MRS. TESTABURGER
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Are you saying we're all here just because a girl queefed on a boy?
MAN
Just?!
THOMAS
We're here to find out why!
RANDY
The question is how do we send a message to other girls in the school so this doesn't happen again! [more murmuring ensues]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Now hold on a minute, I think we're being a little drastic here. You know, I probably see a boy in my office once a week for farting on a girl. [the men look at each other]
RANDY
What does that have to do with anything? [the women begin to murmur in reaction to that question]
[Live with Regis and Kelly. The camera pulls back in the sign to reveal the studio audience.]
REGIS
Our next guests have really taken America by storm. Their new hit show is being tuned in by women all over the world. Please welcome the Queef Sisters! [Regis and Kelly stand up to greet the sisters as the sisters go onstage]
KATHERINE
Oh hello Regis.
KATIE
Hello Kelly. [QUEEF. The sisters laugh]
REGIS
So, uh, gals, ...you seem to really like queefing.
KATHERINE
Well Reeg, it's like this: we think that queefing is a perfectly normal female bodily function. Why not have fun with it? [rips out a new queef and laughs. The audience applauds and cheers]
REGIS
But I mean really, isn't queefing a bit juvenile?
KATIE
Men enjoy farts, so why shouldn't women enjoy their queefs?
KATHERINE
That's right. We've written all aboot it in our new feminist book, Eat, Pray, Queef.
KELLY
Well I think that what you gals are doing for the feminist movement is amazing. And that's why women all over America stand behind you. [lets loose a most robust queef]
REGIS
D'ohhh! [walks offstage covering his nose as the sisters laugh.]
[The Canada Broadcasting Channel offices, day. Terrance & Phillip are there once again.]
NETWORK PRESIDENT
Terrance and Phillip, you've put on a terrific show for many many years. You've made Canada Channel what it is today. You're fired.
TERRANCE & PHILLIP
Fired?!
NETWORK PRESIDENT
Sorry guys, but this queefing thing is really catching on. [grabs some gift-wrapped boxes from under his desk and carries them to Terrance & Phillip.] Queef Sisters' ratings are through the roof, and to pay them what they're asking we've gotta get rid of you. Goodbye. Here's some cookies. [hands them the boxes]
TERRANCE
Brian, don't do this!
PHILLIP
You can't let Canada Channel be soiled by that perverse garbage! You know it's sick!
BRIAN
[prepares himself a drink and walks by his window] Yes, I know it's sick. To be honest, I gag every time one of them lets out a queef. [turns around and glares at the duo] But it's money Goddammit and this channel needs it! I'm sorry, Terrance & Phillip, your show is done!
[The Martha Stewart show.]
MARTHA
I always love when Spring is on the way. Such a fun and inspiring time to decorate. Just like most women out there I've really gotten into queefing lately. [holds up some scissors and construction paper, and the camera pulls back to reveal her genitalia] It's a lot of fun and interesting ways we can decorate our queefs and just make them more dynamic for the holidays. What we're gonna do is just... cut out some paper... like... this... [snips away] and cut out little stars and little moon shapes, [puts those stars and moons into her vagina] and we're gonna just... jam those... up... and they have custom simple little sparkles from the hobby stores; they come in... little tube which make them very easy to just... [puts the sparkles into the vagina as well] shoot... right up the ol'... there we are. And of course you can feel free to add little flowers or maybe some festive Easter grass. But the point is that when we're done we can... let one rip. [she queefs and the stars, moons, and sparkles pop out in a fireworks display. She grins] See how pretty that was? It's a good thing.
[The segment ends. Next, the Marsh house, day. The Marshes are enjoying a meal. A small sound is heard and Sharon smiles. Stan and Randy freeze, then Randy looks at Sharon.]
RANDY
What was that?
SHARON
Oh, excuse me, I... [stifles a giggle] I, I had a little air trapped. [Shelly begins to giggle]
RANDY
Oh my God, did you just...? At the table?
SHARON
[chuckles] Pardon me. [Shelly giggles]
STAN
Mom, gross! [Sharon and Shelly giggle some more]
RANDY
Okay, that's enough, girls! Alright? I mean, how old are you, Sharon?
SHARON
[giggles and pats her face down with a napkin] Sorry, it's just ...it's kind of funny how much it bothers you.
RANDY
Oh yeah. Yeah, that's really funny!
STAN
Stop it, Mom!
RANDY
Yeah okay? Let's just try to have a nice dinner, okay?
SHARON
[giggling] Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [smiles. The family resumes eating quietly until another queef is heard. Sharon and Shelly crack up while Stan and Randy stare at them]
RANDY
Sharon! Marsh!
SHARON
Ex-cuse me.
SHELLY
Hey Mom, do you like Australia? 'Cause that was the Great Barrier Queef. [Sharon and Shelly giggle some more]
RANDY
That's it, I'm leaving! [leaves the table and heads for the front door]
STAN
I'm going too. [follows Randy]
SHARON
Oh! Oh please, Randy! How many times have you farted in bed and held my head under the covers?!
RANDY
That's completely different!
STAN
Yeah it's different, Mom!
SHARON
Alright, tell me exactly where the line is. Er, okay, how about this? I have a friend Abbie. She had a baby boy and it farted.
RANDY
[giggles a bit] Heh, yeah?
SHARON
But she was actually still pregnant with the baby boy and it farted inside her.
RANDY
[giggles with Stan] Yeah?
SHARON
And then the gas from the baby's fart traveled down and shot out her vagina, haHA. [Randy and Stan glare at her]
RANDY
Come on Stanley, let's go. [they turn and head out the front door]
SHARON
Oh! Oh, so when does that stop being funny?!
RANDY
It stopped being funny the second that air came out her vagina, Sharon! [exits the house and slams the door shut]
[The Queef Sisters' house, living room. Katie is on the sofa putting nail polish on the nails of her left foot.]
KATIE
Look Katherine, I made queef cookies!
KATHERINE
But those are just ginger snaps, Katie. [Katie queefs on the cookies and voila! The sisters laugh. The doorbell rings] Could you get that, Katie? [queefs on Katie as Katie walks by to get the front door. They giggle. Katherine opens the door and sees Terrance & Phillip staring at her angrily, with their arms crossed over their chests]
KATIE
Oh my God! Look, Katherine! It's Canadian television stars Terrance & Phillip!
KATHERINE
[jumps to her feet] Oh my God, they're famous! [walks up besides Katie] Well hello sirs! It is such an honor to meet you! Oh Katie, I'm getting all goosebumpy and queefy. [queefs twice. The sisters laugh]
KATIE
[queefs] Wooo.
PHILLIP
May we come in, please?
KATHERINE
Oh certainly, though I feel we look a mess. [Terrance & Phillip walk in and look around]
TERRANCE
Very nice place you have here. Network must be paying you well.
KATIE
Oho yes, the show is going aboat as well as it could. [queefs]
TERRANCE
All right, enough with the queefing! We didn't come for a social call!
PHILLIP
That's right! We've come to kill you! [Terrance pulls out a gun and aims it at them, and they gasp]
KATIE
Why kill us? We love you.
TERRANCE
Because you've reduced Canada Channel to smut and toilet humor!
KATHERINE
Oh. Well I suppose if we're going to die, we should die by the hands of our idols.
TERRANCE
Your idols?
KATHERINE
We grew up watching you. You meant the world to us. We used to fantasize about pleasing you in all different ways. Know that it is an honor to die by your hand. [the sisters shut their eyes and wait to be shot]
TERRANCE
[turns around] I don't think I can do it, Phillip. [Katie opens her eyes]
PHILLIP
Why not? [Katherine opens her eyes]
TERRANCE
Because I'm suddenly finding myself strangely attracted to Katherine.
PHILLIP
What?! That's crazy, Terrance! Katie is obviously the hot one. [they look over their shoulders at the sisters]
[Butters' bedroom, day. He's in bed with an ice pack tied down around his head.]
BUTTERS
Ohhhhh ohhhhh. [Cartman enters leading the other boys in class. He's carrying a box]
CARTMAN
Hey Butters. How you holding up, man?
BUTTERS
Oh. Hey fellas.
CARTMAN
We got you a present, Butters. I'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on.
BUTTERS
Aw thanks.
STAN
Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny.
BUTTERS
Ohhhhh ohhhhh!
KYLE
Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.
BUTTERS
My, my picture?
CARTMAN
You're going to be the face of queef abuse, Butters, so that we can make people open their eyes.
[License place BM 475. The camera pans up to reveal Terrance driving Phillip, Katherine and Katie down a country road. They pass a sign saying "Entering CANADIAN WINE COUNTRY. Over THREE WINERIES to explore." The four continue down the road until they reach Canadian White Wine Winery. They go in and sample the wine. Terrance finishes his glass and farts into it. The two men laugh. The foursome get back on the road. Sometime later, Katie queefs on Terrance.]
TERRANCE
AAH! [the sisters laugh. The foursome then stops at Canadian Red Wine Winery. Inside they sample more wine and a flatulent sound is heard]
PHILLIP
Dammit I'm trying to enjoy my wine, Katie!
TERRANCE
No, that was me, Phillip. I farted.
PHILLIP
Oh. [Both men laugh. The foursome leave and get back on the road. Terrance is still driving. They're all drinking straight from bottles]
KATHERINE
Oh, this is a dream come true. I've always wanted to meet you, Phillip. [Terrance brakes angrily]
TERRANCE
Phillip?! I'm Terrance!
KATIE
What? I thought you were Terrance.
PHILLIP
No, I'm Phillip!
KATHERINE
Oh dear. [they continue down the road, sipping from bottles. Phillip is now driving with Katherine up front while Terrance sits in back with Katie. Katie tosses her bottle back onto the road and starts making out with Terrance.]
[The House of Representatives. Some of the boys, their parents, and South Park Elementary staff are presenting their case.]
STEPHEN
A disgusting, violating trend is taking over our city, our state, our nation. Queefing has become an acceptable evil.
CARTMAN
Last week at our school, a girl queefed right into our friend's face. That is why we are here to tell you [points to the poster] it's not a joke.
STAN
On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.
RANDY
[walks into view with a mic] I would like to take this opportunity to explain why farts are funny and queefs are not. Men have always joked about farts and we in fact name our farts. We have The Squeaker [moves the mic to his ass and lets out a squeaking fart, then speaks into the mic again] And then there's The Foghorn [moves the mic to his ass and lets out two farts that sound like a foghorn, then speaks into the mic again] and the "Don't be scared" [moves the mic to his ass and lets out a series of farts that sort of sound like "Don't be scared", then speaks into the mic again] and of course there's the-
WOMAN
Excuse me. [another woman hands her a mic] Well if that really is your argument, it isn't a very sound one. Women name their queefs too.
OTHER WOMEN
That's right! We do.
WOMAN
For instance, we have the Sneezing Unicorn. [moves the mic to her vagina and makes it sneeze, then speaks into the mic again] and The Resuscitator [moves the mic to her vagina and makes a sound like an air pump]
CARTMAN
Sick! Stop it, lady!
RANDY
Th-that's not the same! We've got the Chinese Firecracker! [moves the mic to his ass and lets out a sputtering fart that sounds like a Chinese firecracker]
WOMAN 2
That's all well and good, but we can do the Road Warrior. [moves the mic to her vagina and...]
ROAD WARRIOR QUEEF
Nooo! We go iiin! We kiiill! No more talk! We kiiill! Soon, my dog of war, but we have to do it my way. [switches to another voice] Losers! Losers wait!
MALES
[covering their noses] AWWW!
RANDY
Jesus Christ!
[The Queef Sisters' house, night. In the dark, Phillip is naked and running away from something. A vase flies at him and shatters against a wall.]
PHILLIP
You stupid bitch, what the fuck is wrong with you?! [evades another vase, which shatters against another wall]
KATHERINE
I'm not your sex toy, you fucking pig! [flings a third vase at him]
PHILLIP
Ugh! You don't queef in bed while we're having sex!
KATHERINE
Fuck you, you don't fucking slap me! [a light turns on. Terrance and Katie are in a bed next to them]
TERRANCE
Could you please keep it down? We're trying to have sex over here.
PHILLIP
She queefed while we were having sex, Terrance!
TERRANCE
SICK!
KATIE
Well what's the big deal? I've been queefing in this bed the entire time.
TERRANCE
What?! Gross! [punches her on the face with his left fist]
KATIE
How dare you?! [punches him back]
KATHERINE
Get out! Get out both of you! [begins pushing Phillip towards the door] We never want to see you again! [kicks his butt. Soon, both men are out of the bedroom]
TERRANCE
After everything we've been through? [Katie gives them the last push, shuts the door, and sobs. Katherine joins her, they hug each other, and they queef separately]
[The terrace at the Queef Sisters home. Terrance & Phillip stand at the banister, still naked and smoking cigarettes.]
TERRANCE
[sighs] What the hell am I going to do, Phillip? She makes me so mad sometimes.
PHILLIP
Katherine just won't stop queefing, but I don't know if I can live without her.
[Terrence and Phillip enter the house.]
TERRANCE
Katie, I'm sorry. I was wrong.
PHILLIP
Me too, Katherine. I don't love your queefs, but dammit, I love you.
KATIE
Oh Terrance. [they hug]
KATHERINE
Phillip! [they hug and move towards Katherine's bed. Each couple starts having sex immediately, with the men on top. The men farts in the process]
[Stan's house, morning. A rooster crows somewhere. Randy steps out to pick up the newspaper. He yawns and reaches down...]
RANDY
[gasps] Oh my God! [the headline reads "QUEEFING BANNED! ROAD WARRIOR QUEEF SEALS IT!"] Oh my god! Stan! [turns around and closes the door, then runs to the foot of the stairs] Stan, we did it! Colorado Senate moves to ban queefing!
STAN
[coming down the stairs] No way! We did it?! [twirls around] Yeah!!
RANDY
Alright son! Yeah!!
SHARON
[coming in from the kitchen with Shelly] What's going on?
RANDY
[thrusts the paper in Sharon's face] HA! Read it and weep, Sharon! No more queefing!
SHARON
[resigned] Well, ...congratulations, guys. Looks like you got us. Good job.
RANDY
Aw come on. [tries to lighten the mood] Just because you can't queef anymore...
SHARON
You really think women cared that much about queefing? Is that really what you think this has all been about? This has been about women having a little bit of fun for once at your expense. For just this one time we could be the immature ones to make you feel uncomfortable. But no, you just couldn't let us have that one little thing, could you? Because even though things are getting better for women, you still think of us as lesser people sometimes, and we always have to prove ourselves twice as hard. Congratulations, guys. [begins to sob] For getting your way... again. [she and Shelly turn around and head back to the kitchen]
STAN
Mom, we didn't mean... [he and Randy are stunned. Randy walks to the sofa and sits down.]
RANDY
[exhales] Boy oh boy. I think we might have screwed up royal, Stan. [Stan follows him to the sofa and sits next to him]
STAN
Yeah. We all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize... women actually cared about something a lot deeper.
RANDY
Stan, let's call the guys together. Maybe we can make this right.
[A recording booth, later. Randy appears alone and starts to sing.]
RANDY
There's a time in our lives when we must listen to the oppressed.
RANDY, STAN
And realize we've been keeping women down.
MR. MACKEY
They have power and they have courage.
STEPHEN, BUTTERS
And we must all stand by the belief.
GERALD, KYLE
That a woman is strong, and she has the right to queef.
THE MALES
Fly free. Free to queef aloud; fly free. Let every queef show that you’re proud.
RANDY
You face so many challenges to put an end to your grief.
THE MALES
You are woman now, and you are free to queef.
CARTMAN
It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.
MR. GARRISON
They're just the same as you and me. Their rights must be preserrrr-r-r-rrrved.
THE MALES (RANDY)
Queef free (Queef free). Every woman has the right; queef free (Queef free). Let your queefing stars shine bright.
You are woman, hear you roar (queef free), queefing too loud to ignore. Queef a little each day and let your soul take flight!
Ah-aaaaaaah-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, queef free.
[Scenes shown during the song: A fire department captain, a car mechanic, a firefighter, a lab technician, a baker, a flight attendant, a doctor, a paramedic, Hillary Clinton, with a queef coming out of her, a dog with five or six puppies at her teats, a pharmacist, a hotel worker, a mother, and an athlete.]
[A Canadian cathedral, day. Inside this magnificent church are Terrance & Phillip and their brides.]
BISHOP
For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. [Katherine jumps up and queefs on him] Nooo! [the sisters laugh]
PHILLIP
Stop it, Katherine! This is a serious moment!
BISHOP
Therefore what God has joined together let no man- [Terrance jumps up and farts on him. Phillip laughs. Katie jumps up and queefs on Terrance]
PHILLIP
Aww. sick! [Terrance jumps up and farts on Katie. Phillip laughs. Katherine comes up and queefs on him. He farts on the bishop]
BISHOP
That's it! I now pronounce you farts and queefs! [the couples laugh as the bishop quickly leaves, Canadians laugh]
End of Eat, Pray, Queef

synopsis:Cartman and Jimmy come up with the funniest joke of all time.

script:Fishsticks

[South Park, day. Cartman is walking over to Jimmy's house. He enters the house eating chips. Jimmy is working on new jokes.]
CARTMAN
Hey Jimmy, what are you up to? [closes the door and walks up to Jimmy]
JIMMY
Oh, hey Eric. I was just trying to write some new jokes for my comedy [chokes up] ...rou-routine.
CARTMAN
Yeah well, ya wanna do somethin'? I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle, but they're all pissed off at me for somethin' so I have to hang out with you.
JIMMY
Sorry Eric, but I really need to work, very much. I haven't written a good joke in over a week.
CARTMAN
[heads to the sofa and lays down on his back] Alright, well maybe I can help you, you know, we can totally write some stuff together.
JIMMY
Oh, well, sure. I've never really tried working with a partner, but let's give it a sho- a sh- a-sh, a-sh, shotaroosky. Let's see... I was workin' on this: Why does a squirrel swim on its back? To keep his -nuts dry.
CARTMAN
[while munching] No, that's not that funny. Let's try something else.
JIMMY
Ahb. A fireman and a p-p-Polack are eating marshmallows when-
CARTMAN
No, no. Polacks aren't that funny dude. Try somethin' else. [Jimmy sighs and throws away a sheet of jokes. Hours later there are many more sheets on the floor]
JIMMY
...So the Pope says, "What are you, a stinking e-evolutionist?"
CARTMAN
Meh. [Jimmy tosses away another crumpled sheet]
SARAH
Here's some fruit, boys. [sets the plate down by Jimmy] Better for you than potato chips. Oh Jimmy, look out, there's a black widow! [pulls out a newspaper from under Jimmy's desk and smashes the spider with it]
JIMMY
Wow, thanks Mom. [she turns and walks away] You might have saved my life.
CARTMAN
Dude, if I'm trying to be creative, I can't eat fruit. Doesn't your mom have something more substantial to eat?
JIMMY
You can check the freezer. There might be some frozen fishsticks or somethin', if you like fishsticks. [gets an idea, indicated by a small bell]
CARTMAN
Yeah, I like fishsticks.
JIMMY
Wait a minute. Fishsticks... Fish. Dicks. [now he writes the joke excitedly] Ohmigod! It's so obvious. How did I never think of it before? [Cartman looks at him, then sits up]
CARTMAN
What, dude, you got something?
JIMMY
Alright, just run with me on this, Eric. Say Eric, do you like fishsticks?
CARTMAN
Yeah.
JIMMY
You like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
CARTMAN
Yeah.
JIMMY
Well what are you, Eric? A gay fish?
CARTMAN
[thinks through the joke] Fish dicks! Aw dude, that's funny as shit! I think we're really onto something here. Let's try it out on the guys.
[South Park Elementary, day. The bell rings and the boys are in the hall. Clyde is putting some books away in his locker when Cartman rounds the corner with three other guys: Jimmy, Kenny and Butters.]
BUTTERS
Ohoho, there's Clyde. Do it to Clyde.
JIMMY
Yeah yeah, let's do it to Clyde.
CARTMAN
Okay okay, shushushuh, okay, shush, check it out. Uh hey there Clyde.
CLYDE
Hey.
STAN
[walks up to the other guys] What's going on?
BUTTERS
Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.
CARTMAN
Say Clyde, do you like fishsticks?
CLYDE
Yes. [Butters covers his mouth to stifle a laugh]
CARTMAN
Do you like to put fishsticks in your mouth?
CLYDE
Yes. [Butters covers his mouth to stifle a laugh]
CARTMAN
[points to Clyde with both index fingers] What are you, Clyde? A gay fish?
BUTTERS
[runs up to Cartman and Clyde] HA you said you like fishsticks in your mouth; that makes you a gay fish! [Cartman laughs. Butters soon joins him. Clyde just smiles sheepishly, knowing that's a good joke. Tolkien walks into view and Cartman runs to him. Clyde grins]
CARTMAN
Tolkien, Tolkien, got a question for you: [clears his throat] Tolkien, do you like fishsticks?
TOLKIEN
Fishsticks? Yeah, I guess so. [Butters begins to giggle]
CARTMAN
[motions to Butters to keep quiet for now] Shh shh shh shh Butters Butters. [back to Tolkien] You you like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
TOLKIEN
Yes.
CARTMAN
What are you?
BUTTERS, CARTMAN
A gay fish? [Cartman laughs first, then Butters]
BUTTERS
Hey look, there's Kevin Stoley! [runs towards the unseen voice] Hey Kevin, do you like fishsticks? [A hot new joke is born.]
[Mr. Mackey's office. Garrison peeks in...]
MR. GARRISON
Hey, hey Mackey? Do you like fishsticks?
MR. MACKEY
Fishsticks? Yeah, I l- I like fishsticks, m'kay?
[At South Park Market.]
STEPHEN
Oh hey Peterson, buying fishsticks, I see.
PETERSON
Yeah, I like fishsticks.
STEPHEN
What are you, Peterson? A gay fish? [everyone laughs]
[The Jimmy Kimmel Show.]
ANNOUNCER
And now, here he is! Jimmy Kimmel! [the studio audience cheers as he goes onstage]
JIMMY KIMMEL
Alright, hey, how are we all feelin' tonight? [the audience quiets down] So uhhh, let me ask the guys in the audience a question. Do you like fishsticks?
THE GUYS
Yes.
JIMMY KIMMEL
Huh. What are you, a gay fish? [everyone laughs]
[The Late Show with David Letterman.]
DAVID LETTERMAN
And so uhhh, hey Paul, do you like fishsticks, Paul?
PAUL SHAFFER
Uhhh, sure?
DAVID LETTERMAN
What are you, Paul, a gay fish? [everyone cracks up over it. Someone in the audience keels over the balcony. Letterman tosses away his notes]
[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.]
JAY LENO
So apparently more and more Americans are eating fishsticks. Have you seen this? Have you read about this? Loving fishsticks, kinda makes me wonder, you know? What is everybody, a gay fish? [the studio audience roars with laughter and two men in the front row fall off their chairs and throw up.]
[Another talk show, but without a studio audience.]
ANCHOR
It is quite possibly the funniest joke over conceived, and its origin is unknown. The fishsticks joke crosses all border, all races, all ages and ethnic groups and is slowly uniting our country. In fact, the only person who appears to not get the joke is rapper Kanye West, who becomes furious when people use the joke on him.
KANYE
Yo, that is messed up, yo! I am not gay, and I sure as hell ain't no fish! Alright?!
TOM SNYDER
You. Really. Don't. Get it.
KANYE
Hey man, I'm a genius, alright?! I'm the most talented musician in the world! If I was a homosexual, or a fish, I would know!
TOM SNYDER
You're a rapper.
KANYE
Yes.
TOM SNYDER
An entrepreneur.
KANYE
Yes.
TOM SNYDER
And you like fish dicks.
KANYE
Yes.
TOM SNYDER
You're a gay fish.
KANYE
No! I am not no gay fish!
TOM SNYDER
Just gay?
KANYE
I'm not gay and I'm not a fish! Man!
TOM SNYDER
[this time goes through joke one step at a time] You are male?
KANYE
Damn right I'm male.
TOM SNYDER
A male that likes fish dicks.
KANYE
Yeah, I like fishsticks.
TOM SNYDER
You like to put fish dicks in your mouth.
KANYE
Yeah.
TOM SNYDER
You're a gay fish.
KANYE
Alright, that does it! I'm gonna kick your motherfuckin' ass! [stands up pushes him off his chair]
[South Park Elementary, day. The kids are having lunch in the school cafeteria. Stan and Kyle sit opposite each other this time.]
CARTMAN
And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television.
KYLE
We know, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke.
JIMMY
P-patent?
CARTMAN
Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated.
JIMMY
Well, Eric, th-that's really not how jokes work. I mean, you know, we should just be... happy that the joke is so popular and made a lot of people laugh.
CARTMAN
Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement, but I don't work for free. I'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us! [smiles, takes his tray and walks away]
KYLE
Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?
JIMMY
Well, he didn't actually... write any of it. He just uh...
KYLE
Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers.
JIMMY
Actually it was potato chips.
KYLE
I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!
JIMMY
W-well, I-I mean he, he was in the room.
CRAIG
Then just give him half.
KYLE
What?
CRAIG
I like you Jimmy, but you're not gonna win this. Consider yourself lucky he's only asking for half.
KYLE
Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit!
CRAIG
Yep. And if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon.
KYLE
No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say "Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!"
CRAIG
Just give him half.
[Kanye speaks to a group of reporters at a conference somewhere.]
KANYE
There are a lot of people out there making up rumors about me that are malicious and untrue. But I'm going to prove once and for all: I'm not a fish. Because I am a genius, I've ascertained that fish have gills. [a doctor steps up next to him] Doctor, do I have gills?
DOCTOR
He does not have gills.
KANYE
You hear that? No gills! So I can't be a fish. And I'm a genius voice of a generation so I'm not gay! So that is that! Alright?! It's over! Now are there any questions?
REPORTER 1
Do you like fishsticks?
KANYE
Love 'em!
REPORTER 2
You're a gay fish. [a third reporter laughs and soon the rest of the room is laughing]
KANYE
No I'm not- AAAARGH! [grabs the sides of the podium and shakes with anger]
[Late Night with Conan O'Brien.]
CONAN O'BRIEN
Alright, recently... Recently we've all come to know the fishsticks joke as probably the funniest, most awesome joke ever, but who originally came up with it? Well here's your answer. Joining us tonight, the brains behind the incredible fishsticks joke, the one and only Carlos Mencia.
CARLOS MENCIA
[dancing in his seat] Yeheah, Vive la Mexico!
CONAN O'BRIEN
So Carlos, you've got a show on Comedy Central, a stand-up tour, where did you have time to come up with this classic joke?
MENCIA
Well you know I just kicking it with my homies and my brain, you know, my brain is always so full of ideas 'cause I'm so fonny and stuff, so I was just all like, ""Hey, Papito, you like fishsticks?" And my homeboy says "Yeah Carlos" you know, "you're so funny!" And then it just occurred to me. I said, "Oh man, you must be a gay fish, homes!" [the studio audience roars with laughter, and he begins to dance in his seat again] And this is how I came up with it, mi amigos! [Conan claps. Cartman, looking at the show on TV, is pissed off]
CARTMAN
[shakes with rage, then turns left and walks away] Motherfucker!
[South Park Elementary, day. Cartman runs up to Jimmy in the hallway.]
CARTMAN
Jimmy, dude, did you see?! Carlos Mencia is taking credit for our joke!
JIMMY
Really?
CARTMAN
Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!
JIMMY
Aahhm, I don't know, Eric. I really don't think I want to sign that very much.
CARTMAN
But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do!
JIMMY
Well, to be perfectly f-f-f-frank, Eric, I think I came up with a little bit more of the joke than you did.
CARTMAN
What?!
JIMMY
Well, you know, I mean, I basically wrote the thing, and you just kind of ate chips.
CARTMAN
Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember?
[Cartman remembers entering Jimmy's house.]
CARTMAN
Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out?
JIMMY
Sorry Eric, but I've gotta write some jokes. Unless you wanna team up or somethin'.
CARTMAN
Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together.
SARAH
Here's some fishsticks guys. I hope you like fishsticks.
CARTMAN
Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish? [Jimmy and Cartman laugh, but Cartman notices something on Jimmy's desk.] Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it's a black widow! [gets off the couch, gets a newspaper, walks over to the desk, and smashes the spider dead.]
JIMMY
Wow, thanks Eric.
[Back to the present. Jimmy looks helpless.]
JIMMY
Is that... Is that how it happened?
CARTMAN
Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew.
JIMMY
I'm... I'm sorry?
CARTMAN
It's cool man, it's cool. [turns around and walks away]
[Kanye West in Concert, night. at an indoor arena looking similar to Madison Square Garden]
ANNOUNCER
Here he is, y'all! Give it up for Kanye West!
KANYE
[gets onstage] Yo. Ungh. Yo. [turns to look at the audience] Yo, whoa! Whoa, what the hell?! [a lot of audience members carry signs saying that Kanye is a gay fish and that he likes fishsticks]
AUDIENCE
Gay fish! Gay fish! Gay fish!
KANYE
Yo, fuck this noise, yo! [throws down his mic and storms offstage]
[Kanye's mansion, living room. He looks at a board while his entourage stands at the other end of the room looking at him.]
KANYE
Just doesn't make any sense, yo. Why is everyone calling me a gay fish?
HOUSE
Kanye, look, we all think it would be better if you would just drop it. Ya-you know, I mean, ih-if you don't get it, you don't get it.
KANYE
What do you mean, I don't get it, House?! I'm a genius. I'll understand it, I just need to break it down is all. Now let's see... [he's writing on a whiteboard. So far he has "Fishsticks plus Me equals Gayfish"] Somethin' about fishsticks... interacting with me... makes me gay fish.
AIDE 1
Kanye, really...
KANYE
Shut up! [looks at the whiteboard again.] Alright, now what do we know about fishsticks? [adds more words to the board] They're breaded, they're fried, they're frozen. Then under me we have rapper, genius. And gay fish are homosexual. They swim. [begins connecting words] Is it because breaded has something to do with genius? Which swims?
HOUSE
No, because you said you like fish dicks, Kanye! Don't, don't you get it? You see, fish dicks is a is a play on words.
KANYE
I don't need anyone tellin' me "play on words"! I'm a motherfuckin' lyrical wordsmith motherfuckin' genius!
[The boys' restroom at South Park Elementary, day. Kyle is at the urinal when Cartman walks in a few seconds later.]
CARTMAN
Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?
KYLE
Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing.
CARTMAN
[walks off a bit] It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke. [Kyle zips up and goes to the sink to wash his hands] I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it. [Kyle finishes up, grabs a paper towel, wipes his hands dry, and turns to Cartman]
KYLE
You know what, Cartman? I believe you.
CARTMAN
You do?
KYLE
Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! [turns and leaves the bathroom]
CARTMAN
[after some thought] But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I?
[Cartman remembers entering Jimmy's house. This time things go by quickly.]
CARTMAN
Hey Jimmy, what's up dawg?
JIMMY
Oh hey Eric. Just workin' on some jokes.
CARTMAN
That's cool. You wanna write some together? [walks out of view]
JIMMY
Hey, that'd be great! I've always wanted to work with you. You're really funny and you're totally not fat.
CARTMAN
[pulls up a chair] Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks.
JIMMY
Hey, you're really onto something there.
SARAH
Hello Eric. Have some chips, because you're totally not fat at all.
CARTMAN
Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer. [she walks off] Now let's see... The setup could be... "Do you like fishsticks?"
JIMMY
Right. And then I say, "Yeah."
CARTMAN
So then I can say, "What are you, a gay fish?"
JIMMY
Oh wow, this is incredible! [something crashes into the house, making it shake violently. Jimmy and Cartman look at the source of the crash. A dragon wanders in]
SARAH
What is that?
CARTMAN
It's a dragon of some kind! Don't worry, I can save you all! [leaps out of his seat with a sword out of nowhere and slashes the dragon across the chest, making it bleed. It falls on its back all of a sudden. Eric leaps onto its body and stabs the sword into its chest. It dies.]
BUTTERS
[looks through the window] Hey look, Eric killed a dragon.
CLYDE
[opens the front door] He's the most awesome kid in school!
WENDY
And he's not fat at all.
CARTMAN
Thanks you guys!
[Back to the present.]
CARTMAN
Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over.
[Kanye's mansion, living room. He's written down some more stuff and made more connections on the whiteboard.]
KANYE
Is it perhaps that I'm fashionable, and fishsticks are crunchy?
AIDE 2
Yo Kanye, KANYE! We found him money.
KANYE
Found who?
AIDE 2
You told us to track down whoever started the whole fishstick thang. We found out who, dawg.
MENCIA
[tied down to a chair in Kanye's study, his voice shaking] Come on, maaaan. What is this, maaaan? What the fuck is goin' on maaaan? [Kanye enters the room. His entourage makes way] Oh fuck maaaan, Kanye Wehhst? Noo shiiit maaan, okay look it wasn't me. I didn't really start the fishstick thing, alriight?
KANYE
You're just sayin' that now 'cause you're scared.
MENCIA
No man it's truuue. I stole it maaan. I took credit for it 'cause I'm not actually funneee. Come on, maaan, do you know what it's like? Being a comedian but not being funneee? Come on, Kanye, I just take jokes and repackage them with a Mexican accent, maaan.
KANYE
Think you can make fun of me? I'm a genius! I'm the voice of a generation! What are you?!
MENCIA
Nothing! Look at me maaan. I'm not funny, I steal jokes, my dick don't work maaan. I got to piss in a plastic bag, man, I got no dick.
KANYE
I ain't gonna hurt you. I pay people to do that for me.
MENCIA
Awww shih oh no man, come on, I got no dick, man! [Kanye's men whip out their own back and start whacking Mencia all over. His right hand gets broken, his left shin bleeds. The men stop as Kanye approaches him]
KANYE
[in Mencia's face] Now, explain it to me. Why do people think I'm a gay fish?
MENCIA
'Cause... 'cause you like fish dicks, man. Come on, maaan. Don't you get it? Please, just get it, maaan.
KANYE
Why- Look at me, look at me! [Mencia manages to look at him] I love fishsticks. I love putting fishsticks in my mouth. [waits a while for an answer]
MENCIA
You're a- ...you're a gay fish, maaan. [Kanye backs up, swings at Mencia and decapitates him, leaving his head hanging from his body by some skin]
[Ellen.]
ELLEN DEGENERES
Thank you, thank you very much. Well, about a week ago our country was blessed with the fishsticks joke. And ever since then us comedians have been kicking ourselves for not thinking of it. [the audience laughs] But today we have with us the true creators of the fishsticks joke. Please welcome the comedy team of Cartman and Valmer. [Cartman and Jimmy go onstage and sit on the couch facing Ellen] Hey guys!
CARTMAN
Hi Ellen. [to the audience] Do you guys like fishsticks? [the audience laughs] Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you.
ELLEN
So guys, I gotta ask: how did you come up with this incredible joke?
JIMMY
It was just a-
CARTMAN
Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you.
ELLEN
But guys, this joke is so... perfect. Can you explain how nobody thought of it before?
JIMMY
Well Ellen, the tr- tr- tr-
CARTMAN
Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important. [the audience applauds and cheers]
ELLEN
That's so great. And, and are you crying, Jimmy?
JIMMY
Yes Ma'am. [the best and worst of times for him]
CARTMAN
Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia.
ELLEN
I see. And did you know that Carlos Mencia was found dead in his house this morning with fishsticks stuffed down his open neck hole? [Jimmy and Cartman are alarmed]
CARTMAN
Uhhh excuse me? [the crowd gets rowdy.]
[Kanye's mansion. He was looking at the show with bat in hand...]
KANYE
Get my jet ready. Looks like we got another inning to play. [walks up to the wall-mounted TV and smashes it with the bat.]
[Jimmy's house, day, Jimmy's room. Cartman and Jimmy enter, with Jimmy still distraught.]
CARTMAN
Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials.
JIMMY
It's always been my dream to go on a national TV show and talk about the c-c-craft of comedy.
CARTMAN
Yeah, that was kewl huh?
JIMMY
Eric, there's something I really need to know.
CARTMAN
Whassat?
JIMMY
How do you live with yourself? You know you had nothing to do with the fishsticks joke. [Cartman gets worried] But you just keep pretending. How do you look at yourself in the f-f-fucking mirror?! That's what I want to know!
CARTMAN
So... here it is.
JIMMY
How do you take credit for something you didn't do?!
CARTMAN
That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did! [Kanye kicks the bedroom door open and enters the room. His men pour in and start smashing the furniture apart] Dude, it's Puff Daddy!
KANYE
Tie up these motherfuckers! [cut to the next scene, in which Kanye swings at a lamp and shatters it, then looks at his hostages] Now I'm gonna ask you motherfuckers one more time: why did you start these rumors about me?!
JIMMY
Please, I wasn't starting rumors about you. I don't even know who you are.
KANYE
Aw right. Everyone knows who I am! I wanna know how this got started!
JIMMY
Well, we, we were just talking about ideas for jokes and then-
CARTMAN
Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself!
JIMMY
Well I just but I buh I was, gonna ebeh-
CARTMAN
Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?!
[The fourth recollection. Cartman enters Jimmy's house in a rather nice outfit and sunglasses.]
CARTMAN
Hello Jim.
JIMMY
Oh boy! It's my best pal, Eric!
CARTMAN
[moves the glasses back over his cap] What are you up to?
JIMMY
I'm trying to write jokes. But I'm not as funny as you, so it's tough.
CARTMAN
Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up. [goes for a chair]
JIMMY
Ruh really? Wow, you would help me even though I'm crippled. You are caring and not fat. [hands his joke sheet to Cartman as Cartman brings the chair over and sits next to him]
CARTMAN
Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy.
SARAH
[brings in a plate of potato chips] Eric Cartman, you are handsome and not even remotely fat.
CARTMAN
Thanks. [Sarah walks away] So, what I'm thinking is, "Do you like fishsticks in your mouth?" [something crashes into the house, making it shake violently. Jimmy and Cartman look around.]
JIMMY
What was that? [Butters opens the door and steps in]
BUTTERS
Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! [outside, everyone scatters as robots march down the street firing off semiautomatic weapons. Cartman runs out to see what's happening. Butters and Jimmy follow right behind. Officer Barbrady and Mayor McDaniels look on helplessly]
CARTMAN
Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here? [takes off his glasses] Flame on! [becomes engulfed in flames and flies into the air. He then sends streams of flames at the robots, destroying them instantly. He flies back down to his starting point] Flame off! [the flames disappear. Other fourth graders appear: Annie, Millie, Red, Clyde, Tolkien and Wendy]
WENDY
You saved everyone from the Jewbots, Cartman.
CARTMAN
Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke! [runs in and finishes the joke in a flourish. Jimmy walks in] "Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish?" There! [other kids look in]
JIMMY
Wow Eric, in-credible! Too bad I'm a dick and I'm gonna take all the credit. Su-su-suck it, bitch!
[Back to the present.]
CARTMAN
Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.
JIMMY
What?!
CARTMAN
You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault.
JIMMY
Jesus Eric, he's gonna kill you! You won't even admit it was just me, knowing you're gonna die?
CARTMAN
Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now.
KANYE
What? I, I still don't get anything.
CARTMAN
All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.
JIMMY
Rih, r-r-really?
CARTMAN
I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can't accept the truth of who they are. [Kanye looks as if Cartman is talking about him] Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can't help believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won't let you think otherwise. I just have to accept that.
JIMMY
Thanks, Eric, for being so understanding.
KANYE
He's right. For so long I've considered myself God's gift to the world that I couldn't take it when people made fun of me. But they weren't makin' fun of me. They were tryin' to help me. [walks up to the boys and genuflects before them] Boys I understand what you did now. [to his men] Untie them guys. I know what I have to do.
[The Santa Monica Pier, furthest point from land. Kanye stands at the edge of the pier ready to jump in.]
AIDE 2
Yo Kanye! You sure about this?
KANYE
It's time for me to stop runnin'. I need to believe what people tell me. [turns and faces his entourage.] Let all my fans know I love 'em, but a gay fish just can't live in the outside world forever. Don't be sad for me guys! [turns around, runs, and dives into the ocean below] I'm goin' home! [his crew looks down into the water as Kanye begins swimming in his new environment]
[The waters off Santa Monica Beach. Kanye is swimming among the fish as a song begins...]
KANYE
(Uh. Come on.)
I've been so lonely, girl, I've been so sad and down.
Couldn't understand why haters joked around
I wanted to be free with other creatures like me
And now I got my wish...
'Cuz I know that I'm a gay fish gay fish (Gay fish, yo)
Motherfuckin' gay fish gay fish (I'm a fish, yo)
Going on a gay fish gay fish (it's alright, girl)
Makin' love to other gay fish gay fish (Unh)
All those lonely nights at the grocery store
In the frozen fish aisle feeling like a whore
 'Cuz I wasn't being true even though everyone said
That I had to make a switch (gay fish)...
Now I know that I'm a gay fish gay fish (Gay fish, yo)
Motherfuckin' gay fish gay fish (I'm a, I'm a fish, yo)
Going on a gay fish gay fish (Yes, now where I belong, girl)
Making love to other gay fish.
[During the song, the following happens: Kanye begins to swim like a fish. He spots a yellow fish and lets it circle him a few times. He then hugs it and takes it to the surface. He then gives it a French kiss, then flips backwards into the water with it. He swims again, alone, when a large fish begins to follow him. He notices, swims to it, and begins to rub against it. Then he just swims with it, hugging its belly.]

synopsis:Randy has a plan that will assure Stan a first place trophy in this year's Pinewood Derby.

script:Pinewood Derby

[A close-up of Stan and Randy working on a tiny car. Randy is doing pretty much all the work. They are in the basement.]
RANDY
Alright, [measures the length of the car's body] that's 2.8 centimeters... should give us a drag of only.. 26 milliseconds. Hold the front here, Stan. [Stan holds on to the car's front end as Randy whips out a cordless drill. Randy bores into the rear end of the car as Sharon comes down the stairs.]
SHARON
Hey guys, it's almost 2 a.m.
RANDY
[looks over his shoulder] We know!
SHARON
Well it's way past time for bed.
RANDY
Sharon, Stan's Pinewood Derby race is tomorrow! Do you have any idea how important this is to him? Stan is not gonna lose to the goddamn Hollises again!
SHARON
Well it's just a block of wood and some wheels; I don't think there's that much more you can do with it.
RANDY
That's 'cause you're a chick! Now just leave us alone! [turns his attention to the car again. Sharon goes upstairs] Don't worry, son, the Hollises are not beating us this year! I went and got something to put inside our car and make it go extra-fast. [pulls out a small box]
STAN
Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember?
RANDY
Stan, how do you think the Hollises beat us every year? [opens the box to reveal a small glowing metallic ball, picks it up with some tongs] I'm sure they put lead in the wood or something; we're just leveling the playing field. [puts the small ball in the hole he just drilled out, then plugs the hole up with a stopper that lines up flush with the car body] There.
STAN
What is that?
RANDY
It's, uh it's nothing, really.
[Channel 9 News.]
REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing outside the Hadron particle super-collider in Switzerland, where authorities are shocked and baffled over the theft of a superconducting bending magnet created for use in tests with particle acceleration.
STAN
[watching TV] Oh no, he didn't.
REPORTER
The superconducting magnet was stolen sometime last week. Surveillance cameras were able to record the theft on tape and police are now looking for [a picture of Randy dressed as Princess Leia] Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan. Caught here in these photos, the troubled rebel princess is seen taking the superconducting magnet and then appearing disoriented as she tries to find her way out. [Stan buries his head into his right palm in shame] If you have any information of Princess Leia's whereabouts, please call your local police department.
[Pinewood Derby Colorado State Championship, track area.]
JUDGE
Alright Scouts and Dads, the racing continues. And it looks like our next heat is ready to go, in 3, 2, 1, race! [four boys release their cars. Tolkien and Butters are two of the boys. The cars slide down a ramp and onto the straightaway, and hit a barrier at the other end of the track. Neither Tolkien nor Butters wins] Two point one seconds for Tommy Bretts. Looks like we have a new leader, folks.
TOMMY AND HIS DAD
[hi-five each other] All right!
[Pinewood Derby Colorado State Championship, Registration area. Stan and Randy enter the building.]
RANDY
Alright Stan, we're gonna need to check in and have our car inspected to qualify. [kneels down next to Stan] Now, son, Daddy needs to teach you something very important about "tells."
STAN
Tells?
RANDY
When you tell them you only used the approved kit, don't look up and away, don't rub your neck, and don't touch your ear. Otherwise they'll know you're lying to them. Alright? Whenever you need to lie, just don't look up and away, rub your neck, or touch your ear.
STAN
Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an-
RANDY
Son. ...You have to learn how to lie correctly someday, might as well be today, alright? I love you, son. [rubs his neck and looks up and away. Stan notices and is shocked.]
OFFICIAL
Looks good. Thank you and good luck today. [the boy and his father leave, Stan and his father step up] Alright, next please. [Stan hands him his car. Randy rubs his neck again, then grins nervously] Name?
STAN
It's uh, Marsh. [the official puts the car on a small stand, then measures and weighs it]
OFFICIAL
Alright, car weighs in at 15 ounces. Do you hereby swear that you used parts in the official Pinewood Derby kit and only parts in the official Pinewood Derby kit?
RANDY
[coaxing Stan through gritted teeth] Yes I do, yes I do.
STAN
[in a resigned voice] Yes I do.
OFFICIAL
Alright young man, good luck today. [hands the car back to Stan. He and Randy walk away]
RANDY
[to himself, pumping both fists] Oh! Yes! [nearby they run into Mr. Hollis and son]
MR. HOLLIS
Well well, look son, it's the Marshes.
RANDY
Ey Hollis. You, uh, you guys race already?
MR. HOLLIS
No, little Emmett hasn't gone yet. Think they're saving the best for last. [pats Emmett's head and holds up their car] Clocked her in at home at 1.5 seconds. It's the fastest car we've ever built.
RANDY
One point five?
[Pinewood Derby Colorado State Championship, track area.]
JUDGE
The time to beat is 1.9 seconds. May we please have... Brewster, Marsh, Jarvis, and Hollis. [the boys line up behind the starting gate, their cars in position. Emmett and Stan are next to each other]
MR. HOLLIS
Huh, only fitting our boys should be going head to head for their match, hey Marsh? Heh. [sips from a can of Dr Pep-er]
RANDY
Come on, Stan, you can do this! [claps enthusiastically]
JUDGE
Alright, kids, are you ready? Here we go, last race for the state championship in 3, 2, 1, Go! [the boys release their cars and Emmett's car takes the lead.]
MR. HOLLIS
You got it Emmett! [Stan's car begins to shimmy and spark, then stretch itself. It soon takes off, blowing hair and papers around. It crashes through the wall and up into the air outside, shearing off a tree limb. It kills a bird on its way up, then buzzes a passenger jet plane. It heads right out into space. Everyone in the competition goes outside and follows the car's trajectory]
RANDY
Oh yeah! [jumps around] Oh yeah! [jabs a finger at Hollis] Suck on that, Hollis!
[The Channel Nine news graphics appear.]
ANNOUNCER
This is Nine News at Ten.
ANCHORMAN
A Colorado boy and his father have set a new record at the Pinewood Derby. [a picture of the two winners appears over his left shoulder] Stan and Randy Marsh not only broke a speed record, but actually appear to have bent time and space and discovered warp speed. [Emmett is watching the news on his couch, sad that he lost] A parade was held for the winners earlier today [they're riding on a space shuttle float during the parade], and already offers for commercials and endorsement deals for the father and son appear to be pouring in. [Emmett goes to his father's study and trophy room and watches him]
EMMETT
Dad, I just want you to know I still love you. [a gun is cocked and Mr. Hollis kills himself with a gunshot through the head. The head and left arm quickly fall to his desk.] Waaaagh! [begins to hyperventilate] He's OK, he's OK, he's OK, he's OK, he's OK-
[Space. The car has run out of fuel and is now tumbling through space. A tractor beam comes on and freezes it in place, then pulls it towards a large ship.]
[Stan's house, day. Stan comes in and opens the door. Two agents are at the front door.]
AGENT MARX
Stan Marsh?
STAN
Yeah?
AGENT CLARK
I'm Agent Clark [on the left] and this is Agent Marx [on the right. Both men whip out their badges. They are members of the NSA] We'd like to talk to you about your Pinewood Derby car.
STAN
Aw crap, Dad! [the men enter the house and walk past Stan. He closes the door behind them]
AGENT CLARK
Young man, what we are about to tell you is a matter of national security. Yesterday every country and embassy on Earth was contacted by... an alien life force.
STAN
Alien?
AGENT MARX
[they turn around] Apparently the alien came across your Pinewood Derby car and is now headed to our planet.
STAN
What does it want?
AGENT CLARK
We believe that they intend to welcome us into the Galactic Federation of Planets. They will want to meet the people who discovered warp speed for our species.
RANDY
[coming down the stairs with a cup of coffee] Stan, did you use all the damned toilet paper agai-? [jumps back when he sees the men] Aw crap! [walks towards them defensively] What?! What do you guys want?! We said we only used what was in the kit! You got nothin' on us! You got nothin' on us!
STAN
Dad they aren't here for that.
RANDY
[lowers his guard and shakes Agent Marx's hand] Oh. Hi, I'm Randy Marsh.
AGENT CLARK
Mr. Marsh, we were just telling your son that thanks to you, we have made first contact with alien life.
RANDY
[surprised, softly] What? [looks to his right and says normally] Hey, hey Sharon.
AGENT MARX
NASA's confirmed that an alien ship has entered our solar system and it is headed here.
RANDY
So, so guess what? Our Pinewood Derby car found alien life in space.
SHARON
[walks in from the kitchen with her own cup of coffee] What? Oh my God.
RANDY
Yeah, but I guess it's just a dumb little race like you said, huh Sharon?
[South Park, evening. The town is gathered around an open space waiting for the aliens to drop down into the city. Channel 9 News and News 4 are waiting to record the event. An orchestra plays in a temporary gazebo, and a banner above it says "WELCOME, GALACTIC FRIENDS." An organizer guides Randy and Stan to a prime spot in the clearing.]
REPORTER
The world holds its breath as an alien ship prepares to land. Now that our planet has achieved warp speed, we're about to be welcomed into the universal society. All thanks to a father and son who broke the warp barrier using only the parts in this [holds up a packet] Pinewood Derby car kit.
GENERAL
Mr. Marsh, you are on with all the world leaders. [gives him a cell phone. Randy's now on a conference call]
RANDY
Hullo?
GORDON BROWN
Godspeed, Mr. Marsh.
NICOLAS SARKOZY
Ze nation of France iz with you.
TARO ASO
Good ruck witha 'harien, Mista Marsh.
HU JINTAO
Prease say herro froma China.
RANDY
Oh okay uh, uh stand by I- I think it's, I think it's landing. [A huge shadow falls over South Park as the ship descends. Three metallic feet come out of the bottom of the ship and set themselves on the asphalt, allowing the ship to land softly]
REPORTER
Our first encounter with extraterrestrial life is about to happen. Will it be like in Star Trek: First Contact? Or will it be more like Contact, with Jodie Foster? [the ship's doors open, a virtual ramp appears, and the alien walks down the ramp to the street.]
ALIEN
I seek the life forms that made this. [holds up the car Stan launched into space.]
RANDY
That's ours, Mr. Alien. We are the Marshes, Randy and Stan.
ALIEN
Oh yeah? [affects the manners and voice of a 1930's mobster, holds up a ray gun] You're gonna build me another one, see?
RANDY
He's got a gun!
ALIEN
Everyone down on the ground! [everyone gets on the ground with their hands over their heads] Get those hands up! Let me see those hands! Do it now! I mean it! Show me those hands! I'm Baby Fark McGee-zax, the greatest gangster this universe has ever seen, right?!
TOWNSMAN
You can't threaten us! [a blast from the alien's gun injures his thigh and he goes down] Ow!
MCGEE-ZAX
Who wants it next, huh?! [a shot of the crowd at Times Square] Anyone else on this planet wanna be a hero? [the crowd there covers its head, as do the various world leaders]
RANDY
What do you want?
MCGEE-ZAX
I'm on the lam. Got the entire Federation of Planets after me. But they ain't gonna catch me, ya got that?! They might have busted my warp drive, but you obviously know how to make 'em! [tosses the car to Randy, who catches it]
NEW YORKER
Screw this guy! He can't take out all of us! [McGee-zax fires into the air and the New Yorker gets a sparking sting on his right shoulder] Aargh!
MCGEE-ZAX
I can kill any mug on this two-bit planet I want! [a shot of McGee-zax from Akihabara, Tokyo. The Japanese cower and react to his image] You build me a new warp drive or you're all gonna get it, see?!
JUDGE
Fine. He can build you what you want. All he needs is the official Pinewood Derby kit. Right Marsh?
RANDY
Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's all we need, huh Stan? [under his breath] Oh boy.
[The South Park Market parking lot. Stan and Randy attempt to recreate the supersonic car they made earlier. Just as in the basement, Randy is to the left.]
RANDY
Okay, let's ah put the wheels on now, son.
MCGEE-ZAX
What's takin' so long?! You're stallin'!
STEPHEN
Come on Randy, just build him the warp drive and he'll leave us alone.
RANDY
We're working on it! [McGee-zax begins to pace back and forth behind them]
STAN
[whispering] Dad. Dad, you know we can't make the car go as fast as before with only the approved Pinewood Derby kit.
RANDY
[whispering] Yeah, thanks Stan, I know that.
STAN
[whispering] Well we have to tell them we used something outside the kit.
RANDY
[whispering] Do you have any idea how stupid that would make us look?!
MCGEE-ZAX
Alright, that does it! [fires off another shot into the sky. A second later Randy gets a call on his cell phone]
RANDY
Hello?
SILVIO BERLUSCONI
They justa blew up our government building! Ya got to hurry!
GORDON BROWN
Mr. Marsh, why won't you finish the Pinewood Derby car?!
RANDY
Will you just give us a minute?! Gau!!
STAN
Come on, Dad. We've gotta come clean.
RANDY
[feeling the stress of urgency] Awhuh. [a siren sounds in the distance. In the sky another space ship shows up, with police sirens on it]
MCGEE-ZAX
Aw zahts, it's the intergalactic police.
RANDY
What?! [McGee-zax pulls out a small remote control from his left front pocket and aims it at his ship. One click and the ship is cloaked in invisibility. McGee-zax then takes Stan captive and backs away holding a gun to Stan's head]
MCGEE-ZAX
You'd better get rid of 'em or your whole planet is gonna get it, see?! [goes towards South Park Market] You tell 'em you ain't seen nothin', you got that?! [the sliding doors open and he takes Stan into the store] I ain't goin' to space jail! [the doors close. The police ship lands and two space officers come out and walk down their ramps to the ground. One officer has two mouths, the other just one. Both of them have four eyes and broad shoulders]
OFFICER 1
'Scuse us, Earthlings, but uh, we've been in pursuit of a criminal from the Xenon galaxy. Fella by the name of Baby Fark McGee-zax?
RANDY
Uh, no. [pulls at his ear vigorously] We haven't seen anything.
OFFICER 1
Well, ya think anyone else on your planet might have seen him?
RANDY
Ahhh actually I- I happen to be on the phone with all the world leaders- I- I can ask. Uh yeah, listen, these, uh, police aliens are here, and they're wondering if anyone's seen an alien named Baby Fark McGee-zax.
HU JINTAO
Uh uh no, no, we haven't seen arien.
NICOLAS SARKOZY
Uh we've seen nothing here in France.
RANDY
Sorry, nobody in the world has seen anything. Uh... what did this... criminal alien do, exactly?
OFFICER 1
He stole over 600 parsohns of space cash from the universal bank. You're absolutely sure you didn't see an alien land here?
RANDY
No, we're sure.
OFFICER 1
So then... we're the first aliens you've ever seen?
RANDY
That's right, yep, you're the first ones.
OFFICER 1
You don't seem that excited about your first contact with alien life.
RANDY
...Uh. That's r-. That's right! [shakes his head in mock surprise] Oh, oh my God! Hey everybody, we just made first contact!
OFFICER 1
[hands Randy his translucent shimmering business card] If you do see any sign of the other alien or the space cash you-
RANDY
We will give you a call!
OFFICER 1
Mathematical semi-tonal is fine. [the space officers go back up their ramps to the ship, the ramps vanish behind them. Two blinking orbs appear above the ship and it takes off.]
[The police ship.]
OFFICER 1
Huh.
OFFICER 2
[uses both mouths] Something wrong, sir?
OFFICER 1
I don't know, Davert. Just somethin' about that planet didn't feel right. [blinks]
[Back on the parking lot, Randy gives Stan the car body.]
RANDY
Alright son, now you just paint the racing stripe like you did before.
MCGEE-ZAX
I don't need it painted, I just need it functional, all right?! [waves the gun around]
RANDY
Hey, the right paint job is a big part of what makes a Pinewood Derby car go fast!
JUDGE
That's true.
MCGEE-ZAX
I swear, if you don't have that thing workin' in three minutes this whole planet is done for!
STAN
Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated.
RANDY
No. I've got it all figured out, son. You have to kill the alien.
STAN
[alarmed] Kill the alien?
RANDY
Sshh! I've been filing down this piece of metal into a shank. I'm gonna call him over here to look at the car, and when I do, you shove that in his neck.
STAN
No. Dad, we don't even know what'll happen.
MCGEE-ZAX
What are you two whispering about, riiight?
RANDY
Oh no, that's uh that's it. We're done. Uh here. Come, come take a look.
STAN
Dad? [McGee-zax comes in for a closer look]
RANDY
Here, see? Here look, look real close at the axles here. [McGee-zax studies the axles, and Stan jabs him in the neck with the shank, making him bleed and vomit profusely and then die] Yeahaah! Ahalright, you got him son!
[The general takes the remote from McGee-zax's corpse and removes the cloak from the ship with it.]
GENERAL
Alright men, check the ship. [he and a bunch of lab techs board the ship and look around]
RANDY
[kneels by Stan] You see Stan? What did Daddy tell you? Everything worked out.
STAN
I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right.
RANDY
But Stan, it's over now. We'll never have to lie again.
GENERAL
Hey Marsh, get in here! [Randy gets up and goes up the ramp into the ship. Stan follows.]
[Inside the ship. The general, lab techs, and a few townsfolk are inside now. Stan and Randy make their way through the group.]
STEPHEN
Can you believe it?
RANDY
Oh my God. Spaaace caaash. [Before them is a towering pile of glittering blue bills]
GENERAL
Looks like those alien cops were right. Guess you should call them back now.
RANDY
Right. [takes out his phone but has second thoughts.] Or what if we didn't call the cops?
STEPHEN
Huh?
RANDY
Well I mean... [walks up to the pile] this is a lot of space cash, guys. Think o'what we could do with it.
STAN
No, Dad-
MR. GARRISON
He's right. We don't have to call the police back.
GENERAL
All right, let's get the cash put into boxes! [the men get to work]
[Outside the ship. Randy is pleased with himself as he goes down the ramp. Stan follows him out.]
STAN
Whoawhoawhoa Dad, what are we doing?
RANDY
Will you relax, Stan? [his phone rings and he answers it]
TARO ASO
Don't think you can keep the all the space cash for yourself!
ANGELA MERKEL
That's right! This is all of our planet; the space cash belongs to all of us!
JOHN HOWARD
Either America shares that space cash with the rest of the world or we will tell the space cops!
RANDY
Alright, fine, look: there's plenty of space cash to go around! [hangs up on the leaders] Thanks to us, our planet is rich, son! [the general and other federal agents take the space cash away in boxes as Randy grins]
[Four days later, in front of the fugitive ship. Randy is on his cell phone negotiating with the other world leaders.]
RANDY
Oh no, China, we get to keep the ship. Because we killed the alien, you boner! Oh-oh come on England, you got just as much of the space cash as everyone else! [A siren is heard. Randy looks up to the sky and sees the space cops returning, but forgets to cloak the ship] Oh crap it's the cops! Hang on. [the police ship lands and the alien officers exit their ship] Ah hey, space officers.
OFFICER 1
Looks like the alien criminal did land here after all.
RANDY
Oh, that- You were talking about that alien. Oh yeah that one, he was here, yeah. He landed here, but we... we killed him.
OFFICER 1
And so, did you find the missing space cash?
RANDY
[thinks a moment] Nnno. Space cash? No. [strokes his ear, then rubs his neck with his left hand] There wasn't any space cash.
OFFICER 2
Well maybe someone else on your planet knows where it is?
RANDY
Hey ah ah, any of you other countries see any space cash?
VLADIMIR PUTIN
No space cash.
TARO ASO
No we haven't-
GORDON BROWN
No space cash.
LUIZ INÁCIO LULA DA SILVA
No.
RANDY
Yeah, it doesn't look like the space cash was ever here.
OFFICER 1
Uh huh. Guess he must have dropped it off at some other planet.
RANDY
[relieved] Probably.
OFFICER 1
Well you folks all take care now. [the officers turn to leave, but they turn around once again] Just... one more thing, Earthlings, uh... We had some images done of your planet and it appears that one of your poorer countries - Mexico? - has built 32 new hospitals and seven water parks in the last four days.
RANDY
[silent for a moment] Oh... Yeah, Mexico. You know oh, oh, yeah. All of us other countries chipped in and uh, gave Mexico some aid. Yeah they really needed... some new water parks.
OFFICER 1
Uh huh. Have a good day. [the officers turn and head up the ramps. The doors close and the police ship leaves the planet once again]
RANDY
[gets back on the phone] Hey. Hey Mexico! We said no spending the space cash yet! [a shot of the Mexican president at his desk with a new water park right outside his window] What the hell are you doing?! Will some country that speaks Spanish yell at Mexico please? They're gonna ruin everything!
[Stan's room, later. Stan sits on his bed and holds his trophy, but he's not happy about it. He looks at it for a long while, then gets off his bed, walks over to his toy box, and puts the trophy on the lid. He puts his hands behind his back and holds one wrist with the other hand. He then looks at newspaper clippings from the day of the race. The headlines are as follows: "FATHER AND SON SET PINEWOOD DERBY RECORD", "WARP SPEED DISCOVERED", "DAD AND SON GREET VISITORS FROM OTHER WORLD!", "DERBY WINNER KILLS ALIEN," "CHINA BUILDS 48 NEW SOCCER STADIUMS." Stan sighs silently, sadly.]
[The Marsh house, kitchen. Randy is back on the phone with the world leaders, but he's getting disheveled.]
RANDY
No, Japan! Will you listen to me for five seconds?! If you keep building giant robots the cops are gonna ask questions!
TARO ASO
Well then why can Engrand build a nuclear power plant?!
RANDY
Nobody can build anything!!
GORDON BROWN
Yeah, well, it's not even gonna matter, because Finland is thinking about telling the space cops the truth!
RANDY
Wha?! Finland?! [Stan walks by the kitchen to see what's going on]
MATTI VANHANEN
We believe the aliens are going to find out sooner or later what we did. It's best we come clean now.
RANDY
[getting exasperated] Will you just relax, Finland?! Nobody is gonna find out anything.
MATTI VANHANEN
I'm sorry, but our nation is resolved. We cannot live with the guilt anymore.
RANDY
Okay okay! [Stan leaves] You're right. You're right, Finland! Okay? You're right. Can you just... let us other countries talk pr-private, for a moment?
MATTI VANHANEN
Very well. [goes on hold]
RANDY
All right you guys, we've gotta get rid of Finland.
HU JINTAO
Yep, we gotta take out Finrand, they gonna squeal.
JOHN HOWARD
Yeah, I think we all agree. Guys? [eight leaders are shown onscreen and they all agree]
[Outer space. Missiles from around the world begin to flow towards Finland and bomb the place.]
[The Marsh house, night. The family is having a nice quiet dinner when the police ship returns to South Park. Randy wipes his mouth dry and leaves the table.]
RANDY
Oh dammit!
[The landing area. A crowd gathers again and Randy walks up to the ship.]
RANDY
Uh hey, space officers. How can we help you?
OFFICER 1
Well we're a little puzzled over one of your countries? Uh, Finland?
RANDY
[rubs his neck again] Whaa-wha-what about it?
OFFICER 2
It appears to have been... destroyed.
RANDY
[feigning surprise] Whaaat? Oh my God, not Finland.
CROWD
Oh no, not Finland.
RANDY
Hey guys, Finland's dead.
VLADIMIR PUTIN
Oh no. No! Nooo.
TARO ASO
Noo, not a Finrand!
RAILA ODINGA
All of Finland, gone.
RANDY
Yeah, somebody better break the news to Norway; they were really close.
OFFICER 1
None of you knew anything about Finland's destruction?
RANDY
[rubs his neck again] No, I mean... Odds are, they nuked themselves. You know, suicide.
OFFICER 2
We didn't say anything about nukes.
RANDY
Or, or whatever they did, I'm sayin'.
STAN
'Scuse me! 'Scuse me! [the crowd makes way for him as he walks up to the ship] Everyone, I have an announcement to make. I'm giving back my Pinewood Derby trophy! [hands it to the judge]
JUDGE
[takes the trophy] What?
RANDY
Stan?
STAN
The truth is, I don't deserve this trophy. 'Cause I cheated on my Pinewood Derby car. I used something not in the approved kit. [the crowd reacts to this admission.]
TARO ASO
Not in the approved kit?!
JOHN HOWARD
He cheated on the Pinewood Derby?
STAN
This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow. [everyone, including the world leaders from Kenya and South Korea, hangs on Stan's every word]
RANDY
Well Stan, we're proud of you for coming clean. But it doesn't change the fact that you cheated. Go to your room, son.
OFFICER 1
Your son seems to have some pretty inspirational words. You sure you Earthlings have nothing else to tell us?
RANDY
[gets on the phone with the other leaders] Hey uh, do we have anything else to tell the space cops?
GORDON BROWN
Nope.
NICOLAS SARKOZY
Nope.
HAN SEUNG-SOO
No changes.
RAILA ODINGA
Nope.
VLADIMIR PUTIN
No changes.
LUIZ INÁCIO LULA DA SILVA
Nope.
HU JINTAO
No. Tell them no.
JOHN HOWARD
No changes.
RANDY
[rubs his neck] Yeah, no, we've told you everything, space officers.
OFFICER 1
All right, that's it then. Come on out sir, it appears to be over. [a door on the lower level of the ship drops down from the outer wall to become a ramp, and a figure stands at the entrance, then walks down the ramp. The figure looks familiar...]
RANDY
[jumps back in horror] Aw shit, it's Baby Fark McGee-zax!
MCGEE-ZAX
My real name is Kevern Zaksor. I am the ambassador to new planet testing. [Stan and Randy look at each other]
GORDON BROWN
What the hell are they talking about?
KEVERN ZAKSOR
These are not space cops. [the officers remove their helmets] There is no space jail, and space cash is only worth what you as a planet decided it was worth. I mean, how stupid is your species? Space jail? Baby Fark McGee-zax?
RANDY
It was... a trick?
OFFICER 2
Whenever a civilization discovers warp speed, we want to bring them into the Federation of Planets, but first we do the space cash test, to see if that species is worthy of joining.
KEVERN ZAKSOR
Needless to say, you all failed. [he and the two officers go back inside the ship. He turns at his door's entrance and clears his throat] People of earth, since you did not return the space cash, your species and your planet is hereby forever blocked off and barred from the rest of the universe. Goodbye. [his door closes. The ramps all go back into the ship and the ship takes off]
RANDY
No heywaitwait, no! [the ship zooms away from the planet and leaves behind two probes that evolve into a cube of energy shields] Well that sucks!
End of Pinewood Derby

synopsis:Cartman's dream of living the life of a pirate will come true if he can just get to Somalia.

script:Fatbeard

[South Park Elementary Cafeteria, lunchtime. The boys are seated at a table and Cartman runs up to them with a map.]
CARTMAN
You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of!
BUTTERS
We can?
STAN
What are you talking about, dude?
CARTMAN
Haven't you assholes been watching the news? [rolls the map flat on the table] Pirating is back, my friends. Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas! The stuff we've all dreamed about! And it's all happening right here: [points to the circled nation on the map] Somalia.
CLYDE
Somalia? Where's that?
CARTMAN
North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath.
BUTTERS
[in thrall] Whoa.
CARTMAN
I've worked it all out on Expedia. [traces the route from Denver to Somalia] We can take Southwest Airlines to Miami, then Dubai Air here to Cairo, and then it's just a 49-hour bus ride into Mogadishu, with all the booty and plunder a pirate could want.
KYLE
Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia.
CARTMAN
Right, and wi- [stops] Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle.
KYLE
No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket.
CARTMAN
Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow.
KYLE
Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life.
CARTMAN
Then why don't you wanna go?
KYLE
Well, c-cause dude, I'm Jewish, a-and you know...
KYLE, CARTMAN
Jews can't be pirates.
CARTMAN
That's true. Well, I'm glad you've finally come to terms with your disability, Kyle. [rolls up the map] Gentlemen, I'm off to start planning! [walks away]
KYLE
[puts his hands together and prays] Please. Please let him go.
[South Park Elementary, Garrison's class. The students are in their seats. Three notes play over the PA system.]
GORDON STOLTSKI
Good morning, students. These are the morning announcements. Teacher-parent conferences have been rescheduled to next Tuesday. [Mr. Garrison reads during the announcements] Please inform your parents. The gym is being repainted, and is closed until tomorrow afternoon. And now for a special announcement:
CARTMAN
Avast there, mateys! [the class looks up at the speaker] Do ya have a thirst for adventure on the high seas of life? [a shot of some kids in the hall, including sixth graders] Arrre you sick and tired of your parents and teachers telling you what to do all the time? [a shot of the kindergarten class, and its teacher] Then join Captain Cartman's Perfect Pirate Club, arrrr! [back to Mr. Garrison's class] Just imagine it, me hearties! A life without rules, without homework and chores! You can live the pirate's life in Somalia, me friends! [Kyle looks at the blackboard, his eyes half-closed. Stan begins to write stuff down] Even Kyle said so. [Kyle buries his face into his desk] Our first official pirate mee'in will be 4 pm today at Kevin Stoley's house!
KEVIN
At my house? Why my house?
CARTMAN
There will be refreshments served! So make sure your mom goes to the grocery store, Kevinnn! So come one, come all! The invitation is open to any student who wants to be a pirate, and who isn't Jewish, Mexican or ginger! Arrrgh!
GORDON
And for lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving taco salad or hoagie sandwiches. Thank you.
[Kevin Stoley's house, basement, just past 4. Butters is leading the meeting, as Cartman hasn't arrived yet.]
BUTTERS
Ahoy fellow club members. Congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives behind to become pirates. [only four kids showed up - Kevin, Ike, Clyde, and Gordon Stoltski] Your life of boredom is at an end, thanks to Captain Cartman. All hands on deck! [blows into a whistle. To his left, by the stairs, is a door with a sign, "Captain" on it. Cartman enters the room though that door.]
CARTMAN
Attention! All right, you booty lovers! So you decided to join Captain Cartman's edjeh... [sees Gordon Stoltski, then goes into a low voice] Uh, guys, who let in the g-i-n-g-e-r?
CLYDE
Well, there's really not that many of us. We figured we should let him join.
CARTMAN
But guys, g-i-n-g-e-rs can't be pirates because they don't have souls. Please get it out of here.
GORDON
Fine, I don't wanna be a pirate anyways! [leaves his seat and goes out the stairs and out of the basement]
CARTMAN
Okay, anyways. Now enough small talk, lads! It's time for us to start rapin' and plunderin'!
BUTTERS
Yeah!
CARTMAN
We set course tomorrow! I purchased everyone's ticket online using me mother's credit card!
CLYDE
And your mom is okay with that?
CARTMAN
Dude, I'm a pirate! What the devil do I care what me mudder thinks anymore?
BUTTERS
Neato!
CARTMAN
Alright lads! Go home and write your farewell letters to your families! The land of pirates awaits! [holds up a jeweled sword]
BUTTERS
Pirates ho! [holds up his own small sword. The others follow suit with daggers]
CLYDE, IKE
Pirates ho!
KEVIN
Ho! [his sword is a lightsaber. Cartman looks at it in disbelief]
CARTMAN
Kevin, Goddammit! [Kevin turns off the lightsaber's light]
[Montage. A passenger jet flies out of Denver International.]
CLERK
Have a good flight. Next, please? [Cartman approaches with his crew. He hands the clerk his payment]
CARTMAN
We be headin' to Somaaliaa. By way of Miami to Cairo. And take care o' you put us in an exit row, you land lubber!
CLERK
[slowly] I see. You five boys are all booked through to Cairo by yourselves?
CARTMAN
That we be, lass. It's all paid for on me mudder's credit card.
BUTTERS
[has second thoughts and turns around] Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this.
CARTMAN
What?!
BUTTERS
It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it.
CLYDE
Yeah maybe we should think about this.
CARTMAN
You guys, the fuck? Are you forgetting how crappy your lives are?! All the homework, the rules?! Butters, do you really wanna just go back to school, where people just make fun of you?
BUTTERS
Huh, who, you mean you?
CARTMAN
Yes! Do you really wanna go back to that?!
BUTTERS
No, I'm sick of it!
CARTMAN
Well all right then, fag! We can't turn back now! The path to adventure lies just beyond this ticket counter! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the FUCK?
BUTTERS
He's right, lads. To adventure!
[The flight path is shown. It follows the path Cartman traced on the map. Butters is giddy looking out the window. As the plane crosses the Atlantic the boys play in their seats. Once the plane reaches Cairo, the boys transfer onto a bus and go south across Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, and finally Somalia, ending in Mogadishu. A shot of the city from the air, looking east. The bus stops and everyone gets off. The road underneath it is dusty. The boys walk away from the bus, then it rolls off. They can't believe what they see.]
CLYDE
This is Somalia?
BUTTERS
Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?
CARTMAN
The FUCK?! [some Somalis notice them and stop to look] 'Scuse me, where are the pirates? [stops a man walking by] Hey, hey we're looking for the pirates? Where can we find the-uh! [the man ignores him and keeps on walking.] Butters, get the phrase book out. [Butters approaches with the phrase book in hand] Ask these people where the pirates are.
BUTTERS
Uhh, [mumbles a bit] mahjey burazi?
SOMALI 1
Burad. Iyaja dene zaredeko.
SOMALI 2
Buradi wakuwasa.
BUTTERS
Oh. He-he says they're in there. [points to his left. A mustard-colored building is being defended by two guards.]
CARTMAN
Ah, nice. Come on, mateys! [the boys turn and walk towards the building]
SOMALI 2
Mayasuk! Hageha-aden! Letka suwahater! [Translation: "No! wait! Don't go in there! Those people are dangerous!"]
CARTMAN
Yes, bebebudjuhbluhbluhbluhbluh. Thank you. [dismissing the warning, he and his crew continue on to the building.]
[The pirates' lair. They go about their business until they notice the boys enter. Cartman walks on into the middle of the lair.]
CARTMAN
Avast! [no one else says a word. In a low voice, he says] These aren't pirates, they're just a bunch of black people.
[The following is taken from the episode, as they are English subtitles.]
PIRATE 1
"Is this some kind of joke?"
PIRATE 2
"I don't know what the fuck this is!"
CARTMAN
I am Captain Cartman and this here be my terrible crew! We be lookin' for a ship to pirate with.
PIRATE 1
"These white children will bring a high price in ransom money!"
PIRATE 2
"Take them out to the nearest European boat! Show them we have children hostages!" [surrounding pirates stand up with their rifles]
CARTMAN
Yes, very nice. Apparently, these are the pirates.
[The pirates' bay. Several pirates walk the boys down the dock.]
PIRATE 3
[wearing a #13 jersey] "Move it! Go over that way!"
PIRATE 4
[wearing a mustard-colored shirt] "We will get a nice ransom for you!" [the fifth pirate wears a black shirt]
CARTMAN
Oh, excellent! They're taking us to a ship. Once we commandeer our vessel the plundering will be easy indeed, lads. [they all stop next to a small boat]
PIRATE 3
"Get on board!"
PIRATE 4
"Do it now!" [the boys turn to see the boat the pirates want them on]
CARTMAN
This... is your pirate boat? Dude, the FUCK! Alright, seriously you guys? What kind of pirates are you? I mean, really? The FUCK, dude, the FUCK?!
PIRATE 3
"Get on the boat now!"
PIRATE 4
"Move!"
CARTMAN
Alright lads, guess we'll have to settle with this meager ship. Two of you sit aft and two of you sit in the front.
KEVIN
I gotta sit middle 'cause I get motion sickness. [the other boys climb in and all four end up on the same row]
CARTMAN
Kevin, Jesus Christ! [a pirate starts the motor and the boat moves forward] Hard to starboard, lads! There's sure to be lots of booties out hyah! [Clyde begins to cry] Clyde, the fuck?!
CLYDE
You said there was gonna be crystal clear lagoons and treasure and plunderrrr! [continues crying]
CARTMAN
Calm down, Clyde. Everything's gonna be okay!
CLYDE
No it's not! You made me run away to be a pirate and there's not even any treasure!
CARTMAN
Ike, will you do something about Clyde, please? [Ike looks at Clyde and smacks him. Clyde stops crying] Very nice, Ike. [looks ahead] All right me hearties! Keep your eyes open for boats to plunder! [before them is a French cruise ship]
[The French cruise ship, day.]
FRENCH CAPTAIN
"Keep your eyes open, Mr. Leon. These waters are full of renegades and thieves."
MR. LEON
[ship's navigator] "Yes, Captain!" [an alarm sounds and the captain leaves the bridge to find out what's going on.]
DECK HAND
[sees the captain and approaches] "Captain! We have an unknown vessel approaching quickly to port!"
FRENCH CAPTAIN
"Damn pirates! Alert the crew! All hands on deck!" [the little boat pulls up next to the cruise ship. The captain and his crew gather in front of the bridge and the captain looks at the pirates through his binoculars]
PIRATE 5
[through a bullhorn] "We demand ransom for these children! Pay us or we will kill them!"
FRENCH CAPTAIN
"They've got CHILDREN HOSTAGES!"
CRUISE ATTENDANT
"My God!"
FRENCH CAPTAIN
"Get the U.N. on the radio. Advise them of the situation."
PIRATE 5
"We want 5,000 Euros! You easily have that much on board!"
CARTMAN
Du-dude! You're doing it all wrong! Let me handle this. [takes the bullhorn from him] Alright ya scalliwags! Surrender your plunder and let me send my shot across your bow!
PIRATE 4
[moves over to Cartman and aims his rifle at him] "We are going to start killing them! Starting with the fat one!"
CARTMAN
Yeah that's good, but now go ARRRGH!
BUTTERS
ARRRRRRGH!
[Kyle's house, day. Kyle is looking mighty relaxed now that Cartman is gone. He's in the living room talking on the phone with Stan.]
KYLE
Yeah? Okay, and you checked with Kenny and Tolkien? He's not just staying at their houses?
STAN
[in the kitchen at his house] No, dude, everyone's checked. I think Cartman really ran away to Somalia.
KYLE
Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go!
STAN
You really think he'll die in Somalia?
KYLE
[chuckles] Oh for sure, dude! It's the most God-forsaken place on the planet! Things are finally gonna be normal around here.
SHEILA
[voice only, but soon comes down the stairs with Gerald behind her] Oh God! Oh God, what did we do wrong, Gerald?! [She has a letter in her hand. Kyle's happiness vanishes]
GERALD
Take it easy. We'll find him.
KYLE
I'll call you back. [hangs up. Sheila approaches him.]
SHEILA
Oh Kyle, he's gone! Your little brother's run away from home!
KYLE
What? Are you sure?
SHEILA
He left a note saying he's never coming back.
KYLE
[takes the note and reads it aloud] "Dear Mommy and Daddy: I am running away. I am sorry, but I can no longer handle the monotony of middle-class life. Everyone at school is a fucking idiot, and if one more person talked to me about that Susan Boyle performance of Les Misérables I was going to puke my balls out through my mouth. I love you all, but I have to move on. I'm going to Somalia to be a-" to be a pirate?! Oh shit!
SHEILA
Oh Gerald, what are we gonna do?
GERALD
It's alright, he couldn't have gone far. Let's call the other kids' houses. [leaves with Sheila and the phone]
KYLE
Oh God. What have I done?
[The French cruise ship, day.]
PIRATE 4
"We are growing impatient! Give us what we want or they die!"
CARTMAN
The FUCK are you pirates doing?! Are we gonna plunder them or not?!
FRENCH CAPTAIN
"Alright! Alright! We are going to give you what you want! But you must hand over the children UNHARMED!"
PIRATE 5
"The money first!" [a crewman throws down a bag of money to the small boat and one of the pirates catches it and opens it. A rope ladder is unfurled so the boys could climb up to the cruise ship] "Go! Get on the boat! Move!"
CARTMAN
Alright, let's go! [the boys go up the ladder and board the ship]
CRUISE ATTENDANT
"We got 'em - They're safe!" [the pirate boat turns and zooms away]
FRENCH CAPTAIN
[to the pirates] "Your crimes will not go unpunished!" [turns and faces the kids] "Are you kids alright?"
CRUISE ATTENDANT
"Did they hurt you?"
CARTMAN
Quiet, you sons of biscuit eaters! This boat is now pirate propertih! Now get ye to your lifeboat, lest you wanna be shark bait!
FRENCH CAPTAIN
"What is this?!"
CARTMAN
Plunder the booty, lads! This ship is ours!
BUTTERS
Okay! [runs off to plunder]
CARTMAN
I said, get off my boat!
FRENCH CAPTAIN
"Hey! You can't order us around!" [Kevin walks up with his lightsaber and turns it on. The captain and crew jump back. Kevin waves it around, Cartman rolls his eyes to the right, and the captain and crew move in that direction. They all head to a lifeboat]
FRENCH CAPTAIN AND CREW
[Talking over each other] Qu'est qu'il passe!? Mon Dieu! ("What's going on!? My God!")
CARTMAN
That's it! Get in there you swarmy dogs! [the captain and crew get on the lifeboat] Lower 'em down, Ike. [Ike lowers the lifeboat to the ocean]
FRENCH CAPTAIN
"Scoundrels! You will pay for this!"
BUTTERS
Have a good day! [the lifeboat is safely on the water. Cartman quickly begins to make changes. The French flag comes down and the skull and bones one goes up. Cartman walks up to the the ship's bow]
CARTMAN
Hard to port, lads!
CLYDE
[relaying the message] Hard to port!
BUTTERS
[at the wheel. Ike stands on a stool next to him] What's "port"?!
CARTMAN
Just make the boat go that way, kind of. [the ship ends up turning towards shore, towards the pirates' lair.]
[Pirate's lair, docks. The 3 Somali pirates have just finished tying up their boat when they stop and look towards the sea. The ship's horn blows and the ship heads towards the dock, with Cartman standing at the bow.]
CARTMAN
That's good. Now bring her around topside. [the cruise ship pulls up alongside the pier and lowers the rope ladder. The boys get off the ship and head back to the lair. Cartman stops for a moment and points it out to the pirates] Now that's a pirate ship!
[Pirate's lair, bar. Armed Somali pirates are sitting around and chatting with each other.]
CARTMAN
[the boys head enter the bar] A fine day o' plunderin' we had, boys! What about yourselves? [starts tossing wads of cash at pirates] Here you are, lads. Plenty of booty to go around. [walks to an open table and has the boys sit there] A round of grog for me boys! [a pirate brings drinks to the table and passes them out] A round of grog for everyone! [the pirate leaves] The fuck is this? This is water in a Dixie cup! Alright, Goddammit, really you guys! What kind of pirates are you?! Look at yourselves! You disgrace the Blackbeard! I don't know where you people get off calling yourselves pirates! [gets up and walks around] Little beat-up boats, water in Dixie cups. I mean, I mean look, look at this guy! [the pirate he's looking at has lost his left leg from the knee down] Look at this guy for Christ's sake! [rips a leg from a chair and ties it up the pirate's left leg] I mean, how hard is this, people?! [the pirate grins and hobbles away with his new peg leg. Cartman walks back to the boys' table, then stands on it] I tell you lads, if we're gonna be the most feared people on Earth, then there needs to be some Goddamned changes around here!
Weee drink and we pillage and we do what we please!
We get all that we want for free!
CARTMAN, BUTTERS
We'll kick your ass and rape your lass.
Somalian pirates we!
So with a yo ho ho!
[No one says a thing]
CARTMAN
[sighs] Goddamnit people!
With a yo ho ho!
PIRATES
[awkwardly] Yo ho ho.
CARTMAN
And with a yee hee hee!
PIRATES
[awkwardly] Yee hee hee.
CARTMAN
We take to the African sea!
We'll brave the squalls and bust your balls
Somalian pirates we!
PIRATES
Somalian pirates we.
[Butters mops the deck with the pirates. Cartman leads other pirates off the ship with fresh booty. Other pirates build up a sand sculpture of a giant skull. Next, they paint "Beware!" on the cruise ship. Butters walks up to Ike, who puts a tri-corner hat on a Somali pirate. Nearby, pirates carry barrels of "ALE" between them.]
TOGETHER
We left our homes and we left our mudders
to go on a pillagin' spree!
We'll cut off your ears and break your toes
and make you drink our pee!
And if you sail into our waters,
you best hear this decree:
We'll take your boat, set your ass afloat!
[One of the barrels has another pirate in it.]
PIRATE
Somalian pirate we.
CARTMAN
Nice.
And with a yo ho ho!
[A shot of the sand sculpture.]
PIRATES
Yo ho ho!
[A shot Clyde and Kevin raising the flag on the flagpole, then of Cartman nailing down the lair's new name: Skull Cove.]
CARTMAN
And a tricky lahty do!
PIRATES
Tricky lahty do!
[Cartman makes a choir out of the pirates and conducts them.]
CARTMAN, CHOIR
We'll shoot you in the face with glee!
Then we'll cut off your ears-
CARTMAN
Okay okay, let's stop there for a minute. Remember, on tricka lahty do, that's a "lahty do" Okay, really need you guys to enunciate the "lahty" Uh, Nadif, if I can get you and Abdikaram to sing the harmony on the second "yo ho". And uh, Hashmish, is it? I'm sorry, but you're a little flat. Remember to sing out, don't close your throat, m'kay? So let's go from uh, bar 14. We'll pick up after the quarter rest. Ike? [Ike is at a spinet piano]
PIRATE CHOIR
Somalian pirates we.
CARTMAN
Better!
With a yo ho ho!
[Cartman looks out over the cove with a telescope from the crow's nest. The cruise ship, now called "The Black Diamond," pulls up along another French ship and force its crew to surrender. Cartman pours water over a lazy crocodile.]
CHOIR
Yo ho ho!
CARTMAN
And a tricky lahty do!
CHOIR
Tricky lahty do!
CARTMAN, CHOIR
We'll shoot you in the face with glee!
Then we'll cut off your cock and feed it to a croc.
IKE
Somalian pirates we.
[Ike sets off a coconut cannonball, but the coconut simply falls out. Next is the big finish, with everyone gathered around Cartman on the beach.]
PIRATE CHOIR
Somaliaaan piiiraaates weeeeee.
CARTMAN
Somaliaaan piiiraaates weeeeee.
[Off shore is a tanker called "Paolo." The French crew is now on board with cups of water and draped in blankets, and the tanker's captain is on the phone with the U.N.]
PAOLO CAPTAIN
We found them adrift in a lifeboat, sir. They say that pirates took their ship by force.
U.N. LEADER
Damn pirates! What's causing them to suddenly be so much more active? Is the crew okay?
PAOLO CAPTAIN
Yes sir. They're French, so they surrendered immediately. [addresses the crew] Once the pirates boarded your ship how did they force you off?
FRENCH CAPTAIN
Il avait un lightsabeur. ("He had a lightsaber")
CRUISE ATTENDANT
Oui. Un lightsabeur. ("Yes. A lightsaber")
DECK HAND
Le lightsabeur -- terrible. ("The lightsaber...it was terrible")[does lightsaber sound effects, then sobs.]
PAOLO CAPTAIN
Sir, the pirates appear to have forced the French crew off their boat with a lightsaber.
U.N. LEADER
My God, pirates are getting better-equipped every day! Gentlemen, I want the President of the United States on the phone. We can no longer fight the pirates on the seas. We have to take them out where they live.
[Skull Cove, later. Cartman enjoys a drink from a coconut shell.]
CARTMAN
What did I tell you, Butters? This is the good life, huh? [a shot is heard, followed by commotion from the pirates. Cartman and the boys walk over to a crowd of pirates gathered around something] What's going on?
PIRATE 6
"We have a hostage!"
PIRATE 7
"Another American arrived on the bus!"
CARTMAN
Ahhh, good. A hostage will bring a fine ransom. [the crowd splits in two and Kyle is shown. Kyle is tied up so he can't use his arms. Ike looks happy to see Kyle.] Well well well well well!
[A news flash.]
ANNOUNCER
This is CNN... N.
ANCHORMAN
Breaking news of yet another pirate crisis in Somalia. Members of NATO received word today that pirates have captured an American child and are demanding ten million Euros for his safe release. U.S Navy ships have been deployed and the pirate standoff is about to get ugly.
[Skull Cove, later. Cartman paces back and forth with confidence.]
CARTMAN
Well well well well well well well well well Kyle! You came all this way to try and join my pirate club.
KYLE
No, fatass, I came to get my brother! We all have to get out of here! It isn't safe.
CARTMAN
"It isn't safe." That's not what you said back in the cafeteria, Kyle. In the cafeteria you said Somalia was "awesome."
KYLE
I know! I was lying then!
CARTMAN
Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can't even keep them straight. You just couldn't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home.
KYLE
This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive! [a fish walks out of the water on hind legs, squawks, turn around and goes back into the ocean] Cartman, just give me my brother [Cartman turns around and faces Kyle] and let us get out of here!
CARTMAN
Your brother is with Butters taking inventory of our latest plunder, Kyle. You... just sit tight till we hear about your ransom money, hmhmm.
[Inside the pirates' lair, Butters and Ike stock a French tool box. Butters announces the items and hands them to Ike.]
BUTTERS
One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches.
PIRATE 4
[walks up to the two boys] Ey excuse me. Can I ask you a question?
BUTTERS
Oh. Uhuh sure, Galeed.
GALEED
Why did you Americans come here?
BUTTERS
Well, 'cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and homework.
IKE
Yeah, homework.
BUTTERS
And our parents hollered at us!
IKE
Yeah.
BUTTERS
So we wanted to come here and be pirates.
IKE
Piewets!
GALEED
But that's what I do not understand. Why would anyone "want" to be a pirate?
BUTTERS
Huh?
GALEED
Every day I dream that I can go to school. Learn about the world. But my mother, she is dyin' of AIDS, and there is no money for medicine. My father was killed trying to find food for us. Do you know how I feel every time we try to capture a boat? Scared. And not just scared because I might get killed, but scared because if I don't get something out of it, my family and friends are going to die. I don't want to be a pirate. I don't see how anybody would. [turns and quickly runs out of the lair.]
IKE
Oh my God. [rests his head against a chair]
BUTTERS
Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike?
IKE
I feel, like an asshole.
BUTTERS
Yeah, me too.
[Outside on the cove, Cartman has Kyle on the makeshift plank above the crocodile.]
CARTMAN
Go on! Walk the plank, you scurvy dog!
KYLE
Cartman, knock it off!
CARTMAN
That's Captain Cartman, you Jewswoggle!
PIRATE 6
"Do you think all American kids are as crazy as these are?"
PIRATE 8
"It's starting to look that way."
BUTTERS
[runs up to Eric with Ike in tow] Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home.
CARTMAN
What?!
BUTTERS
Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did. [Clyde begins to cry again]
CARTMAN
Clyde!
CLYDE
I hate it here and I wanna go home!! [begins to bawl]
CARTMAN
[threatens the other three boys with his sword; they back down] You guys cannot leave the pirate club now! How can you not want to stay in this paradise we've created?! In Somalia, people have no laws! They have no rules! And they never grow old!
KYLE
They never grow old because they die before they're 30!
CARTMAN
Nobody's goin' anywhere!! I'm the captain of this outfit! [whistles] To arms! [the real pirates gather around and aim their rifles at the boys] Now, is there any question who's in charge? I have an entire pirate crew willing to do anything for me!
PIRATE 5
"Hey, what's that?" [in the distance a U.S. ship gets into position]
COMMANDER
Alright men, remember, do not hit the white ones!
CARTMAN
Me and my crew are gonna go on piratin' forever! [a volley of bullets takes down all the pirates, leaving the six boys unharmed. The boys look at the carnage around them]
SNIPER
[several seconds later] Clear.
CARTMAN
The FUCK?!
End of Fatbeard

synopsis:Ike is being tormented by paranormal forces. Kyle brings in professional ghost hunters to help save his little brother.

script:Dead Celebrities

[The Broflovski house, night.]
GERALD
[voice over] You have been very very naughty! [a shot of Kyle's parents having sex in bed] You're a naughty girl! [begins to grunt with every thrust]
SHEILA
Oh yes, Gerald! I've been so naughty! [joins in the grunting for a few seconds] Ah, oh, oh, oh jeez! Oh! [their bedroom door opens]
GERALD
[quickly turns around and faces the door] What the?! ...Ike! [Ike is at the bedroom entrance looking scared. He's dragging a puppy plushie around] Ike, get back to bed right now!
IKE
I'm scared. There's a ghost.
GERALD
Uh, not this again. [angrily] Ike, we are sick of you talking about ghosts!
IKE
But, Daddy, I saw the-
GERALD
No buts! Get back to your room right now and don't come out! You got it?! [Ike turns left and walks out of view, his head hanging]
SHEILA
Gerald, what has gotten into him?
GERALD
[sighing] Hoh, I don't know. I think maybe with all the news of famous people dying this summer, he just freaked himself out.
[Ike's room, moments later. The moon fills the room with dim light and a tree outside the window casts a moving shadow onto Ike's bed. Ike sits in his bed nervously. He looks outside the window, and the tree's branches rap at his window in the high wind. Ike looks around and shuts his eyes. His mobile playset begins to turn slowly. A loud sound wakes Ike and then he gasps. A ghost makes its way towards the window from outside, passes through it slowly, then lunges at him. As soon as the ghost is at the foot of the bed, it becomes recognizable as Billy Mays, the late TV pitchman.]
BILLY MAYS
Hi, Billy Mays here for Megascrub Cleanser.
IKE
AAAAAAAAA!
BILLY MAYS
Are you tired of your kitchen counters getting those nasty stains? Don't just rub 'em, Megascrub 'em!
IKE
Billy Mays, NO! [jumps out of bed and runs into his closet. The camera pans out...]
BILLY MAYS
[...and Billy is in the closet too] Mold, mildew, even those impossible wine stains are gone in a flash when you snipe them away.
IKE
[runs out of the closet, through his room, and into the hallway.] MMOOMMMYYY! [runs towards the stairs and passes another room. Another celebrity appears in the entrance] AAAAAA! Farrah Fawcett! Farrah Fawcett! [runs to a door opposite the room and opens it. A man appears hanging from the ceiling in that room, wearing fishnet stockings] AAAAAA! David Carradine! [runs away from that room and heads for the stairs, but stops in his tracks and gasps]
BILLY MAYS
[walking up the stairs] Hi, Billy Mays here for Mighty Mend It, the fast and easy way to mend, hem, and wear it again. [Ike backs away towards his room]
IKE
NOOOOO!
KYLE
[comes out of his room] Ike! Ike, what?!
IKE
Make Billy Mays go away! Make Billy Mays go away! [Kyle looks, but nothing is there] Make him stop! [buries his face in Kyle's shoulder. Kyle consoles him] Make him stop, Kyle!
[The office of one D. Land, Ph. D., Psychiatrist, day. Inside, the psychiatrist has Ike on a couch and is trying to get him to open up.]
DR. LAND
Now, Ike, your family is very worried about you. Ike, you can talk to me. I'm a therapist. Whatever has been troubling you, it's okay.
IKE
No, it's... it's a secret.
DR. LAND
Ike, tell me your secret. I promise not to tell anyone else.
IKE
[turns his head to the right to look at the doctor] I see dead... ce-le-bri-ties.
DR. LAND
You mean, you see dead celebrities on TV? In the news?
IKE
I see them walking around. They talk to me.
DR. LAND
Are you seeing any dead celebrities right now?
IKE
Just Ed McMahon. [Ed McMahon's ghost looks at Ike over Dr. Land's right shoulder, then turns right and walks off]
DR. LAND
How often do you see dead celebrities?
IKE
All the time. [blinks a few times]
[Cartman's house, day. Cartman has the remote control and is flipping through channels.]
CARTMAN
'Sup, Jew?
KYLE
Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities.
CARTMAN
HA! What a dumbass!
KENNY
(What do you think is wrong with him?)
KYLE
I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name "Billy Mays" over and over again.
CARTMAN
Billy Mays? Billy Mays?! [hops off the sofa] Dude, you didn't tell us Ike was seeing Billy Mays!
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
Your little brother saw the ghost of Billy Mays?
STAN
Dude, I don't even know who that is.
CARTMAN
The guy on TV who had incredible things for people to buy? He died four months ago but they still show his commercials all the time? Oh, oh for the love of Christ, here! [quickly flips through the channels until a Billy Mays commercial appears] Here here! This, this is him!
[Commercial. Mays is in a laundry room.]
BILLY MAYS
Hi, Billy Mays here with another fantastic product. If you're like other Americans, you love to eat Chipotle [shows off two Chipotle burritos], but you hate all those terrible bloodstains in your underwear. [shows off bloodstained underwear]
MAN 1
[holding a burrito in his right hand] I love Chipotle. But getting all the bloodstains out of my underwear is a nightmare. [a shriek is added for emphasis]
BILLY MAYS
[now near a washer and dryer] Well now there's a product that can clean even bloodstains caused by Chipotle right off your underwear. Chipotl-away. [shows off the bottle, which says Chipotlaway. What follows is a demonstration of how the product works] Just one Chipotle burrito [shown] can leave up to a quarter cup of underwear blood [a quarter cup of red liquid is poured onto the briefs], but Chipotl-away [a couple of squirts of it makes the liquid vanish] makes your underwear clean [a towel is used to remove the liquid and product] and ready for more. [a man is shown stocking up on briefs, but they slip from his arms] Stop buying new underwear every time you eat Chipotle. That can cost you thousands. Chipotl-away gets rid of bloodstains and leaves underwear good as new. [a pair of black hands smooths some briefs out over a table, then puts the Chipotle burrito on it] Imagine having underwear so clean you can practically eat off of it.
MAN 2
[leans down towards the burrito and smiles at the camera] Mmm, Chipotle. [gives a thumbs up and begins to eat off his underwear]
BILLY MAYS
Now you can eat all the Chipotle you want [two women eat burritos on a park bench.], and still have underwear that sparkles and shines [one of the women holds up a pair of clean panties, which sparkle and shine]. Order right now!
[TV promo.]
CARTMAN
That product changed my life. It really works. I use it all the time.
KYLE
What?! Are you serious?!
CARTMAN
Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can.
KYLE
Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!
CARTMAN
Because he was a great person, Kyle.
KYLE
NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!
CARTMAN
...Dude, have you had Chipotle? It's really good. You guys, we have to help Kyle's brother and get to the bottom of this. And I think I know just who to call...
[An episode of Ghost Hunters.]
ANNOUNCER
On this episode of Ghost Hunters [a cemetery is shown]: a little boy in Colorado appears to be haunted by celebrities. [a shot of Ike floating across the screen, with various backdrops behind him] Now the Ghost Hunter team will roll out and get to the bottom of it. It's the gayest show in the fucking world; Ghost Hunters!
JASON
Alright, tell us what we got this week, Kris.
KRIS
We're going to Colorado to investigate celebrity paranorm-
JASON
Wait, what? What was that? What was that?
GRANT
I heard it too. It was like a, like a ...*pop*
JASON
Is there a ghost here?
[TAPS heads out to South Park in two SUVs.]
JASON
Alright, so you say a little boy is seeing the ghosts?
KRIS
Yeah, apparently only he is seeing them.
JASON
Doyuh ssh ssh. What, what is that? Do you hear that?! There, there look. What is that? What is that?
GRANT
I think that's just a cigarette lighter.
JASON
Oh, right, okay. May be.
[TAPS has made it to South Park. They are in the Broflovski house at night, in the dark. No lights are on except for flashlights.]
JASON
We are now inside the house where the celebrity ghosts have been spotted. Whoa whoa what? What was that? What was that?
KYLE
What was what?
JASON
Did you hear that? It was like a... it was like a... dee.. Is there a spooky ghost here?? Uh LOOK. What is that? What is that?? [a shot of the Broflovskis living room TV]
GRANT
I'm pretty sure that's their television.
JASON
Oh man I am really scared. [looks at his groin. Grant's flashlight and the camera quickly aim at it] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What is this? What is this? There's a, there's a, a wetness coming from my pants! [he peed his pants]
GRANT
I see it!
JASON
W... what is it?!
GRANT
Oh God I'm so scared! [begins to whimper] I'm so scared.
JASON
Look! Look, it's got you too! [points to Grant's groin, then says to the cameraman] Are you getting this? Make sure the camera is getting this. Definitely some paranormal activity!
GRANT
It's warm, and moist. A warm moist sensation that's moving down my left thigh. [the urine reaches the floor and starts spreading out]
JASON
Look, it's starting to form a, a a pool around the floor now. Are you getting this??
STAN
Are you guys fucking serious?
JASON
Oh God, the paranormal activity is now leaving a, a trail of some kind behind both of us! [such melodrama!]
GRANT
Hoh! Something... hot, and and, warm is coming out the back of my pants now. [Well...]
JASON
Oh it smells!
[The Broflovski house, outside. The front door opens and the four ghost hunters run out screaming.]
TAPS
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
[The Broflovski house, inside. The lights are back on. Ike hangs his head and walks off to his left, sighing. He sits down on the bottom steps of the stairs. Kyle follows him and sits next to him.]
KYLE
Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of.
BILLY MAYS
[his ghost suddenly appears with a new pitch] Hi, Billy Mays here for the Big City Slider Station.
KYLE
It's all just in your head, Ike.
BILLY MAYS
The fast and easy way to press and cook delicious sliders.
IKE
AAAAA. AAAAAAAAAAA!! [the other boys look at each other]
[Children's Hospital of Denver, night. Ike is in a recovery room while the older boys wait in the lobby on red couches.]
KYLE
I just... don't understand it.
STAN
It's gonna be alright, Kyle.
KYLE
But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?
CARTMAN
Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter.
KYLE
But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear. [to Stan] Do you understand this?
STAN
Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood.
CARTMAN
Ohh well how nice for you, Stan. It's great you've got a golden rectum of the gods, but the rest of us need Chipotlaway.
DR. CARROLL
Well boys, little Ike is stable, but the celebrity ghosts appear to have sent him into some kind of coma.
STAN
Whoa whoa wait, there really are ghosts?
DR. CARROLL
Well of course there really are ghosts. Haven't you seen that show Ghost Hunters? But I'm a pediatric doctor, so I'm going to hand this off to Dr. Phillips, who specializes in spooky things. [Dr. Phillips, a female, walks in and addresses the boys]
DR. PHILLIPS
The ghosts of these celebrities are at deep unrest. I've never sensed anything like it. [Stan and Kyle look at each other as Dr. Carroll walks away] I believe these celebrity ghosts are still roamin' the world, reachin' out through the child because they are lost in purgatory.
KYLE
Purgatory? What's that?
DR. PHILLIPS
[steps closer to the boys] Sometimes when people die, they can't quite accept what has happened to them. And so before they reach the afterlife, they go to a place called "purgatory." It is a temporary plane of existence. It's neither heaven, nor hell. Purgatory is like... being on an airplane that's waiting to take off, but you're still sitting at the gate. And even though the plane isn't taking off, they won't let you back off the plane. And you can't get up to go to the bathroom, because you're on an active runway. All these dead celebrities are sittin' on the plane waiting and wantin' to move on, but for whatever reason, they are stuck without any information, even from the pilot, how much longer it's going to be, and it's taking forever. And they aren't serving any drinks yet. It's like, a terrifying limbo.
CARTMAN
[concerned] Oh my God... poor Billy Mays...
[Ike's room. Dr. Phillips turns on the various monitors to measure Ike's vital signs... and to call out the ghosts.]
DR. PHILLIPS
I am speakin to the celebrities that are hauntin' this child. If any spirit can hear my voice, make your presence known. [the needles on an Ectograph 500 begin to move back and forth, producing some readings]
BILLY MAYS
[only his voice is heard] Hi, Billy Mays here with another fantastic product.
CARTMAN
Billy Mays! [makes his way to the front of the group] It's him!
BILLY MAYS
Are you tired of having to put your toilet seat down?
CARTMAN
Yes! Yes I am, Billy Mays!
WALTER CRONKITE
No! Be quiet, Billy Mays! Somebody is trying to contact us!
DR. PHILLIPS
To which celebrity am I addressin' now?
WALTER CRONKITE
This, is Walter Cronkite.
DR. PHILLIPS
All you celebrities need to know that you have passed on.
FARRAH FAWCETT
We know that!
DJ AM
Yeah! Of course we know that!
PATRICK SWAYZE
There's only one person here who's not cooperating!
WALTER CRONKITE
That's right! Now just admit you're dead and sit down!
MICHAEL JACKSON
...No, that's ignorant! I'm not dead.
STAN
Uh oh.
WALTER CRONKITE
You are dead!
MICHAEL JACKSON
No, I just have a skin condition.
DR. PHILLIPS
Boys, quickly! Convince Michael Jackson that he's dead.
KYLE
What?
DR. PHILLIPS
He's in denial. He's been in denial all his life. Now tell him or you're gonna lose your little brother.
KYLE
Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory.
MICHAEL JACKSON
Nooo, you're being ignorant. I'm alive. And I'm a child. And I'm white.
KYLE
Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems.
BILLY MAYS
Hi, Billy Mays here for the Super Sweeper.
THE BOYS (EXCEPT CARTMAN) AND DR. PHILLIPS
Shut up, Billy Mays!
STAN
You're dead, Mr. Jackson!
MICHAEL JACKSON
No, that's, that's just ignorant.
STAN
Accept it! [the various machines start convulsing and sparking]
MICHAEL JACKSON
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
DR. PHILLIPS
He's in too much denial! [a ball of plasma condenses in front of her and shoves her out a window on the top floor of the hospital.] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! [She flies through the air across the street and lands a half block away in the middle of another street. She dies on impact. The boys then gather around Ike and pull the wires off his face]
KYLE
Ike! Ike! Wake up buddy! Wake up! Ike, you've gotta wake up, please! [Ike's eyes slowly open] Eh there you go. That's good. [Ike looks around] Oh Ike. I thought I lost you, little brother.
IKE
[with Michael Jackson's voice] Nooo. No, that's ignorant. [the boys' jaws drop] Oh look everyone, I told you I was alive.
KYLE
Hey! What the hell are you doing inside my little brother?!
IKE
Wee, I'm a child! [jumps up] I knew I was a child. See? Come on, let's play! Let's go climb a tree! [jumps off the bed and runs out of the room]
KENNY
(Holy shit, dude!)
KYLE
Come back here! [the boys give chase]
[A park across the street from Children's Hospital of Denver, night. Ike runs to a tree in the park and tries to climb it.]
KYLE
Hey! Heeey!
IKE
Come on, let's climb the tree! Hee hee!
STAN
Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body!
IKE
Noo, I'm a little white child. Let's play! [hops off the tree trunk and starts dancing] Hee! Hee hee! [begins to moonwalk] Hee hee hee! [arrives at the swing set and hops on a swing]
KYLE
Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!
CARTMAN
Including the late and very talented Billy Mays!
IKE
No, that's ignorant. People are just ignorant and they lie and spread rumors about me. Like, that I'm dead. But if I was dead, how could I do this? [hops off the swing and dances some more] Hoo! Dawdaby daw! Shamon! [Kyle looks at his friends and leads them away out of Ike's earshot]
KYLE
What the hell are we going to do??
IKE
[still dancing] Jou know! Jou know it! Hee hee!
[The Plane of Purgatory.]
ED MCMAHON
Come on, this is ridiculous! How much longer do we have to sit in purgatory?!
PASSENGERS
Come on! Come on! This is ridiculous! Come on!
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
[into an intercom mic] Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your patience. I've been informed that we are going to be delayed at least another 96 hours.
PASSENGERS
AWWWWWWWW!
DJ AM
Yo, you can't just keep people stuck like this, man!
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
We know that you are all excited to cross over to the next plane, but for now you have to stay on this one.
WALTER CRONKITE
That's it! I have to go to the bathroom!
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Sir, you have to stay in your seat with your seatbelt fastened!
WALTER CRONKITE
You've been saying that for three months now! [sits back down]
[The four boys are now in Stan's room, and Stan is browsing around for information.]
STAN
Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts...
KENNY
(No, scroll down some more, scroll down some more.)
STAN
...setting traps for ghosts, no...
KYLE
[still trying to make sense of Cartman's ...problem] Okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me: [puts both his hands on the table and spreads his fingers out] the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed?
CARTMAN
[rolls his eyes up in thought] Was I alarmed? [closes his eyes] Yes. [opens them and looks at Kyle] I believe I was.
KYLE
So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?
CARTMAN
[correcting him] Chipotlaway, Kyle. And I'm not the one who uses it, my mom does. She does the laundry. [Kyle's jaw drops in alarm]
KYLE
Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?
CARTMAN
Yes!
KYLE
And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?
CARTMAN
Yes, Kyle, it's totally normal! [Kyle puts his hands down below the table] People do this stuff! You know, not everyone can be the boy with the golden butthole! [points to Stan]
STAN
Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.
KYLE
What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?
CARTMAN
A child... and a female. And white.
IKE
Oh lookie, it's a planet. Hee hee hee.
STAN
So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl.
KYLE
Well what the hell are we gonna do? Dress him up in a princess gown and, and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants? [Kyle looks at his friends, then down at the floor. His friends look at each other. Yes, Kyle...]
[A Holiday Inn, day, at Lynchburg. "Lynchburg Welcomes The Tiny Miss Pageant". Inside, the contestants are being introduced. The stage is small, with two bouquets of flowers with balloons attached, one at each end of the stage.]
MC
Hello. First up we have the beautiful Miss Jessica. [Jessica comes out wearing lots of makeup, a big head of hair, and a teal pageant dress. There's a smattering of applause]
JESSICA'S MOM
[clapping] Alright Jessica! Woohoo! [Jessica stops and shows off to the audience]
MC
Jessica enjoys ridin' her horse Marley and doin' her nails with her sisters. Next, contestant number 26, Miss Brandy. [who comes out in a yellow dress]
BRANDY'S MOM
Yeah Brandy! Work it girl!
MC
Brandy likes ice cream and playing with her cat Sunshine.
BRANDY'S MOM
[whispering loudly] Don't forget to blow a kiss to the judges, Brandy. [Brandy dutifully blows a kiss to the judges and grins. A balding judge grabs the kiss with his left hand, then reaches down to his groin with that hand and begins to masturbate. Brandy steps off the stage and walks away]
MC
And now welcome contestant number 27, little Miss Michael Jackson. [Ike walks on stage in a small pink dress and blond wig]
KYLE
Alright, Michael! [Kenny mumbles something]
CARTMAN
Yeah yeah rah work it Michael work it!
STAN
Yeahhhh!
MC
Michael says she just enjoys being a child. She loves to play and climb trees, and thinks people who don't are ignorant.
IKE
Ignorant.
CARTMAN
God I hope this works.
[Purgatory. The celebrities are still waiting to take off to the next plane.]
BILLY MAYS
Hi, Billy Mays here for the little Country Handy Pillow. Are you tired of sitting in limbo? Lost somewhere between planes of existence? Well now there's a product that can help you-
WALTER CRONKITE
Will somebody shut his fucking mouth?! I can't take it anymore!
PATRICK SWAYZE
This is bad enough without having to constantly listen to you try and sell your stupid crap, Mays!
BILLY MAYS
With just two easy steps, I can climb over these seats and kick you right in the fucking balls!
DAVID CARRADINE
That does it. We are not gonna just sit here anymore! We want some Goddamned answers!
WALTER CRONKITE
Why isn't anybody telling us anything?!
PILOT
Well ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking.
WALTER CRONKITE
Well it's about fucking time!
PILOT
Certainly want to uhhh thank you for all your patience. We know that you're eager to uhhhh get going and we will certainly pass on any information uhhhhh as it becomes uhhhhhh more available.
DJ AM
But yo! Yo Michael Jackson isn't even here anymore! He's gone! We should be able to move on now!
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Yes, but as we all know, Mr. Jackson had a LOT of baggage, and he checked some of that baggage in, so a crew has to go through all the baggage and get his off of purgatory before we can push back from the gate.
PASSENGERS
AWWWWWWWW!
[Tiny Miss Pageant, later.]
IKE
Did I do good in the swimsuit category? I'm worried that little doodoohead brunette girl was prettier than me.
STAN
[approaching the judges' table] Excuse me, uh, if you could do us a favor and pleeease just vote for little Miss Jackson? It's really important.
KYLIE'S MOM
It's more important for my little Kylie. Just look at this face.
KYLIE
Mommy, that hurts my cheek implants. [another contestant is dancing onstage in a cheerleading outfit. She finishes her routine on her knees. The male judge on the right is taking pictures while the one on the left is masturbating even harder. The lone female judge is just evaluating as usual]
MC
All right, thank you Miss Cassie. And now for her talent portion, Miss Michael Jackson is gonna sing for us. [Ike steps onto the stage again and sings]
IKE
I'm just a little girl. Hee hee. A dainty little thing.
And I know you all want to be a little white girl like me. Shamohn! Hee hee hee. [begins to moonwalk] Hohhh
[the male judges are masturbating furiously]
STAN
Dude, the two male judges love her.
KENNY
(Yeah.) [the doors fly open and a bunch of police officers stream in...]
AN OFFICER
All right, that's about enough! [...and haul away the male judges. The female judge looks on somewhat bewildered]
KYLE
Aww crap!
CARTMAN
Hey, what the F?!
[Tiny Miss Pageant, later.]
MC
All right everyone, the judge will now tally her final scores.
KYLE
We're totally screwed! [Brandy and her mom walk by. Brandy's actually a redhead] They took the two best judges away!
STAN
Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us. She was glaring the entire time.
HEIDI'S MOM
You'll win for sure, Heidi. You know how much that judge adores you.
KYLE
Aw dude, this is hopeless!
KENNY
(Son of a fucking bitch!)
CARTMAN
Wait wait! Wait, look at the lady judge. [a shot of the judge] She's eating Chipotle.
KYLE
[not making the connection] So what?!
CARTMAN
So maybe she doesn't know. [grabs Kyle by his coat collar] Maybe she doesn't know, Kyle! Excuse me, Ma'am, I see you're eating Chipotle.
LADY JUDGE
Oh yes, it's my favorite fast food. I would eat it every day, except I-... [looks down in embarrassment]
CARTMAN
Except! You can't afford buying all the new underwear?
LADY JUDGE
How did you know-... Look, it doesn't matter. [turns her back to him] I'm just gonna have to give it up.
CARTMAN
What if you didn't have to give it up?
LADY JUDGE
Excuse me?
CARTMAN
I think... you and I might be able to help each other here today.
[Tiny Miss Pageant, even later.]
MC
And now, it is time to announce our Grand Little Miss. Little Miss Michael Jackson. [Ike looks around gratefully as the audience applauds. The judge and the MC approach him. The judge gives him the crown and the MC gives him the trophy. The boys congratulate him]
KYLE
Yeah!
CARTMAN
Yeah!
STAN
Woohoo!
CARTMAN
Alright! [one of the contestants stomps her foot and cries, then walks off stage]
HEIDI
[passing by the audience chairs] I'm sorry I didn't win, Mommy. [her mom stops for a moment and slaps her across the face]
IKE
Thank you so much for this award. Of all the awards I've ever won, this one means the most. I feel like... I'm finally at rest. I'm finally at rest! I'm free! [Ike passes out standing up with his mouth open wide and Michael's ghost rises out of him, with a ghostly trophy. The judge and MC notice something and look up. Ike wakes up, shakes his head, and looks at himself. Then, in his regular voice] Holy shit! What the fuck am I wwwearing?
KYLE
Ike! [runs up to him. The other boys follow] Ike, you're back!
IKE
Kyle, what the fuck is going on?
KYLE
It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay.
CARTMAN
Yes. Thanks to us and Chipotlaway, the spirits of the celebrities can now rest.
[Back in purgatory, a woman yawns.]
MICHAEL JACKSON

synopsis:Butters is determined to get his first kiss so his friends won't make fun of him anymore.

script:Butters' Bottom Bitch

[South Park Elementary, day, recess.]
CARTMAN
Alright cool, guys, gather all around. Everyone should be a witness to this. [Cartman and Craig are at a tetherball pole, and Cartman is holding the ball. Around them are a bunch of boys, most of them from the fourth grade] Alright, you ready? Now say "I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me." Come on, dude, "I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me." [the camera pulls back a bit, and Butters is seen at the top of the tetherball pole, hanging from his briefs.]
BUTTERS
I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me. [Cartman hits the ball and it wraps around the pole, finally hitting Butters on his right temple] Ow.
CARTMAN
Alright, your turn Craig.
BUTTERS
Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb! [Craig grabs the ball]
CARTMAN
Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine.
BUTTERS
Uyeah, I guess I deserve it.
STAN
Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!
CARTMAN
Aw dude, you guys are not gonna believe this. You know what we just found out? Well it turns out that Butters, our Butters, has never kissed a girl. [Craig hits the ball and it wraps around the pole until it hits Butters on the face]
BUTTERS
Uugh!
KYLE
So what?
BUTTERS
So what?! [the ball returns and Craig catches it] So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!
CRAIG
That's right. [steps back and hits the ball again. The ball wraps around the pole and hits Butters on the face again. Cartman laughs]
CLYDE
You guys, we got it! [walks up with Tolkien] We got it. Sally Darson is selling kisses for five dollars.
BUTTERS
Sellin' kisses?
CLYDE
She hangs out behind the temp building during afternoon recess. She'll kiss any boy that pays her.
BUTTERS
You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today?
[The boys' bathroom, moments later. Butters is now putting on a tie.]
CLYDE
[giving advice] So then when she sticks her tongue out you just kind of lick it with your tongue.
BUTTERS
Oh boy, I sure am nervous.
CARTMAN
Nothin' to be nervous about, Butters. You're finally going to become a man today.
KYLE
Butters, I think you should reconsider this.
BUTTERS
Uh, how come?
KYLE
Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special.
CARTMAN
Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle?
BUTTERS
I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!
[Back in the playground, moments later. Butters is walking to the temp building with a crowd of boys following him at a short distance.]
BUTTERS
Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?
FRANCIS
Pretty worth it. [walks away with a dreamy look in his eyes]
JIMMY
Go ahead, Bu-Butters. Go- go get some.
BUTTERS
I'm going! [walks towards the back of the temp building] Ohh... [finds Sally and talks to her nervously] Oh, hi.
SALLY
Hey. [punches something into her cell phone and puts it away in her back pocket]
BUTTERS
So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss.
SALLY
Okay, cool.
BUTTERS
Yeah, cool, uhhhm... umuh... okay. [puckers up and steps closer to Sally]
SALLY
So you got money?
BUTTERS
Oh, money... Rrright. [reaches into his pocket and pulls out a five dollar bill, then hands it to her] There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you. [smiles, but that turns into surprise when she whips out her wad of bills and adds the five dollar bill to it. She puts the wad back away]
SALLY
All right, you ready? [she turns to face him and puckers up. He looks at her and leans in, closing his eyes. She does not close hers. They kiss on the lips. They then separate and Butters isn't sure what to make of it]
BUTTERS
Thank you! [turns right and walks back to the playground. As he approaches the boys, he raises his arms up and smiles]
CARTMAN
Atta boy Butters!
TWEEK
You did it!
JIMMY
You're a man now! All right Butters good job!
KEVIN
Good job, Butters!
[Butters' room, night. He lies there awake, his hands behind his neck, pretty happy about the school day.]
BUTTERS
[thinking to himself] Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now. [frowns, thinking of what being a man entails] Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money. [aloud, smiling] Hey, I know.
[Lunchtime at the school cafeteria. The kids are eating lunches, and Butters comes into view, stopping at a table of boys.]
BUTTERS
Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!
SCOTT
[with a lisp] She'll kiss anybody?
BUTTERS
Sure, Scott! Even if you got diabetes!
[Behind the temp building, moments later. Butters waits as Scott gives Sally his five dollars and kisses her.]
SCOTT
Wow. [turns and walks away] It's almost like having someone care about you. [walks back towards the playground]
SALLY
Jeez Butters, thanks for bringing me yet another customer. Here's your two dollar cut again.
BUTTERS
[taking his cut] Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money.
SALLY
Oh, that'd be great, but I can't do kisses before school. I have swimming class.
BUTTERS
Aww nuts! [walks off a bit] Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?
SALLY
What?
BUTTERS
Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together.
SALLY
[walks up to him] Wow, you're right Butters. I should start expanding.
BUTTERS
We could have our very own... [puts out his hands and frames an imaginary plaque] kissin' company.
[Butters' bedroom, day. He's got three easels up with info and four girls seated before him. He's using a pointer to highlight the info on the easels. He's laying out his business plan to the girls, who all have notebooks and pencils.]
BUTTERS
The next key to a successful business is "innovation." I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?
SALLY
Wow, that's a great idea, Butters.
BUTTERS
Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice.
MEGAN
[a third grader, taking notes] Got it.
BUTTERS
I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets [puts up a smiling sun sticker on Sally's row on the work schedule] a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud.
SALLY
This is gonna be great!
[Park County Police Station, day. Seems Detective Yates is now police captain there. Detective Murphy enters the work room with a report.]
MURPHY
Sir! Sir, take a look at this. We've got rumors coming in of a possible "prostitution company" starting up in South Park.
YATES
What?! [grabs the report and leafs through it] Hohoo, not in my county!
MURPHY
We've got no information on the prostitutes, don't know who they are or where they came from.
YATES
[walks off a bit] So then we need to go after the johns. We need to let the men of this town know that if they paid for sex they're going to jail!
MURPHY
Sting operation, sir?
YATES
[turns to face his men] We need an undercover cop disguised as a prostitute, so we can arrest any citizens looking for cheap thrills!
[A seedy side of town, night. Chief Yates is dressed as a hooker and is waiting curbside for a john. A car slowly rolls up, then stops. Yates approaches the car.]
YATES
Hey baby, you looking for a party?
DRIVER
Ha... how much are you charging?
YATES
Twenty for oral, fifty for half and half, anal will cost you extra.
DRIVER
Aww- get in. [Yates gets in and the car takes off]
[An alley, night. The car rolls into it.]
YATES
Right here's good, sexy. [the driver stops the car] Now if you wouldn't mind handing over the twenty dollars for oral sex.
DRIVER
Ok-okay. [grabs his wallet, pulls out a twenty, and hands it to Yates]
YATES
All right, buddy!... Go ahead and unbutton your pants. [the driver unzips his pants] All right! Here we go. [leans down unto the driver's genitals and starting giving him head]
DRIVER
Aw... Aw yeah. Oh man oh... Ohh! Aw-aw-AWWW-aw. AW-aw. Oh, s-sorry I was so quick.
YATES
Oh that's all right. [leans down to get something] Nothing wrong with a-FREEZE! [whips out his gun and badge, aiming the gun at the driver] You're busted, buddy! I'm a cop!
DRIVER
Awhuh! What?!
YATES
This is a sting operation, scumbag, and you're going to jail for soliciting prostitution. [grabs his walkie-talkie and talks into it] Got our first one, boys. I'm bringing him in for booking.
[South Park Elementary, day, the hallway. Kids are moving from place to place. Kenny, Cartman and Stan walk by and Kyle stops them.]
KYLE
Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.
STAN
Yeah, I heard that now even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses.
KENNY
(Stacey Anderson?) [mumbles something more, pulls out his five dollar bill and walks away. Butters walks up to them from the other direction]
BUTTERS
Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon? We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.
STAN
Butters, you're the one doing all this?
BUTTERS
Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this. [pulls out his stack of bills and shows it off]
CARTMAN
Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks?
BUTTERS
I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.
KYLE
You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp! [slams his locker door shut and walks off with the other three boys]
BUTTERS
...A pimp. Huh...
[At the newly-christened Butters Kissing Co, Ltd. in his bedroom. Butters and Sally are at his desk. Butters is researching what it is to be a pimp.]
BUTTERS
Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. "The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.'" Oh, you're a bitch, Sally. [smiles]
SALLY
Oh. [smiles]
BUTTERS
Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company.
[The Players Ball, night. Pimps and bitches of all shapes and sizes arrive and enter. Inside, they mingle, drink, dance, and Butters walks into view in a shirt and tie, and a name badge. He's sipping something. He spots a grown pimp and two of his bitches.]
BUTTERS
[addressing the pimp] Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp.
BISHOP
You? You be pimpin'?
BUTTERS
Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job.
[The Players Ball, A table of pimp trophies to be handed out is shown, then the camera moves up.]
BISHOP
Now see, you think you're a pimp, but you can't be pimpin', know what I'm sayin'? You wanna be a pimp, then you gotta learn the game. See it's all about knowin' the game.
BUTTERS
What's the game?
BISHOP
The game is how you treat the bitches, know what I'm sayin'? Bitch gotta know when she out there, she makin' yo' muthafuckin' money, know what I'm sayin'? You got yo' main bitch, know what I'm sayin'? That be your "bottom bitch." That bitch rank higha than all the other bitches but she still a bitch, know what I'm sayin'?
BUTTERS
[taking notes] Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking.
PIMP 2
See it's all about mind control. You gotta act a punk. Any man can control a bitch's heart, but a pimp gotta control a bitch's mind, know what I'm sayin'?
BUTTERS
I know what you're saying.
PIMP 2
Pimp gotta be out there every motherfuckin' day keepin' his bitches in line. Can't let 'em go shoppin', spendin' their money on stupid shit. Bitches gotta think that's your motherfuckin money, know what I'm sayin'?
BUTTERS
[getting pleased] Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!
[Butters' home, day. Butters walks in the front door.]
STEPHEN
There you are, Butters!
BUTTERS
Hey Dad!
STEPHEN
Butters, we heard a rumor that you might have a little girlfriend? [Linda doesn't look pleased] Sally Darson?
BUTTERS
Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch. [walks past his parents and up the stairs, but stops for a moment and looks at them.] Do you know what I am saying? [they're left speechless as he continues up the stairs]
[A dark alley in South Park, night. Chief Yates is dressed again as a bitch and is in the back seat of someone else's car.]
DRIVER 2
I've got to tell you I... I don't do this kind of thing very often. You're sure you're not a cop, right?
YATES
No way! Let's just get to this, baby.
DRIVER 2
Alright.
[An unmarked police van is nearby, with some officers listening in...]
YATES
So, you are agreeing to have sex with me for one hundred dollars, correct?
DRIVER 2
Sure, I have the money right here.
MURPHY
[to the other officer] Remember, he's going to give us the code word to move in. Wait for the code word, "stretch."
[A police cruiser, nearby. Two other cops are listening in as well...]
OFFICER
Code word is "stretch," copy?
[A rear shot of the john's car, which has tinted windows.]
YATES
Oh yeah, yeah, get those pants down.
DRIVER 2
Oh, you feel good.
YATES
Oh, you're a nasty little fuck, aren't you? Yeah, let me see that hot penis of yours. Oh yeah, nice. Yeah, I'm ready when you are.
DRIVER 2
Oh yes. That's great. [the car begins to move up and down]
YATES
Yeah, you like it?
DRIVER 2
Oh, I love it!
YATES
Yeah, you're a dirty fuck!
[The police van. The officers are shocked.]
YATES
Yeah, come on! Harder! Deeper!
DRIVER 2
Oh yeah! [the van's driver looks back to see if Murphy and the other officer are as shocked as he is] Oh yeah!
YATES
Yeah, teach me a lesson, daddy!
[The police cruiser, the two other cops are shocked too...]
YATES
Teach this little whore a lesson!
DRIVER 2
Yeah! Yeah!
YATES
Yeah, that's right!
DRIVER 2
Awww, awwwww, awwwwoh! [the john's car stops moving] Awh. [the john sounds out of breath] Oh, oh man! [a shot of the john and Yates putting their clothes back on] Thank you! That was great.
YATES
Yeah, you really worked it, Daddy. You really gave my little hole quite a... [leans into him] STRETCH.
[The police van. Murphy acts on the code word.]
MURPHY
Uhhh, that, that's it. Move in! [the police van and car arrive quickly and the officers jump out]
DRIVER 2
Oh God! It's the police!
YATES
[quickly whips out his badge and gun] Freeze! [takes the john out of the car and throws him against the hood] You are under arrest for soliciting prostitution! Book him, boys! [the other officers come in and cuff the john]
DRIVER 2
Please! Please don't do this! I have a wife and kids!
YATES
A wife and kids. And you're out here trollin' the streets for prostitutes. You make me sick! Take him downtown, boys. I'm goin' back on the street.
[The school playground, day. The supervisor comes into view.]
SUPERVISOR
[blows her whistle] That's it recess is over back to class.
KIDS
[disappointed] Aaaaaaah.
BUTTERS
Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today.
ANNIE
So wait, you're keeping all the money now?
BUTTERS
I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch [places his left hand on Sally's right shoulder], and then the bottom bitch talks to me. Alright, see you after school! [walks away] Do you know what I am saying?
[Fourth Grade classroom, day. Mr. Garrison is writing math problems involving fractions on the blackboard.]
MR. GARRISON
Alright children, I want you to copy down these math problems and solve them before recess.
BUTTERS
[sees an opportunity...] Yo, Bebe. Bebe yo.
BEBE
[bothered] What?
BUTTERS
Bitch you wanna make some motherfuckin' money?
BEBE
[really bothered] What?!
BUTTERS
Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch.
BEBE
Shut up!
BUTTERS
Oh, alright then. [copies some problems down, then looks at Wendy. Softly...] Hey Wendy. Wendy! [loudly] Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money?
WENDY
Leave me alone.
BUTTERS
Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch.
STAN
Butters. Dude!
BUTTERS
What?
STAN
You can't call my girlfriend a bitch!
BUTTERS
Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all. [turns to Wendy] Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!
WENDY
Stan!
STAN
Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass!
BUTTERS
[whips out a bill] Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him.
CLYDE
Wow wee. [grabs the hundred]
CARTMAN
Dude, we've created a monster.
BUTTERS
Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work.
MR. GARRISON
Butters! Butters, do you have a problem?!
BUTTERS
All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!
[A shot at the temp buildings from the back of the main building. Butters escorts a new bitch to the area behind one of the buildings.]
BUTTERS
Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie? [she gives him a freebie] Ohwoah, [twirls around] whoopie! [walks away, leaving Annie at her new post. As he re-enters the playground, Kyle meets him]
KYLE
Butters, I really think we should talk.
BUTTERS
Sure, Kyle.
KYLE
Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong.
BUTTERS
Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there. [Kyle turns to see Stan, who's listening to Wendy over at the merry-go-round] He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges.
KYLE
Butters, what's happened to you?
BUTTERS
What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up! [storms off, but turns once more to ask] Do you know what I am saying?! [turns and continues walking towards the main building]
[ATΩ frat house, night. There's a party going on in there.]
FRAT BOY 1
[from the third floor balcony] Alpha Tau Omega, woo!
FRAT BOY 2
[walks by on the street and looks up] ATOs!
FRAT BOY 3
Alright, ATOs, our little Kevin is twenty one today! [the other frat boys cheer] And so, Kevin, we would like to welcome you to manhood. Our gift to you. [a huge three-tiered cake is wheeled in and the music changes as Chief Yates jumps out of the cake. He begins to dance around]
FRAT BOYS
Eewwww!
SINGER
Suckin' on my titties like you wanted me,
Calling me all the time like Blondie.
Check out my Chrissie behind,
It's fine all of the time.
Like sex on the beaches,
What else is in the teaches of peaches?
Huh, what?
[ATΩ frat house, later that night. Only three windows on the second floor are lit now, and an orgy is heard.]
YATES
Give it to me! Come on, you sissies, I can fit more of ya! [more moaning from the frats] Yeah, you like your little stripper whore?! You like her?! FREEZE! [silence. Only the crickets are heard. Some minutes later the police swarm the frat house] Take them all to the station, for oral and anal sex with a prostitute! Half of them didn't even use a condom! [faces the frats] Don't you stupid kids know the diseases you can catch?! Hand me that evidence bag. [an officer hands him the bag, which he opens and places under his ass. He proceeds to crap into it, but when the bag is sealed, it's all white - it's all semen.]
MURPHY
Sir, sssome of us are wwwondering if maybe y-you're not... taking this role a bit far?
YATES
What?! No way! Nothing is more important than keeping prostitution out of our community! [his cell phone rings] Oh, hold on, that's my daddy. [answers the phone] Hey Daddy.
BISHOP
[at the other end of the line] Where you at, bitch? I need my bottom bitch right now.
YATES
Ye-yes, Daddy, I'm on my way.
BISHOP
I made you my bottom bitch, now you gotta take care of yo' pimp, know what I'm sayin'?
YATES
Be right there. Sorry guys, my daddy needs me right now. [limps away painfully]
[The streets in another Colorado city, night. Two prostitutes are working a corner with cigarettes in hand. The white one has a black left eye.]
BLACK BITCH
Damn bitch! Yo' pimp beat yo' ass again?
WHITE BITCH
He's an asshole.
BLACK BITCH
You know, I heard a rumor about some new pimp up in Park County. They say he's real respectful; lots of girls switching over to him.
WHITE BITCH
A pimp that respects his hos? Sign my ass up. [takes a drag from her cigarette]
[Butters Kissing Co, Ltd. Butters' stable of bitches has expanded to include some adult prostitutes.]
BUTTERS
And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise. [looks up at her over his left shoulder]
CHARISE
Did I do good, Daddy?
BUTTERS
REALLY great work, bitch! That is another... [looks for the right cell to place the sticker on and finds it] sunshine sticker for you.
CHARISE
Thank you, Daddy. [kisses him on his head]
BUTTERS
[gets excited] Mmmwhoa boy!
[ACORN, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, day. Butters is filing some paperwork with the receptionist there. His bitches stand near the entrance waiting for him to finish.]
BUTTERS
And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under.
RECEPTIONIST
And exactly what kind of business are you running?
BUTTERS
It's a kissing company.
RECEPTIONIST
And you're making a profit?
BUTTERS
Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late. [puts his hand over the right side of his mouth and whispers so Charise doesn't hear] You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss.
RECEPTIONIST
[getting suspicious] Do you keep any record of the men getting these "kisses"?
BUTTERS
'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris.
RECEPTIONIST
Senator Morris?
BUTTERS
Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?
RECEPTIONIST
Where?
BUTTERS
In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.
RECEPTIONIST
Alright, get out of here! [throws Butters' papers back at him]
BUTTERS
Huh? Why?
RECEPTIONIST
I'm not falling for it!
BUTTERS
But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!
RECEPTIONIST
[rises in anger] We aren't giving you anything; get out! [her boss walks up next to her]
BOSS
Mrs. Davis, is there some kind of problem?
RECEPTIONIST
Eh no sir.
BUTTERS
Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler. [Mr. Daniels' jaw drops, and Mrs. Davis looks at him]
[Butters Kissing Co, Ltd., later. A couple more females have joined the company.]
BUTTERS
Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally.
SALLY
Okay.
CHARISE
Ubup. Daddy, how come this ho get to be bottom bitch?
SALLY
What?
CHARISE
I make the most money for you Daddy, that means if anyone should be bottom bitch, it's me.
SALLY
[she and Charise face off] Hey, screw off, ho.
CHARISE
Fair is fair, ho.
BUTTERS
[rushes in to keep the hos from fighting] Whoa whoa, bitches, bitches!
YATES
[voice only] Excuse me! [comes through the door] Well well well, this must be the organization I've been hearing so much about. Took me a long time to find you. You won't believe the hardships I've been through trying to track you down. My name is Yolanda. I'd like to know all about your operation here. You see I just left my pimp recently and I'm looking for a new one?
BUTTERS
Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans.
YATES
Well, I think that's about all I need to hear.
BISHOP
[voice heard outside the window] Yolanda! [his car honks repeatedly] Yolanda!
BUTTERS
What's that?
[Butters' front door, moments later. Everyone has gone downstairs to see who's calling Yolanda. Bishop is on one knee with a bouquet of flowers in his hands.]
BISHOP
[pleading] Yolanda please! You gotta come back to me! I got nothin' without you!
YATES
You've got a lot of nerve coming here, Keshawn! After the way you treated me? I need a pimp that doesn't beat me every time he gets drunk!
KESHAWN
[on his feet] Yolanda, I looove you. I need you. Not as my bottom bitch. I want... [back on one knee] I want to marry you. [opens a small box in which rests an engagement ring. Yates looks moved by this display of affection]
YATES
It's too late for that, Keshawn! I just told this pimp I was his bitch now.
BUTTERS
Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other.
KESHAWN
[crying gratefully] Thanks, pimp. You done changed the game, that's what you did. [offers the ring once more] Marry me Yolanda? We'll move to a little château in Switzerland and get away from all this.
YATES
Oh Keshawn! [runs to him and they hug and kiss for a long time]
BUTTERS
Wha? Awww.
KESHAWN
I love you so much.
YATES
Babe, I love you too.
KESHAWN
So much, baby.
YATES
Let's, uh, let's just be happy okay?
KESHAWN
Promise, babe. Promise.
BUTTERS
[moved to tears] Oh, oh. [feeling remorse] Oh jeez. [closes the front door softly]
[Butters' living room.]
BUTTERS
Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a knee. [the girls come and genuflect] Gals, I... well I'm afraid I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money!
[The Swiss château. The camera zooms in from a great distance. Bishop and Yates are enjoying their new home.]
KESHAWN
Happy anniversary baby. [slips a diamond necklace on Yates' neck] Do you like 'em?
YATES
I love 'em, darling.
KESHAWN
I wanted to get you something extra-special.
YATES
[reaches down to get something] Well hold on. I've got something for you too, my love. I just put it right over here by the... [whips out his gun and badge] FREEZE!! Ha! You're busted, buddy! I'm a cop!
End of Butters' Bottom Bitch

synopsis:After attending their first WWE match, all the boys want to be professional wrestlers.

script:W.T.F.

[A professional wrestling ring. John Cena and Edge are in the ring with two lady wrestlers. One of them wears a pink bra, the other a black one.]
JOHN CENA
Say that again, Edge! You think you're better than me?!
EDGE
Cena, your mouth has gotten you in trouble for the last time! I'm gonna shut it up for you!
SPECTATORS
Oooooooooooooooooooooo!
DARRYL
Mess him up, Edge!
OBESE WOMAN
Kick his ass! WOO!
JOHN CENA
Oh yeah?! I've got somethin' else to tell you, Edge! I slept with Vanessa last night. [everyone boos. Vanessa, the one with the pink bra, is embarrassed and tries to hide her face]
REDNECK 1
[his vest has a tag that says "Eddie" on it] Cena slept with Edge's girlfriend?
CARTMAN
Oh my God, dude, this is sooo awesome!
STAN
I'm having the best time!
EDGE
[a huge image of himself is on a massive TV screen behind him] You cheated, and took my belt from me, and now I can't hardly get work wrestling! You took muh girl AND you took my job! [all gasp]
DARRYL
He took his job!
REDNECK 2
He took his jrrr?
REDNECK 3
Took hid drrr! [Edge throws down the mic and prepares to attack Cena. Edge slaps Cena hard enough that Cena falls to the ground, then does a victory pose. The ladies begin to wrestle]
CARTMAN
Oh, sweet! [the woman in black bra pulls on the other woman's arm using her right leg as leverage, then begins pummeling her. Cena throws Edge against the ropes]
EDGE
Whoa... [flies off the ropes and into Cena's clothesline, which sends him to the floor on his back.]
BUTTERS
Yes! Yehhehehes!
CARTMAN
This is awesome!
[The Pepsi Center, night. The show has ended and the fans are pouring out of the center towards their cars. The boys come out as well: Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, Butters, Jimmy, and Tolkien.]
CARTMAN
Dude! That was so badass!
KYLE
Wrestling is awesome!
STAN
This is it you guys! We know what our calling in life is now. Tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class! [the other boys cheer this decision.]
[South Park Elementary, after school, gym. A sign on the gym door says the junior wrestling club is meeting at 4:15. The gym has new windows. The seven boys are present, all wearing protective gear and wrestling uniforms. They look down at their uniforms.]
CARTMAN
The fuck is this?!
STAN
[a couple of seconds later] Why did they have us put on long underwear.
KYLE
Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this.
BUTTERS
Ohhh. Yeah, that makes sense.
KYLE
Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?
CARTMAN
I did. I'm the Rad Russian. [affects a fake Russian accent] I come from Russian to crush your puny capitalist heads!
COACH
[arriving] Alright boys! I'm really glad to see we have some new recruits interested in the fine sport of wrassling.
KYLE
Cool!
STAN
Yeah!
BUTTERS
Let's do this!
CARTMAN
All right!
COACH
Now, the first thing we're gonna learn today are the fundamental wrassling holds. Let's get some volunteers. Uh why don't come over here young man? What's your name?
CARTMAN
The Rad Russian.
COACH
What?
CARTMAN
You capitalist swine, I'll crush you!
COACH
Okay uh, just go ahead and get on your hands and knees.
CARTMAN
Huh?
COACH
Just, down on, down on the floor. [Cartman bends over a bit, unsure of how to do this, given his girth] Hands and knees. [the coach helps him out in getting into position.]
CARTMAN
Okay...
COACH
Alright and now how about you. Your name is?
BUTTERS
Triceratops!
COACH
Uh, all right, uh cu, come on over here. I'm gonna position you in the official wrassling starting position. [drapes Butters over Cartman] Here- we- go.
CARTMAN
The fuck is this?!
COACH
Now just reach around him here. Good.
CARTMAN
Dude! Dude! DUDE! [jumps to his feet] The fuck are you doing?!
COACH
Get back on the floor! I'm teaching the starting position of wrassling!
CARTMAN
That's not wrestling, dude, that's fucking gay!
STAN
Yeah, what are you? A child molester?
KYLE
Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?!
COACH
Oh, not this again! Let me guess: you just went to that stupid WWE show in Denver last night!
THE BOYS
Yeah! [all smiles]
COACH
Ugh. [the boys frown at this] The WWE is not wrassling! That's a bunch of fake bullcrap! How stupid are you! Real wrassling, boys, is this! [spreads his arms out to indicate the floor and their uniforms - practice, practice, practice]
CARTMAN
Well this is fucking lame dude! Let's get the hell out of here, guys. [they all take off their headgear and walk away]
STAN
Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked.
BUTTERS
I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir! [throws his headgear on the floor and walks away glaring back at the coach]
COACH
Rrrgh!
[Cartman's house, day. He holds up a program written in crayon.]
CARTMAN
The Wrestling Takedown Federation has several matches planned today. Alright, sooo, here's how we'll do this, guys. I'll come out to the ring first and then Jimmy, you come in and tell me you're gonna kick my ass. Then I'm gonna say "You slept with my girlfriend," and I'll charge you into a head slap.
JIMMY
Sounds good.
CARTMAN
Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like "No no, the fight hasn't started yet," and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair.
BUTTERS
Okey doke.
JIMMY
So is that when I t- tell you that your girlfriend is a whore?
CARTMAN
Noo, let's save the "girlfriend is a whore" line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again.
BUTTERS
Hmboy, wrestling sure is fun!
CARTMAN
Alright are you ready to try this, guys?
STAN
Yup.
CARTMAN
Alright, let's start wrestlin'. [the boys take their starting positions]
JIMMY
I am gonna k-kick your ass!
CARTMAN
You slept with my girlfriend, Hammerclaw! [Cartman slaps him hard, and Jimmy falls. Butters intervenes.]
BUTTERS
Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad.
CARTMAN
Hey! He slept with my girlfriend, referee! In my country we don't wait for a bell, miste-[Jimmy sneaks up behind him with a folding chair and smashes it into the back of his head, making him fall forward] ah!
JIMMY
Your girlfriend is a whore!
CARTMAN
[whispers aloud] Wait for it, wait for the whore line.
JIMMY
[softly] Oh, I'm sorry.
TOLKIEN
You're gonna get it now, Hammerclaw!
STAN
We'll see about that!
BUTTERS
Now hold on! I am stopping the fight! [Stan headbutts him] Eoh!
[A park behind the Cartman house. The wall separating the backyard from the field is gone.]
REDNECK 4
What's goin' on?
REDNECK 5
Apparently that crippled kid slept with that Russian kid's girlfriend.
REDNECK 4
Jeez they're so young.
[First match.]
KYLE
I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!
BUTTERS
That's because your mother betrayed my mother, Juggernaut!
[Second match.]
STAN
You don't come to this country and make fun of it!
CARTMAN
And just what do you care about your pitiful country?!
STAN
I served my country! I fought for two years in Vietnam.
[From the seats in the backyard.]
REDNECK 6
That kid was in 'Nam? Man, that's incredible!
REDNECK 7
Good for you for serving your country!
[Out on the street, a redneck runs to tell the rednecks haning out on a truck.]
REDNECK 8
Guys, check this out! There's this little kid from the Congo, who was raised by panthers!
REDNECK 9
Are you serious?
[Third match.]
KYLE
Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene!
TOLKIEN
I admit nothing! Maybe Irene lied to you!
[From the seats in the backyard. There are more chairs present.]
REDNECK 10
That kid in the hat is havin' sex with two different girls?
REDNECK 11
Naw, that little kid from the Congo lied about one of them to try and get the kid in the hat in trouble with his wife.
REDNECK 12
They're married?
[Fourth match intro.]
JIMMY
You have to forfeit the fight, Rad Russian! You cannot fight until your test results come ba-back!
CARTMAN
I might have to wait for my hepatitis test, but in the mean time, I have brought my comrade from Mexico to wrestle against you!
[From the seats in the backyard.]
REDNECK 9
That Russian kid's got hepatitis?
[Fourth match.]
ANNOUNCER
And here he comes now, the cold-blooded wrestler from Mexico, El Pollo Loco! [Kenny, dressed as a masked luchador, comes out to mariachi fanfare and sparklers. The spectators clap and cheer him on]
JIMMY
What are you doing here, El, El Pollo Loco?
KENNY
(I came here to kick your ass once and for all!)
[Nighttime. The wrestling matches are coming one after the other, connected by convoluted plot lines and story arcs.]
KYLE
Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me!
STAN
You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her!
KYLE
If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here?
ANNOUNCER
Uh oh, here she comes now! It's Bad Irene! [Cartman, dressed as a diva, walks out of the dressing room and towards the ring. The crowd hoots and hollers. She climbs right in and takes the mic from Stan's hand]
CARTMAN
Let me tell you something! Let me tell you something! It's true, I love Stan the Man with all my heart, but... I want to be with Juggernaut now.
STAN
What?!
REDNECK 13
No! No! What are you doing?! Stan the Man loves you!
REDNECK 14
Don't break his heart!
STAN
If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!
CARTMAN
It's true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it. [the crowd boos and expresses its disapproval]
KYLE
Irene, no! Why?
CARTMAN
Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them.
REDNECK 15
Whoa, did you hear that?
REDNECK 16
Shh!
STAN
Irene, you said you loved me!
CARTMAN
I'm not in love with you, I'm in love with abortions. Don't you undestand?! [screams, runs up to Stan with a steel chair, and smashes him with it, knocking him down]
SPECTATORS
Ohhhh! [Kyle runs up to Cartman and knocks him down with a flying kick] Ahhhh!
[Skeeter's Bar, night. A bunch of men are gathered at the bar chatting.]
DARRYL
I'm telling you guys, you've got to see this. These kids ain't more than eight or nine years old an' they got more problems than you can imagine.
REDNECK 13
There's this one kid, he saw his father get murdered. And yesterday he finds the killer, and it's this other kid whose an ex-cop. Needless to say, he whupped his ass good.
DARRYL
Yup, and there's this little girl, she's actually addicted to gettin' abortions. Got pregnant by nearly every boy there.
REDNECK 17
You're shittin' me!
REDNECK 13
No! We're telling you these kids are fucking crazy! You gotta check it out! [the wrestling coach is sitting nearby, stewing at the conversation]
DARRYL
You can watch 'em almost every afternoon. It's some of the greatest wrestlin' we ever seen.
COACH
[rises from his seat and approaches the men at he bar] It isn't real! Don't you people understand that stuff isn't real?! None of it! How stupid are you?! [Skeeter and another bar patron look at each other]
REDNECK 13
[strokes his chin thoughtfully] What do you mean, it ain't real?
COACH
It's all made up! Fiction! Real wrassling is a serious and respectable sport! Why can't you people understand that that kind of wrestling isn't real?!
DARRYL
[walks up to the coach] Mister, there's a little girl out there who's had fourteen abortions, an' she ain't even ten yet. But I guess that's just [holds up two fingers on each hand in a quote gesture] "not real" to you! [turns and walks back to the bar, saying under his breath] Son of a bitch.
COACH
Look look look! [whips out his iPhone to show them] THIS is wrestling. THIS. [two men are shown wrestling in Greco-Roman style. There's a lot of grunting in the match. The bar patrons watch the little screen for a few seconds]
DARRYL
Mister, you'd better take your gay porn an' walk right out of this bar.
[Cartman's backyard, a new dressing room. The boys prepare for their matches. Stan looks out through the curtains.]
STAN
Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight.
KYLE
Good thing we made those changes to the seating.
CARTMAN
Alright you guys, let's bring it in. [the boys huddle and hold hands] I think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun out there, okay?
BUTTERS
Yeah!
KYLE
Let's do this! One! Two!
BOYS
Backyard wrestling!
[Cartman's backyard, moments later. The yard has been transformed into a Greek amphitheater. A façade now covers the back side of the house and a wrestling ring is in the amphitheater's pit. The place looks filled to capacity with people chattering, waiting for the matches to begin. The amphitheater lights dim and the crowd cheers as the wrestlers come out.]
CARTMAN
Oh what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the excitement of violence.
STAN
Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!
REDNECK 13
Gee, I didn't know his parents did that.
REDNECK 18
Shhh.
[South Park Elementary, principal's office, day. Principal Victoria is talking with the wrestling coach.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid we have to terminate your employment here at South Park Elementary.
COACH
You're firing me? Why?!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
The school board has decided to discontinue the wrestling program. Wrestling simply involves too much adult subject matter, like murder and abortion. [shows him the South Park Gazette, which has the headline "Kids Wrestle with Adult Issues"]
COACH
No, this isn't wrassling! THIS ISN'T WRASSLING! Principal Victoria, just let me stay on and I can teach kids what real wrassling is!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I'm sorry, the board has made up their minds.
COACH
You can't fire me for what these kids do!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
That isn't the only reason you're being let go.
COACH
What do you mean?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[sighs] We... found all the gay porn on your iPhone, Mr. Conners.
[The wrestling dressing room, day. The boys are dressing up for another round of wrestling matches. Kyle and Tolkien are talking.]
KYLE
So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.
TOLKIEN
Oh! Sure, that works.
CARTMAN
[rushing in with a letter] You guys! You guys, listen to this! It's amazing!
KYLE
What dude? [the other boys gather 'round]
CARTMAN
We just received a letter from the WWE.
STAN
From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver?
BUTTERS
No way!
CARTMAN
"Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling organization and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth."
STAN
Vince McMahon is coming to see us?
KYLE
This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers. [Stan and Kyle begin chanting "Omigod!" repeatedly]
STAN
Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!..
KYLE
Oh my God... Oh my God...
TOLKIEN
I can't believe it's him.
BUTTERS
I'm freaking out...
KYLE
[fans himself] Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!
CARTMAN
Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before.
STAN
Alright it's time to start the second act. Let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday!
[Intermission. The crowd is milling around in the front lawn, and the darkened amphitheater is visible behind the fence.]
DARRYL
Yeah, no I I think Congo is a great wrestler; I just think Rad Russian has his number.
REDNECK 19
Yeah, but Rad Russian has a lot of abandonment issues. [a chime sounds, indicating the start of the second act]
DARRYL
Uh oh, it looks like the intermission is over, better head back.
[The amphitheater. The lights come up on Kyle in the ring, who begins to speak.]
KYLE
I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do. [an elderly fan holds up a sign: "STOP RUNNING JUGGERNAUT"] And I, again, am alone. [Stan, Butters, and Tolkien climb into the ring behind him]
STAN
Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you. [Kyle turns to see the other three boys]
BUTTERS
Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?
KYLE
I'll fight anytime, anywhere!
REDNECK 20
He don't run from fights, just from responsibilities. [Tolkien swings a chair into the back of Kyle's head, and Kyle falls to the floor]
CROWD
Oohhhhh! [Tolkien begins to twist Kyle's arm] Boooooooo!
STAN
What do I do? Juggernaut is my long lost brother. [Kenny climbs into the ring as El Pollo Loco] And yet Congo saved my life in Nam. [Kenny picks up the chair and swings it into Tolkien, and Stan turns to see him]
ANNOUNCER
It's El Pollo Loco! [a section full of Mexican fans hold up a Mexican flag and two banners: "Viva El Pollo Loco" and "Me Gusta El Pollo Loco"]
[Sizzler, Thursday. The four boys are seated at a table.]
CARTMAN
Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler.
KYLE
Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.
CARTMAN
Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking.
KENNY
(Yeah, we've been talking.)
CARTMAN
And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again.
STAN
Yeah?
CARTMAN
Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Tolkien, Butters, Jimmy.
KENNY
(Yep.)
KYLE
What are you talking about?
CARTMAN
Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Tolkien? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen!
STAN
He's right.
KYLE
What?
STAN
Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token.
CARTMAN
Right?
STAN
And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers.
KYLE
Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them.
CARTMAN
No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances.
KENNY
(They're gonna hurt our chances.)
CARTMAN
Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it!
KYLE
So what do we do?
KENNY
(We've gotta bring somebody else on.)
CARTMAN
Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.
STAN
Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Tolkien, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts.
KYLE
How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?
CARTMAN
It's simple. We just gotta hold tryouts.
[Tryouts, later on. Syncopated music plays, similar to "All That Jazz." The four boys are seated at a table a few rows up in the amphitheater.]
CARTMAN
Number seventeen step forward, please? [a man steps forward shielding his eyes from the glare of the spotlights] You're wrestling a Muslim immigrant. You suspect he could be a terrorist and your parents died in the 9/11 attacks. Go!
NUMBER 17
[gets into a slight crouch] You dirty Muslim bastard! I don't trust you, and I never will! Do you know how it feels to lose your parents?! No you wouldn't, you smelly brown Middle Eastern piece of sh-
CARTMAN
Thank you! Number twenty-four? [another man steps forth as Number 17 returns to his place] You're wrestling for the right to marry Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, go!
NUMBER 24
Your father! Your own father! [slaps himself four times] I don't care if you were on drugs, you sick! Whore!
CARTMAN
Thank you. [Number 24 returns to his place]
KYLE
That guy's a pretty good wrestler.
KENNY
(Mhm.)
STAN
Yeah yeah, not bad.
CARTMAN
Let's see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again. [Number 37 steps forward] We just wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about yourself?
NUMBER 37
Not a whole lot to tell, really. Was born in Fort Collins, started watching wrestling when I was four years old. My father... he liked it too. Until he died. [stirring music begins to play] Sometimes I think it's 'cause of him I followed this dream. [breaks into song]
All my life, all I ever wanted was to
Beeeee a wrestler
Fiiiiighting in the ring
Winning that belt.
And so I dreamed every night that I was the
Uuuuundertaaker
Smaaaaashing skulls in
Breaking arms.
But I'm so worked up. This is something I can do.
Do I have what it takes inside?
STAN
Damn dude, that is some badass wrestling.
CARTMAN
Yeah, this guy crushes.
[The coach's trophy room. A whole bunch of wrestling trophies and awards are shown as the camera pans to the right. The coach is seated in his armchair.]
MR. CONNERS
It isn't fair. All my hard work. [he's reading Saturday's Gazette, which has Vince McMahon's picture and name under the headline "Wrestling Smackdown Brings WWE President"] I'm not going to take it anymore. [he throws the paper to the floor, gets up from the chair, and walks over to a mirror.] That wrestling show is in for a big surprise. [grabs his headgear and puts it on] I'm putting an end to this once and for all! [gets into a wrestling stance] Hyaaaaa!
[Cartman's house, Saturday night. A banner under the second-floor windows reads "ULTIMATE SMACKDOWN TONIGHT!!!" People from all over South Park gather on the front lawn. A white limo with the WWE logo emblazened on it comes to a stop in front of the house.]
KYLE
[standing on a stool by the front window] He's here! Vince McMahon is here! [the other boys arrive. An assistant opens the back door and Vince steps out and surveys the front yard.]
JIMMY
Oowow, it's really him.
STAN
He's here, Ohh my God [Kyle hops off the stool and joins Stan in the chant] Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-
CARTMAN
[preparing to dress as Irene] Alright, places everyone.
[The backyard amphitheater. The lights go out and two spotlights light up the ring.]
CARTMAN
[over the speakers] Welcome to this performance of Wrestling Takedown Federation: Smackdown. [An opera box has been built to accommodate McMahon. It has four seats, and an usher takes McMahon and assistant to their seats. Vince has his own personal Playbill with "WTF" on the cover]
STAN
Juggernaut? Juggernaut, hey, what's goin' on?
KYLE
You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.
STAN
Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?
KYLE
Wait a minute. Who is that?
STAN
It's Triceratops, and he's with Irene. [Coach Connors sneaks up to the side of Cartman's house with a briefcase and puts his back up against the wall]
KYLE
You aren't welcome here, Triceratops!
CARTMAN
My man can do whatever he wants.
MR. CONNERS
Stay calm, you know what you have to do.
CARTMAN
You're just gonna have to deal with that.
MR. CONNERS
For the good of real wrassling. [quickly moves away and out of sight]
BUTTERS
No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!
CARTMAN
My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic.
STAN
No, you can't possibly mean that-!
CARTMAN
Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now!
CROWD
Awwwww!
KYLE
There's someone here to wrestle you, Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he's here now!
NUMBER 37
[leaps into view in yellow tights and red boots] Mother! Why did you abort me? Why?
REDNECK 21
He's alive!
CARTMAN
You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong!
[The opera box.]
ASSISTANT
What do you think?
STAN
Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you do something informal like that.
VINCE
They are decent wrestlers. We'll see how they develop their through lines in the second act. [whips out some opera glasses and puts them on]
[Under the bleachers. Coach Connors is sneaking around, occasionally going into a wrestling stance.]
JIMMY
Aha! I thought I would find you here, Triceratops!
BUTTERS
Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!
GUARD
[catching up to the coach] Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm afraid this area is off limits.
BUTTERS
[after Jimmy says something] Are you sure?
MR. CONNERS
Oh don't mind me. [puts down his briefcase] I was just about to- [quickly gets the guard to the ground and takes up the starting position of wrassling.]
GUARD
[seems to be enjoying all the moves and grunts the coach is making] Heh whoa-ho! Heh hey! Whoawhoawhoa. Whoahoho. Eheheh. The fuck is this?
[The backyard amphitheater. The next segment begins with the Rad Russian holding court while the other wrestlers sway to the music behind him.]
CARTMAN
O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky!
[An upper floor under the bleachers. The coach climbs up a ladder to this floor and sets his briefcase down. He opens the case and assembles the rocket-propeled grenade launcher inside it.]
STAN
When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one!
BUTTERS
He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!
JIMMY
Lies! These are all a bunch of lies! [back to the ring. Kenny has a bloody baby doll under his left arm. A fake umbilical cord is attached to it] Now you listen here, El, Pollo Loco! It doesn't matter if your wife was killed, you cannot keep Irene's aborted baby!
KENNY
(I can keep the baby...)
[The railing at the very top of the amphitheater, behind the topmost seats. The coach climbs up and over it with his RPGL.]
CARTMAN
Just let them crawl back to Mexico Sergeant Hammerclaw. [The coach picks up the RPGL, puts it on his shoulder, and takes aim] We can't... might as well go back to your land of burritos, tacos, and take this aborted baby where it will fit in right with all the other aborted babies in Mexico!
MR. CONNERS
[while Cartman speaks] Only one shot. [moves his aim from the ring to the opera box] Maximum damage. [zooms in on McMahon] This is all your fault, you WWE president asshole! Your fault we all die here. Right. Now. FOR WRASSLING! [fires the launcher and the rocket takes off. It goes towards the façade, but stops and drops harmlessly into the ring] NO! [Kenny picks it up. It comes back to life and takes off with him holding on. They go all over the place, but finally take off into the sky, where the grenade blows up and releases fireworks. Below, Mexican fans of El Pollo Loco hold up banners: "Viva El Pollo Loco" "Me Gusta El Pollo Loco"]
FAN 1
O dios mio, mataron al Pollo Loco!
FAN 2
Bastardos! [Kenny's theme music comes up as the fireworks continue coming down. Vince and his assistant stand up and applaud the performance]
MR. CONNERS
[coming down the bleachers towards the ring] No! No, shut up! [steps into the ring] You idiots want wrassling?! This is wrassling! [performs some wrestling stances and grunts, but gets booed]
REDNECK 22
We want some real wrestlers!
MR. CONNERS
This is just a bunch of garbage! And you are all ruining the good name of wrassling! [the boos continue] Wrassling is from ancient Greece! It's in the Olympics!
DARRYL
What the hell do you care?! Get off the wrestlin' mat! Boo!
MR. CONNERS
Why do I care? These kids made it so real wrassling is gone from schools! It's practically gone from the culture. Damn it they took my job!
CROWD
[suddenly confused] Huh? What?
REDNECK 5
They took his job.
REDNECK 23
I know. Sshh. [the crowd falls silent, waiting for his next words]
MR. CONNERS
You want to know pain? Pain is dedicating your entire life to a sport, to a career, and then having it all ripped away from you like a babe from its mother.
DARRYL
Oh man, they took his job?
REDNECK 13
They took hid-drr.
MR. CONNERS
Lost everything! Couldn't even afford to pay for my... little retriever Rex anymore! Animal Control came and got him!
REDNECK 24
They took his dog!
REDNECK 25
They tok hid-drr!
REDNECK 5
Took hid-drrr!
MR. CONNERS
I ended up on the streets, stealing! Got busted by the police and had to spend the night in jail! The other inmates, they all beat me up and fractured my jaw to where I couldn't eat!
REDNECK 26
They broke his jaw!
REDNECK 22
Theeyy broke his jaw!
REDNECK 27
Brk hij-jrr! [a rooster in a cage crows]
MR. CONNERS
So you see I have nothing left. Nothing! Not even the will to live. [He closes his eyes. The crowd takes it in, applauds, then gives him a standing ovation. He opens his eyes, surprised at the reaction. Flowers begin falling at his feet, and Vince McMahon steps into the ring to approach him]
VINCE
Sir, that was one of the finest wrestling performances I have ever seen.
MR. CONNERS
What?
VINCE
Will you not join our wrestling organization? I promise to make you our leading act.
MR. CONNERS
You, you mean it?
VINCE
Come! I want to get you in rehearsals right away! [leaves the ring with the coach]
KYLE
What?
STAN
Dude.
CARTMAN
Hey, what about us? Our show? [the coach is now grinning as the two men walk away]
VINCE
Sorry boys. You are decent wrestlers, but lack the raw wrestling talent this man has.
THE BOYS
Aaaaah.
CARTMAN
This is all your fault, Kyle! You screwed up the second act!
KYLE
Me?! It was your stupid-ass writing!
JIMMY
Face it: Stan's crappy singing is what sssunk us!
STAN
What?? [three fights break out in the ring: Cartman vs. Kyle, Jimmy vs. Stan, and Tolkien vs. Butters] Fuck you, Jimmy!
JIMMY
You can s-, you can suck, suck my balls!
STAN
Don't go pointing fingers at me, Cartman! You have no idea what you're talking about, and it wasn't... [the fighting continues. The crowd gets bored of this unscripted fight]
REDNECK 28
What the hell's this?
REDNECK 29
This is Goddamned fake!
DARRYL
Screw this, this is just stupid. [leaves his seat. Other spectators leave their seats as the boys continue to fight in the ring]
CARTMAN
Oh, don't start with me, Kenny!
REDNECK 30
FAKE!
CARTMAN
Kenny! I'm-
End of W.T.F.

synopsis:Stan takes action to stop the Japanese from killing the world's whales and dolphins.

script:Whale Whores

[Denver Aquarium, day. A group of people are wading around in a dolphin pool. Among them are the Marshes.]
CHET
All right, everyone, welcome to the Dolphin Encounter here at the Denver Aquarium. [a woman behind him waves at everyone. Randy takes a picture of the trainers] My name is Chet and I'll be your guide and trainer as you meet these intelligent and truly magical creatures. [several dolphins swim in from another part of the pool] And here they come: this is Trigger and Dolly, uh there's Bubbles.
STAN
[happily] Wow cool.
RANDY
Pretty neat birthday, huh Stan?
STAN
Yeah, this is gonna be awesome.
CHET
If they come near you you can touch their back just no grabbing please. What whimsical creatures aren't they? All the dolphins you will be encountering today are Atlantic bottlenose dolphins. Now who would like to get a kiss from one?
GIRL
I would like to-
RANDY
[barging in] MEMEME. I wanna kiss it! I wanna kiss it!
CHET
Uh all right, let's just uh, get you to put your hands, palms down, on the water. [a dolphin swims by] The- [a rumble is heard, and then gets louder]
STAN
What the hell is that? [the trainer turns around. A group of Japanese men in kimonos run towards the pool with harpoons in hand.]
TRAINER 2
Oh no it's the Japanese! [The group jumps in and proceeds to stab every dolphin in there repeatedly until the dolphins bleed to death, then jumps out of the pool and runs back towards the way it came from.]
JAPANESE MAN 1
(In Japanese Accent) Fuck youuu dofiiin!
JAPANESE MAN 2
(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you dofiiin! [they leave behind a pool of dead dolphins and bewildered guests. The girl begins to cry.]
[Another location. The guide here is in front of a huge tank with a thick glass wall through which sea life can be seen.]
GUIDE
These are our favorite animals here at the Atlanta Zoo. It's Dolly and Seymour. They are beluga whales. These whales live mostly in the Arctic region- [the Japanese men strike again, making everyone else run out of the area, breaking the wall with their harpoons.]
JAPANESE MAN 3
(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you, whaaales!
[The Baltimore Aquarium. Some dolphins are performing tricks when the Japanese men strike a third time.]
TRAINER 3
All right Jessica, now put your arms out like this. [little Jessica lifts her arms out and open] Great job, Jessica!
JAPANESE MAN 4
Fuck you, whaaale! [jumps onto the platform and harpoons the whale, then runs off without taking the harpoon]
JESSICA
AAAAAAAA!
[Stan's house, night, Stan's bedroom. He's moping on his bed. Randy peeks in to see how Stan is doing, then walks in and goes to Stan's bed.]
RANDY
[sigh] Hey pal. [sits by him] Sorry your birthday got a little ruined by the Japanese.
STAN
Dad, why did they do that?
RANDY
Well Stan, the Japanese just... don't really like dolphins very much. Certainly not as much as us normal people do. But hey, at least you still got your T-shirt! [Stan moves his arms out of the way and looks at the shirt - a white "I swam with the dolphins" T-shirt with blood splattered on it.] And you always have your neat picture. [hands Stan the framed picture on the nightstand, which Stan opens and looks at. It's of Stan and a dead dolphin, with the caption "My New Friend!" underneath]
[The Miami Dolphins home field, Land Shark Stadium, day.]
COMMENTATOR 1
Dan Dierdorf here, welcoming you to this great football matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Miami Dolphins. We're all set for kickoff and- [the Japanese men strike again]
COMMENTATOR 2
Oh Dan it looks like Japanese people are now rushing onto the field. [the Japanese men stab and kill all the Dolphin players] This is not the kind of thing you want happening during kickoff. [the Japanese men run off]
JAPANESE MAN 5
(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you, dofiiin!
[Channel 9 News.]
NEWS ANCHOR
Several whales and dolphins were again slaughtered by the Japanese today, this time at the Six Flags Discovery Kingdom near San Francisco. [a shot of the Japanese killing the dolphins there] Aquariums had been experimenting with methods to keep the Japanese out, but so far nothing seems to stop them. When asked if all of Japan supported the slaughtering of whales and dolphins, the current Prime Minister of Japan, Yukio Hatoyama, had this to say:
HATOYAMA
[clears his throat] (In Japanese Accent) Fuck you weiru [gives the finger with his right hand], anda fuck you dohfiiin! [gives the finger with his left hand]
[Cartman's house, day. Cartman is singing Lady Gaga's "Poker Face". He's at the chorus while Kenny is on a Rock Band drum set. Kyle is on a Rock Band guitar.]
CARTMAN
Can't read my, can't read my,
No he can't read my poker face.
She's got to love nobody.
Can't read my, can't read my,
No he can't read my poker face.
She's got to love nobody.
Papapa poker face papa poker face.
Mumumumuh.
Papapa poker face papa poker face.
Mumumumuh.
STAN
[as Cartman finishes the chorus] Guys... guys... [Cartman turns off the mic] Look, I really think it's time for us to do something. This is all getting way out of hand.
CARTMAN
What do you mean? This song is sweet.
STAN
No, not the song. I'm talking about the Japanese killing whales and dolphins.
KYLE
Dude, they've been doing that for a long time.
STAN
So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something.
KYLE
What are we gonna do, Stan? It's, it's not like we can change the way an entire country thinks. I don't like it, but it's just the way they are.
STAN
It seems like everyone has an attitude of "that's just the way they are" or "that's just the way it is"! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!
CARTMAN
I'm not too busy, Stan.
STAN
You're not?
CARTMAN
No, I just don't care. At all.
KENNY
(Yeah, me neither.)
STAN
Kenny? You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?
CARTMAN
[speaking into the mic] Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whaaales!
STAN
You know, when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone, people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit! [turns and walks out the front door. The boys don't move for a few seconds, then Cartman launches back into "Poker Face".]
CARTMAN
I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be.
I don't give a crap 'bout whales so go and hug a tree.
[Stan's room, sometime later. He's at his desk, pissed off that Cartman and the others don't seem moved by the slaughter. Butters peeks in, then approaches Stan.]
BUTTERS
Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales.
STAN
[lights up] Yeah. Butters, do you wanna help?
BUTTERS
Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are.
STAN
[turns to look at Butters] Really? [gets off his chair] People who are doing something?
BUTTERS
I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers.
STAN
[determined] Then that's where I belong.
[OP for Whale Wars, a montage of scenes from that show.]
SINGER
The world is a vampire, sent to drain.
CAPTAIN PAUL WATSON
Yeah, we're badass.
SINGER
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.
MALE CREW 1
Any means necessary! We're not protesters, we're pirates! ["Whale Wars" shows up onscreen]
[Whale Wars. The Sea Shepherd is shown floating in the middle of the ocean. In the bridge the Shepherd's crew is gathered.]
CAPTAIN
That's definitely a Japanese boat. [looks through his binoculars] Looks like they're whaling now. [sure enough, the Japanese, on the Herro Maru No. 3, are throwing harpoons at the whales. Random cries of "Gojira" come forth]
JAPANESE SAILOR
Fuck youuu, weiruu!
FIRST MATE
Oh my God, they're gonna kill those humpbacks!
WOMAN
We've gotta do something!
CAPTAIN
Pull up next to them. The fight is on!
STAN
Sweet! [the Sea Shepherd pulls up alongside the Herro Maru. The whalers gather at the railings and razz the Sea Shepherd]
CAPTAIN
[taking his crew out to the deck] Are we ready to do this?
CREW
Yeah!
STAN
Yeah. Hell yeah! Let's do it!
CAPTAIN
Are we badasses?
CREW, STAN
Yeah!
CAPTAIN
Are we badasses?
CREW, STAN
Yeah!
CAPTAIN
All right, so... what do we do? [the Japanese continue razzing them] Wait, I know. How about we go on their ship, and then beat ourselves up? And then we can tell the media they did it?
CREWMAN
[masked] Great idea, Captain!
AUSSIE CREWMAN
I'll start right now. [begins punching himself on the cheek]
WOMAN
"Oh my God, Luke's been hurt trying to save whales."
CAPTAIN
Wait, wait wait. I've got a better idea. How about I pretend to be shot? Then we can tell the media the Japanese shot me, a-and start an international c-crisis?
STAN
Whoa, wait wait, we don't wanna just lie about stuff.
CAPTAIN
Why not?
STAN
Well, 'cause then we're just douchebags, dude. Come on, they're right here. Let, let's get hardcore!
CAPTAIN
You know what? He's right. It's time to bring out the big guns! You guys ready? [the crewmen hold up sticks of something...] Ready? And... throw the stinky butter at them! [they throw the sticks at the Herro Maru and hit it, leaving blotches in various places. One explodes next to two sailors, who just look at the mess it leaves]
LUKE
Haha, you stink now! Haha!
STAN
Wait, that's it?
CAPTAIN
Yeah, we make 'em stink. Haha your boat is stinky! Here, th- here, throw one.
STAN
Those guys are always covered in dolphin and whale guts. They don't care if they stink. Come on, let's break their boat.
CAPTAIN
Well no, that'd be illegal.
CREWMAN 2
Yeah.
STAN
[can't believe how toothless their threats are] I thought you guys were pirates in a war!
WOMAN
I'm a pirate in a war.
STAN
Pirates don't worry about the law! You guys said you were badasses!
CAPTAIN
We are. People think our methods are extreme. But we'll keep making their boats stink as long as they're killing whales and dolphins!
LUKE
The Japanese are scared of how hardcore we are. [a Japanese gunner prepares a large harpoon in a cannon and fires it off. It strikes the Shepherd's captain's head, goes through it, and pins him on the wall, killing him instantly. Blood comes out everywhere]
WOMAN
Paul! [the Japanese sailors cheer this small victory]
CREWMAN
Paul?
CREWMAN 2
What do we do?
WOMAN
We don't have a captain!
CREWMAN
Oh my God, oh my God!
WOMAN 2
[masked] Maybe he's okay.
[Stan turns and goes towards a utility box. He opens it, rifles through it and finds a flare gun. He takes it, goes to the railing, and fires a flare at the Herro Maru. It finds the fuel storage area, lights up, and soon the barrels and boxes in that area begin to burn and explode. The Japanese try to put out the fire, but it's no use.]
CREWMAN 2
Oh my God.
LUKE
What did you do?
STAN
What you assholes acted like you were doing? [cries of "ikaban" come from the Herro Maru as it slowly sinks in the ocean and Japanese sailors jump off the ship]
[Montage as Cartman sings "Poker Face". An Entertainment Weekly cover with Captain Stan on it and the lead story "'Whale Wars' Gets Better. Things Actually Happen Now." The crewmen are now throwing Molotov cocktails at the ships, and the Japanese run for cover. Next, Stan steers the Sea Shepherd. Next, Stan is shown with a large new cannon, having just fired a grenade at a whaling ship with it. The crew dances with joy. Next, a Variety cover with the new captain and the headline, "Whale Wars Ratings Skyrocket. New Captain Not A Fat Liar Like The Old One." Next, Stan leads the crew as they act as a volunteer security force at aquariums across the country. Next, a People cover with Captain Stan and his crew, and the cover story, "WHALE WARS New Cast Member Turns Vegan Pussies Into Actual Pirates. 19-page exclusive article." Finally, Stan and crew, having removed their volunteer identification sashes, stand before a covered statue at Sea World. The Japanese head their way to get into the park.]
STAN
Wait for it... wait for it... NOW! [the crew pulls at the ropes, and the covers comes off the statue - it's Godzilla.]
THE JAPANESE
Ohhhh Gojira! Gojira! [they turn and run away]
[Someone is reading a newspaper, the World News, on which is the headline "LITTLE BOY SINKS ANOTHER JAPANESE BOAT!" and a picture of Stan on the Sea Shepherd pointing at another sinking Japanese ship.]
HATOYAMA
Nippon no gaijin! ["Stranger to Japan!" He looks at the paper again] Kuso, taberu na! ["Eat shit!" Crumples up the paper and throws it down.]
[Larry King Live.]
ANNOUNCER
And now, Larry King, live.
LARRY KING
My guest tonight is the little boy who took over the Whale Wars reality show and turned it into a big hit. Please welcome Stan Marsh and his crew.
LUKE
'Ey Jordan! I'm on Larry King, mate!
LARRY KING
So Stan, what motivated you, what... inspired you to get out there and make a hit TV show?
STAN
No I, I don't really care about the TV show, I'm just trying to stop the Japanese from killing dolphins and whales.
LARRY KING
Once you became captain the methods used to stop the Japanese definitely became more aggressive. Was that the key to help boost your ratings?
STAN
...No, I don't care about the show.
WOMAN 2
We're pirates.
STAN
I just want people to know that you can stop the Japanese if you have some real goddamned balls!
WOMAN 2
I've got balls! [Stan looks at her a bit annoyed]
LARRY KING
Well there are many people who see what you're doing as a positive thing, and of course, many that see problems with it. Joining us now is one of those people and... [goes into split screen, with another guest speaking via satellite] You say Stan's methods are unethical.
SID
Larry, you can't just go out and take matters into your own hands like this. If you want a hit TV show you have to go through producers, directors, people that are in unions.
LARRY KING
But Sid, you saw the show before Stan took it over; you have to admit that it was nothing but incompetent vegan pussies doing absolutely nothing and trying to turn it into drama.
SID
Yes, but it doesn't justify changing the entire show structure that their old captain had pitched to the network.
STAN
Can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second?!
LARRY KING
But their old captain, Paul Watson [a real-life photo of him is shown], was an unorganized incompetent media whore who thought lying to everyone was okay as long as it served his cause.
SID
He yes, of course, everyone knows that Paul Watson was a smug, narcoleptic liar with no credibility, but we must-
STAN
Screw this, I gotta get back to work!
[The rechristened Real Whale Wars.]
ANNOUNCER
On this episode of Real Actual Whale Wars, Captain Marsh searches for the Japanese fleet, knowing they could be absolutely anywhere. [Stan is shown on the bridge planning their next move with Crewman 2]
STAN
Would you mind stepping back a little?
LUKE
Captain! Captain, some new volunteers showed up to help us in our crusade! [the cameraman and boom mic operator take a few steps back]
STAN
No- Dude, we really can't take any more volunteers.
LUKE
But they say you know them. [Cartman and Kenny walk through the door]
CARTMAN
Ahall right dude, this is pretty sweet! [his sweater has "SAVE THE WHALES" on it, while Kenny's parka now has "DOLPHIN LOVER" on it].
STAN
Oh no, no, NO.
CARTMAN
What dude?
STAN
Oh what? So now that I have a hit TV show you guys care about dolphins and whales?
CARTMAN
We always have.
KENNY
(Yeah, totally!)
STAN
I asked you guys to help me and you said no!
CARTMAN
That's not what we said.
STAN
You said "Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!"
CARTMAN
We were talking about Wales the country.
STAN
Look, if you admit that you're only doing this because you wanna be on TV, then I'll consider it! Admit you just wanna be on TV!
KENNY
(I just want to be on TV.)
CARTMAN
[under his breath] Kenny! [to Stan] I deserve to be on TV.
CREWMAN 2
Captain! Captain, the Japanese have been spotted near buoy 24!
STAN
Take us out of port! All hands to stations!
CARTMAN
[popping up in front of the camera] All right! Let's go save those whales, you guys! [grins and pumps a fist]
ANNOUNCER
[an aerial view of the Sea Shepherd is shown] Captain Marsh races his boat to the last known location of the Japanese whalers. If he doesn't get there in time, hundreds of dolphins or whales could die.
STAN
As soon as we get there, we've gotta deploy the tracking device! We can't let those whales get hurt! [the Sea Shepherd lurches all of a sudden.]
CREWMAN 2
What the hell was that?!
CREWMAN 3
We just got rammed.
STAN
Oh the Japanese wanna play that way, huh?!
CREWMAN 4
It's not the Japanese.
STAN
What? [goes outside with the crew]
ANNOUNCER
On deck the crew is surprised at what they see. The other boat is from Deadliest Catch, a crab-fishing reality show.
DC CAPTAIN
You think you're so cool, don'tcha?! You think you're big boat reality show on the block?! [goes to a cage and pulls out a crab from it] You're taking away men's livelihoods!
STAN
What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales.
DC CAPTAIN
You're taking viewers away from our show, you stupid ass!
CARTMAN
Your show is fuckin' gay, dude!
DC CREWMAN
Your show is fuckin' gay!
STAN
Screw this! Turn hard to port! [takes the wheel and starts turning left]
ANNOUNCER
But everywhere his reality show's boat turns, the crab fishing reality boat blocks its path. [the crab boat, being smaller and faster, blocks the Sea Shepherd's path quickly]
STAN
Dude, fuck you!
DC CAPTAIN
Fuck you!
ANNOUNCER
It's been three hours and the crab fishing reality show isn't budging. [Stan is in the captain's quarters, sitting behind a desk, his face buried in his arms] Captain Marsh's boat is dead in the water. He can't go after the Japanese, he can't help the whales or dolphins. Once again on Whale Wars, nothing is happening.
CREWMAN 3
[name: Benjamin Potts] It's pretty difficult times because uh, we know that every minute we're sitting here stopped, a, another whale is dying.
CARTMAN
[gets emotional] Really tough, you know. It's... really hard. It's like [sniff], we've dedicated all this time and all our lives to saving these majestic creatures.
KENNY
(And they're all shot.) [cries]
CARTMAN
Shhh, Kenny... [the camera zooms in on Kenny, who's got his face in his hands] Old Ken is taking it especially hard. He's always loved dolphins so much that he- [flashes an angry look at the camera] Yeah yeah but, but keep it in a two-shot, though. [The camera pulls back to its previous position] Yeah, keep it there. [Cartman resumes his tale] He's always loved dolphins so much that he would do anything.
KENNY
(I would do anything!) [puts his face back in his hands and cries.]
ANNOUNCER
The crab-fishing reality show is doing just fine. [the crewmen celebrate another great catch.]
DC CREW
Yeah! Woohoo! Alright! [Stan is again shown in the captain's quarters, his face still buried in his arms on the desk]
ANNOUNCER
But for the Whale Wars crew, it appears the show is over. Until... a sound is heard. [whale sounds. Stan lifts his head up]
STAN
What was that? [moments later the crew goes on deck. Stan is with them]
BENJAMIN
Captain, look!
THE CREW
Wow. Whoa. [before them are a bunch of whales. One of them rams the crab fishing reality show boat]
WOMAN 2
The whales are taking out the crab fisherman reality show!
STAN
It's like... they know. [two whales latch onto buoys at either end of a net and begin to haul away the crab fishing boat.]
DC CREWMEN
Hey. Heeey. Noo! Stop! [the Sea Shepherd crew begin to cheer and jump for joy]
STAN
They do know. They know everything I've been trying to do for them.
CARTMAN
Our gentle friends of the sea have saved the day. Because they know that only we can save them from the Japanese. [small plane engines are now heard. Cartman, Stan, and the others begin to look around]
JAPANESE PILOT
Bonzaaaaaaaai! [flies his plane right into a whale and blows up]
STAN
Jesus Christ! [Everyone looks around as more planes come in and take out the whales surrounding the boat. Two whales take a dive to deeper water, but two planes follow them under and blow up. The whales' corpses float up onto the water's surface.] We've gotta get something to shoot 'em with!
WOMAN 2
Look out! [four Japanes planes crash into the boat and blow it and themselves up. Once the smoke clears, the ocean is shown, filled with debris and carcasses. The crew of the Sea Shepherd is dead... Except for Cartman, Stan, and Kenny, who swim towards a piece of wood.]
STAN
[catching his breath] I, I can't, I can't believe it.
CARTMAN
Dude, you know what? Japanese people really do not like whales. [the Japanese boats pulls up to the boys' location and stops.] Uh oh.
[Tokyo, day. The boys are in a prison cell. Cartman brings out a harmonica and starts playing it.]
CARTMAN
Well I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Japanese prison got me down
Said I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Don't belong here, my eyes are round.
STAN
Will you stop that?
CARTMAN
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I making things uncomfortable for you Stan? It's your fault me and Kenny are in this mess!
STAN
Things are bad enough without you being a smartass! There's whales out there being slaughtered right now and I can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet!
CARTMAN
You don't have a TV show anymore, Captain, so you can just suck my Japanese-imprisoned balls! [goes back to his song. Stan goes to the cell door and looks out]
I'm in a Japanese prison Lawd.
Japanese balls got me down.
[a door opens somewhere and two prison guards walk towards the boys' cell]
GUARD
Itte kure 'Akihito-sama irashaimasu!' ["... 'Welcome, Lord Akihito'!" The boys, not knowing Japanese, say nothing. The guards bow to the emperor]
EMPEROR AKIHITO
So, you are the ones who have been-a sinking our boats!
STAN
You speak English.
EMPEROR AKIHITO
You have caused us many problems, set us back many months!
CARTMAN
Sir, we actually don't give two shits about you killing whales. Can we go?
KENNY
(Yeah, can we go?)
EMPEROR AKIHITO
[steps closer to the door] Why have you done this? Why do you insist on-a making trouble for the Japanese?!
STAN
Why do you do what you do?! Do you know that ninety eight percent of the world is against whaling?! Why can't you just stop?!
EMPEROR AKIHITO
[turns his back on the boys] You think you have the right to tell us what is okay?! I have-a something to show you!
[The Hiroshima Peace Memorial, day. Emperor Akihito takes the boys on a tour of the memorial.]
EMPEROR AKIHITO
This is Hiroshima. Over fifty years ago this entire city was-a destroyed by nuclear bomb. We built this museum so that we never forget what-a happened. [Cartman yawns, Stan punches him on the right shoulder]
CARTMAN
What dude?
[Inside the Memorial.]
EMPEROR AKIHITO
At-a 8:15 a.m. the people of Hiroshima were just minding their own business when out of nowhere a frash devastated them all. [an atomic bomb is detonated] Women and children who died in the frash simply evaporated. [footage of bomb victims appears] Those reft arrive suffered the worst pain of all. Burns, radiation poisoning. For generations the radiation affected the victims. Japanese babies born without rimbs. Without eyes! [Cartman snickers. The emperor turns, folds his arms over his chest, and glares at him]
CARTMAN
Sorry. [clears his throat.] A little gassy. 'Scuse me.
EMPEROR AKIHITO
One hundred and forty thousand Japanese were killed by atom bomb. We have never recovered from the memory of that day. It is impossible for a nation to ever forgive an act so horrible. This-a picture shows the prane that dropped the bomb. [shows it to the boys] It was called the Enora Gay. And it was frown by the monsters who dropped the bomb that day. Dohfin, and Weiru! [the pilots are shown to be a dolphin and a whale. The emperor shakes with anger]
STAN
Ummm, where did you get that picture?
EMPEROR AKIHITO
The Americans were nice enough to give it to us the day after the bombing. We were so-a thankful for the picture that the next day we ended our war with America. We will never forgive, never rest until they are all wiped out! Fuck you. Fuck you dohfin and-a weiru!
CARTMAN
So that's what this has all been about?
STAN
Dude, it wasn't actually and dolphin and a whale who bombed Hiroshima. It was the-
CARTMAN
Zzzzt zzzzsssht! [whispers aloud] Dude, they won't rest until whoever is responsible is completely wiped out.
STAN
Oh, right. Look, I... I think I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?
[Kyle's bedroom. He's working at his computer when the phone rings. He picks up his cell phone and answers.]
KYLE
Hello? Stan?
STAN
Dude, are you sitting at your computer? I need you to do something for me.
[At the Prime Minister's office, later.]
STAN
Mister Prime Minister, Japanese officials, there's something you need to know. The photo you were given of the Enola Gay was doctored. Because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they... simply pointed the finger at somebody else. My government has authorized me to give you the original photo, unaltered, so you can finally know the truth. [pulls out a manila envelope and walks to the Prime Minister's desk] Dolphins and whales were just framed by the real bombers. [hands the envelope to the Prime Minister, who opens it and pulls out the "unaltered" photo. The Prime Minister and the officials crowd in to look at the photo.] A chicken and a cow.
EMPEROR AKIHITO
Chicken and-a cow? Chicken and-a cow?!
HATOYAMA
Chicken and cow use poor dohfin and weiru as-a scapegoat?! This is outrage! [pounds his desk]
[A cow pasture. Cows go about grazing, minding their own business, when the Japanese return to the U.S., only now they're killing cows.]
THE JAPANESE
Fuck you cows!
[A chicken coop. The Japanese converge on it and kill the chickens inside.]
THE JAPANESE
Teikara chickens!
RANDY
[watches all this with Stan] Great job, son. Now the Japanese are normal, like us.

script:The F Word

[A pond in a meadow. A hummingbird flits from flower to flower, then flies off as the camera zooms out to reveal the four boys there. Stan is fishing on one rock, Kenny is resting on another reading a magazine, Kyle stands near the water's edge, Cartman is sitting behind him on a third rock.]
CARTMAN
Isn't this great, you guys? Gettin' away from it all, leaving all our cares behind?
STAN
Yeah, and they said the weather's gonna be nice like this all day.
KYLE
This... is exactly what I needed.
KENNY
(Meee toooo.) [a second later and the roar of motorcycles is heard, making the boys jump up startled. They look around]
STAN
Aww! Not those guys again! [the boys leave the pond and head over to the source of the noise - a group of bikers idling at at intersection for no other reason than to revel in the sound of their own bikes' motors]
CARTMAN
God damn it, why is it every time we try to have a relaxing day a bunch of assholes on their Harley motorcycles show up?! [the bikers just cheer each other on, but the motors drown them out]
STAN
God! Shut up!
CARTMAN
Piss off, you stupid assholes! [the bikers ride off]
[A restaurant. The Marshes and the Broflovskis are dining al fresco.]
RANDY
Isn't this great food?
GERALD
You're so right about this place. It's wonderful.
RANDY
You know what's really interesting is that- [the bikers roar in and stop at a crosswalk at one end of the restaurant, which is called Café Monet, and rev their motors. After a few seconds they ride away] ...what's really interesting is that this place has a new owner, and they-
[An outdoor wedding. Father Maxi presides.]
FATHER MAXI
On this gorgeous day we bring these two together for the most important ta- [the bikers roar in and slow down. The guests and the bride glare at the bikers as they roll slowly by]
LEAD BIKER
Everybody's checking us out.
BIKER 2
Yeah, they think we're pretty cool.
[A diner. People go about their conversations. Among them, the bikers.]
LEAD BIKER
Hooo! We were definitely turnin' some heads out there.
BIKER 3
Yeah!
BIKER 2
I was pullin' back on that throttle, and everybody was like, "What is that?"
BIKER 4
Fer sure!
BIKER 3
Yeah.
BIKER 5
Hey- hey, nobody here is really paying attention to us.
LEAD BIKER
That's weird. [clears his throat and starts imitating a motorcycle engine. The other bikers follow suit, and a few of the patrons look at them] Oh yeah, that's better.
[The diner's men's room. A biker approaches a urinal, unzips, and gets to work. He looks left, then he looks right, then he clears his throat and revs up with his voice until the patron at right looks at him. He turns to his left and does the same to the patron at left. That patron looks at him. Once he's sure both men are looking at him, he faces forward and finishes urinating.]
[The diner, outside. Its name is Ronny's Diner. The bikers stream out of there and get on their bikes.]
LEAD BIKER
All right let's head out. [the others agree and begin to rev their voices as they board their bikes.]
CARTMAN
[walking into view] Excuse me. Excuse me! Hey assholes! [the bikers quiet down, turn off their motors, and look at him] You guys know that everyone thinks you're total fags, right?
LEAD BIKER
...What did you say?
CARTMAN
You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right?
BIKER 6
...Hey man, we roll how we roll, and if people are annoyed or intimidated by it, that's too bad for them!
BIKER 2
Yeah! [the bikers rev their voices again]
CARTMAN
No no, no, nobody is intimidated, actually. Everyone realizes that people who are so needy for attention they need to dress up and be as loud as possible are you guys and sixteen-year-old girls! Just wanted to let you know, you're fuckin' fags. [proceeds to walk past the line of bikes]
BIKER 7
Thah- that little boy just called us fags.
BIKER 2
Like he didn't think we were cool.
BIKER 6
But he's wrong. People don't think we're fags, do they?
LEAD BIKER
'Course he's wrong! And anyway, nobody except that little freak would ever say something like it to our faces!
OTHER BIKERS
Yeah! Let's ride! [they rev up their voices and their motors] Let's go! Rev 'em up! [they ride off]
[Kyle's house, Ike's room, day. Ike is playing with a toy xylophone when the bikers go down his street. He puts the xylophone sticks to his ears to block out the noise, but that doesn't work. He goes to his window, lifts it up and yells.]
IKE
Fags! [then closes his window]
BIKER 2
Did that kid just call us-?
LEAD BIKER
Ju-just ignore him! [as they ride, a car pulls up in front of them. Two kids in the back seat turn and make gestures to them. One of the boys makes a sign, then turns it around. Both kids hold it up. It says "FAGS." One of them mouths the word and the boys laugh.] God damn it, this is fucked up!
BIKER 8
What's wrong with kids today? [revs his voice a little]
[The desert. The lead biker is pretty bummed at the treatment the bikers have been getting.]
BIKER 4
It doesn't make any sense. They all called us fags.
BIKER 6
How can they call us fags? I mean, listen to this? [revs his motor up]
LEAD BIKER
I know, I know! Look, guys, I think I know what the problem is here.
BIKER 3
Really? You do?
BIKER 9
Whatwhat?
LEAD BIKER
Yeah, think about it, guys. You see all the things kids have today? I mean, with their Xboxes and surround-sound entertainment systems, kids today are surrounded by big loud stuff all the time!
BIKER 10
Hey, that's right.
LEAD BIKER
That's all it is, guys. We just need to get a little louder, that's all. [revs up his voice and his bike, and the others follow suit.]
[The neighborhood park. The boys are playing basketball.]
KYLE
Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass.
CARTMAN
But Cartman isn't letting up on him. [the bikers roll by and the boys stop playing]
KYLE
Oh, what the hell?! [the bikers roll by with a variety of musical instruments, a siren, and a rooster attached to their bikes, all of them making noise.]
BIKER 6
Chicken spears! Chicken spears! Chicken spears! ...Chicken spears! Chicken spears!
STAN
God damn it God damn it!
LEAD BIKER
Oh yeah, now we're turnin' some heads! [blows into one of the two horns on his handlebars]
BIKER 2
Let's see 'em call us fags now!
[Stan's house, later. The boys present in the living room are the four boys, Tolkien, Jimmy, Clyde, and Butters.]
STAN
All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it.
KYLE
Yes.
CARTMAN
Agreed.
JIMMY
I have had it with those loud, annoying, f-f-f f-faggots.
STAN
Now, we have some ideas, and we'd love to hear your ideas, and I think together we can- [the bikers roll by on Stan's street, then Stan sighs when they're gone] ...and I think that together we can come up with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all.
KYLE
Sounds good.
JIMMY
Okay good, yeah.
CARTMAN
Ni-nice, okay.
BUTTERS
What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato!
CARTMAN
What?
BUTTERS
I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! "Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough!" Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider!
STAN
...That makes perfect sense, Butters.
BUTTERS
It does?
STAN
Yes, now get out of here.
BUTTERS
Okay. [walks out]
STAN
Alright, Kyle and I are gonna spray paint messages to the Harley riders; Cartman, you said you had an idea?
CARTMAN
I think what I'm gonna do is uh, find out wherever their bikes are and uh, crap on their seats.
STAN
[taking notes] Oh that's good.
CARTMAN
[taking notes] Yeah, I think that'll be nice.
STAN
But that's a lot of seats? How are you going to pull that off?
CARTMAN
I think I just need uh two, maybe three buckets of KFC, extra crispy, probably ...four cartons of gravy.
STAN
Clyde, can you take care of getting KFC for Cartman? Kyle and I will get the spray paint cans. If we do this right, we'll be doing the town a huge favor, so let's get to it!
ALL
Yeah!
[Ronny's diner, next morning. The bikers stream out of there and to their bikes.]
LEAD BIKER
Now that was a good breakfast.
BIKER 6
I'm full. [the bikers all rev their voices again and stand by their bikes...]
LEAD BIKER
[sniffs] You guys smell that? Smells like that new famous bowl at KFC.
BIKER 6
Ohh, OHHH! SOMEBODY TOOK A SHIT ON MY FUCKIN' HARLEY!!!
BIKER 3
What?
BIKER 2
Awwww, me too! I got shit all over my pants now! [another biker throws up on his Harley]
BIKER 7
There's little flags stuck in the shit!
LEAD BIKER
[picks the flag off his Harley and reads it] "You're fags."
BIKER 11
You've gotta be kidding me!
LEAD BIKER
Come on, we'll find the bastards who did this! [the bikers wipe the crap off their bikes, rev their voices and their bikes, hop on, and ride off. They stop at an intersection and look up at a billboard. It's a Harley-Davidson billboard, and on it is spray-painted "FAGS GET OUT." They cross the intersection and continue down the road, stopping again when three buildings next to each other have the same message spray-painted on them.]
BIKER 12
This can't be happening. [they continue riding]
[An alley. The boys reflect on their work.]
STAN
Really nice work, guys.
KYLE
Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.
[A sidewalk nearby. Big Gay Al and Mr. Slave walk down the sidewalk hand in hand.]
BIG GAY AL
And so I said to the guy, "you really think I'm paying that much?"
MR. SLAVE
Heheh, oh Jesus Christ. [both men stop and gasp at what they see: the same three buildings the bikers just passed, and the message spray-painted on it] Oh my God.
BIG GAY AL
I thought we were past this.
[South Park Elementary School gym. The mayor and city officials as well as Principal Victoria and Counselor Mackey address the student body.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Students, I am here because of a very serious matter. This morning it was discovered that in several places all over town, somebody had spray-painted the words, "Fags get out." Many witnesses reported seeing children with spray paint. Now, if anybody knows anything about the kids who did this, you must come forward-
CARTMAN
That was us!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
...'Scuse me?
STAN
Yeah, we did that!
KYLE, KENNY
Yeah!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
...Why would you write something like that and be proud of it?!
KYLE
W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of our town.
CARTMAN
Yeah, everyone hates those fags, right?
OTHER KIDS
Yeah, uh huh, I do, yep. [the students begin to murmur]
MR. MACKEY
Now just what the heck is going on here?! This is not what we have taught you in this school! Kyle and Stan, you've always been tolerant of gay people!
STAN
Gay people?
KYLE
We aren't talking about gay people.
MR. MACKEY
You just admitted to spray-painting that they should get out of town!
STAN
Dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town?
CARTMAN
Oh, they think we meant gay fags.
KYLE
Oh. Hey, that's not very nice, Mayor. Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
What?! You four boys, in my office, NOW!
STAN
Aw crap!
[South Park Public Library, day. A row of motorcycles is at the front door.]
LEAD BIKER
Faggot, often shortened to fag, has been used in the English language since the late sixteenth century. Its original meaning was "an old or unpleasant woman".
BIKER 2
That certainly don't apply to us.
LEAD BIKER
Faggot later was defined as a bundle of sticks. And in the nineteenth century, a faggot gatherer was someone who made a meager living gathering firewood.
BIKER 6
Well they certainly ain't calling us fags 'cause we gather sticks; there's got to be more! [begins revving his voice. The other bikers begin revving theirs, and the librarian shushes them. The bikers tone down their revving.]
BIKER 2
What's that part say there?
LEAD BIKER
Later, the term "fag" was defined as any awkward bundle to be carried, and was often used as an insult to the elderly, as in calling them "baggage".
BIKER 2
Fag was used as an insult to women, then poor people, then old people?
LEAD BIKER
In the early 1900s the word became a pe-jo-ra-tive term against homosexuals and transgender people in the United States.
BIKER 10
Well that word just keeps changing its meaning. What's it got to do with us? [begins revving his voice. The other bikers begin revving theirs, and the librarian shushes them again. The bikers tone down their revving.]
[A courtroom. A panel of judges is interrogating the four boys.]
JUDGE 1
We are really trying to understand this. How is it that you boys think referring to gay people as fags in today's world is acceptable?
KYLE
[exasperated] Because we're not referring to gay people! You can be gay and not be a fag.
STAN
Yeah, a lot of fags aren't gay.
JUDGE 2
I happen to be gay, boys. Do you think I'm a fag?
STAN
Do you ride a big loud Harley and go up and down the streets, ruining everyone's nice time?
JUDGE 2
No.
STAN
Then you're not a fag.
JUDGE 1
So what if a guy is gay and rides a Harley?
CARTMAN
Then he's a gay fag. I mean, is this really this hard?
STAN
I don't know.
KENNY
(This is fucking ridiculous.)
STAN
All right, look, you're driving in your car, okay? And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal. The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming. And even when the light turns red, a guy in a BMW runs the red light so you can't make your left turn. What goes through your mind?
JUDGE 3
"Fag."
STAN
Right. But you're not thinkin' "Oh, he's a homosexual," you're thinkin' "Oh, he's an inconsiderate douchebag like a Harley rider."
JUDGE 1
This, this is, making insanely good sense to me.
JUDGE 4
Alright, how about this: What would you call a straight man who doesn't own a Harley, but likes them and might buy one someday?
CARTMAN
You call them "bike-curious".
JUDGE 1
"Bike-cu-"
STAN
"Bike-curious"! Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?!
KENNY
[puts his head in his hands out of frustration] (Jesus fucking Christ!)
[The South Park Community Center, evening. Big Gay Al is holding a meeting there.]
BIG GAY AL
Fellow homosexuals, I believe we have an opportunity here to take a big step forward for our kind. We must acknowledge that the words "fag" and "faggot" are never going to disappear. They're simply too much fun for everyone to say. But we must realize that we are no longer the most hated people on the planet, and help the children change the meaning of the word to describe those annoying loud faggot Harley riders!
MR. SLAVE
[clapping] Hear hear!
BIG GAY AL
We should all be tolerant, but not with these fucking people! They really are faggots!
MR. SLAVE
Yes Jesus yes!

ANNOUNCER
This is Channel 4 Evening News.
NEWS ANCHOR
A new movement in South Park is bringing to question the word "fag". Gay groups are pointing out that the word no longer means to kids today what it meant just a few years ago.
FIELD REPORTER
And what is your name, little boy?
MARTIN
Martin.
FIELD REPORTER
Alright Martin, can you do me a favor? Could you point to the "fag" for me? [shows him a poster with two pictures on it - one of a biker, the other of of a man dressed in women's swimwear. The boy is unsure what to do] Just point to which one is the fag. [Martin finally steps up and points to the biker. The next clip is of the reporter asking a baby] All right now could you just point to the fag for me, little girl? Which one is a faggot? [holds up another poster with two different pictures on it - one of a biker, another of Liberace. The baby starts to lean to one side, and her mom moves her in that direction until the baby points to the biker.]
NEWS ANCHOR
[shown are the Mayor and her aides, and Big Gay Al and Mr. Slave] Sparked by this realization and persuaded by a gay advocate group, the Mayor signed a new city ordinance today making the word "fag" officially refer to annoying inconsiderate Harley riders. [next she's shown in front of City Hall with an aide and the four boys]
FIELD REPORTER
[interviewing the bikers] How do you fags feel about the new city ordinance?
LEAD BIKER
What did you say?
FIELD REPORTER
Just asking you if you feel okay or displeased about the ordinance, fag.
LEAD BIKER
Hey you know what? If you call me fag in my face one more time, you'd better-
FIELD REPORTER
I already did it twice.
LEAD BIKER
Well I think that- I think that you uh, you probably won't say it again.
FIELD REPORTER
I bet I do.
LEAD BIKER
Well okay, I-
FIELD REPORTER
Fag. [the lead biker throws a punch, knocking the reporter down and cutting off the video feed]
NEWS ANCHOR
[Randy is shown watering his lawn] As more people in South Park adapt to the new meaning... [the bikers roll down Randy's street. He turns to see them]
RANDY
Fags! [turns back to water his lawn. The bikers look at him and move on. Next, Father Maxi is shown holding a sign in front of his church: "GOD HATES FAGS" as the bikers pass by]
NEWS ANCHOR
...more and more Harley riders are deciding to ride elsewhere.
[The neighborhood park. The boys are playing basketball again. Kenny takes a shot.]
CARTMAN
Oh yeah, nice, Kenny. [Kenny gets the ball and throws it to Stan, who dribbles it a bit and gets ready to shoot]
STAN
Isn't this awesome, you guys? I haven't seen a Harley for like three days.
KYLE
I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[runs up to the boys] You four turd balls in my office NOW!
STAN
Aw crap! [drops the basketball]
[City Hall, the Mayor's office, day.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
You have got me in a lot of trouble! [turns on the TV]
ANOTHER MAYOR
The fact of the matter is that "fag" is still defined in the dictionary as a pejorative term against homosexuals, and so you are still causing harm to gay people everywhere whether you mean it differently or not! The town of South Park and its mayor have once again shown themselves to be completely out of touch with the progressive world!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
She's gaining support all over the country. I should have never listened to you!
KYLE
We're sorry, Mayor.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Oh, that's nice! You made our entire town look like gay-bashing redneck homophobes, but at least you're sorry!
STAN
We can fix this!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
HOW?!
STAN
That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition.
CARTMAN
Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over the country.
[The desert, day. The bikers are gathered there again revving their voices and their motorcycles.]
LEAD BIKER
Now I don't know about you, but I think this town is starting a trend. And if we let them officially change the meaning of "fag" from gay people to us, then soon every town might. [the bikers rev up their voices and bikes] If we don't do anything, we can end up trying to fight e- [one biker continues to rev up his voice and bike] If we don't do anything, we c-... Hey Bartlett. Bartlett! [stands in front of him] I'm trying to talk, you fag! [Bartlett is stunned, as are the other bikers] Aw, see? Now they got us doin' it to ourselves! We gotta put a stop to this now! [the bikers rev up their voices and bikes] We're going to ride into that town and kick some fuckin' ass! [the bikers rev up their voices and bikes]
[City Hall, day. A stage has been set up. The four boys sit on the left side of the stage and the city seal takes up the center. People are taking pictures, an orchestra plays grandstand music leading into "Pomp and Circumstance". A banner over the stage reads: Welcome Dictionary Officiates.]
FIELD REPORTER
Excitement is in the air as the citizens of South Park amass to see if the word "fag" will officially be changed in the English dictionary. Four local boys will state their case to the head dictionary editor, and if they succeed, "fag" will officially refer to Harley riders nationwide.
BIG GAY AL
You can do it, boys! We believe in you!
FIELD REPORTER
And Tom, it looks as though the dictionary officials have arrived. [three officials walk up the red carpet, one of them holding the dictionary on its own pillow.] Entering the scene now are the keepers of the current dictionary and of course, the dictionary's head editor, Mr. Emmanuel Lewis. [shown in a gown following the three men]
CARTMAN
Emmanuel Lewis, huh?
STAN
Ohh, it all makes sense now. [the four men walk onto the right side of the stage. The crowd cheers and claps]
EMMANUEL LEWIS
To change... [the crowd falls silent] the definition of a word... is no trifling thing. I expect this proposal for changing the definition of the word "fag" to be both discerning and undisputable.
BIG GAY AL
Come on boys, you can do it! [motorcycle engines are heard. A horde of bikers roars towards City Hall. Randy gets up and sounds the alarm]
RANDY
Look out, it's a bunch of pissed-off faggots! [everyone scatters as the bikers arrive and tear everything up. One of them throws a bottle bomb at a store, breaking a window and setting it on fire. A family nearby escapes injury. Three bikers ram their motorcycles into the stage]
STAN
There's fags everywhere!
KYLE
We gotta run! [the boys leave the stage quickly. A biker throws his chain towards the stage, catching Emmanuel Lewis by the right ankle and pulling him off the stage and down the street.]
EMMANUEL LEWIS
WAAAH! What nefariousness is this?! Ogh! You obdurate beast! [as the town falls into chaos, the boys run into an alley, but find that it has a dead end. The bikers gather at the alley's entrance and the lead biker walks up to the boys. The other bikers get off their Harleys and follow]
LEAD BIKER
[stops] Well well. Now, do you think we're fags?
STAN
[backing up as far as he can] Yes. Yes, sir, you are total fags. [the other boys do as well]
KYLE
Yeah. You definitely made your point.
BIKER 13
No! We rolled in, kicked ass, and took shit over! Is that what a fag does?!
STAN
Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does.
LEAD BIKER
No, you're supposed to think we're not fags now!
STAN
But then why are you acting like such fags? I don't understand.
KYLE
I don't either.
BUTTERS
[voice only] That's because you guys never understood! [walks through the crowd of bikers and past the lead biker] You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom.
BIKER 14
Who is this little fag?
BUTTERS
I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious.
BIKER 15
That's it, let's kill them all!
CARTMAN
No! That'll just make you bigger fags!
BIG GAY AL
[voice only] No one is killing anyone! [a sound of guns being cocked. The bikers turn to see who's at the alley entrance - Big Gay Al and his gay support group. One group member holds a sign - "GAYS AGAINST FAGS"] We've had enough! You faggots get the hell out of our town!
LEAD BIKER
[seeing no choice but to accept the word] All right everyone, all right. We are fags. Yeah, we're fags. We're total fags. And you know what? We like it.
BIKER 2
Yeah, we like being fags.
LEAD BIKER
So go ahead, America. Whenever you pass by Harley riders like us, roll down your window, and yell "Faggots!" All you kids out there, when you see us, walk up to us, and say "Hello, fags." No, really, we want you to. At least we're cool enough to embrace who we are. Right guys?
BIKERS
That's right. You got it. Yeah. [more of this, followed by revving voices and motors]
BIKER 6
Come on, fags, let's roll out! [the bikers ride away. Emmanuel Lewis limps back onto the stage]
STAN
...And that, Mister Editor, is why they are the true definition of fags.
EMMANUEL LEWIS
Let there be no perplexity: those individuals are the legitimate faggots. The definition shall be replaced. [everyone in town, even the homosexuals, cheer this change]
STAN
We did it! Yeah!
KYLE
Yeah! We did it, you guys! [he and Stan hug]
CARTMAN
Oh it's over, it's finally over! [he and Kenny do a shoulder embrace. Stan walks up to the camera]
STAN
Today, we've made history.
[Fag (făg) n. 1. An extremely annoying, inconsiderate
person most commonly associated with Harley riders.
2. A person who owns or frequently rides a Harley.]

[South Park Elementary, start of the school day. The chimes play as the fourth grader class pays attention. The following is all voice-over:]
GORDON STOLTSKI
Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements, Parent-teacher conferences begin next Thursday. If you have not yet done so, please turn in your parents' requested time sheets by the end of fifth period today. [Kindergarten class is shown, with a female teacher] Lunch today will be a choice of chicken tostadas or spaghetti with a marninara sauce and side salad. [Fourth grade class is shown again.] Attention fourth graders: the fall registration for glee club starts tomorrow. Any interested students should fill out a- [a door is heard being kicked in] Whoa, what's going on?
INTRUDER
I'll killl you! [the class pays closer attention] I swear to God I'll kill you!
GORDON STOLTSKI
Who are you?!
INTRUDER
I'm the man who's gonna put a bullet between your eyes!
GORDON STOLTSKI
Hey! He's got a gun!
INTRUDER
You little bastard! You fucked my wife! You think I wouldn't find out?!
GORDON STOLTSKI
Sir, please, I don't know you.
INTRUDER
Yeah, right!
MAN
All right, what the hell is going on around here? You sir need to leave this area- [two gun shots are heard and the man is heard falling with a thud]
GORDON STOLTSKI
Oh God, he shot him!
INTRUDER
Ya had to push me, didn't ya?! NOW YOU!
GORDON STOLTSKI
HAAAAAAAAAA! Sir, I truly don't know- [Gunshot] th-AAAAA! AAAA!
INTRUDER
There! How's it feel, huh?!
GORDON STOLTSKI
[shrieking] Please, I don't know you! Uughuh!
INTRUDER
You're Gordon Saltski, right?! Truck driver from Chicago?!
GORDON STOLTSKI
No, I'm Gordon Stoltski, third grader who reads the morning announcements!
INTRUDER
Yeah, right! We'll see if that's true. Go on, read the morning announcements!
GORDON STOLTSKI
SOMEBODY HELP ME!
INTRUDER
I SAID DO IT! [smack]
GORDON STOLTSKI
AAAAA! AAAAA! AAAAAAAAAA! AAA! Any, any interested students should fill out an applicant survey-- [smack] WAA! WAAAAAAAAAA!
INTRUDER
I knew you were lyin'! That was terrible! Now put your mouth over the barrel of this gun!
GORDON STOLTSKI
No please! I'm so scared! [more softly] I'm so scared!
INTRUDER
DO IT!
GORDON STOLTSKI
[freakout] Please! I'll duh, I'll do whatever you say! Here! Here I see! Here! [his voice gets muffled] I got my mouth on the ba- [the gun goes off and Gordon falls on the floor]
INTRUDER
Look at you now. We're all dead. [shoots himself]
[His memorial service in the school gymnasium, day. Mr. Mackey presides over it.]
MR. MACKEY
We will always remember the way that Gordon bravely read the announcements every morning, led us in the Pledge of Allegiance, m'kay, and touched many kids' lives here at the school. And even though we now know the shooter had him confused with a forty-year-old truck driver who happened to have a similar name, I know this has been ...pretty traumatizing, m'kay. But now we must decide who will pick up where little Gordon left off. Who will take his place reading the morning announcements? It's a big responsibility, because it will be your voice the entire school listens to, m'kay? And although Gordon Stoltski can never be replaced, m'kay, there must be a student out there who has the drive and the passion to... have his or her voice heard every morning.
CARTMAN
Oh. My. Goodddd.
[Mr. Mackey's office, day. A sign on the door reads "Morning Announcement Tryouts" Cartman and another kid wait on chairs next to the door.]
CARTMAN
Soo, you're uuh, trying out to be the morning announcement person as well?
MIKE
Yeah, I think it would be really fu-fu-fu-fun, and ru-ru-ru-rurrraise my self es-es-esesesteem.
MR. MACKEY
[cracks the door open and looks out] Oh, this is it, huh? Okay, uhhh Mike, why don't we have you try out first, ituh m'kay. [Mike gets off the chair and enters the office.]
CARTMAN
[cackles] He stutters like a bitch! I've got this job in the bag! [another boy walks up and sits in the chair to Cartman's right. Cartman notices immediately: the boy is well-dressed] Who are you?
CASEY MILLER
My name is Casey Miller, and I'm in the third grade. [Cartman is awed] Ever since I can remember people have told me I should read their morning announcements. My friends always said to me, "Dear Casey, your voice is like butter to our ears. Could you please find a way to get that audible chocolate on the airwaves?" Well, here I am, and hopefully I'll be the kid with the job. [Cartman is mad now and gives him a hard look]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, really nice, Mike, uh, maybe next time you can get past the first word. Oh, Casey Miller, good, you're trying out too?
CASEY
I'm tryin' out and dryin' out in the sultry summer sun that is my voice.
MR. MACKEY
M'kay. Eric, you wanna go next? [Cartman gets off his chair and walks into the office, keeping his eyes on Casey until the door closes]
[Mr. Mackey's office, inside. Mr. Mackey and Cartman sit on two chairs opposite each other.]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay Eric, I'm just gonna have you read this piece of paper.
CARTMAN
Mr. Mackey, what's a moronic jizzrag?
MR. MACKEY
What? What on earth are you askin' me that for?!
CARTMAN
Well it's just that... that's what that Casey kid said about your hairpiece? [Mr. Mackey opens his office door to yell at Casey]
MR. MACKEY
Get lost, you little dirtball!
CASEY
Excuse me?
MR. MACKEY
I said take a hike!
CASEY
I don't understand... what I did wrong.
MR. MACKEY
Beat it, you're not gettin' the job! [Casey gets off his chair and walks away]
[South Park Elementary, morning. The fourth grade class is shown as the intercom comes on.]
CARTMAN
Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. And I, am Eric Cartman. All forms for the school book drive must be handed in to Mr. Davis in the library by the end of the school day today. Hm, doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that, uh, 'kay. Oh well. [reads the next announcement] For lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches. Cold sandwiches. Oh well, thank you so much! Remember when we used to be served hot food? I mean, what has happened to our school? This school is transforming into something very bad, and why? Because we have leadership that doesn't care! I'm talking of course about our student body president, Wendy Testaburger! [Wendy's mouth drops open] Ever since Wendy was elected student body president, this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice! The music room will be closed off today due to painting. All students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead. Oh oh, so now, so now the school is using money to paint the music room. How old and outdated is our playground equipment? What other school has a fifteen-year-old merry-go-round on it? Our school president is turning this whole place into Communist Russia! [Clyde has gone to sleep, half the class is getting sleepy, Stan buries his head in his arms] It's not a coincidence that once Wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams! Your teachers don't wanna tell you, but they are scared, and they should be, because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners.
BUTTERS
Oh jeez!
CARTMAN
But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions!
KYLE
Will somebody shut him up?
[The principal's office, after the announcements. Cartman walks into the office. Mr. Mackey stands to Principal Victoria's left.]
CARTMAN
You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
The job is to read what is written on the paper, Eric, not to embellish the way you do.
CARTMAN
Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
No, it's just that the announcements need to be quick so the students can get on with their work.
CARTMAN
Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day?!
MR. MACKEY
Well, because he was being murdered.
CARTMAN
You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am not Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
All we ask is you keep it shorter.
CARTMAN
Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting!
[South Park Elementary, morning. Cartman is back at the announcement desk. He's smiling, and clears his throat. Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, and two school district officials look on.]
CARTMAN
Well. Goood morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. Tryouts for the soccer team are on Friday afternoon. That is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field. [The first or second grade class is shown] I have a question. What does Wendy Testaburger actually do? She is supposed to be the president, right? What is her agenda? She's lying to everyone? Or is she? Let's ask these questions. [next day] Today I wanna talk briefly about the state of our school's economy. The bake sale last week was a complete failure. And in the school- [next day] And besides that, who actually voted for Wendy Testaburger? I know I didn't. And everyone who did is now scratching their heads and goin' "Whoops. Guess I shouldn't have done that." [next day] I'm not in the student council, I'm just a normal kid like all of you. And like all of you, I want to know what has happened... to my school.
[Cartman leads the school in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.]
THIRD GRADERS
I pledge allegiance to the fag -
CARTMAN
- of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole -
KINDERGARTNERS
- a socialist dunghole...
[South Park Elementary, morning. Cartman is back at the announcement desk.]
CARTMAN
Good morning students. These are the morning announcements. If you'll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class, [The lights go down and a monitor is shown above Mr. Garrison's desk] you will see that the announcements are now being done in video.
KYLE
Oh God, no! [Cartman has made his own graphic introduction full of poses]
CARTMAN
Lunch today is going to be pizza. Again. [exhales forcefully] Friends, our school is dying and you know it. You feel it. You're like, you're like me; you wanna change it. But ohhh no, Wendy Testaburger's not gonna let that happen! This is not the school we grew up in, and ...and I don't know if we can get it back. [leaves his desk and walks over to a mobile blackboard] So let's take a look at exactly what our school president wants. You know, what is she trying to achieve? Let's just take a look at these Keywords here: Wendy's made it clear she wants our school to be a more Integrated Leftist and Liberal place! But you see what then happens, what we get is a Socialist, Modern, Utopian, Reformed, Farce of a School. So when you look closely it becomes very obvious what Wendy wants. K I L L S M U R F S. Our school president ...wants to kill Smurfs.
IKE
[upset to the fact] NOOO!
CARTMAN
I don't know if we're turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we're turning into, but unless you ask why [writes Y on the board], we're gonna transform into something.
[South Park Elementary, school hallway, day. Wendy is at her locker when Butters approaches with a group of friends. We'll call them Melvins, after the group he formed with Dougie and Pip back in Season 3.]
BUTTERS
Hey Wendy! Wendy! Is it true?
WENDY
Is what true?
BUTTERS
That you hate Smurfs?
WENDY
I don't have time for this.
BUTTERS
Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!
MELVINS
Yeah, that's right. We can ask. [Casey is among them]
WENDY
Try to understand this: all I do is try to help run student council. I don't give a crap about Smurfs!
BUTTERS
[gasps and points] It is true!
MELVIN 1
Oh my God!
MELVIN 2
Yeah, bemememe!
MELVIN 3
Oh my God!
WENDY
Maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does, before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you! [storms off]
BUTTERS
What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch.
CASEY
Hyeah.
MELVIN 1
That was cool.
MELVIN 4
Awesome.
MELVIN 2
Yeah, that was cool.
MELVIN 3
Yeah, great job.
[The cafeteria entrance, day. To one side is a huge poster on the wall and a smaller sign near a desk at which sits Cartman signing copies of his new book, "What Happened To My School?"]
CARTMAN
"Thank you" and this is to..?
DOUGLAS
Douglas.
CARTMAN
[signs a copy] "To Douglas." There you go. [gives it to him] Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick up your copy.
BUTTERS
Hey Eric!
CARTMAN
Well hello. Another person who [looks to his right and tries to get the other kids' attention as they stream into the cafeteria] cares about the future of our school.
BUTTERS
Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything.
CARTMAN
Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book.
BUTTERS
Cool, thanks.
CARTMAN
That'll be five dollars.
BUTTERS
[a bit disappointed] Oh, okay. [hands him a five-dollar bill]
STAN
What the hell do you think you're doing?!
CARTMAN
A book signing.
STAN
I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut!
CARTMAN
I do not directly say she's a slut!
STAN
"Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end".
CARTMAN
[leans over the table and points something out to him] You didn't read the rest, dude.
STAN
"Or does she?"
CARTMAN
"Or does she?" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it!
BUTTERS
[showing up with his Melvins] Yeah, and she hates Smurfs!
[Some younger boys are reading the book.]
BOY 1
"Shouldn't we be worried if our school president is a girl who would rather get her tits licked than go to student council meetings?" [the other boys react to that passage]
STAN
Hey hey, stop reading that!
BOY 1
Wull what do you mean?
STAN
Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about!
BOY 2
Yes it does!
CASEY
Eric Cartman is simply making it so that all kids take responsibility to question their school leaders. We should all ask if our president is a penis-hungry hooker with a huge vagina. I'm Casey Miller. [Stan turns and walks away. He sees Wendy at her locker and approaches her.]
STAN
Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now?
WENDY
I really don't care, Stan.
STAN
Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.
WENDY
I'm not giving Eric Fartman one minute of my time, you got that?! I'm not acknowledging his stupid questions. If you want him dealt with, you'll have to do it yourself! [takes up her backpack and storms off]
[The principal's office, after the announcements. Cartman walks into the office. Mr. Mackey stands to Principal Victoria's left.]
CARTMAN
You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Eric, we've been informed by a concerned student that you are writing naughty books about one of the girls here at the school.
CARTMAN
Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about?
MR. MACKEY
Eric, apparently you wrote that Wendy's private parts are big enough to fly an airplane through, m'kay?
CARTMAN
And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?!
MR. MACKEY
Eric, the student body president really doesn't have the kind of power that you-
CARTMAN
Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[stands up] Eric, I've had enough! You cannot and you will not sell your books on school grounds! Do I make myself clear?!
CARTMAN
Clear as summer rain! Clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water! This school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isn't free! Well I'm not gonna be a part of it, do you understand?! I'm leaving this... hypocritical Communist school! I'm walking out and I'm never coming back! [turns and storms out of the office.]
[South Park Elementary, next morning. The students are entering the school. Later...]
ANNOUNCER
[an adult male] Live, from the principal's office, these are the morning announcements. Here, is Eric Cartman.
CARTMAN
Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being allowed to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs. [an animated sequence begins. Smurf Village is shown] I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust. [one day he steps up, and they gather round him] It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own. [they bring him a cap big enough to fit his head, he puts it on and grins. The camera pans up and the title of his animation appears: Dances with Smurfs]
BUTTERS
Whoa... [this time Kyle is the one who has his head in his arms]
CARTMAN
The smurfs and I grew to understand each other. [Cartman is now dressed as a Smurf, but only his face is painted blue. He's harvesting berries with the Smurfs] They shared with me their art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country's forefathers. Of course, it wasn't long before ...I fell in love with Smurfette. [He and the diminutive Smurfette sit on a log watching the sun set] We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion.
KYLE
"These, are the morning announcements." [Butters shushes him and he buries his face in his arms again.]
CARTMAN
Papa Smurf was displeased at first, [Cartman tries to catch up to Smurfette as her father takes her into their mushroom house] He told Smurfette I wasn't a real Smurf and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland.
CARTMAN SMURF
No! No, you must leave the noble Smurfs alone! Who's behind all this?! [gasps at the sight of lots of bulldozers ready to raze Smurfland, and at their forewoman] I should have known. Wendy!
HUMAN WENDY
[just Cartman dressed as Wendy] Out of my way! [this Wendy has padding to make her appear to have breasts]
CARTMAN SMURF
Wendy, what are you doing here?!
HUMAN WENDY
Smurfberries are worth a lot of money. With all those Smurfberries I can power the school for the entire year.
CARTMAN SMURF
Wendy, I know you're president of our school, but you can't just dig up the Smurfs' land!
HUMAN WENDY
Fuck the Smurfs! They can suck my fat tits! [she climbs onto one of the bulldozers, Cartman stands in front of it]
CARTMAN SMURF
How many Smurfberries is enough, Wendy?!
HUMAN WENDY
You can suck my fat tits too! [steps on the gas and the bulldozer begins to move. She rolls over the land, mowing down trees, mushroom houses, and smurfs, killing them by the tens. Blood and guts splatter everywhere]
CARTMAN SMURF
Smurfette noooo!
HUMAN WENDY
Suck mah fat tits!
CARTMAN
And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You won't see any Smurfs! [Butters sobs] Of course, since I'm being silenced, I'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie. And so please buy Dances with Smurfs available now on DVD. [holds up the DVD case] The question now is, What happened to morals? What happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool?
[South Park Elementary hallway, later. Butters is pacing the ground before a group of Melvins.]
BUTTERS
That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!
A MELVIN
I can no longer stand idly by.
BUTTERS
We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger!
CASEY
It is time for that slutty Smurf-killing bitch to get what's comin' to 'er.
MELVINS
Yeah!
[Butters' house, after school. He's at the back patio talking to the Melvins over a megaphone. All of them are wearing shirts Cartman had made: "I ask questions!" with a picture of Cartman's head underneath.]
BUTTERS
I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it! [the Melvins cheer] So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done! [the Melvins cheer again, and follow him out the side gate and on to Wendy's house]
[Butters stops his posse outside Wendy's house, on the sidewalk.]
BUTTERS
Let us not forget what happens this day!
A MELVIN
Do it!
BUTTERS
We are here, Wendy Testaburger! [walks up to her front door, drops his pants and briefs, and pees on the front door.]
MELVIN 2
Take that, school president!
MELVIN 3
Get her good!
BUTTERS
I am.
WENDY
[opens her window] Hey, what are you doing?
BUTTERS
The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide!
MR. TESTABURGER
[opens the front door and looks down] What the hell? [Butters stops peeing and looks up]
BUTTERS
Wah! [turns and waddles down the steps without pulling his pants up, then across the front yard] Smurfkiller! [runs down the street with the other Melvins] Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements!
MR. TESTABURGER
Wendy, did a boy just pee on our door because the Smurfs were murdered? [Wendy plants her hands on her face, then removes them]
WENDY
It's okay Dad, I'll take care of it.
[The Principal's office, next morning. Wendy and Cartman are on Cartman's set as his make-up people prepare him for the Announcements. One of them is Esther. They frost the lower part of his hair to give him a distinguished elderly look.]
CARTMAN
Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy.
WENDY
Yeah, well, Butters peed on my house.
CARTMAN
People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning.
WENDY
If we could just keep it to questions about Student Council?
CARTMAN
Of course. That's why we're here.
A BOY
Five seconds. [the make-up people move out as Cartman stands up]
CARTMAN
Don't worry, I won't go too hard on you. [sits down and gets his notes ready as the chimes come in] Good morning South Park Elementary, these are the morning announcements. Rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon. For lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta. My guest today is the student body president of South Park Elementary, Wendy Testaburger. Wendy, thank you for coming on the show.
WENDY
Sure.
CARTMAN
Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it.
WENDY
Okay.
CARTMAN
How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth? [Wendy doesn't answer, and Cartman studies her reaction]
WENDY
I don't, I, I have no idea what-
CARTMAN
You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.
[The Audio Video Department room. Butters and the Melvins are watching the announcements there.]
BUTTERS
Ohhh, he's got her now!
[The Fourth Grade classroom. Kyle again has his face in his arms.]
CARTMAN
Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?
WENDY
I believe there is a ...few things wrong with the school, but-
CARTMAN
If a Smurf dies and no one is around to hear it, does it still scream? [Wendy doesn't answer]
[The Audio Video Department room.]
BUTTERS
She's speechless!
CARTMAN
You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting?
WENDY
Look, Eric, you have to understand. The Smurfberries were our school government's only option.
CARTMAN
Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what?
WENDY
What was I supposed to do? The school was running out of power. We tried relocating the Smurfs at first, but they wouldn't budge! So we decided to get somebody on the inside. A member of the school who could act like one of the Smurfs and learn their secrets. But of course you know that, don't you?
CARTMAN
What? What do you mean I know that?
WENDY
I'm just asking a question. We all knew you were sent in to live with the Smurfs, but did you know they would be wiped out?
CARTMAN
No! You wiped them all out!
WENDY
[gets off her chair and walks around a bit] Nobody expected you to fall in love with Smurfette. You went to learn from them, but instead you became one of them, right? Fought against your own kind when you knew we'd stop at nothing! Do you know that one Smurfberry can power the school for two months? One Smurfberry!
CARTMAN
Wait, hold on, can we take a break?
WENDY
No, it's okay! It's all out in the open now. I wouldn't have had to kill the Smurfs if they would have simply moved on. But you gave them the will to stay, and I guess... you can't be blamed for that.
[Mr. Garrison's classroom.]
STAN
What?!
[The Principal's office.]
WENDY
And that is why... I'm stepping down. You were right all along, Cartman. And I am hereby making you the student body president.
[The AV Department room.]
BUTTERS
All right! Cartman's president. We did it.
A MELVIN
I'm confused.
[The Principal's office.]
CARTMAN
Dude, you can't take my Dances with Smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing-
WENDY
No, you're right. The students all deserve to know the truth. And so I have answered what really happened in my new book, Going Rogue on the Smurfs.
CARTMAN
No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours!
WENDY
Luckily with the money I made selling the movie rights to my book, I'll be okay.
CARTMAN
You sold the movie rights to who?!
WENDY
James Cameron. Go look. The movie came out already.
CARTMAN
Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president!
[The Bijou. Playing there now is Avatar, James Cameron's latest movie. Cartman comes out of the 4:30 showing really pissed off.]
CARTMAN
[crossing the street] Oh God damn it! Son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes! [turns around and rants at the theater] You sons of bitches! Dances with Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA! [gives the theater two middle fingers three times] You can't just take Dances with Smurfs and call it something else! [gives the theater two middle fingers three more times]
[South Park Elementary, next morning. The fourth graders take their seats. Cartman comes in and takes his seat, still angry.]
CARTMAN
Huh!
STAN
Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?
CARTMAN
No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader!
KYLE
Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.
CARTMAN
I can't do jack! I went to my first student council meeting; all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance! Student council's retarded! [the chimes come on]
CASEY
The sun is up and the birds are chirping. I'm Casey Miller and these, are the morning announcements. I have a letter from second-grade student Brian Falner. Brian writes, "Dear Casey, why is our school president such a fat stupid dickhead? My desk is broken, and so far Eric Cartman has done nothing about it. Will you please let that walking bowl of anus pus know that we are not happy?" Well Brian, I couldn't agree more. Our asshole president is a fat smelly douchebag milkshake.
CARTMAN
I'm doin' the best I can! [begins to cry, leaves his desk, and runs out of the classroom bawling.]
End of Dances with Smurfs

[On the road, day. Cartman is singing. Jimmy looks over the back of the second row of seats in the station wagon.]
CARTMAN
We're going to the water park,
The water park, the water park!
We're going to the water park,
Me and all my best friends, except for Kyle who I don't like!
[Kyle flashes a look of anger at him]
STAN
[annoyed] Okay Cartman, you can stop singing now. [his father Randy is driving. The other boys present are Butters, Kenny, and Jimmy]
CARTMAN
This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year.
BUTTERS
What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.
CARTMAN
No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities.
JIMMY
W-What are you talking about, Eric?
CARTMAN
You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off.
STAN
We're here! It's the water park! [Randy pulls up at the front entrance and drops the boys off.]
[Pi Pi's Splashtown. The boys gather at the entrance.]
RANDY
I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at 4:00, you got it?
CARTMAN
Come on, let's go!
STAN
We got it, Dad.
[The ticket booth.]
CARTMAN
[hands the clerk some money] Six adorable children, please.
[Inside. Cartman runs in and through the interactive fountains.]
CARTMAN
Wave pool! Wave pool! Waaave pooool! [finally gets to the wave pool, but gets pissed off] Oh, what the hell?! [the pool is quite crowded with people of all races enjoying themselves. The other five boys catch up to Cartman]
KYLE
All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?
STAN
Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman?
CARTMAN
[with a stunned look on his face] Forget it! Just forget it! [walks off in anger. The other five are confused]
[Pi Pi's New York Splash. The boys tackle that attraction. Cartman isn't with them.]
STAN
Dude, this is awesome.
KYLE
You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?
BUTTERS
[stops] Hey fellers, fellas hang on! I've gotta go to the bathroom. [Kenny continues across the pool without the other boys]
KYLE
Okay, go ahead. [turns back to Stan and Jimmy]
BUTTERS
Okay, thanks. [goes to the bathroom right there, no stepping out of the pool or nothin']
KYLE
I can seriously hold my breath longer than anybody. Somebody time me, all right?
STAN
Okay.
KYLE
All right, [glances back at Butters] check it out, I- [looks back again and sees what happened.] Butters, BUTTERS! What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?!
BUTTERS
You said "go ahead".
STAN
Come on Kyle, let's check out the fireboats.
KYLE
No dude, Butters' pee is in there.
STAN
Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it.
BUTTERS
Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do.
KYLE
No they don't!
STAN
Yeah, they do, Kyle.
JIMMY
To be perfectly frank, I peed in the pool about tu-tu-twenty five seconds ago.
KYLE
Dude!
STAN
Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath.
KYLE
NO!
[In another part of the park, Cartman stands alone near a gazebo as people move past him this way and that. Montage, part 1: Cartman is now in the wave pool, then he wanders around the park, then he's singing at a signpost, then he's back near the wave pool, looking at the crowd in there, then he faces the camera, then he walks back to the park entrance, then tugs at a cop's shirt only to find that the copy is a member of a minority group, then he's back at the signpost, then he's at an artificial beach looking for a place to sit, then he's in line for Pele's Revenge, then he's annoyed and lazing about in an inner tube at the Lazy River, then he's waiting to enter the Lost River of the King Tut.]
CARTMAN
What has happened to this place?
I don’t recognize it anymore.
It used to be so fun and special.
What is life worth living for?
The dream is dead, our land is gone;
There’s a hole in my heart and I can’t go oooooon.

There are too many minorities (minorities)
At my water park (my water park).
This was our land, our dream (our dream),
and they’ve taken it all away.
They just keep coming and coming (minorities).
I tried to go and tell the police,
But even the authorities
Are minorities
At my water park.

There’s no place for me to sit anymore,
And the lines just keep getting crazier.
There are Mexicans all around me.
The lazy river has never been lazier.
It’s a 40 minute wait to go down one slide,
And the instructions are in Spanish on the Zip Line ride!
[At the Zip Line Ride. Cartman is waiting for the car he's in to start moving.]
RIDE OPERATOR
Guarden los brazos y piernas dentro del paseo-
CARTMAN
Just do it in English!
[Back to the montage. Cartman walks around some more, then he's back at the wave pool looking at it, then some colored lights in the background, then he's on bended knee on a bluff overlooking the park.]
CARTMAN
There are too many minorities (too many)
At my water park (somebody do something).
Where did they all come from?
Why can’t they leave this land alone?
And it’s such a tragedy (feel a bit like dying).
We looked the other way too long.
We’ve got to change our priorities
And get all these minorities
Out of my water park

(Minorities) Mexicans and Asians,
(Black people), I think I even saw a Native American (gross).
God I’m asking please, get all of these minorities
Out of my water park (my water park).
[Pi Pi's Snack Shack, later. The other five boys are eating hamburgers.]
STAN
After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?
BUTTERS
You bet!
KYLE
I'm not getting back in the water.
STAN
Aw come on, Kyle.
KYLE
Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?
STAN
Not everybody pees in pools.
KYLE
Do you pee in the pool?
STAN
Not today... yet.
KYLE
Aw, come on!
STAN
Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?
KYLE
Most likely.
CARTMAN
[running up to the boys] You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions!
STAN
Dude, where have you been?
CARTMAN
I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? And there are a hundred and ninety black people!
KYLE
So what?
CARTMAN
So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty-three! There are actually more minorities here than us!
KYLE
Well then they're not minorities, are they?
CARTMAN
...What do you mean?
KYLE
Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!
CARTMAN
The black and brown people.
KYLE
No, you're the minority!
CARTMAN
Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's a fifty percent rise in one, year!
STAN
This is more math than I've ever seen you do.
CARTMAN
Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this!
BUTTERS
The who?
CARTMAN
The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening!
STAN
I'm gonna go on the slides.
BUTTERS
Whoopie! [Stan, Butters, Jimmy, and Kenny take their leave]
CARTMAN
You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on! [only Kyle is left at the table, and Cartman remembers this and slowly turns to him] Well, looks like at least you've got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan's prediction from coming true, buddy?
KYLE
Blow it out your ass, Cartman! [leaves the table without taking a bite from his hamburger. He walks by an elderly couple in a pool]
WOMAN
Eugene, that is disgusting! Did you just pee in the pool?
EUGENE
Aw, come on, look how big this pool is. One person peeing in it isn't gonna hurt anything.
KYLE
Eewww! [walks away quickly. Nearby, a man takes a water sample]
WATER TESTER
Oh my God.
[The park's main office. The water tester and his assistant are at the office with Pi-Pi and a lawyer. Behind Pi-Pi is a picture window, and outside that is the Drop Zone!! attraction.]
PI-PI
Ah, gentlemen, I am da Pi-Pi. How can I help you?
ASSISTANT
Pi-Pi, we have some dire news concerning your water park.
WATER TESTER
I've just finished some tests. The water in your park is now 98% pee.
PI-PI
Yes, uhso whatsuh is the problem?
ASSISTANT
Pi-Pi, you know that acceptable pee levels in any water park is eighty-three percent. [with some urgency] You have to shut down.
PI-PI
What?! I can'tuh close down now, it'she my biggest-a weekend. Everyone is having a-theh fun.
WATER TESTER
You're endangering people's lives! [shows him the test results] If those pee levels hit a hundred percent, there's no telling what'll happen!
LAWYER
And what proof... do you have that the pee levels will go up?
WATER TESTER
One in three people admit they pee in pools. Add another for people who do but don't admit it; that's two in three. You've got just over five hundred people out there; that's three hundred and thirty two people about to pee in your water!
PI-PI
Gehntlemen, please-a. I come-a from ada Venice. [shows off a real life picture of a canal in Venice] Venice is almost all pee. And we doin' just fine. We swim-a in the pee, we sing-a in the pee. You can't barge in here and tell me thuh, that I have to close down just because my wahter park has-a too much pee.
WATER TESTER
You have to evacuate people now!
LAWYER
He said he's not doing it! And as his lawyer I advise you gentlemen to leave and take your wild pee theories with you!
WATER TESTER
[now at the door with his assistant about to leave] If one more person urinates in your pool, it could set off a chain reaction. Then the pee will be on your hands. [they leave]
[The wave pool, later. The water is now green.]
BUTTERS
Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!
STAN
This is sweet, huh Kenny? [Kenny, who's facing away from the camera, doesn't say anything. A girl in an inner tube floats past the boys, then stops and lets loose some pee. Sure enough, the ground begins to rumble and shake.]
JIMMY
W-What's that? [Explosions of pee come out of every ride, overrunning them all. A huge pee wave rises over the park and swamps it, destroying every structure. An unlucky slider is swept down in a rush of pee. A woman loses her baby as the wave strikes her back. The pee tsunami sweeps across the Mt. Everest attraction. A statue of a man scaling the mountain falls off]
WOMAN WHO LOSES BABY
(shrieks)
MAN 1
It's pee! [turns to run from it]
MAN 2
Look out for the pee! [Kyle, who's playing a Zombie Fighter video game, looks back to see what's all the commotion. The pee-nami hits the New York Splash attraction, mowing down its structures]
KYLE
Aaaaah! GROSS! [leaves the game and makes a run for it. A volcano blows up and chunks of lava drop all over the place. The wave pool gets unstable, threatening to throw people out with its wild waves]
PI-PI
[holding on to the sign post] Aaaaa, it's-a the peeee! [the signpost breaks off and both man and post are swept away by the pee. Stan, Butters, and Jimmy climb up the Mr. Everest sign]
FLOATING WOMAN
[swept away] Aaaah!
STAN
[in a shaky voice] Aaaah! [stops and looks at the pee, and sees a familiar boy floating in the water, face down] OH MY GOD, THEY KILLED KENNY!
KYLE
[running up some stairs in Drop Zone!!] Aw, sick! [the pee below him is rising]
[Pi Pi's Splashtown parking lot, some time later. Firefighters have arrived on the scene of the destroyed water park.]
FIRE MARSHAL
I want that entire water park contained and quarantined until I get some answers. [Randy quickly arrives in his station wagon and runs up to the captain]
RANDY
What's going on?
FIRE MARSHAL
I told you people to keep civilians back!
RANDY
Sir, please, my son is in there! What's happened?
FIRE MARSHAL
We don't know yet, all right?! There's been a pee breach and a lot of people are dead. Now I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to-
OFFICER 1
Captain, these two men claim to know the situation. [the water tester and his assistant walk into view]
WATER TESTER
We warned the owner of the park, but he refused to shut down. This was inevitable.
FIRE MARSHAL
So this is all pee-related?
WATER TESTER
Yes, I... tested the pH levels this morning.
FIRE MARSHAL
And?
WATER TESTER
It was almost all pee, no H.
RANDY
Oh my God. I've gotta help him! [starts to run to the gate, but the captain catches him and pulls him back.]
FIRE MARSHAL
Stay BACK!
RANDY
You can't just leave my son in there with all that pee!
OFFICER 2
Sir, it's possible with a crane we could help any survivors out.
WATER TESTER
I think that would be a very bad idea.
FIRE MARSHAL
And why is that?
WATER TESTER
Anyone inside there is contaminated. We have reason to believe that when people are exposed to that much pee, they... change.
FIREMAN 1
Change how?
WATER TESTER
All right uh brubring in, bring in the monkey. [a researcher wheels in a monkey who's been shackled to a dolly] We've only tested the theory on monkeys so far. This monkey is healthy and normal in every way, but now, watch. [unzips his pants and turns to face the monkey, then starts peeing on it. He first pees on the chest, no reaction. He moves the stream up to the monkey's face and the monkey begins to protest. The monkey tries to escape the pee stream, but the tester just keeps the stream on it as best he can.]
FIRE MARSHAL
My God! He's become full of rage!
[Back in the pee-filled water park, Jimmy, Butters, and Stan stand on the Mt. Everest attraction. Kyle is on what remains of the Drop Zone!! sign, but it moves a little, sinking a bit.]
KYLE
Aahhh...
STAN
[on a small plateau on the attraction] Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!
KYLE
No way!
JIMMY
You've gotta swim over here, Kyle.
BUTTERS
Come on, Kyle!
KYLE
Dude, that's all pee!
STAN
Well if you don't swim in it you're gonna die!
KYLE
I'll die if I do swim in it!
STAN
Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!
KYLE
Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!
STAN
[hesitantly] ...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom.
KYLE
..WHAT?
STAN
Come on, dude, you've gotta swim.
KYLE
You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!
STAN
Not... all the time.
KYLE
That is gross!!
STAN
Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!
BUTTERS
Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner! [the sign drops further into the yellow urine]
STAN
Kyle, come on!
KYLE
Ah, god-damnit! [climbs down the sign and into the pee. He holds his face high up as much as he can as he swims across] Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, [He climbs up and joins his friends on the plateau. He pants, dripping with pee]
BUTTERS
Do you need to wash your hands?
[The lake of pee. Cartman hangs on to a styrofoam ice chest.]
CARTMAN
Help! Help!
MAN 1
Here! Hey kid, grab this stick! [a branch hangs off a Floom Zoom boat]
CARTMAN
Yes! Yes help me! Yes, help me I'm just a little boy! You have to help me! [grabs onto the branch and is hoisted onto the boat. He catches his breath] Oh, oh, oh. [sits up and looks around - it's all minorities in the boat]
MAN 2
Are you okay?
CARTMAN
Haa-aa. Yes, thank you.
MAN 2
Well what are we gonna do now?
WOMAN 1
We've gotta just wait it out.
WOMAN 2
Yeah, but for how long?
MAN 3
We need to find somethin' to paddle with.
CARTMAN
[pulls out a memo pad and pen and writes the following] Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species alive. Now it's just me, all alone, with minorities. What will the minorities do with me? I'm sure that's what's on all of their minds. I have to make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live. [puts the pad and pen away somewhere...] Does anyone need medical help? I am a doctor. [the other survivors just look at him]
[The Marsh house. Sharon is on the phone in the living room while Shelly looks on from the kitchen doorway.]
SHARON
Randy, Randy, calm down. I can't understand what you're saying.
RANDY
It's the pee! It's all pee, and nobody can go in or out!
SHARON
What is all pee?
[Pi Pi's Splashtown parking lot.]
RANDY
Sharon, the water park had a pee meltdown! They think a lot of people have died.
SHARON
What?! What about Stan?! Is he okay?!
RANDY
I don't know! The whole water park has been quarantined! They're worried anyone left alive could be... sssome kind of raging, hate-filled mutants.
SHARON
Randy, you've got to do something!
RANDY
Calm down, Sharon, all right?! [shakes his head vigorously] Calm down! They're trying to find an antidote. Once they believe they can neutralize the enraging effects of the pee, they'll, they'll go in to look for survivors.
FIRE MARSHAL
[on the phone with someone] I said keep the media out! If the public hears about this we'll have a full-scale panic on our hands! [hangs up] Damn it where is that antidote?!
RESEARCHER 1
[with red hair] Here! Here! We think we have it, sir! [three researchers walk into view] It's the best we could come up with in such a short time! We aren't sure of the ramifications, but it does appear to neutralize some particles of the urine.
FIRE MARSHAL
All right, let's test it. Bring in the monkeys! [three monkeys are wheeled in on dollies]
WATER TESTER
Let's hope to Christ this works. [each researcher takes a monkey and injects it with the antidote. Then they start pissing on the monkeys, and the monkeys protest almost immediately] No, damn it, no!
FIRE MARSHAL
They're still angry.
RESEARCHER 1
This one's really angry.
FIRE MARSHAL
It's out of control! [quickly takes a gun from a police officer and shoots the middle monkey first, then the one on the left, then the one on the right. All of them die.] Find an antidote that works! [the researchers leave]
[Stan, Jimmy, Kyle, and Butters make their way down the Mt. Everest attraction as the pee recedes.]
KYLE
Dude, why the hell aren't people coming to help us?
STAN
I don't know. [they hear the sobs of a crying man nearby]
PI-PI
Why? Why didn't Pi-Pi leesten? They tried to warn-a the Pi-Pi, but-a the Pi-Pi not-a belieeve them. [sobs some more. The boys approach him]
STAN
Who are you?
PI-PI
[stands up and faces them] Oh I, I'm so sohhry. This all-eh my fault. I should've-a shut my water park-a down when it reached-a ninety percent-a pee.
KYLE
Yeah, well people should [looks at Stan and Butters] know that peeing in pools is [looks at Jimmy] bad!
PI-PI
But wait-a. Maybe you boys-a can help-a Pi-Pi. In-a the maintenance room-a there's the emergency release-a valve-a. If you open it, all this pee can be lowered.
JIMMY
Okay. W-where's the maintenance room?
PI-PI
That is-a the problem. The maintenance room is a way down on the basement-a level. I would do it but-a Pi-Pi is-a no good at-a swimming. Somebody will have to dive-a down into the pee, then stay there to turn the release-a wheel. So, who can hold their breath-a the longest? [Stan, Butters and Jimmy all look at Kyle, who looks back at them]
KYLE
[spreads his arms in refusal] NO!
BUTTERS
You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle.
KYLE
Not in pee!
PI-PI
[grabs Kyle by the left wrist and pulls him away from his friends] Please-a you have to hurry! [lets go] I'll draw you-a the map, and instructions how to shut off-a the valve-a. It'll be as easy as-a peeing in the shower.
KYLE
[looks back at the other boys] Oh who pees in the shower?!
STAN
...Well, it's not like if you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower.
BUTTERS
Well yeah, seeing all that running water always makes me need to pee.
KYLE
You don't pee in the shower, dude. That's fucking disgusting!
PI-PI
Boys-a please-a, we've got to get this-a boy to the drainage-a valve-a or we're all-a gonna die!
KYLE
Jesus Christ!
[Adrift in the Floom Zoom on Pi Pi Lake. Cartman whips out his memo pad and starts writing again.]
CARTMAN
It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking is "Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this minority-run world?" When the smoke has cleared I'm sure the minorities will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. Nooo... [imagines himself in class with a bunch of non-white students]
TEACHER
[A black man] All right, Eric Cartman, let's hear your book report.
CARTMAN
I read Treasure Island, because I was so happy when I saw that movie.
TEACHER
Hey! You're living in a minority-speaking country now! Say it right!
CARTMAN
...because I was so happy when I seen that movie.
TEACHER
Good.
CARTMAN
Noooo... [now imagines himself at a job interview] Trying to find a job will be even harder.
SEÑOR LOPEZ
You don't expect to make the same amount of money that minorities make, do ya?
CARTMAN
Well, I do just as much work.
SEÑOR LOPEZ
[laughs] You're trash around here. You'll never make as much as a minority.
CARTMAN
Noooo... [now imagines himself at an open council meeting] Eventually the minorities will do away with me altogether.
COUNCILMAN
All those in favor of putting white people in camps?
AUDIENCE
Aye!
COUNCILMAN
All those opposed?
CARTMAN
Noooo...
COUNCILMAN
The minorities win! [Cartman comes out of his daydream]
CARTMAN
[throws down his pad and pen and stands up] NO! No I don't wanna live in your world, do you understand?! Your world is cold and devoid of any humanity! Just kill me! Kill me now! DO IT! [turns away and squeezes his eyes shut.]
[The Mt. Everest attraction. Pi-Pi prepares Kyle for the descent to the basement. Kyle holds a piece of white paper and an index card.]
PI-PI
Okay, there. We are almost-a ready for the diving-a. Now if you run into any da problems you just tug-a three times on the cable and the Pi-Pi will-a pull you back-a to the surface.
KYLE
Let's just get this over with!
PI-PI
You've got-a the map and-a Pi-Pi's instructions?
KYLE
Yes.
PI-PI
Good-a. Now just one last thing. [takes a glass jar sitting next to him and scoops some pee into it] You need to drink-a some pee.
KYLE
What?!
PI-PI
You just need to drink about-a three cups of pee.
KYLE
Why?!
PI-PI
You swim-a down deep in the pee, you get-a the pressure, the bendza. You have to fill-a inside your body with some-a pee to compensate.
STAN
That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?
KYLE
[drops the papers on the ground] I am not, NOT, d-rinking pee!
PI-PI
But only you can hold-a the breath a long time, just swim down and-a release the valve! If-eh you don't you get-a the benza, then you fail and we all-a die!
STAN
Just drink the pee, Kyle.
BUTTERS
Please, Kyle, I wanna go home.
PI-PI
What's-a the problem? When-a you pee either in the toilet or in the shower it all goes to the sewer. The sewer all goes-a to the ocean, the ocean is the water we all drink, we are always drinking-a the pee!
KYLE
That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.
PI-PI
Sure you will, you drank only pee for nine months when you lived-a in your mother's belly.
KYLE
No!
[Pi Pi's Splashtown parking lot, afternoon.]
WATER TESTER
Make way! Make way! I need to speak to the fire marshal! Sir! Sir, I just got off the phone with my colleagues at the university! They've also been testing antidotes on monkeys! They're claiming that they've had success using simple Musa acuminata.
RESEARCHER 2
[balding, with gray hair] Wait, you mean a banana.
WATER TESTER
Yes.
FIRE MARSHAL
Is it possible... the antidote is something as simple as a banana? Get another monkey! [another monkey is brought forth strapped to a dolly] All right, Connors. [Officer connors offers a banana to the monkey, who takes a bite of it after a few seconds. A researcher steps up and starts peeing on the monkey. The monkey doesn't mind it, but just takes another bite of the banana.]
FIREMAN 2
Holy God, it works!
POLICE CAPTAIN
All right, let's start moving in, everyone! Check the-
WATER TESTER
Hold on, ih it is a promising lead, but this antidote hasn't yet been tested on a human.
RANDY
I'll do it. [the officers and firefighters make way for Randy.] You can test the antidote on me. [two researchers take Randy and sit him down in the dolly, then strap him in.]
FIRE MARSHAL
[walks up to Randy] You sure you want to do this?
RANDY
Give me the banana. [the balding researcher walks to him and gives him the banana. Randy takes a bite. The fire marshal unzips his pants and starts peeing on Randy's face.] Ugh. Awgh. Aaagh! Awwwwgh! Awwgh, wagh. [tries his best to keep his cool, but shakes his head] Aww, ooogh, Aaaaaaaah.
RESEARCHER 3
He looks agitated...
RANDY
Aaaaaahhh. Aw, awww.
FIRE MARSHAL
He's losin' it! Stevens, your gun! [Stevens moves to hand his gun to the fire marshal]
RANDY
No, wait, wait! Ugh. Eugh. I... I'm okay.
WATER TESTER
He's all right!
FIREMAN 3
The banana worked!
[The Mt. Everest attraction. Kyle is still up top holding the glass of pee, not daring to drink it.]
STAN
Come on, dude!
KYLE
I'm thinking about it!
JIMMY
Well it's probably bu-better if you don't think about it, Kyle.
PI-PI
There's no more time-a. You have to drink-a the pee NOW! [Kyle begins to drink it, then stops]
KYLE
Gah, ah. [swallows once more] Gaagh.
PI-PI
Come on, you have to drink aaall-a the peeeee.
BUTTERS
You can do it, Kyle!
KYLE
Aaahh. Well- [gulps down the rest of the glass and throws the glass away] AAAAH! [the glass breaks on a boulder off screen]
PI-PI
All right, now you can open the release-a valve. Okay, so let's-a- [some helicopters are heard approaching]
BUTTERS
[points to them] Hey look! [the helicopters are shown. Randy looks out from one of them]
RANDY
[waving a small red shoe] Stan! [steps aside so the firefighters can drop down a rope ladder]
STAN
All right, they finally came for us. [he, Butters and Jimmy have wide smiles]
KYLE
[pissed off] ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! [more rope ladders drop down from the other helicopters as the rescuers cheer]
[Pi Pi's Splashtown parking lot, afternoon. Paramedics check out the survivors. The camera pans right to show Randy walking with Kyle, Stan, Jimmy, and Butters.]
RANDY
[stops] Wait here a minute, Stan, I'm gonna call your mother. [walks away]
CARTMAN
Guys? Guys! [walks into view and hugs Stan] Oh it's true! You all did survive!
BUTTERS
Hawww, you lived?
CARTMAN
Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! How many of our species survived?
KYLE
That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot.
CARTMAN
It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!
KYLE
Will somebody just get me to a hospital? I need to get my stomach pumped!
STAN
Aw come on. It was just a little pee, Kyle.
KYLE
Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas!
WATER TESTER
All right everyone, quick! Here you go!
BUTTERS
What's this?
FIRE MARSHAL
You all need to eat your banana immediately!
KYLE
What the hell for?!
STEVENS
[cocks his gun and aims at Kyle] Eat the banana or we have to put you down!
KYLE
[frustrated] AAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHH!
End of Pee
