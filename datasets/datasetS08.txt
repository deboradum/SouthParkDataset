synopsis:The boys are transformed into Japanese Warriors after they trick a vendor and buy martial arts weapons at a local flea market.

script:Good Times with Weapons

[Park County Fair, day. South Park is more spread out these days. Looking like a small city now. People mill around. The boys walk along a fairway. Cartman pulls out a small firecracker and tosses it on the ground before Kyle and cackles softlyv]
KYLE
[stops so he doesn't get hurt and glares] Stop it, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Pfaha, so funny. [pulls out another firecracker, tosses it before Kyle, and cackles]
KYLE
[stops] Goddammit Cartman, stop throwin' those stupid poppy-things at me! [Cartman cackles some more. The boys approach a booth: Roger's Edge]
ROGER
Come on and take a look, folks. We've got a lot of knives for sale here. [Stan stops before a table, "Weapons of Asia," and marvels at the weapons displayed there.]
STAN
Oh my God, look! [the other boys turn and walk up] Martial arts weapons from the Far East. [the sign reads "Martial arts weapons of the Far East"]
KYLE
[softly] Wow, cool.
STAN
Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas.
CARTMAN
Yeah. We won't have to take crap from anybody.
KYLE
[turns away] Our parents won't let us have weapons, dude. [the others turn as well]
CARTMAN
Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?!
STAN
Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought. [the boys turn back to face the table] I'll get the tonfas. [they look like the nightsticks police use, but made of wood] Those are so sweet.
CARTMAN
I'm gonna get those killer sai. [swords with horns at the hilt are in there. Cartman notices a weapon off to the right] Look Kenny! There's something even you can afford! A ninja shuriken [ninja star] for a dollar ninety nine.
KENNY
(Shuriken. Awesome!)
ROGER
[approaches] Can I help you boys? [the boys step back from the table to see him.]
STAN
Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons.
ROGER
Okay, uh, you need to have your parents here when you buy them, though. I, I can't sell to anyone under eighteen without parents' permission. [the boys look at each other]
CARTMAN
Parents? Parents?! [fakes a cry] Oh God! [starts crying loudly and turns away.]
ROGER
Wha- wha- what's the matter? [Cartman continues crying]
STAN
We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year.
CARTMAN
Why?! [Stan begins to play along, then covers his eyes sobbing. Cartman turns around, still crying] Why?! Why did you have to take them both?! Why?! [Kenny joins in bawling, and he tightens his hood with the strings] Why?! [Kyle observes his friends, then joins them in the crying]
KYLE
Why do people have to keep reminding us of what we don't have?!
ROGER
[tries to soothe them] It's all right, it's all right boys. Don't cry, I'll... I'll just... go pack these up for you, okay? [takes a few weapons and leaves. The boys fake-cry a bit more, then stop]
STAN
Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked.
[Cartman's house, moments later. The boys are in his basement mastering their new weapons. Each boy gets the weapon he wanted. Kyle gets the yellow-ended nunchucks]
STAN
[with his tonfa] Kiya! Kiya!
KYLE
Kaii yo! [one end of his nunchaku hits his hat a few times]
CARTMAN
Giya! Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you! [lunges] Iya!
STAN
[sweeps one of his tonfa around and transforms] With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Shadowhachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like.
KYLE
Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus make me into Bunroku [he transforms], a deadly but compassionate ninja who protects those in trouble.
STAN
What's your ninja name, Kenny?
KENNY
[already transformed] (unintelligible)
CARTMAN
[already transformed] Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute ninja who has dedicated his life to eradicating the world of hippies.
STAN
All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world!
CARTMAN
Kick ass! [the boys head out]
[Outside, the neighborhood. The boys walk out onto a new, more-detailed landscape]
CARTMAN
Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous.
KENNY
(Yeah, that'd be awesome!)
KYLE
[cautions] No dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people. Our parents'll find out we have them.
CARTMAN
Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine!
KYLE
[the background is a motion blur] You don't know anything about Jews, fatass!
CARTMAN
Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says you are sneaks and you are liars. And if the Road Warrior says it, it must be true.
STAN
Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go. [they walk off and approach Craig's house, which is done up in Japanese style. Stan stops and whispers] All right, this is it.
CARTMAN
Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig. [the boys approach quickly]
KYLE
I still say this is a bad idea.
[Craig's house. Stan pounds on the door]
STAN
Ninja positions! [the boys get into their first positions and Craig opens the door] Hello, Craig!
CARTMAN
[shows off his sai] Look what we got.
CRAIG
Where'd you get those?
STAN
We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff.
CARTMAN
[moves past Stan] Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy.
CRAIG
Uh-uh, they're not that cool.
STAN
Hyeah, "they're not that cool." These are real authentic weapons from the Far East.
KYLE
But don't tell anybody we have them.
CARTMAN
Ugh.
TOLKIEN
[appears with Clyde, behind Craig] Whoa! Where'd you get those?!
CLYDE
Let me see.
STAN
Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do. [turns and walks away]
CARTMAN
Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril. [he and the other two turn and walk away as well] Come on, ninjas!
ALL
Ho! [they trot off. Craig closes the door]
[On the road]
CARTMAN
Aw man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome!
STAN
Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state! [Butters shows up before them]
BUTTERS
Hey fellas. What's happenin'?
CARTMAN
We're playing Ninjas, Butters.
BUTTERS
Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you?
CARTMAN
No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us.
STAN
Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys. [the boys turn and walk off] We have a lot of work to do.
CARTMAN
Yes, and no time to do it. No time... [Butters stands in the open alone]
BUTTERS
I think I'd make a really good ninja. [turns right and walks off towards home, rejected] Jeez, those guys never let me play with them. Uh, they just shun me all the time. [opens the front door and enters]
[Butter's house. He walks past behind the couch, where his mom reads a book unaware of the emotion in his voice]
BUTTERS
I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person-
LINDA
Hi Butters.
BUTTERS
Hi Mom. [walks upstairs] -a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude. [enters his room and heads for the closet] And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil. [enters the closet] Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive super-villain of all time! [one swoosh of his cape and he transforms] Professor Chaos! [he holds his hands some distance apart and a ball of energy appears. This electrifies his whole body] Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas! [cackles. Now transformed, he makes his way downstairs. The stairs crack under his weight. He smashes his left fist into the wall, leaving a small crater in it. His mom looks on from the couch]
LINDA
Ooo, Butters, are you going out to play again?
BUTTERS
[in a gravelly voice] Yeah Mom, I'm just goin' outside for a little while.
LINDA
Well, could you be a sweetie and take that pie over there to the Thomsons. I made it to thank them for babysitting you last week.
BUTTERS
Well, o- okay Mom. [sees the pie on the small end table by the foot of the stairs and carries it off] Bah! Gah! [in his mind, he's big and powerful. Every step he takes affects the house. The first dislodges the family portrait, the second dislodges it more, the third knocks it to the ground. He opens the front door, goes out and slams it shot, knocking it off its hinges]
[On the road. The boys are shown in their anime forms]
STAN
Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction.
KYLE
Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next.
CARTMAN
Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it.
KYLE
God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!
STAN
Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!
CARTMAN
I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.
KYLE
No asshole! From now on you only get to have one power! So what is it?!
CARTMAN
I have the power to have all the powers I want.
KYLE
That doesn't count, fatass!
STAN
Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have any powers!
CARTMAN
[protests] C'mon!
BUTTERS
Haaa ha ha ha ha! [he appears with energy bristling all around him] Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas!
KYLE
Who the hell is that?
STAN
I dunno. Craig, is that you?
BUTTERS
[strikes a ground pose] Fools! [jumps into the air and more energy surges from him. A fireball appears between his hands] I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of Destruction and Doom! [closeup] Your feeble ninja powers are no match for me!
KYLE
Whoa.
CARTMAN
Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys.
KENNY
(Yeah.)
STAN
[steps forth] Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along. Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa of Takanawa! [Stan strikes a battle pose and unleashes the energy from the tonfa tips. Butters shields himself with his cape, and the tonfa energy dissipates. Butters cackles] Hey kid, that knocks you down.
BUTTERS
Nuh uh!
STAN
Yeah, huh, I got you!
BUTTERS
Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat!
CARTMAN
That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass!
KYLE
Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchucks of Sokuromoto! [whips them around a few times and unleashes an icy stream of energy towards Butters. The blasts knock Butters out of the air and he hits the ground with a thud.]
BUTTERS
Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding! [leaps up into the air and jumps back down, strikes the ground with his right fist, and the ground cracks towards the boys, ending with them being tossed into the air. The boys land on the ground again and look up at Butters] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! You are both trapped in spiderwebs! [two spiderwebs drop down and trap Stan and Kyle]
CARTMAN
All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay! [Cartman attempts to unleash energy with his hands, but nothing happens.] Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain!
KYLE
Okay, okay, you can have your powers back.
CARTMAN
All right! And now I will use my power to... [faces the other boys] turn Kyle into a chicken! Bleh! [in an instant Kyle becomes a chicken]
KYLE
God dammit Cartman!
CARTMAN
Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!
BUTTERS
Enough! I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped!
STAN
Oh yeah?! Kenny! Use your ninja star!
KENNY
(Yeah! Take this, Professor Chaos!) [shows off an eight-pointed shuriken] (Feel my wrath!) [unleashes the shuriken, and it strikes Butters in the eye. Butters' helmet flies off, revealing his puff-ball hair and the shuriken embedded in the bloody left eye. The music abruptly stops and the boys are shown in regular form. Butters looks at the boys, screams loudly, and begins to cry]
CARTMAN
Oh, shit, dude!
STAN
[he and Kyle rush over to Butters] Butters! Oh my God! [the boys gather around Butters] Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!
KYLE
What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?!
KENNY
(I just threw my ninja star at him.)
BUTTERS
It hurts! It hurts! [continues to cry]
KYLE
Oh man! We are in serious trouble!
STAN
[tries to soothe Butters] Sh shhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really.
BUTTERS
[trying to catch his breath] But I... But I... But I can't see nothin'. I gotta go to the hospital! [Butters continues to shriek in agonizing pain while Stan looks around nervously, with gritted teeth]
STAN
Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay! [Butters composes himself and cries softly, looking around from time to time for any sign of help]
CARTMAN
Guys, meeting over here for a second? [the boys move off and huddle] All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard.
STAN
Dude, shut up!
KYLE
I agree with Cartman!
STAN
What?!
KYLE
You don't understand what my mom will do to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons!
[a closeup of the shuriken lodged in Butters' left eye, moments later. Some pliers clamp on to it and the camera pulls back. Stan is holding the pliers and he tugs gently at the shuriken. Butters sits on a tree stump]
STAN
Just stay still, Butters.
BUTTERS
[Stan tugs again] Ah. [Stan tugs harder] Hwa! [Stan tugs even harder] Hwaaaaa!
KYLE
Stop dude! You're gonna scramble his brain!
CARTMAN
Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.
BUTTERS
You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have to take me to the hospital! [whimpers]
KYLE
If we take him to the hospital, they're gonna find out what happened.
STAN
God dammit!
KYLE
[moves off] God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again.
CARTMAN
[approaches] Don't be so quick to throw off your ninja responsibility, Kyle. [to the huddle] Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character.
BUTTERS
Whoa, I'm getting woozy.
CARTMAN
Shut up, Butters. [to the other boys] Now, there's a way out of this. We just have to use our... ninja reasoning. [puts his fingertips to his temples. Kenny touches his right temple, Stan, his chin]
STAN
We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian?
CARTMAN
Dr. Shafley?
STAN
He's really old and going blind.
CARTMAN
So if we make Butters up to look like a dog...
KYLE
Oh no.
STAN
We might pass him off as our pet.
BUTTERS
[sniffling] But, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog with a star in my eye, I- I'm gonna get grounded.
STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
Shut up, Butters!
KYLE
That is the dumbest idea you guys have ever come up with! I'd expect this stupidity out of Cartman, but you, Stan?! Butters needs medical attention right now!
STAN
All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened.
[Moments later. Butters is made up to look like a dog. He sobs in resignation. Kyle holds a bottle of glue.]
CARTMAN
Hand me the modeling glue. We need more fur over here. [Kyle hands him the glue]
BUTTERS
[between whimpers] Uh, that modeling glue is making me dizzy.
CARTMAN
Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole!
KYLE
We need some more fur. [Stan walks over to Sparky and shaves off fur from areas of his body still unshaved, then walks back to Kyle and hands him the fur. Kyle places the fur on Butters' left leg] I think that's good.
CARTMAN
Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters.
BUTTERS
Uh. Wuff, wu-wuff.
STAN
All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town.
[South Park, in what looks like Skid Row. Stan appears and walks into a clearing]
STAN
[looks off to his left] Okay, it's clear. [turns right and walks on. Cartman and Kyle escort Butters between them]
CARTMAN
Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot.
BUTTERS
[practices his bark unprompted] Wuhuff, woof, woof.
KYLE
We've gotta hurry, it's getting late! [some trash bin noises are heard and the boys face the source of the noises]
STAN
Oh shit, somebody's coming!
KYLE
Quick, hide Butters! [Cartman drags Butters to an oven]
CARTMAN
In here! [opens its door and shoves Butters in]
BUTTERS
bu- but fellas, I gotta- [Cartman closes the door. Craig and his boys appear]
CRAIG
Aha! [the three remaining boys quickly face Craig's crew] There you are! You guys thought you were so cool, didn't you?! Well look at what we got! [Craig and his boys present their weapons]
CARTMAN
No way, you got weapons too?!
STAN
Where'd you get those?
JIMMY
From the n-n- from the nn-, from the nn-
CLYDE
From the nice guy at the county fair.
CRAIG
At first we needed our parents' permission, but then we told him our parents were dead.
CARTMAN
Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!
CRAIG
So, [unsheathes his sword] how would you ninjas like to do battle?
STAN
Uh, not now, Craig, we we have to be going.
CRAIG
You can't pass through this area until you defend your honor! [Clyde crosses his kamas against each other]
KYLE
He said, not now, Craig!
CRAIG
I am not Craig, [twirls his sword] I am Ginza, [transforms] with the powerful blade of the kitana. Iya!
TOLKIEN
And I am Black Chaku, [twirls his nunchakus and transforms] with the power of perfect spelling!
STAN
Guys, we're we're really not playing, okay? [Jimmy has already transformed and leaps into the air, twirling his kali sticks around, and lands in a powerful pose]
JIMMY
Wha, what, what's the m-matter, f-fellas? Are you ... nnnninjas or p-p-p-pussies?
CARTMAN
[the boys are back in anime form] We're twice the ninjas you fags are!
CLYDE
Then fight us!
CARTMAN
Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa!
KYLE
I swore to never fight again.
STAN
We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor them. Hyaaaaah! [He begins his attack. The other boys move forth and the fight begins, as a song reminiscent of Japanese anime theme songs, mostly Japanese with occasional English words, starts playing; its lyrics appear as a sing-along along the bottom of the screen.]
SINGER
Subarashii chinchin mono
Kintama no kame aru
Sore no oto ha "saru bobo"
Iie! Ninja ga imasu
Hey Hey Let's Go! kenka suru
Taisetsu no mono protect my balls
Boku ga warui so let's fighting
Let's fighting love...
Let's fighting love...
Kono uta chotto baka
Wake ga wakaranai
Eigo ga mechakucha
Daijobu? We do it all the time!
Hey hey let's go kenka suru...
[The fight as the song progresses: Jimmy twirls his kali sticks around and aims them at Stan, unleashing two beams of energy. Stan blocks them with his tonfa. Kenny watches Craig be tossed through the air. Tolkien sweeps his nunchucks around and unleashes energy towards Kenny, who jumps clear and lets Cartman take the blow. Cartman shatters it with his sai swords. The nunchucks sweep back. Kenny falls to the ground on his ass, behind Cartman. Tolkien attacks Cartman with his nunchucks, but Cartman counters them with his sais, sending Tolkien flying back a few yards. Tolkien rubs his right shoulder. Clyde whips out his kamas and whips them around, and Kyle responds by whipping his nunchucks around. Clyde focuses on Kyle and unleashes a large amount of energy from his kamas. Craig and his crew are shown, then Craig and Kenny fly at each other. Stan takes a stand. Two silhouettes fight. A car rolls by the scene slowly, and the driver simply observes. He sees them are they are, then drives off. The scene reverts to anime letterbox and the boys continue fighting]
STAN
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait! [the song ends, and he looks around] Wait. [steps forward] Hold on a second. Where's Butters? [sees the open oven door, and no one in the oven]
KYLE
Oh no. Butters!
CARTMAN
Butters!
STAN
[turns and faces Craig's boys] Oh, nice going, you assholes! You made us lose him!
CRAIG
Lose who?
KYLE
[approaches Craig] Butters! He got a ninja star stuck in his eye, and we were taking him to the vet when you fucked it all up! Butters!
CRAIG
Stuck in his eye? Was he bleeding?
CARTMAN
Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back here right now!
CRAIG
Oh shit, you guys are in trouble. We're outta here!
STAN
No dude, you gotta help us find him!
CRAIG
To hell with that!
CARTMAN
We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code!
[The road, sunset. Butters walks along the side still sobbing, looking for help]
BUTTERS
Hello? Anybody-eh. [the driver appears again and slows down to observe Butters. His right eyebrow rises] Woof. Woof. Woofwoof. [his voice softens] Eh. Woof, eh. Woof. [the drives speeds up and drives off. Butters turns and continues his lonely walk. Back near Skid Row the eight boys walk along searching for Butters.]
STAN
Butters!
KYLE
Butters!
CARTMAN
Here, Butters!
KENNY
(Butters!)
CRAIG
Butters!
CLYDE
Butters!
TOLKIEN
Butters!
JIMMY
Bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- Butters!
CARTMAN
Butter- Butters!
KYLE
Hey Butters!
STAN
Butters!
KYLE
Dude, look! [a black man walks up in anime form, stops, and looks around]
CHEF
Hello there, children!
THE BOYS
Hey, Chef.
CHEF
How's it goin'?
STAN
Bad.
CHEF
Why bad?
KYLE
Uuuh, Chef, you haven't seen Butters around, have you?
CHEF
No, can't say that I have. Hey, what are you children doin' with those weapons?
STAN
Nothing, just... playing.
CHEF
Well, you children should be careful with those. You could put somebody's eye out.
KYLE
Yeah, we know.
CHEF
Well, I've gotta get to the fairgrounds. They're about to start the big auction. So long, children! [turns and walks away]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Butters closes in on it, babbling incoherently and stumbling along. He enters the emergency area, moves in a few feet, and falls flat on his back]
NURSE
[behind the counter] Oh my God! [leaves her station and kneels down next to Butters] What the-?! Doctor? Doctor?!
DR. DOCTOR
[approaches and kneels down next to Butters] Jesus Christ. [Butters shakes his head and babbles] What kind of sick bastard would do this to a dog?! Poor little pup.
BUTTERS
[moans, then opens his eyes] Woof woof.
NURSE
Can you help him, Doctor?
DR. DOCTOR
I'm afraid I wouldn't know how. Unfortunately for this little fella, I'm a people doctor. Best we call the animal shelter.
NURSE
[rises and leaves] Right away.
ANNOUNCER
[with recaps from the episode] In our last episode the four ninjas did battle with Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and doom. It was during that great battle that ninja master Kenny threw his star into Professor Chaos' eye. Now the ninjas were in serious trouble, because their parents might find out they had weapons, if Professor Chaos told on them. While trying to get Professor Chaos some aid at the veterinarian's office, the four ninjas ran into Craig and his three friends. They challenged the four ninjas to fight, and the legendary battle of Tokutawa began. It was during this battle that Professor Chaos escaped, and so the four ninjas were forced to join forces with Craig and his friends to find Professor Chaos, or else they would all be grounded.
STAN
Butters!
KYLE
Butters!
CARTMAN
Here, Butters!
KENNY
(Butters!)
CRAIG
Butters!
CLYDE
Butters!
TOLKIEN
Butters!
CRAIG
Butters! Where the hell are you?!
KYLE
It's hopeless, dude! Butters must have made it to the hospital. By now our parents probably know we were playing with weapons! We have to get rid of the evidence! [moves off]
STAN
What?
KYLE
[reaches a well and holds his nunchucks over it] Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything.
CARTMAN
[with his sais] Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things!
STAN
Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back.
KYLE
We don't have time for that, dude! We just have to ditch them! Now!
CARTMAN
Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try.
KYLE
Screw you, fatass! [struggles to loosen his grip on the nunchucks]
CARTMAN
Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screaming "NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!" You know this to be true. [Kyle continues struggling and begins to grunt] Go ahead. Prove Mel Gibson wrong, Kyle. [closeup of Cartman's lips] Do it. [Kyle struggles even harder, but eventually gives in]
KYLE
[walks up next to Stan] I- I can't do it... I can't do it. I...
STAN
It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them.
[South Park Animal Shelter, day. Dogs and cats are heard. Inside, an elderly veterinarian pulls something along on a leash]
VET
Come on. Come on, little fella. 'Atta boy. [Butters appears at the other end of the leash, crawling in]
BUTTERS
[in a gravelly voice] Woof woof. [babbles incoherently. The veterinarian leads him towards a cell]
VET
Right over here. [opens the gate] Good dog. Come on. [guides Butters in] There you go, right in there. [closes the gate and locks it, then leaves] Goooood dog. [Butters babbles some more as a dog approaches from his left and sniffs. The dog pisses on him and walks away. Butters' voice rises in protest. Another dog approaches from his right, sniffs him, and pisses on him. Butters' voice rises a bit more in protest. A third dog approaches from his left, turns around, and craps on him. Butters stands up]
BUTTERS
Gaaaah!
ASSISTANT
Somebody threw a ninja star in that poor puppy's eye?
VET
It just makes me sick how some people can treat animals. [pulls out a large syringe, quickly] Well, nothing we can do for it; let's put it to sleep, shall we? [they move back into Butters' cell] Here you go, pup. I've got a sweet dose of murder for you. [He leaves, giving Butters the chance to escape. The vet returns with a syringe.] What the? Blasted! He's escaped! ...Oh well, let's murder one of these other dogs.
[The county fair, anime form, sunset]
STAN
All right, the county fair's still open! [they spot Roger, shown in anime form, and approach his booth.]
ROGER
Can I help you boys?
STAN
We have come to return the weapons we purchased.
ROGER
Uh, sorry kids, ah I don't give refunds.
KYLE
Listen, doucher! Our parents are gonna kill us, and you, if they found out that we bought these!
ROGER
I thought you told me your parents were dead.
CRAIG
[approaches with his boys] You guys! [the other boys turn around] You guys!
STAN
What is it, Craig?
CRAIG
It's Butters! We saw 'im!
KYLE
Where?!
CRAIG
Right on the other side of the fairgrounds. He's just wandering around aimlessly.
KYLE
Then it's not too late!
STAN
Come on, Ninjas! [the boys make their way across the fairgrounds, but freeze in their tracks upon seeing the auction]
BARKER
[in anime form] All right, folks, our next item up for bids is this lovely 19th Century lamp.
STAN
Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there.
CRAIG
Butters is right on the other side.
KYLE
We have to get past them!
CARTMAN
All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by.
KYLE
You have that power too?
CARTMAN
I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold. [steps aside and holds his arms up. He sweeps them down and disappears. He them removes his clothes and gathers them into a pile] This way, I can move about the crowd of people undetected. [walks over to Stan and hands his clothes over] Here, hold this stuff for me.
STAN
[softly] Good luck, Bulrog. [Cartman leaves, with only his footsteps indicating where he's going]
BARKER
Now, this lamp comes from the estate of Edna and James Hollinger, who lived in upstate Wyoming. [Cartman, in normal form, appears, tip-toeing across the stage sideways. His penis can be seen.] It has a bronze finish and actual gold leaf along the base. This is a rare opportunity to own a classic antique. [Cartman changes his gait and tip-toes forward. The bidders look on] The lamp has been appraised by our auction staff at well over two thousand dollars. [Cartman changes his gait and tip-toes along sideways. One of the staffers notices Cartman and taps his colleague. The colleague looks and gasps] So we're gonna start the bidding at three hundred and seventy five. Do I, do I hear three hundred and seventy five? [Cartman continues tip-toeing along and the bidders sit motionless. Eight seconds pass before Cartman stops, realizing that the crowd can indeed see him.] Kid, what the hell do you think you're doin'? [Cartman looks around, knowing he's stuck.]
BUTTERS
[wanders on stage] Haba, haba! Habahoaha! [babbles some more, then falls flat on his back again]
LINDA
[rises with her hands on her chest] Butters! [the auction staff encircles the boy]
RANDY
What happened to him?
SHEILA
Oh my God!
STAN
Oh, Jesus.
KYLE
Oh dude, we are gonna get it now.
[Park County Community Center, Emergency Town Meeting, day. The chatter among the adults present is heated]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
All right, people, we are all extremely upset over what's happened. [the boys' parents are present, with angry faces on] But let's try to speak one at a time.
MAN 1
Well, like the rest of you, I am shocked and appalled at what happened! I don't know if the parents are to blame or if it's the times we're living in, but something has to change!
TOWNSFOLK
[amid chatter] Yeah! I agree!
GERALD
This is the worst thing that's happened in this town! [Butters is shown with a patch over his left eye and a long gauze wrapped around his head to keep the patch in place] The worst thing!
MAN 2
Yeah! I mean, there were children watching that auction! And when that little eight-year-old boy walked up and flashed his... penis! It was an outrage! [the adults go into an uproar again]
STAN
What?
CARTMAN
What?
SKEETER
Not only that, the auction was televised on public access, so my little daughter watchin' at home saw the... penis! How am I supposed to explain that to her?!
SHEILA
This is what happens when the moral fabric of society breaks down! [the adults go into an uproar again]
MR. GARRISON
[next to Mr. Mackey] You see the damage you've caused, Eric Cartman?! What were you thinking?!
CARTMAN
I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction. [the adults go into an uproar again]
KYLE
Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' eye out with weapons?
STAN
Just run with it, dude.
KYLE
[looks around, then stands on his chair] Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh- my fragile little eight-year-old mind didn't know how to deal with what I was seeing. C-Cartman should be punished!
MAN
Yeah! [the adults go into an uproar again]
CARTMAN
Hey, fuck you, Kyle!
[Park County Community Center, outside. The doors open and Stan, Kyle, and Kenny exit onto the parking lot]
KYLE
Yeah, I c- I can't believe it.
STAN
Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about.
KYLE
[pulls out his nunchucks] So I guess this means we get to keep our weapons.
STAN
[he and Kenny pull out their weapons] Yeah. Come on, ninjas. [they transform into their anime forms] We've got some more work to do.
THE BOYS
[leap into a pose, and the image is frozen] Hya!
[End of Good Times with Weapons. Stills of the episode are shown along with "Let's Fighting Love"]
End of Good Times with Weapons


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Cartman plans to learn all of Butters' innermost secrets and then use them against him, by pretending to be Butters' new best friend, a robot named AWESOM-O.

script:AWESOM-O

[Butters' house, day. Butters is in the living room eating some soup. The doorbell rings. Butters stops and looks at the door. He rises and opens it, and sees a large wooden crate waiting on the porch.]
BUTTERS
What the heck?
[Butters steps outside to look for the address label.]
BUTTERS
Whoa! What a huge package! [finds it, the shipping label reads]
BUTTERS
To Butters Stotch. Oh boy! It's for me! It's for me! [returns to the crate's label]
BUTTERS
Who is it from? "Sent from: Japan. Konichi-wa." [skips around] Wow! A package for me from Japan!!+
[Butters pushes the crate into the house.]
BUTTERS
Wow, what can it be? My birthday isn't until September 11.
[Butters skips around and runs into the house. He returns with a small crowbar.]
BUTTERS
Oh boy! I've never gotten a package this big! I've always wanted to have a huge package.
[Butters tugs at the panel he loosened. The panel swings down and Butters flies off. He lays on his back and looks up. A large A.W.E.S.O.M.- O., wide enough to resemble Cartman, walks out of the crate.]
CARTMAN
[monotone] Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000.
BUTTERS
[dazzled] Whoa...
CARTMAN
I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot.
BUTTERS
[approaches AWESOM-O] You... you're my robot?
CARTMAN
Yes. I will be your new best friend.
BUTTERS
Oh wow!
[Moments later, Butters has Cartman sitting on his bed. Butters goes to his desk and makes a few calls.]
BUTTERS
Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already.
[Cartman snickers to himself]
BUTTERS
Well I gotta go, Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do.
[Butters hangs up, takes the phone back to his bedside table and sets the phone down.]
BUTTERS
Heheh, they're all so jealous! [He hops onto the bed next to Cartman.] I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best friend a guy could have.
CARTMAN
Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.
BUTTERS
Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh? [strokes his chin] Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a hesitated colon, which means I sometimes can't control my sphincter.
CARTMAN
[snickers] Really?
BUTTERS
Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school. [Cartman begins to chuckle] You okay, AWESOM-O?
CARTMAN
Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.
BUTTERS
Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum.
CARTMAN
[laughs] That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets.
BUTTERS
Hm, okay. Let's see [strokes his chin] Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff.
CARTMAN
Oh, really?
BUTTERS
Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days.
CARTMAN
Heh. Wow, that sucks.
BUTTERS
Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me.
CARTMAN
Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.
BUTTERS
No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play a trick on me ever again! [hops off and walks towards his desk.]
CARTMAN
Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you.
BUTTERS
Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!
CARTMAN
What?
BUTTERS
When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake.
CARTMAN
You saw that?
BUTTERS
Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it!
CARTMAN
Nuh uh.
BUTTERS
I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!
CARTMAN
No way.
BUTTERS
Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll have my revenge, boy howdy!
CARTMAN
[beat] ...Um, where is this videotape, Butters?
BUTTERS
Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?
CARTMAN
Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape?
BUTTERS
How come?
CARTMAN
Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.
BUTTERS
Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you. [leaves the room]
CARTMAN
[moments later, still on the bed] Oh, son of a bitch!
[Montage. Butters tosses a basketball with Cartman on the front lawn. Cartman, as AWESOM-O, can't catch it.]
BUTTERS
Hey there have you heard about my robot friend?
[They're walking along in a meadow. Butters is telling him a story.]
BUTTERS
He's metal and small and doesn't judge me at all.
He's a cyber, wired bundle of joy.
[Butters has AWESOM-O take shots at a basketball hoop. The shot is good and Butters is pleased.]
BUTTERS
My robot friend.
[Stan, Kyle and Kenny observe nearby from behind a bush. They're dismayed at what they see. Stan pinches his nose and shuts his eyes in frustration, then walks off. Kyle and Kenny follow.]
BUTTERS
I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend.
[Butters jumps in a puddle, then has AWESOM-O do the same. Butters giggles.]
BUTTERS
He's smart as can be and emotion-free
[Butters washes dishes while AWESOM-O dries them, then they go see "The Prince and Me." They exit, with Butters skipping beside AWESOM-O.]
BUTTERS
And he's computed his way to my heart.
My robot friend.
[At a restaurant two burgers reach Butters' table. He gets one, he motions to the waiter that AWESOM-O doesn't need the other one. The waiter looks confused, then walks away with the other burger.]
BUTTERS
My robot friend.
[Butters has AWESOM-O pull him along in a red wagon.]
BUTTERS
My robot friend.
[They walk into a sunset together.]
BUTTERS
My robot... friend.
[Butters' house, living room. His dad reads the newspaper, his mom arrives with coffee and cookies and sets them down on the coffee table.]
LINDA
Oohhh, that's so cute. Did you see Butters and his friend Eric playing Robot?
STEPHEN
[tosses the paper onto the couch arm as Linda serves him coffee] Yes. Those boys are quite imaginative. Leave it to them to find a fun way to do the dishes. [takes his cup]
BUTTERS
[leading Cartman to the stairs] That's great AWESOM-O! [Cartman carries a pile of clothes] You can carry all my laundry in one trip!
LINDA
Ah, Butters, it's getting late. You should be getting ready for bed soon.
BUTTERS
Okay Mom. Well, come on, AWESOM-O. Bedtime.
LINDA
Oh, is your little robot friend staying the night?
BUTTERS
Well of course he is. He's my robot, ain't he?
LINDA
That's okay with your mom, Mr. Robot?
CARTMAN
AWESOM-O does not have a mom.
BUTTERS
Yeah! Don't you know nothin' about robots? Come on, AWESOM-O! You can put my laundry away! [Cartman follows Butters upstairs]
LINDA
Aw, that's just adorable.
STEPHEN
It's good to see Butters finally have a friend that wants to stay over.
[The Stotch bathroom. Butters is brushing his teeth, AWESOM-O stands next to him.]
BUTTERS
I love to brush my teeth! In the mornin' and at night!
To keep 'em white and healthy, I got to brush them all the time!
CARTMAN
[under his breath] Grrr. Jesus Christ I can't go on like this. [normal. Butters opens up the medicine cabinet] Butters, remember when you said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears?
BUTTERS
Oh. Yeah.
CARTMAN
I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I see the video?
BUTTERS
[turns around carrying a box of suppositories] Awww, you don't need to do that, AWESOM-O. Hey, I gotta put in my suppository. [takes one out and puts the box on the cabinet] Can you help me?
CARTMAN
What?
BUTTERS
Remember I said I put that medicinal suppository in my anus? It'll be so much easier havin' you do it from now on.
CARTMAN
Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed for that function.
BUTTERS
[hops down from the stool] Haw, it's real easy. I'll show you. You just take this little thingy out of the plastic... paper, and I'll, I'll pull down my pants ...and just slide it up in my anus there.
CARTMAN
...No way.
BUTTERS
AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed to do whatever I tell you.
CARTMAN
Weak! [turns right and faces Butters' ass.]
BUTTERS
Ye- yeah, that, that's pretty good. Get it up there good and deep.
CARTMAN
Lame!
[Butters' house, moments later.]
BUTTERS
All right AWESOM-O, time for us to get some sleep. [POV changes from outside to bedroom overhead] Hey, you want me to teach you some bedtime songs? If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo...
CARTMAN
AWESOM-O must rest! His CPU system overloading.
BUTTERS
Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O. Let's get us some shut-eye, [turns off the light] or what, or whatever robots have.
[Butters closes his eyes and drifts off to sleep. He turns to his left and places a hand on AWESOM-O.]
[Morning. A cock crows. Butters wakes up, but AWESOM-O isn't in bed with him. He looks around and sees his room is a mess. His drawers are out of the dressers and his clothes are strewn all over the place. One of his clothing rods has been knocked down and his closet doors are open. AWESOM-O is shown at Butters' desk looking through more stuff.]
CARTMAN
Where is it? Where is it?!
BUTTERS
AWESOM-O?!
CARTMAN
Wah!
BUTTERS
AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you doing?
CARTMAN
Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you.
BUTTERS
Aw Jeez, Jeez Louise! My mom is gonna be awful sore when she sees this mess! Now AWESOM-O, that is a bad robot! You can't do no chores for me unless I tell you to do them! You got it?!
CARTMAN
AWESOM-O understands.
BUTTERS
Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin', AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better!
[Three spankings follow, but as they are done against the robot frame, they are ineffective.]
BUTTERS
Just know, AWESOM-O, that I did it because I love you. Okay, come on, let's go make some breakfast.
CARTMAN
Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape!
[Butters' house, downstairs. Butters is drawing a picture at the coffee table.]
BUTTERS
Look at that, AWESOM-O! I drew a picture of us playing in a field together. [Butters and AWESOM-O are walking in a field] Ah I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some Sunny Delight. [walks off]
CARTMAN
I would like some Sunny Delight too.
BUTTERS
[tickled] Don't be silly, AWESOM-O. Robots don't need to drink nothin'. [tickled, turns away] Uh, heehee. [the doorbell rings] Whoa. Uh, go answer the door, AWESOM-O.
CARTMAN
[turns] AWESOM-O will answers the door. [walks towards the door as Butters leaves and opens it. He sees Stan, Kyle, and Kenny]
KYLE
What the hell are you doing, fatass?
STAN
Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?
CARTMAN
[normal voice] Shh! [lifts up the helmet part of the outfit] I just need to uh make Butters think I'm a robot for a little while longer.
KYLE
Why?
CARTMAN
Because I need to, all right?! I've got something planned that's uh gonna be really sweet. Just play along, okay?
KYLE
Why?
CARTMAN
Kyle, Goddamnit, will you just do-?
BUTTERS
[appears behind Cartman holding his glass of Sunny Delight] Who's at the door, AWESOM-O?
[Cartman turns around, then adjusts his helmet.]
CARTMAN
[monotone] Three boys named Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.
BUTTERS
Ah, hey fellas! Ah, I see you met my robot.
STAN
Uh yeah, Butters, he's real cool.
BUTTERS
Hey he sure is! We do everything together. Why last night we even had a slumber party. [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny quickly look to Cartman]
CARTMAN
Weak.
BUTTERS
He can do anything I command him to. He's real smart. Watch this: Hey AWESOM-O, will you go get my friends some Sunny Delight?
CARTMAN
Yes, of course. [begins to walk towards the kitchen]
KYLE
Oh wait. Hey AWESOM-O, [Cartman stops] I'd also like some celery sticks chopped up two inches long, with peanut butter and raisins on top.
CARTMAN
Suck my balls, Kyle. [resumes his walk]
BUTTERS
[cheerfully] He's made in Japan!
[The dining room. Stephen holds a cup of coffee and listens as Linda talks to Liane.]
LINDA
Yes, it has just been a delight having your son over, Mrs. Cartman. He and Butters are really getting along great.
LIANE
Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Mrs. Stotch. Eric has been having some emotional problems lately.
LINDA
Well, the reason I'm calling is that Butters is supposed to go see his Aunt Nellie in Los Angeles this weekend. The boys are getting along so well, that we were thinking of inviting Eric to go along.
LIANE
Oh, well, I'm not sure. Actually, Eric is still supposed to be grounded for trying to exterminate the Jews two weeks ago.
LINDA
[Stephen takes a sip] Excuse me, I didn't catch that.
LIANE
Oh, but I suppose it would be good for him. Yes, of course he can go. I'll bring some of clothes over.
LINDA
Oh, wonderful! The boys will be so excited.
[The kitchen. AWESOM-O rummages around under the sink.]
CARTMAN
Maybe he put that videotape in here somewhere.
BUTTERS
[enters] AWESOM-O, what are you doing? My friends are waiting for their beverages. Chop chop! [Cartman moves to the refrigerator, Stephen and Linda enter]
LINDA
Hey guys, great news! It's been arranged, you two are both going to Los Angeles to visit Butters' Aunt Nellie!
BUTTERS
[overjoyed] Oh boy! My robot gets to come with me to see Aunt Nellie?!
CARTMAN
What?
BUTTERS
Oh boy, [shakes Cartman's hand] AWESOM-O! We're gonna have the best time ever! [hugs the "robot"]
CARTMAN
Lame.
[Los Angeles, day. The Hollywood sign appears in the background.]
[Aunt Nellie's house.]
UNCLE BUDD
Hey Nellie, guess what I found scrampin' around the airport. [Butters enters in a suit]
BUTTERS
Hi Aunt Nellie! [runs up to her and they hug each other]
AUNT NELLIE
There's my little nephew! How was your flight? [they let go of each other]
BUTTERS
It was long. We had a three-hour delay... departin' Denver, but we're here!
AUNT NELLIE
Didn't ya bring any bags?
BUTTERS
Well, sure, but my robot is bringin' them in.
AUNT NELLIE
Your robot?
UNCLE BUDD
Butters' new friend is a little strange. He, he really takes playing Robot seriously.
[Cartman walks in mechanically with all the luggage.]
BUTTERS
There he is! AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt Nellie. [Cartman drops the suitcases]
AUNT NELLIE
Hello! It's nice to have you here.
CARTMAN
AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste. Where is the nearest toilet, please?
AUNT NELLIE
Oh oh, right through there, Mr. Robot.
CARTMAN
Thank you. [walks in the direction Aunt Nellie points to]
UNCLE BUDD
I don't think he took the costume off the entire trip.
AUNT NELLIE
Well, did you wanna get right to sight-seeing, or are you guys hungry after such a long flight.
BUTTERS
Nah, I ate on the plane. And AWESOM-O is a robot, so he don't need to eat.
AUNT NELLIE
Right...
[Aunt Nellie's restroom. Cartman runs in frantically and takes off the helmet. His hair is matted against his head and he gasps for air. He runs up to the sink and reaches... for the toothpaste. He squeezes the tube and sucks out the contents hungrily.]
BUTTERS
[knocks on the door] AWESOM-O?
CARTMAN
Aw- Aw- AWESOM-O is coming. [finishes off the tube, hops down, and tosses the tube aside]
BUTTERS
Come on, AWESOM-O! We're gonna go sightseein'!
CARTMAN
Argh! [heads out.]
[Montage. Hollywood Boulevard, facing the Chinese Theater. The Passion is playing there. Butters takes a picture of AWESOM-O next to the cemented hand- and footprints of the stars. Next, he and AWESOM-O ride down a log in an amusement park. Next, he and AWESOM-O are in a plane ride together. Next, AWESOM-O rubs some suntan lotion on Butters' back. Next, he and AWESOM-O take part in a Galaxy Studios Tour ride. A shark pops up and roars menacingly at the riders. Next, Catamount Pictures is shown.]
BUTTERS
I'm hangin' out in LA with my robot friend
We're havin' such fun in the hot hot sun
We're two of a kind-
That's me!
And my robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
[Catamount Pictures. Butters and Cartman walk around. Cartman carries the bags.]
BUTTERS
Can you believe we're at a real live movie studio, AWESOM-O? Aren't we havin' the best time?!
CARTMAN
Butters, wouldn't you like to have some time away from AWESOM-O? We could meet up later, perhaps?
BUTTERS
Hey, look over there, AWESOM-O. The film studio commissary. [Le Catamount Bistró] That's where all them rich movie producers who come up with uh, Hollywood blockbusters have their lunch. Neat-o, huh? [moves off]
[Le Catamount Bistró, Two producers talk.]
PRODUCER
[as the other producer eats] Damnit, Mitch. How come our movie studio can't come up with any winners? I mean, we're smart, right?
MITCH
[the bald producer] We're really smart.
PRODUCER
We need an idea for a movie that's a home run. A feel-good romp for the whole family. [notices something and points] Hey, what's that over there? [Mitch looks over his shoulder. The camera looks at Butters and AWESOM-O attracting a crowd]
WOMAN
Wow, that's a really neat little robot you have there, little boy.
MILLIE
What's he do?
BUTTERS
Well, he can do anything. Watch this: Hey, AWESOM-O, who's gonna win the Super Bowl next year?
CARTMAN
The New Orleans Saints. [everyone around them laughs, and the producers approach]
BOY
Hey, Mr. Robot, how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
CARTMAN
Seventeen. [everyone laughs again]
PRODUCER
Mitch, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
MITCH
[strokes his chin] Yeah. Maybe that robot can be programmed to come up with movie ideas! [smiles]
PRODUCER
[looks at him intently] Exactly! [smiles]
[Catamount Pictures boardroom. The producer introduces Butters and AWESOM-O to his staff.]
PRODUCER
Gentlemen, this little boy was kind enough to let us show you his robot. The AWESOM-O 4000. [approaches the robot, who's seated at one end of the table] I've already seen what it can do.
STAFFER 1
Uh, excuse me sir, but uh, that's not a robot.
PRODUCER
It's not?
STAFFER 1
No, it clearly had bipedal movement, so the correct term is "computerized automatron."
MITCH
Oh, very nice, Mitch.
STAFFER 2
You are the smart one.
PRODUCER
Well, regardless, I believe maybe this automatron can help us come up with new movie ideas.
STAFFER 2
How can a robot come up with better ideas for movies than us?
PRODUCER
Watch this: AWESOM-O, given the current trends of the movie-going public can you come up with an idea for a movie that will break a hundred million box office?
CARTMAN
Um... okay. How about this: [the staffers take pen to paper and anticipate the ideas] Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl, but then it turns out that the girl is actually a... golden retriever, or something.
STAFFER 2
[thinking over this idea, then write it down] Oh, perfect!
STAFFER 3
We'll call it "Puppy Love"!
STAFFER 2
Give us another movie idea, AWESOM-O!
MITCH
Yeah, yeah!
STAFFER 3
Let's hear it!
MITCH
Yeah, we wanna hear it!
STAFFER 3
Come on, come on!
CARTMAN
Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler... inherits like, a billion dollars, but first, he has to, like, become a... boxer, or something.
STAFFER 3
[the producers start writing again]... Yes, it's flawless!
MITCH
Punch-Drunk Billionaire!
[Aunt Nellie's house, guest room. Butters is at the desk counting up all the movie he and AWESOM-O got for Cartman's ideas and putting one hundred dollar bills one per envelope.]
BUTTERS
Boy, Los Angeles is great, huh AWESOM-O? Can you believe those guys paid us a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas?
CARTMAN
You should split that money with AWESOM-O. After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas.
BUTTERS
Hahaa, right! What are you gonna do with money, AWESOM-O? Buy some robot pants? Haha, no! We got each other and that's all we need, AWESOM-O. I'm gonna send this money to needy kids in third-world countries.
CARTMAN
[growing desperate, walks around] Haaaa! Haaaa!
BUTTERS
[concerned] You, you okay AWESOM-O?
CARTMAN
AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint.
BUTTERS
Well you go ahead and relax, AWESOM-O. We've got another full day of pitching movies tomorrow.
[Washington DC, the Pentagon.]
[The Pentagon, a boardroom. A general addresses his peers.]
GENERAL
Gentlemen, Ladies, we all know that we live in a time of uncertainty. The risk of an attack on American soil is higher than ever. Now, I believe we may be able to curb that risk. Two days ago our intelligence department came across this.
[He turns around and faces a wall of TV screens. His peers turn to look. He then turns the screens on. Images of AWESOM-O, taken from various angles, pop up.]
GENERAL
The AWESOM-O 4000. It is currently being used by Catamount Pictures to develop ideas for movies. Our sources say that in just one week it has come up with over one thousand movie ideas, eight hundred of which feature Adam Sandler. [the officers murmur amongst themselves]
BLACK OFFICIAL
That's incredible!
WHITE OFFICIAL
You're thinking the robot could be used to come up with anti-Islamic movies?
GENERAL
No. If we got our hands on that robot, we could re-program it and turn it into a weapon!
BLACK OFFICIAL
Yes, that might be the best thing to do.
WHITE OFFICIAL
Uh huh. I don't see how we have a choice.
SCIENTIST
Hold on a second: If that robot is designed for entertainment, then, turning it into a weapon is unethical.
GENERAL
Unethical? Let me explain something to you, Mr. Scientist! We understand that the robot is from Japan! That means that the Japanese have more of them! And if the Japanese fabricates one of them into a weapon before we do...
BLACK OFFICIAL
Jesus. It would be Pearl Harbor all over again.
WHITE OFFICIAL
But worse. With robots.
SCIENTIST
I'm sorry, I must protest. We, we have no data suggesting the Japanese have developed a robot with offensive capability.
GENERAL
You're paid to think, Mr. Scientist! National security is our jub. [the scientist sits back down.] Gentlemen, we're going to Los Angeles! [zoom in] I want that robot!
[Catamount Pictures lobby. Butters places a call.]
BUTTERS
Yeah, me and my robot are still over at the movie studio, Aunt Nellie. We're makin' all sorts of money for the poor.
[The boardroom. Cartman is pitching more movie ideas.]
CARTMAN
Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut.
PRODUCER
Great, AWESOM-O, great. Uh guys, take a break. I need a minute alone with AWESOM-O.
[The other men rise and leave the room, making plans for lunch on the way out. The producer approaches Cartman.]
PRODUCER
You are an incredible robot, AWESOM-O. I was just wondering... are you by chance a... pleasure model?
CARTMAN
...What?
PRODUCER
Well, have you been programmed to... satisfy... urges of humans?
CARTMAN
AWESOM-O does not understand.
PRODUCER
Let me show you what I mean. [removes his tie]
[Catamount Pictures lobby.]
BUTTERS
Well yeah, we're havin' a great time, Aunt Nellie. These movie studio guys are real nice.
CARTMAN
[from the boardroom] Lame!
BUTTERS
Yeah, we're makin' a bunch more money. I can't believe it either.
[The boardroom doors burst open and AWESOM-O runs out.]
CARTMAN
Not cool! Totally lame! [runs to his left. Butters looks over his shoulder]
BUTTERS
AWESOM-O? Well, I gotta go, Aunt Nellie. Ah, AWESOM-O is havin' some kind of malfunction. [hangs up and goes after AWESOM-O.] AWESOM-O? Hey, where'd ya go?
[Butters looks left, then right, then goes to the right, exiting the scene. Moments later the producer shows up at the doorway with his pants down.]
CARTMAN
Waaaaa!
[A cattle prod appears and shocks him until he falls over. A dolly then appears and two soldiers quickly put Cartman on it and haul him off.]
SOLDIER
Let's go! Move, move!
BUTTERS
[appears around the corner] AWESOM-O? [notices the soldiers] Hey, what are you doin' with him?!
[The soldiers exit some side doors and toss him into the back of a waiting van. Butters exits the side door.]
BUTTERS
That's my robot! [the soldiers get into the van and drive off] AWESOM-OOOOOOOO!!!
[A military base near Los Angeles. In a warehouse, AWESOM-O, shackled onto a platform, is raised from a horizontal position to vertical. Two soldiers approach on either side of Cartman and tighten the locks on him.]
GENERAL
Are those arm and leg locks secure?
SOLDIER
Secure, sir!
GENERAL
Good. I don't want that robot mobile until I know what it's capable of. All right, power it on. [the scientist turns a drill on and approaches AWESOM-O]
CARTMAN
Whoa, whoa, wha- whoa, whoa!
SCIENTIST
[steps back surprised] What the hell?
GENERAL
What's going on?
SCIENTIST
[in disbelief] It... powered itself back on.
GENERAL
[whispers to a soldier to his left] Stand by. Be ready to destroy it.
[The soldier cocks his semiautomatic and aims at Cartman.]
CARTMAN
Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can't I move?!
SCIENTIST
Are your systems stable? Run a systems check on your CPU.
CARTMAN
The fuck are you talkin' about, dude?!
SCIENTIST
Ah, I'm sorry, robot, [in a low voice, almost a whisper] they want me to reprogram you.
CARTMAN
I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive!
SCIENTIST
What did you say?
CARTMAN
I said I'm a real person, asswipe!
SCIENTIST
[stunned] ...Oh my God. [turns around and approaches the military]
GENERAL
What's happening?
SCIENTIST
The robot... It thinks it's alive. It's developed consciousness.
GENERAL
What? How can that be?
SCIENTIST
Must be a malfunction of its exographical IMS or the... interlaced BV system.
GENERAL
Speak in a language we can understand, Mr. Scientist!
SCIENTIST
Your robot doesn't know it's a robot!
CARTMAN
Goddamnit, get me down from here! [the military approaches him]
GENERAL
Who made you, robot?
CARTMAN
[enunciating] I'm not a robot, I'm a human!
WHITE OFFICIAL
[the military turns around] Jesus, the scientist was right.
GENERAL
But, who would have programmed it to think it was human? The movie studio?
CARTMAN
Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!
GENERAL
[faces Cartman] Dear Christ, they gave it memories, too.
SCIENTIST
Sure, why not? Program the memories of some eight-year-old boy who doesn't exist, and make the robot think he's real! Makes for a lot better movies! I'm not reprogramming a robot that's developed consciousness!
GENERAL
Do I have to remind you of your position?! Don't forget you have a duty to your country, [draws out the next few syllables] Mr. Scientist!! I want that robot's memories and consciousness E-RASED, so we can take it back to Washington! GOT IT?! [the military leaves him to his work.]
SCIENTIST
Damn you all to hell!
[Los Angeles. Butters walks down a sidewalk alone with his head down.]
BUTTERS
[voiceover, sadly]
Hey there, did you know I had a robot friend?
We used to laugh and play, but someone took him away.
He was my ten gigahertz old pal.
My robot friend.
BUTTERS
[realizing something] Hey, wait a minute. [sees the van that took AWESOM-O away] Why, that's the van that- [tuns towards it] Oh my God!
[The military base, warehouse. The scientist has positioned AWESOM-O so his head can be drilled into, and a huge drill bit begins to descend towards him.]
CARTMAN
[fidgets frantically] Goddamnit, stop! I'm real! I'm real!
SOLDIER
It'll all be over soon, robot!
[The scientist scratches his head, then decides to take action. He takes out a vice wrench and smacks the soldier with it, knocking him out. He turns off the drill, tosses the wrench aside and goes to AWESOM-O.]
SCIENTIST
Hang on! I'm getting you out of here, robot!
CARTMAN
Aw, it's about freaking time, jackass!
[The General and his men return, Cartman gets off the platform.]
GENERAL
What the hell are you doing?!
SCIENTIST
[turns around] Well I- I'm saving a conscious being! If you wanna kill it, you'll have to go through me!
GENERAL
Fine. Kill that son of a bitch!
CARTMAN
No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am! [raises his helmet enough to show his eyes]
BUTTERS
[enters] AWESOM-O!
[The helmet quickly goes down and Cartman becomes a robot again.]
CARTMAN
I am the AWESOM-O 4000.
[The soldier fires one shot into the scientist, and the scientist goes down.]
BUTTERS
No! [runs up to Cartman] No, please! [hugs him] Don't kill him! He's my best friend! He's my best friend in the whole world!
[Butters begins to sob. The military is amazed by this display of affection from a boy towards his robot.]
SCIENTIST
[still alive, looks up] There. You see? You want to tell me this isn't humanity? Who's to judge what makes something human anyway?! [pulls out his stomach] Does this make me human?! [pulls out his lung] Or this?! [pulls out his intestines] Or these?! [falls over dead]
GENERAL
[approaches AWESOM-O] Perhaps... there is consciousness in this robot. Maybe we as a society need to realize that artificial intelligence... is intelligence all the same, and we can learn from the robots. I think maybe one day we can all- [Cartman farts, Butters steps back surprised] Hey, wait a minute, did, did that robot just fart?
BUTTERS
Hey, robots don't fart!
CARTMAN
Uh... now ending fart sequence.
GENERAL
Oh, and it, it smells, too!
CARTMAN
Smell sequence initiated.
BLACK OFFICIAL
A robot with smelly farts? That doesn't make any sense.
BUTTERS
Hang on a second, here!
[Butters reaches for AWESOM-O's helmet and removes it. The military is taken aback at what they see..]
[A portable screen is put up inside a room and the videotape of Cartman acting strange in his backyard is being shown. The sound of laughing kids is heard. On the tape, Cartman is dancing around like Britney Spears.]
CARTMAN
[rapping]
Would you like to touch my body?
Come on and touch my body!
Oooo, my hot body!
Don't you like my hot body?
Come on and touch my titties!
I've got such nice round titties!
Come on Justin, touch my body!
[begins dancing with a life-size cutout of Justin Timberlake]
Mmm, Justin, yeah!
Touch my body! You and me!
Check it out, my nice hot body!
Come on, my body!
[As the video plays, shots are shown of: the fourth graders and the kindergartners, more fourth graders and older students (including Stan, Kyle, and Kenny), Chef, Principal Victoria, Mr. Garrison, other teachers, Butters enjoying himself immensely, the Catamount Pictures producers, the military, then of a fuming Cartman having to suffer it all as everyone laughs.]
GENERAL
Wow, kid, you're a little faggot!
CARTMAN
Lame...
End of AWESOM-O


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Jimmy is in training for the upcoming Special Olympics and he's determined to win at any cost

script:Up the Down Steroid

[Stan's backyard, day. The boys are playing the "Investigative Reports with Bill Curtis" game when Timmy and Jimmy arrive.]
JIMMY
Hey fellas.
STAN
Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.
TIMMY
Timmy!
JIMMY
[carries a brochure under his right arm] Say fellas, Jimmy and I were wondering if maybe you would come and cheer for us next S-S-Saturday. We're both competing in the Special Olympics down in Denver.
CARTMAN
[approaches Jimmy] The Special Olympics? What's so special about them?
KYLE
They're Olympic games for handicapped people.
CARTMAN
[snickers] What?
JIMMY
[hands Cartman the brochure] Timmy and I are competing in a variety of events.
STAN
Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on.
KYLE
Yeah, that'd be cool.
JIMMY
Thanks a lot, fellas. Well, we gotta get down to the training center and start working out. Word is we have a lot of sssstiff competition this year.
KYLE
Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys.
TIMMY
Timmy! [he and Jimmy walk off.]
CARTMAN
Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement.
KYLE
...You're an asshole, Cartman.
CARTMAN
What? What'd I do?
[Denver Athletic Club, Denver, day. Inside, the athletes are working out on a variety of equipment. Jimmy and Timmy are at a bench press. Jimmy presses weights as Timmy spots him.]
JIMMY
S-s-six!
TIMMY
Timmah.
JIMMY
S-s-s-ssseven!
TIMMY
Timmah. Timmah!
JIMMY
S-s-seven!
TIMMY
Timmah! Timmah!
JIMMY
[gets back on count, but falters] Ni- I can- I can't! [Timmy helps Jimmy put the weights back on the bar rest] Huff. Oh man. [sits up] Gee whiz, Timmy. It looks like we have some pretty stiff competition this year. [another kid at a nearby bench press laughs] All of the special athletes seem to be in tip-top condition, and I can't even get past seven reps. Oh well, that's it for me, Timmy. I'm p-p-p-pooped. I'll see you in the locker room.
TIMMY
Timmah. [Jimmy walks away]
FRANCIS
Hey Jimmy, g-good luck on Saturday.
JIMMY
[turns and looks] You too, Francis. [looks forward and resumes walking. In a darkened hallway stands a big athlete with an air of hauteur about him]
NATHAN
Hey Jimmy.
JIMMY
Oh he-hey, N-Nathan.
NATHAN
So uh, I see you train pretty hard.
JIMMY
[moves into the hallway and faces Nathan] Yeah, it sure is tough. I'm training really hard, but I'm not improving fast enough, and the Special Olympics are a... week away.
NATHAN
Weeell uh, maybe I can help you out. You know, there are shortcuts.
JIMMY
What kind of shortcuts?
NATHAN
You know. Steroids.
JIMMY
S-s-ss-s-s-steroids? [Nathan signals him to be quite as another handicapped athlete walks by] ...But aren't those illegal?
NATHAN
Yeah, sure, but these are new. They don't show up in our urine tests.
JIMMY
So uh, ha-how do they... w-w-work?
NATHAN
[holds out a prescription bottle] You just take one of these little blue babies [holds up three fingers] three times a day [reaches into a fanny pack and pulls out a syringe] and inject this directly into your bloodstream [holds up two fingers] twice a day before meals.
JIMMY
How much would this cost me?
NATHAN
Uuuh, it isn't cheap. I've gotta keep vice off my back and secure shipments from overseas.
JIMMY
[looks around uneasily] Well... then maybe I'll just use them a-al-little bit. You know, as a performance.
NATHAN
Oh, whatever you say, Jimmy my friend. [steps closer] Whatever you say. [Jimmy reaches out for the drugs]
[Stan's house, front yard. The boys are playing with various toy big rigs. Stan moves a gas truck, Kenny an ambulance, Kyle a tow truck.]
CARTMAN
[rushes up with the brochure] You guys! You guys! I have the best idea ever! I'm gonna be rich!
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: "At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000" [he looks at his friends as his jaw drops]
STAN
So?
CARTMAN
So?! So, dude, think about it. If somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks!
KYLE
Oh no. Cartman, no!
CARTMAN
It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicaps!
STAN
That's really, really terrible, dude.
CARTMAN
Terrible?? Whatever! You guys' brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can! It'll work, you'll see. [walks off]
KYLE
[moves and catches up to Cartman] Cartman! I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics!
CARTMAN
Why?
KYLE
Because! [takes away the brochure]
CARTMAN
What are you gonna do, Kyle?! Tell on me?! [points an accusing finger at him] Then you'll be a great big no-good double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale! [lowers it] Is that really how you deal with your problems?! Grow up, Kyle! [turns around and walks off. Kyle seethes in silence. Cartman now talks to himself] All I have to do is make people think I'm handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars. It won't be easy, but nothing worth having ever is.
[A montage, to the tune of "Scarface (Put It To The Limit)" Cartman sits at his computer typing away. Onscreen are his plans for looking handicapped, "Ways to Appear Handicapped." He's then at the library poring over piles of books. The librarian wheels a cartload of books over, Cartman points to the spot at which they should be dropped off, and the librarian obliges. Cartman then rides to school in the Special Ed bus, taking notes on the behavior of handicapped students. Next, he's in the bathroom at home contorting his face this way and that, then takes more notes. He leafs through another book and types in more notes into his computer, then pours himself some more coffee.]
[Cartman goes to a clothing store looking for ill-fitting clothes. He then cobbles a custom shoe for himself. He goes home and tries it out. He goes to a CGI studio and puts on a motion suit so he can make a 3D model of himself on a computer. He takes the 3D model home and modifies it on his own computer: "Handicapped Walk Analysis." He then goes into the bathroom and cuts off clumps of his hair to look as if he were retarded. He goes to the living room and looks at a Kid Rock video for more inspiration and takes notes. He puts on a bicycle helmet and pulls his hair out through the holes. He assembles the various parts of his handicapped outfit and puts it on. He squishes his face upwards for the finishing touch and ties the helmet straps together well below his chin.]
CARTMAN
Daaaarrrr. Duuuuurrrr. I wanna be in the Special Olympics. [loosens the chin straps and lowers his face to normal] Bull's eye!
[Jimmy's house, bedroom, night. Jimmy is at his bed. He straps on a strip of heavy rubberband, dabs his arm a few times with alcohol, jabs the syringe into his arm and injects some liquid steroids into his arm. He loosens the rubber band and someone knocks on his door. He looks around and jumps off his bead.]
JIMMY
Oh! Agh! Ju-just a second! [heads for his duffel bag and hauls it to his night stand. The knock is heard again]
RYAN
Jimmy?
JIMMY
[sweeps the steroids into the bag] Hang on, I'm-I'm, coming. [rushes to the closet and shoves the duffle bag in.]
RYAN
Jim, it's your father!
JIMMY
[walking towards the door] I said I'm coming! Give me a Goddamned s-second! [gasps and realizes he still has the syringe in his mouth and spits it out. He opens the door and sees his father with a cup of coffee.]
RYAN
Jimmy, were you masturbating?
JIMMY
N-no, Dad.
RYAN
Okay. Well, you have a visitor. [the camera pans down to a pretty girl, who enters the room]
GIRL
Hi Jimmy.
JIMMY
Oh. Hi, N-N-Nancy.
NANCY
I was hoping we would study for the spelling test tomorrow.
JIMMY
Oh. Sure thing. Come on in.
RYAN
I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Jim.
JIMMY
Yeah, Dad. We've been going out since we met in Free Period last week.
RYAN
I'll leave you two alone. [reaches for the door, but stops] Y-You sure you weren't masturbating, Jim? It's okay if you were.
JIMMY
Dad, Jesus C-Christ!
RYAN
Okay, then. [they look at each other]
[A basketball court, day. The boys take turn shooting hoops, but none of them make a basket. Cartman waddles into view in his handicapped getup.]
CARTMAN
Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey. [the boys stop and look] Hey guys, what's going on? Drrrrr.
KYLE
[low voice] God damn you!
CARTMAN
You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away. [This means it's Tuesday prior] I'm going to go sign up now.
KYLE
No you're not! [whips out the brochure] I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the Special Olympics.
CARTMAN
What?! [takes the brochure back from Kyle]
KYLE
It says right there "a parent has to be with you to sign up," and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha! [grins confidently. Cartman looks at him, then at the brochure and reads]
[Cartman's house, later. Liane is at the kitchen table paying bills. Cartman walks in from the dining room. He puts his arms behind his back.]
CARTMAN
Moooommmm?
LIANE
Yes, hon? [begins writing a check]
CARTMAN
Um, could I get you to do something for me?
LIANE
What's that, hon?
CARTMAN
Um, okay. This is goin' ta sound a little strange. Um, but, stick with me. Um, moooommm? Would you mind coming with me to sign up for the Special Olympics so I can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollars? [Liane looks up and goes pale]
LIANE
Oh... N- no, sweetie. I believe those Olympics are just for... "special" children.
CARTMAN
I'm not special? I thought you always said I was special.
LIANE
You are, hon, but... I don't think that's a very good idea. [writes out another check]
CARTMAN
...I'll split the money with you. [Liane stops]
LIANE
...I'm sorry, Eric. The answer is No. [Cartman is upset and begins to think a little harder]
CARTMAN
[walks up to the table] All right, Mom, look. Here's .. the truth. [under his breath] God, this is gonna be hard to say. [normally] I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn't be so cold. I just want a chance to change. [looks up at her with longing, puppy dog eyes.] Help me change?
LIANE
Oh, a- a- all right, sweetie, I- I'll take you tomorrow.
CARTMAN
Awesome.
[Denver Athletic Club, day. Jimmy and Timmy are in the locker room getting ready to leave.]
JIMMY
You did a great job in the 500, Timmy. You're really im-p-p-proving.
TIMMY
Timmah!
JIMMY
I think I really got a shot at the gold in the swimming competition. Coach says I'm the fastest he's ever seen. Well, I'll see you nice and early for p-practice, Tim-Tim. Oh, uh, can you hand me my bag?
TIMMY
[slips on his sweater] Timmah! [reaches over for the bag and grabs a handle. The contents spill out, since he didn't grab the other handle, and he sees the steroids drop to the floor. He looks down sadly and holds the bag a litle closer. Jimmy is frozen in place. Timmy's voice shakes] Tim- Timmy?
JIMMY
Oh, uh, so... hey, Timmy... uh hu-how about we go out for a s-s-soda later? [sweeps the steroids back into the bag. Timmy finds a bottle on his pants and looks at it. Jimmy finishes up and leaves] I'll uh, I-I'll see you later, Tim-Tim.
TIMMY
[turns and exclaims] Timmah... [the tone of voice stops Jimmy]
JIMMY
[turns] Look it's really none of your b-b-b-beeswax, Timmy!
TIMMY
[rolls up to Jimmy] Timmah. Timmah!
JIMMY
Because I, maybe I don't have what it takes to win with-without them!
TIMMY
[turns aside and sighs] Timmah. [rolls away a bit] T-T-Timmah.
JIMMY
You you aren't gonna... tell anybody, are you?
TIMMY
Huh! Timmah! T-Timmah!
JIMMY
Look, it's my b-body and it's my choice what I put in it!
TIMMY
Timmah! Timmah, Jimmih! [points to himself] Arrrh Timmah! [points to himself] Jimmih!
JIMMY
Don't lecture me on the complexities of sportsmanship. You know as well as I do most of the kids in Special Olympics aren't shooting up to compete. I'm just trying to k-keep up.
TIMMY
[spent] Huh... Timmah... [holds the bottle out over the floor] Timmah.
JIMMY
[angered] S-s-s-so what are you gonna do now, huh?! You gonna be a fuckin' narc and show that b-bottle to the... coaches?! [Timmy drops the bottle on the ground, turns around and rolls away. Jimmy watches him leave] Don't think you're any better than me, Timmy! I'm just living in the real world! [looks down at the bottle, then kicks the bottle away with his left crutch] Fuck!
[The Special Olympic Field, next day. Timmy is in the field ready for the javelin throw.]
TIMMY
Timmah! [rolls forward and throws the javelin] Aaar-yaaaaah Timmah! [the javelin hits the ground near a coach]
COACH
All right, thirty yards, Timmy! Keep it up!
TIMMY
Oowrrr! Timmah! Livilaye!
JIMMY
[runs down a track for the long jump] Y-yeess! [jumps into the air and lands]Grrrr!
COACH 2
Wuh-wow, Jimmy, I can't believe how much you've improved! You're bigger and stronger than I've ever seen you!
JIMMY
Yeah, I've been working out... r-really hard.
COACH 2
You keep going like this and you'll break Special Olympics records on Saturday!
[The Special Olympic Field, registration table, moments later. A family of three arrives.]
MAN
Okay, so this is all the stuff we need to sign Michael in?
VOLUNTEER
Yup. Just take the sign-up sheet down to the next table and we'll get it all finalized.
WOMAN
Thank you very much.
VOLUNTEER
Thank you! Good luck, Michael.
MICHAEL
Thanks.
VOLUNTEER
Okay, next in line please?
CARTMAN
[looking really retarded, steps up to the table with his mom] Naaaa! Daaaaa!
VOLUNTEER
Hello there.
LIANE
Hello. Um, I would like to... sign my son up, please.
CARTMAN
Naaaa!
VOLUNTEER
Oh, great! What's his name?
LIANE
Eric Cartman...
CARTMAN
Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa!
VOLUNTEER
Okay. Age?
LIANE
He's nine.
VOLUNTEER
O-kay, and what's his disability?
LIANE
...Um, he's retarded. [Cartman offers a retarded grin]
VOLUNTEER
...N-no, I'm asking what his specific condition is. Down's Syndrome? Cerebral palsy?
LIANE
Ohhh, oh. I'm not sure. [Cartman looks up with some concern] Sweetie, what is your condition?
CARTMAN
...How should I know? I'm retarded. Daaaaa!
VOLUNTEER
I'll just leave that blank for now.
[The Special Olympic Field, under the bleachers. Jimmy prepares to inject more steroids into his right arm.]
JIMMY
[performs the injection] Yeah, b-bigger, stronger! [Timmy rolls by and hears him, then raises his eyes in alarm]
[South Park Elementary, day. Timmy rolls to Mr. Mackey's office, sighs and knocks.]
MR. MACKEY
[opens the door] Oh, hi Timmy. Come on in. [Timmy follows Mr. Mackey in] I understand you have somethin' important you wanna talk to me about, m'kay?
TIMMY
[leans forward and begins] Timmy.
MR. MACKEY
Well, Timmy, as your counselor, I want you to know that you can tell me anything, m'kay? And whatever's troublin' you, I wanna try and, and help you with it.
TIMMY
[sighs and begins again] Timmy.
MR. MACKEY
Mmm'kay, right, you're Timmy. ...Yo-you have a problem?
TIMMY
[shakes his head vigorously] No Timmy, Jimmy.
MR. MACKEY
Ji-Jimmy?
TIMMY
[showing his frustration] Haaa! [remembers something] Oh, oh! [wheels over to a class picture of the fourth graders. Jimmy is at one end of the front row, with Mr. Garrison behind him. Timmy reaches up and points] Jimmy.
MR. MACKEY
Oh, Jimmy Valmer! Oh, okay, what about him?
TIMMY
[rolls back and tries to get the story out with gestures. He demonstrates Jimmy asking for his bag] Timmah! Timmah, uh, Jimmih. [demonstrates himself handing the bag to Jimmy and seeing the contents fall out] Hey Timmy, Timmah Tim-oh! Tim-Timmah! [shows his reaction to the steroids] Timmmah? Jimmih! Jimmih. [demonstrates the argument between the two] Jimmih Timmah Timmah? Timmah, Timmah! Jimmih... Jimmih! Jimmih! Timmah! [demonstrates the bottle being dropped] Timmah!
MR. MACKEY
[confused] Mmmmm'kaaay. I don't quite follow, Timmy.
TIMMY
Argh. Jimmy...
MR. MACKEY
Right, Jimmy Valmer.
TIMMY
Uh. [demonstrates himself minding his own business when he sees Jimmy shooting up in the shadows], Timmah Jimmih Jimmih Jim- [demonstrates the injection, then flexes his muscles and takes a sinister tone] Jimmh Timmah Timmah Jimmih!
MR. MACKEY
Right. He's Jimmy, yeah.
TIMMY
[really frustrated] Haaaaaaaaaah!
[Cartman's room, night. Cartman types away at his computer. Screen reads: How I Will Spend My One Thousand Dollars By Eric Cartman. A knock on his door is heard.]
CARTMAN
Enter. [Kyle enters, and walks up next to Cartman]
KYLE
Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive. [they look at each other and Cartman closes a book he had open for reference]
CARTMAN
Go on, Kyle.
KYLE
I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!
CARTMAN
Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion of the Jew.
KYLE
I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul.
KYLE
I came here to talk about you!
CARTMAN
Yes. [hops off his seat and consoles Kyle] And instead you had to break through yourself. This is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life, Kyle. [whispers] Good luck. [after a few seconds, Kyle turns around and goes to leave. He opens the door, turns around to say something but instead walks out. Cartman just hums a tune, goes back to the computer and reads some more.]
[Jimmy's house. He's working out on a bench press in his room. A mirror sits next to him.]
JIMMY
Come on, push it! Push it! [he pushes the weights onto the bar rest and sits up. He checks his musculature out in the mirror] Yeah. Nice p-pecs. Sweet b-biceps. [the door opens and Nancy enters]
NANCY
Jimmy, I thought we were meeting at the doughnut shop.
JIMMY
The Games are in two days, Nancy. I can't be w-wasting my time.
NANCY
I guess I didn't realize I was a waste of time.
JIMMY
Oh Jesus! [lays back down and takes up the weights] You gonna start running your mouth off again? [begins new reps] P-push it! Push it!
NANCY
Jimmy, everyone's worried about you. You seem... different.
JIMMY
They-they're all just... jealous.
NANCY
You're not the boy I fell in love with last week during Free Period. I'm leaving you.
JIMMY
[quickly rests the weights and sits up] You're not leaving me! You try to leave me and I'll kill you, bitch!
NANCY
You can't treat people like this!
JIMMY
[gets up and walks over to Nancy, then begins beating her with his crutches. She wails] I said, shut your mouth, bitch! Why did you make me do it, huh?! [he grabs her by the throat and throws her head against the floor a few times, then whacks her on the side of the head a few times.] You're not leavin' anybody! You just keep your G-Goddamned mouth shut and do what you're t-t-t-uh-tol-told! [resumes beating her. His mom opens the door to see what's the matter]
SARAH
Jimmy What the? [tries to stop the beating] Jimmy, oh my God!
JIMMY
[uppercuts his mother off and heads for the door] Stay away from me, you stupid b-b-b-bitches! [walks down the hall, hits the walk with his right crutch, and breaks down.] No! God! [collapses on his back and bawls]
[Saturday morning at the Special Olympics stadium.]
HOST
Welcome, everyone, to the 2004 Special Olympics! [the crowd cheers. The boys are there, as promised] We will be holding various throughout the day, and at the end of it all we will have some very special celebrity athletes here to present the trophy for top athlete, along with the cash prize of one thousand dollars.
JIMMY
[flexes his right bicep] Top athlete, yeah!
CARTMAN
One thousand dollars, yeah!
HOST
So let's have all our athletes report to their first assigned events and... Let the Games begin! [The crowd cheers wildly]
[First event, Track and Field, 100-meter dash.]
ANNOUNCER
Will those athletes in heat 1 of the hundred-meter dash please report to Track Area B.
VOLUNTEER 2
Okay, racers, are we ready? [raises her firing pistol] Take your marks.
CARTMAN
[hobbles into the fifth position on the track] Daaaa! Daaaa!
VOLUNTEER 2
On your marks! Get set! Go! [the runners take off. Cartman quickly falls behind]
CARTMAN
Whoa. What the hell?? [the girl in position 6 breaks the tape. Cartman hobbles past the finish line four seconds later]
VOLUNTEER 2
Great job, everyone. [points to the runners who were in positions 6, 2, and 4] You three advance to the next heat. [the group leaves]
WINNER
All right!
BLOND BOY
Good Job.
BLONDE GIRL
We did it!
CARTMAN
Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events.
["Put It To The Limit" begins to play again. Cartman is in a swimming competition now, but again, he's struggling in last place. Jimmy lifts a bar laden with weights successfully in the clean-and-jerk competition, then throws the bar down.]
JIMMY
Yeeessss! [walks back and forth happily] Yes! Yes!
ANNOUNCER
He's got it! That's a new Special Olympics record, folks! [Timmy is understandably unimpressed and pissed off]
[Back to Track and Field events, 100-meter hurdles. Cartman is again last.]
CARTMAN
[trips over a hurdle] God-damnit!
[Back to Swimming events. Jimmy takes his heat easily.]
ANNOUNCER
Winner, Jimmy Valmer! [Jimmy flexes his left arm and scrambles out of the water. Timmy is more pissed off]
[Track and Field events, pole-vault. a Special Olympian runs up to the posts, plants his pole in the square mark, and clears the bar successfully. Cartman steps up to the straight track with his pole.]
CARTMAN
All right, this one I can win! [drops his pole, takes off his helmet and gives it to another athlete] Here, hold this! [takes up his pole and aims] I'll show you Goddamned retards! [runs up to the posts, plants his pole, and sails up, but the pole won't straighten out. It flexes a few time before it breaks, sending Cartman back down to the track, where he lands on his back]
[Track and Field events, 100-meter hurdles. Jimmy increases his lead over the competition.]
[Track and Field events, javelin throw. An athlete runs up to the edge and throws his javelin. His tongue hangs out. Timmy rolls up and throws his javelin. Cartman runs up and throws his, but it lands just far enough for him to still touch the tail end of it.]
CARTMAN
God-damnit!
[Track and Field events, triple jump. Jimmy jumps and lands at 18.5 feet, skids a foot more, then stops and waits for the score.]
ANNOUNCER
That's another Special Olympics record!
JIMMY
[raises his arms and crutches up in victory] Yeah! Yeah! [turns around] Yeah, I did it! [turns around] Yeah! Yeah!
[Early evening at the Special Olympics stadium. The sun has set and some of the crowd is back on the field.]
HOST
Ladies and Gentlemen, our day of competition has come to an end, and we have an ultimate grand special champion for 2004! Here to present the award are baseball legends Mark McGuire, Jason Giambi, and Barry Bonds. [the three players come out and walk to the podium. All of them are buff]
BONDS
The 2004 special athlete is... Jimmy Valmer.
JIMMY
[raises up his left arm and crutch] Yeah! Fuck yeah! [Timmy sits nearby with his arms crossed, glaring at Jimmy. Jimmy walks up to the podium] Yeah, I did it! I'm the b-bub-best! [Bonds hands Jimmy the medal. The host returns to the podium]
HOST
Congratulations, Jimmy. But we all know that the Special Olympics isn't just about winning. And so, we will now give out the Spirit Award, to the handicapped person who came in very last. Eric Cartman!
CARTMAN
Ah, screw you hippies!
HOST
For winning the Spirit Award, Eric will receive this gift certificate to Shakey's for fifty dollars! Come on up, Eric!
CARTMAN
...I could pile at Shakey's, heck. [puts on his helmet and walks up] Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!
JIMMY
[confronts Cartman] Hey! Just what the hell do you think you're doing, Eric?!
CARTMAN
[humbly] Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh.
JIMMY
You f-f f-faked being handicapped to win?! [grabs Cartman by the collar] I should kick your ass right here, you lousy no-good ch-ch-cheater!
TIMMY
[approaches] Timmah!
JIMMY
What?
TIMMY
[points to Jimmy] Timmah!
JIMMY
[thinks a moment] Oh my God. You-you're right, Timmy. You're totally right. [walks up to the mic and begins talking]
JIMMY
Everyone, can I have your attention, please? [everyone falls silent] I'm afraid I have to give back my medal. The truth is, I haven't been playing fair either. I've been using st-steroids. I was willing to do anything to be the best, and the steroids made me blind to the people I was hurting. [a shot of Nancy, injured and taped around the head. She smiles] A good friend even tried to talk me out of it, and I wouldn't listen to him. [a shot of Timmy, who smiles and shows off his silver medal. Others around him wear bronzes.] Taking steroids is just like pretending to be handicapped at the Special Olympics. [a shot of a chastened Cartman before the baseball players]
JIMMY
Because you're taking all the fairness out of the game. But I know now that even if you do win on steroids, you're really not a winner. You're just a p-pussy. You're just a [shot of Mark McGuire] big fat p-p-pussy, and if you take steroids, the only decent thing to do is come forward and say, [shot of Barry Bonds] "Remove me from the record books, because I am a big, stinky p-pussy- " [shot of Jason Giambi] "-steroid-taking jackass." [Giambi nods ever so subtly] That's how I feel about myself, and why I must decline this medal and my place in the history books. And if you'll let me, I'll be back next year. To compete with honor. [applause rises from the stands, followed by cheers. The volunteers and baseball players gather around Jimmy]
MCGUIRE
Hey kid. Good for you for being honest.
[The stands. Cartman walks up to his friends.]
CARTMAN
Well guys, I guess now you see what I was up to all along. I dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the Special Olympics on purpose, so that Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids. [he looks at Kyle and then Stan for a reaction, but neither offers any. He frowns, then steps forward angrily] Eh, oh yeah?! We- well you guys are assholes! [straightens up] Grow up! [walks off in a huff]
End of Up the Down Steroid


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Kyle finally sees the blockbuster movie "The Passion of the Christ" and admits that Cartman has been right about the Jewish people all along.

script:The Passion of the Jew

[Cartman's house, day. A minivan rocks gently on the street. Inside, the boys make their interpretations of spaceship noises. Being the good boys that they are, they're strapped in. They're wearing football helmets and makeshift Starfleet uniforms.]
CARTMAN
[in the driver's seat] Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity. Approaching planet Omega Nine.
STAN
Warp drive disengaged. Landing sequence initiated.
CARTMAN
What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?
KYLE
I'm a Vulcan!
CARTMAN
All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?
KYLE
[looking into an imaginary viewer] The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing.
CARTMAN
All right, hang on. We're about to land. [the boys make landing noises, with Stan finishing off with a thump. Cartman removes his seatbelt] Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.
KYLE
No! I'm on the away team too! [he and Kenny remove their belts]
CARTMAN
[looks back] It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle!
KYLE
I don't care! You're not making me wait in the van again!
CARTMAN
Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.
[The side door slides open. Cartman leads the other three out.]
CARTMAN
Set phasers on stun.
STAN
Things seem pretty quiet.
CARTMAN
Yes. A little too quiet.
KYLE
I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge. [Cartman sighs silently]
CARTMAN
Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!! Look out! It's a giant four-headed lava frog! Shoot it! [the boys take their positions and start firing away] Oh no, it got Kyle!
KYLE
[stops firing and stands still] No it doesn't. [the other boys continue with their phaser noises]
CARTMAN
Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off! [pretends to be the monster ripping Kyle's head off] Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for!
KYLE
No I'm not! God damn it Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!
CARTMAN
Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along!
KYLE
Shut up about Jews, fatass! You don't know anything!
STAN
Oh God, here we go again.
CARTMAN
Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil!
KYLE
He does not!
CARTMAN
How do you know?! I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't seen it once! There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it.
KYLE
Naw uh!
CARTMAN
Go see the movie, Kyle!
STAN
That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here.
KENNY
(Me too!) [they leave]
KYLE
I'm not arguing about The Passion! He's being an asshole!
CARTMAN
You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you.
KYLE
People don't hate the Jews!
CARTMAN
[focuses Kyle's attention to him] Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson.
KYLE
...You're a stupid asshole! [turns and walks off. Cartman turns left and glances at Kyle]
CARTMAN
Sweet, now I can just play with myself. [fires off his phaser] Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the shuttlecraft! [races into the minivan]
[The Bijou, day. Mel Gibson's The Passion of The Christ is now playing. Kyle walks up to the ticket booth, stops, turns back, stops again, and steps up to the window. He gives the ticket salesman $10.]
KYLE
One please.
TICKET SALESMAN
This is an R-rated movie.
KYLE
Yeah, I know, but I have to-
TICKET SALESMAN
But, because this is such an important film that actually depicts the selfless act of Jesus Christ, I'll let you in to see it.
KYLE
...Thanks. [makes his way towards the doors, glancing back at the cashier in wonder]
[The Bijou, inside. Kyle enters and makes his way to a seat. He watches.]
SOLDIER 1
Hac bashtud Christo.
SOLDIER 2
Et lac Hesus. Belaca veshtad.
JESUS
Wa! [the whipping begins and Jesus screams. This goes on for a long time. Kyle's mouth widens, his eyes get bigger. The next scene, he's got his coat over his mouth and he's almost in a fetal position. The next scene has him turned to his left, grimacing, his hat pulled over his ears as he winces. The next scene has him trembling]
KYLE
Haaaah! [Next scene has Kyle with his eyes squeezed shut and his hands over his face. He's now curled up in a ball]
JESUS
Non. Non. Nono, non, non, WAAAAHH!! [the whipping continues and Kyle dares to peek again. His stomach reacts and he vomits. The next scene has him almost passed out with vomit dribbling from his chin. The film ends and Kyle doesn't move.]
[The Bijou, outside. Kyle walks outside in a daze.]
KYLE
How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus?
TICKET SALESMAN
Pretty brutal, isn't it? Kinda wanna make you change your life, huh?
[Cartman's house, day. He's on the couch eating cereal.]
ANNOUNCER
And now, back to Terrance and Phillip. [the doorbell rings]
PHILLIP
Hey Terrance, I think I have a-
CARTMAN
Mom! Doorbell!
TERRANCE
Wait, before you do, pull my thumb. [a second laughter and laughter is heard.]
CARTMAN
[the doorbell rings] Mom! Answer the door!
TERRANCE
Hey Phillip, guess what?
CARTMAN
God damn it, lazy-ass whore. [gets up and answers the door himself.]
PHILLIP
What?
TERRANCE
Faaart.[Terrance farts. Cartman opens the door and sees Kyle soaking wet from the heavy rain]
KYLE
You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know.
CARTMAN
It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again?
KYLE
You were, you were right?
CARTMAN
[closes his eyes and relishes the moment] Mmm, one more time, Kyle.
KYLE
You were right. [Cartman opens his eyes and beams brightly]
[Cartman's house, his bedroom. Cartman's on his knees.]
CARTMAN
I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done. [a shot of Mel Gibson's poster, without the "Braveheart" on it.] Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen.
[Stan's house. He and Kenny are in his bedroom reading a newspaper.]
STAN
Look at that, dude. The Passion has made almost 400 million dollars at the box office now.
KENNY
(Goddamn.)
STAN
[rises] Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie. I guess... we have to go see it too.
[The Bijou, day. No clouds around. Stan and Kenny sit inside in the middle, looking at the movie. The movie ends.]
STAN
Dude. That movie sucked.
KENNY
(Yeah, it totally sucked!)
STAN
How can they even call that a movie?
KENNY
(I don't know!)
STAN
That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back.
KENNY
(Yeah!) [they leave their seats]
[The Bijou, outside. A couple emerges.]
JACK
Wow, I didn't realize how horrible Christ's death was.
ELISE
Me neither. Oh honey, let's be good Christians from now on! [they walk off, screen left. A second couple emerges]
MAN 1
[brown shirt, green sweater] I think if more people saw The Passion they'd have faith in Jesus.
WOMAN 1
[orange blouse, necklace] Yeah, it really guilt-trips you into believing. [they walk off, screen right. Stan and Kenny come out and approach the window]
STAN
Hey, we want our money back.
TICKET SALESMAN
Huh?
STAN
That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars.
TICKET SALESMAN
I can't refund your money. You sat through the whole movie.
STAN
That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!
KENNY
(Yeah!)
STAN
You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!
TICKET SALESMAN
That guy happened to be Jesus, and he went through all that to pay for your sins!
STAN
We go to church to learn that stuff! We go to movies to be entertained! We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!
TICKET SALESMAN
I'm not allowed to give you your money back after you sat through the whole movie! You'd have to take your complaint up with the film's producers.
STAN
W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson?
TICKET SALESMAN
Yeah. I'd like to see you try.
STAN
Oh, we will! This is America! And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back! Come on, Kenny! [he and Kenny storm off]
[Kyle's house, night. Kyle tosses and turns while asleep. Scenes from the movie fill his mind: Jesus carrying the cross past the high priests, who have scowling faces. Flashes of Renaissance Passion art go by.]
PRIESTS
Kill him! Guilty! Kill him! [sketches of a nail driven through the left palm are animated, then a realistic view of Jesus crucified] Kill him! Kill him! Die!
KYLE
Kill Jesus! Yesss! Arrrgh! [a spear pierces Jesus' side. The one piercing him is Kyle himself, who seems to be relishing this, as he pierces Jesus a few more times. A review of images, then an image of Alan Alda, and Kyle wakes up frightened. After a few screams he looks around]
[Stan's house, day. Stan and Kenny are at Stan's computer.]
STAN
Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go. [clicks on the link] Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com, your source for everything Mel. Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects. Damn it, no phone number! Oh wait! "For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.." Okay, okay, wait, here we go. [picks up the phone and dials in]
[MEL GIBSON FAN CLUB LINE]
[The phone rings. Cartman answers.]
CARTMAN
Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club.
STAN
Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion.
CARTMAN
Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m.
STAN
No, no, no, no, we want our money back.
CARTMAN
What?
STAN
We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him?
CARTMAN
You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes.
STAN
Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!
CARTMAN
If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick.
STAN
Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass!
CARTMAN
Oh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall!
STAN
I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me!
CARTMAN
Bitch?! Don't call me bitch! I'll pop your fuckin' head open!
STAN
Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!
CARTMAN
I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!
STAN
[in recognition] Wait a minute. Cartman?! [realizing he's been recognized, Cartman is speechless]
CARTMAN
Eup. [hangs up and skulks away]
STAN
[packing] Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu!
KENNY
(Malibu? But how?)
STAN
We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore. This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible! [He leads Kenny out of his room] This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!
[Cartman's house, day. Cartman dons a Nazi outfit, taking care to look sharp.]
LIANE
Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting?
CARTMAN
Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did.
LIANE
Oh, that's great, sweetie.
CARTMAN
[turns right so his profile will look sharp as well] Tell them I'll be down shortly
LIANE
Okay, hon.
CARTMAN
[wields his short whip]Töten sie die Juden. Wir können nicht still stehen bis sie alle tot sind! Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson. [a shot of the poster.]
[Cartman's backyard. Some people are seated, others chat, others help themselves to chips and fingerfoods.]
MAN 1
Hello, are you folks holding this Passion meeting?
JACK
No. Actually, we're guests as well. I'm Jack Garrett and this is my wife Elise.
ELISE
Hello.
MAN 2
I think it's so great that someone took the initiative to have a meeting like this.
ELISE
Oh I agree. There are so many of us who are moved by The Passion. It's a perfect idea to have us organize so we can strengthen the Christian community.
MAN 2
And apparently the organizer is just an eight year old boy who was touched by the film.
JACK
Leave it to a child to show us all the way, huh?
TICKET SALESMAN
Yeah, so I see this ad on the Internet saying if you love The Passion to come to this meeting, so here I am!
WOMAN 2
It's great that everyone came here to figure out how to use The Passion to enrich everyone's lives. [Cartman approaches the dais.]
CARTMAN
Ah, hello everyone. Achtung. [the last few standing people take their seats] My name is Eric Cartman and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club. [applause] Ah thank you, thank you. I'm happy to see that all of you.were affected by The Passion like I was. Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done.
WOMAN 3
[in pink dress] We sure do. [the crowd voices its approval]
CARTMAN
But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps. [the guests fall silent]
ELISE
[in orange blouse] Wha- what does that mean, sweetie?
JACK
I'm not sure, but- uh. [stands up] Folks, I just wanna interrupt for a second and say how remarkable it is that this little boy brought us all together. The Passion is causing a revolution of spirituality, and we owe Mel Gibson and this little boy our thanks. [the crowd voices its approval]
CARTMAN
[bows a few times] Thank you, thank you very much. Now, in order to do what we [his face turns ugly] all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion.
MAN 3
Oh, what a great idea! We each make it our responsibility to convert one more person!
GUESTS
Heheh, great! Yeah! Great idea.
CARTMAN
Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean.
TICKET SALESMAN
We sure do!
GUESTS
Yeah. All right. Woohoo!
[Mel's Malibu mansion, day. A rusty Beetle rolls up to the front security gate, stops, and lets out some passengers, then rolls away. Stan and Kenny remain.]
STAN
Thank you. [looks over his Map To The Stars' Homes] This must be the place. [they walk through a side door right under a guard's nose. He fails to notice them. They walk up the driveway and past the massive fountain] Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded. [rings the doorbell. The door opens and Mel appears]
MEL
Yes?
STAN
Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny.
KENNY
(Hello.)
STAN
Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?
MEL
You can't not like The Passion! I just followed the Bible! Christ died for you. Go home. [leaves, but the boys follow him in.]
[Mel Gibson's mansion, inside.]
STAN
Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money.
MEL
Oh yeah? Well you're gonna have to find it first. [unbuttons his shirt] But I won't tell you where I keep my money. [takes off his shirt] You can torture me all you want, I still won't tell you!
STAN
Tor- torture you?
MEL
[removes his pants and socks] Ha! So you do intend to torture me, huh?! [runs up to a torture rack and lies down in it] Well go ahead! Do your worst! [shackles himself in] You still won't get your ticket money back! I can take whatever you can dish out!
STAN
We don't want to torture you.
MEL
I get it, but you don't have a choice, is that it?! Well go ahead! I just sure hope you don't use those whips over there on the wall!
STAN
Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?
MEL
[unshackles himself and walks up to the boys] I have to use that money to build my church! I brought the fire and brimstone back to Christianity with The Passion and now I'm gonna start my own church! And do you know why?! So I can play banjo! [whips out a hat and banjo, puts on the hat, and starts playing] Jesus, oh how I love ya, how I love ya Jesus!
STAN
Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy!
MEL
How dare you call me crazy! This means war! [jumps up and whoops like an Indian, twirls around a few times, and fires off blanks at the boys. Stan and Kenny run]
[South Park Church, rectory. Fr. Maxi sits at his desk explaining things to Kyle.]
FATHER MAXI
And so it was that God sent his only son down from heaven, to die for our sins.
KYLE
Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over.
FATHER MAXI
...What is troubling you, my child?
KYLE
Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord.
FATHER MAXI
Ah! You mean he's a Jew!
KYLE
Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night.
FATHER MAXI
Yes, The Passion is very powerful. The truth is, there's not a whole lot in the Bible about the Crucifixion. The Passion was actually done as a performance piece back in the Middle Ages to incite people against the Jews.
KYLE
But how can the Jews make it better??
FATHER MAXI
Well, if you really care about your friend's soul, then perhaps show him the way of Jesus. Remember: Christianity is about atonement.
KYLE
Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course. [gets off the chair] I know what I have to do now. Thank you, Father. [turns and walks out]
[Back at Mel's mansion, Stan and Kenny are still running from Mel, who's chasing after them in a cartoonish way. Mel passes a mirror, then gets back to it a second later.]
STAN AND KENNY
Aaaah!
MEL
Two days ago, I saw a vehicle that would haul that tanker. You wanna get outta here? Talk to me. [resumes hopping like a mad rabbit]
STAN
Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude! [catches a glimpse of a wallet on a table] Wait! There's his wallet! [runs up to it with Kenny]
MEL
Freedom! [Stan grabs the wallet and rifles through it]
STAN
Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny? [Kenny hands Stan $2]
MEL
Jesus is Lord! [Stan puts the $2 in and takes out $20]
STAN
All right, let's get the hell out of here! [heads for the doors and opens one. Mel dances in wearing a Carmen Miranda outfit. Stan and Kenny head for another pair of doors. Stan opens it and Mel enters dressed as a clown]
MEL
When you're a clown, nobody takes you seriously!
[Outside.]
STAN
Aah! Run, dude, run!
MEL
[hopping out behind them, in Braveheart face paint and wielding a sword] K'plagh! K'plagh! And good evening, frieeeeeeends!
[The Bijou, day. A large cross is erected atop the Bijou sign. A crowd gathers and acclaims it.]
CARTMAN
One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message! [some applause] Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world! [the crowd applauds] Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie!
TICKET SALESMAN
Woah! Great idea!
MAN 3
It'll be like a parade!
MAN 4
Good idea!
CARTMAN
And as we march for The Passion we should also voice our support! So, when I say "Es ist Zeit für Säuberung," you all chant back "Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten."
ELISE
Well, what does that mean, dear?
JACK
Oh, I think it's Aramaic. You know, like in the movie.
TICKET SALESMAN
Ooo, Aramaic. Cool.
TOWNSFOLK
Neato! That'll be awesome. Great!
JACK
What was our Aramaic line again?
CARTMAN
[pounds the table a few times] Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! [his hair gets messed up from the impacts]
TOWNSFOLK
[repeats, gaining confidence with each syllable] Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
CARTMAN
Es ist Zeit fër Rache!
TOWNSFOLK
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
ELISE
Oh, this is fun! [smiles]
CARTMAN
[picks a mark in front of the crowd] All right, everyone! Forward, march! [they all move forward] Es ist Zeit für Rache!
TOWNSFOLK
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
CARTMAN
Es ist Zeit für Rache!
TOWNSFOLK
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
CARTMAN
Nice.
[A synagogue. A service is going on, and the synagogue is full.]
RABBI
Shalom hak nak shalom. And now one of our fine young shlokas, Kyle Broflovski, has asked if he could speak to the congregation. [Kyle approaches the lectern]
KYLE
Thank you, rabbi. [Sheila smiles and gets Gerald's attention. Kyle clears his throat.] In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus.
MAN 4
What? [others murmur their shock]
SHEILA
Whatwhatwhaaat?!
KYLE
If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it.
MAN 5
Oh my God! [the other congregants groan]
GERALD
Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?!
KYLE
I saw The Passion!
MAN 6
Oh no! The Passion?! [others murmur]
MAN 7
This proves the anti-Semitic effect that movie is having!
MAN 8
Yeah, it makes Jews into stereotypes.
MAN 9
Stereotyping Jews is terrible.
WOMAN 4
Something must be done to stop that movie!
RABBI
Now, now, everyone calm down. We live in a rational community, and everyone knows this is just a movie. There's no cause for alarm.
MOB
[from outside] Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!
CARTMAN
[from outside] Es ist Zeit für Rache! [congregants rise and face the doors in the back, others look out the windows. They see Cartman leading a march past the synagogue]
MOB
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!
CARTMAN
Es ist Zeit für Rache!
MOB
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten! [the rabbi and his congregants look on, confused]
CARTMAN
Es ist Zeit für Rache!
[The southwest, desert territory. A tour bus heads east, with Stan and Kenny riding inside.]
STAN
Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson. [net loss, sixty-nine dollars] But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters.
KENNY
(Yeah. I agree.) [a truck horn blows and Stan stands to see who it is. Kenny joins him]
STAN
Oh, you've got to be shittin' me. [Mel Gibson closes in fast in his Mad Max gas truck and wearing Braveheart face paint]
MEL
Give me back my money! [blows his horn again]
STAN
Goddamn, that guy's crazy. [hops off his seat and runs up to the driver] Hey dude, you've gotta speed up.
DRIVER
Huh?
STAN
Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster.
DRIVER
Haha, very funny, kid. Sit down and stop playing games.
STAN
I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna- [Mel plows into the bus, making both vehicles screech. The riders sway in their seats]
DRIVER
What the hell?
MEL
[shaking his fist in the air] Haaaa! K'Plaaaa!
DRIVER
Hey! That's Mel Gibson!
STAN
Yeah. I told you that!
DRIVER
Well, what the hell does he want?!
STAN
He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it.
DRIVER
You didn't like The Passion? But it shows how Christ suffered for you. Mel Gibson is a very spiritual man. [Mel rams into them again]
[The Bijou, night. The synagogue's congregation moves quickly down the street towards the theater.]
KYLE
[to his parents] Both you guys, stop! Please. You're gonna make people hate us more!
TICKET SALESMAN
Can I help you?
RABBI
This movie is causing anti-Semitism! You must remove it from your theater!
CONGREGANTS
That's right! Yeah! Remove your movie!
SHLOMO
Remove it from the theater? Fat chance!
MAN 10
We demand you stop showing it!
CONGREGANTS
Yeah! Yeah!
KYLE
[facing the congregants] No, no, no! Don't become an angry mob! [behind him Cartman is seen leading his mob to the theater] The last time we did that we killed Jesus!
CARTMAN
[points] Juden!
JACK
What's going on here?
TICKET SALESMAN
They're trying to have The Passion pulled from the theater.
RABBI
This film is anti-Semitic and it must be stopped!
MAN 11
Nonsense! Mel Gibson is a smart and spiritual man! There's nothing anti-Semitic about it!
ELISE
It has reaffirmed all of our faith in Christ.
RABBI
It's made one of our little Jewish boys want to apologize for the death of Jesus!
JACK
Well, maybe you should apologize.
MOB
That's right! What he said.
WOMAN 5
How dare you?! [the sound of a truck is faintly heard, but gets stronger.]
KYLE
[noticing] Look out!! [The crowds move to the other side of the street as the tour bus skids to a stop just past the theater. Mel Gibson roars into town and crashes into the ticket booth, and his gas truck blows up. The crowds crawl out of their safety places and merge]
MEL
Give me my eighteen dollars!
CARTMAN
Mel! Gibson! [brightens and approaches him, then grovels at his feet] Oh mein Savior! Mein Führer! You're actually here! Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses! We are ready to do thy bidding! [grovels some more] Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?!
MEL
Ha! [ignores Cartman and walks up to Stan and Kenny] So! You boys have led me here to your secret base, huh? I guess now you're gonna start torturing me! Well! [grabs his nipples and falls on his knees. The crowd steps back as he twists his nipples] Oh, my nipples are so tender! Don't squeeze them anymore!
TICKET SALESMAN
That's... Mel Gibson?
JACK
H- he's not... quite as eloquent as I had pictured.
MEL
[backs up towards a building] Yeah... [grabs a piece of crap from his ass and removes it from his briefs, turns around, and defaces the building] I'll bet you wanna torture me now, don't you?!
KYLE
[joins Stan and Kenny] Dude, what's wrong with him?
STAN
He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind.
MEL
You! You would all love to torture me, wouldn't you? [gets down on all fours and hoists his ass up] Okay, fine. See what you can fit in there, I can take it!
KYLE
Dude! I've been freaked out this whole time because of that guy's movie?
MEL
[rises and walks up to the boys] Fine! If nobody here is man enough to torture me, then just give me my eighteen dollars!
STAN
It's our eighteen dollars! Your movie sucked!
MEL
You can't say my movie sucked, or else you're saying Christianity sucked!
STAN
No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.
JACK
You know, he's right, Elise. We shouldn't focus our faith on the torture and execution of Christ.
TICKET SALESMAN
Yeah. Lots of people got crucified in those times. We shouldn't rely on violence to inspire faith.
CARTMAN
Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!
KYLE
Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche. [a grinning Mel squats and farts on Cartman, defecating on Cartman]
MEL
Woohoohoo! Woohoohoohoohoo! [hops towards the camera.]
End of The Passion of the Jew


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Stan just got served, and now it's up to him to put together a team of South Park's best dancers to compete against a troupe from Orange County.

script:You Got F'd in the A

[The True Value parking lot somewhere in South Park, day. The boys are playing with motorized toy cars.]
CARTMAN
Dude, these little remote-controlled cars are kickass. [a car goes up a ramp and jumps off]
KYLE
Sweet. I made mine go off the jump. [Stan's car is uncooperative]
STAN
Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one. [some kids come up behind Stan]
KYLE
Hey, who are those kids?
[Stan and Cartman turn to see. The crew of five approaches and stop. Their leader, dressed in grays, steps forth with his boombox and sets it down, presses "Play," and steps back into the crew. A rap begins to play and the crew begins to dance.]
BOOMBOX
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you...! Let's see you...!
Let's see you...! Let's see you...!
Daaance, sucka!
[brief instrumental]
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you daaance-
OC LEADER
Yeah, how you like that y'all! [Stan and his friends merely look on]
OC MEMBER 1
[dressed in red] Let's bring it to these losers.
OC GIRL
Aww yeah!
[The OC crew leader dances forward and does some gymnastics moves in Stan's face.]
OC LEADER
Whatchoo got, huh?! You got nothin'!
[The OC crew leader does some more moves and steps back into his crew.]
OC LEADER
Damn! You just got served!
[His crew agrees with him. Stan and his friends don't move. The crew member dressed in red steps forward and dances in Kyle's face.]
OC LEADER
Aww man!
[One of the dancers twirls on his head and ends in a challenging pose.]
OC GIRL
He got you, dude.
OC LEADER
Now that kid is gettin' served!
OC GIRL
Uh huh.
[The dancer in red stands on his left hand and challenges Kyle with his groin.]
OC
Whoa!
[The dancer rolls away and stands on his right hand, rolls back and rests on his left side, then dances away.]
OC LEADER
Aww man, look at them! They know they can't trip to that! [the girl turns the radio off and the dancers turn and walk away.] Yeah! We're outta here!
OC MEMBER 2
[in gray-green, looks left] That was smokin'!
OC MEMBER 1
[looks right] They didn't do nothin'!
OC MEMBER 3
[Asian, turns around] Sorry y'all, but try not to let it sting too bad! [laughs and turns around]
OC LEADER
[turns around] You got served! [the others laugh and he turns around] Come on! They had nothin'! Let's go y'all!
OC MEMBER
Come on y'all! [...and they're gone]
KYLE
...What the hell just happened?
[Chef's house, later. Stan rings the doorbell.]
CHEF
[opens up] Oh. Hello there, children!
STAN
Chef, we just got served.
CHEF
Oh boy... Well come on inside, children. I'll make you some cocoa.
[Chef's house, living room. Chef shows the children to the couch.]
CHEF
Have a seat, children. Just try to relax and breathe. [the boys sit down] Are you all okay?
KYLE
Yeah.
CHEF
All right. Now, where did you get served?
STAN
Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess-
CHEF
Okay okay, relax children. Relax. It's all over now. Just try to calm down and sit tight. [turns around and picks up the phone] I'm gonna call your parents and let them know you're okay. [taps out a number and the phone rings] Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently, they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it.
[Stan's house, that night. The family is at the dining table. Sharon brings a large dish over to Stan.]
SHARON
Here, Stanley, I made your favorite potato dish. I want you to feel better, okay?
RANDY
What's the matter with him?
SHARON
Oh. Stan got served at school today.
RANDY
You got served? By who?
STAN
Some, kids from Orange County.
SHARON
Let's not make a big deal out of it.
RANDY
So wha- so what'd you do? D'you dance back?
STAN
No.
RANDY
What? Yo-you got served and just stood there and took it?
SHARON
That was the right thing to do.
RANDY
No, that's crap, Sharon. Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance, you have to dance back at them, or else they'll think you're weak.
STAN
But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'.
RANDY
[in low tones] Well then, it's about time you learned! [rises from the table] Put on some loose-fitting clothes and meet me in the garage!
STAN
But Dad-
RANDY
Now! [walks off]
[Stan's house, garage. Stan and Randy are present. Randy is dressed in sweats, Stan is dressed in sweat pants and a sleeveless T-shirt. Randy puts a CD into a stereo system.]
RANDY
All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye and give 'em this.
["Achy-Breaky Heart" begins to play, and Randy begins to dance and starts to sing. Stan looks on.]
RANDY
Come on, Stan.
[Stan steps closer and begins to follow Randy's moves.]
RANDY
...six, seven, eight.
[Stan steps out of a slipper, but slips back into it quickly.]
[South Park, day, Luau's Toys. Stan and his friends exit and walk down the street.]
KYLE
Dude, that is a sweet RC car!
STAN
[carrying the car] Yeah, let's go race it right now![they run into the OC kids]
OC MEMBER 2
Well, what we got here?
OC MEMBER 1
It's the white boys that were served yesterday. [they laugh]
OC LEADER
You want a little more, homeboys?
KYLE
We're not interested, thanks.
OC MEMBER 1
[steps forth] You're not interested? Not interested in this?
[The OC member waits for the boombox to play, then dances in Kyle's face, including a back flip. All of the OC crew members begin to dance.]
BOOMBOX
You can't step to my roots, so don't try it.
You can’t burn with my group so don’t light it.
I'm on the OC crew and I'm better than you.
You like to suck my balls, don't deny it.
You can't bop her like me so don't go there.
You never find a bigger bitch player nowhere.
I put my jimmy in a ho, put off soul.
I'm a good listener and that's rare.
BLACK MAN
Oh Lord, look at those moves.
BLACK WOMAN
Oooo, they are takin' it out!
BLACK MAN 2
Oh man, they are getting served!
BLACK WOMAN 2
Ooooo, it's getting hot out here!
BLACK MAN 3
Have mercy!
[The dancers edge closer and closer to the South Park boys.]
OTHERS
Oooooo, look at that! Lord! Gettin' served!
[The rap music is turned off and the OC crew turns to see who did it. Stan puts in his CD and prepares to serve the OC boys. "Achy Breaky Heart" plays and Stan dances the steps he learned the night before. The crowds behind both groups look on for a while, then begin to cheer Stan on. Chef is walking down the street minding his own business, but he looks over at the commotion, and his jaw drops.]
KYLE
Yeah! Go Stan!
CHEF
Oh no! [begins to cross the street] No, stop Stan! You don't know what you're doin'!
[The OC crew is speechless. The song ends. Stan looks around and smiles. Kenny, Cartman, and the crowd applaud Stan. Kyle pats Stan on the back. The OC kids look like they just got served.]
KYLE
All right Stan!
CARTMAN
Ha! You just got f'd in the a!
OC LEADER
Wha?
KYLE
Yeah! You got served!
KENNY
(Woohoo!)
CARTMAN
Yeah!
KYLE
That's right!
CARTMAN
All right!
KENNY
(Woohoo!)
CHEF
[arrives] No no no!
OC LEADER
Okay. All right. We got served. So now, I guess... It's on.
STAN
What?
OC MEMBER 1
This Saturday! Our top five dancers against your top five dancers! OC Convention Center. It's on!
OC MEMBERS
It's on! It's on! It's on! It's on!
TOWNSMAN
[closes his eyes and laments] Oh Lord it's on!
CHEF
Oh dammit! I knew that was gonna happen.
OC MEMBER 3
We'll see you Saturday, fools! [the crowd behind the OC crew parts and they leave]
OC MEMBERS
Yeah, and you'd better have a lot better dancers with you than those loozas! 'Cause, it's on!
OC MEMBERS
It's on! It's on! It's on! It's on!
[The crowd begins to murmur about Saturday and the competition.]
CHEF
Stan, what the hell did you dance back for?
STAN
I thought I was supposed to!
CHEF
Now you've gotta compete against them in the dance competition on Saturday!
STAN
But why?
CHEF
Because if you get served and served them back, then it's on! Don't you know anything??
[Stan's house, breakfast nook. Randy is filling out checks for his bills.]
SHARON
[enters the kitchen with Stan] Well, nice going, Randy! Really great advice you gave our son here!
RANDY
[turns around] What?
SHARON
Those kids showed up to serve Stan again and he danced back!
RANDY
So what happened?
SHARON
It's on!
[Stan looks helplessly at his father as his mother drags him off. Randy looks on.]
[OC Convention Center, day. A large screen over the Center says "Bounce" while a sign closer to the viewer says "This Saturday, 7 PM, Orange County VS. South Park, Dance Competition. It's On!!!!" Inside, preparations are made for the competition. On the floor, the OC crew practices its move under their coach's supervision.]
COACH
Come on now, keep it tight!
[The OC leader and the member in red drop backward and then spin on their heads, the girl spins on her left hand]
COACH
Good. Now watch that timing, Gil T!
[In the background Randy appears and walks through one of the many doors. The crew finishes with a flourish. The members then congratulate themselves.]
OC MEMBER 1
All right!
OC GIRL
[stands] All right!
OC LEADER
Yeah, bad ass!
OC MEMBER 2
Yeah, that was tight!
COACH
Not bad, kids. Not bad. [Randy approaches]
OC MEMBER 1
Not bad? South Park doesn't stand a chance!
OC GIRL
I heard that!
COACH
All right, it was good. But we don't want "good," we want pain!
RANDY
Uh, hey, ex- excuse me.
COACH
[turns around] Yeah?
RANDY
Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh. I'm Stan Marsh's father.
COACH
Oh, so you're the father of the boy who's gonna get f'd in the a on Saturday?
OC MEMBER 3
Dang!
OC LEADER
Oooooo!
RANDY
Uh, listen. Uh, it was my fault that Stanley served your boys the other day. Uh, I told him to do it and I... We- well look I, I just came down here to tell you... it- it- it's not on.
COACH
Oh, it's on!
RANDY
No, no, no, it's not on.
COACH
Whoo, it's on all right!
RANDY
It isn't on. Nothing's on. It's off.
COACH
[insistent] It's on!
RANDY
I'm keeping my son home Saturday. I just came by to let you know so you can... put a stop to all this. Goodbye. [turns around and walks away]
COACH
Hold on a second, clam-head! [catches him and blocks his way] You think you can just roll in here and tell us it's not on when it very clearly is on?! You're just trying to make us not practice, aren't you?! Because you know that your kids are goin' down when my kids give them this! Give me some moves out, Girl T! [the girl turns on the boombox] Check this out! [balances on his left hand and bounces around, then stands up] Yeah! You like that?!
OC LEADER
Oooo man! [shakes his head]
OC MEMBER 1
Ohhh Lord!
[The coach spins on his back, rises to one hand, flips over, and lands doing the splits, then rises to his feet using an imaginary hook.]
OC LEADER
Oooo, he is gettin' served! [the girl shakes her head]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Randy is recovering in a room. He's got breathing tubes in his nose and his eyes are squeezed shut. His friends surround him.]
RANDY
Aw, mph! Uuuugh-ah.
SHARON
[enters with Stan] Randy? [rushes to his bedside] Randy, oh my God!
SKEETER
What happened to him, Doctor?
DR. DOCTOR
He got served. Worst I've ever seen.
JIMBO
Old fool went down to the OC to try to reason with the other team, and he got served up somethin' fierce.
CHEF
Oh Lord...
RANDY
[his voice raspy] His dancing was so fast I... couldn't do anything. His moves were... so original, so inventive. [winces] Ungh! Grrgh.
NURSE
[soothing him] Shh. Relax, Mr. Marsh. [Dr. Doctor walks off]
DR. DOCTOR
We just got the X-rays back. [walks to a backlit board and points out the injuries] He mostly got served here [a rib] and here [forearm]. But the worst serving was here in the pelvis region. The road to recovery will be a long one.
JIMBO
Boy. You must really wanna take to those Orange County kids now, huh, Stan?
SKEETER
Are you kiddin'? Stan is probably ready to pounce on them after what they did to his father! [looks over at his dad, then at the other men]
STAN
I, I don't know. He seems all right.
MR. GARRISON
I could only imagine the rage building inside you, Stan. I bet you can't wait to out-dance those OC bastards!
RANDY
Stan? Stan?
STAN
[walks to Randy's bedside] Yeah, I'm- I'm right here, Dad.
RANDY
Stan, listen to me. I don't want you feeling like you have to do that competition now to avenge me.
STAN
Okay, good.
RANDY
[emphatic] But I know I can't stop you from doing it. So all I can say is... give 'em hell, son. Give 'em hell. [passes out. The "8 Mile" theme begins to play and the camera closes in on Stan]
STAN
[thinks and then walks off miffed] God dammit!
[Loading dock at South Park Elementary, day. Stan walks over and finds the Goths there, as usual. Henrietta reads a book.]
STAN
Hey guys. Uh- You guys know how to dance, right?
MICHAEL
[with cigarette] Of course we know how to dance.
STAN
Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe?
PETE
Dance troupe? Please. [leans to one side and whips his hair back into place] We don't dance like those Britney and Justin wannabes at school. [whips his hair back into place] Goth kids dance to express pain and suffering.
MICHAEL
Yeah. [stands up] The only cool way to dance is to keep your hands at your sides and your eyes looking at the ground. Then every three seconds you take a drag from your cigarette.
[Michael leans his head to the right for two beats, leans it to the left for two beats, leans it to the right for two beats while taking a drag, leans it to the left for two beats, and repeats. The red Goth follows suit, then all four Goths dance the same way.]
STAN
Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served.
PETE
[flips his hair back] No way. Dancing is something you do alone in your room at three in the morning.
STAN
[walks up to the red Goth] Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it?
PETE
I'm not doin' it. Being in a dance group is totally conformist.
HENRIETTA
Yeah. I'm not conforming to some dance-off regulations.
FIRKLE
I'm not doin' it either. I'm the biggest nonconformist of all.
MICHAEL
I'm such a nonconformist that I'm not going to conform with the rest of you. Okay, I'll do it. [rises and walks over to Stan]
STAN
Great! [they leave together]
HENRIETTA
Whoa. I think we just got put in our place.
PETE
Yeah. We just got Goth-served.
[The neighborhood. Stan and Michael walk down the street.]
STAN
All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance.
MICHAEL
We should go to the arcade. [takes a drag from his cigarette]
STAN
The arcade?
MICHAEL
Yeah. There's this Asian kid named Yao. He's an expert at that Dance Dance Revolution game. [takes a drag from his cigarette]
[The Sinistarcade. A Dancin' Dancin' Dancin' Machine game is prominently shown, and an Asian boy dances furiously on the foot pad on the right. The arrows indicate which foot buttons the boy should be stepping on. He's hit everyone, so his score is perfect. Stan and Michael look on.]
STAN
Dude, he's incredible.
MICHAEL
He should be. He's here playing that game every single day after school. I think he's spent about six thousand dollars on it so far. [the game gets faster and faster and the kid keeps up. Eventually, the game ends, and the boy picks up his soda cup and walks away.]
STAN
[catches up to Yao at the change machine] Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe?
YAO
You mean, dancing without a machine telling you what to do?
STAN
Yeah.
YAO
That's stupid. [waves him off and walks away]
STAN
[catches up] Dude, we need you.
YAO
I can't dance without the machine.
STAN
It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us.
YAO
Okay. I'll give it a shot.
STAN
All right, that's three!
MICHAEL
Dude, we need a girl.
STAN
Huh?
MICHAEL
We can't be a dance troupe with just guys. People will think we're fags.
STAN
Oh yeah. [thinks a bit with finger to chin] Wait a minute. I know just where to go!
[Raisins. Happy Hour all day!!! Inside the little waitresses go about their work. Two of them dance, shaking their asses in rhythmic unison. Mercedes dances for a boy, who looks on in bliss.]
PORSCHE
Hi guys, welcome to Raisins. Three of you?
STAN
Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick.
MAURY
You have to buy wings if you wanna talk to the Raisins girls. [Stan look at his crew. Moments later they are seated at the bar, with Mercedes]
STAN
And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County.
MERCEDES
[twirling her hair] Wow, that sounds great. I always wanted to try my dancing somewhere else.
STAN
So you'll do it?
MERCEDES
Why not?
STAN
All right, we just need one more person!
MERCEDES
Hey, we should get that kid that was state champion in tap dancing.
STAN
What? The state tap champion is from here? Who?
MERCEDES
I think his name was... [closes her eyes] Leopold... Stotch or something?
STAN
Leopold Stotch...? Wait a minute. You mean...
[Butters' house, day. He's at the kitchen assembling a toy car.]
BUTTERS
Loo loo loo, I've got some apples. Loo loo loo, you've got some too. Loo loo loo, I've-
LINDA
[enters] Butters, you have some visitors. [Stan, Michael, Mercedes, and Yao appear]
BUTTERS
[turns around] Oh well, hi there everybody. [his mom leaves]
STAN
Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe.
BUTTERS
Wow, neat-o, a competition? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it?
STAN
It's a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago. [his smile vanishes as he begins to think back, then a small grimace appears.]
BUTTERS
...No.
STAN
But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska.
BUTTERS
No. [hops off the chair and runs away] No no no no no no, no! [runs into the living room and up the stairs] No! No no no no!
LINDA
Butters? [rises and looks up the stairs] Butters?! [Stan and the other kids enter]
STAN
We just asked him to join our dance troupe. We heard he was state tap champion.
LINDA
Oh. Oh, dear. I'm sorry kids, it's just that... Butters hasn't danced since the tragedy.
MERCEDES
A tragedy?
BUTTERS
[from his room] Waaaaah!
LINDA
I'm sorry, kids, you'll have to go.
[Outside. The kids leave Butters' house and make their way to the sidewalk.]
STAN
Dammit, where are we gonna get our fifth member?
YAO
Hey I heard about this guy in Como who has a duck that can dance.
STAN
A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talented person in South Park.
[Butters' house, Butters' bedroom closer door slides open and he looks in. On the floor, covered in cobwebs, and underneath some clothes is an orange shoe box with red lid. Butters slides the door open more and reaches in. He pulls out the box and sets it on his bed. He sits down next to it, nervously. Butters opens the box and pulls out news clippings: "Local Boy Taps His Way to the Finals" "Best in State Arrive in Lincoln" "Eight Dead as Finalist Loses Step" "Biggest Tap Tragedy since 1954". He then removes some tissue from the tap shoes, then removes a shoe. He inspects it until he sees the blood on the side of the shoe.]
BUTTERS
Aaaaah! [quickly throws the shoes and clippings away, then goes to cry into his pillow] Aaaaah!
[A ranch. Stan and his troupe arrive.]
STAN
All right, so you're sure he can dance?
RANCHER
Oh yeah. There he is. That's Jeffy.
YAO
That don't look like a dancing duck to me.
RANCHER
Well, that's 'cause it needs music. Here y-here ya go, Jeffy.
[The rancher brings out a violin and begins playing.]
RANCHER
You'll do a line and I'll do a line, honeeey.
You'll do a line and I'll do a line, babe.
[The duck rises and begins to dance.]
RANCHER
 You'll do a line and I'll do a line, we'll fight an' screw 'til the mornin' time.
Honey, babe, be mine.
You'll do a line and I'll do a line, honey-
STAN
Hey, he- Is that the only song he'll dance to?
RANCHER
No no, he'll dance to anything. See?
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, honeeey.
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, babe.
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, we'll fight an' screw all night and day.
Honey, babe, be mine.
STAN
My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe.
[Butters' house, day. Linda walks up the stairs to Butters' room and knocks on the door.]
LINDA
Butters? Butters? Come on, sweetie, it's gonna be okay. [a shot of Butters under the covers, with bug eyes] Come on, Butters. You went through a lot of therapy for this. That was almost two years ago, sweetie.
BUTTERS
Two years ago. Two years ago!
[The camera goes into Butters' eye and a memory of the finals two years prior comes up. A girl dances, finishes, and takes several curtsies.]
ANNOUNCER
That was Beverly Long from Indianapolis, folks. Let her hear it! [she waves to the audience and walks off] All right, and now, dancing to the song "I've Got Something In My Front Pocket For You," here is Colorado state champion, Leopold "Butters" Stotch! [the audience applauds. The Stotches are present and clapping with the audience. The song begins to play, Butters begins to dance]
SINGER
I've got something in my front pocket for you
Why don't you reach down in my pocket and see what it is
Then grab onto it, it's just for you
Give a little squeeze and say, "How do you do?"
There's something in my front pocket, There's something in my front pocket,
There's something in my front pocket-
[As the song reaches its climax, he dances faster and faster, until his right shoe flies off his foot.]
BUTTERS
Whoops.
[Butters' shoe strikes a floodlight in the rafters and knocks it down. The light lands on a man, instantly killing him. Blood splatters onto the surrounding audience members, who get up and scatter. The rafters begin to break apart. A pole comes down and impales a fleeing woman. Her flying blood reaches Butters. More lights fall down and a cable is torn from its anchor, leaving a hole in the wall. The cable swings down and slices a couple in two along the abdomen. The upper halves of their bodies slide off and fall to the ground.]
WOMAN
Paul. Paul!
[The woman grabs onto the stage light and is electrocuted. Another man, who was sliced in two by the cable, attempts to gather his insides back into himself. The rafters come down and kill another man, and Paul's widow finally blows up. More blood lands on Butters, and the crowd begins to panic.]
BUTTERS
Wuuuhaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah! [a man is trampled to death underfoot. Butters watches the auditorium empty out] No! Nooo! Noooooooooooooooo!
[South Park, day. Chef approaches Lamont's Dance Studio with his boombox and duffle bag.]
CHEF
All right, children, let's get to rehearsin'! [sets his stuff onto a table next to the door] We don't have much time, and you've got to become the dance group you can be. [moves further into the studio] I think we should- [stops] Whoa. [a shot of the five dancers, including Jeffy, who quacks] This... is the dance troupe?
STAN
Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer.
CHEF
Oh boy. [returns to his boombox] All right, well, why don't you show me what you got? I wanna see what you kids can do!
[Chef starts the CD player. The troupe members display their moves: Stan with the Achy Breaky Dance, Michael with the hanging head, Yao with his DDDM moves, Mercedes with her rump shaker, and Jeffy with his duck strut.]
BOOMBOX
You can't step to my roots, so don't try it.
You can’t burn with my group so don’t light it.
I'm on the East-side crew and I'm better than you.
You like to suck my balls, don't deny it.
You can't bop her like me so don't go there.
You never find a bigger bitch player nowhere.
I put my jimmy in a ho, put off soul.
I'm a good listener and that's rare.
CHEF
Oh Lord have mercy. [turns off the boombox] Children, children! No no, you've got it all wrong. Don't you see, children? You have the heart, but you don't have the soul. No no, wait. You have the soul, but you don't have the heart. [scratches his head] No no, scratch that. You have the heart and the soul, but you don't have the talent.
STAN
We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we?
YAO
What? I don't wanna get served.
MERCEDES
Yeah, you didn't tell us that we might get served.
STAN
Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like- [the others also speak, the others continue to argue, talking over one another.]
CHEF
All right, all right, quiet, children! Now, nobody's getting served if I can help it. We just gotta buckle down, dig deep, and pray that maybe the other team comes down with cancer. [Stan droops his head.]
[Butters' room. He's working on a Lego building, which might be a model of South Park. Stan enters and walks up to him. Butters glances back and then looks at his work again.]
BUTTERS
What do you want?
STAN
I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you.
BUTTERS
Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore. [leaves his chair and walks up to his Lego box] I gave that up.
STAN
Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.
BUTTERS
[rummaging for Lego blocks to take back to his desk] Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed?
STAN
Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault.
BUTTERS
Yeah well, you tell that to their families. [returns to his desk with a new batch of blocks]
STAN
Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that.
BUTTERS
[whirls around] I let those people down! Don't you get it, man?! Eight people died!
STAN
Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant.
BUTTERS
What?
STAN
And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.
BUTTERS
[cups his hear so he hears no more] Aaaah!
STAN
But that isn't the point, Butters! [Butters resumes building his tiny town] The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying "Haha! I'm better than you!" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you're an old man.
BUTTERS
Get out of my room, Stan.
STAN
[Firmly] Fine. [walks to the door and opens it] But someday you're gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it. Otherwise, you might as well move to France with all the other pussies. [leaves and closes the door. Butters, angered, tosses some blocks into his town, then wipes the town off the desk.]
[The OC Convention Center. "It's ON!!!! NOW!!!!".]
MC
Yeah, make some noise!
[The audience cheers. The OC side is shown, then the SP side. The Blacks, Jimbo, Ned, Skeeter, and Mr. Garrison are in that audience. The South Park crew is then shown with Chef]
MC
Ladies and Gentlemen,
[The Marshes are shown, Randy with his portable oxygen tank and wheelchair.]
MC
man, you are all in for a treat! Whichever crew wins tonight, you wanna remember their faces, 'cause the next time you see them... will be in Lil Kim's next video! Give it up for Lil Kim!
[A tiny Lil Kim is shown seated on a table. Her lips and breasts are waaaay too big for her infant-sized body.]
LIL KIM
[high squeaky voice] What's up, ni**as?! [waves to the audience]
MC
This is gonna be a rough battle, y'all. So let's give it up for the OC Crew! [the crew is shown, then their parents in the audience are shown] And the challengers, the South Park Diggitys!
JIMBO
Man, it is about to get crazy up in here.
MR. GARRISON
Aww, yeah.
MC
A'ight y'all. It's showtime!
ANNOUNCER
Dancers to the floor! [the OC Crew steps forth]
MERCEDES
[runs up to Stan] Stan. Stan, we have a big problem!
STAN
What?
MERCEDES
It's Jeffy. He sprained his ankle.
[Jeffy the duck has an ice pack on his ankle. The rest of the crew approaches.]
STAN
What happened??
MERCEDES
He was practicing the six-eight count and slipped on the floor.
OC MEMBER 3
Come on, fools! You dancin' or what?!
YAO
Can he move it?
[Yao touches the ice pack and Jeffy protests vociferously. Yao removes his hand.]
STAN
Aw, what do we do, Chef?!
CHEF
Rules are you have to have five dancers. We have no choice, children. We have to forfeit.
OC MEMBER 1
Looks like they ain't even gonna dance.
OC LEADER
They're too scared! Looks like they already got served!
[The doors at the back of the OCCC open up and Butters appears. Some spectators turn to see who it is but have a hard time because of the glare behind Butters. The doors close behind him and he walks down the hall toward the dance-off.]
BUTTERS
Hey! Can I still dance with you guys?
STAN
Butters! [the SP crew moves towards him]
CHEF
All right!
MC
All right come on, let's do this! DJ! Give us a hot track!
[The DJ starts up a CD. The OC Crew dances first.]
CD
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
[The OC leader comes up to Butters and serves him with a balancing act on the right hand twice and a back flip, then returns to the crew, spins on his head a few times, then ends on his side, resting his head on his right hand.]
CD
Let's see you...! Let's see you...!
Daaance, sucka!
[The music begins a brief instrumental. The Diggitys answer the serve with a sequence that has the members twirling and handing off to the next one until all point to Butters. He then steps forth tap-dancing. He dances well, but his dancing gets intense quickly.]
CD
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you dance sucka!
[Butters' intensity is so great that his left shoe flies off his foot and sails into the rafters.]
BUTTERS
Waaah! [the spectators follow the shoe's arc. The shoe hits a stage light, which comes down and kills the OC leader. The OC coach comes forward] No! Jesus, not again!
OC MEMBER 1
Aaaah!
OC MEMBER 3
Get out of here!
[The rafters come down on the rest of the crew, including the coach, killing them instantly. Butters and the spectators are mortified at these developments.]
MC
[walks up, sadly] Folks, it looks like the OC crew is dead. [excitedly] That means the winner is the South Park Diggitys!
SKEETER
Woo!
MR. GARRISON
Yeah!
JIMBO
All right!
CHEF
All right! We did it! [he and the Diggitys approach Butters]
STAN
All right Butters!
YAO
You did it!
RANDY
You did it, son! You did it!
CARTMAN
All right, Butters!
[The people who arrive to congratulate Butters: Cartman, Kenny, Kyle, Mr. Garrison, Jimbo, Liane, Tolkien, and his parents, Ned, Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, and Mayor McDaniels. Stan and Cartman hoist Butters up between them and walk toward the camera. The others follow. Butters' mouth fills the screen.]
BUTTERS
No! No! Noooooo!
End of You Got F'd in the A


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Humans from the year 3045 are traveling to South Park through a recently opened time portal and are looking for work.

script:Goobacks

[Interstate 285 looking north, twilight fading to night. There are two lanes on either side of the highway, with a grass median in between. A Snacky Cakes truck rolls by. Tumbleweeds begin to roll. A few seconds later, the highway sign begins to shake violently and then crackle with lightning. The camera pans to the right and more lightning is seen until a sphere of energy with a doorway appears. More tumbleweeds roll by.]
[A flash of light follows, and a humanoid steps forth from the sphere. He looks around and mumbles something. He walks towards the highway, looking around all the while. A car comes up quick on him and he freezes in the headlights for a while, then jumps out of the way as a Busy Beavers Moving Company truck barrels past him. A car comes up on him on the other side of the highway. He gets up quickly and steps out of the way. Traffic picks up and the humanoid dodges all the vehicles until a car almost runs him over. The car brakes and tips him over.]
[South Park, next day. The boys approach a house, which has more snow on it than usual in South Park, especially along the windows. Indeed, it looks like the town has just had a snow storm overnight. Each of the boys carries a shovel. Stan rings the bell. A woman answers.]
WOMAN
Yes?
CARTMAN
[sweetly] Hello ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars?
WOMAN
Oh well, I certainly could use some little snow-shovelers, but eight thousand dollars seems a little steep. How about ten dollars?
CARTMAN
Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!
WOMAN
How about fifteen dollars?
CARTMAN
It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work! [moments later, Stan and Kyle are clearing the driveway while Kenny clears the front lawn, moving by Cartman, who is now seated on the steps talking on a cell phone] Yeah, it's so totally awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool. [Kyle walks up to him and stops] No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak. [notices Kyle, then lowers the phone] What?
KYLE
You've been on your fucking phone since we started!
CARTMAN
Dude, I'm takin' a break.
KYLE
A break from what?! You haven't done anything!
CARTMAN
Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers.
KYLE
All you ever do is talk about your balls!
CARTMAN
It works, doesn't it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?
KYLE
If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!
CARTMAN
Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass!
[Moments later the doorbell rings again. This time the camera is in the house looking at the door from an angle. The woman approaches and opens the door. The boys are shown, with Cartman keeping his now-bloody nose from oozing any more blood.]
STAN
Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?
WOMAN
Oh goodness, what happened?
CARTMAN
Shoveling accident.
WOMAN
Oooh, no, come on inside. [leads them in and stops in the middle of the living room, in front of the TV. A newscast is on] Wait right here, I'll be right back. [walks off]
CARTMAN
You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it.
STAN
Cartman, just keep your mouth shut.
NEWS ANNOUNCER
This is breaking news. Here's Anchorman Aaron Brown. [the boys turn to watch]
AARON BROWN
[CNN anchor. An image of the humanoid is shown, with the caption "Guest from the Future" above it] Incredible, absolutely amazing news today. A man from the future has come back in time and is in a government hospital after being hit by a car.
STAN
Whoa.
AARON BROWN
Christina Naylon has more.
CHRISTINA NYLON
[soldiers patrol the area around Hangar 18] The news is incredible, Aaron. Experts and scientists have been with the man from the future for several hours now, and have been able to learn that he is from the year 3045. His condition is stable, and speculation continues as to why he has come. Has he come to deliver a cure for cancer? Or to fix something wrong with the past?
AARON BROWN
Have to interrupt you there, Christina. Apparently, Brad Morgan is inside the base with breaking news. Brad?
BRAD MORGAN
[inside the base. Scientists and soldiers mill around the alien's bed] Aaron, the scientists have been able to communicate further and have uncovered that the man from one thousand years in the future has come to our time... looking for work. Uh, he has said that the future is so overwhelmingly overpopulated that there are simply no jobs in his time, and so he built a time portal and has come back to 21st century America, uh, to find a job here.
AARON BROWN
Heheh, it's absolutely astounding. He came back here for work?
BRAD MORGAN
Huh... that's right, Aaron. Hi- his plan is to get a job here, in our time, so that he can put the money he earns into a savings account, uh, which will earn interest, and by the year 3045 be worth billions of dollars, uh which of course in the future will be worth only hundreds of dollars, but uh, enough, he says, to feed his family.
AARON BROWN
And now I understand we're going to Harrison Moore, uh, for an explanation on how the time portal works. Harrison?
HARRISON MOORE
[at the time portal. News vans, reporters and scientists, one in a space suit, gather around and marvel at the portal] Aaron, I'm standing at the time border which scientists say follow Terminator rules. That is, it's one way only and you can't go back. This is in contrast, say, to Back To The Future rules, where back and forth is possible, and of course, Timerider rules, which are just plain silly. Anyway, it appears that the man from the future is here to stay.
[Later, Stan returns home. He enters with his shovel.]
STAN
Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future!
RANDY
We know, Stanley. We've been watching.
AARON BROWN
If you're just joining us, a man from over two thousand years into the future has come through a one-way time portal looking for work. Uh, the President is expected to give an announcement at any time.
HARRISON MOORE
Breaking news here at the time portal, Aaron. It appears that another person from the future has just arrived! [the camera pans right to show a HazMat team checking the person for radiation] It looks as if the job at Wendy's did work for the original immigrant; this second arrivee claims that man's family is now much better off, and wishes the same for his family.
[Stan's house, night. Sharon puts Stan to bed and tucks him in.]
SHARON
There you go. All set, sweetie?
STAN
Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em.
SHARON
I'm sure a lot of people do, hon. It's pretty exciting, isn't it? Now, you just get some sleep. [turns off Stan's lamp] You've had a busy day. [walks off. At the door she turns and looks at him] Goodnight, sweetie.
STAN
Night, Mom. [after she leaves, he puts his arms up and behind his head and smiles] Wow, two people from the future. How cool.
[Interstate 285 looking north, twilight fading to night. The highway sign begins to shake violently and then crackle with lightning. The camera pans to the right and more lightning is seen until it reaches the portal. A flash of light follows, and an humanoid steps forth from the sphere. Another flash brings forth another humanoid. Another flash brings forth a third humanoid. Another flash brings forth his wife, another flash brings forth their daughter, and another flash brings forth their son. Another flash brings forth another humanoid. They head for the highway, which is busy now. They all make their way across, avoiding being struck as they cross the lanes.]
[South Park, day. The boys once again make their rounds as shovelers and stop at a house. Stan rings the doorbell, the door opens, and a different woman greets them.]
MRS. LANDIS
Yes?
STAN
Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today?
MRS. LANDIS
Ooh, oh dear, I'm sorry boys, but I've already hired someone else to do it.
CARTMAN
What?! Who?!
MRS. LANDIS
One of those immigrants from the future. He said he would do it for twenty-five cents.
KYLE
Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even worth it.
STAN
All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house. [the boys turn to go back to the sidewalk...]
KYLE
Dude. [the camera pulls back to show these immigrants shoveling snow off sidewalks and driveways up and down the street]
STAN
Son of a bitch!
[CNN News Brief. An image of a family from the future is shown, with the caption above reading "Time Immigrants".]
AARON BROWN
Still more immigrants from the future arrived at the time border today, some even bringing their entire families. the purplish goo that they have on their bodies when they arrive is an ectoplasmic side effect of the time-travel process. This is all giving scientists a great opportunity to learn even more about American life in the future. Chris Holt joins us now. Chris?
CHRIS HOLT
[seated to Brown's left] Yes, there are incredible things we're learning about Americans in the future, Aaron. I- it appears that in the future, Americans have evolved into a hairless uniform mix of all races. They are all one color, which is a yellowy light-brownish whitish color. Uh, it seems race is no longer an issue in the future, because all ethnicities have mixed into one. Perhaps most interesting is how this has affected their language. The people in the future speak a complete mix of English, Chinese, Turkish and, indeed, all world languages, which sounds something like this: [makes three guttural sounds] Back to you, Aaron.
AARON BROWN
Apparently the people from the future are having a pretty easy time finding work. Since they offer to work for such low wages, they're being hired all over America.
[A meeting has assembled somewhere. Two flags hang from the back of the meeting room, one of them American, the other of Colorado. Men from all walks of life argue amongst themselves.]
MAN 1
[left side, front row] This is bullcrap! I ain't standin' for this!
DARRYL WEATHERS
[at the podium] All right, folks, my name is Darryl Weathers and I'm with the Construction Workers' Union. I work with a lot of fine men who have families to feed. Now, I don't know about you all, but we worked long and hard to get our pay up to a level where we could make a decent living. And now these people from the future are showin' up and offerin' to do the same work for next to nothin'! They took our jobs! [the audience, which is unemployed, clamors in agreement]
MAN 2
[rises, wears dark blue short-sleeve shirt, black pants] We're in the moving business! Fourteen years we've been workin' our butts off! Now these future folk come in and we can't get work nowhere! They took our jobs!
MAN 3
They took your jobs! [the rest of the audience clamors]
MAN 4
Well what about us in the fast-food business?! The restaurants are firing us 'cause the future people work for a lot less! They took our jobs!
OTHER MEN
[at random times] They took your jobs!
STAN
[pipes up] It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business. We were trying to be responsible and make money, you know? But then the people came along and, and now we're out of work too! [silence] Oh, they took our jobs!
OTHER MEN
[at random times] They took yer jobs!
[Interstate 285 looking north, twilight fading to night. The highway sign is shown, but the camera pulls back to show a new CAUTION sign showing an entire family crossing. The signs begin to sway back and forth violently and crackle with lightning. The portal is shown, but now it expands so the people from the future swarm into the present en masse.]
[South Park, night. At Stan's house, Randy and Sharon are at the sofa reading. Sharon reads a book, Randy reads the paper. Stan enters from the front. Sharon spots him.]
SHARON
Stanley, it's almost eight o'clock. Where have you been?
STAN
I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' to- [an immigrant descends the stairs with a basket of dirty clothes and stops to ask Sharon something using guttural sounds]
SHARON
Oh yes, the laundry machine is down in the basement and our son is home. Could you please set the table for dinner? [the immigrant makes some guttural sounds and walks away]
STAN
[leery] Who is that?
RANDY
That's our new housekeeper, Mrs. Gruhd. She's gonna help around the house on Tuesdays and Thursdays. [aside] And she'll do it for ten cents an hour.
STAN
Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs!
SHARON
What?!
RANDY
Oh my God! [he and Sharon rise, Stan backs away a bit] Stan Marsh, how dare you use that time-bashing slur?!
SHARON
Who taught you to talk like that?!
STAN
Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away.
RANDY
They're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do.
STAN
I wanted my job!
RANDY
Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something: Those people from the future have had a hard life! Where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor! You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from! So, for us, who have everything sooo good, to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?! Next time you think about calling them goobacks, you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is!
SHARON
That's right! We're not raising our son to be an ignorant timecist.
STAN
Timecist?
SHARON
You know, a racist, but against people from the-
STAN
People from the future. Right, got it.
RANDY
All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking.
[The O'Reilly Factor.]
ANNOUNCER
And now, here is Bill O'Reilly.
BILL O'REILLY
Welcome, welcome to the No-Spin Zone, all right? And what we're talkin' about today are the immigrants from the future. All right? Now, most people are more than happy to give a helping hand to these people who obviously need it. All right? But others are starting to say that the time portal should be closed off. All right? Now, I've got two guests with me tonight who have opposing views on the matter. On my right is pissed-off, white-trash, redneck conservative.
DARRYL WEATHERS
Thanks for having me, Bill.
BILL O'REILLY
And on my left is aging, hippie, liberal douche.
DOUCHE
Hello.
BILL O'REILLY
Now, pissed-off redneck, you say we shouldn't allow anyone else through the time portal, all right?
DARRYL WEATHERS
You're goddamn right! These people from the future are takin' all the work away from us decent present-day Americans! [leans in and low and almost grunts] They took our jobs!
SKYNARD MAN
They took our jobs!
DARRYL WEATHERS
Those jobs belong to people from the present!
BILL O'REILLY
All right. What say you, aging hippie liberal douche?
DOUCHE
Heh, it's typical for conservatives rednecks like these to view the immigrants as the problem, heh, but really, the problem is America. It is our greedy multinational corporations that keep everyone else in poverty. Your ancestors came to America as immigrants. What right do you have to turn these people away?
BILL O'REILLY
All right, redneck, your rebuttal?
DARRYL WEATHERS
[says nothing, then rises, leans forward and low, and almost grunts] They took our jobs!!
SKYNARD MAN
They took our jobs!
STOUT MAN
[really slurring] Too-kourderb!!
[South Park Elementary, day. The school bell rings and the students are in their seats. So are a lot of new immigrant students.]
HERBERT GARRISON
All right, children, the school board has mandated that I must now teach class in both present-day English and Futurespeak.
KYLE
What?!
HERBERT GARRISON
So, with that in mind, let's continue our lessons on verbs. Remember that there are transitive verbs such as [writes on the board] "The boy threw the red ball," which in Futurespeak of course, is [makes a sentence of grunts and guttural sounds] Everyone say it with me? [the kids repeat the sentence, which sounds like a series of barks, coming from them. Jimmy attempts it] Aaand there are intransitive verbs, such as [writes on the board] "The 11:15 bus from Denver arrived twelve hours late." Or in Futurespeak, "Vvut."
THE KIDS
"Vvut."
KYLE
Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in our time, then they should learn our language!
CRAIG
Yeah!
STAN
That's right! [other students speak up]
AGING HIPPIE LIBERAL DOUCHE
[steps in] Hey now, these immigrants have a right to retain their culture. Who are we to say our language is best? They deserve to have an education just as much as you do.
HERBERT GARRISON
Thank you, aging, hippie, liberal douche.
AGING HIPPIE LIBERAL DOUCHE
You betcha. [steps out]
TIMMY
Timmih.
HERBERT GARRISON
Okay, now let's get back to it, kids. What kind of verb is this? [writes on the board] "The sad girl puts balls in her mouth." Or, in Futurespeak of course, "Gluch gligh balls glych gligh."
[Back at the meeting room, the unemployed men gather for another rally against the immigrants from the future.]
MAN 5
This is bullcrap!
DARRYL WEATHERS
Listen up, everybody! We've just received a reply from our congressman. [unfurls a letter] "Dear intolerant rednecks, we sympathize with you all losing your jobs. However, we feel your solution of shooting everyone who crosses the time border is inhumane."
CHET
What? That's ridiculous!
MAN 6
They can't do that!
MAN 7
That was a good idea!
DARRYL WEATHERS
So it appears the government ain't gonna help us! Which means we gotta take matters into our own hands! The only way to stop people from the future is to stop the future from happening!
MAN 8
Hey, that's right! If there is no future, then there'll be no people from the future to come back and take our jobs!
MAN 9
Take r jurbs
DARRYL WEATHERS
All right! So, any ideas how we can stop the future from happening?
CHET
How about we cause more global warming, so that in the future, the polar ice caps melt, and it ushers in a new ice age?
DARRYL WEATHERS
[pause] How the hell is global warming gonna cause an ice age?!
CHET
Well you know, the... global warming could bring on like a climate shift or somethin'?
DARRYL WEATHERS
Chet, you are a fuckin' retard, you know that?! Even if global warming were real, which all proven scientific data shows it isn't, it would take millions of years for a climate shift to happen! You think an ice age can just happen all of a sudden-like?
CHET
Well I was just tryin' to be helpful.
DARRYL WEATHERS
Well help yourself to a fuckin' science book, 'cause you're talkin' like a fuckin' retard! Now, come on people, we've got to think! Damnit, they took our jaorbs!
MANY MEN
[randomly] They took our jobs!
[South Park, day. The boys walk down the commercial district noticing immigrants from time to time. Various immigrants greet them and try to sell them fruits, but the boys walk on. A hovering futuristic car comes up next to them, sets down, and bounces the front end up and down like a lowrider. The driver then activates the hydraulics and the car begins to dance. The boys just look in wonder as the car settles down and then moves off. Its exhaust hits the boys' faces and they cough. Next, the boys head for a Wendell's Burgers restaurant. They enter and head for the counter.]
KYLE
Aw, dude.
[The boys see that the restaurant is staffed by immigrants from the future. One of them approaches to take an order.]
CASHIER
Gaur da'ka?
STAN
Can you speak in present-day English please?
CASHIER
Uh oh... Can I help... you?
STAN
Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries.
CASHIER
[looks at the boys quizzically, then shows off the chicken sandwich to his left] Chicken sandwich?
STAN
[getting annoyed] No, a double cheeseburger and fries!
CASHIER
[taps away at the machine's keyboard] A cheeg- fry?
STAN
What?!
CASHIER
A cheeg- fry?
CARTMAN
We can't understand you, asshole! [the cashier's manager comes up and talks to him for a bit. The cashier points at the boys. The manager takes over and resets the order]
MANAGER
Can I help you?
STAN
I'm trying to order a double cheeseburger!
MANAGER
[shows off the chicken sandwich to his left] Chicken sandwich?
STAN
No, not a chicken sandwich! [his parents enter the restaurant and stand in line behind him and the boys] I want a goddamn cheeseburger and some goddamn fries you fucking goobacks!
RANDY
Stan Marsh!
STAN
Aw- awwww!
[Back at the rally...]
DARRYL WEATHERS
Come on, people, think! How are we gonna stop these immigrants from takin' our jobs!
MAN 10
Hey, I got an idea. Uh maybe we should all take off all our clothes, scramble into a big pile and start gettin' gay with each other.
CHET
Did you say "get gay"?
DARRYL WEATHERS
Hey, yeah. Well that's not a bad idea!
MAN 11
What? Gettin' gay?
DARRYL WEATHERS
Think about it: These people are from the future, right? Well, if we can git everyone to turn queer, then there won't be no children to have no children, and the people from the future won't exist to take our jobs!
JIMBO KERN
I ain't turnin' queer.
DARRYL WEATHERS
You have to, Jimbo, or else it won't be able to stop them, dammit! They took 'r beeaaaugh!
MAN 2
Yeah, they took our jobs!
MAN 8
[slurring] Took our jobs!
DARRYL WEATHERS
[begins to take off his clothes till he's in briefs and boots] Let's go over to that part of town that all the future people moved into and start humpin' each other until they disappear! Come on! [comes down from the podium and makes his way to the doors. His briefs fall off, and he turns around] Come on! You want your jobs back or not?! [turns around, walks out and turns right]
[Welcome to Little Future. This part of South Park is congested and built upwards. Parts of it are rundown. The drivers there all drive hovercars. Some kids dance around on a stoop as adults walk by.]
DARRYL WEATHERS
[appears with the other rally participants, all of them naked] All right, you future bastards! Think you can take our jubs?! Well, we'll show you! Come'ere, Earl!. [the burly man wearing the Skynard hat steps forth and starts making out with Weathers] How do you like that, gooback?! [the immigrants just stare back puzzled. Weathers addresses the rest of his peers] Come on, you guys! [the other men just stare for a while, then begin to make out as well. The immigrants just look at them.] Everyone who believes in America, join in with us! We're gonna make these future bastards nonexistent!
[South Park Center for Seismic Activity. Randy arrives for work with Stan in tow.]
STAN
Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you?
RANDY
Because you're being grounded, Stanley! Now I don't wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth! [Randy opens the door and they both go inside. The office walls are now brown instead of gray. Randy closes the door and motions Stanley to a chair behind it] You just sit right there, Stanley, and you think about what you've done! [puts his coat on the coat rack and sits at his desk to begin his day]
BOSS
You'll find all the copiers and printers in the next room over and then uh-
RANDY
Hey, Mr. Nelson.
MR. NELSON
Oh... R- Randy... Uh, I'm surprised to see you here.
RANDY
Why? This is my office.
MR. NELSON
Ooohh boy, didn't you get my phone message? Ooh, this is awkward. Well, the thing is, Randy, you've been- replaced.
RANDY
What?
MR. NELSON
Well we found an immigrant from the future who knows geology and he offered to work for next to nothing. Uh, this is Mr. Glughgogawk.
MR. GLUGHGOGAWK
Gheglo.
RANDY
You can't be serious.
MR. NELSON
I'm... sorry, Randy. It's just, with all the budget cuts and all, we'll give you some time to clean out your desk. Follow me, Mr. Glughgogawk. I'll show you to the copy room. [walks away with the immigrant. Randy is left alone to contemplate his next move]
RANDY
Oh my God. They took my jarb!!
STAN
They took yer jarb!!
[CNN Breaking News.]
ANNOUNCER
This is CNN.
AARON BROWN
Breaking news at the time border. We go now live to Harrison Moore.
HARRISON MOORE
Aaron, I'm standing at the time border where some kind of mass protest has broken out. [more immigrants enter through the portal] Hundreds of men who have lost their jobs to time immigrants are here having sex with one another. [a shot of all the men in a big pile, in all sorts of positions, as news crews film them] These men have apparently sucked and screwed their way across the state and are now here at the time border trying to get national attention. These unemployed men have been having sex for several days. Joining me is their spokesperson, Randy Marsh. [Randy steps into view, patting his moustache down] Mr. Marsh, what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
RANDY
We're doing the only thing we can do. If our government is just gonna let anybody into our time who wants to come, then we have to take matters into our own hands. [another camera view shows Stan next to his father. Stan tries to block out this interview with eyes shut tight and his fingers on his nose] We're trying to turn everyone gay so that there are no future humans! Present-day America Number One!
DARRYL WEATHERS
Yeah America! [A close-up of the mass of men fornicating with each other]
MAN 8
Take our jobs!
HARRISON MOORE
Do you really think you can get enough people to turn gay to destroy the future of humanity?
RANDY
All we can do is try, Harrison.
AGING HIPPIE LIBERAL DOUCHE
[walks into the picture] Trying to stop immigration is intolerant and ignorant. Those immigrants have a right to pursue happiness.
HARRISON MOORE
[lowers the mic to Stan] Young man, what do you think about all this?
STAN
I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us. [loosens up and opens his eyes] They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better. [the mound of men stops copulating]
MAN 9
[at the top of the mound] Huh?
STAN
I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work.
MAN 11
[inside the mound] Hey. He's right. If we build for a better future, the immigrants will stay there.
MAN 12
Yeah. We've got to start working towards a brighter tomorrow.
RANDY
Well what are we waiting for?
[Montage of green living. First scene is a group of men planting trees. Next scene is a group of people at a recycling center watching Mr. Garrison toss in his bag of spent aluminum cans. Mr. Slave then tosses in his load.]
[Next scene has the boys, Randy, and Weathers bringing food to African tribesmen. Next scene has the boys helping Randy and Weathers paint a wooden fence white. Next scene is a newly-minted wind farm in South Park made by the townspeople.]
[Stan and Shelly look at each other, smiling. Next scene has Weathers plugging his electric car into an outlet next to the garage door as others watch. Next scene has Stan bringing a gift to the towm bum. A bunch of adults follow him proudly. Next scene has some of the kids and many of the adults swaying gently to some music.]
SINGER
We've got to work for a better future, we've got to join hands for tomorrow.
Take the first step and you will see the future begins with you and me.
We can start to make a difference if we want it for our children
Recycle that can and plant that tree, 'cause the future begins with you and me.
CARTMAN
Look, it's working! [one by one, the immigrants vanish from view]
SINGER
The future begins with you and me.
DARRYL WEATHERS
The immigrants are fadin' away!
STAN
We're doing it!
[Next scene shows the townsfolk cleaning up a meadow. Next scene has the Marshes watching Weathers and an assistant install solar panels on the Marshes' roof. Last scene has the townsfolk tilling ground at a farm.]
SINGER
We've got to work for a better future, we've got to join hands for tomorrow.
Take the first step and you will see the future-
STAN
Dude, wait, wait, ho- hold on. Wait a second. [drops his shovel] This is gay.
KYLE
[drops his shovel] This is really gay.
CARTMAN
Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other.
STAN
Okay, sorry, my bad, everyone back in the pile. [everyone races back to the pile. The men take off their clothes]
DARRYL WEATHERS
Back in the pile everyone!
RANDY
We're going back to the pile.
MAN 13
Jump in!
MAN 14
Come on, everybody!
MAN 15
Never mind, we're going back to the pile!
MAN 16
Took yer jurb!
End of Goobacks


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The children of South Park are attracted to "Mr. Jefferson" the new neighbor in town, and Cartman goes out of his way to get "Mr. Jefferson" to love him best.

script:The Jeffersons

[The neighborhood. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny ride down the street on their big wheels.]
STAN
[stops and looks at a house] Hey, check it out, dude. Somebody bought the Donovan's old house. [the other boys stop and look.]
KYLE
Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago.
CARTMAN
I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs. [a door is heard opening]
KYLE
[points] Hey Look!
[A young kid wearing an ornate face mask is seen peeking out the front door.]
BLANKET
Hello!
[The boys get off their bikes and approach the kid.]
KYLE
Hey. Do you live here?
BLANKET
Yeah, I just moved here with my dad. Are you gonna be my new friends?
CARTMAN
No.
BLANKET
I really like your town. My dad wanted to move somewhere to get away from it all. He said he wanted peace and quiet, and to live with a bunch of hicks who don't know anything.
[Stan and Kyle look at each other a bit puzzled.]
STAN
What's that you're wearing?
BLANKET
It's my mask. My daddy says it's best for me to hide my face. My name's Blanket.
CARTMAN
Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now.
[The boys turn back to get back on to their bikes.]
BLANKET
Wait! Don't you guys wanna come inside and play?
CARTMAN
Huh? Look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels. [they turn away.]
BLANKET
We have arcade games inside.
[Kyle and Cartman whip around. Moments later, the boys are in the house.']
[The Jeffersons' house inside.]
BLANKET
Dad?
STAN
Whoa. Dude, no way!
CARTMAN
Oh my God, this is awesome! [runs up to a claw machine]
STAN
Dude, are these all your toys?
BLANKET
No, this is all my dad's stuff. He loves toys and video games.
KYLE
Dude, he just be loaded! What does he do?
BLANKET
He's retired now.
CARTMAN
[guiding the machine's arm to grab a plush toy] Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest guy in the world!
BLANKET
Come on, my dad's probably out in the backyard. [guides the other three boys out]
[The backyard. The sliding door opens up to a small park, a Neverland, with a giraffe, small Ferris wheel, small carousel, and other things. The boys step through the doorway.]
CARTMAN
Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!
BLANKET
Dad? You out here?
MICHAEL
Here I am, Blanket!
[Blanket's dad, a spitting image of Michael Jackson, rides into view on a small train and waves. Every few seconds his moustache falls off and he has to put it back in place. He hops off the train and dances around]
MICHAEL
Heeee!
[He twirls, does a pelvic thrust while daintily touching his crotch.]
MICHAEL
Jeh chabee durtah!
[He pulls up his pant legs a bit, kicks his right leg up, then whips his right arm out to full length. His moustache falls off and he resets it, then runs up to Blanket and picks him up]
MICHAEL
Blanket! Oh my beautiful Blanket!
KYLE
[softly] What's wrong with his face?
STAN
[softly] Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something.
BLANKET
Guys, this is my dad. Michael Ja-
MICHAEL
Jefferson! Michael ...Jefferson, yeh. Hey, you wanna play with me?
[He runs into the yard.]
MICHAEL
Come on, let's climb the tree! [turns to a tree and scales it] Come on, climb the tree, climb the tree!
[Michael motions for the boys to join him. They oblige and join him up there.]
MICHAEL
Have you been up my... Wishing Tree? Tuh!
It's where I come to think and dream.
And now I'd like to show you my... Wishing Tree.
Jam on!
Where we can laugh and giggle and scream.
Hee hee!
Imagination is the key.
KYLE
Mr. Jefferson, your son can't get up.
MICHAEL
Won't you imagine along with me?
KYLE
Mr. Jefferson?
[On the ground, Blanket can't even reach the bottom rung of the ladder.]
MICHAEL
We can be spacemen,
or pirates on the sea
Chuckajamonah!
Yes we can do everything,
and I mean, everything!
Chuckajamonah!
Up in my Wishing Tree!
Hee hee! Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!
[Stark's Pond, day. A group of kids skate around lazily on its frozen surface. Stan and friends race over a rise towards the lake.]
STAN
Hey, you guys! You guys! [the kids gather around] You gotta come with us over to the Jeffersons!
RED
The Jeffersons?
CARTMAN
[breathless] They're a new family that just moved to South Park! We met this kid named Blanket and he has the coolest dad in the world! [his chest heaves noticeably]
KYLE
Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house.
CARTMAN
They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train.
CRAIG
[in a monotone voice] No way.
CARTMAN
Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come!
CRAIG
[not wanting to be left out] I believe in Mr. Jefferson!
[The Jefferson house, arcade room. As the kids enjoy the toys and games found there, Jefferson swings above them on a spacious swing with Bebe on his lap.]
MICHAEL
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, look at us on the swing! We're swinging!
BLANKET
Who wants the first cotton candy?
[The kids around him begin to clamor for it.]
KIDS
Memememememememememe
[Blanket hands the first cotton-candy to Kyle.]
MICHAEL
Mememe! I'm first! I'm first!
[Blanket steps away a bit astonished, but soon all the kids have cotton candy.]
MICHAEL
Oooo, let's go ride the choo-choo train!
CARTMAN
Choo-choo train! Yay!
[The kids begin to move towards the back yard. Blanket is left on the floor trying to stand and catch up to them.]
[The Jefferson back yard. The kids follow Jefferson to the train.]
MICHAEL
Let's ride the train! The train!
[The kids climb on and the train begins to roll.]
MICHAEL
Would you like to ride the train with me,
and start a magical journey?
CARTMAN
Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.
MICHAEL
Cartman, you have a beautiful voice.
CARTMAN
Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you.
MICHAEL
Let's ride and ride on the train together
CARTMAN
...Train together
MICHAEL
On a journey through both of our minds.
CARTMAN
I've got time. Do youuu??
[Back near the sliding door, Stan, Kyle and Kenny look on. Blanket stands next to them and Kyle notices Blanket's left leg.]
KYLE
Dude, what happened to your knee?
BLANKET
[his skinned knee is shown] I fell down.
KYLE
[calls out] Mr. Jefferson!
MICHAEL
[back on the train] Choo-choo train, it's all fun and games.
CARTMAN
Choo-choo train.
KYLE
Mr- ! Goddammit. Here, come on. We need to clean that up. [takes Blanket inside]
[The bathroom. Kyle sits Blanket on the toilet and dresses the wound.]
KYLE
Alright, this is gonna sting for a second.
[Kyle dabs some alcohol onto a towel and presses the towel onto Blanket's knee, wiping off some dirt, then dabs some more alcohol onto the towel.]
BLANKET
Ow!
KYLE
I know, I know. Be cool.
BLANKET
Thank you. That already feels better.
[Kyle wipes Blanket's knee some more, then dabs some more alcohol onto the towel.]
KYLE
So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters?
BLANKET
I have a half-brother and a half-sister. But they live with their mom now.
[Kyle wipes Blanket's knee some more, then dabs some more alcohol onto the towel.]
KYLE
And where is your mom?
BLANKET
I don't have a mom.
KYLE
You must have a mom.
[Kyle wipes Blanket's knee some more, then dabs some more alcohol onto the towel.]
KYLE
You mean she doesn't live here, or she's dead, or what?
BLANKET
No. I was made in a laboratory.
KYLE
What?
BLANKET
My daddy wanted to have a baby, so he put me in a test tube. Then, they put me in a woman's tummy, and, when I was born, Daddy took me home.
KYLE
So you never met your mom?
BLANKET
No... But I used to have a lot of bodyguards and nannies, if that counts.
KYLE
Yeah. Yeah, that counts.
[The neighborhood, some time later. The boys are walking home. Kyle seems concerned.]
CARTMAN
Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!
KYLE
You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid.
CARTMAN
You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want!
KYLE
Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one.
CARTMAN
Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it! [faces Kyle down] Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time, and if you miss this up, so help me god, I will rip your balls off with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you! [turns and walks away angrily]
[Stan's house, afternoon. Stan enters the kitchen through the back door. Randy is at the breakfast nook reading a paper, Sharon puts a coffee pot onto the counter.]
RANDY
Well, there he is. Where have you been all afternoon.
STAN
I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons.
SHARON
Oh, are they nice people?
STAN
Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.
SHARON
Well, we're supposed to have the Broflovskis and the Stotches over for dinner tonight. Maybe I'll invite Mr. Jefferson too.
[Stan's house, evening. The Marshes and their guests are seated at table for dinner. On the left are seated Sheila, Stephen, and Linda. On the right are seated Gerald, Mr. Jefferson, Sharon, and Randy is at the head of the table.]
GERALD
So, Mr. Jefferson, did I hear you say you moved here from Kentucky?
MICHAEL
Kentucky, yeah.
RANDY
I heard people saying you all were from Illinois.
MICHAEL
No, the- they're ignorant. That's ignorant.
STEPHEN
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Jefferson?
MICHAEL
Oh I'm retired now, but, I was in... pharmaceuticals.
SHEILA
Well our boys have really taken a liking to you. You seem to really have a way with them.
MICHAEL
I just id- identify so much with children. Their innocence, their beauty. I think that God is in the face of every child.
RANDY
....Yeeeah.
SHARON
...They are fun. [glances back, away from the table] Boys, you okay out there?
[The living room. Stan, Kyle, and Blanket are seated on the sofa, eating.]
STAN
Fine, Mom.
BLANKET
Wow, these are great. What are they called again?
KYLE
They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?
BLANKET
Nah, I'm not supposed to. Dad says I have to keep my face hidden.
[The doorbell rings. Stan goes to answer the front door and sees Cartman.]
CARTMAN
What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!
STAN
No, my parents are.
CARTMAN
You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away!
STAN
What?
CARTMAN
He is my friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were, [Stan steps back...] and I-
[He closes the door. Stan walks away and Cartman looks through a window.]
CARTMAN
Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!
[The dining table.]
GERALD
Hey, you know Kobe Bryant was up in Eagle today.
RANDY
Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson? Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent?
MICHAEL
[taken aback] D'huh?
STEPHEN
I think he's definitely going to jail. I just love seeing smug celebrities get their comeuppance.
MICHAEL
I think it's wrong what the police do to wealthy black men.
GERALD
Oh come on, Mr. Jefferson, you're not one of those who think that the police go around framing rich black people just because they're jealous?
MICHAEL
Yeah! Because their hearts are full of greed and they have... doo-doo in their souls.
[Park County Police Station. Inside Harris waits for a fax to finish printing. As another officer walks by with a cup of coffee, he takes a sheet from the machine.]
HARRIS
Hey Sergeant, take a look at this.
YATES
[disregards the sheet] Whatcha got?
HARRIS
Looks like a new family has just moved into South Park. One Mr. Jefferson, age 50, bought a house there and paid cash. He seems to have a lot of money.
YATES
So, what's the problem?
HARRIS
Take a look. Says here... [the sergeant takes the sheet and reviews it] He's black.
YATES
By God, so he is. Black and rich. Time to take this Mr. Jefferson down, just like we did Kobe.
[He hands the sheet and the cup of coffee to the officer and address the department.]
YATES
Let's go people!
[Yates turns, takes his coat from the coat rack and puts it on]
YATES
We've got another rich black guy. I want him humiliated and dragged through the dirt, and I want it done by the books!
[Stan's house, night. Stan is asleep in his room when someone pounds at his window. Stan wakes up, then goes to the window.]
STAN
[looks out] Kyle?
[Stan opens the window. Michael, dressed as Peter Pan, crawls up and in.]
MICHAEL
Hey, Stan, whatcha doin'? [dances a little]
STAN
Mr. Jefferson Awww! [hops off the bed] It's 1:30 in the morning!
MICHAEL
Look at me, I'm Peter Pan.
[Michael draws his small sword and swings it. His mustache falls off.]
MICHAEL
T-shamon!
I'm a little boy forever.
[Michale raises himself up on his tippy-toes.]
MICHAEL
Hey!
STAN
Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!
CARTMAN
Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend!
STAN
He just showed up here.
CARTMAN
Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we were best friends. [a knock is heard at Stan's door]
STAN
Jesus Christ!
[Stan goes to the door and finds Kyle and Blanket in the hallway.]
KYLE
Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard.
BLANKET
[wearing his veil] Hi, Stan.
KYLE
He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home.
STAN
I know. He's here.
KYLE
What?!
MICHAEL
Oh Kyle, Blanket, yay, it's a slumber party!
STAN
No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home.
MICHAEL
We can't go home. There's a ghost in our house. Me and Blanket are scared.
BLANKET
Dad says it wants to eat us.
MICHAEL
Please don't make us go back home. Please! We're scared, we're scared!
BLANKET
We're scared!
MR. JEFFERSON
Hee hee!
STAN
Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now!
KYLE
Come on, Blanket.
[Kyle takes Blanket to bed. Stan follows them and all three slide into place.]
MICHAEL
Now let's all sleep and dream
Heehee!
of fun and adventurous things
shamonah!
It's time for us all to say goodnight
CARTMAN
Deeper.
[Cartman turns to Mr. Jefferson and hugs him. Stan rolls his eyes and looks at Cartman again, then closes his eyes and begins to dream...]
CARTMAN
Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome.
MICHAEL
I think you're awesome too, Cartman.
[They get closer and closer to each other.]
CARTMAN
Yeah?
MICHAEL
Yeah.
CARTMAN
Yeah?
MICHAEL
Yeah.
CARTMAN
Yeah?
[They're about to kiss, and Stan wakes up startled.]
STAN
Ahaa!
[Stan looks over to his right and sees them both asleep.]
MICHAEL
[wakes up] What's the matter, Stan? Did you have a bad dream?
STAN
Yeah. A really bad dream.
[Stan shuts his eyes and sinks down into his bed.]
STAN
Oh Jesus!
[The Jefferson house. An unmarked police car, blue in color, waits across the street. Harris sips on a soda.]
YATES
[using his walkie-talkie] Murphy, you inside?
MURPHY
[walking through the arcade room] We're inside, sir. Harris was right. This guy looks like he has more money than all of us put together. Black sonofabitch!
[He whips out a package of something white.]
MURPHY
I'm planting the cocaine now.
[He sets it under the toy machine Cartman was using earlier.]
YATES
Johnson, what about you?
JOHNSON
[in a closet] Placing the blood spatter now, sir. [right on a pair of Jefferson's shoes]
YATES
Frakes?
FRAKES
Placing pubic hair from the raped girl now, sir.
YATES
All right, when this Jefferson guy shows up, arrest him fast and try not to beat him. There could be neighbors with video cameras. [sighs] Why do we do it, Harris?
HARRIS
Sir?
YATES
Why is it that us policemen around the country have such a passion for framing wealthy African-Americans with crimes they didn't commit?
HARRIS
Oh, why? I guess I never thought about why, sir. We just do it.
YATES
Twenty-five years I've been on the force. I've seen every kind of sick, depraved act known to humanity and still, when I see a black man walk by who has more money than me, I... want to vomit my gizzards right in the gutter. But why? Maybe there is no reason. Maybe there's just a big blue ball out there that's mostly covered with water and we're just goin' along for the ride.
[Stan's house, morning. Someone knocks on Stan's door.]
RANDY
Stan, time to get up for school. [opens the door and looks in] Stan? What the-? [sees the five people in bed] Mr. Jefferson?!
MICHAEL
[sits up quickly] Oh oh, we were just having a slumber party.
[The boys sit up and look at Randy.]
RANDY
Mr. Jefferson, this is highly inappropriate!
MICHAEL
Inappropriate? No, you're being ignorant. They're my friends. You see, I- I didn't have a childhood, so I'm really just a child myself.
[He takes out some bills from a back pocket and approaches Randy and Sharon]
MICHAEL
Here, everything's okay. I want you each to have a hundred dollars. [gives each of them 100 dollar bills]
RANDY
Wow, I'm gonna go buy that new sport coat I've been wanting. [leaves, and Sharon watches him go]
MICHAEL
Come on, Blanket. We have to go home and feed the animals. Bye, friends. [quickly leaves with Blanket in tow]
SHARON
Boys, I do not want you going over to Mr. Jefferson's anymore. Do you understand?
STAN
You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak!
CARTMAN
Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls! [Stan, Kyle, and Sharon are shocked]
[The stakeout at Jefferson house, day. The two officers are snoring, but Yates is roused by the sound of a voice.]
MICHAEL
Come on, Blanket!
YATES
Hey Har- Har- Harris! Harris!
HARRIS
[walks] Wha- wha- what?
YATES
It's Jefferson! He's back! [gets on his communicator] All right, people. Let's give Blacky a nice welcome home.
[He and Harris whip out firearms and aim. Mr. Jefferson opens the front door and goes back to the front lawn to retrieve his wooden sword.]
YATES
Whoa, wait a minute! [withdraws his gun] That guy isn't black!
[Blanket heads down the steps, and Mr. Jefferson takes him inside.]
YATES
Holy God, his son isn't black either! Oh Jesus! [gets on his communicator] This is Yates! Stand down! I repeat, stand down! Suspect is not black!
[Yates scolds Harris.]
YATES
You son of a bitch, you told my this guy was African-American!
HARRIS
It says right here on the final sheet he is!
YATES
[shoves Harris's face against the windshield] Does that look like a black guy to you?!
HARRIS
It said on the final sheet!
YATES
[throws a fit] Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! We could have made an innocent man go to jail who wasn't black! Oh!
[He grabs his own neck, then quickly opens his door and vomits onto the street.]
YATES
Wuuugh! Wuugh! Ohaugh. Ugh.
[Yates wipes his lips clean with the back of his hand and now looks exhausted.]
YATES
Jesus, Harris. What are we becoming? We're supposed to... protect the people. Where have we lost our way?
HARRIS
Sir, it's possible that he is black, even though he doesn't look it.
YATES
[whips around and says menacingly] To hell with you! I'm never gonna frame an innocent man again! Unless I know he's black for sure!
[Inside the house, Mr. Jefferson closes all the windows and curtains.]
MICHAEL
All the adults are trying to get us. Get up to your room, Blanket, and put your mask on! We can't go outside anymore!
[Moments later, Blanket is in his room looking outside. Across the street, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny walk by. Kyle looks up and notices Blanket looking bored..]
KYLE
[stops] That poor kid.
STAN
Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there.
[Kyle crosses the street anyway and Kenny shrugs. Stan and Kenny follow/]
BLANKET
[opens his windows as they approach] Hi guys!
KYLE
Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?
BLANKET
Really? You mean it?
MICHAEL
[interrupts, clapping] Oh yay, my friends are here! Come inside and play, guys!
STAN
Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us.
MICHAEL
Chop wood? No, that's ignorant. That's poopie work. Blanket and me wanna play!
STAN
Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood.
MICHAEL
Blanket likes to play, don't you Blanket? [picks him up and moves him around through the open window] Wee, look! He can fly!
KYLE
[the boys fear for Blanket's life] Jesus Christ, dude!
BLANKET
Aaaaaah! [Mr. Jefferson dangles him around by his left foot]
STAN
Stop, you fucking lunatic! [Mr. Jefferson's moustache falls off and down to the ground, he pulls Blanket back inside and closes the window]
KYLE
Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him!
[Blanket's room. He's crying on a giant plush teddy bear. Mr. Jefferson tries to soothe him.]
MICHAEL
No, Blanket, shhhh. Stop crying. It's okay, Blanket. Here, look.
[Michael spins around and does a pelvic thrust.]
MICHAEL
Jeekabee durtah! [a kick and outstretched arm] Ow!
[Blanket returns to crying into his teddy bear, Mr. Jefferson goes to soothe him again.]
MICHAEL
There, Blanket, shhhh. [tries to distract Blanket] Hey, hey look, hey look.
[Michael touches Blanket's nose and has his thumb pop out between index and middle finger.]
MICHAEL
I got your nose. [does it again.] Look! Lookit, I got your nose. I got your nose, Blanket. See?
[Does it again, and Blanket is quiet. He then smiles and grabs at his father's nose, giggling... and finds it in his hand.]
BLANKET
Aaaaaaaah! [throws it away and runs out of his bedroom]
MICHAEL
No, Blanket, stop!
[picks up his nose, puts it back in place, and pursues Blanket.]
MICHAEL
It's ignorant. You're being ignorant!
[Yates' house, later. He enters. A woman appears moments later.]
MAGGIE
Harrison, why haven't you called? You know how I worry.
YATES
I'm givin' up, Maggie. I'm quitting the force.
[Yatesremoves his jacket, and places it on a coat rack, then walks to a desk.]
MAGGIE
Quitting the force? You?
YATES
None of it makes sense anymore. [sits down and unloads his frustrations] I don't even know if what we're doing is right. The last thirteen hours we've been working on a case, trying to get a real scumbag off the streets. And when he walked up to the door, I could have sworn he was white. Maybe I can't tell the difference anymore. Maybe it doesn't matter. Because it seems like every time we frame a rich black guy, he's back out on the streets in no time. It's just like OJ. Do you know how hard those cops worked to frame him? The tireless hours they put in?! And then he just gets off because somebody messed up and said the N word out loud too many times. I guess I'm just tired. I'm just damn tired.
MAGGIE
[approaches and consoles him] Not another word of that kind of talk, Harrison Yates. [he looks up at her] Believe me I would love nothin' more than to have you quit the force and no longer have to worry about whether or not you're comin' home. But I know you. Framin' rich black men for crimes they didn't commit is in your blood. Wiping that rich, smug smile off their faces is the only thing that puts a smile on yours. You're a good cop, Harrison Yates. You don't have to question that. Because I'm here to tell you. [she caresses him, he kisses her hand]
YATES
And you're a good wife, Maggie. You know me better than I know myself. [abruptly rises and goes to the coat rack]
MAGGIE
Where're you goin'?
YATES
Think I've got a little more work to do. [puts on his coat and heads outside]
[The Jefferson house, night. Cartman walks up to the door and knocks.]
CARTMAN
Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?
[Mr. Jefferson room. He's on the phone with someone.]
MICHAEL
No, Dr. Nelson, I'm telling you, you have to fly out here right now! My nose came off again!
[Michael tosses his nose away, puts more lipstick on his lips.]
MICHAEL
I know you live in California; I'll pay for your plane ticket!
[Michael pulls at his hair, and some of it comes off.]
MICHAEL
But I'm falling apart! I need some more of that cream and the injections! I have to look young again!
[Michael picks up a stylus and pokes his lips, which pop and let fly some collagen. The skin on his lower jaw drops down and reveals some teeth.]
MICHAEL
Oh, I'm melting!
[The Jefferson house, outside. A ladder is propped up against the side of the house. Kyle, Stan, and another boy approach. The boy wears the same mask Blanket usually does.]
KYLE
All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude.
KENNY
Yeah, sure, whatever.
STAN
You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.
KENNY
Aren't I too big to be Blanket?
KYLE
[seething as he climbs the ladder] I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice. Come on! [Stan and Kenny follow]
[Blanket's bedroom. Blanket silently cries and the door creaks open.]
STAN
Blanket, you in here?
BLANKET
[excited] Hi guys!
[Stan, Kyle, and Kenny spread out and hop onto Blanket's bed.]
KYLE
Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay? [Kenny looks around]
BLANKET
You are? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
[Kyle whisks Blanket away, Stan motions Kenny into place.]
STAN
All right dude, get in his bed.
KENNY
[gets under the covers] All right, but you guys owe me for this.
STAN
Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something. [hops off and leaves]
[Santa Barbara Police Department, Snetzl's desk. His phone rings and he picks it up.]
SNETZL
Santa Barbara Police Department, this is Snetzl.
[Park County Police Department, Yates' desk.]
YATES
Hello, this is Sergeant Yates over at the Park County Police Department in Colorado.
SNETZL
Yes, sergeant. What can I do for you?
YATES
Well, we've been trying to frame this guy who just moved into our town, and the fil-o-fax says he moved from your area. One Martin Jefferson?
SNETZL
Hm. No, we never had any rich African-Americans named Jefferson here. If we had, we would have framed him ourselves.
YATES
Well, he doesn't really look that black.
SNETZL
Yeah, I don't, uh... Hold on a second. There was one we framed a couple of times, but the black bastard was so rich he made bail and disappeared before the trial.
YATES
You say he disappeared? What did you frame him for?
SNETZL
We, uhhh, found some kids that had stayed over at his place, and we asked them to lie and make up some false molestation charges.
YATES
Molestation, nice.
SNETZL
Yeah, it was a lot of work. Took years, but we were finally able to arrest him. Then we planted some evidence, took embarrassing photos of his penis, and threw him in a dirty prison cell with feces on the walls. You should have seen him squirm!
YATES
That's damn fine police work, sergeant. Damn fine.
SNETZL
Heh, yeah, but the point is this guy didn't really look black either. We had to sneak in while he was asleep and get a DNA sample to be sure.
YATES
[rises from his chair. Other officers draw near] Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! It must be the same guy!
[The Jefferson house. Cartman knocks on the front door again.]
CARTMAN
Mr. Jefferson, hello?!
[The bathroom. Stan, Kyle, and Blanket prepare a carry-on bag.]
KYLE
Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us.
[They turn towards the window next to the tub and head to it. Michael appears behind them.]
MICHAEL
What are you doing with my Blanket?
[The boys freeze. Kyle turns around and sees a disjointed, disheveled Jefferson in a Thriller outfit. The camera does a vertigo effect. Michael walks up to the boys.]
MICHAEL
Come on, Blanket, play with me. Jeechabee durtah! Hee! [an outstretched arm]
STAN, KYLE, BLANKET
Haaaaa!
STAN
Go, go, ruuun! [the boys run out of the bathroom]
MR. JEFFERSON
[whispers as he walks] Sutah!
[The Hallway. The boys run towards the stairs.]
STAN, KYLE, BLANKET
Haaaaa!
MICHAEL
[rounds a corner onto the hallway] Wuchatennah! Jamonah! Heehee!
STAN
[The boys enter Blanket's room] Oh Jesus!
KENNY
What the hell is going on, you guys?
MICHAEL
[enters and heads for Blanket's bed] My Blanket! Let's play, Blanket! [pulls Kenny out of the bed]
KENNY
Nonono wait, I'm not Blanket!
MICHAEL
[tossing Kenny up into the air] Wee, he can fly! He can fly!
KENNY
Aaaah! Aaaah, stop! A-
[Kenny's head goes through the ceiling and blood runs down his body. It begins to drip from his feet.]
STAN
Oh my God, he killed Kenny!
KYLE
You bastard!
[Michael turns around and sees the boys.]
MICHAEL
Blanket? Blanket! Come play! [slowly approaches the boys]
BLANKET
Nooo! [Stan turns to leave]
KYLE
[grabs Blanket's hand and leaves as well] Come on!
[The Jefferson house, front lawn. Kyle opens the front door and the boys exit.]
STAN
Run, Blanket, Run!
BLANKET
[stumbles] Ah!
MICHAEL
[exits] Dainduh! Dainduh Dainduh!
KYLE
[Kyle and Stan help Blanket up] Hang on, Blanket!
[The three run off and a floodlight turns on, blinding Michael.]
MR. JEFFERSON
[shielding his eyes] Dugh! Heehee! Ja-!
YATES
[through his bullhorn] Freeze, Jefferson! The gig is up! You are wanted for child mo-les-tation!
CARTMAN
[hops to Mr. Jefferson's defense, standing in front of him] No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson! [a crowd, including the boys' parents, gathers] All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery!
MICHAEL
It's ignorant.
[His lower jaw literally drops to the ground. He bends down, picks it up, and pops it back in place.]
CARTMAN
Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child?
KYLE
[returns with Blanket] All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit! Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!
MICHAEL
[closeup for a few seconds] You're right. I've been so obsessed with my childhood that I've forgotten about his. I thought having lots of rides and toys was enough, but... Blanket doesn't need a playmate. He needs a father, and a normal life. Chickuckoo gainuh. [genuflects behind Blanket] Blanket, I wanna give away all my money. I- I wanna get a normal job and... take a shot at raising you in a normal setting.
[Blanket removes the ornate mask, and Blanket blinks while shielding his eyes. Blanket moves over to his friends.]
BLANKET
Look everybody! I'm a normal little boy.
YATES
[approaches with Harris] Well, if you're gonna give away all your money, then, I guess we can drop all those charges. No point in putting another poor black man in jail.
KYLE
All right! Things just might work out!
MICHAEL
Things can always work out, as long as we know we have the power to change.
[Music begins to play as the neighbors and officers gather around him.]
MICHAEL
We all have the power to change if we search inside our hearts
And we start to heal the wounds of all our yesterdays
And you know it might be hard, but all you've got to do is start,
And you can change all of your evil molesting ways.
Jejabee durtah! Hee-hee! OOOOH! Jejabee durtah! Hee-hee! Jamonah! butcha-tamonah! Chich-cha!
End of The Jeffersons

synopsis:A PET protest against the use of a cow as South Park Elementary's mascot forces the student body to choose a new one.

script:Douche and Turd

[South Park Elementary, the school gym. Six cheerleaders, all fourth-graders, lead a Pep Rally '04.]
CHEERLEADERS
We are South Park, Green and White. Let's go, Cows! Fight, fight, fight! Nobody can beat a Cow! Let's gooo, South Park![in the audience, Cartman yawns.]
RED
Hey, South Park! Do you have school spirit?
STUDENTS
[all grades] Moooooooo!
BEBE
I think us Cows have the best school spirit. Huh, Mandy?
MANDY
[new fourth grader, with braces that makes her speak with a lisp] Yeah, and South Park is really gonna stick it to Littleton next week!
BEBE
Let's bring out our mascot and get this pep rally going! [an adult in a cow suit comes out, waves to the kids, then begins to dance.]
BUTTERS
It's Mooey! Mooey, wave to me! Wave to me, Mooey!
CARTMAN
Butters, shut the hell up! [As Mooey dances, PETA bursts in through the double doors and rushes towards the cheerleaders. They apprehend Mooey and begin beating him up, then pulling his head off]
BLONDE PETA WOMAN
[through her megaphone] We are People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals! We protest your insensitive use of cows as your school mascot!
HERBERT GARRISON
Oh, Jesus, not PETA again.
DREADLOCKED PETA MAN
[approaches Bebe] Cows are maimed and slaughtered and used as a commodity! [throws a bucket of real blood on Bebe. Other PETA members go after the rest of the cheerleaders]
BLONDE PETA WOMAN
[showing old slaughterhouse scenes on how to prepare beef] This is the fate of the cow! This is your insensitivity!
STUDENTS
Ewww! [a kindergartner begins to cry]
GAS MASK PETA MEMBER
The cow is a slave! The cow is a commodity! To be thrown away by a society gone wrong!
HERBERT GARRISON
All right, children, I have just been informed that since our school has been attacked by eco-terrorists for the 47th time, we are going to change our school mascot.
CLASS
Awwwwwwww!
STAN
But, Mr. Garrison, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win!
HERBERT GARRISON
That's right, Stanley, the eco-terrorists win. [approaches the students with a stack of papers and begins distributing it] Now, I have here a mascot selection sheet. Every student is supposed to check the box next to the mascot they like the most. And the most popular selection will be the school's new mascot.
CLYDE
But we like being the Cows! [a bucket of real blood is doused on him and the rest of the class gasps.]
DREADLOCKED PETA MAN
You're responsible for the enslavement and genocide of millions!
HERBERT GARRISON
[taking action] Ge-get outta here, PETA! We're changin' the mascot already!
DREADLOCKED PETA MAN
Who'll speak for those who cannot speak for themselves?!
HERBERT GARRISON
[throws some papers at the PETA member] Oh, ge-get outta here! [breaks out a can of mace and sprays it on him] Ge-get out! [the man leaves] Jesus, where do they keep coming from?! [sprays some more for effect] Go on, get outta here.
STAN
This is bullcrap, dude!
HERBERT GARRISON
Now children, it's not that bad. There's plenty of great new mascots on the sheet to chose from. The Hurricanes, the Blizzards, the Redskins, the Indians...
WENDY
But aren't Indians and Redskins just as offensive?
HERBERT GARRISON
No, those are fine. PETA doesn't care about people.
[The school hallway.]
CARTMAN
Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot.
KYLE
Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Giant Douche."
CARTMAN
Ye-heah!
KENNY
(Yeah, totally awesome!)
CARTMAN
Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Turd Sandwich."
KYLE
Turd Sandwich isn't better than Giant Douche.
CARTMAN
Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be so funny!
KYLE
It was my idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in "Giant Douche!" It's way funnier!
CARTMAN
It is not!
KYLE
Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich?
KENNY
(Giant douche.)
CARTMAN
Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week.
KYLE
Stan, do you pick giant douche or turd sandwich?
STAN
Dude, I really don't care. [walks away]
KYLE
[tallies the votes. Behind him, Butters approaches his locker and prepares to open it] That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche.
CARTMAN:
[notices, then runs to Butters and pulls him towards the other boys] ...Wait, wait, what about Butters?
BUTTERS
Huh?
KYLE
You hate Butters.
CARTMAN
Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a super funny turd sandwich?
BUTTERS
Hahaha, a turd sandwich!
KYLE
You misled him, fatass!
CARTMAN
It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.
BUTTERS
[crosses his arms] Yeah! ...What's this for? [the boys approach Jimmy]
KYLE
Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier.
JIMMY
That's a... fantastic idea fellas. Uh, the key to successful humor is s-staying power. Uh, tell me the first mascot idea.
KYLE
A giant douche.
JIMMY
Heh, huh okay, that's pretty funny. Now, what's the second?
CARTMAN
A turd sandwich.
JIMMY
Turhr... Ohokahay. Okay, now let's wait ten seconds. [ten seconds pass] Okay now, t-tell me the first one again?
KYLE
Giant douche.
JIMMY
[snickers] And the second?
CARTMAN
Turd sandwich.
JIMMY
[snickers] Gee, th-they're both screamingly funny, fellas. Better give it another ten seconds.[ten seconds pass] All right, now we'll see which one really has staying power. Number one?
KYLE
A giant douche.
JIMMY
[snickers] Okay, I think, that's it. Number 2?
CARTMAN
Turd sandwich.
JIMMY
[snickers] Gee, I don't know what to say, fellas. They're both instant classics. But I guess I'll have to go with giant douche, simply because the fact that it's a giant renders it useless, adding a parody slant to the satire.
CARTMAN
Awwwww!
BUTTERS
Ohhh, we lost?
KYLE
All right, it's decided. Let's all write in "Giant Douche."
CARTMAN
Okay. You win, Kyle.
[The school gym. The students once again assembles on the bleachers. Herbert Garrison stands before the big-screen TV used in the rally earlier, and the TV reads "New School Mascot '04".]
HERBERT GARRISON
Attention students, we have tallied your mascot nomination sheets, and there will now be a school-wide vote between the top two nominations. So here is the first most-requested candidate, a giant douche. [a giant douche steps out from behind the TV and begins dancing to 2 Unlimited's "Get ready for this."]
KYLE, KENNY
Go, giant douche!
GIANT DOUCHE
Hey, South Park! Have we got school spirit?! [a smattering of applause] We've got spirit, yes we do! Giant douches, me and you! Let's gooooo, Douches! [a smaller smattering of applause]
HERBERT GARRISON
And now your second nominee, Turd Sandwich. [a turd sandwich steps out from behind the TV and begins dancing to Baha Men's "Who Let The Dogs Out?"]
CARTMAN
All right turd sandwich!
BUTTERS
Yeah!
KYLE
Cartman? What the hell?!
CARTMAN
Giant Douche sucks!
TURD SANDWICH
We've got spirit, yes we do! We are sandwiches filled with poo! Yeeaahhh! [a smattering of applause]
HERBERT GARRISON
Students can now cast their choice between the Giant Douche and the Turd Sandwich. We'll count up the votes on Tuesday.
KYLE
You won't get more votes than us, asshole!
CARTMAN
Game on, Jew-boy!
BUTTERS
Yeah, game on, Jew-boy! [looks at Cartman, smiles, and looks back at Kyle]
[The front doors of the school. Stan and Kenny flank the entrance and hand out buttons as the other kids come out.]
KYLE
Be sure to vote for Giant Douche.
KENNY
(Giant Douche! Vote for him!)
KYLE
Giant Douche is your man!
STAN
[exiting] Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot?
KYLE
Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich. [something like an ice cream truck is heard, and Cartman appears driving his Big Wheels bike, pulling a portable stage. Butters is dancing on the stage, dressed as a Hawaiian hula dancer. In his hands he has leis to hand out.]
CARTMAN
Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives. [Butters begins tossing out the leis, and kids step forth to get them. A man shows up as well, but gets nothing] Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow!
KYLE
There. Do you really want that asshole to win?
STAN
I'm not voting!
KYLE
What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the Rock the Vote stuff or, or Puff Daddy's Vote or Die?!
STAN
I just think this whole thing is stupid! [walks off angrily]
KYLE
Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy.
KENNY
(Yeah.)
[The Marsh house, dinnertime. The family is gathered at table, with Marvin at one end, Randy at the other. Sharon comes in with plates and the main course.]
SHARON
How was school today, Stanley?
STAN
It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
SHARON
...What did you say?
RANDY
Did you just say that... voting is ridiculous?
STAN
No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point.
RANDY
[clenches his fists] You don't see the point! Oh, you young people just make me sick!
SHARON
Stanley, do you know how many people died so you could have the right to vote?!
STAN
Mom, I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care.
RANDY
[jumps upright and plants his hands on the table] You don't care?! You really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot?! On your football helmets?! A turd?!
SHARON
Well, hold on, Randy, I think a turd sandwich is a little better than them having a giant douche on their uniforms.
RANDY
You're crazy!! A d-a douche is at least clean!
SHARON
It's sexist, is what it is!
RANDY
You don't understand the issues, Sharon!
SHARON
Are you calling me ignorant?!
RANDY
You think the school mascot should be a turd sandwich? Well you're not exactly Einstein!
SHARON
I am sick of you belittling my opinion, you son of a bitch! [picks up the casserole and chucks it at Randy, who ducks and looks back at her angrily. They both leave the table in opposite directions.]
SHELLY
[leaving the table as well] I hate this family, I hate it! [Stan looks on, shocked, while Marvin continues eating unruffled. The door bell rings. Stan leaves the table and opens the front door. A black man is outside... with his posse]
STAN
Puff Daddy?
PUFF DADDY
Your friend Kyle told me you don't understand the importance of voting.
STAN
I...
PUFF DADDY
Apparently, you haven't heard of my "Vote or Die" campaign. [holds up a shirt with the slogan on it]
STAN
"Vote or Die"? [upset] What the hell does that even mean?!
PUFF DADDY
[whips out a gun from his back pocket, cocks it, and aims it at Stan] What you think it means, bitch!
STAN
Aaaah!
[Music video. Stan is running down the street. An open-roof car pops up behind him and bears down on him.]
POSSE
Vote or die, motherfucker, motherfucker, vote or die!.
PUFF DADDY
Rock the vote or else I'm gonna stick a knife through your eye..
POSSE
Democracy is founded on one simple rule!
[Overhead shot of Puff Daddy, dressed in a white suit, then in a black suit.]
PUFF DADDY
Get out there and vote or I will motherfucking kill you.Yeah.
[At a polling station encouraging one female voter.]
PUFF DADDY
I like it when you vote, bitch! (bitch!)
Shake them titties when you vote, bitch! (bitch!)
[seated as two women dance for him, their asses in his face]
I slam my jimmy through your mouth roof (mouth roof)
[gently spanks a woman as she goes in to vote]
Now get your big ass in the pollin' booth.
[Fish-eye overhead view of Puff Daddy. He shoves his gun into the camera]
I said vote, bitch, or I'll fucking kill you!
[Stan runs until he sees a passageway between two buildings. He does in to try to escape, but Puff Daddy and his crew find him.]
POSSE
Vote or die, motherfucker, motherfucker, vote or die!
PUFF DADDY
You can't run from a .38, go ahead and try!
[Puffy is seated in an armchair wearing a wig, surrounded by women, all in front of a Vegas-style sign saying "DIDDY"]
POSSE
Let your opinion be heard! You gotta make a choice
[Raps to a chrome reflection.]
PUFF DADDY
'Cause after I slit your throat you won't have a fucking voice [Stan runs again, looking behind him, but runs into a gun in his face]
PUFF DADDY
Vote or die! Vote or die! [Puff Daddy's gun is joined by the guns of his posse. Stan is looking at five barrels]
STAN
...Okay. I'll vote.
[Cartman and Butters begin door-to-door campaigning. Cartman knocks on a door and Clyde answers.]
CLYDE
What do you guys want?
CARTMAN
We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school's new mascot.
CLYDE
I haven't decided yet.
CARTMAN
Oh really? Well, that's interesting. You certainly should think about it and make the right decision. [pulls out a wrapped hard candy and shows it] Butterscotch candy?
CLYDE
[reaches out and grabs it] Sure. [opens it]
CARTMAN
Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school?
BUTTERS
A turd sandwich is not only the first turd to be nominated school mascot, but even the first sandwich. [Clyde bites into the candy, producing loud crunches]
CARTMAN
You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd and the bread. And the lettuce, and the olives.
BUTTERS
Whe-where as Giant Douche is just, well, ju-just a, ju-ju-just a giant douche.
CARTMAN
So, come voting day, you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes?
CLYDE
[finishes the candy, then thinks for a few seconds] I'm still not totally sure.
CARTMAN
Well then, perhaps we could interest you in [pulls out another wrapped candy] another butterscotch candy? [Clyde takes the candy and consumes that one as well]
[South Park Elementary, now a polling station. A "Vote for School Mascot!" hangs on the back wall and over the hallway. A reluctant Stan takes a ballot, and Kyle smiles, thinking he has Stan on his side.]
KYLE
You're doing the right thing, Stan. Don't you feel like you're a part of something now?
STAN
I guess... [P Diddy and his posse look on from one end of the polling station, with P cocking his gun]
KYLE
Look, it may not seem important now, but your vote really does count, and we all have to do our part.
STAN
Okay. [finishes up and seals his ballot, then walks away]
KYLE
Woah... wait, what are you doing?
STAN
I'm voting.
KYLE
No, no, you... you wrote down Turd Sandwich.
STAN
Yeah, I know.
KYLE
...Dude, you're supposed to vote for Giant Douche.
STAN
[annoyed] I thought I was supposed to make my own decision.
KYLE
Well yeah, but not if your decision is for Turd Sandwich! What the hell is wrong with you?!
STAN
Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for your guy!
KYLE
Well, I just figured you'd vote for my guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?! [calls out to] Puffy!
CARTMAN
[interrupts] Hey, fuck off, Kyle. [aside, about Puffy and his crew] Don't let them intimidate you, Stan. I'll help walk you to the booth. And then I'm gonna buy you a nice steak dinner with all the trimmings.
STAN
Oh, forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it!
[The Principal's Office, later.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
We've simply had it with your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Voting just doesn't appear to be important to him.
RANDY
Stanley, when you left for school this morning, you said you were going to vote!
STAN
The whole thing is a joke!
SHARON
You see? He's out of control. It's nearly torn our whole family apart.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, my hands are tied. We can no longer have Stan's behavior jeopardizing the other children. He must be removed.
RANDY
Oh! Are you happy now, Stan? You just got yourself suspended!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
No, I'm afraid it's worse than that. By county law I'm bound to enforce the harshest punishment possible.
RANDY
Expulsion?!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
No. Banishment.
STAN
B-bani-banishment?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
You can appeal to the city council, but I don't think it'll do any good. Your son must leave South Park, never to return.
SHARON
[goes over to Randy and cries into his chest] Oh, Randy!
RANDY
Our son, banished! Where did we go wrong?! [cries on Sharon's shoulder]
STAN
You-you're all joking, right?
[A moonlit partly-cloudy night in South Park. The townsfolk are gathered at the edge of town, with Stan facing them all alone. A horse stands at the ready on one side of Main Street.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[steps forth and reads a proclamation] As it was in the times of our forefathers, so it is now. Stan Marsh, for not following our most sacred of rites, you are hereby banished from South Park for all eternity. Or until you decide that voting is important. Good-bye, Stan. May the gods treat you more kindly than we did. [the townsfolk step forth and begin ripping away at Stan's coat and shirt. Herbert Garrison is first: he rips off a piece of Stan's coat, spits on it, and throws it back at Stan. He leaves and Officer Barbady steps forth, repeating what Herbert Garrison did. Craig follows suit, then Kyle steps up]
KYLE
Stan, don't you think this has gone far enough? Is it really that big a deal? [Stan sighs, but says nothing more in response] Yeah, just vote. For Giant Douche.
STAN
I'm not voting! [Kyle then steps forth and repeats what the others did before him]
A BODYGUARD
Yo, Puffy man, are we just gonna let this happen? [cocks his weapon] We've gots to kill this non-votin' fool!
PUFF DADDY
No, Justacious, let him go. He won't survive a fore-night in the wilderness. [the adults tie Stan up on the horse backwards and send him off with supplies to tide him over for a while]
RANDY
This is breaking your mother's heart, Stan. She couldn't even help tie you to the horse.
STAN
Dad, isn't this a little extreme?
RANDY
Jesus. I guess maybe you'll never understand how important voting is. [puts a pail over Stan's head] Goodbye, Son. [stops for a few seconds, then swats the horse to get it moving. The horse walks off slowly. Stephen Stotch steps up with a horn and blows into it. Randy and Sharon stand together, embracing shoulders] That's... one of the hardest things a parent ever has to do.
[A plain, night. Stan rides into the night and into the morning on the plain, then through a desert, then into a forest. A group of people appear and spot him]
BEARDED PETA MEMBER
Look! What is that?
BLONDE PETA MEMBER 2
Oh, the poor thing!
STAN
Hello? [the people gather round and remove the pail]
BLONDE PETA MEMBER 2
Don't worry, we'll free you.
BEARDED PETA MEMBER
Just sit still for a moment.
STAN
Oh, thank God.
BEARDED PETA MEMBER
Get offa him, you filthy human! [they throw Stan off the horse. The pail rolls away. Stan looks back, confused, tufts of hair popping out through the holes on his torn cap. The people were apparently talking to the horse, not to him. The camera goes back to the horse, and the people are shown to be members of PETA. They're cleaning the horse up]
BLONDE PETA MEMBER 2
Poor thing needs water.
BEARDED PETA MEMBER
You're safe now.
BLONDE PETA MEMBER 2
Shame on you, making this horse your slave. [a balding man throws real blood on Stan]
STAN
Awww!
BLONDE PETA MEMBER 2
Come, you can live with us.
BEARDED PETA MEMBER
We will give you food and shelter.
STAN
What about me?
BEARDED PETA MEMBER
Open the gate! [A pair of gates open up to the PETA compound. The members lead the horse in and Stan trails along. They approach whom looks to be the leader of the compound. The compound itself has all kinds of animals - it's an animal sanctuary]
BLONDE PETA MEMBER
[presenting the horse]This poor creature is in need of food and water.
BALDING MAN
[strokes the horse's mane] You have a home here, friend.
BEARDED PETA MEMBER
The... kid wants to stay, too.
STAN
I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna ride it.
BALDING MAN
I don't know if you can stay. We'll have to ask Dr. Cornwallis. Come. [they walk among the animals. Stan looks around and takes it all in.] We don't normally allow outsiders. See, here we live in harmony with animals. They're not our pets but our fellow living beings. We work with the animals and try to live as they do. [stops, lowers his pants, and shits onto the ground. Stan looks on astonishment, then walks around the pile of shit as the man pulls his pants back up and walks on.] We make friends with the animals. We coexist, and we... intermarry. [approaches a llama and puts his arm around her neck] This is my wife, Janice. [Stan looks on quizzically] The outside world looks down on a man marrying a llama, but our love knows no boundaries. [he turns to the llama, has her face him, and starts kissing her. Stan just gawks at the pair]
STAN
Wow, you guys really love animals.
BALDING MAN
[moves on to a man and a chicken] And why not? Mark here has been with Kelly for three years now. [moves on to another man and an ostrich] And Gary and Sally here have just managed to have a child together. [in a manger is an ostrich-baby, somewhat humanoid with an ostrich beak]
OSTRICH-BABY
Kill me...
BALDING MAN
Yes, life here is good and natural. But now that you know where our compound is, you'll either have to live with us, or be murdered. [they stop before a tent]
STAN
I'll live with you.
BALDING MAN
It's not up to you. You'll have to talk with Dr. Cornwallis. [Stan pauses at the tent's entrance, then enters and approaches a goat, which is munching on hay. The goat stops and looks at Stan, then resumes eating. Stan exits the tent] What did he say?
STAN
He said I can stay.
BALDING MAN
Excellent! Dr. Cornwallis is wise beyond his year. Here's your PETA shirt and a bumper sticker. [Stan looks at his new stuff]
[SP Public Access Presents: Debate 2004.]
ANNOUNCER
This is Debate 2004 with your host, Jim Lehrer.
JIM LEHRER
Welcome to the cable-access televised debate between a giant douche [screen left] and a turd sandwich [screen right] We'll start with Giant Douche. Sir, some students and parents are reluctant to have a... giant douche represent them. What do you say to those people?
GIANT DOUCHE
Jim, first of all I would like to thank you for monitoring this debate. And I would like to thank all of the students and their parents for coming.
CARTMAN
Aww, suck-up, suck-up! [a man behind him and to his right leans over and shushes him] What?! That's an obvious suck-up move.
GIANT DOUCHE
But I would hope that those students and their parents who question my qualities would simply look at my opponent. He is a turd sandwich
TURD SANDWICH
[leaning forward] You're a turd sandwich.
GIANT DOUCHE
... No, sir, if you'll pardon me, you are in fact, the turd sandwich.
TURD SANDWICH
[quickly countering] You're a turd sandwich.
GIANT DOUCHE
... Sir, you are a turd sandwich.
TURD SANDWICH
[quickly countering] You're a turd sandwich.
JIM LEHRER
Ahh, Turd Sandwich, I will ask you not to speak out of turn.
TURD SANDWICH
I-I'm sorry, Jim.
GIANT DOUCHE
Anyway, as I was saying, ahh... wait, I-I forgot what I was saying.
TURD SANDWICH
Ha. What a douche.
JIM LEHRER
All right, Turd Sandwich, this next question is for you. How should South Park Elementary enforce its laws of conduct for young athletes during sporting events.
TURD SANDWICH
[long pause] ...Uh, you know, uh, my opponent wouldn't even know the answer to that question. If you ask him the same question, he would not answer it. [Giant Douche just looks at him] He would stand around and just babble on and on about nothing until he was finally saved by the buzze-. [the buzzer sounds over his last two words.]
JIM LEHRER
Your time is up, Turd.
[The PETA compound, next morning. Stan scrubs away at the empty tubs and buckets of food the animals ate from the previous day. The bald man approaches.]
BALDING MAN
Stan, I want to introduce you to my stepdaughter, Teresa. [the camera pans down to show a lamb with small horns] She seems to have taken a liking to you. [suggestively] And she's ovulating.
STAN
Ahh, no thanks, that's okay.
BALDING MAN
Stan, some PETA members are growing concerned that maybe you don't love animals.
STAN
I do love animals, just ...not like you guys do.
BALDING MAN
You... don't belong here, Stan. You should return home.
STAN
I can't. I was banished for not voting.
BALDING MAN
But, why on earth wouldn't you wanna vote?
STAN
I think voting is great. I just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
BALDING MAN
But Stan, don't you know? It's always between a giant douche and a turd sandwich. Nearly every election since the beginning of time has been between some douche and some turd. They're the only people who suck up enough to make it that far in politics.
STAN
I guess... I guess you're right. [casts his eyes down and to the left in reflection. An arm appears, with a gun at the end aimed at Stan]
PUFF DADDY
Yo, what did I say was going to happen to you, bitch? [his four bodyguards aim their guns at Stan as well]
STAN
[jumps] Aaah!
MAN IN SHORTS
[pops in] Aaaah!! He's wearing the skin of an animal! [runs off, only to return with a pail of real blood] Take that! [throws the blood at Puff Daddy, who spreads his arms out and down. The man calms down] I... hope that teaches you a lesson about wearing fur.
PUFF DADDY
Itius, Rodicus! [the bodyguards fire their weapons at the PETA members]
BODYGUARD
Vote or die!
STAN
[braves his way through the crossfire, but gets hit on his left shoulder] Aaaah!! [keeps moving]
PETA MAN
[goes to shield a dog] Protect the animals! Protect the animals! [he's shot and falls away. The dog then urinates on the man's head]
BALDING MAN
[rushes up to his llama and holds her] Janice, we shall die together in each other's arms! [three shots kill him and the llama prances away. More PETA members fall.]
OSTRICH-BABY
Kill me! Kill meee!! [Dr. Cornwallis is out of his tent and munching on the head of a dead man]
[South Park Elementary polling station. Mr. Mackey tallies up the votes.]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay... that's one more vote for Turd Sandwich.
RANDY
[through clenched teeth] So who won, Mr. Mackey?
MR. MACKEY
It's pretty close, but it looks like Giant Douche is gonna win.
CARTMAN
Oh, no! Noooo!!
KYLE
Ha! You lose, fatass!
BUTTERS
[by the doors, motions to the others to look] Uh hey, wait a minute! [the others present gather round and look out. Stan approaches the school, battered and injured, and the others stream out of the school]
RANDY
Stan!
SHARON
Stan, you came back. Does that mean... you learned the importance of voting?
STAN
I learned that I'd better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because it's usually the choice I'll have.
RANDY
He's going to vote!
TOWNSFOLK
[murmuring amongst themselves] He's going to vote. He's going to vote. [they gather round and hoist Stan up, carrying him inside. Stan is lowered and he fills out the ballot. He holds his shoulder and thinks a moment while images of an eagle, the White House, and the US flag float in the background. He makes up his mind, he votes for Turd Sandwich. He considers his vote, then approaches the ballot box and drops his ballot in. Mr. Mackey, holding the box, spins around in his chair happily.]
SINGER
Let's get out the vote! Let's make our voices heard!
We've been given the right to choose between a douche and a turd.
It's democracy in action! Put your freedom to the test.
A big, fat turd or a stupid douche. Which do you like best?
MR. MACKEY
[Adding Stan's vote to the tally] Stan's vote bring the total votes for Turd Sandwich to... thirty six! And Giant Douche has... one thousand, four hundred, and ten. Giant Douche still wins!
SOME TOWNSFOLK
Yeah! All right!
OTHER TOWNSFOLK
Aawwww!
STAN
Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter!
RANDY
Hey! That's not true, Stan.
SHARON
[genuflects behind Stan] You can't judge the merits of voting on whether or not your candidate won.
RANDY
[genuflects behind Stan] Your vote still mattered.
HERBERT GARRISON
[rushing into the school] Hey everybody! [holds up a shredded PETA shirt. Everyone turns and looks] They just found all the PETA members murdered at their compound! [all gasp]
MR. MACKEY
What the? They're all dead? Well, that means...
CLYDE
That we can go back to being the South Park Cows! [opens his jacket and shows off his Cows shirt]
ALL
Hooray! All right!
RANDY
[to Stan] Now your vote didn't matter.
End of Douche and Turd


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:In order to save South Park, Stan and Kyle have to find a way to destroy the ever-expanding Wall Mart superstore while keeping Cartman from stabbing them in the back.

script:Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes

[South Park, day. A lovely tree appears and the camera pans down to street level. Stan and friends are on the sidewalk across the street moving along.]
CARTMAN
You guys know what? Um, the last thing you do when you die, is crap your pants.
STAN
...What?
CARTMAN
Yeah, when you die, your jowels release and crap comes flying out your ass. [laughs heartily. The other boys stop]
KYLE
That is fucking stupid, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Oh yeah?! I'll bet you five bucks that when you die you crap your pants, asshole!
HERBERT GARRISON
Hey everybody, it's time! [everyone stops and looks] It's time!
TOWNSFOLK
[a small group] It's time. Oh, it's time? It's happening. It's happening now? Let's go! [they move off to their left]
STAN
It's time for what?
HERBERT GARRISON
Get down to Metzger's Field! It's about to happen! [everyone follows him towards the field]
[Metzger's Field, later. A man is speaking to the crowd gathered there.]
MANAGER
People of South Park I am pleased to be with you on this most historic day. A day you were certainly all remember... as the day your town... became great. The grand opening of the first South Park... Wall-Mart! [the camera zooms out to show the full scope of the store. Everyone applauds and cheers]
RANDY
[hugging Sharon] Look at it, honey. It's so big.
HERBERT GARRISON
[hugging Mr. Slave] It's like we're a real town now. [the boys finally arrive]
CARTMAN
Whoa, awesome!
KYLE
Hey! Isn't there where Stark's Pond used to be? Where we used to kayak and fish?
MAN
Yeah! Now it's a Wall-Mart!
MANAGER
I know that with the opening of the South Park branch of Wall-Mart, you will all see your town completely change... [walks over to the entrance, which has a banner across it: "Grand Opening."] Now, shop friends. Shop! [steps aside and the doors open to a spacious store. The townsfolk rush inside]
RANDY
It's beautiful!
MARVIN MARSH
[greeting shoppers at the door.] Welcome to Wall-Mart. Welcome to Wall-Mart. ...Welcome to Wall-Mart.
SHEILA
Sharon, isn't that your father?
SHARON
Yes. Wall-Mart is the leading employer of seniors. And they also employ the handicapped.
JIMMY
[approaching] Hello, Mrs. M-marsh. Can I help g- Can I help you get a sh- shopping cart today?
SHARON
Why yes, I'd love one, Jimmy. [Jimmy turns and approaches a line of carts. He tugs at the one in the front, wrestling it away from the other carts. Once it's out far enough, he jumps to the rear and pushes it out]
CHEF
[awestruck] My God. Look at all these incredible bargains.
CARTMAN
[the boys are in the movie aisle] Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks!
KYLE
Why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie?
CARTMAN
Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty bucks!
KYLE
You only need one copy, r-tard!
CARTMAN
Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight!
KYLE
Okay, fine, I will! [grabs a copy] H-wait a minute! I don't even want one copy of Time Cop! [puts it back]
CARTMAN
Dude, you can't shop for crap. [a wide shot of the store]
WOMAN
[shopping with her husband] I can't believe these bargains.
MANAGER
[from an office window above the showroom floor] Fools. Ignorant fools.
[The Marsh house, night. The living room has been redecorated with items got from Wall-Mart. The family is enjoying snacks in fancy plasticware.]
RANDY
Just look at the Marsh family, huh? Brand-new television, new plastic dishware and cups, and enough bulk-buy ramen to last us a thousand winters. [three huge pallets of ramen are shown]
STAN
Dad, how come Wall-Mart is able to sell everything so cheap?
RANDY
It's simple economics, son. I don't understand it at all, but, God I love it.
[The Marsh house, later. The house is asleep; Randy is dreaming, and reacting to his dreams.]
WHISPERS
Six ninety-nine, fifteen dollars, free for fifteen ninety-eight...
RANDY
[suddenly awake] Aaaah! [looks at the window and crawls out of bed, then walks towards the window. He plants his hands on the window panes, and in the distance he sees that great shining beacon called Wall-Mart. He opens his pajama shirt and presses his body against the window. A soft sigh leaves his lungs...] Yeaaah... [Sharon wakes up]
SHARON
Randy, what are you doing?!
RANDY
[wraps himself up again and goes back to bed] Anu-nothing! [puts on his slippers] I'ma-I'ma-I'm just gonna head down to the Wall-Mart real quick.
SHARON
It's almost midnight.
RANDY
Yeah, think about it. If I go there now, there won't be anybody else there. [with determination] I can have all the bargains to myself! [heads out]
[Wall-Mart, midnight. Randy enters dressed in pajamas and robe, only to find more shoppers in there. Wall-Mart never closes, and it's never empty. An elderly lady greets him.]
ELDERLY WOMAN
Thanks for coming to Wall-Mart. [waves] All are welcome. All are welcome! [Randy is stunned that he's not the only shopper there]
[Next morning, the boys are on a sidewalk heading towards downtown.]
CARTMAN
Excuse me! Hello?! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall-Mart has them for three bucks cheaper?
KYLE
Dude, I can't deal with Wall-Mart right now. My parents had me there for three hours last night. [they pass by a man closing up his shop for the last time]
MR. FARKLE
Oh, sorry boys. I'm going out of business.
KYLE
Why, Mr. Farkle?
MR. FARKLE
I can't compete with Wall-Mart's low prices. Everyone is shopping there now, and... well, I can't make ends meet. [Cartman pulls out a violin from somewhere and begins playing it masterfully] I've got to sell the store and try to find another line of work.
KYLE
[glares at Cartman] Cartman, stop it!
CARTMAN
What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle.
MR. FARKLE
I appreciate your business, boys, but you'll have to try somewhere else in town. [walks away sobbing]
KYLE
See?! That sucks, dude!
CARTMAN
What? That's called progress, Kyle.
KYLE
Yeah, but what about all the people getting laid off from the grocery stores? [Cartman whips out the violin and plays it again] And what about all the- [looks at Cartman, takes away his violin, breaks it in half using his leg, and throws the pieces to the ground]
CARTMAN
... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall-Mart. It was only five bucks. [gives Kyle the finger, turns around, and walks away. Kyle watches him leave]
STAN
Come on, let's go to Main Street and support one of those stores. [Kyle turns, and the three remaining boys walk away.]
[Downtown, later. The boys arrive at Main Street and are startled.]
KYLE
What the hell? [before them is a downtown that is shuttered and decayed. The asphalt is gone from the roads and eagles hover over the area. A window crashing makes them jump, and Butters appears around a corner, making weird noises.]
STAN
Butters? [more strange noises come from Butters' mouth]
KYLE
Butters? What the hell are you doing?
BUTTERS
Wull ah I'm just playin' Monster. It's kinda spooky out here. [this is true. Butters resumes his monster act.]
STAN
Dude, we gotta show our parents what Wall-Mart is doing to our town. [the boys turn and leave.]
[The Marsh house, later. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny enter to find a house stuffed with Wall-Mart items.]
STAN
Dad? [looks around at all the stuff] Jesus Christ, Da-dad! Dad?!
RANDY
Staaaan? [the boys hear him and rush over to the source of the noises]
STAN
Dad, oh my God!
RANDY
Staan...
STAN
What? D-dad, are are you dying?
RANDY
No, I'm just... really, really tired. I... was shopping at Wall-Mart all night.
STAN
But you-your face!
RANDY
Checkout line... They had these... little stickers filled with glitter! They were only ninety nine cents for 15 of them. I couldn't resist! Do you want one? [tears one off and sticks it to Stan's cheek] Here. It's a little turtle. [faints and falls over]
[Wall-Mart, later. Shopping continues as usual. In his office, the Manager nervously reaches into his desk drawer and pulls out a bottle of liquor. He takes two sips and quickly hides it when he hears a knock at his door.]
MANAGER
Come in? [the boys and their parents, Butters' parents, Chef, Herbert Garrison and Mr. Slave all enter] Oh hello, fine shoppers.
CHEF
Sir, we just had a big town meeting, and decided we don't want your Wall-Mart here anymore.
RANDY
We're sorry, but it seems our Main Street is dying and good people are losing their jobs. We'd all like you... out of South Park.
MANAGER
[begins to cackle nervously] What? What, you think I want to be here? I hate this place. But it... won't let me leave.
KYLE
But you run the Wall-Mart.
MANAGER
Oh, you're wrong! [rises from his chair and moves towards the group] Wall-Mart... isn't run by anybody! First it reels you in with its bargains. Next thing you know you, you're working at the Wall-Mart because it has all the jobs. Then you're sitting in a little office, trapped on all sides.
CHEF
They why don't you just quit?!
MANAGER
[whispering loudly] Not so loud! It can hear you.
KYLE
You hate Wall-Mart, too? [rumbles emanate from the walls]
MANAGER
Aah! [nervously] I didn't say that! I love Wall-Mart! With all its... fantastic bargains and one-stop shopping, who can't love it, right? [turns around and grabs some papers] Uh, Wa-Wall-Mart takes the hassle out of shopping and, and makes it both affordable and fun. [he writes as he talks, then shows the group what he wrote: "NOT SAFE TO TALK HERE."] Ah-and Wall-Mart really gives back to the community! Us people are certainly happy to have a store like Wall-Mart, aren't we? [writes some more and shows the group a second sheet: "MEET ME OUT BACK IN 5 MINS." He grimaces and tries to hint at them. The group leaves.]
RANDY
Hey, wait a minute, I think we just got squirreled.
GERALD
Yeah. That guy probably thinks he can get us to go away by being so goofy! [circles his finger round his ear to indicate insanity. Seconds later the manager screams and flies out the window, only to end up hanging himself. The group looks on as the manager's pants drop off and poo follows shortly]
CARTMAN
[catching up with the other boys] Ha! You owe me five bucks, Kyle!
[The Marsh house, night. The family is at table waiting for dinner. Sharon walks in with steaks.]
SHARON
Here we go, everyone. I got three nice steaks from South Park Grocery. We'll have to share them.
RANDY
Heh, I remember when we could afford to buy six steaks when we shopped at Wall-Mart.
STAN
Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall-Mart anymore.
RANDY
I know, I know! God! [pounds the table] Bleeeh! [Sharon joins them at table and the family begins eating]
STAN
Mom, Dad, when people die, do they always crap their- [knocks over his glass of milk, which spills onto Shelly]
SHELLY
Oh, you stupid turd!
RANDY
Oh Jesus, a broken glass! Well, I don't see any choice now! We have to go to Wall-Mart!
SHARON
We do?
RANDY
Huh! Where else are we gonna get a new glass at this hour?! Everyone get your shoes on, we're goin' to Wall-Mart!
STAN
But Dad, we're not supposed to shop at-
RANDY
STAN! One family buying one glass isn't gonna make a difference!
[Wall-Mart, night. The Marsh family arrives and sees what Randy saw before.]
RANDY
Heeeey... [The Broflovskis approach and Randy looks] Gerald, what are you doing?! We said we weren't going to shop at the Wall-Mart anymore!
GERALD
Well where else was I gonna get a napkin dispenser at nine thirty at night?
RANDY
[noticing other familiar faces] Mr. Garrison! Chef! Jimbo! [the shoppers stop and look] Now, come on people! What the hell is wrong with you?! Don't you see what you're all doing?!
HERBERT GARRISON
Well what are you doing here, Randy?
RANDY
I came because I wanted to make sure nobody was shopping here.
STAN
Dad!
RANDY
Oh all right, maybe I was gonna buy a glass. One glass! ... And some chips. And butter. [pulls out a sheet and looks at it] And some new pliers.
GERALD
Jesus! Look at us! We all don't like the Wall-Mart, but we can't stop coming here.
JIMBO
It's like some mystical evil force.
RANDY
Yeah. This place has a power over us we can't resist! We have to find a way to put the South Park Wall-Mart out of business once and for all!
HERBERT GARRISON
Let's burn it down!
CHEF
No, no, no! Let's freeze it!
STEPHEN
I think it's best we try to reason with it.
KYLE
No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall-Mart anymore! If you want it to go away, all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility.
[Outside, later. The Wall-Mart is on fire and the shoppers are watching it burn.]
RANDY
Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya. [the people begin to sway back and forth]
ALL
Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya. Kumbaya, my Lord...
[Sidewalk, next day. The boys are walking along.]
CARTMAN
You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you?
KYLE
[looking at Cartman] It wasn't my idea to burn the Wall-Mart down.
CARTMAN
No, but you got everyone all worked up! You're always jealous of the Wall-Mart. You always hated it.
KYLE
Dude, our town is going to be better without the- [sounds of construction are heard. Kyle turns to look. ] What the?
CARTMAN
Oh, awesome! [rushes towards Wall-Mart]
KYLE
How... How did this happen? [the other boys make their way to the store, then look around at the restored store, which is running as if nothing had happened the night before. Kyle's parents are shopping there, and they run into the boys.] Mom, Dad? Why are you shopping here?
GERALD
We can't destroy it, son. We have to learn to live with it.
RANDY
Can I help you? [the boys turn around and see the man is Randy, and the jump back in fright]
STAN
Dad, what are you doing?!
RANDY
You get a discount working here. Ten percent. That means the bargains are even better.
STAN
Dad, you're a geologist!
RANDY
I'll make less money, sure, but... as long as I buy everything at Wall-Mart, it'll all even out. Don't you see? Wall-Mart isn't our enemy, it's our neighborhood friend.
[Outside. The boys walk away from Wall-Mart and see a driver lifting I-beams into place with his crane.]
KYLE
Hey! Hey! [the driver looks at them] Who the hell told you to put this thing back up?!
DRIVER
Sorry kid, we've got orders from corporate headquarters.
KYLE
But nobody wants a Wall-Mart here!
DRIVER
You're gonna have to talk to the higher-ups.
STAN
Where are they?
DRIVER
Bentonville, Arkansas. That's where Wall-Mart started, that's where all the bigwigs are. [drives away]
KYLE
Looks like we're gonna have to go to Arkansas. Come on, guys. We're gonna put a stop to Wall-Mart once and for all!
CARTMAN
[Inside the store] Whoa, Pixie Sticks, twenty-nine ceeeents? [freezes in place and hears sounds] Wall-Mart? ...Are you speaking to me? ...My friends? ...Trying to hurt you again? [turns a little angry] Yes, Wall-Mart. I understand. [with a look of determination, he leaves the store.]
[Coyote Lines, night. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are at the ticket booth.]
STAN
Three tickets to Bentonville, Arkansas, please.
CARTMAN
[rushing up to join them] Wait! Guys! Hold on! I wanna go with you and help out.
KYLE
No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the Wall-Mart.
CARTMAN
Nuh-uh.
KYLE
Yeah, huh! You wanna go with us so that later you go, "Haha! I was working for Wall-Mart all along!" or something.
CARTMAN
I am not, Kyle!
STAN
Dude, just let him come. The bus is about to leave. [he and Kenny head for the doors]
KYLE
All right, fine. Come on, fatass! [leaves to catch up with Stan.]
CARTMAN
[pulls out a knife from his back pocket] Haha. You fools have no idea that I would never let you hurt the Wall-Mart.
KYLE
[rushes out to face Cartman] I heard that!
CARTMAN
You heard what?
KYLE
You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall-Mart!
CARTMAN
That's not what I said! [Stan comes out to see what's going on]
STAN
Dude, come on!
KYLE
He is working for the Wall-Mart to stop us from succeeding!
STAN
Dude, we have to go!
KYLE
God-damnit! [turns and heads towards Stan]
STAN
Well hurry up if you're coming, Cartman!
CARTMAN
[to himself] Hehe. You stupid fools have no idea that I'm actually working for the Wall-Mart to stop you from succeeding!
[Bentonville, Home of Wall-Mart. A bus pulls up to the store's headquarters and lets the four boys off.]
STAN
Goddamn, that took a long time.
KYLE
It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires!
CARTMAN
[drawing out the syllables] I did not! I wanna close Wall-Mart just as much as you guys do!
[Corporate Headquarters, inside. A cavernous warehouse opens up before them, with busy workers, and a receptionist greets them.]
RECEPTIONIST
Can I help you?
KYLE
Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall-Mart in our town.
RECEPTIONIST
Who does? Nobody likes what the Wall-Mart does, but it keeps... right on doing it.
KYLE
We want to talk to who's in charge.
RECEPTIONIST
In charge? I guess that would be Harvey Brown. He's the current president of Wall-Mart. One of the original creators.
STAN
Where's he?
[An ashtray. A hand rubs spent cigarette butts into it. The camera pulls out to reveal the president and the boys, and lots of empty glasses of liquor.]
HARVEY BROWN
We... invented the Wall-Mart Super Center in 1987. The idea was simple: build a store for one-stop shopping where bulk purchases could keep prices incredibly low. [defeated, buries his face in his left hand] We didn't know what we were doing. In just four years, it was out of control.
KYLE
So how do we stop it?
HARVEY BROWN
[raises his head] You don't stop it.
STAN
There has to be a way!
HARVEY BROWN
There's nothing! Don't you understand?! Nothing can stop the Wall-Mart in your town! ...Unless... of course, you can find and destroy its heart.
KYLE
The heart of Wall-Mart?
CARTMAN
Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much?
HARVEY BROWN
Every Wall-Mart has a heart, somewhere near the television department. Destroy the heart and you could reverse the entire process!
CARTMAN
You speak too much, sir!
STAN
Why don't you guys just destroy the heart?
HARVEY BROWN
Because the Wall-Mart stops you. Many have tried, kid. Union leaders, nature activists, even the best fair-trade lawyers tried to stop the Wall-Mart and now. They are Wall-Mart shoppers all.
KYLE
All right. C'mon you guys. We have to get back home. [they drop down and leave the room]
HARVEY BROWN
[shakes his head] It won't work, don't you understand?! It isn't gonna stop until there's nothing but Wall-Mart left! Jesus, what did we do?! What did we do?! [the boys are at the doors, about to leave. Mr. Brown spins around on his stool] Boys! [the boys turn and see him take a gun to his head] Tell the world... I'm sorry! [the boys are alarmed]
STAN
No, dude, don't! [Mr. Brown shoots himself through the temple and falls over on his left side, dead. Seconds later he craps through his pants, leaving a hole in them and a fallen bar stool nearby. A few moments of shock, and then Cartman cracks up]
CARTMAN
[pointing to Kyle] That's ten bucks you owe me, dick-face!
[A stormy night in front of Wall-Mart. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny arrive dressed in camouflage.]
KYLE
All right, this is it! If Wall-Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall-Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it.
CARTMAN
[rushes in and blocks their path. holding a dagger] I'm afraid not, Kyle! Wall-Mart is a great store! I could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains! You see, I was working for Wall-Mart all along!
KYLE
I knew you were!
CARTMAN
No, you didn't.
KYLE
Yes, I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this!
CARTMAN
No, you didn't.
KYLE
Yes, I did!
CARTMAN
No, you didn't.
KYLE
Yes, I did!
CARTMAN
No, you didn't.
KYLE
Yes, I did!
CARTMAN
No, you didn't.
KYLE
Yes. I did! [a few more rounds of this and they stand head to head, silent]
CARTMAN
...You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu-
KYLE
[interrupting] -slashed the bus tires in Arkansas! I said so! I told you the minute that I- [Cartman babbles loudly to drown him out] -and I told you that-
CARTMAN
[plugs his ears] I can't hear you! Lalalalalala! [once he's sure Kyle is quiet, he unplugs his ears and pulls out his dagger] I'm sorry, boys. But if you want to hurt the Wall-Mart, you'll have to go through me! [holds out the dagger, ready for battle.]
KYLE
[he and Stan walk around Cartman] We don't have time for this! Kenny, keep him away from us! [Kenny does as told]
CARTMAN
Very well, Kenny! Let us battle! [Kenny begins delivering blows at Cartman] Ow, Kenny. K-Kenny! Knock it off.
[Stan and Kyle enter the store and walk past the greeter Marvin Marsh.]
MARVIN MARSH
Welcome to Wall-Mart.
STAN
Save it, Grandpa!
KYLE
We've gotta find the television department. [the lights flicker and turn off. Randy leaps into view in front of the boys, carrying an ax. Stan and Kyle scream]
RANDY
Boys, these axes are only four ninety-nine.
STAN
Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall-Mart.
RANDY
Shhhhh! What are you talking about?
STAN
One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department.
RANDY
Television department... All right, come on, let's go! [they move down the aisle for some distance. Randy stops and jumps] Oh my God!
STAN
What?!
RANDY
Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers! They were three dollars five minutes ago! The Wall-Mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us!
STAN
Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back! [the three make their way to the back, but Randy can't help but look at all the bargains]
RANDY
Gaaah! Don't look! Don't look at its bargains! [they come across a bunch of bikes priced at $29.99. They scream and run off. The boys run down another aisle, but Randy isn't with them.]
KYLE
I think I see the television department in the back!
STAN
Is that the right way, Dad? Dad?! [looks around, then turns to his right. Kyle turns to his left. Both boys see Randy] Dad!
RANDY
The screwdriver set is only nine ninety-eight!
STAN
Come on, Dad!
RANDY
I can't make it, boys! You're gonna have to go on without me!
STAN
No, dad! We need your keys!
RANDY
This bargain is too great for me! I'm gonna have to buy these! Here! Take the keys and go on! [tosses the keys to Stan, who catches them] The television department is near the back! Next to the cell phones! Go! Hurry! I'm gonna go buy these screwdrivers! [the boys leave the aisle]
STAN
[passing the candy display] There! The television department!
[The television department. The wall is lined with TVs of all sizes. A hand appears and presses a button, and all the TVs turn on, showing the boys on screen. The camera pans over to the two boys, who are looking at a man dressed in white.]
WALL-MART
Hello, boys. Congratulations on getting this far. [the boys approach him]
KYLE
Who are you?
WALL-MART
I am... Wall-Mart. [the boys look at each other]
STAN
You?
WALL-MART
I've taken this form in order to talk to you. But I can take many forms. [dons a brimmed hat] Does this suit you better? Or perhaps you prefer this form? [takes off the hat and puts on a robe] I can take whichever form I like. [removes the robe and puts on a pirate hat and black patch over his left eye.]
STAN
We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you.
KYLE
Where's the heart?
WALL-MART
To find the heart of Wall-Mart, one must first ask oneself, "Who is it that asked the question?" [the boys look at each other again]
STAN
Me. I'm asking the question.
WALL-MART
Ah, yes, but who are you?
STAN
Stan Marsh. Now, where's the heart?
WALL-MART
Ah. You know the answer, but not the question!
KYLE
The question is, "Where is the heart?"
WALL-MART
Very well. You want to see the heart of Wall-Mart? It lies beyond that plasma-screen television. [the boys look to their right and walk over. The open a small door marked "EMPLOYEES ONLY" and they open it. A rectangular mirror is behind it.]
STAN
It's a mirror.
WALL-MART
Yes, don't you see? That is the heart of Wall-Mart. You, the consumer. I take many forms: Wall-Mart, K-Mart, Target. But I am one single entity: Desire!
STAN
Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy the heart. [the boys turn and face the mirror again, and Kyle takes a black mallet to it. It shatters.]
WALL-MART
Gaaah! No! No, what have you done?! [the building begins to rumble] Now you shall see my true form! [Removes his mustache and begins to march around with vigor and laughing harshly] Now you see me as I truly am!
STAN
We'd better get out of here. [outside, Cartman and Kenny stop wrestling and witness the Wall-Mart rumbling and there's lighting flying around it. Inside, Stan and Kyle make their way to the front doors]
CHEF
[panicking] Get out! It's gonna blow! [the shoppers pay heed]
STAN
Dad, come on! We've gotta get out!
RANDY
Too late for me, son! I have to buy this stuff!
KYLE
The Wall-Mart is imploding! Everybody out NOW! [the shoppers and employees now bolt for the doors and run out as an M in Mart falls down.]
[Outside on the parking lot, night. The building begins to collapse as everyone gathers in the parking lot. The building distorts, folds up and implodes into a shining blue dot, then reappears as crap, which falls to the ground where the Wall-Mart once stood. Cartman looks on in astonishment, then cracks up and walks away.]
HERBERT GARRISON
[proudly] Boys, you did it! You killed the Wall-Mart! [the crowd cheers]
GERALD
How did you do it, Kyle?
KYLE
All Wall-Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back.
CHEF
We know how to destroy it now. Spread the word to all the towns! [nearby, a soldier sits at the ready to send out the news on a telegraph]
RANDY
Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror. The Wall-Mart... is us.
KYLE
Duh.
RANDY
You see boys, if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies, we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more. Do you understand?
GERALD
Yeah! Let's all go shop at Jim's Drugs down the street! [the crowd approves and marches down the street]
[Jim's Drugs, later. He reopens for business and the crowd flocks to his store. Later, the small store is replaced by a larger two-story building, which in turn is replaced by a huge building reminiscent of the departed Wall-Mart, which in turn leads to Jim's Drugs' demise by fire.]
CROWD
...Oh Lord, Kumbaya.
RANDY
All right, let's not make that mistake again.
HERBERT GARRISON
Yeah, lets all shop over at True Value!
CROWD
Let's go! Yeah! [the crowd moves to the store as one]
End of Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The kid who took the fall for the boys five years ago is getting out of Juvie, and his first order of business is revenge

script:Pre-School

[South Park Elementary, day. The school bell rings. Some fourth graders chat in the hall as Wendy passes by: Clyde talking to Kenny and Kyle.]
CLYDE
Yeah, and it was called Man from Atlantis, and he had like, webbed fingers... [Stan rushes up to them and grabs Kyle by the coat]
STAN
Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now!
KYLE
Okay, hang on a second I-
STAN
[pulls Kyle away] Right now, goddamnit!
KYLE
All right, all right! [Stan pulls him further away until there's no one around them] Dude, what is the matter with you?
STAN
[the look of fear is strong on his face] Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall. [the boys are suddenly afraid]
KENNY
(WHAT??!!!?)
KYLE
Trent Boyett?! The kid from preschool?!
STAN
Yeah! He just got paroled!
KYLE
Oh, no! No!
CARTMAN
Hey gay-butts, what's goin' on?
KYLE
Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall.
CARTMAN
Really? That's cool. When did- [realizes what Kyle has just said and stops completely in place] What did you say? [rushes up to Kyle] Trent Boyett?! Meanest, dirtiest, toughest kid in the world, super-pissed off at us, Trent Boyett?!
KYLE
Yeah.
CARTMAN
Oh, Holy Jesus, God...
STAN
What the hell are we gonna do??
BUTTERS
[runs up to the boys] Is it true?! Trent Boyett is getting out?!
CARTMAN
It's true.
BUTTERS
Oh Jesus, Oh Christ in Heaven, I gotta hide! [rushes off to do that, past the other kids in the hall to the front door...] Uh, oh boy! [bursts through the front doors and runs away babbling]
CARTMAN
He's gonna come for us, you guys. We are dead men.
KYLE
Look, maybe he's forgiven us. I mean, we were only in preschool.
[Flashback to preschool days. It's playtime, and the kids are busy doing things, sliding and such.]
STAN
Dude, let's play Fireman.
KYLE
Totally, dude, let's play Fireman.
CARTMAN
Jews can't be firemen.
KYLE
Shut up, fat ass!
CARTMAN
Don't call me fat, you stupid Jew!
KENNY
(How about we put a real fire out?)
STAN
Hey, Kenny's right. We should put out a real fire. Then we'll be heroes!
CARTMAN
But how do we start a fire?
KYLE
Trent Boyett will do it. He's the toughest, baddest kid in preschool! [a shot of Trent beating up another kid with a play hammer. He delivers two blows]
TRENT
Say Uncle!
BOY
Uncle!
TRENT
[two more blows] Say Uncle!!!!!!
BOY
Uncle! [satisfied, Trent lets the boy go, and Stan and the others advance to him]
TRENT
[turns around] What do you shitheads want?!
KYLE
Do you know how to start a fire?
TRENT
Sure! I burn lots stuff.
STAN
Start one. Then we're gonna put it out.
KYLE
We're firemen!
TRENT
Do you dickheads even know how to put out a fire?
STAN
Yeah, yeah. We play Fireman all the time.
CARTMAN
Don't worry, Trent.
TRENT
All right, fine. [walks back to the table, grabs a sheet of paper, crumples it up, and lays it down on the floor. He sets it on fire]
BUTTERS
[approaches] Hey fellas, you'd better be careful.
CARTMAN
Shut up, Butters! We know what we're doing!
BUTTERS
Oh, all right then. [turns around and walks off. The sheet catches fire]
STAN
Wow, cool!
KYLE
Code 7! Bring in the firemen!
STAN
[walks up to the crumples sheet] Woo, woo, woo, woo. Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang! [drops his pants and begins pissing on the paper] Come on, firemen! Put out the fire! [the other boys come and imitate the fire truck noises while pissing on the paper. Trent looks on.]
STAN
We're heroes!
KYLE
[smiles] We saved the school!
TRENT
[sees that the fire is spreading] Put it out!
MS. CLARIDGE
[a female, notices the fire and arrives] Trent Boyett, what have you done now?!
TRENT
They said they could put it out!
MS. CLARIDGE
Children, get back away, now! [shoos the boys away, then tries to smother the fire out with a blanket. The blanket catches fire, and so does she.] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!! [runs from the blanket, then twirls in her own flames as the alarm goes off] I'M BUUURNIIIING!!!
STAN
Put it out, put it out! [Cartman runs up to their teacher and starts pissing on her. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny follow suit]
[South Park Elementary, moments later, still in the flashback. The teacher is being put in an ambulance.]
PARAMEDIC
Come on, hurry! We've gotta get her to the hospital! [the paramedics hop into the ambulance and drive off, siren blaring]
STAN
Dude, we are in so much trouble!
KYLE
My mom is gonna break my legs!
CARTMAN
Hey, we didn't start the fire, Trent Boyett did.
STAN
That's true.
OFFICER
You boys! Trent is trying to tell us the fire was your idea.
STAN
No!
KYLE
Not us. We're good kids.
TRENT
Tell them it was an accident: you thought you could put it out.
CARTMAN
Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
OFFICER
I thought so. All right, that's it, Trent. You're going to Juvenile Hall for a long time!
TRENT
[pleading as he passes Butters] Butters, you saw! Tell them what happened!
BUTTERS
U-Ah, gee-whiz, Trent. Ah, I don't wanna get involved. Or else my parents will ground me.
TRENT
You'd better pray I never get out of Juvenile Hall! You'd better all pray! [the officer wrestles him into the patrol car and closes the door]
KYLE
Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall, he's gonna wanna kill us!
CARTMAN
Whatever. That's like five years from now.
STAN
Yeah, who cares?
THE BOYS
[cheering] All right, yeah, woohoo, we did it!
[The flashback ends and the boys are shown in the hall again.]
STAN
Now it's five years later. And Trent Boyett is being released.
CARTMAN
Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've gotta tell our parents!
KYLE
We can't tell our parents, dude! We lied to everybody! Nobody knows we're responsible for Ms. Claridge's accident!
STAN
Shhh, here comes Ms. Claridge now. [a soft noise is heard, and in rolls a futuristic wheelchair, encasing Ms. Claridge]
THE BOYS
Hello, Ms. Claridge. [she turns to face them]
STAN
[nervously] Are you having a nice day, Ms. Claridge? [a yellow button on the machine lights up and beeps. She turns left and rolls away]
CARTMAN
You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He's gonna tear us apart!
KYLE
Look, that was a long time ago. Maybe Trent Boyett has forgotten all about it.
[Juvenile Hall, outside, day, out in the desert. The sky looks smoggy.]
[Juvenile Hall, inside. The gates in the hall roll back and a mean Trent walks forward. On his right shoulder is written "Vengeance is Mine, sayeth the Lord." Above the writing is a cross. On his left shoulder is a skull surrounded by the words "Never Forget." He approaches the check-out desk.]
WARDEN
[holds up a manila envelope] Everything that you had when you were first brought in here will now be returned. [slices the envelope open and the goods pour out. He then gives each good to Trent after mentioning it] One Crayola eight-pack with crayon sharpener. One pair of plastic round-tipped scissors. One marble, blue. And one [snaps the blade open] switch-blade knife with "Kill all betrayers" written on the blade, black. [snaps the blade closed again and hands it to Trent. Trent makes his way past the desk and heads for the exit.] Trent! Where are you gonna do? [Trent stops]
TRENT
I gots some business to take care of. [leaves]
[Butters' house, day. In his darkened room, Butters trembles in fear on the floor next to his bookcase. A knock is heard at his door.]
BUTTERS
Hah! [the door opens and his parents enter.]
STEPHEN
Butters? [a view of the room from their position doesn't show Butters anywhere. Butters peeks out from behind the bookcase]
BUTTERS
Hwell. Oh, uh, hi Dad.
STEPHEN
Butters, what is wrong with you??
BUTTERS
Nothins' wrong, sir. Eh, nothin' at all.
LINDA
You've been shut up in your room for days, Butters. You need to go outside, go play.
BUTTERS
Uh... outside? No way! [hides again]
LINDA
Why not?
BUTTERS
[pops up] N-no reason! [hides again]
STEPHEN
Butters, we have had it with your moping around! You're gonna go outside and you're gonna play, right now!
BUTTERS
But Dad, I just wanna stay in my room-
[Butters' house, front porch. He's kicked out of the house and the door shuts closed on him. He fiddles his fingers around nervously.]
STEPHEN
Butters, play! [Butters is frozen by something he sees across the street] Start playing right now, young man! [Butters begins to move around, and his father leaves the window. Butters does the Hokey Pokey, but notices the street again and freezes. Across the street, Trent looks right at him]
BUTTERS
Tru... Tr-Trent Boyett! Haaaa! [grabs the door handle and tries to go inside again, only to find it locked. He pounds on the door] Dad! Mom! I'm don- I'm done playin' now! [Trent marches across the street and approaches Butters.] Aaaaah! Let me in, Dad! [Butters pounds on the door again] Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door! [Inside, on the sofa, Chris reads the newspaper, Linda reads a book]
LINDA
What on earth is the matter with him?
STEPHEN
Just keep the door locked, honey. Butters can't be a house hermit his whole life.
BUTTERS
Oh my God, he's coming! Oh hamburgers he's gonna kill me!
LINDA
I just can't stand to hear him scream like that. I'm gonna go upstairs. [rises from the sofa and heads upstairs]
BUTTERS
Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door right now! You've gotta open it- [stops and turns around. He's face to face with Trent. Butters begins talking nervously] Oh, hey! Trent Boyett Gosh I... haven't seen you in a while.
TRENT
[beat] Five years. It's been five long, miserable years.
BUTTERS
Look, Trent, I know- I know you're awful sore about... pre- muh- pr-preschool and all, but... well that was a long time ago. I mean, we were just kids. [Trent is unmoved] Uhhh... p-lease don't hurt me, Trent. I-I'll give you anything you want. You name it!
TRENT
Can you give me back my time?! Huh?! Can you do that?! Kindergarten, first grade, second?! Can you give me that?!
BUTTERS
Well, no, Trent, I-I'm not like a time-traveler or nothin'.
TRENT
I'm gonna give you something you didn't give me: a five-second head-start.
BUTTERS
No, Trent, I-I ain't gonna run. We can talk this through.
TRENT
Four seconds!
BUTTERS
Uh, Trent, now, listen to me. I'm sorry for the color-
TRENT
Three seconds!
BUTTERS
Ohhh hamburgers! [runs away]
[Hell's Pass hospital, day. Butters wasn't fast enough. In a recovery room, his parents stand at his bedside.]
LINDA
Thanks so much for coming to visit Butters in the hospital, boys. It means a lot to him. [the boys just stand there with their jaws dropped, awed at what they see before them. Dr. Doctor comes in with a clipboard]
STEPHEN
What happened to him, Doctor?
DR. DOCTOR
From the test results, it would appear your child was tortured by a bully. He received a massive snuggie, his underwear pulled up so high it nearly killed him. He also received two Indian sunburns on his forearms, a charlie horse on the thigh, and a second-degree titty twister. And from the damage to his head area, it appears he was also given a swirly, a colossal one. [the boys are more frightened after hearing this] It also looks like he received a noogie, and, a Polish bike ride.
LINDA
What's that?
DR. DOCTOR
We aren't sure. We only know that... there is no cure.
LINDA
If only we had let him in! [faces Stephen] Why didn't we let him inside the house when he was screaming for help?? [begins to sob]
STEPHEN
Now, honey, we were trying to read. [the boys walk over to an adjacent room]
CARTMAN
We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters!
KYLE
That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years!
CARTMAN
Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!
STAN
Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection.
CARTMAN
[now yelling] How the hell are condoms gonna help us?! [the adults in the recovery room look at Cartman] Sorry, heh. Never mind, hehe. [the adults turn their attention back to Butters]
STAN
I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger than Trent to protect us from him. Come on! [the boys run off]
[A riverbed. There's graffiti along the banks and sixth graders ride their bikes all around the riverbed.]
SIXTH GRADER 1
I'm gonna jump the wall of fire. [makes motorcycle noises and jumps a low ramp and a small fire, landing safely] Yeah, that was sweet!
SIXTH GRADE LEADER
Hey, look! [before him, Stan and friend approach]
KYLE
Dude, we shouldn't be here!
STAN
Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth graders.
SIXTH GRADE LEADER
Stupid little Fourthies! [leads the other sixth-grade boys towards the fourth-graders and circles them, then stops in front of them] What are you little Fourthies doin' in our hangout?!
STAN
We've come to... ask you for help.
SIXTH GRADE LEADER
Help?! [he and the other sixth graders laugh heartily]
KYLE
We need you to protect us... from a bully.
SIXTH GRADE LEADER
Yeah? And what do we get for it? [Stan nudges Cartman forward]
CARTMAN
[pulls each item from his backpack and presents it as he mentions it] A twelve-pack of Dr. Pepper, A Shoots & Ladders game used only three times, DVD of Harry Potter 2, and a coupon for a free side of fries with a purchase of any deluxe hamburger at Red Robin. [places it at the top of the small tower he's built] All this can be yours. [the Sixth Grade Leader steps off his bike, approaches Cartman, and throws the tower aside]
SIXTH GRADE LEADER
You're gonna have to do better than that, Fourthies!
KYLE
Well... [the fourth-graders take a step back] Well, what do you want?
SIXTH GRADE LEADER
You're Stan Marsh, right?
STAN
Yeah.
SIXTH GRADERS
OOOOOoooOoOooo! [Stan develops a worried face]
SIXTH GRADE LEADER
We want a picture of your mom's boobs! [cups his hands over his chest]
SIXTH GRADERS
Yeah. Awesome.
STAN
What?!
SIXTH GRADER 2
Your mom has the sweetest bewbs ever.
SIXTH GRADER 3
Yeah! I totally wanna suck your mom's tits.
STAN
Dude, weak!
SIXTH GRADE LEADER
Come back with a naked picture of your mom!
STAN
[after some thought] No!
SIXTH GRADE LEADER
Then we aren't helpin' you!
KYLE
Wait! We'll do it.
SIXTH GRADE LEADER
It'd have to be a good picture, too! [the sixth-graders make motorcycle noises and ride off. This sixth grader does a wheelie] So long, Fourthies!
CARTMAN
Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool.
[Trent makes makeshift barbells out of rods and solid disks and begins pumping iron.]
[South Park, Main Street. A couple and Ms. Claridge pass each other.]
WOMAN 1
That's the preschool teacher, Ms. Claridge. Poor woman suffered such horrible burns she can only communicate by... beeping once for yes and twice for no. [Ms. Claridge stops at a corner waiting to cross the street. Another couple approaches her and flanks her on either side]
WOMAN 2
Oh hello, Ms. Claridge. Nice day, isn't it? [Ms. Claridge's machine blinks once, so yes]
MAN 2
Need help across the street, Ms. Claridge? [Ms. Claridge's machine blinks two, so no] Well all right then. [the light turns green and the couple crosses the street. Ms. Claridge does as well, but it's slow going for her. Her wheelchair slows down and her power indicator drops to zero. She stuck in the middle of the street in the crosswalk]
MAN 3
[walks over to help her] Ms. Claridge, you all right? [silence, as there's no power for her light to blink] You can talk to me, Ms. Claridge. I understand: one beep for yes and two for no. Don't you think you should get out of the street? [again, no response] Look you, you don't have to be so cold. I'm just trying to help. [no response. The man gets annoyed] Oooo, sorry! [the man walks on to the other side of the street, quite annoyed at Ms. Claridge. Cross traffic begins, and the cars beep at Ms. Claridge to move out of the way. She's stuck]
[A doorbell rings. Mrs. Broflovski approaches and opens the door. Trent faces her with his knife in hand.]
TRENT
Can Kyle come out and play?
SHEILA
Oh, Kyle isn't home right now, hon.
TRENT
Thank you, ma'am. [turns and walks away]
[Stan's house. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny sit at the dining table. Cartman is dressed as a woman.]
STAN
You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class.
CARTMAN
I don't know, son. That sounds awfully strange. [crosses his arms] You cannot have a picture of my hot breasts.
STAN
But mom, my teacher will-
CARTMAN
Nononono, you gotta go [softly, sweetly] "But Mo-o-o-om."
STAN
[normal] But Mo-o-o-
CARTMAN
[with more feeling] "But Mo-o-o-om."
STAN
This is hopeless!
KYLE
Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes?
STAN
That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a picture of my mom's boobs!
KENNY
[volunteers] (I'll do it!)
STAN
No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that looks like boobs to take a picture of.
KYLE
What else has big round squishy globes? [they look at Cartman, who looks up into space]
[Living room, moments later. Cartman stands on a stool and squats down. Kyle has a set of instructions and Stan has a marker. Kenny stands as a witness.]
CARTMAN
Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my ass cheeks.
KYLE
[checks the book] No, the nipples are more in the middle, see? [holds the book out for the others to see.]
CARTMAN
Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the bottom now.
STAN
How do you know?!
CARTMAN
Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff!
STAN
All right, fine. [draws some nipples on Cartman's ass, checking the book to be sure. He then steps back]
KYLE
Oh wait! We forgot the necklace.
KENNY
(Oh yeah!) [walks up and puts a necklace above the new nipples, then steps back. Stan frames the image with his hands, then has Kyle step into his spot to take a couple of pictures.]
KYLE
[lowers the camera] God, I hope this works.
[The ravine, day. The sixth graders are there again, riding up and down the concrete slopes. Stan and his friends approach.]
STAN
Excuse me!
SIXTH GRADE LEADER
What do you want now?!
STAN
[steps forward] We, we got it. [pulls out the photo. The sixth graders ride up to the boys]
SIXTH GRADER 4
You got a picture of your mom's bewbs?
SIXTH GRADER 5
No way!
SIXTH GRADER 2
[walks up and takes the photo, then walks back to the group, looking at it] Hey, hold on a second! [the boys are scared] These are like the hottest tits I've ever seen!
SIXTH GRADER 8
Whoa!
SIXTH GRADER 4
Check them out!
SIXTH GRADE LEADER
[walks up and grabs is from #6] Give me that! [looks] Whoa! I knew she had a hot rack!
SIXTH GRADERS
Yeah. Sure does. Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
SIXTH GRADER 3
Oh yeah, those are so hot. [fondles his groin] Oooohhh
KYLE
[the boys look at each other] Okay, so now you'll help us take care of Trent Boyett?
SIXTH GRADE LEADER
[someone else has the picture now] Oh all right, we'll let this Trent Boyett know that if he messes with you, he's messin' with us!
CARTMAN
All right!
KENNY
(Woohoo!)
CARTMAN
You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world!
KENNY
(All right!)
SIXTH GRADER 9
I need three minutes alone with the picture behind the bushes.
SIXTH GRADER 2
I get to take the picture behind the bushes after you.
SIXTH GRADE LEADER
[grabs the picture] I'm takin' it to the bushes first! [the others follow]
STAN
Dude, are we gonna be like that someday?
KYLE
[after some thought] Naw.
[The intersection. Ms. Claridge is still there. The boys exit an ice cream parlor with ice cream cones and walk down the street.]
KYLE
Man, I would have loved to seen to seen the look on Trent Boyett's face when all the sixth graders showed up!
CARTMAN
Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess with us. I woulda kicked his ass.
STAN
Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing? [she's still in the crosswalk] Ms. Claridge?
MAN 4
[stops and walks up to the boys] She won't talk to anybody, boys. Some say... she's just given up hope. [walks on. The boys move on as well and round a corner]
CARTMAN
Hey guys, you know what we should do? We should go get a- [drops his cone in fright] Huh?! [before them is a pile of mangled bikes]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, later. The boys enter the emergency room and see it full of cots. The sixth graders are there, some injured more than others. The emergency room personnel have their hands full.]
DR. DOCTOR
Jesus Christ, I've never seen so many Indian sunburns and titty twisters in my life! [sees a nurse and motions to her] Get a cold towel on that pink belly!
NURSE 1
Doctor, we have another snuggie here!
DR. DOCTOR
Over there! [points to a clear area, then goes to another cot on which a sixth grader grabs his left ear in pain. A nurse is there as well] Another wet willie?
NURSE 2
Worst one yet.
SIXTH GRADER
It's all slimy and spitty! [becomes incomprehensible and cries out in pain]
DR. DOCTOR
Give the poor kid some morphine. [the nurse reaches for a syringe and does as told. The boys approach the cot on which the leader of the sixth graders lies]
STAN
Dude, what happened?
SIXTH GRADE LEADER
We... told him not to mess with you guys... We told him... you paid us.
KYLE
Oh, Jesus. You told him that?! [the leader suffers a cramp and groans]
DR. DOCTOR
Boys, you have to let him rest. Some mean kid gave him a Texas Chili Bowl.
STAN
What's that?
DR. DOCTOR
It involves Tabasco sauce, a telephone, and the anus. [the boys are flabbergasted] I don't know what kind of kid would do this to other people; I only know that I wouldn't ever want to be on that kid's bad side. [walks away. The boys leave the hospital]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, outside.]
STAN
We're dead. Trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him.
CARTMAN
He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls. [breathes a silent sigh]
KYLE
We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible!
STAN
No, no, we've just gotta find better help.
KYLE
From who? We can't ask adults for help and there's nobody tougher than sixth graders.
STAN
[looks down] There is... one person.
[Stan's house, living room. Shelly is watching TV with a bowl of soup on her lap. Stan and friends enter and approach.]
STAN
Shelly?
SHELLY
Shut up, turd! I'm watching television!
STAN
Shelly, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other.
SHELLY
I said shut up, or I will destroy you, tur-r-rd!
STAN
Shelly [hesitates, begins to tear up] Somebody is going to kill me, and I can't go to Mom or Dad for help, so, you're kind of the only person I have... left. [begins to cry. Shelly notices, puts her bowl aside, hops off the sofa, and walks up to Stan]
SHELLY
[in Stan's face] Stop crying, turd! Now, who's gonna kill you?
STAN
Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault.
SHELLY
Oh, you are such stupid turds.
STAN
We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us!
SHELLY
Calm down, turd! No Juvenile Hall turd is going to kill you. That's my job.
KYLE
So you're gonna help us?
SHELLY
Yes, but I'm gonna want something in return.
CARTMAN
A picture of your mom's boobs?
SHELLY
Shut up, turd! [all four of the boys stand back in fear] You're going to admit to Ms. Claridge what you did!
STAN
Admit it was our fault?
SHELLY
You can't run from your past, turds. Apologize and make amends. Then I'll protect you from this Trent turd. [the boys aren't so sure apologizing will do any good]
[The intersection. Ms. Claridge is still there. No one has moved her. Cars move past her, honking at her, and two men and a woman approach the corner facing her.]
MAN 5
Ms. Claridge, the people in town are really worried about you. [no reply]
WOMAN 3
Look, if you're having some kind of problem, you have to be able to talk to people. [no reply]
MAN 6
Just tell us this: do you trust that we want what's best for you, yes or no? [no reply]
MAN 5
All right, fine! But someday you're gonna have to learn to let people in! [the three walk away] Bitch. [Stan and his friends approach the corner and walk up to Ms. Claridge.]
STAN
Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-something to tell you. [no reply]
KYLE
The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids.
CARTMAN
A lot of stupid things that we regret.
KENNY
(And it's time for us to come clean.) [no reply]
STAN
See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little, we used to play with our wieners a lot, and one game we played was "Fireman."
TRENT
[appearing behind them] I've been lookin' for you! [the boys turn and jump upon seeing him. Kenny tightens his hood.] Five years I've been waitin' for this day.
CARTMAN
Aaaaaaaah!
STAN
Trent, look, we've realized our mistake! [Trent advances, the boys back up]
CARTMAN
Yes, our conscience got the best of us and, and we were just about to tell everyone the truth. [the boys hide behind Ms. Claridge's wheelchair, Trent goes around the other side and faces them behind the chair]
TRENT
You had five years to do that. And while I wasted away my time in prison you've been enjoying nice, normal lives!
KYLE
Our lives have not been enjoyable, Trent! I promise you! [the boys back up some more, away from the intersection]
TRENT
Don't tell me that! I heard about the things you've done! But there were no magical Christmas adventures or talking poo for me! I DIDN'T GET TO FIGHT A HUGE MECHANIC BARBRA STREISAND!! NO ACCIDENTAL TRIPS TO AFGANISTAN FOR TRENT BOYETT!! [advances. Cartman pulls out a taser gun as the other boys fall in behind him]
CARTMAN
Stay away from us, Trent!
STAN
What is that?
CARTMAN
It's my mom's taser. I took it from her purse. [steps forward] Just back off, man!
TRENT
Look, just take your punishment! You deserve it! Let me have my retribution and it can be over with.
CARTMAN
I am not going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters!
TRENT
You don't even know how to use that! [advances on Cartman, who fires the taser but misses.]
[The taser tips hit Ms. Claridge's wheelchair and begin charging her battery up. Excess power causes the wheelchair to spin twice around and go off to the corner she was facing. She hits Little Gas Shack and blows up three propane tanks just outside the store. Those tanks in turn blow up the store. Ms. Claridge catches fire and spins around a few more times. Her button blinks twice for no and she crosses back across the street, crashing into a Pets-U-Luv store. A bunch of cats attack her and she pulls back out of the store. She spins again a few more times and a policeman pulls up in his cruiser. Ms. Claridge rolls down the street and shears off a fire hydrant. She gets stuck atop the pipe and water shoots up and engulfs her. Moments later the ambulance pulls up and the paramedics prepare to put Ms. Claridge into the cargo area of the vehicle.]
OFFICER 2
So, Trent, you just had to finish off your old preschool teacher, eh?
TRENT
No! They did it! [silence for a few seconds]
CARTMAN
Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
OFFICER 2
Ms. Claridge, did Trent Boyett do this to you? [two beeps, so no] Yes, yes. Take him away!
TRENT
[a blond officer arrests him] No! You've gotta listen to me! [nope. He's hauled away and the gathered crowd disperses]
KYLE
Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be really mad!
CARTMAN
Whatever, that's like five years from now.
STAN
Yeah, who cares?
THE BOYS
Yeah, woohoo!
CARTMAN
We did it! [walks over to the side of the cruiser Trent is sitting in] So long, Trent! Have a nice time! [Trent grits his teeth in anger as Cartman dances] Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! [turns around and lowers his pants, then shakes his bare at him] Hahahahahaaahaaa! [he forgot to remove the nipple markings from it. Trent grows livid. The six-graders arrive and notice Cartman's buttcheeks.]
SIXTH GRADER 2
Hey, hold on a second!
CARTMAN
Uh oh.
SIXTH GRADER 2
Bewbs!
SIXTH GRADER 1
Omigod!
SIXTH GRADERS
Boobs!
SIXTH GRADER 1
[as the others argue over them and carry Cartman away] I'm taking them to the bushes!
SIXTH GRADER 2
I'm taking them to the bushes first!
CARTMAN
Hah! Hey!
End of Pre-School

synopsis:The boys of South Park produce their own morning news show on the school's closed-circuit television station and are immediately caught up in an intense competition for ratings.

script:Quest for Ratings

[An announcer introduces the news over some action-type music.]
ANNOUNCER
This is closed-circuit television for South Park Elementary School. And now, Super School News. The news made for students, by students.
JIMMY
Welcome to S-super School News. I'm Jimmy Valmer.
CARTMAN
And I'm Rick Cartman.
JIMMY
The price of milk money will go up next Monday to 49 cents. The school claims the added money is due to the cow shortage in South Park County.
CARTMAN
Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.
[Reporting from the cafeteria, Stan.]
STAN
Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. Eric?
CARTMAN
[serious pose] ...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities?
[Reporting from the sidewalk in front of the school, Butters.]
BUTTERS
Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now and ah, and I haven't seen any celebrities. Uh, about thirty minutes ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, but ih-ih-turn- it turns out it was a dead horse.
CARTMAN
All right, Butters, keep your eyes open.
BUTTERS
[over a speaker] Will do.
JIMMY
More snow for South P... P-P-Park. Here's Tolkien Black with the weather.
TOLKIEN
[in front of a weather map] Jimmy and Eric, it looks like a massive snow storm is headed South Park's way. I asked my dad last night and he said that he heard the snow storm is expected on Tuesday. Guys?
CARTMAN
Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right.
KYLE
[at a small desk, for Sports] Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They were ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson started crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit.
CARTMAN
Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip.
JIMMY
And that's all for Super School News. Enjoy your day at South Park Eh-Eh-Eh-Eh- [lilts] Ehehehehe [normal] El-Elementary.
STAN
[returning from the kitchen to serve as cameraman] And we're... cut! [turns off the camera]
CARTMAN
All right, nice reporting, guys. Nice. [the reporters gather in studio]
BUTTERS
Boy, that was a great episode!
STAN
Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet.
MR. MERYL
[enters the studio] Boys, I'm afraid I have some bad news. The school has to cancel your show.
KYLE
What?!
JIMMY
For God's sake,why Mr. M-M-Meryl?!
MR. MERYL
Well, the students just aren't watching ya. Your rating was only a four this whole week.
CARTMAN
How many students is that?
MR. MERYL
Four. [holds up four fingers] Four students watch your show. And meanwhile, Craig's show is getting a 57!
STAN
...Craig's show??
CARTMAN
What is that butthole doing now?!
MR. MERYL
Oh, it's brilliant! It's all just video footage of animals close-up with a wide angle lens. [pops a VHS tape into the player and the video starts]
CRAIG
[on tape, as the name of the show is displayed] Animals Close-Up With A Wide Angle Lens. [the video goes on to show close-ups of dogs and cats.]
STAN
But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV!
MR. MERYL
It's what the students want, and it's cheaper to make than your show. Just one person and a video camera. Craig is a genius. Uh-sorry, kids. [walks between and past them]
JIMMY
[stopping Mr. Meryl] But, Mr. Meryl, we're trying to bring the news to the students. They need to know the facts, and our news team delivers them, very much.
MR. MERYL
Kids don't care about the news, boys. It's boring. Kids wanna see animals, close-up, with a wide angle lens!
CARTMAN
Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Without it, we have nothing.
MR. MERYL
I'm sorry, kids. Y-y-you should be proud of what you've done. It's just that it's kind of gay. [walks off]
CARTMAN
...You're gay!
[Whistlin' Willy's Pizza Gulch, day. The boys are seated for lunch: Jimmy, Butters, Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Tolkien. Other kids are there as well.]
BUTTERS
[his head resting on his right hand] Gee whiz. We sure worked hard on that new show.
STAN
Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work.
WHISTLIN' WILLY
[approaches the table] Hello boys, ready to do some whistlin'? [begins to whistle]
CARTMAN
Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood.
WHISTLIN' WILLY
[enthusiastically] If you want a pizza, you've gotta whistle. [whistles] Come on! [whistles some more, then stops. The boys whistle back, but slowly and flatly] There you go! [sets the pizza down on the table and leaves]
CARTMAN
[softly] God, I wish we had a Pizza Hut in South Park.
STAN
[look at Cartman, but notices someone else] Hey, look, Craig just walked in. [Craig enters to cheers from the other kids in the restaurant and waves back to them. Several kids take pictures of Craig]
BRADLEY
Yeah!
KID 1
Hey look, it's Craig!
KEVIN
Hey, Craig, over here!
KYLE
Geez, all that from a stupid video show.
CRAIG
[sees the other boys and addresses them] Oh hey guys. Heard about your news show being cancelled.
CARTMAN
Go play with yourself, Craig.
CRAIG
Yeah, well, I've got an overall deal with the school, heh. They're paying me six dollars a week to come up with new shows.
STAN
Your idea took about this much thought, Craig! [holds up a fist with thumb and index finger just a centimeter apart]
CRAIG
[throws the gesture back at Stan] This much more than you had!
[Craig walks off with his fans. They head to Willy's VIP Lounge, which is just a large corner booth. A waiter guards access to the lounge and Craig approaches.]
CRAIG
Hey, a round of root beers for everyone! On me! [the other kids cheer and the waiter opens the lounge. The kids pour into place, including Kenny.]
KENNY
(Woohoo!)
CARTMAN
[catches up to Kenny] Kenny, what the hell are you doing with this asshole?!
KENNY
(Craig just asked me to do his show, geez.)
CARTMAN
You're helping Craig make his show?! I can't believe you would betray us like that! We've always been supercool to you! [Kenny flashes back to Cartman gloating about their news show]
 "Hahahahahaaahaaa! We're gonna do a news show, and you can't do it with us, because you are too poo-oor, and poor people don't watch the new-oos! Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!" [Kenny gets annoyed]
[The flashback ends, which the upset Kenny crosses his arms] ...Ah whatever, Kenny! [walks away]
CRAIG
Hey gang, I brought the new episode of wide angle, close-up animals. [the kids cheer again. Clyde walks up and takes the tape from Craig]
CLYDE
[excitedly runs towards the video wall] Put it, put it up on the, monitors! [puts the tape into the player and more close-up footage of animals is shown]
KIDS
Cuuute. [a kitten's face is shown] Super cuuute.
KYLE
[turns back to the table] Gah, I just don't get it.
TOLKIEN
Wow, those animals are pretty cute.
STAN
Token! Now, come on, guys! We worked too hard to just roll over for Craig and his stupid overall deal. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves, we just need to figure out how to make our show better!
KYLE
Yeah. Maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week, they'll let us stay on the air!
BUTTERS
Well, what are we waitin' for?!
STAN
Come on, guys! [the boys leave]
[Student Conference Room 1-F, later. Inside, A sign above the chalkboard reads "Idea Room." Cartman has his feet up on the table. Stan paces the floor.]
STAN
All right, we all need to come up with ideas for our show.
KYLE
How about we revamp the name? Super School News sounds dry.
CARTMAN
It should be Sexy News.
TOLKIEN
Action News!
STAN
Yeah, Sexy Action, that's good.
KYLE
Maybe the problem is we don't have very good stories to report on.
CARTMAN
Right. We should make up stories, because they'll be far more interesting.
BUTTERS
Hey, yeah. Uh why I could say I saw celebrities even though I didn't, a-a-and then lie about what I saw them doing.
CARTMAN
Nice, Butters, write that down!
BUTTERS
[enunciates each word as he writes it] Lie about celebrities.
STAN
We have to appeal to all the students, so we, we need hot girls for the sixth graders...
CARTMAN
And panda bears for the preschoolers.
STAN
Good!
KYLE
Maybe we need to make students think they have to watch our news show or they'll die.
TOLKIEN
Yeah! We should make up a bunch of reports about how dangerous it is to be alive.
BUTTERS
Oh, boy!
JIMMY
Fellas, are you sure all of this is eh-ethical?
CARTMAN
We're in fourth grade, Jimmy. We don't even know what ethical means.
STAN
All right, Sexy Action School News Team, it's time to go to work. Get out there and get some stories!
BUTTERS
Sexy Action School News Team, ho! [the boys leave their seats and head out the doors. Cartman stops Tolkien]
CARTMAN
Ah, Tolkien, can I have a quick word with you? [takes Tolkien by the arm and walks him away from the door] Look, Tolkien, I-I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Tolkien, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona.
TOLKIEN
Huh?
CARTMAN
You see Tolkien, people really enjoy seeing African-Americans on the news... Seeing African-Americans on the news, not hearing them. That's why all African-Americans newspeople learn to talk more... wha-, how should I say... white. [Sees that Tolkien isn't following] Tolkien, all the great African-Americans news people have learned to hide their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure Caucasian dialect. There's no shame in it, and I think it'll really help our ratings.
ANNOUNCER
This is South Park Elementary School closed-circuit television. And now, [dramatic fanfare] Time with the Sexy Action School News! [a splashy logo appears with a small explosion behind the logo, then a female silhouette walking across the screen behind the words]
CARTMAN
Is South Park about to explode from a methane gas leak? More on that later. But first, Stan Marsh has a look at some new outfits for the Raisins girls!
[Reporting from Raisins, Stan Marsh. He's surrounded by Raisins with shorter shorts and tank tops.]
RAISINS GIRLS
Woohoo!
STAN
Eric, the outfits are even skimpier than before, leaving very little to the imagination. No doubt that if I were a little older, I would be aroused.
RAISINS GIRLS
Woowhoowoo!
CARTMAN
And now, for a look at the weather, here is Tolkien Black, and Tolkien, I hope there's no tornadoes headed our way.
TOLKIEN
[deeper, whiter voice] No tornadoes, Eric, but interestingly enough, there is a low-pressure storm moving in over the Park County Valley. Should bring us some chilly days ahead. [grins and points his index fingers at the camera]
JIMMY
The Park County School Board has approved a bigger budget for the computer lab up-
CARTMAN
[rudely interrupting] Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the dish on some students' bathroom habits. Kyle?
KYLE
[at a different, flashier desk] Eric, sources are speculating that third-grade student, Pete Thelman [his picture is shown], pees sitting down like a girl. We've also got confirmation that Sally Turner [her picture is shown] stuffs her bra. And Clyde Donovan has only one testicle.
CARTMAN
[cracks up with laughter, then holds up a finger] One testicle! [pounds the desk and laughs] What an asshole! [a short jingle is heard]
TOLKIEN
Uh-oh, looks like it's Panda Bear Madness Minute! [circus music plays as panda-suited mascots and the other reporters join Tolkien in the weather area and dance. A pulsating logo appears]
CARTMAN
Oh yeah, Panda Bear Madness! And now, let's get a look at the celebrity watch, with Butters.
JIMMY
[dismayed] This isn't the news, this is a tr-tr-tr-tr-travesty.
[Student Conference Room 1-F.]
CARTMAN
All right, so after my report on the unsanitary conditions of the school cafeteria, we're go to Kyle for the story on Brian Teeves trying to make out with Susan Farkle.
STAN
Then, let's do Tolkien's report on how global warming is going to kill everyone in the fifth grade.
TOLKIEN
That is a terrific idea, Stan, A-Okay.
JIMMY
[walks into the room with a tape] Fellas! Fellas, I got fant-tastic news! The vice-President, Dick Cheney, was in Denver yesterday, and I got an interview with him for our news show. [the boys look at Cartman]
CARTMAN
Oooo, interview with the vice-President, hmmm. Frankly, Jimmy, I don't know how we're gonna fit that in between cheerleader pie-eating and Who's got skidmarks Monday.
JIMMY
But this is real news!
CARTMAN
It's boring news, Jimmy.
JIMMY
How do you know?! You you haven't s-seen it yet!
CARTMAN
All right, tell me about it.
JIMMY
Well, in the interview, Mr. Cheney tells me all about how the-
CARTMAN
[yawns loudly] Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy. I'm sorry, what were we talking about?
JIMMY
Look, fellas, I've got a real problem with the direction our news show is going! We're dumbing down the school!
STAN
No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb. We're just giving them what they want.
KYLE
We're making the news more appealing to students.
JIMMY
This isn't the news! This a b-b-bastardized quest for ratings! Damnit, we have a journalistic responsibility to bring students the fa... the facts! [begins to walk around the table] Don't you see what we've done? In our efforts to compete with Craig's small-minded show, we've made a mockery of n-news reporting. I remember when we all made an oath to each other, way back when started playing news reporter, that we would never let anything jeopardize our integrity! Well our integrity is jeopardized! And if we can't report news the honest way, what good is n-news reporting? [Cartman then yawns loudly again]
[Mr. Meryl's office, Audio-Visual Department.]
MR. MERYL
Boys, first of all, I want to tell you how impressed I am with your ability to get more ratings. Your show beat Close-up Animals with a Wide Angle Lens by three viewers!
THE BOYS
All right! Woohoo! Awesome! [the boys give each other hugs all around and shake hands]
STAN
I knew we could do it!
KYLE
We beat Close-up Animals!
CARTMAN
Oh man, this is so great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere you! [hugs Butters]
MR. MERYL
Yes, but unfortunately, you got crushed in the ratings by Craig's new show. [the boys continue cheering, then stop and look at Mr. Meryl]
STAN
Craig's new show?
MR. MERYL
All the students love it. It's an incredible idea called Close-up Animals With a Wide Angle Lens... Wearing Hats. Take a look. [clicks Play. The boys turn around to look at the monitor. The animals on display now are wearing hats, but it's the same show as before otherwise.] That Craig is a freakin' genius, I tell ya. He's like... an idea machine.
BUTTERS
Does... Does this mean we're still gonna get cancelled?
MR. MERYL
I'm afraid it's worse than that, boys. I'm gonna have to give you all F's in Extracurricular AV Class. You have to learn now how important ratings are!
STAN
Hey wha-b-but we gave it our best.
MR. MERYL
Yes. [begins to rock in his seat] And I guess your best wasn't good enough. [shows them the door]
[In the hall. Mr. Meryl closes the door behind them.]
STAN
[stunned] I don't believe it.
CARTMAN
I can't lose this extracurricular credit. I need it to pass fourth grade!
BUTTERS
Stupid news hair! [He removes his wig and kicks it away.]
JIMMY
Fellas! Don't you see? This proves my point. We have to elevate our ideas up, not down.
KYLE
Yeah, Jimmy's right. I know we can come up with way better ideas than Craig.
STAN
Yeah. To save our show, all we need to do is come up with the best idea for an episode ever!
[Student Conference Room 1-F. The kid reporters sit around trying to think of something, anything, but all there is is silence.]
KYLE
What if we do a show where we- [stops] Uh, no.
CARTMAN
How about we have us, um... hmmm.
STAN
Come on, doesn't anybody have any show ideas?
BUTTERS
Well, how about we get panda bears and we have them dance around with us?
TOLKIEN
We did that!
JIMMY
Wow, coming up with ideas is... hard.
STAN
Look, you guys, if Craig can do it, we can do it! Come on! [time passes. Stan begins to pace the floor again] How about we do... a show... with us... ughhh.
KYLE
Uhhh. What if the-?
CARTMAN
Wait, I've got it. [the boys turn and look at him] Crab people.
STAN
Crab people?
CARTMAN
They're like half crab, half people, and they live below the ground.
STAN
[looks at Cartman, then gets annoyed] Dude, I think we can do a little better than crab people.
BUTTERS
I know! We should read the funnies! [hops off his chair and goes to a table, on which sits the Sunday Funnies] I always get good ideas from the funnies.
CARTMAN
[his face buried in his hands] Butters, only gay little dweebs read the funnies!
BUTTERS
Yeah! I read 'em all the time! Uh here's one: the uh, snail tripped over a hurdle, and the other snail says "Well that's gonna add another hour to his time." [laughs] Yeah! You guys! [gets no reaction from the other boys] Heh.
CARTMAN
How about we do a show where we kill Butters? [time marches on and the boys get sleepy, except for Butters]
BUTTERS
[still reading the funnies, giggles, then laughs] So Dagwood says "Good, guh-good thing we're playin' ...uh the back nine at your house." [laughs heartily]
STAN
We're hopelessly stuck, completely out of ideas.
CARTMAN
We have crab people. Just sayin'.
KYLE
Wait! You know what we should do? We should all take a bunch of cough medicine!
TOLKIEN
Cough medicine?
KYLE
That's what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess. They take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads.
[South Park Pharmacy, later. The boys are at the cold and flu medicine aisle.]
BUTTERS
Gee whiz, there sure is a lot of 'em.
KYLE
How do we know which one to use?
STAN
[reaches out and grabs one, then steps back] How about this one? Calminex? [reads the label] "Warning: Taking more than the recommended amount can cause severe side effects."
CARTMAN
That sounds perfect.
JIMMY
B-b-bingo!
PHARMACIST
Can I help you boys?
STAN
Uh, yeah, we need to come up with some ideas and inspiration, so we're gonna drink a bunch of cough medicine.
PHARMACIST
Whoa, boys! That's not what you need to come up with ideas.
KYLE
It's not?
PHARMACIST
No! What you want is Calminex PM. [grabs a similar bottle to the first one and hands it to Kyle] It has the dexatrimfan in it that causes hallucinations in large doses.
KYLE
Oh, okay.
PHARMACIST
Now, if it's more of a lucid, speedy kind of high you're looking for, I do also carry the Daytab Cold and Flu. Then there's the maximum-strength Cortitussin Cough and Cold, but of course, that's only if you really want to trip balls.
JIMMY
Wha-what do you think, fellas?
STAN
I guess we'll just take all of 'em.
PHARMACIST
That's the spirit! All right, boys, I'll just need your parents' permission. [the boys look at each other] Kidding! I'm just pulling your legs. Come on over to the register. [goes to the register. The boys follow and see Herbert Garrison and Mr. Slave waiting for the pharmacist]
HERBERT GARRISON
Oh, looks like somebody else is doin' a little partyin' tonight.
MR. SLAVE
Oh, Jesus Christ
BUTTERS
Woo. We aren't havin' a party.
HERBERT GARRISON
Oh yeah, sure, you're just buyin' that for your bad coughs, right? [fakes a bad cough and nudges Mr. Slave] Us too. [coughs]
MR. SLAVE
[coughs] Jesus. [coughs]
[Student Conference Room 1-F. Butters and Jimmy sit at a sofa. Jimmy has set his crutches aside and is now drinking the cough syrup.]
KYLE
[handing out a few things] All right, now everybody take a tablet and a pencil. [Stan, Tolkien, and Cartman are on the floor] and when all the ideas start coming, just write 'em down. We might not remember everything otherwise.
BUTTERS
[Jimmy hands him a bottle] Oh boy, I can't wait to be creative and smart. [chugs down the cough syrup] Eww, it's all thick and g-gooey.
CARTMAN
[taps at his notepad several times with a pencil] Huh. I don't have any ideas yet.
KYLE
Stan? [Stan's eyes have glazed over and he looks stupefied. From Stan's point of view, the whole world changes. Kyle now has a wolf head with yellow eyes.] Dude, Stan, you all right?
JIMMY
[appears as a yellow figure with multi-colored polka dots all over his body] I think maybe he's f-feeling it.
CARTMAN
[appears as a blob with echoing voice] Stan, are you getting good ideas?
BUTTERS
Whoa... [stretches out his left hand] I'm feeling kind of bowling-ballish, fellas.
[Stan begins his head trip. He sees a tunnel with yellow light, then a flash of plasma, then an animated Mandelbrot design, then a prize-winning dog on a pedestal. A bell sounds. Next, a tunnel with blue light, which ends up at a performance of some sort, a time-lapse shot of rolling clouds, another Mandelbrot animation, a running shot of a meadow, then a wide-angle view of the boys.]
CARTMAN
[with altered voice] Stan? Stan, come on. We're gonna go find a frog. [smiles, turns around and walks away]
[Stan then sees time-lapse footage of a ride through a city, then blooming flowers, then time-lapse footage of the reporters walking around the valley, then some weird graphics, then Cartman in degraded colors. Cartman and Kyle speak to him in weird altered voices.]
CARTMAN
Oh dude, I just got the best idea!
KYLE
[with modulated voice] Me too! [they quickly write their ideas down in their notepads]
[Stan then sees an imploding building, then some dancing African women, an explosion in another building, a zoom-pan shot of an African dancer. Next he sees himself and the boys on a sidewalk in downtown.]
BUTTERS
Hey! Let's run naked through the street! [Butters rips off his clothes, except for his wig and runs away happily. Kyle, Tolkien, and Cartman stand around with goofy grins on their faces doing nothing.]
[Student Conference Room 1-F, later on. Tolkien and Jimmy are in armchairs, Stan stayed on the floor, Kyle, Butters, and Cartman are on the sofa. Butters is in his underwear. All of them are groggy.]
CARTMAN
Dude, this TV show is awesome.
STAN
It's... it's the greatest show of all time.
KYLE
I could watch this for days. [They are unknowingly watching Craig's show, Close-up Animals With a Wide Angle Lens Wearing Hats]
THE BOYS
[without enthusiasm] Cuuute. Super cuuute.
[Student Conference Room 1-F, next morning. The boys are now asleep. Butters is still in his underwear with his head on Kyle's lap. Stan, sleeping on the floor, wakes up and looks around.]
STAN
You guys. You guys, wake up! [the boys are roused]
KYLE
Ah!
BUTTERS
Huh?
KYLE
Butters, get away from me!
BUTTERS
[looks down at his body] Oh J-Jesus, where are my clothes?!
STAN
We took a bunch of cough medicine to come up with ideas for our show. I didn't come up with anything.
CARTMAN
I-I did. I wrote something down. [reaches down and gets his tablet] Here it is! Uh, squiggly line, circle. [shows the drawing to the other boys]
KYLE
I wrote down... all the lyrics to the Happy Days theme song.
STAN
You guys, we watched Craig's show all night long.
TOLKIEN
[still groggy] Yeah. It was great.
STAN
No, but don't you see? We didn't think it was great before. I think I understand now. [strokes his chin] I think I know why Craig's show gets such great ratings! Half the school is high on cough medicine!
KYLE
Jesus, you may be right.
JIMMY
Fellas, this is our chance! Everyone get your hair looking as fantastic as possible. It's time for us to do the most incredible investigative news report of our journalistic lives!
ANNOUNCER
This is closed-circuit television for South Park Elementary School. And now, [sudden change of tone and flashy graphics follow] a Sexy Action News Team Special Report: Cough Medicine Abuse in School! [the boys are shown in their news reporter attire and they strike serious poses. Cartman takes off his glasses.] With the Sexy Action School News Team! [a shot of a coffin being lowered into its plot] It's the report you can't afford to miss! [a skull and crossbones appear and a scream is heard. The picture itself takes on a blue hue] And now here is Rick Cartman!
CARTMAN
[camera pans down to him] They call it cough syrup, cough medicine, cold and flu remedy. But behind closed doors at South Park Elementary it also has a street name. Coochie, wombat juice, tigger yum yum. Hello, I'm Rick Cartman. Today, the Sexy Action School News Team takes you inside the dark and lonely world... of cough medicine abuse.
STAN
[voice over] They're doing it in the hallways! [a shot of Tweek downing some cough syrup, then jumping in surprise with his iconic yelp and running away] Behind the school! [a shot of the Goth kids downing cough medicine]
PETE
Hey, get out of here, you fuckin' dork!
STAN
Even in the girls' bathroom! [a shot of Bebe and Red in the restroom viewed through an air vent. Bebe takes a sip from a bottle of cough medicine, gives it to Red to sip, then notices something in the air vent]
BEBE
[approaches the sink under the vent] Is somebody in there?! I'll tell on you!
STAN
[a shot of Jimmy and Principal Victoria looking at the report] We showed the shocking footage to the principal!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh my goodness!
JIMMY
P- Principal Victoria, can you explain how your administration fai-failed to see this p-p-pro-o-o... p-p-problem.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well I... we...
KYLE
[steps into view in front of Cartman, who has his arms crossed] So where are students getting all this cough medicine?? [Cartman uncrosses his arms and puts his fists on his hips. Kyle puts his hands behind his back] This surveillance footage shows a group of troubled kids getting all the smack they want from a pharmacist! [it's the footage from their own visit to the pharmacist for the medicine] Sexy Action School News reported the pharmacist to the South Park police, and he was immediately arrested! [a shot of the pharmacist being escorted out of the store and into a cruiser. Officer Barbrady takes part in the arrest]
TOLKIEN
The cough companies claim they don't intend for their product to be used by kids to get high! But one look at the packaging tells otherwise. [brings out the first package] Theradryl DM. For kids. [brings out the next package] Dexa Cough, children's formula.
CARTMAN
And now, for a quick celebrity check, here's Butters Stotch.
BUTTERS
[from the front of the school] Still no celebrities, Eric. Uh, I'll keep my eyes open.
STAN
The cough medicine problem used to also run rampant in neighboring Middle Park Elementary. But they took action: riddled their entire town of cough medicine, and what we see now is a happier school, 100% cough medicine-free. [a shot of the hallways from the entrance. All the kids are coughing and walking around. Some of them sneeze]
[Mr. Meryl's office, later.]
MR. MERYL
Boys, I want to congratulate you on what is perhaps the finest piece of student television I've ever seen. Not only did you get all the students and myself off of couch medicine, but you got a 22 in the ratings!
KYLE
Twenty-two people?! All right!
CRAIG
[enters and moves past the other boys] You wanted to see me, Mr. Meryl?
MR. MERYL
Oh yes, Craig. It appears that the ratings for your show are down significantly.
STAN
[knowingly] Gee, what a coincidence.
JIMMY
I wonder... oo-oo.. w-why?
MR. MERYL
You need to know how important ratings are, Craig, so, I'm going to suspend you from school and request that you have your testicles removed surgically. [Craig's jaw drops.]
CARTMAN
[gleefully] Haha! In your face, Craig!
MR. MERYL
You boys are approved for twenty-seven new shows. I want you to come up with an even better idea than the cough medicine story. Get to it!
[Student Conference Room 1-F, later on. The boys are seated at the table once again, sitting in silence.]
STAN
Nobody has any ideas?
CARTMAN
This sucks. I don't wanna keep havin' to come up with ideas for shows all the time. It hurts my head. [Tolkien and Kyle sit across from him with no ideas either]
KYLE
Dude, bail?
CARTMAN
...I think bail.
STAN
...Bail. [everyone leaves the table]
JIMMY
Yep, b-b-b-bail. [the room is empty as the door closes off-camera.]
[The last scenes are that of "Close-up Animals With a Wide Angle Lens Wearing Hats"]
End of Quest for Ratings


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Disturbed by the corruptive influence Paris Hilton has on all little girls in South Park, one of the town's favorite citizens challenges her to a "whore-off."

script:Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset

[South Park Mall, day. Inside, a crowd awaits a special event. A small stage with "PARIS" written on it in large letters is set up before a red curtain. Wendy and Bebe arrive and make their way to the front.]
BEBE
Come on, Wendy, we're gonna miss it!
WENDY
We're gonna miss what?
BEBE
Paris Hilton is making an appearance at the mall!
WENDY
Who's Paris Hilton?
RED
"Who's Paris Hilton?"
ANNIE
You don't know?
STORE OWNER
[someone takes a picture as he approaches the mic.] Hello, everyone! The Guess Clothing Company is pleased to have as its new spokesperson model, a woman all you young ones can look up to, Ms. Paris Hilton. [she appears and flashbulbs go off amid squeals from females in the crowd. She then lifts her bra and shows off her breasts]
BEBE
Wow, that's really her! Paris! Over here!
WENDY
I don't get it. What's she do?
ANNIE
She's super-rich!
WENDY
...But what does she do?
RED
She's totally spoiled and snobby.
WENDY
[annoyed] What does she do?!
MAN
[walks by and overhears] She's a whore. [takes his camera and snaps a few pictures]
PARIS
[her left eyelid hangs heavy] Hey everyone. Sorry if I'm a little spent. I did a whole lot of partying last night with a LOT of different guys. [coughs semen onto her left fist] Anyway, I'm pleased to be here in Gouth Dark to announce the opening of my brand new store! A store where girls can buy everything they need to be just like me! Stupid Spoiled Whore! [the red curtain drops to reveal the store. The crowd cheers] Have fun, girls. And remember to party, and be super-lame to everybody. G'Bye! [steps aside and off-stage. An assistant awaits with water and a tote bag, which has a Chihuahua in it. She holds out a bottle of water] Give me that! Fucking Christ I need a drink! [vomits out feces, then drinks from the bottle. The assistant arms her with the tote bag] Where's my dog?! [walks off]
[Stupid Spoiled Whore, inside. The girls rush in as the doors open and begin to mill around. Bebe leads Red, Annie, and Wendy around. Wendy's still stunned.]
BEBE
Wow, look at all this great stuff. Stupid Spoiled Whore clothes, Stupid Spoiled Whore dolls.
RED
[walks up to a display case] Hey, check it out: the new Paris Hilton perfume, Skanque. [grins and holds a heart-shaped bottle with the name on it]
ANNOUNCER
Skanque.
ANNIE
[carrying some clothes] Oh yeah, let's get lots of that!
WENDY
You guys, don't buy this stuff! Why do you want to be like Paris Hilton?
RED
It's not just Paris: Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Tara Reid, they're all stupid spoiled whores!
WENDY
But the idea that we'll be whorish for money is belittling to our gender!
BEBE
[now with two armloads of clothes] Wendy, get a clue. The only thing more important than being rich is being famous!
ANNIE
Wow, you really sound like a dumb brat, Bebe.
BEBE
Thanks, Annie! [She, Annie, and Red walk away, and Wendy remains stunned]
[South Park Mall, parking lot. Paris's chauffeur holds the limousine door open for her.]
PARIS
[quickly arrives and enters the limo] God, get me out of this hick town! What a bunch of rednecks! [the driver closes the door, starts up the limo, and drives off. Inside, she picks up her Chihuahua and starts talking to it, caressing it] Everybody's so fucking lame. Except for you, my little Tinkerbell. You love my vewy much, don't you? How much you wuv me? I'm gonna dress you up like a bunny, and then I'm gonna dress you up like a little princess. You're mine forever! [her cellphone rings and she answers it, releasing Tinkerbell.] Whatever! Oh, hey, Kasey. Oh, another stupid store opening at some lame cowboy town. [Tinkerbell jumps down from the seat and walks away dejected] Oh, it's so fucking stupid, this whole town stinks like cows. [Tinkerbell is up on the divider and looks down] I can't wait to get out of here! Grody!
[Tinkerbell drops down onto the front seat]
PARIS
They have the lamest stores, too. [... walks over to the driver and digs around his right coat pocket ...] I'm gonna go to Rome for the weekend, I think. I dunno, Rome or Tokyo, either way it'll be totally boring. [... and digs out a small gun from the pocket.] Stupid. [coughs some semen onto her left hand] Hagh. [Tinkerbell carries the gun back to the back seat...] I need to get wasted. I haven't had a drink in like fourteen minutes. Why is everybody so stupid anyway? [... and sets the gun down long enough to put the barrel against its chin. Tinkerbell then tries to set the gun off with her right hind leg. That doesn't work, so she stands the gun up on its butt and tries again] I flashed all these hicks on my boobs; you should've seen the look on their faces! Stupid redneck idiots!
[The gun goes off and Tinkerbell falls over, her brain and blood splattering on the seat's back and rear window.]
PARIS
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
CHAUFFEUR
Oh dear...
PARIS
Another dog killed itself!
[A house. Two girls sit at a dining table doing nothing. Wendy enters and addresses them.]
WENDY
Hey, Jessie [the blonde], Hey, Kal. Do you guys mind if I hang out with you? The other girls are acting really strange.
JESSIE
Sure, Wendy. We were just trying to think of something to do.
WENDY
Oh, well, you wanna maybe go to the art museum?
JESSIE
Nah, that sounds really dull.
KAL
Hey, I know! Let's make a videotape of us having sex with boys! [Jessie likes the idea]
WENDY
What?!
KAL
I just got [brings out a box] the Stupid Spoiled Whore video playset! [the set comes from Letcher Price and "Makes you a whore and so much more!"]
SINGERS
Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset!
KAL
You can make videos that get out on the Internet!
JESSIE
Yeah! [Kal puts on some makeup as Jessie looks on]
SINGERS
Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset! Show the whole world what a slut you are!
ANNOUNCER
Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset comes with video camera, night-vision filter, play money, cellphone, and sixteen hits of ecstasy. [nine hits are shown] [The playset box is shown again, then Kal is shown on the cellphone]
SINGERS
Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset! Let everyone see your coo-ooch!
[The playset box is shown again, then Kal is shown on the cellphone]
KAL
I'm pretending to be calling my friends on the cellphone while my man waits for more sex!
JESSIE
You're a Stupid Spoiled Whore. [Wendy just turns right and walks away.] Where are you goin', Wendy?
[The limousine. Paris is crying over the loss of Tinkerbell.]
PARIS
Bwaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaa!
CHAUFFEUR
All right, Ms. Hilton, we'll find you another dog.
PARIS
[throws a tantrum] Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
CHAUFFEUR
There there now, let's just get you back home, shall we?
PARIS
Woooooooooohooooooooooooooohoooooooooooooooo... [notices something outside] Wait! Wait, stop the car! [the limo proceeds] Stop the car, you fucking moron! [the limo stops] Look at how cuuute. I want that! I want that!
BUTTERS
[playing with some apples on a checkerboard blanket on the front lawn]
Loo loo loo, I've got some apples, Loo loo loo, you've got some too.
PARIS
It's adorable! [exits the limo and closes the door]
BUTTERS
Loo loo loo, let's make some applesauce, take off our clothes and loo loo loo!
[Paris approaches him]
PARIS
Look at his wittle puff ball! [Butters is surprised] I'm gonna feed you, and take care of you, and call you Mr. Biggles! [kneels down and hugs him]
BUTTERS
My name's Butters.
PARIS
Driver, put Mr. Biggles in the car. [the driver appears] I want to find a bear costume for him. Won't he be soo cute dressed up as a bear?
CHAUFFEUR
Paris, I believe this is somebody's child.
PARIS
I want it!
CHAUFFEUR
I don't think you can actually-
PARIS
I want it! I want it! [rocks back and forth]
CHAUFFEUR
All right, all right, come on- come on, young man.
BUTTERS
Wa-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'd like to be your boyfriend and all, uh, even though you have kind of a big nose, but my parents told me, "never get into a car with a stranger."
PARIS
Well, did they say anything about limousines? [Butters thinks about it. An image of his parents appears]
CHRIS
Butters, never get into a car with a stranger. Unless it's a limousine.
BUTTERS
Yeah, actually, they did say that'd be all right.
PARIS
[happily] Get in the limo, Mr. Biggles! We're gonna have a bear costume made for you!
[Wendy's house, night. Her parents are watching TV and munching on chips on the sofa. She enters with her head down.]
ANNOUNCER
And now, back to The Price is Right! [Wendy sighs]
MR. TESTABURGER
Hi, sweetie. What's the matter?
WENDY
Mom, Dad, I'm growing concerned about the role models young women have in today's society.
MR. TESTABURGER
Oh?
WENDY
It seems that lewdness and shallowness are being exalted, while intellectualism is looked down upon.
MR. TESTABURGER
...Gosh.
WENDY
I think young women are being marketed to by corrupt, moral-less corporations.
MR. TESTABURGER
Well, get right on fixing that, sweetie. Wanna watch The Price is Right? [Wendy doesn't answer. Instead, she turns away and walks off slowly, and her parents go back to eating chips]
WENDY
[spins around and walks back] Dad, there's a new store at the mall called "Stupid Spoiled Whore" and I'm gonna go there and buy a thong!
MR. TESTABURGER
[suddenly angered] What?! No daughter of mine is going to dress like a whore! We're marching down to that store right now, young lady!
[Stupid Spoiled Whore, moments later. Wendy and her dad enter the store. He looks around.]
MR. TESTABURGER
Oh my God! Well, this place is-! Oh my God! [approaches a line of girls and their mothers.] Mrs. Faulk, you're buying this stuff for your daughter?!
MRS. FAULK
[giggles] It's what's in right now. I, I can't have my little girl be the only one not in a trend; she'll be unpopular.
MR. TESTABURGER
Unpopular?! If she's not a whore?! [Bebe and her mom now pay attention] But these are our girls!
MRS. STEVENS
I think it's empowering for them. I mean, sure, if a man wants to be a whore, it's normal, but if a woman wants to be one, it's wrong. [the other females murmur in agreement]
WOMAN 1
Yeah, when a man pees standing up, it's normal, but when a woman does it, it's weird.
FEMALES
Yeah! Right!
WOMAN 2
Yeah, like, when men shave their balls it's fine, but when a woman does it she's straaange.
FEMALES
Yeah! Right! It isn't fair!
TEEN GIRL 1
All the girls in South Park are gonna be total sluts from now on, so you can just get used to it.
TEEN GIRL 2
[rubs her ass up against Mr. Testaburger] Yeah. Will you buy me that purse I want over there? I'll do anything, 'cause I'm a whore.
MR. TESTABURGER
[more amenable now] Oh, uh, sure I can buy a purse.
WENDY
Dad!
MR. TESTABURGER
Nope. Wendy, I think they're right. You see, you have to believe in the rights of women. For too long they've had to live a double standard. [enjoying the affection] Oh yeah. I'm sorry I've been so chauvinistic, Wendy. From now on, you can have whatever you want from this store, I'll help make you the stupidest, most spoiled whore of them all!
FEMALES
Hooray!
[The Stotch house, day.]
CHRIS
Butters, will you mind telling us why you're dressed up like a bear?
BUTTERS
[dressed in a bear cub outfit] Oh, well, uh, my sort-of-girlfriend dressed me up like this.
CHRIS
Your girlfriend?
PARIS
[enters the scene] There you are, Mr. Biggles! [picks Butters up and hugs him] Aw, I thought I'd lost you! [caresses him] Promise you'll never leave me. [his parents are stunned]
LINDA
Butters? You're dating Paris Hilton? You are grounded, mister!
BUTTERS
I'm sorry.
CHRIS
[turns his wife around] Uh, sweetheart, isn't Paris Hilton worth a lot of money?
LINDA
Chris, she's more than twice Butters' age.
CHRIS
Yes, and more than three billion times his net worth. Everybody adores that girl, darling. We should be nice to her too, especially if she's in love with our son! [they turn around]
LINDA
Uh, Paris, would you like to have some cocoa with us? [Paris coughs some semen onto her left hand and rubs it against the rug]
PARIS
With schnapps and Scotch. [coughs some more semen onto her hand]
[The dining table. The four persons are seated around it drinking cocoa, with Paris having a bottle of Scotch alongside the cocoa.]
CHRIS
So, Paris, I understand you're from the prestigious Hilton family. Very nice hotels.
PARIS
I've gotta get outta here. This place is stupid. Where am I? Oh, I wanna take Mr. Biggles with me.
LINDA
[stunned again] With you where?
PARIS
To live with me forever and ever, you dumb broad. How much?
LINDA
How much? For Butters?
CHRIS
Butters is our son. He's not for sale.
PARIS
I'll give you two hundred million dollars for it. [Butters is afraid. Chris spits out his cocoa and puts down his cup]
CHRIS
Excuse me?!
PARIS
I said I'll give you two hundred million dollars for it! [Chris spits out his cocoa. Linda does so as well. Paris whips out a checkbook and pen] I'll write you a check for Mr. Biggles right now.
LINDA
Chris, is she serious?
CHRIS
Ah, Butters, why don't you take Paris up to your room for a little while, uh, Mommy and Daddy have to talk.
BUTTERS
[while Paris writes out a check] Mom, Dad, I-I love you. Please don't sell me to Paris Hilton.
CHRIS
Butters, right now!
[The living room, moments later. Chris paces the floor as Linda watches on.]
LINDA
We aren't honestly considering this?
CHRIS
Darling, Paris is a billionaire. She can give Butters everything he wants. We'd be terrible parents not to consider it.
LINDA
But he's our son!
CHRIS
I know, darling, but look: we have to think about the rest of the family.
LINDA
The rest of the f- you do mean us?
CHRIS
Yes, us, the rest of the family.
[Upstairs, in Butters' room. The bed looks nice. Paris is now drunk from the Scotch she added to her cocoa.]
PARIS
What should we do, Mr. Biggles? I drank too much. [falls backward upon the bad] Oh my God, I'm so wasted! [her genitals are exposed] The room's all spinny. I'm... totally passing out. [she falls silent. Butters looks around, then reaches over with his left hand and touches her vagina a few times]
[South Park Elementary. The class bell rings and kids clear the hall. Cartman is at his locker, and near him stand five girls. Wendy walks up to them.]
WENDY
Hey, Bebe. I heard you were having a party tonight.
BEBE
You wouldn't be interested, Wendy. My parents are out of town, so it's a Stupid Spoiled Whore party.
WENDY
I'm a stupid spoiled whore. [her dress is relaxed: blue jeans and turquoise tank top with one strap over the right shoulder. The girls laugh at her reply]
ANNIE
Right. Please, Wendy, you're like Class President and stuff!
RED
Yeah, and you get straight A's in school!
BEBE
You're not even spoiled, because your parents give money to charity!
RED
You don't want to go to this party, Wendy! We're inviting all the boys, and we're gonna play Spin the Bottle, and Two Minutes In The Closet, and do ketamine.
WENDY
That's okay.
ANNIE
Oh, please, do you even know what ketamine is?
WENDY
Yes.
ANNIE
See? You are too smart.
RED
Yeah. We have no idea what ketamine is.
BEBE
Sorry Wendy. You're just not a whore. Get lost!
GIRLS
Yeah. [Wendy turns around and walks off sadly. The others laugh at her, then move on to other topics]
RED
Hey, we'd better start inviting boys to the party.
SALLY TURNER
Oooo, look, here comes Clyde.
BEBE
Party at my house tonight, Clyde. You're invited. [Clyde walks by, wondering what these girls are on about]
MILLIE
Mmm, I'd like a piece of that!
RED
I wanna do him.
ANNIE
Oh, yeah. Here comes Kyle. [Cartman, still at his locker, looks over. Kyle passes by]
SALLY
Mmm, talk to me, kosher boy. [Cartman turns around to see what the girls see]
MILLIE
I'd like to twizel his pixie stick.
BEBE
Party at my house tonight, Kyle.
ANNIE
Tweek and Jason - that'd be a great three-way. [Tweek and Jason walk by]
RED
Yeah, they're invited too.
SALLY
Jason has a huge bulge. You're gonna get it, boys.
BEBE
Now here's what I'm talking about. [Tolkien appears and walks by] A little midnight blue!
MILLIE
Yeah, I'd like to wax his crankshaft!
ANNIE
Be at Bebe's house, tonight, at seven! [Cartman clears his throat, closes his locker, and walks past the girls. Not one of them says a thing.]
SALLY
Look, here comes Kevin. [Kevin appears and walks by]
BEBE
Hey Kevin, party at my house.
MILLIE
I'd like to gargle his marbles.
RED
Yeah, you said it. [Cartman runs back along the hall in such a way that the girls don't notice]
SALLY
See you there, Kev. [Cartman tries again, and the girls notice.]
CARTMAN
"Dude, there's Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure." [the girls say nothing. Cartman stops, gets angry, and walks back to the first girl he saw, then flips each one of them off. He flips Red off with both hands.] Fuck you Millie, fuck you Annie, fuck you Bebe, fuck you whatever your name is, and fuck you, bitch! [leaves.]
[Butters' room. He's gotten interested in Paris' genitals, poking at them.]
BUTTERS
Huh. Didn't I... Whoa, that's the darnedest thing I ever saw. [upon hearing a knock on the door, he gasps and stops probing Paris]
CHRIS
Ms. Hilton? Uh, Ms. Hilton.
PARIS
[awakens and sits up] Eugh. Where am I? Ew! This room's all middle-class and small!
CHRIS
Ms. Hilton, we've talked it over all night and... while your offer is enticing, I'm afraid we just can't sell you our son for two hundred million dollars. [Butters smiles] It'll have to be two hundred and fifty million, cash, up front.
BUTTERS
Oh hamburgers!
PARIS
Yay! Mr. Biggles, you're mine forever!
BUTTERS
[jumps off the bed and runs to Linda] Please! Ah I don't want to live with her! She snores real bad, and she has a huge nose, and a squishy thing that lives in her pants! Please! Please don't sell me to her! [the parents look at each other]
CHRIS
All right, Butters, tell you what: if you can raise the two hundred and fifty million dollars yourself, you can stay.
BUTTERS
Uh, well huh, how am I supposed to make that kind of money??
CHRIS
It's called "working" young man! Your grandfather was a coal miner for fifty years; he never complained! Get out there and start digging!
BUTTERS
Y-yes sir! [rushes out of the room] I-I gotta... mine some coal... really fast!
CHRIS
[to Linda] That should keep him busy for a while while we get this transaction finished. Now, Ms. Hilton, how should we start? [they both grin]
[Bebe's house, night. The living room is all decked out in disco furnishings. A disco ball hangs from the ceiling and harmless laser beams shoot here and there. The girls are enjoying themselves while the boys have mixed expressions.]
MILLIE
[stands next to the closet while a crowd of girls looks on] Okay, that's two minutes. You can come out, Clyde, Bab. [the door opens and Bab comes out grinning] How was he, Bab?
BAB
[winks at Clyde] We had a great time, didn't we Clyde?
CLYDE
[walks out crying with his hands rubbing his butt] Aaaaah, owieeee, owieeee. [a knock is heard at the front door and Red goes to answer it.]
CARTMAN
[dressed very casually, with hair slightly unkempt] Oh, hey, What's goin' on? I'm uh, here for the party.
RED
[not fooled] Yeah? Who invited you?
CARTMAN
Oh, uh-uh Kelly. Kelly invited me.
RED
Kelly who?
CARTMAN
Kelly Rutherford-Menskin.
RED
[looks over her shoulder and calls out] Kelly Rutherford-Menskin?
KELLY RUTHERFORD-MENSKIN
[approaches the door] Yeah?
RED
Did you invite him?
KELLY RUTHERFORD-MENSKIN
No! [goes back inside. Red closes the door on Cartman]
CARTMAN
Oh wait, wait, wait, aah it wasn't her. That's right, I forgot, it was uh... Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter?
RED
[turns around and calls out] Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter?
KELLY PINKERTONSTINFURTER
[sharing a wading pool with Tolkien and Heidi] What? [Red glares at Cartman]
CARTMAN
[under his breath] Oh, Goddammit!
[Herbert Garrison's house, night. The doorbell rings and he goes to answer it. It's raining outside and thunderclaps roll soft and deep.]
HERBERT GARRISON
Oh, hello Wendy. Are you all right?
WENDY
No, I need help.
HERBERT GARRISON
F-from from me?
WENDY
Actually, I was hoping to see your boyfriend.
HERBERT GARRISON
Well sure, come on in. Mr. Slave is right over here. [the camera follows them over to Mr. Slave, who's dangling from the ceiling like a marionette. He's moaning in pleasure]
MR. SLAVE
Oooooooooooh! Oh Jesus, Jesus Christ!
HERBERT GARRISON
Mr. Slave, little Wendy from class wants to see you.
MR. SLAVE
Oh, Hi Wendy. You need a little help with your math homework?
WENDY
No, I need help becoming a dirty whore like you
HERBERT GARRISON
...Oh dear. Mr. Slave, I think you and Wendy better have a little talk. I'll make some cocoa.
[The sofa, moments later. Wendy and Mr. Slave sit side by side.]
WENDY
Mr. Slave, you're the most perverted, lewd, depraved slut I know.
MR. SLAVE
Thank you sweetie.
WENDY
Can you teach me your secret fast?
MR. SLAVE
Honey, I didn't work to become a whore, I was born a whore. I've been one... ever since I can remember. [a shot of the toddler Slave crawling around on a bed] Ever since I was a little boy I seemed to enjoy... different things.
LITTLE SLAVE
Mommy, I think I have a fever. Can you take my temperature? [his mom approaches and sticks a thermometer up his butt] Oooo, Jesus Christ. [grins]
MR. SLAVE
As I got older, I felt that one boy was never enough.
BOY SLAVE
[sees a football practice and fakes a call] Hey, there's that queer kid. Let's tackle him! [holds out his arms and waits for the tackle]
KID
Hey yeah, tackle the queer kid! [the players gang up on him. He seems to love the punishment] We'll show you, queer!
BOY SLAVE
Oooooooooooh! Oooooooooooh! Jesus Christ!
MR. SLAVE
So you see, I can't make you into a whore, Wendy. But why would you want to be one anyway?
WENDY
Because all the other girls are. They're having a huge sex party right now and I'm not invited.
MR. SLAVE
A what?! For God's sake, where?!
[Butters' house, outside. Butters is at the side of the house shoveling dirt from a mound.]
BUTTERS
You work eighteen hours and what do you get? Parents sell ya to Paris Hilton.
[a blue car pulls up alongside and stops]
MAN
Look at that. A bear, mining for coal.
WOMAN
Huh, I never. [the car moves on. Butters' parents, Paris, and her driver approach him]
CHRIS
Well, Butters, how'd it go? Did you dig up two hundred million dollars' worth of coal?
BUTTERS
Well, no, not quite.
CHRIS
Oh, well, too bad. [shows off the check] Ms. Hilton did raise the money, so you'll be going off with her.
BUTTERS
[throws away his shovel] Ah, shucks! [moments later he follows Paris into the limo]
LINDA
Bye, sweetie, we love you!
[Inside the limo, Paris gets her camera and aims]
PARIS
Smile Mr. Biggles! This time I have to get a picture of my new pet before anything happens. [snaps a picture]
BUTTERS
Before what happens? [gets no answer, so looks around and sees her "MY PETS" photo album. He picks it up and leafs through it]
[The shots are gruesome. First up is Tinkerbell, with the gun and blood splattered all over the place; then Patches, a French poodle that hung itself, shown dangling from the noose; then Scrambles, a cat that somehow managed to slit its front paws, lying in a bathtub full of water and blood; then Cuddles, a dog that committed harakiri.]
BUTTERS
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! [throws the book away, gets out of the limo as fast as he can and runs away.]
PARIS
[exits the limo] Mr. Biggles! Mr. Biggles, come back! [Butters' parents approach] You'd better help me find him! No Mr. Biggles, no money! [takes away the check]
CHRIS
Oh that trouble making son of ours! Butters! Butters, you get back here or you are grounded, mister!
[Bebe's house, night. The party is still going strong. One Kelly, who had earlier been with Tolkien, is chasing Kyle. Another Kelly chases Kevin. Red is coming on to Stan. Annie chases Kenny down and catches him. In general, the guys are being chased down by the girls. A girl with dark hair chases Craig, and is about to catch him. Annie talks to Kenny. Millie chases Tweek. Bebe chases Blue Cap. Mr. Slave kicks the front door open and enters with Wendy. Cartman appears behind then and enters.]
MR. SLAVE
Oh Jesus! [turns on the light] Kids, kids!
ANNIE
Ew, party foul!
RED
Shut off the light.
STAN
Oh, thank God.
MR. SLAVE
Girls, what on earth are you doing?
BEBE
We're being stupid spoiled whores. [grins]
BUTTERS
[rushes in] H-help! You've gotta hide me! [opens the closet door and enters] Don't tell her I'm in here! [closes the door]
BEBE
What did you do, Wendy?! Go rat on us because you're not invited to our Paris Hilton party?!
MR. SLAVE
Okay, I think this has all gone far enough! Now look, the last person you want to be like is Paris Hilton!
PARIS
[approaches the house and enters] Mr. Biggles!
MR. SLAVE
[unaware] Paris Hilton is a nobody! She may have money, but she's a thoughtless, talentless lowlife!
PARIS
Who the fuck are you calling a lowlife?!
BEBE
Wow, Paris Hilton is at my party! I rule!
BUTTERS
[bolts out of the closet] HAAAAH! [Bab looks out from the closet, grinning]
MR. SLAVE
Hon, will you just tell these girls that being a whore isn't such a great thing.
PARIS
What isn't great about it? What's more to life than partying?
MR. SLAVE
Look girls, I've partied a lot. Okay? And I'm telling you, there's more to life.
PARIS
You don't even know what partying is, loser. [brushes him off]
MR. SLAVE
Sweetie, really, don't go there, okay?
PARIS
Oh I went there. I went there, took some pictures, and flew back already.
GIRLS
Ooooo!
ANNIE
Wow, what a bitch. [smiles]
MR. SLAVE
Sweetie, listen, I know you've done some "partying" in your private little rich life, but you don't even wanna know the kind of stuff I've done. I'm the real whore, and I'm telling you, it isn't great.
PARIS
Oh yeah?! I challenge you to a whore-off!
GIRLS
Ooooo!
MEN
[popping up out of nowhere] Whore-off! Whore-off!
[South Park's Whore-off. A gazebo is set up for the event in South Park Square. A crowd gathers.]
OFFICIAL
Ah, testing? Hello? [taps the mic a few times] Okay uh, welcome everyone. Uh, the South Park Chamber of Commerce is pleased to bring you the first annual "Who Is The Biggest Whore" showdown. [the crowd cheers]
BEBE
Mr. Slave has no idea what he's in for.
RED
Paris is gonna rock his world.
OFFICIAL
Ah, I'm... not quite sure how we... start this competition off, but uh-
PARIS
[gets off her chair and walks over to the mic] I'll show ya how we start it off. [the music starts and she kisses him hard and grabbing his crotch]
CROWD
Ohhh! [the girls are grinning, Wendy looks at the girls' reactions. Paris then has five men on stage with her, and one of them is licking her leg. Mr. Slave simply observes]
WENDY
[approaches Stan and friends, and Mr. Garrison] What is Mr. Slave doing? He-he's just sitting there.
HERBERT GARRISON
Give him time, Wendy. Give him time. [cheers him on softly] Come on, Mr. Slave.
PARIS
[throws the men off] Back off! None of you losers are enough for me! [whips out a pineapple from behind her back and stuffs it up her vagina] Eeeaaagh. Oh yeah. Aaaargh. [some gasps] Tada! [the crowd cheers and fireworks go off]
RANDY
Oh, no she di'int. [the crowd continues cheering]
[Mr. Slave makes his move: he gets off his chair and walks over to Paris, then moves her around till he's satisfied she's where he wants her to be. The crowd falls silent and Mr. Slave walks back to his chair.]
MR. SLAVE
[dusts himself off and coughs] Jesus. [takes off his pants and takes a running leap towards Paris. He lands on her head and proceeds to swallow her up through his ass, with each swallow accompanied by a grunt. The first swallow takes her head; the second, her chest; the third, her abdomen and lower back; and the fourth takes the rest of her body.] Ohoho, Jesus. [the girls are stunned at what they just saw. The adults, the boys, and Wendy all cheer]
HERBERT GARRISON
Now, that's a whore! [Stan and friends are still stunned. Mr. Slave goes back to his chair and puts on his pants]
BEBE
Wow, I guess Paris isn't such hot shit after all.
MR. SLAVE
People, don't applaud me. I'm a dirty whore. [the crowd falls silent] Being spoiled and stupid and whorish is supposed to be a bad thing, remember? Parents, if you don't teach your children that people like Paris Hilton are supposed to be despised, where are they gonna learn it?! You have to be the- [feels something in his stomach] ooohooho, Jesus Christ. You have to be the ones to make sure your daughters aren't looking up to the wrong people.
MR. STEVENS
The homosexual is right. From now on, Bebe, you're going to dress like a little girl. [the crowd disperses and the girls walk up to Wendy]
BEBE
Wendy, we're sorry we called you names. Like not-stupid and not-spoiled.
RED
Yeah, and I didn't mean to say you weren't a whore.
WENDY
That's okay, you guys. [Butters and his family are shown next]
CHRIS
So-so that's it? No two hundred million dollars? Well, Butters, I hope you're happy!
BUTTERS
[turns right and walks away] I'm a bad bear. I'm a very bad old bear.
CHRIS
You're a grounded old bear.
[Deep within Mr. Slave's intestine, Paris is trying to claw her way out.]
PARIS
Oh my God, it's so gross! Let me out of here! [a light comes on in front of her - it's the Frog King] What the fuck is that?
FROG KING
Paris, you must find the way out of this place or you'll surely die.
PARIS
What?
FROG KING
Make your way to the small intestine. There you will meet the Sparrow Prince, who can guide you to Catatafish. Now go, Paris Hilton. Make haste! [disappears]
SINGERS
[End of Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset. Some singers sing the following song as Paris begins her journey]
A great adventure is waiting for you ahead.
Hurry onward Paris Hilton or you will soon be dead.
The road ahead is filled with danger and fright
But push onward, Paris Hilton, with all of your might.
Paris Hilton... Paris Hilton, Paris Hilton
Paris Hilton... Paris Hilton, Paris Hilton
Paris Hilton... Paris Hilton, Paris Hilton
Stupid whore!

synopsis:After sustaining a severe head injury, Cartman appears to have the power to see into the future. South Park detectives are quick to enlist his help in cracking unsolved murder cases.

script:Cartman's Incredible Gift

[Cartman's yard, side of the house, day. The fourth grade boys are gathered there for some reason.]
CLYDE
I don't know, that looks pretty high up.
BUTTERS
Yeah. I think it'd be better to start lower.
STAN
Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman. [Cartman is shown at the edge of the roof wearing wings made from cardboard]
CARTMAN
This is gonna be totally cool, you guys.
STAN
It's not gonna work; just come down from there.
CARTMAN
[assessing the situation] ...Jeez, this looks a lot higher from up here.
KYLE
[arrives in time to see Cartman's attempt] What's going on?
STAN
Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof. [Kyle looks up to see what the others see. Cartman looks down]
KYLE
Do it! Do it!
CARTMAN
I'm gonna!
CRAIG
I wouldn't if I were you.
TOLKIEN
Those wings don't look very strong.
KYLE
Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly!
CARTMAN
Okay, here we go. [steps forward and gets ready to launch himself] Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to-
KYLE
Awww, go on and do it already!
CARTMAN
Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations.
STAN
[to Kenny] He's not gonna do it.
CARTMAN
And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight! [he flaps his cardboard wings a few times to get some lift, then jumps off the roof. He heads straight for the ground and lands on his face with a grunt. All the boys are shocked and stand there frozen for several seconds. Stan is the first to leave, then Kyle, then the rest of them. Only Butters remains, and he turns to watch the others leave. After a few seconds of uncertainty, he leaves too.]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Cartman is in a recovery room with bruises on his face and a black left eye. The medical staff attends him. Outside, Ms. Cartman appears and rushes in to see Cartman.]
LIANE
Oh my God! Eric! Eric, [caresses him] Mommy's here. Sweetie? [notices Dr. Doctor] Oh, what's wrong with him?
DR. DOCTOR
I'm afraid that your son is... incredibly stupid. He thought he could fly with cardboard wings. The stupidity is so severe that it caused a fall, which has... put him into a deep coma.
LIANE
Coma... My God, fo- for how long?
DR. DOCTOR
There's no telling. He may never recover. We'll just have to wait. And see. [the camera looks at Cartman, then pans up and fades out]
[Hell's Pass, some time later. The camera pans down back onto Cartman, who is now covered in facial hair and a bandage around his head.]
SINGERS
Seasons change, time passes by.
As the weeks become the months become the years.
CARTMAN
Eugh... [sits up, his eyes still closed.]
LIANE
[stands up and drops her book] Oh my- Doctor! [Cartman blinks] He's awake! [the doctor and nurse return]
CARTMAN
Wheh? Where am I?
LIANE
Oh, you've finally come back! It's a miracle!
DR. DOCTOR
You're at the hospital, Eric. You've been in a coma for some time.
CARTMAN
Coma... How long?
DR. DOCTOR
It's been two... days. Nurse, you can remove his face-warmer now.
NURSE
Yes, Doctor. [tugs at the facial hair and it comes off.]
DR. DOCTOR
Now, Eric, you've suffered massive head trauma. Your road to recovery will be long and arduous. At least another two days. [a shot of the hospital's exterior, then back to the recovery room, where Liane is giving Cartman a glass of chocolate milk]
SINGERS
Seasons change, time passes by.
As the weeks become the months become the years.
LIANE
You're doing so much better, muffin.
CARTMAN
Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap!
LIANE
Oh, you're sounding just like your old self again.
DR. DOCTOR
[at another patient's bed] I'm sorry, detectives, there was nothing we could do.
YATES
Damnit! Another murder victim! For three years the Left-Hand killer has been at large and I've exhausted every lead! Maybe... I just don't have what it takes to be a cop anymore.
MURPHY
We'd better get back to the station, sir.
CARTMAN
Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours!
YATES
All right, let's go, Murphy. Hang on a second, where are, where are my car keys?
CARTMAN
Probably in your front pocket, dumbass!
YATES
[fishes around in the front shirt pocket and is surprised to find them there, then turns to the doctor] Doctor, didn't you say that kid suffered head trauma?
DR. DOCTOR
Yes, it was pretty severe.
MURPHY
What is it, Lou?
YATES
I've... heard cases where people suffering head trauma awaken to some psychic abilities.
MURPHY
Aw, come on, sir.
YATES
I know it's ridiculous, [turns right and walks off] but I'm gonna explore every possibility I can! [Murphy follows. They arrive at Cartman's bed] Hello, young man, could we have a quick word with you?
CARTMAN
Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch.
NURSE 2
Twelve-thirty, Eric. Lunch time. [the officers are amazed at how timely the nurse came with the lunch]
YATES
Young man, how did you know the nurse was gonna walk in just now?
CARTMAN
I don't know, I just knew it. [receives the tray from the nurse and sniffs] Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?!
NURSE 2
Yep, meatloaf again. [the officers get a little frightened]
MURPHY
Jesus, how did he...?
YATES
Little boy... [whispers to himself] Well it's a snowball's chance in hell but... [back to Cartman] we were wondering if you could come down and see if your... new powers could help us catch the killer.
LIANE
His new... powers?
[Stark's Pond, newly restored from the demolished Wall Mart, much bigger than it was before, night. A crime scene at the docks is shown, complete with boat floating around.]
FEMALE DETECTIVE
All right, make sure you get pictures of everything in this crime scene. [one officer takes pictures, another handles evidence gingerly. Nearby, a police tape is lifted so Cartman could check out the scene]
OFFICER 1
Who's the kid?
OFFICER 2
He's supposed to be some kind of psychic.
OFFICER 1
Aw, Christ!
YATES
[with Murphy, Liane, and Cartman] This is... where the body was found. [overhead shot] Multiple stab wounds, just like all the others.
CARTMAN
How come the outline is missing its hand?
MURPHY
The killer always cuts off the left hand of his victim, and keeps it as a trophy. [Cartman walks around the outline, inspecting it.]
YATES
Stand back, give him room! [moves to hold the crowd back] Come on, kid, concentrate! What do you see in your mind?
[Cartman begins to concentrate and his eyes begin to twitch. First he sees a cupcake with chocolate topping and sprinkles, then powdered doughnuts, then a cup of vanilla ice cream - with sprinkles being added.]
CARTMAN
Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles... [he sees a hand holding Double-Stuff Oreo] Double-Stuff Oreos... [a second hand comes up and twists off the lower cookie] He ... He's taking the top of one and... [squeezes his eyes closed and sees another Oreo attached to the first one so there are two fillings between the cookies] ...and he puts it together to make Quadruple-Stuffs! [the detective writes down what Cartman is seeing] I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs!
YATES
Jesus Christ!
MURPHY
Sir?
YATES
Tom Johansen, the owner of the ice cream shop!
[Tom Johansen's house, night. The detectives ring his doorbell and he answers.]
TOM JOHANSEN
Yes? Oh, hello, detectives.
YATES
Mr. Johansen, could we have a quick word with you?
TOM JOHANSEN
Sure, come on in! [he backs up and leads them in. The lead detectives calls in some officers hidden nearby, and they come in] I'm afraid the house is a little bit of a disaster area since I have-
YATES
Get him! [the officers tackle Tom Johansen and beat him harshly with their batons] Code 6! Code 6!
OFFICER 3
Use the taser! Use the taser! [another officer fires a taser into Tom Johansen, who then convulses and falls to the floor]
OFFICER 4
Do it again! [the officer shocks Tom Johansen again, causing more convulsions]
[Tom Johansen's house outside, front. Police cars and vans have gathered outside and the siren lights are still rotating.]
OFFICER 3
He put up a hell of a fight, but we got him!
TOM JOHANSEN
Why?! Why?! [the officers haul him away]
YATES
Congratulations, Eric. You just stopped the biggest killer in South Park history.
MURPHY
We would give you a reward, but I guess that knowing the people of South Park are safe again is reward enough.
CARTMAN
Guess again.
MURPHY
[walks over and hands him some money] All right, here's a hundred dollars.
CARTMAN
Wow!
YATES
[to Liane] His powers are uncanny. Take good care of him, Ms. Cartman. Make sure he uses his powers... for good.
LIANE
Oh, he will. My little poopsiekins is a very good little boy.
[South Park Elementary, day. The school bell rings. Cartman runs down the hall.]
CARTMAN
I'm a psychic and you are worse. I have super-awesome powers and you don't.
KYLE
[walks up. Other kids gather behind him] Cartman, what did you do?!
CARTMAN
Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks! [shows off the money]
KYLE
Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it!
CARTMAN
Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes?
KYLE
Because you're a fucking fatass, that's why!
CARTMAN
Do not doubt my powers, Kyle!
KYLE
You don't have any powers!
CARTMAN
Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thought!
BUTTERS
Wuh be careful, Kyle.
KYLE
He can't do crap!
CARTMAN
Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at! [closes his eyes and starts making sound effects and hand motions. The boys behind Kyle except Stan and Kenny scatter, and the detectives spot him as they enter the school.]
YATES
There he is! Hey, Eric! Eric! [they approach him, he turns around] We've got a little problem.
CARTMAN
What?
YATES
While the ice-cream store owner was in jail, another murder was committed.
MURPHY
This body also had a missing hand and a bowl of corn flakes next to it!
YATES
Which can only mean one thing!
KYLE
Ha! You see?!
YATES
That a copycat killer is on the loose! We need your psychic abilities to catch this new guy right away!
KYLE
What?!
MURPHY
We'll pay you up front this time! We've gotta catch this new guy before he kills again.
CARTMAN
I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go!
[Field report.]
CHRIS SWOLLENBALLS
Tom, I'm standing in a meadow just outside of town, where police have discovered the first victim of the serial copycat killer. Child wunderkind Eric Cartman is now arriving on the scene. [Cartman approaches the body, which is covered with a red blanket]
[The crime scene.]
KYLE
This is fuckin' ridiculous!
LOU
Whattaya got, wunderkind? Are ya seeing anything?
CARTMAN
No. Nothing.
OFFICER 5
Maybe his powers have left him.
OFFICER 6
Yeah.
CARTMAN
Wait a minute. [his right arm twitches and he sees a bucket of chicken, then sees some chicken served next to the powdered doughnuts he saw earlier. His eyes are squeezed tight.] Fried chicken! It's tender and it's fresh! [sees some syrup poured onto the chicken] There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken!
KYLE
What the hell is wrong with these people?!
MICHAEL DEETS
[in robe and cap] They're never gonna catch the serial killer. He's too smart. Do you want to see my cotton panties? [whips open his robe to reveal himself dressed in a yellow bikini. The boys look on, a little afraid]
KYLE
Hey! What about this guy?!
MURPHY
Quiet! He's havin' a vision!
CARTMAN
It is fried chicken! [first he sees a plate of fried chicken, then the maple syrup, then some whipped cream, then some chocolate syrup, then a cherry on top...] Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae.
WEIRD MAN
[brings out a mannequin torso and head and strikes up a conversation with it] "Junior, what are you doing out?" I'm sorry, Mother. "You come home right now and have sex with me!" No, Mommy! [goes away]
KYLE
Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?!
LOU
I said quiet, you little brat, or I'll have you arrested for interfering with the law!
[The News 4 logo and screen come up on a TV.]
ANNOUNCER
This is Park County News 4, with your host, Jim Brown-ish
JIM BROWN-ISH
The copycat killer of the cut-off-the-left-hand killer has been arrested. Police used the help of Eric Cartman, a wunderkind psychic detective. At the crime scene, the young psychic had visions flash before his mind, and the police immediately arrested the owner of Kentucky Fried Chicken. The young man's visions were so astounding that other police departments have sought out his help.
[Cartman's house, day. He's in his room counting the money he's made from his psychic work.]
CARTMAN
If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
[someone knocks on his door, then the door opens]
LIANE
Eric, sweetie, there's um, some people here to see you.
CARTMAN
More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring.
LIANE
Ah, no, these people claim that they are the "real" psychic detectives. [Cartman stops counting money and freezes]
[Living room, moments later. Liane and Cartman enter.]
FEMALE PSYCHIC
So, you are the little boy who's been taking all our work?!
LIANE
Oooh, I'll go make some tea.
MALE PSYCHIC 1
Kid, we have a problem. You didn't go through the proper channels to become a psychic detective like we all did.
OTHER PSYCHICS
Yeah!
CARTMAN
Proper channels?
MALE PSYCHIC 2
You were supposed to fill out the form on the back of the comic book and pay the twenty five dollar fee for the degree from the Psychic Detective School. [shows the ad in question. Looks nice]
CARTMAN
I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School.
MALE PSYCHIC 1
Well you just can't say you're a psychic detective, you have to use the ad in the comic book!
FEMALE PSYCHIC
You must pay the twenty five dollar fee and give us ten percent of your earnings!
CARTMAN
[laughs at them] Ten percent, my balls, get lost!
FEMALE PSYCHIC
Very well, then you give us no choice. Roger?
[Roger steps out from behind the sofa and prepares to battle Cartman psychically. Cartman simply observes, then responds. He and Roger "battle" with sound effects and hand gestures.]
FEMALE PSYCHIC
All right, everyone! [the rest of the psychics join in the battle against Cartman. Liane returns with the tea.]
LIANE
Oh, goodness! What's going on?
CARTMAN
Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds!
LIANE
O-o-o-o-oh! [prostrates herself]
FEMALE PSYCHIC
Enough! [one male psychic is slow to respond] We are ...obviously quite evenly matched. I guess this will have to be settled in court.
CARTMAN
In court?
FEMALE PSYCHIC
We brought a class-action lawsuit against you! We'll see you before the judge tomorrow! [the psychics turn and walk out]
LIANE
Is it over? [the front door closes after the last psychic leaves]
[A camera shutter is heard and a picture of Ms. Crabtree appears, with blood next to her left cheek. Her left hand is missing. A detective continues taking pictures.]
MURPHY
[reading from a fact sheet] Her name is... Veronica Crabtree, bus driver for the elementary school. She was considered an ancillary character, one the fans wouldn't miss much.
YATES
Jesus Christ! Cause of death?
MURPHY
Same M.O., sir. Multiple stab wounds, left hand cut off and missing.
YATES
So you're telling me somebody new is now copying the crimes of the copycat killer?! Jesus! Where will it end?! [goes to a nearby tree to think] Every time I put a killer behind bars, another guy just steps in and takes his place! What am I doing wrong?!
KYLE
[arriving with Stan and Kenny] Excuse me, sir? I think I know who did this. We saw this guy at the last crime scene, and, and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime? Well, I followed this guy to his house, and when he left again, I collected some fingerprints and did a blood-sample analysis. [holds out his findings] I'm pretty sure he's your man.
LOU
[coolly] How do you know?! Are you psychic?!
KYLE
No.
LOU
Look, kid, don't waste my time with your blood-sampling fingerprinty hocus-pocus! I have to find this new killer now! I owe it to that victim over there! I know she hadn't been in any recent episodes, but dammit she deserved better than this! Come on, Murph, we've gotta talk to Eric Cartman again! [leaves with Murphy]
KYLE
Why won't anybody listen to me?!
KENNY
[pats Kyle on the shoulder] (Don't take it personally, Kyle.)
KYLE
[shrugs Kenny off] I am taking it personally because Cartman is a retard! Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman.
[Kyle's house, later. Kyle is standing at the edge of the roof at the side of his house, sporting his own cardboard wings.]
STAN
Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea!
TOLKIEN
There has to be another way!
KYLE
Be sure to take me to the same hospital!
BUTTERS
Now Kyle, don't fly too close to the sun, or it'll burn your wings, an- and you'll crash into the ocean.
STAN
[under his breath] Butters, Goddammit.
KYLE
All right, here we go. [spreads his wings] Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day we remem- aw, screw it! [jumps off and lands on the ground below]
STAN
[a few moments later, sighs] Call an ambulance.
[Channel 4 News. A picture of handcuffs is shown, with "ARRESTS MADE" above it.]
JIM BROWN-ISH
Multiple arrests were made today for the murder of Hillary Neals. Police raided the South Park Motel 6 at 4 a.m., where seven psychic detectives were staying. [footage of the arrests is shown. Two of them are beaten, a third is slammed against a squad car until the side of her head begins to bleed, and a fourth holds police at bay. He tries to fight them with his powers, but they simply open fire and kill him where he stands] The psychic detectives' horrible crime was found out by psychic detective Eric Cartman, [shown in dramatic pose with psychic waves emanating from his forehead] who is now the only psychic not behind bars. What an amazing coincidence.
[Cartman watches the news from the sofa in the living room at his house.]
CARTMAN
Cool. [the doorbell rings and Cartman concentrates] Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle! [the door opens and the weird man from the crime scenes enters and approaches Cartman] Who are you?
MICHAEL DEETS
You. You give everyone else credit for my work, because you fail to see my greatness.
CARTMAN
... 'Kay. Sweet.
MICHAEL DEETS
Because of you, nobody knows the extent of my deeds.
CARTMAN
Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second. [hops off the sofa, walks away a bit, and calls out] Mom, there's some homeless guy here. Make him go away. [the weird man quickly advances and smothers Cartman's face with a cloth, making Cartman inhale chloroform. Cartman passes out.]
[Next scene is an unknown place. Cartman is strapped down to a wheelchair. He awakens and struggles a bit.]
CARTMAN
Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?!
MICHAEL DEETS
You are obviously a big fan of my work.
CARTMAN
I don't even know you dude!
MICHAEL DEETS
But I am the serial killer! The one whose rightful place in history you have smirched!
CARTMAN
Oh, Jesus.
MICHAEL DEETS
And now you will have a place of honor, as my nineteenth victim.
CARTMAN
No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want!
MICHAEL DEETS
Before you die, let me show you the things that I've done, so you will understand the breadth of my transformation! [starts up a slideshow projector] This... is me at the grand canyon. [shows a shot of him there] Do you see? This is me at Mount Rushmore [the next picture is shown, with him looking lovingly at the faces there] Do you see?
CARTMAN
[nervously] Heheh.
MICHAEL DEETS
Do you see?!
CARTMAN
Yes yes, I see! [another Mount Rushmore picture is shown, with the man looking at the camera this time]
MICHAEL DEETS
Here I am at the Alamo in San Antonio. [this time he looks psychotic, with his hands ready to grab something] This was just outside of the gift shop. Do you see?!
CARTMAN
AAAAAAAH!
[Park County Police Station, night.]
YATES
[hangs up the phone] Dammit! Dammit all to hell! They just found another body! That means a fifth copycat killer is on the loose! Where's my psychic?!
FEMALE DETECTIVE
Sorry, Sarge, the psychic's mom says her son hasn't been home for a couple of hours.
OFFICER 7
Sir! Dr. Kels just called from the hospital! He says another little boy just awoke from a coma, and is having psychic visions!
YATES
[grabs his hat] Let's go! [other officers follow]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, later. Dr. Doctor leads them into the recovery room.]
DR. DOCTOR
This is the young man here. He was in a coma for over sixteen hours. [a shot of Kyle with a bandage around his head. He too has a face warmer on, but no black eye like Cartman had]
YATES
Doctor, could you remove his face warmer? We'd like to speak with him.
DR. DOCTOR
Of course. Nurse? [a brunette approaches and removes the warmer. Sgt. Lou and Det. Murphy approach the bed]
YATES
Young man, the doctor said you've had some... visions about our newest murder?
KYLE
I see... a man... with a baseball cap. [Sgt. Lou snaps his fingers and Det. Murphy whips out a notepad and pen and starts taking notes. Kyle concentrates] He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing it all flash before my eyes! The guy's name is Michael Deets, and he lives at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually there between seven and eleven p.m.
YATES
What do you think, Mitch?
MURPHY
I don't know. How do we know this kid is really psychic? I mean, this boy is certainly no Eric Cartman. [Kyle clenches his teeth in rage]
YATES
All right, we'll check this Deets guy out. But let's use that one thing that we never use.
MURPHY
...Sir?
YATES
You know, what's that one thing that starts with an R that we never use?
MURPHY
...Restraint?
YATES
Yeah, yeah, restraint. We'll check this guy out, but let's use some restraint. [they leave]
[Michael Deets' basement. He's still showing Cartman his slides.]
MICHAEL DEETS
Look! Look at the things I've done! Here I am at Yellowstone National Park! [shows off the picture] Do you see?! Here are pictures of my trip to Cheyenne for Frontier Days. Do you see?!
CARTMAN
Oh, God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me! [the doorbell is heard. The two detectives are outside, Yates ringing the doorbell. Michael Deets opens the door]
YATES
Good evening, sir. We're Park County detectives. We were just wondering if we could take a quick look around your house, Misterrr...
MICHAEL DEETS
God.
YATES
Well, Mr. God, it won't take but a second; it might help us with an investigation. [he shows them in. The house is dark, with stacks of paper everywhere. Pictures of his victims line the walls. Downstairs, Cartman tries to get their attention, but he's gagged.]
CARTMAN
(Hey! Come over here!)
YATES
I see you like cutting the eyes out of photos of women. My son is a big fan of that, too.
MURPHY
Sarge! In here! [Lou runs into the next room. They both face a wall of left hands nailed in place]
YATES
Jesus H.... That boy was right! Arrest that guy! [Murphy gets right on it. Yates thinks about the hands] Whoa-whoa-wait-wait-hey-wait-wait-yo! Oh, wait a minute, no ah, I'm wrong.
MURPHY
Sir?
YATES
This isn't the guy. The serial killer always cuts off the victims' left hands.
MURPHY
Right.
YATES
Well those aren't left hands. [holds up his own left hand, palm in] See, on your left hand, the thumb faces to the left. Those are all right hands.
MURPHY
Ohhh. [they return to the living room]
YATES
Nope, this isn't our man. [they turn to leave the house and see Michael Deets in the shadows] We're sorry, Mr. God. It appears we've wasted your time. [they head out]
CARTMAN
[in the basement] (Hey! Help!) [upstairs, Mr. Deets closes the front door]
MURPHY
Heh, pretty amazing coincidence that guy had a bunch of hands on his wall. Heh, no wonder that boy thought he was a killer.
YATES
[stops and thinks] Yeah... Amazing coincidence...
MURPHY
[backs up] Heh- sir?
YATES
Call it police intuition, but somethin' in there just didn't feel right. [thinks for several seconds] Wait a minute.
MURPHY
Sarge... [Lou slowly raises his hand palm in and analyzes it. Then he turns his hand over slowly until the palm is out and is jolted with recognition] What is it?
YATES
I'm not sure. I'm gonna have to run some tests. [runs off to do just that]
[Park County Police Station, night. Montage. Yates types away at his computer, then analyzes his left hand again, then returns to the keyboard. He then goes to the lab and looks over his notes. Next to him are two hands, one right and one left. He rotates the right hand so both thumbs point to the left, from his POV, then takes more notes. He develops some pictures in the darkroom and finds matching hands. He works with a 3D model drawing with another computer, then traces his left hand on a wall and takes measurements. He returns to the lab and works with some chemicals. Next he chops some firewood into smaller chunks. Next he's at a gym jumping rope. Next he's at a beach far from South Park playing volleyball with some women. Next he's repairing the body of a car with a welding torch...]
YATES
[back at the station, looks in on Murphy] Murphy, do you remember what I was supposed to be doing?
MURPHY
Oh. Uhhh... Oh. Something about hands, sir? Uh, for the serial killer?
YATES
[snaps his fingers] Oh right! The hands! Right! [the montage resumes]
[Again he goes to his computer and types away then he's back at the lab taking pictures of the two fake hands there, then makes silhouettes of a dog, then models another hand in the computer and gets a match.]
YATES
Oh my God. Murphy! [Murphy appears quickly.] You're not gonna believe this.
[Michael Deets house, basement. Michael Deets has resumed showing his pictures to Cartman. A picture of him at Ocean World's Splash Zone is shown, then a blank. He turns the projector off.]
MICHAEL DEETS
That's it, no more pictures. [walks in front of Cartman and faces him, then pulls out a sharp knife] Time to die.
CARTMAN
No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested.
MICHAEL DEETS
Your hand will be one with the others.
CARTMAN
Please just let me go! Ah, I'm gonna tell everyone I'm not really psychic! I've learned my lesson! Please, I don't wanna- [spots the detectives descend the stairs and approach the room] I don't wanna have to use my psychic mind missile on you! [begins to concentrate and make noises]
YATES
Hold it right there, killer! [Michael Deets turns and rushes at them with the knife. Yates fires three shots into him, killing him. The detectives advance, and Yates fires a forth shot into the body, looks around, and fires a fifth shot, getting blood splattered on himself]
CARTMAN
You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability.
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. The detectives, the psychics, Mr. Johansen, Dr. Docter, Cartman, Stan, and Kenny are present.]
YATES
Well young man, you did an amazing thing. Not only did your psychic visions help us catch the killer, but a lot of innocent people are out of jail.
TOM JOHANSEN
Yes, thank you very much, Kyle.
FEMALE PSYCHIC
Yes, thanks.
MURPHY
You're certainly a better psychic then Eric.
KYLE
No, don't you see? Cartman never had psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard.
MURPHY
Do you think that's true?
YATES
It must be true. The kid is psychic. [thinks a moment] But I don't suppose it really matters much. Because in the end, the way I caught the killer was with... good old-fashioned police work. Come on, Murphy. [they leave the room and then the hospital]
FEMALE PSYCHIC
[addressing Cartman] Well young man, I guess that just leaves one score to settle.
CARTMAN
You can't hurt me.
MALE PSYCHIC
Then let this be our final battle! [the psychics face Cartman once again and battle him with their power. Nothing happens, but there's a lot of noise.]
KYLE
[irritated] Just stop it! [at the top of his lungs] Stoop iiit!! [the lights go out as the bulbs shatter, then the shelf above his bed falls and everything on it hits the floor. The psychics and Cartman stop their battle and witness all this] There's a logical explanation for that.
End of Cartman's Incredible Gift

synopsis:Stan agrees to help a group of adorable woodland critters build a manger in anticipation of the birth of their Lord and Savior, only to find out that they serve Satan.

script:Woodland Critter Christmas

[A panoramic view of South Park, day. Holiday music is heard in the background, and the scenes are played out as the narrator mentions them.]
NARRATOR
Way up in the mountains in a small little town,
The Main Street was being decorated all up and down.
People stood in long lines, sometimes waiting hours or more,
Because Christmas needs to be bought in a store.
But out in the forest, not too far away...
[A nearby forest. The camera pans down from the sky and rest upon a Christmas tree. Forest animals gather round and decorate it.]
NARRATOR
...The little woodland critters were also preparing for their Christmas Day.
WOODLAND CRITTERS
It's almost time when the time is here,
The time that's only once a year.
We can hardly wait, 'cause it's so near.
A Woodland Critter Christmas!
NARRATOR
The little critters worked hard as they happily sang,
And each one of them had a quite interesting name.
There was Squirrely the squirrel, Rabbity the rabbit,
Beavery the beaver, and Beary the bear.
Porcupiney the porcupine, Skunky the skunk,
Foxy the fox, and Deery the deer.
Woodpeckery the woodpecker, Mousey the mouse,
and Chickadee-y the chickadee, all made the forest their house.
And on that magical day, stumbling upon all of that,
was a surprised little boy, in a red poofball hat.
STAN
[walks by with a sled] What the hell?
SINGER
Christmastime is once a year
Every critter holds it dear
Every animal big or small
Christmas means so much to us all
[The forest. The critters approach Stan.]
RABBITY
Well, hello there. Welcome to our forest.
SKUNKY
How do you like our Christmas tree?
STAN
It's... nice.
BEAVERY
Why, it's the most perfect tree in the forest! [the others cheer]
MOUSEY
Oh no, I see a problem.
DEERY
What is it, Mousey?
MOUSEY
Our Christmas tree doesn't have a star!
CRITTERS
Awww.
BEARY
We can't have a tree with no star on it.
RABBITY
What are we gonna do?
SQUIRRELY
Now don't be down, y'all. Maybe our new friend can help us find a star.
CRITTERS
[among other things] Can you really? Oh would you please? Could you help us?
STAN
Okay, okay.
CRITTERS
[cheering] Yay!
NARRATOR
And so, using some paper and working with glee,
the boy in the red poofball hat made a star for the tree.
CRITTERS
Ohhhh!
BEARY
It's the nicest star I ever saw.
NARRATOR
The little critters cheered and Beavery said with a smile...
BEAVERY
How would you like to sing and dance with us for a while?
NARRATOR
The boy in the red poofball hat smiled and said...
STAN
[doesn't smile] Uh, no thanks, I'm gonna go home. [turns around, picks up the reins on his sled and walks off]
BEAVERY
Goo- goodbye Stanny!
CRITTERS
Goodbye, Stanny! Bye! Cya! I'll buy your hat!
STAN
Woof.
[Stan's bedroom, night. He's asleep in bed, but wakes up, turns over, and turns on his light.]
CRITTERS
Hi, Stanny!
STAN
Oh, whatta? [squeezes his eyelids shut]
NARRATOR
His friends were all there! What a wonderful surprise!
The little boy smiled with joy in his eyes!
STAN
[irritated, grabs his clock] What time is it?!
SQUIRRELY
You aren't gonna believe what happened, Stanny. It's the most magical Christmas gift ever!
SKUNKY
Porcupiney is pregnant!
STAN
[sighs] You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow.
MOUSEY
I deduce the man-boy doesn't understand the seriousness of the fertilization.
DEERY
Porcupiney is a virgin, Stanny. Her conception was immaculate.
FOXY
She's gonna give birth to our Lord and Savior.
STAN
...What?
PORCUPINEY
It has been foretold unto me that I would give birth on Christmas Day.
MOUSEY
So soon!
SKUNKY
How delightful!
WOODPECKERY
Our souls are saved!
CHICKADEE-Y
Finally the critters are gonna have a Savior of their very own, of their very own! [they all cheer]
SQUIRRELY
[hops onto Stan's bed] There's just one problem: We don't have a manger for our Savior to be born in.
CRITTERS
Awwww.
BEARY
But we got to have a manger.
RABBITY
Can you do it, Stan. Can you build us a manger? Huh?
CRITTERS
(Cheers)
NARRATOR
"Of course I'll build you a little manger!" the little boy cried,
and he winked at his critter friends and leapt to their side!
[The forest. Stan has built the manger and is hammering the last few nails in place.]
NARRATOR
And out in the woods the boy steamed right ahead,
making a place for the critter babe to lay its sweet head.
RABBITY
Gee whiz, if it isn't the nicest manger I ever saw.
MOUSEY
I deduce it shall serve as a perfectly suitable resting place, for the Son of our Lord.
RACCOONY
Does this mean we can go to sleep now?
PORCUPINEY
My son will have the nicest bed in all the forest.
WOODPECKERY
Fit for a king!
SQUIRRELY
This is going to be the best critter Christmas ever!
WOODLAND CRITTERS
It's almost time when the time is here,
The time that's only once a year.
We can hardly wait, 'cause it's so near --
STAN
[as they sing] All right, I'm going now. [He ambles off. A roar is heard nearby. All stop and look. The critters scream.]
CRITTERS
The mountain lion! Hide! [They scatter, leaving Stan to face the lion alone. The lion peers out from behind a tree.]
STAN
Go away! Shoo! [The lion moves off and the critters return.]
SQUIRRELY
Is it gone?
MOUSEY
I deduce it is.
SKUNKY
[behind a low tree] I'm not c-c-comin' out.
FOXY
Well, this is the end. The mountain lion obviously knows Porcupiney is pregnant, and he's gonna kill it again.
STAN
Again?
SQUIRRELY
Every Christmas the mountain lion comes down and eats the virgin critter impregnated with the Son of our Lord.
PORCUPINEY
Oh dear, I'm so very afraid.
BEAVERY
[climbs onto a stump and sits up] Let's face it. The mountain lion will never let our Savior be born.
CRITTERS
Awwww! [some of them sob]
SQUIRRELY
Hey, we shouldn't be upset this Christmas. We've got Stanny!
RACCOONY
Of course! Stanny can do anything! If he can build a manger, he can stop that mean ol' mountain lion!
PORCUPINEY
Christmas is saved! [the critters cheer]
[The camera looks up from the woods to a mountain in the distance. Dramatic music plays.]
NARRATOR
High up in the forest on a dark, craggy peak,
the horrid mountain lion and preyed on the weak.
For the critters to be saved, someone had to stop that nasty old cat...
STAN
Goddammit, this is fucking ridiculous!
NARRATOR
Said the little boy in the red poofball hat.
NARRATOR
Killing a mountain lion was no easy task,
But he thought of a plan, and he thought of it fast.
STAN
[gesturing] Grrr! Grrr! Come on out! [The lion is heard roaring from inside the cave, and it roars. It approaches the entrance.] Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr! [Anticipating the lion's leap, he runs off. The lion lunges at him, but misses. Stan moves to the side of the peak and turns, gesturing.] Rawrrrrr! [Stan runs up the side of the peak, and the lion follows. Stan reaches the peak and turns to face the lion. The lion lunges at Stan again. Stan drops out of the way and the lion goes over the peak and onto its death below, at the cave entrance.]
NARRATOR
In a flash, it was over! A victorious blow!
The mountain lion lay slain on the cold ground below.
[The cave entrance. Stan sees that the mountain lion is motionless and approaches.]
STAN
Okay, there. [three lion cubs approach the entrance]
LION CUB 1
Mommy? Mommy! [they rush up to her body] W... wake up, Mommy, wake up!
LION CUB 2
Don't leave us, Mommy. [Stan realizes that this dangerous mountain lion was a mom, so his jaw drops. The pale cub approaches him.] Man-boy, why? Why did you kill our mommy? Why?
STAN
[at a loss for words] I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior? [The cubs snuggle close to their mom's body, sobbing.]
NARRATOR
The tiny cubs all gathered together and cried,
All alone in the world because their mother had died.
STAN
[turns away and squeezes his eyes shut] Aw- awww!
[The forest floor, night. The critters have set up a campfire close to the manger and are keeping warm by it.]
PORCUPINEY
[feeling a kick] Oooo.
BEARY
You all right, Lady Porcupiney?
PORCUPINEY
Oh yes, just felt a little kick is all.
BEAVERY
Well, it's been much too long now. Uh I'm afraid our helpful friend Stanny must be very dead.
FOXY
Yep, the mountain lion probably swallowed him whole.
RABBITY
I guess that means our Savior is gonna be made into Savior stew.
CRITTERS
Awwww.
CHICKADEE-Y
[flitting straight up into the air] Wait a minute, look! [the animals turn to see Stan approaching them]
CRITTERS
Stanny! [they gather in front of him]
MOUSEY
Stanny, you're alive.
BEARY
But, does that mean you killed the mountain lion?
STAN
It's dead.
DEERY
For real and for true?
BEAVERY
Are you sure?
STAN
I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.
SQUIRRELY
He did it! Now our Critter Christmas can finally happen! Hail Satan!
CRITTERS
Hail Satan!
STAN
Wait, wha-what?
BEAVERY
You've done us a huge favor, Stanny! Without the mountain lion around, the Lady Porcupiney can give birth to the Antichrist!
CRITTERS
Yaaay!! [they head over to the manger]
STAN
Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior!
SQUIRRELY
Yeah, to the Son of our Lord, Satan, Prince of Darkness.
STAN
But I thought you meant the Son of God!
DEERY
Well, think about it: You really think God would have sex with a porcupine?
CHICKADEE-Y
No way! Only Satan, Prince of Darkness and King of all Evil would do that! Yay!
FOXY
This just calls for a celebration! Let's sacrifice Rabbity and eat his flesh!
RABBITY
Yay! Sacrifice me to the Devil!
[The other critters cheer. Stan is frozen stunned as Beary pulls up a Satanic altar on a small wagon with a little help from Squirrely. The other animals bring Rabbity up to the altar. Rabbity is propped up on the altar and Beary tears him apart with a sacrificial blade. The other animals crowd in, tear away pieces of the body, and eat them raw.]
CHICKADEE-Y
Drink his blood! Drink his blood!
SQUIRRELY
[jumps into a puddle of blood] Blood orgy!
CRITTERS
Yay, blood orgy! Blood orgy, yay!
[The critters drench themselves in Rabbity's blood and begin the orgy. Beavery mounts Raccoony, Skunky mounts Porcupiney, Mousey mounts foxy, and Beary mounts Deery. Squirrely hops onto Deery's left ear and mounts that. Chickadee-y and Woodpeckery start flitting around. In the background is heard "Sting, so true!" Stan stares, traumatized.]
CRITTERS
What special time and special day,
It's Woodland Critter Christmas.
SQUIRRELY
[a circular window opens and he pops up] Hail Satan.
[The forest floor, night. The critters return to the manger and decorate it with Satanic symbols, including (what is presumably) Rabbity's skull. As the narrator speaks, the following takes place. The star atop the manger is turned so it points down. Owls bring flowers to the mountain lion's corpse. The lion cubs are shown, then the mountain peak, then Stan is shown with his head buried into his arms at his desk in his room.]
NARRATOR
In the gentle forest clearing on Christmas Eve morn,
The little forest critters prepared for the Antichrist to be born.
The noble mountain lion had stopped evil in all the years past,
But now the good protector lay dead as the good owls amassed.
And meanwhile, three lion cubs were crying away.
For them, there would certainly be no Christmas Day.
And soon the forest would suffer from the offspring Satan begat.
All of this because of the little boy in the red poofball hat.
STAN
Ugh.
NARRATOR
Now that he'd killed the noble lion queen,
there was nobody to stop the Apocalypse, it seemed.
STAN
Uuugh!
NARRATOR
"I know!" he said with a new happy grin,
"I'll go back to the forest and speak with those critters again!"
STAN
[waves the narrator away and leaves his desk] No, no-no-no.
NARRATOR
He ran out the living room, turned out the light,
and went back to the forest to set everything right!
[Stan enters the living room, hops on the sofa, and turns on the TV. "The Jeffersons" theme song is heard.]
And went back to the forest to set everything right!
[Stan ignores the narrator and continues to watch the TV.]
He tried to forget all about it by watching TV,
But his conscience caught up with him and to the forest he did flee...
[He turns the volume up to drown out the narrator, but to no avail.]
He thought he could hide from his problems - not true!
[Stan rolls his eyes]
He knew in his heart the thing he had to do!
STAN
Leave me alone!!
NARRATOR
He knew that only by going to the forest could he --
STAN
All right, all right, all right! God! [He turns off the TV, hops off the sofa and walks out the door, leaving the remote control on the floor.]
[The manger at the forest clearing, day. The animals continue decorating.]
BEAVERY
[looks around] Hey, look everyone! It's our old pal, Stanny. [the other critters turn and look]
WOODPECKERY
Oh boy, Stanny. You came just in time!
DEERY
Yeah. We've got a big problem.
SQUIRRELY
The Great Satan has commanded that when the Antichrist is born, we must find a human host body to transfer it into.
CHICKADEE-Y
That way he could take over the whole world! The whole world!
MOUSEY
The human must be non-baptized and heathenistic against Christ.
BEAVERY
We figured you'd be perfect!
CRITTERS
Yay!
STAN
I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian!
CRITTERS
Awwwww.
BEARY
But we got to have a human host body for the Antichrist.
DEERY
Oh dear, maybe we won't have a critter C-Christmas after all.
SQUIRRELY
Now don't be down, y'all. Stanny can help us find non-baptized heathen human.
CHICKADEE-Y
Will you really, Stanny?
STAN
No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist! [walks off] I came here to put a stop to all this!
BEAVERY
To stop us?
BEARY
But gee whiz, Stan, if you try to stop us, we'd have to use our evil Satanic powers on ya.
STAN
Right, whatever. [turns around] I'm taking down the manger I built. [Beary's eyes turn red and brighten. A wall of hellfire appears before Stan.] Ah! [The wall gets higher.] Aaaah! [All the critters' eyes are flashing a bright red. Black crows swoop down and attack Stan.] Aagh! Aaaahh! [A two-headed demon dog appears snarling at him; he runs off in terror.] AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH! [The critters' eyes revert back to normal.]
BEARY
Oh boy! Our Satanic powers sure did the trick!
CHICKADEE-Y
Our powers get stronger every day! Get stronger every day!
SQUIRRELY
Sorry Stanny, but you see, nothing can stop the birth of the Antichrist, except for a mountain lion.
SKUNKY
And you got rid of her.
CRITTERS
Yay!
NARRATOR
The boy shook with anger! He broke a sweat and fell ill.
Then he remembered there were three mountain cubs still alive on the hill!
STAN
Oh yeah.
[The mountain peak, day. Stan climbs up to the cave again.]
STAN
Hello? Anybody in there? [the three cubs appear at the entrance of the cave]
LION CUB 3
Oh no, it's the man-boy who killed Mommy!
LION CUB 1
He's come to kill us now!
LION CUB 2
It's okay. I died inside when Mommy was killed anyways.
LION CUB 3
Yeah, better this than the slow death we'd face without a mother around.
STAN
Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil.
LION CUB 1
You got tricked by a squirrel? Gee, you're not too smart, are you, mister?
STAN
I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion!
LION CUB 3
Yeah, and you killed her.
STAN
Well, you're mountain lions.
LION CUB 2
Us? No, we're just kids. We still have our baby teeth.
LION CUB 1
And our baby claws.
LION CUB 3
And a dead mom.
STAN
There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby.
LION CUB 3
What? You mean like in an abortion?
LION CUB 2
Yeah. An abortion. That can work.
LION CUB 1
But, we don't know how to give abortions.
LION CUB 3
Do you know some place we can learn, mister?
NARRATOR
"Where can they learn that?" the boy said with a frown.
"I know! The abortion clinic just outside of town."
STAN
[cross] What?!
NARRATOR
So he picked up the cubs and down the mountain he stormed.
And took them to where abortions are performed.
STAN
No, he didn't.
NARRATOR
Yes, he did.
STAN
No, he didn't!
NARRATOR
Yes, he did.
STAN
No, he didn't!
NARRATOR
Yes... he... [Next scene has Stan holding the cubs at the abortion clinic as the doctor there prepares to abort a baby.] did!
STAN
Oh, Goddammit! [the doctor and patient are startled]
NARRATOR
Said the boy in the red poofball hat! "We've made it already, little cubs! Fancy that!"
DOCTOR
[walks over] Excuse me, what are you doing here?!
NARRATOR
The abortion doctor inquired.
DOCTOR
If you wanna be in the OR, a pass is required!
STAN
I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous.
DOCTOR
Well, you're in luck, I'm happy to inform!
It's only three days until Christmas, so I have lots of abortions to perform!
Gather around my table, cute little lions,
I'll teach you to do abortions without even tryin'!
NARRATOR
And so the little boy and the cubs gathered around the chair base,
And all day watched abortion after abortion take place.
[Montage. The doctor puts on his gloves and the cubs peer into the patient's vagina. Stan peers in as well, from a distance. The doctor works away happily and cleans up well. The patient leaves, and the next one is worked on. Lion cub 2 is on a desk next to a bottled fetus. He hops off, knocking the bottle off as well. The bottle pops open and the fetus falls out. Everyone turns and sees the fetus on the floor, and laugh about it. The doctor works on the next patient and Lion cub 3 brings him some forceps. The doctor smiles and strokes the cub's head. The other two cubs snuggle up to the patient on her shoulders, and she smiles at them.]
SINGER
Christmas time is once a year.
Every critter holds it dear.
Every animal big or small,
Christmas means so much to us all.
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!
And it happens once a year.
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!
When we hear about how Christmas only comes
Once a year.
STAN
This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point.
[The forest floor. The critters walk along singing their Christmas tune.]
CRITTERS
It's almost time when the time is here,
The time that's only once a year.
BEARY
Oh look. That little feller is all alone.
SKUNKY
Gee, he looks sad. [Kyle is seen kneeling next to his sled, looking sad.]
CRITTERS
Hi there!
KYLE
[gets up and turns around] What the hell?
BEAVERY
How come you're all alone on Christmas Eve.
KYLE
My... family doesn't celebrate Christmas.
RACCOONY
Aww, but why?
KYLE
Well, because, we don't really... believe in Jesus.
CRITTERS
[cheering] Yay!
BEARY
But does that mean you aren't baptized?
KYLE
No. I'm Jewish.
CRITTERS
[exulting] Yay! Yay! [they gather around Kyle]
BEAVERY
You've got to come with us!
DEERY
You're perfect! Just pu-perfect!
KYLE
Huh?
CRITTERS
[taking him away] Yay! Woohoo! Woohoohoo!
CRITTERS
What special time and special day,
It's Woodland Critter Christmas.
SQUIRRELY
[a circular window opens and he pops up] Hail Satan.
[The woods, night. The camera pans along to reveal a glowing red pentacle in the starry sky.]
NARRATOR
'Twas the night before Christmas, and above the woods, way up high,
a new bright shiny star hung in the sky.
For the world to be saved there was only one shot,
A little boy with three cubs and an abortion plot.
STAN
Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born?
LION CUB 3
Sure. We know how to give abortions now.
NARRATOR
He arrived at the critter forest ready to fight,
but then gasped when he saw a most dreadful sight.
[The critters are standing around the manger. A grotesque creature lies in the cradle.]
BEAVERY
Gosh, we did it!
SQUIRRELY
The critter Antichrist is born, bringin' a thousand years of darkness to the forest. [The Antichrist growls and throws little fits.]
NARRATOR
The Antichrist had been born, sealing the world's fate.
The boy in the red poofball hat... was too late.
STAN
Too late?! The hell is that?!
BEAVERY
Oh. Hiya, Stanny!
KYLE
[now tied to the altar, frightened] Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?!
STAN
It's Critter Christmas, dude! It sucks ass!
SKUNKY
Now all we have to do is put the Antichrist into our human host.
CRITTERS
Let's go! All right! Woohoo!
STAN
[turns to the lion cubs] That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?! [Skunky, Squirrely, Beary, and Chickadee-y walk over to get Kyle. Santa's sleigh appears in the sky.]
NARRATOR
When up in the sky the sound of sleigh bells were heard,
And a jolly red sleigh flew down to the earth like a bird!
BEAVERY
Wow, look, there's Santy Claus!
CRITTERS
[cheering] Yay!
RACCOONY
Let's eat his flesh! [the sleigh lands and rolls to a stop]
SANTA
[hops out] All right, what the hell is going on?! Why is there a red star glowing in the sky?!
RACCOONY
We finally did it, Santa! We brought forth the Antichrist with help from our good friend, Stanny.
SKUNKY
Death and pain await all living things.
SANTA
Little boy, you should be ashamed!
STAN
I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them!
SANTA
Well good going, stupid! There's only one way to stop devil-worshiping critters! [He reaches back and whips out a long shotgun. He fires, and the top half of Beavery's head is gone.]
CRITTERS
Aaaaah! [They scatter. Santa fires again, and Deery goes down. Two more shots and the tops of Raccoony's and Skunky's heads come off.]
STAN
Dude, what the- ? [Squirrely activates his demon power with the red glow from his eyes and a wall of hellfire appears before Santa.]
SINGERS
Hold steady, Santa.
[Santa simply hops over it, gets into position, and fires at Squirrely, blowing him to smithereens.]
STAN
[goes to untie Kyle from the altar] Come on, dude. [Santa continues firing at the remaining critters. Porcupiney is blown apart, then Foxy.]
BEARY
Gee whiz, Santa, you're not gonna kill me, are you- [His head is blown off and he goes down.]
LION CUB
But Santa, what do we do about the Antichrist? [Stan and Kyle join Santa and the cubs.]
SANTA
Don't worry, boys. The Antichrist cannot survive without a human host body to go into.
KYLE
[looks down] No. [walks towards the manger] No, I want to have the Antichrist inside me!
STAN
What?! Kyle?!
KYLE
[now in the manger, behind the trough] With his power, I can finally make the earth a better place for the Jews!
SANTA
Don't do it, Kyle! [Grinning evilly, Kyle holds the little Antichrist in his left hand. A glow emanates from the Antichrist and its spirit floats out of its body and into Kyle's chest.]
STAN
Dude!
KYLE
[returns to the altar, climbs up, and exults] Yes, yes! Now the Jews shall take control of Christmas once and for all! HAHA! HAAA!!
KYLE
[voice-over] Oh, stop it, Cartman! [the spell is broken]
[Mr. Garrison's class, day. All the students are seated, and it turns out they're taking turns telling Christmas stories. Cartman is telling his now.]
KYLE
Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story!
CARTMAN
I don't believe anyone interrupted you when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle. [behind him on the board is written "Write Your Own Christmas Story Day"]
KYLE
This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!
CARTMAN
Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?
MR. GARRISON
Sorry, Eric, but if Kyle feels discriminated against, you'll have to stop or else I'll get a call from his mother.
CARTMAN
[closes his booklet] All right, fine! Forget it! [He drops off the stool and heads for his desk.]
BUTTERS
Well but, but what happened?
TOLKIEN
Yeah. Did Kyle bring a thousand years of darkness or not?
CLYDE
What happens to the lion cubs?
CARTMAN
Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends.
STAN
No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner.
KYLE
Dude, why do you care?!
STAN
Well, after all that, I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth.
KYLE
Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved!
CARTMAN
That's not at all what happens.
BUTTERS
Aw well, come on. Let him read us the end.
CLYDE
Yeah yeah, come on! [the other kids chime in]
KYLE
All right, fine!
CARTMAN
[He returns to the stool and resumes the story. He clears his throat.] "Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?" said the little boy in the red poofball hat.
[The spell is restored. Kyle is back on the altar exulting.]
KYLE
HAHAHAA! Now I shall rule the -- [feels something...] Aww. Uuugh. God it burns! AAAH! My soul is on fire! Whoa! Oh, I don't like this! [hops off the altar] I didn't know it would feel so... dark and evil!
STAN
Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil.
KYLE
Oh God, what have I done?! [sits down] I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist.
SANTA
[with his shotgun at the ready] I'm sorry, but it's too late, Kyle! Santa's gonna have to kill you! [pumps the shotgun]
STAN
No Santa, don't!
SANTA
We don't have a choice. In a few hours, the dark creature inside him will consume his soul.
NARRATOR
The little boy fretted. He almost started to bawl,
But that's when he came up with the best idea of all.
STAN
The lion cubs!
NARRATOR
The little boy quickly begun,
STAN
I took them to see how abortions are done.
SANTA
What?
STAN
Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast!
Get the Antichrist out of my friend Kyle's ass!
NARRATOR
And in the twinkling starlight, each little cub did their portion.
They remembered all they had learned and gave Kyle an abortion.
[The lion cub 3 is deep in Kyle's ass, retrieving the Antichrist with his teeth. He succeeds and takes it to Santa quickly. Santa takes it and sets it down on a tree stump. Santa grabs a large sledgehammer next to the stump, raises it over his head, and bring it down upon the Antichrist, smashing it to bits with a loud THUD.]
KYLE
Thanks, everybody. I'm sorry I got a little crazy there.
SANTA
Well little boy, it seems that you [points to Stan] have really been through a lot. Is there any special present you would like this year?
STAN
[smiles] Yeah. Yeah, there is.
[The lions' cave. Santa arrives at the corpse of the mountain lioness and moves his hand over it, releasing some magic dust and watching it settle. The lioness stirs.]
MOTHER LION
Wha -- Oh my, what happened?
ONE OF THE CUBS
[the three of them run up to greet her] Mommy?
THE CUBS
Yay! You're back! We missed you, Mommy!
STAN
[relieved] Oh, good.
[Stan's house. He runs into his parents' arms as Shelly and Grandpa look on. Next, they're all seated at table, eating. Next, Stan and Shelly are opening their gifts.]
NARRATOR
And back home, there were presents, and lots of food to get fat.
And it was the best Christmas ever for the boy in the red poofball hat.
[A shot of the town, receding from view.]
NARRATOR
And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Kyle, who died of AIDS two weeks later. [Q shot of Kyle back in the hospital, dying.]
KYLE
[voice-over] Goddammit, Cartman!
[End of Woodland Critter Christmas.]
SINGERS
[as credits roll]
Christmastime is once a year,
Every creature holds it dear,
Every animal big or small,
Christmas means the world to us all,
It's once a year, it's Christmastime,
When we hear about how Christmas only comes
Once a year.
End of Woodland Critter Christmas
