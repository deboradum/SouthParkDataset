synopsis:Cartman wants to hold the government accountable for secretly monitoring all of his personal information.

script:Let Go, Let Gov

[The bus stop, day. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are waiting for the bus]
KYLE
I am sooo sick of that stupid bitch! Blabbin' pussy little skank! Why do people talk on their phone like that?! I can't even get a minute of peace before that bitch walks in, holding the cell phone out like this [holds his hand out], and talking on speaker phone! Nobody wants to hear your goddamned conversations, you little bitch! You're not that important!
CARTMAN
[walks up to them, talking to someone on the phone via speaker] Yeah, I know dude. I'm telling you, it was the worst pain in my entire life.
LAWRENCE
How many hours were you guys playing?
CARTMAN
Like six hours, dude. And my friends were all like "Dude, Cartman, we need you to keep playing defense!"
KYLE
AAAARGH!
LAWRENCE
You were playing football?
CARTMAN
Yeah, but I was like "I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle." In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'?
KYLE
That is not what happened! You totally started crying and quit the game!
CARTMAN
[softly, covering the phone] Kyle, this is a private conversation.
KYLE
Then take that shit off speaker phone!!
LAWRENCE
Is that that same kid?
CARTMAN
Yeah, it's that kid Kyle again. He's a total boner, always listening in on my calls.
KYLE
How do we have a choice?!
CARTMAN
Stop listening to my conversation, Kyle! What are you, the NSA?! Lawrence, remember how I was tellin' you the NSA listens to everyone's phone calls and reads all our e-mails?
LAWRENCE
Yeah yeah, you said that.
TOBY
My dad says the government keeps a database on everyone.
CARTMAN
Who is that? Is that Toby?
TOBY
Yeah.
CARTMAN
Dude, Toby, are you over at Lawrence's?
TOBY
Yeah, we're ditching school.
CARTMAN
You're what? What, you say?
LAWRENCE
Me and Toby are ditching school!
[Cafeteria, lunchtime. The boys are at table, and Kyle looks worn out.]
CARTMAN
I'm telling you guys, the government thinks they can do whatever they want, and we don't have any privacy anymore! [he's not talking to his friends at the table, but to his friends on the conference call] Just between you and me, I think everyone is too stupid to see what this is all leading to. Did you guys read "1984"?
LAWRENCE
I don't think so.
CARTMAN
See, I didn't read it either, but I saw the puppet show version up at Casa Bonita. We have to do something about this! We need to organize a rally! [Kyle takes the top bun off his burger]
LAWRENCE
That'd be cool.
CARTMAN
That'd be what?
LAWRENCE
That'd be COOL.
CARTMAN
I know, right? [Kyle puts the bun back on the burger, then takes his tray with him and walks away] A big rally to tell the government to stay out of our private lives! I'm gonna e-mail everybody and put it up on my blog pages! [having lost his appetite, Kyle throws his food away, puts his tray on the nearby cart, and walks off. Cartman approaches the trash can] I seriously feel like I'm being spied on right now. [carelessly throws his trash away, with fries spilling onto the floor, puts his tray carelessly on the card, then walks off behind Kyle] I'm sure the government has a file on me a mile long; that's why this is so important, you know? [Kyle stops, his anger rising] Hang on, I'm gonna make a video blog for my "Stop Listening To Me" Web site. [turns on the video feature on his phone and starts recording] What's up everybody? It's me again, just kicking it at my skeal. There's gonna be a big rally to tell the government to stop gathering information on us! Gonna tweet you all the details, but keep quiet, 'cause it's top secret! [ends the video and goes back to his phone friends. Kyle leaves] You guys gonna update your blogs too?
[Outside on the playground. Cartman is still on the phone with Lawrence while Kyle and Kenny try to play tetherball. Cartman is just too damned loud.]
CARTMAN
Dude, I really can't hear you Lawrence. Are you outside or something?
LAWRENCE
I said I got your tweet and the address!
CARTMAN
Okay, well put Toby back on the phone! You guys start Googling everyone the directions to the rally site. Toby, are you there, bro?
TOBY
Yeah, I'm here, bro.
CARTMAN
Bro, you gotta um, e-mail Jack about the rally and see if he'll bring petition forms. [Kyle just walks up to Cartman and stands next to him]
KYLE
[calmly] Will you please take your rally conversation somewhere else?
CARTMAN
Oh heeell NO you didn't just invade my privacy again?! That is the LAST STRAW, Kyle! [runs off, then stops and addresses everyone on the playground] Everybody! Everybody hey! Just so you know, we might have an NSA agent right here at our school
BUTTERS
Ww-ww-what's the N-S-A?
CARTMAN
That just so you know, the government is watching everything you do! Always watching! They say it's to keep us safe! But what price is safety, Kyle? [walks away. The other kids disperse and go back to what they were doing. Only Butters and Kyle remain.]
BUTTERS
The government watches everything we do?
[Butters' bedroom, night. As a moonbeam bathes his bedroom, Butters is still wondering about the government watching him.]
BUTTERS
Hello?? Hey Government... It's me... Butters. Ah I just wanna say, well, well, thanks for watching over me and, and doin' everything you do. ...An and please watch over Mommy, and Daddy, ah an and my friends Stan and Kyle, Craig and Tolkien, and and even ol' Eric Cartman. Uh I know he can be a meanie sometimes, but please watch over him too. Goodnight, Government. [smiles, then walks to his bed and goes under the covers, then gasps] Oh yeah. [gets out of bed and goes to his mark] Ah, and thank you, President Obama, for, for making me feel so safe and looked after. And if it wouldn't be... too much trouble... [a little softly] I'd really like to get a puppy for Christmas this year. [normal] 'Night, Government. [goes back to bed]
[The school's computer lad, next day. The kids are typing away on their keyboards and Cartman is on the phone again...]
CARTMAN
Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is tracking me! We're gonna have to put off the rally.
LAWRENCE
They're spying on you?
CARTMAN
Yes, right here. I went to Amazon to see if they had Grand Theft Auto V, and it says, "you might also be interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek." I'm totally interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek! How did they know that unless the government is keepin' tabs on mw?! [pounds the keyboard with his right fist. The other kids begin to star at him] This is war, bro! Forget the rally, we have to go hard core!
LAWRENCE
Like what?
CARTMAN
Alright, listen. I'm gonna get a job at the NSA, and then I'm gonna put all their secrets up on Twitter.
LAWRENCE
Naw, don't do that.
CARTMAN
No! Dude, I'm gonna sneak into their headquarters disguised as an employee, and I'm gonna- [gets suspicious] Hey, hang on a second, Lawrence. [hides behind his monitor for a moment, then slowly stands up on his chair] I think we have a Nosey Nancy in the room. [sits down] Dude, my Twitter account might already be compromised. If I'm gonna infiltrate the NSA and get all their secrets out to the public, then I'm gonna need something better than Twitter.
LAWRENCE
You need that new thing where you don't need to type.
CARTMAN
What, they already have something better than Twitter?
LAWRENCE
You haven't seen the Alec Baldwin commercial?
CARTMAN
No! What Alec Baldwin commercial?
[This one. Alec Baldwin is on the set of his latest movie, in his director's chair]
ALEC BALDWIN
Hello. I'm Alec Baldwin, and I love social media. [whips out his phone] But sometimes, I accidentally tweet things that are homophobic. I don't think that way, I just type that way. That's when I realized it wasn't me that was homophobic, it was my thumbs, and they needed to be gotten rid of. [a shot of him chopping his right thumb off with a meat cleaver, then doing the same with his left thumb. He groans in pain each time.] So then the problem was, I don't have thumbs. But I know that everyone in America still wants to hear everything I have to say.[Now in a park by a lake. He's on a bench, with a camera behind him. He turns to look at it] Well, that's okay, because now there's a device that can actually take the thoughts in your head and send them directly to the Internet. It's called... Shitter. [points to a pair of antennae attached to the crown of his head. Next follows a stick-figure representation of the process]Wires are grafted harmlessly into your skull and any thought you have is uploaded to the Internet, and on to all your Shitter followers. [more stick figures appear, each with their own Shitter antennae. Then he's shown at a baseball park: "I'm at a Yankess game right now." The men on either side look at him. "God I love baseball." Next he's on a plane next to an elderly woman with her cat in a pet carrier. "People who take their cats on planes should be shot." He looks away, and the elderly woman looks at him. Next he's at a theatre. "I'm at a really great musical right now." The woman to his left notices the antennae. Next he's at an outdoor restaurant looking at a menu. "In 1992 I had sex with the Queen of Monaco. I had my entire fist up her ass." Back on set] Don't let your social media slow down our need to communicate with the world. Go direct from thought to Internet ...with Shitter. ["Just finished my Shitter commercial. Time to go find a pussy sandwich."]
[South Park Elementary, day. Kids are milling around the hallways. Kyle is shown walking down one hall when Cartman's voice is heard]
CARTMAN
["Alright, what's up everybody, what's up? I'm about ready to go to the NSA undercover, and see if I can expose some of those secrets." When Cartman appears, Kyle stops. "You can follow me on my Shitter account at #keepyourgovernmentoutofmybusinessdotcom. Wait, sh, I've gotta be careful. Kyle is here and I'm pretty sure he's tryin' to listen in."]
KYLE
[notices the Shitter device and gets angry.] What the hell are you doing?!
CARTMAN
[walks up to Kyle. "Kyle, if you wouldn't mind, this broadcast is for my Shitter followers only." Clyde and Stan join them]
CLYDE
What's Shitter?
CARTMAN
[leans towards Clyde. "Don't know if you've heard, but the government is actually able to monitor all our e-mails and Twitter accounts." leans towards Clyde. "With Shitter I don't even need a cell phone. My thoughts are sent directly to the Internet, and then to everyone else on Shitter."]
STAN
Wow.
CARTMAN
[leans towards Stan. "Yes. Now as I infiltrate the NSA, I'll be able to broadcast everything to all my Shitter followers."]
KYLE
You're okay with everything you think going up on the Internet?
CARTMAN
Yeah, because the government won't respect my privacy.
CLYDE
How many people are on Shitter?
CARTMAN
Just two so far: me and Alec Baldwin.
ALEC BALDWIN
["I'm about to sit down and eat a sandwich at this amazing deli run by two faggots in Chelsea."]
CARTMAN
["Oh cute. I'll have to try it out sometime, lol."]
ALEC BALDWIN
["In 1982 I was at a party at Mike Douglas' house and I fucked Kim Basinger."]
CARTMAN
["Wow, that's kewl. She's cute. ;) emoji"]
[Colorado Department of Motor Vehicles, day. Butters is waiting to be called. A monitor displays "TICKET #395 WINDOWS 15" and a small bell dings.]
BUTTERS
Oh my God. Oh my God they say me. They saw me and they're gonna be so angry! Maybe they didn't see me. No! No, they saw me, they see everything! I did something really bad. Really really bad. [ding]
CLERK
[not shown] Next!
BUTTERS
Oh God, uh... but my parents always told me, "If you do somethin' horrible, then you have to admit it to your protector, so that you can have forgiveness." Are these people nice?
MAN
DMV people? They're the meanest people on planet Earth.
BUTTERS
Oh Jeez. [The monitor displays "TICKET #403 WINDOWS 15" and a small bell dings. Butters gets off his seat...] Oh God, huh... Here we go. [...and walks up to a clerk, but has no idea what to do] I yelled at a midget. [a few seconds pass by] I was, I was watching MTV and-and this little person was singing a song, eh - I think her name was "Pink" - but I I didn't like the songs and so I yelled! "Hey, get off the TV you effing midget!" [no reaction] And I, I was at Barnes & Noble with my mom, and while she was looking for a book I, I saw this picture of Jennifer Lawrence in a magazine. Um it and I, well, I cut the picture out of the magazine while no one was lookin'. Dirty whore! I took the picture home with me and I, and-I, I cut Jennifer Lawrence's mouth out with scissors and then I... well I put my wiener through the hole. I have no idea why!! How can I atone for it?! I already said the Pledge of Allegiance 50 times! And I sang "My Country Tis Of Thee" 100 times! And I watches "America's Got Talent" twice! What else can I do?
CLERK
Why not a thousand "Livin' In America"s?
BUTTERS
Yes! Yes I will! Oh, thank youhoohoo! I will! Oh, I feel so much better already! [begins to walk away and launches into the song]
Livin' in America!
Eye to eye! Hand to hand!
Across the nation!
Smokestack, fatback,
Many miles of railroad track
Ow! I said Ow ow!
[exits]
[N.S.A. Headquarters, Maryland, day. Cartman walks in, dressed in a suit and wearing a fake mustache, and approaches the front desk.]
RECEPTIONIST
Can I help you sir?
CARTMAN
Yes, I'm here to apply for the NSA job?
RECEPTIONIST
All right, and your name?
CARTMAN
Bill Clinton.
RECEPTIONIST
[checks her calendar on the computer] I don't see you on the list, Mr. Clinton.
CARTMAN
Oh well, must be a clerical mistake, but they are expecting me.
ALEC BALDWIN
["If you're ever in Los Angeles, be sure to look up Jennifer Love Hewitt. She can make a pussy sandwich that will give those faggots in Chelsea a run for their money"]
CHIEF
What have you got, Patricia?
PATRICIA
Uh, this man says he has an interview for a job, sir?
CARTMAN
I am extremely qualified, sir, and very eager to work.
ALEC BALDWIN
["I borrowed my brother's dick once to fuck Darryl Hannah."]
CARTMAN
[clears his throat as a distraction] I was um, sure that the appointment was today.
CHIEF
That's quite alright. The NSA needs all the help it can get. Come on upstairs and I'll show you around, see if you're fit for the job.
[The neighborhood. Two women knock on Butters' door. Butters answers it and sees two Polynesians. One carries a Bible, the other carries some pamphlets]
PAMPHLETEER
Hello sir. My colleague and I are going through the neighborhood and seeing if you'd like to know the Truth. [hands him a pamphlet]
BUTTERS
Sure, I love the Truth.
PAMPHLETEER
Okay, we from uh Jehovah Witness. We Kingdom Hall Jehovah Witness, and uh, we believe, sir, that uh many people interpret the Bible it wrong.
BUTTERS
Wull what's a Jehovah's Witness.
PAMPHLETEER
We are, sir. We believe the, the Truth. I was once like you. I knew not what to believe, then I let my pulvy the Jehovah into the heart.
BUTTERS
Oh my goodness! Your little cartoon has a girl on fire!
PAMPHLETEER
Yes, because uh Jehovah will bring judgement against all who perish like the little girl will burn in fire.
BUTTERS
Oh, you shouldn't be handing out drawings like that, ma'am. Uh, don't you know that the government is watching you?
PAMPHLETEER
The government ih watching me?
COLLEAGUE
Wansa?
PAMPHLETEER
He said the government ih watching us. [they turn slowly to face the street]
COLLEAGUE
Hi now?
PAMPHLETEER
How long they been watching us?
BUTTERS
Can I ask you something? When was the last time you went to your local DMV?
PAMPHLETEER
[turns to face him] I don't go to DMV. I don't have car.
BUTTERS
Oh, you can walk there. Trust me, you've gotta go to the DMV. It's incredible! See, I was like you once. Afraid, unsure, and doin' stuff I shouldn't do like showin' people pictures of little girls with their heads on fire. But you know what I've learned? That just goin' to the DMV, and letting go of all my wrongdoings, filled me with a joy I've felt nowhere else! Would you like to read some DMV literature? [goes and gets some booklets he picked up at the DMV. He hand them the booklets and they leaf through them] This'll tell you most of what you need to know about the DMV. But just go. Everyone there is really nice. Your government is watching you and your government wants you to be happy. Have a nice day! [smiles and closes the door, then walks towards the kitchen]
[N.S.A. Headquarters, Maryland, day. The chief takes Cartman on a tour.]
CHIEF
Right this way, Bill. Welcome to the NSA main office.
CARTMAN
Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens.
CHIEF
There's a lot of people working here at the NSA. Good people, people who just wanna keep America safe. Only problem is, checking all those e-mails, Twitter accounts, and surveilling all those phone calls can take a lot of manpower. [they stop at a desk]
DETECTIVE
Hey Joe?
JOE
Whatchoo got, Miller.
MILLER
Got a 24-year-old male in Albuquerque. He just e-mailed his wife and asked if she could go to the store after work. Then he called the fitness center to set up a membership. He liked the fitness center, so he tweeted his friends that they should try it out.
JOE
...Alright, keep an eye on them. Let me know if anything changes. [he and Cartman move on]
MILLER
Will do.
JOE
It's a never-ending grind here at the NSA, and it seems there's never enough detectives to keep track of everyone. [they go further into the office to reveal a large room with over a hundred detectives all at their desks keeping tabs on everyone else.] Sergeant! What have you got, Larson.
LARSON
Got a seventeen-year-old female down in Jacksonville. She called her friend and asked her if she wanted to see the Percy Jackson movie. Then she e-mailed her mom at work and asked if it was okay. The mom said yes, but called her husband first to make sure there weren't any dinner plans.
JOE
Alright, keep an eye on all three of them.
LARSON
Will do. [Joe and Cartman walk a few steps, then turn around. Behind them is the other half of the large room.]
JOE
If you think you got the stomach for this, then we can definitely use your help, young man.
DETECTIVE
Sir, you might wanna check this out.
JOE
What have you got?
DETECTIVE
Thirty-two-year-old pizza delivery man. He just put it on his Twitter account that he hates America and wants to blow up the Lincoln Memorial. [long pause]
[The city, day. Joe and Cartman are in an NSA vehicle pursuing this lead. Here's the NSA as police force.]
CARTMAN
["Four sixteen pm. The chief asked me to join him as he went to question the possible suspects. I agreed to go along. Hopefully, the NSA has no idea of my secret intentions." The chief looks at him. "lol." The chief focuses on the road again. Moments later they stop in front of a house and get out of the car. The chief knocks on the door and a hippie answers it.]
HIPPIE
Well well, the NSA. I should've known.
JOE
We wanna talk to you about some tweets you've been tweeting.
HIPPIE
Hey man, I was just blowin' smoke. Say, what right does the government have reading my private e-mails anyway?! Haven't you squares heard of the Constitution?
JOE
Yeah, we've heard of that. We've also heard of the Declaration of Independence. See, there's a lot of people out there who think like you, people who think their government doesn't have the right to go around poking their noses in the e-mails of its citizens. That is, until a plane flies into a couple of towers and a little girl loses her life. You wanna live in the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave, but the brave can't be free if the land isn't home, and that land won't be home so long as folks out there wanna take that American flag and shove it so far up your anus that you crap stars and stripes for a week, and as you're sittin' there on the toilet with the Star-Spangled Montezuma's Revenge there's one thing I can guarantee you.
HIPPIE
Yeah? What's that?
JOE
You won't care who's checkin' your Twitter account then. [holds up a hard copy of the delivery man's tweets.]
HIPPIE
...I never thought of it that way.
ALEC BALDWIN
["I fucked Jack Lemmon's makeup girl in a Port-A-Potty. Woops." The chief notices the lights on Cartman's Shitter device but doesn't say anything.]
[Craig's house, day. He's on the sofa watching Terrance and Phillip on TV.]
TERRANCE
Hey Phillip! Pull my finger! [the doorbell rings and he gets up to answer it] Aaaahahahaha. [he opens the door and sees Butters with the two Polynesian women]
BUTTERS
Hello, Craig. How would you like to know the Truth?
CRAIG
...The truth about what?
BUTTERS
We're just goin' through the neighborhood an' seein' if you've accepted the government into your heart.
CRAIG
...Aahhhh, no, I don't think so.
PAMPHLETEER
My colleague and I, we went to saaah experience at DMV. We went to DMV, we admit all our shortcomings an sins and uh make a tital wave of peace and serenity with the truth stored inside our heart.
CRAIG
...Okay. [next scene, all four of them are on the sofa.]
BUTTERS
You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?
CRAIG
Aaaaaaaaaaaahh, no.
BUTTERS
Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There's even some quotes from President Obama. [hands him a booklet] Could you read this part out lout?
CRAIG
[slowly reading] Your local DMV is funded by your tax dollars to be efficient and proficient.
BUTTERS
Yeah. Whattaya think President Obama means when he says that?
CRAIG
I have no idea.
BUTTERS
Well, we believe that he means the government loves you, and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart.
PAMPHLETEER
Yes sir. [the boys look at her] See, i used to be like you. I go around sending them nasty e-mails and a nasty texts, puttin' nasty picture on my nasty Facebook. But then I realized, all these things, they live forever, because the government keep a file on us. So all that live forever up in what they call the Clou'. It's a government term. If they could put a file in the Clou', then I wanna make sure I come clean about the bad ones and maybe get those things off my record off the Clou'. Because we all live forever in the Clou'.
BUTTERS
Uh huh. [looks at Craig] Did you follow all that, Craig? [his eyes dart around] Uh, I don't think I really followed all that.
[N.S.A. Headquarters, Maryland, day. Back at the main office, Cartman now has his own desk as an NSA detective.]
CARTMAN
["I've done it. I've infiltrated the NSA, and gained their trust." A shot of Alec Baldwin and his date at a buffet restaurant. The camera pans across until it reaches the couple. "So far, I've not ascertained how they were able to keep track of everyone in the country, but I'm close. Very close. I just hope that I'm not found out as a whistleblower before I'm able to expose their entire operation."]
DATE
What is that voice?
ALEC BALDWIN
Some little faggot in my head.
CARTMAN
Hey, so um, as I'm going through people's e-mails and phone calls, um, how do I know which people to start with?
DETECTIVE 3
Pretty simple. Everyone has a file. People who have a status of "threat", "possible threat", or "person of interest" are the ones we really wanna look at.
DETECTIVE 4
The more we pay attention to them, the bigger their file becomes.
CARTMAN
Really? How big is my file?
DETECTIVE 4
Huh?
CARTMAN
Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time.
DETECTIVE 3
Jarvis, what have we got on an "Eric Cartman"? Any files on Eric Cartman.
JARVIS
Ohhh yeah, we tracked him for a little bit, but Central Computer designated his status as "fat and unimportant."
CARTMAN
Uhh trust me, he's not fat and unimportant. I think we need to change his status to "ripped and sweet." [no one listens. He stands up on his desk] 'Scuse me. Excuse me! There's a very important threat to national security! We need to change Eric Cartman's status!
[Colorado Department of Motor Vehicles, day. Officer Barbrady stands at the counter holding his hat in his right hand...]
BARBRADY
And that's when I masturbated to Game of Thrones. I know it was wrong to masturbate, and I know it was especially wrong to masturbate while on duty.
CLERK 2
What the? [looks over his left shoulder] Why do these people keep coming here?
BARBRADY
But I am done forever with Game of Thrones. Forever
CLERK 2
Next, please! [ding]
BARBRADY
Thank you. [puts on his hat and walks away. Nearby is a little group Butters has been forming, and Barbrady stops by]
GROUP
[clapping] Yaaaaaay.
BUTTERS
Congratulations, Brother! How do you feel?
BARBRADY
I, I feel really good.
GROUP
[clapping] Heehhhhhhhah. [in the waiting area, a woman peeks over a man's shoulder to see what's going on]
CUSTOMER
Wow, those people over there seem like they're havin' fun. [Barbrady hugs the colleague and shakes the pamphleteer's hand]
BUTTERS
[takes a few steps away from the group] I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than at the DMV with all you wonderful people. Now let's all pledge Allegiance. [the group turns to face the flag] I pledge allegiance.
GROUP
To the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [while the group recites the Pledge, the following takes place]
LARRY
[walks in and crosses the room towards the group] What the hell is going on here?! This is the DMV! There will be no joy here!
CLERK 3
Uh people keep showing up and telling us what they did wrong.
CUSTOMER 2
Hey, I'm just trying to renew my license. How much longer do I gotta wait? [the group finishes the Pledge]
LARRY
[faces the customer and points at him] Shut up! Sit there and wait, and no cell phones or other things that pass time joyously! I'll put a stop to this! [walks to the group]
[N.S.A. Headquarters, Maryland, day. Cartman pleads his case.]
CARTMAN
Look, I am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake! Eric Cartman is the NSA's worst nightmare!
CHIEF JOE
Not according to the Central Computer.
CARTMAN
The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status!
CHIEF JOE
Sorry, [stands and moves away from his desk] but if Central Computer says he is not a threat, then we can't do anything. [moves through the office]
CARTMAN
[runsn to catch up with the chief] Can't do anything?? You're the NSA!
CHIEF JOE
There's 300 million people out there. How do you think we're able to keep track of every single person in the country? How do you think we're able to really know who's doing what?[they reach a pair of thick steel doors]
CARTMAN
I don't know.
CHIEF JOE
Alright, I'll show you. But this is very top security stuff, because if people knew how we did it, then everyone would do it. Then our enemies would do it. We can't let our enemies get their hands on this.
CARTMAN
Get their hands on what? [the chief presses some keys on the keypad next to the doors, and the doors open] Dude... [Santa is shown suspended in midair by a harness. Cables go from Santa to the surrounding wall of computers, and a massive one is attached to his privates. Several techs stand on a platform circling the room, looking at some of the many computers present]
CHIEF JOE
This is how we know who's a threat and who's not. How we know who's sleeping and who's awake. [Cartman runs away from the entrance, whips out a whistle and starts blowing it] How we know that...
CARTMAN
You think I'm fat and unimportant now?! [rips off his fake mustache] I AM Eric Cartman! And I've got news for you! This is all being broadcast LIVE on my Twitter Zeppelin, and on Alec Baldwin's new television show, via Shitter!
[Alec Baldwin's new show]
ALEC BALDWIN
Hi everybody, and welcome to my new show on MSNBC, "Free Pass with Alec Baldwin"
CARTMAN
["Your secret is out, NSA! And now that everyone knows what you're doing to Santa you can kiss your program goodbye!"]
[At NSA Headquarters.]
CARTMAN
You should have taken me out when you had the chance. Now everyone knows the truth! And everyone's gonna think I'm superkewl!
[Cartman's house, evening. Cartman is weeping in his room at his computer when Liane walks in]
LIANE
Eric, honey, what's the matter?
CARTMAN
[through his tears] It didn't work, Mom! I infiltrated the NSA, and I was a whistleblower and I thought everyone would be super-pissed off at what exposed about the government, but nobody cared! Nobody cares if the government is listening in on everything! Nobody cares if Santa Claus is hooked up to a big horrible machiiiine!
LIANE
I know that the NSA is torturing Santa, sweetie. But they're keeping us safe.
CARTMAN
Well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse?! [cries hard now]
LIANE
Honey, it's okay.
CARTMAN
It's not gonna be okay because now I'm a whistleblower, and against my conscience I'm gonna have to hide out in Russiaaaa! [weeps some more]
LIANE
No, you don't have to fly to Russia, hon.
CARTMAN
I do toooo!
LIANE
No, it will be fine. How about I make you some hot tea with lemon and codeine?
CARTMAN
Okaaay. [she walks out and Cartman calms down] I just want hot tea and codeine, no lemon.
LIANE
Okay, hon.
[Moments later the front door bell rings and Cartman goes to answer it in his bath robe, with cup of tea in hand. He opens the door and Butters is at the landing alone.]
BUTTERS
Hello. How would you like to know the Truth?
CARTMAN
...The fuck are you talking about, Butters?
BUTTERS
It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart.
CARTMAN
[walks away, then stops] It's too late for me, Butters. I have to go to Russia and live with the Commie dwarfs.
BUTTERS
[steps in and approaches Cartman] It's never too late. There's a place where you can start over. [gives him a DMV booklet]
CARTMAN
What's this?
BUTTERS
Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes.
CARTMAN
I can be forgiven?
BUTTERS
Yes.
CARTMAN
For everything bad I've ever done?
BUTTERS
Yes!
CARTMAN
And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something wrong and admit it and I'm forgiven again?
BUTTERS
That's right.
CARTMAN
[wipes his forhead and sniffs] Thta's pretty kewl.
[The DMV, day. Butters' group is back, and bigger than last time. Carl Weathers is a new member, Craig is a new member, and now someone else is joining. There's an organ playing, giving this a Revival feel. Everyone in the group is moving and clapping.]
BUTTERS
We've got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?!
CARTMAN
I do, I love my country!
BUTTERS
Do you pledge allegiance to the Flag?!
CARTMAN
I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance!
BUTTERS
Hallelujah!
GROUP
Yaaaaay!
PAUL
Do you want us to kick them out of here, Lar?
LARRY
No... No, leave them alone. It's a nice change to see people happy here at the DMV. [Organ music fades out] Perhaps we here at the DMV can start changing as well. Perhaps instead of treating people badly we can offer them comfort and hope. Why, the DMV can be a place where people come to get things off their chests. Confess, yes, but also be told that they're worth something in this world! And then, DMVs everywhere can become a place where people feel safe. And when they do something wrong we can offer forgiveness! Don't you see what this could lead to? Don't you see what we could become??

NEWS ANCHOR
The DMV was shut down today after rampant allegations of sex with young boys. [in the picture over his shoulder are a bunch of DMV workers in handcuffs being led away by police. Four boys stand together nearby, naked and crying, with their hands over their privates.] The heads of the DMV were arrested and the director stated, quote: Hey, it came with the territory. With the DMV shut down, Americans have been asked to confess all wrongdoings at their nearest post office. [an arm appears and gives the anchorman a sheet of paper, then retracts] We've just received word that the US Postal service has been shut down due to rampant allegations of sex with young boys. It now appears that the only people who can be trusted with confessions and guidance is your local news station. WMZ News will be back in... a young boy.

script:Informative Murder Porn

[South Park Elementary, day, Mr. Garrison's classroom. Wendy is presenting her oral report.]
WENDY
[reading from her yellow index cards] Unless we come together as a country and realize that refugees from Syria should be considered in need-
CARTMAN
Boooo! [Wendy looks up and gets angry] Boo, Wendy! Boo, Wendy Testaburger, Boo!
WENDY
[returns to her report] Refugees from Syria should be considered in need of international protection.
CARTMAN
Boo, Wendy, Boooooo! Boo Wendy.
WENDY
[returns to her report, with her voice clearly getting more annoyed and explicit] The vast majority of refugees from Syria are likely to meet refugee status criteria and issued benefits from-
CARTMAN
Boooo, Wendy Testaburger, Boooooo! [Wendy lowers her report down to her sidee-] Boo Wendy! Liar!
WENDY
Instead of booing my opinion, why don't you make a constructive argument?!
CARTMAN
I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo.
WENDY
Mr. Garrison, can you do something about this, please? [no reaction - he's rather engrossed in the book he's reading] Mr. Garrison?!
MR. GARRISON
[startled] Huh? Oh, oh, Wendy, uhhh, very nicely done. Thank you. Okay, next report, [Wendy looks betrayed] let's have uh, Peter Mullen.
WENDY
[extremely annoyed, goes to her seat] Ugh, Jesus! [Peter walks up and takes her place]
PETER
My report is on the vile and despicable trash that our parents are watching on television. Fellow students: there is a plague of smut on our cable boxes! [whips out a remote control box and presses a button. A projector screen comes down behind him] Shows that feature reenactments of unsolved crimes and spousal homicide! [the screen stops] I'm talking of course about [presses another button and the first image comes up. It's an Investigation Discovery screenshot] murder porn!
BUTTERS
Murder porn?
CARTMAN
That's more like it.
PETER
According to the Nielsen ratings, viewership in shows like "Cold Case Files," "Dateline: Murder," and "Deadly Affairs" is skyrocketing amongst married couples. The increased viewership has brought about a whole new slew of shows that use graphic sex, and innuendo, to make spousal murder more titillating. Shows like "Southern Fried Homicide," "Sinful Secrets," "On The Case with Paula Zahn." And it's all smut and it's garbage and it's [throws down his index cards] trash! [a few seconds later he clears his throat and gathers up his index cards] Your parents are watching this stuff! Go home and ask them! And as we ask them we must also ask ourselves, "If they're obsessed with this stuff, then how long? How long before one of our daddies dresses up in lingerie and bashes Mommy's head in with a brick?" [the class is speechless with mouths open. Only Cartman claps]
[Stan's house, day. Stan comes home from school and walks up the stairs to his room when he hears noises coming out of his parents' room. Sharon is surely enjoying it. Stan, still wearing his backpack, walks up to the bedroom door and listens in. He knocks on the door]
RANDY
Oh crap, who could that be-?! Oh it's, it's, probably fuckin' Stan! Ah, hang on a second bud. [some low rumbles are heard] Come on in. [Stan goes in. Randy is in his most relaxed pose in bed] Oh hey Stan, what's up? [Stan looks at the TV screen to his right]
[TV screen.]
NARRATOR
His wife is having sex with the neighbor. [a couple going at it in bed] And when her husband comes home, [the husband opens the bedroom door, the couple notices and stops.] he wants more than just a divorce. [the husband raises his gun and kills the boyfriend, than the wife. Sharon picks up the remote and switches channels]
STAN
You guys are watchin' murder porn?
RANDY
...Murder porn? Stan, this is just an investigative crime show.
SHARON
Uh adults like documentaries.
RANDY
Yes Stan, these are based on real things. This is like news. It's informative. Parents like informative stuff.
STAN
Okaaay. [turns around and walks out. Sharon switches back to the show]
RANDY
Oh we missed the murder! Did he cut them up?!
[Later that night, in his room, Stan is sleeping. His phone rings and he picks up.]
STAN
What's up dude?
CARTMAN
Dude, do you know Aaron Hagen?
STAN
Uh, yeah, the first grader?
CARTMAN
You should come down to his house. His dad just killed his mom.
[Back in Stan's room. Stan looks shocked at what Cartman said through the phone.]
STAN
What?!
[Aaron's house crime scene. Police and ambulance are there, along with a news crew. Aaron is on the front lawn crying, and Stan shows up. The dead mom, who has a large knife jabbed into her head through her right eye, is wheeled out by the paramedics. As they pass by Aaron, he sees his mom's dead body and screams in sheer terror.]
SERGEANT YATES
Hey that kid should not be seeing this! [Aaron is still crying in despair, while an officer drops a purple blanket over him so he can't see]
STAN
What happened?
MR. HAGEN
You're making a mistake! [he is naked and covered with blood, two officers haul him towards a police cruiser, while he struggles] Let me go! It wasn't me, I tell ya! A burglar broke in! He was black! He's the one who stabbed that nagging bitch in her fat face! He was blaaack! [the officers put him in and close the back door. The boys don't believe what they've just seen]
[South Park County Community Center, day. A bunch of bicycles cover the parking area and kids can be heard inside. Kyle tries to hold court]
KYLE
Guys, guys, I know we're all concerned, but we have to work together!
RED
How is this stuff allowed to stay on the air?!
CLYDE
The police found hours and hours of murder porn on the Hagens' DVR. What more proof do we need?!
BUTTERS
I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know what they told me?! They told me if I didn't want my parents watchin', then I should spend more time with them! Like it's my fault!
WENDY
This is the result of a broken society in which profits come before morals!
CARTMAN
Boooooooooo. Boooo Wendy Testaburger! Boo!
KYLE
Look everybody, I know we all feel our hands are tied, but the fact is, we can do something about this. There's an app which can actually allow kids to block things that their parents watch on television. And it is password-protected with a security code that only a child would know.
[The Marsh house, night. The Marshes are in bed watching ID.]
NARRATOR
Tonight at 10, it's a tale of lust, seduction, and murder, on Sexy Betrayals. [a man and woman kiss. He holds a wedding ring in one hand, and a knife in the other] Then at 7, some like their murder with a side of sexy biscuits, [a couple kisses on the front porch, then the girlfriend shoots her man point blank in the forehead, smiling] on Southern Fried Homicide. But now, get ready for lust, betrayal and murder, [another couple. The girl stabs the guy through the left eye] on Hot Load Case Files. [a woman is ready to unload on her man and the two other women he's in bed with]
RANDY
Oh yeah! [he and Sharon strip down] Three of the best shows in a row!
SHARON
Is the lube over there?
RANDY
Yeah, I got lube right here.
SHARON
Well get over here, big guy.
RANDY
Yeah-hah! [he moves over to her and they start making out. He leaves the lube near the edge of the bed. A three-tone chime is heard. Randy looks over and reads the screen]
[The screen reads: "CONTENT BLOCKED. To unlock, answer the security question: 'How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?']
RANDY
What the? [sits up. The lube falls off the bed] What the hell? [tries to change channels, but they all say the same thing. Moments later he's on the phone with his cable service.] Yeah, hi, uhh, we aren't getting our informative murder porn. No, no, none of our channels that have informative murder porn appear to be working. Yeah, the screen just says "How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?" Uhhh yes, we do have children. A what? A parental lock?
[Stan's room, night. His door is open. Randy walks into view, wearing only slippers, but stays in the hallway. Because he's naked, he's covering his privates]
RANDY
Stan. Stan! [Stan wakes up, his eyes half-closed] How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?
STAN
[miffed] What?
RANDY
What is Minecraft and how do you tame a horse in it?!
STAN
You guys don't need to be watching that stuff. [closes his eyes]
RANDY
Oh come on! You can't block your parents from watching informative murder porn! What? You, you think if we watch shows about married people killing each other all the time we're gonna go out and do it?! That's stupid! [thinking a bit. Stan opens his eyes] I'm not gonna go out and kill your mom just because I watch Investigate Discovery, Stan! It'd be impossible to clear away all the DNA evidence anyway! Even if I hired someone else to kill her, I'd have to kill that person too, because 96% of the time that person eventually tells the truth! I thought this through a lot! [Stan closes his eyes again] Stan? [Stan opens his eyes] You're a lousy kid! I wish Jaden Smith was my son! [goes back to his room. Stan rolls his eyes and goes back to sleep]
[Get Cable offices, day. Inside, in the waiting area, is a group of angry, locked-out adults, including Gerald, Stuart, Stephen and Linda, and Mrs. Tweak.]
STEPHEN
Who do out children think they are?! Blocking our TV content?!
MRS. TWEAK
How are they able to do this with their smartphones?
RANDY
It's all right. Our kids think they've outsmarted us, but we're the ones who pay the cable company! [Stuart returns from a meeting with the cable company] What'd they say? Can they remove the parental lock?
STUART
No, they just did their usual cable-company runaround.
RANDY
What?! We'll see about this! [storms into the office] Excuse me, our content is being blocked and we need it now!
CABLE GUY
I'm sorry sir. If you need it now, perhaps you should switch to another cable company. [tauntingly] Ohhh there's not another cable company, is there? [begins to rub his nipples in circles] Ohhh, that's right, we're the only one in town.
RANDY
Look, if our kids can block content, then you must be able to block them!
CABLE GUY
As we told the others, sir, we can fix it. We just need to send a technician out to your house to change out your cable box.
RANDY
[relieved somewhat] Oh. Well okay, great.
CABLE GUY
[begins to process the request on his computer] We'll just need to find a window of time you can be home... How about between the hours of 6 am and 3 pm all of November?
RANDY
NO, I can't wait around my house from 6 am to 3 pm all of November!
CABLE GUY
[begins to taunt again] Oh, you can't? [begins rubbing his nipples through his shirt] Jeez that's too bad. You need to be home for the technician. Have you thought of switching to DirecTV?
RANDY
I can't afford DirecTV.
CABLE GUY
Oh, you can't? [rips off some patches covering his nipples off his shirt and begins rubbing his nipples directly] Jeez, that's terrible. Then I guess you just have to work within our time windows. [squeezes his nipples. Randy just glares at him and walks out]
STEPHEN
Well? Any luck?
RANDY
No, just the usual cable-company stuff.
MRS. TWEAK
Oh well, guess we'll just have to live without our informative crime drama.
STEPHEN
No, screw that! Can't we just learn this Minecraft game so we can get around our kids' parental lock?
RANDY
I've tried! It's not like other video games. I really don't get it. It was all retro and like Legos, but, then a bunch of kids online called me a griefer and kicked me off.
STEPHEN
We can learn, Randy. There's talk of a child. Word is he will teach Minecraft to anybody for the right price.
[In front of a kid's house, day. Randy knocks on the door. A boy holding a lollipop answers the door.]
BOY
Hello?
RANDY
Hi. Corey Lanskin?
COREY
Yes?
RANDY
We heard that... you're willing to teach Minecraft to adults?
COREY
Fuck off! [shuts the door on Randy. The adults are stunned and look at each other. Randy knocks on the door again, twice. Corey answers the door again, still suspicious]
RANDY
Look, we were told that you were available for hire and we're desperate!
COREY
You was told wrong, mistuh! I'm just a simple kid with a simple passion for simple things!
RANDY
We have a hundred ounces of silver. [Stuart leans to his left a bit and shows off a box]
COREY
[looks right, then left, and talks in a serious British accent] Wipe your feet and turn off your cell phones. [goes inside. Randy looks back at the other adults, then wipes his shoes off on the welcome mat and goes in. The other adults wipe their shoes off and go on in.]
[Corey's basement, moments later. He's got two long tables in there, with three computers on each table, all loaded up and ready for Minecraft training.]
COREY
[pacing back and forth between the tables explaining the game] Next we're going to select an empty world. Selecting an empty world will begin with you being dropped onto a beach. Now you're free to roam around and start punching trees!
GERALD
Punching trees?
RANDY
Why, why would we punch trees?
COREY
Just use your fucking brain! How do you get wood? [Randy isn't sure] 'Ow do you get wood?!
RANDY
[nervously] Watching informative murder porn?
COREY
NOO NOO, in this Minecraft forest, how do you get wood?!
RANDY
Puh, punching trees?
COREY
Riiight. You punch the trees to get the wood, you get the wood to build a cabin.
RANDY
Oh, I see. So when does the game start?
COREY
You are playing the game; this is the game!
RANDY
...I don't get it.
COREY
That's because you're thinkin' like a dad. Minecraft, it don't got no winner. It don't got no objective. You just fuckin' build an' shit. And seein' if other things can come and knock it down. Now, let's click on the inventory, and let's filter through the skin!
RANDY
Yes ah, I'm getting it now.
GERALD
You are?
RANDY
No.
[The Marsh house, night. Sharon is in bed looking bored.]
SHARON
Randy, it's getting late. Let's just go to sleep.
RANDY
[at his computer playing away] I almost got it, Sharon. I found out where the horse is; now I just gotta figure out how to tame one.
SHARON
I'm really not in the mood now anyway.
RANDY
Sharon, I miss being intimate with you! Everything was so passionate and then it just... dropped off. I feel like we're losing our bond.
SHARON
We don't have to have sex for our relationship to be good.
RANDY
No, I know, but it's like we're just good friends. A marriage has to be more than that! A marriage has to include fulfillment of fantasy and desire sometimes. Magma cube? What the hell is a magma cube?
SHARON
[settling in] Well I'm going to sleep, Randy.
RANDY
Okay, I'll wake you up if we get our murder porn back.
[South Park Elementary, hallways, day. Stan and Kyle walk down the hall]
JIMMY
There he is. Hey Kyle! [arrives with Craig and Tweek] The parental lock isn't working. Our parents are still watching murder porn.
KYLE
What? How do you know?
TWEEK
I caught my parents over at Bebe's house watching Seductive Homicides. But Bebe got the lock from the cable company!
CRAIG
It's true. I walked in on my parents watching Marital Murder Mayhem. They broke the parental lock somehow.
STAN
That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?
CARTMAN
You guys? [Stan and Kyle turn to face him. He's at the end of the hall] You guys, you'd better get over here.
STAN
What?
CARTMAN
Butters' dad killed his mom. [Stan and Kyle look at each other in disbelief]
[Around the corner, down another hall. Butters is sitting on the floor crying. Around him are Bebe, Wendy, Kenny consoling him, and Cartman. Stan, Kyle, Craig, Tweek, and Jimmy arrive and a few other kids gather around]
STAN
Butters, what happened?
BUTTERS
[through his tears] I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled "Hey, watch out for the Creepers!" but she fell!
KYLE
Wait... wait, you mean in Minecraft?
BUTTERS
Yeah. And then my dad just went berserk and came over and picked me up and threw me down a well! [Mr. Mackey happens along] I was trapped down there all night!
MR. MACKEY
Butters, your dad threw you down a well?
STAN
In Minecraft.
MR. MACKEY
Well what the hell is that?
BUTTERS
I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!
KYLE
[turns left] That's it. [walks a bit] That's how our parents broke the passcode. I never thought anyone would stoop so low!
STAN
Whattaya mean?
KYLE
Someone is teaching our parents Minecraft. [dramatic flourish]
[The Marsh house, dawn. Two officers knock on his door. He answers it in his bathrobe]
RANDY
Yes?
OFFICER 1
Hello sir, had a little incident last night, wondering if you saw or heard anything?
RANDY
No, what happened?
OFFICER 1
Well, someone broke into your next door neighbor's back yard and they... dug up a bunch of holes and punched his trees.
RANDY
Punched his trees, huh?
OFFICER 1
Yes sir. Then we got a house across the street where someone dug up the yard and... built a cabin.
RANDY
Huh. [puts his hands on his hips] That's weird.
OFFICER 1
What were you doing last night?
RANDY
I was just playing Mi- mmmmuh... my banjo.
OFFICER 2
I play the banjo too.
OFFICER 1
Well, thanks for your time sir. You might wanna keep the lights on in your yard tonight in case someone tries to build a cabin on it as well.
RANDY
Will do, officer. Will... do... [the officers turn and leave]
[South Park County Community Center, day. The kids are back inside, clamoring. Kyle is at the podium, and Stan stands next to him]
KYLE
Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here!
CARTMAN
Concerned?! Thanks to you and your stupid app, parents are still watching murder porn, and now they're screwing up Minecraft too! [the kids clamor for a few seconds]
CRAIG
I spent three hours last night trying to get Tweek's parents to stop griefing my castle! When I finally got away from them, I found they had taken all my dandelions!
CLYDE
Why did we agree to that stupid app?!
KYLE
You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn!
CARTMAN
And why was that?! Because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom! For all we know, that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it!
WENDY
I have to agree with Cartman. Maybe we overreacted when our parents-
CARTMAN
Boooooo! Boo Wendy, boooo.
STAN
It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see. [police sirens are heard]
OFFICER 3
All right, that's enough. Come on out and there won't be any trouble. [the kids pour out of the rec center and into some bright spotlights.] Give it up, Stotch. You've nowhere to run.
BUTTERS
Huh?
STEPHEN
I'll never give up! [the kids look up, and the next camera shows a makeshift castle built over the rec center, made of blocks of wood with pictures all over them] I don't even remember doing this! Just leave me alone!
RANDY
[steps forward carrying a large hammer] Huhuh. Oh nice one, Stotch! Your castle fuckin' sucks!
STEPHEN
Aw, go to hell, you griefer!
CARTMAN
Alright, we've gotta do something.
[Corey's house, day. Kyle knocks on Corey's door. Stan, Cartman and Kenny are with him.]
COREY
[in a trembling voice] Hello?
KYLE
Corey Lanskin?
COREY
Eh yes?
KYLE
We heard that you might be teaching Minecraft to adults.
COREY
[sucks on his lollipop] Whaaa? What's a, what's a "Minequaf"?
STAN
Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death!
COREY
Oh no, please don't be angry. My mommy's always angry. "Get back in the meat locker!" "Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!" But she loves me, right? Mommy loves me?
KYLE
Uh alright, sorry kid. Gue- guess we have the wrong house.
COREY
Ohhhkay. [goes back inside] Bye. [closes the door. The boys turn around and leave, but Cartman stops on the walkway. A few seconds later the other three boys return]
STAN
What, dude?
CARTMAN
Something he said. Did you hear him? He said "Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!"
STAN
So?
CARTMAN
You know, if I'd been caught lying about something, that's exactly what I would have said.
[Meanwhile, in Corey's basement, new players at the the computers. Only four of them this time, including Craig's parents and Clyde's father.]
COREY
Now that you've built a workbench it's time to build somethin' that will take care of all those fuckin' sheep! [the boys have found the basement and come down the stairs] Just stop thinkin' with your grown-up brains and start usin' your-
STAN
Aha! [the boys reach the floor]
COREY
Oh shit! [the adults quickly leave]
KENNY
(I knew you're up to something!)
CARTMAN
Son of a bitch! [grabs Corey by the collar] Don't you think there are enough griefers in the world without our parents being shown this stuff?!
COREY
Kids gotta find some way to make a livin', don't 'e?
STAN
You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows!
COREY
What? You mean like Investigation Discovery?
KYLE
So you know it.
COREY
Yeah, I've seen that stuff. [Cartman releases him] "'Oo The Bleep Did I Marry?", "True Crime with Aphrodite Jones". Real sick shit. Your parents watch that stuff?
KYLE
We put a stop to it, until YOU taught them Minecraft.
COREY
Your problem ain't with me, mates. Sure, one or two people might act out what they see in video games, but cable television? [takes out a cigarette and lighter and lights up the cigarette, then starts smoking.] People copy everything they see people do on cable. You're goin' about this all wrong. You wanna protect your family? You're gonna have to go fight the cable company.
[The cable company, day. The boys walk up to the cable guy]
CABLE GUY
Hey guys, can I help you?
KYLE
Hello. There are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families, and we want them removed, please.
CABLE GUY
[taunting] Ohhh, you don't want cable anymore?
STAN
No no, [whips out a list and reads it] just ID Network, A&E, Oxygen, and Oprah's network. All the ones with murder porn.
CABLE GUY
You don't like paying for all the channels? [begins rubbing his nipples through his shirt] Ohh, our company actually packages channels together.
STAN
Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want?
CABLE GUY
Oh I'm sorry. Our company doesn't work that way. [lowers his hands as if to look up something] You want me to give you the number of a different cable company that can- [goes back to rubbing his nipples] Oh wait, we're it, aren't we? [rips off the patches and rubs his nipples again] Dangit, I guess you have to deal with our packages.
KYLE
Can we talk to your supervisor please?!
CABLE GUY
Oh, sure. Hey David?
DAVID
[arrives] Hi, is there a problem here? [rips off the patches on his shirt and prepares to rub]
STAN
We want specific networks dropped from our cable.
DAVID
[taunting. Both men are now rubbing their nipples] Ohhh you have to pay for the bundle. You can't just pay for what you wanna watch. Darn it.
KYLE
You mean that we're forced to pay for the Oprah channel?
CABLE GUY
I guess if you don't wanna be [lowers his left hand from his nipple so that David starts rubbing it with his right hand. He in turn begins to rub David's right nipple with his left hand] forced to pay for Oprah, you're gonna have to shut off your cable altogether.
KYLE
Fine, [folds his arms over his chest] then we'll shut our cable off altogether!
DAVID
Hey Mitch? When can you get out to shut off some cable boxes?
MITCH
[at his office rubbing his nipples] Oh man, it's gonna be like three weeks. There's a whole plug I have to pull out; it's like four inches long.
DAVID
[now rubbing both of the cable guy's nipples, while the cable guy rubs his left nipple now] Three weeks, huh? Okay, is three weeks from now okay with you guys?
STAN
No, that's way too long!
CABLE GUY
Oh it is?
DAVID
Oh Jeez, that's terrible.
STAN
Goddammit, I just don't want my parents to murder each other! [the men stop rubbing] Can't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe? Look, ah I don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it, and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch. All we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them. Because cable makes is so convenient. Sure, if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they'd be bummed out, but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want. Is it?
DAVID
Say... say that last part again?
STAN
What?
DAVID
Well what was the last part you said?
STAN
I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want.
DAVID
Nono, the part about your parents not getting the channels easily?
STAN
I... said it would really bum them out.
DAVID
How... [he and the cable guy being to rub their nipples again] How much would it bum them out?
[A screen read "PLEASE STAND BY FOR AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE"]
ANNOUNCER
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by for an important message from the president of your local cable company.
PRESIDENT
Hello. In an effort to comfort the anguished cries or children everywhere, your local cable company has decided to drop all networks that sexualize spousal homicides from regular programming. Customers still wishing to view true-crime networks will now need to purchase a separate package [pulls back his coat and rips some patches off his dress shirt] which will require a technician to service your cable box every night from 2 to 3 am. and must include the purchase of 300 channels in Portuguese. We realize this may be an inconvenience to you, and we hope you will voice ALL your concerns to us, because at your local cable company the customer is always... our bitch.
[The Marsh breakfast nook, morning. Stan is doing some homework at the table. Randy is mad and isn't talking to anyone, and he has his arms crossed over his chest. Sharon is washing dishes]
RANDY
Jaden Smith lets his parents do whatever they want. You know what? The guys at work, they took a bet on who would win in a fight, you or Jaden Smith, and they all said Jaden Smith could kick your ass! He does movies and he can sing, and he's totally cool to his parents!
STAN
Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad.
RANDY
[gets up angrily from his chair] I wish I could! I wish I could live with Jaden Smith so I could be rich and I wouldn't have to live in a boring sexless marriage where all your mom and I do piss each other off! [Sharon stops washing the dishes and leaves the kitchen. Randy notices and follows her with his eyes] Oh crap.
[In the living room. Randy appears at the kitchen doorway]
RANDY
Sharon, I'm I'm sorry. [approaches her]
SHARON
No, you'r right, Randy. Without any sex we just seem to get madder and madder at each other.
RANDY
[puts his arms on her shoulders] No, no, you're right, Sharon. We don't need informative murder porn to find passion in our marriage. We just have to get the spark back. Let's go away somewhere, me and you! Somewhere exciting and beautiful where we can just focus on us.
[The world of Minecraft. A high cliff is shown, with a waterfall and mountain goats. At the foot of this cliff is a lake and a park. A fire pit is nearby, lit and roaring. Randy's Minecraft avatar shows up]
RANDY
Sharon? Heh, hey Sharon, are you here?
SHARON
I'm here, Randy.
RANDY
It's beautiful, isn't it? Come on ever here, I built us a fire. Look what I got you. [presents a gem]
SHARON
Diamonds. [takes them] They're beautiful
RANDY
Just thought I'd surprise you. And there's more where that came from.
SHARON
I've got a surprise for you too, Randy.
RANDY
Oh yeah? What's that? [Sharon whips out an axe and jams it into Randy's forehead] AAAGH! [Randy falls on his side and dies. In real life...] Sharon, what the effing fuck was that?![Sharon is smiling]
SHARON
Sorry. I couldn't resist.
RANDY
Jesus, you stuck a pick axe right in my skull!
SHARON
Oh I did! That felt really great.
RANDY
Felt great?
SHARON
[getting sensuous] Yeah...
RANDY
Well, hold on, stay by the lake. I wanna kill you now.
SHARON
Okay. [hours later, Stan comes home from school. He comes up the stairs wearing his backpack and hears his parents having a good time in their room. He walks over and goes in without knocking] Oh my God, you put that sword right through my face!
RANDY
That felt so good!
SHARON
My turn again.
RANDY
Okay, hang on.
SHARON
I've always thought about murdering you in your sleep. Can you go to the cabin and get in bed?
RANDY
Yeah, okay, I'm headin' there now.
SHARON
You lazy jerk! You never do anything around the house! [CHUNK!]
RANDY
OH! Ohoho, you bitch! [Stan looks down, then turns around and walks out] Ohohunh.
SHARON
Oh I love you, Randy.
RANDY
I love you too babe. [CHUNK! She got him again] OH!
End of Informative Murder Porn

synopsis:Cartman is deeply disturbed by a single person who he sees as a threat to all humanity. He races around the country to put an end to Patient Zero, the ticking time bomb that is Tolkien.

script:World War Zimmerman

[South Park Elementary, day, the school halls. Tolkien is at his locker switching books when Cartman comes 'round the corner]
CARTMAN
Hey Tolkien! [walks up to Tolkien] What's up, bro?
TOLKIEN
Nothing.
CARTMAN
"Nothin'" Me neither. Nothin's goin' on. Sucks. [sniffs] Everything good with you?
TOLKIEN
Yeah.
CARTMAN
Sweet. [Jimmy walks over and Cartman notices him] Hey Jimmy, what are you doin'?
JIMMY
Uh, I'm just gettin' ready for cla-
CARTMAN
Yeah, I'm just hangin' out with Tolkien. Did you know that if it wasn't for African-Americans, we wouldn't have Rock & Roll? So cool that we have a black President. [Jimmy walks away and Tolkien is done at his locker] About time. [Stan and Kyle stop to watch]
STAN
Is he doing it again?
KYLE
He's doing it a-gain.
CARTMAN
Dude, um, what are doing after school, Tolkien? You wanna, you wanna hang out? [Tolkien puts one last book in before closing his locker]
TOLKIEN
I uhhh, have band practice.
CARTMAN
God you are sooo cool. Alright bro, I'll catch you at recess. [makes a fist with his left hand and straightens out his arm toward Tolkien] Fist bump. Fist bump, bro. [Tolkien reluctantly makes a fist with his right hand and bumps Cartman's fist with it. He leaves, and Cartman moves on in a happy mood, stopping by Stan and Kyle]
STAN
Cartman, are you feeling alright?
CARTMAN
Yeah, I feel great. Why? [looks back] You think something's wrong? [moves on, not smiling]
[Herbert Garrison's classroom, later in the day. He's teaching about the French Revolution by way of Les Misérables, on the chalkboard.]
HERBERT GARRISON
Alright, now the French Revolution was basically started by a young man named Marius. [underlines the name], who only knew Jean Valjean as an older man, and uh- [Cartman interrupts him with a grunt] ...uh, the French government at the time was led by Javert, who was trying to-
CARTMAN
Mister! [Herbert Garrison turns around] No! Stop, Tolkien, stop! My brains! Stop eating my brains! Brad Pitt! [wakes up violently and looks bewildered. Tolkien is stunned, and Herbert Garrison, with his arms crossed, is not pleased.] Hey Tolkien. What's up, bro? [makes a fist and extends it towards Cartman] Fist bump? [Tolkien is unmoved and upset]
[Moments later, at Mr. Mackey's office...]
MR. MACKEY
Eric, somethin' is clearly wrong, m'kay, and it would be best to jus' get it out in the open.
CARTMAN
It's Tolkien. I think he's a ticking time bomb.
MR. MACKEY
And why do you think Tolkien is a tickin' time bomb?
CARTMAN
He's pissed off. Because of something that happened a long time ago but he won't forget.
MR. MACKEY
Do you think he blames you for somethin'?
CARTMAN
But it wasn't me, it wasn't my fault!
MR. MACKEY
Wull have you, thought about maybe writin' your feelin's down? In a poem? Uh- write a poem and give that to, g-give that to Tolkien?
CARTMAN
No, it's too gay. It would only make things worse.
MR. MACKEY
Well Eric, you need to do somethin' because you keep losing sleep. M'kay and sleep is very important to your success at school. M'kay?
CARTMAN
M'kay. Ahah-I'll be m'kay.
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, you sure? Because I'm here when you need me.
CARTMAN
M'kay.
[Cartman's room, night. He's having nightmares.]
CARTMAN
No, Tolkien! Leave Brad Pitt alone! Brad Pitt is fighting zombies! No ah Tolkien, Tolkien!
[Cartman's dream, morning. He voices all the characters in it. A family is seated in a breakfast nook in a kitchen. The girls are giggling.]
KARIN
[serving pancakes] Eat your breakfast, girls. [turns around to put the pan back on the stove]
RACHEL
Where's Daddy?
KARIN
You can eat without your father in the room. Now hurry. [the girls giggle and the older one notices someone]
RACHEL
Daddy!
GERRY
Good morning, girls. [walks in fully dressed, with a cup of coffee already in hand.] Save Daddy any pancakes? Look at that? Six A.M. and my family is already smiling. [Karin walks over and kisses him]
KARIN
How did I get such a perfect husband?
GERRY
How did I get such a beautiful wife?
RACHEL
I love you, Dad.
GERRY
I love you too, Princess. I love both of you, equally.
KARIN
Nothing can ever go wrong, so long as we all have each other.
[News report inside the dream. Gerry turns around to see the TV]
REPORTER
Today apparently will be the day! CNN has just received word that a verdict in the George Zimmerman trial is expected to come at any moment! Zimmerman is accused of shooting Trayvon Martin, and a jury will now decide his fate.
CONSTANCE
Daddy, who is Trayvon Martin?
GERRY
[turns around] Nobody. L-let's just get you girls to school.
[Cartman's dream, downtown, some minutes later. He's on a one-way street with a bunch of other cars all trying to move, but stuck. Somehow, the family remains chipper]
GERRY
Is it bigger than a bread box?
RACHEL
What's a bread box, Dad?
CONSTANCE
Heehee, Dad is so kewl.
KARIN
You can say that again.
GERRY
[getting worried] Why aren't we moving? What's gong on? [turns on the radio to 106.7 FM and Michael Bublé's "It's A Beautiful Day" comes out of the speakers. The family sways along to the beat. A news report comes on the air]
REPORTER
We interrupt this cool song for a news bulletin. A verdict has just been handed down in the case of George Zimmerman. In a shocking turn of events, the jury has found George Zimmerman not guilty!
GERRY
Oh my God. [fleeing white people run by his car, quickly overtaken by pissed-off black people]
REPORTER
Many African-Americans are outraged by the verdict, and they are most likely about to go totally nanners. [some of them surround the car. One of them punches a window and cracks it, a second cracks the passenger window with his head, a third crawls up on the hood and breaks the windshield with his head, sticking his head inside the car]
GERRY
AAAAAH!
PROTESTER
Fuck you, Brad Pitt!
GERRY
Let's bail! [steps on the gas and runs over a protester, ripping him to shreds. His car runs into another car and the protester on his hood flies off.] Everyone get out of the car! Go! [the family gets out and runs through the rioting crowd. They climb up a fire escape and onto the roof of a building, then look down over the riot. What they see is amazing: African-Americans converge and climb the side of the building in a great mass of humanity. Some of them fall back towards the street, but the mass gets closer and closer to the roof] Oh my god RUN! [they turn left and come face to face with... Tolkien] WAAH! Tolkien. No, Tolkien, we had nothing to do with this. I know you're pissed off, but but be reasonable!
TOLKIEN
Fuck you, Brad Pitt!
GERRY
No! Nonono! [Tolkien lunges at him] Nooo! [Cartman wakes up, touches himself to make sure he's there, and chuckles nervously]
[South Park Elementary, day, the school halls. Tolkien is at his locker switching books when Cartman comes 'round the corner. This time, he looks beat and walks slowly. He sees Tolkien and walks towards him. He didn't get much sleep, and he sounds it]
CARTMAN
Hey Tolkien? How are you doing?
TOLKIEN
I'm good.
CARTMAN
That's awesome. I'm so stoked that we're best friends. [puts his left fist forward] Fist bump. [leans to his left a little] Fist bump. [Tolkien closes his locker and hurries away]
[Mr. Garrison's classroom, later in the day. Cartman is having nightmares again.]
CARTMAN
No! My wife, Tolkien! Tolkien, that's my wife!
TOLKIEN
Okay, really?
CARTMAN
No Tolkien! Stop beating my daughter! NOOO! [wakes up]
[Mr. Mackey's office, some minutes later.]
MR. MACKEY
Now Eric, whatever it is you and Tolkien are going through, you need to talk through it, m'kay? The problems you two are havin' have become a distraction for everybody else. Agreed?
CARTMAN
Agreed.
MR. MACKEY
Okay. Tolkien, come on in, please. [the door opens and Tolkien walks in, closing it behind him. Tolkien takes a seat next to Cartman]
CARTMAN
Hoh boy, here we go.
MR. MACKEY
Tolkien, I've been talkin' with Eric and he's really upset that you two aren't gettin' along. You have some things you wanna say, Eric?
CARTMAN
[after a few seconds] Tolkien, I wasn't on that jury. Okay?
TOLKIEN
...What jury?
CARTMAN
This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me.
MR. MACKEY
Okay Tolkien, what are your feelings about that?
TOLKIEN
[looks at Eric for a few seconds, then answers] I don't know what to say.
CARTMAN
I wrote a poem. Is it okay if I read my poem? [pulls out his poem and begins] It's called "I Was Not The Bullet." [clears his throat]
I was not the bullet. I was not the gun.
I was not the juror that set the shooter free.
I was not the trigger. I was not the hate.
Nor was I the judge, but still, you judge me?
I was not the black family mourning for the dead.
"Oooo, somebody shot our children. Lordy, what we do now?"
I was not the verdict.
TOLKIEN
This isn't a poem. It doesn't even rhyme.
CARTMAN
It's going to rhyme, Tolkien, just hold on.
I was not the shooter. I was not the gun.
So Tolkien, you should be cool while we're all here at school.
[folds his poem up and puts it away.]
TOLKIEN
Can I go back to class now?
MR. MACKEY
Eric, do you feel better about all this?
CARTMAN
Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here.
MR. MACKEY
Okay, thanks Tolkien. [Tolkien gets up and leaves the office]
CARTMAN
It's gonna be okay. I think we're all safe now.
[South Park Elementary, day, the gym. The students are assembled there. The cheerleaders take the court. Among them is Lorraine, who has previously been mocked for her clothes]
CHEERLEADERS
We are Cows, proud and true! Come on, South Park, moo moo moo! Goooo Cows!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Ooookay, thank you, cheerleaders. That was very nice. Ahhh, next we have a student who would like to perform an original rap song, [Nicole sits down next to Tolkien] based on his award-winning poem, "I Was Not The Bullet," with backup music by Butters Stotch. [Butters walks up, takes the mic, and starts beatboxing. Cartman walks up and starts rapping]
CARTMAN (BUTTERS)
Black or white, it's alright. Black or white, let's not fight.
I was not the bullet. I was not the gun.
I was not the jury, so don't blame me, son!
James my man was wrong (It's not our fault). James my man was wrong (It's not Eric's fault).
Black or white, it's alright. Black or white, let's not fight.

White people say Ho-oh!
THE KIDS
Ho-oh.
CARTMAN
Black people say He-ey! [Tolkien and Nicole stay quiet] Cool. White people say Ho ho! [Tolkien and Nicole begin to get mad]
THE KIDS
Ho ho!
CARTMAN
Black people say Hey hey hey! [no reply] Uh oh, I think the white people are winning! White people got you beat, black people; you'd better represent! Let me hear you say "I don't blame the white people. No no no!"
TOLKIEN
[stands up in defiance] Alright, that's enough! [Butters stops and looks, then gets dismayed] You think I should feel bad for you because of the Trayvon Martin verdict?!
CARTMAN
Tolkien, calm down.
TOLKIEN
What the hell is wrong with you?! Why are you all here listening to this?!
CARTMAN
Oh God here it comes! Get down everybody! Get down now! [throws his mic down and runs off]
[The neighborhood. Cartman runs into view, rounds the corner and runs towards home]
CARTMAN
Clear the streets! Everyone clear the streets! We've gotta get the fuck out of here! [runs inside his house] Mom it's starting! We've gotta go! [runs up to his room and opens a drawer. He rifles through it looking for something] Come on, come on! [finds a red safety box with "BRAD PITT SURVIVAL GEAR" printed on the lid and on the panel under the clasp. He opens it and pulls out a gun and a Brad Pitt costume. He puts the costume on, takes the gun, and runs out into the street] Come on, we've gotta move! It's spreading! Let's go! [nearby, a couple is on their front lawn. The man is trimming bushes while his wife is shoveling snow by the front door.]
WOMAN
Does that little boy have a gun?
MAN
Get inside. [drops his shears and heads for the door]
WOMAN
But-
MAN
Get inside! [they both go inside. Cartman crosses the stret and a car almost runs him over, but he sidesteps the car and holds his gun out. The car stops and he gets inside]
CARTMAN
[frantically] Driiive! You've gotta driiive! Nooow!
NELLY'S MOM
What's going on?!
CARTMAN
Get to an airport!
NELLY'S MOM
An airport?! But...?
CARTMAN
We've got about ten minutes before this entire country is up in flames! If you wanna live, you'd better step on the gas! Oh wait, is this a Tesla? Shit! Well press on the prissy pedal! We're gonna die!! [she presses the pedal and takes off]
[The airport, later.]
ANNOUNCER
Now calling rows 10 through 30 for boarding.
CARTMAN
The outbreak has started! We've gotta get the fuck out of here! [enters the tunnel]
PASSENGER 1
An outbreak? [covers his mouth with his sweater]
PASSENGER 2
Which one?
CARTMAN
Get on the flight! Let's move! Let's go go go go! [Nelly's Mom rushes into the plane. Three black security guards appear] Oh my God! [closes the plane's door and locks it. The guards try to get in, but Cartman holds the handle down with all his might]
PILOT
My God, what's going on out there?
CARTMAN
The outbreak's starting! Fly the plane now! [the plane takes off moments later]
[The airplane, now in the air and safe to walk around in]
CO-PILOT
Maybe now you can tell us what the hell is going on?!
CARTMAN
The e-... The end of the world? We've got one shot and one shot only and that's to find a place where the contagion won't reach us!
PASSENGER 3
What contagion? My wife didn't get on the plane. [to the copilot] Take this plane back to Denver!
CARTMAN
You don't understand. There's no Denver left to go back to! [the passengers all take their seats.]
[The control tower. Everyone there is running around trying to figure out how a plane got off without authorization]
CAPTAIN
Alright what the hell is going on here?!
WORKER 1
We don't know anything. First there was talk of a hijacking, then reports of an outbreak of some kind.
WORKER 2
Confirmed report of panic in a rural town in the Colorado Rockies!
WORKER 3
Sir, the pilot of flight 82 wants an update. They're asking permission to land.
CAPTAIN
Stall them. I don't want that plane landing anywhere until we know what the hell we're dealing with!
WORKER 4
[walks up with a book] Sir, you'd better look at this. This was found in the airport lavatory. It seems to be a survival guide of some kind.
CAPTAIN
Survival of what?
WORKER 4
From the looks of it, a contagion outbreak of the worst kind. [the book shows a page of black zombies attacking everyone else]
CAPTAIN
Oh my God.
PILOT
DA43 to tower, please advise! [hangs up the mic] Damnit! They aren't telling me anything!
CO-PILOT
Do you think it's a virus?
PILOT
Virus, bacteria, either way we're all dead! Find out if he thinks it's safe to land in Los Angeles.
CO-PILOT
What about Los Angeles? Can we take the plane to Los Angeles?
CARTMAN
Not a chance. By now most of the urban cities will be compromised. This whole things from city to city. We need to go somewhere the trend won't take hold. Like Iceland. [points to the island on a map.]
CO-PILOT
This plane won't make it to Iceland!
PASSENGER 3
You got a better idea, asshole?!
CARTMAN
Everyone quiet! I have to think!
NELLY'S MOM
Yes, let him think!
CARTMAN
I can't think here. I need a magazine and a toilet. [heads off to the restroom. He sees the "vacant" sign and opens the door, only to see a black man on the toilet]
OCCUPANT
Oh, I'm just finishing up.
CARTMAN
Nah! [shuts the door and jumps back, then throws everything he can at the door so the occupant can't exit]
OCCUPANT
Hey!
CARTMAN
[running back to his seat] One of them is in the back!
NELLY'S MOM
What?!
PASSENGER 3
What do you mean?!
CO-PILOT
Everyone just calm down! We have to stay in control! [the occupant is still trying to get out, and everyone on the plane faces the lavatory door. The occupant begins to grunt and growl]
PASSENGER 4
[at one of the doors] I won't become one of them! [forces it open. It rips away, and he flies out. Other things fly out behind them. The other passengers and crew hang on for dear life. The occupant finally exits the lavatory]
CO-PILOT
Shoot it! [instead of waiting for Cartman to shoot the occupant, he takes Cartman's gun and shoots him. The occupant ducks and the bullet ricochets a few times. It hits the ceiling, which causes an explosion.]
[South Park Elementary playground, day. Butters is skipping rope with a bunch of girls while Stan and Kyle play catch the football with some other guys]
GIRLS
Engine engine #9 running down Chicago Line, if the train should jump the track do you want your money back? [the plane appears and only Stan notices it falling to its doom]
BUTTERS
Yes.
GIRLS
Y-E-S spells yes- [the plane hits a mountain top, then breaks apart as it goes down the mountain.]
[Mr. Mackey's office, some time later]
MR. MACKEY
Now, Tolkien, what you need to understand, m'kay, is that a school assembly is not the time and the place to be yellin' and causin' distractions. M'kay? If there's somebody causin' you problems, then we don't disrupt the assembly, m'kay. You come and you talk to me.
TOLKIEN
He's just out looking for trouble.
MR. MACKEY
Well that's your side of it, Tolkien, but you know Eric has his side as well. Have you thought about maybe writin' him a poem? M'kay? Write E- write Eric a poem, tell him how you feel. [smoke from the plane crash rises behind the mountains] You know, m'kay? Well I'm tellin' you, Tolkien, you let it go, and he'll let it go, and it'll all be fine. Can ya?
[The crash site. Cartman comes to and leaves the wreckage. Nelly's Mom is nearby, and she's calling someone]
NELLY'S MOM
No, the plane crashed. We're in the Colorado mountains somewhere. [the call drops] Matt? Matt?! [notices Cartman and walks up to him to explain] My husband. He said the outbreak was all over the news, but everything was totally fine where he was.
CARTMAN
Totally fine? Then it hasn't happened yet. Oh my God, we still have time!
PILOT
[barely alive] Help! Help me! [Cartman runs up to him] Please, I have two little girls in Chicago. Please find them!
CARTMAN
It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet.
PILOT
Then you have to stop it.
NELLY'S MOM
Yes!
PILOT
And there must be... a Patient Zero... The person it all starts from.
CARTMAN
His name is Tolkien.
NELLY'S MOM
We have to kill him, before he infects everyone else!
CARTMAN
I won't do it! He used to be my friend!
PILOT
You have to! You have to be strong. If you can stop this- if you can save the world- then you have to do it. [coughs up blood] Promise me! Promise... me!
CARTMAN
[sighs] Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world.
PILOT
Thank you-wait, what? [sits up, but dies a few seconds later]
NELLY'S MOM
Oh my God! Oh my God!
CARTMAN
We're gonna live through this! Do you hear me?!
NELLY'S MOM
Yes!
CARTMAN
[takes her hand] Come on! [they leave the crash site]
[Butters' house, day. He's watching TV from the sofa]
REPORTER
First, a wave of 911 calls about a virus, and now a plane has apparently gone down in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Is this the beginning of the end?
BUTTERS
Oh boy! Zombie apocalypse!
REPORTER
The government is looking for a Patient Zero, going only off of this sketch which was found in a notebook at the airport.
[Butters suddenly recognizes the person in the picture] Anyone with information regarding Patient Zero is asked to contact the authorities immediately.
BUTTERS
Holy Moly.
[Jimbo's Guns, day. Cartman and Nelly's Mom reach it and go inside. Cartamn closes the door]
JIMBO
Can I help you?
CARTMAN
Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes! [walks up to the counter] I need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance.
JIMBO
Alright, you want a rifle! [turns around and takes a rifle from the wall, then turns back and hands it to Cartman] well, like this .22 caliber. [Cartman looks it over, and Jimbo puts his hand on his hip] What is it you intend to shoot?
CARTMAN
A person. [Nelly's Mom looks around]
JIMBO
...You mean a person who's threatening you?
CARTMAN
Threatening all of us!
NELLY'S MOM
Please, please hurry! It's important!
JIMBO
Well, you should be fine so long as the person breaks into your house and is an immediate threat to you.
CARTMAN
What?! How am I supposed to get a person to break into my house?!
JIMBO
You can't shoot someone who threatens you just out on the street. Well unless of course you're in a state that has a "stand your ground" law.
CARTMAN
Stand my ground?
NELLY'S MOM
Please! We're running out of time!
JIMBO
See now with a "stand your ground" law, you could legally shoot somebody that's threatening you whether they're in your house or not.
CARTMAN
Yes yes, that's what I need! I'll take that!
JIMBO
No, no, see, you've gotta be IN a state with a "stand your ground" law, like Florida.
CARTMAN
[walks away from the counter] This is hopeless. How am I supposed to shoot Tolkien with all these stupid rules?! [his eyes light up] Wait a minute. I can't shoot Tolkien, [turns around] but I can shoot anyone I want in Florida?
JIMBO
So long as they're threatening you.
NELLY'S MOM
What?! What is it, please?! Hurry, my husband might still be alive!
CARTMAN
The other way to stop the outbreak. Tolkien isn't the only Patient Zero. The outbreak won't happen if... we shoot George Zimmerman. We have to get to Florida!
[Cartman and Nelly's Mom are back at Denver Airport, and the sequence of events from the first plane crash repeat themselves here: Cartman and Nelly's Mom run into the airplane]
CARTMAN
Let's go, let's go! Let's move move move move! Let's go![the plane takes off. Once in the air...] Find the closest airport in Florida! [injects himself with something]
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
This plane is going to Baltimore.
CARTMAN
If we don't get to Florida there's not going to be a Baltimore left! [everyone sits down] Black guy in the back! [the plane crashes into the Everglades. Cartman and Nelly's Mom make it out of the wreckage] Alight, now let's find Zimmerman.
[Florida, evening. A weather-beaten yellow truck crashes into a state sign. Cartman and Nelly's Mom get out and meet behind the truck bed. Cartman opens up his bag.]
CARTMAN
Put this on. We have to stay hidden from here out. [hands her a black sweater, which she puts on as she walks onto the roadway]
NELLY'S MOM
What are we going to do?
CARTMAN
I'm going to flush out Patient Zero. And you're gonna shoot him. It's the only way.
NELLY'S MOM
What if he attacks us first?
CARTMAN
Don't worry, nobody can see us wearing black.
NELLY'S MOM
I haven't had the time to thank you, for doing what you've d- [a Moov-It truck slams into her and carries her body away. Cartman is confused]
[Florida, day. The camera pans down and lands on the Zimmerman residence. A family is seated in the breakfast nook in the kitchen. The girls are giggling.]
MRS. ZIMMERMAN
[serving pancakes] Eat your breakfast, girls. [turns around to put the pan back on the stove]
OLDER DAUGHTER
Where's Daddy?
MRS. ZIMMERMAN
You can eat without your father in the room. Now hurry. [the girls giggle and the older one notices someone]
OLDER DAUGHTER
Daddy!
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN
Good morning, girls. [walks in fully dressed, with a cup of coffee already in hand.] Save Daddy any pancakes? Look at that? Six A.M. and my family is already smiling. [Mom walks over and kisses him]
MRS. ZIMMERMAN
How did I get such a perfect husband, George Zimmerman?
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN
And how did I get such a beautiful wife?
OLDER DAUGHTER
I love you, Dad.
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN
I love you too, Princess. I love both of you, equally.
MRS. ZIMMERMAN
Nothing can ever go wrong, so long as we all have each other.
REPORTER
[on TV] Is there any hope for stopping the zombie apocalypse? [George Zimmerman turns around to see the news] CNN has just received word that the government has learned the identity of Patient Zero. [the drawing of Tolkien is shown] The nine year old threat to humanity has been tracked down, and measures are being taken to stop him.
YOUNGER DAUGHTER
Daddy, what's a Patient Zero? [a knock is heard at the front door. George Zimmerman turns left and walks to the front door. He opens it and two federal agents face him]
AGENT 1
Hello, Mr. Zimmerman. Your country needs you.
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN
What do you need from me?
AGENT 1
We... [holds up a photo of Tolkien] need you to shoot a young African-American for us.
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN
[turns and walks away] I gave that up.
AGENT 2
You're the best, Zimmerman. We just need you to do it one more time, for the security of the world!
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN
Damnit, I have a wife and kids now.
AGENT 1
Then do it for your family! [Cartman appears on the sidewalk, wearing black face paint and a black sweater] This is about protecting people, Zimmerman! Keeping our streets safe so that our children are free to go out... [his voice trails off as Zimmerman focuses on something else]
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN
Something's wrong. [quickly turns around and sees the stranger] Look out! [grabs the gun from one of the agent and fires it twice. Cartman's arm gets hit by a bullet and he falls to the ground]
AGENT 1
My God, I didn't even see him. [the other agent walks over to the body]
AGENT 2
Nice work, Zimmerman. [George turns and walks over to his family]
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN
Are you guys okay?
OLDER DAUGHTER
What was that, Daddy?
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN
More needless violence.
AGENT 1
Nonsense, you did what you had to. You're a hero.
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN
That may be true, but I'll have to live with this the rest of my life. Even though I'll be walking around a free man.
AGENT 2
[notices the paint coming off Cartman's face] Hey, wait a minute. This kid isn't black, he's white.
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN
Wait, what?
[A courtroom. This is a speedy trial. The judge announces his decision with two blows of the gavel]
JUDGE
Guilty!
[The electic chair. George Zimmerman is tied down to it and the operator brings the switch down for three seconds, then raises it. He lowers it again for two seconds and raises it. Then he does this three times more for a fraction of a second each, then a final time for half a second.]
[A news report]
REPORTER
The zombie apocalypse... is over. All the panic, crashing planes and chaos appear to have, for some reason, died with George Zimmerman. And as for the little boy who was so mercilessly gunned down? [a picture of Cartman smiling appears, his left shoulder in a bandage, his right hand giving a thumbs up] Although he survived the shooting, his wishes are to remain anonymous, giving the hospital only the nickname... "Brad Pitt." ...But cooler.
[At one of the boys' homes. Eight of them are sitting around watching the news: Clyde, Kyle, Stan, and Craig on the sofa; Jimmy, Kenny and Butters in front of Clyde, and Tolkien sitting by himself near Craig.]
STAN
That sure wasn't much of a zombie apocalypse.
KYLE
Yeah, that sucked.
BUTTERS
Well, at least I'll bet Tolkien's glad it's over with. Aren't you, Tolkien? [Tolkien just stands up, looks at the other guys, and walks out. Butters' smile fades]
[On the street, day. Cartman is in the distance, looking at Tolkien. Tolkien notices and faces him]
CARTMAN
Hey Tolkien. ...Sup bro? ...How's it goin' dude? I know how it feels now.
TOLKIEN
You made everyone think I'm a fucking Patient Zero!
CARTMAN
Dude, I'm saying I'm sorry.
TOLKIEN
So what?!
CARTMAN
Uh oh. [brings forth a can of red spray paint and paints a red circle around himself in the middle of the street] Sounds like you're still angry, Tolkien.
TOLKIEN
Fuck you!
CARTMAN
Alright Tolkien, come on! This is ridiculous. I know you totally wanna kick my ass right now. You'd like to walk right up and punch me in the face, but what's that gonna solve? I've got a way better idea. [makes a fist with his right hand and puts it forth] First bump? [Tolkien stays put] Come on dude, fist bump. Bump that shit bro. Be the bigger person. [Tolkien walks up to the red circle, then bends forward and offers his left fist. Then he steps into the circle and Cartman quickly shoots him]
TOLKIEN
Oh! [falls on his face]
CARTMAN
That was, he was on my ground. You all saw that, right? Everything inside the red line is mine. [drags Tolkien's body into the circle] Inside the red line is, that's- that's my ground. He was on it. [smiles when no one answers.]
[Cartman's dream, day. He's sailing off in his Brad Pitt costume, with his dream family looking on from shore.]
GERRY'S DAUGHTERS
Daddy!
GERRY
We're safe, girls! Daddy did it!
[Mr. Garrison's class, day. Tolkien is absent. Cartman wakes up screaming... during class. Mr. Garrison crosses his arms again]
CARTMAN
Ugh! Oh man. The ending to that movie was so terrible.
KYLE
You're having nightmares about the ending to World War Z again?
CARTMAN
Yeah. So bad.
KYLE
That's what bothering you? Not the fact that you're a murderer?
CARTMAN
Jury found me innocent, Kyle!
KYLE
You're a murderer.
CARTMAN
You interrupt people when they talk.
MR. MACKEY
[over the PA system] Eric Cartman to the counselor's office please.
CARTMAN
Oh man! [walks out of the room]
[Mr. Mackey's office, moments later. Cartman walks in. Tolkien and Cartman immediately notice each other]
CARTMAN
Oh boy.
MR. MACKEY
Have a seat, Eric. Now boys, I for one am sick and tired of this little feud you're having, okay? This has clearly gone too far, and you owe each other an apology or you're gettin' detention!
TOLKIEN
An apology?! He shot me!
MR. MACKEY
Well he was technically standing his ground, Tolkien.
CARTMAN
Yeah Tolkien, that's the law! Everything inside the red line is lava.
TOLKIEN
[stands on his chair] Well it's a pretty fucking stupid law!
CARTMAN
Tolkien, calm down.
TOLKIEN
And why does standing your ground not apply to fucking white people?!
CARTMAN
Oh God, here we go again! [runs out of the office in a panic]
End of World War Zimmerman

synopsis:The Goth kids are being sent away to a camp for troubled children.

script:Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers

[Henrietta's room, night. She's holding a dramatic Edgar Allan Poe reading there with her fellow Goths. On a small table nearby sits three candles, two books, a statue, and a black and white picture of a freak show with a sign on it: HUMAN FREAK EXHIBIT]
HENRIETTA
So I cast my body into the trails of blood.
The knife pierces deep, deep into my lonely eyes.
So I can see this black world... no more.
PETE
Whoa... That's pretty hardcore. [taps some ashes off his cigarette into his ashtray, then flips his hair]
MICHAEL
That's real pain right there. [taps some ashes off his cigarette into his ashtray]
HENRIETTA
That's how I feel when my mother abuses me. I just wanna escape, so she can't hurt me anymore. [Mrs. Biggle knocks three times on Henrietta's door, then opens it]
MRS. BIGGLE
[sing song] Henrietta, sweetie.
HENRIETTA
[glares at her] Shut up, Mom! Go away!
MRS. BIGGLE
Oh, but remember, Daddy wanted to talk to you in the living room, my dark little princess.
HENRIETTA
Stop calling me a princess! I'm not a beauty queen in a Disney movie!
MRS. BIGGLE
We'll be waiting in the living room.
HENRIETTA
[rolls her eyes] God, she just never stops!
[The living room, moments later.]
MRS. BIGGLE
Oh goodness I am so nervous. [Henrietta enters the living room]
HENRIETTA
What?!
MR. BIGGLE
Have a seat, Henrietta. [Henrietta sits on the chair]
MRS. BIGGLE
Oh, a little family chit-chaaat.
HENRIETTA
Shut up, Mom!
MR. BIGGLE
Henrietta, as you know, your mother and I have been concerned about your behavior for some time.
HENRIETTA
Are we really doing this again?!
MR. BIGGLE
We've had a hard time coping with the dark things you're into, but we've finally had some counseling, and apparently we're not the only parents who have a child that is... emo.
HENRIETTA
What?!
MRS. BIGGLE
But Daddy and I love our little muffin, even if she's emo or not.
HENRIETTA
I'm not a fucking emo! Don't you even know the fucking diff!
MR. BIGGLE
Do you know how your foul language breaks your mother's heart?
MRS. BIGGLE
Like calling Mommy Demon Jizz.
MR. BIGGLE
So listen, sweetie, we've found a camp. [her mom brings out a brochure]
HENRIETTA
Noo...
MR. BIGGLE
A camp which is for troubled kids like you, and you get to work outside and learn about responsibility.
HENRIETTA
[stands up, ready to leave the room] I'm not going to any fucking camp!
MR. BIGGLE
It's for two weeks, and when you come back we can talk about earning back some of your privileges.
HENRIETTA
I won't come back because I'll be fucking dead. I'll walk out of that camp and I'll walk the streets until I probably get picked up and gangbanged by criminals until I'm bleeding out my fucking eyes!!
MRS. BIGGLE
Theeeey have a horseshoe pit where you can challenge the other kids to horsehoooes.
[The loading dock at the side of the school, day, the goths' usual gathering spot]
PETE
And that's all you know? what else did she say?
MICHAEL
She said that her parents called her an emo and she had to go to this camp for two weeks.
PETE
[flips hair] Oh my God, for two weeks?
FIRKLE
Is she at the camp now?
MICHAEL
I don't know. [scrolls through his text messages] She texted from the bus they put her on, then she said she wasn't even allowed to have her cell phone where she was going. Then all of a sudden her texts went dark.
PETE
[softly] Whoa...
FIRKLE
That's fucking creepy man.
MICHAEL
[gets up and walks a bit] I just can't believe it. I can't believe parents would do that to their child.
[Child Protective Services, day. The three remaining Goths go to talk to a worker there]
WORKER
Alright now, you say that you witnessed your friend being abused by her parents.
MICHAEL
Yes. They called her an emo.
WORKER
What's wrong with that?
MICHAEL
Emos suck! They're vile, self-pitying, depressed assholes!
WORKER
So, why do you think they called her that?
MICHAEL
Because she's Goth, and some ignorant people don't know the difference!
WORKER
What is the difference?
PETE
Oh my God! They're totally different!
WORKER
Okay, different how?
PETE
They're, uhm, you know, one is good and- and emos are horrible! [flips hair] They're, you know... They're posers!
FIRKLE
Emos suck my Goth balls.
MICHAEL
Alright alright, think of it this way: a goth believes that deep down the world is totally fucked up. But an emo thinks that deep down, they are totally fucked up.
WORKER
That's not much of a difference.
PETE
That's a huge fucking difference!
MICHAEL
Okay okay, look, emos are more prone to suicide.
PETE
This fuckin' bitch, man.
MICHAEL
But goths are more prone to be depressed that so many people commit suicide.
PETE
Goth's darkness is nihilistic whereas Emo's is cynical.
MICHAEL
Wait, I thought we were cynical. ...Whatever, it doesn't matter.
PETE
No, see, you're nihilistic.
MICHAEL
Oh yeah, you're right.
[Troubled Acres Rehab for at-risk teens (with emotional problems... who need structure), day. It's a secluded camp with a large greenhouse in the middle. In a white room is Henrietta, with only a bed and blankets to keep her company. There's an emergency light above the door and a security camera in one upper corner of the room. She kicks and bangs on the door]
HENRIETTA
Hel-lo?! Somebody let me out of here! You can't treat people like this! [notices the camera and looks at it.] This is fucking ridiculous! What's wrong with you?! I'm gonna go to the fucking cops when I get out of here! [the floor opens up behind her. She turns around to see what's going on, and a plant rises into the room. She looks at the plant, puzzled. It begins to shake like a rattle, then stops]
[A South Park Transit bus stop, day. The three goths await Henrietta's return. Firkle holds a sign that reads "WELCOME BACK BITCH"]
PETE
What if she comes back, and she's all preppy and conformist?
MICHAEL
She's only been there two weeks. They can't have changed her that much. Can they have? [the bus arrives and they all turn to look at its stop. The rear doors open and they look in. Henrietta appears and they gasp.]
FIRKLE
Oh. My. God. [Henrietta steps off, and boy has she changed!]
HENRIETTA
Hey guys. [she now wears a green headband, pink highlights in her hair, and additional pink makeup around her eyes. The left eye is made to look as though it's been crying. Her gloves are pink and black and instead of her cross necklace, she wears a necklace where the pendant is shaped like a bat]
PETE
What the hell have they done to you?
HENRIETTA
What do you mean? They couldn't do anything. They can't fix me. They don't even understand me. [walks away. The other three move a bit to get a better look at her leaving]
MICHAEL
Oh my God. It's worse than we thought! They made her emo!
[The school gym, day. The kids are tossing basketballs at each other. Kenny tries to climb a rope while a girl looks on. The coach blows his whistle and moves off-screen. As he does so, the Goths are revealed on the bleachers]
MICHAEL
[concerned] Has she said one word to either one of you guys?
PETE
Nothing. It's like she's a totally different person. [flips hair]
MICHAEL
She won't even look at us. All she does now is hang out with the douchebag emo kids. [the camera pans right, across the aisle, and shows Henrietta with her new friends, the Emos]
EMO BOY
God, PE class is for such wannabe posers.
EMO GIRL
I'd rather kill myself than put on gym shorts.
HENRIETTA
I wish there would just be an earthquake, so we could all die.
PETE
Uugh, how could she hang out with them??
MICHAEL
There must something else going on here.
[Henrietta's room. She's listening to music on her iPod dock while drawing a picture titled "I Am Alone." Someone knocks on her door.]
HENRIETTA
Not now Mom! I'm suicidal!
MICHAEL
[enters] It's not your mom, it's me.
HENRIETTA
Oh, hey. [lowers the volume.]
MICHAEL
What did they do you? At that camp?
HENRIETTA
What do you mean? Just the usual group therapy crap.
MICHAEL
Don't take this the wrong way, but... I think that place turned you into an emo.
HENRIETTA
That's ridiculous. I'm not anything. I don't fit in anywhere. I'm not emo, okay?
MICHAEL
Then why are you listening to Sunny Day Real Estate? [she stops what she is doing and then turns off the iPod] I was thinking, maybe they just made you confused at that place. Maybe they didn't know what they were doing. But then I started thinking, maybe that place... turned you emo on purpose. Like maybe they knew what they were doing.
HENRIETTA
[getting cross, then turns her chair around slowly] You should probably stop digging for answers.
MICHAEL
What?
HENRIETTA
There's no winning this for you. [gets off her chair and walks towards him] Soon the entire world will be emo. It is our time.
MICHAEL
Nooo waaaaay.
HENRIETTA
Nobody understands us. And they won't understand until it is faaar tooo late.
MICHAEL
Omigodnowaaaaaaaaay.
HENRIETTA
Do not fight it, Michael. Is being emo really all that different from being goth? [sataniccally] Join us!
MICHAEL
[runs out of the house] No waaay! [runs out of the house and across the street and throws his cane away to the ground] No way no waaaaaay!
[A tiny diner, night. Pete is reading a book titled "The Sinking Girl" on an armchair]
A RING TONE
Death and despair! Death and despair! Death and despair! Death and desp-
PETE
[answers it] Hello?
MICHAEL
It's worse than we thought.
PETE
What is? Everything? [flips hair]
MICHAEL
No! I mean Henrietta. I confronted her and she was all like "I am emo! And emos are going to rule the world" and I was like "No waaay!" and she was like "Yeah, soon it will be too late." and I was all "No waaay!"
PETE
No way.
MICHAEL
Yeah, so listen: call up Firkle and meet me at Village Inn. I gotta run home, but I'll be there in ten minutes. [rushes home and closes the front door, then runs up the stairs.]
[Michael's house, night. He runs upstairs...]
MOM
Michael! Michael! [Michael leans over the rail]
MICHAEL
Can't now, Mom! I've got an emergency!
DAD
In the dining room Michael! Let's go! [Michael goes down reluctantly and enters the dining room] Have a seat, son. [Michael takes a seat opposite his dad.] Your mom and I have decided you're going to go away for a little while.
MICHAEL
What??
DAD
[holds up the same brochure Mrs. Biggle held up two weeks earlier] We've been put in touch with this camp for troubled kids like you and-
MICHAEL
What the hell are you talking about?!
MOM
This place gonna fix you, make you normal child! [moments later his dad takes him outside and toward the truck]
MICHAEL
No! You've gotta listen to me! You don't know what you're doing!! [Dad throws him into the car] You fucking conformists! [the truck starts up and backs out of the driveway. Michael looks across the street and sees Henrietta with her emo friends, two of whom are new. He gasps. As the truck pulls away he screams through the closed window] They're eviillll!
[The Village Inn, night. Pete and Firkle are in a booth drinking coffee and smoking.]
PETE
I never thought it would end like this. I never thought that Goths would just be slowly replaced by Emos.
FIRKLE
Pete... if they get me... if I get sent to that camp... and I come back Emo... kill me. Promise that you'll kill me.
PETE
[flips hair] I promise.
WAITRESS
Hey, you kids need to order somethin' or you need to go. [pours some coffee into Firkle's mug.]
PETE
Not now, lady, we're really depressed.
WAITRESS
So what else is new?
PETE
This is different, okay?! Our two friends are being bodysnatched by Emos! [flips hair] There's only one other group who understands Emos like we do. We're gonna have to team up with the Vampires.
FIRKLE
Are you crazy?
PETE
[leaves the booth] What choice do we have?!
FIRKLE
The Vampires are our sworn enemy. We beat up their leader and burned down their lair. Don't you remember?
PETE
Yeah I remember. And it may be a suicide mission, but we have to walk right in the middle of the Vampires, and ask them for help.
[Conference room B, the noon hour. Vamp kids file in and take seats. The hour is set aside for Vamp kids and Twilight fans]
VAMPIRE
Okay, let's all be seated please? [the kids quiet down] This is thee noon meeting of the Vamp kids? I am Mike, your lord and dark master, per se.
VAMPS
Hail Mike.
MIKE
Okay, uhhh, our main order of business is of course the Halloween social. We're still looking for volunteers to make the- [a round of snarls goes up as Pete and Firkle enter the meeting]
MOHAWK VAMP
It's the Goth kids! [moves aside. The other Vamps turn to look at the Goths and take to hissing and snarling at them. A boy Vamp steps forward and snarls at Pete as Pete and Firkle head for the podium]
PETE
Ugh! You spit on me, Larry. [Mike steps down so Pete can address the Vamps] Uhh, hey everybody, uuhm, I know we aren't on the greatest terms right now. We realize we called you all queermos, and we're sorry we burned down the Hot Topic at the mall.
FIRKLE
Sorry.
PETE
But, uhhh, we have a bigger problem here, and it's ALL of our problem.
MIKE
You've got a lot of nerve coming here!
PETE
Yeah, shut up Mike. Listen, okay? There's a camp that kids like us are being sent to, a-and somehow this place is taking kids like us and... turning them Emo. [the Vamps start talking amongst themselves] Yeah. You might not even be able to tell at first. It could have already happened. One of you might already be turned.
BLACK VAMP
Okay hold up! Hold up! You mean that one of us might not really be a Vamp kid? [silence]
PETE
Uhhhhh, right.
BLACK VAMP
[steps into the aisle and moves forward] Well whoever you is, you better get yo' ass ready to run, muthafucka, 'cause you're a damn traitor! And I bet you it's this little n*gga right here![stops by a Vamp in a skeleton sweater named "Vladimir"]
[Henrietta's house, night. She's in her bedroom with a lot of new Emo friends.]
HENRIETTA
Are you guys getting into that Fall Out Boy concert?
EMO GIRL
I can't. I'm too depressed. I keep cutting myself.
HENRIETTA
Yeah. I'm cutting myself to hurt this worthless body that I'm in. [a knock is heard at her door]
MRS. BIGGLE
[sing-song] Henrietta, I baked cookies for your new little Emo friends.
HENRIETTA
Not now, Mom! Can't you see I'm hurting?! [gets sarcastic] I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment! Sorry I'm not the pretty cheerleader ya always wanted! [her mom takes the cookies back and closes the door. She goes to the living room]
MR. BIGGLE
Does she still seem better?
MRS. BIGGLE
Oh, much better! She didn't call me a bitch, and she actually apologized to me.
MR. BIGGLE
Well that's more like it.
EMO BOY 1
You know what we should do? After us Emos take over the Earth? We should um, paint the White House black. And we should have Fall Out Boy at the Super Bowl. [Mike rises from under the window sill. The Emos don't notice]
EMO BOY 2
We're Emos. [the cowlick Vamp which was called "Larry" by Pete rises next to Mike] When we rule the Earth we're not gonna have football.
EMO BOY 1
Oh yeah. [outside, three other Vamps hold up the two boys peering inside the window. Pete and Firkle sit on the roof nearby. The Vamps have seen enough and withdraw from the window]
MIKE
And you say she just showed up like this?
PETE
You know Henrietta; that thing in there is not Henrietta!
COWLICK VAMP
That blonde Emo is Sarah Collins. She was a Vamp kid two weeks ago.
BLACK VAMP
You want me to go in there and waste these mothafuckas?! I'll do it!
PETE
We can't just go in there and kick their asses. We have to stop this thing at its source.
MIKE
Indeed. If there is some kind of black magic at work creating these monsters, then we will have to use our most powerful Vampiric abilities to stop it.
COWLICK VAMP
Do you mean?
MIKE
Yes, my child of darkness. We must call upon the powers of the Vamp kids' most sacred entity, per se. Only he can help us in this darkest time. This calls... for a summoning.
[The South Park Elementary Library, night. The Goths and Vamps are gathered at a table there, complete with candles]
MIKE
We call upon the creator of all that is dark! The godfather of Death and Despair! Edgar Allan Poe, your followers in darkness beg for your help! [everyone looks around, but nothing happens] We summon to the world of the living the great Edgar Allan Poe! Knower of all that is misery! Your children need special guidance! Per se.
PETE
This, is your plan? Try to summon Edgar Allan Poe back from the dead?!
MIKE
Edgar Allan Poe was the original Vamp kid.
PETE
No, he was the original Goth, but he'd been dead for 150 years!
BLACK VAMP
Ey, look man! All genres of Gothic subcultures are derivatives of Poe's work. Muthafucka!
PETE
Look, we came to you for help, and all you've done since then is waste our time! [a violent thunderclap and lightning immediately follow, and a vortex opens up on the ceiling]
COWLICK VAMP
Holy shit look! [Edgar Allan Poe appears and the vortex vanishes]
POE
Where am I? What is this place?
FIRKLE
It's him! It's Edgar Allan Poe.
POE
Why have the living summoned me from my rest? [Mike taps Pete to signal that it's his turn to speak]
PETE
Uhhhhh, okayokay, listen: there's this camp for troubled kids, right? Only they aren't helping kids, they're, they're purposefully turning them into Emos.
POE
Emos? ...Ew oh my God, Emos are such wannabe conformists.
MIKE
Yeah, oh yes!
PETE
Right!
POE
Children of Darkness, I would help you, but I fear I cannot be seen with a bunch of douchey Vamp kids and their poser-ass plastic fangs.
PETE
Thank you!
MIKE
Hey!
PETE
I'm just saying it's nice to know that Edgar Allan Poe agrees with us.
POE
Agrees with who? Is that red dye in your hair or did a blood demon take a shit on your head, poser?
BLACK VAMP
Ah ah! He got you there, n*gga!
PETE
Okay, look, we're running out of time. You have to help us stop the Emos.
POE
Why should I? Just 'cause you summoned me doesn't mean you're the boss of me!
PETE
Uh, yeah, it kind of does.
POE
[floats away, mocking] Oh okay, Mom. Let's go fight the Emos, Mom.
[Back at Troubled Acres, night. The greenhouse is lit. Inside, Michael is in a chair asleep, tied down to it by thick ropes.]
MICHAEL
What? Where are you ta- No! NO!! [jerks around and wakes up, assessing his situation] What the hell?? ...Oh my God. [he realizes where he is and tries to shake himself loose from the ropes] Get me out of here! Let me go!
HOWARD
Shhhhh. [Michael sees him] It's best you don't upset them. [goes to water another plant]
MICHAEL
What the hell are you doing to people?!
HOWARD
Not me. I just work for them. They're not evil, you know? They're just misunderstood. All I do is help the Emos get into their human hosts. They promised me when they take over Earth I can have a cabin on the lake, and all the steak I can eat.
MICHAEL
Wait a minute. Emos are plants? [the plants begin to rattle in their pots.]
HOWARD
Shhh, shhh, it's okay. Not just any plants. They're very unique. Very special. Nobody understands them. Emoclarus americanus. Wonderful species. Except for their tendencies of self-mutilation and the need for other species to acknowledge their pain.
MICHAEL
Oh, it all makes sense now! [A giant emoclarus rattles into view]
HOWARD
Oh! I'm sorry. Sorry, Emo King. [holds a conversation with it] Oh no, I wasn't talking to him. I mean, I was, but- Y-yes! Yes, I understand. [walks back to a smaller plant] Right away.[takes the potted plant and walks over to Michael]
MICHAEL
No. [Howard sets the plant down next to him] What are you doing?! I don't wanna be emo!
HOWARD
[walks away, then turns around] You just don't understand. You'll understand them soon.
MICHAEL
What the...? [the plant begins to rattle]
HOWARD
It's quicker if you don't fight it.
MICHAEL
No, NOOOOOOOOO! [begins to rattle with the plant]
[The road, night. The Vamps and Goths are heading to Troubled Acres. Pete is driving]
PETE
Alright, listen up. Once we find our friend, we've gotta torch the place and get out.
FIRKLE
[coughs] Dude, Edgar, can you not smoke in the car?
POE
You can't tell me what to do! Who elected you the mayor of me?!
PETE
Cut it out, Edgar! It's annoying everybody!
POE
God, you guys are so lame! [tosses his cigarette out the window] And if you want my help, you'd better all stop calling me Edgar.
BLACK VAMP
Well that's your name, isn't it?
POE
That's the name my stupid parents gave me! I like to be called by my Goth name: Nightpayne.
BLACK VAMP, MIKE, AND PETE
Oh God...
POE
What? You guys are posers!
BLACK VVMP
Ey, just so you all know, if one of you ain't who you say they is, and we get inside that base and you reveal you're actually one of them Emo muthafuckas in disguise, I WILL go crazy on yo' ass!
POE
If one of us is a traitor, it's probably your wannabe vampire leader.
MIKE
Oh, fuck off, Nightpayne.
POE
Make me, poser.
[Troubled Acres, night, at the greenhouse. A security camera follows the car as it enters the rehab center. Everyone exits the car. Another camera shows Michael rattling with the emo plant. A third camera catches the group going down one hallway.]
PETE
Michael?! You here?
MIKE
I feel like we're being watched. [yes they are, by the Security Cam 3000. A fourth camera shows Henrietta's former room. Zooming out reveals an emoclarus looking over a desk with video cameras all around. The king emoclarus looks on. It leans over and seems to whisper to the security emoclarus. In the greenhouse, the group reaches Michael, who has become delirious and is now groaning]
PETE
Dude! Michael, are you okay?
MICHAEL
Kick it over! Stop the plant! [Mike walks over and kicks the plant away, then gets into a karate stance. Firkle disappears] Oh! Oh, thank God you're here. Emos are plants and they're invading human bodies.
PETE
Alright, we're gonna get you out of here, and then we're gonna burn this whole place down. [a gun is cocked and everyone looks at the source]
FIRKLE
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that's not the plan.
HOWARD
[appears behind him and approaches the group] You did very good. The emo plants are very pleased with your dedication.
MICHAEL
Firkle! All this time I thought you were Goth! How long have you been Emo? [Firkle takes off his jacket and ... wig.]
FIRKLE
Don't you see we can't stop them? We might as well join' em. [The Emo King shows up and starts rattling. Howard turns around and walks toward it]
HOWARD
Yes Emo King, right away. [turns around again] The Emo King wants us to proceed at once. [moments later the black Vamp, Mike, and Pete are tied to chairs and plants are placed in front of them]
PETE
Ugh! Let us go, you ultimate conformists!
HOWARD
Don't fight it. It's quicker that way. [the plants begin to rattle]
MIKE
Oh God! I'm starting to feel Emo.
PETE
Wait a minute. Where the hell is Edgar Allan Poe?
MIKE
He said he was over this, and was gonna hang out at the Village Inn.
PETE
What?!
[The Village Inn, night. The Ghost of Goth Past sits in the same booth the Goth kids sit in, sipping coffee and smoking]
WAITRESS
[approaches] Hey, are you gonna order any food, or are you just gonna sit there and drink coffee all day?
POE
Leave me alone! I just want coffeh.
WAITRESS
[turns around and leaves] Little prick.
POE
Bitch.
PETE
[voice only] Poe? Edgar Allan Poe, where are you? [his face appears in Poe's coffee] What the hell are you doing?! You're supposed to be helping us!
POE
I can't right now. I'm dealing with a lot and I just have a lot of anxiety.
PETE
Look, we [flips hair] summoned you to help us save the world!
POE
What's the point? Save some people so some other people can be lame? And then those lame-os can be lamer to some other posers?
PETE
God, he is such a downer! [the plants rattle again]
HOWARD
Just let the spores inside you. Stop fighting it.
MIKE
Wait. Look!
POE
[floating in] Okay, I'm here, posers.
PETE
Nightpayne! Destroy the plant leader! The leader over there! [Poe descends and lands next to the Emo King]
POE
What do you want me to do?
MIKE, MICHAEL, AND PETE
Shoot it!
POE
Really? Shoot a plant?
MICHAEL
Shoot it! [Poe obliges, but nothing happens to the plant. A piece of its pot might have come off. Poe just shrugs.]
POE
Wait a minute. What is this? [walks over and pulls out the plant's tag] This says it was bought at Lowe's Home and Garden for $29.95. [it's a common ficus]
HOWARD
Lowe's Home and Garden?
PETE
Hey, these are just plants.
HOWARD
No they- they talk to me!
POE
No, they're just, like, ficus plants and vibrating pots.
HOWARD
But-
VOICE
Looks like it's over, Harold Flannigan. So we have just one question for you: are you scared?!
HOWARD
[frozen in fear] What do you mean?
VOICE
ARE YOU SCARED?!
HOWARD
YES!!! [Pete flips his hair]
VOICE
That's good! 'Cause you're on... "Yes, I Was Scared!" [music plays and the lights come on]
PETE
What?? [the cast and crew of that show come out of the plant work.]
HOST
Look! Look at the camera right there!
HOWARD
Oh my God, are you serious? [grins.]
HOST
Your wife Sarah put you up to this.
SARAH
[pops in next to Harold] Haha I got you! [giggles some more]
FIRKLE
This is a prank?
BLACK VAMP
Oh man that's good! They got us good!
FIRKLE
I turned traitor for no reason?
PETE
[to Michael] Did you know about this?
MICHAEL
I have no idea what's going on.
HOST
Howard, did you suspect at all that a gardener job at a camp for troubled teens was a setup?
HOWARD
No, they really had me convinced!
HOST
And you didn't suspect anything when we had plants tell you to turn Goths and Vamp kids into Emos when really they're exactly the same thing?
HOWARD
I guess I should have figured it out. I'm an idiot. [laughs]
HOST
Tune in again next week, when we make a woman from Milwaukee think she's working at a haunted abortion clinic.
[Henrietta's room, night. Henrietta's working on a new picture, featuring a gallows noose. A knock is heard at her door, and Pete walks in with Michael]
HENRIETTA
So, my friends. Have you made the transformation?
PETE
Uhhhh, Henrietta, we have some bad news. The plants you think took over your body and made you emo? They're just plants. [she stops drawing] From Lowe's Home and Garden.
MICHAEL
It was all a prank by some douchey network reality show.
HENRIETTA
Nnnnoooo, there's an organic spore in my head that made me switch cliques so easily.
MICHAEL
No, you just kind of did it on your own.
HENRIETTA
Oh my Gawd... [closes her eyes, drops her pen on the table, and pinches her nose at the bridge] This is so... embarrassing.
PETE
Ahh, hang on. What I meant to say was [flips his hair] we just infiltrated the Emo lair and... we torched the plant leader.
HENRIETTA
Oh. [sudden relief] Oh! [she begins convulsing, then turns around in her chair] Ihihit's meee-e! I'm- I'm me again! [gets off her chair and walks to the boys] Oh my God I'm... all better. Thanks, you guys.
MRS. BIGGLE
[peeks into the room] Henrietta, I have dinner ready.
HENRIETTA
Shut up, Mom! Leave me alone, you conformist bag of demon jizz!
MRS. BIGGLE
...Fatty. [closes the door.]

synopsis:When Ike hits puberty, he and Kyle start to grow apart. To save their relationship, Kyle takes Ike to see a live performance of Yo Gabba Gabba.

script:Taming Strange

[South Park Elementary, day, Mr. Garrison's classroom. Mr. Mackey is present, showing the class a new computer system he's had installed at school]
MR. MACKEY
Students, I would like to introduce you all to the future. [holds a laptop with an IntelliLink logo on it] M'kay. Starting today, our school will be operating entirely on IntelliLink. [presses a key that brings up the splash screen] Now whenever you need to see the school nurse, or talk to me, your counselor, you can simply sign up using this simple, integrated portal. [presses the space bar] M'kay... [presses it again. Presses is twice more, and the main menu pops up] You can use a computer or any of the IntelliLink panels which are located throughout the school. [one such panel is shown next to the window] Lat's say you're in the cafeteria, m'kay. You start cougin' up blood and need to see the nurse. You just click on "school clinic"[presses a button, and the school clinic menu pops up.] Mkay, see nurse. [selects it and a box appears on the right side with fields for teachers, student, note, and some checkboxes.]M'kay. Respiration problems. [presses a button, and "All Night Long" plays] Uh, okay, I must have I must have been in the wrong menu, uhkay. As you can see, you can control the sound system as well. Okay. [presses a key, and the song is cut off] It's all integrated and smartlinked, and this is a great idea, m'kay. Let's look at the message board. [press, and gets to the main menu] Mesage... board. [moves the cursor to the message board icon and loads the board] Here you can easily write messages to each other or to the faculty, m'kay? For instance, [sees the first thread title that loads] here we go. Here's a message from Kyle's little brother, Ike Broflovski. [loads the message] Okay, little Ike says "My brother is a homo"[Cartman cackles and Kyle is startled] Ike made a little drawing of his brother too. [loads the drawing] Drew a nice picture with a... nice bird hangin' off Kyle's forehead, m'kay, that's nice. [Cartman cackles again, and Kyle looks annoyed] It's a nice... crane, a nice whoopin' crane comin' off Kyle's head there.
CARTMAN
That's not a crane, it's a dick and balls.
BUTTERS
Heheh, yeah. [chuckles to himself. Kyle is now annoyed and embarrassed]
[The Broflovski house, day, kitchen. Sheila is washing dishes when Kyle appears and enters]
KYLE
Mom, Ike did it again. I don't know what's going on with him, but, it's like he hates me.
SHEILA
Oh, Kyle, your little brother is, getting older. He's not a baby anymore.
KYLE
I know, but he posted a message of me with a schlong on my head.
SHEILA
It's natural, bubbe. Part of getting older is finding ways to assert your independence. You know. Why don't you go and try to talk to him - you can win him over again. [Kyle thinks it over and walks out]
[Ike's room, moments later. Kyle opens the door and enters]
KYLE
Hey Ike, how's it going?
IKE
[looks over his left shoulder] Get out of my room, Kyle! I'm on my computer! [turns back to his computer]
KYLE
I just wanted to see if maybe you want to do fingerpaints with me.
IKE
Do I look like I wanna do fuckin' fingerpaints?! [looks over his shoulder again] Look at the fuckin' zits on my face!
KYLE
Ike, I just want us to be friends again.
IKE
Then stop harassing me, bro! You don't know what it's like to be a baby goin' through puberty! I don't know whether to watch Yo Gabba Gabba or go out and tame some strange!
KYLE
Yeah, let's watch Yo Gabba Gabba, like old times.
[Living room, moments later. Kyle and Ike sit on the sofa watching Yo Gabba Gabba. The troupe performs "Come On And Dance." Toodee steps forward to dance a bit]
IKE
Dancy Dance is my favorite.
KYLE
It always has been. See? This is nice. [Foofa steps forward]
IKE
Who would you rather fuck? [Kyle is stunned] Foofa or Toodee?
KYLE
What?
IKE
I wanna fuck Foofa. [a closeup of Foofa dancing] I wouldn't wanna fuck Toodee. She's a dike. You can tell. But Foofa, man. [whips out a can of chewing tobacco, opens it, and scoops some tobacco out] I bet she's got some sweet strange. [puts the tobacco in his mouth] I don't even know what the fuck Muno is.
KYLE
Ike, is that chewing tobacco?
IKE
What?! You gonna fuckin' narc and tell Mom?!
KYLE
No, I just don't think it's healthy.
IKE
That's 'cause you don't understand shit! [stands on the sofa] I knew this was a bad idea! [leaves the sofa and walks away] I'm gonna watch Yo Gabba Gabba in my roomsy!
[Mr. Mackey's office, a few days later. Someone knocks on his door.]
MR. MACKEY
Come in, m'kay.
KYLE
[opens the door and peeks in] Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?
MR. MACKEY
Oh-kay, have you set up a counseling appointment on IntelliLink?
KYLE
[goes all the way in] No.
MR. MACKEY
Ookay, that's fine, that's fine. We can use IntelliLink to see what's available. Let's see, counseling request. Students. Make appointment. [presses a key and his window blind goes down, and Kyle notices] Okay, ah whoops. Okay, uh sume, uh students make appoint-alala here we go. Make, make appointment. [presses a key and the lights go out. He looks around] Uhkay, here we go. Uhkay, what do you need counseling with?
KYLE
It's my little brother. He's really changing and I feel like-
MR. MACKEY
Okay, I'll click on family issues. What time did you want counseling?
KYLE
Right now.
MR. MACKEY
Oo-kay, aaand, what is your brother's Intelligrated smart name?
KYLE
I don't know.
MR. MACKEY
Alright, I can do a lookup for the name. Uh go back. Main menu. ["The Heat Is On" begins to play, and Mr. Mackey has lost control] Oh... Dammit. Okay now, back. [mumbles to himself as he tries to set things right] Set- no, set appointment. Okay, speakers off. [his blind rises] Okay, uh... Okay, what is your smart name, Kyle?
KYLE
What?
MR. MACKEY
Sorry, Kyle, we're gonna need to maybe go somewhere else. Uh... find an IntelliLink panel somewhere.
[The boys' restroom. Mr. Mackey is on the toilet with an IntelliLink panel to his left, on the wall]
MR. MACKEY
Okay, let's see, lights. [presses the light icon and some other icons pop up] Mood. [presses the mood icon and a timer pops up] Start counseling timer. [sets it for 15 minutes and starts it] Okay there we go. Okay, we got it. [smiles] Okay now, Kyle, you had some concerns about your little brother?
KYLE
[takes a moment to gather them] He's just... changing a lot. He walks around angry, telling me I'm stupid and, and all he talks about is sex.
MR. MACKEY
Well it sounds like he's hittin' puberty.
KYLE
Yeah, he just seems so young.
MR. MACKEY
Well, your brother is Canadian. Perhaps Canadian puberty is a little different. Why don't you educate yourself about Canadian puberty and it could be somethin' yeeyou and your brother can actually do together. M'kay? [plop] You know, this is the first time I've been able to do counseling aaand go to the bathroom at the same time. IntelliLink is amazing.
[A live program. The Canadian Board of Health Presents, "What Are These Changes?" A Guide To Puberty In Canada]
MINISTER
Hello young people, and welcome to the most fascinating time of your life. You have braved the trials of childhood, and now you are reaching Canadian puberty. By now, you've probably noticed some changes in your body. For instance, when you fart your dick gets hard. [a long pause] Other physical changes are happening to your body as well. If you're a boy you may notice that your testicles ache, or if you're a girl, you may notice a tingling sensation in your strange.
IKE
This is stupid, bro! I already know all this!
KYLE
Let's just give it a chance, Ike.
MINISTER
Going through Canadian puberty, you may notice that your voice is starting to change as well. You're saying things like "hey boddy" and "hey guy" because now that you're older you're discovering that someone who was once your buddy is now your guy, and someone who you used to call "guy" is quickly becoming your friend. [A shot of Kyle and Ike looking at each other] But now let's discuss how a man and a woman make love. [an animated stick-figure cartoon follows] First, a man and a woman fall in love. Then the man farts on the woman's strange, [That is shown, with audio] filling the woman's strange with air so that the woman can queef on the man's face. [shown, with audio] And, a baby is born. [pop] The entire process can take up to six months a- [turns to his right to listen...] It's what? ... That's not how a baby is born? ... What's semen? ... Well then, why did my wife queef on my face? ... She said it was to- ... [gets mad] Well then why would sh-?! ... I'm gonna get to the bottom of this! [pounds on the desk and leaves]
[The street, near his residence, day. The host marches home]
MINISTER
Make me look like an idiot, will you?!
[At home. The double doors open and the host comes in. His wife is sitting on the sofa sipping tea]
MINISTER
Ey! You told me you queefed on my face because because that's how babies are born!
WIFE
I was being sarcastic.
MINISTER
Being sarcastic?! I just told a million Canadian teenages that's how it's done!
WIFE
I was angry because you never listen to me. Because I wanted you to go with me to therapy and you never go.
MINISTER
Fine! You want me to go with you to therapy?! Fine!
[The host goes to a therapy session with his wife.]
MINISTER
Totally embarrassing and degrading! She queefed right in my face!
THERAPIST
Well, maybe you should spend less time at work making public health films and more time at home.
KYLE
What the fuck is going on?!
IKE
[hops off the sofa...] You're fucking stupid, Kyle! [...and walks away]
[South Park Elementary, day, Room 7. The class is in the dark listening to "All Night Long" again. Mr. Garrison his his fingers in his ears to block out the song]
KYLE
I don't know what else to do, dude. No matter what I try, me and Ike just seem to drift further apart!
STAN
He doesn't ever want to play with you anymore?
KYLE
He doesn't even let me near him!
CARTMAN
That sucks, dude.
KYLE
What??
CARTMAN
I said THAT SUCKS, DUDE.
KYLE
Oh, thanks! [Mr. Mackey is at the IntelliLink panel trying to set things right. The music stops and he stands up]
MR. MACKEY
Okay, there we go. That's cut the speakers off. Now what was it you were trying to do, Kyle?
KYLE
I was trying to make an appointment to see the principal about getting excused on Friday. So I can take my brother to go see Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
MR. GARRISON
Mr. Mackey, can he just go talk to the principal?
MR. MACKEY
No, this is gonna work! I called IntelliLink and they said they were sending over an engineer. [someone knocks on the door.]
CODY
[looks in] Is this Classroom 7?
MR. MACKEY
Yes!
CODY
My name's Cody. I'm your smartnician. You're havin' some intelliproblems with your astutelinks?
MR. MACKEY
Yeah, a student is trying to make an appointment to see the principal. M'kay?
CODY
[taps the screen a few times] Uh huh, well here's the problem: your amsrtnames aren't intelligrated. [shows him the error screen]
MR. MACKEY
Oh I see.
CODY
If you wanna have those intelligrated with EasyLink, you might wanna upgrade your system to the silver package.
MR. MACKEY
Uh, I I needed the silver package? Okay okay? Can we do that?
CODY
Let my call my supervisor on the intelliphone. [calls in]
[Ike's room, day. He's playing with his toy trucks - a fire engine and a dump truck. He crashes them into each other. Kyle knocks on the door and then enters]
KYLE
Hey Ike.
IKE
Get out of my room, Kyle! I'm playing trucks!
KYLE
Ike, I'm sorry, but I couldn't get us out of school Friday. I can't take you to Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
IKE
You promised!
KYLE
I couldn't get in to see the principal, Ike.
IKE
Well what am I supposed to do?! See it myself?! I'm a little baby! Who's gonna hold my fuckin' hand?! You don't give a shit about how I feel!
KYLE
Ike, I do! I just-
IKE
You just love pushing me around! Is that what you wanna do, Kyle?! Kick the baby?! Well alrighty bro! Come on, Kyle! Kick the baby! [Kyle just looks at him, Ike takes off his shirt] Come on bro! Kick the fuckin' baby! Let's see you try it, wuss!
[The Pepsi Center in Denver, day. Yo Gabba Gabba Live is starting. Next, a live performance of "Don't Bite People"]
PLEX
Hey Muno, what should we do now?
MUNO
Let's play Cool Cool Trick.
PLEX
Aaaall right! Who out in the audience has a cool cool trick to show us? [a line of kids is already in place. A boy steps forward] What's your name, little boy?
RYAN
My name is Ryan!
PLEX
And what is your cool cool trick, Ryan?
RYAN
My cool cool trick is that I can jump in the air. [the kids in the audience cheer. Kyle notices that Ike has left his seat] Let's see you... jump in the air! [Ryan jumps, and the troupe cheers him on. Ike cuts in line and steps forward]
PLEX
And what's your name, little boy?
IKE
Ike Broflovski.
PLEX
Do you have a cool trick?
IKE
Yeah, for my cool cool trick I'm gonna tame Foofa's strange.
PLEX
Tame mo what?
IKE
I can tame Foofa's strange, bro.
PLEX
Uhhh, alright. Let's see our friend Ike tame Foofa's strange! [Ike walks up to Foofa]
KYLE
[running towards the stage] Ike no! Stop!
PLEX
Oh, I see. You're actually- [shakes his head] Wait! Oh my God, what are you doing?! No no no! [parents in the audience quickly cover their kids' eyes] What are you doing to Foofa?! No!
[The green room, after the show. Kyle and Ike sit on a sofa flanked by two officers]
PLEX
Now you listen here, little boy! It is never okay to take off your clothes and grind on another person!
TOODEE
No, that's wrong!
PLEX
Don't do it.
BROBEE
Uh uh.
KYLE
We're so sorry. Please forgive my little brother. He's going through puberty.
MUNO
A little young for that, isn't he?
KYLE
That's what I thought.
IKE
This is stupid, bro. [takes out some chewing tobacco] Foofa shouldn't be limiting herself to little kids. She's fuckin' fine, dude. [puts it in his mouth]
PLEX
What you did was very traumatic for Foofa. Isn't that right, Foofa? [Foofa is frowning, but stays silent] Foofa?
FOOFA
He's right, Plex. We're getting older. I don't wanna do the little kid thing the rest of my life.
BROBEE
Foofa, what are you talking about?
FOOFA
It's time for us to start playing to older people. Maybe we need to be edgier. Have a little sex appeal.
TOODEE
Foofa, no!
FOOFA
I'm an artist. And if all I ever do is play to kids, then I'll be a joke. [turns around and walks towards the door] I have to move on. [walks out of the room]
PLEX
Oh God. What has this little boy done??
[A Canadian pub. The minister of health is sitting with an older man at table]
MINISTER
I try not to think about it, Rick. I try to just forget aboot it and then move on, but I can't. I mean... she queefed right in my face!
RICK
Have you and your wife seen a therapist together?
MINISTER
Yes, we went but... I just can't erase the memory of my helpless face being queefed on like that. Who's to say she won't do it again?
RICK
Don't you think this has something to do with your new job?
MINISTER
What do you mean?
RICK
There's more to this, Terry. A lady never queefs in her lord's face without some major cause. You started as the Canadian Minister of Health and three months later your wife queefed in your face. There's a connection.
TERRY
I took the job to try and make Canada's health care system better. What could that have to do with my wife?
RICK
Terry, I'm your friend. And I'm not just your friend, I'm also your boddy
TERRY
Thanks, guy.
RICK
[points a finger at him] And I'm telling you there's more to this than you think! [crosses his arms] And if you want to save your marriage, and your face, you need to figure it out quick.
[South Park Elementary Faculty Lounge, day. Principal Victoria has called a staff meeting, with Mr. Mackey as the man in the hot seat]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Mr. Mackey, so far the school has spent [reads the bill] $22,000 on the IntelliLink system, and so far it's been an unmitigated disaster.
MR. MACKEY
Well yeah, but see, the problem is not everyone is not everyone is signed on to it yet.
MR. ADLER
They can't sign on to it because every time they try they make the sprinklers go off!
MR. MACKEY
I know that IntelliLink has had some... hiccups... uhkay. But I've hired a new faculty member whose sole responsibility will be to oversee the IntelliLink system and make sure it runs smoothly. I want you all to meet Pat Conners. [she enters and takes a seat next to Mr. Mackey]
PAT
Hello everyone.
MR. MACKEY
[immediately points a finger at her] Don't "Hello" us, Pat! This system that you're responsible for now isn't working out! So [pounds his fist on the table] what the hell are you gonna do about it?!
PAT
Oh. Well, I'm just sort of getting acclimated to the situation and I-
MR. MACKEY
Getting acclimated?! [stands up in anger] Do you know how much money we wated on that thing?! How about you take some damned responsibility! Get the hell out of here, Pat! You're fired! Get out! [Pat takes her briefcase and walks out] Well. How the hell are we gonna clean up Pat's mess? I guess, I dunno, I guess we got no choice, m'kay. We're just gonna need to the upgrade to the IntelliLink Gold Package. [opens his laptop to show the splash screen]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh noo!
MR. MACKEY
No, see, it's a $10,000 upgrade, but it should clean up all of Pat's mistakes.
COACH
Mr. Mackey, let's be clear. IntelliLink was your idea. You should admit it was a bad one and stop being so defensive.
MR. MACKEY
Well ih it's good to be a little defensive around you, Miles, m'kay. Let's, let's not forget that your wife died of an "accident" while you were "drinking" on a "hike," "N'kay!"
MILES
Hey now listen here-!
MR. MACKEY
No! Now you listen to me! [pounds his fist on the table] IntelliLink is a great idea, and we just need the Goddamned Gold Package! We are doublin' down!
[E! News segment]
ANCHOR
[voice only] You're watching E! Entertainment News. God knows why. [video added] She's all grown up and she wants you to know it. From kids show star to sex symbol, Yo Gabba Gabba's Foofa is ready to rock! [a montage of Foofa magazine covers and poses] She's been seen out partying, photographed smoking pot, and now, Foofa has announced a raunchy performance on the MTV Video Music Awards. Foofa's new manager claims the MTV performance will be one for the record books.
IKE
[At a bar via satellite, drinking, smoking AND chewing tobacco.] Foofa's got that nice shaved strange that you just wanna get in and tame the second you see it.
ANCHOR
The video awards are at 8 pm tomorrow.
[The Broflovski living room, evening. Ike and Foofa are watching E! from the sofa.]
FOOFA
Oh this is so exciting!
IKE
Told you it'd go over well.
KYLE
[walks in from the kitchen and stares at both of them, then firmly says] Excuse me, but Ike has homework he's supposed to be doing.
IKE
Shut up, Kyle! Just ignore my little brother.
KYLE
I'm your big brother, Ike! [the doorbell rings]
IKE
Answer the door, twerp! [Kyle is angry, but there's not much he can do, so he answers the door. He sees Plex]
PLEX
Can I talk to you?
KYLE
I'm sorry, but right now I'm feeling-
PLEX
Foofa! [runs in, followed by the other Gabbas]
BROBEE
Thank you, dude.
MUNO
Oh thank God.
TOODEE
Heey.
KYLE
Hey!
PLEX
Foofa, what is this about you going on the MTV Video Awards?
FOOFA
I'm done being a kiddie star!
PLEX
Foofa, you don't have to show your strange to get attention.
IKE
You just don't get it 'cause you're a robot, Plex.
PLEX
Alright, you won't listen to us, but maybe you'll listen to our special guest, Sinéad O'Connor! [the rest of the troupe welcome her as she walks up to them]
SINÉAD
Don't do it, Foofa, Don't sell out your strange to those corporate bastards.
IKE
Awww, screw off, Sinéad O'Connor. No one gives a crap about you.
PLEX
Don't show your strange on TV.
TROUPE
Don't show your strange.
PLEX
Your strange is for your husband, not for all the world to see.
TROUPE
Don't show your strange on TV
SINÉAD
I'm looking for a boyfriend. Looking for a boyfriend.
KYLE
Will you get out of my living room, please?! [the phone rings and he answers it] Hello?!
TERRY
[calling in from Canada] ...Have you ever had someone you love queef in your face? [serves himself some Canadian port]
KYLE
What?
TERRY
I'm sorry, I'm calling everyone in the Canadian health care system to find out if they're pleased with their health care. Is this [checks his monitor] Ike Broflovski?
KYLE
No, this is his brother.
TERRY
Your brother receives his medication from us, so we just wanna be sure he's satisfied with the service.
KYLE
Satisfied with- [thinks a bit] Wait a minute. What medication?!
[Canadian Health Department, day.]
TERRY
Before this meeting continues, I should have you be aware that my face has tested positive for queefie sores.
KYLE
[confused] Ah I'm sorry, but I don't really care. I just want to know what medication my little brother has been getting from you, and why?!
TERRY
People all over the world get their medication from Canada.
KYLE
Yeah, but something is wrong with my brother and it might be your fault!
TERRY
That's impossible! The Canadian health care system is completely integrated and streamlined with IntelliLink. [this alarms Kyle]
KYLE
You use IntelliLink?? Oh my God! Will you check his records please?
TERRY
Sure, no problem. [gets to work] Now, what is your brother's Canadian Medicare's smartname?
KYLE
I dunno! [thinks a bit] Try "strangetamer."
TERRY
"strangetamer" [the lights go out, a window shade comes down] Uh, yep, there it is. [presses a key and the lights come on] Ahh yes, here we go. I see your little brother has a constipation problem and has been taking a daily laxative since last May. [check again] Ah, yes, I'm afraid IntelliLink mixed that up and your brother has been receiving large doses of hormones that were supposed to go to an athlete in the northeast.
KYLE
Are you saying that Ike has been given regular doses of hormones because of an IntelliLink screwup?!
TERRY
Yes, that's right.
KYLE
That system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc!
TERRY
It's fine! [pounds the table with his fists] It works fine! Just give it some time! [stands up] God, you sound like my wife! [turns left and walks away from the chair.] My... my wife.
RICK
[sitting in an armchair nearby] That must be it. Don't you see, Terry? That health care integration system has made you defensive and hostile, and your wife's been puttin' up with it.
TERRY
[thinking out loud, in a stammer] And... that's why she queefed in my face.
KYLE
Ex-cuse me?! If my little brother has been getting some athlete's hormones, then who has been getting Ike's medication?!
[A Patriots vs. Broncos game, day]
ANNOUNCER
Tom Brady looking sluggish again today. Not sure what his problem has been lately.
TOM BRADY
Blue 28! ... Blue 28!
COMMENTATOR
Yeah, definitely not looking as strong and virile as he has in the past, Tom.
TOM BRADY
[his pants begin filling with poop] Huthuuuut [more poop comes out. The more he says it, the more his pants fill with poop] Hike!
ANNOUNCER
Brady steps back to pass. [Brady makes sure not to trip over his poop] He's got an open man at the 40 yard line! [Tom throws the ball, but it goes straight to the ground]
COMMENTATOR
And whatever is wrong with Tom Brady just seems to be getting worse. [Exhausted, Brady just sits on top of his poop and then sinks into it] Go Broncos.
[South Park Elementary cafeteria, day. The sprinklers haved turned on and drenched everything. "The Heat Is On" plays on the PA system. Mr. Mackey sits on the floor in the same position Brady was in. The emergency lights flash on and off, and the kids are still eating lunch, despite being drenched. Suddenly, the music, lights, and sprinklers stop]
CODY
Okay, there we go. [Mr. Mackey lifts his head up, disgusted] Your students can buy school lunches now, but they won't be able to get grades.
MR. MACKEY
No, they have to be able to get grades!
CODY
Well, what you probably wanna do is upgrade to IntelliLink Platinum.
MR. MACKEY
No! There's no more upgrades, m;kay?! I just want this [points to a panel] to work!
CODY
...What exactly do you mean by "work"?
MR. MACKEY
I just want students to be able to make appointments to see the counselor, be able to see the school norse in the easiest, most streamlined fashion!
CODY
Oh, you want the Centurion package. That's where we take all the IntelliLink panels and we rip them off the walls and we burn them. Then we wipe all the computers of IntelliLink software and you never deal with us again.
MR. MACKEY
[walks away and thinks it over] Alright, upgrade me to the Centurion package.
CODY
Right away. [goes to Room 7 to rip off the panel from the wall as Mr. Garrison watches from his desk, goes to the bathroom and rips the panels off the walls, goes to the various school offices and tears the panels off there, makes a bonfire in a steel drum out on the playground, and dumps all the IntelliLink hardware into it. He returns to the cafeteria and joins Mr. Mackey again, offering him a clipboard] Well alright sir, here's a clipboard you can use for students to sign up for counseling, [Mr. Garrison takes the clipboard] and I wanna thank you for choosing IntelliLink. [reaches into his back pocket, takes out a gun, and blows his brains out. He falls down, dead. All the students as well as Mackey are stunned]
[The MTV VMAs, night]
ANNOUNCER
The MTV Video Music Awards will be back with a performance from Yo Gabba Gabba's Foofa singing, "Pound My Sweet Strange."
[backstage, Foofa and Ike wait for her cue]
STAGE HAND
Two minutes, Foofa.
FOOFA
Thanks. Oh my, here we go! [Kyle appears at the far end of the room]
KYLE
Ike! [runs up to him] Wait! [the rest of Yo Gabba Gabba show up]
IKE
Get out of here, dude!
KYLE
Ike, there's been a mistake. You don't understand.
IKE
No, you don't understand, wuss! Why can't you just let me grow up?! Why do you keep harassing me?!
KYLE
Because you're my little brother, Goddammit! [Ike is awed at this] And even when I'm fifty and you're forty-five, you're still gonna be my little brother!
HOST
All right, y'all, here comes our next big act!
KYLE
Ike, I don't care if you wanna grow up, I just wanna be by your side while you do it.
HOST
Give it up for the sexiest bitch on earth, it's Foofa!
FOOFA
Come on, Ike. Ike?
IKE
He's right, Foof. Part of growing up is rebelling, but I'm gonna get older whether I like it or not. So why push it? I think I'm just gonna let it happen naturally. [walks to Kyle and the troupe]
YO GABBA GABBA
Yaaaaay.
BROBEE
Foofa? [Foofa looks at the curtains, then at the group, then takes off her towel to reveal her domiatrix outfit, with two arrows pointing towards her strange, and walks out onto the stage]
FOOFA
Come on, come on, and pound my strange. Pound it like this, [Yo Gabba Gabba reacts. Brobee covers his eyes] pound it like that.
[Terry's mansion, day. He comes home, enters, and walks up to his wife]
TERRY
It was a mistake.
WIFE
What?
TERRY
Trying to reform Canada's health care system and being too stubborn to admit that it wasn't working. And even when my wife said the system was too complicated, I wouldn't listen.
WIFE
Oh Terry, I was just trying to get your attention. I'm sorry I queefed in your face.
TERRY
I deserved it. Anyone who thinks streamlining health care into an integreated health care system would go smoothly deserves a giant queef in their face. Thank you, my lady.
WIFE
So IntelliLink is gone, my lord?
TERRY
Yes, I've upgraded to the Gold package. Within no time, Canadians everywhere will be getting their correct medications, and going back to normal.
[The Broflovski house, just before dawn. Kyle is asleep, but is awakened by chortles of laughter from downstairs. He gets up and goes to see what's happening]
KYLE
Ike?
IKE
[back to his normal voice] Kyle! It's Dora the Explorer!
DORA
Come on, let's climb the mountain.
KYLE
It sure is. Do you want me to watch it with you, Ike?
IKE
Yaaay! [Kyle is pretty happy too, and joins him on the sofa]
DORA
We made it all the way to the top.
IKE
Oh man, I wouldn't mind hittin' that. I bet she's got that hot Puerto Rican strange. [Kyle's smile vanishes]
KYLE
Yeah, I bet she does.
IKE
Yaaaay!
End of Taming Strange


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Cartman's latest prank has brought about the necessary spiritual conditions for world peace. Religious leaders descend upon South Park to witness a Biblical prophecy that has been fulfilled. Cartman and Kyle are the only two at odds as the world embarks upon a thousand years of peace and harmony.

script:Ginger Cow

[Lunchtime at the South Park Elementary Cafeteria.]
CARTMAN
[walks in] Hey, everyone? Excuse me! [the other kids start to turn towards him] Everybody, can I just have a second of your time, please? Everyone, listen up. [finally has everyone's attention] Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle.
KYLE
About what?!
CARTMAN
I'm afraid that... Kyle and I got into a little disagreement yesterday. Yeah, yeah it's... pretty nasty. And um, I was totally wrong and you were right, Kyle. I thought only humans could be gingers. Is Davin here? Davin Miller? [a ginger boy with dark red hair leans to his left for a better view] Oh yeah, there you are. I own an apology to you too, Davin. When Kyle said that humans weren't the only species that can have light skin and freckles I totally laughed in his face. But it turns out Kyle was right: there are other animals that can be ginger as well I didn't believe it. I guess I didn't want to believe it, but this morning I saw a red-haired light-skinned cow and I owe you, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology.
CRAIG
Where did you find a red-haired cow?
CARTMAN
[crosses his right arm over his chest and points to the doors behind his left shoulder] Oh would you- Would you guys like to see it?
[a pasture, nearby. The class walks towards a pasture near the school. Cartman climbs to the top of the fence. Stan and Clyde pop their heads into the pasture for a better look. Kevin, and Kenny join Cartman on the second rung. The other kids stand behind the first rung.]
CARTMAN
There! There it is right there, see? A red-headed cow. [The camera turns right and stops at a cow with a Jewfro, glasses, a freckled face, and huge red polka dots on her body. Cartman laughs at his cleverness]
BUTTERS
Whoa, look at it!
CARTMAN
[giggling to himself] You were right, Kyle. A ginger cow. I shall never question your keen intellect again!
CRAIG
[takes out his phone and starts taking pictures] Wow, that's pretty trippy.
CARTMAN
Yes! Yeah, be sure to get some pictures of it! [Butters and Kevin take their phones out...] I'm pretty sure this occurs only rarely in nature! [Jimmy takes out his phone...]
KYLE
Alright, Cartman, joke's over. [Kenny takes out his phone]
CARTMAN
What? What joke? This is real!
KYLE
Tell everyone you made the cow look like that!
CARTMAN
No, [drops down to the ground] no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong.
BUTTERS
Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake.
CARTMAN
Thank you, Butters! [laughs to himself]
CRAIG
I gotta show this to my mom! [leaves, and the other kids disperse]
BUTTERS
Let's go get the kindergartners. Uh they're gonna wanna see this too! [leaves. Only Kyle remains with Cartman]
CARTMAN
Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good.
KYLE
Even the dumbest lie can have big consequences.
CARTMAN
Yes, you're right, Kyle. I'm sure that that... is going to have earth-shattering consequences. Heheheheh. [walks away]
[A montage of three news reports. The first one is from Al Aziz Network, where one of the news team members browses the Web for news. He's reading reports in various languages - Korean, then French. The French report gets his attention, "اه! این چیه؟" (Eh! What is this?) he calls some colleagues over and says ".اینجا رو نگاه کن! اوه، اینجا رو نگاه کن! می‌گه یه گاو ماده‌ی قرمز دیده شده" (Take a look! Hey, take a look! Says a red heifer was found.)
His colleague asks him "کجا این گاو قرمز ماده دیده شده؟" (Where was this red heifer found?) He replies with "این یعنی چی؟" (What does this mean?) when his colleague says "!زود باش! زود باش! ما اینو باید همین الان خبر بدیم" (Quick, quick! We gotta go public with this right away.) The scene changes to a broadcast with a voice-over ".هم‌اکنون اخبار را برای گزارش مخصوصی موقتا قطع می‌کنیم" (We interrupt this broadcast for a special report.) with a text on the screen which reads "اخبار دنیای ایرانی" meaning Persian World News with an Iranian news anchor reporting an irrelevant story ".مجلس مالزی منحل شد. مجلس این کشور را منحل اعلام کرد تا زمینه را برای انتخابات آماده سازد" (Malaysian parliament dissolved. The Parliament announced the dissolution of the country to set the stage for early elections.) He then reaches for a pistol under his desk and blows his brains out. Next are two Swahili reports covering the same report. The female reporter uses a pistol blows her brains out first, then the male reporter. The last scene has a Japanese reporter covering the report, but he has a dagger ready for seppuku. As he reports, he performs the seppuku, dying just as he ends the report. A colleague comes up and chops his head off with a katana, then uses a pistol to blow his own brains out.]
[South Park Elementary, Room 7. The kids are in their seats, and the PA system comes on.]
MR. MACKEY
Your attention, please. Will Kyle Broflovski report to the principal's office?
KYLE
Huh?
MR. MACKEY
Kyle Broflovski to the principal's office. Please. Umkay?
BUTTERS
Hohoh! What'd you do, Kyle?
KYLE
Nothing. [hops off his chair to leave the classroom]
BUTTERS
Busted!
[Principal Victoria's office, moments later. Kyle enters and closes the door, but notices three rabbis to his left.]
MR. MACKEY
Ah, thanks for comin', Kyle.
KYLE
Wuwhat's going on?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Kyle, these men have apparently come all the way from Israel to speak with me, but... we need a translator.
KYLE
[glances at the rabbis again] I don't speak Hebrew.
MR. MACKEY
Kyle, please try your best. It seems pretty important. [to the rabbis, in bad English] This.. boy... uhkay... is Jew. Uhkay? Jew... like you. Uhkay? Please... uh, please try... speak... to Jew.[Kyle looks at the rabbis]
RABBI 1
[sighs] We're just trying to tell them that we come on very urgent business. [Kyle looks back at Mr. Mackey]
MR. MACKEY
Anything?
KYLE
He said they come on urgent business.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Ohh, what does he need?
RABBI 2
Look, we believe that this school has something which is of the utmost importance to our people! We wish to see the red cow!
KYLE
The red- Oh come on, you can't possibly be here for that!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
For what? What did he say, Kyle?
RABBI 1
Please, you must understand! The fate of the world is at stake! [walks to his right and walks over to the window] The coming of a red heifer is the nost holy sign in all of Judaism. It signals the beginning of the End. It is not just our religion, but Islam and Christianity as well. They all agree on one thing. [turns around] That the red heifer means the End of Times.
MR. MACKEY
You catch any of that, Kyle? [Kyle looks at Mr. Mackey in disbelief]
[The pasture, moments later. Kyle leads the rabbis, Principal Victoria, and Mr. Mackey to the cow.]
KYLE
It's right over here by uh-
RABBI 2
Oh my holy shmear! [a group of Muslims is already bowing down to the cow. One of them notices him and tells him to get out. (!برو بیرون)]
RABBI 2
The Muslims! They beat us here! [hops the fence and charges at them. The other two follow suit.]
MR. MACKEY
[frantic] What's goin' on, Kyle??
KYLE
He said the Muslims beat them here- [to himself] God damn it!
RABBI 2
[arrives next to the cow] Step away! You all know what this means!
CLERIC 1
Yes! And you know you are about to die!
KYLE
Hold on everybody. This thing isn't even a-
RABBI 1
Don't touch it! [they all surround the cow, keeping Kyle and each other away from it]
[Some hours later, the police have arrived and cordoned off the cow, and put up barriers further out to keep everyone away from it. The growing crowd begins to clamor]
CARTMAN
[to a reporter] Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, "Hey, there's a redheaded cow outside; you should all see it."
KYLE
[trying to reach Cartman, but trapped by the crowd] Cartman, stop! You don't know what you're doing!
CARTMAN
I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles. [chuckles loudly]
KYLE
NOOOO!
RABBI 4
[arrives with a sheet of paper, and Rabbi 2 looks at it] The Muslims and the Christians are calling for a meeting to discuss the terms of war.
RABBI 2
Very well, let us meet to discuss how the world as we know it ends.
[The Airport Hilton, day.]
RABBI 1
Alright, so far we agree there'll be no automatic rifles, no shanks, and no chemical weapons.
CLERIC 2
If there can be no chemical weapons, then the Christians can use no nuclear weapons. [clamoring follows]
BISHOP
Come on, without nuclear weapons, what kind of final Armageddon is this gonna be?! [clamoring follows]
RABBI 3
But couldn't we agree on non-ballistic nuclear weapons only?
BISHOP
Yeah, I suppose that's fine.
CLERIC 2
That makes sense.
RABBI 1
Non-ballistic nuclear only. Alright. Now on to prisoners. Are we all agreeing to decapitations?
ISRAELI
Of course we are! What do you think this is?!
OTHERS
Yeah, come on! Just get to it!
CLERIC 3
Wait a minute, wait a minute! Has anyone noticed something? We are all in a room together. Talking. [walks to the front of the crowd] Has it occurred to anyone else that this prophecy, which amazingly is in all three religions, could actually be meant to bring us together?
BISHOP
[walks up to him] The prophecy says the red heifer signals the End. [joins him] Could it mean the end of... war?
RABBI 1
If the cow is sacrificed in Israel according to the prophecy, then perhaps it could bring about peace.
[Jerusalem, day. a wonderful view of the city. A helicopter comes into view with the ginger cow dangling from it. It arrives at the Temple and hovers over it. A few second later, the sling holding the cow is released and the cow falls onto the roof of the temple, dying on impact. The crows looks at the helicopter leave and then cheers]
[Anderson Cooper 360 news segment]
ANDERSON COOPER
After all the years of holy wars and hatred, a possibility for peace... in the Middle East. In the past 48 hours, Jews, Muslims, and Christians have met in Israel to sort out their differences. It may be a rocky road, but many say the chance for peace is real. And all because of a red cow, discovered by a young boy here in the U.S. [the doorbell rings and Kyle goes to answer it]We'll be back with more on these amazing developments after this. [Kyle opens the door and sees that it's Cartman]
CARTMAN
Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute?
KYLE
Yeah. [Cartman enters and Kyle closes the door]
CARTMAN
I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up.
KYLE
No shit!
CARTMAN
I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said "No." I owe you an apology and, I mean it.
KYLE
Well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-.
CARTMAN
[shakes his head] No! No, Kyle, you said that it's never for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle!
KYLE
Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don't you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace!
CARTMAN
But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank? [no reply] Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie.
KYLE
Dude, go to Hell!
CARTMAN
You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it! [picks up the house phone and starts punching]
KYLE
Wwwait. [Cartman stops]
[The kitchen, moments later. Sheila is washing dishes when Kyle and Cartman enter]
KYLE
Mom?
SHEILA
Hi bubbe.
KYLE
Mom, there's sssomething I need to tttell you.
SHEILA
What is it, Kyle?
KYLE
[looks down and to his right] You're a fat skank, Mom. [shuts his eyes. Sheila is shocked]
CARTMAN
[gasps loudly] Kyle! Oh my gosh, what did you just say??
KYLE
You're a fat skank, Mom, and your tits belong in a morgue. [turns and walks out. Cartman's jaw drops.]
CARTMAN
Ohh my God! [whips out his camera phone and feigns concern] Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always talk to you like that?
[South Park Elementary, next day. Cartman walks down the hallway, with Kyle trailing him, carrying his backpack and books]
CARTMAN
[reaching his locker] Yeah, come on over here. I got some more stuff in my locker, Kyle. [opens his locker and puts a book on top of the stack. Stan, at his neighboring locker, notices]
STAN
How come you're carrying Cartman's stuff?
KYLE
I just... thought it'd be nice.
CARTMAN
[puts another book on the stack] Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework, [puts a third book on the stack] gave me the soda from his lunch. [removes the second and third books he just placed on the stack] I think he's just really stoked on me for helping bring peace to the Middle East. [places the third book back on the stack] Right, Kyle? [puts the second book back in the locker]
KYLE
Yes sir.
CARTMAN
Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...?
KYLE
Yes. [sets Cartman's books and backpack on the floor, then walks to the middle of the hallway] I love Cartman's farts.
CARTMAN
You what??
KYLE
Yummy yummy yummy I want Cartman's farts in my tummy.
CRAIG
Dude, what the hell are you talking about?
KYLE
Yummy yummy yummy can I please Cartman's farts in my tummy?
CARTMAN
[walks up to him] Okay okay Jesus, uh, lay down on your back, Kyle. [Kyle does so, and Cartman backs up onto Kyle's face] Let's see what I can muster up here.
KYLE
Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy.
CARTMAN
Let's see. Oh! Oh! [farts, then gets off Kyle]
KYLE
[stands up] Yummy yummy thank you Cartman. [turns around and walks away. Cartman smiles. Stan and Kenny can't believe it]
STAN
[enunciating] What the fuck?
[Mr. Mackey's office. Someone knocks on his door]
MR. MACKEY
Come on in.
KYLE
[opens the door and walks in] Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?
MR. MACKEY
Wuh sure, Kyle. What's the matter?
KYLE
If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do?
MR. MACKEY
Well, Kyle, living with a lie is never a good thing. Okay. Could... could you maybe just tell me?
KYLE
[rubs his tears away] Okay okay... I love having Cartman's farts in my tummy. I love it. [Cartman sneaks a peek around the open door] I love it sooo sooo much.
MR. MACKEY
Well... why do you like his farts in your tummy?
KYLE
Because they taste so yummy. [his voice quivers, Cartman giggles from behind the door]
MR. MACKEY
Well Kyle, that's kind of odd. Uh, not sure how to help you with that.
CARTMAN
[enters and clears his throat] Oh, Mr. Mackey, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?
KYLE
Not if you... have some delicious farts for me.
CARTMAN
[small gasp] Kyle, are you sure?
KYLE
Please...
CARTMAN
Well alright. [farts into his left hand and cups it over Kyle's mouth, making sure the fart goes all the way in.]
KYLE
Yummy yummy.
MR. MACKEY
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.
[Jerusalem, evening. a huge crowd of people from all three Faiths of the Book cheers as a cleric, a rabbi, and a bishop sit at table onstage. Each has a symbol of his faith with him - the cleric has a cow bell, the rabbi has a candle, and the bishop has a chalice]
BISHOP
Today... begins the new Israel. [the cleric lifts up a cow bell and rings it, then sets it down] Today, we are all united as one. [the rabbi lights the candle] Chakam balada.
CROWD
Chakam balada! Chakam balada! [followed by lots of cheering]
RABBI 3
Now, let us celebrate under one symbol! [the clergy go their separate ways and the table sinks into the stage. After several peals of the bell, the floot the table was on returns to the stage as the three religious symbols combine to form... the Van Halen logo. Van Halen's music comes on and the stage lights go on. Eddie Van Halen takes the stage, followed by the rest of Van Halen, with David Lee Roth on mic]
RABBI
No way no waaay!
MUSLIM
Epiiic!
DAVID LEE ROTH
Hello Israel! [launches into "Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love"]
CNN REPORTER
The party is officially underway. Jews, Christians and Muslims have united, ushering ten years of Van Halen. [archived live footage follows] Out in the crowd, people are celebrating like never before. [nineteen seconds of footage and song follow] No doubt Israel is the happiest, rockingest place to be.
[Kyle's room, day. He's sitting on his bed, tortured. His eyes are closed]
STAN
Hey Kyle.
KYLE
Hey
STAN
Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too.
KYLE
I am happy, Stan. I'm thrilled.
STAN
...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?
KYLE
[gets emotional] I just do, Stan.
STAN
You like... how they smell? How they taste?
KYLE
Yes.
STAN
They're really that good?
KYLE
Yes.
STAN
Should I try them?
KYLE
NO.
RINGTONE
Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy.
KYLE
This is Cartman. I have to take it. [answers his phone] Hello?
CARTMAN
Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek?
KYLE
[keeping quite calm] I don't care.
CARTMAN
I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai?
KYLE
That's fine. [hangs up]
STAN
...Kyle, maybe you should get some help.
KYLE
Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be.
[The landing outside. Kenny waits for Stan to come out. Stan does this and closes the door]
STAN
I don't get it, Kenny.
KENNY
(Dude, maybe he's like mentally ill or something)
STAN
Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head.
[That night, Kyle is tossing and turning in his bed]
KYLE
No more. No more. Oh, come on, Cartman, no. No more. [begins to reject Cartman's farts in his dreams. A bright light appears and Kyle wakes up, then looks at the foot of his bed]
GOD
Kyle Broflovski.
KYLE
Huh? Who...? Who is that?
GOD
Why do you endure all the farts, Kyle?
KYLE
I... because the world is at peace. I must endure.
GOD
What you are doing... is the most awesome thing ever.
KYLE
I... I know.
GOD
Who else would take such torment?
KYLE
That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking.
GOD
You should like, shave your head and get all peaceful about it. Your sacrifice saves the world.
KYLE
Yes.
[Bathroom, next day. Kyle shaves all his hair off]
KYLE
I endure what I must for the sake of all humanity.
[Jerusalem, evening. During vespers, "Hot For Teacher" begins to play]
CNN REPORTER
[now in party mode - shirtless and with face paint on] What can this reporter say except that Israel freaking rocks! Things just keep getting better here, Tom. And in a few days, they'll be honoring the little boy who discovered the red cow, here on stage, and things are gonna go off!
[South Park Elementary, day. In the hallway, Kyle, now bald, is laying on the floor as Cartman sits on him again, trying to fart]
CARTMAN
You're gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle? [three quick farts]
KYLE
Yes! Yes I will!
CARTMAN
Huh? You comin'? [three more quick ones]
KYLE
Yes, whatever you want. [a longer fart]
CARTMAN
Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves tomorrow. [leaves, screen right. Kyle stands up]
STAN
Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world.
BUTTERS
Just stop, please.
KYLE
[dressed in gray pants and white tunic, no footwear] It's okay. Everyone, it's okay. Perhaps one day, you will all understand. What I do, I do because I care about each and every one of you. [walks away, screen left]
CRAIG
Well now he just sounds like a self-righteous asshole.
[Kyle's room, day. He's sitting on his bed, meditating. His eyes are open]
STAN
Hey Kyle.
KYLE
Hello, Stan.
STAN
Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop.
KYLE
There are greater things at work than what you understand.
STAN
If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it.
KYLE
I'm actually the complete opposite.
STAN
All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else!
KYLE
I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place.
STAN
See? You sound like a dick.
KYLE
[thinks a bit] I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own!
STAN
Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick.
KYLE
All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?!
[The landing outside. Kenny waits for Stan to come out. Stan does this and closes the door]
STAN
I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.
KENNY
(Huh? Like what?)
STAN
This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this!
[Jerusalem, eve, two days later. Van Halen finishes a song, and Rabbi 1 is at the podium]
RABBI 1
And now, let us honor the little boy who helped make all this happen, Eric Cartman, and his best friend, Fartboy. [Cartman and Kyle come out onstage to great applause. The rabbi gives Cartman the mic]
CARTMAN
Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy?
KYLE
Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?
CARTMAN
Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip.
KYLE
Yummy yummy I want your farts in my tummy.
RABBI 1
Uh excuse me, I'm sorry everyone, but apparently there's some breaking news in the United States.
[A satellite feed appears, with a reporter, Stan, and Kenny.]
REPORTER
We are in Colorado where the red cow was discovered, and apparently, two boys have shocking news that might change everything.
STAN
Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been [Stan's phone rings] So- sorry, hang on. [pulls the phone out of his jacket pocket and answers it.] Hello?
KYLE
Dude! Do not do this!
STAN
No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth!
KYLE
Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?!
STAN
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
MUSLIM 2
"Oh" what? [an Israeli throws up his hands in a shrug]
KYLE
I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan!
STAN
Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle!
KYLE
I'm not a dick, I'm like Gandhi!
STAN
You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all "Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!"
KYLE
Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry.
STAN
You should apologize to Kenny too.
KYLE
I'm sorry, Kenny!
KENNY
(That's okay, Kyle.)
RABBI 1
No, what is the new information?!
STAN
The red cow... I saw it too. Ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle.
KYLE
Hurray!
RABBI 1
Oh no, it was a miracle?
ISRAELI 2
Then, it's not true. The prophecy is not true! [rounds of disappointment as everyone starts leaving]
DAVID LEE ROTH
Wait, I thought we were all here because of the prophecy of a miraculous red cow!
RABBI 5
No, the prophecy is that one day, a fat child with a small penis would decorate a cow to look ginger, not that one would miraculously just fall from the sky. [Kyle is stunned that Cartman fulfilled that prophecy]
MUSLIM 2
I knew this was all too good to be true!
BISHOP
We are associating with these heathens for no reason!
CARTMAN
Small penis?!
[News break]
ANCHOR
The party's over. Muslims, Jews, and Christians are back at each other's throats, and Israel is once again a place of conflict, and turmoil
[A synagogue, day. Kyle is pleading his case with the rabbis]
KYLE
Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true!
RABBI 3
No it di'n't.
KYLE
Yes! It did!
RABBI 1
The prophecy was that a fat boy with a small penis would one day decorate a cow to look ginger. We should have known a prophecy like this... was too impossible to ever come to be.
KYLE
But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!
CARTMAN
No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems.
KYLE
But it's the truth!
CARTMAN
No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick.
RABBI 1
Sorry boys, but we've gotta get to our fight. There's a rumble at the Wailing Wall. [brings out a switchblade. Rabbi 2 has a shot gun, while rabbi 3 carries a bat]. They leave, and Kyle turns around
KYLE
Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.
CARTMAN
Cheer up, Kyle. I'm sure this isn't the first time someone who thought they were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts. Hey. How about we get a little dessert, help cheer you up? [puts his hand on his ass and farts on it, then puts whipped cream on it, with a cherry on top, and smothers it on Kyle's face. He then walks away. A few seconds later, the cherry falls off]
End of Ginger Cow

synopsis:The boys prepare to battle the crowds already lining up for the first official day of holiday shopping.

script:Black Friday

[South Park Mall, day. It's looking mighty impressive now. A large banner for Black Friday, November 29, hangs high above the main entrance. Winter is coming. A senior security guard paces back and forth while briefing the other guards about Black Friday madness.]
GUARD 1
The holiday season... is here, and Black Friday... is upon us. As you know, black Friday is the day shoppers go berserk for holiday deals. Last year, 26 people died, and 461 were seriously injured. [stops by a guard who lost his right arm, puts his right arm on the guard's left shoulder and closes his eyes for a moment, then moves on] This winter the mall is offering 80% off to the first thirty people in the store. [The guards shout out various responses] For you new recruits, perhaps you took this job to see just what the violence was like. [a closeup of a guard without a chin] Or perhaps you thought workin' Black Friday wouldn't be a big deal. [looks at Randy, who just smiles innocently]
RANDY
I'm just trying to earn some extra holiday cash.
GUARD 1
[ominously] Or maybe you're just too stupid to realize what you've gotten yourselves into.
CHIEF OF SECURITY
That's enough! [the other guards turn to see him, an old guard with a scar over his left eye, and his back to them] Our only chance of surviving this year's sale is by sticking together! Those of you who signed up are to be... commended. [turns around] But I warn you: do not underestimate the battle that's about to take place outside those doors! [the other guards stay silent, and he turns towards the front entrance.] Winter is coming.
[Neighborhood, day. Cartman the Wizard walks down the sidewalk and on to Kenny's house. He knocks three times with his walking stick, and Kenny opens the door.]
CARTMAN
Good evening, sir. I'm calling together all the fighters of Zauron. I need to speak with Lady McCormick.
KENNY
[looks around the living room] (She's not here right now.)
CARTMAN
Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it.
[The Great Hall, day. A bunch of boys in costumes are downstairs in Cartman's basement. As the boys talk amongst themselves, Cartman calls the meeting to order with three taps from his walking stick.]
CARTMAN
Thank you all for coming. Prince Tolkien, Sir Timmy of Blacklake, Lady McCormick [Kenny plays with the hair on his wig and mumbles coyly]. Warriors, we have fought many great battles together. At Clyde's house. At Scott Malkinson's house. But soon we will be fighting the greatest battle of our young hot lives. Winter is coming, and the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves.
CLYDE
Which nobody can afford.
CARTMAN
What if I were to tell you that if we all worked together there's a way we can get the new gaming system.
TOLKIEN
If you know of a way, wizard, then speak.
CARTMAN
I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday.
BUTTERS
Woo, spooky.
CRAIG
Black Friday? Come on, that can't be real.
CARTMAN
It is real, Craig! I saw it on the news, butthole!
STAN
[stands on his chair] It is real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have?
CARTMAN
On our own, none. But if we plan, strategize, and fight together! [pounds the table with his left fist] ...We can be the first people inside on Black Friday. And use the 80% to get the gaming system we need to survive.
[A news show, with a female anchor and a male anchor.]
MALE ANCHOR
Well it's almost Thanksgiving, and we all know what that means.
FEMALE ANCHOR
That's right. Black Friday is right around the corner.
MALE ANCHOR
Ouch.
FEMALE ANCHOR
And people are already gearing up. [cut to shoppers]
SHOPPER 1
[obese man with only one tooth] We usually start linin' up around 3 am. We uh douse ourselves in pig blood, because it does help us slip through the crowd when the doors open.
SHOPPER 2
[with his family] We do it every year, part of the family tradition. Last year we lost our youngest daughter. Her head was stepped on and crushed, but, in her memory, we're going to find a young girl and step on her head this year.
SHOPPER 3
[an angry obese woman with two fat kids behind her] If anyone thinks they're gonna beat me inside that mall, and keep me from gettin' [points to her younger kid] my kids Christmas presents, they can kiss my fat vagina, 'cause I'm bringin' the motherfuckin' pain! [bares her teeth]
REPORTER
Tom, the South Park Mall says they've beefed up security in an effort to reduce the number of fatalities this year. One thing's for sure, people take Black Friday very seriously.
[Cartman's house, night. The segment begins with a grinder honing a wooden sword. Panning out, Scott Malkinson is shown operating the grinder for Jimmy, who's waiting on his sword. Scott finishes and hands the sword to Jimmy, who begins to wield it. Other boys, including Stan and Kyle, are paired off and shown sparring with their swords. Tweek and Tolkien try their hands at archery, trying to strike dummies with arrows.]
CARTMAN
[walking around, surveying his knights] Yes. Yes, very nice. Good.
BUTTERS
[runs up with a sheet of paper and hands it to Cartman] Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord! [salutes with his left hand]
CARTMAN
[flatly, but sternly] They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters.
BUTTERS
[lowers his hand] Uh, sorry, I haven't watched it yet.
CARTMAN
Okay, we need to start immediately, please. [clears his throat and reads] Ah, very good. The House of Greyhawk has agreed to join our fight!
STAN
The House of Greyhawk?
KYLE
Larry and Brad Stoltsky
CARTMAN
But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid?
CLYDE
[raises his left hand] Hey yeah, I know. [lowers it] How about we ask those kids who play Star Trek?
CARTMAN
Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They're dorks, and I'm not playing with them.
[South Park Mall, day. Under cloudy skies, a lone guard sits near the entrance, drinking from a metal flask.]
RANDY
[walks up] Hey, [notices the flask] that's what I'm talkin' about. You got any extra of that? [the guard shares his flask] Oh, thanks! [sits down near the guard] Gets a little boring around here, you know? [takes a swig from the flask]
GUARD 2
Enjoy the boredom while you can.
RANDY
So you worked here last winter? You worked on Black Friday? [hands the flask back to the guard]
GUARD 2
I did.
RANDY
Is it really as bad as they say it is?
GUARD 2
The shoppers... Hm... They started showing up at midnight on Thursday... They... didn't line up, they just crammed themselves near the main entrance... I can see their faces smooshed up against the glass, licking their lips, waiting to get in... God, the sounds that they made... It was 5 am when they opened the doors... There was screaming... blood... people... tearing each other's faces off while holiday music played in the background... I saw a woman... pick up her daughter by the ankle and swing her into some old guy's head... Before I knew it they were all around me... fighting, clawing. Then a hand reached in and pulled me out. Old Cap. He saved us all that day. [A shot of the chief of security] When it was over... the front of the mall was... covered in red. Bodies... shopping bags... [a shot of the banner again] And now winter comes again. [after a few seconds of reflection, he quickly drinks the rest of the flask]
[Downtown South Park, day. Cartman and Butters are walking]
BUTTERS
Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones.
CARTMAN
Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?
BUTTERS
Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?
CARTMAN
What do you mean?
BUTTERS
Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?
CARTMAN
Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters.
BUTTERS
Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all.
[Cartman's backyard, evening. The boys are back practicing their swordplay. Cartman and Butters step through the sliding door onto the yard]
CARTMAN
We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us! [the boys cheer this good news]
KYLE
Those XBox Ones are as good as ours!
BOYS
Yeah!
CRAIG
Wait, wait. What are you talking about, XBox Ones? [everyone's smiles vanish]
CARTMAN
That's what this is all about, Craig. We're all trying to get XBox Ones on Black Friday.
CRAIG
I thought we were getting Playstation 4's.
CARTMAN
[chortles] What?
JIMMY
M ma um m-me too.
CARTMAN
...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I was obviously talking about XBoxes.
KYLE
Yeah.
JIMMY
Eh but I want a PS4, not a crappy XBox.
KYLE
Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system.
CARTMAN
That's right.
KYLE
If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine.
CRAIG
Right. Let's all get PS4s.
KYLE
[taken aback] No, the XBox's are gonna be better.
TWEEK
They're not better, they're just more expensive.
CARTMAN
We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final!
CRAIG
[angrily] That's exactly how XBox people are!
JIMMY
Yeah!
CARTMAN
Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine!
CRAIG
We're still gonna fight on Black Friday, just not with you!
CARTMAN
[thinks for a moment] Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it?!
CRAIG
Everyone who wants to get PS4s, join with us! [Fosse joins Craig and Tweek, followed soon after by Jimmy and two other boys. Bill and Jason join them as well, while Scott joins the XBox group]
KYLE
No! We can't divide like this! [Stan leaves the XBox group] Stan? [Stan turns around] You're on our side, right?
STAN
I like the PS4's controller better.
KYLE
[stunned, then] Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One.
STAN
[tears welling up] The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because... [gets mad] because that's how XBox people are.
KYLE
[determined] Then I guess I'll see you on Black Friday.
STAN
[determined] If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside.
KYLE
I know.
CARTMAN
[walks up to Kyle] Come on, Kyle. Let these Sony fucks wallow in their limited voice-control functionality. [turns around and walks away with the XBox group, with Kyle joining him. A shot of the mall as day turns to night]
[The Marsh house, night. Randy comes home from work as a mall security guard]
RANDY
[singing to himself] Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat. [opens the front door and enters, closes the door and sets the keys on a small table] Please to put a penny in the old man's-
SHARON
[waiting for him by the sofa, with her arms crossed] What the hell are you doing?
RANDY
[stops] Oh hey Sharon. You're up, huh? I uh... alright, look: I took a temp job at the mall. I just wanted to make some extra holiday cash.
SHARON
Bullshit.
RANDY
I did, Sharon. [begins walking past her] I saw they were hiring extra security, and I thought it'd be a good way to make money.
SHARON
[stands up and follows Randy for a few steps] You're doing this to try and get to the front of the line on Black Friday, aren't you?
RANDY
[goes onto the first stair step and thinks of his reply, then turns around] Nobody else has thought of it, Sharon. I won't even be out in the crowd. I'll be on the inside when the doors open. While everyone is trying to run over each other, I'll turn around and run right into the stores. I'll be the first to get whatever I want!
SHARON
Isn't Black Friday supposed to be about buying things for other people?
RANDY
Winter is coming, Sharon, and I'm a sneaky little bee. [flaps his right hand like a wing] Bzzz bzzz. [goes on up the stairs]
[A Trekker's room. The room is furnished to resemble the bridge of the Starship Enterprise. A Vulcan sits in the captain's chair. Star Trek: TOS music plays]
ENSIGN
Thrusters are at 20%, captain.
KEVIN
Engage, ensign. Warp factor 1.
DOUGIE
Captain, we have an incoming FaceTime request from Eric Cartman.
KEVIN
On screen. [the monitor on the floor lights up and Cartman is seen.]
CARTMAN
Oh uh, hey guys, what's up?
KEVIN
Nothin' much. We're just about to check out a Class M planet that might have new sources of trillurillium.
CARTMAN
[to Clyde] God these guys are such dorks!
CLYDE
Just find out who they're loyal to.
CARTMAN
[performs the Vulcan sign for goodbye] Uh yeah, big dong and prosper. Um, listen guys, uh, uh, you're XBox people, right?
KEVIN
Given the XBox's faster frame rate, we have no choice but to declare it the most technologically fit for Starfleet.
CARTMAN
[to Clyde] Oh my god they're so gaaay! [to the Trekkers] Um, kewl. What if I were to tell you that we have a way for you to join us in getting XBox Ones super cheap.
DOUGIE
Cheap XBox Ones? For real?
[Cartman's backyard, moments later. Cartman comes out of his house with Clyde in tow.]
CARTMAN
The Federation has agreed to fight with us! [the group gathers at a round table] With them and the kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size! [Kyle sadly nods in acknowledgement] You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, don't you, Sir Kyle?
KYLE
I don't know.
CARTMAN
You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don't think with logic. He betrayed us. And now we must out-Game of Thrones him by making powerful alliances.
BUTTERS
Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener. [closes his case by crossing his arms]
CARTMAN
[with his right hand over his nose] Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners.
BUTTERS
I'm obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO?
KYLE
This isn't helping us, Butters!
CLYDE
The Sony people might not be our biggest problem.
KENNY
(What do you mean?)
CLYDE
Twitter says they're introducing a new Elmo doll this Christmas.
CARTMAN
What new Elmo doll?
[The Elmo Doll commercial. What's the GIFT children as asking for this HOLIDAY season?]
ELMO
[pops into view] Heheh, who, me?
ANNOUNCER
[a blonde girl unwraps her gift] Just in time for the holidays, it's Stop Touching Me Elmo. [the girl shows him to the camera] When you press his back, Elmo puts his hand on your knee and says fun things. [a boy demonstrates this]
ELMO
Have you ever been tickled on the inside? [next, the blonde girl is asleep with it] I'm lonely. Are you lonely? [she wakes up. Next is a boy in his own bedroom room] Can I watch you go potty? [the boy looks at the doll. Next is a brunet girl with curly hair] You wanna kiss the guy who does Elmo's voice? [the doll puts his hand on the girl's knee. This alarms her]
GIRL
Stop touching me, Elmo! [swats his arm away. He tries again and she stops him sooner. He tries again...]
ANNOUNCER
Elmo also helps kids brush their teeth with his toothpaste dispenser. [a shot of a boy putting toothpaste onto his toothbrush from Elmo's groin]
ELMO
More! More! More! Aaaghghgh.
ANNOUNCER
Don't miss out on this holiday season's biggest gift! Stop touching me, Elmo!
ANNOUNCER 2
Available at South Park Mall staring Black Friday.
[South Park Mall, day. Randy arrives with some coffee and sees some other guards]
RANDY
Morning, Joe, Marcus.
GUARD 3
Morning, Randy.
OLD CAP
What madness is this?? [Randy and the other two guards walk over.]
RANDY
What is it?
OLD CAP
[reads from an announcement] A new Elmo doll. They're releasing a new Emo doll [rolls up the announcement] just in time for Black Friday.
GUARD 3
Oh Christ, no!
OLD CAP
You've murdered us! [looks up at some business people in front of a Toy Safari store] You soulless monsters, you've killed us all! [some knocking is heard from the main entrance. The guards look to their right and see the crowd beginning to form outside]
GUARD 4
Oh, God, they're already lining up.
SHOPPER 1
Eelllmoooo
GUARD 3
No! They can't line up this soon! This is crazy!
OLD CAP
I'll deal with these demons! [walks towards the entrance, opens the doors, and walks out. The doors close and he addresses the crowd] If you are here for Black Friday, the line starts on that side of the rope. [shows them the rope. which has a small sign saying "BLACK FRIDAY LINE" on one of the poles]
SHOPPER 4
Oh. This rope right here? [walks over to the rope. The rest of the crowd follows him and stand behind the rope]
OLD CAP
That's the line for Black Friday, so other people can do normal shopping today.
SHOPPER 4
Oh. Okay. Thanks. [Old Cap goes inside and the shoppers resume knocking on the glass walls.]
SHOPPER 4
Elmooo.
SHOPPER 5
Give me Elmo.
[South Park Elementary, day. Stan leads Jimmy and Craig to the Goths' hangout at the side of the school]
STAN
We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s?
MICHAEL
Are you for real?
JIMMY
You know that the PS4 is a better choice. I mean, come on.
MICHAEL
Of course we're going to go with the PS4. They're blacker!
STAN
Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall!
PETE
Uhhh, we're just gonna wait until the PS4s become cheaper and more available.
STAN
No, you can't do that!
JIMMY
Ya yo you can't, you can't do that.
STAN
Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS.
HENRIETTA
What's Betamax?
STAN
Exactly!
PETE
What's VHS?
STAN
...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in!
MICHAEL
Sorry, I guess we just don't care enough.
JIMMY
Come on, Sir Stan. There must be kids somewhere who will join us. [turns right and walks away. Craig follows, and Stan looks at the floor, saddened]
[A lush garden, night. Cartman and Kenny walk through it. Kenny is caressing a mouse]
CARTMAN
Lady McCormick, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle.
KENNY
(Yes. What's up, my lord?)
CARTMAN
I'm not sure if his heart is in the right place. If he were to ever... [picks out a yellow rose and gives it to Kenny] switch sides, [Kenny sniffs it] it could make Stan's army problematic for us.
KENNY
(But Stan and Kyle are best friends)
CARTMAN
True, but we can't let Kyle come in the way of what's rightfully ours. [stops and faces Kenny] Let's face it, Lady McCormick, this is really about you and me getting XBox Ones. The others are simply there to... help us get inside those doors.
KENNY
[strokes his mouse] (Yes. That's right.) [they resume the walk]
CARTMAN
You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other?
KENNY
(Yes, I believe we do.)
THOMPSON
Hey, you damned kids! [Cartman and Kenny turn to face the voice, which turns out to be a man looking out his bedroom window on the second floor of his house] Get the hell out of my yard!
CARTMAN
Fuck you, dude! This is the Garden of Andros!
THOMPSON
No, it's my damned garden and I'm sick of you kids dressin' up and havin' talks of betrayal in it!
[The mall, night. The mall is closed, and Randy makes the rounds, buzzing to himself. He stops by RadioHut to check out the specials]
RANDY
Seventy-inch television. Huh that would be good. Oooo, but 80% off a computer. Huh, maybe I'll be able to snag both.
VOICE
Doin' alright there, Rookie? [A hand falls on Randy's left shoulder, startling him]
RANDY
Whoa! Haha. [recognizing Old Cap] Yes sir!
OLD CAP
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
RANDY
No, I was just uh, looking at all these great things I can't afford, heh.
OLD CAP
Listen, uh... I know why you took this part-time job.
RANDY
You-d, you do?
OLD CAP
I see it in you. You care about people. [smiles] Same reason I do it every year. [takes Randy for a walk] You remind me of my son. He died on Black Friday in '89. Guess I'm still trying to save him. [stops] Look, I just want to say I... I really appreciate what you're doing. I promised my wife this would be my last Black Friday I worked. When I see folks like you, it... makes me hopeful that people will still be okay.
RANDY
[going with it] Yeah... awesome...
OLD CAP
No, damn it! [noticing something outside] No lining up behind the velvet rope! [goes towards the entrance] God they just don't listen! [Randy sighs and buzzes to himself more soberly]
[The PS4 army's tent, night. A soldier is keeping watch next to the tent]
JIMMY
C-C-Cartman's army is getting bigger every day. In addition to the Federation and the kindergartners, the XBox army now also has the kids who play Harry Potter, the jocks, the swim team, and the glee club.
CRAIG
Word is that the sixth graders all prefer XBox too, and will team up with Cartman as well.
STAN
And who do we have on our side?
JIMMY
Uh besides us, it's the book club and Janice Pinkerton.
STAN
Did you ask the Vamp kids?
CRAIG
They're still undecided.
STAN
[walks towards the tent's entrance] There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side. [looks at the campfire outside, around which sit Tweek and two other boys]
BOY
Playstation...
JIMMY
Look, Sir Stan, it's probably time to give this up.
CRAIG
We're just a dying breed, Stan. XBox is going to win this whole thing.
STAN
So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest?
[Sony Corporation, Japan, night. The head of the corporation is humping a woman from behind on his desk, in his office. Two board members arrive and one of them clears his throat.]
CORPORATE HEAD
Huh? Isogashii yo! [I'm busy!"]
MEMBER 1
Sorry to disturb you sir, but we thought you should see this. [pulls out a flier]
CORPORATE HEAD
[gets down from his desk and puts on his robe] Omae-ya kikei ["You freak"]. [the woman gets off the table and skulks away while the corporate head walks to the board members] Jishu, taihen ne. ["Geez, how dreadful"]'[takes the flier and looks at it. It's a flier Cartman had made up and distributed everywhere, even Japan] Winter is comingu. Choose side-o. Nani kore? ["What is this?"]
MEMBER 1
Just a small down in Middle America, but apparently, a war is escalating.
MEMBER 2
Sir, if this were to become a news story, and if the first people inside their mall all got XBoxes... well it clearly looks bad for our image.
CORPORATE HEAD
[looks more closely at the flier] So desu ne... ["I see..."]
[South Park Mall, day. A Channel 9 News reporter is on camera]
REPORTER 2
What's going to be the big item everyone goes for this Black Friday? It just might be the PlayStation 4. Sony has just announced they offering a special Black Friday bundle, called the "Brack Friday Bunduru," which will include four controllers, a map of Japan, a hundred dollar rebate, and, allow you to automatically pre-order for Metal Gear Solid V. No doubt Sony has just raised the stakes.
[Cartman's backyard, day. There are more kids in the yard now, all honing their skills for the coming battle. Cartman walks among them]
CARTMAN
Yes. Good, Federation kids. You're learning to fight with your hands! Keep pushing, kindergartners! [walks further along to Kyle, who's sitting on a tree stump.] Sir Kyle, I know that Sony's offering a special Brack Friday Bunduru. You know the XBox is still better, right?
KYLE
Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?
CARTMAN
Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn't mean shit, okay? When you pre-order a game, you're just committing to paying for something that some assholes in California haven't even finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth.
[South Park Mall, day. The crowd at the Black Friday line has gotten bigger and the clamoring has gotten louder. Randy is keeping the peace.]
RANDY
Alright, listen up. [the crowd quiets down] The mall is no longer allowing people to line up for Black Friday until Thanksgiving night. [the clamoring resumes] It's okay. To hold places in line we're handing out wristbands. [the crowd knocks down the rope and overwhelms him] Augh! Hold on! Oh God!
SHOPPER 6
Wristbands!
OLD CAP
[sees the commotion and arrives to restore order] Back! Back, all of you! [the other guards come to help out] If that's how you are, there'll be no wristbands! No go! [delivers a left jab to a woman in front of him]
SHOPPER 7
Oh!
OLD CAP
Back away! [Shopper 1 comes up behind him and stabs him]
SHOPPER 4
I'm getting my son that Elmo doll, you fuck! [pulls the knife out and rushes away. Old Cap collapses]
RANDY
No! [runs to Old Cap's side as more guards exit the mall. Randy reaches him first, and the other guards gather around them]
OLD CAP
You did good. The watch is yours now.
RANDY
No! You can't die! Everybody really likes you!
OLD CAP
This is what we signed up for. Right, my friend?
RANDY
No, I was lying to you! I took this job... to be at the front of the line on Black Friday.
OLD CAP
Heh. Now you know how serious this is. Whatever your intentions before, protect this town. You are in charge now. Take this. [puts his hand over his left eye and... pulls off what turns out to be an adhesive eye patch and places it on Randy's left eye] Don't let... Black Friday... be the end. [dies. The other guards stay around, not knowing what to do]
RANDY
[rises] Get back inside. We have work to do. [the guards file back into the mall]
[A backyard, night. Its surroundings are a bit shabby - an overflowing trash can, an old lounge chair... Stan is facing Craig and Jimmy, and a few seconds later, turns around]
STAN
When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own! [the army is shown, and it includes the Goths, the Vamps, the handicapped kids, and some first graders. The house behind them only has one story, and it looks run down. A security grill is falling off one of the windows and the fence is in tatters. The army cheers for itself] I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided. [more cheering. A familiar figure sits on a throne...] Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4! [he turns around and unsheathes his sword, raising it to honor the new leader]All hail the Princess! [points the sword at her, and more cheering follows. Princess Kenny, Lady McCormick, has arrived]
PS4 ARMY
The Princess! Yeah! [a mouse crawls into view, on the Princess's left shoulder, and roars]
End of Black Friday


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Black Friday is almost here and the battle for the new gaming devices is heating up. Princess Kenny’s betrayal has left Cartman out for revenge.

script:A Song of Ass and Fire

[Kenny provides a recap of what happened last week on the show, with clips from that episode.]
KENNY
Previously, on South Park.
[The intro follows with the boys dresses as fantasy figures, and dramatic music matches them. Next, a white screen appears, with a silhouette of a black wall and a crow on it. The crow calls out]
NARRATOR
Now let me tell you, child, of a war that is about to come. [turns out the wall is the two consoles over which the war will be fought - the PS4 and the XBox - and the crow is on the display for the XBox One.] Since time unremembered there have been two. [the crow hops from the XBox One display to the PS4 display] One dark and unforgiving, the other pure and filled with light. [next is a silhouette of a woman looking at South Park Mall from a pile of rocks] At the dawn of war, I stand alone, looking out at would be the last battlefield, for winter is coming, and I... am a princess. [the woman is Princess Kenny] Once a common lady of the dark army, but, denied my right to be called princess by birth, [Kenny hops off the rocks and walks] I've betrayed my kind, [Kenny enters EVGames] and now I have chosen my side: that which I believe is best for all, [Kenny flips through the games and chooses Vomit Cops, then plays it] for it has the dual-shock controller with a speakers and a touchpad interface. [Kenny walks home] Our land is split in two, brother against brother, friend versus friend. [enters his house and walks past his parents] My parents will fight on Black Friday as well. For what? I do not know.
STUART
What the hell is he wearin' now?
NARRATOR
[walks out to the back yard and sits on her throne] My followers, though few in number, shall help see me through until I am finally accepted as a princess by all. I cannot rest, for I know that even now, the enemy is training for battle, also preparing for winter. [a mouse is seen on the Princess' left shoulder]
[XBox One army base, day. As the rest of the army watches, Butters and Scott do some swordplay. Scott's tongue is hanging out of his mouth]
SCOTT
En garde! [Butters takes up his sword and swordplay resumes. While the crowd cheers the swords-boys on, Cartman is not impressed, and he buries his nose in his hand while squeezing his eyes shut]
CARTMAN
Alright, stop, stop, stop! [leaves his chair and walks up to Scott and Butters] This is NOT how you fight! You think this is a joke?! On Black Friday, there's gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall keeping you from getting Xbox Ones! So what do we do?! We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spots! Scott Malkinson has diabetes, so we hit him in his weak spot! [swings his staff at Scott's mouth and lands it, making Scott's tongue go back in his mouth]
SCOTT
Aaah God ow sorry...
CARTMAN
There's another army out there who thinks they're better than us, and we are not going to be beat by that traitor whore Kenny! Get back to training! [leaves]
BUTTERS
[not sure what to do next, then swats Scott on his back] Yeah!
SCOTT
[falls onto his knees] Ah!
KYLE
[catches up to Cartman] Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances.
CARTMAN
The men are just inexperienced, Sir Kyle. They need more training.
KYLE
It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday.
CARTMAN
That Goddamn traitor! You know why Kenny's doing this, right? Because he wanted to be a princess, and I wouldn't let him! [they go through the sliding door] I said, "You can be a chick, Kenny, but there's only one ruler, and that's me!" [reaches his refrigerator and opens it, looking for something to consume]
KYLE
Sony released the PS4s, Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them.
CARTMAN
[turns around, holding a glass of milk] I guarantee you Kenny had something to do with Sony offering a Brack Friday Bunduru! [takes a swig of it] Just keep them in training, Sir Kyle. Two can play at Kenny's backstabbing game. [leaves, forgetting to close the refrigerator door]
[Cartman's room, moments later. Cartman is at his desk placing a call, still grousing about Kenny]
CARTMAN
Stupid asshole! [looks at a picture of himself and Kenny at Casa Bonita putting their arms around each other, with dreamy expressions, as they used to be best buds. He folds it up and lays it on his desk, face down] Yes, hello. I'd like to speak to the president of XBox, please... The president of XBox, like, the head of XBox... Fine, CEO of Microsoft, whatever. Put him on. I need help blowing up PlayStation people... Eric Cartman. I'm a wizard and a king... A wizard-king, yes... No, I'm not king of wizards, I'm a king that happens to be a wizard. [lost his patience] Just put the CEO of Microsoft on the phone!
[Microsoft headquarters, night. The CEO's office. Steve Ballmer is at his desk]
SECRETARY
Mr. Ballmer, John and Dave from Marketing are here to see you. [the men come on in]
BALLMER
Yes, hello. How are things going out there?
JOHN
Sir, the tides of war are changing.
DAVE
There's a king in Colorado, a young wizard who believes that Sony will have the upper hand if we do not come to his aid.
JOHN
He claims that with our help, his followers are prepared to fight to the death over which system is better.
BALLMER
Uhh, what are you guys talking about? You sound ridiculous.
DAVE
[looks at John, then] There's... going to be a war in this small town on Black Friday, and it's all over the news!
BALLMER
Guys, these are console wars, not some epic battle for a kingdom. I mean, come on.
DAVE
...but, this one kid said that he's a wizard, and that Sony is helping-
BALLMER
Guys, guys guys! It's just a video game machine, alright? Microsoft's a company that... tries to be above all the petty commercialism, okay?
DAVE
Ok-Okay.
JOHN
Okay. [they turn and leave]
[The Channel 9 newsroom. The anchors are reporting]
TAMMY
Well, Black Friday is still a few days away, but it looks like it's already claimed another fatality.
TOM
Niles Lawson is on the scene, and Niles, what are you hearing?
NILES
[holding in his left arm a giant candy cane, with blood stains along the hooked end] Tom, tragedy stuck last night when mall security officer Miles "Happy" Davis was beaten to death with this candy cane after telling a mother she couldn't line up for Black Friday until Thursday night. In honor of the slain mall security officer, the mall has officially decided to drop another 10% off Black Friday deals!
[The Wall of Honor, established in 1974. A framed picture of the slain officer is placed on a shelf on the wall, and a small bouquet of flowers placed in front of that]
RANDY
Happy was a good man. Too good to have died in such a brutal but festive manner.
GUARD 3
[runs up to Randy] Captain! Captain! The mall is dropping the Black Friday sale another 10%.
GUARD 4
What?
GUARD 5
Oh my God.
GUARD 6
They can't do that!
GUARD 7
What? That's 90% off!
GUARD 8
Oh God! They're back! The shoppers are back! [the camera pulls back to reveal a large crowd of shoppers slowly moving towards the mall. One of them holds a flyer for the new Black Friday deal. The fog is so low it looks soupy]
RANDY
Everybody stay put! I'll handle this. [exits the mall]
[Outside the mall, night. The crowd continues its somewhat slow march towards the mall, but a main road and parking lot stand between them and the mall]
RANDY
[through a bullhorn] If you are here for Black Friday, you cannot be on mall property until midnight on Thanksgiving.
SHOPPER 6
We're not on mall property.
RANDY
Well, you're about to be.
SHOPPER 6
Well, what if we just walk really, really slow? [the crowd slows it's walk further, growls spread among them, as they start to resemble a White Walker's] Black Friday!
RANDY
You're gonna have to walk slower than that. You've got a while.
SHOPPER 7
We can walk really slow. Look. [the shoppers start to shamble and quietly moan in a full parody of a White Walker army]
RANDY
Smartasses. [turns around and goes inside the mall]
[The Garden of Andros, day. Cartman and Butters walk along the familiar path]
CARTMAN
Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick.
BUTTERS
You mean Princess Kenny, m'lord?
CARTMAN
Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him. [picks a rose out for Butters, just as he did for Kenny before.] How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in Game of Thrones?
BUTTERS
They don't!
CARTMAN
Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?
BUTTERS
Yeah, I finished it!
CARTMAN
So what happens when the dragons show up?
BUTTERS
Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!
CARTMAN
Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny.
BUTTERS
Wha-what do you want me to do?
CARTMAN
Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.
BUTTERS
Who's George R. R. Martin?
CARTMAN
He's the guy who writes Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
THOMPSON
Hey! I told you kids to stay out of my damn yard!
CARTMAN
[shoots back] Do you mind?! We're trying to talk here!
THOMPSON
Yeah?! Well how come every time you talk to somebody, it's about betraying somebody else?!
CARTMAN
Why don't you mind your own business?!
[Microsoft headquarters, night. Steve Ballmer is on the phone.]
BALLMER
No. Listen, for the last time, we don't have any dragons to send them. If some people wanna choose PlayStations, it's their choice. [a knock is heard]
SECRETARY
Sir, Mr. Gates is here.
BALLMER
Bill Gates? [to the caller] Uh, I gotta go. [hangs up, rises from his seat, goes around the desk, and greets Bill Gates] Hey heeey! Bill Gates actually showing up at Corporate.
GATES
[shaking hands] Hey Steve, how're you doin'?
BALLMER
Not bad, you know? Just tryin' to get this next gen press stuff handled.
GATES
I heard there's a little trouble in uh, Colorado somewhere?
BALLMER
Oh it's- no, it turns out it was nothing, just some kids tryin' to turn the console wars into somethin' bigger.
GATES
Oh my gosh. You know, when I uh... stepped down and left you in charge of the company, Steve uh, I knew there might be some challenges for you.
BALLMER
Yeah, well, nothin' I can't handle. [a man dressed in black appears behind him] There might be some changes we need to make to our marketing, but I'm optimistic. [the man approaches Steve.]
GATES
Uh huh.
BALLMER
You know, I think we'll ultimately sell the number of units we want to. [the man takes out a dagger and gets closer]
GATES
You're right, Steve. Some changes do need to be made. [the hitman reaches around and stabs Ballmer through the chest and drags the dagger to the right, cutting open Ballmer's chest even more. Ballmer cries out, but is choking in his blood. Ballmer steps backwards and falls on his back gasping for air. Gates takes a glass of wine to a sofa and sits down to look at Ballmer] Do you know what weakness is, Steve? Weakness is believing that competition is healthy. See, there was a time when XBoxes and PlayStations could both survive in this world, but that time's done. It's all headed to one device that people game on, watch TV on, socialize on. There's only going to be one winner. I can't have you idiots throwing away everything I worked so hard to achieve. [Ballmer takes his last gasps as Gates walks out of the CEO's office. Gates addresses Ballmer's men] Clean that shit up.
[New Mexico, evening. Butters and Scott are walking down a street. Butters checks a map for George R. R. Martin's address]
BUTTERS
Well come on, Scott. You're lagging.
SCOTT
I think my insulin's low. I need to eat.
BUTTERS
Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217. [Butters and Scott stand in front of a mansion gate somewhere in the Southwest. Cacti abound on either side of the high fence. Butters reaches up and presses a buzzer]
BUTLER
[through the intercom] Can I help you?
BUTTERS
Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house?
BUTLER
Who is this, please?
BUTTERS
Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up? [two seconds of silence] Hello?
BUTLER
I'm sorry, but Mr. Martin does not see fans.
BUTTERS
We're not fans!
SCOTT
Yeah, we don't like it!
BUTTERS
We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!
BUTLER
About what?
BUTTERS
Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what! [the buzzer sounds again and the gates open. Butters and Scott go inside and towards the front door. George R. R. Martin steps outside to greet them]
GEORGE R. R. MARTIN
It's the Red Wedding, isn't it? You hate how I killed everyone off?
BUTTERS
Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up.
GEORGE R. R. MARTIN
Oh they're coming. The dragons are on their way.
BUTTERS
When?
GEORGE R. R. MARTIN
You really wanna know?
BUTTERS
[sternly] Please. It's urgent.
GEORGE R. R. MARTIN
Alright, King Joffrey is still at King's Landing, but there's a young blacksmith who wakes up one morning with a plan. And His wiener gently hangs down between his legs. Soft and flaccid, his wiener glistened in the golden sunlight.
BUTTERS
No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons?
SCOTT
Aw shit, I think I'm-I think I'm going to faint.
BUTTERS
Uh what's the matter, Scott?
SCOTT
I told you I have to eat every two hours.
BUTTERS
He's diabetic.
GEORGE R. R. MARTIN
Oh Jeez, uh, why don't you kids come out from the cold? I'll order some pizzas.
BUTTERS
Oh. Okay, thanks.
GEORGE R. R. MARTIN
Come on in! I'll tell you everything that's gonna happen in Game of Thrones. [leads the boys inside]
[The Garden of Andros, day. Cartman and Kyle walk along the familiar path]
CARTMAN
Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan.
KYLE
If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong.
CARTMAN
It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her army [picks a rose out for Kyle], but Stan is still the nuts and ball of her operation. [Kyle sniffs the rose] It would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be... [stops] grounded?
KYLE
Grounded? For what?
CARTMAN
That could be up to you.
KYLE
No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!
CARTMAN
Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you're right. [begins walking] Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security?
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
Seems a little convenient, doesn't it? [stops and faces Kyle] Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s. Who's playing dirty now? Let's face it, Sir Kyle, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
THOMPSON
Don't believe it! [Cartman and Kyle look at Thompson] He said that to a bunch of people!
CARTMAN
Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops!
THOMPSON
You're callin' the cops?!
CARTMAN
Yeah!
THOMPSON
You're on my property! I'm callin' the cops!
CARTMAN
Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then!
[A bedroom, night. A couple is having sex in it. As the camera pans right, it reveals whom the couple is - the Channel 9 news team. Niles appears at the door with a microphone in hand. He clears his throat]
TOM
[startled] Oh oh! [calms down] Oh, it's you.
NILES
Tom, I'm standing in your doorway because we have a hot news story to report.
TAMMY
We don't go to work for another hour.
NILES
[walks to the foot of the bed] We just got a call from Bill Gates. [sits down] He says he can promise us a bigger war on Black Friday if we play along.
TAMMY
He wants us to side with him?
NILES
That's right, Tammy. Let's not forget that having a bloodbath on Black Friday is good for the news. It's good for us. The bigger, the better.
TOM
Our job is to report the news, not make it more violent!
NILES
Right, Tom. Because you're sooo about integrity. Let's go. [stands up and walks to the doorway, then turns around] Or maybe I should let everyone in the newsroom know what their two anchors are up to! Back to you!
[Channel 9 Morning News, with Tom and Tammy Thompson]
ANNOUNCER
It's the morning news, with Tom and Tammy Thompson. Colorado's top-rated brother-sister news team.
TOM
Well Black Friday is just around the corner and Tammy, it's getting fierce out there.
TAMMY
That's right, and Niles Lawson is out at the mall with a little holiday surprise.
NILES
Tammy, the excitement over Black Friday is peaking, and none other than Bill Gates himself has shown up to try to make it even bigger. [Bill Gates appears]
GATES
That's right. We just wanna do whatever we can to help our supporters get their XBoxes at incredible deals on Friday, so we've come to offer swords and battle axes, whatever the kids can carry to help them fight their way through the other shoppers.
NILES
We understand that you've donated some guns to the kids as well.
GATES
Yes, but we are limiting it to one per XBox follower,, because of course, the key thing here on everyone's mind is safety.
[The neighborhood. The XBox army marches down the street, with Cartman being borne on a litter by several boys. Some of the bearers are Clyde and Kevin. One of the Federation members, dressed as Geordi La Forge, is indeed carrying a gun. The army approaches Kenny's house, and Tolkien knocks on the door]
CAROL
[answers the door] Yes?
CARTMAN
Hi, is Kenny home?
CAROL
Uh, yeah, Kenny's out back playing with his friends.
CARTMAN
Forward, men! [the bearers try to fit Cartman through the door, but they can't fit through. First they run into the door frame on the left side] That, no- [then on the right] No, you- You've gotta turn me. [the bearers tilt the litter some seventy degrees without Cartman falling off and finally fit through the door.]
[Kenny's backyard. The PS4 army is there, practicing]
JIMMY
It's the enemy! Defensive po-po-p-po-p-positions! [other soldiers rally]
OTHER KIDS
Protect the Princess! Kill 'em! Kill 'em! Get out!
CARTMAN
I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick?
STAN
Let them pass! [the PS4 army makes way for the XBox army. Cartman is carried over to Kenny's throne]
KENNY
(Welcome to my kingdom, Sir Eric. Please, state your purpose.)
STAN
[translating] The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose. [Kenny plays with the hair on his wig]
CARTMAN
You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday.
KENNY
(You can change your mind instead of fighting us on Friday.)
STAN
The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it.
CARTMAN
Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess!
KENNY
(What?!) [fans himself] (Oh, the nerve! How insensitive of you, you cock-sucking faggot!)
STAN
The Princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian.
CARTMAN
That doesn't even make sense.
KYLE
[steps forward] Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control.
STAN
What I started? How dare you!
KYLE
All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?
STAN
I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!
CARTMAN
You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?! [Stan and Kenny look at each other, then Stan thinks a minute]
STAN
The gods will find us a way!
[George R. R. Martin's living room, later. He's expounding on the Game of Thrones...]
GEORGE R. R. MARTIN
So then Samwell Tarly sees the army approaching, and his wiener is about this big. [about 18 inches, by his estimate. Butters is losing patience as Scott fades] He knows that Stannis Baratheon's wiener is probably shriveled from the cold. Samwell has to rally his men, so what does he do? He takes out his wiener [unzips his pants and demonstrates his story] and he dangles it around for all his men to see. [shakes his hips and pretends his wiener is a bell]
SCOTT
AAAH! [turns away for a moment]
BUTTERS
OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming!
GEORGE R. R. MARTIN
Yeah yeah, they're on their way. They're still coming. So Samwell's wiener goes [shakes his hips around as if his wiener were a bell and makes sounds for it]
BUTTERS
But you said they were on their way like three hours ago! [Scott had said he needs to eat every two hours]
SCOTT
If I don't get pizza soon, I'm goin' to pass out.
GEORGE R. R. MARTIN
[zips up] Don't worry. They're coming. Pizzas are on their way. They're gonna be amazing. [picks up where he was interrupted] Now, Jon Snow finally faces Jaime Lannister, and this guy's wiener is, you know, huge, right? So it's not goin' to be easy.
SCOTT
Ehhh...
[The Garden of Andros, day. Cartman is back with another partner in crime]
CARTMAN
Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday.
GATES
Certainly. Uh, Eric, right?
CARTMAN
Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help. [picks another yellow rose for Gates] But I hope that we're clear that this is my army. [hands the rose to him. Gates sniffs it] There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules.
GATES
Oh I certainly don't wanna step on your toes. Don't worry, I'm quite good at letting my CEOs do what they want.
CARTMAN
Your CEOs?
GATES
Let's face it, this is really just about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
CARTMAN
Uhhh, hmmm. What?
THOMPSON
[from his bedroom window] Hahaa! How's it feel?! Now who's walking who through the betrayal garden?!
CARTMAN
Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?!
THOMPSON
Why don't you stay the fuck out of my yard?! [slams his window shut]
[Sony Headquarters, Japan, night. The President of Sony is on top of someone, giving it to them, but that person is silent.]
PRESIDENT
Ish, ish, ish, o-ish, haishooo! [quickly sits up to deliver the final thrust, then collapses onto his bed. He then rolls over on his back, revealing whom he was having sex with]
NILES
[with mic in hand] That was amazing sex. I enjoyed it immensely. How about you?
PRESIDENT
[gets a cigarette and lights it.] Tanoshikatta ne. (Yeah, it was fun.)
NILES
You know, Microsoft has given kids who want XBoxes on Black Friday a lot of support. Seems a shame that the fight will be so one-sided.
PRESIDENT
Eh? Nani kore, tsukareta yo. (What? I'm tired!)
NILES
Black Friday is about to happen and it's not even gonna be a fight. That's bad for both of us. There must be something you can give to kids who want Sonys to make the fight more even.
PRESIDENT
Hai. ["Yes." He reaches over to his left and grabs a box] Kore ga arimasu. ["Here it is" He opens the box and something begins to glow inside]
NILES
[leans in to see what it is] Yes, I think that will do nicely.
[GRRM's Santa Fe mansion. He's now poised to be conductor. He taps his music stand with the conductor's stick. The scene changes to show a chorus of 10 white, middle-aged men in red-sashed, black, concert tuxedos holding musical scores and standing on double row of concert risers facing GRRM. They begin singing]
CHORUS
[Classical men's ensemble singing in musical round style, as GRRM conducts.]
Wiener, wiener wiener, wiener wiener [continues in background]
SOLOIST
One wiener, next to another wiener
CHORUS
Wiener, wiener wiener, wiener wiener [continues in background]
SOLOIST
Two wieners alongside yet another wiener
CHORUS
Party, wiener party, wiener party, party party, wiener party, wiener wiener [continues in background]
SOLOIST
Soft wieners, nice and soft, non-erect wieners!
CHORUS
Keep them flopping, flopping wieners, floppy floppy, dangle wieners, dangle dangle [continues in background]
SOLOIST
Five wieners in my face
SCOTT
Stop! Stop please! I can't take any more! [Chorus is silent]
GEORGE R. R. MARTIN
But this is the best part. Right before King Joffrey gets poisoned, everyone flaps their wieners all around his face.
SCOTT
Jeaaaaah!
BUTTERS
[gets off the sofa] Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?!
GEORGE R. R. MARTIN
Okay, okay, fine fine. What kind of pizzas do you want?
BUTTERS
What kind do we want?!
SCOTT
He hasn't even ordered the pizzas yet!
GEORGE R. R. MARTIN
Don't worry! They're coming! Not just two pizzas, there's, there's gonna be five! And they're gonna be huge! You won't believe it!
BUTTERS
Come on, Scott! We're leaving! [helps Scott off the sofa, and they're about to leave]
GEORGE R. R. MARTIN
Wait, I haven't told you what happens yet!
BUTTERS
NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes!
GEORGE R. R. MARTIN
Well why didn't you say so? I can help with that.
BUTTERS
Whatoyou mean?
GEORGE R. R. MARTIN
I'll make some calls. I know a way to make sure you're completely prepared for Black Friday! [starts dialing]
[Kenny's backyard. The PS4 army is at attention. The Sony President and his chief officers are there. The President presents the box to Kenny]
PRESIDENT
Sony PS4 no urazuke. Zenbu. Domo sumimasen. ["For your support of the Sony PS4, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to all of you"]
AIDE
The President of Sony bids you thanks for all your support of the PS4.
PRESIDENT
Sore kara kono gifuto de Princess no Pawaa agemashou ["After that, let us give you this gift, the Power of the Princess"]
AIDE
He offers you this gift to once and for all make you an official Princess, and to give you the powers you need to win this war on Black Friday. [The president kneels, opens the box, and shows off the brooch resting within it. Kenny leaves the throne and takes the brooch from its box]
PRESIDENT
Ima kara ["From now on"]... Princess Kenny!
CRAIG
Wow, Kenny's a Japanese princess.
KENNY
(Wooo!) [as J-pop music plays, Kenny's backyard is transformed. The makeshift thrown becomes a gazebo with a unicorn bust on top, Kenny gets a magical girl look, with big anime eyes, and gets the power of the rainbow, with bubbles, etc. He gets a pet unicorn. The whole scene could be an intro for a Princess Kenny show.]
[South Park Mall, night. The 'White Walker' crowd is beginning to cross the street]
GUARD 9
Oh God. We're done for!
RANDY
My friends, the time is almost here. Let us face these shoppers with the bravery of those mall security officers before us. [his phone rings and he picks up] Commander Marsh. ... They're what? ... They're gonna what?!
[Outside the mall. The 'Walker' crowd army is closing in on the entrance. Channel 9 News is on the scene]
NILES
Tom, we have breaking news from the South Park mall. In an effort to make sure everyone is prepared, the mall has decided to push Black Friday by one week!
CROWD
[turns and looks at him] What?
NILES
The genius idea was proposed by George R. R. Martin, who also suggested "Fuck it, let's push Thanksgiving to December 3rd." For pushing the date, the mall is now reducing Black Friday prices to 96% off to the first hundred people inside the mall! [the shoppers begin to fight each other] This is going to be a fucking bloodbath, Tom. There will be medical tents, ambulances, face-painting, no doubt a lot of people you know and love are going to die! [an elderly man holding up a 96% off flier lets out a dragon's roar]
End of A Song of Ass and Fire


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The doors to the mall will finally open for the biggest Black Friday sale in history. The boys are divided over which gaming device to buy and a bloody battle will determine whether Xbox or Sony will be the winner.

[Previously on South Park. Some clips of the previous episodes are shown as a summary. A clip featuring the Canadian Minister of Health is included just for kicks. The intro follows, with the Wiener song from last episode playing. Then follows the Princess Kenny Japanese anime-style animation. The segment begins at Sony Headquarters. Three men are in the president's office. One looks out the window while the second talks to the president]

[Return to normal South Park animation style and open on XBox Army headquarters, day. Cartman is in a lawn chair talking to Kyle and Clyde. He's not pleased with what he's hearing.]
CARTMAN
[nose in left hand] He did what?? He flew down in a parachute and he what??
CLYDE
Apparently, he stopped Microsoft from blockading the shipment of PS4s to the mall. Looks like he's all over the place winning the console wars for Sony.
CARTMAN
Because, because what? Because he's cute?
KYLE
Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him!
CARTMAN
But what does he do besides that he's cute?!
LIANE
[appears in the sliding door] Sweetie, Bill Gates is on the phone for you.
CARTMAN
Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom! [she turns around and goes back inside. Cartman reconsiders] Mom? [she looks back at him] Don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit. [she walks out of view]
KYLE
This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place!
CARTMAN
He's not a princess, he's a DUDE!
KYLE
Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options!
CARTMAN
So what are you saying, Kyle?!
KYLE
I have an idea. [turns around and walks off a bit] I don't like it, but I think it's the only choice we have.
[South Park Mall, night. A huge crowd of people waits to get in, and minor scuffles pop up from time to time. Niles reports]
NILES
Tom, Black Friday is finally almost here, and as you can see behind me, holiday shoppers are really getting antsy. People have been waiting out here since midnight on Thanksgiving. They're cold, they're starving, and there's already been a lot of blood shed over these holiday deals. Joining me now is Rick Tellmore, [balding shopper] who's been out here for six days, and your five year old son was eaten. Is that correct?
RICK
Yes, yes that's right, we had to eat him. We were all sort of starving out here, so we drew straws, and he drew the shortest one.
NILES
What is it you're hoping to get when Black Friday does finally start?
RICK
A a Blu-ray player. Ninety-six percent off, it's gonna be about 20 bucks.
NILES
Now, some people might say that eating your child is not very Christmasy. What would you say to them?
RICK
[thinks a long time]
Iiii...
ate my son for a Blu-ray play-er
With a ho ho ho and a jingle jingle jang-le
My son got ate and it tasted good ho ho jingle jingle ho ho!
[as Niles speaks, he moves off, singing]
Ho ho jingle jing-le
Jingle jingle jang-le
Jingle jingle jingle ho ho!
NILES
No doubt Christmas is alive and well at the South Park Mall. Back to you, Tom.
[PS4 Army's medieval tent headquarters, day. Stan looks over a crude, cardboard, scale model of the mall, with troop locations indicated by Lego men]
STAN
Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here. [points to the location] Our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance, here. [points to a location outside cardboard Red Robin]
CRAIG
At Red Robin?
JIMMY
That's right. Red Robin has doors on the inside that go right out into the mall.
STAN
The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts.
CRAIG
So how do we take over Black Robin?
STAN
I have no idea.
PETE
[appearing at the tent's entrance] Hey uh, excuse me?
STAN
Yes?
PETE
The uh, XBox fighters are here and they say they wanna switch sides?
STAN
What? [moments later, outside, Stan walks towards Cartman as the two armies face each other]
KYLE
Go ahead and tell him, Cartman.
CARTMAN
Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay?
CRAIG
Haha.
CARTMAN
Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess.
CLYDE
Nobody saw that coming.
KYLE
Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers.
STAN
So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own. [turns around and walks away]
CARTMAN
We know a way inside the Red Robin. [this stops Stan, Jimmy and Craig] You don't think you're the only ones that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we figured out how.
KYLE
Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there.
CRAIG
Hey, that could work.
KYLE
Let's do this together, dude. [Stan turns around and goes back] Our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up. If you wanna game on a PS4, then I do too.
STAN
And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?
KYLE
[pledges with his right hand up and puts his left hand behind his back] I swear, Stan.
STAN
[turns around] Alright, guys. Looks like we have a wedding to plan. [as he walks away with Jimmy and Craig, the camera reveals that Kyle had his fingers on the hand behind his back crossed during the swear.]
[Switch to Princess Kenny anime-style animation. Sony headquarters, day.]
SONY PRESIDENT
Taihen. Kono console warusu mada owaranai. ["This is bad! These console wars aren't over yet."]
EXEC. 3
Sou desu ["That's right"]
SONY PRESIDENT

KENNY
Minna-san, ii yo. Purincessu Kenni ganbaru. ["Everyone, its alright. Princess Kenny will give it her all."]
SECRETARY 1
Kenni-chan, shitsure desu kedo. Wedding invitation kimashita. ["Kenny-chan, sorry to interrupt, but a wedding invitation has arrived."]
KENNY
Ha? Ueddingu? ["Huh? Wedding?" Kenny reads the front of the invitation: "You are invited to a wedding at Red Robin"]
CARTMAN
[Cartman's portrait, anime-style with a beard, voices over as Kenny reads the note inside the invitation.] Kenny-chan, please come home at once. Our two houses have found peace. Come to the Red Robin wedding, and we will accept you as the princess you are. Yours truly, the Wizard King.
KENNY
Waaah? Sugoi-chan. ["What? Sweet!"]
EXEC. 1
Purincessu Kenni ueddingu irimasu ne? ["Princess Kenny is going to be in a wedding, right?"]
EXEC. 2

KENNY
Minna-san, sayonara! Ima, Purincessu Kenni tomodachi ni kaerimasu! ["Goodbye, everyone! Princess Kenny is going back home to her friends!" Kenny jumps out the window... and drops straight down. She crashes into the street below and leaves a big puddle of blood]

Horaa! ["Look!"]
KENNY

THE OFFICE
Ahh, kawaii! [The men's eyes turn to hearts, the women's to happy upside-down U's--"Ahh, how cute!"]
[Return to normal animation style. The Garden of Andros, yet again. Cartman walks with Stan now.]
CARTMAN
Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding.
STAN
Yeah, sure, what about it?
CARTMAN
I think it's best that when the time comes for the mall to open, we should stay back a bit from the doors. [reaches out for a yellow rose]
STAN
Why?
CARTMAN
Well, think about it. [hands the rose to Stan, who takes it] The first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance. It's best we let Butters and Scott Malkinson go first. While they fight, we can simply slip on by.
STAN
Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s.
CARTMAN
Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through-
THOMPSON
He's lying to you! [Cartman gets annoyed, and he and Stan look at Thompson] They're just acting like they've given up, but it's a double-bluff!
CARTMAN
Dude! Dude!
THOMPSON
They're gonna betray you at the Red Robin wedding! He got the idea watching Game of Thrones!
CARTMAN
Dude, shut the fuck up!
STAN
Who is that?
CARTMAN
He's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I'm in his garden all the time.
THOMPSON
They're gonna lock you in!
CARTMAN
God damn it, shut up!
THOMPSON
He talked about it in my garden to like three other people! They're gonna lock you in the Red Robin and go get all the XBoxes! That's why he wants you to stay back from the doors!
CARTMAN
Well why don't you just tell the whole world everything, huh?! Why don't you tell everyone what Prometheus was about while you're at it?!
STAN
Did Kyle know about this?
CARTMAN
Dude, we're not gonna betray you. Come on! Did you see Prometheus? I don't think the writers even knew what that was about.
STAN
Did Kyle know about this?!
CARTMAN
[sighs] Kyle thought of it. [Stan bolts out of there] Stan, dude, hold on! XBox One is fuckin' sweet, dude! [with Stan not returning, Cartman looks at Thompson] You're a fuckin' asshole!
THOMPSON
Fuck you, get out of my garden!
CARTMAN
I'll shit in your fuckin' garden!
THOMPSON
Go fuck yourself! [slams his bedroom window shut]
[Channel 9 News]
TAMMY
Well, the wait is over and Black Friday is finally here.
TOM
Niles Lawson is at the scene, and it's about time, Niles.
NILES
That's right Tom. Mall officials have said they are ready, and doors will open as soon as their guest of honor cuts the ceremonial red ribbon. [shown] This year's ribbon cutter is of course George R. R. Martin, who um, doesn't appear to have shown up yet, [a real-life photo of George R. R. Martin is shown] but uhh, says he is on his way. Just like the dragons and zombies in his novels, he is on his way.
[Sure enough, two horses run through frozen New Mexico. One carries George R. R. Martin, the other carries Butters and Scott, who has passed out from lack of eating]
BUTTERS
Now just hold on a minute! Well I'm pretty darned sure the fastest way back to Colorado isn't on horseback!
GEORGE R. R. MARTIN
That may be true, but horses have one quality that is unmatched by any other mode of transportation.
BUTTERS
What's that? [looks around, than below, his horse] Awww! [horse is shown with a huge semi-hard penis.]
[Red Robin, day. As the boys and Red Robin workers go about preparing the restaurant for a wedding, Cartman talks to the manager. After hanging up a "Happy Wedding" banner, Clyde and Craig come down some ladders]
CARTMAN
Okay, cool, could we set up the two long tables here, like, facing each other, and then another one for the bride and groom back there?
MANAGER
Uh, I heard a rumor. May I ask, who is it that's getting married?
CARTMAN
Oh uum, Tom Hanks aaand Beyoncé.
MANAGER
It's, it's real? It's for real? Oho my God, I love them!
CARTMAN
Yesh, kewl.
MANAGER
So Beyoncé is not with Jay-Z anymore?
CARTMAN
Well, clearly she wouldn't be marrying Tom Hanks at Red Robin if she was.
MANAGER
Uh, guys, guys, not those tables. Get the good tables. This is VIP, okay?
CARTMAN
Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott Malkinson? The fuck are they?
KYLE
[rushes up] Cartman, Cartman! I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan!
CARTMAN
Yes, he did.
KYLE
Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now!
CARTMAN
[shushes Kyle up and walks him a few steps] It's fine, Kyle. Everything's been taken care of. Stan won't be telling anybody anything... ever again.
KYLE
[getting alarmed] What the hell did you do??
CARTMAN
What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle!
KYLE
No. Tell me you didn't!
[Stan's house, evening. Sharon takes Kyle up to Stan's room and briefs him on Stan's trouble]
SHARON
He's not allowed to come out of his room, so you can talk to him through the door.
KYLE
Thanks, Mrs. Marsh.
SHARON
And keep it short. He's in real trouble. He defecated in a nice old man's garden.
KYLE
Ok-okay. [watches her leave, walks over to Stan's door and knocks] Stan? Stan?
STAN
[startled out of his sleep] Huh? Hello? Who is that? [next to him is a glass of milk, a sandwich with a bite in it, and a tin cup]
KYLE
Stan, it's me.
STAN
Get out of here!
KYLE
Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now. You've gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the XBox is better, for all of us.
STAN
You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.
KYLE
You weren't playing fair, dude. Getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair.
STAN
[stands and turns to address Kyle] I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle!
KYLE
You didn't?
STAN
...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.
KYLE
I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry. This whole war has just got us all so screwed up. I just want us to be playing Call of Duty on the right machine.
STAN
You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again.
KYLE
[lets his head fall on the door] Stan, don't say that.
STAN
Get out of here! I'm done with you! [grabs the tin cup and raps it against his bedroom 'jail cell' door as in classic prison movies] Mom! Mom! [Kyle stands up straight] Get him out of here! [Sharon arrives, and Kyle back away from the door] Get him out! [Kyle leaves]
[Inside the currently empty South Park Mall atrium, night. Randy addresses the other guards]
RANDY
Now listen up: there are only eight of us now. Peterson was a great guy, and he did not deserve to get beheaded like that. Now I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of getting to know people here, getting invested in their personalities and their back stories, and then having them die! [points to the main entrance] When those doors open, we all stick together! If anyone panics, it puts us all at risk! [a blond guard begins to weep] Stay tough, rookie.
GUARD 6
We're not gonna make it, sir.
RANDY
We're gonna make it! You've got a newborn little girl who needs her daddy to make it! I'm not going to let you die, okay?!
GUARD 6
Okay.
RANDY
OKAY?!
GUARD 6
Yes sir! Yes sir.
RANDY
Not one more good person dies on my watch! [all of a sudden, shoppers break through the skylight on the upper level]
GUARD 3
Oh my God!
GUARD 8
They're comin' in through the roof!
GUARD 6
[begins to back away] I can't do this! I'm sorry! I can't do this! [runs off, and now there are seven]
RANDY
Stay at your post! [an arrow pierces the fleeing guard's back right chest. Randy is shown again, holding the bow from which the arrow came] Nooo! NOOO! EVERYBODY REALLY LIKED HIM!! NOOO!
[South Park Mall, day. A helicopter shot of the crowd outside the mall.]
NILES
Here we go, Tom. George R. R. Martin has finally arrived to cut the red ribbon. [George R. R. Martin is shown behind the red ribbon with scissors in hand]
GEORGE R. R. MARTIN
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to be here this morning on behalf of South Park Mall Partners and channel 9 News, your go-to source for news, weather, and sports.
SHOPPER 8
Just do it! [the shoppers in front crouch down, ready to run inside]
GEORGE R. R. MARTIN
Very well. In the tradition of our ancestors, [lowers the scissors to a cutting position] let's bring in the holidays! [more jockeying for position. George R. R. Martin pulls up at the last moment and closes the scissors] But first, I'd like to share with you a few words about my wiener.
CROWD
AAAWWWW!! [off to one side, where the crowd can't see, the Goth kids approach Red Robin]
MANAGER
Hey, sorry guys. Red Robin is closed for a special event today.
PETE
Yeah, we know. We're with the wedding.
MANAGER
Oh great, go right on in. [smiles and lets them in]
[Red Robin, inside. The theme is medieval times, with the boys in costume. Both houses - House PS4 and House XBox - are present. Jimmy plays the flute while Craig accompanies him on tambourine in a medieval style song.]
CARTMAN
Everyone! Everyone, a Black Friday toast. How awesome that we are all friends again. Our two houses brought together. Soon we will all have our PlayStation 4s. [all cheer] And to you, my old friend, Princess Kenny. You really look stunning. No doubt the gods have smiled down upon your perky boobs.
KENNY
(My boobs? You flatter me, Grand Wizard!)
CARTMAN
Now, if you'll excuse my, my lady, I need to take a shit. [leaves the table and goes to the mall-side entrance, where Clyde is keeping watch] What have you found out?
CLYDE
The mall isn't open yet. They're waiting for George R. R. Martin to come cut the ribbon.
CARTMAN
Oh okay, that could be a while. [turns away from the door] All our men are ready. When the mall opens, blow the whistle. We'll rush through the doors and lock the Sony dorks inside. Alright, now I really do need to take a shit.
[At the mall entrance...]
GEORGE R. R. MARTIN
O soft and pink with purple head.
Gently you lay with me on my bed.
SHOPPER 9
Get on with it, George R. R. Martin! [the rest of the crowd rallies behind him]
GEORGE R. R. MARTIN
"Growl, growl" calls the wiener from on high
A little tiny wiener, still so pleasing to the eye.
SHOPPER 10
Enough with the wieners already!
SHOPPER 11
Yeah, come on!
[Back at Red Robin... Cartman is back from the restroom and looks over to the mall entrance]
CARTMAN
Clyde? Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde?
KYLE
[approaches Cartman and Kenny's table] Princess Kenny, I believe it's time we returned the Wizard's hospitality! [the PS4 soldiers immediately brandish their weapons and aim them at the XBox soldiers. Tweek advances on Tolkien with an armed bow. Kenny has his sword under Cartman's chin]
CARTMAN
What the hell is this?!
KYLE
I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans!
CARTMAN
Sir Kyle, they're about to open the mall! What are you doing?!
KYLE
I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation!
CARTMAN
Kyle, the PlayStation controller sucks and you know it!
KYLE
The fight is over, Cartman!
GATES
[walks into view] It's not over. Looks like I came just in time.
CARTMAN
Oho! Bill Gates! Sweet! In your face, Kyle!
SONY PRESIDENT
[walks into view and speaks in very thick accent] You will not interfere, Bill Gates! These-a children will get their PS4s!
KENNY
(The Sony president's here too, desu ka? ["Is that the Sony president here, too?"])
KYLE
Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?
CARTMAN
They're not a part of your betrayal?
KYLE
No. They're not a part of your betrayal?
CARTMAN
No. Whose betrayal is this? [the sound of chains comes from the mall entrance - Stan locks the doors, then turns around]
STAN
We're done with betrayals! It's time to put an end to this!
KYLE
Stan?
[Inside the mall...]
GUARD 3
Sir? Sir, Operations just said they need one of us to unlock the door to Red Robin to let some wedding party inside the mall!
RANDY
Screw them! They'll have to fend for themselves! Wait. Red Robin Wedding? Who's getting married?!
GUARD 3
Tom Hanks and Beyoncé.
RANDY
What?! Oh my God, everyone likes Tom Hanks and Beyoncé! [runs towards Red Robin] I've gotta save them!
[Back at Red Robin...]
STAN
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kyle, but I have a better idea! This isn't our war, you guys! It never was. We've been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing. That's why they want lines around the block. [stops between the two presidents] Because they want a war to promote their products. They don't give a crap what kind of friendships they cost. You two want a war so bad? [throws his sword at the Sony president] Then you fucking fight!
SONY PRESIDENT
Huh? [strokes the wooden sword] Sou...["I see..."]
GATES
Then let's finish it! [begins to unbutton his shirt] You and me!
SONY PRESIDENT
Ikimashou! ["Let's go!"]
GATES
[now topless, he is fully covered in MS-13 gang tattoos. Prominent chest tattoo is "MS-DOS"] Winner take all!
CARTMAN
Oh dude, this is pretty sweet.
SONY PRESIDENT
Then let this be your last fight, Bill Gates. [Gates throws the first punch, then follows up with a few kicks. The Sony president comes back with a right hook. The kids look on in horror as the men fight unarmed. Butters finally shows up.]
BUTTERS
Hey, fellas. What did I miss? [smiles]
[At the main mall entrance, George R. R. Martin is still expounding on wieners]
GEORGE R. R. MARTIN
Look at this wiener. [unzips his pants] Judge it by its size?
Rub it three times and it has a surprise. [Shopper 4 joins George R. R. Martin after George R. R. Martin exposes his penis and opens up a switchblade]
SHOPPER 4
That's it! You're not delaying this anymore, you wiener-loving bitch! [slices off George R. R. Martin's penis and throws it into the crowd, which cheers wildly. Shopper 4 cuts the ribbon, and the crowd surges into the mall. The six remaining guards are powerless against the crowd]
GUARD 8
Happy holidays, Rick. [grabs Rick's hand and holds it as the crowd surges forward]
RICK
And to you, my friend. [Utter chaos. The guards are overpowered and trampled on. The shoppers break into the stores, destroying windows and looting. One man dies impaled on a broken window. A lot of adults grab "Stop Touching Me Elmo"s]
SHOPPER 12
Grab it Rebecca! Grab it [has her girl stretching out to grab an Elmo from the top shelf. Another woman comes up behind her and hits her with a bat, knocking the Elmo out of the girl's hands. The second woman is herself thrown into a shelf by a man.]
SHOPPER 2
[Morbidly obese shopper throwing people out of her way left and right] Kiss my fat vagina!
SHOPPER 13
[combat music starts in imitation of "Game of Thrones" credit music as shopper 13 competes with other shoppers to grab items from a cardboard box] Gimme that camera! Give it up! [live-action archived footage from a rush on Cabbage Patch Kids, and more from Walmart and Target]
RANDY
Get back! Get out of my way! [his phone rings and he answers it] Commander Marsh?
SHARON
Did you know that your son is supposed to be grounded and he snuck out to go to Red Robin?!
RANDY
WHAT?? STAN'S IN THE RED ROBIN WEDDING TOO?? OH GOD, I REALLY CARE ABOUT HIM!
[Back at Red Robin, Bill Gates finishes off the Sony president with five head smashes into the ground.]
GATES
This... is over... Now... you die! [cracks the president's head open and creates a pool of blood, then throwing him into a wall for good measure. The president's brain is exposed. Tired and breathless, Gates walks over to a table and leans on it a little] It's over. Xbox... wins! [no one is happy about this.]
CARTMAN
[flatly] Yay, XBox wins.
STAN
[flatly] Yay.
RANDY
[unlocks the doors and opens them] Stan! You're alive! I saved you! [falls on to his knees] It's okay, Beyoncé! The fight's over! You can still shop! [falls over, exhausted]
GATES
Go on, kids. [gasps] Go get your XBoxes. [the kids silently leave Red Robin. Music changes to a solo piano playing "Oh Christmas Tree" in imitation of "A Charlie Brown Christmas". Eleven of them walk through the mall, through a sea of bodies and blood, and up to the second floor on an escalator]
ELMO
[on an adjacent escalator] Can Elmo smell your genitals? [the boys walk over to EVGames]
EVGAMES CLERK
[unscathed, despite the destruction to his shop] Happy holidays, guys. What can I interest ya in? [the shelf behind him, full of PS4s and XB1s, is surprisingly unscathed]
CARTMAN
We'd like to get XBox Ones please.
EVGAMES CLERK
Good choice! [gives the boys a thumbs up]
[Channel 9 news report set in front of parking lot full of dead shoppers. "A Charlie Brown Christmas" piano music still underscores.]
RANDY
[Silently carries a flat panel television past the mass of dead bodies.]
NILES
Tom, the shopping frenzy is over, and it looks like Microsoft's new XBox One is this year's hot item. No doubt this will secure its place as the go-to next-gen console. Black Friday is over. There's been death, violence, horrible human behavior... and the big winner here, decidedly, is Channel 9 News.
[Cartman's house, afternoon. The eleven who went to EVGames - Timmy, Tweek, Craig, Clyde, Kenny, Tolkien, Kyle, Butters, Jimmy, Cartman, Stan - and Scott are in the living room. Cartman and Stan are playing while the others are behind them, watching.]
CARTMAN
The interface is pretty cool. See, I told you guys, it's really a... it's a seamless interface.
STAN
Yes, it is.
BUTTERS
The graphics are definitely like 10% better than the old XBox.
JIMMY
Yeah that's that's that's pretty nice. [the game falls silent]
CARTMAN
You guys wanna p-play outside or something? [the boys glance around at each other. Soon the sliding door opens and the boys walk out onto the back yard]
KYLE
Cartman? Your side won, dude. Why are you so sad?
CARTMAN
I just... I can't get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes.
STAN
Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games?
CARTMAN
The last two weeks we've been too busy to play video games and, look at what we did. There's been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play?
THE BOYS
Yeah, you're right. You make a point.
CARTMAN
Maybe we started to rely on Microsoft and Sony so much that we forgot that all we need to play are the simplest things. Like, like this. [grabs a stick from the ground] We could just play with this. Screw video games, dude! Who fuckin' needs them?!
THE BOYS
Yeah!
CARTMAN
[holds the stick up high in the sun] Fuck 'em!
[Quick commercial. A box for The Stick of Truth appears onscreen]
ANNOUNCER
The South Park video game, coming to stores soon!
BUTTERS
[pops up onscreen] Yeah, and if you believe that I've got a big floppy wiener to dangle in your face!
End of Titties and Dragons

synopsis:When Wendy tries to fix one of her girl friends up with Butters, she ends up in the counselor’s office.

script:The Hobbit

[South Park Elementary Gym, day. The cheerleaders are at practice]
CHEERLEADERS
Yeah, yeah, do we rock?!
Yeah, yeah, take it to the top!
Yeah, yeah, are we gonna stop?!
No way! No way!
WENDY
Cheer Squad roll call! [each cheerleader steps forward, announces her name, and steps back]
HEIDI
Heidi!
NICHOLE
Nichole!
BEBE
Bebe!
LOLA
Lola!
RED
Red!
ANNIE
Annie!
LISA
[slowly steps forward and speaks slowly] Lisa Berger. [this brings down the other cheerleaders]
ANNIE
Oh God.
RED
Here we go.
NICHOLE
Ugh.
BEBE
Can we maybe try one without Lisa Berger?
WENDY
You guys, stop it! Okay, Lisa, that's great. But you need to have more confidence, okay?
LISA
But I'm the fat one.
WENDY
What?
LISA
Every cheerleading squad has a fat ugly cheerleader and that's me.
WENDY
See, that's the problem, Lisa. You have a bad self-image. Just project all your sassiness to all the boys out there, okay?
HEIDI
There's only one boy that Lisa cares about.
RED
Yeah, Lisa has a crush on Butters.
LISA
Shut up!
WENDY
But, Lisa, that's great! Have you told Butters that you like him?
LISA
No way. I, I'd just get made fun of.
WENDY
Lisa, this is exactly what you need! Take Butters to see a movie or something! It'll do wonders for your confidence!
[The cafeteria, later. Kenny, Cartman, Tweek, Craig, Clyde, and Butters are seated at table, with Butters recounting something]
BUTTERS
So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says "I"-
LISA
Uh, excuse me. Butters?
BUTTERS
[confused for a moment, then looks over his left shoulder] Oh. Yes?
LISA
Um, well, I was just wondering if... [strokes her hair] maybe... [brings her arm down] you would like to go to a movie this weekend.
BUTTERS
Oh. Oh like a date? Oh no thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate the offer, but you're too fat for me.
LISA
[casts her eyes down] Okay, thanks.
BUTTERS
See ya, Lisa! [Esther overhears the conversation from the next table and looks over her shoulder at Butters]
CRAIG
Haha, Butters got asked out by a fat girl.
CLYDE
At least she didn't try to sit on him. [the other boys at the table laugh, except Cartman]
CARTMAN
You guys, come on. That's not kewl. You shouldn't rip on her because she's fat. You should rip on her 'cause she's ugly. Okay? She looks like someone hit her in the face with a hot shovel, and that's why she sucks, alright?
[The hallway, later. Butters is at his locker]
BUTTERS
Camptown ladies sing this song, doo-da, doo-da.
[Wendy comes to view at the end of the hall and spots him, then walks up to him]
Camptown racetrack's five miles long Oh, de doo-da day.
Oh-
WENDY
[grabs his locker door and slams it shut] What the fuck is your problem?!
BUTTERS
Oh. Hey, Wendy.
WENDY
Are you just an asshole?! Is that it?!
BUTTERS
Am I just an asshole?
WENDY
Yeah!
BUTTERS
Well, m-no. I've got arms and legs; I've got everything.
WENDY
Lisa Berger asked you out and you called her fat?! Do you have any idea how you made her feel?! She's a really nice girl!
BUTTERS
Ah, I think she's a nice girl too. She's just too big for me.
WENDY
She's a little overweight, but that's pretty normal for a girl in the fourth grade!
BUTTERS
Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby!
WENDY
What?!
BUTTERS
I'm sorry, Wendy, but I have a different standard when it comes to my women. [opens his locker again. On the door are several pinup posters of Kim Kardashian] I want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good, who's got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs, and perfect everything.
WENDY
[grabs the poster] This is a fantasy, you moron! You ever heard of Photoshop?! Kim Kardashian is a short, overweight woman who manipulates her image and makes average girls feel horrible about themselves!
BUTTERS
You're a liar!
WENDY
Look it up, stupid! [crushes the poster into a wad] In real life, Kim Kardashian has the body of a hobbit! [throws the wadded-up poster to the floor and walks away. As Butters reaches for the poster, Wendy turns around] You're gonna be in real trouble when the teachers find out what you said to that poor girl! [turns around and goes around the corner. Butters unwads the poster]
[Mr. Mackey's office, later. Butters is in there with Mr. Mackey, crying. Wendy walks in a few seconds later]
MR. MACKEY
Uh, take a seat, Wendy. I guess some mean things were said and I need to get to the bottom of it.
WENDY
[noticing Butters] Oh, good. Lisa Berger told on you? Good!
MR. MACKEY
Uh no, Wendy, apparently, you called Butters' girlfriend a hobbit.
WENDY
...Are you serious?
BUTTERS
You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit!
WENDY
That's not his girlfriend! It's Kim Kardashian!
MR. MACKEY
Uh, but, but, Wendy, Kim Kardashian is considered to be extremely beautiful, mkay?
WENDY
Right, but she's not in real life. She's a hobbit.
BUTTERS
Oh, she said it again!
MR. MACKEY
Now, Wendy, Kim might be, uh, full-figured, but a woman's outward appearance isn't all that matters, mkay?! Have you stopped to consider that maybe, just maybe, you're jel?
WENDY
I'm not "jel", and I happen to be the biggest feminist at this school!
MR. MACKEY
Uh that may be true, but there is a very fine line, Wendy, between being a feminist and being a hater, mkay? And you're gonna have to find that line because nobody likes a girl who's jelly!
[Room 7, later. Class is in session. Mr. Garrison stands before the class]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, kids, there have been some hurtful and hateful things being said around this school, and so we are gonna hear from a guest speaker. Here to explain why Kim Kardashian is not a hobbit, please welcome, Aquaman. [goes to his desk as Kanye West enters the room. The class claps]
KANYE
Uh-huh. Uh-huh, that's right
CARTMAN
[recognizing him] Uh oh.
KANYE
[enunciating] Okay, first of all, I am NOT Aquaman, I am a recovering... gay fish. Yes, I have met Aquaman. I have hung out with Aquaman. But the only thing I have in common with Aquaman anymore is my love for the sea. [adjusting his pants] Now! [clears his throat] There have been malicious rumors, started at this elementary school, that my beautiful fiancée is a hobbit. That is not funny, and it is not true. [Wendy's eyes are glazing over] Alright?! Yes, Kim is heavier than most of her pictures show her to be. Yes, she gets her hair lasered off her body. Yes, she has a friend named Gandalf who happens to be a wizard. [finds himself trapped by that last statement, and backs up] I'm sorry, excuse me a minute. [calls Kim up and turns his back on the class...] Bitch, how are you not a hobbit again? Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah right. Right right right right right, yeah. Okay. Yep. Yep. Let me get- okay. Yep, I got it. Okay, love you too. [blows two quick kisses at the phone, hangs up, and turns to the class.] Okay, if my fiancée Kim… is… a hobbit, then how come… it uh how c- then, okay, if she's a hobbit, then how come she don't live in a hole in the ground? BOOOOOOM! All y'all just got lit up, cuz! She don't live in no hole in the ground, she lives in a big-ass mansion, with me, in her room, that is slightly below ground! So, you can… She, she is sexy, and womanly, and she smokes a pipe. She can blow them rings that go up over her head, and… Hold up.[calls Kim up again and turns his back on the class...] Bitch, you not a hobbit, right? ... No, I know, you just, you smoke that long pipe sometimes when you sit by the fire... Oh it's a- Oh, okay. Got it, got it- What do you call it? Yep. Yep, got it. Okay. Yep, love you too. [blows two quick kisses at the phone, hangs up, and turns to the class.] That is not a hobbit pipe, for your information! It is a personal oral humidifier to keep all the wrinkles around her mouth from showin'. So haha, all you haters, HA!
[South Park Elementary, day. Butters walks down the hall when the computer lab door opens and Wendy peeks out]
WENDY
Butters. Butters, come here for a sec.
BUTTERS
Oh no, you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up!
WENDY
Butters, will you please let me show you something, so we can put this behind us?
BUTTERS
Well, alright, but if you try to punch me, I'll scream! [she goes back inside, and Butters follows her in]
WENDY
I want you to see just how easy this is so we can better understand each other. This is Lisa Berger's class photo, right?
BUTTERS
Okay.
WENDY
Now, first thing we do is Photoshop the bulges on her sides [she trims them down a bit]. We select the eyes [makes the glasses more rectangular and shorter, and adds eye makeup], make them a nicer shape, take off any blemishes on the skin [the freckles go], lengthen the neck [moves the head up], add more to the hair [gives Lisa longer, wavy hair], select the lips and make them fuller [removes the harelip], take out any puffiness on the skin [reduces the cheeks] here, add fullness to the breasts, lengthen the torso, take away that fold of skin [this gives Lisa hips], streamline the shoulders [making the arms thinner in the process], put highlights in the eyes [gives her a nose], and, there.
BUTTERS
That's Lisa Berger?
WENDY
Do you see what I'm talking about?
BUTTERS
She's pretty!
WENDY
That's how people like Kim Kardashian destroy the self-mage of little girls everywhere.
BUTTERS
Hold on. Are you saying that girl wants to go out with me?
WENDY
What? What do you mean?
BUTTERS
And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this [sends it off] and then go buy her some flowers and then go tell her I love her. [runs out of the lab]
WENDY
Butters!
[South Park Elementary, afternoon. Cartman is at his locker. Butters walks into view carrying flowers and a gift.]
BUTTERS
Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger? [walks over to Cartman] Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen Lisa Berger anywhere?
CARTMAN
I saw that picture of her you put on the Internet.
BUTTERS
II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever.
CARTMAN
Uh, Butters, I don't know how to tell you this, but Lisa Berger is going out with Clyde.
BUTTERS
What?! Well since when?
CARTMAN
Dude, since like, noon or 12:30 today. [next shot is of Clyde walking down the hall with Lisa on his arm as he looks at his phone's screen. Everyone turns and stares at the new couple. They stop at Tolkien at his locker]
CLYDE
Hey, Tolkien. Tolkien, check out my girlfriend. [shows him the Photoshopped picture instead of the real deal]
TOLKIEN
Wow, she's hot.
CLYDE
Yeah, we just started dating seriously. [walks over to Tweek at his locker] You wanna meet my new girlfriend, Tweek?
TWEEK
Oh man, you're a lucky guy.
CLYDE
Yeah, I know. [walks off. Tweek turns back to his locker. The couple walks by Craig, Kevin, and two other boys]
CRAIG
Hey, Clyde. Nice score, dude.
OTHER BOYS
Yeah.
CLYDE
Oh, thanks, guys. [they walk by Wendy, who's speechless]
JIMMY
[walks up to Stan] Hey, Stan, did you see Clyde's going out with Lisa B-b-Berger?
STAN
Yeah, dude, she looks amazing. Clyde sent me her pics. [Wendy walks up to them, mad] She got really hot all of a sudden.
JIMMY
Yeah. I wouldn't mind t-tah-t-tappin' that ass.
WENDY
Excuse me!
STAN
Oh, hey, Wendy. Clyde sent me these. Don't be jel.
WENDY
Why would I be jel?
JIMMY
Well, y-you gotta admit, Lisa Berger is pretty hot, Wendy.
WENDY
She's not hot! That's supposed to be the point!
STAN
She looks pretty hot here.
WENDY
Lisa Berger is NOT HOT! She's fat and ugly! [just then, Lisa and Clyde walk past her, but she doesn't see this. Jimmy does, though.]
JIMMY
That's not very nice, Wendy.
LISA
What's your problem, Wendy?
WENDY
[looks and quickly assesses the situation] I'm sorry. It's nothing personal, Lisa.
LISA
You're just a hater. Why don't you mind your own business instead of being jelly?
WENDY
I am not jelly! I made that picture of you to prove a point, and it's being taken the wrong way!
CLYDE
It's okay, babe. Girls who don't have what you have are always going to put you down. [walks off with Lisa]
LISA
Thanks, babe.
[Mr. Mackey's office. Wendy is back in there, heh]
MR. MACKEY
Now, Wendy, I've tried to be patient with you 'cause you've always been a good student! M'kay?! But calling a little girl fat and ugly is NEVER m'kay!
WENDY
Mr. Mackey, I was trying to show kids that-
MR. MACKEY
No! No excuses! You have a problem bein' jelly, Wendy! Okay?! Just maybe, I should have you sent off to jelly school!
WENDY
Jelly school?
MR. MACKEY
That's right! In fact, I'm gonna call the jelly school right now, okay?! [picks up the receiver and starts pressing keys on the keypad] I'm sorry about this, but it's gone too far! I've had it![puts the receiver up to his ear] Hello, is this the jelly school?! ... Okay, I have a girl here who's extremely jelly! Uh, see if you can take her in for a few weeks! Okay, you're full? Okay, yeah, I guess she dodged a bullet this time, but she'd better watch her jelly behavior!
WENDY
Mr. Mackey, I appreciate the point you're trying to make.
MR. MACKEY
Yuh, you do? Okay, well I'm not actually on the phone with a... jelly school, Wendy, okay?
WENDY
Yes, I'm... I'm a few steps ahead of that, yes.
MR. MACKEY
Okay, well Wendy, I'm just tryin' to uh- Oh, bye, jelly school. [hangs up the phone] Uh, Wendy, I'm just tryin' to make you understand how serious it is when you lash out at other girls.
WENDY
Thank you, Mr. Mackey, I will... change.
MR. MACKEY
M-okay.
[Time Magazine Person Of The Year Award presentation. A man announces the award, a woman holds it up]
HOST
Ladies and Gentlemen, it my my honor to give the Person of the Year award to this year's winner, Pope Francis. [fanfare plays as the pope comes out from the audience and goes on stage. He takes the mic]
POPE FRANCIS
Gracias, gracias, all of my children.
KANYE
[rushes up and takes the mic from the pope] Alright hold up! Hold up! I'm sorry pope, but hold up! I just gotta say this! If my fiancée is a hobbit, then uh, [turns away and calls Kim up]Then what, bitch? Okay, yeah yeah [turns back to the audience] Okay, if she... was... if she is a hobbit, then, how come she don't turn blue when goblins are near? [jumps] Oh, you didn't think of that! Oh, I guess she's not a hobbit then! She must be a beautiful, sexy woman!
POPE FRANCIS
[grabs the mic for a moment and enunciates] The hobbit doesn't turn blue around goblins, just his sword does.
KANYE
Man, get the fuck out of here, you hobbit trivia bitch! [shoves the pope away, and the pope leaves] Who the fuck asked you?! [turns to the audience again] Nobody is talkin' any more shit about my woman! Alright?! She is gorgeous! If she was here, you could all see for yourselves how beautiful she is! But she can't be here because she has a movie comin' out on Friday, directed by Peter Jackson, called The Hobbit! Hold up. [turns away and calls Kim up] Bitch, that movie you got comin' out is called The Hobbit?... Yeah, but it- ... What? It's what? Ohhh yeah. Yup. Yeah, I got it. Yup. Yup. Lemme tell them. Love you too. [blows two quick kisses at the phone, hangs up, and turns to the audience.] Kim is not even in that movie! That movie is just loosely based on her television show, Keepin' Up With The Kardashians, which is a show about short, loud, little people living in a fantasy world! Hold. Up![turns away and calls Kim up] Bitch, if you're the hobbit, you need to let me know right now, 'cause I'm makin' a fool of myself out here!
[South Park Elementary Gym, day. The cheerleaders are performing during a game break]
CHEERLEADERS:
Yeah yeah, do we rock?!
Yeah yeah, take it to the top!
Yeah yeah, are we gonna stop?!
No way! No way!
WENDY
Cheer Squad roll call! [each cheerleader steps forward, announces her name, and steps back]
HEIDI
Heidi!
NICHOLE
Nichole!
BEBE
Bebe!
LOLA
Lola!
RED
Red!
ANNIE
Annie!
LISA
Lisa Berger! [the kids all cheer]
WENDY
And I'm your captain, Wendy! [silence. One kindergartner comes out of the bleachers with a picture of Lisa and has Lisa sign it. More cheers, and Lisa waves at the audience]
[South Park Elementary Gym, after the game. Wendy is upset that she got no cheers from the audience]
RED
Look, Wendy, we are all very happy for Lisa, okay? Nobody here is jelly. But the boys aren't even noticing the rest of us anymore.
BEBE
All we're asking is that you do for us what you did for Lisa and help with our imperfections.
WENDY
I won't do it, you guys! I'm sorry!
HEIDI
Why?! Don't you care about us?!
WENDY
Because it's wrong! If you guys aren't happy with the way you look, then that's your problem! [turns left and walks away]
LISA
[to the cheerleaders' left] Hey girls. [dressed in a hot outfit] Don't be sad. If you wanna look really hot, like me, you just gotta be willing to sweat. Get down to the gym and work!
[Total-Self Image, day, inside. The cheerleaders await instructions from a coach]
COACH
Alright girls, we're gonna trim that fat and tone those bodies. Let's do this! You first! [points to Bebe] Get right up there! [gets on a treadmill. The coach quickly moves around the treadmill and begins taking pictures] Alright, now look here. [Bebe quickly figures out what she needs to do and begins posing. Later on...] Come on, burn it off! You got this! [Bebe is shown editing the pictures the coach just took. She puts blush on her cheeks, lipstick on her lips, blonde eyebrows on her eyes, a fuller body of hair... Next, Red edits her picture. She puts on a cute, tiny smile and eye makeup. Annie removes the fat around her torso and augments her breasts, Heidi gives herself a new hairstyle, Nichole gets more tone and a shorter neck, tighter cheeks, straighter hair, eyebrows, a lighter shade of brown, eye makeup, lipstick, a more level head, fuller lips, breasts. Next is Lisa performing in a video, a parody of "Work Bitch". Next is a shot of the girls looking at their Photoshopped selves.]
COACH
[to Lola] Look at those thighs! Come on, you've gotta push harder! [Lola removes some fat from her midsection and gives herself a bow on her shirt, then straightens out her head. Even Timmy, who isn't a cheerleader, gets the Photoshop treatment. His wheelchair is removed, he's given proper, working legs, his shirt is lengthened and given a collar, he's given more hair and his eyes are made to look forward, his mouth is fixed and he's given a coat. Red drinks from a water bottle while Lola is sweating from the hard work. All the while, Lisa raps]
LISA
You wanna?
You, you, you wanna?
You wanna?
You wanna look pretty?
You want a boyfriend?
You want a nice ass?
You better work out, slut!
You want nice things?
You want boys to give you nice things?
You better work out, slut!
Now get to work, slut!
Party in the cookie trough!
Party in the cookie trough!
Party in the cookie trough!
You better work out, whore!
[South Park Elementary, playground, day. The boys are gathered on the merry-go-round, looking at pictures of the cheerleaders on Craig's phone.]
THE BOYS
Wooowww!
JIMMY
Wow! Wow! She looks great!
CARTMAN
Whoa, look at Bebe! [her picture is shown] I had no idea Bebe was that hot.
CRAIG
Yeah, but did you see Tolkien's girlfriend? [flips through the pictures until he gets to Nichole]
THE BOYS
Wooowww!
CLYDE
Uh, my bitch is still the hottest, you guys.
BUTTERS
No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim! [Craig flips back to her]
KYLE
Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes!
CARTMAN
Did you not see Erica Smith's boobs, Kyle? They're like perfect water balloons.
BUTTERS
I do love water balloons. [the boys fall silent and continue viewing the pictures. Stan gets sad and leaves; viewing all those pictures, not one of them of Wendy, disheartened him]
[The school hallway, moments later. Wendy is at her locker, and Stan approaches]
STAN
Hey, Wendy, uh, can I ask you a big favor?
WENDY
[curt] What?
STAN
A lot of the pictures I have of you are kind of outdated, and um, you know, I wanna be able to show everyone how pretty you are.
WENDY
So you want a Photoshopped picture of me to take away any imperfections, is that it?! How DARE you, Stan?!
STAN
Wendy, why is it such a big deal?
WENDY
Because people should be okay with the way they look! I have pimples on my forehead! My bottom teeth are crooked! So what?! You have short legs.
STAN
[looks down] I do? [kids begin to walk by]
WENDY
Yeah. [begins to point out other kids' defects] And Jason has freckles, and Billy Turner has narrow shoulders. [The cheerleaders come into view and approach Wendy and Stan. Neither of them notices] The cheerleaders? Bebe has acne. Lola's arms are too short. Nichole's eyes are puffy. Annie has thin hair. [Mr. Mackey walks in on the rant] And Heidi Turner's butt is flat! [Wendy turns to leave, but runs into the cheerleaders and Mr. Mackey] Oh God damn it!
BEBE
[furious] You! HATER!
MR. MACKEY
[incensed] WENDY, IN MY OFFICE, RIGHT NOW! MKAY?!
WENDY
Ugh!
[Kanye West video, a spoof of "Bound 2"]
KANYE (BACKUP SINGERS)
(Oh yeah, babe. Oh yeah, baby.)
One thing I know, my girl ain't no hobbit.
She might be stumpy; that don't mean she a hobbit.
She's not a hobbit 'cause she couldn't be.
She got no Bagginses in her family tree.
Yes on occasion she hangs out with her dwarf friends.
But she never went on no quest with her dwarf friends.
Except for one time she went to kill that dragon.
She took his gold and she- [he stops the video shoot]
Hang on a minute, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [calls up Kim yet again] Bitch, remember when you went off to kill that dragon with them dwarves? ... Yeah. Oh yeah. Rightrightrightright, yup. Yup, I got it. Yep, love you too. [blows two quick kisses at the phone, hangs up, and resumes the shoot.]
It wasn't no dragon, so my girl ain't no hobbit.
That was a Quizno's and my bitch went to rob it.
'Cause they got that ham that she robs on her cellulite.
While she drinking her grog and singin' those merry songs... at night...
My girl ain't no hobbit.
Please God, tell me I'm not engaged to no hobbit.
(Kim is not a hobbit.)

WENDY
Let's just get back to cheering, okay?!
HEIDI

[stops just outside the gym] Something that should have been done a long time ago! [walks away]
[Channel 9 Morning News, with Tom and Tammy Thompson]
ANNOUNCER
It's the morning news, with Tom and Tammy Thompson.
TAMMY
A little girl is making big waves with her fight against Photoshop.
TOM
Nine-year-old Wendy Testaburger has started a campaign, and tomorrow will speak before the state senate to ban the use of Photoshopped images, saying they're harmful to young girls. [a taped interview is shown.] Young lady, what is your message?
WENDY
Watching what Photoshop is doing to society... Little girls are aspiring to have bodies they can't possibly have! We have to put a stop to it.
TOM
And you're not just... being a hater.
WENDY
...Nooo.
TOM
'Cause sometimes, girls who aren't well-liked, you know, lash out at pretty and popular girls. Are, are you well-liked at your school?
WENDY
[thinks about it] Not lately, no.
TOM
Uh huh. But you're not being jelly?
WENDY
NO. That has nothing to do with me wanting to protest against Photoshopped images!
TOM
Okay, because I do understand that the jelly school in Aurora is ready to take you in. Is that right, Rick?
RICK
Tom, I'm standing in front of the jelly school, where officials claim they do have room for this little hater girl. We're being told if she doesn't stop the-
WENDY
That's not a jelly school, that's a Dunkin' Donuts!
RICK
[looks over his left shoulder] Well, okay, but, you are a hater.
WENDY
That's fine! [leaves her seat] People can call me whatever names they want to! I don't care! There is a cancer in our country, and I'm not going to rest until Photoshopped images are required to be labeled for what they are! Fake! And nothing in this world is going to stop me!
[The Testaburger house, Wendy's bedroom, night. Her bedroom door opens and a silhouette of Kanye is at the door. He walks in and closes the door, walks to her night stand and turns on the lamp. Wendy wakes up, looks, and jumps up]
WENDY
Agh! What do you want?
KANYE
[sits on her chair and begins to read a sad story. He sniffs from time to time] Once upon a time, there was a little hobbit who lived in the forest. And all the hobbit ever wanted was to be beautiful. And even though she was short and fat and hairy, this little hobbit dreamed that one day she could be pretty like Beyoncé. [clears his throat] And then one day, along came a magic power, called Photoshop. And just like that, poof, the little hobbit was beautiful. And even though she still couldn't sing like Beyoncé, or dance like Beyoncé, or act like Beyoncé, or be a decent human being like Beyoncé, the little hobbit was looked up to and loved, just like Beyoncé! [takes a tissue from Wendy's tissue box and wipes away his tears with it] Soon she had money, and adoration, and a hip-hop fiancée who loved her very much- [turns away, getting choked up] I'm sorry, hold up. Hold up, I'm sorry. [returns to reading] Everything was good for the hobbit. But then this mean little girl, called the Jelly Monster, she was sooo jelly of the hobbit that she told everyone she was a liar, and the hobbit's fiancée realized she was just a hobbit. And you know what he said? He said "I don't CARE!" And then the jelly monster came and tried to take the magic power away from the little hobbit, so the hobbit prayed to God, and God said "Don't worry, little hobbit. I will go find this jelly monster girl, and I will read her a story and melt her icy heart." And the hobbit said "Thank you," and the hobbit and God lived happily ever after in the shower forever 'cause I love her so much! [breaks down and cries] I'm sorry, hold up. Hold up. Hold up. I'm sorry.
WENDY
Ah, ah I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I have been jelly.
KANYE
[still a wreck] Sorry, hold up, I'm sorry, it's okay. Hold up, hold on, I'm sorry.
WENDY
No no, I've been a hater, and I really am sorry.
KANYE
Sorry, sorry, that's okay. I've been jelly before too. I'm sorry.
[South Park Elementary, morning. As kids pass each other in the hall, Wendy is in the computer lab looking at her picture. She begins to edit it, First she gives her hair a new style, then lifts her beret an inch or two, and shrinks her head. She makes more changes and tears begin to well up in her eyes. She now has hips, breasts, lipstick, blush, eyebrows and eyelashes. She's done, and clicks the Send button, which brings up a confirmation box which asks "Mass Email File 'My Pic'?". She moves the cursor to "Yes". The mouse doesn't move after that, and she clicks on "Yes". She wipes away her tears, pushes herself away from the computer, and leaves the computer lab.]
