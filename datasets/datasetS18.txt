synopsis:The boys start a company and seek funding for it on Kickstarter.

script:Go Fund Yourself

[South Park, outside. The rising sun beats brightly on the town. Bouncy music plays as the boys' houses are visited.
Cartman's room. He's awake, staring at the ceiling, thinking.]
CARTMAN
Boner balls. Boner balls-boner... Boner forest. Dense... boner forest.
[Stan's kitchen. Stan is at the breakfast nook eating Astro Pops in milk, and he too is thinking.]
STAN
Pungent crotch sweat. Pungent milk- milky crotch spooge.
[The bus stop. Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny await the bus.]
KYLE
Barking vaginal belch.
CARTMAN
Protruding vaginal boner.
KENNY
(Dilapidated titties incorporated.)
CARTMAN
Oh, I like that. [the bus rolls up and the boys get on board]
[Inside the bus.]
BUTTERS
[pops up out of his seat and looks behind it] Rotten boobie turds!
STAN
Nah.
KYLE
Bloody butt cough.
STAN
[passively] Uh huh.
[A Law Office. Stan reads possible site names from a list he compiled from his friends' suggestions to a live domain name registrar.]
STAN
Angry Clit Spasm
REGISTRAR
[types the name into a who is and waits for results] Nope, sorry.
STAN
Whooping Fart Balls.
REGISTRAR
Nnnnnope.
STAN
Lubricated Titty Burgers.
REGISTRAR
That's taken too.
STAN
[frustrated] Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge!
REGISTRAR
Sorry.
CARTMAN
Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge is taken too?! Come! On!
KYLE
How are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken?!
REGISTRAR
I told you, you just have to be really original with with your company name. There's a lot of startup company these days. [the boys look at each other]
CARTMAN
Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly On The Table, Incorporated!
REGISTRAR
That's available! Congratulations!
[The Kickstarter Web site. A new project appears on it: "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC."]
[Stan's room. There should be five boys there, but Cartman is missing.]
KYLE
It... doesn't... quite roll off the tongue.
STAN
Dude, we're not gonna get any attention with that name.
BUTTERS
Man this sucks!
RANDY
[opens the door and peeks in] Uhhh, Stan? Aren't you supposed to be in school?
STAN
No. Dad, we don't need school anymore. We're forming a startup company.
RANDY
A startup company? A company that does what?
STAN
No, we don't wanna do anything.
KYLE
Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company.
BUTTERS
Yeah, we're sick of school! But all the good attention-getting startup names are taken.
RANDY
Wuhuhull, boys, there's more to starting a company than having a catchy name.
STAN
...Nnnno, there isn't. [turns back to his computer and fleshes out the project]
[The neighborhood, day. Cartman runs down the sidewalk]
CARTMAN
You guys! You guys, it's awesome! Holy shit you guys! [runs up to Stan's door and enters the house. He runs into Stan's room] You guys, I've got it!
STAN
What?
CARTMAN
It's the greatest startup company name EVER! [Kyle and Stan move in closer to Cartman]
KYLE
What?! Tell us!
CARTMAN
Washington. Redskins. [Kyle and Stan look at each other]
KYLE
Washington Redskins?
CARTMAN
It's sooo sweet!
STAN
I'm pretty sure that's taken, Cartman.
CARTMAN
It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo!
STAN
[lowers his head and strokes his chin] Washington Redskins. [raises his head] I like it!
KENNY
(Me too!)
KYLE
What?!
CARTMAN
Dude! There's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable!
KYLE
Wait. Guys, this, this doesn't seem legal.
CARTMAN
Kyle, you're not hearing me! The trademark has been pulled! We can do whatever we want!
[And so the boys get busy setting up a Washington Redskins office in town. Stan and Cartman put up a Redskins banner behind the desk. Kenny decorates the front of the desk. Stan finishes his part of the work and climbs down.]
STAN
[walks up to Kyle] You alright dude?
KYLE
Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original
CARTMAN
[climbs down the ladder and joins Stan and Kyle] It's a strong name, dude. It's like aggressive and masculine like Boner Forest, but Boner Forest was taken.
KYLE
Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for.
CARTMAN
We don't stand for anything. Remember our company plan, guys! [walks up to an easel with a 4 Point Plan on it] Start up, cash in, sell out, bro down.
KYLE
I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to.
BUTTERS
[at the computer] We already got a dollar!
STAN
What?! [Cartman walks up to Butters]
BUTTERS
One dollar pledge!
KENNY
(Yahoo!) [begins to dance]
CARTMAN
I told you guys! "Washington Redskins" totally gets people's attention!
BUTTERS
Another two dollars!
KYLE
No way!
CARTMAN
Sittin' on our asses, here we come!
[News 4 Update]
NEWS 4 ANCHOR
Another new startup company is gaining a lot of attention on the Internet. They're a company that does absolutely nothing, and they're called, the Washington Redskins. [the page loads and someone is scrolling through it] The Redskins started as what appeared to be some kind of adolescent prank, but almost overnight it has become one of the most heavily funded projects on Kickstarter. [scroll over, next is a teen boy] Why did you give five dollars to the Washington Redskins Kickstarter?
TEEN BOY
I dunno, I just. Uh. They don't do anything, that's pretty sweet. I dunno, I thought it was funny.
CARTMAN
[on a video on the Kickstarter site] By pledging just one or two dollars, you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff. If you pledge $10 or more, you will receive this luxurious company micro badge.
NEWS 4 ANCHOR
It's called crowd-funding, using the Internet to raise money without having to pay back your investors, a tactic that some believe is unfair and impersonal.
[The new Redskins office. Cartman takes a call]
CARTMAN
Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself. [Butters walks across the room] Sure, we'd be happy to take your money. Yup. Go to our Kickstarter page. Okay, nice, idiot. Uh huh, fuck you, bye bye.
BUSINESSMAN
[walks in with two other men] You are Eric Cartman?
CARTMAN
Yes, I know.
DAN SNYDER
My name is Dan Snyder. I'm the president and owner of the Washington Redskins
CARTMAN
Oh, cool. Please take a seat.
DAN SNYDER
Thank you, but I will stand.
CARTMAN
Nice, I like that.
DAN SNYDER
Young man, we ask that you please stop using the name Washington Redskins for your organization.
CARTMAN
Stop? But why?
DAN SNYDER
Because we are the Washington Redskins, and we are a football team! You have NO right to use our name to get attention!
CARTMAN
Uhhh, the trademark got pulled so I'm totaly free to use the name, actually. [phone rings, Eric reacts] Um, Butters, could you get that?
BUTTERS
[next to the phone, answers it. Stan is on his iPhone] Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.
DAN SNYDER
Look! Don't you see that when you call your organization "The Washington Redskins", its offensive to us?
CARTMAN
How is it offensive?
COACH
How is it offensive?! Jesus, what-?!
DAN SNYDER
We are a proud team, Mr. Cartman! We have no wish to be associated with people who actively do nothing!
COACH
Makes us feel like a joke.
CARTMAN
Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company "Washington Redskins," it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people. [grins, knowing that's not the reason.]
DAN SNYDER
Uh, I know I can't legally make you stop using our name, but, but won't you just do it out of decency?
CARTMAN
Mmmm, noooo, Because I don't want to. Aaaand we can't just change the name of our company 'cause it's like super hard. But hey, from one Redskin to another, go fuck yourself. [the men, dejected, turn and walk out the door]
[A Redskins jet in the sky. Snyder sits alone in it]
ROBIN MEADE
All around the world, people are saying they are inspired by the Washington Redskins. The Internet startup company has raised so much money in Kickstarter that now, more groups are doing the same.
REPORTER
[a reporter speaks as Snyder looks over hit masses pool] More news on the Washington Redskins tonight. Their defiant. F-You attitude has now caught the attention of the terrorist group ISIS. The terrorists said they admire the Washington Redskins and want to try it and follow their business model.
A CALLER
[a newspaper falls out of a car, and Snyder picks it up and reads it] Well, let's not forget, Marsha that there's a people here, okay, who are not happy about the use of the name, the Football Washington Redskins!
WOMAN
Well yeah, but does anyone really care about them? [he turns to the camera and sheds a tear, in the manner of Indian Eyes Cody (Espera Oscar de Corti)]
[Back at Washington Redskins headquarters...]
CARTMAN
Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid!
KYLE
[enters with Stan] Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them.
CARTMAN
Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk!
KYLE
People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!
CARTMAN
Digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the Washington Redskins are all about! [pounds the desk a couple of times.] Now come on, guys! If you wanna be a successful business, then you have to be honest about what you are! [pound] Once you take a stand on something, you're pretending like your company is about more than money. Then all of a sudden you're the NFL and and your players get caught molesting little boys!
KYLE
That's the Catholic Church!
CARTMAN
NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator!
KYLE
That's the NFL!
CARTMAN
It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters.
BUTTERS
[gasps] Oh no!
KYLE
All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking.
CARTMAN
Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man!
KYLE
Maybe I'll start my own company.
CARTMAN
Well that's fine! You can't call yourself "Washington Redskins!"
KYLE
I don't want to! It's a stupid name! [eerie music plays for a few seconds]
CARTMAN
Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle?
KYLE
Yeah. I guess... I guess everything is.
CARTMAN
Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too?
STAN
I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either.
CARTMAN
Well then, I wish you both well in your new venture. Good-bye. [Kyle and Stan walk out the door. Butters begins to follow them, but stops in his tracks.]
BUTTERS
Hang on, is this the company where I don't get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? Okay, I'm uh stayin' here.
[NFL Headquarters]
DAN SNYDER
Is the league just going to sit by and while my team and my players are compared to ISIS. You have to do something, Commissioner Goodell! What are you going to do about this?!
GOODELL
[sound clips come out of his mouth, indicating he's a robot] I will get it right, and do whatever is necessary to accomplish that.
DAN SNYDER
What?!
GOODELL
We will continue to identify and add expertise to our team.
DAN SNYDER
That's the most ridiculous nothing answer I've ever heard! What are you gonna do now?!
GOODELL
Everyone will participate in educating sessions starting in the next month.
DAN SNYDER
Ugh! This thing is broken!
GOODELL
We can add... and we will do more, do more, do more [winds down and continues in a high pitch]
DAN SNYDER
Get all the NFL owners on Skype! This thing is broken again!
[Skype session]
DAN SNYDER
And so I call upon the help of all owners. You cannot let my people be belittled like this!
JIM IRSAY
Dan, you don't wanna be dealin' with this stuff. Let the Goodell-bot do it.
DAN SNYDER
The stupid thing isn't working!
GOODELL
[starts up again] I will get it right.
STEVE BISCHIOTTI
Man, that thing hasn't worked right since we bought it.
DAN SNYDER
Look, my team is starting to lose hope. You have to use your influence to make these people change their name.
PAUL ALLEN
Did you tell them we're about honor and integrity?
ALEX SPANOS
If the Goodell bot is broken, we must stay out of it more than even usual!
DAN SNYDER
And so I'm alone? What if they ridicule the 49ers team next? Or make fun of Jerry Jones because his eyes are too far apart?
JERRY JONES
My eyes aren't too far apart!
PAUL ALLEN
If we get them to change their logo, will it make you happy?
DAN SNYDER
Uh I guess we can live with that.
JIM IRSAY
Then it is decided! We will make them change their logo. Begin mas behind-the-scenes under-the-table enforcement of our wishes NOW
OWNERS
Go! [all screens go blank]
DAN SNYDER
Thank God!
[A Washington Redskins announcement. Lots of cheering and applause. Cartman steps on stage before a giant Redskins logo]
CARTMAN
Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! "Fuck you." Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with. [An image of the office appears, with the new changes] To begin with, we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we didn't stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you'll all agree is very exciting. [a pair of tits and male genitalia are added to the original logo, to much cheer and applause] Now when people hear the name "Redskins", they will immediately think "titties" and "balls". It's just a bold new way that we can say "We don't fucking care." Go Redskins! [cheering and applause]
[Kyle's room. He and Stan are discussing their new company - it's "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC." resurrected]
KYLE
It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go!
STAN
Yeah...
KYLE
You okay, bro?
STAN
I just... never saw myself owning a company called "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC."
KYLE
Give it time, it'll grow on you.
STAN
Why don't we just call it "Untitled Startup Company"?
KYLE
Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan!
STAN
Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title.
KYLE
Well whattaya mean?
STAN
I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it.
KYLE
Oh. Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table" is holding you back. [Stan slowly walks to the door, then turns around]
STAN
Good luck with your company, dude.
KYLE
Yeah. Good luck with yours. [Stan leaves and closes the door]
[Kickstarter Headquarters, night.]
EMPLOYEE
It's just... incredible, Harry. Everyone is using Kickstarter for everything!
HARRY
And for every project funded, we get 5%.
EMPLOYEE
It's like, we don't even have to do anything and we just make money.
HARRY
Sitting on our asses, here we come.
[Kickstarter, moments later. Tribal music comes up. Dan Snyder rises from the bushes]
DAN SNYDER
Caw-CAW, Caw-CAW. [his football team rises from the bushes and gather behind him] HooHOO, hoohooHOO. [other players appear and they all move in. A player sneaks past a Kickstarter employee]
EMPLOYEE 2
[lowers his cup] Huh? [goes back to sipping coffee. Two more players sneak past him, and #88 tackles him moments later. Number 28 tackles another employee. Pretty soon all the employees are targeted. Two players make it to the servers and head-butt them, causing damage to them. Number 48 kicks the head off one of the employees. An uninjured female waits for an elevator. The doors open, she goes in, and number 28 spooks her. She screams. Later, Kickstarter is in flames]
[South Park, morning]
CARTMAN
Goooood morning, guys!
BUTTERS
Happy Deadline Day!
CARTMAN
We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline!
BUTTERS
Oh boy, this is like Christmas morning!
CARTMAN
[tries to visit his page, but it's not coming up] What the hell? Can't find the server? [tries again] Kickstarter.com! [not found] Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth!
BUTTERS
It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary!
KENNY
(What?!)
BUTTERS
Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!
CARTMAN
What?!
BUTTERS
Somebody killed Kickstarter!
CARTMAN
Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?! [gasps] Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle!
[Kyle's room. He's having trouble accessing the site too.]
KYLE
What the hell is wrong? "Can't find the server" Kickstarter. [Cartman barges in with Butters and Kenny in tow]
CARTMAN
You son of a bitch!
KYLE
What?!
CARTMAN
You broke Kickstarter!
KYLE
No, I just can't get it to load.
CARTMAN
Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be!
KYLE
My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?!
CARTMAN
Well, somebody did!
STAN
It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here. [walks up to the boys] Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other.
KYLE
He's right. We should do a merger.
CARTMAN
[shocked] A merger?! It's too late for that, you guys! Kickstarter is gone! We don't have a company! We don't have anything! [begins walking out the door]
KYLE
Yes we do! We have a sweet name. [Cartman turns around] I was wrong, Cartman. "Washington Redskins" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it.
CARTMAN
[steps forward] It is really sweet.
STAN
And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,
BUTTERS
Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times!
KYLE
Whattaya say, Cartman?
[Third Redskins announcement. Cartman comes out on stage again to cheers and applause]
CARTMAN
Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks! [the cheering and applause die down] How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it.
KYLE
[joins Cartman onstage] When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself. [The modified Redskin logo fades to a single line saying "GO FUND YOURSELF"] And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%.
CARTMAN
You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is the biggest "fuck you" we have ever come up with. But we didn't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo. [The neo logo comes up - it's two of the old logo, with titties and balls and penises, one taking the other from behind. This receives cheers and applause]
CARTMAN AND KYLE
Go Redskins!
[Arlington Stadium. A helicopter shot of the stadium]
ANNOUNCER
A beautiful night in Arlington, Texas as the Dallas Cowboys get set to take on the Washington Redskins. That is, of course, Washington Redskins the football team, not Washington Redskins, the audacious crowd-funding company.
COMMENTATOR
Yeah, and if you ask me, the Redskins are a scam.
ANNOUNCER
You're talking about the crowd-funding company- Redskins, right?
COMMENTATOR
That's right. An-and now you've got terrorist groups like ISIS using the Redskins to raise their money. I-I don't like what the Redskins are doing.
ANNOUNCER
Those Redskins
COMMENTATOR
Yeah, whatever.
[The Visitors locker room. The Redskins sit there looking morose, even their owner Dan Snyder. Somber Native American music play]
#35
It's over. Our name has been reduced to a stereotype and a joke.
#59
Yeah, let's just go home.
DAN SNYDER
No. No, we cannot give up! We have been through too much together. We have fought Eagle, and Bear! The Eagles only beat us by three points.
#92
Yeah, but I just feel pretty stupid wearing this now.
#72
Yeah.
#35
Come on, guys.
#8
Where will we go? What will we do? [and with that his players desert him]
DAN SNYDER
Don't let them break you! Don't let them win! [as kickoff approaches, a Native American drumbeat starts up]
ANNOUNCER
And the Cowboys are still set to kick off, but there doesn't seem to be anyone to kick off to.
COMMENTATOR
Yeah, and Jerry Jones must be happy this means a forfeit, another win for the Cowboys. [with his bright chameleon eyes and a woman popping up from between his legs, he must indeed be happy. Mellow Native American music joins the drumbeat]
ANNOUNCER
Wait a minute, it appears a lone Redskin is making his way out of the locker room. [Dan Snyder comes out, not in uniform, but willing to face down the Cowboys. The referee blows the whistle and the game starts.] The Cowboys kick it off. [Snyder catches it, but the Cowboys quickly pile up on him, then get off]
DAN SNYDER
[dusts himself off] Hut! Hut Hut Hut! [the Cowboys pile up on him again, then get off. He dusts himself off] Hut hut hut. Hut Hut Hut Hut! [the Cowboys pile up on him again, then get off. He dusts himself off. He's quite beat up now] Hut. Hut hut hut. Hut Hut! [the Cowboys pile up on him again, then get off. The crowd finally reacts]
CROWD
Oh!
FAN WEARING #3
Just stay down! For the love of God!
DAN SNYDER
[barely able to move] Hut hut. Hut! [the Cowboys pile up on him again, then get off. He dusts himself off]
FAN WEARING #74
Stop! Make it stop!
FAN WEARING #82
Just stay down!
ANOTHER FAN
Please!
FAN WEARING A BLUE STAR
Just make him stay down!
OTHER FANS
Go Redskins! Go Redskins!
[Washington Redskins, now a crowd-funding company. Stan is at the armchair sipping Coke, Cartman is kicking back on the couch, Butters is at the desk working a paddleball, Kyle reads from a book, and Kenny is on a tablet]
STAN
Boy, this is the life, huh guys?
BUTTERS
We finally did it!
CARTMAN
I just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch. [a brick flies in through a window and shards flow into the room]
KYLE
What the heck is that? [the boys leave the building to investigate]
[Outside headquarters, they face a protest]
CARTMAN
Whoa, whoa! What?
PROTESTOR #1
Change your name!
PROTESTOR #2
It doesn't belong in today's society!
KYLE
Change our name?
STAN
But you all thought our name was sweet.
PROTESTOR #3
There's nothing sweet about a people who were decimated. A once proud nation that finally lost hope and left their leader to be massacred by Cowboys in a defiant last stand!
KYLE
When was that?
PROTESTOR #4
Last night.
PROTESTOR #5
Until you change your name, we are asking all your subscribers to boycott you.
ISIS SPOKESMAN
That's right! ISIS will no longer use your insensitive company for its fundraising!
CROWD
Yeah! Alright!
PROTESTOR #1
Good for you, ISIS!
KYLE
Well what the hell do we do?
CARTMAN
[sighs and his voice drops] I guess we gotta go back to school. [they boys turn left and walk away, their heads hanging down. The protesters keep cheering until they're gone.]
End of Go Fund Yourself

synopsis:South Park goes gluten free after they find out their dick will fly off if they don't.

script:Gluten Free Ebola

[South Park Elementary, day. The boys are indeed back at school, their crowdfunding venture having fizzled on the fires of an offensive trademark. Students head to their classrooms. The main four come in looking bright and ready to go]
KYLE
Hey guys!
STAN
Morning!
CARTMAN
How's it going, everybody?
KYLE
Sup, Jason? [Jason turns and walks away angrily]
CARTMAN
Hey dude. Sup? [they encounter Tolkien, Craig, and Jimmy.]
CRAIG
What are you guys doing here?
CARTMAN
What do you mean? We're just... going to school.
JIMMY
I thought you guys said you didn't need school.
TOLKIEN
Yeah, you said you had a startup company and that school was for douchebags.
KYLE
Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out.
CRAIG
But you told us all to go fuck ourselves.
CARTMAN
Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was-
CRAIG
[keeps pressing] You told us your company was gonna make $10 million, and the rest of us could go fuck ourselves.
KYLE
We were- trying to be funny.
JIMMY
Yeah well, no one's laughing, Kyle. [Tolkien, Craig and Jimmy split up, then everyone else goes their separate ways. Moments later, Wendy is shown at her locker]
STAN
[walks up] Hey Wendy.
WENDY
You're... back?
STAN
Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out.
WENDY
[sarcastic] Oh wow, I'm shocked.
STAN
So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie-
WENDY
You broke up with me, Stan! You said you had to be "free to chase your dreams".
STAN
Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing.
WENDY
Is that why you told Clyde that you broke up with me? Because you're about to be [does air quotes] "dripping in bitches"?!
STAN
Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says? [Wendy closes her locker and faces him]
WENDY
I'm happy, Stan. I'm happy I know who you really are now. You're someone who can't be counted on! You're someone who can just bail on the people you love! [turns around and walks away]
[The cafeteria, lunchtime. Cartman looks around]
CARTMAN
Dude, people are pissed off at us.
KENNY
(Yeah, it's fucking crazy!)
KYLE
Doesn't anyone understand the significance of "I'm sorry" anymore?
CARTMAN
Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?
KYLE
Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school.
[Faculty room]
PRICIPAL VICTORIA
All right everyone, thanks for coming. As you know, we urgently need to discuss the matter of Butters Stotch, who set fire to the school gymnasium and is now asking to come back. Are we all set to start?
WOMAN
Almost. We're just waiting on Mr. Mackey. Again.
MR. ADLER
Awww, do we need Mackey here?
MR. GARRISON
Yeah, all he's gonna talk about is how he's gluten-free now and feels sooo fuckin' amazing.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, you have to admit he does look a little better.
MR. ADLER
He doesn't look any different to me.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
In the cheeks, you don't think he looks a little fuller?
MR. GARRISON
It's just the new diet fad! [a door opens]
MR. MACKEY
Sorry I'm late. I had to stop and get my own breakfast because I figured y'all would be having doughnuts, but I'm actually gluten-free, so I can't have doughnuts, m'kay?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Yes, Mr. Mackey, we're all aware that you're gluten-free now.
MR. MACKEY
I'm just sayin' that I personally feel sooo fuckin' amazing
MR. GARRISON
[exasperated, face in his hands] Can we discuss the gymnasium and get out of here, please?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Right, so the issue, as you all know, is that Butters set fire to the gymnasium last week and ran away laughing and flipping everyone off.
MR. MACKEY
That's probably gluten, m'kay?
COACH
Oh, God!
MR. MACKEY
Gluten causes sluggishness, irritability, and nearly all behavioral problems,
MR. GARRISON
I seriously cannot take hearing about gluten anymore.
MR. MACKEY
See, that's probably the gluten talkin', uhkay? If you cut out gluten, you don't ever get pissed off.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[surprized and interested] Really? Mwell I might just give this gluten-free thing a try. How does it work?
MR. GARRISON
Oh, no, don't try- oh God, here we go.
[The school gym, day. Gutted by the fire, but not condemned. The fourth graders are inside during their PE period. The girls jump rope, the boys try to make baskets through a badly damaged hoop. Other boys toss basketballs at each other, while Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny sit on the burnt bleachers.]
KYLE
I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.
KENNY
(Right. What the fuck is going on?)
CARTMAN
You know what we gotta do, guys? [gets off the bleachers] We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party
KENNY
(A party?!)
CARTMAN
Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool!
KYLE
Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.
CARTMAN
Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them.
KYLE
[joins him on the floor] Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us.
CARTMAN
Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for...
STAN
[joins them on the floor] For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!
CARTMAN
What?
KYLE
No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.
CARTMAN
We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band!
KYLE
A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?
STAN
Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something.
CARTMAN
Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live.
KENNY
(This will be awesome!)
CARTMAN
So who do we throw the party for?
STAN
What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down. [Pink's "Get This Party Started" begins to play, which serves as transitional music to the next scene]
[WSPIC 88.3, on air. The Camera pans down to the DJ]
DJ
All right, that was "Get This Party Started" and joining me in the studio now are four local boys who are gearing up to throw the most epic party ever. Is that right, boys?
KYLE
Yeah, it's going to be this weekend.
CARTMAN
You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time.
DJ
Now, this party is also for a good cause, because it's to honor a little boy with diabetes, Scott Malkinson. Is that correct?
CARTMAN
You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson.
STAN
Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him.
DJ
Must be pretty special having a big party in your honor, Scott. How does it feel?
SCOTT
I actually have plans this weekend.
CARTMAN
"I actually have plans this weekend. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got diabetes."
DJ
All right, well, we've got lots of people callin' in. Caller, what's your question?
CRAIG
Are you guys making this up?
KYLE
Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!
CRAIG
All the pizza we can eat?
CARTMAN
Believe it, dude.
CRAIG
All right, this better be good.
DJ
All right, it's sure to be a blast. Phone lines are going craaazy!
STAN
Sweet!
DJ
Next caller, what's your question?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Yes, will there be gluten-free options for people at this party?
STAN
Excuse me?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well I've been gluten-free for about a day now, and I have to say I feel sooo amazing. I just want to make sure there's food for all of us.
DJ
Mark in Fairplay, you had a comment?
MARK
Yeah, I agree with the last caller. I was in a restaurant and ordered the gluten-free quinoa salad, and a guy right next to me was eating a sandwich. It's like "Get your second-hand gluten away from me!"
DJ
All right, all right, next caller, you got a question for the boys?
MR. GARRISON
Yeah, I swear, if I hear another person talking about being gluten-free I'm gonna piss in their face.
CARTMAN
What the hell is gluten?
[Park County community center, night. Most everyone in town is at the meeting tonight.]
JOHN GARNER
Hello everyone, my name is John Garner and I'm a nutrition advisor from the USDA. I want to clarify the USDA's position on a healthy diet. There's been a lot of confusion about gluten lately. People saying that gluten is the cause of cancer, gluten should be avoided, gluten can make your dick fly off, but let's set the record straight.
RANDY
[To Gerald] Make your dick fly off?
JOHN GARNER
People believe that omitting gluten will make you healthier, but of course, that's a bunch of hooey. Hooey is the preservative found in processed foods, that we now believe is the main culprit of obesity. You might say "Well there's fat in butter too," but that's just poppycock. Poppycock first came from India and is the key ingredient in red meat which we now realize is good for you along with hooey. The good hooey, not the bad hooey. So what is gluten?
MR. GARRISON
Yes, thank you!
JOHN GARNER
Simply put, gluten is the protein found in flour when you take all the starch away. [holds up a stalk of wheat]. Flour is of course, just wheat, and when you add a liquid to flour, you get dough. [grabs a wad of dough] Dough that makes breads, doughnuts, pasta, and all the hooey-free foods that humans enjoy. [puts the dough into a special washer. The extract going through a distillation process] Now, if we wash the dough of all its starch, we can actually distil the wheat down, minus the water, minus the starch, and what we're left with is pure gluten. Not a bio-weapon, just harmless flour protein.
MR. MACKEY
Then eat it!
JOHN GARNER
Excuse me?
MR. MACKEY
If it's not dangerous, then eat that pure concentrated gluten, okay?
JOHN GARNER
[looks at the gluten, then at the audience, then moves the gluten to his lips] Yeah. Alright. [sips it down] Dup, dup. [his body contorts as he groans. Everyone in the audience begins to panic. He shows signs of burning up, and his groin begins to set off electrical sparks. His penis wriggles out of there and soon launches itself.]
MR. MACKEY
Oh, you see that? His dick's flyin' off. [people begin to leave the community center. The penis escapes and comes back to knock a man down]
[Papa John's Pizza is shown. The townsfolk run right past it.]
STEPHEN
[stops] Oh my God! These people don't even know! [faces the pizza joint] Hurry! You gotta go!
MR. GARRISON
[stops as well] Oh Jesus! Hey! It isn't safe in there! [inside, two workers just stand around behind the counter] Get out of there!
STEPHEN
Get out! You're not safe!
MR. GARRISON
You gotta get out!
STEPHEN
Hurry! You gotta go!
[The Marsh kitchen. Randy opens the cupboard and pulls everything out of it, including foods like Choc-Block Cookies, Circus Cookies, Fudge-Stuffed Fingerlings, Granny's Mac 'n Cheese, Frosted O-Face-O's and Puffed Up. Sharon does the same at another cupboard, removing items like Candy Corn Oreos, Thwizlerz and Cheesey Poofs; packing them in a white garbage bag with other foods like Hamburger Helper, Fiber-O's, Muffin Top, Chicken Nuggets and Beef Burritos. They're both in a panic. Shelly and Stan appear at the kitchen entrance.]
RANDY
What about the Powerbars? The Powerbars?
SHARON
Yes!
RANDY
Hamburger Helper?
SHARON
That's all gluten!
RANDY
There's hot dog buns in that cupboard, Sharon!
SHARON
Hey, dad, I need to talk to you about this party we're having.
RANDY
Oh my God, the WHEAT THINS!
SHARON
It's in the Triscuits too, Randy!
STAN
Wait, wait, ah I might need those.
RANDY
This stuff will make your dick fly off, Stan!
SHARON
Don't forget the freezer!
RANDY
Oh God! [now clearing the freezer] Chicken nuggets - breaded! Frozen burritos - flour! Ice cream! What about ice cream?!
SHARON
I don't know! Look at the ingredients!
RANDY
Heavy cream, sugar, chocolate syrup - no, ice cream's good for you!
SHARON
All right, that's all of it!
RANDY
You sure? All r- all right, you got those?!
SHARON
I can get both of these, yeah!
RANDY
All right, come on! [a loaf of whole wheat sandwich bread falls out. Moments later, Randy comes back for it, then leaves again]
[Kyle's room, night. Kyle is working on the party's budget when his phone rings. It's Cartman]
KYLE
Hey Cartman.
CARTMAN
KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE!
KYLE
Dude, calm down.
CARTMAN
THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!
KYLE
Who took all the pizza and the cake? [begins to notice flickering lights outside his window and hears an approaching crowd. All the gluten-tainted food that people have been bagging is being thrown into a bonfire] What the hell?
CARTMAN
KYYYLE!
[A wheat field outside of town. Rolling hills of wheat are shown when the start turning brown. A flamethrower begins burning the field. A man wielding the flamethrower appears walking methodically through the field]
MR. GARRISON
Yeah! Get it! Get it all! Yeah, that's it! Burn, you bastard!
FARMER
What are you doing?!? My farm!
RANDY
Son of a bitch! Did you not know or did you just not care?! Keeyah! [knocks him down with a right punch to the right cheek]
[U.S.D.A. Strategic Command Center, FDA approved, day.]
TOM VILSACK
There's panic all over the country and you're telling me you don't have any kind of containment on this thing?!
RESEARCHER
We're working as fast as we can, sir.
TOM VILSACK
[sighs loudly] Are you sure it's gluten that started the reaction?
RESEARCHER
[they stop by a rat cage] We gave these rats an injection of concentrated whole wheat bread just a short time ago. You can see it already having a negative effect. [the rat is having an arousal it can't control. It flips over on its back, its penis wriggling out and shooting off. The rat dies.]
TOM VILSACK
We told people that whole wheat bread was healthy! Isn't wheat the ingredient in pasta that makes it healthy?
RESEARCHER
No. We believe now that that's poppycock.
TOM VILSACK
[to everyone on the floor] All right, listen up! We have the obligation to make this thing right and to tell people what is and isn't safe to eat. We are the USDA! Without us, people would be eating dirt and... chairs. Whatever it takes, stop this crisis! [turns left and leaves. Another rat in the background loses its penis and dies.]
[Cartman's room. Cartman is in bed with a slight cough. He blows his nose, and his door opens. the boys enter]
KYLE
Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up.
CARTMAN
What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck.
STAN
We can't let our party suck.
CARTMAN
What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde.
KYLE
That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?
STAN
[looks down, then] I'll be back. [turns and leaves]
CARTMAN
You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.
KYLE
Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up.
CARTMAN
[turns to his right side] There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse.
[The Marsh house. The bell rings and Randy answers it.]
RANDY
Yes?
WORKER 1
Hello, sir. We've had word of a possible gluten exposure in your home. May we come in?
RANDY
Gluten expohn... oh not here!
WORKER 2
Can we come in please?
RANDY
Wuh sure! [shows them in. They enter and their gluten meters crackle as they go around the house]
SHARON
[coming down the stairs] What's going on? [one of the workers stops at the kitchen wastebasket and pulls out a pair of tongs. He rifles through the trash can with it and pulls out a Pabst Blue Ribbon can]
RANDY
Well that's just a beer.
WORKER 1
Oh Jesus.
SHELLY
BEER IS ALL WHEAT, DAD!!
RANDY
[to Shelly] Shuut up, [to the worker] beer is bad for you?!
WORKER 2
We're gonna need you to come with us, sir. Don't touch me.
RANDY
Look, I'm OK! Yuh, you wanna see my dick?
WORKER 1
We just need you to be in quarantine for a while until everyone figures out what's going on.
RANDY
No! Not Papa John's. [shakes his head] I don't wanna go to Papa John's! [shakes his head more violently] YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO TO PAPA JOOOHN'S!!
[Papa John's, day. It is now Gluten Quarantine Center 1, and Randy's the newest quarantine. Outside are one of the workers and a soldier]
RANDY
How long do I have to stay here?!
SOLDIER
Until the USDA gets control of the situation, sir.
RANDY
What am I supposed to eat?
SOLDIER
It's okay, there's lots of toppings. Just eat the toppings. [the soldier and the worker walk away]
A QUARANTINE
How'd you get exposed? [it's a blond man on the floor] Bagels? Gravy?
RANDY
Beer. I didn't know it had gluten.
MR. GARRISON
There's always somethin'. For me it was the soy sauce. [his voice grows soft] Sneaky, sneaky soy sauce.
[USDA headquarters, day]
JEFF
We're trying to get a handle on just how much gluten there is out there, but... It seems impossible to contain.
TOM VILSACK
And we have no idea how to tell people to protect themselves?
RESEARCHER
[approaches with an open laptop] We've been running simulations, but they're problematic because they don't relate to our current schematics. Here, look. This is what we've been recommending for the past three years. [Shown is a food tray with dish and cup on it. The dish has larger portions for veggies and grains, smaller portions for fruits and proteins, and the cup is dairy, off to the side with the smallest portion] Five basic food groups, not four. We were wrong about that. We now realize, of course, that the largest of these groups we've been recommending is basically poison [a skull and crossbones appears over the grains]. Sir, to combat the gluten, we're trying every possible combination of the four remaining food groups, but so far, no answers.
AGENT
Sir, the feds are here.
TOM VILSACK
Oh shit!
FDA AGENT 1
Tom Vilsack?
TOM VILSACK
Yes?
MICHAEL TAYLOR
Michael Taylor, FDA.
TOM VILSACK
Yeah, thank you, but this is a USDA problem.
MICHAEL TAYLOR
Anything involving meat and dairy is our problem too!
[Papa John's, day. Stan approaches the blocked entrance]
STAN
Dad? Dad!
RANDY
[appears through a window] Stan! ...Hey! ...How's my boy? Daddy's gonna be all right. Okay?
STAN
Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?
RANDY
I can't touch you or hug you, but... but I'm right with you. Do you understand?
STAN
Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?
RANDY
How's your mom? Your, your sister?
SOLDIER 2
[appears next to him and begins tugging at him] This is a quarantined area, kid. You're you're gonna have to go.
STAN
Nonono, not yet. DAD!
RANDY
That's my son, you bastard!
SOLDIER 2
I'm sorry, all right?
STAN
Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!
RANDY
Staaan!
STAN
Let me talk to my dad! [the soldier finally hauls him away]
RANDY
Staaaaaaan!
[Cartman's room, night. He's asleep. A nightmare comes on, and visions of fellow students pass through his dream]
CRAIG
You call this a party?! Your party sucks!
TOLKIEN
Come on guys, let's go!
JIMMY
No food at a party? And I thought I was handicapped! [the voices mount and soon he's lifted out of bed as one last kid says "What a loser" which echoes and fades away. He finds himself in bayou territory]
AUNT JEMIMA
Hello, Eric. [he sees her, on a porch, with a plate of pancakes] Come on over here, sugar.
CARTMAN
Aunt Jemima. [stands up and walks over]
AUNT JEMIMA
There's people in trouble, Eric. They need to be shown the way.
CARTMAN
I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima.
AUNT JEMIMA
You need to get to the USDA, child. They're lookin' for a sign.
CARTMAN
I don't even know what that means.
AUNT JEMIMA
When you're stuck, look to the pyramids.
CARTMAN
Are you going to eat those pancakes?
AUNT JEMIMA
They've got it wrong, child! [suddenly the scenery changes to the pyramids at Giza. Her voice takes on a cosmic tone, and Cartman spins in place] The world is upside down.
CARTMAN
Oooo, trippy...
AUNT JEMIMA
Tell then they've got's it backwards!
CARTMAN
They've got what backward? [everything vanishes into a gray field, then a golden triangle appears, then shatters. A kaleidoscope of kids appears, taunting him. Aunt Jemima's face shatters, revealing the golden triangle.]
CARTMAN
[he falls through his dream, surrounded by everything that has gluten in it] Noooo... [and suddenly wakes up] Oh! Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck, I want pancakes.
[Papa John's, day. establishing shot. Inside Randy sits on a cot]
RANDY
You can't just keep us in here!
MR. GARRISON
[clanging] We're out. [holds up an empty tray] We're all out of toppings! There's nothing left to eat.
BLOND
[looks outside, then] They're just gonna let us starve to death?
RANDY
They don't care about us. Face it. We're already dead to them. [buries his face in his hands]
BLOND
Well then, I guess I might as well eat! [stands up and walks towards the storage room]
MR. GARRISON
There's nothing left, I told you.
BLOND
There's plenty of pizza dough.
RANDY
Are you crazy?
BLOND
I'm crazy hungry! [takes a wad of dough and begins eating it] Oh... Oh... Fuck, it's so good! [Randy and Mr. Garrison wait for the other shoe to drop] I want more... It's been so long! [gets more dough and eats voraciously]
RANDY
Oh my God, you... [the blond stops eating] But... you're okay.
BLOND
You don't think it's a little ridiculous that wheat protein is toxic? This whole thing was a setup, man!
MR. GARRISON
A setup? But by who?
RANDY
Oh my God, we... we have to get a hold of someone who could get the word out.
BLOND
Maybe Papa John can help us! If we can get a hold of them, then maybe we can- [his penis suddenly and quickly flies off and he dies]
RANDY
Ng-oh. [snaps his fingers. He and Garrison go find seats]
[WSPIC 88.3, on air. Stan is reading an announcement]
STAN
There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have.
DJ
Well all right, time for action indeed. Let's go to the phone lines. Go ahead, caller.
CRAIG
I knew you guys were going to bail on the party.
KYLE
We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now!
CRAIG
Uh huh, you guys couldn't get Lorde to play, could you?
DJ
All right, let's go to Jamie in Como. Go ahead.
JAMIE
It's like ya... ya say you're gonna throw the most epic party of the decade and then you rip it away! It's kind of like.... telling everyone to go fuck themselves!
DJ
Oh Kansas, watch the language there. Next caller, you're on the air.
WENDY
Why are you doing this party, Stan? Was it because you made people mad at school or... because you just wanted to be a big shot?
STAN
I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but-
WENDY
So then at a time when people really need to come together you cancel on 'em? I'm pretty sure Scott Malkinson still has diabetes.
SCOTT
That is correct, yes, I do.
WENDY
You couldn't put on the party you were hoping to put on, was that it?
KYLE
Jesus Christ, dude.
STAN
Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now...
WENDY
Right, and when things change or things come up, you don't forget about everything you promised people!
STAN
We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!
WENDY
Thought so. [hangs up. Stan lets his head fall on the table]
DJ
Ohhhhhh well all right, next caller is Eric. Are you there, Eric?
CARTMAN
KYYYLE!
KYLE
Cartman?
CARTMAN
KYYYLE, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMINA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE PYRAMID!
[USDA headquarters, day. Everyone is in a rush.]
TOM VILSACK
It's dinner time on the East coast in less than an hour. People are going to die!
JEFF WHITE
Sir! They've got a boy on the hot line who says he might know something.
TOM VILSACK
Who is this?
CARTMAN
My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid.
TOM VILSACK
The pyramid? That's ancient stuff you're talking about. Are you sure? [to the floor] Bring up the pyramid! [a programmer gets on it. An image comes up on screen, showing four food groups in four layers inside a pyramid. Grains take the bottom, widest layer, followed by fruits and vegetables, meat and dairy, and fats and oils narrowing to a point at the top]
CARTMAN
What, what is it? What is it for?
TOM VILSACK
We built the pyramid a long time ago to illustrate how much people should eat of the four basic food groups.
PROGRAMMER
Sir, we abandoned the pyramid when Michelle Obama got involved.
TOM VILSACK
The pyramid down't work. We already tried it.
CARTMAN
It's upside down.
TOM VILSACK
What?
CARTMAN
Sir, the pyramid is upside down.
TOM VILSACK
Turn the pyramid upside down.
PROGRAMMER 2
You can't be serious. That would put butter and fat at the top of the-
TOM VILSACK
Flip the damned food pyramid!
MICHAEL TAYLOR
This is NOT FDA-approved!
TOM VILSACK
It's dinnertime on the east coast in ten minutes! Now DO IT! [the programmers get on it]
PROGRAMMER 3
Sir, we've got a match.
PROGRAMMER 4
Nutrition is stabilizing!
PROGRAMMER 5
We've got a well-balanced vaccine, sir! [everyone cheers]
TOM VILSACK
Get the President on the phone. Tell him... to have some steak with his butter.
[The awesome party, day. The boys came through, everyone in town is there. Mr. Garrison serves steaks with large bars of butter to Mr. Mackey and Principal Victoria. "We love you Scott." Photo booth, soda station]
CRAIG
[with butter on a stick] Well, I gotta admit, you guys throw a pretty sweet party.
KYLE
Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man.
SCOTT
[approaches with a plate of butter on a stick] Would you guys care for a frozen butter pop?
KYLE
We're good, Scott. Stop bugging us. [Scott walks away]
TOM VILSACK
We really dodged a bullet, young man. Thanks to you, America knows what to eat again.
CARTMAN
Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like.
TOM VILSACK
We're gonna get a better view of the stage.
CARTMAN
Yeah yeah, enjoy the party. [takes a couple of steps and notices the ghost of Aunt Jemima over a fence. He waves at her. She waves back.]
JEFF WHITE
Wait till my girls see that I was at a party with Lorde!
CLYDE
I'm glad the food is good. Lorde sucks.
JIMMY
Yeah, she isn't as hot in person.
RANDY
[dressed up as Lorde]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I am Lorde, yeah yeah yeah. Lorde, Lorde. Call me Lorde yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.
STAN
Hey Wendy, you havin' fun?
WENDY
Yeah, sure. You guys really pulled it off.
STAN
Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me.
WENDY
You're so transparent, Stan.
STAN
What does that mean?
WENDY
You wanna dance? [he looks back at her, smiles, and goes to dance with her.]
RANDY
We love the city, yeah yeah yeah, 'cause I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde Lorde yeah yeah yeah.
End of Gluten Free Ebola


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Randy is harboring a giant secret and the pressure is getting to him. Meanwhile, Cartman calls Stan a sissy.

script:The Cissy

[The bus stop, morning. The boys wait for the bus, but Cartman seems particularly steamed today. His right hand is in his jacket pocket, and angry music plays]
CARTMAN
[thinking] Another morning. Waiting for the run-down school bus to take me to the run-down school. But today is the day I finally have the guts to do what I should've done a long time ago. [looks down at Stan's feet, than at Kyle's] Nobody notices what I have in my front pocket. A little surprise for them all. [Stan notices and looks. Cartman notices Stan and shoves his hand further into his pocket. Stan looks at Cartman and steps away from him.] I'm prepared for this, but still I wonder.. Will I have the guts to go through with it? Damn right I will! [Kyle notices Cartman's anger]
KYLE
Are you okay, Cartman?
CARTMAN
[brightens up] Yeah, I'm good. How are you, Kyle? [settles into angry funk again and thinks] They're all gonna pay! Every day they pushed me and pushed, and if it happens again today, it's going to be the last time. [Kyle and Kenny look at each other, then they look at Cartman] We'll find out today at recess, won't we? Oh yes, we'll find out today at recess.
[South Park Elementary, a couple hours later. Cartman heads for the boys room and enters. He has some magazines with him]
BUTTERS
[at the urinal, pants down] Hey Eric! I'm not suspended no more.
CARTMAN
Good for you. [tries to get into the first stall, but finds it locked]
BUTTERS
[looks over] I think someone's in there.
CARTMAN
No, God damn it, no! [pounds on the door] Who's takin' a shit?!
CRAIG
[from inside] Occupied.
CARTMAN
I called dibs on Stall 1 for all recess, Craig!
CRAIG
You can't call dibs on a toilet.
CARTMAN
Son of a bitch! [moves on to Stall 2, tries to open it, and finds it locked too.] Oh, no! NO NO NO! I cannot go another lunch break without my toilet time!
KYLE
[from inside] Then don't eat 14 Eggo waffles for lunch, fatass!
CARTMAN
ALL RIGHT, THAT DOES IT! [turns around and walks toward the door]I'M SICK OF THIS SHIT AND I'M NOT [throws his magazines to the floor] GONNA BE TAKING IT ANY LONGER! [reaches into his jacket pocket] You all pushed me to this! [pulls out a pink bow and plops it on to his hat, then continues out the door. Butters just looks on. Cartman leaves the boys' room and enters the girls' room. Wendy and Bebe are at the mirror. Cartman looks around for a moment. Wendy is quick to notice, and then faces him. Cartman heads for a stall and Wendy blocks him]
WENDY
What the hell do you think you're doing?
CARTMAN
I'm going to the potty.
WENDY
This is the girls' bathroom!
CARTMAN
Alright, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I'm transginger.
WENDY
What?!
CARTMAN
Did you notice the bow? [points to it] I'm not comfortable with the sex I was assigned at birth, so I'm exercising my right to identify with the gender of my choice. Now get out of my way, I have to take a shit. [barges into Stall 1, locks it, drops his pants, and sits down. Wendy shrugs with her palms up. The first poop falls and Wendy and Bebe recoil] Aaahhh!
WENDY
Get out of here!
CARTMAN
Don't give me any more issues than I already have, Wendy! [drops another deuce] Oh wow, this is nice in here. The girls' bathroom is a lot cleaner than the boys'. [groans to get another deuce out, followed by a fart. Red comes out of Stall 2]
RED
What the hell is that?!
WENDY
Cartman is using our bathroom!
CARTMAN
Dude, this is awesome. I should've used the girls' bathroom a long time ago.
RED
[pointing an accusing finger] Hey! I'm gonna tell on you!
CARTMAN
It's okay, Red. I can take a shit here. I'm a dumb chick too. [farts and poops some more]
[Principal's office, moments later]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I want to know just what makes you think it's okay to go inside the girls bathroom!
CARTMAN
Because I'm transginger. I looked it up: that means I can use the girl's shitter.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
You are not transgender, Eric! You don't even know what that means!
CARTMAN
Yeah uh-huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy, but I'm really a girl.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
All right, well, if you identify yourself as a girl, you must find yourself attracted to boys. Is that right?!
CARTMAN
That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Alright, listen, Eric!
CARTMAN
Erica.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Listen, Eric! You must know why we can't have you in the girls bathroom!
CARTMAN
All I know is I'm transginger, and you can't make me go to the bathroom with the cisgingers.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
With the what?!
[Faculty room, later. Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey sit at the table as Mr. Garrison looks outside]
MR. GARRISON
Cisgender. It's the politically correct name for people who aren't transgender. If you identify with the sex you were born with, then you're cis.
MR. MACKEY
But then cisgender-ed is just normal
MR. GARRISON
[faces Mackey and Victoria] Saying "normal" is extremely offensive to people who aren't in that group. [gets emphatic] Trust me, you don't want this hot potato! Just let him use the girl's room!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
But this isn't a hurt and confused child we're talking about. This is Eric Cartman.
MR. GARRISON
Nobody else is gonna know that. You better just give him what he wants.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Sooo Eric Cartman just has us in some kind of bathroom checkmate?
MR. GARRISON
Actually, [turns around and looks outside again] it's more like a royal flush.
[The Broflovski house, day. A reporter stops by and rings the doorbell. Gerald opens the door]
REPORTER
Gerald Broflovski?
GERALD
Yes?
BRANDON CARLILE
Brandon Carlile, reporter, Spin Magazine. I was hoping you could help me... make sense of somethin'. I understand you had a very large party in your back yard last... last Sunday, was it?
GERALD
That's right. [Sheila appears in the background] My son and his friends throw a party for a kid with diabetes.
BRANDON CARLILE
I also understand that a very famous pop artist, Lorde, was the entertainment at that party.
GERALD
Oh yeah, yeah, the kids were pretty excited.
BRANDON CARLILE
Well it, eh, it's just a little curious, you know? Why a hugely popular Top-20 artist would play such a... well no offence, but such a humble venue?
GERALD
...Sorry, I don't think I get your-
BRANDON CARLILE
You understand, we deal with a lot of fake stories at Spin. [glances at his pen] Was just wondering how the boys got someone like Lorde to play.
GERALD
From what I understand, she's the niece of someone's coworker here in town or something.
BRANDON CARLILE
You wouldn't know who?
GERALD
No. Does it really matter?
BRANDON CARLILE
[slow zoom] Lorde is an incredibly talented and down-to-earth young lady. It would be a shame if someone was... having fun at her expense.
[The Marsh laundry room. Sharon is sorting clothes. She sees that Steamy Ray Vaughn is still around, from the brown streaks in Randy's briefs. She pulls out the briefs from two pairs of Randy's pants, but is intrigued when she looks into the third pair. She pulls out... some fishnet stockings and her eyes open wide.]
[The living room, moments later. Randy's on the couch sipping on Pabst Blue Ribbon.]
SHARON
[walks up with the stockings] Randy? Whose are these?
RANDY
[sits up] Aaah, I don't know. Why?
SHARON
Why? Because there's fishnet stockings inside your jeans?
RANDY
In my jeans?
SHARON
Randy? Do you have something to tell me?
RANDY
[gives in] ...Yeah. I do.
[Girls room, recess, next day. Wendy, Bebe, Red, and a new girl stand with their jackets over their noses, the smell is so bad. Cartman is in there again. The girl looks like the singer Sia, so we'll go with that.]
RED
[bangs on the wall on one side of stall 1] Come on! You've been in there for twenty minutes!
SIA
Yeah! Recess is almost over!
CARTMAN
There's two more stall in here, gals. Go ahead.
SIA
Not while you're in here!
CARTMAN
Oh my God, you guys are so cisginger. Sorry I'm different, but you can just suck my clit AND my balls.
WENDY
Eric, there are people actually struggling with their gender identity and all you're doing is-
CARTMAN
Okay, okay, okay, you guys! You know what? You know what? [drops a deuce] That's what. [laughs his ass off. Principal Victoria walks in behind the girls] Suck my clit and balls.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Erica, I believe we have a solution to this little problem.
CARTMAN
I don't have a problem, Principal Victoria, the cisgenders have the problem. [poops and farts]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
If it is agreeable to you, Erica, we are going to clear out the janitor's closet and remodel it into a private bathroom just for you! [Cartman farts one last time, cleans up, and leaves the stall]
CARTMAN
Excuse me, are you talking about... my own special executive bathroom?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Would that be agreeable to you?
CARTMAN
OH MY GOD!!!
WENDY
That isn't fair!
RED
Wendy, just go with it!
CARTMAN
Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. I might have to approve certain aspects of this... solitary location.
[The janitor's closet. Cartman plans out his new restroom with an interior designer]
CARTMAN
Yeah sooo I'm thinking of water feature here, you know. get the sound of running water, yeah kind of Zen it out.
DESIGNER
Uh huh, well why don't you put the water feature on this side?
CARTMAN
Oh on that side?
DESIGNER
You know, because you've already got AC over here and that leaves this open for some nice big piece of art on this wall.
CARTMAN
Oh, I like that. That's gonna look nice, yeah.
[The Marsh house, night. Randy enters his garage, pulls out his phone, and taps in a number. Someone picks up]
RANDY
Yeah, listen. I don't know if I can keep doing this. My wife is starting to suspect something. I just had to tell her I like the way fishnets feel.
RECORD PRODUCER
[in his chair at his desk, facing away from the camera] I know your wife means a lot to you, Randy, [turns around in his chair] but you can't leave us hanging. You've got the purest shit out there; it's worth a lot to us.
RANDY
You think you're gonna get a good product when I can't even think?!
RECORD PRODUCER
How many times have you said "I think I've lost it" and everything turned out to be okay?
RANDY
Every time?
RECORD PRODUCER
Every time. Come on. Get back to work and see. If you get panicked again, call me.
RANDY
Yeah. Yeah I will. Yup. [hangs up. He walks up to a poster and moves it to one side, revealing a hole in the wall with stacks of bills inside. He pulls out some more bills from his back pocket and adds them to the stacks]
[The Record Producer's office. A young man walks in. The producer looks out the window]
RON
You wanted to see me?
RECORD PRODUCER
Sit down, Ron. [Ron sits] Whattaya know about one of our artists, Lorde?
RON
[shrugs] Seventeen-year-old girl from New Zealand, great songwriter, [shrugs] humble.
RECORD PRODUCER
Wrong. [turns to face him] She's a 45-year-old man in Colorado.
RON
What?
RECORD PRODUCER
He writes the songs, sends us the demos, we fudge them, sell them as a brooding 17-year-old girl way ahead of her time, and nobody knows the difference.
RON
Huh. [the realization sinks in] Holy shit.
RECORD PRODUCER
He makes good stuff. Stuff that sells. But he's getting edgy feet. I want you to keep an eye on him. And if anyone around him seems like they're close to finding out the truth, well... you know what to do.
[The Marsh house, master bedroom. Randy's at the foot of the bed with guitar in hand and some lyrics on the bed]
RANDY
Lorde Lorde Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde I am Lorde. I am L- I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde.
SHARON
[appears at the bedroom door] Randy?
RANDY
[drops the guitar and gathers up his sheets] I, I, thought you were at the grocery store. [chuckles]
SHARON
I was. Can you help me unload the car? [turns left and walks away]
RANDY
Help me unload the c-car. Help me unload, load the car. Yah yah yah. Unloadin'. Unload yah yah yah.
SHARON
[comes back and peeks inside] Randy?
RANDY
[loses his sheets] Sorry. Sorry, yeah. Coming. [follows her to the car]
[South Park Elementary, day. A new restroom, Other, replaces the janitor's closet. A workman drills in the final screws for the OTHER sign. Butters and Craig observe him, Craig and Tolkien walk up. The workman finishes up as Stan arrives]
STAN
What is that?
BUTTERS
That's Cartman's new transgender bathroom.
STAN
Cartman's a girl now?
BUTTERS
He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me. [turns around and walks away.]
CARTMAN
[rushes up] It it done?! It is all ready?! Alright alright, move aside everybody, move aside please. I gotta go. [opens the door, looks inside and grins. Inside is one of the fanciest restrooms one will ever see. Icicle lights all around, waterfall to the left, fancy commode to the right, plush towels and toilet seat cover. Triumphant music plays] Oh! Ahm. This is gonna be so awesome. [closes and locks the door] Aha! Lock! Privacy. Oh, this is gonna feel so good! [claps twice - he's got the Clapper feature in there. The lights dim and Vivaldi's Spring begins to play] Perfect. [reaches over for a cat-o-five-tails and begins whipping the toilet with it] Yeah, you're gonna take it. You're all alone now, toilet. Nobody can hear you scream. Yeah, you're gonna open wide. [the kids nearby just stand there shocked] You're gonna TAKE your punishment! That's right! Get ready! [remembers there are people outside] Oh my God, this is so awesome, you guys! It's just like at home!
[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails, night. Nelson is at the bar. Brandon Carlile appears nearby]
BRANDON CARLILE
Peter Nelson?
NELSON
Yes?
BRANDON CARLILE
[pulls up a stool next to him] Brandon Carlile, reporter, Spin Magazine. I understand you work at the U.S. Geological Survey?
NELSON
Yeah, that's right.
BRANDON CARLILE
I also understand that you're the uncle of the amazing and talented songwriter, Lorde?
NELSON
[sighs] Alright, look, I am not her uncle. I I just work with her, okay?
BRANDON CARLILE
Work with her? How? [they move to a booth for some privacy]
NELSON
I like Lorde. Uh she's really nice and really talented. But she lives a double life.
BRANDON CARLILE
How's that?
NELSON
Lorde isn't just a singer, she's also a very talented scientist who specializes in fluvial geomorphology.
BRANDON CARLILE
The what?
NELSON
She just showed up one day at the office and started filling in for a guy who started working part time. She's a good geologist. When her music career took off we thought she'd be gone, but she still shows up. Usually right after lunch. [Brandon tries to figure out what to write, but draws a blank]
[South Park Elementary. Cartman walks down the hallway singing to himself]
CLYDE
Hey Cartman. Heard you're transgender.
CARTMAN
Yup! You know what Hillary says: "You can suck my clit and balls." [goes into his bathroom]
RED
[talking to Bebe nearby] Well I know I'm not even gonna get it done. I swear, he gives us too much homework anyway. I-
WENDY
Hey guys. [all look and stare. Wendy walks down the hallway dressed as her male persona, Wendyl, in t-shirt and vest, purple pants, hair pinned back.]
RED
...Wendy?
WENDY
How's it hanging'?
CRAIG
Whoa..
JENNY
Huh?
JASON
Whoa, wait, is that?
BUTTERS
Holy moly! [Wendy pulls out a key and goes into the Other bathroom]
CARTMAN
Hey, what the fuck, dude?! Do you mind? This is occupied!
WENDY
It's cool. I'll wait.
CARTMAN
DUDE, THIS IS MY FUCKING BATHROOM!
[Principal Victoria's office, moments later. Wendy and Cartman are present]
CARTMAN
I want her suspended, and I want charges brought up for sexual harassment!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I'm sorry Erica, but I spoke with Wendyl this morning and she's not comfortable-
CARTMAN
Wendyl?! Fucking Wendyl?! Grow up, Wendy!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
You'll just have to share, Eric. Why can't you understand that?
CARTMAN
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT A CHICK WATCHING ME GO POO!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I thought you were a chick.
CARTMAN
NO! I IDENTIFY AS A CHICK, BUT I'M STILL A BOY. YOU CAN'T MAKE ME SHARE A BATHROOM WITH A GIRL THAT IDENTIFIES HERSELF AS A FUCKING DUDE! [thinks for a few seconds] That is MY waterfall, and those are MY Christmas lights!
[South Park Elementary, later. Stan is at his locker]
CARTMAN
[runs up to Stan] Dude! You need to put a tighter leash on your dog!
STAN
[surprised] What?
CARTMAN
Do you know your girlfriend's going around tellin' everyone that you're gay?! [Stan looks around] Oh yeah! She's got the whole school believin' that she's attracted to girls, but she's dating you! So what does that make you, Stan?! A girl! STAN-AN'S A GIR-RL! You'd better curb your dog, Stan! You'd better curb your dog before people start ripping on you! [walks away]
[Shelly's room, evening. Randy knocks at her door]
RANDY
Shelly, that's enough time on your phone.
SHELLY
Leave me alone, Dad! Stop nagging me all the time!
RANDY
You know we're all cutting down on phone time.
SHELLY
[sits up] Don't limit me! You don't even understand me!
RANDY
[sees a poster of himself as Lorde] Yeah. I don't understand you at all. A lot you know. [walks away saddened]
[The Marsh garage, moments later. Randy is adding more stacks to the stacks of bills he's hidden behind the poster. A door opens and Randy quickly seals up the hole. He gets to his workbench just as Stan closes the door.]
STAN
Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.
RANDY
Oh really? A-About... about what?
STAN
Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside? [Randy sighs deeply and stands up to walk] I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex?
RANDY
Yes. Yes, Stan. I am Lorde.
STAN
...What?
RANDY
It started off so simple. There's a guy at work. Hanson. He would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up, you know? Not only that, but he was in there all the time! I finally got fed up and pretended to be a woman. I called myself Lorde. Have you ever been in a woman's bathroom, Stan? It's all clean and there's enough stalls for everyone. It was so freeing. I started singing while I was in there, and then I- started writing things down.
STAN
Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle.
RANDY
Yah, that's my cover.
STAN
The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you?
RANDY
Yeah. [turns around and faces Stan] The record company messed it all up. It was supposed to go "Hunger Games, yah yah yah, yah yah yah! Hunger Games." But they just- do what they want with my songs.
STAN
Wha-wait, Lorde sounds like a girl.
RANDY
Autotune. Wanna see how I do it? [moments later, a music program pops up. Twelve tracks are shown at lower left] I come up with all my best stuff in the bathroom at work. I use this program to import the recordings I make on my phone. [plays the highlighted track]
"Yeah yeah, feeling good on a Wednesday. Sparklinnnnn' thoughts. Givin' me the hope to go ohhhn" [farts and poop noises] "Oh! Whoa. What I need now is a little bit of shelter."
STAN
Dad, Lorde's music is actually really good.
RANDY
Thanks. But it gets even better when I add the drum loops. [replays the same track with drum loops added] Then with the computer I can actually quantize everything. [brings up the quantizer and chooses his settings] Backup instruments. [scale, beats, bass, tambourine, guitars, strings] And then finally I use the Autotune. ["Auto-Tuner v10." He chooses his settings there, and the song is transformed. The same track is now enhanced with Sia's voice and no trace of Randy]
"Sparklin' thoughts, feelin' good on a Wednesday. Givin' me the hope, givin' givin' me the hope to go ohhhn. What I need is a little bit of shelter."
[this is all too much for Stan to take in, and he passes out. Randy notices] Stan?
[South Park Elementary, next day. Stan is in the hallway looking at the restrooms, weighing his options]
BUTTERS
[walks past Stan, then stops] Hey! Everything okay, Stan?
STAN
...I don't know where I belong...
BUTTERS
Just hold it. That's what I do now. [continues on his way. Stan walks towards the girls room, but veers left to look at the boys room. Then he spins round and walks to the Other room, whips out his key for it, and goes in.]
CARTMAN
HEY, WHAT THE FUCK, DUDE?! GOD FUCKING DAMN IT!
[Principal Victoria's office, moments later. Stan and Cartman are present]
CARTMAN
Why don't we just have everyone use the transgender bathroom?!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Stanley, do you have a reason for not using the boys bathroom?
STAN
I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused.
CARTMAN
He's cisginger! He's so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night!
[U.S. Geological Survey, Colorado, day. Quite the busy office space. At the boss's office, someone knocks and opens his door]
RANDY
[in his Lorde attire.] You wanted to see me, boss?
BOSS
Yes. Please have a seat, Lorde.
RANDY
[closes the door and sits next to a woman] Hi Carol.
CAROL
[avoiding eye contact] Lorde.
BOSS
Lorde, we're all big fans of your music and we think the world of you for staying and working here even after your music career took off.
RANDY
Well, my music and fluvial geomorphology are intertwined.
BOSS
Amazing, yeah. Uh... Lorde... for some time now the females at this office have been pressuring me to... uh... find your own space... to go to the bathroom. [a few seconds of silence] Everyone loves you, but we thought it would be great if you had your very own executive bathroom. [whips out an executive key]
RANDY
I like the women's bathroom. I feel safe there. Being able to use that bathroom is critical to my identity, to my music.
CAROL
My girls are big fans of your music, Lorde, but the women here aren't comfortable sharing a bathroom with [stops herself immediately]
RANDY
With what? [moments of awkward glances follow] With what? [getting no answer, he gets up and leaves.]
[E! breaking news]
ANNOUNCER
You are watching E! Entertainment News! That's how low you've sunk.
ANCHOR
It's been several days and still there's no sign of the pop singer Lorde. The singer went dark on Twitter claiming severe depression, and stating [the statement goes up on screen] "I realize now that I make people uncomfortable. I need to give this up and go back to just being the old me." Spin Magazine is claiming they know the reason for the sudden exit, and will be releasing a tell-all article about the troubled artist next week.
[South Park Elementary, day. Stan walks down the crowded hall when he's stopped by Cartman]
CARTMAN
Oh, here he comes, everyone! It's the cisginger! Think you can harass transgingers and use their bathroom?!
BUTTERS
Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?!
CARTMAN
At this school, it doesn't matter if you're trans or you're cis, right guys?! [the other kids agree, but not strongly] What we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant! You know what we call those? Cissies!
BUTTERS
Yeah! Stan's a big old fat cissy!
CLYDE
[steps forward] Awe, come on, lay off him guys.
CARTMAN
Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?!
CLYDE
No, no, just he is. [retreats and walks away]
[The Marsh house, day, backyard. Randy sits at a picnic table alone with his thoughts and a beer. Sharon walks out]
SHARON
You just gonna drink beer alone all day?
RANDY
[Raises up his Pabst to show Sharon] It's okay, it's gluten free.
SHARON
All right. [turns around and goes back towards the house, but stops and looks back] Do you know why young people like Lorde so much. [Randy sits up and looks over his shoulder] It's because she's something different. Kids have had pop music artists flash tits and crotch in their face, and most kids are actually smart enough to be sick of it. Lorde represents something in all of us, the truth that wants to be heard. If I could talk to Lorde right now, you know what I'd tell her? I'd tell her not to let people change who she is. I'd tell her that if people are making fun of her, it's probably because they lost touch with being human. I'd tell her to keep on doing what she does, because when someone's not allowed to express who they are inside, then we all lose. That's... what I would say to Lorde. [goes back inside the house and closes the sliding door]
"LORDE"
[Randy's finished song, "Feelin' Good On A Wednesday / Push"]
Feelin' good on a Wednesday

The image of me that you see
Is distorted, twisted, broken, fractured
Isolated, miles out to sea
I don't want a separate place.
I need to feel safe, not thrown away, away, away.

And I will push (push)
To tear down the walls (push, push)
Of this box you put me in (push, push)
Because you don't understand
(push ow hot, push ow ow hot) You push
To find a label that fits me.
I'm feelin' good on a Wednesday
With sparklin' thoughts
Help me unload the car, yah yah yah

And so I push
To close the door
Of the stall you've made for me,
To keep me away.
And now we push
Push to stand together
Because I am Lorde (yah yah yah)
Yah yah yah, I am Lorde
I am Lorde, yah yah yah
Yah yah yah, I am Lorde
Yah yah yah
Yah yah yah, I am Lorde

Yah yah yah

[While the song plays, the following montage flows: camera closes in on Randy's face, then on a toilet. Some of the lyrics, handwritten on yellow rule paper, scroll past. Stan looks at the restrooms again. More lyrics. The demos are playing for the record producer and Ron, and they like it. More lyrics. Two sisters listen to the song on an iPhone in the kitchen. Their mother Carol looks on from the doorway. She returns to the office the next day and stops the boss from putting up the transgender sign on a bathroom. They both listen to the song, and like it. Shelly is wearing her headphones joyfully dancing to the song. Randy looks in and smiles. Principal Victoria waves a pencil around as if she were conducting an arrangement for this song. Bebe is listening to it with Milly and Nelly in her bedroom. Butters is in his own room wearing a pink tutu and dancing away. More lyrics. Brandon Carlile is at his desk looking at his article. He moves to delete it, and it's gone. He shuts down his computer and leaves]
[South Park Elementary Gymnasium that still has damage from the Butter's fire. Principal Victoria is going to announce something. Mr. Garrison and Mr. Mackey sit off to one side]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
And so it is with great pride that I can announce the student body has elected to get rid of the transgender bathroom, and give any fellow student the right to use the bathroom they feel most comfortable in. [cheering erupts from the students]
CARTMAN
I don't wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it! It's gonna be all crowded. [pulls off his bow and throws it to the ground.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Anyone who has a problem sharing a bathroom with people who might be transgender will have to use the special designated bathroom designed to keep them away from the normal people who don't care.
[South Park Elementary, hallway. Stan heads for the boys room when Butters exits]
BUTTERS
Hey! Where do you think you're going?!
STAN
To the bathroom?
BUTTERS
Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom! [points to the Cissies bathroom, which used to be the Other bathroom] Well go on, cissy! [Stan walks over to the cissies bathroom and goes in. Butters smiles and walks away. The cissies bathroom is just the Other bathroom with a new plaque on it. Stan claps twice and the lights go down. Vivaldi's "Spring" plays]
STAN
Wow, this is is pretty nice. [drops trousers and settles in, then begins singing]
Feelin' good on a Monday.
Got my space, all the freedom I need.
Yah yah yah
By myself, yah yah yah
End of The Cissy

synopsis:Timmy's successful new car service makes him a lot of enemies.

script:Handicar

[The Bijou, night. A movie has ended, probably "Gone Girl," and moviegoers are now going home. Among them are Gerald and Sheila Broflovski, Stephen and Linda Stotch, and Bob and Linda Black.]
STEPHEN
[with phone in hand] Well that was a lot of fun. Thanks for inviting us, guys.
SHEILA
Sure. You bet.
GERALD
Are you guys parked over here?
STEPHEN
Oh nonono, we took a Handicar. It was easier that way.
GERALD
A Handicar? What's that?
LINDA
You don't use Handicar?
STEPHEN
No, see, you just get the Handicar app. It uses GPS to locate where you are, and the Handicar comes and picks you up.
GERALD
Wow...
STEPHEN
Yeah, and it's cheaper than a taxi. I'm telling you, it's the future of transportation. Oh, here it comes. [sees Linda talking to the Blacks] Honey, our Handicar is here.
TIMMY
Timmy! [Linda waves goodbye to the Blacks and she joins Stephen in the Handicar, driven by Timmy.]
STEPHEN
Have fun drivin' home. I'll be relaxing on my iPad. [The Handicar is a wheelchair with a Lil Zipper attached. The Lil Zipper is equipped with a table setting for two, including a candle and flower in vase.]
GERALD
Lucky.
TIMMY
Timmy. [pulls away]
STEPHEN
Download the app! It works great! [Gerald whips out his phone and goes looking for the app. He finds it and downloads it.]
[South Park, day. A cab goes down the street. A Russian driver is shown with his passenger]
PASSENGER
Ahh, [pinches his nose] Excuse me, I think someone puked back here. [pinches his nose again]
RUSSIAN
You don't like puke?
PASSENGER
Could you turn the radio down and the air conditioning up, please?
RUSSIAN
No air conditioning. Too expensive. [the light turns red and the driver brakes hard, causing the passenger to hit his head on the back of the front seat.]
PASSENGER
Agh!
RUSSIAN
Not enough people taking cab. Don't know what's wrong!
TIMMY
Timmih! [both driver and passenger look to the right. Timmy drives by in his wheelchair towing a man in his Lil Zipper, which is equipped with a table, tablecloth, candle, and two chairs. The man is sipping wine.]
RUSSIAN
What the fuck?
[The Hummer car dealership, day. Mr. Stevenson is on the sidewalk trying to drum up some business.]
MR. STEVENSON
We've got a big sales event going on, folks. [sees two men across the street] Hey guys. Can I get you in a 2014 Hummer? Rocktober sales event, guys.
YOUNGER MAN
No thanks.
MR. STEVENSON
[plays some air guitar] Only a few more guitar licks left in Rocktober, guys.
OLDER MAN
We're good. Shut up! [Timmy pulls up]
YOUNGER MAN
Oh, here's our Handicar.
TIMMY
Timmy. [he stops, and the men get in.]
MR. STEVENSON
The fuck?
[A meeting room, day. Three counselors stand before a group of handicapped kids. Among them are Jimmy, Francis, and Timmy. Counselor Steve begins to speak]
STEVE
All right, kids, you know what time of year this is? [the handicapped kids cheer] That's right, it's autumn! And that means our fundraising for next year's summer camp is in full gear. Is everyone psyched for next year's summer camp?
ALL
Yeeaahhh!
STEVE
So far, Jimmy has raised $16!
ALL
Yeeaahhh!
STEVE
Francis has raised $29.32 [the kids cheer] And Timmy has raised $2,063.00!
TIMMY
Timmy! [the other kids cheer]
STEVE
All righty, if you guys keep this up, we'll raise the money for summer camp in no time! [the kids cheer. Off to the side, in the open doorway, are Nathan and Mimsy.]
NATHAN
[turns around. Mimsy does too.] I won't do it, Mimsy. I won't spend another summer at that stupid camp.
MIMSY
D'awww, we don't like camp, boss?
NATHAN
We hate camp, Mimsy. The singing, the competitions, Jimmy Valmer getting all the chicks.
MIMSY
D'oh yeah and don't forget last year at summer camp, you got raped by a shark. [laughs. Nathan jumps in the air and smacks Mimsy on the right cheek with his left hand]
NATHAN
Shut up, Mimsyyyy! I'm not gonna spend my summer trapped at that camp with these punch-happy assholes. We gotta find a way to put Handicar out of business, and fast.
MIMSY
D'ah oh boy! We're gonna wreck Timmy's business, huh boss?
NATHAN
Shh-shh. [the counselor reaches them]
STEVE
Hey boys, are you excited for camp next year?
NATHAN
Yes, Counselor Steve. We like the tug-of-waaarr.
STEVE
All right. Well, just keep working on those donations. [leaves]
NATHAN
Come on, Mimsy, we gotta figure out how we're gonna make Handicar a thing of the past.
MIMSY
D'oh boy!
[Park County Community Center, night. The parking lot is full of cabs. Inside are three SP Taxi drivers, an SP Cabbie, and Mr. Stevenson]
SP CABBIE
[wears an SP Cab hat] We are united as brothers, because jast as Handicar has taken away jobs from honest, hard-working cab drivers, it's also taken food [slams his fist on the podium] from the mouths of the children of car salesmen!
MR. STEVENSON
Well I don't have any children.
RUSSIAN
Who does this handicapped boy think he is?! He's not even in union!
ARAB
He's taking all our business because people find it more coomvenient.
SP CABBIE
Aaand, because he's handicapped, he can use special access points and parking spaces. That kid was born with an unfair advantage!
ARAB
Who is this rat?!
NATHAN
His name is Timmy Burch. [the adults turn to look at him] And if you don't do something quick, you're all gonna be out of work for good.
AMERICAN
Who are you?!
NATHAN
Just someone who doesn't like to see hard workers like yourselves lose their jobs. That's all.
RUSSIAN
Nobody takes jobs away from US! We need to speak to Mayor and tell her to shut down this illegitimate business!
ARAB
Or maybe we can have the police shut him down!
MIMSY
Hey I got an idea! Why don't you guys just make your cars cleaner and nicer, and try to be better to your customers so that you can compete with Handicar's popularity in the marketplace?
NATHAN
Just ignore my friend. He's mentally disabled.
MIMSY
Aw yeah, don't mind me.
NATHAN
Now listen, everybody. If you're a sheepherder, and there's a snake taking away your sheep, what do you do to the snake?
MR. STEVENSON
Offer it last year's Christmas in Rocksummer prizes?
NATHAN
No, you fucking moron! You kill... the snake! [the drivers look at each other]
[Timmy's room, night. He's fast asleep when several shadows pop up outside his window. It turns out to be the SP cabbie, followed by the Russian and Arab cabbies.]
SP CABBIE
Hey wake up, you little scab!
TIMMY
[waking up] Tutih Tuh-Timmih?
SP CABBIE
We got a message for ya! From the union. [holds up a bat. The three cab drivers begin beating Timmy with baseball bats]
[South Park, next day, daytime. Nathan and Mimsy walk along a sidewalk]
NATHAN
Just imagine it, Mimsy. A whole summer to ourselves to do what we want. It's going to be awesome. [The curb has a line of cabs on it, and they come across the cabbies who visited Timmy the night before.] Well well, hello gentlemen. I understand you've taken care of our little problem?
SP CABBIE
Yeah, we sure did!
RUSSIAN
Let's just say he'll be laid up a while.
SP CABBIE
Yeah. We snuck in his room last night and we... broke his legs!
NATHAN
Oh boy, that's great-wait, you what??
TIMMY
Timmy! [drives by, seemingly unharmed]
RANDY
[taking a ride in the Handicar] I am Lorde. Lawdy Lawdy Lorde.
RUSSIAN
But we broke his legs. Both of them.
NATHAN
Let me give you guys a hot news flash: If you want to hurt a crippled kid, you don't break his FUCKING LEGS!
[The park, sometime later. Nathan and Mimsy sit on a bench]
NATHAN
How can people be so ineffectual, Mimsy?
MIMSY
D'uh I don't know, boss.
NATHAN
These are supposed to be men who care about their occupations.
MIMSY
D'uh maybe if they're that incompetent we shouldn't be tryin' to save their jobs. Maybe Handicar is a kind of economic natural selection, where the more diligent workers are weeding out the useless ones. Drrrrr.
NATHAN
[smacks him again] Shut up, Mimsyyyy!
[In another part of town, Timmy is driving a woman home]
WOMAN 1
Right here is good. [gets off at her house] Thank you. I can just use the app to tip you, right?
TIMMY
Timmy!
WOMAN 1
Ohohh, this is so handy! [goes to the front door] Thank you!
TIMMY
Timmy. [gets a new call from an unknown caller and answers it] Tiiimmih Timmih.
NATHAN
Hey Timmy, it's your friend from camp, Nathan.
TIMMY
Timmih!
NATHAN
Listen, you can't possibly handle all this business you're getting. Admit it. You've got more customers than you can handle.
TIMMY
[sighs] Timmih.
NATHAN
I've got an amazing idea. Why don't you let other people drive Handicars too? Think of all the money you could raise for camp if you expand your business.
TIMMY
[thinking it over] Hmmm, Timmih.
NATHAN
I'm sure you could find a lot of interested drivers.
TIMMY
[smiles] Timmy! [grins. He likes the idea]
NATHAN
That's great. Summer camp, here we come. [hangs up] Now kiss your business goodbye, asshole!
[A neighborhood, sometime later. Nathan is now in a wheelchair as a new Handicar driver]
MIMSY
D'ah I don't get it boss. I thought you hated Handicar. How come now you wanna work for 'em?
NATHAN
It's very simple, Mimsy. I'm gonna take down Handicar by being an employee who sexually harasses the passengers.
MIMSY
D'ahhh, sexual harassment, boss?
NATHAN
It's simple. If you're a sheepherder and a snake is killing your sheep, you just need to have the snake get sued for sexual misconduct. Now, you find me a female passenger on that app and leave the rest to me.
MIMSY
D'ah oh boy!
[Later, Nathan goes on his first drive as a Handicar driver. His phone indicates that he has a passenger waiting for a pick up close by]
NATHAN
[arrives] Timmy. Hello ma'am. Handicar at your service. Climb on in. [she gets in without saying a word] So, let me ask you a question. Would you like to see my dick?
TRANSVESTITE
Sure. Would you like to see mine?
NATHAN
Uh oh!
[At the Men's restroom in the park, Nathan is heard getting pounded with some funny sound effects]
NATHAN
Mimsy! Hel- help, Mimsy! [Mimsy approaches, but stays outside. The passenger exits the restroom and walks away. Nathan waddles out, hair and clothes disheveled] And I thought a shark was bad. [cartoon flourish at the end]
[The Broflovski house, evening. Gerald and Sheila exit and lock the door]
GERALD
Come on, honey. It says our Handicar is just pulling up.
STEPHEN
Timmy! Oh hi, Gerald, Sheila.
GERALD
Stephen, what are you doing?
STEPHEN
You didn't know? Anyone can be a Handicar driver now. All you have to do is get your own wheelchair and you can earn a Handicap. I've had my Handicap for about three days now. Get on in. [Gerald and Sheila get in, and Stephen pulls away.] I'm telling you Gerald, havin' a Handicar is a great way to make some money on the side. [other Handicar drivers begin to appear]
HC DRIVER 1
Timmy!
STEPHEN
Timmy!
HC DRIVER 2
[a woman] Timmy!
STEPHEN
The world of transportation is really changing, Gerald.
MIMSY
[standing at a street corner with Nathan] D'aww gee, your idea to have Handicar expand really worked, boss.
HC DRIVER 3
[getting too close to the curb] 'Scuse me, out of my way, please. I have a Handicap. [drives off]
NATHAN
I had a handicap way before you got paid to have one!
MIMSY
D'ahhh, you sound like that Matthew McConaughey guy. Ah "I drove a Lincoln way before I got paid to drive one." Drrrr. [Nathan smacks him again]
NATHAN
Shut up Mimsyyy!
[Tesla demonstration]
ANNOUNCER
[female] For the pat eight years Tesla has been the leading innovator in the world of automotive transport. And now the President and CEO of Tesla Motorcars, Elon Musk. [a robotic arm reaches out and grabs a platform behind one of the cars, and Elon Musk is on the platform. The arm sets him down at the foot of the stage as cameas flash away]
ELON MUSK
Today I am proud to announce the Tesla D, the most innovative and efficient world-friendly mode of transportation ever created. Any questions?
REPORTER 1
Yes, ahh, what about Handicar?
ELON MUSK
What about it?!
REPORTER 2
Well all over the country prople are realzing that using an app to ride-share is even more convenient and eco-friendly than electric cars.
REPORTER 3
How do you intend to compete with this boy genius in Colorado? [Elon Musk is not happy]
[Tesla Headquarters. day. An issue of of Tech Today is dropped onto a table next to a Tesla cup of coffee.]
ELON MUSK
I am so sick of hearing about app-based ride-sharing! The future of transportation is the electric cars, not wheelchairs!
EXEC. 1
Don't worry, Elon. Handicar is just a small company.
EXEC. 2
Oh sure, operating in a few small towns, but when they start absorbing the taxi markets, bringing taxi sservice to any part of the world, driving your kids to and from school, delivering both people and things?
EXEC. 3
We can't compete with Handicar! It's just so damned handy!
ELON MUSK
If there is a way to reduce Handicar's positive publicity, then we need to do it now! [walks to the table and plants his hands on it] And you! You say it's theoretically possible?
NATHAN
Of course. It's very simple. If you're a sheepherder, and a snake is killing all your sheep, how do you get rid of the snake?
ELON MUSK
Who's the sheepherder?
NATHAN
You are.
EXEC. 4
Who's the snake?
NATHAN
Handicar. [a few seconds of silence follow]
MIMSY
D'ah, it's an analogy.
NATHAN
[smacks Mimsy] Shut up Mimsyyy! [to Elom Musk] If you're a sheepherder, and a snake is killing your sheep, all you have to do is prove to the sheep that the snake is a completely inferior entity. [the Tesla execs look around at each other]
[South Park, day. Timmy is driving around town with a male passenger on his iPad.]
HC DRIVER 4
[going the other way on the street] Timmy!
TIMMY
Timmy! [stops at an intersection. A Tesla car speeds up next to him. The passenger window comes down and Nathan looks at him]
NATHAN
Hey Timmy. How is the fundraising for camp going?
TIMMY
Timmih! [holds his right thumb up]
NATHAN
[looks ahead] That's great. I can't wait for camp this year. [looks at Timmy again] We are doing some fundraising too. Have you heard of my friend Elon Musk from Tesla?
ELON MUSK
Good day to you!
TIMMY
Timmih!
NATHAN
Hey, how would you like to have a friendly little race? It would be great publicity for your fundraising and for ours.
MIMSY
[pops up] D'ah we're gonna get Timmy killed in the race, huh boss?
ELON MUSK
Shut up, Mimsy! [Mimsy reclines in his seat]
NATHAN
Whattaya say, Timmy? A friendly race this Saturday? We'll see you at 9am sharp. [the passenger window goes up, and they peel awat. The resulting wake almost blows the tablecloth off and Timmy's passenger almost losing his iPad keeping the tablecloth in place, At Skeeter's Bar and Coctails, a drunk patron walks out and a Handicar driver arrives to pick him up. He gets in, and they go away]
[Skeeter's Bar and Coctails, day, interior. Jimbo looks up at a TV monitor]
JIMBO
Hey everyone, you need to see this! [CNN Breaking News]
CNN ANCHOR
[with glasses] What started as a simple contest is quickly escalating into an international crisis. As electronic cars challenge the oil industry, and transportation alternatives fight for dominance, the unavoidable outcome may be a conflict the likes the world has not seen since the '70s. It appears that the world is once again on the brink [takes off his glasses] of Wacky Races.
RANDY
Wacky Races?! Holy shit!
CNN ANCHOR
The prime minister of Japan (Shinzo Abe is shown) insisted that any race would break the Treaty of Salzburg, which called for a cease-fire to the Wacky Races for their senseless brutality. They also claim that if a race does take place, they would have no choice but to enter their completely self-driven prototype Lexus into the conflict. The Canadians and Chinese are also saying they would be forced to race, and no one yet has heard from Dick Dastardly or Muttley. Unless a miracle happens, this Saturday morning the world will witness the fist Wacky Races in nearly 50 years.
[Food 4 Little, day. Shoppers rush in and get all the cereal they can get]
SHOPPERS
Wacky Races oh God! Wacky Races oh my God! Oh my God Wacky Races oh my God!
GERALD
Randy, they're bringin' back Wacky Races Saturday monring!
RANDY
I know! Are we watching at your house?!
MANAGER
That's it, everyone! We're out of cereal!
SHOPPERS
No! I didn't get any! That guy has two! [more clamoring]
MANAGER
There's none left, don't you understand?!
[The park at South Park, day. All the Handicar drivers are assembled, and Stephen Stotch holds court.]
STEPHEN
Don't you see what they're doing? This is just another example of corporations trying to keep down people with handicaps!
HC DRIVER 5
Don't do the race. You don't have to prove anything. [Timmy is shown, weary]
HC DRIVER 6
He HAS to do it, don't you see? He has people that are depending on him to raise as much money as possible. There are hundreds of people with handicaps now.
TIMMY
Timmih...
HC DRIVER 7
But isn't that the problem? I mean, let's face it, it's not like he's able to keep the driver quality up. Anyone can have a Handicap now. I mean, even Matthew McConaughey is a Handicar driver now, for Chrit's sake!
MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY
Hey. [rolls up] I was drivin' a Handicar... way before I got paid to drive one. I just like how it feels.
STEPHEN
Look, the point is that this is your opportunity to make Handicar- oops, sorry. [loses control of the wheelchair] Hold on, sorry, went too far. [comes back around] This is your opportunity to make Handicar thee transportation of thte future. Think what you could do with all that money. [Timmy begins to think over this]
[Wacky Races, Saturday morning. Each driver and car are shown as they are announced.]
ANNOUNCER
And here they are, the most daredevil group of shared-ride drivers ever to whirl their wheels in the Wacky Races, competing for the title of the future of transportation. Cars are approaching the starting line. First off is the Lyft car [a purple sedan with a huge pink mustache on the grill], a ride-sharing company out of San Francisco. next up is the ZipCar, a pay-by-the-hour concept based on Chinese bicycles. Maneuvering for position is the standard taxicab driven by an angry Russian. Right behind is the Hummer salesman in his 2014 Hummer No Class. And there's ingenious inventor Elon Musk in his new Tesla D. Oh, and here's the lovely Canadian actress Neve Campbell in the Canadian conept vehicle The Queef, powered completely on female natural gas. [she queefs to make it go faster] Next we have the Handicar with Timmy Burch. And there's the completely automated self-driving car from Japan. Limping along last are those double-dealing do-badders Dick Dasterdly and his sidekick Muttley. [Muttley snickers] And away they go on the way out Wacky Races. [a shot of the adults gathered in the Broflovski living room, with milk and Franken Berry and Kap'n Krunch cereals on the coffee table] And this live coverage of the event will be broadcast all morning, of course, on CNN.
STUART
Jesus. It's begun.
GERALD
God help them all.
RANDY
All I know is... if Dastardly and Muttley are up to their old tricks, there's gonna be a lot of violence today.
[BBC World]
BBC ANNOUNCER
You are watching BBC World.
BBC ANCHOR
The vioent conflict over transport is underway, and it is even more senseless and vile than many remember. We return you now to our live coverage of.. the Wacky Races.
[Wacky Races, Saturday monring. The race is well underway across Colorado.]
ANNOUNCER
As the Wacky Racers roll down the roadway, we see that the taxicab in in the lead, with Handicar pulling up the rear.
TIMMY
[way in back] Timmih!
ANNOUNCER
[a map shows up] All the cars must follow the same route. First they'll leave the town of South Park, then navigate through Giggling Gulch on the final stretch to pick up the passenger, a Miss Dotty Applegate. Once the passenger is picked up, the vehicle must successfully deliver her to the destination point at her daughter's house in Morrison. [back to the race] It looks like the ZipCar is trying to vie for position past the Hummer vehicle. It's neck and neck as the Wacky Racers all push to be first to pick up the passenger. [An elderly lady waits for her ride at a Thrift Or Less store] Miss Applegate is waiting patiently. [the racers are shown] And Elon Musk's Tesla appears to take the lead.
NATHAN
Slow down. I need Timmy to pick up the passenger before we do.
ELON MUSK
But I though we wanted Handicar to lose the race!
NATHAN
He can't just lose the race, he has to get sued and lose the whole business. That's why when he picks up the passemger, I've got a little surprise waiting for him. [he shows off a control pad]
MIMSY
D'ah hey boss, it seems like every time you come up with a plan it kind of backfires on ya. If you really don't wanna go to summer camp so bad, why don't you just tell your parents how you feel? [Nathan and Elon just look at him] You know, tell 'em you don't wanna go and just see how they react. [they keep loooking at him, and he gets a clue] Wait wait, I got it. [smacks himself] Shut up, Mimsy!
NATHAN
Hey Mimsy.
MIMSY
[leans forward] Yeah?
NATHAN
[smacks him] Shut up! [Mimsy sits back]
ANNOUNCER
The Canadian car overtakes the self-driving car. And now here comes the ZipCar, which is being driven by Matthew McConaughey.
MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY
[nice mood music in the car] I was drivin' a ZipCar... way before I got paid to drive one.
ANNOUNCER
And look at this! The Lyft car is the first to arrive and pick up the passenger. [Ms Applegate gets into the back seat, and the Lyft driver takes off] Now the Lyft car must take the passenger to her destination, but look at this! The Hummer salesman is running the Lyft car off the road! And the Hummer salesman is taking the passenger to the car and he is gong to let her drive herself!
MR. STEVENSON
[pitching the Hummer to her] You've got a fully automated sound system and your sunroof is operated right here. What do you think? Huh? Can you see yourself in one of these puppies?
ANNOUNCER
Elon Musk is using one of his kooky inventions to put the Hummer out of commission for good. [a cannon rises out of the Tesla and fires a shot at the Hummer. The missile hits the Hummer and blows it up.]
GERALD
Wow.
RANDY
Geez!
STUART
God.
RANDY
Did you see that?! Oh!
ANNOUNCER
The passenger is being taken to the Tesla D now. [Mr. Stevenson is dead, the Hummer is totaled. Musk escorts Miss Applegate, but the South Park taxi driver scoops her up] No way! She just got snatched by the pissed off Russian in his taxi. Miss Applegate is now in the back of the taxi and she's being forced to watch Jimmy Fallon. [Fallon is rubbing a giant pickle in his guest's face. Meanwhile, The Queef has stupped running] Uh oh, the Canadian car has completely run out of queefs. [Heve tries three times, but there are no more queefs in her] With the race neearly over, it's taxi out in front followed by self-driving car, and then pulling up in third is Handicar!
TIMMY
Timmih!
ANNOUNCER
It's gonna be a close one!
DICK DASTARDLY
Not too close, Boopsie! [Muttley snickers]
ANNOUNCER
Oh no, Dick Dastardly is up to no-do-goodery again.
RANDY
Ohh! Ohh! Duuude! [Dick Dastardly saws a tree in two, and the tree falls on the taxi, destroying it and the self-driving car that runs into the taxi. The adults in the Broflovski living room react to this]
GERALD
Oh no! Ohh!
SHARON
Oh no, I can't watch! [shields her face.]
RANDY
Oooo! Booom!
MRS. MCCORMICK
Ohohohh!
STUART
Nice! Oh yeah! [Sheila just hides her eyes]
ANNOUNCER
And there's Handicar to pick Miss Applegate up. [she climbs in and the Tesla is pulling up fast]
NATHAN
That's it! Handicar has the passenger! We're almost in range! Another hundred feet! [sees a bunch of cars closing in on him on his phone] Wait a minute. What the hell are all those cars? [lowers his window] Holy shit! [sees a fleet of Handicar drivers coming at the Tesla]
HC DRIVERS
Timmy! Timmy! [the drivers just bunch up on the Tesla and push it over on its side]
ELON MUSK
Aaaaaah!
HC DRIVERS
Timmy!
ANNOUNCER
We're near the finish line; the race is almost over. Handicar is in the lead, still way out in front of the ZipCar driven by Matthew McConaughey. [a shot of Matthew listening to his mood music]
MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY
Sometimes you gotta go forward by goin' backward. Are we drivin' cars or are cars... drivin' us?
ANNOUNCER
Dastardly car is racing past both. [Nathan and Mimsy hijacked it. Mimsy is driving] This could be an upset, folks. [Mimsy makes a U-turn and parks the Dastardly car off the road. He and Nathan get out]
TIMMY
Timmih!
NATHAN
Goodnight, you son of a bitch! [the ZipCar reaches them and Nathan presses the detonator on his control pad. The ZipCar blows up. Mimsy and Nathan take notice] Mimsy! I told you to put the explosives under Timmy's seat!
MIMSY
D'ahh you told me to put the explosives under the seat of that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves!
NATHAN
Not that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves! [secondary explosions create a portal above Matthew McConaughey, and he's sucked in]
ANNOUNCER
Oh my, it appears that an explosion has opend up a wormhole with Matthew McConaughey inside.
MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY
Mimsy! [the car levitates a bit, but as soon as the wormhole is gone, it falls back on the road]
ANNOUNCER
And there's the finish. It looks like Handicar has done it!
TIMMY
Timmih! [the handicapped kids all cheer]
[The meeting room, day. Steve gives Timmy a ribbon]
STEVE
A big congratulations to our fundraising champion! After selling the Handicar rights to Elon Musk, Timmy has raised 2.3 billion dollars for summer camp. [the kids cheer] Great job to all of you. This is sure to be the best summer camp ever! [more cheering]
[Nathan's house, night.]
NATHAN'S MOM
All set for bed, honey?
NATHAN
Yeah I like to sleep at nighttime.
NATHAN'S MOM
All right, goodnight. [kisses him on the temple and heads for the door]
NATHAN
Wait! [she stops] Wait, Mom? Can we talk?
NATHAN'S MOM
Um... yes, o-of course. [sits down on his bed]
NATHAN
This is very difficult, Mom. But um... You know how every year I go to summer camp? Well, I hate it. I hate it and I don't want to go anymore.
NATHAN'S MOM
I'm sorry, I can't understand you honey. You're handicapped.
NATHAN
What's to understand? I'm telling you I don't want to that stupid camp anymore!
NATHAN'S MOM
You want water? Is that what you want?
NATHAN
No! I don't wanna go to camp!
NATHAN'S MOM
Ohhh yes, okay honey, I'll turn off the lamp. [gets up, turns it off, and walks out, closing the door behind her]
NATHAN
No! That's not what I fucking said! [stumbles around in his room] Goddamnit, now I can't even see! Ow!
[Outside Nathan's room]
NATHAN'S DAD
What's he saying?
NATHAN'S MOM
That he doesn't wanna go to summer camp this year, but I'll be damned if he's gonna ruin our Italy trip.
NATHAN'S DAD
Right.
NATHAN
[still stumbling in his room] Oh! Aah! Mimsy!
End of Handicar

synopsis:Cartman and Butters get their hands on a drone and take it for a spin around the neighborhood

script:The Magic Bush

[Butters' room, day. He's at his computer singing to himself.]
BUTTERS
Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo.
CARTMAN
[opens Butters' door and enters] Hey, douchebag, are you doing anything kewl?
BUTTERS
Hey, Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took.
CARTMAN
[heads for Butters' bed] Oh goddamnit, nobody's doing anything kewl! [gets on Butters' bed and lays down on his back.] I'm so bored! Everything is so stupid!
BUTTERS
I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato.
CARTMAN
No, it isn't.
BUTTERS
My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake.
CARTMAN
That's stupid.
BUTTERS
You can see the momma bird fly in.
CARTMAN
I'm dying of boredom.
BUTTERS
We took all kinds of video with his drone.
CARTMAN
[sits up, suddenly interested] What did you say?
BUTTERS
[looks over his shoulder] You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere, and shoot video, and stuff.
CARTMAN
Your dad has a fucking drone?
[Butters' house, day. Butters and Cartman lift up the garage door and behold the drone]
CARTMAN
Whooaa! [runs up to it for a closer look]
BUTTERS
It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers.
CARTMAN
[pulls his finger back and smiles at Butters] You wanna take it out for a spin?
BUTTERS
Are you crazy?! This is my dad's drone!
CARTMAN
[runs up to Butters and stands next to him] Do you have any idea how much fun we can have with this thing? We can spy on everyone!
BUTTERS
My dad said it's not for spying on people.
CARTMAN
Butters, that's all drones are for. If we use it for a couple of minutes tonight, your dad will never know.
BUTTERS
Oh, he'll know. You can hear it take off.
CARTMAN
Okay, good idea. [picks up the drone] We'll take it over to my house. Come over after dark. And don't tell anyone!
BUTTERS
[goes to take the drone back] No, Eric. I don't wanna d-
STEPHEN
[off screen] Butters?
CARTMAN
Oh, shit, it's your dad! Go, go, go! [leaves the garage with the drone as Butters faces the source of the call, then pulls down the garage door] I'll see you later at my house.
STEPHEN
Butters, are you home??
BUTTERS
Comin', Dad! [leaves the garage through the side door into the house]
[Cartman's house, night. He's been working with the drone, figuring out how to operate it. There's a knock on his door.]
CARTMAN
Butters, is that you?
BUTTERS
Yes, it's me.
CARTMAN
[opens the door just a crack and peeks out] Nobody followed you, right? You didn't tell anybody?!
BUTTERS
Of course not!
CARTMAN
Alright, come in. [opens the door to reveal Kenny] Kenny's here; I told him all about it. [Kenny waves hello]
BUTTERS
What?! You said nobody would know!
CARTMAN
It's just Kenny. Like we're not gonna tell Kenny we have a fucking drone! Come on, Butters! Alright, come on, guys. I think I have this thing figured out. [outside, the drone sits in the grass in the backyard, 50 feet away from the house. Suddenly it rises to 23 feet, above the boys' heads, then veers to the right] Dude, no way! This thing is so epic! [the drone's camera shows some backyards through a fish-eye lens. A dog barks up at it from below.]
BUTTERS
Be careful! The powerlines!
CARTMAN
Dude, look! There's everyone's backyards! [in the distance, Kenny's house is shown from the back two blocks away. The drone veers to the right and drops down a bit, headed for a back door] Dude there's Craig's house! That's Craig's house!
KENNY
(Okay, try to get closer!)
BUTTERS
Okay, uh, maybe that's enough. [the drone approaches Craig's window]
CARTMAN
Aw dude, look, there's Craig! Heheh. [Craig is shown at his computer. The drone moves to the next window and shows Craig's mom undressing.] Craig's mom is taking off her clothes.
KENNY
(Are you serious?!)
BUTTERS
[gruffly] Let me see!
CARTMAN
Check it out guys, she's taking o- Oh my God, we've got full bush!
KENNY
(Stop taping!)
BUTTERS
Jeeeeezz!
CARTMAN
This thing is recording, right?
KENNY
(Yeah.)
CARTMAN
Dude! That is Craig's mom's bush right there! Wait, wait what's that? [Craig's mom has heard the drone and called her husband Thomas over. She stands behind him as they both look at the drone outside their window] Oh shit, dude! Bail! Bail! [thrusts the controller at Butters]
BUTTERS
What do I do?!
CARTMAN
His dad sees you!
BUTTERS
[begins to panic] I don't know what to do!
CARTMAN
Fly back to the house, stupid!
[The Stotch house, night. Thomas Tucker bangs on the front door and Stephen comes to answer it.]
THOMAS
You've got a problem, Stotch!
STEPHEN
What are you talkin' about?
THOMAS
You know what I'm talkin' about! There was a drone spyin' on my wife, and you're the only person I know with a drone!
STEPHEN
Hey now hold on. I am a drone hobby enthusiast. I would never use my drone in a way that contradicts the drone hobbyist code of conduct.
THOMAS
Horseshit! Your drone is out there flyin' around right now!
STEPHEN
I assure you, my drone is sitting in the garage. I'll show you.
[The Stotch house, garage. Stephen leads Thomas to the garage. He opens the side door]
STEPHEN
There, you see? It's right there. [sure enough, the drone and its controller are on the garage floor as expected.]
THOMAS
So, thuh so you flew it back here in time.
STEPHEN
I swear I didn't fly it.
THOMAS
Well, these things don't just fly themselves, do they? They outta be illegal. I'd better not find out it was your drone! [hurries out of the garage. Stephen looks at the drone and wonders... spooky theremin music plays, so he's a little afraid as well]
[Butters' room, night. Stephen opens Butters' door and looks in]
STEPHEN
Butters?
BUTTERS
[already in his PJs and in bed, but clearly panting] Oh, heh-hey, Dad.
STEPHEN
Butters, did you hear the drone making any sounds in the garage?
BUTTERS
[panting throughout] Ah, hold on Dad. I should be sleepin'. Why do you ask?
STEPHEN
Nothing, son. It's nothing. Get back to sleep, pal. Love you.
BUTTERS
I love you too, Dad. [Stephen leaves and closes the door. That was close.]
[South Park, morning. At the bus stop, Cartman and Kenny wait for the school bus]
CARTMAN
Alright, alright, shh Kenny, here come Stan and Kyle. Remember, not a word about this to anyone!
KENNY
(Yeah, I know, dude.)
CARTMAN
Not a word, Kenny!
KENNY
(Alright!) [Stan and Kyle's voices are heard]
STAN
Yeah, but seriously, it's like there's no real thing to hang on to, you know?
KYLE
Yeah, I don't even know if I'm gonna watch it anymore.
STAN
I know. [they take their places next to Cartman]
CARTMAN
Hey, you guys.
STAN
Sup? [the pressure gets to Cartman, but he resists. He finally cracks]
CARTMAN
You guys wanna see Craig's mom's bush?
KENNY
(Dude! What the fuck!)
STAN
What?
CARTMAN
Somebody, I guess, was spying on Craig's mom and they got pictures of her bush, and it's like, it's like a yeti. You guys wanna check it out? [whips out his phone]
KENNY
(Dude!)
KYLE
That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it.
CARTMAN
You don't wanna see Craig's mom's bush.
KYLE
Not if somebody took pictures without her knowing.
STAN
Let me see.
CARTMAN
[shows Stan] Locked and loaded. Full metal bush, bro.
STAN
How'd you get that on your phone?
CARTMAN
Oh. Um, uh... Kenny? [motions for Kenny to get closer, but Kenny doesn't budge] Oh, it was on the Internet. Yeah, I just downloaded it off the Internet and nobody knows who took it. Huh, Kenny?
KENNY
[grudgingly] (Uh huh.)
KYLE
That's terrible!
CARTMAN
I know, right? Now everyone's gonna see it.
[South Park Elementary, later. Craig is at his locker when Jimmy, Tolkien and Clyde approach him]
JIMMY
Hey, Craig, have you checked out the Internet lately? [he and the other two chuckle]
CRAIG
What are you talking about? [Cartman comes into view at the end of the hall and walks towards the boys room]
JIMMY
Ohhhh nothin'. It's just that... y-you might wanna invest in some hedge clippers. [he and the other two chuckle. Cartman chuckles as well]
CRAIG
For what?
JIMMY
Ohhhh nothin'. You just might wanna... hire Tarzan to do some... landscaping work for your mom. [he and the other two chuckle. Butters comes out of nowhere and shoves Cartman into the boys room, slamming him into the stall 1 wall]
BUTTERS
What the heck are you doing?!
CARTMAN
Whoa, Butters, chillax, bro.
BUTTERS
When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?!
CARTMAN
Butters-
BUTTERS
You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble!
CARTMAN
Butters. Butters.
BUTTERS
Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!
CARTMAN
Butters, I had to! [Butters lets him go] Okay, I had to put it on the Internet!
BUTTERS
WHY?!
CARTMAN
Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!
BUTTERS
I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand!
CARTMAN
Butters, don't start playing the blame game here, okay?! You and Kenny are just as responsible! And the next time you wanna shove me, just remember, I'm covering your ass! [they leave the restroom. Stall 1 opens and Kyle steps out, angry at what he just heard]
[Neighborhood Watch meeting, Roger Donovan's house, evening.]
ROGER
Hi everyone. For those of you I don't know as well, my name is Roger Donovan, and un, just like you I'm pretty upset about what's going on in our neighborhood.
THOMAS
How are these drones legal?! My wife didn't deserve to be splayed all over the Internet like that!
ROGER
Yes, well luckily nobody's watched the video of course. [a round of denials from the gathered adults] But the fact is that these drones are only getting more popular. I mean, anyone can get a drone off Amazon for 200 bucks, and there's no laws and the whole thing is pretty damned hairy. Oh-ohh, God I'm sorry Laura. [she looks around and gets mad] You know I I meant the situation is pretty hairy, right? Nothin' to do with you p-personally. I mean, how would I even know? I didn't see it. [she crosses her arms] Um...
RANDY
[stands up] Look, we're all here because what happened to Laura could happen to any of us. There's nobody regulating these drones and if we don't do something now, we're gonna be up to our navels with bush. [winces. Sharon puts her face in her left hand] Oh um, up to our necks in trouble. Sorry. [sits down and looks at Sharon]
LAURA TUCKER
You know, it used to be called "natural". Completely shaving bald down there used to be the weird thing.
THOMAS
It's okay honey, the-
LAURA
But now, because I "choose" not to let society dictate how hairy my vagina should be,
RANDY
Eeww.
LAURA
I'm labelled as some kind of freaking monster!
ROGER
And and and that's the point. I mean, we all have things about ourselves that are embarrassing, that that-
LAURA
I'm not embarrassed about it! It's natural!
STUART
It's a lot of natural.
ROGER
Look, look, why we're here is because it's gonna take all of us, a neighborhood watch, to make sure that our community stays safe.
MR. GARRISON
Yeah, but how can we keep that close a watch on the whole neighborhood?
RANDY
It's simple.
[The neighborhood, day. The first Neighborhood Watch drone, which is black, appears, followed by more drones.]
RANDY
Oh yeah, this is gonna work great. [smiles]
[The bus stop. The four boys are there. A Neighborhood Watch drone flies over it and then flies off.]
KYLE
Are you happy now?!
CARTMAN
What? [the drone returns and goes the other way]
KYLE
Is, is this? Do you think this is cool?
CARTMAN
What does that have to do with me?
KYLE
See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody!
CARTMAN
Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude.
KYLE
I was in the bathroom when you were talking to Butters, Cartman! [another drone floats by in the background] I know what-
CARTMAN
You were what?!
KYLE
I was in the bathroom-
CARTMAN
You were spying on me?!
KYLE
No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking!
CARTMAN
But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle!
KYLE
How is that spying?!
CARTMAN
You were listening, but we didn't know you were there?! How is that not spying?! You'r a dick! You're a spying dick! And now you wanna lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy! [another drone hovers by]
[A strip mall, day. One of the stores there is The Hobby Enthusiast. Stephen and Butters go inside.]
CLERK
Hello, can I help you?
STEPHEN
Yes, I'd like to return this drone. [sets it on the counter. The clerk looks through the open box]
CLERK
You wanna return it?
STEPHEN
Yes, I'm... I'm not into the hobby anymore.
CLERK
The hobby of flyin' drones is new and exciting. How can you not be into it? [Butters puts his arms tight against his sides and glances here and there]
STEPHEN
Look, something's wrong with it. It does things, it... [leans in] flies by itself.
CLERK
Uhh, noo, somebody has to control it.
STEPHEN
[stands straight] You don't understand. It was in the garage and the battery was fully charged. Someone said they'd seen it flying around, so I checked. [leans in] The battery was half empty.
CLERK
[looks at Butters, then back at Stephen] I'm sorry, but we don't do returns. [Butters relaxes a bit]
STEPHEN
Please, I just want another hobby to get enthused about.
CLERK
Sir, did you try looking at the SD card? All the video gets recorded to that so you could probably determine who flew it. [Butters tenses up again]
STEPHEN
You think I didn't try that? I pulled out the SD card. It was all erased. Somehow it erased everything.
CLERK
Uh, sir, did you consider that your son might have done that?
STEPHEN
No, it's impossible. He's not allowed to fly it without my supervision. [looks down to his right, then to his left. The clerk fixes his gaze on him]
[A closeup of Thomas putting his pants on. He hears a Neighborhood Watch drone buzz by and looks out his bedroom windows]
THOMAS
Oh for God's sakes! [goes into the bathroom, where he sees Laura at the sink, having just gotten out of the shower. He also sees another drone outside the window, which has open curtains] Goddamnit get the hell out of here! [the drone hurries away, and he goes to the window and closes the curtains] That DOES IT!
[Park County Police Department, day. The Tuckers are there to file a police report]
THOMAS
You people have to do something! You're the law, and these things NEED to BE illegal!
OFFICER 1
But they aren't illegal, Mr. Tucker.
THOMAS
Our privacy was invaded, and now there are kids at school making music videos with the footage of my wife! Have you seen what they're doing?!
SGT. YATES
Nono, none of us watched the video, but if we did, we could handle it. We're police officers. We see sickening things like that every day.
OFFICER 1
We understand the humiliation your wife has gone through, Mr. Tucker, but we don't-
LAURA
I haven't been "humiliated", I've been wronged! We are here to ask for your help, now are you gonna help us or not?!
OFFICER 1
Well that'd probably be best left to a professional hair removal company.
OFFICER 2
Or perhaps a forest ranger?
THOMAS
Help us with the drones spying on us!!
SGT. YATES
All right, all right. We'll do everything we can.
[South Park Elementary, day. Cartman walks by the boys restroom when Butters comes at him again and shoves him into the restroom, again slamming him into the stall 1 wall.]
BUTTERS
Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?!
CARTMAN
Butters.
BUTTERS
Why would you turn "Craig's mom's bush" into a music video starring us?!
CARTMAN
Because, Butters-
BUTTERS
Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?!
CARTMAN
[brushes Butters' hands off his jacket] Because, Butters, Kyle was spying on us, okay- [stops and kneels down to see if there's anyone in the stall, then gets up again] Kyle was spying on us, and he knows that we put the video of Craig's mom on the Internet. He found out everything. That's why I had to make another video.
BUTTERS
Why?!
CARTMAN
Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. "Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one."
BUTTERS
That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.
CARTMAN
Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It's... It' just gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they're public domain. You can get on the Internet right now and look at that chick from Hunger Games butthole. We can either all freak out about it, or we can just calm down because honestly, I'm getting a little sick of covering your ass!
[The neighborhood, night. A Neighborhood Watch drone flies around and hones in on the Broflovski house. Gerald is on the couch eating a slice of cake and watching TV - Real Housewives of Atlanta.]
RANDY
Heheh, Gerald is watching Housewives of Atlanta.
SHARON
You're supposed to be keeping watch on the neighborhood.
RANDY
I am. Let's see what Nelson's doing. [the drone leaves the Broflovski house and hovers over to the Neloson house, where Nelson is having sex with his girl. Randy puts his wine glass on the bedstand and concentrates on the video feed. He glances at Sharon a few times to see if she's noticing. She isn't. Soon, a police drone appears, with blue and red flashing lights and a siren. It aims for Randy's drone.] Oh shit! [gets his drone to fly off, but the police drone keeps up] Dude! Neighborhood Watch! I'm Neighborhood Watch! [has the drone turn to face the police drone, which is armed. The police drone fires two rounds into Randy's drone, which falters. Sharon finally looks over] I've been shot! [his drone crashes into a backyard] No! Noooo!
[News 4 breaking news.]
ANCHOR
Shock and outrage all over the state tonight after an on-duty police drone chased and shot down an unarmed civilian drone, and worst of all, yes, the civilian drone was black. [a picture of a similar drone pops up behind him]
JIMBO
What gives them the right to shoot down our drones?!
RANDY
I wasn't doing anything wrong! This is a complete outrage to drone owners everywhere!
FARMER
It was about yay big. [strokes the back of his head] I mean the hair on it was out to here [spreads his arms out so there's three feet between his hands], and then it had another trail of hair down from her belly button. I mean, the, the drone. Yeah, that's what I saw. That that's all I saw.
ANCHOR
While police claim they were only following standard protocol, the drone owners are banding together and holding a candlelight vigil.
[Downtown South Park, night. A group of civilian drones hovers down the street, each drone holding a lit candle. Sirens and lights come up and the drones turn right to see police drones approaching]
POLICE DRONE
Please disperse. Candles on top of drones are a fire hazard, [the civilian drones look at each other] Return to your garages.
MR. GARRISON
[on his bed holding the controller and a glass of wine] What the hell are these police drones doing? We can't protest now?
STEVE
[on his bed with Linda, his wife] Just hover, honey. They can't do anything if we're just hovering.
[Randy's house, later. Someone is banging on his front door, and he goes to answer it. It's Stephen, with Butters on the sidewalk]
STEPHEN
[looking frazzled] Randy. We need to talk.
RANDY
Okay.
STEPHEN
Inside. [Randy lets him in and moments later sits on the sofa with Sharon and Butters. Stephen paces the floor before them] I've been going over it and over it in my head. I thought Butters and I were alone, but then I saw you on the news. [walks up to Randy] Another drone hobby enthusiast whose drone was blamed for something the enthusiast didn't recall doing. Randy, this is very important. Is it possible that you did something contrary to the proper code of conduct for drone-flying enthusiasts?
RANDY
No. I didn't. [theremin music starts up as Stephen walks back to where he was]
STEPHEN
I thought it was just my drone, but I think it might be all of them.
RANDY
What might be?
STEPHEN
Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth! Our drone flew! The battery was drained! The SD card was erased! Butters was the only other person who had access to it! Butters can't use the drone without my supervision! So where does that leave us, Randy??
RANDY
...Drones are spooky?
STEPHEN
If they have minds of their own, they're more than spooky! I don't know about you, but I'm starting to feel pretty unenthused about this hobby.
[News 4 news break.]
ANCHOR
The town of South Park has become a hotbed of tension with civilians lashing out at police. After police used excessive force at a peaceful protest, the town has now broken out into full-scale riots. [sure enough, there are riots all over the place, but no humans are rioting. It's all the drones. One drone crashes into a building, then bounces off it and into a car through the windshield. Another drown crashes through Tele's display window and two others make off with a flatscreen TV] As the people of South Park continue to protest, the South Park police are now ordering a mandatory reverse curfew. The governor has asked for help from the National Guard to bring order to the town.
[South Park, day. National Guard drones begin flying into town. In one house, a woman goes to undress. A drone stops by to get a closer look, and a second one joins it, then they both fly off. The woman hears the buzzing and looks out her window.]
[20/20 preview]
ANNOUNCER
Tonight on an all-new 20/20. [a Viper probe droid appears onscreen...] A town in crisis over the matter of privacy. [...and gets a red "NO" circle stamped on it] Now for the first time we sit down and talk to the mom behind the bush.
[The Tucker house. A 20/20 reporter is interviewing Thomas and Laura in low light]
REPORTER
You've become sort of a poster child for privacy and drone issues.
LAURA
I don't think anyone wants to live in a world where police drones are monitoring Neighborhood Watch drones. I mean, where does it stop?
REPORTER
It just... keeps going on and on. Kind of like your... [Laura gets mad] I mean... it just... goes outside what most people would call... acceptable.
LAURA
Have you ever seen pictures of naked women before 2005?! It's not that weird!
THOMAS
It's okay, honey.
REPORTER
I didn't see the video. I don't believe in doing that, but uh... I'm just saying that... the situation in in your town is... unwieldy? [the power begins to flicker and on monitors everywhere the image of Stephen appears, with Butters behind him. Stephen now has facial hair and a paranoid look about him]
STEPHEN
Please do not adjust your televisions!
REPORTER
What is that?
STEPHEN
My name is Stephen Willis Stotch. The drone that took the video of Craig's mom... was my drone. I didn't want to believe it, but they do things without us knowing. At this point, I have completely lost all enthusiasm for the hobby. [a shot of Gerald and Sheila in bed with their glasses of wine and their controllers] All of you with drones, please listen to me. Three days ago my drone recorded a video that something uploaded to the Internet. We all were told to respectfully not watch the video. But on the page, [holds up a printout of the YouTube page] it has over three hundred million views, so if none of us watched it, who did? [a shot of Gerald and Sheila, then Steve and Linda] We have to find a way to get rid of them! Before they get rid of us!
[Cartman's house, day. His doorbell rings and he goes to answer it. It's Butters, and behind him are police drones and National Guard drones]
CARTMAN
Oh hey Butters. Sup?
BUTTERS
Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy.
CARTMAN
Dude, what's the matter?
BUTTERS
I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll-
CARTMAN
Okay okay okay. Come inside, there's drones out here. [takes Butters in and closes the door]
BUTTERS
I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses!
CARTMAN
Butters.
BUTTERS
I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!
CARTMAN
[while Butters speaks] Okay. Okay. Butters, Butters.
BUTTERS
I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does!
CARTMAN
Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones.
BUTTERS
You do?
CARTMAN
Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing.
BUTTERS
What?
CARTMAN
Your dad's drone.
BUTTERS
NO! There is NO WAY I'm gonna-
CARTMAN
Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?!
BUTTERS
...Okay.
[Butters' house, night. Stephen is at the sofa preparing a sizeable bomb. He's soldering the ends of a cable together, then takes a sip of spirits, then picks up a grenade launcher and pops a grenade in place. He stands up]
STEPHEN
Time to end this hobby once and for all! [he moves stealthily to his garage, opens the door, and jumps in ready to blow his drone up, but finds it missing again] No! NOOOO!
[Cartman's house. Kenny is back with Butters and Cartman as Cartman gets ready to execute his next big idea.]
CARTMAN
[with the controller] Alright, we've got power. Prepare for takeoff.
BUTTERS
If this doesn't work, we're dead.
CARTMAN
It'll work, Butters. If there's one thing we've learned, it's that drones can't resist Craig's mom. [he gets the drone going. It rises, pulling behind it a blow-up doll made to resemble Laura, with a large bushy wig over the crotch. The drone and doll hover away from Cartman's house.]
[Park County Police Station, night. The police drones, some with shields, hover over the civilian drones. A news drone flies by. Both sides jockey for positions, but then notice the National Guard drones arriving. One of the civilian drones then notices the sex doll floating by. The doll floats up to the police drones and National Guard drones and they take notice too. The doll floats away and all the drones, civilian, police, and National Guard, follow. The doll floats through the town gathering more and more drones. It goes over the bridge and across Stark's Pond, luring all the drones away. Where they ended up is anybody's guess.]
[A convention room, night, several days later. Stephen Stotch is at the podium with the rest of the town seated at tables. Everyone is applauding the Tuckers, but Laura isn't pleased.]
STEPHEN
We're here tonight to pay tribute to a woman who overcame humiliation, who rose above the monsters invading her privacy and said "No more!" Just when it seemed that we were about to live in a world controlled by drones, she did something miraculous. And someday, our children's children will still be telling stories about how Craig' mom flew through the town and led all the drones away. [more applause, and Laura buries her face in her right hand. A minstrel with lute comes out to sing Laura's praises]
MINSTREL
Have you heard the tale of Craig's mom's bush
And the night that it saved us from drones?
Nobody knew the power it had.
They just thought it was shaggy and gross.
Craig's mom live a life of shame and despair
Everyone feared her great giant bush!
LAURA
They didn't!
MINSTREL
But then when drones were filling the sky,
She unfurled her bush and she used it to fly.
Craig's mom's bush, Craig's mom's bush.
Gargantuan thicket of madness.
Bigger than earth and denser than gold.
Truly a magical bush to behold.
[Butters' and Cartman's table. Butters is a bit distraught. The minstrel continues with the lute and some whistling]
CARTMAN
Well, you see, Butters, everything worked out. [Butters doesn't respond] "Oh, thank you, Eric. I screwed up everything, but now everyone's happy. Thanks for covering my ass."
BUTTERS
Craig's mom doesn't seem very happy.
CARTMAN
[taken aback, then sighs] Alright, I have a way that we can make Craig's mom happy.
BUTTERS
No! No, no! I'm sorry. Thank you, Eric! I screwed up everything, but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass!
CARTMAN
You're welcome. [the minstrel begins to sing again]
MINSTREL
And she flew and she flew away into the sun
And then she died.
Craig's mom's bush, Craig's mom's bush.
Truly a magical bush to behold.
End of The Magic Bush

synopsis:Stan is addicted to the new Terrance and Phillip mobile game.

script:Freemium Isn't Free

[South Park Elementary, day. The hallway is full of students. Kyle walks down the hallway. Jimmy passes him going the other way, but notices him and walks over.]
JIMMY
Oh! Hey, Kyle! [Kyle looks over his shoulder] Kyle, hang on a sec. [He's holding his phone, on which is a Terrance & Phillip game]
KYLE
[turns to face him] Hey, Jimmy. What's up?
JIMMY
Not much. I just wanted to make sure you heard the fuh-fantastic news. There's a new Terrance & Phillip mobile game, and it's so amazing and incredibly fun.
KYLE
Oh. Really?
JIMMY
Yeah! And the most unbelievable part? It's totally free. You should download it to your phone right now. I mean, come. On. If it's free, why wouldn't you?
KYLE
[considers it for a moment] Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out.
JIMMY
You betcha, pal. [grins. Kyle turns and walks away and the grin fades. Jimmy turns and continues on his way]
[Close-up view of the Terrance & Phillip Mobile Game]
ANNOUNCER
The Terrance & Phillip Mobile Game. [The game goes from the splash screen to a layout of their town, starting at their house. Coins float over the streets, ready to be grabbed. The announcer pops into view] In this game, you are Terrance & Phillip. Can you collect all the Canadian coins? *poot* [disappears.]
[South Park Elementary, side entrance. Kyle has downloaded the game and is now playing it while Butters sits next to him on the steps and watches. Kyle taps on a coin...]
ANNOUNCER
That's one coin. Can you collect more? [Kyle taps on more coins on the screen] You've collected ten Canadian coins! [a big red 10 appears on a yellow star] Congratulations! [that word, also in red, appears above the 10] Hey, you're really good at this, guy!
KYLE
What?
BUTTERS
Congratulations, Kyle.
ANNOUNCER
[pops up again] With Canada coins, you can buy stuff that helps Terrance & Phillip rebuild Canada. [only five buildings, all houses, are shown, with the rest of the area being undeveloped] Run around and collect more coins, or better yet, buy them in bulk! [a Royal Bank price chart appears, with purchases going from 200 Canadian coins for 49 cents to 5700 for $50] How many Canadian coins would you like to buy?
KYLE
This is stupid!
BUTTERS
Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one. [Kyle taps on the button and coins pop out at him]
ANNOUNCER
You buy 200 Canadian coins for 49 cents! You're amazing! Now use that Canadough to help rebuild Canada! Click to build a hospital here. [a floating red arrow pops up on the empty block across from Terrance & Phillip's house. Kyle taps on it and the hospital appears]
TERRANCE & PHILLIP
Yaaay!
KYLE
It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it!
CARTMAN
[approaching wit Kenny] What are you two boners doing?
BUTTERS
We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.
CARTMAN
I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks.
KYLE
Who makes this crap?
[The Canadian Department of Mobile Gaming, day. It's a busy place, as suits go in and out of the building. A hockey skater zips by on the street with a puck. Inside, in a meeting room, two men are at a table. One of them is on a laptop while the other watches. The meeting room is ringed with curtains]
MINISTER
Oh! It's tewwific! That's 200,000 more American dollars in just one day!
PRINCE
Where is the roof on this thing?
TERRANCE
[the double doors burst open and Terrance & Phillip storm their way in] What's the big idea making a mobile game without our approval?!
MINISTER
Ohh, Terrance & Phillip! How are Canada's two favorite buddies?
PHILLIP
What gives you the right to make a stupid Terrance & Phillip mobile game?! Who do you think you are?!
PRINCE
Oh, I'm only the Prince of Canada! And this happens to be the Minister of Mobile Gaming.
MINISTER
We thought you would be pleased with the quality of the mobile game-eh.
PHILLIP
It's the dumbest game ever! All you do is collect and spend Canadough!
PRINCE
Ey! We know the game's not great, but who cares? It's free!
PHILLIP
But it's not free! If you charge 40 cents here and 50 cents there, then it's not free!
MINISTER
[low voice] They see through the charade.
PRINCE
Uh oh, you think so?
MINISTER
I think they see through the charade, yes.
PRINCE
I'm pretty sure they can hear us too. [Yes, and they're not pleased one bit.]
MINISTER
Alright, fuck it! You've seen through the charade, so you might as well know everything. Charade up! [walks up to a large heavy rope and pulls on it. A bell sounds and the curtain around the room go up, revealing white boards that show how the mobile game is set up. Terrance & Phillip are suddenly bewildered] Allow me to explain the science behind micropay premium gaming. For years, gaming was simple: you pay for the game and you enjoy. With mobile apps, we now have the ability to make games that are boring and stupid. But if you pay for incentives, you're rewarded!
PRINCE
Free"mium". The "mium" is Latin for "not really."
MINISTER
It's a simple cycle, a never-ending loop based on RPGs: Explore -> Collect -> Spend -> Improve. But whereas those just use the concept of XP or Experience Points, we've introduced the idea of micro-paying with money. Money. Money. Money money money money.
PRINCE
It's what everyone is doing. Freemium games are what's now. And it's all just a lot of harmless fun!
[The Marsh house, evening. Randy and Sharon have Stan on the sofa]
RANDY
You're in big trouble, Stanley! Can you explain to us how you managed to spend $489 on a mobile app?! [whips out a phone bill. Sharon's arms are crossed]
STAN
I'm sorry. I didn't realize I spent that much.
RANDY
You didn't realize! What are "Canadian coins"?
STAN
You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.
RANDY
Stan, just because I make a good living with my music doesn't mean you can go blow it all on Canadough!
STAN
I'll pay you back for it, okay?!
RANDY
How?!
STAN
I don't know, I'll figure it out! Jesus Christ!
[The master bedroom, later. Randy changes into red pajamas while Sharon is already in her white ones sipping some water.]
RANDY
Can you believe him?! He knew how much he was spending! He knew he'd get in trouble, but it didn't matter! [Sharon lies down] I hate to say it, but this is a lot like his grandpa.
SHARON
Wull whattaya mean?
RANDY
[faces Sharon] Dad's always had a gambling problem. He's got total addiction tendencies. Could he have somehow... passed those demons down to Stan?
SHARON
Well then you certainly have some of those problems too with drinking.
RANDY
I had a problem, but I was able to stop. Now I only drink gluten-free beer and wine. But with Stan, I think there's some darkness inside him that... doesn't... allow him to stop.[dramatic exit music]
[Back to the Canadian Department of Mobile Gaming.]
MINISTER
And so in conclusion, the successful premium game is based on five principles: entice the player with a simple game loop, use lots of flashing cha-chings and compliments to make the player feel good about themselves, train the players to spend your fake currency, offer the player a way to spend real currency for your fake currency-
PRINCE
So they'll forget they're spending money.
MINISTER
-and make the game about waiting. But let the player pay not to wait. It's a surefire way to make lots of money.
PHILLIP
We understand micropaying, but can't the game hidden inside the charade it- just at least be fun?
MINISTER
No no! It has to be just barely fun. If the game were too fun, then there would be no reason to micropay in order to make it more fun. [the Prince gives Terrance and Phillip each a check.]
TERRANCE
What's this?
PRINCE
Your checks of course. For ten million American dollars. Each.
TERRANCE
So this is- Everyone is doing this?
MINISTER
Ehhhveryone is doing it.
PHILLIP
It's just the way things are going?
MINISTER
It's the way things are going!
TERRANCE
Well, I guess if everyone is just paying forty cents at a time it can't be that bad.
[Stan's bedroom, day. Stan is playing the Terrance & Phillip mobile game in bed]
TERRANCE
[in the game] Hey Phillip! [Stan's bedroom door opens and in walk Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman]
STAN
Ohhh hey guys.
KYLE
You... missed school today?
STAN
Yeah, I just wasn't feelin' the best.
KYLE
Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day?
STAN
Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do?
CARTMAN
How much money did you micropay today, Stan?
STAN
Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto. [smiles]
KYLE
You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium?
STAN
You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?
CARTMAN
Yes.
STAN
It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out.
KYLE
Waitwaitwait, Jimmy told you about this game?
CARTMAN
Jimmy told me about this game.
KYLE
Kenny, who told you about this game?
KENNY
(Jimmy.)
KYLE
Dude, what?!
CARTMAN
The?!
KENNY
(Fuck?!)
[A street corner in South Park, near a fast-food restaurant. Jimmy stands there with phone in hand. He spots someone.]
JIMMY
Pssst. Hey, kid. Come over here. [a boy crosses the street and stands next to him] Yeah, come on over. Ch-check this out. You looking to have some fun?
BOY
What do you mean?
JIMMY
The Terrance & Phillip mobile game. [whips it out] All the cool kids are usin' it.
BOY
Aw, I don't know.
JIMMY
Come, on, just try it out. You can be Terrance or Phillip or both. You can walk around and collect Canada cash to build new stuff. [Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny appear at the other end of the block and spot him, then walk towards him a few seconds later] It's the perfect thing if you're bored. And honestly, the best part about it, is it's free. I mean, come. On. Why wouldn't you download it, and just try it out? [the boys reach him]
KYLE
Hey, uh, Jimmy, can we talk?
JIMMY
Why sure fellas. [the boy turns left and walks away] Anyway, be sure to check it out, kid.
KYLE
[walks up to him] Dude, what are you doing?!
JIMMY
Just hangin' out. What are you up to?
KYLE
You need to stop recommending that app to people!
KENNY
(Yeah!)
CARTMAN
Everyone we know says they heard about it from you!
JIMMY
I just think it's a fabulous app, that's all.
CARTMAN
It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!
KYLE
[crosses his arms] Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?!
JIMMY
[on the spot] Alright, alright! I never played it. I stay away from the stuff.
KYLE
You just push it on other people?!
JIMMY
They pay me to!
KYLE
Who, Jimmy?! Who pays you?!
[The Canadian Department of Mobile Gaming, day. The Prince looks out over the new construction going on in the city, then turns around]
PRINCE
You've both done an amazing job. New hospitals, new neighborhoods, all funded by one freemium game.
TERRANCE
Ahh, listen, ahh, we've been talking it over, and we really are uncomfortable with this freemium thing.
MINISTER
Oh. Ah what is the matter?
PHILLIP
It seems dishonest and we have a brand to protect. [Terrance jumps up and farts on Phillip, who laughs.]
PRINCE
But just look at all the things we're getting to build. Soon, Canada will be as advanced and developed as Michigan.
TERRANCE
We're just worried that some people will abuse the game and start spending more money than they can afford.
MINISTER
Hoh non! Well, we certainly wouldn't want that! [gasps] Oh! I have an idea! How about we take some of the billions of dollars we are making and, we start a campaign to teach everyone to play the game in "moderation"?
PRINCE
Ohhhhh. [claps furiously]
PHILLIP
Do you really think that would help?
MINISTER
Of course! The alcohol industry does it all the time!
[Live commercial for alcohol. A montage of people enjoying alcohol and the good life that often accompanies it.]
ANNOUNCER
You. Friends. Fun. Drink. Hot girls. You're hot. Drink more. Expensive cars. Ass, drink, ass, money, you in a tuxedo, threesomes, vodka, pussy, drink, drink, drink, you, drink, Vegas, fun, pussy, you, in a tuxedo, fucking this girl, vodka, drink drink drink drink it all you fucking pussy! MORE TUXEDOS, MORE CARS, MORE PUSSY, MORE VODKA, DRINK DRINK DRINK! [screen goes black with "Drink Responsibly" in white on it] Please drink responsibly.
[Three Feathers Casino, day. The camera pans from left to right. Randy appears in the far end of the casino and walks to the right]
RANDY
Come on. This way, Stan. I want you to see this. There you go. [Stan catches up] That's your grandpa. He sits at that slot machine and mindlessly drains money away a little bit at a time. Sound familiar? All the little sounds and lights are calculated to keep him sitting at that stupid machine. [they approach Marvin] Come on Dad, we're going home.
MARVIN
[playing at a 25 cent Lucky Unicorn slot machine] Ah, go away.
RANDY
Do you know what you've done to your grandson? You've infected him with your bullshit!
MARVIN
What are you talkin' about?
[The Marsh house, some time later, day. Randy is pacing the floor in front of the sofa as Stan and Marvin sit and listen]
RANDY
I just don't understand what is wrong with you two! What is the joy that this stuff possibly brings you?!
STAN
It's just...
MARVIN
It's fun.
STAN
Yeah, it's fun.
RANDY
It's not fun! You two have demons you're trying to compensate for!
MARVIN
Well what about you?! You're havin' a glass of wine!
RANDY
I'm not having a glass of wine, I'm having six! [walks up to a small buffet cabinet on which sit six different glasses of wine, from syrah to rosé] It's called a tasting, and it's classy![Marvin looks away]
STAN
Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it.
MARVIN
[faces forward] Yeah, and if he stops, I'll stop.
RANDY
All right. And if you two stop, then we won't have a problem anymore. [gulps down the glass of Merlot] HM. Earthy, bold, hint of cherry aftertones. *uurp*
[Jimmy's house. He stands by a window contemplating]
JIMMY
Is it my responsibility what people decide to do with their feh-f-free time? I was just a middleman. [turns around and walks across the room] People were going to learn about the game somewhere if not from me. I'm not the one who made it.
KYLE
But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!
JIMMY
How do you get people addicted to crack? You give it away for free. You give away a little taste and then... and then some people... can't stop themselves.
CARTMAN
[approaches Jimmy and grabs him by the shirt collar] And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?!
JIMMY
I needed the money, alright?! [Cartman releases him and he walks off a bit] I downloaded Yum Yum Sparkly Gem Forest because it was free. I love the sparkly little gems. The sounds they made when I got new ones. Then I made my first in-app purchase. Before I knew it I had spent my allowance, then my birthday money, I LOST my CRUTCHES!
KYLE
You have your crutches!
JIMMY
It's a figure of speech with crippled people. We'd say we lost an arm and a leg, but they ain't worth much.
CARTMAN
That makes sense.
KYLE
You're saying these games do this on purpose?!
JIMMY
[faces the boys] Why do you think freemium games send you those text notifications when you haven't played in a while? It's called a trigger. A quick image to trigger the addict's brain. They know exactly what they're doing.
[Stan's bedroom, night. He's awake in bed looking at the ceiling. The first notification comes in on his phone]
VOICE NOTIFICATION
Hey, buddy. Come on, guy. [Stan turns to his left side and the notification disappears, but just as he closes his eyes another one follows.] Come back, friend. You've got new buddies, guy. [Stan takes his pillow and puts it over his head. The third notification comes in] We've just given you 5000 Canadian coins. [Stan quickly looks at his phone] Enjoy your Canadough.
STAN
...Free? [puts his pillow back on the mattress, grabs the phone and starts playing again]
[The Marsh kitchen, day. Randy and Stan are in it]
RANDY
What is wrong with you, Stan?! You said you stopped buying Canadough!
STAN
I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up.
RANDY
$26,000??? Do you know how many songs I have to write to make back that much money?!
STAN
One?
RANDY
Oh, it's just nothing' to you, isn't it?!
STAN
No, no, it's not.
RANDY
You need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way, okay?!
STAN
I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!
RANDY
I am not chugging beer! [walks up to the breakfast table on which are eight glasses of wine and eight of beer, paired up. He's gone through four pairs already] I'm sampling a flight of gluten-free German lagers with a French wine pairing! It's called a smorgaswein, and it's elegantly cultural! [plops the fifth lager into the fifth wine glass and chugs down the pair, then blows a whistle while shaking his head with his hands. Stan has nothing to say.]
[Kyle's house, day. Stan walks over to it and rings the doorbell. Kyle answers the door.]
STAN
Okay, I need help. [sometime later Cartman, Kenny and Jimmy arrive, and Stan picks up where he left off. The conversation moves to the living room, and Kyle gives Stan a comforting tap on the right shoulder] There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand.
JIMMY
Fellas, can I have a moment with Stan, please?
KYLE
Sure. Come on, guys. [he, Cartman and Kyle walk away]
JIMMY
This is my fault, Stan. I should have never told you the game was fuh fufuh fan-fantastic.
STAN
It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse.
JIMMY
I know this stuff is hard to understand. Trust me, I know. I'm an addict too. But I got help.
STAN
How?
JIMMY
What all the addiction programs say is true. You've gotta reach out to a higher power, Stan. You've gotta get down on your knees, and you've gotta say "I have a problem." And you've gotta ask that higher power for help. [Stan is left deep in thought]
[The Broflovski kitchen, at the same time. The other boys are in there waiting for Jimmy and Stan]
KYLE
[brainstorming] We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then-
CARTMAN
It's done. [he had been texting on his phone]
KYLE
Wuh, what's done?
CARTMAN
The word is out. [shows him the phone] "Terrance & Phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts." I tweeted it. [glances at his phone's screen] It's trending.
[The Canadian Department of Mobile Gaming, day. Terrance & Phillip burst through the doors again]
TERRANCE
You son of a bitch! You paid pushers to get addicts hooked on our freemium game?!
PRINCE
You what?
MINISTER
Now hold on, Terrance & Philip, there's nothing wrong with promoting a mobile game.
PHILLIP
But there's something very wrong with knowingly making it appeal to human weaknesses!
TERRANCE
You didn't build a mobile game, you built an addiction machine!
PRINCE
Minister of mobile gaming, what's this all aboot?
MINISTER
Alright, alright, you've seen through the charade again. Let me explain how freemium games really work. [pulls down on the heavy rope again and new, prepared whiteboards come down over the used ones. The doors close and the room gets dim.] The truth is, a very small percentage of people who download freemium games ever pay anything for them. It's all aboot finding the heaviest users and extracting the most amount of cash from them. That's how you get addicts to pay two hundred bucks for a game that's not even worth forty cents.
TERRANCE
But then all our profits come from people with problems.
MINISTER
Don't think aboot that. Think about all the money. Here, have a bump of coke.
PHILLIP
[snorts the bump] Okay, but we still won't stand for this!
[Stan's room, night. He's kneeling by the side of his bed, looking up at the moon. Then he gets to prayer]
STAN
I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way? [a bright, fiery light appears behind him and he turns to look at it. Satan emerges from it]
SATAN
You have summoned the Prince of Temptation! For what purpose?!
STAN
Whoa, shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them.
SATAN
Then allow me to explain the darkness of the human soul! [moments later he's on Stan's bed, the fiery light gone] So you got dopamine, right? That's the chemical that gets released in your brain whenever you do something pleasurable, like eating, sex, and that's just nature, right? Like rabbits and fish and shit. They need dopamine so that they want to consume and reproduce.
STAN
Okay.
SATAN
But because humans have progressed and now have access to all the shit they want whenever they want it, it's easy for them to overdo and have dopamine problems. You know, it's not fuckin' rocket science, this stuff.
STAN
So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me?
SATAN
Fuck no! It's like, okay, it's like being diabetic. You know, it's like you can eat wrong and eat wrong and chemicals get released from your liver in a weird way, you know, you've been eatin' gluten and shit, and then eventually you've got a chemical imbalance from your liver. And something clicked, and now you're diabetic forever, right? So like, if you keep doing something too much, eventually there's, ummm, a dopamine fuckup, right, and you're kind of screwed up for life.
STAN
So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?
SATAN
Yeah, that's pretty much what it means.
STAN
The addict people said something about me filling a hole.
SATAN
Well who's not filling a fuckin' hole? Right? You know, I mean what kind of bullshit is that? So, let's talk about genetics now. You still have time?
STAN
Yeah, no, this is great.
SATAN
Okay, let me get some visual aids. Gimme juuust a sec.
[The Canadian Department of Mobile Gaming, day. The Minister continues with his lecture]
MINISTER
Here is a fact: 80% of alcohol sales are paid for by alcoholics. Using slot machine tactics, freemium games are able to make millions off of an even smaller percentage of mobile gamers.
PHILLIP
Oh God, he just doesn't stop!
TERRANCE
Who IS this guy?!
MINISTER
We're building a new Canada with micropayments from addicts! Who cares?! You think the fucking alcohol industry cares?! They don't care that 10% are gonna get addicted, they're COUNTING on it!! It's the same with us, but we've got our eyes on every addict's screen! [the whiteboards begin to dissolve into the walls, with the words floating around independently]Every button they click, we get feedback on how to shove this shit right down their throats!
PHILLIP
Why does he suddenly sound like Al Pacino in Devil's Advocate?!
MINISTER
Hohon, I'm much worse than the Devil. [he transforms into a Canadian devil and floats up towards the ceiling] I'm the Canadian Devil. [laughs]
TERRANCE
Oh dear God! It's the Canadian Devil!
PHILLIP
Beelzeboot!
BEELZEBOOT
You discovered my plan, but too late! [lets out a flaming turd] Now the souls of all Canadians belong to me!
TERRANCE
Oh no!
PRINCE
Oh, what have I done?!
BEELZEBOOT
Heheheh! Hahaha! [lets out a flaming turd]
[Stan's room, night. Satan continues his talk with Stan, this time with a small whiteboard]
SATAN
So basically, the genes you got from your dad make you more likely to have trouble with, um, dopamine regulation, and that's why you need to kind of watch out for addictive stuff.[puts the whiteboard aside] Okay, so we kind of understand now, champ?
STAN
I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?
SATAN
You know, they all do it, and it's kind of my deal, I have to put temptation out there too, so people have free will and all that shit. But ,you know, everyone has their justification and thinks what they're doing is okay.
VOICE NOTIFICATION
*Ding* Ey, buddy, where'd you go? Don't you want more Canadough?
SATAN
What's this?
STAN
That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications. [Satan taps the screen, stands up, and plays the game]
SATAN
What, you just collect coins?
ANNOUNCER
How much money can you buy today?
SATAN
No, see, if something's addictive because it's fun, that's one thing. But this is just blatant Skinner box manipulation. Wait a minute. Who put this out?
STAN
Ah, Canada?
SATAN
Oh that son of a bitch! He's always doing this shit! I tell him, "temptation has to be nuanced!" but he goes and does this crap again! I'm gonna need to borrow your soul real quick, kid. Is that alright?
STAN
...Okay. [Satan proceeds to possess Stan] Aaaaahhh!
[The Marsh living room, moments later. Randy and Sharon are on the sofa. Randy wears a beer hat with two cans of gluten-free PBR attached to it, one by each ear]
RANDY
Oh pass interference! Interference! [points at the TV. Stan walks by]
SHARON
Stan, where are you going? [Randy looks over]
STAN
[with Satan's voice] I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me. [continues out the door]
RANDY
Told ya. Kid's got demons. I don't do that. [Sharon looks at him]
[The Canadian Department of Mobile Gaming, under a fiery sky.]
NC 9 REPORTER
Horror and sadness all over Canada tonight. When the Prince signed the agreement to make a freemium game, he apparently made a deal with the Canadian Devil.
BEELZEBOOT
[flies up to the microphone] Hey, guy, I'm the Canadian Devil. [lets out a flaming turd and flies back into the Department]
NC 9 REPORTER
The Canadian Devil now has complete control of the soul of every Canadian. This is a sad day for Canada, and therefore, the world. [Beelzeboot goes to torture Terrance, Phillip, and the Prince, who now hang from chains tied to the ceiling]
BEELZEBOOT
Heh heheheh, I stab you. [Satan, now in Stan's body, appears outside the meeting room and blows the doors off, then walks in]
SATAN
Beelzeboot! Once again you lack any sense of nuance!
PHILLIP
Who the fuck is that?
BEELZEBOOT
Well well, my overachieving doppelganger! You're no match for Canadian Satan! [lets out a flaming turd]
SATAN
Return from whence you came! [purple balls of energy appear around his hands, and they produce two beams of flame which carry Beelzeboot out into the sky]
BEELZEBOOT
Ow! Watch it, guy! [the battle continues in the sky]
NC 9 REPORTER
Sadly, a shocking turn of events here as the actual Devil has now appeared and seems to be fighting the Canadian Devil! This is certainly a conundrum for Canadians everywhere as we try to figure out who to root for. For that, let's ask the Minister of Sports in Edmonton. [The Canadian Minister of Sports appears on split screen]
MINISTER OF SPORTS
Well of course, the patriotic thing to do would be to root for the Canadian Devil. But then again, he is the one who has promised us pain and servitude for a million years.
CANADIAN
Screw that, go Canada!
SATAN
Enough, Beelzeboot! Thy end has come. [the balls of energy reappear and this time he aims the flames down at Beelzeboot. He destroys the Department in the meantime. Flaming skulls appear and go back into the pit Satan created]
[The neighborhood park, day. Cartman, Kenny, and Kyle play basketball there when the ground next to them opens up and a bunch of red arms lift Stan out, repairing the court just before Stan lands on it.]
KYLE
Hey dude.
STAN
Hey.
KYLE
Y-you alright?
STAN
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. [turns away and walks off the court]
CARTMAN
Cool.
[Canada. There's a huge celebration, and the Prince steps up tp the podium]
PRINCE
My fellow Canadians, what we do now as a country will hopefully be a model for others. We have all learned a tragic lesson together: that though many sins are out there, when you get involved with freemium gaming, you are making a deal with the Canadian Devil. We will no longer make freemium games, and we will no longer make improvements to our country with money taken from addicts. Canada is back to being an ethical, respected, shitty tundra. [cheers erupt from the crowd]
[The Marsh dining room. Grandpa and Stan are playing a board game]
STAN
I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie.
MARVIN
Well okay, good idea. [Stan rolls the dice]
RANDY
[stops by with an ornate silver cup] What are you gaywads doin'?
STAN
We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps.
RANDY
Well all right! Good for you guys. Tell you what, I'll join you. Board games go good with a glass of wine. [takes a seat]
STAN
That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking.
RANDY
It's not drinking. It's called a White Zinfandel Sipping Sprint, and it's competitive. Get off your high fuckin' horse.
STAN
Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies. [Marvin takes the dice and rolls them]
RANDY
You guys wanna put some money on it? [Stan bangs his head on the table.]
End of Freemium Isn't Free


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Butters is convinced he's living in a virtual reality.

script:Grounded Vindaloop

[South Park Elementary, day. Butters walks down the hallway wearing a fake Oculus headset. He stumbles along as if he's actually in virtual reality. He checks out the other kids, the floor, the surroundings...]
BUTTERS
WHOOAA! It's all so real! Uh this is amazing! It's like I'm there! [Craig turns to watch] I see all our friends at school. Oh wow! If I hold up my hands, I can see them too. Whooaa... [He and Stan bump into each other and Butters begins to run his hands over him] Wow, you were right. I can actually feel it.
STAN
[holding Butters off] Butters, what the hell are you doing?
BUTTERS
I feel Stan! He looks totally real!
CARTMAN
[hidden around the corner, in front of the camera] That's awesome, Butters. [snickers away from the walkie-talkie] Keep making your way down the hallway. Your vital signs are looking good. What do you see now? [snickers away from the walkie-talkie]
BUTTERS
More of the school. [Clyde talks to Bebe, who then leaves]
CLYDE
What are you doing, Butters?
BUTTERS
The school and all the kids. [Clyde walks away] I still can't hear any sound except for your voice.
CARTMAN
Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I- [mutes the walkie-talkie and whispers] He's so fucking stupid. [un-mutes it] But I'm sure they will soon.
BUTTERS
[beginning to wobble] Ah, okay uh, I think I'm done, Eric. Ah I'm feeling kind of dizzy and uh- [about to take off the fake headset]
CARTMAN
[watching him from around the corner] Butters, no! Are you crazy?!
BUTTERS
What what what?
CARTMAN
What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub??
BUTTERS
[turns so that he's facing away from the camera] Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot!
CARTMAN
You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?!
BUTTERS
I'm sorry!
CARTMAN
You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that??
BUTTERS
Yeah.
CARTMAN
You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies, Butters. You have to hurry!
BUTTERS
[begins to run] Oh Jesus! [Cartman looks on from around the corner]
[From school to home. Butters comes out the front doors and runs to the sidewalk. He looks both ways and runs off to his left. Next, Cartman's house is shown the Cartman's room. Butters makes it inside, where Cartman has put up fluorescent posters and accents]
BUTTERS
Okay, I'm back in your room!
CARTMAN
Alright Butters, sit down at the computer. [Butters does this] Now drop the suppornity window! We're just gonna make it!
BUTTERS
[drops a shield over the glasses] Suppornity window dropped. [Cartman enters his room, locks the door and turns on the lights, then walks over to Butters and removes the fake headset. Butters wipes his eyes]
CARTMAN
Welcome back, dude.
BUTTERS
Wow! That was cool!
CARTMAN
How do you feel? Do you feel okay?
BUTTERS
I touched Wendy's boob. [smiles]
[The cafeteria, lunchtime. Cartman is at table with Kyle, Tolkien, Kenny, Stan, and Jimmy. Cartman is laughing his ass off, but soon gets back to his story]
CARTMAN
And then, and then he, he took off the shop goggles, and he was all like, "Whoa, I'm back." [pounds his left fist on the table] Damn it if it's not the awesomest thing ever!
STAN
Sound pretty typical to me.
CARTMAN
Come on, guys! This is the cure de gars of Butters' torture!
KYLE
Coup de grah, Cartman
CARTMAN
Thank you, Kyle.
STAN
Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone?
CARTMAN
Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he deserves to be taken down once in a while, okay?!
BUTTERS
Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period? [in a knowing voice] Not that we were doing anything interesting. Right Eric? [chuckles]
CARTMAN
Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won't happen again.
BUTTERS
You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said "Well, technically I was in school." Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric?
CARTMAN
Right Butters. [softly over his left shoulder] These guys are so dumb, huh?
BUTTERS
Yeah. [runs off with his food tray]
CARTMAN
See? He's an asshole. Fuck him.
[Cartman's room, night. Butters is at the computer while Cartman holds the fake headset in hand]
CARTMAN
Each time you go into the virtual world it becomes more and more dangerous. Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters?
BUTTERS
Well, not a hundred percent...
CARTMAN
Even 10% is good enough. Here you go. [hands him the headset and Butters puts it on.]
BUTTERS
Okay, subject is ready.
CARTMAN
[picks up the walkie-talkie] Okay, Butters, I'm booting up the core competency now. [presses a few keys on the keyboard] Edifice framework is online. Vital signs appear to be normal. Interim status?
BUTTERS
Interim status is go.
CARTMAN
[turns off the room light so the fluorescent lights stand out] Digital malcontent now at parameter alpha. Prepare for full graphic interfaces on my mark: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, [raises the shield]Mark. [quickly hides in the closet as Butters gets accustomed to the headset again]
BUTTERS
It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal.
CARTMAN
All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside.
BUTTERS
Going now! [bumps into the door frame, then goes downstairs. A second or two later Cartman comes out of the closet, turns on the light, goes to his computer and sits on his chair]
CARTMAN
Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work.
BUTTERS
Okay.
[Stan's room, night. Stan is reading a book when he heats something outside. He sets the book aside and looks out his window. He sees Butters shoveling snow off people's driveways]
BUTTERS
How much more of this am I supposed to clear up?
CARTMAN
You're doing great. Almost done with this level Butters. Just make sure you clear the driveway and uh walkway of all the virtual snow.
BUTTERS
Okay. It's so realistic. [a shot of Stan watching from across the street.] The snow looks kind of fake though. [Stan leaves the window] Alright, I think that's all of it.
CARTMAN
Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. This is the part where you collect the money.
BUTTERS
[rings the doorbell. A middle-aged woman answers the door with a dollar bill in her hand] There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me!
CARTMAN
Just take the money, Butters! [Butters reaches for the bill and takes it.]
BUTTERS
Okay, I got it!
CARTMAN
You got the money? [Butters walks down the walkway as the lady closes the front door] Okay great, Butters. Now get back to the access point.
BUTTERS
Already? Oh no!
CARTMAN
Yeah, Butters, the discrepancy bars are oscillating. You need to uh, come back. [eats some more chips] Are you heading back Butters? [no reply.] Butters? [Butters goes home] Alright, Butters, you should be heading back to the access point now. You're going off grid.
BUTTERS
I'm sorry, Eric, but there's just one thing I gotta do real quick. [goes inside, leaving the front door open]
STEPHEN
There you are, mister! Just what do you think you're doing?!
BUTTERS
Hello, Dad! It's me, Butters!
STEPHEN
I know that! What do you-?
BUTTERS
This is for all the times I got grounded! [makes a fist and fires it at Stephen's groin. Stephen doubles over in pain]
STEPHEN
Ohhh! Oooooo! Ohhh!
BUTTERS
HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist! [at the other end of the call, Cartman is shocked] Haha! How do you like that, Dad?!
LINDA
Butters, why?? Oh my God!
BUTTERS
Huh, that was incredible!
CARTMAN
[getting worried] Uh, Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now.
BUTTERS
I feel amazing! [giggles] I'm back outside now. I'm a baaaaad man! You hear me?! [starts throwing rocks] Eh take that, you stupid cars! [a hit car screeches to a halt]
DRIVER
[steps out of the car] What the hell are you doing, kid?!
CARTMAN
Butters, it's, uhh, time to stop. Get back to my place.
BUTTERS
[knocks the driver out of the car] Who's the man now?! I'm gonna take his car! This is like Grand Theft Auto!
DRIVER
Hey! [Butters peels away]
BUTTERS
Whoa! I'm in the car now.
CARTMAN
Oh shit! [runs outside] Butters! Butters, where are you now?
BUTTERS
Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here.
CARTMAN
Okay Butters, let's call it good, okay?
BUTTERS
I'm gonna beat her up and take her money!
CARTMAN
Wait, hang on Butters!
BUTTERS
Take that, you dumb hooker!
HOOKER
What you doin' motherfucker?!
BUTTERS
I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me.
CARTMAN
Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing!
BUTTERS
I can't [wheeze] I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH!
CARTMAN
Butters?? Butters?? [turns the walkie-talkie off]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, now bigger, with two new wings and four floors. Moon shadows appear on the facade. Butters is in a room with a doctor and a nurse]
DR. CARROLL
You're very lucky, young man. You've got a couple of hairline fractures, but the knife missed your spleen by half an inch.
BUTTERS
I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality.
DR. CARROLL
No, you actually got stabbed by a hooker. We've called your parents and they're on their way. Your dad wanted me to let you know that you're grounded more than you can possibly imagine.
BUTTERS
Aw nuts!
DR. CARROLL
Try and relax, and when your parents get here we'll sort this all out. [the doctor and nurse leave. The nurse turns off the light]
BUTTERS
I wonder how long I'm grounded for?
CARTMAN
Butters. [Butters looks to his right. Dramatic camera pan from Butters to Cartman, who stands on the window sill like Morpheus]
BUTTERS
Ahhh!
CARTMAN
Are you okay?
BUTTERS
Eric! Uh what are you doing here?
CARTMAN
I'm not here, Butters.
BUTTERS
What?
CARTMAN
This is going to be hard to understand, Butters, [climbs down to the floor] but, you've become trapped in a simulation. None of this... [spreads his arms out] is real.
BUTTERS
[looks around skeptically] Nuh uh!
CARTMAN
Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality. [pulls off the missing thumb trick.]
BUTTERS
WHAT?? [Cartman puts on a couple of thumb lights and clicks them on and off in alternate order.]
CARTMAN
You see, in this world, things aren't... what they seam. [pulls out a wand from his sleeve and produces a bouquet of flowers from it]
BUTTERS
[now on edge] Aghah. Okay, stop! Stooop!
CARTMAN
Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you.
BUTTERS
Ah how do you know that?!
CARTMAN
[pressing a buzzer] How would I know that the nurse is about to walk through that door? [hides under the bed]
NURSE
Everything okay in here?
BUTTERS
Aaaaah! Yes! Y-yes everything's fine!
NURSE
O-kay. [turns around and walks out. Cartman comes out from the window side of the bed]
CARTMAN
Butters.
BUTTERS
NO!
CARTMAN
I'm gonna get you back to reality, Butters. But you have to give me time! I've gotta go. The Orion parameters are embellishing. Just stay quiet! [performs another trick in which he gets a coin inside a glass bottle... and succeeds]
BUTTERS
[thoroughly scared, shuts his eyes] AAAAAAHAHAH! [he opens them moments later and Cartman is gone.]
[The bus stop, next day. The four boys await the bus. Kyle is angry at Cartman]
KYLE
Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized!
CARTMAN
I'm happy that I totally got away with it. [gets a call] What's a 911 area code? Hello?
STEVE
Hello, Eric. My name is Steve from Oculus Customer Service. There seems to be an error with our virtual headsets, and on behalf of the company, I would like to apologize and try to help.
CARTMAN
With what?
STEVE
This is going to be very jarring for you, but, there has been a malfunction with the headset you ordered from us. Right now, you're actually in your room at your computer wearing an Oculus headset, but, you're in a coma-like trance, my friend.
CARTMAN
[slowly] Fuck you!
STEVE
I understand your shock, my friend, but you have simply been in the virtual world so long you have forgotten.
KYLE
You should probably listen to him, dude.
CARTMAN
Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality.
STEVE
The people you are talking to are just computer programs, my friend.
CARTMAN
Guys, tell him you're not computer programs.
KYLE
[glances at Stan and Kenny] Maybe we are.
CARTMAN
[sighs and squeezes his eyes shut for a moment] Kyle, just- don't be a dick right now.
STEVE
I know this is very hard for you, but we don't have a lot of time.
CARTMAN
Do you really think I'm that stupid?! That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you! [Well...]
[Cartman's room, day. Liane has prepared a glazed burger for Cartman and takes it to his room. She knocks on his door.]
LIANE
Eric? Poopsiekins? [hearing no reply, she opens his door and goes in] Eric? [Steve was right. Cartman is at his computer wearing the Oculus headset, in a coma-like trance] Honey, maybe that's enough computer time. It's been about nineteen hours now. [Cartman's left foot twitches] I know you said not to disturb you with your new toy, but Mommy thought maybe you needed to eat? [this time Cartman moves his whole body] All right, I'll just leave it here, hon. [sets the burger next to the computer] I'm turning in for the night. Mommy loves you.[exits and closes the door]
[Butters' house, next day.]
STEPHEN
What kind of person did we raise you to be?! You think this world is just there for your amusement?! You are not to leave this room, and you are not allowed to use the phone or the computer!
BUTTERS
Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this!
STEPHEN
Oh no, mister. You are GROUNDED! [Butters recoils and Stephen slams the door shut. Butters turns around and goes to sit on the floor beside his bed. The door opens and Cartman enters]
CARTMAN
Are you fucking with me?!
BUTTERS
...What? What do you mean?
CARTMAN
Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?!
BUTTERS
I don't know what you mean.
CARTMAN
Because if you are, it's not cool!
BUTTERS
Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world!
CARTMAN
Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality!
BUTTERS
Oh really? Oh, that's a relief.
CARTMAN
Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program!
BUTTERS
Oh gosh!
CARTMAN
That's right!
BUTTERS
OH GOSH!
CARTMAN
THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life?
BUTTERS
Yeah.
CARTMAN
Well if you get grounded in virtual reality, you get grounded in real life too... FOREVER! [Butters is alarmed]
[The neighborhood park, day. Stan and Kyle are playing tether-ball near the restrooms. Kyle's phone rings]
KYLE
[answers] Hello?
BUTTERS
Kyle, it's Butters. I've been grounded!
KYLE
Again?
BUTTERS
No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle!
KYLE
Uh huh.
BUTTERS
I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense!
KYLE
Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now.
BUTTERS
PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the-
STEPHEN
Butters?! Who is that?!
BUTTERS
Ahhh! Wuhhhh! Ahhh- [Kyle looks concerned and hangs up]
KENNY
[runs up to Stan and Kyle, panicked] (You guys! You guys, oh shit, come check this out!)
[Cartman's room. Kenny leads Stan and Kyle inside over to Cartman, who is still passed out wearing the Oculus headset]
KENNY
(You see? Look at all this dried up food. He must have been here for days!)
KYLE
You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?
KENNY
(Yeah!)
KYLE
[slowly] Fuck you!
KENNY
[taken aback] (What??)
KYLE
Get up, Cartman!
KENNY
[angry] (This isn't a prank, Kyle!)
KYLE
Okay, then let's take him to the hospital. You hear that, fatso?! [shakes Cartman's chair] You're goin' to the hospital!
STAN
Kyle, maybe this is for real.
KYLE
[looks back at Stan, then turns around to face him] Fuck you if you're in on this.
STAN
In on what? [thinks a moment...] Ohh, [slowly] Fuck you!
[The customer service center in India]
STEVE
Yes, no, sorry, but because you bought two business-class tickets I can NOT refund the fares. [listens to the response] That's right, there is nothing we can do. All right. Have I answered all your customer concerns in a timely, polite manner? Thank you for calling Korean Airlines Customer Service. [clicks to the next caller] El Pollo Loco Customer Service, this is Steve.
KYLE
Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service.
STEVE
Oh, yes, ah, yes my friend. [clicks again] Oculus Customer Service, this is Steve.
KYLE
Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset.
STEVE
Ohh yehhs, yes. What is your name please?
KYLE
Kyle.
STEVE
Kyle. I need to advise you that this call may be recorded to help with better customer service in the future. Is that agreeable to you?
KYLE
I don't care!
STEVE
He doesn't care! I can continue! All right, listen very carefully my friend. The headsets we sold you are having some minor problems.
KYLE
You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!
STEVE
Yes. And that is why we are trying to locate all the headsets and do a recall. Do you understand? It is a Total Recall.
KYLE
[rolls his eyes, then slowly] Fuck you!
STAN
"Fuck you" what?
KYLE
He said they're doing a Total Recall.
STAN
Oh fuck you!
STEVE
All right, did I take care of all your customer needs in a timely and satisfactory fashion today?
KYLE
You haven't done anything yet!
STEVE
But the customer service - was that reliable? And did I accurately and politely respond to your concerns?
KYLE
We need help! Our friend is in a coma!
STEVE
Uhhh let's see, ah, it looks like... one of you is going to have to put on the Oculus headset and go into the virtual world and convince your friend to get to an access point. Could you try that, my friend? [Kyle looks at his phone, then at the user's manual]
[South Park, morning. A signal interrupts the scenery twice, but is quickly gone]
[Cartman's house, living room. Cartman is pacing the living room trying to calm himself]
CARTMAN
It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool. [the doorbell rings and he answers. It's Kyle.]
KYLE
Hey, Cartman, I need to talk to you.
CARTMAN
I know. Let's go to the backyard. [turns and walks to the backyard. Kyle is quite surprised by Cartman's reaction. Moments later they takes seats at the picnic table out back. A butterfly floats by]
KYLE
Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible.
CARTMAN
Okay Kyle.
KYLE
Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here.
CARTMAN
Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?
KYLE
Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here.
CARTMAN
[laces his fingers together, with his index fingers making a steeple in front of his lips] Mmmhmm.
KYLE
I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me.
CARTMAN
And why did the guys send you, Kyle?
KYLE
Www-what do you mean?
CARTMAN
Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on.
KYLE
Fuck you!
CARTMAN
I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle.
KYLE
Don't... do that!
CARTMAN
Calm down.
KYLE
NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-
CARTMAN
In virtual reality, yes you did.
KYLE
No. Then I came into this virtual space.
CARTMAN
You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!
KYLE
Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?!
CARTMAN
[defeated] Fuck!
[Best Buy, day. A Best Buy rep answers a phone]
BEST BUY REP
Thanks for callin' Best Buy. How can I direct your call?
KYLE
Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there?
CARTMAN
Or if I did?
KYLE
Or if you sold one to an "Eric Cartman"?
BEST BUY REP
Sir, I'm gonna have to connect you to Customer Service. Hang on a sec. [transfers the call and hangs up. The call now reaches ... Steve!]
STEVE
Best Buy Customer Service, this is Steve.
KYLE
[stunned at the familiar voice] Dude... What?
CARTMAN
What? [takes the phone from Kyle] Hello?
STEVE
Yes, hello. This call may be recorded to ensure good customer service in the future.
CARTMAN
Dude. NOW this is getting weird!
[The Stotch house, night. Stephen and Linda sit down for dinner]
STEPHEN
[loudly] Well, this looks like a lovely meal. Too bad Butters won't be enjoying it. You hear that, mister?! No dinner for you! While you're grounded you can just GO TO BED HUNGRY! Linda, do you remember why Butters is grounded? What, what did he do?
LINDA
Oh. I don't know, Stephen, I let you handle all the groundings.
STEPHEN
It's strange. I don't recall him really doing anything particularly bad, and yet... and yet he is grounded. [hears something upstairs] And no bouncing the racquetball either!
[Cartman's room. Stan and Kenny are the only two in the room, and Kenny's wearing the Oculus Rift. Stan is talking to Customer Service]
STAN
No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help! [the door opens and Cartman and Kyle walk in]
KYLE
Wait. Stan? [walks up to Stan] Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality?
STAN
It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real.
KYLE
Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then-
STAN
No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time.
KYLE
Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.
CARTMAN
[still lost] No, you guys. This is virtual reality.
STAN
How do you know?
CARTMAN
Because... I'm a computer program.
KYLE
God damn it Cartman!
CARTMAN
I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real.
KYLE
He's lying.
CARTMAN
I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service.
STAN
What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service?
STEVE
Ohhh yes yes yes! That I can answer! His name was... But-ters!
STAN
Butters called Customer Service first?
STEVE
Have I answered all your questions in a satisfying and courteous manner?
STAN
Come on, we're going to Butters' house! [they leave Kenny behind]
STEVE
Hello? My friend? My friend, I believe we are having some technical issues with our phone line. Please hang on, I'm going to call Customer Service.
[Steve talks to himself]
STEVE
Hello, Customer Service, this is Steve.
STEVE
Hello, this is Steve with Customer Service.
STEVE
Uhhh, nononono my friend. I am Steve with Customer Service.
STEVE
Listen, my friend. This is gong to be very hard to comprehend, but none of what you are seeing is real.
STEVE
...Ohhh, nohhh, nonononononono.
STEVE
My friend, my friend, a customer who is in virtual reality called Customer Service, and it has created a customer feedback loop. Okay? Here in India we call it a customer feedback vindaloop.
STEVE
[slowly, wagging his left index finger] Ohhh, fuck you!
STEVE
Nononononono, do not fuck me, because I am you and then we will just be fucking ourselves. Now, have I provided answers to your questions in a courteous and prompt fashion?
STEVE
What do you mean have you answered all my questions?! NO! You have not answered ANY questions at ALL!
STEVE
Nonononono no, listen, listen: if I didn't answer your questions, then we have given bad customer service!
STEVE
But you didn't answer any of my questions!
STEVE
Well what is more important, my friend? The result, or good customer service?
[Butters' room, day. He sits on the floor by his bed playing a child's xylophone. The curtains are drawn, but leave a small gap through which the sun shines in]
BUTTERS
[singing a spiritual] I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind. If Jesus don't help me I surely will die. [his door opens and Stan, Kyle, and Cartman come in]
STAN
Butters.
BUTTERS
[startled] Huh. But... [stands up] you guys can't be here.
KYLE
Why not?
BUTTERS
Because I'm grounded. That means no visitors.
KYLE
Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!
BUTTERS
When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember? [goes to the bedroom door] We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life.
STAN
So now we are in the real world.
BUTTERS
YES.
CARTMAN
You guys! [the boys look at him] I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing all this, and it's not me!
STEPHEN
[appears behind him] Butters!
BUTTERS
[really startled] AAaaghagh!
STEPHEN
What are your friends doing here?!
BUTTERS
Huh I'm sorry Dad!
STEVE
Hello, hello my friend, are you still there?
STAN
Yes, we're here.
STEVE
Listen carefully, my friend. You are stuck in a paradox. It turns out there are three things you cannot do in virtual reality. You cannot die, you cannot get grounded, and you cannot call Customer Service. This is why you are having problems.
STEPHEN
You just don't get it, do you?! What is wrong with you?!
STAN
[as Stephen chews Butters out, puts some distance between them and himself] Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality?
STEVE
That does not matter! There is only one thing that matters!
STAN
What?! [Stephen unbuckles his belt, Butters holds a hand up]
STEVE
Have I answered your questions satisfactorily and offered GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE?!
STAN
That doesn't make sense! [Stephen takes his belt off. Butters closes his eyes, knowing what's coming]
STEVE
That's the paradox! Please my friend, please! I am not real! You are not real! Have I answered your questions and provided good customer service?! This call may be recorded! [the boys look at Stephen and Butters as Stephen prepares his belt for a whipping]
STEPHEN
Well, you're getting it now!
STAN
Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!! [Stephen disappears, then Butters, then Kyle, then Cartman] You guys? Are you there?
KYLE
[from a walkie-talkie] We're right here dude. Do you remember now?
STAN
Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point. [leaves Butters' room. Stephen and Linda never really left the dining room table/ Stephen senses a change in mood]
STEPHEN
Oh my gosh! Linda!
LINDA
What is it, Stephen?
STEPHEN
It's Butters. He's not grounded anymore.
LINDA
He's not?
STEPHEN
No. I've I've got to tell him! [leaves his chair and runs up to Butters' room] Butter? Butters! [Butters is on his bed, with the curtains open, asleep]
BUTTERS
[wakes up] Ahhh, huh?
STEPHEN
You can go outside and play, son.
BUTTERS
You... you, you mean ih... [sits up] I'm not grounded?
STEPHEN
No. I don't know why or how, but... it's over.
BUTTERS
They did it! [hops off his bed] They figured it out! [heads out the door] Whoopie!
[Cartman's house, later. Stan walks up to the house]
STAN
Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?
KYLE
We're here, dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this.
STAN
[goes upstairs and enters Cartman's room] Okay, I'm back in Cartman's room.
CARTMAN
Alright, Stan, just sit down at the computer. [Stan does this]
KYLE
Alright, dude, take off the headset. [Stan reaches up and removes the headset. At this point the animation switches to live-action. Stan finishes taking off the headset as Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny watch]
KYLE
Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus?
STAN
[thoughtfully looking at the headset] It's pretty cool, but the graphics suck.
[Credits start rolling but after few credits roll there is shot back at Stan's room]
BUTTERS
[hops in like a bunny] Fellas, I'm not grounded anymore.

synopsis:There are illegal goings-on in the basement of City Wok.

script:Cock Magic

[South Park Elementary hallway, day. The students are going about their business when several girls arrive with fliers in hand.]
GIRL 1
[handing out fliers] Hey guys. [Clyde takes one] Thanks. Support your team? Thank you. Hey guys. Did you get one of these? [walks up to Cartman and Craig] Hope you can make it.
CARTMAN
[takes a flier] What's this?
GIRL 1
The girls' volleyball team has a big game tonight and we're just asking for people to come cheer us on.
CARTMAN
[looks at Craig.] Girls volleyball? [they both laugh at the thought] Uhhh, sorry, we're actually busy.
GIRL 2
What's wrong with supporting girls' athletics?!
CARTMAN
Dude, girls should totally be allowed to play sports, you just can't expect people to want to watch. Okay? [hands the flier back to girl 1] All right.
GIRL 3
[walks up to Stan, Kyle, and Kenny] You know, we're actually in the playoffs, and all we keep hearing is "We're too busy."
KYLE
But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight.
GIRL 3
What fight?
STAN
Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls' volleyball. [he, Kenny, and Kyle laugh]
CARTMAN
Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch.
[A shop in South Park. A board on the sidewalk says "Magic the Gathering Tournament Today." Inside, Kenny and a heavy-set player, Slaughterhouse, are sat at a table already playing against each other, The player shuffles his cards around looking for the best ones to play]
SLAUGHTERHOUSE
Alright, I'm going to play a fifth mana card... and then I'm going to attack with my Elderbeast- hold on. Wait. Hold on.
KYLE
Can Kenny block his Elderbeast?
STAN
Not with his Shapeshifter. It already attacked.
CARTMAN
This asshole needs to make a move already!
REFEREE
Quiet in the peanut gallery, please.
SLAUGHTERHOUSE
I am attacking, but with a newly summoned Spark Ghast who has Trample. Four damage to your planeswalker.
BOYS
Ohhhh!
BUTTERS
Oh no! Kenny!
STAN
Shhh!
BUTTERS
But he's dying! [Kenny lays down a card]
STAN
What's that?
CARTMAN
He's playing an enchantment.
STAN
This late?
KYLE
He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade!
SLAUGHTERHOUSE
I can block that with Uprooted Minotaur. [Kenny lays down his next card]
BOYS
Ohhhh!
REFEREE
Serendib Sorcerer unblocked. Winner: McCormick!
BOYS
Yeeahhh!
SLAUGHTERHOUSE
Nnoohhh!
[South Park Elementary, day. Cartman recounts the previous day's events to the kids in the hallway. In the distance, a new janitor listens in while mopping the floor]
CARTMAN
Dude, it was complete brutality!
KYLE
You've never seen anything so ruthless!
STAN
It was seriously almost hard to watch. [Wendy appears in the distance and walks over to the boys]
CARTMAN
At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro!
STAN
[sees Wendy] Wendy, did you hear about last night?
WENDY
Yeah, I heard the girls' volleyball team won by like 20 points.
STAN
Not that. Did you actually go to that?
WENDY
Yeah. You should show your support too sometime.
STAN
Pfft, whatever.
CARTMAN
Dude, I don't think people are appreciating this! [the janitor finally looks at the group] It was such pwnage it was almost repulsive!
JANITOR
Hey! Pssst! [the boys see him] Come over here. [the boys walk over to him while the other kids disperse] You guys like hard-core stuff, huh?
CARTMAN
Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro.
JANITOR
Yeah well, you boys wanna get in on some real action? If you like excitement. I'm not talkin' about the little boys stuff. I'm talkin' about real man shit.
STAN
We're men.
JANITOR
Well then, if you wanna see REAL fights with REAL brutality, go here. [hands them a sheet of paper with an address on it, and Kyle steps forward to take it] This is the underground stuff, so keep it quiet. [turns right and leaves] And you might wanna pack a barf bag.
CARTMAN
[steps forward and watches him leave] Kewwwl!
[South Park After Dark. The boys walk to a familiar place.]
KYLE
Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok.
CARTMAN
What's hardcore and exciting about Shitty shrimp? [they approach the doors]
KYLE
It doesn't even look like they're open. [tugs and knocks at the doors]
MR. TUONG
[unlocks the doors and answers them] We crosed! We crosed for the night! Go away prease! [waves them away]
STAN
Uhhh, Mitchell the Janitor sent us?
MR. LU KIM
You purice?
KENNY
(What?)
CARTMAN
Dude, do we look like police?
MR. LU KIM
Okay, come on, come on, five dorrah, five dorrah each! Come on, five dorrah!
CARTMAN
Five dorrah?! [Mr. Lu Kim hushes them quickly and leads them to the back room, which leads to the basement. Lu Kim opens the basement door]
MR. LU KIM
You go down! Go down, find seat! We in sixth fight! Gogogogogogogo! [the kids go in, then Mr. Tuong, who closes the door behind him.]
[City Wok basement. Lots of activity going on down there. Two roosters are set to fight each other with cards. The boys make it to ringside. An announcer calls the play-by-play]
ANNOUNCER
Scrambles plays a Black Swamp mana card. Fluffy counters with a mana card of his own. And he plays a Fugitive Wizard!
CROWD
Ooooooo.
ANNOUNCER
More mana from Scrambles! And yes, that is Crippling Blight! Crippling Blight to the Fugitive Wizard! Creature now has -1 to strength and defense! More Mana from Fluffy. Now he'll attack with Fugitive Wizard, and there's an instant attack from Scrambles! That is Peel from Reality! Fugitive Wizard is literally torn apart from the battleground!
THE BOYS
Whoa!
ANNOUNCER
The mana is flying now as both roosters play sorcery spells! It's Mass Calcify against Into the Void!
[M Burger, next day. The boys are eating.]
CARTMAN
Dude, that was total carnage!
STAN
That was freakin' hardcore.
CARTMAN
Can you believe that rooster played a Kalonian Twingrove with half his mana tapped?
STAN
It was just decimation.
KYLE
It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.
CARTMAN
We're going again on Friday, right?
STAN
Hell yeah! [Kenny lowers his head, and Cartman notices]
CARTMAN
What's the matter Kenny?
KENNY
(I don't know. It just seems kind of... mean)
STAN
What's mean about it?
KENNY
[mumbles]
CARTMAN
You feel bad for the roosters?
KENNY
(Yeah, I feel bad for the roosters.)
STAN
Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard.
KYLE
Yeah, maybe that's just kind of what they do naturally.
CARTMAN
Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder.
KENNY
(No.)
CARTMAN
Huh? A little bit?
KENNY
(NO.)
STAN
Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster.
KYLE
Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass!
CARTMAN
What do you think Kenny? Would that make you feel better? Huh? Come on, where's that smile? Where's that smile, Kenny? I think he's smiling you guys. [Kenny just looks at his meal]
[The McCormick house, day. Two officers stand at the landing as one of them knocks]
DET. HARRIS
Hello, Mr. McCormick. Surprised to see us?
STUART
What do you mean?
DET. HARRIS
Let's cut the crap, huh? We know there's an illegal cock Magic ring going on in town, we just wanna know who's leading it.
STUART
What's cock Magic?
DET. HARRIS
Right. Roosters are being forced against their will to play "Magic: the Gathering," and you know nothing about it because you're 'white'. Let's git something straight: cock Magic isn't an Asian thing or a Mexican thing. White people do it too, if they're poor enough. You got a junked car in your front yard, Mr. McCormick. Care to tell us where the cock Magic fights are being held?
STUART
I don't go to any cock Magic fights!
DET. HARRIS
Do you have any sympathy at all for the animals, Mr. McCormick? Can you imagine being kept in a small cage, barely able to turn around, and then finally let out only to be blasted by Arctic ice spells and legendary creature cards? It's illegal, and it's wrong, and anyone I find involved with this filth is goin' down!
[The Marsh house, day. The boys are on the sofa and Randy is lecturing them on Magic: the Gathering. Or on cock Magic.]
RANDY
Now I don't wanna lecture anybody, but what you boys are getting involved in is dangerous!
STAN
Dad, it's not that big a deal.
RANDY
It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college.
KYLE
You were?
RANDY
Yes, so I'm not some fuddy-duddy who doesn't get it! I just wanna make sure if you boys do it, you do it right, and safely. [whips out a handkerchief, and drums begin to play. Randy places the hankey over his pants and begins a demonstration of cock magic, as he knew it]
[Randy's cock magic. It moves left, then right quickly. Then it pops up from behind the hankey, then pops under]
STAN
Dad, that's not, that's not cock Magic.
RANDY
Oh? Not impressed? How about this? [makes his penis pop out right, left, down... up, left. Stan hides his face in his hand while his friends are speechless]
[A run-down house, much like Kenny's, day. The boys approach it and ring the buzzer. This place has an intercom]
VOICE
What is it?!
CARTMAN
Hello? We're looking to buy a rooster that can play "Magic: The Gathering"?
VOICE
Never heard of cock Magic, or roosters.
KYLE
Uhhh, we aren't cops or anything.
BREEDER
[The voice, opens up and lets them in] Come on to the back, don't mind the smell. [he takes the boys to his barn and shows them around] We only deal in the highest quality poultry Planeswalkers. Are you looking for a New Hampshire or a Cornish breed?
KYLE
We don't... really know the difference.
BREEDER
Well, your New Hampshire broiler chickens are the best for white mana. These here have been raised to play mostly protection spells and do well with sorcery cards. And here you got your green mana necromancers. Lots of earthy growth and hindering incantations that are good against blue- or black-stacked decks.
STAN
Do you think they're happy?
BREEDER
Do I think they're happy?
STAN
Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play "Magic: The Gathering"?
BREEDER
[thinks a moment] They're fuckin' chickens.
CARTMAN
Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any free-range chickens?
BREEDER
Free-range chickens are primarily control deck players that slow the game down with board control cards.
CARTMAN
Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh, Kenny?
STAN
[off-screen] Hey, how about this little guy?
BREEDER
That one's kind of young. I don't even know what kinda cards he prefers.
KYLE
Then he's perfect for us.
CARTMAN
What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about "McNuggets"?
KYLE
Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?
CARTMAN
[mimicking a rooster] "Yes I do, you guys." [normally] Oh wow, did you hear him, Kenny?
[The Marsh house, day. Sharon is in the master bedroom folding clothes when Shelly appears]
SHELLY
Mom, will you tell Dad to get out of the bathroom?! He's been in there for an hour!
[The Marsh bathroom, moments later. A drummer is heard inside]
SHARON
Randy?
RANDY
[lounge voice] Hey! Oh! Oh thank you!
SHARON
[Sharon pounds on the door] Randy, what are you doing?!
RANDY
Oh! Nothing, Sharon. Just going to the bathroom, if you don't mind. [back to the lounge voice] Hey!
SHARON
Randy, why are there drums playing? [the drums stop and Randy opens the door]
RANDY
All right, Sharon. I'm practicing. Cock magic is making a comeback.
SHARON
Ohhh, no no nononononono no.
RANDY
Oh yehhs yesyesyesyesyesyes, Sharon, I don't know why or how, but people all over town are talking about it again. Now you know that I was one of the best back in college.
SHARON
I know. That's why you got kicked out of college.
RANDY
Because people didn't understand! People were afraid, Sharon! But now culture has caught up. And even our son is discovering what cock magic has to offer.
SHARON
Stanley??
RANDY
People are going to do it, Sharon. And it's up to the professionals to make sure it's handled the right way. Hoh! [a hankey drapes his erect penis] Oh my gosh! [pulls the hankey off and the penis is back in his pants. He smiles, she walks away, his smile fades, and he goes back into the bathroom and shuts the door]
[City Wok, Friday night. Tonight, it's McNuggets against a different rooster.]
ANNOUNCER
Reuben casts Silklash Spider. Silklash Spider can block as if it had Flying! And now he casts Geistflame, dealing one damage to McNuggets.
CARTMAN
[through gritted teeth] Come on, McNuggets! Fight!
KYLE
You can do it, McNuggets! [the crowd argues around them]
ANNOUNCER
Quiet, please.
SOMEONE
I think I'll bet on the next one.
ANNOUNCER
Waaiitt! [the crowd gets quiet] McNuggets has cast Punishing Fire, absorbing the Geistflame and dealing two damage to the opponent! Game, set and match, McNuggets!
CROWD
Whoa!
STAN
Yeah!
CARTMAN
All right, McNuggets!
KYLE
All right, McNuggets! [after the fights the boys leave City Wok] Did we pick the right rooster or what?!
CARTMAN
[carrying McNuggets in a small cage] That was goddamned manly! I mean, no offense to Kenny, but that shit made regular "Magic: The Gathering" look like girls' volleyball.
PROMOTER
[comes out behind the boys with two bodyguards] Excuse me. That was pretty impressive down there. You boys have a nice cock.
CARTMAN
Thank you so very much.
PROMOTER
I've never seen a rooster throw down spells with such raw brutality. How would you like to move him up to the big time?
KYLE
You mean there's more to this?
PROMOTER
Oh, yes. And I'm not talking about the basement of some seedy Chinese restaurant, I'm talking about the basement of a well-established Chinese franchise. Saturday night, here's the address. [again Kyle takes the slip of paper] Let's see what kind of money your cock can really make.
STAN
Gee, thanks!
CARTMAN
You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues!
[A girl's sixth birthday party, back yard. Lots of kids running around and making noise. A bounce house is off to one corner]
WOMAN
Okay kids, it's time for our birthday show. Everyone, let's be quiet now. Come on.
KINDERGARTEN BOY
Yay, a show, a show!
WOMAN
Do you kids like magic?
KINDERGARTNERS
Yeah, yay!
WOMAN
Okay, well let's all give a cheer for the Amazingly Randy! [leaves as Randy enters, and the kids cheer]
RANDY
Hey kids, are we having fun? [places his hat over his groin, then reaches for it on his head] Oh where'd my hat go?! Anyone see my hat? [no reaction from the kids. Inside, the parents are preparing the cake]
WOMAN
[mixing some lemonade] Okay, the magician has started. Let's get the cake ready.
RANDY
[with his penis in a box and a saw in his left hand] Now, some of you might think that this is a little crazy, but if you believe in magic... [begins to saw through the box] you'll find that- [the saw hits something that produces gushes of blood. All the kids are hit and they panic] Ow! Ow! Oh God! Can somebody help, please!
MAN
[chuckles] They're getting a kick out the magician, huh?
RANDY
Won't somebody help me out?! Get someone- You, little girl! Can you please just, just check behind your ear?! [the girl reaches behind her ear and pulls out a detached penis. She screams and Randy takes it from her.] Oh, it was behind her ear. [goes back to the stage and pops it right back where it should be, hidden so the kids don't see what he's actually doing] And there we go and we're all better and I am the Amazingly Randy! Thank you! [kids are still screaming]
KINDERGARTEN BOY
I hate you!
[South Park Elementary, day. Stan recounts the events of the night before]
STAN
Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit.
KYLE
It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives.
CRAIG
Where was all this?
CARTMAN
We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit.
KYLE
Yeah, you gotta know people.
BUTTERS
Dangit, I wish I knew people.
MR. GARRISON
All right kids, before we get started, the coach of the girls' volleyball team is here and would like to say a few words. [goes to his desk as she enters]
COACH
Thank you, Mr. Garrison. Listen uh, last night we had a pretty big game against Evergreen. The girls really hammered 'em, but once again we're a... little disappointed in the turnout.
CARTMAN
Oh Jesus, give it a rest already.
BUTTERS
[chuckling] Yeah.
COACH
You know, when you put your all into something, it's kind of a bummer when people don't seem to care. [focus on Kenny, who looks down] Kind of makes you feel like the sport you love is becoming a joke.
STAN
Dude, girls' volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill.
CARTMAN
OOHHH!! [laughs with the other boys]
JIMMY
Fantastic girls' volleyball joke, Stan.
COACH
The girls wanted to say something, so we're now going to hear a few words from the captain of the girls' volleyball team.
WENDY
[gets up and goes to the front of the class. Stan is immediately stunned] Hey guys, these games coming up are really big and it would mean a lot to us if you could try and make it. Thanks. [goes back to her seat]
CARTMAN
[aside, to Stan] Dude, Wendy plays volleyball. Did you know that? I don't think you knew that.
[The girl's birthday party. SPPD show up. The father explains to Det. Harris what happened. Other officer inspects the backyard for evidence]
MAN
And then he uh, took his penis from behind our daughter's ear and uh, we uh, uh that's when we saw him with uh, the n-the three rings. and uh, his penis, he was pulling it through 'em somehow, uh.
DET. HARRIS
Uh huh. And what about the cock Magic? Where was that? [the man and wife look at each other]
MAN
Well that's what I'm telling you. It was right here exce-except for the thing where he poured the milk into his penis; he did that over there.
DET. HARRIS
Alright alright, let's focus. What kind of decks were they using?
WOMAN
Decks??
MAN
Who? There weren't any "decks."
DET. HARRIS
Oh, I get it now. Do you know what the penalty is for calling in a false cock Magic report?
WOMAN
[in tears] I'm so confused, babe.
DET. HARRIS
Who paid you to call us and take our focus away from the investigation?! What color were they?!
MAN
Nobody paid us anything! Now, there has been a crime here and you'd better do something about it!
DET. HARRIS
Agreed! Who first called 911? [moments later the woman is being taken to a squad car as the man and their daughter look on]
WOMAN
Please! Don't take me away from my child!
GIRL
[crying] Mommy!
[South Park, Saturday night. Kyle, Cartman and Kenny reach the site of the next cock Magic fight. Stan is not present]
KYLE
This is it. 1421 Plaza de Estereotipo.
CARTMAN
Wow. Here we are, McNuggets. You're reached the big time. [they stand before Panda Express. Again, Kyle knocks on the doors and tugs at them.]
MANAGER
[opens the door] Sorry, Panda Express is crosed. We crosed!
CARTMAN
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're here for the cock Magic.
MANAGER
Oh okay, come on, ten dorrah, ten dorrah.
CARTMAN
Ten dorrah?! [the boys hand over $10 each]
[Panda Express basement, moments later]
ANNOUNCER 2
For the next round, it is Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds, versus Clucky.
CARTMAN
Who is that??
SPECTATOR 1
That's Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. [Gadnuk is wearing a gold medallion] He's never lost a fight. Hell, he's never even lost one health!
[South Park Elementary gym, night. The girls are playing a visiting group, and Stan is there to watch the game. Wendy, #4 serves. #36 on the other side hits it up, with #11 hitting it back over the net. #1 on Wendy's side hits it up, then #36 hits it, then #8 hits it over the net]
STAN
[following the cock Magic fight over the phone] What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?
CARTMAN
Dude, he's like a beast! He's got more legendary creature cards than I've ever seen!
KYLE
McNuggets is scared. He doesn't wanna play.
CARTMAN
McNuggets is scared, dude!
STAN
Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!
[Wendy serves, and #58 on the other side hits it up, then #8 hits it, then #22 hits it back over the net]
SPECTATOR 2
[returns to the crowd with a dead bird] He didn't stand a chance. Not one spell cast before he was obliterated by health drains! That thing isn't human! [walks away with his rooster. Gadnuk throws down a card. The promoter walks up]
PROMOTER
Alright, your rooster's up next, boys.
KYLE
Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude.
PROMOTER
He doesn't have a choice.
CARTMAN
This isn't even a fight. This is just... a slaughter.
PROMOTER
What do you think all these people are here to see?
CARTMAN
Holy shit dude! Dude, we forfeit! We forfeit!
PROMOTER
The hell you do! Get your cock in there! [Kenny sighs and goes in instead]
[ESPN Illegal is shown on a monitor]
ESPN ANNOUNCER
You're watching ESPN Illegal, your source for bullfighting, dogfighting, and cock Magic.
ESPN HOST
And a warm welcome back to the Cock Magic Championships. Certainly an electric atmosphere here in the basement of Panda Express. The fight we were expecting, of course, Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds versus ten-month-old Cornish rooster McNuggets. In a complete shocker, the challenger McNuggets has been scratched and substituting for him is nine-year-old Kenny McCormick. Never a dull moment in the illegal sport of cock Magic. Let's rejoin the battle now as we wait for Gadnuk's sixth move. [Gadnuk ponders what to do while Kenny slowly taps his fingers on the table, waiting] Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds plays a creature card. [his assistant places it on the table]
CARTMAN
Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will have a +1 attack.
CROWD
Whooaa.
KYLE
Come on, Kenny! [Kenny takes a card from a deck and looks through his other cards]
[South Park Elementary gym, the game there continues. #11 hits it over the net to Wendy's side. #1 hits it... Stan is still following the cock Magic fights]
STAN
What did he play? Did he tap all his mana?
CARTMAN
Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health.
KYLE
He just had to shuffle it.
CARTMAN
Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an Overseer.
STAN
Does an Overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?! [meanwhile, the ball goes to #36, who hits it back over the net]
ESPN HOST
A second Elvish Mystic now, and Gadnuk attacks with Merciful Pretender. McCormick sends Charging Rhino to the graveyard. He's desperate now. Not too much he can-OH, and he's just laid down Life's Legacy!
CROWD
Ooooohh...
ESPN HOST
That was not expected! Gadnuk doesn't know what hit him! McCormick follows with Crackling Doom and Abzan Battle Priest!
KYLE
Holy shit, dude!
ESPN HOST
Gadnuk tries to block with Living Totem but OH, there is Terra Stomper! This is absolute savagery! Frenzied Goblin has been sent to the graveyard and now there is no one to block Pearl Lake Ancient! My God, someone has to put a stop to this!
DET. HARRIS
Freeze! [comes down to the basement with reinforcements. The cops draw their guns and check everyone out there. One cop pulls a gun from a spectator's jacket and throws it to the ground] Well, well! Looks like I finally caught the big boys! You're all going to jail for a long time! [looks at Kenny] Especially you, scumbag!
PROMOTER
Lousy cops! How did you find us?
DET. HARRIS
We saw your fliers. [holds one up] "Panda Express. Cock Magic at 9 pm."
PROMOTER
We didn't put those fliers out!
ANNOUNCER
[spotlights come on and move out over the crowd] And now, for your halftime entertainment, please welcome... the incomparable, the beautiful, the Amazingly Randy! [A stage is lit up and Randy bounds out]
CARTMAN
Ah, dude, your dad's here.
RANDY
[lounge voice] Thank you, hey! You know, we live in a world of brutality and violence. And some people think there's no room for wonder anymore. But just for a moment I want you to think one thing. [dances over to a stool nearby with a box sitting on it] Whatever you believe is real, is real. [pulls out a hankey, then goes back to center stage and shows there's nothing odd about it. He unzips his zipper and puts the hankey on his penis. He gets a rubber band and ties the hankey around the penis. Next he moves his hand around and his penis rises in response, as if his hands had some magnetic power to them. Suddenly, the penis takes flight and goes around several times. He holds up a large ring and the penis flies through it flawlessly. He turns around and the song "Barbie Girl" plays. He drops his pants, dances a bit, then turns around with a small curtain over his legs. The penis peaks out to the right, up, left, and then the head of René Dif appears popping out to the right]
RENÉ DIF
Come on Barbie, let's go party.
[Randy pushes it gently behind the curtain again, then he squats just long enough to get his pants back up and remove the curtain. Then he hops around. He hops back to the stool and gets some body lotion to lubricate his penis with. Then he pretends to stroke his penis and a bouquet of flowers pops up. He tosses the bouquet into the crowd and a woman catches it]
SPECTATOR 3
Ewww! [throws the bouquet away]
RANDY
Alright, for this last bit I'm gonna need a volunteer. Anybody?
DET. HARRIS
I'll volunteer.
RANDY
Alright, come on up here. [Harris goes up] What's your name?
DET. HARRIS
I'm Detective Harris, South Park Police.
RANDY
All right, a hand for Detective Harris! [applause. This provides a distraction by which some spectators leave silently] You know, if there's one thing I could leave you all with, it's this. Let cock magic be done by the professionals. [grabs a tank of liquid nitrogen] Sir? [gives it to Harris, who holds it. Drumroll. Randy takes a funnel and puts one end on his penis, then motions for Harris to pour the nitrogen into the funnel. A few seconds later, the funnel comes off to reveal a frozen penis. Randy takes a gun out and shoots it to bits. Harris is stunned. Randy walks over to him and smiles. All of a sudden, the penis comes out of Harris' mouth. Randy takes it and puts it into his pants. Harris smiles. Only four cops remain and they clap. The crowd and the other cops have left.]
[South Park Elementary, day.]
CARTMAN
It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hand that the fucking cops had to come and break it up.
BUTTERS
Wow, the cops came?
KYLE
Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened.
CARTMAN
Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan's dad shot his dick off. I just, I seriously don't know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny?
KENNY
(Yeah, I guess. I just wonder about McNuggets.)
KYLE
Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now?
STAN
Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys.
KYLE
Got what?
STAN
A way to finally do something good for other people.
[South Park Elementary gym, night. The girls volleyball team faces off against McNuggets. Wendy is about to serve when she looks at Stan, who gives her a thumbs up. Wendy shoots him a glare of disapproval over the whole idea.]
ANNOUNCER
South Park serves, and McNuggets plays a Plains Land card. One-nil, South Park. [a smattering of applause. Wendy serves again] Another serve, and McNuggets summons Downtreader Elk. One South Park player is eliminated. You, the girl with the ponytails - you are dead.

synopsis:Kyle just wants to play video games with his little brother. But, when Ike doesn't want to play with him anymore, Kyle is afraid that the next generation is passing him by.

script:REHASH

[Kyle's house, day. Kyle runs home excitedly with something in his hand. He opens the front door and goes in. Gerald spots him]
GERALD
There you are, Kyle. I was gonna see if you and your brother wanted to go down to the bowling alley.
KYLE
Nono Dad, please. I just got Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to play it together.
GERALD
It's your day off. You boys really wanna spend it inside in front of the TV?
KYLE
Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship.
GERALD
All right. [Kyle smiles, Gerald heads back to the kitchen] I swear I'll never understand you kids these days.
KYLE
Yes! [runs upstairs smiling.]
[Ike's room. Ike is at his computer eating Cheetos. Kyle knocks, then goes into the room]
KYLE
Heeey Ike! Look what I got. [Ike looks over his shoulder] The new Call Of Duty! Do you wanna go downstairs and play?
PEWDIEPIE
[on the monitor] Aww, look at all the bright colors.
IKE
...Meh. [goes back to watching the monitor and eating his Cheetos]
KYLE
Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!
IKE
Maybe later, 'kay?
KYLE
[walks up to Ike] Well what are you watching?
PEWDIEPIE
How's it goin' bros? My name's PewDiePie. I'm playing Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Here we go. [breaks through a door and is met with gunfire] Agh! People are shooting at me, bros!
KYLE
You're watching someone play Call Of Duty and talk about it?
IKE
[claps] PewDiePie!
PEWDIEPIE
There's lots of bullet! And I've gotta run! RUN FOR THE BUNKER! RUUUUN!
KYLE
Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it?
PEWDIEPIE
Alright, I hope that's enough.
IKE
Meh.
PEWDIEPIE
Uh, like I said, um... Look at this. Look at this. Ooohhh, gigrrig! [fires away at will]
[South Park Elementary Cafeteria, lunchtime]
KYLE
Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days.
BUTTERS
What's a PewDiePie do?
KYLE
Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame.
CARTMAN
He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it's lame how?
KYLE
Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!
[Commercial for an upcoming concert]
ANNOUNCER
This Saturday, at the Pepsi Center, it's Women of Rock! Miley Cyrus, Iggy Azalea, Nicki Minaj, and Lorde! [Randy] All on one stage, on one night! With a special appearance by Michael Jackson's Hologram!
MJ HOLOGRAM
Hee hee!
ANNOUNCER
Ticket proceeds help fight the gluten crisis in West Africa! It's a night of pure, pure estrogen! Tickets on sale now! [TeleChargeIt and TicketMastering info go up]
[Randy's garage, night. Randy runs inside to call someone in private]
RANDY
Yeah, it's me. I told you I can't play the concert!
RECORD PRODUCER
Come on, this is a great lineup.
RANDY
Look, I do a lot of post-production enhancements to make my music sound the way it does, okay? I feel like if I play live I'm... really gonna disappoint people. I'm sorry, but the answer is no.
RECORD PRODUCER
I don't think you're really in a position to turn down this kind of gig.
RANDY
What is that supposed to mean?
RECORD PRODUCER
I understand your son gave all your savings to Canada.
RANDY
Yes, Freemium gaming.
RECORD PRODUCER
I'm sorry. Freemium gaming destroys lives. I lost my father to Candy Crush. [Randy sighs] You need this, Lorde. And the girls out there need you. You've got till tomorrow to think it over. [hangs up. Randy ends the call]
RANDY
I love Candy Crush.
[The bus stop, day. The boys are there waiting for the bus]
KYLE
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
STAN
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
KYLE
I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary.
KENNY
(Commentary?)
KYLE
Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?! [Cartman eyes his phone with Stan and Kenny look at Kyle]
[Cartman's room, later. He's set up a YouTube channel and is now broadcasting on it]
CARTMAN
Hey bros, what's going on? This is CartmaaanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already, 'cause subscribing makes you feel good! Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty. More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start. [a recording of the earlier conversation plays]
KYLE
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
CARTMAN
That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
STAN
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
CARTMAN
[reaches for some chips and eat them, chuckles, then] Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.
KYLE
I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it.
KENNY
(Commentary?)
CARTMAN
There's Kenny commenting on Call of Duty. Kenny! Kenny! SPEAK UP!! SPEAK THROUGH THE HOOD KENNY!
KYLE
Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l-
[The Marsh house, kitchen. Sharon is washing, Randy is drying, Shelly walks in excitedly]
SHELLY
Mom, Dad, Kelly and Stacy are going to the Women of Rock concert! Can I go with them?! [anxiously waits for an answer]
SHARON
I don't know, Shelly.
SHELLY
But Mom, Lorde is playing! You can't not let me go or I'll hate you forever! [Randy and Sharon turn around]
RANDY
Shelly, there's a good chance Lorde isn't goin' to show up.
SHELLY
She will too! She has to show up, and if I don't get to see her I'm gonna kill myself!
RANDY
And what if you go and Lorde doesn't sound that great in person?
SHELLY
That doesn't matter, Dad! We love Lorde because she's real! Gosh, you guys don't understand anything!
RANDY
You know, I think Lorde is going to play tomorrow.
SHELLY
So can I go or not?!
RANDY
If she means that much to you.
SHELLY
Okay, yay, thanks, love you guys. [smiles and walks away]
SHARON
Sooo you're doing it? [smiles]
RANDY
How can I let her down? Do you mind finishing up here? I think I should practice a little.
SHARON
Of course not. [Randy walks away and out of earshot] Anything to keep you away from cock magic.
[Ike's room, later. Ike is still at his computer eating Cheetos]
CARTMAN
Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty.
KYLE
[goes into the room] Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me?
CARTMAN
More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start.
KYLE
Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching him comment on things!
KYLE
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
CARTMAN
That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
KYLE
[approaches the monitor] What the fuck?!
STAN
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
CARTMAN
[reaches for some chips and eat them, chuckles, then] Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.
KYLE
Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!
CARTMAN
God these guys are so annoying, aren't they? CartmaaanBrah!
KYLE
But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity?
IKE
CartmaaanBrah!
[The neighborhood park, basketball court, day. Cartman, Stan, and Kenny are playing a game. Cartman has the ball. Kyle runs up, angry]
KYLE
What do you think you're doing?!
CARTMAN
Shooting for a D in a game of Horsedick.
KYLE
You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!
CARTMAN
I have a YouTube blog where I comment on video games. Big whoop.
KYLE
I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything!
STAN
What are you talking about?
KYLE
This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room!
CARTMAN
Because of me?! I'm pretty sure I'm not the person who invented "Let's Plays", Kyle.
KYLE
"Let's Plays"?
CARTMAN
That's what they're called, dude. Get with the times. [turns to the basket and takes his shot. Kyle looks away and down]
[The Women of Rock concert at the Pepsi Center, night. Miley Cyrus is performing]
MILEY CYRUS
There's a party going on and it's all right here, yehhhehehah!
Throw my hands in the air while I'm twerkin' this chair
There's a party going on and it's all right here, yehhhehehah!
And I'm movin' my hands while I'm shakin' my tits.
STAGEHAND
Alright guys, uh, Miley's about to finish up her set. So next we'll need you, Nicki Minaj, then Iggy Azalea who'll be performing with a hologram of Michael Jackson, and then finally you, Lorde. [walks out of the dressing room backwards] Have a great show, ladies.
RANDY
Hey uh, listen, I, I thought I could do this, but it's not gonna work.
RECORD PRODUCER
You're nervous, it's understandable.
RANDY
No I'm eh... I know for a fact that I don't sound the same live.
RECORD PRODUCER
You think those people out there care what you sound like? You're just another female pop star. Just go out there, pump your hips and rub your clit.
RANDY
Hey! That's not what my music is about! I'm not reducing myself to that!
IGGY
Oh fuck you, Lorde! You think you're so much better than everyone!
RANDY
No, I don't, Iggy. I just think that our younger girl fans need something a little more positive as role models.
IGGY
That's easy for you to say because YOU don't have a nice body! Is that why you're so high and mighty, Lorde?! Because you're jealous of this booty?!
RANDY
Iggs, I really don't care to go through this again with you.
IGGY
'Cause let's face it! You got legs that look like a horse!
RANDY
Fuck you! [they start fighting and break through a table full of finger food and drinks]
RECORD PRODUCER
Alright that's enough! [breaks up the scuffle and separates the two artists] Look at yourselves!
IGGY
You're an internet bullshit artist, Lorde!
[Kyle's house, night. The doorbell rings and Kyle answers it. Stan comes in]
STAN
Hey, what's up?
KYLE
You're not gonna believe this.
STAN
Oh no, what now?
KYLE
I wanted to get Ike out of his room, so I invited all his friends over for a slumber party to play Dragon Age: Inquisition.
STAN
Yeah?
KYLE
Come on! [leads Stan upstairs]
[Ike's room. There are five other kids beside Ike in his room, and each one is using a tablet or a laptop, so no one is talking. Ike is watching PewDiePie on his monitor]
PEWDIEPIE
[giggling] He's just laying there.
KYLE
See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play Dragon Age.
PEWDIEPIE
I'm going "Dun dun dadadun dun dadadun."
KIDS
[in unison] PewDiePie!
KYLE
And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age.
BUTTERS
Well it's a really great game. The characters are so rich.
CARTMAN
Butters is such a butthole, oh my God! CartmaaanBrah!
KIDS
CartmanBrah!
STAN
Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!
CONNER
Okay Grandpa, we'll be sure to keep that in mind. [the kids laugh]
STAN
Grandpa?
KYLE
This is how they talk to us! [to Conner] You'd better watch your mouth, kid!
KID 1
Yeah Conner, we're supposed to respect our elders, remember?
KID 2
It's best to just make old people think they matter.
STAN
Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!
KID 2
No sir. Thank goodness we have you to do that. [Ike laughs at PewDiePie's gameplay]
STAN
We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool!
PEWDIEPIE
Oh my God I killed him!
[Back at the Pepsi Center, Iggy Azalea is performing.]
IGGY
Missy who who?
That's all I do is rip off Missy.
Missy who?
Missy who? Missy who? Missy who, who? Missy who, who?
Alright bitches and hos, via hologram and shit, Michael Jackson! [two men from the Syntech Hologram Company get ready]
TECH 1
And, cue the hologram! [a bunch of special lights come on and produce the hologram, and the hologram performs Michael's signature moves. The crowd goes wild as Michael's music plays. The hologram moonwalks like Michael did]
MJ HOLOGRAM
Hee hee. [as the crowd roars, Iggy starts twerking to the hologram]
RANDY
They shouldn't rehash dead people. It's so wrong.
NICKI
Oh Lorde, you're such a purist.
RANDY
Can't help it, Nick. Can't help feeling like... we're losing something.
[Wendy: The Wendy Williams Show, now on air. Wendy comes out in a blue dress and black jacket]
WENDY
Hi everybody. I love you!
AUDIENCE
Thanks for loving me. I love you too.
WENDY
So I guess there's this new trend with young people where the celebrities they look up to most are YouTube commentators. Just ordinary people who sit in front of a mic and blab their opinions about everything while their mindless loyal followers cheer them on. Isn't that crazy?? [the audience cheers in agreement] Well let's meet one of these stars of the internet. Please welcome CartmanBrah! [Instead of Cartman himself appearing on the couch, Cartman's commenter window pops up - he's doing this via satellite]
CARTMAN
CartmaaanBrah!
WENDY
So can you explain to our audience members over the age of five what it is that you DO?
CARTMAN
Well, Wendy, I started by talking about people talking about video games, but now I'm branching out into talking about people talking about music and the arts as well.
WENDY
And why do you think young people-?
CARTMAN
CartmaaanBrah!
WENDY
...Why do you think young people are responding to this? [Cartman mocks the question by asking it back in nonsense syllables] I'm asking you a question! [Cartman continues with the nonsense replies]
CARTMAN
CartmaaanBrah! CartmanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel, brahs.
[Back at the Pepsi Center, the MC is about to introduce Lorde. The crowd cheers loudly]
MC
And now, give it up for the girl from New Zealand, LORDE!
RANDY
Thank you! Thanks a lot! This is for all the royals out there! [begins playing an acoustic guitar. Shelly is in the audience with Kelly and Stacy] Lorde Looorde. I'm Lorde, ya ya ya-a-a. Sittin' on the toilet thinkin' 'bout how I'm not as rich as other people, ya ya ya. [the cheering dies down] Yaa ya ya ya, I'll never be, I'll never by royalty. Ya ya ya. But that'd be nice 'cause that'd be a nice fantaasy. [the mood of the audience begins to change] Women's bathrooms smell so nice, ya ya ya. Ya ya ya. [the audience begins to boo] And we'll never be- Lorde Lorde Lor- Lorde flushing- Lordy Lordy Lorde. Lor-uh, okay, uh. [turns right and the mic falls to the ground] Oh God. Sorry. [bends over to pick up the mic...] Uh hold on.[...but drops the guitar instead. The boos intensify] Hang on, uh. [to bail Lorde out of this mess, the technicians bring Michael's hologram back to the stage]
MJ HOLOGRAM
Hee hee. [the hologram runs through the audience] I'm free! I'm free!
RANDY
[dusts himself off] Sorry folks, just one second here.
[The Pepsi Center entrance. Michael's hologram runs through the metal detector and begins to dance. Security guards are hot on his tail]
MJ HOLOGRAM
Hee hee. Dah dadit dat ja!
GUARD 1
Stop him. [another guard tries to grab the hologram, but realizes it can't be done. The hologram leaves the Center. The guards run out after it, and a guard guard gets on his walkie-talkie]
GUARD 1
Michael Jackson's hologram is on the loose!
MJ HOLOGRAM
[leaving the parking area] Hee hee!
[The Pepsi Center stage. Lorde is still on stage getting booed.]
RANDY
Ah ya ya. Okay, uh. Ah ya ya ya ya-a-a-a. [the boos don't stop, and Randy's vision becomes prismatic] Okay, uh, uh... [steps aside and begins to simulate rubbing his "clit"] Oooo![hops onto the car on stage and continues the simulation] Oh yeah! Oh my clit! Oh yeah! Oooo yeah, flick that bean, yeah! [the boos are replaced by disgust. Shelly and friends are disappointed]
FAN
Ogh! Lorde, ewww!
RANDY
Oh, I'm so horny, yeah! Ooo, fuck, my clit's so big! Oooo! [fans begin to walk out of the concert]
[The Marsh house, dining room. Sharon, Randy, and Stan are having dinner]
RANDY
Could you um, pass the potatoes, Stan? [Stan reaches to his left and passes the potatoes to Randy] Great, thanks. [serves himself some potatoes] Well, nobody's talking. Does anyone have anything to talk about?
STAN
Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad?
RANDY
I was told to!
SHARON
You were told to walk out in front of a hundred thousand people including little girls who look up to you, and start rubbing your clit.
RANDY
Okay, hold on! A, I don't have a clit, so technically, I wasn't rubbing anything! And B, I didn't want to even perform tonight, but Stanley gave all our money to Canada through a freemium game, so if anyone rubbed their clit, it was him! [Stan hisses and leaves the table. Sharon just leaves. Some time later, Randy drops in on Shelly in her room and sees her crying on her bed, face down. He then notices that the Lorde poster on the wall is in tatters and ripped in half. Randy leaves and closes the door softly]
[Kyle's house, day. Kyle walks around a darkened living room, rubbing his left hand along the coffee table, then along the TV, and he finds them dusty]
KYLE
It's dying. The living room is... dying.
[Randy's garage, night. Randy enters to talk to the record producer on the phone in private]
RANDY
Yeah, it's me. I need to fix this. How can I undo the clit-rubbing?
RECORD PRODUCER
What are you talking about? It's great! You're the most commented-on artist in the world right now! You're blowing up twitter and you're trending on CartmanBrah. #clitnubbin
RANDY
Look, this isn't what I want! My music is supposed to be-
RECORD PRODUCER
It's not about the music, Lorde! It never was. It's about comments! And sister, you've got 'em!
RANDY
This ends now. I'm gonna tell people the truth.
[The Rockies, day. A South Park City Transit bus is going to town, and Michael's hologram is in it. Everyone is on their iPhones or iPads]
PASSENGER
Will you look at that? Everyone on their cell phones, nobody sayin' a word to each other. Call me a grandpa, but I still like commenting face to face with folks. You know what I mean, buddy?
MJ HOLOGRAM
Yes.
PASSENGER
You're headin' up to the mountains too, huh? Gonna do some skiin'?
MJ HOLOGRAM
No, I just need to... take care of some im-, important business.
PASSENGER
Oh, what kind of business? Oh are you a fisherman?
MJ HOLOGRAM
Yes. I mean, yes, that's all. I'm, I'm just gonna fish and hunt.
PASSENGER
Oh, you're a hunter? What do you prey upon?
MJ HOLOGRAM
[stands up] Nobody! That's ignorant!
PASSENGER
Well, you must have a favorite kind of prey?
MJ HOLOGRAM
Allegedly! Allegedly! That's ignorant!
PASSENGER
You know, excuse me for saying so, but you seem kind of... transparent.
MJ HOLOGRAM
...That's ignorant. I'm just cold.
PASSENGER
I'm saying it must make it easier to sneak up on your prey.
MJ HOLOGRAM
Allegedly! I'm weary of this conversation! Can we please stop talking, please?! Ignorant!
PASSENGER
[looks him over] Well, whatever it is you're after, I hope you get it.
MJ HOLOGRAM
Oh I will. Trust me, I will. [The bus enters South Park.]
[The Syntech Hologram Company, day. The record producer is with the tech working on the hologram problem]
TECH 2
Ah, we've lost any ability to track the hologram's location. Ih...it looks like it reprogrammed its guidance systems.
RECORD PRODUCER
We paid a lot of money for that hologram. You'd better find a way to get it back!
TECH 3
Project Alpha?
TECH 4
Yes. That might be our only option.
RECORD PRODUCER
What is Project Alpha?
TECH 4
The first hologram we ever created to appear on stage. It was a prototype. But perhaps the best thing to stop a hologram-
TECH 3
Is another hologram. Bring up Project Alpha!
TECH 2
Sir, are you sure that we wanna-?
TECH 3
Bring it up! [Tech 2 gets to work. Everyone turns around and watches as the hologram is assembled]
RECORD PRODUCER
What is that?
TECH 3
Tupac.
TECH 4
[approaches the hologram] Tupac? [the hologram is activated] Yo. The hologram of Michael Jackson is on the loose. We need you to "take care of the situation." [the hologram takes out a Glock hologram and cocks it, then he walks forward, then turns left and walks out]
TECH 3
Godspeed, Tupac.
[The Syntech Hologram Company, outside. Tupac crosses the street and a car almost runs him down. The couple inside is in shock]
MAN
Oh my gosh, honey look it's Tupac! I told you them homies didn't cap his ass! [Tupac opens the driver's door, pulls the driver out and throws him to the ground, then gets into the driver's seat and takes off with the car and driver's wife. The driver gets up and pulls out his phone] Oh, this is going on Instagram! [takes the picture]
[The bus stop, day. Cartman's commenter window is there in his place]
CARTMAN
Hey hey, how's it going, bros? This is CartmanBrah. CartmaaanBrah. And uhh, we are, it looks like we are at the bus stop now. [the other three boys walk into view] Yep, there's Kyle, Stan and Kenny looking stupid as ever.
KYLE
I don't know what the hell to do. The whole world's gone crazy.
STAN
Tell me about it.
CARTMAN
Uh oh, it looks like Kyle is taking issue with something again. Kyle's got a pro-blem. CartmanBrah!
KYLE
You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV.
CARTMAN
[exasperated] Oh God.
KYLE
[notices the commenter window above the bus stop sign] Do you mind?!
CARTMAN
Oh, looks like Kyle is commenting on my commenter window, bras! Be sure to comment on that. #kyleisgettingfrustrated
KYLE
Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!
CARTMAN
Oh really. Ten thousand subscribers and counting, brah!
[Buca de Faggoncini, day. Randy goes inside. The record producer is waiting for him at a table. Randy approaches, but doesn't sit down.]
RANDY
Thanks for seeing me. I've got my speech written. I'm ready to let the world know the truth. [the producer puts down his fork and wipes his lips off with a napkin.]
RECORD PRODUCER
Sit down, Lorde.
RANDY
I'm not interested in being talked out of ending this. It's the right thing to do.
RECORD PRODUCER
[stands up and walks to a nearby bar] Do you know what an artist is now, Lorde? An artist is a conversation piece, nothing more. [pours himself a drink] Like a vase, or a kitschy side table. Just something for people to comment on. [turns around] The old ways are dying. We're not making money off records, we're making money off tweets. And you've taken it to a whole new level.
RANDY
Well that's not a world Lorde ever wanted to be a part of.
RECORD PRODUCER
On the contrary. Lorde is going on the Jimmy Fallon show tonight and exposing her asshole for everyone to freak out about.
RANDY
I'll do no such thing!
RECORD PRODUCER
Who said anything about you? [whips out a small remote control and presses a button on it. Some lasers turn on and assemble a new hologram. It's Lorde's hologram. It walks up to the producer and stands beside him. Randy is frightened and takes several steps back. Two bodyguards appear behind him, and he notices. The producer closes the blinds]
RANDY
You can't just replace artists with holograms. Who will make the content?
RECORD PRODUCER
Today, commentary IS the content. And you, I'm afraid, are just in the way. [the bodyguards quickly escort him out]
[South Park Elementary, day. Mr. Garrison wipes off the previous night's work from the blackboard.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay children, let's take our seats. Before we get started, Kyle has asked to say a few words. Go ahead, Kyle.
KYLE
[walks up to the front of the class and turns around. He reads from a sheet of paper] What is happening to our living rooms? There is a crisis in America, and-
CARTMAN
[his commenter window pops up] Looks like we're in the school now. Check out Wendy, she's flat as a pancake.
MR. GARRISON
What the hell is that?
KYLE
It's Cartman's stupid online persona!
CARTMAN
Oh my dick's gettin hard again! It's protrudin' out my paaaaants!
MR. GARRISON
What the hell?
CARTMAN
This is the way of the future, Mr. Garrison.
BUTTERS
It's true!
CARTMAN
Heh that's right, Butters will back me up on anything. He's such a bitch.
BUTTERS
Heheyehah.
KYLE
There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart-
CARTMAN
[mocking] There is a crisis in America. and we have to save our living rooms. Our living rooms are dying.
KYLE
Mr. Garrison, will you make him stop!
MR. GARRISON
I don't- I don't even understand what's happening.
KYLE
THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!
CARTMAN
[mocking] This is the reason why our living rooms are dying, so we've got to do something.
MR. MACKEY
Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office, please? Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office!
CARTMAN
What the hell did I do?
[Principal Victoria's office, later.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Eric, I've had a lot of complaints that your online persona is becoming a distraction.
CARTMAN
Well this sucks. Looks like I'm in the principal's office for just commenting on things.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Eric, I am talking to YOU!
CARTMAN
Adults so don't get what's cool anymore.
[The Marsh house. Randy rushes in through the front door]
RANDY
Sharon? Sharon!
SHARON
[comes down the stairs in her bath robe] Randy? What's going on?
RANDY
They made a hologram of me, Sharon! They don't care about the music! They're REPLACING us!
SHARON
Oh my God! You mean, I just slept with a hologram?
RANDY
The hologram's in our bedroom?
SHARON
Yes!
TUPAC'S HOLOGRAM
I've gotta be leavin' now, Sharon. I would leave you my number but I'm just a hologram 'n shit.
RANDY
You slept with Tupac?! SHARON!
[The record producer's limousine, back seat. Cartman's commenter window is there with the record producer]
RECORD PRODUCER
It's a brave new world, starting much sooner than we thought. What we need is someone who truly gets the changing of the guard. We have an army of holograms poised to start the next chapter in American culture. How would you like to be in charge of it all?
CARTMAN
[in his commenter window] Ohohoh, totally, brah! So sweet. Being in charge of stuff rules! CartmaaanBrah!
RECORD PRODUCER
Glad you feel that way. We have a lot to do together. We're about to take this to a whole new level.
CARTMAN
Ooohh, I love whole new levels! This is gonna be so totally awesome! CartmaaanBrah!

synopsis:Cartmaan Bra is trending as the country prepares to watch the biggest Holiday Spectacular ever.

script:HappyHolograms

[Kyle's house, a snowy day. He's preparing for Hanukkah, setting up the menorah with nine candles. He's lit the second candle, for the second day of Hanukkah, then takes a selfie of himself and the menorah]
KYLE
It's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending.
Because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.

[leaves the menorah and stops by Ike's room, and looks in]

This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:
What's trending to them is trenders who trend on YouTube.

[Ike is watching "Dragon Age: Inquisition" on his computer while eating Flamin' Hot Cheetos]
CARTMAN
[his commenter window pops up on screen] Ahem, how's it going brahs? This is CartmaaanBrah!
KYLE
Comments on commentators, it's all changing so fast.
Playing XBox with your brother is... just a thing of the past.

[Kyle looks at the floor, turns back and walks away. he stops by the kitchen, then by his dad's study. Gerald takes a selfie with his pet project: a model of a ship]

Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying,
All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying.

[he walks through the living room, then stops and looks around]

Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski,
[he looks at the TV and walks up to it]

What brought families together most was a good old TV
[he walks through the park with his head down]

Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw.
[he sees a little girl on a bench looking at her iPhone]

And if you try to complain, you get called a-
GIRL
Grandpa!
KYLE
I'm NOT a GRANDPA!
KYLE
[Now at his own desk]
But now let me tweet this for you all to comment upon.
[The following is the tweet]

The more connected we get, the more alone we become.
If you want change like I do, and feel the same gloom,
Then please follow THIS trend, #savethelivingroom

[finishes the tweet but doesn't submit it yet. He's wearing a tee shirt with #savethelivingroom on it]
KYLE
Whattaya think?
BUTTERS
Hmmm, it's kind of gay.
KYLE
Really??
BUTTERS
I mean, havin' it all rhyme 'n stuff, you know?
KYLE
Hm, I wasn't really going for "gay," I was more going for "wholesome."
BUTTERS
Well, gay is wholesome.
KYLE
But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values.
SHEILA
[knocks, then enters] Kyle, Bill Cosby is here to see you.
KYLE
Bill Cosby.
SHEILA
Yes.
KYLE
Is here. To see me.
SHEILA
Yes. [turns around and leaves]
[The living room, moments later. Kyle and Butters come downstairs and see Bill]
BILL COSBY
Oh! There he is comin' down the stairs.
KYLE
Hello.
BILL COSBY
Hello, son. Your savethelivingroom hash tag is getting a lot of attention and we think it's great.
KYLE
We?
BILL COSBY
I'm just a small part of a big epic holiday special, which is gonna air this weekend. [notices how dusty the TV is and wipes some of the dust off with his right hand] It's a shame how families don't gather in their living rooms like they used to, and we think a big holiday special is just the thing America needs now.
KYLE
Wow. [smiles] Well that's awesome!
BILL COSBY
Well the producers of the show saw how much your idea was trending and thought we should get your hash-tag on board with ours.
KYLE
M-Ah, I'd love to.
BILL COSBY
Great! I'll go right now and tell them you're on board. We've gotta do this quickly!
KYLE
Uh okay! No problem! [Bill lets himself out]
BILL COSBY
This holiday special is gonna bring families together again, son!
KYLE
Uh thanks, Mr. Cosby!
BILL COSBY
Happy Holidays! [Kyle closes the door, and Bill's glitch appears as he walks away - this Bill is a hologram]
[Park County Police Station. Detective Harries is grilling Randy and Sharon on their story.]
DET. HARRIS
Mr. Marsh, forgive me if I say your story sounds a little farfetched. You're saying that these people who what you killed are entertainment producers?
RANDY
Yes, they made a copy of me and they don't want me around anymore. They're about to do something big, and they need famous artists to be controlled for it.
OFFICER 1
[with mustache] Who's the famous artist?
RANDY
Me! Oh right, I forgot to tell you that part. I'm actually Lorde.
DET. HARRIS
You're Lorde.
SHARON
The nineteen year old pop star. It's true, that's him.
OFFICER 1
You mean the girl who just showed her asshole on Jimmy Fallon?
RANDY
No! That was a copy of me!
OFFICER 2
Right. The thing that I jacked off to was you! Huh! [bemused smile which quickly fades.]
RANDY
Look, I don't know what they're up to, but these people have something much darker planned!
OFFICER 3
[runs into the station] Detective Harris! Sir! We've got a problem!
DET. HARRIS
[turns around] What is it, Adams?
ADAMS
[Officer 3] We've arrested a black man who was snooping around the old Jefferson estate!
DET. HARRIS
Did you choke him?
ADAMS
Yes!
DET. HARRIS
Did you shoot him?
ADAMS
YES!
DET. HARRIS
So what's the problem?
ADAMS
He... appears to be just a hologram, sir.
MJ'S HOLOGRAM
[brought in by another officer, somehow handcuffed] Naw, it's ignorant! You don't understand! We have to stop them! Heee hee!
DET. HARRIS
Oh my God. Are you sure that hologram is black??
[Stan's house, day. The doorbell rings and he answers it. It's Kyle.]
KYLE
[excitedly] Dude, what are you doing?!
STAN
[texting] Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store.
KYLE
They picked up my hash tag, Stan! I'm trending!
STAN
Who did?
KYLE
These producers making a big holiday special! [goes to the TV and wipes it clean] They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it!
STAN
That's a little strange, isn't it?
KYLE
No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now!
[The commercial begins]
ANNOUNCER
From the producers of Women Of Rock Live and The Rockefeller Tree Lighting Ceremony, it's the holiday television event of the season! With appearances by [the guest stars are shown as they're mentioned] Al Pacino [on a sled going down a hill] Iggy Azalea [wearing a black and white outfit, with her ass dressed up as a snowman] J.J. Watt [clutching a reindeer] Miley Cyrus [dressed as an elf, swinging from a huge Christmas ornament and sticking her tongue out] U2 [presenting gifts] Angelina Jolie [dressed as an elf and scratching her crotch] Bill Cosby and Taylor Swift [he offers her a drink, she declines it] A hologram of Elvis Presley [a National Enquire tabloid drops down to reveal him, then a bigfoot appears behind him] Kurt Cobain's hologram [pops up from a chimney and waves hello with his hat] The hologram of Robin Williams [wearing reindeer horns and festive clothes, pops his clown nose off] Tom Hanks, Lorde [he holds up a mistletoe as her hologram turns around] First Lady Michelle Obama [licks a huge candy cane] And Michael Jackson's hologram as Peter Pan.
MJ'S HOLOGRAM
[flits through the air] I'm flying! Hee dah dada dat dih
ANNOUNCER
And featuring live commentary the entire show by CartmanBrah.
CARTMAN
CartmaaanBrah! Dude, check it out. Lady Gaga is singing Christmas songs. Isn't she a Jew?
ANNOUNCER
There's something for every generation to bring families together.
KYLE
Please, tune in and help get America's families back in the living room.
CARTMAN
He's such a douchebag.
ANNOUNCER
It's all live and it's all magical. It's the Washington Redskins Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special.
CARTMAN
Now we're talkin'! [the commenter window disappears and Stan and Kyle are stunned]
KYLE
That son of a bitch!
STAN
That self-promoting asshole!
KYLE
Why would he do this?!
STAN
Because my dad's an idiot!
KYLE
Not your dad, Cartman! What's your dad got to do with this?!
STAN
Nnnothing, nothing.
[The record producer's office, day. CartmanBrah is there with the other executives in the office]
CARTMAN
Ehey hey, how's it going bros? This is CartmaaanBrah! And it looks like we're in the producer's office in Los Angeles now. [eats some chips]
EXEC. 1
So far the holiday special is trending fine, but it appears that the Michael Jackson hologram is the most heavily tweeted.
RECORD PRODUCER
And we still have no idea where the damned hologram is?
RON
Not yet, but Tupac is close to hunting him down.
CARTMAN
Look at that guy. He's like 40, but he's got a Justin Bieber haircut.
RECORD PRODUCER
We got one shot at this, people! This [pounds his fist on the table] has to be the holiday special to end all holiday specials!
RON
Sir, I get that you brought this YouTube commentator in because he's popular with the younger kids, but now he's trying to tell us what the show should be called??
RECORD PRODUCER
He's got his finger on the pulse of young America.
EXEC. 2
Sir, I'm pretty sure that [reads from his phone] "Washington Redskins Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special" is not a good name.
CARTMAN
No, it's not good, it's fuckin' awesome!
RON
[leans in] If I may be frank, sir, I think you're giving this kid a little too much power!
CARTMAN
I can hear you, douchebag.
RECORD PRODUCER
People, you know what we're trying to do here. [leaves his desk and paces the room] We're trying to finally create entertainment that reaches the younger generation, that unites the young with the old. That means being hip, being now.
CARTMAN
These guys are such blumpkin catchers.
RECORD PRODUCER
There, you see that? "Blumpkin catchers." Do any of you even know what that means? This kid is our way to connect with the youth of America, and I'm gonna give him all the power he needs.
CARTMAN
G'dang g'dang! G'dang g'dang g'dank!
[Park County Police Station. Harris goes over skin color with the other cops and some color swatches. Randy, Sharon, and MJ's hologram are at the far end of the office space]
OFFICER 4
What about this, sir? Burnt sienna?
DET. HARRIS
He's not a Native American, damnit! That's obvious!
OFFICER 1
I'll, I'll put it in the report he's Mylar brown.
DET. HARRIS
That isn't even close! We have to be able to prove that hologram is a light-skinned black guy!
RANDY
Mr. Jackson, it's me, Lorde.
MJ'S HOLOGRAM
Who? Lorde? You're not Lorde, that's ignorant.
RANDY
Please. Do you know what's going on here? What are the producers trying to do?
MJ'S HOLOGRAM
They're gonna make a big holiday special. They've got holograms and YouTube commentators and live tweeting and it's ignorant! It's gonna be the most ignorant holiday special ever!
RANDY
A holiday special. Oh my God.
MJ'S HOLOGRAM
It's directed at children! We have to stop them!
OFFICER 4
Huh how about we say he's mixed race?
DET. HARRIS
As long as Adams only choked the black half, I think it's okay.
RANDY
[to Sharon] I should have known. Bastards always talked about a day when social media and entertainment would be fused as one! I didn't know they meant a Christmas special! [to MJ's hologram] Can you help me stop them?!
MJ'S HOLOGRAM
Yes. We have to reach the children. It's our only hope.
RANDY
Then we'll do it together. I love children just as much as you do.
MJ'S HOLOGRAM
[stands up] ALLEGEDLY! [the officers look at him] THAT WAS A CIVIL SUIT AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE! [sits down] It's ignorant.
[Kyle's house. He stops by the kitchen with Stan as Sheila reads her iPad]
KYLE
Mom?! Where is Ike?!
SHEILA
Oh Kyle! Your hash tag is really trending. I saw the commercial.
KYLE
That's not what I was trending! They took my hash tag and they raped it! Where is Ike?!
SHEILA
He's upstairs playing with all his friends.
[Ike's room. Kyle and Stan rush inside]
PEWDIEPIE
Oh my God, that's the ugliest...
KYLE
Ike! You are no longer to watch that stupid little YouTube blogging asshole! Do you understand?! You damn kids following these YouTube commentators is bad enough, but i will not have them invading my living room!
KID 2
Old people are so funny.
CONNER
They really just don't get it.
KID 3
And they smell like soap.
STAN
We're not old people! You guys are just into lame, vulgar crap, and it needs to be stopped!
KID 4
Careful Grandpa, you might crap your Depends! [the kids laugh, even Ike]
KYLE
WE'RE NOT BEING GRANDPAS!
STAN
Yeah, you damn kids!
PEWDIEPIE
...that's the lamest...
[Park County Police Station, upstairs. The officers still haven't come to a conclusion about MJ's hologram]
DET. HARRIS
Okay, okay, so we're agreeing the hologram is black. So the question is, if he's black, then how come we couldn't choke him?
[Park County Police Station, front office. A police officer stands behind the front desk. The doors open and in walks Tupac's hologram]
FRONT DESK OFFICER
Can I help you? [the hologram looks at him and moves away] Eh-excuse me. Can I help you? [the hologram moves deeper into the building. A security camera shows him walking down a hallway. The front desk officer runs into the office] Sir? A black guy walked into the police station!
DET. HARRIS
Heh, uh huh? [looks at the officer and grins]
FRONT DESK OFFICER
Well a, a black guy walked into the police station.
DET. HARRIS
[chuckling, anticipating a joke] Yeah? Wait. Mitchell, listen to this one. [Mitchell appears in the background] Start over: what's the setup?
FRONT DESK OFFICER
There's this black guy, walked into the police station.
MITCHELL
Oh yeah, I think I've heard it, but go ahead.
FRONT DESK OFFICER
No, really, a black guy walked into the-!
MITCHELL
Ohhh ya ya ya? "We set who free?"
FRONT DESK OFFICER
No no, a black guy literally walked into the police station!
DET. HARRIS
Oh, it's a new one. [Tupac's hologram walks in] Aw, shit! Look out! [the officers quickly draw their weapons]
OFFICER 4
It's a black guy! Choke him!
DET. HARRIS
Shoot him!
OFFICER 4
Shoot him and then choke him! [the front desk officer shoots the hologram, but the bullet just goes through and disrupts the hologram's structural integrity. The officer tries to choke the hologram, but the arms just go through it]
MJ'S HOLOGRAM
He's here to kill us! Run!! Heee heee! [they escape while the officers shoot at Tupac's hologram. They go down the fire escape unnoticed]
[Cartman's house. Kyle and Stan walk up to his room. Kyle tries to open the door, but finds it locked. He then pounds on the door]
KYLE
Cartman, open this door right now!
CARTMAN
[his commenter window pops up] Hahaha, look at kyle, brahs. he's all pissed off. CartmaanBrah!
KYLE
What the hell are you doing?!
CARTMAN
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm trending, Kyle. I'm trending more than I ecer thought possible.
KYLE
Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door!
CARTMAN
How do you even know I'm here in my room?
KYLE
Because you just said, "here in my room"!
CARTMAN
...Very impressive, Kyle. But the holiday special is beginning soon. I'm afraid I can't let there be any distractions. [Kyle tries breaking his way into the room] You will find that my door has been sealed with a 3/4 inch plywood and a polymer-metal alloy secured with drewall screws. [Kyle stops]
STAN
Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere!
CARTMAN
Why does that matter?
STAN
Because Lorde is my dad, alright?! [walks forward as his anger drains away] Lorde is my dad.
CARTMAN
What?
KYLE
What are you talking about, Stan?
STAN
He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care.
CARTMAN
Sorry guys, I gotta go. The world needs CartmanBrah. [the commenter window disappears]
KYLE
Why didn't you tell me, Stam? I would've helped.
STAN
It just all seemed so... stupid.
KYLE
I'll call the producers of the show. They'll help you find your dad.
[Meanwhile, at the Marsh house. Randy, Sharon, and MJ's hologram enter the house and sit on the sofa]
SHARON
See if it started!
RANDY
We don't really use this thing anymore. [grabs the remote and turns on the TV] It hasn't started yet! Alright, Sharon, get on your computer upstairs! Mr. Jackson, you can take the one in my son's room! We've got to tell people the truth!
SHARON
[puts her hand on Randy's shoulder] Randy, what about Shelly?
RANDY
Oh my God...
MJ'S HOLOGRAM
Shelly? Who's Shelly? That's ignorant.
RANDY
My daughter... She has no idea that I'm Lorde... I can't let her find out from the Internet. I have to tell her the truth before we all tell the world.
SHARON
How are you going to tell her that the singer she's idolized has been you?
RANDY
I guess... one step at a time.
[Shelly's room, moments later. Randy knocks on her door, then looks in. Shelly is looking at her monitor]
RANDY
Shelly? Um, I'm Lorde. [she sits up a little] All the music you've really been into has been me. Nobody in the family knew except for your mother. And your brother, and your grandpa. But Michael Jackson's hologram is here and we're going to set the record straight, Okay? Love you. [blows her a kiss and closes the door, then to Michael's hologram]Whew, that was hard.
SHARON
RANDY?! [Randy and Michael's hologram head downstairs]
[The living room. The men reach the foot of the stairs]
SHARON
It's started.
ANNOUNCER
And now, Nabisco and Dolly Madison present, The Washington Redskins Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special! [CartmanBrah appears in a window at upper left of the screen]
And now, live via hologram, it's Kurt Cobain. [he appears in a Christmas fireplace setting]
CARTMAN
Oh, this should be good.
KURT'S HOLOGRAM
[begins to sing]
Up on the housetop, reindeer pause out jumps good ole Santa Claus
CARTMAN
I'm sure this is exactly how Kurt Cobain would want to be remembered.
KURT'S HOLOGRAM
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones, girls and boys [reaches to his left for a double-barreled shotgun and waves it around as if marching]
Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go
Yeh-he-he-eah who wouldn't go [loads and cocks the shotgun]
Up on the housetop clickity click click [aims it at his mouth as if to shoot himself]
Down through the chimney with good St. Nick? [waves it around again, then stops]
CARTMAN
Hoh, this should get some comments. [Kurt's hologram fires the rifle and a small flag saying "Merry Christmas" pops out. He grins]
[The control room. Ron is in charge]
RON
Stand by on camera 4. Boost the live Twitter feed. Aaand cue the hash tag! How are we trending?
CONTROLLER 1
Trending at 64% and steady.
RON
[on the phone with the producer] We're trending at 64%, sir.
[Buca de Faggoncini. The record producer is having dinner]
RECORD PRODUCER
Excellent. I'm just about to deal with our last order of business now.
KYLE
[walks into the restaurant and towards the producer with Stan] Thanks for seeing us, sir. My friend is really worried about his dad.
RECORD PRODUCER
No no, thank you! [wipes his lips clean] If you hadn't called, I... wouldn't know what I know now. [gets up and walks towards the bar, dialing a number in the process]
STAN
Um, l-look ih if I could just talk to him real quick? I wanna try and stop him from making an ass of himself again.
RECORD PRODUCER
It's me. I've got somethin' you might be interested in.
RANDY
[on the line in the master bedroom] I don't think so, you son of a bitch! [Sharon and Michael's hologram are also there]
RECORD PRODUCER
I've got your son here, Lorde. If you don't cooperate, he dies.
STAN
What?? [both he and Kyle are scared]
RANDY
Stanley?! YOU LEAVE HIM OUT OF THIS!
[The living room. Randy runs downstairs with Sharon following]
SHARON
Randy, where are you going?!
RANDY
THEY'VE GOT STAN! JUST STAY HERE WITH MICHAEL JACKSON! [just as he reaches the front door, it opens and Tupac's hologram walks in] SHIT!! [runs to the back door.]
[Out front, at least 14 police cruisers and one tank roll up to the house. Some of them drift into position. Officers jump out of the cars and arm themselves.]
DET. HARRIS
[on his bullhorn] All right, listen up! We believe this is where the black people are! They're holograms, so we can't choke them or shoot them, so stand by till we figure out what the hell to do!
OFFICER 5
[runs up] Sir! You'd better see this! [holds out a phone, which Detective Harris looks at] There's something new trending! #copscantgoaroundchokingblackpeople.
DET. HARRIS
We know we can't, but we're trying to! Jesus, tell them we're working on it!
OFFICER 6
No, sir, I I think they mean we shouldn't. Like we're racist or something.
DET. HARRIS
What?! We're not racists.
PETERSON
Sir, we've got confirmation. There's two black guys in the upstairs of the house!
DET. HARRIS
[turns around anticipating another joke] Uh huh, go ahead.
PETERSON
Two black guys. One of them is threatening the other one.
DET. HARRIS
Yehah? Hang on! Mitch! [Mitchell appears again] Two black guys in the upstairs of the house. One of them is threatening the other one. [to Peterson] Okay, go ahead.
[Back at the holiday special]
ANNOUNCER
And now, together at last, Iggy Azalea and Elvis. [Elvis' hologram is playing the ukulele]
CARTMAN
Oh bros, weak!
ELVIS' HOLOGRAM

IGGY'S ASS

ELVIS' HOLOGRAM
I don't know if there'll be snow

Pfffffffft
CARTMAN
Oh weak, bros, so weak!
[Back at the control room. Ron has his back to the monitors]
CONTROLLER 2
It's incredible! I've never seen trending like this!
RON
[turns around] We're trending well?
CONTROLLER 1
We're barely trending at all. But #ihatecartmanbrah is trending off the charts!
CONTROLLER 2
He's right. ihatecartmanbrah is trending at 96% and climbing.
RON
That's impossible.
[Back at Buca de Faggoncini, the record producer pours himself another drink]
KYLE
How can you be willing to kill people for a holiday special? What's wrong with you?
RECORD PRODUCER
It was five years ago that I... became a grandpa. At first it was wonderful. I wanted to show my grandson everything. Teach him all about the entertainment business. One day I aasked him, "Who's your favorite celebrity?" You know what he said to me? He said, "PeewwDiePie." I had no idea who [turns around] he was talking about. So I looked it up. And he was this insignificant little game blogger from Sweden who my grandson thought was a god! No matter who else I tried to impress him with, he would just say, "Meh." To me! MEH! [turns back to the bar] What the hell is wrong with these kids today?? With this special, we will assimilate this generation's culture into ours! MAKE THEM APPRECIATE REAL ENTERTAINMENT, DAMNIT! [pounds theh bar with his fist]
STAN
Dude. You're such a grandpa.
RECORD PRODUCER
[angrily clears everything off the bar] I AM NOT A GRANDPAAA!
[Back at the holiday special, it's Bill Cosby and Taylor Swift in the second duet]
TAYLOR
Well I guess it's time to leave.
BILL'S HOLOGRAM
Oh but it's snowin' out dere.
TAYLOR
Yeah but I need to get home.
BILL'S HOLOGRAM
But it's snowin' out dere.
TAYLOR
I really should go
BILL'S HOLOGRAM
Oh what's the hurry?
TAYLOR
Say, what's in this drink?'
BILL'S HOLOGRAM
That's just some J-E-L-L-O.
TAYLOR
The holidays are comin'-
DAD
This is the oddest holiday special I've ever seen.
MOM
Maybe we should turn it off.
CARTMAN
[his commenter window appears] Oh wow, where are we now, brahs? [the family looks at him] This looks pretty stupid.
DAD
What the heck? [tries to turn the TV off, but it won't turn off]
CARTMAN
CartmaanBrah!
DAD
[smacks the remote on his left hand a few times] This damn TV! What is that window doing outside the holiday special?! [tries turning the TV off again]
MOM
Call customer service.
[Customer service, Steve answering]
STEVE
Panasonic customer service. How can I help you?
DAD
Yeah, we've got a commenter window in our living room. How do I get rid of that?
STEVE
Ohhhh yes yes yes yes. Many people are calling about this. We have NO idea what's going on. Have I answered all your questions in a timely manner?
CARTMAN
[his commenter window appears] Oho, looks like we've reached customer service, brahs. Now we can truly be everywhere!
[The holiday special control room]
RON
This isn't part of the holiday special! What is he doing?!
CONTROLLER 2
He's trending more than we ever thought possible.!
CARTMAN
[his commenter window appears] Yes, with every passing second I become more powerful.
[Stan's house, out front. The cops are laughing their asses off now]
DET. HARRIS
[laughing with them] Okay! Okay, okay okay okay. Go ahead.
PETERSON
So, then, the first black guy said to the second black guy, "Don't shoot me. I'm on your side."
DET. HARRIS
Okay! Okay. Okay. Hold on. [catches his breath] Okay, go ahead.
PETERSON
And then the, the the tattooed black guy said, to him, "I ain't gonna kill you, man. You're the King of Pop. Let's go cap that whitey producer."
DET. HARRIS
Oh God! Stop! Stop! Stop!
CARTMAN
[his commenter window appears] Happy holidays, everyone! [the cops stop laughing and look at the window] Enjoy the rest of your lives with CartmanBrah.
[Buca de Faggoncini. Cartman's commenter window is now a fixture]
RECORD PRODUCER
Damn it, you're ruining the show!
CARTMAN
Of course I am. This isn't about you. This is about CartmanBrah, brah.
KYLE
I am so confused.
RECORD PRODUCER
[to Ron] Shut him down!
RON
We can't, sir!
CARTMAN
I am trending so much that soon I will reach... trendscendence. Like Johnny Depp, but cool.
STEPHEN
I'm confused. Why this holiday special and what is it?
CARTMAN
It's all CartmanBrah now. [a shot of Times Square. Cartman's image replaces everything else on the screens there] I am trending into something more than human. I am becoming... transgender. [a shot of the Times Square crowd, looking at the screens in disbelief] Now they will HAVE to give my my own bathroom!
RECORD PRODUCER
This is not what I hired you for! I CONTROL TALENT, DAMNIT!
MJ'S HOLOGRAM
[bursts through the doors with Tupac's hologram] There he is! That's the ignorant man!
RECORD PRODUCER
This is crazy and everyone is watching everything!
KYLE
[thinking aloud] Everyone is watching everything. [turns right and walks up to a camera] Ike? [switch to Ike's room] Ike, if you can hear me, I'm sorry. I have been a grandpa. [Ike's friends look at the monitor] I didn't understand the things you are into and I and I thought you should like the same stuff that I did. [Michael's hologram walks up to the record producer and shoots him in the head, killing him] I have to accept that you're gonna have your own things. I just didn't want you to watch HIM. I just... I just wanna be a family again.
KID 4
Oh, I feel bad for the little guy.
CONNER
There's nothing sadder than a old man crying.
KID 3
Maybe we should help
IKE
Yeah!
KID 2
Okay.
KYLE
Help? How can you help?
KID 2
It's the holiday season. We just need to get everyone to believe again.
CONNER
Yeah, someone can come change all this. You know who.
KYLE
Really? That's what you guys would do?
CONNER
Of course! We just need to get everyone to believe in him. He'll always come and help. #webelieveinyou
KYLE
Oh my God, you're right! You're totally right!! EVERYONE! GET A NEW TREND GOING! FAST! #webelieveinyou!
MJ'S HOLOGRAM
We believe in you. Of course!
KYLE
[walks ever closer to the camera] You too! Right now! #webelieveinyou! We've got to make him appear! [the signal is now disrupted]
CARTMAN
Hey! What's going on? What is that? [amid some special effects of snow and holly popping out of the upper right corner of screens everywhere, PewDiePie's commenter window appears]
PEWDIEPIE
How's it goin' bros? This is [goes fullscreen]PewDiePie!
CARTMAN
What the hell?!
KIDS
PewDiePie!
KYLE
PewDiePie?!
PEWDIEPIE
Thanks for all the shoutouts. I guess there's some little fat kid trying to be me, so let's check it out.
CARTMAN
Ey! Get out of here, PewDiePie! This is MY holiday special!
PEWDIEPIE
[mocking Cartman] God damn it, get out of here!
CARTMAN
Uh, everyone, tweet now if you wanna get rid of PewDiePie!
PEWDIEPIE
This show is getting kind of boring, bros. What do you say we change it out to something more exciting?
CARTMAN
Please show your support for CartmanBrah brah right now by uh...
PEWDIEPIE
I know! Let's play Call of Duty! [the game pops up fullscreen and the commenter windows switch places]
CARTMAN
No! You can't do this!
PEWDIEPIE
Ohhh yeah! This is more like it, bros!
CARTMAN
God damn it, who the hell do you think you are?! If you don't stop right now-!
PEWDIEPIE
Okay, that little fat kid is getting annoying. Let's get rid of him!
CARTMAN
NOOOO! [his commenter window disappears, as well as the holiday special]
PEWDIEPIE
Oh yeah! Way better, bros! This is how we do it in Sweden! BOOM head shot! BOOM head shot!
[South Park, next morning. At Stark's Pond, Stan and Kyle sit on a bench and look out over the lake.]
KYLE
Well, I finally got my family to use the living room for an hour each night.
STAN
I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about.
KYLE
Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats.
STAN
Yeah.
KYLE
No matter what we think, it's not just a passing trend. We need to realize that the new generation of entertainment is here. [notices PewDiePie's commenter window pop up to his right and above] And I, think that's great.
STAN
Yeah, I think that's great too.
PEWDIEPIE
Alright bros, it look like we'll have to end it there. I wanna thank South Park for being in my show. I hope you bros enjoyed watching, and as always, stay awesome!
[over the end credits] Oh! That's it bros. Show's over.
