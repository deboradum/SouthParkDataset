synopsis:Randy comes to terms with his role in the COVID-19 outbreak as the on-going pandemic presents continued challenges to the citizens of South Park. The kids happily head back to school but nothing resembles the normal that they once knew; not their teachers, not their homeroom, not even Eric Cartman.

script:The Pandemic Special

[The episode begins with a bleak landscape. Everything in town looks abandoned and decayed. In the school playground, one of the swings is falling apart. At the bus stop, a shoe print echoes the one at the moon landing, while a Vons sign is on the ground nearby. Butters sits on the front steps to his house, his head on his hands, wearing an N95 face mask. His father Stephen exits the house wearing a mask, with a trash bag]
BUTTERS
Hey, Dad, do you think maybe we could go to Build-A-Bear today?
STEPHEN
Butters, for the last time, you can't go to Build-A-Bear!
BUTTERS
But they said they were open again, so I-
STEPHEN
Yes, they're open, but we are not the Johnsons, and we do not go to nonessential businesses when it's nonessential! [looks out into the street. A group of four people walks by. Two of them are not wearing their masks properly] Hey, do you people mind?! You're supposed to wear your mask over your nose. Looks like you're wearing a diaper for your chin. Chin diapers don't help. [the group just moves off, followed by mumbling. More people walk by, eventually becoming a crowd] What the? What's going on now?!
ROGER DONOVAN
Something at the town square. Everyone's gathering!
STEPHEN
Well are we protesting or are we rioting?
ROGER
No no, it's something to do with the pandemic. Something big is going on.
STEPHEN
Stay here, Butters. [sets the trash bag down and joins the crowd]
[The Town Square. The stage is set up, with a sign over it reading "SOUTH PARK BENEFIT FOR COVID-19" Behind him, the background said "WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER"]
RANDY
Hey everybody. Can everyone hear me okay? Thanks for turning out, everyone. You know, we've all been through a lot these past several months. We've shut down and people have lost their businesses, lost their livelihoods. I also own a small business. I sell weed, and I have to say ... I'm actually doing pretty good. Amazing. [a business growth chart for 2020 pops up, showing how the business has grown since the pandemic began.] Tegridy Farms weed has seen a 400% increase in sales since the shutdown in March. I see Thomas Turner out there [Heidi's dad, shown with her mom]. Thomas opened a restaurant in SoDoSoPa... doesn't seem like such a good idea now, does it, Turner? [a flash of anger appears on their faces] And there's Marley Jarvis, who owned and operated her own tanning salon. Whoops. But I just can't stand here and gloat, because Tegridy Weed is about giving back to people. And that's very proud to announce... that Tegridy Weed is having a Pandemic Special! [a collage of pictures taken over the year appears, with "$ PANDEMIC SPECIAL $" plastered over it] And all-new hybrid of our best weed sold at nearly 10% off our usual price. Not only that, but when you buy three pounds or more of the Pandemic Special you get a complimentary Pandemic 2020 bong [a large blue bong with PANDEMIC 2020 on it.]. We are a community. Let's all be together... with Tegridy. [the Tegridy Farms logo pops up]
[Randy and Sharon are driving home]
RANDY
I think people are really excited. What do you think?
SHARON
A pandemic special, Randy?! Really?!
RANDY
What?
SHARON
People are hurting! People are dying, Randy! And all you can think about is making a special about it?
RANDY
[assertively] I'm doing positive to try and help. People really need this right now.
SHARON
You are a child, Randy! These are very serious times and nobody wants or cares about your stupid special right now!
RANDY
[a bit softly] We'll see if they like my special.
[An aerial view of the suburbs. A drown zeroes in on Cartman's house. "SOUTH PARK Pandemic SPECIAL" appears on the screen.]
[Cartman's room. He's in bed, but wakes up refreshed and jumps up. A rod with a small "6'" flag sits by the bedroom door]
CARTMAN
Wow! [gets up and throws his curtains open]
Another day inside, don't have to do a thing. I love you, social distancing.
No one's around, no one's talking to me. Social distancing, I'm free!
Don't have to brush my teeth or shower. For what?
I can sit on the toilet for hours. As long as I want.
'Cause no one's saying to me "You kids should go outside and do something."
[his phone alarm rings - it's time to log in.] Oh! 9 am. Time for school! [hops off the bed and goes to his computer, then logs into Zoom]
MRS. NELSON
Good morning, guys. Everyone ready to start school? [Cartman's screen fills up windows of his classmates and teacher]
CLYDE
Good morning.
WENDY
Hello.
KYLE
Hi.
SEF FURMAN
Hello.
STAN
I'm, I'm here.
MRS. NELSON
Okay, I think we're all here. I see Jimmy and Clyde are on now. Eric, are you there?
CARTMAN
Yes, teacher, I'm here. I can't wait to start [fakes a computer glitch] schoo... schoo... schoo... oo... oo...
MRS. NELSON
Oh no, Eric, I think your computer is freezing up again.
CARTMAN
Oh no? Can you guys hear me? I just said eh... eh... eh... eh...
MRS. NELSON
Eric, you'll just have to listen again, okay? Best you can. So let's start today, guys, by going over yesterday's grammar examples. [Cartman puts up a tablet with the same facial expression he just made, making sure he can see it is his own Zoom window, and leaves] Wendy, can you read the first one?
CARTMAN
I'm cut off from the world, isolated, alone. This is what I can existencing. No one can touch me or boss me around. Social distancing-
[grabs the rod and goes downstairs]
LIANE
[sees Cartman coming down the stairs] Eric, aren't you supposed to be on your Zoom call?
CARTMAN
[jabs at her with the rod as he goes to the kitchen]
Stay away from me, Mom, yeah. You've got to keep your social distance. 'Cause all I'm gonna do is sing about how much I love you and need you, social distancing
[pours himself some Cheesy Poofs cereal and milk]
LIANE
Sweetie, I know these are challenging times.
CARTMAN
Yeah Social distancing, Mom.
LIANE
But we all still have to try and do our work.
CARTMAN
[between bites] Computer keeps freezing, Mom. Maybe, if you were an essential worker, we could afford faster Internet.
LIANE
I at least need you to get some of your homework done, okay? And then m-maybe take a shower.
CARTMAN
Oh, what a folly a shower seems when my generation is being denied their lives. I can't see my friends. I can't even go to school. How I miss Kyle. Heh heh heh heh.
LIANE
Sweetie, it's all going to be over soon. They're actually talking about school opening up again in a few days! [Cartman stops eating, then turns around to look at Liane]
CARTMAN
What... the fuck... are you talking about?
LIANE
There's going to be a big meeting. Sounds like they're trying to get you, kids, back in school!
CARTMAN
We can't go back to school: there's a fucking pandemic.
LIANE
But they're talking about maybe staggering you kids every other day.
CARTMAN
They can't do that!
LIANE
Eric, you're going to be able to be with all the other kids again!
CARTMAN
Oh no, I see! There's all this horrible stuff going on in the world, but apparently, Cartman's life doesn't matter! [storms out of the kitchen]
LIANE
[gives chase] Eric, you can't-
CARTMAN
[forces her back in the kitchen with his rod] Ahp! Get back! Get back! Six feet, Mom! Six fucking feet! [makes sure she doesn't move, then leaves]
[Tegridy Farms, day. A sign on the farm's board says "Get Your PANDEMIC SPECIAL!!" Other signs promote safe distancing and safe curbside pick-up. A line of cars waits for its purchases. Randy has an umbrella out, as it's raining.]
RANDY
[as a driver pulls away] Okay, thank you very much! Hope you enjoy the Pandemic Special! [another driver pulls up] Hi, you here for the special? Here you go.
[The farmhouse window, day, kitchen. Sharon is eating lunch when Stan walks up to the table and joins her.]
SHARON
How was school, Stanley?
STAN
It's not school! It's a freakin' joke. We're not even learning anything.
SHARON
I know this has all been really hard on you, Stanley. Do you wanna talk about it?
STAN
No, I'm fine, Mom! You know, I'm strong. I'm just worried about how this is all affecting weaker kids like, you know, like Butters.
SHARON
Yeah. Well, it's nice you care about our friend, but if you need to talk... I know this is really hard on everyone.
RANDY
[Walks in happily] Well, that's it, guys. We have run out of weed for the day. [takes a seat next to Stan] Oh, hang on. Sorry, uh, didn't somebody say the pandemic special was a bad idea?
SHARON
I wasn't saying you wouldn't make money, I was saying maybe that's not what should matter right now!
RANDY
Oh, come on, think about it. Do you even know anyone personally who's dying of COVID?
SHARON
Yes! My brother Jimbo, who is in the hospital!
STAN
Yeah, Uncle Jimbo.
RANDY
Jimbo's a fat alcoholic who'd be in the hospital anyway. All I'm saying is that we let some dirty virus from "China" completely upend our lives and shut us down!
SHARON
Please do not quote the President in front of our child!
RANDY
Sharon, I went to China, remember? Last season? I went there to sell our weed and ended up hanging out with Disney and Mickey Mouse. You remember all that? I know what China's like. Doesn't surprise me all this shit came from there.
SHELLY
[off screen] We're going back to school!
SHARON
What?
SHELLY
[peeks in] They're gonna let us go back to school! [runs out]
[the living room. The TV is on and Shelly runs in to watch the news. Randy and Sharon join him]
ANCHOR TOM
The Park County School District is holding a parent meeting tomorrow, and officials are hopeful that students can return to school on Monday.
STAN
Wow, that's great!
SHARON
Oh, I don't know if this is a good idea.
ANCHOR TOM
The openings come on the heels that scientists are getting closer to finding the origins of the COVID pandemic.
CHIEF SCIENTIST
Y-yes, we've been able to trace the virus and confirm that it did, in fact, come from a seedy part of China.
RANDY
HA. Told ya! [turns and walks towards the kitchen.]
CHIEF SCIENTIST
And, in fact, we've pinpointed the virus to a certain bat in Wuhan.
RANDY
[stops in his tracks and looks back] A bat in Wuhan?
CHIEF SCIENTIST
What we still don't understand is, how did a transmitted disease get from a bat to a human? How can a virus jump species like that? We just don't know.
[Randy flashes back to his China trip last year, on which he's traveling with a bunch of other American companies to pitch their products to the Chinese. He remembers the landing and the arrest for the marijuana in his luggage...]]
RANDY
Hello. Oh, Oh hey! [...his time in a Chinese prison making goods, his trial at a tribunal...] You could use some, Tegridy, China! [...celebrating the discharge with Mickey Mouse]
MICKEY MOUSE
Here's to China! Haha.
RANDY
To China!
[Some scenes that weren't seen in last year's episode, "Band In China": Randy and Mickey are at a bar downing some drinks]
RANDY
Boy, you sure know how to party, Mick!
MICKEY
Oh my God! Look at her! Haha! She's so hot! [Randy gets a good look at the female Mickey's looking at]
RANDY
I think that's a bat.
MICKEY
Yeah! It's a bat! It's a mouse, with wings!
[outside the bar, Randy wanders the narrow streets looking for Mickey.]
RANDY
Hey, Mick? Where'd you go? [stumbles upon Mickey fucking the bat]
MICKEY
Haha, haha. Oh boy!
RANDY
Oooh!
MICKEY
Haha! Randy, you gotta try it! Go ahead, take a turn!
RANDY
[takes his turn and thoroughly enjoys it, then snaps out of the memory]
STAN
If they're letting us go back to school, then soon we can get back to everything! I mean, doesn't this mean things are finally going back to normal? Dad?
RANDY
I gotta go! [runs through the kitchen]
[Walt Disney Co., Burbank, CA., day. In the corporate office, Mickey is fielding calls]
MICKEY
Then sell fucking Epcot Center! If we can't get people on the rides, then sell the fuckin' thing! [hangs up that phone and switches to another] Nonono! I said MORE Mandalorian! [hangs up that phone] Jesus Christ! We're fucking dying here! [answers his cell phone] What?! Fucking what?! Haha.
RANDY
Hey, it's Randy Marsh From, from Tegridy Farms?
MICKEY
What do you want, Marsh?! I'm in the fuckin' weeds here!
RANDY
Look, um, do you remember when we fucked that bat in Wuhan?
MICKEY
I've fucked a lot of bats!
RANDY
Well, I've only fucked one! I remember. Right after, I got really sick, and this was all back in October.
MICKEY
Jesus Christ, you fucker! You started all this!
RANDY
You told me to fuck the bat!
MICKEY
You didn't quarantine yourself after you got home?!
RANDY
Nobody knew anything about COVID when I fucked the bat! I thought I just came back from China with the flu! Look, we can't let scientists find that bat. My wife is crazy. If she finds out I started the pandemic, she's gonna be a total bitch about it. [Mickey is stunned]
[The neighborhood. Cartman runs through it with his 6-foot pole. A couple walks their toy dog; he jabs the male aside with his pole. A jogger goes towards a park exit; he jabs him aside with his pole. He reaches Kyle's house and knocks on the door. Then he bangs on the door with the pole. Then he throws the pole through Kyle's bedroom window. Kyle opens the front door]
CARTMAN
Dude, you are not gonna believe this.
KYLE
What are you doing here??
CARTMAN
[barges in] Is your dad home, Kyle? We need to talk to a lawyer! Mr. Broflovski?!
KYLE
Dude, get out of my house! If you wanna talk, we can go outside!
CARTMAN
They're gonna try and make us go back to school.
KYLE
[covers his mouth and nose under his jacket] Dude, you could be spreading germs! [backs away]
CARTMAN
Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle! They want us to go back. To school!
KYLE
So?
CARTMAN
"So?" What the fuck is-? You really wanna go back to that slavery?!
KYLE
I want an education! I want to be able to compete for a job when I get older!
CARTMAN
You crazy, psychotic... Kyle, we need to get a lawyer to stop schools from forcing us back! Now, whatever your messed-up beliefs are about "wanting to go to school"
KYLE
You really wanna spend the next year on Zoom?
CARTMAN
You don't have to be on Zoom, there's a million ways around it! Mark my words, Kyle: first they'll force us back to school, then they'll take social distancing away from us completely, and I'll be out of my room having to hang out with you!
KYLE
You're out of your room hanging out with me now!
CARTMAN
[realizes this] Oh my God. They won't get away with this!
[South Park, day. Randy walks down Main Street with his mask on, deep in thought. He hears a woman sobbing. He looks over to see an elderly woman weeping as her husband is carried out on a gurney into an ambulance. He walks by the town cemetery, where he sees a casket lowered into the ground. He then sees something that astonishes him: Red Robin going out of business due to COVID-19. As booth benches are being carried into trucks, Death appears and points to the interior. Randy turns away and cries silently]
MAN WITH ORANGE SHIRT
Hey! Excuse me [Randy turns to see him, and he approaches], y-you're Randy Marsh, right?
RANDY
Uh... m-maybe.
MAN WITH ORANGE SHIRT
Yeah. Look man, I just wanna say thanks, you know? The Pandemic special is really amazing.
RANDY
Oh yeah. Cool. Thank you.
MAN WITH ORANGE SHIRT
Nono, listen. You... you're awesome! All this horrible stuff going on and... well, you come along and try to fight it!
RANDY
Okay, thanks.
MAN WITH ORANGE SHIRT
Y-you see, I... I lost my wife... to the virus. My kids, I... I don't even know how to talk to them, you know. Just... just thank God for your Pandemic Special. Thank God. It's a great special, it really is.
RANDY
Okay.
MAN WITH ORANGE SHIRT
No, it's an awesome special. And i-and it was a great idea to do a special.
RANDY
Okay okay, just stop! [runs away]
[Mr. Mackey's home office. He's on a Zoom meeting with the parents]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, welcome, parents, to this all-school town meeting to talk about how we're gonna get your kids back into the classroom. Can everyone hear me okay? [parents all replying] Okay, well, parents, we've made some amazing adjustments and hirings, m'kay? We believe we can welcome students back on Monday. M'kay?
SHEILA
How are you going to do this?
STEPHEN
Yeah, what happens when my son is sitting in a room with Craig Tucker, whose father doesn't even wear a mask outside?
THOMAS
Oh, here we fucking go again! Stop mask shaming, Stotch!
STEPHEN
Well, it's really not a mask if you wear it down around your chin. That's a chin diaper.
THOMAS
There's no real proof that a mask even fuckin' does anything!
STEPHEN
Spoken like a true redneck!
CAROL MCCORMICK
Oh, fuck you! [everyone starts talking over each other. One of them says "That's not fair!"]
MR. MACKEY
Okay. Okay, everyone. Alright. [presses a key on his computer to mute everyone else's microphone] Mmkay! I just muted everybody! Okay! Now, if we don't get along, I'll just sit here with you all on mute! [no one on screen is moving] Okay, now let's try this again. [presses a key and the mics are back on]
MRS. TWEEK
I saw Wendy's mother not wearing a mask in the changing room at Ross.
MRS. TESTABURGER
The fuck are you doing spying on me in the changing room?! I was at Ross- [accusing resumes]
MR. MACKEY
Okay, BOOM! [silences the mics again] You're all muted! Mmkay?! I can do this all day! Now, we've made changes at the school, and we feel prepared to welcome your students back! [Roger Donovan raises his hand] Mr. Donovan!
ROGER
I don't care what changes you've made, my son Clyde is not going to class!
MR. MACKEY
And that is your prerogative. Mute! [mutes Roger, unmutes Sharon] Mmkay, Mrs. Marsh.
SHARON
I thought that the issue was the teachers not coming back.
MR. MACKEY
That is correct. Our teaching staff does not feel safe to return, BUT... we have hired all new teachers, m'kay? These are people who have recently lost their jobs due to recent events and are desperate for work. Mmkay, so they'll do just about anything.
STEPHEN
What new teachers?
[South Park, day. The police force is now the new teaching staff. Harrison Yates addresses them outside the police station]
YATES
Alright, men! As you all know, due to recent events totally beyond our control, we have lost most of our funding. But this new venture will be great. and I know we will all thrive as elementary schoolteachers. This might be our last chance at a job, so I don't want any unnecessary deaths. [the officers groan "Awww!"] Ahp! Ahp! No unnecessary deaths! And let's show this town just what great leaders we can be. This is gonna be great.
[Tegridy Farms, day. Sharon gives Shelly and Stan their lunches]
ANCHOR TOM
All over South Park this morning, children are getting ready for their first day of class. And as they do, scientists say they're closer to finding a vaccine.
STAN
Oh cool! Turn it up!
BILL KEEGAN
Tom, I'm standing in front of the newly built viral research center where scientists say they have found the animal which started the coronavirus. [some lab scientists are shown working on samples] The creature was located in China and then flown to the facility here, where scientists are studying it thoroughly.
RANDY
[peaks in upon hearing the report] Heyheyhey, whoa whoa! W-what are you guys doing?!
STAN
They think they're about to find the vaccine.
CHIEF SCIENTIST
Yes, now that we have the animal in our possession, we'll finally be able to unlock what caused a virus to jump from it to humans.
RANDY
[stands in front of the TV] Does it matter what started coronavirus?! Who cares what started coronavirus?! You guys are being racist! We don't need to watch this! Where's the remote? [begins looking all over the sofa] This is... this is racist television and we're not gonna watch it! [checks out the sofa on either side of Sharon]
SHARON
I want to hear this, Randy!
RANDY
No! No. You know what? You guys are horrible! Just, just stop it right now!
BILL KEEGAN
You traced the virus to Wuhan, but what you found was not a bat. Is that correct?
CHIEF SCIENTIST
Nono, the virus did not come from a bat.
RANDY
You guys- [stops mid-sentence] What? What did he say?
CHIEF SCIENTIST
We were able to break down the virus enough to see there was actually no bat involved.
RANDY
No bat involved. No bat involved! [dances around gleefully] Oh yeah! Oh yeah! It wasn't a bat! It wasn't a bat! It wasn't a bat! In your face! In your face! It wasn't a bat!
CHIEF SCIENTIST
When we tracked the virus, we found it did originate in Wuhan, but from a species called pholidota.
BILL KEEGAN
And what exactly is pholidota?
CHIEF SCIENTIST
It's a pangolin. And here it is, right over here. [Bill Keegan and the Chief Scientist walk over to a cage holding the pangolin]
STAN
What's a pangolin, Mom?
SHARON
I'm not even sure. Do you know what a pangolin is, Randy? [Randy is lost in a memory] Randy?
STAN
Do you know what a pangolin is, Dad?
[Randy flashes back to his time in China with Mickey. They're in the back seat of a taxi, tired]
MICKEY
Haha haha. Dude, I still can't believe you fucked that bat. Haha.
RANDY
Okaaay, okaaay, Shhhh.
MICKEY
Haha. You really let her have it! Oh boy!
RANDY
Okay! I don't wanna think about that right now, Mickey!
MICKEY
I'm just impressed, that's all. I mean, if you can handle a bat, then...
RANDY
Then what?
MICKEY
You ever have sex with a pangolin?
RANDY
What the fuck is a pangolin? [Mickey tells the driver in Chinese to stop]
[A hotel room in Wuhan. While Mickey is the iPhone making more deals, Randy is fucking a pangolin]
RANDY
Ha ha, ha whoa! [he's enjoying it rather thoroughly, then he snaps back to the present] Shit! [runs out of the farmhouse]
[South Park Elementary. A sign over the entrance reads "Welcome Back Students!" The 4th Grade classroom is shown, with 12 decks instead of the usual 24. The desks are divided into groups of two. Each desk has a protective plastic shield in front and to the right, with a slot at the bottom for school work to be handed through. The officers are wearing clear plastic face shields, the kids are all wearing face masks]
YATES
Alright, children, welcome back to class. I'm your new teacher, Detective Harris, and this is our homeroom teacher's assistant, Officer Johnston. Let's start the day off with some math. Does anyone understand math? Who would like to lead the class with some math? [the sounds of a squealing pig approach the classroom door. The door opens, and Cartman is being carried in by two officers. He's mumbling gibberish, but then gets out a few sentences.]
CARTMAN
Pandemic! There's a pandemic! You can't make me go to school! [the officers tie him to his chair] You can't! Argh! Araraaagh! Nonono! Nonono! You can't make me! You hear me?!
YATES
I don't know if I can do this, Mitch. I fuckin' hate kids. I can't be a teacher.
MITCH
It's all we got, sir [steps forward and assumes an assertive stance] Let me try. Kids! Alright, come on! Let's settle down! Now we're gonna do some fingerpaints. You got that? You're gonna fingerpaint... [reads from a small notebook] a marsupial of your choice or a fun thing you did over the summer.
CARTMAN
You can't make us stay here! This is a violation of our freedom! Who's with me, guys?!
MITCH
Now, listen! We're gonna start fingerpaintin' right now!
CARTMAN
Oh my God, I forgot how much it sucks to be around everybody! I think I'm gonna be sick, all over Kyle! [pretends to vomit and cough over Kyle]
KYLE
Fuck you! [Kyle jumps out of his seat and beats him up. The other kids start cheering]
MITCH
That's enough! [Harris beings out his service revolver and aims. Mitch does as well, and they fire away. A shot goes through Tolkien's front shield. A few more follow, and he takes a shot in the arm]
TOLKIEN
Ow! [his left hand is over the wound. He falls out of his seat and onto the floor. Gunfire and cheering stop]
YATES
Got 'im!
[South Park Viral Research Center, day. The pangolin is in its cage. A scientist shines a sensor onto it for a second]
CHIEF SCIENTIST
[leads a new research team in and walks to the cage] Aaand here it is. This is the pangolin we tracked down in China, the animal that could lead us to a vaccine. The mysteries of COVID can be unlocked by our studies of this creature. I'll just ask you all to keep a good distance away. Obviously, we can't let anything happen to this pangolin. [Randy sneaks up behind the scientists] You see, this pangolin's DNA has mutated, which is what we believe started it all.
SCIENTIST 1
The pangolin has mutated, how?
CHIEF SCIENTIST
We're not completely sure, but we believe now that something somehow... got its DNA up into the pangolin.
SCIENTIST 2
How exactly could that happen?
CHIEF SCIENTIST
Well i-it's almost like another creature somehow inserted its DNA up into the pangolin.
SCIENTIST 3
Perhaps some other species somehow mated with the pangolin?
SCIENTIST 2
Oh, come on! What kind of animal would have sex with a pangolin?
SCIENTIST 1
Yeah! Look how ugly that thing is!
SCIENTISTS
[chuckle at the possibility] Yeah, yeah.
RANDY
Okay, Okay.
CHIEF SCIENTIST
Again, what really matters is that we decode the foreign DNA inside the pangolin. That would be the key to the vaccine, perhaps even a cure. We have to know what raped the pangolin.
RANDY
Oh, so now it was "rape."
CHIEF SCIENTIST
Excuse me, sir. Who are you? [Randy stays silent] This tour is for scientists that specialize in pandemics. Are you... a pandemic specialist?
RANDY
Yeah I'm a pandemic specialist. I'm making one right now.
CHIEF SCIENTIST
Uh-kay. Anyway, if you all follow me now to the micro labs, I can show you the containment system for once a vaccine is able to be tried. [Randy pretends to walk with them but pulls back to the cage. He takes the pangolin out and struggles with it for a few seconds, then stuffs it down his pants and sneaks away.]
[South Park Elementary, day. A crowd of parents has gathered in front of the school. Mr. Mackey and the police officers look back at them. Mr. Mackey pulls out his bullhorn and turns it on, causing a reverb]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay. mmkay, parents? Can everyone hear me okay? [the crowd is shown from his point of view - they all have masks, but have lowered them to speak] Everyone listens up. We don't want anyone to panic, okay, but there has been a COVID exposure here at the school. [parents gasp] Okay, one of our fourth graders was taken to the hospital a couple of hours ago, okay? But we think Tolkien's gonna be okay. Now, due to county protocol, everyone that was in the school now has to quarantine for two weeks. So we will be keeping your kids here, and the teachers will be staying with them. [parents shout back.]
[The school gym, day. All the school kids are here, not just the fourth graders. They are talking amongst themselves]
YATES
Alright, students. shut up. [conversations fade off] I know this situation is not ideal, but we all have to quarantine together for two weeks.
CARTMAN
This is bullshit!
YATES
You don't want to infect your families, do you? You were all exposed to a student here who was taken to the hospital due to COVID. Yes?
STAN
Uh, we were there, and Token was actually taken to the hospital because you guys shot him.
YATES
Yes, due to COVID. If it weren't for COVID, all the previous teachers would have still been here, we wouldn't have been in the class, and nobody would have gotten shot. Therefore, the young man is in the hospital due to COVID.
OFFICER 1
It was COVID-related.
STAN
That doesn't make any sense!
[Tegridy Farms, day. Randy watches the news in the living room]
NEWSMAN
And scientists are asking all South Park County residents to keep an eye out for the creature. Once again, the pangolin escaped from the facility yesterday, and many people are fearing the worst. Scientists say that even though they have samples from the pangolin, they now don't have what they need for a vaccine.
CHIEF SCIENTIST
Yes. You see, what we needed was the foreign DNA that was up inside the pangolin. It's whatever that DNA was that was our key to the cure. [someone outside sees Randy and whistles to him. Randy looks over and cowers a bit]
DELIVERY EXPRESS MAN
Hello! Anyone home?? [Randy gets up and goes outside to see who it is. It's a delivery man with a package for him] Got a delivery here. Needs a signature.
RANDY
[relieved] Oh, okay.
DELIVERY EXPRESS MAN
Oh, he-hey, if you're gonna come any closer, would you mind wearing a, you know, chin diaper?
RANDY
Oh, sorry. [reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls out a face mask and puts it on... as a chin diaper. They approach each other.]
DELIVERY EXPRESS MAN
Here you go. Just sign right there. [Randy signs a small tablet and hands it to the delivery man, who hands him the package] Have a nice day. [they part ways, but the delivery man turns around] Oh, and hey, I'm really loving the pandemic special.
RANDY
Yeah thanks. [he goes inside and opens the package, but drops it once he says what's inside: a bloody heart with "YOU'RE DEAD" written in blood on one of the flaps. Randy is afraid, yet puzzled]
[The barn. Randy calls up Mickey]
RANDY
Why did you send that to me?
MICKEY
Haha. Because you're a dead man, Marsh. It's your DNA that they need for a vaccine! Haha!
RANDY
Yeah, I know, but I can't just turn myself in!
MICKEY
This isn't personal, Marsh. It's business. I'm having you killed, then secretly we'll send your DNA to the scientists for the vaccine. Haha.
RANDY
This is all your fault, Mickey Mouse! You made the deal with the devil when you sold your Mulan shit to China! And then you took me out and sold me on how great China was, and how we should all suck their dick! You made me lose my tegridy and anything special that I had-! [stops] Special. Wait a minute. That's it!
MICKEY
What's it? Haha.
RANDY
The Special. The Pandemic Special! That's how we can get my DNA into people! We can vaccinate them without them even knowing!
MICKEY
What are you talkin' about?
RANDY
Just give me a couple of more days before you have me killed. I-I think I know a way out of this.
[Hell's Pass Hospital, night. The hospital has set up a COVID-19 ward. where the sickest patients are housed. In the still of the night, one hears only monitors and ventilators. Jimbo is in one room with a picture of himself and Stan, and a sign above his bed wishing him well. Someone pounds on something nearby. Jimbo opens his eyes and notices the window... and the spooky figure outside of it. The figure opens the window and jumps in - it's Randy]
JIMBO
Randy?
RANDY
Shhh. Hey Jimbo.
JIMBO
Wha-what are you-?
RANDY
It's okay, Jimbo. I think I might have a cure for COVID. [he brings out a jar of Tegridy Weed and opens the lid, then pats Jimbo on the shoulder] You're just gonna have to trust me, okay? [walks off and masturbates into the jar, then rolls a joint, walks over, and motions for Jimbo to keep quiet]
JIMBO
Uh, uh...
RANDY
Shhhh, this is gonna be great.
JIMBO
No, uh... [Randy lifts up the oxygen mask and puts the joint in Jimbo's mouth]
RANDY
It's okay, it's okay. Just breathe. Breeeathe. [Jimbo coughs] It's okay. It's okay, breathe.
[South Park Elementary, day. "QUARANTINE AREA. DO NOT ENTER WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION." In another 4th Grade classroom, the students are working on an assignment in silence as the assistant monitors them with a baton in hand. During recess, another officer monitors Wendy as she swings silently. At the computer lab, a sign next to the door says "PARENT ZOOM VISITATION 5 MINUTES MAXIMUM." An officer stands guard outside. A few kids are inside talking to their parents on Zoom]
MR. MCARTHUR
[to his Red] We miss you, honey. We can't wait for quarantine to be over! Huh.
[in the school gym, kids are inside playing with various sports balls. Stan dribbles a basketball until a whistle blows, then stops. In the cafeteria, several kids eat lunch socially distant from each other. A buzzer blares]
OFFICER 2
Group 4, your meal is over! Back to your class! [motions the kids to head for the entrance. The kids take their trays, dispose of the meals, and exit]
OFFICER 3
Alright. Group 5, it's now mealtime. Come in, but keep your social distance. [the next group comes in, including Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman.] Yeah, that's good social distancing. Real good.
BUTTERS
[muttering to himself] March 16th. It was March 16th! That's how long it's been! It was supposed to be a party! A big, happy gathering at Build-A-Bear to celebrate me being a big boy at the dentist! Then they shut it all down. They said I'd have to wait until April. And then it was May. And then they said, "Wait until summer." It's fucking October now! [swats his lunch away, then hops onto the table to rant. Four officers behind him by the wall react] Why doesn't anyone tell me the truth?! [grabs Monica's lunch then throws that away] That I'm never going to Build-A-Bear! [one of the officers taps his baton against his anti-riot shield, and two officers to his left move forward] That I'm never going ever again!
STAN
[notices the officers moving towards Butters] Butters, Butters, you gotta calm down.
BUTTERS
I'm never going to Build-A-Bear, am I?! [the officers flank him] Oh, hey teachers. Sorry. [they carry him out of the cafeteria] W-wait, I'm sorry. I don't need to go to Build-A-Bear! Fellas?! [the other kids are stunned]
[Tegridy Farms day. A customer honks his car horn. Randy is asleep in his underwear. Sharon walks up to him]
SHARON
Randy? Where are the car keys? Randy!
RANDY
Huh? Uh, what? What?
SHARON
Where are the car keys?
RANDY
They're probably in my pants pocket. Why?
SHARON
I have to get over to the hospital.
RANDY
The hospital? For what?
SHARON
It's Jimbo. Doctor said he's better, so I can take him home.
RANDY
Jimbo's better?
SHARON
They said he doesn't have any symptoms, and his tests are showing negative.
RANDY
Holy shit. [realizing that his DNA might have just saved Jimbo's life.]
[The barn. Randy walks up to a jar of Tegridy Weed.]
RANDY
It works. It can help. [opens the jar and masturbates into it. Then he faces shelves and shelves of jars and realizes he has to masturbate into all of them.] Hoh boy. [he unzips his pants and drops them]
[South Park Elementary, day. Kyle walks down the hall, Stan catches up to him]
STAN
Kyle, I need to talk to you.
KYLE
Hey dude.
STAN
I'm really worried. About Butters. I think he's sick.
KYLE
You think he got the virus?
STAN
No! It's all the other stuff. The isolation and the uncertainty. [put his hands in his jacket pockets and wanders off] I'm just really worried what all the stuff around COVID is doing to some kids. You know, not every kid is like us. There's some kids who really can't take it anymore.
KYLE
I know. This bullshit sucks. But Butters will be okay.
STAN
[getting emotional] And what if he's not? What if Butters is actually starting to lose his mind? What if he feels his body shutting down right now?
KYLE
You really think it's that bad?
STAN
It's time for us to ask for help. From someone who has more authority at this school than these cops.
[The White House, day. In the Oval Office, Pres. Garrison looks out the window, his back to the entrance]
MALE AIDE 1
Mr. President, the CDC is on the line. They need to speak with you urgently!
GARRISON
Tell them to suck my asshole.
FEMALE AIDE
Mr. President, Dr. Fauci is on line 2 and the FDA chief is on line 3.
GARRISON
Ooo! Tell Fauci to shove it up his ass, and let the FDA chief know he can eat shit off my balls.
MALE AIDE 2
Sir! Sir, you have an urgent call on line 4 from a Mr. Slave?
GARRISON
[turns around in his chair and wonders] Mr. Slave? Okay, go, gogogo! [the aides leave and Garrison clears his throat. He picks up the phone] Yes, this is the President of the entire United States.
STAN
Uh, hi, it's Stan Marsh.
GARRISON
Stan Marsh? Where's Mr. Slave?
STAN
I'm sorry. We had to get your attention. Listen, we're being kept at the school, and one of the students here is really sick.
GARRISON
Oh, for Pete's sake, here we go again. [rolls his eyes and closes them] Just deal with it. I am busy.
STAN
Nono, Mr. President, please! You gotta come back to South Park. Our teachers are shooting people. Everyone's arguing and, and there's a facility outside of town that found the pangolin and are working on a vaccine! You might be able to stop the pandemic.
GARRISON
Why would I do that?
STAN
...Huh?
GARRISON
Stan, this is gonna be very difficult for a child to understand, but I made a promise to the American people- to get rid of all the Mexicans.
STAN
But the pandemic isn't just killing Mexicans.
GARRISON
It's killing a lot of them. I've gone over the statistics, Stan. [walks over to a chart showing U.S. COVID fatalities by race. Mexicans are by far the most affected ethnicity, and whites the least affected.] All I have to do now is sort of guide the avalanche in the right direction, and I'm fulfilling my promises to the American People. I was doing a crap job until this pandemic happened.
STAN
You're just gonna sit there and not do anything?!
GARRISON
I am going to actively not do anything. And you can eat shit off my balls and die. [hangs up]
STAN
God dammit!
[Tegridy Farms, day. A line of cars waits at the entrance, with horns honking. A small booth is by the mailbox. Randy is using a cane to support himself. All that masturbation has weakened him]
RANDY
Ogh. Ogh-o. [limps to the next customer] Okay, there you go. That's all I can sell you right now. Just make sure you smoke it, okay? Enjoy the special. [the customer drives off. He limps back to the small booth] Han-hang on, guys. I gotta prep some more. Just give me like four minutes. [enters the booth and masturbates into the next jar.]
SHARON
[comes out of the house] Randy?!
RANDY
Ogh.
SHARON
Randy?!
RANDY
Just... [irked] what?!
SHARON
Randy, you've gotta get in here!
RANDY
I'm doing something important, Sharon! People need this right now!
SHARON
Come upstairs. Something's wrong with Jimbo! [Randy slowly limps upstairs.] He's just been sleeping for days. [puts her mask on and goes to Jimbo's room] They said he was getting better. [Randy limps forward, holding his crotch] Last night his fever came back. And then a few hours ago, this thing appeared on his face.
RANDY
What thing? [Sharon slowly lowers Jimbo's mask, and ... it's Randy's mustache. Randy's jaw drops]
SHARON
Jimbo's never been able to grow a mustache.
RANDY
Huh. That's weird.
SHARON
Should I call the doctor?
RANDY
No! Nonono! Don't call the doctor! They're busy. These are u-un- precedented times. W-we have no idea what caused this.
JIMBO
[slowly] Special...
SHARON
What, Jimbo?
JIMBO
Pandemic... uh special...
SHARON
[looks at Randy] Why's he talking about your special?
RANDY
[rapidly] Everyone's talking about the special, Sharon. It's a big deal. He obviously needs it right now.
SHARON
I'm gonna get the thermometer. [walks away. Randy quickly goes to Jimbo's side]
RANDY
[whispering angrily] Just fucking shut up! You have no idea if it's because of the special. You could just be sick again 'cause you're a fat, fuckin' alcoholic, and I am not going to jail for you! [smacks him and walks away, holding his crotch and grimacing]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. A doctor is checking out the mustache on Gerald's face, which is different from the one he usually has.]
DR. DOCTOR
And you say you've never had a mustache before?
GERALD
No! Never! It just came outta nowhere!
SHEILA
How can this happen, Doctor?
DR. DOCTOR
Have you put anything toxic in your body lately? Any drugs or alcohol?
GERALD
No! I mean... I've enjoyed a little of the Pandemic Special...
DR. DOCTOR
Oh, nonono. That-that's totally fine.
NURSE
Doctor? You better come to the emergency room! [they both go to the ER, which is filled with patients, including women, who have the pandemic mustache.]
DR. DOCTOR
Holy shit!
[Breaking news. COVID-19 UPDATE?]
ANCHOR TOM
Another strain of COVID, or simply more COVID-related symptoms? A reported 1 in 10 people in Park County are experiencing mustaches, and nobody seems to know why. The Mayor has called for help from infectious disease experts, and Dr. Anthony Fauci arrived at South park Hospital today to give his advice.
[Hell's Pass Hospital entrance. Dr. Fauci addresses the crowd]
DR. FAUCI
We aren't sure why some people are getting a mustache and some aren't, but we have to do all we can to avoid it becoming fashionable.
MAN 1
Will our chin diapers keep us safe?
DR. FAUCI
Yes, but we must wear them where the mustache would be. We need to wear them over our mouth and nose.
STEPHEN
Are you out of your mind? You expect people to wear a diaper over their nose? That's disgusting! Fuck you, Fauci!
[Back to the news report]
ANCHOR TOM
Citizens are asked to stay indoors and just try and relax, and maybe enjoy some of the Pandemic Special.
RANDY
Nooo! Shit! [Sharon has her hands over her mouth]
[South Park, night. The school gym is shown from above. Twenty-nine students are sleeping there, each in his own circle. Stan is wide awake, looking at the ceiling. An officer sits in the coach's office looking at a jar of Tegridy Weed]
OFFICER 4
Nice. [Stan sits up. He looks to his left and sees Death staring back at him through a window, then crawls up to Butters and shakes him awake]
STAN
Butters. Butters!
BUTTERS
Wha?
STAN
Don't worry. I'm going to save you!
BUTTERS
Okay. Save me from what? [nods off, and Stan walks to the middle of the gym]
STAN
Guys, guys! [claps. The kids begin to stir]
STUDENTS
What? Who is it?
STAN
Shhh. You guys, we have to get Butters out of here.
KYLE
Who else can we call, Stan?
STAN
No! We have to get him out of here! Now! We need to take him... to Build-A-Bear.
CRAIG
Are you nuts??
STAN
He has to go out and do something normal!
JIMMY
Stan, Build-A-Bear is currently by appointment only, and only a maximum party of four can visit at one time.
STAN
We can't wait around and wait for people to figure things out, okay?! It's not gonna happen! They just keep taking everything from him and saying it's for his own good! But who's to say he can't go out and have a little goddamn fun?! If we want things to go back to normal, then we just gotta go do it!
CARTMAN
[stands up] Stan's right. If we want things to go back to normal, we have to do it ourselves.
STAN
They're just gonna be making more restrictions, and more rules, and who's gonna fight to go back to the way things were?
CARTMAN
I sure as hell will!
STAN
We can make things normal for Butters again, and make school the way it was!
CARTMAN
The way it was! Online, in our own rooms!
STAN
Wait, what? No, in a class, with real teachers!
CARTMAN
Wait, what? What normal are you talking about?
STAN
I'm talking about normal, like back in March. What normal are you talking about?
CARTMAN
I'm talking about normal, like three days ago, when everything was awesome.
STAN
Look it doesn't matter. We just gotta break the fuck out of here.
[The hallways. Sef Furman runs down the hall; the police do not notice. Craig and Tweek follow the boy, then the Boy with Brown Hair and Red Shirt follows them. The rest of the class follows, including Timmy whose wheelchair moves loudly. At the front of the school, Jimmy heads towards the bolted doors with bolt cutters]
TIMMY
TIMMAH! [cuts the bolt, and the chain drops to the floor. The kids rush out the door and pour out of the school triumphantly]
[News Break. COVID-19 UPDATE]
ANCHOR TOM
The new outbreak in South Park is spreading rapidly, and as highways into town close and governments consider a full lockdown, one question is on everyone's mind: where is the damn pangolin?! Some speculate the pangolin took its own life, while others think that- [something is being whispered in his ear] Sorry. Sorry, we're getting some breaking news. Oh, God. Students at South Park Elementary have broken quarantine and are now out on the loose!
BILL KEEGAN
[outside the school, during the day] The fugitives broke out sometime last night. Teachers are reporting there's no cause for alarm, except that these children have all been exposed to COVID [his voice gets more urgent] and could be running around spreading mustaches right now!
WOMAN
[hears this and screams] Aaaaaaaaow! [This sets off a mass panic]
MAN 2
Super-spreaders! [drivers get into near-collisions, shoppers stock up on toilet paper and other goods, ]
STOCKER
[notices a woman carrying two cans] One can of shaving cream per family! [Park County Shoes is broken into and looted]
STEPHEN
[he and Linda have their masks on as chin diapers] Butters?! Butters, you get back to quarantine or you are gonna be grounded!
THOMAS
Hey, Stotch! [Stephen looks over and sees that Thomas has his mask on properly] You heard what the scientist said! Get your diaper up over your mustache area!
STEPHEN
I'm not wearing a damn diaper over my nose!
MRS. TESTABURGER
Don't you care about people?
STEPHEN
Yeah, we care way more about what's right than you do, bitch! [walks up and punches her once, and she goes down. Thomas punches him in return] Oh! [a brawl breaks out in the street]
[The Mayor's Office. She looks out over the rioting while she's on the phone]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
For Christ's sake, the entire town is in chaos! How the hell did you let those kids out of quarantine?!
YATES
[at the school, with all his officers at attention] Don't blame this on us teachers! You opened the school and gave us barely enough resources to do our job!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Everyone is terrified of catching something from these super-spreaders!
YATES
Well, I don't know what you're gonna do, Mayor. You took all our funding away. You said our equipment was too extreme. Now, if we had some of that stuff back...
OFFICER 1
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
YATES
Tsst-tst-tst-ch-ch-ch!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
We certainly don't want you, teachers, to be without every resource available. I'll write an executive order to get you everything you need.
YATES
[hangs up] Boys? We are back in business!
OFFICERS
[cheering] YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!...
[The police roll-out with patrol cars and Peacemaker tanks. Motorcycle and equestrian units with semiautomatics join them. An officer arms a bazooka. K9 units join in. It's a massive show of force.]
YATES
Possible COVID exposure at 4 o'clock! [the Boy with Brown Hair and Red Shirt is building a snowman. Yates gets on the bullhorn] You there. [the boy looks up] You are violating a mandated safer-inside order! Put down the snowball and get back to quarantine! [the boy drops the snowball] We've got a runner! [the police fire all their weapons and decimate the boy. Kenny and Annie Knitts run down the street and Kenny is shot to death. Two officers walk by Univers Coffee, then Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Butters come out of hiding]
STAN
Okay, all clear! Come on! Go go go! [Butters is lying down in a small wagon, the other three wheel him down the sidewalk] All right, you ready to have some fun, Butters?
BUTTERS
I sure am, fellas!
KYLE
Okay!
STAN
Shit shit, get back, back, back, back, back! [they hide in Parking Lot A. Death rides by and they come back out] Okay, all good. Come on. [They reach a plaza]
KYLE
Dude, we made it.
STAN
Butters, Butters. [wakes Butters up] Look! [Butters looks up and sees Build-A-Bear Workshop]
BUTTERS
Whoa! Is it really for reals?
STAN
Yeah, it's real. Come on! We got an appointment! [helps Butters out of the wagon. They reach the entrance, only to see James the shopkeeper closing the shop.] Oh, uh hey, excuse me. We had an appointment.
JAMES
Oh no, s-sorry. We're closed.
STAN
But I called. Y-you said you were open today for appointments.
JAMES
Yeah, we had to shut down again. Somebody came into the store with a mustache.
KYLE
A mustache?
STAN
Ple-hease, my friend has to build a bear.
JAMES
[walks away] I'm sorry! These are unprecedented times!
STAN
Ohoh, just give us one minute!
BUTTERS
Oh! Good job, Stan! Thanks for getting my hopes up, you asshole!
KYLE
[walks up to Stan with Cartman] Come on, dude. We'd better get outta here before we're spotted.
STAN
We can't go.
KYLE
What do you mean?
STAN
We don't have a choice. We're gonna have to break in.
KYLE
And then do what?
STAN
And then build him a bear.
CARTMAN
Without any employees? What, do you expect us to just, just... build our own bear?
STAN
If we have to, yes!
KYLE
Dude, you need people to help you do the stuffing and the closing. You don't- you don't actually build your own bear.
STAN
I don't care! I'm not following the rules anymore!
[Tegridy Farms, day. Randy is piling his unsold Tegridy Weed onto the company truck. After the second load, Sharon stops him.]
SHARON
What the hell are you doing?!
RANDY
I just... gotta take all the Pandemic Special over to Thompson Lake and dump it.
SHARON
Dump it? Why are you worrying about this right now?!
RANDY
Because the Pandemic Special needs to end! A special has to end, Sharon, or else it's not really a "special," is it?! [runs for some more weed]
SHARON
Goddammit, Randy, our son is out in this chaos! [heads towards the driver's seat] This is not the time for you to be dealing with your fucking marijuana! [hops into the seat and closes the door] Somebody's gotta find him! [starts the engine]
RANDY
Nono, okay, okay, okay, hold on! I'm coming! [gets into the passenger seat] Maybe we can just drop the special by the lake on the way.
SHARON
Fuck you!
[Build-A-Bear Workshop, day. The boys have broken in]
STAN
Here we are, Butters! Look! You made it!
BUTTERS
Oh boy, is this a dream?
STAN
No, it's not a dream! We are really here, and we are going to build you a bear! Which one you want? You want the panda? You want the Bronco koala?
BUTTERS
The Caballero Grizzly.
STAN
Caballero Grizzly. [gets the materials needed] Okay, we just find the sh-shell and the uh, the outfit.
CARTMAN
Stan, you really need employee assistance with this.
STAN
It's gonna fucking work! Just fucking shut up! [take the shell to a stuffer] Okay! Okay, Butters. Look! [starts the machine] We're gonna put the stuffing in!
BUTTERS
Wow!
STAN
Okay, uh, um... [starts pressing buttons. All of a sudden, the shell is pumped full of cotton and explodes]
BUTTERS
Aaaah! God! Daaagh!
STAN
It's okay! We can start over! We can start over! There'a do-over machine right over there! Look! [walks over to a shredder and drops the mangled bear in. The shredder has a window through which the bear is seen being destroyed.]
[South Park. The rioting continues. Sharon drives through it]
SHARON
Stanley! Staaaaan! What if he's dead, Randy?!
RANDY
He's not dead, Sharon.
SHARON
Then why hasn't he even called?! [two people jump onto the truck, both with mustaches]
MAN 3
Hey, can we have some of that Pandemic Special?
RANDY
No! [the men slip off the truck] Nobody needs the special right now! It's not helping! [looks out the passenger-side window] Oh my God. Oh God no.
SHARON
What?? [they see Applebee's closed, and two men carrying a table into a moving truck.]
RANDY
[sheds a tear] They got Applebee's too. [turns to Sharon] Drive me back to the farm, Sharon. I need to get something.
[Build-A-Bear Workshop, day. Stan is trying to build another bear, but the cotton isn't going in]
STAN
God dammit! [looks out the window and sees Death there. Stan tries one more time to fill the shell, but the gust of air knocks him to the ground. Stan gets right back up to try again]
KYLE
Dude, just let it go.
STAN
No, Kyle, we can't let Butters down!
KYLE
[walks up to Stan] Stan, are you sure this is about Butters? 'Cause you seem really desperate to build a bear.
YATES
[on his bullhorn outside] Attention protesting looters. [the boys look over and walk up to the entrance] Protesting slash looting is a violation of the Mayor's health order! You have five minutes to come out or we will have to take action
BUTTERS
We gotta surrender, fellas. I'm honestly not having that much fun anyway.
STAN
No! I'm not giving up!
YATES
All right, that was about five minutes. [on the bullhorn to the officers] Okay, boys! Light 'em up! [an officer aims a cannon at Kyle, who has his back to the window]
RANDY
[steps into the cannon's scope] Wait! Everyone just stop!
YATES
Who the hell is that?
RANDY
I have something that might change all of this! [reaches into a bag and pulls out the pangolin. The crowd gasps]
STEPHEN
It's the pangolin.
THOMAS
Look!
OTHER TOWNSFOLK
The pangolin! He's found it! The pangolin! Whoa!
RANDY
This... is what you've all be looking for, right? Well here! Go ahead and do all the tests you want on it. You'll find out... everything you need to know. [the crowd murmurs]
CARTMAN
Oh no! You're not ending this pandemic! [grabs the pangolin and runs back inside the store]
KYLE
Hey!
STAN
Cartman, no! [follows Cartman inside with Kyle. Cartman prepares to drop the pangolin into the store's shredder] Don't do it, Cartman! That thing is our only chance!
CARTMAN
Your only chance! For your normal, not mine! I am not going back to school!
STAN
You guys were right, okay? This hasn't been about Butters. I've been acting like this because I can't take these shutdowns anymore, and I'm scared what it's doing to me! I'm looking for whom to blame. Saying I'm trying to help people to make myself feel better because the truth is... I just wanna have fun again. [Cartman looks at him] I wanted to see that I could go out in the world and do things that I used to do, but I can't. I'm not any better, and I don't care any more than anyone else. And I did all this [tears well up in his eyes] because I just want my life back! I just want my life back... [begins to weep silently. Cartman's look softens. He looks at the shredder, at the boys, then steps down from the shredder, carries the pangolin out of the store, and gives it to the Chief Scientist]
KYLE
[awed by this act of mercy] I don't believe it.
STEPHEN
So, so what happens now?
CHIEF SCIENTIST
Now we have hope. We've learned that we might never get back our old lives, but by working together, we just might find a new way to- [a plume of flame attacks the pangolin and the Chief Scientist. Behind this act is President Garrison with a flamethrower. Garrison doesn't let up until the Chief Scientist no longer screams.]
GARRISON
Don't forget to get out and vote, everybody! Big election coming up. [turns around and walks away]
[Tegridy Farms, evening. A banner covers the sign: "CLOSED DUE TO FIRES"]
RADIO REPORTER
And since the students broke quarantine, all South Park residents are now exposed and under complete lockdown for the unforeseeable future. [a wall of flames looms in the distance. Death appears in the field, then gets on his bike and rides away. Randy looks at his phone. The lock screen has a picture of his family in it.]
RANDY
How do I even begin to apologize? You guys were right. I think all the marijuana really did go to my head. You said it: a drug is a drug, and... I'm not who I used to be. It's time for me to own up to everything. It's time everyone knew what started this pandemic. [walks into the house and upstairs, and enters his bedroom. He finds Sharon asleep and walks to the bed] Hey, Sharon, I need to talk to you. [sits down] I'm not as strong as you are, Sharon. I can't deal with hard times the way that you can. [Sharon sits up, and her new mustache is quite visible]
SHARON
If you're ready to talk, I'm ready to listen, Randy. [Randy looks at her and has no words] What?
RANDY
...You want nothing to do with the Pandemic Special.
SHARON
No. I don't smoke marijuana, Randy.
RANDY
Uh huh. [gets up and walks off]
SHARON
Well, what did you want to talk to me about?
RANDY
I just... think maybe I'm gonna do a few more specials. You got some shit on your face. [leaves the room. Sharon reaches for her upper lip]
End of The Pandemic Special


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The citizens of South ParQ are clamoring for the COVID-19 vaccine. A hilarious new militant group tries to stop the boys from getting their teacher vaccinated.

script:South ParQ Vaccination Special

[Walgreens, day. A generic club song can be heard coming from it. Richard Adler and Mr. Mackey arrive by car in the parking lot.]
RICHARD ADLER
Oof, I feel silly. They're not gonna let us in!
MR. MACKEY
Will you just come on. You gotta loosen up, Mr. Adler.
RICHARD ADLER
But this is the most popular place in town right now!
MR. MACKEY
We can get in. Just comb your hair, you know, look your best. I can get us in. [they both put their masks on]
[Front of Walgreens. Multiple people wait in line in order to get the COVID-19 vaccination. The Walgreens Bouncer is looking at his list.]
MAN WITH GREEN COAT
Come on, man. We've been waiting for hours. You guys have plenty of vaccinations in there, just let us in, man.
WALGREENS BOUNCER
55 and older and first responders only. [Mr. Mackey and Adler arrive in front of Walgreens]
MR. MACKEY
Oh, uh, hey, uh, we'd like to get in there and get some vaccinations, mkay.
WALGREENS BOUNCER
Are you on the list?
MR. MACKEY
Well, no, I'm not on the list. I tried to get on the list. I sat on my computer 30 nights in a row trying to make a vaccination appointment and get on the God damn list. Look, the thing is, we are school faculty, mkay. You gotta let us in.
STEPHEN STOTCH
[from the back of the line] No, no, you have to let in people with health issues first! I'm a chain smoker and my wife is 39 pounds overweight.
UNNAMED MAN 1
I have a compromised immune system! I have genital warts, and I will show them to you.
WALGREENS BOUNCER
[now looking at the back of the line] Over 55, first responders and Group 2B only [he turns his look back to the list]. Now beat it [another unnamed man approaches the bouncer]!
UNNAMED MAN 2
Hey, hey, man, I'm a friend of Dan Roberts -- he's a dental assistant in conifer...
WALGREENS BOUNCER
Get the fuck outta here. I said you're not gettin' in! You're wasting your time! [an old woman approaches the entrance] Oh, hello, ma'am. Right this way. [the bouncers opens the stanchion and lets the old woman in]
EVERYONE IN LINE
Awwww!
ELDERLY WOMAN
[on her way inside she raises both her hands and shows the middle fingers to the crowd] 79, bitchessss!
EVERYONE IN LINE
Boo!
MAN WITH GREEN COAT
You suck. You suck you stupid old people!
[A black screen appears writing "Vaccination Special". The screen fades away and South Park Elementary is shown. Kyle and Stan are washing their hands at the wash stations in the hallways.]
CARTMAN
[from the back] Stan, Kyle, can you come over here real quick?
STAN
Recess is almost over, dude.
CARTMAN
Just come here please, it's important.
[South Park Elementary Bathrooms. Kenny McCormick looks sad and Cartman approaches him, while Stan and Kyle remain in the back.]
CARTMAN
Hey, Kenny. I got the guys, okay? You wanna talk or you want me to talk?
KENNY
(You can talk.)
CARTMAN
[while looking at Stan and Kyle] You guys, Kenny and I are feeling like, even though things are supposedly getting better with the pandemic, we're more depressed than ever. [Cartman and Kenny turn around to Stan and Kyle and Cartman lowers down his mask] The four of us just seem really different towards each other and we're worried the past year has put a strain to our broship. Kenny was saying he wants to do everything he can to save the broship, and I agree with him. So we had a really positive talk about it during lunch, and Kenny shared some ideas of how maybe we can navigate through this, and I think we came up with a great idea. Okay, so, you know how chicks have periods right?
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
It's true! Women have "periods" where they bleed from their vagina. Remember earlier today, Stan, you said our teacher was wearing white? So when we talked I said to Kenny "Oh, what if the teacher got her period?" which cheered us up a bit and then we realized today was hamburger day for lunch. There was lots of ketchup laying around. So me and Kenny snuck into the classroom during recess and put it on the teacher's chair, and now when we get back to class there's gonna be a bunch of ketchup [Stan and Kyle look at each other] on the teacher's chair and when she stands up it's gonna totally look like she got her period! [Kenny laughs] It's going to be amazing, you guys. I'm so excited!
[Classroom. The bell rings and the teacher, Mrs. Nelson, arrives in class.]
MRS. NELSON
Okay, class. Hope everyone had a good lunch. [Cartman struggles to hold in his laughter] Okay, how did everyone do on their fractions? Are there any questions? [Mrs. Nelson approaches her desk] I know the last few were a little tricky. [she sits on the chair and a squish sound it's heard]
CARTMAN
[barely holding his laugh and whispering] Shh! Kyle, Kyle! Shhh! [Kyle rolls his eyes]
BEBE
Mrs. Nelson, I couldn't figure out number 14.
MRS. NELSON
Number 14. Okay. Well, let's look at it together. [Mrs. Nelson gets up from her chair and when she turns around, a big red stain is seen on her back on the skirt.]
KIDS
Ewwwwww! [Cartman and Kenny laugh loudly]
MRS. NELSON
What? [she sees the stain and panics] What? What is -- What is this?
CARTMAN
Oh, my God. [Cartman points at her and takes out his phone, starting to film her] Teacher had her period. [he and Kenny continue to laugh loudly]
MRS. NELSON
[embarrassed] Kids, something must be wrong with me. [she starts to panic even more when Cartman and Kenny can't stop laughing] Is this a prank?
CARTMAN
[continuing to film with his phone] That's nasty, teacher. Don't have your period during class time!
MRS. NELSON
[in the same panic state] Do you think this is funny? I come here, and I risk my life to teach you? And I can't even get a vaccination because teachers aren't important enough?! [Cartman and Kenny stop laughing] And I get on the websites and can't even get a straight answer on when I'll get vaccinated?! Well, I'm over it! [she opens the classroom door] I can't do this anymore! [she leaves the classroom]
CARTMAN
You guys, I think that might have been the single most hilarious thing we've ever done.
[The boys walk along the street past the Stotch residence, coming from school. Cartman looks on his phone.]
CARTMAN
Which one should we post, you guys? Should we post the one where you can see the most blood on teacher's ass or the one where she makes the dumbest face?
KYLE
[the boys suddenly stop, right in front of Butters' house] You're not posting anything! Do you have any idea what you've done?
KENNY
(What do you mean, dude?)
STAN
Yeah, we finally get back to school and have some sense of normalcy and you guys make the teacher walk out!
CARTMAN
Hey, at least Kenny and I were doing something to try and get that spark back. You know 30 percent of broships didn't make it through the pandemic?
KYLE
What if they make us go back to remote learning?! I don't want to go back to being quarantined at home like some of the other kids still are!
BUTTERS
[from the window] Hey, fellas! [the boys turn around facing the house] Anything fun happen at school today?!
CARTMAN
Yeah, you missed it! It was the best thing ever! [shows the phone] We put ketchup in the teacher's seat and made her think it was her period!
BUTTERS
Oh, my gosh! That sounds like so much fun!
CARTMAN
Yeah, pretty much greatest day of our lives.
STAN
[turns to the boys] Do you guys know how hard it's going to be for them to find us a replacement teacher?
CARTMAN
It's not gonna be hard. They'll bring in some lame ass teacher who's desperate to work. How bad can it be?
[Main Street, a bus arrives. Mr. Garrison gets out of the bus.]
MR. GARRISON
[very excited] Oh... I'm baaack! Hey, South Park! I'm home!
UNNAMED MAN 3
[surprised] Holy shit, is that who I think it is?
BUS DRIVER
[from the bus] Any luggage from below, sir?
MR. GARRISON
Oh, yes, I've got a lot of baggage!
[Mr. Garrison walks along the street carrying his baggage behind him.]
MR. GARRISON
Hey! Hey, Valmer! How're you doing? [camera turns to Valmer residence where Ryan is staring at Garrison in shock] Tucker! Lookin' good! [points at Thomas, who is watering his front lawn and who's also staring at Garrison in shock] Oh it's so great to see everybody [Sheila takes out the trash in the back and the camera turns to Thompson's residence]
THOMPSON
[from the window] Hey! Fuck you!
MR. GARRISON
Hey, hey, lookin' good, Thompson! Did your wife get that AIDS test?!
[South Park Elementary, principal's office. Mr. Garrison speaks with PC Principal and Strong Woman.]
MR. GARRISON
You know, the simple truth is, teaching is my life. [PC Principal and Strong Woman look at each other] I'm just completely at home in the classroom. [they look at Garrison again] I realize that now more than ever after my little sabbatical.
PC PRINCIPAL
Yes... Your, sabbatical was somewhat controversial.
MR. GARRISON
Well, I just went through a little thing. You know, I... I realized I was gay. And then I realized I wasn't gay, I was a woman. And after I transitioned, I thought it was a little mistake and then I went through a phase of being the President of the United States.
PC PRINCIPAL
Well, that is the problem, Mr. Garrison, as someone who previously identified as President, there could be safety issues.
MR. GARRISON
Oh, that's not a problem. Anyone who has been President is assigned secret service for the rest of their lives to keep them protected. [looks at the door] Mr. Service! [an agent looking-man with no pants on him arrives and Garrison presents him to the principals] This is my private security, Mr. Service.
MR. SERVICE
Hello.
PC PRINCIPAL
Uh, thank you for your application, Mr. Garrison. We'll keep you in mind as a backup, but hopefully the vaccination process is going to start opening up.
[Walgreens, the generic club song can still be heard.]
MAN WITH GREEN COAT
Come on, man, it's ridiculous that people can't get in.
MAN WITH BURGUNDY COAT
Yeah, you know, in Israel they vaccinate everybody. Israel's way cooler than this lame place!
WALGREENS BOUNCER
So then go to Israel.
MAN WITH BURGUNDY COAT
I tried... I couldn't get in. [camera switches to Chris]
CHRIS
Tom, I'm outside of the hottest place in town, and what we'd like to do now is take you [moves near the bouncer] for an exclusive look inside.
WALGREENS BOUNCER
You're not getting in, pal
CHRIS
[still looking at the camera] I'm actually willing to go inside and get a shot so that everyone can see just how safe it is.
WALGREENS BOUNCER
I said get lost, you're not getting in. [Chris looks at the bouncer] Get outta my face.
CHRIS
Please give me a shot. [looks back at the camera] Please, all I want is a shot. [looks back the at bouncer] Just that one shot that could change everything.
WALGREENS BOUNCER
[moving Chris aside] Everyone clear outta the way. Clear the entrance. We have VIPs coming out. [the bouncer opens the stanchion and a bunch of elderly people exit the building]
ELDERLY PEOPLE
Whoo-hoo!
ELDERLY MAN 1
Where to next, everybody?
ELDERLY MAN 2
That was our second shot. Let's go out to the bars!
ELDERLY PEOPLE
Yeah!
STEPHEN STOTCH
[from the back of the line] Old people suck!
ELDERLY MAN 3
Hah? Can't hear ya. Got too many antibodies in my ears!
ELDERLY PEOPLE
Hahahaha!
[Stan walks to the school but he's stopped by a car full of old people, including his grandfather, Marvin]
MARVIN
Hey there, Billy! Still gotta wear that mask, huh? We're all vaccinated now. I'm gonna go out to the bars and get some pussy!
STAN
Okay, grandpa.
ELDERLY MEN
Yeahhhh!
MARVIN'S FRIEND 1
Sayyy... When are they gonna vaccinate you kids? Oh, yeah! You're last! [the elderly people begin to laugh]
MARVIN
Have fun social distancing, loser! [the car drives away; multiple kids can be seen entering the school in the background]
[South Park Elementary, classroom. The bell just rang and everyone goes to their sits.]
CARTMAN
Hey, broships. You ready for some substitute teacher action? This should be fun!
MR. GARRISON
[entering the class] Hey, kids! Guess who's baaaaaaaaack?
EVERYONE
[upset] Awwwwww! Yuck!
MR. GARRISON
Well, I know you've all had a lot of time off this past year.
CARTMAN
Oh, dear Christ, what have we done?
MR. GARRISON
But it's time to get you all back on track. Now, I expect discipline and respect in this classroom -- both to me and your new teacher's assistant, Mr. Service. [Mr. Service arrives] Hand these papers out, Mr. Service. [hands him the papers and slaps his ass]
[The bell rings. The children leave the classroom, pissed at Cartman, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny for what they did.]
LOLA
Nice going, you dumb cocks!
RED
Stupid assholes!
SCOTT
You guys are dicks.
CARTMAN
Wow, people are really pissed at us for doing the period joke, you guys.
KYLE
Why do people think we all did the period joke?
CARTMAN
Well, because I told them we all did. People know we're bros and that we do everything together!
KYLE
You guys are gonna go and tell everyone the truth about who's fault this is! I didn't do anything!
CARTMAN
That's right, Kyle, you did nothing. You knew about the prank, you could have stopped it at any time, but you didn't say a word. Silence is violence, Kyle.
KYLE
What?! Dude! [to Stan] Are you just gonna stand there and listen to this crap?!
STAN
I don't even know what to do! If you ask me, this whole pandemic has been a giant waste of time! [leaves]
CARTMAN
Oh, my God... Maybe our broship didn't survive.
KYLE
Will you shut up about that!? Nobody cares about your stupid broship! [Kenny starts to cry and leaves, while Cartman and Kyle sadly look at him]
CARTMAN
[to Kyle] And now you've made Kenny cry. [Cartman leaves]
[Walgreens. People still wait in line.]
WALGREENS BOUNCER
[looking at his list] Nope... Nope... [looking at the Underpants Gnomes] I don't see you anywhere on the list.
GNOME 1
It's "Gnomes", "Underpants Gnomes".
GNOME 2
We are essential workers!
DR. ALPHONSE MEPHESTO
[from the back of the line] Yeah, yeah. Get in line with the rest of us!
WALGREENS BOUNCER
Is anybody here actually on the list?! [Mr. Mackey arrives dressed as a fireman]
MR. MACKEY
Uh, yes it's uh, Tom, Fireman Tom, mkay.
WALGREENS BOUNCER
Will you fucking get lost, pal?
MR. MACKEY
I don't know what you're talking about!
WALGREENS BOUNCER
Alright, that's it.
MR. MACKEY
I'm a hero of the community. [the bouncer moves Mr. Mackey aside] I'm Fireman Tom!
[Food 4 Little. A car containing several old people drives past.]
ELDERLY PEOPLE
Yeehhhh! Partyyy!
[Inside the store. Mr. Garrison shops alongside Mr. Service.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, let's see... Scissors, paper, glue. Ah! Some good old fashioned number 2 pencils. That's what my students need. Mr. Service, can you grab a couple boxes of those pencils over there? [people in the store look at Garrison]
UNNAMED SHOPPER
Would you look at that? He ruined our entire country and now he's just back like nothing happened.
MR. GARRISON
Okay, I think that's all the school supplies we need. Let's grab some healthy snacks for the class snack basket. [everyone continues to angrily look at Garrison and he notices them] Oh. Oh, I see. Look, everyone, there's a gay man shopping! I happen to be the only teacher brave enough to teach your kids right now, so you better all get real woke real fast! Come on, Mr. Service! [goes to the produce section and grabs an apple; the Whites arrive]
BOB WHITE
Uh, hey! Excuse me?! [Mr. Service blocks the way] Hey, uh, I'm not sure if you remember me. Bob White? I just want you to know I was always on your side. In fact, all of us Whites were really on your side.
MR. GARRISON
Look, I'm just a teacher. Okay? Just a teacher, I'm shopping for my class.
BOB WHITE
[comes closer to Garrison] So, look, uh, what are we supposed to do now? You know, I'm a follower of QAnon. What are we supposed to do to stop the vaccinations? They're vaccinating people right now, seeding people with their microchips! Surely, you have a plan?! We're on the internet every night waiting for word.
MR. GARRISON
The word is get a fucking life, jackass! Blow shit out your dickhole! [walks away along with Mr. Service, leaving the White family confused]
BOB WHITE
Did you hear that, honey? He said 'shit... out your dickhole'... He's trying to give us some kind of signal.
[South Park Elementary, Mr. Mackey's office.]
MR. MACKEY
Think my life doesn't matter!? I show you what matters. [packing up his books] Counselors matter. That's what matters. Let's just see how your God damn school functions without a God damn counselor! [the sound of a motorcycle is heard outside] Oh, God dammit. [walks up to the window] Hey! Hey, you damn old people! [an elderly man is making drifts with his motorcycle in the school's parking lot, while an old woman looks at him] Stop doing donuts in the school parking lot!
ELDERLY MAN ON MOTORCYCLE
Hah?
MR. MACKEY
I said you old people need to -- [the elderly man revs his engine, making an even louder noise and the old woman joins him on the motorcycle, while showing Mr. Mackey the middle finger before leaving the parking lot; Mr. Mackey returns to his desk] Fucking old people rubbing everyone's noses in their fun times! [a knocking on the door is heard] What?! [Kenny comes in, sad]
KENNY
[sighs] (I've been having a lot of problems with my friends. It just seems like the pandemic exposed problems we didn't even know were there. To be honest, I'm not sure that I even see a future with these guys.)
MR. MACKEY
What?! [Cartman opens the door]
CARTMAN
Hey, Kenny. Guys? Guys, come on. You agreed to counseling. [Stan and Kyle arrive and Cartman closes the door behind them] Hey, Mr. Mackey. We, uh, we've been having a lot of problems and um, we all want to work on our broship, don't we guys?
STAN
Yes.
KYLE
Yes.
CARTMAN
You know this pandemic has been a pressure cooker, and we just feel like we're going through the brotions. You know?
KYLE
[points at Cartman and Kenny] Because you guys pulled a prank and made the teacher leave, and now everybody hates us.
CARTMAN
Silence is violence, Kyle. Silence is violence.
MR. MACKEY
Guess what, boys? I don't care. I come here and I listen to you kids bitch about your stupid problems everyday and I'm 50 years old! [punching the table] I could die tomorrow from this Covid shit!
STAN
Please, Mr. Mackey, we just want to get our old teacher back for everybody, okay? Can you just tell her we're really, really sorry?
MR. MACKEY
It's not that simple. There's only one way you're getting your teacher back, and that's if teachers get their hands on the vaccine. [the boys look at each other]
CARTMAN
How do we do that? [Mr. Mackey walks up to the window and stares outside]
MR. MACKEY
There's a place in town... Very hard to get into. Very exclusive. Walgreens. I've tried to get in many times... Dressed like a fireman, mkay. Dressed like a little ol' lady, but they got security up the ass. [turns around to the boys] You find a way inside, get all the vaccines you can and bring them here to the school. You do that, and you just might get your teacher back. Mkay. [the boys again look at each other]
[The Whites' residence's basement, night. Bob White gathered up several QAnon followers.]
BOB WHITE
My friends, these are very dangerous times. Our country's future is at a precipice. And that is why I have called together every QAnon follower in our town.
QANON FOLLOWER 1
Let's forget it, Bob. The bad guys won.
QANON FOLLOWER 2
I feel like someone pooped on my life.
BOB WHITE
They didn't win! We just recently received a new coded message.
FEMALE QANON TUTOR
You got a message from Q?
BOB WHITE
Not from Q... From the chosen one. [everyone gasps] Yes, we saw him. In the produce section of the grocery store. And he said to me... "Blow shit out your dickhole." I immediately knew something was amiss, because one can't move feces through their penile urinary tract! So I've been going over it and over it and I realized [proceeds to show them a chart full of conspiracy theories] Blow shit out dick hole - BSDH. We all know what BS is, but DH? It didn't make sense. Until my wife reminded me that DH are the initials of David Harris, the anon from Akron, Ohio who said that the elite use Latin to send coded messages. Out your dick hole -- Anno Yanis Domini Homme. Do what he does. The chosen is teaching now. He's taking Q's message straight to the children. And he wants us to do the same.
QANON FOLLOWER 1
We're supposed to be teachers?
BOB WHITE
There's an incredible shortage of teachers right now. He's trying to tell us that this is our time to strike! The elite want to fuck with our kids? We'll fuck theirs! [everyone cheers]
[Walgreens. People still wait in line. The boys arrive along with an old woman in a wheelchair.]
STAN
Hello, sir!
WALGREENS BOUNCER
Who are you?
CARTMAN
Oh, hey, hi. We're with the nonprofit service Kids for Kommunity. Both spelled with a K.
STAN
Yeah, we assist senior citizens who need the vaccine, but then need help getting to the right place.
WALGREENS BOUNCER
Oh, really? That's pretty damn awesome you guys. I wish more people could be like the Kommunity Kidz. Go on in. [the bouncers opens the stanchion and lets them in]
EVERYONE IN LINE
Awwww! Come on!
MAN WITH GREEN COAT
Hey, I'm in Kommunity Kidz, too! [the boys are inside the building]
STAN
Holy shit, dude. That was pretty easy!
CARTMAN
Yeah bros! Kommunity Kidz spelled with a K. Gets 'em every time.
ELDERLY WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR
Alright, so where's my Goddamn money?
KYLE
What?!
ELDERLY WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR
I told you I already got the vaccine. I'm doin' this for the cash!
KYLE
Yeah, but we already paid you.
ELDERLY WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR
Oh, I must have Alzheimer's, I'm just an olllld lady. [changes tone] Pay again or I squeal.
CARTMAN
You God damn old bitch!
STAN
Just pay her, Cartman.
CARTMAN
What?!
STAN
Come on, the pharmacist is coming!
CARTMAN
This is becoming the most expensive period joke we ever did! [the pharmacist arrives, carrying a tray of vaccines]
WALGREENS PHARMACIST
Excuse me, what are you children doing in here?
KYLE
We're Kommunity Kidz. We help seniors get vaccinated.
WALGREENS PHARMACIST
Oh, well that's very great. These boys are helping you, ma'am?
ELDERLY WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR
Oh, actually I'm not sure. I have a little Alzheimer's. Might need a little more greenback to jar my memory.
CARTMAN
Oh, you fucking slut! This is why we keep old people in the back of the line!
KYLE
Cartman, just stick to the fucking plan!
STAN
Oh, great, Kyle. Now he knows there's a plan!
WALGREENS PHARMACIST
What plan?!
ELDERLY WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR
They're lying about Kommunity Kidz!
WALGREENS PHARMACIST
It's community with a C like normal?!
STAN
Kenny, grab the vaccines! [kicks the pharmacist in the leg, while Kenny grabs the tray of vaccines and they run out of the building]
KYLE
RUN!!
STAN
Go, go, go, go!!
MAN WITH GREEN COAT
Hey...
UNNAMED MAN 4
[pointing at the boys] Kommunity Kidz have vaccines!
[Malkinson residence. The family discusses in the kitchen, while Scott eats cereals.]
CLARK
For the last time, Ellen, I don't want our son going to that public school! Mr. Garrison is a terrible teacher, he has no grip on the classroom and he's the worst president we've ever had!
ELLEN
But Scott has to go to school, dear.
CLARK
So we can get him a private tutor!
ELLEN
We can't afford a private tutor, you know that. [Richard Tweak opens the door with a cup of coffee in his hand]
RICHARD
Hey, guys, what's the problem? [Ellen and Clark turn to Richard]
CLARK
It's that son of a bitch Mr.Garrison. He's gonna completely screw up our kids.
RICHARD
Well, that's why we pulled Tweek out of school. Haven't you heard? There's a brand new private tutoring company that's fast and affordable!
[An advertisement of the tutor company appears.]
ADVERTISER
Has your child fallen behind in school? [multiple pictures of children are shown] Do you feel like the government has failed you and your child during the time of Covid? [the message is also written on the ad, then switches to one of the Tutornon members with the US flag behind him]
TUTORNON MEMBER 1
Then call us! The tutors at Tutornon! [music starts playing; the female QAnon tutor is seen in a girl's room]
FEMALE QANON TUTOR
Forget the classroom! Tutornon is bespoke learning that is straight from the internet [points at the computer] to your child. [then points to the girl; camera changes to another Tutornon member who sits at his desk]'
TUTORNON MEMBER 1
We sift through all the information on the internet and present it to your child for a uniquely curated experience. [camera switches to Bob White in front of his residence, holding a laptop in one hand and several masks in the other]
BOB WHITE
Forget all the Zooms and masks and social distancing at school. [throws the laptop and the masks in a garbage can; the ad switches again to the US flag background and the Tutornon are all shown] Let Tutornon save your child. Literally!
ADVERTISER
Contact Tutornon today! On Facebook, YouTube and Twitter!
[Malkinson residence, Scott's room. Scott is painting when Clark enters his room.]
CLARK
Alright, Scott. Your new tutor is here. [Jake Angeli arrives]
JAKE ANGELI
Hey, there! Ready to get back on track with your schoolwork?
SCOTT
I guess so.
CLARK
You better pay attention and listen to everything he has to teach you!
JAKE ANGELI
We'll be great, thanks! [Clark closes the door and leaves; Jake Angeli closes all the curtains in the room] Alright, sit down. We don't have much time!
SCOTT
Huh?
JAKE ANGELI
Tom Hanks and Oprah are just two at the very top of an elite group of people who control everything we see and do. They feed upon children in order to maintain their elite status, and that isn't the worst of it. Do you know what pedophilia is? Here, let me show you.
SCOTT
[scarily screams] Daaad?!
[Walgreens. The same news anchor is presenting.]
CHRIS
Tom, I'm standing outside the ultra-exclusive Walgreens where earlier today vaccines were taken by that group of young Robin Hoods, the Kommunity Kidz. These brave kids have taken it into their own hands to get people a shot. That's all people want, just a shot, and these boys have made it so you just might get that shot. And have a chance at hope and some happiness in this [gets angry] -- in this shit world -- [is interrupted by the newscaster]
TOM
Okay, thank you, Chris. We'll get back -- [is interrupted by Chris]
CHRIS
[still angry] No! No! Fuck you, Tom, because Kommunity Kidz are just what this town and this world needed! And it's amazing that some kids took some God damn time to actually go out and do something. Fuck you, Tom. [drops the mic and leaves]
[South Park Elementary. The bell rings. Mr. Garrison arrives in class.]
MR. GARRISON
Alright, children, let's take our seats. [starts writing on the board] Today is standardized testing. [Mr. Service walks in and surveys the class] We're gonna make sure you lazy ducks have still been studying through this whole pandemic.
MR. SERVICE
Sir?
MR. GARRISON
Yes, Mr. Service? [Mr. Service directs his gaze to the class, and Garrison is alarmed when he sees the whole class empty except for Jimmy and Bebe] Where the hell is everybody? [they don't answer] I said, where are my students?! Bebe! [points at her] You always know where Wendy is! Where is she?!
BEBE
I think... her parents pulled her out school and get her a private tutor.
MR. GARRISON
[angry] A private tutor?! Why would they get a private tutor?!
BEBE
Umm..., I'm pretty sure it's because her parents hate you?
MR. GARRISON
What makes you think that?!
BEBE
Because I was talking to them about it... Because... I hate you too.
MR. GARRISON
I am trying to get things back to normal around here! [turns and grabs Mr. Service and speaks to him] Why is everyone acting like this?! Why is everyone against me?!
MR. SERVICE
I don't know, sir.
MR. GARRISON
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this! Come on, Mr. Service! [grabs Mr. Service by his tie and leaves classroom]
[Mrs. Nelson's house. She sits on the sofa when her cellphone rings. She answers.]
MRS. NELSON
Hello?
CARTMAN
[from his living room; Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are also there with the vaccines] Hi, Mrs. Nelson, it's Eric Cartman.
MRS. NELSON
[annoyed] What do you want?
CARTMAN
Mrs. Nelson, we would like for you to come back to school tomorrow, because... we have COVID-19 vaccinations.
MRS. NELSON
Really? You think I'm gonna let you prank me again? I heard you were the ones responsible for the period prank!
CARTMAN
And it was so uncalled for and so wrong. I mean, especially because we're guys. I mean, dudes sitting around coming up with period jokes, like, how old are we? Seriously?
MRS. NELSON
Yeah, I don't trust you. I'll just wait until the government decides teachers are important enough to get their vaccinations.
CARTMAN
You are so important. Which is why it was so not funny what we did. I mean, what is funny about blood coming out of a woman's vagina? Like, it's sexist, first of all, and you know what else? It's just lazy. Just like dialing it in, that's what we were doing. We were just dialing it in.
MRS. NELSON
You better be at school tomorrow morning, and you better really have vaccinations. For all the teachers!
CARTMAN
Hey, we will be there. Period. [chuckling] Okay. Okay, cool. Bye. [hangs up and burst out laughing] Did you guys hear what I said?
KYLE
[angry] Why did you almost blow it at the very end, you idiot?!
CARTMAN
Relax, guys. She's gonna come.
KYLE
[walks up to Stan] Will you please say something to him?!
STAN
[angry] What the hell did I do?!
KENNY
[steps in between them to calm them] (You guys stop it! Stop it!) [outside Cartman's window a man is heard singing]
MAN WITH BURGUNDY COAT
This is my moment
This is my tiiiiimmmmeeee...
Hello?
[The boys walk to the window where they see several people asking for shots, many of them which were waiting in line at Walgreens]
MAN WITH BURGUNDY COAT
I've got a dream to fulfill
And all I need is a shot!
Please
Please just gimme a shot!
MAN WITH GREEN COAT
Listen, Kommunity Kidz!
All I want is a shot!
A-and you can give me that shot!
That one shot, that's all I need!
NEED A SHOT WOMAN SINGER
All I want is a shot, too!
If I had a shot, I would make the most of it!
CROWD
Gimme a shot! Please I need a shot!
GUITAR SINGER
If I just had a shot
I would make it the best shot
CARTMAN
Wow, everyone just really wants a shot. [Stephen Stotch joins the crowd along with his wife]
STEPHEN
Kommunity Kidz, please! If you just give me a shot, why I could be somebody! I could go out to fancy restaurants like all them old people. And eat shrimp as big as my head!
MAN WITH GREEN COAT
[to Stephen] You're not taking my shot. This is my shot!
MAN WITH BURGUNDY COAT
I, I have to have this shot! [the crowd begins to shout indistinctly, asking for shots]
KYLE
[to the boys] Grab the vaccines. I think we better get outta here. [the crowd tries to break into the house]
[A Tutornon lesson. A Hollywood sign covered in blood is shown.]
FEMALE QANON TUTOR
This is a fact. We are all being controlled by an elite, wealthy, and privileged few. [Jeffrey Epstein is shown handcuffed and carried by the police] When Jeffrey Epstein the billionaire was found guilty of sex trafficking, he was set to squeal on all the elites in Hollywood and in Washington who used his child sex services... [Jeffrey Epstein is then shown hanged in his cell] But Epstein was found dead in his cell from "suicide". Why do the elites want children from sex traffickers? Adrenochrome. [a plastic bag of it is shown] It is harvested from children for a euphoric and life-enhancing benefit. [a child victim is shown being sawed to bits by one doctor while another operate on his brain, while being supervised a group of hooded monk-like men - these are acolytes] This Satanic cabal of Hollywood and political elites all need the adrenochrome to maintain their positions of power. [Oprah is shown, holding a big goblet of blood in her hands, enjoying it, while a victim child is shown behind her, having been gutted] And they will continue to do so until we stand up against them. [Hillary and a random elderly guy are shown drinking the blood of their victims through straws, while their acolytes collect the blood of a child in the back; Obama is then shown directly drinking blood from a cut victim; Craig's room is then shown with the tutor sitting next to him] Now, do you have any questions, Craig?
CRAIG
Um... so does Oprah drink the same blood as Obama, or is it usually a different kid?
FEMALE QANON TUTOR
It's kids from all over the world. Now... it's time for me to tell you the biggest thing that the Hollywood elites don't want you to know -- [Mr. Garrison forcefully opens the door; he's accompanied by Mr. Service]
MR. GARRISON
Alright, just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
FEMALE QANON TUTOR
[surprised] Oh! [stands up]
MR. GARRISON
Go tutor someone else! You think you can take my students from my classroom?!
FEMALE QANON TUTOR
[in shock] Oh, my God! It's you! [smiles]
MR. GARRISON
That's right, it's me! The head teacher at South Park Elementary! And this is what I think of private tutors! Get her, Mr. Service! [Mr. Service starts beating her and pins her to the floor, strangling her neck] Now who's in charge of all you tutors?!
FEMALE QANON TUTOR
[choking] It's... it's secret...
MR. GARRISON
Choke her out, Mr. Service!
FEMALE QANON TUTOR
No! Please!
MR. GARRISON
Who started this bogus tutoring company?!
FEMALE QANON TUTOR
[still choking] It was... it...
MR. GARRISON
I'm listening!
FEMALE QANON TUTOR
It was... the Whitessss. [Mr. Service stops from strangling her; she remains unconscious]
MR. GARRISON
The Whites? That guy was harassing me at the grocery store! Come on, Mr. Service. It's time to deal with the Whites. [Mr. Garrison leaves along with Mr. Service; Craig remained shocked through the entire scene]
CRAIG
[sighs] I guess 2021 is gonna be just like 2020.
[Raisins, broken down and abandoned. The boys are hiding inside with the vaccines. Stan is looking out the window.]
KYLE
All good?
STAN
[walking up to Kyle] I don't see anybody. I think we're safe here until school starts in the morning.
KENNY
(We're actually gonna sleep here?)
KYLE
I don't see what choice we have.
CARTMAN
[looking at his phone] Oh, my God.
STAN
[turns to look at Cartman] What?
CARTMAN
[looks up at the boys] You guys, oh my God, seriously.
KYLE
[irritated] What?
CARTMAN
[stands up] You guys know Mr. Lawson? Jenny Lawson's dad?
KENNY
(Yeah?)
CARTMAN
[points to his phone] He's offering us 2,000 bucks for a vaccination.
KYLE
[angrily] What are you doing?
CARTMAN
Dude, people really want their shot. I'm asking around to see what they're willing to pay for it. I'm a little Harvey Weinstein.
KYLE
[points outside] We are giving these to the teachers at the school!
CARTMAN
Kyle, this is what our broship needs! We can sell these and go on vacations together, go to shows and theme parks!
KYLE
[glaring at Cartman] What the broship needs is for us to do the right thing and fix the problem of everyone hating us! [the rest of the boys are silent for a moment] Right, Stan?
STAN
I say we take the vaccines ourselves. I mean, why are us kids last? This whole pandemic has been about doing what's best for adults. Maybe for the broship we do what's best for us.
CARTMAN
What's best for us is thousands of dollars. That's always what's best!
KYLE
[angrily] You guys are being selfish! You're not thinking about what's best for the broship. You're thinking about what's best for you. We did all this because we wanted to fix the damage of the period prank. That means taking these to the school tomorrow morning for our teachers. [walks up to the tray with the vaccines; he picks it up] I'm gonna put these somewhere safe so no one gets tempted to do the wrong thing!
CARTMAN
[looks at Stan] I don't know why you don't stand up to him more, it's really disappointing.
[Stan stares after Cartman as he walks away. Kyle enters the back room, carrying the tray with the vaccines. His cellphone rings. He sets the vaccines on a stool.]
KYLE
[looking at his phone] Oh, crap. [he taps his phone screen] Hey, dad. Look, I'm okay. I won't be home until tomorrow 'cause... well, I'm doing something really important.
GERALD
[nonchalant] Oh, okay, Kyle. Sounds good! Thanks, buddy!
KYLE
[confused] You're not... worried?
GERALD
Hey, we trust you, Kyle! [pause] Say, Kyle, we heard you have some COVID-19 vaccinations.
KYLE
[annoyed] They're for our teachers.
GERALD
Oh, okay. Yeah, that makes sense. You know, if you think your teacher is worth saving more than us...
KYLE
It's not like that.
GERALD
Well, it sounds like that! Sounds like your teacher's life is more important than your mom and dad's! [camera turns to Kyle, looking annoyed as he listens on his phone] You know, when all this went down, the school wasn't really there for you, was it? [Kyle rests his head on the wall in frustration] School kind of abandoned you kids. But your parents, well... we didn't shove you off into a Zoom meeting, did we?
KYLE
Dad, please don't-
GERALD
You know, we're not spring chickens anymore. [his voice saddens] The virus is still out there, Kyle, and it's still killing people. I don't know how you'd feel if mom or me got COVID and died in these last few months because you did nothing. Don't do nothing, Kyle. You know what, Kyle?
KYLE
[closing his eyes] Please don't say it.
GERALD
Silence is violence, Kyle. Don't kill mom, buddy. [he hangs up]
KYLE
[lowers his phone] Shit.
[Whites' residence, night time. The family is eating dinner when the doorbell rings.]
BOB
Go get that will you, Crystal? [Crystal gets up and opens the front door; Mr. Garrison and Mr. Service are there]
BOB
Who is it, sweetheart?
CRYSTAL
It's the savior of our country and still president of the United States who was impeached unjustly.
MR. GARRISON
[angry] Get them, Mr. Service!
CRYSTAL
[Mr. Service lunges at her and she screams] Aah!
BOB
[The family is now tied up in the living room] What's this all about? Did we do something wrong?
MR. GARRISON
[turning to face the family] God damn right you did something wrong! Our public school system is dying and you tutors are trying to take advantage of it!
BOB
But we were just trying to be like you!
MR. GARRISON
You'll never be like me! I've been a teacher for 30 years! I'm just trying to get my old life back and assholes keep getting in my way!
BOB
But we have to tell children the truth! They have to know!
MR. GARRISON
They have to know what!?
BOB
About-- about the whole thing! About the vaccinations! That the pandemic was blown out of proportion!
CRYSTAL
That Venezuelan socialists switched out circuit boards from voting machines in 12 states!
BOB
Good, sweetie! [he looks back up at Mr. Garrison] Don't you understand everything is being manipulated!
MR. GARRISON
[turns around] Everyone's being manipulated... So that's why everyone in town is being such an inconsiderate jerk about me coming back?
BOB
Yes. They don't want people to like you. They need people to hate you!
MR. GARRISON
Who are they?
BOB
They're the elites. They do whatever they want and they feed on the pain and torture of children! And if anybody starts to care, they'll just cut us off when we tell the truth! And the truth is that -- [scene cuts away]
[Raisins, morning time. Kyle is in the back room. He pours two of the vaccines into a cup and refills them with Cactus Cooler, looking around to make sure he isn't seen. Stan appears in the background suddenly.]
STAN
Kyle? [Kyle, startled, drops the can of Cactus Cooler and tries to hide the vaccine] What are you doing?
KYLE
[panicked] I'm just getting things ready to go.
STAN
[walking towards Kyle] So then why are you replacing some of the vaccines with Cactus Cooler?
KYLE
Alright, Stan, look. It's just the pressure of everything, okay!? My dad called and... I don't want my mom to die.
STAN
[angry] I don't want my mom to die either! I can't believe that you would lie to me. That you would hide shit from me.
KENNY
[walking into the doorway] (Hey, guys, what's going on?)
KYLE
[he and Stan look away] Nothing, Kenny. Everything's fine.
STAN
[still looking angry] Yeah, we're gonna go to the school now, buddy.
KENNY
(Okay.) [he walks away]
STAN
[walking towards Kyle] I'm just gonna try and pretend this didn't happen. But only because it's what's best for Kenny. [he turns and walks away]
[South Park Elementary, daytime. The boys are walking towards the school with the vaccines.]
CARTMAN
I can't believe we're actually doing this. There are people out there who really need these vaccines -- who have cash.
STAN
I just want this over with. Let's get these stupid things to the teachers and go home.
[Scott Malkinson jumps into frame, blocking the boys.]
SCOTT
I don't think so, Kommunity Kidz! You're not poisoning anybody with those vaccinations!
CARTMAN
The fuck are you talking about, Scott?
SCOTT
I've learned the truth! And I won't let you hurt the teacher!
STAN
We don't have time for this, Scott. [the boys walk towards Scott Malkinson]
SCOTT
You don't understand! I'm part of a militant group now! A secret cabal of patriot children! [he unzips his jacket, revealing a Lil' Qties shirt underneath] Lil' Qties!
CARTMAN
Lil' Qties? With a "Q" and an apostrophe after the "L"? That's way better than Kommunity Kids, guys. I told you, we're getting lazy.
SCOTT
[pulls out a walkie talkie] Move in on my position, Qties!
[A large group of students move into frame, all wearing Lil' Qties shirts.]
CLYDE
You're not hurting our teacher again!
LIL' QTIES BLONDE GIRL
You don't even know what those vaccines are doing to people!
SCOTT
For the past year, our feelings and our needs have been put dead last! Do you guys really trust anybody anymore?
BUTTERS
Yeah!
KYLE
Butters? [points to Butters] You're a part of this too?
BUTTERS
I just wanted to believe in something that would get me out of the house! I didn't give a shit what it was.
SCOTT
Now just put down the vaccines and walk away, Kommunity Kidz.
CARTMAN
Look, you guys have a right to say and believe whatever you want, okay? But what you believe is really stupid.
SCOTT
We'll see who's stupid! [runs towards Stan, punching him in the face]
[The boys fight with the Lil' Qties, shouting at each other. Butters runs around waving an American flag. The scene cuts away to a breaking news broadcast.]
CHRIS
Tom, I'm standing outside South Park Elementary, where the Kommunity Kidz were set to distribute vaccines to the public. That's when a rival gang showed up and tried to stop them, and the fighting is still going on now. [camera pans towards the fighting] You can see behind me most of the damage is done, but it is still raging on, Tom. You can see this awful gang is trying to stop the Kommunity Kidz, just because the Kommunity Kidz believe in something and actually -- and actually care! They care enough to do something!
TOM
Yeah, that's basically what the Lil' Qties are doing too, right, Chris?
CHRIS
What do you mean, Tom?
TOM
Well, the Kommunity Kidz are acting on something they believe in and so are the Lil' Qties, am I right? What is the difference?
CHRIS
Oh, yeah, well, the difference, Tom, is that you're a giant piece of shit. That's the fucking difference!
TOM
Okay, let's just --
CHRIS
You're gonna even remotely defend these monsters when Kommunity Kidz are promoting change, just -- Fuck you, Tom! I'm out! [he walks off screen, leaving Tom looking bewildered]
[The boys are still fighting when Kyle breaks away, suddenly pointing at something.]
KYLE
Oh no! Oh, Jesus, look! [a crowd of adults are running towards South Park Elementary school]
UNNAMED MAN 5
This is my shot!
UNNAMED MAN 6
My shot!
STAN
[grab the vaccines] We got to get outta here!
[Mr. Garrison and Mr. Service are led into the Whites' basement by Bob.]
BOB
[walking down the stairs] Come on! I can show you my Q headquarters!
MR. GARRISON
[looking around] Jesus, you people really take this seriously.
BOB
Vaccinations are nothing more than a way for the elite and powerful to control us. [camera pans across Bob's bulletin board] We've been trying to warn everyone, and then Q released a new post saying the most important day woud be March 4th. At first it didn't make sense. Nothing's happening on March 4th! Until I saw a Super Bowl ad for a new streaming service which launched on March 4th! Streaming is also the term used for nano-technology microchips invented by Bill Gates that are being put into a liquid and then shot into people's arms as a vaccine!
MR.GARRISON
Who the hell is doing all this?
BOB
The Hollywood elites! [camera once again pans over the bulletin board, showing different pictures of famous celebrities] All of them, rich, powerful people who got to where they were by drinking adrenochrome from tortured children! Anyone who gets vaccinated is going to be tracked and manipulated for the rest of their lives.
MR. GARRISON
I got an e-mail that all teachers are about to be vaccinated at the school! You're telling me they're all going to become mindless zombies who are fine with child murder?
BOB
Yes!
MR. GARRISON
Aw geez, we gotta get to the school! [both of them run towards the exit]
BOB
I'll let all the other 'anons know! [he opens up a cabinet containing a variety of different guns] We'll put a stop to this once and for all! [he arms himself and hands a gun to Mr. Garrison] Let's do this!
[Suddenly the guns glow red before vanishing out of this air.]
MR. GARRISON
Hey! What the hell just happened?
BOB
It's the Hollywood elites! They're on to us! Come on! [they both run off-screen before reappearing a moment later in an arctic landscape]
MR. GARRISON
[looking around] Oh, my holy Jesus!
BOB
[shouting] Don't want the truth coming out, huh? Damn you! We'll get to the school! You can't stop us!
[South Park Elementary principal's office. Mrs. Nelson is pacing across the room.]
MRS. NELSON
I'm sorry for wasting everyone's time. I don't know why I believed them when they said they had vaccinations. [she begins to cry] I don't know why I believe anything anymore. [her phone starts ringing; she answers] Yes?
[The boys are sitting at a bridge with the vaccines, looking defeated.]
CARTMAN
Hi, Mrs. Nelson! How are you?
MRS. NELSON
Cut the crap! You said you'd be here at 7:00 AM!
CARTMAN
And, you know, we just ran into a little hiccup, so we wanted to see if you could meet us somewhere else for the vaccine.
MRS. NELSON
[angry] Oh, no. I knew this was a prank. You're not tricking me into going anywhere!
CARTMAN
No, no, Mrs. Nelson, it's not a prank! Okay, fine, we'll be there, okay? Just sit tight. [he hangs up]
KYLE
[angry] What was that!? You know we can't get into the school!
CARTMAN
She's not gonna come meet us, Kyle!
KYLE
You didn't even try! [looks to Stan]. He didn't try because he wants to sell the vaccines for money!
STAN
[glares at Kyle] And what about you, Kyle? You were the one trying to take vaccines for yourself this morning!
CARTMAN
He what?!
KYLE
Wow. Okay. I thought we had gotten past that, but --
STAN
Look, let's just face it, you guys. We don't trust each other and we don't like each other. We can't keep pretending.
KYLE
Are you seriously saying what I think?
CARTMAN
Alright, guys. I guess it's time we all had the talk we never wanted to have. [he looks at Kenny] Kenny, you wanna go get on your iPad for a minute?
KENNY
(What? No, I wanna hear this!)
CARTMAN
We just -- we really need to talk for a second, Kenny. Look, I downloaded Madagascar 3. You wanna watch with your Troll headphones? [he offers the iPad and headphones to Kenny]
KENNY
(Yeah, okay.) [he takes the iPad and walks away]
STAN
Look, it's been a hard year. And I think for some people there's just no going back.
CARTMAN
I've been trying as hard as I can to hold things together, but I have to admit... I'm just going through the "brotions."
STAN
We can't just force things for Kenny's sake. It's not good for us and it's not good for him. [he turns around, taking his hands out of his pockets and resting against the wall]
KYLE
[lifts the cooler with the vaccines] We still have a bunch of vaccines here. What happens now?
CARTMAN
I think I have a plan.
[Scene cuts to a news broadcast.]
TOM
And explosive powder keg of humanity is set to go off at South Park Elementary! [camera cuts to the chaos unfolding at the school] Thousands of people have turned up to get their shot -- that one shot that could change everything. But also in the crowd are several people who want to stop those vaccines from happening. At the center of it all -- that amazing group of kids who are just taking the time for what they believe is right. I'm talking, of course, about the Lil' Qties. A group of youngsters that believe vaccines are harmful --
CHRIS
[cutting him off] Yeah -- yeah, I see what you did there, Tom. That's real fucking cute.
TOM
I'm not trying to be cute. I'm saying if these kids really believe the horrific things they believe, then they'd be bad people not to go out and do something about it, wouldn't they?
CHRIS
[waving his arm dismissively] Yes, that's totally true if you're a corrupt dickhead without morals. You gotta be fucking --
TOM
Okay, okay, Chris, let's just get back to the weather.
CHRIS
Yeah, let's get back to the weather, you cunt.
[The arctic. Mr. Garrison, Bob White, and Mr. Service are walking through the snow.]
MR. GARRISON
[he looks back at Mr. Service, who is lagging behind] Come on, Mr. Service, we have to get back to the school!
MR. SERVICE
[his hands are covering his groin] My... My balls are freezing, sir.
MR. GARRISON
[turns back to Bob White] Mr. Service's balls are freezing!
BOB
[turns to face them] Don't give in to them! They're trying to make a joke of everything! That's what they do!
MR. GARRISON
How do the elites control Mr. Service's balls?
BOB
You still don't get it, do you?! They don't just drink adrenochrome, they run the show! The whole damn show! [a cursor appears suddenly, messing with Bob's appearance] It come down to two people -- [he realizes what's happening to him] Oh, you don't like that, do you?! That's getting a little close to home, huh?! You can't control me anymore, you sons of bitches! [the cursor continues to alter Bob in various ways] They're making fun of me to try and discredit my beliefs! [he is transformed into an obese woman wearing a dress, then a large penis] Oh, you don't like that, do you!? Don't want the world to know that!
MR. GARRISON
[he turns around] Listen! Listen, whoever you are! I don't give a shit what you do!
BOB
What?! What are you saying?!
MR. GARRISON
Please! I just want my old life back!
BOB
No, stop! They're monsters!
MR. GARRISON
I don't care what you do to kids, I just want people to like me again!
BOB
You son of a bitch! Aah! [he runs towards Mr. Garrison]
MR. GARRISON
Aah! Mr. Service!
[Suddenly the show freezes. The whole frame turns, revealing multiple layers of animation.]
MR. GARRISON
[pacing forward and back] Ah, oh, okay, what the hell is this? Hey, come back!
[The frame turns, everything returning to normal, albeit mirrored.]
MR. GARRISON
How would you like to make a deal?
MR. SERVICE
[grunts] Aah! Aah! [the cursor shrinks him down. Mr. Garrison walks up to him to see what happened; he has been transformed into Mr. Hat]
[A drawing of South Park Elementary and all the people outside is seen in frame.]
CARTMAN
Alright, here's the situation -- [he points to the drawing of the school with a red marker] All of our teachers are inside the school, surrounded now by at least 400 to 500 people who want a shot. [he circles the crowd] The Lil' Qties are stationed throughout and we... [he circles the drawing of the boys] And we are no longer bros. The magic is gone and we are through, is that right? [camera turns to reveal Stan and Kyle sitting at a table]
STAN
Yup.
KYLE
Uh huh.
CARTMAN
But we all want what's best for Kenny, so we have to find a way to compromise and move on with our lives. So how do we do it? We use... a 2-2-3. [he flips the page, revealing a calendar with a schedule written on it] Kyle, you have Kenny for two days starting on Monday. I have Kenny Thursday and Friday, and then, Stan, you get him for the weekend. Then we switch where I have Kenny starting Monday, Stan gets two days and Kyle gets a weekend.
KYLE
Do we really have to do this? That- that all seems overly confusing.
CARTMAN
Okay, so we can go alternating weeks -- [he flips the page] Each one of us has Kenny for six days and then we rotate.
STAN
A week is a long time for Kenny to be with one person.
CARTMAN
[flips page] Alternating weeks with a midweek visit. We have longer stretches, but a change for a break.
KYLE
Aw, come on. What about sleepovers? We can't take those away from Kenny.
CARTMAN
[flips page] Alternating weeks with midweek overnight.
STAN
It would be easier if I just knew I always had Kenny on certain days.
CARTMAN
[flips page] 3-3-4-4 rotation. Makes everyone's days consistent -- oh, hang on on a second, guys. [he opens the door to check on Kenny, who is sitting in the hallway] Everything okay, buddy?
KENNY
[he looks up from his iPad] (Yeah, what's going on?)
CARTMAN
We're almost done in here, Kenny. You liking that birthday cake-flavored ice cream?
KENNY
(Yeah, it's fine, but I --)
CARTMAN
[cuts him off] Okay, you're doing great, pal. [he shuts the door] The 3-3-4-4 is the most consistent, but to change weekends, we would need... [flips page] the 2-2-5-5 rotation, where the weekends can actually fluctuate.
KYLE
I don't even know what to say...
STAN
Well, I say that out of all of those... the first one makes the most sense.
CARTMAN
[he flips back to the second page] The 2-2-3, I agree. This way we don't have to be bros but Kenny still has the best possible life.
STAN
[he gets out of his chair] 2-2-3. That's so ridiculous... that it just might work.
[South Park Elementary. A news report is taking place.]
CHRIS
We've just received devastating news here at South Park Elementary. It appears that the Kommunity Kidz... are breaking up. They have asked for people to... [he reads from a sheet of paper] "Respect their privacy in these difficult times," and it appears that the strain of this pandemic, from people like you, Tom, was just too much.
TOM
[rolls his eyes] Oh, here we go, here we go.
CHRIS
Yeah, here we go!You just couldn't leave 'em alone, could you, ya prick?!
TOM
Okay, let's just --
CHRIS
They broke up 'cause of you and your stupid -- wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute, what is this? [turns to his side] Tom, one of the Kommunity Kidz has shown up to the school... with the vaccines!
[Kyle walks up to the school, carrying the cooler with the vaccines.]
GUITAR SINGER
Finally, I'm gonna get my shot! [the crowd starts to cheer]
SCOTT
[the Lil' Qties group up] Alright, Qties, this is it! Prepare for the storm! [Kyle stops and looks at them]
STAN
[walking up to Kyle on the left] Dude, what are you doing? You're gonna get yourself killed.
CARTMAN
[approaches Kyle on the right] This isn't our fight anymore, Kyle.
KYLE
We set out to do something. I'm not letting our broship fall to the pandi just yet.
CARTMAN
Alright... then let's get those vaccines to the teachers.
STAN
Okay, let's do this.
[The boys face the crowd of Qanons, Lil Qties, and adults waiting for the vaccine. They get into battle position, with Kyle taking out a baton.]
MR. GARRISON
[appearing suddenly] Hey! Hold on a second, everybody! [grunting, he drags behind him Bob White, who has been turned into a giant penis] I think I can help things out here!
STAN
What the fuck is that?
QANON MEMBER
It's him! It's the Chonen One!
QANON MEMBER #2
He's come to save us all like the prophecy foretold on the internet!
SCOTT
Wait, he's the Chosen One?
MR. GARRISON
Listen! Listen, everybody. I -- I think I owe you all a big apology. I came in here expecting everything to just go back to normal, but... we've all been through the proverbial butthole of hardships lately. I thought we could all just magically be friends again. But relationships are very fragile things. [Stan, Kyle, and Cartman look at each other] And in times of crises when we need each other most, it's sometimes when we grow furthest apart. But through it all, Mr. White here has taught me a very important lesson. Make sure you're on the side of the people with the most power. And so, I've worked out a deal with some pretty powerful people... [looks up at the sky] Alright, boys, do your thing!
[A low bass tone sounds and fireworks explode in the air. Everyone in the crowd gasps. Air Israel planes appear.]
MR. GARRISON
It's Air Israel with enough vaccines for every adult in town!
[The crowd cheers, running to the plane to get vaccinated. An Israeli man begins throwing boxes full of vaccines to the citizens of South Park. They all begin to inject the vaccinations into themselves.]
GERALD
[vaccinating himself] Hey, Garrison! Good job!
STEPHEN
Yeah! You're alright, Garrison!
MR. GARRISON
[laughs, putting his hands on his hips] Oh, jeez. Thanks, everybody.
CARTMAN
Well, come on you guys! Let's get inside!
[They run inside with the vaccines where all the teachers are waiting.]
KYLE
Mrs. Nelson? We're here!
MR. MACKEY
[leaving his office] Boys! Boys, you made it! [all the other staff members walk out]
CARTMAN
Of course we made it! [motions to Stan and Kyle] 'Cause our broship can survive anything!
STAN
Hello, Mrs. Nelson! [she is walking down the stairs]
KYLE
We got your vaccination for you, Mrs. Nelson.
MRS. NELSON
Boys... you really did it. I -- I can't believe it. For a while there, I thought I -- [she breaks into a coughing fit] Excuse me. I thought I wasn't gonna -- [coughs again] gosh, excuse me. [she continues coughing and gasping]
[Scene cuts to a funeral. Mrs. Nelson is in the coffin. Father Maxi is speaking.]
FATHER MAXI
As a teacher, Mrs. Nelson did everything she could for her students. So it seems even more unfair that she... was just a few days late in getting the vaccine before she died of COVID. And now as Mr. Garrison takes over teaching for Mrs. Nelson permanently... [Scott Malkinson begins sobbing; Mr. Garrison is smiling] I think we should all take a moment to say... Hey! The rest of us made it, South Park! We're on the other side of this damn thing! [all the adults cheer] And so it's time for adults to screw these masks and party like it's 2021!
[Down By The Lazy River by the Osmonds plays over a montage of adults partying. Two citizens spit in each others' mouths.]
UNNAMED MAN 7
[partying in a club] Hey, look at Walgreens! Nobody's going!
UNNAMED MAN 8
Yeah, that place used to be so cool and now it's lame!
RANDY
[selling weed at a booth] So we still have some of the pandemic special, but the vaccination special is about out! Try 'em both -- the season is about over, guys!
[A long line of elderly people are entering a retirement home.]
WORKER
Back inside the retirement home, old people! All the fun places are ours again! [The elderly people groan]
[The boys are walking down the street, still wearing masks, while the adults party.]
STEPHEN
[dancing] Adults are all vaccinated! Adults are all vaccinated!
STAN
Well, I guess this is it... [turns around to face rest of the boys]
CARTMAN
Yeah.
KYLE
I guess it is what's best for everybody.
KENNY
(What are you guys talking about?)
STAN
Everything's gonna be okay, Kenny. I'll see you on Monday.
KYLE
And I'll come pick you up on Thursday, Kenny.
KENNY
(Huh?)
STAN
Hey, I wish you guys all the best, huh?
CARTMAN
Thanks. I'll be fine. I already have some new bros I'm hanging out with.
CLYDE
Hey, Cartman!
CARTMAN
[turns to face Clyde] Yeah?
CLYDE
[standing with Jimmy and an unnamed Hispanic kid] Dude, they're reopening Casa Bonita this weekend. Do you wanna come with us?
CARTMAN
[he takes off his mask] Casa Bonita?! Hell yeah, I'll come! [his face falls] Oh, wait! I can't! I have fucking Kenny this weekend! [he throws his hat onto the ground in anger] Shit! [he walks away furiously, glaring at a confused Kenny]
[Fourth grade classroom. Mr. Garrison opens the door and walks inside, dropping his books on his desk and taking a seat. He puts Mr. Hat on his hand, smiling.]
MR. GARRISON
[sighs] Nice doing business with you... you little child-murdering pedophiles. [the scene cuts to black, credits roll]
