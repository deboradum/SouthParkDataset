synopsis:The boys join some anti-war protesters because it's a free pass out of school for the day.

script:I'm a Little Bit Country

[South Park Elementary, day. The bell rings. The fourth graders are still chatting as Mr. Garrison enters.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, let's take our seats. Did you take attendance, Mr. Slave?
MR. SLAVE
[at his own little desk off to the side] All donesy wunsy. [has a clipboard to prove it]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, let's all take out our math homework and go over the problem.
CARTMAN
[searching his notebook] Math homework, Math homework. Where did I file that?
MR. GARRISON
[about to write on the board, but turns around] Oh, and by the way, children, there's a walkout scheduled today to protest the war in Iraq. So, uh, if you're against the war, run along outside, and if you're for the war, uh, stay here and we'll do math problems. [the kids quickly stare at each other]
[South Park Elementary, front entrance. The door open and all the kids run out. A cloud of paper signals their exit. Some of them twirl with delight. The boys come out singing.]
THE BOYS
We got out of schoo-l! No more school toda-ay!
KYLE
What should we do?
STAN
Let's go see a movie! [they stop in their tracks as they hear "No war! No war!"]
PROTESTERS
No war! No war! [a sea of them mill around on South Park Avenue waving various signs around] No war! No war! [One man wields an American flag. He lowers it while another reaches for a lighter and set the flag aflame.] No war! No war! [three men break into Tele's through its large window and steal various TVs] No war! No war! No war!
MR. MACKEY
[walks up to the boys with several signs in his hands] No war, m'kay?! No war, m'kay?! Oh uh, here you go, boys. [hands each of them a sign] These will help you protest. It's good to see that you care about peace, boys, m'kay? No war, m'kay?!
A VOICE
Excuse me, boys. [the boys look and the adult is shown] Tom Stansel, HBC news. Can you kids tell me why you marched out of school today? [behind him is the cameraman and an assistant, and behind her, the news van]
STAN
[pause] Uh... war?
TOM
Right. What about the war?
KYLE
[pause] Ih ih ih-t's g-gay?
TOM
Uh huh, and what aspect of it do you think is most gay?
KYLE
[looks at his sign] Uuuh, n-no blood for oil.
STAN
Yeah. [the mic moves back to him as he looks at his sign] War is not my voice.
CARTMAN
[reading Kenny's sign] Bush is a Naizi
SKEETER
[arrives with a crowd] Hey all you un-American bastards! If you don't like America, why don't you git out?! [moves his right thumb in front of his shoulder and to his right. With him are Jimbo, Ned, Stuart, and Craig's father Tom]
MR. MACKEY
Don't you call us un-American! This country was founded on the right to protest! M'kay?
PROTESTERS
Yeah! Right!
STUART
If the Founding Fathers saw you burning your flag an' callin' the President a Nazi, they'd roll over in their grave!
SUPPORTERS
Yeah! Right!
RANDY
The Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest!
SKEETER
Foundin' Fathers would kick all your asses!
TOM
Boys, what do you think the Founding Fathers would say?
CARTMAN
...Eh the... Foggy who? [seconds later, both sides rush each other and attack]
[South Park Elementary, Garrison's classroom. He stares at the children angrily, his arms crossed.]
MR. GARRISON
[drops his arm, putting his right hand on his hip] Well, I hope you little Commies are pretty pleased with yourselves! [crosses his arms again] Going out there and protesting America, and then saying on national television that you don't even know who the Founding Fathers are! You kids don't know squat about America, do you?!
BUTTERS
Mmuh well, not really, no.
MR. GARRISON
Well that's just jingles! Because I'm assigning all you little flag-burners a full report on seventeen seventy-siyix, and the Founding Fathers!
CLASS
Awwwwww!
MR. GARRISON
SHUT UP! I want you all in your study groups of four, and if you can't give an outstanding report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about all this protesting, then it's Fs for you! [walks off]
[South Park Elementary, Garrison's classroom, moments later. The class has separated in groups of four and five. Group 1: Jimmy, Red, Clyde, Bebe, Wendy. Group 2: Butters, Jordan, Kevin, Tolkien. Group 3: Cartman, Kenny, Stan, Kyle. Group 4: Tweek, Pip, blond boy, Craig, another boy. All are studying quietly. Camera angle moves from the front of the room to the side of the room opposite the door.]
CARTMAN
[beginning to slack off] Ugh. Ughuh. [tries to resume studying, but his eyes grow heavy. He panics] I can't do it! This is waaay too much material for a nine-year-old! [yawns loudly and promptly sleeps on his book]
KYLE
[smacks Cartman] Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!
CARTMAN
But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off.
STAN
[pointing] You're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us!
CARTMAN
Maaaa. M-maaaa.
KYLE
[annoyed] SHUT UP AND STUDY!
CARTMAN
Maaaa. Mah mah mh. [reluctantly returns to reading. He begins to fidget, then reads more, then fidgets again, turns the page, fidgets once more, then just thinks] Hmmm, 1776. When our Founding Fathers created America. I wonder what it used to be like in those days? [repeats the question, his voice fading at each repetition] In those days? In those days? In those days?
KYLE
[noticing] What are you doing?
CARTMAN
I'm trying to have a flashback.
KENNY
(A what?)
CARTMAN
You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like first-hand!
STAN
No, you just have to study.
CARTMAN
No. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second. [thinks] Oh okay, okay. How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would have been like back then? [repeats the last two words, his voice fading at each repetition] Back then? Back then? Back then? [nothing happens. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny look at him] Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don't even care about 1776. It was so long ago, that I don't think it has anything to do with me. [his voice begins to fade and he begins moving his hands around like a pantomime. The camera closes in] With me. With... anything to do with me. With me.
KYLE
That isn't gonna work, dumbass!
MR. SLAVE
Kids, let's keep it down for study group, or else Mr. Garrison is going to punish me.
STAN
[from behind his book] Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study!
CARTMAN
[throws a fit] Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa!
[South Park Avenue. The opposing groups face each other in front of the tallest building in town. Skeeter paints a line across the span of the street and looks up.]
SKEETER
There! All finished. From now on, this is the pro-war side of town, and that's the unpatriotic side. [the war supporters begin to clamor]
RANDY
How about we call this the rational side of town, and that the redneck side?!
PROTESTERS
Hahahaha, yeah.
JIMBO
You just keep all your flag burnin' and your hippie-rock protest songs on YOUR side of the town!
PROTESTER
Hey wait a minute, your side of town has the post office.
STUART
Well your side has the grocery store.
JIMBO
Well you can come to our side of town to use the post office and we can go to your side to use the grocery store.
GERALD
Aaah, can we cross the line to take our kids to school?
JIMBO
W-hell, naturally you could cross the line for that. Just like ...we could cross the line for hardware, supplies, gas, and pharmaceutical needs.
TOWNSFOLK
Yup, yes sir, yeah, right, uh huh.
SKEETER
Hey everybody, this is never going to work. Don't you see? All this dividin' up the town, it's just ridiculous. What we really should be doing, is just beatin' the hell out of each other like we were.
RANDY
He's right. [looks at Sheila] Boy, do I feel like a fool. [moments later, both sides attack each other again. Among the skirmishes: Kenny's mom attacks Gerald, Sheila attacks Ned]
[Cartman's house, upstairs. The boys walk down the hallway and reach Cartman's room. He's rigged up a way to ... knock himself out. Three pulley wheels and a nail guide a string tied to the door across the entrance, up the wall, and back to the top of the door entrance. At the other end of the string is a big rock.]
KYLE
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're supposed to be studying! [the boys stop at the entrance to Cartman's room]
CARTMAN
That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776. [tests the tautness of the string]
STAN
How?!
CARTMAN
All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers!
KYLE
Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!
CARTMAN
Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please? [Stan and Kyle look at each other, Kenny looks at them. They clear the doorway. Kyle stands on one side, Stan and Kenny on the other. Cartman backs up, clears his throat, then begins to walk with purpose] Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776. [trips the string. The rock immediately falls on his head, knocking him out. He moans a few times.]
KYLE
Cartman? Cartman?? [the boys gather around Cartman. Kyle turns him over.]
CARTMAN
Benjamin Franklin?
KYLE
No, turdpants, it's Kyle!
CARTMAN
[touches Kyle, then in a weak raspy voice] Kyle! Get out of my flashback, you God-damned Jew!
[City Hall, day. Both sides of the war issue are in the office.]
TOWNSFOLK
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Okay, people. What are we rambling about now?
RANDY
[steps forward] Mayor, our peace rally has always been set for this Saturday! Now, these pro-war bastards are suddenly trying to say they get the town square.
SKEETER
[steps forward, past a few war supporters] That's bullcrap, Mayor! Our rally to support the war was set up months ago!
GERALD
There was no war months ago!
SKEETER
Hey, if you don't like America, then you can git out!
RANDY
Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music propaganda!
STUART
Well nobody wants to hear a bunch o' rock protest songs! [both side begin to clamor again]
MR. MACKEY
Well up yours, rednecks!
TOWNSFOLK
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Quiet people! The town square is public space. That means if neither group will nicely and maturely move the day of its rally, I'll just have to give the town square to both groups.
JIMBO
All right, that's fine! Because our war support songs will be a thousand times better!
RANDY
Oh, you think so? Bring the shizzle!
SKEETER
We'll trizzle the shizzle all over the hizzle!
GERALD
Yeah?! See you Saturday, makizzer shanna sharilla shaz biuznatch gazizzah!
[Cartman's house, night. The front door opens and in walk the boys.]
STAN
Cartman?
KYLE
Cartman? You'd better be studying, God-damnit! [there's debris all over the living room. The boys arrive at Cartman hanging from a candy-cane colored swing set with the swings removed. Beneath him is a tub of water. Cartman has it rigged so that he pulls a string, which releases him and at the same time triggers a sledgehammer, which hits a box, which is supposed to land in the tub with him.]
CARTMAN
Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time.
STAN
Oh no...
CARTMAN
Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Founding Fathers!
KYLE
Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?!
CARTMAN
I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!
STAN
Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea.
CARTMAN
Or a really sweet one. [a bell is heard]
TV OH
Your Tivo is full.
CARTMAN
Whoa, here it goes! [triggers the sledgehammer as he falls. Both he and the TiVo land in the tub, and the house shorts out. Cartman is electrocuted as he lands in the water. The boys spend a few seconds in the darkness looking at Cartman, wondering if he'll come to. Kenny turns and walks away slowly]
KYLE
Cartman? [no response] Cartman??
STAN
Aww crap.
[The flashback. Cartman is seen in period dress, face down on a dirt road. He comes to, looks up, sits up and looks around, then notices his clothes. He quickly rises and looks at Philadelphia in the distance.]
CARTMAN
Ohhh awesome!!! [a horse-drawn carriage approaches, driven by a teenage boy.]
OFFICIAL MESSENGER BOY
Worthy young lad, are you all right?
CARTMAN
Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is?
OFFICIAL MESSENGER BOY
This year? Why it's 1776, it is.
CARTMAN
Oho yes! I did it I did it!
OFFICIAL MESSENGER BOY
Would you like a ride into town? I'm on my way to Master Thomas Jefferson's house to get a very important document, I am.
CARTMAN
Oho kick fucking ass, dude! [approaches the carriage and climbs up to sit alongside the driver]
OFFICIAL MESSENGER BOY
Never seen you around here, friend. Might you be from up North?
CARTMAN
No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback.
OFFICIAL MESSENGER BOY
A flashback? Why, what is that?
CARTMAN
Well you know, it's a... [points at something] H-ho, awesome! [they've entered the town and Cartman begins to sing.]

Look at me, I'm back in time, in 1776.
With gaslight corners, cobblestone streets, and humble houses made of bricks.
What a special magic time, and it's all alive for me
I'm so glad Stan and Kyle aren't here. I hate those guys, seriously.
Seriously hate those guys. Hate Stan and Kyle.
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day, Cartman's recovery room. Cartman's mom sits by his bed as Stan and Kyle look on. Dr. Doctor enters.]
LIANE
[jumps up worried] Is he going to be all right, doctor??
DR. DOCTOR
Your son tried to kill himself in a ritualistic fashion I've never seen before. His chances of surviving are very slim. I'm so sorry.
LIANE
[quickly returns to embrace him, with emotion in her voice.] Oh baby baby, you can't die.
KYLE
Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!! [shakes him hard]
LIANE
Whoa. Easy, Kyle.
KYLE
But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again!
STAN
I guess we're just gonna have to do it with the three of us! Come on, guys!
LIANE
I know you're in a very dark place now, sweetie. But you must come toward the light! Come toward the light!
[Flashback, night. The driver and Cartman approach Jefferson's house.]
OFFICIAL MESSENGER BOY
Here we are, then. The current residence of Master Thomas Jefferson.
CARTMAN
Super neato! [both driver and Cartman disboard and walk towards the door]
OFFICIAL MESSENGER BOY
[stops and turns] I'm afraid you'll have to wait here.
CARTMAN
But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report.
OFFICIAL MESSENGER BOY
Sorry. Only the official messenger boy is allowed to talk to Mister Jefferson
CARTMAN
Oh, okay.I guess I understand. [the driver walks off. Cartman notices some firewood and picks up a log of it, then follows the driver while singing to himself]

I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...[he quickly assaults the driver and beats him with the log, then drags the body away and returns to the Jefferson residence, knocking on the door]
I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...
JEFFERSON
Hello. I am Thomas Jefferson.
CARTMAN
And I am the official messenger boy, I am.
JEFFERSON
[holding a document] Very well. Take this document to the Continental Congress. [hands it to Cartman]
CARTMAN
[beholding it] Wow, the Declaration of Independence Day.
JEFFERSON
Some favor going to war with England and others want to avoid war at all cost.
CARTMAN
It's a bitch, ain't it?
JEFFERSON
Perhaps this document will make the reasons for war obvious to all. Good luck, young messenger! [Cartman turns and heads for the carriage] Now make haste!
[Stan's house, day. Kyle, Stan, and Kenny study at the coffee table in the living room.]
STAN
Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then the Continental Congress-
PROTESTERS
[first heard, then seen as they enter from screen left] No war! No war! No war!
KYLE
Oh, Jesus...
RANDY
Uh, boys, would you mind clearing the living room. We have to practice our big war protest song.
STAN
Dad, we have to study. Mr. Garrison is making us do a presentation on what the Founding Fathers would say about the war.
MR. MACKEY
Hey... That's a terrific idea!
GERALD
Yeah! We could have the boys do their presentation as part of our peace rally on Saturday!
STAN
Oh, no, nononono.
SUPPORTERS
[first heard, then they enter through the front door] Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops!
SKEETER
See? I told you they had your son.
STUART
Kenny. What are you doing over here with all these un-American traitors?!
KENNY
(I'm doing my homework.)
RANDY
The boys are going to give a presentation at our rally about how the Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest! [the war supporters clamor against Randy]
STAN
Actually, we hadn't really come to a decision-
STUART
Look! My son is a patriot and LOVES his country! [grabs Kenny's jacket] Come on, Kenny!
KENNY
(But Dad, I-)
STUART
NOW!
SKEETER
Yeah!
SUPPORTERS
Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops! [they walk out the front door. Kenny follows his dad out. Stan follows him ]
STAN
[stops at the open door] Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww. [turns around and returns to the table] Awww, now we lost two in our study group!
KYLE
[shoves his book off the table] God damnit!
RANDY
Can you believe those hick sons of bitches? Manipulating those kids to be on their side.
GERALD
Disgraceful! Stan and Kyle, it's up to you to show all those war-mongerers that the Founding Fathers agree with us!
PROTESTER 1
Yeah, that's right!
PROTESTER 2
Come on, guys!
PROTESTER 3
Get back to work!
KYLE
Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap?
[Philadelphia, day. Independence Hall is shown. Cartman enters and finds the Congress room. The doors open before him.]
A VOICE
Enter, young messenger. [Cartman enters the room, awed by the people he sees around him, and approaches the main desk. He hands the document to the man waiting there] I am John Hancock, President of the Congress.
CARTMAN
Wow.
HANCOCK
Mr. John Adams?
ADAMS
Aye. [rises and approaches the table]
HANCOCK
Will you do the honors of reading the document to Congress, please? [Cartman takes an empty chair nearby]
ADAMS
[reading from the Declaration] WHEN in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary for one Penis to rise up- [cut to the end of the Declaration] -we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.P.S. - Every Thursday should be Free Ice Cream Day. [rolls up the Declaration. Cartman looks around]
A CONGRESSMAN
Excuse me, but does this Declaration actually suggest that we should go to go war with England?
ADAMS
We have no choice, Mr. Dickinson. [chatter erupts]
[South Park, day. The town square stage. On stage are decorations for the two sides. On the left is a large peace sign on a green curtain surrounded by peace signs and protest signs, on the right is a large eagle surrounded by yellow ribbons. Both groups are on stage.]
MR. MACKEY
All right everyone, thank you all for comin' out to protest the war, m'kay? [people within the crowd clap. Randy comes out dressed in an Elvis outfit].
SKEETER
Don't kid yourselves. These people have come out to support our troops, right?! [raises a fist. Other people within the crowd clap]
MR. MACKEY
And now, Randy Marsh is gonna sing a protest song he wrote about the war.
SKEETER
Oh no you don't! We're doing our pro-war song first!
JIMBO
Yeah! The last thing these people want is a bleedin'-heart rock protest song!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[intervenes] People, I told you, you have to share the stage.
RANDY
Nobody wants to here another pro-war country song!
SKEETER
Well excuse me if...
I'm a little bit country.
RANDY
Well I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!
SKEETER
I'm a little for supportin' our troops.
RANDY
And I'm a little for bringin' 'em home.
SKEETER
I believe freedom isn't free.
RANDY
No, but war shouldn't be our goal.
SKEETER
We must defend our country.
RANDY
If it means war, then we say NO!
SOMEBODY
Yeehaw!
SKEETER
[walks to the edge of the stage in front of the war support crowd, then sits on the edge]
Did you forget them towers in New York?
Did you forget how it made you feel
To see them towers come down?
Were you like me? Did you think it weren't real?
RANDY
I like to rock, but I don't wanna rock Iraq!
The only kind of rockin' America should do, is the kind that we can all dance to, yeah!
SKEETER
We got GPS, ICBMs, and good old-fashioned lead.
We're gonna show Saddam what America means; that son of a bitch'll be dead.
RANDY
Why are we fightin' this war?
There's a man in the office we didn't vote for.
They didn't give me a choice.
War is not my voice! Yeaaaaahhhh!
[Philadelphia, day, Independence Hall. There's plenty of argument going on.]
ADAMS
We must go to war!
DICKINSON
But what about the violence?! The lives lost?! If we found a country, it should be founded on peace and diplomacy.
CONGRESSMAN 1
England will only understand one thing: Force.
CONGRESSMAN 2
[rises] I must state again for the record that South Carolina, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Georgia are against war! [pounds the table with his fist]
CONGRESSMAN 3
Yeah, because you don't care about the fate of the Colonies like we do! You're all unpatriotic! And if you don't like the Colonies, then you can get out!
DICKINSON
Don't you call us unpatriotic! We're protesting this war because we care so deeply for the fate of our Colonies! You are all unpatriotic for leading the Colonies into a war that half of them don't want! [the various Congressmen begin babbling with each other]
CARTMAN
[observing] Whoa, how very very relevant.
[South Park, day, town square. The rally is still going on, and a reporter files the following report.]
TOM
Tom, I'm standing in the town square where the war rally has been going on for an incredible eighty-seven hours. The crowd still appears to be split right down the middle - half of them support country music, and the other half rock-n-roll. Let's listen in.
MR. MACKEY
And now we'd like to bring out a couple of very special South Park students who did a report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about the war. [Stan walks up to the mic, watching the crowd on the way there. Kyle follows. The crowd claps appreciatively]
PROTESTERS
Booooo!!
RANDY
[steps up] For you people who still think war is the answer, perhaps you can listen to the voices ... of the children. [shows them off and backs out of the scene. The crowd applauds and quiets down]
STAN
Uh, we didn't do it.
MR. MACKEY
What?
KYLE
We didn't do our homework.
SHARON
Boys! You were supposed to come out here and tell everyone about the Founding Fathers!
STAN
Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Daylight Savings and we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then-
SKEETER
That's because the Founding Fathers would have supported the war!
MR. MACKEY
The Founding Fathers would have protested like us!
SUPPORTERS
Support!
PROTESTERS
Protest!
SUPPORTERS
Country!
PROTESTERS
Rock-n-roll!
[The two sides charge at each other on stage, then off stage. They attack each other with their signs. One man drives his "War is not my voice" sign straight down into another man's head. A man drives his "Bush is a Nazi" sign up a woman's nose after she swats him with her "Support Your Troops" sign. A woman strikes someone else down with her "No Blood for Oil" sign. Stan and Kyle just look on.]
[Philadelphia, day, Independence Hall. There's plenty of argument still going on.]
CONGRESSMEN
Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble!
DICKINSON
We cannot found a country based on war!
ADAMS
We cannot found a country that is afraid to fight!
CONGRESSMAN
Rabble!
CONGRESSMEN
Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble! [the doors open and in walks an august figure. The boisterous voices become hushed] Oh my, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. [they keep murmuring this as Franklin walks towards the main desk]
CARTMAN
Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.
HANCOCK
Mr. Franklin, where do you stand on the war issue?
FRANKLIN
I believe that if we are to form a new country, we cannot be a country that appears war-hungry and violent to the rest of the world. However, we also cannot be a country that appears weak and unwilling to fight to the rest of the world. So, what if we form a country that appears to want both?
JEFFERSON
Yes. Yes of course. We go to war, and protest going to war at the same time.
DICKINSON
Right. If the people of our new country are allowed to do whatever they wish, then some will support the war and some will protest it.
FRANKLIN
And that means that as a nation, we could go to war with whomever we wished, but at the same time, act like we didn't want to. If we allow the people to protest what the government does, then the country will be forever blameless.
ADAMS
[holding a slice of chocolate cake] It's like having your cake, and eating it, too.
CONGRESSMAN 2
Think of it: an entire nation founded on saying one thing and doing another.
HANCOCK
And we will call that country the United States of America.
CARTMAN
Wow, I get it now! I get it! [senses his flashback coming to an end] Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time.
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day, Cartman's room. Cartman comes to and looks around.]
CARTMAN
Wow!
[South Park, town square. The townsfolk are still attacking each other and killing more of their number. One man kills another with a "PEACE NOW" sign. A war supporter runs a flag pole through a protester, then pulls it back out again. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny watch from the other end of the square, towards the stage as the carnage continues.]
CARTMAN
[appears on stage in his hospital gown, his hair disheveled] Everyone, stop! Please! [everyone stops and looks at him]
TOWNSMAN
The-the child! The child, from the hospital.
CARTMAN
If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say.
STAN
He does? [he and Kyle are shocked]
KYLE
He does?
CARTMAN
I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to. [a shot of the crowd]
CARTMAN
You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called "having your cake and eating it too."
RANDY
He's right. The strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another.
SKEETER
Yeah, but... if it weren't for all you guys protesting, why everyone around the world would hate the American people instead of just the President.
GERALD
And if it weren't for you people flexing your arms, America could easily get taken over by terrorists or... or China.
MR. MACKEY
I guess we... owe you an apology.
STUART
Eh-ah, I guess we owe you one.
TOWNSFOLK
Awww. [amid a chorus of awwws they hug each other.]
KYLE
Cartman? Cartman saved the day?
STAN
Can't be
CARTMAN
The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass.
SKEETER
Hey I'm a little bit country
RANDY
And I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!
[Cartman takes his mic and backs out of the scene, leaving Randy and Skeeter to sing together.]
SKEETER
I'll be the muscle of America
RANDY
And me, I'll be the caring soul.
TOGETHER
And when you put us together you get a nation with one goal
To thrive and prosper, with a little country and rock and roll.
SKEETER
Come on up here, everybody! [the crowd surges onto the stage. Stan and Kyle look dumbfounded]
EVERYBODY
We're a little bit country, and we're a little bit rock-n-roll
STUART
We can be a nation that believes in war.
MR. MACKEY
And still tells the world that we don't.
[moments later the back of the stage begins to rise, revealing guests from many previous episodes]
EVERYBODY
Let the flag for hypocrisy fly high from every pole
Cuz we're a little bit country, and we're a little bit rock-n-roll.
RANDY
Well, goodnight everybody. It sure has been great bringing you a hundred episodes.
SKEETER
We want to thank our guests, the pro-war people. [shown, including Halfy. Some applause is heard] And the anti-war people. [shown. Some applause is heard]
STAN
What the hell are they doing now?
KYLE
[covers his nose and shuts his eyes tight] I-I don't know.
EVERYBODY
For the war, against, the war, WHO CARES?? One hundred episodes!
[Randy and Skeeter perform some nifty footwork as they finish the song.]
KYLE
I hate this town. I-I really really do.
End of I'm a Little Bit Country

synopsis:Jimmy and Timmy pull together a group of people like themselves and call their new club the "Crips".

script:Krazy Kripples

[South Park, day. Now showing at the South Park Community Theatre. Fanfare begins with a drumroll, a spotlight hits its mark on stage and an announcer speaks]
ANNOUNCER
Ladies and Gentlemen, give it up for JIMMY! [the curtains part and Jimmy walks forward wearing a tuxedo] Thank you! Wow. What a terrific audience. [the curtains close behind him] I know what most of you are thinking. "Hey, uh-that guy stole my show..." [long pause] Wow, what a great audience. And how about this Michael Jackson guy, huh? I mean, come on... [long pause] Wow, what a great audience. [the soft sound of one person clapping is heard] Uh... l... lights, please? [the house lights click on and only one person is seen in the seats: Butters]
BUTTERS
Hey Jimmy.
JIMMY
Butters, w-where is everybody?
BUTTERS
Oh yeah, well, about that... Christopher Reeve came to town to do some kind of show, and everyone went to see him.
JIMMY
Christopher Reeve? Christopher Reeve?!
BUTTERS
You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy who played Superman.
JIMMY
I know who he is! But why is everyone ditching my comedy show to see him?!
BUTTERS
Ww-well, because he got crippled, but now he can move his finger. He is an inspiration to us all. That's why everyone ditched on your show.
JIMMY
So then, how come you came?
BUTTERS
Well, because I said I would. Oh, I'm a dork, huh? [Jimmy stews on stage]
[Town Square. Mayor McDaniels is on stage with her aides. Above them a banner reads "STEM CELL RESEARCH." A crowd of people has formed in front of the stage]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
And so without further ado, here's the most courageous, most amazing man on the planet, Christopher Reeve. [everyone claps and the curtains open. The mayor and her aides step aside. Christopher Reeve rolls out towards the mic. Jimmy shows up to watch.]
REEVE
Thank you, thank you, wow, what a great audience. [stops to catch his breath with a fixed smile in place] I just flew into South Park. [catches his breath] Used to be I didn't need an airplane.
TOWNSPEOPLE
Awwwww. [a smattering of applause]
REEVE
As most of you know, [catches his breath] I am a strong supporter of stem-cell research.
JIMMY
Say, fellas! Thanks a lot for goin' to my ...c-comedy show! ["It is a proven fact that stem-cell research"]
CARTMAN
We didn't go to your comedy show.
JIMMY
I know that, I was being f-f-f-fa...cetious! ["can add many years to the lives of people who have been disabled by accidents"]
STAN
Look, dude. Christopher Reeve, dude. ["or other ways."]
JIMMY
Ooh, Christopher Reeve! Whoop-de-freakin-do!
KYLE
Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve.
STAN
Yeah dude, not cool.
REEVE
Though it is controversial, [catches his breath] stem cell research is critical [catches his breath] in the quest for helping [catches his breath] the disabled.
JIMMY
I put together a comedy show and I was crippled from BIRTH! [waddles off in a huff]
STAN
Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one.
KYLE
Yeah, this is starting to look like something we shouldn't be any part of. Let's go play with trucks or something. [they turn right and trot off]
TIMMY
Ha-a-aaa-haaa-a.
JIMMY
[approaching] Can you believe this asswipe, Timmy?
TIMMY
Timmeh!!
JIMMY
Why is a celebrity who became crippled more important than us that were born that way, very much.
TIMMY
Rrruh Timmeh!
REEVE
In the coming days [catches his breath] I will prove to the world [catches his breath] that stem-cell research is a miracle.
[The bus stop, day. The boys are on the snow playing with their trucks.]]
CARTMAN
Beep beep beep. Move it, Kenny! Beep.
JIMMY
Hey there fellas.
STAN
Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.
TIMMY
Timmih!!
JIMMY
Say, would you guys like to join our club? Oh, I'm sorry. You can't. You aren't crippled. [start laughing. The boys go back to playing with their trucks.]
KYLE
What?
JIMMY
To be in our club, not only do you have to be c-c-crippled, but you have to have been born that way. Do you know what that means? No butthole Superman asswipe Christopher Reeve!
STAN
That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one. [Jimmy and Timmy turn and walk away]
CARTMAN
[jumps up and catches up to them] Hey, wait a minute! [Timmy and Jimmy stop] You guys can't just start a club and tell me I can't be in it!
JIMMY
Sorry, able-bodied, you can't join.
CARTMAN
Can too!
JIMMY
[turns to Timmy] Hey Timmy. How many able-bodied people does it take to screw in a light bulb? One. [begins to laugh. Timmy begins to laugh as well] You know what you call an able-bodied guy on the doorstep? Whatever his name is. [Jimmy and Timmy laugh, and walk away laughing]
CARTMAN
Oh God-damnit!!
KYLE
Cartman, just stay out of it.
CARTMAN
But they say I can't be in their club!!
STAN
Cartman, trust me. [Kenny pushes his own truck away] We don't want any part in this one.
["The T-shirt Factory", later. Timmy and Jimmy walk up to it and enter]
JIMMY
Hello, Mr. McGillicuuhuhuhh... Mr. McGillicuddy. [Timmy has a box on his lap]
MCGILLICUDDY
Hello, boys. What can I do for you?
JIMMY
[takes the box from Timmy] Timmy and I made a ...T-shirt design for our new club. [Timmy beams with delight] We just came up with a name this morning. [McGillicuddy opens the box, pulls out the shirt, and his jaw drops. The shirt reads, "THE CRIPS"]
MCGILLICUDDY
Uh... boys, I don't think you wanna wear these shirts.
JIMMY
Why not?
MCGILLICUDDY
Well, because there already is a group that calls themselves the Crips, and I don't think they'd like it too much.
JIMMY
[stunned] ...There's already a Crips?!
MCGILLICUDDY
Well, sure, they're all over at Five Points area in Denver. You've never heard of them?
JIMMY
No, we never have. Are they crippled from birth or are they cripple wannabes like Christopher Reeve?
MCGILLICUDDY
...Oh, I am stayin' out of this one. [leaves the counter]
["The T-shirt Factory", outside. The doors open and Jimmy and Timmy exit]
JIMMY
Can you believe it, Timmy? All this time there was a group for truly crippled people like ourselves, and we didn't know it.
TIMMY
[excited] Timmmeh!
JIMMY
Come on. We have to take the bus to Five Points in Denver.
[The Larry King Show on HNN, on air.]
KING
My guest tonight is the brilliant star of stage and screen, Mr. Christopher Reeve, who, with the help of stem-cell research, is now able to move his arms.
REEVE
Thanks for having me on again, Larry.
KING
All right. Chris, the whole world is waiting. Why don't you show us what stem-cell research has done for you. [with that fixed grin, Reeve strains to lift his right arm a few inches, then sets it down again.] Amazing. Isn't that amazing, folks? Now, Chris, there're some people who say stem-cell research is wrong, that taking cells from a fetus is... unethical.
REEVE
Well, it just proves that the public needs to be educated [catches his breath] about stem-cell research. See, the stem cells from a fetus like this one [pulls a dead fetus up from an unseen container] can form into whatever cells of the body are damaged. They are the most powerful thing on the planet.
KING
And how does someone like yourself make use of the stem cells, Chris?
REEVE
Well, it's very simple. [takes the fetus and cracks it open like a coconut, then sucks out its contents and tosses it aside] And now you can see, my arms have better movement.
KING
Wow. [begins clapping] Wow.
[Five Points, Denver. A bum pushes a cart full of his belongings past Denver Meat Packing, a rundown warehouse. Sirens, gunshots, and a woman's screams are heard.]
JIMMY
Excuse me, sir. [the bum stops, startled] we're looking for a group of people called the Crips.
BUM
You are?
JIMMY
Do you know where they meet? We've already tried the rec center and the library.
BUM
The Crips hang out at that old warehouse down there, [points to the building he just passed] but ...nobody goes in there.
JIMMY
[moves forward] Oh, it's okay. We're Crips ourselves. Come on, Tim-Tim.
TIMMY
Timmmih! [follows]
[Denver Meat Packing, inside. The music is thumping, there's gambling and general conversation going on. Jimmy and Timmy walks in.]
JIMMY
Well hello everyone. [music abruptly stops] I'm Jim Swanson, and this is my friend Timmy.
TIMMY
Timmmih! [awkward silence, then softly] Tih... ti-timmih.
JIMMY
[to a friend at left, as he points to the duo] Well, let us tell you a little bit about ourselves. Timmy and I are both true Crips, born and raised. We're the only Crips in South Park, where we live, and we would love to join your fa-fa-fantastic Denver chapter.
LARGE CRIP
Is they for real, manh?
JIMMY
We just have one question before we join your c-club. Do you think it's better to be born a Crip, or to become a Crip later by accident?
BRAIDED CRIP
The only Crips is born Crips, dawg.
TALL CRIP
Yeah, you can't become a Crip by accident, fool!
JIMMY
I agree. I mean, it's like [enunciates] "come on"! Why do these people who become crippled later in life think they're such great pot-potatuhs?
TIMMY
Timmih! [silence]
JIMMY
Well, we're glad you see it our way, fellas. So can we join your g... group?
BUFF CRIP
All right, you wanna thug with the Five Point Crips? Bitches, all you gotta do is pop some punk-ass Bloods.
JIMMY
Well, sure. Tim and I would love to pop some punk-ass Bloods. We're terrific at it.
TIMMY
Timmih?
JIMMY
[turns and answers softly] I don't know, Timmy, just play along.
TIMMY
Uh-tu-Timmih!
BUFF CRIP
So you sayin' yuh down?
JIMMY
Down like a clown, Charlie Br... Down like a clown, Charlie B-broooowww... Down like a clown, Charlie Browh... Bro-uh-own. Down like a clown, Charlie Br-Brown. [music starts up again, and Timmy and Jimmy leave. As they walk down the street a rap song plays]
JIMMY
Say Timmy, did you notice that all the crippled people in that club are negros?
TIMMY
Timmih!
JIMMY
That's an amm-mmazing coincidence. I mean, there's not one crippled colored person in South Park. [as they walk, a police car rolls up and the passenger-side officer calls out]
OFFICER
Hey you kids.
JIMMY
[stops and looks] Well hello, officers.
OFFICER
What the hell do you think you're doin'?
JIMMY
We're goin' to pop some punk-ass Bloods.
TIMMY
Timmih! [the officers simply look at each other and drive off.]
JIMMY
[sees something] Look, Timmy. There's a convenience store. ["Ribs N Gass." A lot of gang members are milling around in front of the store] That must be what the fellas meant by "pop some punk-ass Bloods." They want us to get them some soda pop and treats. [the gang members notice them coming and stop to look. They cross the street] Let's buy them ginger ale and marshmallows. Then they'll let us in the club for sure.
TIMMY
Oh, Timmih. [a truck appears in the distance and comes up fast.]
DRIVER
[noticing almost too late] Oh shit! [swerves to avoid the duo and slams into the convenience store they were trying to reach. The store and truck go up in a ball of flames while Jimmy and Timmy stop in their tracks]
JIMMY
Suh, suh, suh, suh, Sssunday driver!
[Back at Denver Meat Packing, night. Jimmy and Timmy are back at the warehouse.]
BUFF CRIP
Yo yo, listen up y'all! Let me tell you about my little Gs, Roller and 4 Legs here. They just smoked thirteen Bloods in one night!
CRIP 1
One night?
CRIP 2
You're kiddin'? You're kiddin'? One night?
BUFF CRIP
That ain't never been done before!
58 CRIP
And they got us marshmallows and ginger ale.
CRIPS
[chattering] Uh huh. Cool. He's right.
JIMMY
So does that mean we can join the c-c...club?
BUFF CRIP
You're not just in, you're the baddest mofo Crips in town! Cipac! [a Crip steps forward] Turn up the beat so we can celebrate our new Gs Five-Points style!
CIPAC
All right. [hobbles off]
JIMMY
Wow, these guys really are crippled. [the music starts up and the Crips start dancing] Timmy, I have a feeling that this is the start of something b-b-b-b...b-b-brilliant.
TIMMY
Timmih!
[Jimmy's home. A car drives up and drops off Timmy and Jimmy. The occupants are Crips.]
JIMMY
Thanks for the ride home, fellas. We sure had a ...terrific time.
CIPAC
Alrighty. Keep it real, dawg.
JIMMY
You dawgs keep it real, too. [Cipac flashes the Crips signs for "West Coast Crips" and the boys return the gesture]
TIMMY
Timmih! [the Crips drive off]
JIMMY
Well, that sure was a terrific time. Let's go all around tomorrow and show everyone our new outfits, Timmy.
TIMMY
Timmih! [Jimmy goes on home as Timmy rolls off]
[Jimmy's house, inside. His parents sit before the TV, his mom worried.]
MOM
[jumps up] There you are, Jimmy!
JIMMY
Whatup, Mazie? Ye-yo, Pops?
POPS
Jimmy, your mother was gettin' worried about you.
JIMMY
No need to worry about me. I'm cool like a fool in a swimming ppp-ppp-pp-pp-pool. [turns and hobbles off]
[Outside, somewhere, day. A reporter begins speaking to the camera.]
REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing out front of the Stem Cell Research Facility with terrific news. Christopher Reeve, who was once paralyzed, claims that he can now stand.
REEVE
[flanked by two doctors, one of them carrying a medical organ cooler] Thank you everyone. [pulls out a fetus from the cooler and holds it in his left hand] To most people, this is just an ordinary fetus. But to people like me, [lifts it into the air] it's hope. [snaps it open as before and sucks out its juices.]
CROWD
Uugh.
[Reeve tosses the carcass away, then he drops his feet to the floor, then he slowly rises from his wheelchair and raises his arms in victory. The crowd oooos and ahhhs.]
MR. GARRISON
[arm around Mr. Slave] What an inspiration.
REPORTER
Tom, many celebrities have spoken out in protest of stem-cell research, but, after seeing this, how can they protest now? [Reeve takes out another fetus and sucks it dry. Stan and the boys walk by]
STAN
[admonishing] Stay clear, guys, stay clear.
KYLE
Yup. I'm not seeing anything.
[City Wok, day. Mr. Kim is wiping the counter down. Timmy and Jimmy enter dressed in their Crip outfits.]
MR. KIM
Hey [studies the boys before him, then holds up his arms] Hey, I don't want no trouble!
JIMMY
Hello. We'd like two orders of Kung... Pao Chicken, please.
MR. KIM
I don't want no trouble! You just... take what you want and leave!
TIMMY
Timmih!
MR. KIM
[as if Timmy had barked an order] OH! Okay, okay! [steps to the cash register and opens it] I open register
TIMMY
Timmih!
JIMMY
What's that? Oh, and one medium lemonade, please.
TIMMY
Timmih.
MR. KIM
[pulls out a stack of bills and sets them on the counter, then holds his arms up again] Here. Here one hundred twelve dorrar! It's all I have. Yeh take!
JIMMY
[confused] Huh?
MR. KIM
You take! Uh one hundred twelve dorrar!
JIMMY
Ah- are you sure?
MR. KIM
I no want no trouble. Just take it and leave!
JIMMY
[approaches the counter. Mr. Kim goes about preparing the food order] Well gee, that's really nice of you, Mr. ...Chinese person. [gets the money and shows it to Timmy] Look Tim-Tim, we got a cash prize. We must be the ...one hundredth customer or something.
MR. KIM
Here! Here two order of Kung Pao Chicken, and small ice tea!
JIMMY
Actually, it was a regular lemonade.
MR. KIM
[mortified at his error] AAAAAGH-agh!! [bows] I sorry! I sorry! I no want no trouble. [reaches for a cup and prepares a regular lemonade] Here. Remonade. [sets it on the counter. Jimmy reaches for it] Now go, just go!
JIMMY
Gee, thanks a lot. See you next time.
TIMMY
[smiles] Timmih!
MR. KIM
[soon lowers his arms and places a call] Hello! Police? I've just been robbed by two gang members!
[Jimmy's house, later. His parents are standing by the kitchen's breakfast nook sipping coffee. A door opens in the living room, then closes.]
POPS
Jimmy? Jimmy, could you come into the kitchen please?
JIMMY
[enters] Yo, Mamsie. What's up, Pops?
POPS
Uh have a seat, Jim. Your mother and I need to talk to you. [Jimmy approaches a chair and struggles to climb up on it. He gets no help from his parents. He succeeds in climbing the chair, then in sitting upright. He settles down.] Son, your mother and I have noticed a change in your behavior. And... we're worried that you might be involved in a gang.
JIMMY
A what? Oh, you mean the fellas. Well sure. But I can't talk about the club on account of its sssuper secret, dawg.
MAMSIE
Then it's true! Oh, Ryan, it's true! [buries her face in Ryan's chest and sobs uncontrollably]
JIMMY
Why you be trippin', Mom? I mean [enunciates the nest two words] come on. I'm finally a part of something, very much.
RYAN
Jimmy, those people you're hanging out with are no good.
JIMMY
Yo, don't be dissing my n***as, dawg. They're my f-friends.
MAMSIE
And what about your standup comedy, Jim, huh? Are you just giving up on that, too?
JIMMY
[now naturally] Nobody cared about my standup comedy! All that hard work just to be outshined by C-Christopher Reeve the super b-butthole!
RYAN
Uh Jimmy, we've told you before. God made you the way he did for a reason!
JIMMY
Right. Because you and Mom used to make fun of crippled kids in high school.
RYAN
That's right. You were sent here through the vengeful and angry hand of God to teach your mother and I a lesson. And that's a big responsibility, son.
JIMMY
Look! My gang, which I can't talk about because it's super secret, is the most important thing to me now! And if you two don't like it, you can just pass the blunt to the n***a on your left. [hops off the chair and ambles off. His mom sobs again. Ryan holds her]
[A darkened lab. Christopher Reeve is pacing back and forth, having a headache.]
REEVE
Where's that delivery of new fetuses?! Feeling weak again.
AIDE
[rushes in with a fresh delivery] Here's the new shipment, sir. [Reeve lunges for the box and rips it out of the aide's hands, pushing the aide away] Hey! [Reeve tears into the box, opens the cooler, grabs a fetus, and starts sucking its juices out. A few seconds later, a door at the far wall opens]
MAN
Hello there, Christopher. [Reeve is upset that he's been disturbed, but turns around and turns pleasant]
REEVE
Well, well, Gene Hackman, my nemesis from the movies. How are you?
HACKMAN
I'm good. You?
REEVE
I am better with each passing day. [turns around and pulls out another fetus] Stronger and more agile. [sucks its juices out as Hackman looks on]
HACKMAN
Christopher, I've come to ask you to stop what you're doing?
REEVE
[with fetus still on his lips] What?
HACKMAN
Using stem cells is like playing God. You should leave nature alone.
REEVE
And go back to the way I was? Is that what you're saying, Hackman?
HACKMAN
I'm saying that sometimes you need to just live with the cards you're dealt, Christopher.
REEVE
[raises his arms in a fit of rage, then turns away] Stop calling me Christopher! That name no longer has meaning to me! Christopher was someone who lived in a wheelchair! Always being pushed around by others! The old Christopher Reeve is dead! From now on, I am... [looks back menacingly] Chris!
[Jimmy's house, night, living room. He sits on the floor between the couch and the coffee table working on a jigsaw puzzle.]
JIMMY
Sixty-five... bottles of... beer on the wall. Six- [outside, a car rolls up to the house slowly. Four Bloods look at the house, all of them with masks on]
BLOOD
[front passenger side] Payback time, mothafucka! [the Bloods starts spraying the house with bullets]
JIMMY
[looks around as the bullets tear up the windows] Jesus Christ! [dives to the floor and crawls to the other side of the table, then rises up.] Holy G...guacamole! [the bullets start tearing up the couch and the front door. Jimmy dives to the floor, then rises up a few seconds later.] Freakin' Frijoles! [dives to the floor again. The front door is gone and the couch's stuffing is all over the place. Its springs pop out. The right-side portrait next to the door falls. The bullets stop, and Jimmy rises once again] Leapin' L-langosta. [the left-side portrait falls]
BLOOD
East Side Bloods! [the Bloods drop back into their car and peel off. Some time later, Officer Barbrady and his men show up to take reports and check out the crime scene. Timmy has returned to be with Jimmy. Two people walk up to the Swansons]
HYDE
We're Detectives Hyde and Richardson from the Special Gang unit in Denver.
JIMMY
Any word on who shot up me and Timmy's houses, officer?
RICHARDSON
Word on the street is it was a retaliation hit by the Bloods.
JIMMY
The... B-Bloods?
HYDE
You know, smart-mouth! Your rival gang! The Bloods are at war with the Crips, they kill each other all the time!
JIMMY
The-they do??
RICHARDSON
Don't act like you don't know, you lil' punk! The Crips and Bloods hate each other, and if you stay in that gang, you're gonna end up dead too.
JIMMY
But... but why do they hate each other?
HYDE
Look kid, I used to be a Crip myself, but I'm not anymore!
JIMMY
Oh, so you used sssytemm cells like Christopher Reeve?
HYDE
[realizes this conversation is fruitless] Come on. The only way these kids are gonna get out of their gang is get killed. [the detectives leave. Jim's mom begins to sob and then runs into the house.]
RYAN
[follows her in] Sarah!
JIMMY
[begins to pace before Timmy] Oh boy, Timmy, we should have never started a gang for people crippled from birth. Now they're at war with the people who are crippled from an accident. Boy were we wrong.
TIMMY
[agreeing] Tim-mih.
JIMMY
Wow, w-we've got to do something, Timmy. We've gotta get the Crips and Bloods to s-stop fighting. I bet if we could just get them together... but how? Wu-wait a minute! I've got it! A lock-in at the rec center! We did it for our church once. All we do is rent out the rec center overnight. They lock the doors so nobody can leave, and then everyone has the whole night to play in the swimming pool and laugh and talk.
TIMMY
Timmih!!
JIMMY
You get all the Crips you can to the rec center tomorrow night, Timmy. And I'll try to get all the ...Bloods there.
TIMMY
Timmih!!
JIMMY
This is gonna be t-terrific!
[South Park, next day, in front of Tom's Rhinoplasty.]
REPORTER
[same as before] Tom, several years ago, actor Christopher Reeve had a horrible accident and was paralyzed. The irony, of course, is that the man who played Superman could no longer walk. America watched in wonder as he managed to move one of his fingers, then his arms. And now, seen for the first time on HBC, Christopher Reeve is going to lift a truck up over his head. [Christopher walks over to a green truck and lifts the front end up over his head. The crowd oohs and claps for him]
RANDY
Oh, what a fighter.
GERALD
That brave, brave man.
LIANE
He's an inspiration to us all.
REPORTER
Tom, the irony is even more irony-y as it appears that the stem cells have given Christopher Reeve almost superhuman strength.
HACKMAN
[appears with a crowd of people] Chris, that's enough!
REEVE
[looks at Hackman and drops the truck] Hello, Gene! So good to see you!
HACKMAN
You're cured, Chris. It's time to stop using stem cells.
REEVE
Stem-cell research has made me stronger than I ever thought possible! Why stop now?!
REPORTER
Uh Tom, apparently, Gene Hackman, the man who played Superman's enemy Lex Luthor in the movies, has now shown up as a celebrity protester of stem-cell research. If that isn't ironic, Tom, I don't know what is.
HACKMAN
They're affecting your mind, Chris. If you won't stop using stem cells, then we'll stop you!
REEVE
Stop me?! Stop me?! HA!! [reaches over, picks up the truck clear over his head, and throws it at Hackman. Hackman and his crowd jump clear of the truck's path, screaming. The truck lands upside down where the crown stood. Reeve then runs down the street and onto a car] You won't stop me, Hack Man! [runs off the truck and jumps away maniacally] Ha HA! Ha HA! Ha haa haa! [jumps higher and higher until he clears buildings with each jump] Ya ha ha! Yaa haha!
REPORTER
Tom, if irony were made of strawberries, we'd all be drinking a lot of smoothies right now.
[Denver Recreation Center, night. Gang members file through the doors. Jimmy and Timmy greet everyone at the door. Timmy is disguised as Groucho Marx, Jimmy wears a ten-gallon hat.]
JIMMY
Come on in, everybody. Lots of su-surprises and t-treats inside. [the last of the guests enter] Great to see you all. What a terrific audience.
JANITOR
[an elderly man soon exits] Are you sure you got everything you need, young man?
JIMMY
We sure do. Thanks, Mr. Apple...b-by.
MR. APPLEBY
Just remember to make sure the kids play safe in the pool area.
JIMMY
You bet. [he and Timmy move around him and into the center]
MR. APPLEBY
I'll be back at seven to let you out. You kids have a good time.
JIMMY
Oh, we will. [Mr. Appleby closes the door and locks it.]
[Denver Recreation Center, inside. A group of Bloods enter the gym and stop in their tracks. At the other end of the gym is a group of Crips, seated on some bleachers behind a basketball hoop. The Crips stand in reply.]
BUFF CRIP
The Bloods!
BLOOD 1
Oh shit! It's a trap!
BLOOD 2
Muthafuckin Crips tryin' to smoke us all out!
CRIP
What the hell is goin' on here? [Jimmy and Timmy step into the middle ground between the two gangs]
JIMMY
It's called a lock-in at the rec center. We can use all the rec center facilities. We can play basketball, go swimming, or even just kick it in the lounge area with some games and ...p-puzzles.
TIMMY
Timmih!
JIMMY
But nobody can leave until it's seven a.m., so if you wanna have a good time, you're all just gonna have to learn to get along. [immediately, both sides draw weapons and aim them at each other. Once all the weapons are out...] Theeerrre's pizzaaa.
[Nighttime, near the city. The reporter stands next to a man-made lake.]
REPORTER
Tom, over five years ago, doctors told Christopher Reeve that he would never walk again, but the resilient actor fought back, struggled against all odds, and has now built his very own Legion of Doom! [Its headquarters now appears behind him] The once immobile Mr. Reeve's new organization will be committed to world domination and evil. What an inspirational story, Tom.
[Legion of Doom Headquarters, inside. Christopher Reeve is standing before a group of villains, both real and imagined.]
REEVE
I have chosen each member of this elite group of supervillains for their outstanding treachery, [Osama bin Laden and Dr. Doom are shown, then Blank Manta and Saddam Hussein] Their desire for world conquest, [Cheetah, Kim Jong-il, and David Blaine are shown] and their hatred of all things good! [Professor Chaos is shown] And I've assembled this group for one purpose! To once and for all find a way to... [the picture behind him changes from a fist smashing Earth to a picture of Gene Hackman] get rid of Hack Man!! [laughs maniacally for effect, but no other villain moves]
DR. DOOM
Uhhh, how about domination of the world?
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Yeah. Or uh, death to the infidels?
REEVE
Silence! OUR job is to see to it that Hack Man is put out of commission.
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Oh boy, General Disarray, may- maybe we just ought to stay outta this one.
HACKMAN
[bursts through the doors with his supporters] Not so fast, Chris!
REEVE
[sucking on yet another fetus] Hack Man!
HACKMAN
We just helped pass a ban on stem-cell research. Your fetus-sucking days are over!
REEVE
No... [grabs his head in frustration] NOOOO!
HACKMAN
And now we're going to put you somewhere where you can never touch another fetus again!
[Denver Recreation Center, inside. The Bloods and Crips challenge each other.]
BUFF CRIP
You stupid mofos are dead!
BLOOD 3
Make the first shot, punk!
JIMMY
Hold it! Don't you see? It doesn't matter if we were crippled from birth, or crippled in an accident. We're all brothers.
BLOOD 4
Save it, fool! Crips ain't our brothers! [the atmosphere grows tense]
JIMMY
Look, we have the whole rec room to ourselves. Can't we all just try having some fun together?
58 CRIP
You talkin' crazy, dawg.
BLOOD 5
Yeah, we ain't playin', sucka!
JIMMY
Why don't we at least give it a chance? I mean, [enunciates] Come on! [several tense seconds pass]
BUFF CRIP
Wait a minute. What did you say?
JIMMY
I said, "I mean, [enunciates] Come on!"
BLOOD 4
You know, maybe he's right. I mean, [enunciates] Come on!
JIMMY
[enunciates] Come on.
BUFF CRIP
I guess we could at least give havin' fun together a try. It's like [enunciates] Come on.
BLOOD 6
Yeah. Come on.
CRIP 2
Yeah, that's right. Come on.
JIMMY
Come on.
SOMEONE
Come on.
ALL
[in agreement] Yeah, that's right. Come on. [moments later rap music is playing, gang members gather in the pool and one prepares for a dive. In the gym gang members play basketball without arguing. One of them dances along the foul line. In another room gang members play pool. The camera stops at Jimmy and three members - two Crips and one Blood]
BUFF CRIP
I've gotta give you two dawgs props for puttin' an end to all this hate.
JIMMY
I told you, lock-ins at the rec center always work. And you know, I've learned something, too. I was player-hatin' Christopher Butthole Reeve because he got more attention than me. But just like... y-you guys, I need to learn to control my a... anger.
BLOOD
Right on!
CRIP
[walks up to Timmy] Hey little roller, try some of this chronic shit.
TIMMY
Timmih! [takes a hit. Both Crips and Bloods laugh]
JIMMY
I guess we all learned that trying to get along is way better than p... player hatin'. [a song begins, and Jimmy approaches the camera] The gang wrote a song about it. Why don't we listen in?
GANG MEMBERS
It used to be that Crips and Bloods didn't get along,
But now we're all a family, so we wrote this song.
Naaa na naaa, Crips and Bloods. Naaa na naaa, hope and love.
Naaa na naaa, friendly thugs.
[Outer space. Christopher Reeve is flung into space in a pane of glass.]
REEVE
You haven't seen the last of me, Hack Man! I will be back!!
[The woods near South Park, night. Stan and friends watch the celestial spectacle.]
STAN
Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one.
KYLE
Me too.
End of Krazy Kripples


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Cartman convinces the boys to "toilet paper" their teacher's house, but Kyle is overwhelmed with guilt.

script:Toilet Paper

[South Park Elementary, day. A new classroom. As the camera follows a new teacher around, the following kids are seen working with clay. Clyde presses the pottery wheel pedal as Bebe molds a vase on the wheel. Wendy watches. Tweek, Red, and Pip work on clay on the table near the wall. In the foreground, Tolkien presses the pottery wheel pedal as Annie molds a vase. Butters, Kevin, and Francis work on their own projects. Kenny, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are laughing at their project, which didn't require the use of the pottery wheel.]
TEACHER
[walks through the class] Okay. Good, children, good. Remember to feel the clay. Be one with the clay. Nice. Uh huh. [the boys still laugh at their monument]
CARTMAN
[laughing] Put more clay on the balls.
TEACHER
[noticing] Boys! [they stop laughing as she points] What is that?
KYLE
A reindeer?
TEACHER
You know, I've had it! You four boys never take art class seriously!
CARTMAN
[retorts] What a crime. [the three others chuckle, then laugh out loud]
TEACHER
[displeased, with arms crossed] You think art is not important?
STAN
Weelll, art is just kinda... for gaywads.
BUTTERS
[pipes up] I love art class!
STAN
See?
TEACHER
[reaches for their creation and grabs it by the shaft] Do you think this is funny?! [shakes it around for effect] Do you think this is funny, huh?! [ends up looking at the head, as if she's about to suck on it. The boys hold their laughter, knowing how she looks with their creation like that, but soon they burst out laughing. The teacher now cradles the project] Well, you four can just spend your afternoon after school here making new pottery! [the laughter stops and the boys' jaws drop.]
CARTMAN
You can't do that!
TEACHER
I certainly can! I'm your teacher!
CARTMAN
You're an art teacher!
TEACHER
Make it two hours!
[Cut to after school in detention. The art teacher sits at her desk watching over the boys work on a proper vase on the pottery wheel. Kyle is pressing the pedal. The boys are angry at their teacher]
STAN
Mrs. Streibel thinks she's so cool!
KYLE
How dare she talk to us like that?!
KENNY
(Yeah, how the fuck is that?!)
CARTMAN
We can't let her get away with this! [voicing dropping to almost a whisper] I think tonight we need to do something drastic.
STAN
Like what?
CARTMAN
Like find out where Mrs. Streibel lives, and go over there, and... TP her house.
KENNY
(Yeah!)
KYLE
TP her house?
CARTMAN
Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.
KYLE
Oh.
CARTMAN
[sensing Kyle's reluctance] What's the matter, Kyle? You chicken? [begins strutting like a chicken and making chicken noises. Kyle kicks Cartman in the balls in anger] Ugh! [drops to his knees, then gets one leg up]
TEACHER
Quiet, boys. This isn't playtime, you're being punished!
STAN
[glares back at her, then softly] Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, art-whore!
CARTMAN
[in pain] Yeah! Payback time, you ugly skank!
[Henry's Supermarket, day. A woman watches her son ride in a coin-operated ride outside the store. Inside, the four boys approach checkout line 3 with two carts stacked high with packages of Kush Tush toilet paper.]
STAN
D'you think that's enough?
CARTMAN
Should be fine.
KYLE
Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.
CARTMAN
Okay. [reaches behind the other boys and grabs something] Here we go, pack of chewing gum. [tosses it into the first cart. They approach the cash register]
CASHIER
Hello boys. Find everything you need?
CARTMAN
Yep. All set.
CASHIER
[begins scanning the packages] Mkay', let's see here. Toilet paper ["beep" $1.50 for a four-pack] Toilet paper ["beep"] Toilet paper ["beep"] Toilet paper ["beep"] Toilet paper ["beep"] So, what are you kids up to tonight? ["beep"]
CARTMAN
Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game.
CASHIER
Nice relaxing night at home, huh? Toilet paper ["beep"] Toilet paper ["beep"] Aaand toilet paper ["beep." He picks up the gum] Eh, hey. [holds up the gum] Now you kids be careful with this chewing gum. Don't go sticking it under tables.
STAN
Okay
CASHIER
Okay. Toilet paper ["beep"] Toilet paper ["beep"] Toilet paper ["beep."] You know, son, I remember you comin' in last week and buying this much toilet paper. ["beep"]
CARTMAN
Heh yeah, that that's right.
CASHIER
... Toilet paper ["beep"] Toilet paper ["beep"]
KYLE
You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman?
CARTMAN
No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night.
KYLE
Oh. [flashes disgust] Uuugh.
[Mrs. Streibel's house, later, that night. The boys walk up to the house carrying black trash bags of toilet paper.]
STAN
Is this the right house?
CARTMAN
It's the right address-wait! Look there! [the teacher prepares the dining-room table] There's Mrs. Streibel! This is the place. [loosens the drawstring on his back and lets the sides fall away. In the dining room, a boy and girl arrive and sit at table]
KYLE
Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside.
CARTMAN
So?
KYLE
So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it!
STAN
Kyle, we all agreed to do this!
KYLE
We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!
CARTMAN
Kyle, you're being an asshole! Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah. [takes out a roll and advances a bit] Here's what I think of your art class, you God-damned bitch! [unleashes the first roll]
KENNY
(Yeah! Fuck you!)
[Majestic music plays as Kenny unleashes his roll. Stan unleashes a roll. Cartman tosses off another one and grins. More rolls of paper fly onto the roof. Kyle tosses up a roll, unsure of doing so. Stan unleashes another one, and his glee is unabashed. Kenny tosses off another one. More and more rolls fly over the roof. Kyle freezes in awe of their vandalism. Toilet paper covers the house, the garage, and the trees around the house. The boys head for the sidewalk.]
CARTMAN
Come on, let's go! [he and Kenny cross the road and drop down to a ditch on the other side. Stan follows]
KYLE
What have we done? [Stan looks back and gets Kyle]
STAN
Let's go, Kyle! [drags him off. Kyle is transfixed for a bit, then turns to follow Stan. A last shot of the house, and then the boys reach their bus stop gasping for air.]
[The bus stop]
KYLE
We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble.
CARTMAN
Aw man, that was sooo awesome! [smiles]
KYLE
How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them days to clean that up!
CARTMAN
Who cares??
KYLE
Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Me?? [takes a couple steps forward] There's toilet paper on your hands, too, Kyle. [Kyle blanches]
STAN
Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together.
[Kyle's house, after bedtime. Kyle's room. He is asleep, but begins to have nightmares.]
KYLE
Noo! No. [visions of flying toilet paper fill his head.] Noo! [an image of Mrs. Streibel's house being vandalized further, then of Mrs. Streibel running in horror.]
MRS. STREIBEL
AAAAAAAAA!
MR. STREIBEL
Honey, what is it?? Oh, Jesus no! Our house!
STREIBEL DAUGHTERS
[crying] Mommy! Mommy!
MR. STREIBEL
[with her family around her] Whyyy? Whyyy?
KYLE
[wakes up, startled] Ah! Oh God! Oh God!
[South Park Elementary, next day. The kids are in their regular classroom chatting, waiting for class to begin.]
BUTTERS
Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Streibel's house got covered with toilet paper.
CLYDE
Yeah. They say it's gonna take three weeks to get it all down.
CARTMAN
Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streibel probably had it comin' to her.
BUTTERS
I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves that kind of brutality.
CARTMAN
Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caught, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime. [the bell rings and Mr. Garrison enters with some books.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay children, let's take our seats. Oh, uh, Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the counselor wants to see you in his office, now.
CARTMAN
[snaps his fingers] Damn!
KYLE
Oh God!
[Outside the counselor's office. The boys sit on chairs next to the door - the bench is gone. Kyle looks around nervously.]
KYLE
How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?
CARTMAN
Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine.
STAN
We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.
CARTMAN
Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.
KYLE
I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality
STAN
Yes, dude!
CARTMAN
Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??
KYLE
Ah, Ah I, ah I thought...
CARTMAN
[exasperated] Oh, for Christ's sake!
STAN
Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody.
CARTMAN
Thank you, Stan. [the doorknow begins to turn] Sh sh, here they come, here they come. [the door opens and Mr. Mackey appears] "And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?
MR. MACKEY
We're gonna talk to you one at a time, boys, m'kay? Kenny, will you step into my office, please?
KENNY
(Me??)
MR. MACKEY
Come on, Kenny, let's go, 'k? [Kenny hops off and enters the office, and Mr. Mackey closes the door. The other boys' jaws drop a bit.]
CARTMAN
Touchй, Mr. Mackey, touchй.
KYLE
Why are they doing us one at a time?
CARTMAN
They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal.
KYLE
[brightens up] I can get a better deal?
CARTMAN
Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!
[The Streibel house. Mr. Streibel is removing the toilet paper from the trees and house with a broom. He's already filled two trash bags of toilet paper and is filling a third.]
MR. STREIBEL
There we go. That should be about the last of it. [Officer Barbrady passes by with police tape, stretching it out from tree to tree. The camera pulls back to show the house is also covered in police tape] Ex- excuse me, uh, wha-what are you doing?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Crime scene investigation! [pulls out a small tape recorder and starts speaking into it] There are several footprints in the snow. Perhaps more than one perpetrator? [turns it off]
MR. STREIBEL
Ah... look, we really don't wanna make a big deal out of this.
OFFICER BARBRADY
[noticing the trash bags] Is that the toilet paper there? I'll need to take those bags as evidence.
MR. STREIBEL
Look it's just not that big a deal, I mean, I toilet-papered houses myself when I was a kid.
OFFICER BARBRADY
You?! So where were you last night at around 9?!
MR. STREIBEL
I was here.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Aha!! Got you!
MR. STREIBEL
Officer, why would I TP my own house?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Insurance?
MR. STREIBEL
It wasn't me, okay? Now, if you don't mind, I just wanna get my yard back to normal.
OFFICER BARBRADY
[grabs him by the collar] Now you listen to me! Whoever TP'ed your house is still out there roaming the streets. It's only a matter of time before another house and another family is victimized! I have to stop that from happening.
MR. STREIBEL
You really have nothing better to do, do you?
OFFICER BARBRADY
No I do not.
[Kyle's house, after bedtime. Kyle's room. He is asleep, but the nightmares return.]
KYLE
Noo! No. [visions of flying toilet paper fill his head.] Noo! [an image of Mrs. Streibel's house being vandalized further, then of Mrs. Streibel running in horror.]
MRS. STREIBEL
AAAAAAAAA!
MR. STREIBEL
Oh, Jesus no! Our house!
STREIBEL DAUGHTERS
[crying] Mommy! Mommy!
NANCY KERRIGAN
[being treated on the ice rink] Whyyy? Whyyy? Whyyy?
KYLE
[wakes up, startled] Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth! [hops off the bed and runs to the bedroom door] Mooooomm! [opens the door and finds Cartman in the hallway]
CARTMAN
[in rave tones] Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere?
KYLE
I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.
CARTMAN
No need. I have one for you right here. [presents a glass of water to him]
KYLE
[takes the glass] Oh. Okay. Thanks.
CARTMAN
Is there anything else I can get for you?
KYLE
Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now.
CARTMAN
You do that. Goodnight, Kyle. [closes the door]
[Park County Juvenile Hall, day. Inside, the warden leads Officer Barbrady to Cell Block 4.]
WARDEN
Josh Meyers TP'ed over six hundred houses in less than a year. [fumbles for his keys.] He's a real monster.
OFFICER BARBRADY
I just need to talk to someone who knows how toilet paperers think.
WARDEN
Just remember: he'd toilet-paper you in a second if he had the chance. [finally opens the door] He's the last cell on your left. [Barbrady enters and finds himself in an old part of the Hall. He walks past the prisoners and arrives at Josh's cell. It is a brick cell with a thick glass wall where prison bars would normally be. Holes in the glass allow for conversation. Josh has paintings of toilet paper around the cell.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Hello, Josh. My name is Officer Barbrady. I'm with the South Park police.
JOSH
[affecting a Hopkins accent] That's a terrible cologne you're wearing, officer. You should try something more... casual.
OFFICER BARBRADY
I was hoping you could help me solve a toilet-papering case?
JOSH
And why would I do that? Because I'm such a charming fella?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Uh please, I need your help. What would you want in return?
JOSH
[turns away] Due to the harsh nature of my crimes they don't allow me to have toilet paper in my cell. You can imagine how bothersome that becomes.
OFFICER BARBRADY
You... know I can't give you toilet paper, Josh.
JOSH
[turns back] No, but it was worth a try, wasn't it? [a closeup of Josh's face] Tell me something, officer: why is it that you police such a small town. You must have had larger inspirations. What happened to those... big-city dreams?
OFFICER BARBRADY
[reflecting] Well, that's kind of personal.
JOSH
[extreme closeup] Quid pro quo, officer. Tell me what I want to know. And I'll help you catch whoever toilet-papered that house.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Look kid, I have very little time to catch whoever toilet-papered that house. Tell me what you know.
JOSH
Are those the crime scene photos? Let me see them. [approaches the drop slot as Barbrady slides the packet of photos in, then walks back and takes them out for review.] Yes. Yes. Not bad work, not bad at all. These toilet-paperers are professionals...at least one of them is.
OFFICER BARBRADY
So you think there was more than one. Why?
JOSH
[puts the photos behind his back] Tell me something first. When you went to the academy you had something to prove. You wanted to protect and serve, but mostly you wanted to protect yourself. Who were you protecting yourself from, Officer Barbrady?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh all right, all right, my uncle Charles used to hit me with a belt! [cries uncontrollably]
JOSH
[closes his eyes, satisfied.] Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most like males between the ages of 8 and 10 and probably virgins. Parents notice that much toilet paper missing, so they would have to have bought it themselves. Find out where the toilet paper came from, officer, and you just might catch your man.
[South Park Elementary, day. Kids are moving towards their classes, passing each other in the process. Stan and Kenny are talking with Clyde, Craig, and Kevin.]
CARTMAN
Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second? [Stan waves bye to Clyde, Craig, and Kevin, and they leave. He and Kenny approach Cartman talks in hushed tones] I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle.
STAN
What about him?
CARTMAN
Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack.
KENNY
(I think so too.)
CARTMAN
Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.
BUTTERS
[walks up] Ha-ey fellas. [Cartman and Kenny avoid eye contact with Butters]
STAN
Butters. [looks down, then away, then sniffs, then clears his throat. After a while, Butters just walks off]
CARTMAN
[a few seconds later] Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is!
STAN
So what should we do?
CARTMAN
We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.
STAN
[just looks at Cartman] ... Dude, we're not killing Kyle!
KENNY
(Yeah!)
CARTMAN
Why not?
STAN
Kyle's not gonna say anything, alright?
CARTMAN
He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us. [walks off]
[South Park Police Department.]
CASHIER
You wanted to see me, Officer Barbrady?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Yes, thanks for coming, Mr. Bell. A house was TP'ed in South Park and I need to see if you can identify the toilet paper I recovered from the scene. [walks up to a body bag] I'm... sorry I have to do this. [unzips the bag and recoils with Bell at the apparent foul odor. They both cough]
MR. BELL
Oh my God.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Is this toilet paper from your store?
MR. BELL
It's... difficult to tell, it's... so decayed, I... wait a minute, yes. Yes, I recognize the floral pattern now.
OFFICER BARBRADY
[takes out the tape recorder, turns it on, and speaks into it] Positive ID on the toilet paper. [turns it off and puts it away]
MR. BELL
Who would... do this to toilet paper? Who?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Mr. Bell, do you remember anyone suspicious buying toilet paper in the last few days?
MR. BELL
Suspicious like how?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, like someone who was black or Mexican or Middle Eastern.
MR. BELL
Nnoo, the only Mexican guy I recall bought toasted tarts and chips and... we don't allow Middle Eastern people in the store. [arrives at a realization] Oh my God! [vomits]
[Stark's Pond, night. A low fog moves over the surface of the water.]
KYLE
What's this all about, Cartman?
CARTMAN
I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride?
KYLE
A boat ride?
CARTMAN
I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.
KYLE
Well, okay.
CARTMAN
Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat? [Kyle walks over and helps Cartman load the block and chain onto the boat. Kyle then hops in. Cartman retrieves a bat, loads it onto the boat, and hops in. The boat begins to float away from the shore.] Okay, let's go. [starts to row. The boat heads for the middle of the pond, and eerie music plays] So how are things, Kyle?
KYLE
Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.
CARTMAN
And you feel like you have to confess.
KYLE
I don't know what to do. [Cartman reaches for the bat while Kyle has his back to him] Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now. [Cartman takes aim] Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before. [Cartman moves the bat around, measuring Kyle] So cold. The world can feel like that. [Cartman moves forward, ready to whack him] So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens. [Cartman takes a whack at Kyle's head, but all Kyle does is blink] Ow. [rubs his head and turns around] What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
CARTMAN
I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while. [whacks him again]
KYLE
Cartman!
CARTMAN
Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness. [whacks him twice more]
KYLE
You wanna kill me?! Fine! [turns around and crosses his arms] I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it! [Cartman lowers the bat and thinks a bit, then resumes whacking Kyle. Once. Then eight more times.]
CARTMAN
Won't be long, Kyle. [whacks him three more times.]
[Juvenile Hall, day. Barbrady returns to Cell Block 4.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Josh, I need your help.
JOSH
The answer is right in front of you, but you can't see it.
OFFICER BARBRADY
How do you mean?
JOSH
Tell me, the toilet paper. Was it quilted?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Yes.
JOSH
Single-sheet?
OFFICER BARBRADY
No, two-ply. [Josh closes his eyes and thinks hard] What? What does that tell you?
JOSH
Why does one toilet-paper houses
OFFICER BARBRADY
To get revenge.
JOSH
No, that is incidental. Your toilet-paperers wanted to transform the art teacher's house, thus transforming her entire occupation.
OFFICER BARBRADY
What do you mean?
JOSH
Your uncle, who hit you with a belt. Was he a large man?
OFFICER BARBRADY
I don't have time for this, kid.
JOSH
Did he stink like bayer when he came home from work all powoor from playin' down at the pool house?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Alright alright my dad dressed me up like a little girl on poker nights and he made me sit on all my uncles' laps! [cries uncontrollably]
JOSH
Whoa. Uh, oh. Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most likely students in the art teacher's class, students who aren't very good at art.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh. Of course! One of her students!
JOSH
Fly along now, Officer Barbrady. You've got some arrests to make. [turns around and whispers to himself] Fly fly flyyy. Fly fly flyyy.
WARDEN
[arrives at Josh's cell] Josh, [the smile vanishes from Josh's face] were you doing the silly voice for the policeman again?
JOSH
[normal voice] No, sir.
[Stark's pond, night. Cartman is still whacking away at Kyle, in vain. Stan and Kenny come up in a pedal-powered boat. Both of them are pedaling. Stan looks over.]
STAN
Cartman, what are you doing?
CARTMAN
I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours.
STAN
You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed!
CARTMAN
They did?
KYLE
They did?
STAN
They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.
KYLE
Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense.
CARTMAN
But can I still kill Kyyyle?
[South Park Police Department, day. The boys head for the station and enter.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Hello boys. How are you?
STAN
We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true?
OFFICER BARBRADY
It sure is!
CARTMAN
Uh, can we see them-him-her?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Right over here. [takes the boys over to the one jail cell] Yeah, we interrogated the suspect for over forty hours, and he finally cracked. [the boys turn right to see the suspect]
BUTTERS
Hey fellas!
STAN
Butters?
BUTTERS
Yep. I'm in jail.
KYLE
You con-fessed?
BUTTERS
Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP'ed the art teacher's house. [thoughtful] I don't seem to remember it, [normal] but they're pretty sure it was me. [approaches the bars and grabs them] I just can't get my behavior under control!
!OFFICER BARBRADY
His parents are on their way down now.
BUTTERS
Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here!
KYLE
[turns away, and the other boys huddle around him] You guys, we can't let him do this!
CARTMAN
What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!
BUTTERS
Well I'm just a little asshole, is what I am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!
KYLE
Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP that house.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Why do you say that?
KYLE
Because it was-
CARTMAN
[rushes up and intervenes] Wiffle ball, anyone? [glares at Kyle] Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball?
BUTTERS
You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too.
OFFICER BARBRADY
All right, boys, visiting time is over. Thanks for stopping by.
[South Park Police Department, outside. The boys leave the station.]
CARTMAN
You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?
KYLE
I still feel bad, Cartman
CARTMAN
What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.
KYLE
Yeah. That makes it even worse.
CARTMAN
Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever.
KYLE
I know.
CARTMAN
So... so then, how can you feel bad?
STAN
He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.
CARTMAN
...But he's not gonna get in trouble.
STAN
It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad. [to Kyle] I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess.
KENNY
(Yeah, maybe we should.)
CARTMAN
What?? Eh... [tries to be upbeat] hey you guys! There's nothing to feel bad about! We're, we're off scot-free!
KYLE
We feel bad for other people.
CARTMAN
[looks at the other boys in disbelief] For oth-er... [winces] Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later?
STAN
Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do. [points an accusing finger at Cartman] And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same! [He, Kyle, and Kenny leave]
CARTMAN
Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man!
[South Park Police Department. The Stotches arrive at the police station and charge in.]
STEPHEN
Well well well! I had to see it to believe it! [approaches the jail cell]
BUTTERS
Hi, Dad.
STEPHEN
Don't you "Hi, Dad" me! Look at you! Standing behind prison bars! Again!
BUTTERS
Yeah.
LINDA
What fibs have you been telling this policeman, Butters?! You know damn well you didn't toilet-paper that house!
OFFICER BARBRADY
Huh??
STEPHEN
Butters was with us all night, Officer Barbrady.
LINDA
Butters, what have we told you about confessing to crimes you didn't commit?! We have had it, mister!
BUTTERS
Well, he kept accusin' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.
STEPHEN
And that's your excuse?!
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, looks like I made a mistake. I... guess I'd better let you out now. [goes to the cell door and opens it]
STEPHEN
Just wait till we get you home, you little fibber!
BUTTERS
[steps back from the door] Officer, can I stay in jail, please?
[The woods near Stark's Pond, evening. Eric appears and calls out to people behind him.]
CARTMAN
Come on, you guys! Hurry! [steps forward and looks back to his friends] Guys, hurry!
STAN
[appears] What is it, Cartman? [Kyle and Kenny trail Stan]
CARTMAN
It's over this way! Come on!
[Stark's Pond, later. Cartman rows the small boat to the middle of the lake, as he did before with Kyle. Lonely music plays, as before.]
CARTMAN
So how are things, guys?
STAN
Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final.
CARTMAN
I'm afraid I can't let that happen.
KYLE
You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Can't I? [pulls out the Wiffle ball bat and starts whacking the other three. They just look at each other.]
[South Park Elementary, next day. Officer Barbrady enters the principal's office.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Excuse me, everyone. [Mr. Mackey and Mrs. Streibel turn around. Principal Victoria sits at her desk] I have someone with me who can tell us all who toilet-papered the art teacher's house! [the door opens and Josh is rolled in tied up to a dolly by a policeman. He quickly looks to his left] Josh insisted he be able to tell you the names of the toilet paperers in person. [on top of a file cabinet near the door is a roll of toilet paper. Josh smiles]
MR. MACKEY
Uh, that's nice, Officer Barbrady, but we actually don't need to know-
KYLE
[rushes in] Hold it! [Stan and Kenny rush in behind him] Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streibel. We have something we need to tell you.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
All right. Will you people stop barging into my office, please?
JOSH
What's the matter, Principal Victoria? Was your mother abusive? Did she spank your thighs with cold cuts and stick umbrellas up your ass?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[pointing] Get him out of here!
OFFICER BARBRADY
Uh, Policeman Brown, will you take Josh outside, please?
JOSH
[being rolled out] Ooh, Policeman Brown, never quite made officer. Why is that, Policeman Brown? [the roll of toilet paper is now gone...]
KYLE
We have to confess that we were the ones that-
MR. MACKEY
It's too late, boys, m'kay? We already know everything.
STAN
You, you do? How?
CARTMAN
[steps forward from the back of the room] Hi guys.
KYLE
Cartman??
CARTMAN
I told them everything, you guys. It's over.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Luckily for us, one of you had enough of a conscience to come forward.
CARTMAN
My consciences just caught up with me.
KYLE
That's not fair!
MR. MACKEY
You all get two weeks of detention, except Eric, who gets one week for being brave.
KYLE
But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience!
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, I guess my work here is done. After all this, I'm gonna need a long vacation. [turns and exits the room]
KYLE
This was supposed to be my story! My coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair!
[South Park Elementary, hallway outside the principal's office.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Okay, Josh, time to go back to the... [sees Policeman Brown covered in toilet paper and Josh's dolly empty] Oh no!
POLICEMAN BROWN
He... He was too fast for me. He ran out the door!
OFFICER BARBRADY
Couldn't you have gone after him?
POLICEMAN BROWN
Well, ah I'm covered in toilet paper. I'd look silly.
[South Park Elementary cafeteria, after school. Mr. Mackey addresses the detained. The boys are there, as well as two of the sixth graders, and Craig and Bebe.]
MR. MACKEY
Welcome to detention. You will be here till five o'clock, so make good study use of your time. M'kay?
STAN
Wugh! Two weeks of this!
KYLE
Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now.
CARTMAN
I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later.
KYLE
Oh Jesus! [buries his face in his hands, then raises it as Cartman talks]
CARTMAN
I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible.
KYLE
You just feel bad for yourself that you're in detention!
CARTMAN
Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you-
KYLE
Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing!
CARTMAN
Hm.
[South Park Police Department, afternoon. Barbrady stands at his desk. The phone rings and he answers it.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Police station.
JOSH
[over the earpiece] Hello Officer Barbrady.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Josh? Josh, where are you?!
[An undisclosed location, day.]
JOSH
I'm afraid that giving away my location might be harmful to my freedom, officer. I just wanted to thank you for helping me get out of that dingy cell.
[South Park Police Department.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Josh, you have to go back to Juvenile Hall. You only have a three-week sentence.
[Washington DC, day.]
JOSH
Sorry, officer, gotta run. There's something I've been meaning to do for quite some time. Ciao. [hangs up. Next to him are two boxes full of toilet paper. He picks them up and leaves the phone. The camera zooms out to reveal the location to be a park across the street from the White House. Josh heads for the White House, but stops at the curb to gaze at it.]
End of Toilet Paper


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Stan, Cartman, Kyle and Kenny find out that planet Earth is just one big intergalactic reality show and it's about to be cancelled.

script:Cancelled

[At the bus stop, day. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny wait. Ike hops into view]
THE BOYS
School days, school days, teacher's golden rule day...
KYLE
Ah, dammit!
CARTMAN
What?
KYLE
My Goddamn little brother's trying to follow me to school, again!
IKE
Suck my balls.
KYLE
No, Ike! You can't come to school with me.
CARTMAN
Yeah! Go home, you little dildo!
KYLE
Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo!
CARTMAN
Alright, go home, you little semen-puking asshole dickhead! [the boys laugh, Kyle picks up Ike and swings him towards Cartman. Ike smacks Cartman in the face and Cartman falls on his back] Ow!
STAN
Dude, sweet! [Ike stands up]
KYLE
Yeah. Check it out. [sets up Ike and prepares for a kick] Ready Ike? Kick the baby!
IKE
Don't kick the Goddamn baby!
KYLE
Kick the baby!
IKE
Waaaah-- [flies across the street and lands in some snow on the other side] Ow.
CARTMAN
[gets up and yawns]
KYLE
Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
CARTMAN
That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
KYLE
Really? What about?
CARTMAN
Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed… [the dream sequence begins] in the dark. When all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room [his window flies open and a bright beam blinds him as he rises to see what it is]. Then slowly my bedroom door began to open [a glow appears around the door as an alien peeks inside] and the next thing I remember I was being drugged through a hallway. [This hallway has specimens on either side of it. "Weeaak!"] Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me. [four aliens hover over him and lower his pajama pants as a robot arm nearby gets to work on his ass] And they had big heads and big black eyes…
STAN
Dude! Visitors!
KYLE
Totally!
CARTMAN
What?
STAN
That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
CARTMAN
No, it was just a dream, [crosses his arms] my mom said so.
STAN
Visitors are real. They... [lowers his left eyebrow and thinks, looking down] Wait a minute. This has all happened before.
KYLE
Yeah. This does seem really familiar.
CARTMAN
What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about?
KYLE
Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream?
CARTMAN
Eh... shut up you guys, you're just tryin' to scare me.
STAN
No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that?
CARTMAN
No I don't remember that!
KYLE
You don't?
CARTMAN
No, because the aliens erased my memory!
STAN
I remember this whole thing. [to Kyle] Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream.
KYLE
Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car. [the sound of wheels approaching]
CHEF
[pulling up in his station wagon, steps out] Hello there, children! [silence]
KYLE
[to Stan] And then you said...
STAN
What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?
CHEF
Well, today it's Salisbury steak with hot buttered noodles
ALL
and a choice of green bean salad or vegetable medley.
KYLE
Weird
CHEF
Say, did any of you children
ALL
see the alien space ship last night?
CHEF
What the?
STAN
Chef, we're in a repeat.
CHEF
A repeat??
KYLE
Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.
CARTMAN
Aw dude, I hate repeats!
CHEF
[walks around and stands behind the boys] I've been feelin' Déjà vu all mornin', children. I knew somethin' strange was goin' on!
STAN
It all started when Cartman got an anal probe.
CHEF
We have to get Eric to a proctologist right away.
[South Park Medical Clinic. Inside, Chef and the boys wait on chairs as Cartman lies face down on a proctologist's table.]
KYLE
What is a proc-tologist, Chef?
CHEF
He's a doctor that specializes in your asshole, children.
STAN
You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes.
CHEF
That's right.
KYLE
What a dick!
PROCTOLOGIST
[entering] Hello everyone! [walks towards Cartman]
CHEF
Hello Doctor. Thanks for seein' Eric on such short notice.
PROCTOLOGIST
What seems to be the problem?
CHEF
We just want you to take a look and tell us if you see anything abnormal.
KYLE
Other than his monstrous size.
CARTMAN
[whips an angry look at him] SHUT UP, KYLE! SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMNED MOUTH! [pulls his head back and rests it on his left hand]
PROCTOLOGIST
All right, let's see here. [raises the blanket and looks down] Oh my God!!
CARTMAN
What?
PROCTOLOGIST
Why, there's a huge crack goin' right down the middle! [beat. The doctor begins to laugh]
CARTMAN
[displeased] Haha, very funny.
STAN
Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times.
PROCTOLOGIST
[chuckles] All right, let's take a look. [snaps on a yellow latex glove and plunges a finger into the butthole]
CARTMAN
Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing?
CHEF
Eric, the doctor has to feel inside your rectum.
KYLE
And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it.
CARTMAN
Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Ooh. Oww...
PROCTOLOGIST
Well the prostate seems to be normal. No swelling of the hemorrhoidal gland...
CARTMAN
Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooh-ah. Uuuuu, aaaaah.
PROCTOLOGIST
Wait, what's this? [the anal probe appears once again and the doctor jumps out of the way. The probe stretches out and clears away part of the clinic on its way to full height. A large hole is left on the building as the satellite dish juts out from it.]
KYLE
Are you okay?
CARTMAN
[with a dreamy, relieved look] Dude. You know that feeling when you take a huuuge dump? Awesome. [smiles]
CHEF
Well, doctor?
PROCTOLOGIST
[slowly] I've never quite seen this before, uh... Perhaps he just needs some hemorrhoid cream.
CARTMAN
[the probe collapses and sinks back into his ass] Aaaaaa, aaaaaah! Ooagh!
STAN
You all right?
CARTMAN
You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I"M NOT ALL RIGHT!!
PROCTOLOGIST
I've never seen a hemorrhoid react this way.
CHEF
That wasn't no hemorrhoid, it was an alien hoobajoob! Come on, children! We've got to get Eric to some real help!
STAN
Where to now, Chef?
CHEF
That thing inside Eric's asshole looked like some kinda alien satellite dish. We need to see my friend down at the Space Center now! [as they leave the clinic they pass the receptionist's window. A receptionist with a weird white face and yellow hair looks on as they leave. She then removes her wig and shows that she's a Visitor.]
[The space center. Lots of satellite dishes dot the premises. Inside Chef leads the children to a scientist.]
CHEF
And you're the only person I could think of who might be able to help us, Jeff.
JEFF
How do we uh, make it come out?
CHEF
Someone just has to activate it like the proctologist did.
CARTMAN
[crosses his arms] Ohhh no, no no no no! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! Unless it's Kyle. [grins]
KYLE
What!? No way! [looks to his left and points] You do it, Kenny!
CARTMAN
Nope! It has to be Kyle!
STAN
Go on.
KYLE
I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt!
CHEF
Kyle, the fate of the world may be at stake.
CARTMAN
[lowers his pants and moons Kyle] Come, Kyle. Do hurry. [Kyle moves tentatively toward Cartman and bares his left arm] Go ahead, it won't bite. [Kyle raises his arm and move in. Cartman farts and Kyle angrily lowers his arm. Cartman and Kenny laugh]
KYLE
God-damnit Cartman!
CARTMAN
[laughing] I couldn't resist. I'm sorry. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kenny joins in. and Kyle angrily lowers his arm.]
KYLE
Stop it Cartman!
CARTMAN
[laughing] Okay. Okay okay. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kenny joins in. and Kyle angrily lowers his arm.]
KENNY
[laughing] (Gaaahaha, he got you again!)
KYLE
God Dammit!
CARTMAN
[laughing] Haha. Oh man, that was great. Okay, go ahead. I'm all out of farts now. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm, looking at the other guys.] Gahaaa! Derrr!
KENNY
[laughs, then echoes Cartman] (Derrr!)
CARTMAN
Okaay, okay. It's not funny anymore. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm.] Oh yes it is! [swats the odor towards Kyle.]
KENNY
[laughs, then echoes Cartman] (Yes it is!)
CHEF
Eric, that's enough!
CARTMAN
Okay, okay. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm.] Ohh, double psych!
KYLE
That's it! [walks off] I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it!
STAN
Oh, nice going, Cartman!
CARTMAN
All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kyle.
KYLE
No!
CARTMAN
No, go ahead. I'm dry.
KYLE
You're lying!
CHEF
It stopped being funny forty seconds ago, boy! Let's just get this over with!
CARTMAN
But it was one of the best times I've ever had.
JEFF
Can I see this thing, please?
CARTMAN
Okay. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm.] Ohhh! God-dammit! [Cartman, Kenny, and Chef laugh]
CHEF
Okay. Now it's funny again.
CARTMAN
This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven.
KYLE
That does it! CHARGE! [drives his finger into Cartman's butthole. Cartman farts and screams as the anal probe shoot out of his ass. The probe opens up into the satellite dish and the dish sends a beam into outer space. Part of the space center is destroyed in the process]
CHEF
What's it doing?
JEFF
It, it's sending a transmission of some kind. [sits at a console and types away] Got it! [on several screen above the keyboard, images from around the planet pop up and change every second or so.]
KYLE
It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.
CHEF
Where is the signal being sent to? [the signal cuts off and the anal probe shrinks back into Cartman's ass. Cartman screams as it does so.]
CARTMAN
Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys.
KYLE
We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth?
STAN
We wanted to see an alien planet or something.
JEFF
Whoever they are, if they're receiving messages, they might be sending them, too. Wait a minute. c-candy bars.
KYLE
Candy bars?
JEFF
You-you know. Candy bars. They usually come in a wrapper. Just like you... wrap a Christmas present. Christmas happens when it's cold. Cold, as in Alaska - that's... with polar bears. Polar bears... polar-- polarity! I can switch the polarity to see what transmissions are coming from the location this one is being sent to! [turns around and types away on the console. The power cuts out and the center goes dark.] What the heck? [the sound of heavy ships is heard, and two bright beams light up the room. Everyone looks towards a window. Outside, a visitor walks up and looks in through one end window. A second one looks through the other end window. The windows shatter] They're coming in! [a glow appears outside a door and permeates it. The door shuts and two visitors enter. The other two come in through the window and the four of them converge on the boys, Chef, and Jeff.]
STAN
What do we do???
CARTMAN
[steps forward and points to Jeff] It's that guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities!
JEFF
What?? [the visitors go after Jeff, and the others make their escape]
CHEF
Help!
KYLE
Aaaah! Runrunruuun! [the group makes it outside]
STAN
Let's go!
CHEF
Get in the car, children! Get in the car! [they all scramble in and Chef peels away from the center. He drives down the road towards South Park. Another car appears behind then and throws up its headlights. Its horn honks a few times]
STAN
[startled] What is that?
CHEF
Can you see anything, children? [Kyle looks back]
KYLE
[turns back] The aliens are chasing us! [a close-up of the four aliens in the car behind Chef. A passenger-side visitor leans out and draws a revolver, shooting at Chef. A bullet strikes the rear window and the boys jump]
CHEF
God damned aliens! [the two cars move down the road with the visitors still shooting]
STAN
Chef! End of the road! [several barricades are up, with STOP signs hanging on the, and one sign saying "ROAD CLOSED"]
CHEF
Hold on, children! [Cartman looks at the visitors] We have to ditch them! [steps on the gas pedal]
CARTMAN
What are you doing, man?! [Chef drives towards the barricade and goes up a wooden ramp, into the air.]
NARRATOR
[some backwoods music plays in the background in freeze-frame] Looks like the boys are gettin' a little fresh air. [the wagon lands on the other side of a pothole and continues. The visitors try the same jump, but they launch into the air and off the road, towards a chicken coop. They crash through the roof and land right in the middle of the coop. Chickens ]
KYLE
[looks out and back] I think we ditched them.
CHEF
I don't think we're outta the woods yet. [They pass a sign saying "eat BIG PIG'S BBQ" with a pig in a white Southern suit. Behind the billboard, a police car pulls out and pursues Chef. There are two visitors in the car]
VISITOR DRIVER
Coop coop.
STAN
It's the police!
CHEF
That ain't no police! [for some reason, two workers are moving a large glass pane across the road. Chef heads on down and crashes through it. The police cruiser follows]
CARTMAN
When do we get to eat. I'm hungry.
STAN
Chef!! [Chef sees yet another barricade and goes towards it, forcing the worker guarding it to jump out of the way/ Chef launches into the air once again. "Dixie" is heard from the car's horn. The aliens catch up to Chef and the boys and try the same jump. They end up upside down and unable to move. Chef spins the car a bit and looks back at the police cruiser]
CHEF
[jumps out and approaches the police car] HA! God-damned aliens! I beat you! [a beam lights up the car] Where'd you learn to drive, aliens?! Chinese auto school?! [the car begins to rise slowly]
THE BOYS
Chef! Chef! They've got us!
CHEF
You're lucky I didn't just turn around and beat your white skinny alien asses anyway! Maybe next time you'll remember to... [notices the weird sounds behind him and turns] Huh? [looks up to see the station wagon hovering near the entrance to the ship] Aw crap! Children!
THE BOYS
Cheeeeeeef!
NARRATOR
[the picture freezes] Well, it looks like the boys are in more trouble than a June bug in molasses. And it's pretty thick molasses, too.
[A chamber. Stan is tied up in some green alien pod, asleep.]
STAN
Uh. [stirs and opens his eyes] Wugh. You guys. Wake up! [the other boys are in pods of their own]
KYLE
[stirs in his own pod] What the? Where are, where are we?
STAN
We're in the alien ship.
CARTMAN
Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's ass! [panics] Oh God, help me, you guys!
KYLE
It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship.
CARTMAN
[looks down] ...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank you, Lord.
STAN
[out of his pod] Guys. Look. [the others get out of theirs and walk towards Stan]
KYLE, CARTMAN
Wow. [they face a massive window, through which they get a good view of Earth getting farther and farther away]
STAN
My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space.
KYLE
Yeah.
KENNY
(Awesome)
CARTMAN
This is like my fifth time. [the room brightens and two doors open at the other end of the room. The boys turn and face it]
STAN
Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy.
KENNY
(Oh no!) [tightens the hood on his face. The man enters... it appears to be Stan's father.]
ALIEN
Hello boys.
STAN
Dad?
ALIEN
No, not really. I just read your mind and thought this form might be more pleasing to you.
KYLE
Aw dude, don't do that. That's gay.
STAN
Yeah, that's like that stupid movie, Contact.
CARTMAN
Aw God, that movie pissed me off.
ALIEN
Very well, I shall show my true form. [a quick transformation into a hideous monster] Rah rah rah rah-rah. Rah rah rah rah.
THE BOYS
[shielding their eyes] AAAAH!
STAN
Okay okay, take the form of something else!
ALIEN
[transforms again] How's this? [the boys move their arms off their eyes to behold Santa]
CARTMAN
Santa!
STAN
Nno, that's stupid too. [Cartman looks at Stan, deflated]
ALIEN
How about this? [transforms into Michael Jordan, Bulls form]
STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
No. [the alien turns into Don King] No! [then into Mr. Roarke and Tattoo]
CARTMAN
[impressed] Oooo, very nice.
STAN
No! [the alien turns into George Burns]
KYLE
No! [the alien turns into J.J. Walker]
ALIEN
Dy-no-mite!
THE BOYS
No!
[Back at the space center, day. Jeff is cleaning up after the destruction left behind by the visitors]
CHEF
[with flashlight] Jeff!! The aliens took the children upon their ship.
JEFF
Oh no!
CHEF
Did you find out what the aliens were up to?
JEFF
When I reversed the polarities, I found this: [sits at the console and starts pressing keys. 1s and 0s flash across a screen] It's a message that the aliens are broadcasting throughout the entire universe. But I have no idea what it says.
CHEF
They took the children, Jeff! I have to know what those aliens are up to!
JEFF
[spins around] Wait a minute! Butt sex!
CHEF
Butt sex?
JEFF
Butt sex requires a lot of lubrication, right? Lubrication. Lubruh... Chupuh-- Chupacabra's the, the goat killer of Mexican folklore. Folklore is stories from the past that are often fictionalized. Fictionalized to heighten drama. Drama students! Students at colleges usually have bicycles! Bi, bian, binary. It's binary code! [spins back and works on decoding it]
CHEF
Who's havin' butt sex?
[Back on the alien ship]
ALIEN
[prances as Saddam] Hello my honey, hello my baby, hello my ragtime gal! [ends on his knees, arms wide open]
THE BOYS
[getting bored] No!
ALIEN
[transforms into Missy Elliot] Lemme search ya, gonna work ya, hepsunudupunubuh huh.
THE BOYS
No! [Stan is irritated]
ALIEN
[transforms into Frank Sinatra] Don't piss on the moon, babe.
THE BOYS
NO!
ALIEN
All right, earthlings, what form do you want me to take? [the boys fall silent]
CARTMAN
How about a taco, that craps ice cream? [the alien transforms into the taco. A wad of ice cream falls out of him] Guys?
STAN
I like it.
KENNY
(Me too.) [the boys clap]
ALIEN
All right, then we can get back to business. Follow me this way, earthlings. [leads the boys into another room, leaving scoops of ice cream behind, in various flavors] I want to apologize to you boys for all the spooky, scary stuff. We just needed to get to the malfunctioning uplink relay.
STAN
You mean, the thing in Cartman's ass?
ALIEN
That's right. See, there are dishes in over fifty thousand earthlings' rectums. Your friend's has been malfunctioning.
KYLE
Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover?
ALIEN
Oh, heavens no! We're a production company. We make intergalactic television programs that the whole universe watches. [enters the next room]
STAN
[looks back at his friends] Television? [the boys enter the next room. In that room visitors are all over the place manning the various aspects of a production company]
ALIEN
We at Nerzod Productions started twenty billion years ago with one philosophy: the best universal television isn't scripted, it's real. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] We started with great shows like, "Who Wants To Marry A Gelgamek?" and "Antares 6 Millionaire". And then we had a big hit with "Get Me Outta Here, I'm a Klingnanian". But then, of course, there's our signature show. The greatest universal reality show of all time. [he looks at a giant screen on which Earth is shown]
KYLE
Earth?
ALIEN
A few billion years ago we realized, "what if we took species from all different planets in the universe, and put them together, on the same planet?" Great TV, right? Asians, bears, ducks, Jews, deer, and Hispanics, all trying to live side by side on one planet! It's great! [the boys are stunned at what they're hearing]
STAN
Our planet is just a reality-TV show?
ALIEN
Well, you don't think the whole universe works the way Earth does, do you? No! One species, one planet! There's a planet of deer, a planet of Asians, and so on! We put them all together on Earth and the whole universe tunes in to watch the fun!
KYLE
You mean that you aliens actually enjoy sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up.
ALIEN
Why?
STAN
Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment!
CARTMAN
Yeah! We'd never do that on Earth! [the boys just look at each other]
[The Convention Center, day.]
JEFF
Ladies and Gentlemen, we have recently come across an alien transmission that is being beamed throughout the entire universe. [murmurs rise up in the audience] When decoded, it looks like this. [he begins the transmission and graphics sweep by. First, the binary code appears, then a dazzling sun behind the Earth, then a tracking shot leading to Earth, then an undernourished boy, then a caravan walking across a desert, people putting on protective glasses, an atomic blast, deer running, a couple, a time-lapse night scene, the Eiffel Tower, two men hammering at something, an ethnic festival. The sound is garbled]
MAN
[rising] What does it mean?
JEFF
It's a simple mathematical language that can be understood throughout the solar system. Translated into our language, it looks like this. [replays the transmission, this time in English]
ANNOUNCER
This jannemon at eight o'clock, it's everyone's favorite show! Earth! It's been one hundred Gelganighs since we first took species from seventeen different planets and put them all together, on the same planet! Oo-derp! They've fought and fallen in love! What will happen this Galgamog? Tune in jannemon at eight to find out. It's... Earth! On Fognl!
JEFF
I'm afraid that Earth, a-all of Earth, is nothing but an intergalactic reality-TV show.
MAN 2
My God. We're famous! [everyone stands and whoops it up]
JEFF
Waaaait, you don't understand!
MAN 3
[giddy blond] I'm on TV! I'm on TV!
MAN 4
This is so awesome! [everyone clear out, cheering]
OTHERS
Woo! Yeah! Woohoo!! [Jeff is left all alone]
[Back at Nerzod Productions. Cartman is bent over once more, with his pants down. The visitors have finished working on him]
ALIEN
That should get the relay working again. [begins to walk off. The boys follow] All right, Earthlings, if you'll step over this way we'll erase your memories and get you back to Earth. [a visitor brings him a ringing phone] Oh, excuse me. [picks up the receiver] This is Nagix. Uh-huh. Oh no. Oh no, really? And it's, it's for sure? All right, I'll break the news to everyone. No, no I, I understand. Thanks. [hangs up the phone and walks back to the boys] Well, you kids can go back to Earth if you want, but I'm afraid it won't be there for long. The show's been canceled.
KYLE
What?? Who canceled us?
NAJIX
The universal network heads. They say the Earthlings have become aware of the show, so it won't be funny anymore. [walks off to address the rest of the staff]
STAN
Oh shit, did we do that?
NAJIX
Everyone, can I have your attention real quick? Uuh, look, I just got a call from the network and I'm afraid Earth has been canceled
STAFF
Awww.
NAJIX
Now, now, it was a great run and I think we should all be really proud. [a smattering of applause] Let's call in a demolition crew to strike the Earth for resources.
STAN
Wait! Wait, they can't do this! Uh, let us talk to the network heads!
NAJIX
Wouldn't do any good.
KYLE
Dude, we have to try!
STAN
Please, take us to them! Please!
NAJIX
All right, kids, we'll take you to the network heads. But I warn you: nobody has ever gotten the executives to uncancel a show once the call has been made. Nobody. [the boys look at each other, and several more scoops of ice cream falls out of the alien's taco ass]
[Earth. A view of it from outer space. A few seconds later, an immense crane floats towards Earth with a wrecking ball ready and beeper going. It stops. Two alien laborers sit inside and the driver activates the crane arm. The wrecking ball moves and strikes western Africa. A shot of people running across a bridge. The whole planet moves as if by an earthquake. Chef almost loses his balance at the space center as the ground undulates.]
CHEF
What the hell is that?!
JEFF
There's a huge ship of some kind in Earth's orbit! [schematics of the ship and Earth appear on screen, and the impact point is shown as well] But why? Wait a minute! Chaos theory!
CHEF
Chaos theory??
JEFF
Chaos theory, it was, it was first thought of in the sixties. Sixty. That's the number of episodes they made of Punky Brewster before it was canceled. Cancelled...
CHEF
Huh?
JEFF
Don't you see? The show is over! The aliens are canceling Earth!
CHEF
Oh my God! We have to stop them!
[The boys walk down a futuristic sidewalk on a strange planet.]
VOICE
Welcome to Planet Fognl, home of the Joozians, who control all media in the universe. [the boys enter the universal network headquarters]
RECEPTIONIST
Can I help you?
STAN
Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads?
RECEPTIONIST
Where are you visiting from?
STAN
Uh, Earth?
RECEPTIONIST
Ooooh, I watch that show all the time. [opens another set of doors and shows the boys in]
JOOZIAN 1
Gaaahahaha! [notices the boys come in] Oh, sure, come on in, Earthlings. We're just checking out our new show.
JOOZIAN 2
We took a hundred beings from the planet Marklar and put them on an asteroid with sentient beings from the Horsehead Nebula. It-it's a riot!
JOOZIAN 1
They hate each other!
JOOZIAN 2
Gah, why? [Stan nudges Kyle, who pulls a letter out from his pocket and reads]
KYLE
Mighty, powerful network executives, we have come in a great distance in order to have--
JOOZIAN 1
Oooo, I'm starving! You Earthlings have haglar yet?
JOOZIAN 2
Oh yeah, let's do haglar.
JOOZIAN 1
Where do you wanna go? Meroni's?
JOOZIAN 2
Not on a Flakmar, too crowded. Ohhh, Blackafelch!
JOOZIAN 1
Oh, Blackafelch. Perfect.
[Blackafelch Restaurant, later. Aliens of all kinds sit and enjoy their meals.]
JOOZIAN 2
This place is fantastic!
STAN
Look, we just want to talk to you about the show.
KYLE
[Begging, with his hands together] Please don't cancel us. Please.
JOOZIAN 1
[Both Joozians are holding menus] Oh I'm sorry, Earthlings, but you have to realize the universe is a business.
JOOZIAN 2
You've made it to a hundred episodes, you should be proud!
JOOZIAN 1
Yeah, a show should never go past a hundred episodes, or else it starts to get stale with ridiculously stupid plotlines and settings.
WAITRESS
[another Joozian] Here's your order of gespahtgaplachfenachenblah. [sets a large platter before the executives and lifts the cover. The executives dig in]
STAN
But, sirs, we think our show is just getting good. [Kyle thinks about the food, then decides to pick up a fork-full and taste it] I mean, we're just now starting to see people get really pissed off at each other.
KYLE
Oh my God, this is great!
JOOZIAN 1
You must have some Joozian ancestry.
CARTMAN
[miffed at the link, rests his head on his left hand] Tell us about it.
STAN
Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us.
JOOZIAN 1
Oh my God, would you look at the heglars on that joozinek?
STAN
Dude, we're trying to save our planet here!
JOOZIAN 1
Let's take the Earthlings to a hekmubah!
JOOZIAN 2
Oh, yeah!
[A hekmabah, a Joozian strip club. A Joozinek slithers around a dance pole]
JOOZIAN 1
Oh yeah, let's see those heglars!
STAN
Sirs, uh, if you'll just let-
JOOZIAN 1
Oh, man, I am so wasted! [holds up a little box] Hey, do you Earthlings wanna try a little glach? [takes the box and pours out a line of purple powder. The other Joozian snorts it right up. The boys look on, saying nothing. Another line of purple powder and the first Joozian snorts up, then suddenly turns around] Agh-oh yeah!! [turns back] Oh, gluck yeah!! [Kenny begins snorting up at the other end of the line]
KYLE
Kenny! [Kenny stops]
JOOZIAN 1
Man, screw this place! Let's go get a hotel room and a hooker!
JOOZIAN 2
Oh yeah!
JOOZIAN 1
Yeah! [they leave their chairs]
[Back on earth, the massive cranes swings at Earth again. More quakes follow and the space center is damaged some more]
CHEF
We have to find a way to stop those aliens!
JEFF
[begins pacing] Oh, their ship is massive! There's no way to stop it! [stops] Wait a minute, jackets!
CHEF
[smacks his hand onto his head] Oh no.
JEFF
If people don't wear jackets they could get cold. A cold is caused by a virus. A virus- a computer virus! We could make a computer virus and send it to their ships to disable their computers!
CHEF
[thinks, then angrily] That doesn't make any Goddamn sense!
[An adult hotel. The Joozians are in bed with a hooker and they begin to disrobe.]
JOOZIAN 1
Oh yeah!
JOOZIAN 2
Good.
JOOZIAN 1
Oh yeah! Yeah!!
JOOZIAN 2
Woohoohoo! Yeah!
JOOZIAN 1
[goes to take another snort of purple powder. With his shirt off, one can see two small appendages, one on each shoulder] Booyagh! Boy, Earthlings, is this a party or what?? [the boys sit on a couch looking on, bored.]
JOOZIAN 2
Oh! Oh, that's it, baby! You're getting my jagon hard! [the appendage on his right shoulder stiffens and lengthens]
JOOZIAN 1
[returns to the side of the bed, by the second Joozian] Wohh. Yeah, let's party! [begins to suck on the Joozian's jagon]
JOOZIAN 2
Yeah, suck my jagon!
JOOZIAN 1
[stops and releases] Yeah! Now you suck on my jagon! [the second Joozian begins to suck on his jagon] Oh yeah!! Stick your finger in my thrusher! [the second Joozian begins putting his finger into some openings above the first Joozian's waist] Oh yeah, suck it! Suck that jagon! [the boys show more interest and some astonishment]
STAN
Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong. [Kenny whips out a camera and takes a picture]
JOOZIAN 1
[the other Joozian continues sucking on his jagon] Oh yeah!! Oh yeah, yeah-yeah! Oh yeah!
[Back at universal network headquarters. The Joozians have ice packs on their heads, recovering from the raunch they experienced the night before]
JOOZIAN 2
Oh, God. Eh, my head. [the four boys look on] What did we do?
JOOZIAN 1
Oh man, I can't believe I sucked your jagon.
JOOZIAN 2
Oh God, we did suck each other's jagons! You kids won't tell anybody about this, right??
CARTMAN
No.
STAN
[glances at Cartman and quickly thinks] No, wait. We won't tell anybody if you don't cancel our show!
JOOZIAN 1
Oooo, I knew that was coming.
JOOZIAN 2
They really got us by the nezmins.
KYLE
The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show.
STAN
I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent.
CARTMAN
There's even World War Three to look forward to.
KYLE
And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons.
JOOZIAN 1
He-all right, all right Earthlings! Ya, you win! The show can stay on.
THE BOYS
All right!
JOOZIAN 1
Just be sure to keep up the wars and violence.
JOOZIAN 2
Well, we've got a five o'clock with the Yurka producers. [still disheveled, he hops off his chair and goes to a lever] Nice meeting you Earthlings. Bye! [pulls the lever down and in an instant, the boys are back at the bus stop]
[The bus stop, day. Kenny is missing.]
CARTMAN
[yawns] Uuugh.
KYLE
Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
CARTMAN
That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
KENNY
[walks up with something in his hand] (Hey you guys, look.) [the other boys look]
KYLE
What the hell is that?
KENNY
(I don't know.)
CHEF
[drives up in his station wagon and steps out] Hello there, children!
THE BOYS
Hey Chef. [Chef steps behind the boys]
STAN
Chef, Kenny has a picture of two green things sucking each other's shoulders. [Chef takes a look at the picture of the two Joozians sucking each other's jagons]
CARTMAN
What is it, Chef?
CHEF
I don't know. But something tells me this picture might be very important, children. [hands the picture back to Kenny] You should hang on to it.
[TV spot]
ANNOUNCER
Attention universe! Be sure to tune in next week for another exciting episode of... Earth! The Asians [crowd scene] are reeeally steamed at the Russians [crossing a bridge]. The zebras try to get along with the buffalo. [composite shot] And Americans [walking the dog] and Iraqis [dancing] have an all-out brawl. [Saddam is shown] It's outrageous fun and it's all-new! Earth! On Fognl.
End of Cancelled

synopsis:One of Cartman's body parts becomes famous overnight and rivals the popularity of another superstar.

script:Fat Butt and Pancake Head

[South Park Elementary, day. Kyle is speaking to the school in the school gym, which is nicely decorated in the flags of many nations, both on the rafters and on the small stage set up at one end of the basketball court.]
KYLE
[wearing an argyle sweater] ...And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you. [cheers from the school crowd before him]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[approaches the mic] Okay, thank you, Kyle Broflovski.
MR. MACKEY
[as Kyle approaches him] That was very good, Kyle. I think the Latino Endowment Council was very happy with your presentation. Looks like you might win. [a shot of the council, which is comprised of five Latinos. ]
KYLE
Cool.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
All right, students, members of the school board. Our last speaker will discuss the important role of Latinos in the arts. Here is... Eric Cartman. [reads again in disbelief] Eric Cartman? [a smattering of applause from the kids in the crowd]
CARTMAN
[approaches the mic with his left hand behind his back] Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez.
KIDS
Jennifer Lopez?
KYLE
No way.
CARTMAN
[shows off his left hand, which is open] Miss Lopez, come on out here. [the hand closes to become a fist, and that fist has a face and hair painted on it]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
[Cartman begins to speak in a Spanish cartoon accent and his lips form a tiny smile as his hand begins to move] Hallooo. [the hand sports a small wig and a paper cutout of a woman's body hanging down from it. The cutout wears a white top and shorts and a heavy brown coat. The cutout's right hand sports some yellow bracelets]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[taken aback] Oh, Jesus Christ.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
My name is Hennifer Lopez. I eat tacos, y burritos.
CARTMAN
Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts?
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh si, si. But first I would like to put on my pretty dress.
CARTMAN
Oh, you mean this one? [whips out a doll's dress for the occasion]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh si si si. I like it very much.
CARTMAN
[fits the dress under his hand] There we go, Saright?
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Saright.
CARTMAN
That's a very pretty dress. [the Latino Endowment Council is shown again]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
It better be! I am Hennifer Lopez!
CARTMAN
Nonono, you're Jennifer Lopez.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
si si. [enunciating] Hennifer Lopez!
CARTMAN
Nono, Jeh-
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Heh-

CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Heh-
CARTMAN
Jeh-
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Jeh-
CARTMAN
Jennifer Lopez.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Hennifer Lopez. [members of the council laugh and clap]
A COUNCIL MEMBER
Hahahahaha, oh my.
CARTMAN
Ms. Lopez, could you show everyone your example of Latino arts?
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Don't be fooled by all my money. I still like to eat tacos, honey. So crispy on the outside, so super good and yummy.
CARTMAN
And that is my presentation on Latinos in the arts. Thank you. [Much more cheer and applause for him. The school gives him a standing ovation. The members of the Latino Endowment council jump up and down with joy and pride. Stan and Kenny clap with everyone else, Kyle is just stunned.]
[South Park Mall, later. The boys walk down one side inside the mall. Cartman leads the way.]
CARTMAN
Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass!
KYLE
It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture.
CARTMAN
Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle.
KYLE
No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!
CARTMAN
[walks up to Kyle] Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Aww, that makes me muy triste.
CARTMAN
Ms. Lopez, do you like Kyle?
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh si si, very much.
CARTMAN
Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss?
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh si, si si, my kisses taste like tacos. [Cartman plants his fist on Kyle's lips and makes kissing noises, then removes the hand]
CARTMAN
Is nice?
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Is very nice. He's so handsome. [Cartman puts the hand back on Kyle's mouth and resumes the kissing noises]
KYLE
[swats Cartman's hand away]Stop it!
CARTMAN
Hey, come one guys! We can use part of my gift certificate to buy food at the food court.
KENNY
(Woohoo!) [the boys go to the food court]
[South Park Mall, later. The boys walk down the mall. Cartman's hand is finishing off a taco as he looks at it.]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Mmm, tacos! So yummy!
KYLE
Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too.
KYLE
She's not eating it, it's just coming out her backside!
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
When you eat a taco it comes out your backside too, cholo!
KENNY
(Heheehee, heheh yeahah)
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Look look! Make your own music video! [they stop in front of a "U R Da Star", a music-video shop]
KYLE
Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!
CARTMAN
I agree. Those places are stupid.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
It's not stupid. I need to make music video.
STAN
[to Cartman's hand] Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand? [slaps Cartman's hand down] Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!
CARTMAN
Hey, I'm on your guys' side.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
[rises] Just wait one minute, let me see how much it is. [leads Cartman in. Stan and Kenny follow]
KYLE
God dammit! [follows reluctantly]
MICHAEL
Welcome to Make Your Own Video. All set to rock and roll?
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
How much to make a video?
MICHAEL
Uh, well, it's nine ninety five for a three-minute tape.
CARTMAN
Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five!
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh please! Come on, guys!
KYLE
Cartman, will you stop this gayness?!
CARTMAN
All right all right, here's ten dollars! [takes out the bill and hands it to the cashier]
KYLE
That's not what I meant!
MICHAEL
All right, just come over here and stand in front of the green screen. [Cartman walks over to the screen] What kind of song do you want?
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Something hot and spicy.
[The cashier puts on various music tracks, first song is a rock song.]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Spicier.
[Next is Latin song]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Spicierrr!
[Next song is a Latin mix. This is agreeable, so the video is made.]
["Jennifer Lopez: Taco-Flavored Kisses" is shown, The hand has its costume on hanging down from it.]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Burrito. Taco taco. Burrito. Taco. Taco taco.
Don't think that just because I got a lot of money
I'll give you taco-flavored kisses, honey!
Fulfill all your wishes with my taco-flavored kisses.
Taco taco. Burrito Burri...to. Taco taco.
MICHAEL
You know, I've seen a lot of videos here at the mall, and that was by far the best!
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh, gracias, "Machel"! [the cashier's tag reads "Michael"]
MICHAEL
Hey, I've got a friend who's interning at a big record label in L.A. I'll send a copy on to him and maybe he'll get the bigwigs to see it.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh, gracias, Machel, gracias!
KYLE
Can we go now, please?!
CARTMAN
Yeah, I wanna leave.
KYLE
Stop it, Cartman!
CARTMAN
What?
[BHI records, L.A. day. The tape is being played on a massive screen in an office.]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Fulfill all your wishes with my taco-flavored kisses.
Taco taco.
BHI PRESIDENT
She's fantastic. Who is she? [two men sit on a sofa, one sits on an armchair]
AIDE 1
[with brown hair] Believe it or not, her name is Jennifer Lopez.
AIDE 2
[in armchair] That makes sense. She reminds me of J-Lo.
BHI PRESIDENT
Yeah, but she's younger and spicier.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Taco taco. Burrito Burri...to. Taco taco.
AIDE 2
I don't think J-Lo would like it very much if we signed this new girl.
BHI PRESIDENT
No, you're right. We're gonna have to fire J-Lo.
[Cartman's house, day. The phone rings in the kitchen and he answers it.]
CARTMAN
Hello? ...BHI records? ...Oh, it's for you, Ms. Lopez. [hands the phone to "her"]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh, si si siiih. Allo!
CARTMAN
What do they want?
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
[looks at Cartman] Just a second, I'm trying to hear.
CARTMAN
S'awright?
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
S'awright. [returns to "her" call] Yes yes, this is Ms. Hrrrlopez. Uh huh. [gasps and screams "her" head off]
CARTMAN
What? What?
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh my God I can't believe it!!!
CARTMAN
[puts the phone to his ear] Hello, are you still there?
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
They want to sign me to the record company!
CARTMAN
You want to sign Ms. Lopez?
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh my God, it's happening for me!
CARTMAN
Yes! Yes, we can record an album next week! Sure we can write ten songs! We'll start tonight!! [hangs up and grins] We're gonna be rich!
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
We're gonna be famose!
CARTMAN
Come on, we gotta get to work on some songs! [runs off]
[Cartman's house, night. Cartman is on his bed writing away on a notepad.]
CARTMAN
There. That's three more songs we've written already! Your style of music is so easy it doesn't require any thought at all!
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh, si si siiih.
CARTMAN
[scoots back to his bedside lamp and turns it off, then settles under the covers] Okay, Ms. Lopez, time to go to sleep. [rubs off her open eyes and paints some closed lids on his hand.]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Ohh, I'm so sleeeepyyy.
CARTMAN
Good night, Ms. Lopez. Tomorrow is gonna be a great day. Great day tomorrow... [begins to dream of taunting Kyle] Tomorrow...
[His dream begins at the bus stop]
CARTMAN
"Kyle, you were wrong! We did do a record deal!" [in class, sitting next to each other] "You were wrong, Kyle!" [in the cafeteria, as Kyle walks by with his lunch] "Nananananaaana!" [on the bus ride home] "Hahahahahaaaha!" [images of Kyle come forth, crying] "Nananananaaana!" "Hahahahahaaaha!" [in his sleep] Awesommme. Yeeessss.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
[has dreams of its own] Aaahhhh. Aaahhhh.
[An Oscar ceremony. Two Oscars stand guard over a red carpet. On either side of the carpet is a crowd of people. A limo pulls up and a hand floats out of it.]
MAN 1
Ms. Lopez! Up here!
MAN 2
Jennifer, We love you Jennifer!
MAN 3
Jennifer, over here.
MAN 4
Jennifer!
[A concert. Her first single is thumping away, and she appears as just a hand, floating over the stage floor.]
FEMALE FAN

CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
[back to Cartman's room] Aaahhhh.
[BHI Records, Los Angeles, day. The president and his men are in a meeting when he looks up.]
BHI PRESIDENT
Ah, Ms. Lopez, come on in.
JENNIFER LOPEZ
[carrying a toy poodle takes a seat and removes her glasses] Yo, make it quick. I got a video shoot at two and a script reading at five.
BHI PRESIDENT
Yes, well uh, Ms. Lopez, we regret to inform you that, uh... we're dropping you from the label.
JENNIFER LOPEZ
What? Oh no you di'n't!
AIDE 1
We wanna thank you for all your hard work and ..."talent".
JENNIFER LOPEZ
[pounds her table] You can't drop me! I'm Jennifer Lopez! How can you drop me?!
BHI PRESIDENT
Wu-well a very talented younger singer has come to our attention and, and the truth of the matter is her name happens to be Jennifer Lopez as well. And we really can't have two here at BHI Records.
JENNIFER LOPEZ
Who the hell is this other Jennifer Lopez?! Where is she come from?!
AIDE 1
Well, she lives in South Park, Colorado now, but uh I believe she originally from Mexico, just like you.
JENNIFER LOPEZ
I don't come from no Mexico! I'm Puer'ah Rican!
BHI PRESIDENT
Whatever. Look, it's nothing personal, we just think you need to move on.
AIDE 2
Bu- AND you're a mean-spirited bitch who spits on people who aren't rich and famous.
[A limousine, from the back seat. A small TV is on near the floor, behind the driver.]
REPORTER
And sources say that the new film will star Ben Affleck.
BEN
[sitting at the other end of the passenger cabin] Huhuhuh, that's me. [a door opens opposite him and J-Lo enters] How'd it go, baby?
JENNIFER LOPEZ
Terrible, Ben! Some girl in Colorado is trying to become the new Jennifer Lopez! [her dog begins to bark] Shut up! [a few more barks and she tosses it out the window.]
BEN
What?? Who could replace you??
JENNIFER LOPEZ
[tries to get the driver's attention] Yo driver. Stupid driver!
DRIVER
[looks back] Yes, ma'am. Where to?
JENNIFER LOPEZ
Take me to South Park, Colorado! I'm gonna kill that bitch!!
[South Park Elementary, day. The kids file in to class. Many of them are already seated. Butters is looking out the window.]
CARTMAN
[runs up] Hey everybody! Listen up! I've got something to tell Kyle! [Slience.]
KYLE
[decide to answer] ...What?
CARTMAN
[approaches him] Hahahahahaaaha! Hahahahahaaaha! Hahaha, Hahaha, Hahahahahahaha!
STAN
What are you gloating about?
CARTMAN
Oh, I'm not gloating. I just got a little call from a record company in Los Angeles and, they want Ms. Lopez to record an album next week.
KIDS IN CLASS
Wow, really?
KYLE
No!
CARTMAN
[a slight gloat arises] Yup, looks like I'm gonna be rich. [nods to his hand] And famous.
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, let's take our seats. If you'll remember yesterday we were discussing state capitals.
BUTTERS
[pipes up and turns to the class] Hey, a big limousine just pulled up in front of the school!
MR. GARRISON
Butters, will you pay attention, please?
BUTTERS
Holy smokes, it's Jennifer Lopez!
CARTMAN
Jennifer Lopez?
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Yes?
BUTTERS
Holy geez wow! There's Ben Affleck, too!
A BOY
Wow, cool! [the kids leave their seats and head for the window]
MR. GARRISON
Will you kids shut up? [puts his book away and walks to the window] Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are not-! Oh my God, that's Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck. [the limo has pulled up. Jennifer and Ben climb out of the limo and the driver directs them to the office.]
MR. SLAVE
Oh Jesus, will you look at those boots?
MR. GARRISON
Well what are we waiting for? Let's get outside! [rushes out and the cheering class and Mr. Slave follow]
[South Park Elementary, outside, later. Word gets around and all of the school comes out to see for itself.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Is it true? Jennifer Lopez is here?
MR. MACKEY
Here she comes! Here she comes!
JENNIFER LOPEZ
Okay! What smart-mouthed little punk-ass bitch has been saying they're the new Jennifer Lopez, huh?!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[Mr. Adler takes a picture] J-Lo, can we get a picture of you with the kids?
JENNIFER LOPEZ
[begins pacing] No! Shut up! If I find the ho who thinks she's taken my career from me, I'm gonna wring her pretty little neck! [reaches the other end of the crowd] So, nobody want's to fess up, huh? Too scared to talk?! You'd better remember, bitch, that I'll come and take you down if you ever say anythin' again! [walks away]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
[a few seconds later...] You can suck my culo, chica! [Cartman looks up, stunned, as Jennifer Lopez returns to the crowd]
JENNIFER LOPEZ
[looks around] Who was that?! [all the kids back away from Cartman while pointing at him] You go' a problem?!
CARTMAN
Not me!
JENNIFER LOPEZ
Then who? [Cartman brings out his hand and points to it with the other]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Hola, bitchola! [Cartman is looking ever more fearful]
JENNIFER LOPEZ
What the hell is that?!
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
My name is Hennifer Hlopez! And I like tacos, and burritos.
JENNIFER LOPEZ
That? That's what replaced me?!
CARTMAN
I'm sure it was just a mistake.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Only mistake was when this ghetto trash got signed in the first place!
CARTMAN
Shut your God-damned mouth!
JENNIFER LOPEZ
[picks Cartman up by the scruff of his jacket] You fucking smartass, who do you think you are?!
CARTMAN
Nobody!
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
I am Yennifer Hrlopez! I eat tacos, and burritos!
JENNIFER LOPEZ
Fuck you! [begins to assault Cartman's hand]
CARTMAN
Yaaaaah! Wait! I'm sorry! Ah I'll stop! I'll stop!
JENNIFER LOPEZ
You'd better stop!
CARTMAN
I will!
BEN
[walks up to join Jennifer] Come on, Jenny, let's go.
BEBE
Wow, Ben Affleck.
BEN
We should be getting back to the... [something grabs his attention. Cartman looks away. Ben begins to fall for this new Jennifer Lopez]
JENNIFER LOPEZ
Don' you forget what'll happen to you, ho! Come on, Benny!
[She drags him off, but he glances back at the new Jennifer Lopez. He follows the original Lopez into the limousine, looking back one more time. As the limo leaves, Ben looks back one more time with his hands up against the glass as if blowing a kiss. The crowd then disperses.]
KYLE
Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson.
CARTMAN
Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now.
KYLE
Good.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
[rises once more] Or maybe I shou-ould.
KYLE
Aw, God-dammit!
CARTMAN
Ohnonono, Ms. Lopez.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Ohsisisi, senor.
KYLE
That does it. I'm out. [walks off]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh, where are you going, Kyle? Come give me kisses!
[Music Lab Recording Studios, night.]
AIDE 1
All right, Ms. Lopez, take it from the top. [music begins. Cartman is on a stool with his puppet at his side.]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Baby let's make a run for the border,
I've got a hunger only tacos can stop.
I know exactly what I'll order
Three tacos two tostadas and a soda pop.
BHI PRESIDENT
Gentlemen, we have ourselves a hit.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
I need to make a run for the border,
If you pay I'll take off my top.
Do you remember what I want to order?
Three tacos two tostadas and a soda pop.
Yeah-eah, and don't forget the hot sauce, Cholo!
[Cartman's house, night. He's asleep, dreaming.]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Don't think just because I got money
I won't still give you taco-flavored kisses, honey.
I'm gonna fulfill all your sexy wishes
Give you lots of taco-flavored kisses-
CARTMAN
What the hell are you doing?
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
I'm practicing my dancinngg!
CARTMAN

CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Dancing!
CARTMAN

CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Dancing!
CARTMAN

CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
[slowly, invitingly] Dancing!
CARTMAN
Moooommm! [Cartman's mother enters the room]
LIANE
What's the matter, sweetie?
CARTMAN
Ms. Lopez won't go to sleep!
[Cartman's house, day. Ben Affleck approaches the front door with a bouquet of flowers and knocks on the door.]
CARTMAN
[real tired] He-yesss.
BEN
Hey, I was wondering if I could talk to Ms. Lopez.
CARTMAN
[hides his left hand] She's not here right now.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
[muffled] Ben? Is that my darling Ben?
BEN
Jenny? Yes, Jenny, eheh, it's me! Where are you? Please, I-I have to see her! [Cartman sighs deeply, then shows his hand to Ben]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Ben!!! Oh, you brought me roses!
BEN
Jenny, ah Jenny I just can't stop thinking about you. [lowers the bouquet to Cartman, who takes it away angrily]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
I can't stop thinking about you either, Ben!
BEN
I've been meaning to write a song or a poem, but I have no talent.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
I know, my darleeeng. That's okay.
BEN
Will you just take a ride with me in my awesome car?
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh Ben, I would LOVE to!
CARTMAN
NO!
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
'Scuse me one second, Ben. [whips towards Cartman] Don't you ruin this opportunity for me! How can you stand in the way of this?!
CARTMAN
I'm not going out in his car.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
I'm not gonna let you blow this one chance I have.
CARTMAN
I don't care. I'm supposed to sit here and do my homework. [Ben stars picking his nose]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Don't you dare [becomes unintelligible]
CARTMAN
I don't care, 'cause I'm the one that's gonna get in trouble if you don't-! Okay, okay, wait, okay um, fine fine fine!
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Okay, Ben, let's go!
[A mountain road. Ben and Cartman drive along at a fast clip.]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh Ben, I am soo happy! The cool breeze blowing through my hair in your sexy automobile.
BEN
Let's spend the whole day together!
[A soft song plays. The next scene is a dawn on a beach, where "Jennifer Lopez" and Ben run side by side. Cartman looks tired. Next is a restaurant where Ben has some wine while "Jennifer Lopez" enjoys a martini. Next scene, they're watching a movie together. "Jennifer Lopez" has her own seat between Ben and Cartman. Bem stretches and puts his hand on the headrest behind "Jennifer Lopez". Cartman looks, then looks away angrily. Next scene is at a jewelry store, where Ben picks out some earrings for "Jennifer Lopez". "Jennifer Lopez" opens her mouth in delight and Ben smiles. Next scene, Ben is resting on Cartman's lap and chatting with "Jennifer Lopez". Again, Cartman looks away in disgust. Last scene is undercover photos taken of Ben and "Jennifer Lopez", which end up on The National Inquisition.]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh Ben, you are so perfect, so spectacularrr in every way
You bring light into my life, Ben. You almost make me forget all about...

BEN

CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Hoohh, I love you too, Ben! [Cartman looks away in disgust] But...
BEN
But what?
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
But what if you still have feelings for the slut with the large ass?
BEN
[pulls off to the side, with South Park in view.] I still care for her. Maybe I always will. But... You just have so much more going on. Up here. [strokes the top of Cartman's hand]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh Ben. Beennn.
BEN
Jenny, can I kiss you?
CARTMAN
[reacts] NO!
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Yes! Oh yes, Ben, kiss me! [Cartman looks in wonder as his hand gets a mind of its own]
CARTMAN
Aw, God dammit! [looks away in disgust once more. Ben begins to give French kisses to "Jennifer Lopez" and the hand responds] Aww- awww, dude!
BEN
Mmm, just like tacos.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Taco-flavored kisses for my Ben.
BEN
You're so hot, baby.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
I make you hot, Ben?
BEN
Mm, yeah. [grabs the hand and kisses it for a while, then lets go. The hand drops down into Ben's pants] Oh, Jenny. [the zipper goes down on his pants] Oh Jenny! ["Jennifer Lopez" bobs up and down]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
[pops up to say] Ben... [drops down again]
BEN
Oh God, Jenny!
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh, Ben, I adore you! [Cartman looks at Ben's actions, then at what his hand is doing...]
CARTMAN
OHH, SICK!! AWW THAT'S IT! [opens his door, hops out, and walks away] WE'RE LEAVING NOW!!
BEN
But I love her!
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Ben!
BEN

CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
I love you, Ben!
[Music Lab Recording Studio, night. "Jennifer Lopez" is recording new tracks. Cartman is practically sleeping on the job as his hand belts out new tunes.]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Ooo baby baby, can I have your tacos?
Two tacos chulo, too. I'm just Jenny from the hood.
Ooo, can I have your tacos? Oh- stop. Stop, stop. STOP!
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
[the band stops playing] What the hell is wrong with you?! You cholos can't even keep a beat! I deserve better than thees! I an Hennifer Lopez! Where is my water?! [a page brings "her" a bottle of water. "Jennifer Lopez" knocks it onto the floor] Not Evian, Pellegrino, you stupid beetch!
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ

AIDE 2
Uh, that's fine Ms. Lopez. Look, it's been a long night. Why don't we pick it up in the morning?
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Fine my ass, cholo! [Cartman wakes up and looks at his hand] I'll tell you when it's fine!
[Music Lab Recording Studio, night, back entrance. Cartamn exits and goes down three steps.]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Stupid idiots! How am I supposed to make an album with those cholos?! [a bat hits a car nearby]
JENNIFER LOPEZ
[stands next to the car she just bashed] You little snot-nose! [Cartman is taken aback] You ruin my career and now you're trying to steal my man?! [holds up the tabloid shown earlier]
CARTMAN
Aww crap.
JENNIFER LOPEZ
You'd better stay away from him! [begins whacking away at Cartman's hand]
CARTMAN
OW! OW! OH JESUS! OW!
[Hell's Pass Hospital, next day. Dr. Doctor is showing Liane, Cartman's mother, an X-ray of her son's hand.]
DR. DOCTOR
Your son's hand has a hairline fracture and two dislocated fingers.
LIANE
Oh dear.
DR. DOCTOR
But I'm more concerned about his state of mind. Your son appears to be completely insane.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
[on its own hospital bed, with wires attached] Ahhh Ahhhh [Cartman sits in a chair displeased]
CARTMAN
I told you this would happen. [Kyle, Stan and Kenny show up.]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh, hello guys.
KYLE
Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh, Kyle, why you no like meee?
CARTMAN
Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck.
KYLE
I hate you. [turns right and walks out]
LIANE
Come on, sweetie. Doctor says you need to get home and get lots of rest.
[Cartman's house, morning. A cock crows. Cartman, asleep, stretches and wakes up, then glances to his left.]
CARTMAN
EHAGH! [next to him is Ben Affleck, naked and relaxed] Moooooommmm! [Ben wakes up]
LIANE
[enters with a cup of coffee and wearing a pink robe] What is it, sweetie?
CARTMAN
Ben Affleck is naked in my bed!
LIANE
Oooo, looks like the tooth fairy was extra-happy with you.[backs out of the room and closes the door.]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Buenos dias, my love.
BEN
Good morning, baby.
CARTMAN
You have to get out of here! Jennifer Lopez is gonna kick my ass again!
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
He's not going anywhere! Ben and I were up all night making love.
CARTMAN
What? Oh- AWWW! [wipes his hand off on his pajamas] Ben Affleck's spooge!!
BEN
Should we tell him the news?
CARTMAN
What news?
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
I think we should tell him.
BEN
It's S'aright?
CARTMAN
S'aright.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
S'aright.
BEN
We're getting married!!
CARTMAN
Oh, balls!
[Kyle's house, day. He, Stan and Kenny watch TV on the couch. The doorbell rings.]
KYLE
Come in. [the bell rings again.] COME IN!! [Cartman enters wearing an oven mitt over his left hand.]
CARTMAN
[sad] Guys, I need to talk to you.
STAN
What's the matter?
CARTMAN
I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez.
KYLE
So stop doing it!
CARTMAN
Stop doing what?
KYLE
You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!
CARTMAN
Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See? [removes the oven mitt and "Jennifer Lopez" emerges coughing]
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Don't you dare ever do that to me again!
KYLE
Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand doesn't need to breathe!
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
You try being in an oven mitt for two hours!
KYLE
I can see your lips moving!
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
I can see your lips moving too, culo!
KYLE
See?! I just saw your lips move!
CARTMAN
Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.
STAN
What's she doing?
KYLE
Come here! [drags Stan off to the dining room] You're not actually buying this crap, are you?!
STAN
I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it.
KYLE
Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, [Kyle does a pretty solid impression of Cartman] "Haha, I got you guys to believe me!" "You guys are stupid!"
STAN
Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us look dumb?
KYLE
YES, dude! [they then walk back into the living room]
STAN
Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you.
CARTMAN
Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh no you don't!
CARTMAN
Quiet, Ms. Lopez.
KYLE
Out! [walks off. Stan and Kenny follow him out]
CARTMAN
Guys... Uh... Uh... [dejected, he turns away and walks out the front door]
[Outside, day. Cartman reaches the sidewalk when he sees something.]
BEN
There you are, Jenny! I've been lookin' all over for you, baby! [Cartman decides to run in the other direction] Jenny? [Cartman sees a car pull up in front of him and then...]
AIDE 1
Ms. Lopez, you were due in the studio two hours ago! Come on! [Cartman decides to ran back towards Ben, but runs into a pair of female legs]
JENNIFER LOPEZ
[disheveled, wielding a running chainsaw over her head] So you're gettin' married, huh? [revs up the motor, and Cartman makes his escape, screaming. In the background, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny have stepped out the door to see what's going on.]
BEN
Don't you hurt her!
BHI PRESIDENT
We'll sue you!
KYLE
Oh Jesus.
[A bridge over a wide river, day. Jennifer Lopez has followed Cartman here. Cartman screams. A police car pulls up from the other end of the bridge. The driver steps out, and both officers draw their guns at Jennifer Lopez, now unrecognizable.]
POLICE OFFICER 1
Freeze, leafblower! [she drops the chainsaw and holds her hands up]
AIDE 1
Arrest that woman! She wants to kill one of our artists! [the arrest is made]
POLICE OFFICER 2
All right, you're going downtown, bean-breath.
BEN
[rushes up to "Jennifer Lopez"] Jenny! Oh, I thought I was going to lose you! Let's run away and get married tonight!
AIDE 2
Hey, she can't get married tonight, she has a recording session! [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny arrive]
BEN
Our love is like rain!
JENNIFER LOPEZ
That's what you said about me, asshole!
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Quiet!
BHI PRESIDENT
Get her out of here!
JENNIFER LOPEZ
Fuck you!
POLICE OFFICER 2
Shut up, picante pants!
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
Everyone be quiet! [Everyone stops what they're doing and look at the hand] I'm... I'm not who you think I am.
BHI PRESIDENT
You're not?
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
No. It was all a lie. A lie I cannot continue anymore. I am not Hennifer Lopez. I am... [Cartman rips off the small wig he had on his hand and delivers a new voice] ...Mitch Conner. [everyone, including Kyle, gasps]
POLICE OFFICER 2
Who's Mitch Conner?
MITCH CONNER
Just your run of the mill con man. I've been moving from town to town, scamming people since I was fifteen. But I'm tired of runnin'.
KYLE
[exasperated] Oh no, no, no.
MITCH CONNER
I've been a cheat all my life. And now I've ruined a singer's career, lost a record company millions, and cost this little boy his precious time.
KYLE
Stop. It.
MITCH CONNER
Mostly, I'm sorry to you, Ben. I'm sorry I played Tiddly Winks with your heart. [Ben begins to sob. Cartman walks to one side of the bridge] But it's over now. The cyanide pill I took should be taking effect very soon. Hmph, looks like the sun is goin' down. I wonder, will I dream? [as the sun drops below the horizon, Cartman opens his hand and a gust of wind is heard. Whatever was possessing the hand parted. Ben sobs once more as Cartman just stares in wonder]
POLICE OFFICER 2
Well, looks like Mitch Conner has cashed in his last chips. [everyone disperses except the boys. Ben stays on for a second, but he too leaves.]
KYLE
[the boys step forward] Dude, who the hell is Mitch Conner?
CARTMAN
I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?
KYLE
[resigns] All right. [Cartman beams] All right, I guess it's possible.
CARTMAN
[dances back to the other three boys] Hahahahahaaaha! [into Kyle's face] I got you kinda! I got you kinda!
[A fast-food Mexican Restaurant, La Taco. People are enjoying their food, one person is waiting for his order, and there are employees behind the counter. One of them looks familiar.]
MANAGER
Okay, Ms. Lopez, over here we have the toppings station. This is where all your cheeses and lettuce will go on. [a man carrying a large bowl walks up behind Lopez and bumps into her]
JENNIFER LOPEZ
[jumping to one side] Ow. Look out, muffinhead!
MANAGER
Ahh, look, Ms. Lopez, uh, if you're gonna be a member of the La Taco family, you're gonna have to learn to get along with people.
JENNIFER LOPEZ
Get a what with who?
MANAGER
Uh why don't you start chopping those onions and I'll come check on you a little later?
JENNIFER LOPEZ
[begins chopping the onions] This is bullshit! How the fuck did I end up working at a La Taco?! I had six platinum records and I starred in five Hollywood movies!
COWORKER
Yeah. Meee too.
CARTMAN AS JENNIFER LOPEZ
[as credits roll]
Oh Ben, you are so perfect, so spectacularrr in every way
You bring light into my life, Ben. You almost make me forget all about...
Tacos! Oh, tacos, so good in my tummy yummy yummy give me more.
I love you, Ben. You almost make me forget about...
Tacos...

synopsis:After they return a missing doll to a little girl, the police department recognizes the boys' efforts and officially names them, "junior deputies."

script:Lil' Crime Stoppers

[South Park neighborhood, day. The boys walk up to Butters' house. Stan knocks on the door. The door opens and Butters' father looks out.]
CHRIS
Yes? [looks down] Oh, hello, boys.
CARTMAN
Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar.
CHRIS
Oooo, little crime stoppers, huh? Well, I'm afraid I don't have any crimes I need solved right now.
KYLE
Awww, shit!
STAN
All right, sir, well, please call us if you need anything. [offers up a business card]
CHRIS
I'll do that. Have fun, boys. [steps back and closes the door. The boys turn and walk away]
CARTMAN
Stupid assholes! [turns and follows] How come nobody has a crime to solve?
KYLE
Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a great idea.
STAN
It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it. [moments later they reach a pink house and Stan knocks again. The door opens and an elderly woman looks out]
MRS. FARNICKLE
Oh, hello there boys.
STAN
Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need solved, for a dollar?
MRS. FARNICKLE
Ohh, neighborhood detectives, huh? Well let me thi-oh yes! There is something!
KYLE
Really?
MRS. FARNICKLE
Yes. Two days ago I put a fresh baked cherry pie out on my window sill to cool. [Stan and Kyle look over at the window] And later, when I went to get it, it was gone.
CARTMAN
My God...
STAN
Have you reported this to any other authorities?
MRS. FARNICKLE
Noo, but I think it's a perfect case for you kids.
KYLE
Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am.
STAN
We're on the case.
[Mrs. Farnickle's house, backyard.]
CARTMAN
What have you got, Marsh?
STAN
Detective McCormick found something interesting. [a shot of Kenny, who just raises his arm and point to his right. The camera pans to Duke, the house pet, licking off the last of the pie]
CARTMAN
[puts a hand on Kyle, looks away and closes his eyes] Jesus, we're too late.
KYLE
I think we can piece this case together now.
[Mrs. Farnickle's house, living room. She and her husband sit back in arm chairs looking at news. The door opens and the boys rush in with the pie tin.]
MRS. FARNICKLE
My pie tin! Oooh, but what happened to the pie?
KYLE
Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory.
MR. FARNICKLE
Well, what do you think happened, little detectives?
STAN
You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time. [the scenario shows Mrs. Farnickle setting the pie on the sill, closing the windows and walking away] But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody. [Mr. Farnickle shows up at the kitchen window, looking at the pie from inside the kitchen]
KYLE
Your husband. [he looks closer at it, putting his hands on the window] He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet.
CARTMAN
Slowly the rage built inside his mind. [Mr. Farnickle is shown in bed, getting angry. Dramatic lighting enhances the mood] "Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!" His only solution became obvious: Kill her!
STAN
His plan was to use a hammer.
CARTMAN
Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death. [the scenario shows Mr. Farnickle walking up behind his wife as she dusts the TV and whacking her three times, killing her and fracturing her skull]
STAN
Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head. [the man plunges the shovel through the woman's neck and cleaves the head from the body. Blood pours out and stains the carpet]
KYLE
Then saw off the arms and legs. [shown in all its graphic glory]
CARTMAN
The torso he would dump into the lake. [Mr. Farnickle tosses his wife's torso over the side of his boat, then watches as the torso heads for the lake bottom]
STAN
The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub. [the man is shown tossing the second leg into the tub, then stirring the solution so that the leg would sink in and disappear]
CARTMAN
And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie.
KYLE
But before he could go through with his entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten... [a new scenario: the man now has the hammer, but the pie is gone when he checks up on it] ...by your dog. [a shot of Duke eating the pie in his doghouse]
CARTMAN
Looks like the game is over, old man! [the surprised couple looks at them]
MRS. FARNICKLE
Oh my God, what kind of television have you kids been watching??
STAN
Just the news.
MRS. FARNICKLE
All right, all right, you you boys run along now.
STAN
[stays behind] Hey, you owe us a dollar, lady.
MRS. FARNICKLE
Fine, here, just go! [gives him the dollar, and he joins the others outside]
STAN
Wow, look, you guys! Our first dollar! [shows off a crisp new one-dollar bill]
KYLE
We're in business!
[A basement, some time later. The dollar bill is newly framed and hung on a wall in ... Cartman's basement, which is now the South Park Detectives headquarters. Pictures of suspects are on the wall below the framed dollar, a chalkboard has some instructions listed, and some suspects already interviewed are listed on the wall beneath the stairs. Kyle puts a file away in a filing cabinet as the other boys do other tasks.]
CARTMAN
Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington.
LIANE
Boys, you have a little visitor. [a little girl descends the stairs past Liane]
GIRL
Is this the South Park Crime Unit?
THE BOYS
Ah! Oh. [they jump up and leave their tasks to meet their first client]
STAN
Yes it is!
GIRL
I lost my dolly.
CARTMAN
[waving his mom off] Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all. [Liane goes upstairs. Cartman looks up] And get us some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass!
KYLE
Do you know where your doll is?
GIRL
If I knew where it was, it wouldn't be lost.
STAN
All right, Sarah, come over here. [everyone moves over to Kenny's desk. Sarah hops up on the witness chair] Now, I want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny.
SARAH
[Kenny begins to draw as she talks] She has curly blonde hair. And a wed dress. And a turned-up nose. And a blue bow in her hair.
STAN
You got it, Ken? [Kenny finishes and nods]
KYLE
All right, let's see. [Kenny turns the paper around and shows off a crudely-drawn woman with huge, olive-shaped boobs] Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said!
STAN
Put that away, dude! [Kenny walks up to a small bulletin board of KeNnY'S mOST WANtED women, all of which have large boobs]
CARTMAN
Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll.
[Sarah's house, day. The boys swarm into the girl's bedroom and check out all the possibilities.]
CARTMAN
No sign of forced entry.
KYLE
[at the window] But the window isn't locked.
STAN
[turns to address Cartman] Right, so it's possible that the thief sat out in that tree. [the scenario begins. A view into the bedroom from the tree at night] He would have watched Sarah with her doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife. [a hand appears, then the opposite hand with a knife. The knife cuts the first hand as Sarah drops her doll on the bedroom floor] The pain gave him sick pleasure.
KYLE
Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it.
CARTMAN
We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room.
[As they pause, another group of boys swarm in and start their own investigation.]
A BOY
All right, let's do this by the books! McDonnell, [one boy steps forward] give me smears of all the places the doll used to be! [goes off to get samples] Mitchell, [another boy steps forward] run a tap on the phone! [goes off to tap the phone]
STAN
[approaches the boy] Hey, kid, what are you doing?
THE BOY
Agent Tucker, FBI! And you?
STAN
Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation!
TUCKER
...Not anymore, you're not!
CARTMAN
Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over!
TUCKER
Can't we? You guys are playing Detectives. We're playing FBI. That gives us jurisdiction over you!
STAN
Aw crap!
TUCKER
I want choppers on the roof ready to go! [one of his friends goes to the window, the other two head out of the room]
KYLE
Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty!
TUCKER
Good. Then you can help us by telling me everything you know.
[Sarah's house, afternoon, outside. The boys have been kicked out by the FBI boys and head for the sidewalk.]
STAN
Son of a bitch stupid FBI!
CARTMAN
Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat.
STAN
No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that little girl's doll before those FBI guys do.
KENNY
(Yeah!)
KYLE
Yeah, but how?
STAN
We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.
CARTMAN
Right. I think I know exactly where to start.
[Cartman's basement, later. The boys have called Butters in and he's confused, being under the spotlight.]
CARTMAN
[thinks hard of how to start the interrogation] Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?!
BUTTERS
Ah, I was at home.
CARTMAN
Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth! [behind him, Stan and Kyle watch from a makeshift booth]
KENNY
[patting Butters' shoulder] (Awww, don't be so mean. Butters is our friend, huh?) [Butters smiles]
STAN
[behind the booth] They've gotten really good at this good-cop bad-cop thing.
CARTMAN
You're going down, Butters! You hear me?!
KENNY
(Aw, now don't say that. Poor little kid.)
CARTMAN
You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying!
KENNY
(Aww, it's okay, little fella.)
BUTTERS
Well I don't have nothin' to confess. Honestly.
CARTMAN
Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample. [holds out a cup for Butters to take]
BUTTERS
How do I do that?
CARTMAN
You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup!
BUTTERS
Well how do I make semen... come out of my body?
CARTMAN
Stop playing games!
BUTTERS
I'm not playing. I really don't know!
CARTMAN
That does it! Wait right here! [goes behind the booth and laughs] Guys, did you hear that? Butters doesn't know how you make semen come out of your body.
KYLE
How... do you make semen come out?
CARTMAN
I don't know. I was hoping you guys did.
STAN
It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out.
CARTMAN
Really?
KYLE
Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast.
CARTMAN
Oh okay. [returns to the table] Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?!
BUTTERS
No!
CARTMAN
Follow me to the bathroom. [goes upstairs]
KENNY
[soothing] (Aw, it's okay, kid. It's not going to hurt.) [Butters hops off the chair and follows Cartman upstairs]
[The Cartman hallway. Cartman takes Butters to the restroom.]
CARTMAN
Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup.
BUTTERS
My wiener??
CARTMAN
Yes, retard. Semen comes from your wiener. Now do it! [Butters grabs the door handle and shuts the door. Cartman waits for a few second before doing anything] Well, Butters?!
BUTTERS
Ah I'm pullin' on my wiener, but nothin's happening.
CARTMAN
Well pull harder!
BUTTERS
...ow... Ow... It's not workin'.
CARTMAN
Try doin' it faster.
BUTTERS
[increasing the speed] Ow. Ow. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow. Naw, nothin'.
CARTMAN
Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?!
BUTTERS
NOOooo!
CARTMAN
The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes!
BUTTERS
Okay!!
STAN
[rushing up with Kyle and Kenny] Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip that a doll was found near Fosse's house!
CARTMAN
Let's go! [They leave. Butters remains in the bathroom]
BUTTERS
...ow... Ow!
[Fosse's house, a nice rambling house. Cartman approaches the front door as Stan, Kyle, and Kenny stand off to one side. He turns and places his back against the wall, then sneaks up to a window. He looks in just a bit. Inside, Fosse plays with a doll... red dress, turned-up nose, blonde curly hair with two blue bows attached... just as Sarah had described. The two boys giggle as they play.]
FOSSE
Huhuh, Okay Ms., Ms. Jones, heh, me and Doctor... Flick here just need to... check your vagina. [pulls up the front of the doll's dress and giggles with Bill]
BILL
That's gay. [giggles with Fosse]
FOSSE
Yeah, that's gay. [Cartman looks in intently. He then turns his back against the wall and backs away with his water pistol drawn]
CARTMAN
[in hushed tones] Kyle!
[Kyle looks on as Cartman starts signing to him. Cartman holds up his index finger and shows the fleshy side to Kyle, then points two fingers to his own eyeballs, then turns the fingers out and shows them, then motions inside with his thumb, then makes a grabbing gesture, then something like a fist, then a thumbs-up, then a fist turned out, then points to Kyle, then points again, then taps the side of his own head, then makes a J sign on his head, then rests.]
KYLE
What? [Cartman repeats the gestures again] What??
CARTMAN
[repeats the gestures] I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew!
KYLE
[gasps, then with determination, in hushed tones] They've got the doll! [he, Stan, and Kenny move in and the four boys take positions around the door. Kyle stands at the door, Cartman and Kenny on either side, Stan at Kyle's back]
STAN
[in hushed tones] Okay, okay. Ready? Break the door down! [Kenny turns and rings the bell. Inside, Bill and Fosse stop their play and go to the door]
FOSSE
Huh huh who is it?!
STAN
South Park Junior Detectives! We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll!
FOSSE
[giggles] They're playing Detective. [they giggle]
BILL
That's gay. [they giggle]
FOSSE
[calls out] You're gay! [outside, the boys lower their guns.]
KYLE
What do we do now?
STAN
I don't know.
CARTMAN
Well if they're not gonna give us back the doll, then we have no choice. Let's go tell on them. [hops down from the porch and walks away]
STAN
Dude, we just can't tell on them.
CARTMAN
Why not?
KYLE
Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people.
FOSSE
[from inside] Detectives! [Cartman returns, and the camera angle switches to the living room. Bill and Fosse have made the doll a hostage, having tied her up on a chair. Fosse continues, giggling] If you don't get out of here, we're gonna rip the doll's head off!
BILL
Yeah.
FOSSE
We were playing gynecologists and now we're playing criminals.
BILL
That's gay.
FOSSE
We're gay.
STAN
Jesus! They're gonna kill her!
KYLE
We've got to do something.
CARTMAN
Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got!
TUCKER
[offscreen] Attention! You in the house! [the other kids are shown, with their own little car] This is Agent Tucker with the FBI! We have you surrounded. Sort of.
STAN
[he and the others approach the FBI kids] Hey, you butt-holes can't play FBI here!
CARTMAN
Yeah! This was our hot lead!
TUCKER
And you did a great job leading us here. Now you just stay out of our way! [into the megaphone] The gig is up, Fosse! Bring out the doll! Or we'll tell on you!
STAN
We're gonna charge the front door and go get it.
TUCKER
No you're not.
CARTMAN
Dammit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off!
TUCKER
Climb off, kid! We say you can't charge the front door, and you have to obey what the FBI says! That's the rules!
STAN
Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us!
TUCKER
Yes it does so! [a long pause]
KYLE
...Grrrr!!! [the boys turn and walk away]
KENNY
(What do we do now?)
STAN
We go get the doll ourselves.
KYLE
But they said we can't charge the front door.
STAN
That's right. [cocks his left hand] But they didn't say anything about going in the back.
TUCKER
Come on guys. You don't wanna hurt that doll.
BILL
Huhuh. [notices the SP boys coming in] Oh crap, they're coming in the back! [the shootout begins. The boys fan out and make firing noises as they aim at Bill and Fosse. Bill and Fosse return fire with their own noises] That's gay. [he and Fosse hide behind an armchair]
STAN
[pops up from the couch and fires away, using the back of the couch as a shield] Bang bang bang! I got you, Fosse!
FOSSE
No you didn't!
STAN
Did so!
FOSSE
No, 'cause I got... special wizard armor on.
KYLE
We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons, ass-face!
CARTMAN
All right, that does it! Cover me! I'm going slo-mo! [moves out from behind the couch, shooting slowly but walking normally] Wwwaaahhh!
FOSSE
[makes sweeping gestures with his hands] Oooh, they got me! [falls a bit further with each] Whooaaa, whooaaa, whooaaa. [now fully stretched on the floor, closes his eyes as if dead]
BILL
[follows suit] rr uh rr uh, uhhhh. [makes like he's dead]
FOSSE
[opens his eyes and giggles] We're dead.
BILL
[opens his eyes and giggles] That's gay.
STAN
[getting the doll after he, Kyle and Kenny approach the chair] We got it.
[Sarah's house, later. Stan and the boys walk up to the house again. Stan knocks on the door, and Sarah's mother answers.]
STAN
Ms. Peterson, is your daughter home?
SARAH
[appears at the doorway and lights up as she runs for her doll] My dolly! [gets it and holds it tight]
CARTMAN
We got her back safe. Lost a lot of good men in the process.
SARAH'S MOM
Well you boys are little heroes. I'm going to call the police department and let them know what brave little detectives you are! [the boys smile proudly]
[Park County Police Station, day. This building is much bigger than the building Barbrady upholds the law from in South Park.]
DAWSON
Hello there little crime stoppers, I'm Lieutenant Dawson with the Park County Police. I heard you did a great job finding Sarah Peterson's doll.
STAN
We do what we can, sir.
DAWSON
Well, that's fantastic, kids. And for all your terrific sleuth-solving, I'm hereby making you all Junior Detectives. [hands out badges]
KYLE
[Kyle opens his] Wow! [the others have similar reactions]
DAWSON
That means you boys are now an official part of the department.
CARTMAN
Kewl!
DAWSON
All right, so ready for your first assignment?
STAN
Sure.
DAWSON
Okay. There's a meth lab down at 567 Mala Vista. The operators are probably armed to the hilt with illegal weapons. I want you to get down there and see what you can find!
KYLE
Ah... a a a meth lab?
DAWSON
[sits at his desk] I don't want any problems. Just take 'em down by the books. Now get over there; the mayor's all over my ass on this one! [the boys turn to leave] On, and deputies: you screw this up and I'll have you working graveyard shift behind a desk! Move it! [the boys run off]
[Nighttime in the boondocks. The boys walk along a barren stretch of road.]
KYLE
What is a meth lab, anyway?
STAN
I don't know. Let's just hurry up. I wanna get home in time to watch Crime Drama. [they turn and walk towards a large building in the distance]
[The meth lab. Three men sit around a table as a fourth man works behind them. The junior detectives approach the front door. Stan knocks. The men inside quickly arm themselves.]
STAN
Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework?
KYLE
Nah. Dude, I totally spaced it. [windows begin breaking as shots are fired at the boys]
MAN 1
You die, pigs! [gunfire continues breaking windows] You want to die, huh? [loses control of the gun, which causes a bullet to ricochet and hit some flammable liquids. A fire erupts and begins to spread, torching one of the man's friends. The burning friend breaks through the front door and runs out. The first man and another man hop into a truck and break through the garage door. The passenger pulls out his gun]
MAN 3
You won't take us alive! [their truck hits a ramp and goes into the air, twisting to the left and ending up in the middle of a road. Another truck arrives and its driver honks his horn. The oncoming truck strikes the disabled truck and pushes it along. At a nearby intersection, a car strikes the disabled truck and that truck blows up. Three burning people get out of the truck and run around. The fourth man in the meth lab flies a plane]
MAN 4
So long, coppers! [his fuel level hits empty] Oh, shit! [the plane goes straight down and hits the post office and another building. More burning people run around, and the boys can barely believe what they're seeing]
STAN
Damn.
[Park County Police Dept., Dawson's office, later that night. He reads the police report and paces behind his desk.]
DAWSON
One UPS vehicle valued at twenty-five thousand dollars, one civilian vehicle worth sixteen thousand, the second floor of the post office AND a coffee shop valued at sixty thousand! The mayor's gonna have my ass!
STAN
Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the-
DAWSON
You got careless! Now, I don't know how they do things down at that dog-and-pony show they call the Fourth Grade, but here we have rules! Jesus, we don't even have guys to question now, because you killed them all!
KYLE
We're sorry.
DAWSON
One more slip-up like that and I'll have your badges! You hear me?! Now hit the showers!
[Park County Police Dept., locker room. Three men are changing clothes, so they're all in their briefs. The boys enter.]
OFFICER 1
Well well well, if it isn't the super-cops. [the officers begin to giggle]
OFFICER 2
Hey Murphy, think they'll let me borrow their G.I. Joes?
OFFICER 4
Come on, you guys. Leave them alone.
MURPHY
[Officer 1] Relax, Hopkins! [removes his briefs and drops them to the ground] All fun and games, right? [moves to the end of the lockers and hides behind it, only to peek out] Soho, tell us, rookies, you ah... find yourself a little bonus in that house??
CARTMAN
Uh bonus?
MURPHY
Come on! We all skim a little off the top. Oh. Or are you too good for that? [walks back to the other officers] You think you're gonna waltz in here and clean up the system. Is that it?
STAN
[softly] We just wanna be junior detectives.
MURPHY
LOOK, we all work hard! And we deserve more than the thirty-thousand a year we get paid! So what if we take in a little on the side?
OFFICER 2
Yeah! Who the hell are you to change that?!
HOPKINS
I said, back off Murphy!
MURPHY
Why don't you and your rookie friends make us
OFFICER 2
That's right. Come on, bring it!
OFFICER 3
Yeah, let's go! Come on, bring it!
DAWSON
What the hell is the problem here??
MURPHY
No problem, sir. No problem at all.
DAWSON
Then hit the showers, all of you!
[The shower room, moments later. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are taking their showers. Kyle drops his soap to fart, then picks it up again. Cartman works on his hair.]
KYLE
Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore.
CARTMAN
Me neither.
STAN
It'll get better, guys.
KYLE
Better how, dude?
STAN
[puts his soap away] Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time into it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners?
KYLE
We were happy playing Laundromat Owners.
STAN
I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle?
CARTMAN
[intervening] Hey! Broflovski's a good cop!
STAN
You guys can go back to playing Laundromat Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna give those kids playing the FBI a chance to laugh at us. I'll see you guys at school tomorrow.
[Cartman's house, night. His door opens, and a tired Cartman walks in.]
CARTMAN
Awwwwrrr-auugh. [hangs up his coat and holster on the coat tree in the living room]
LIANE
Eric, where have you been? It's ten thirty.
CARTMAN
We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.
LIANE
Well you should've called Mommy.
CARTMAN
[turns and snaps at her] Will you get off my back?! It's hard enough I gotta work the beat, and now I gotta come home to your nagging?! [realizes what he's doing, then turns away] Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired.
LIANE
Well, why don't you get ready for snoogums' night-night, and I'll bring you some toasty chocolate nummers?
CARTMAN
[straightens up and smiles] Okay. [turns and walks off to bed. He passes by the bathroom. Butters is still in there]
BUTTERS
Who-o-o-o-a. Oowwww!
CARTMAN
[stops] Butters?
BUTTERS
Yes?
CARTMAN
Are you still trying to give a semen sample?
BUTTERS
Well I'm tryin', but nothing's comin' out.
CARTMAN
Well, keep tryin', Butters.
BUTTERS
Okay. [Cartman walks off] Ow. Ooww!
[South Park Elementary, day. The boys are in class, sleeping. As Butters was at home at 9 am the previous day, this day is Monday.]
MR. GARRISON
And so you can see, children, that the women's movement of the late fifties and the early sixties had a profound effect on feminism in America. [turns around and quickly notices the sleeping boys] Uh, boys! [the boys stir and wake up] Would it trouble you terribly not to sleep in my class?
KYLE
Uh we weren't sleeping, Mr. Garrison.
MR. GARRISON
Oh well, then maybe you can tell me who was in charge of the feminist movement of the early sixties!
CARTMAN
[thinks] A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods?
MR. GARRISON
Right, but who was the fattest oldest skank on her period?! [the boys look at each other, confused and afraid] That's what I thought! Now pay attention! [turns back to the board] Okay, children, now, the biggest skank of all was was an old fat-ass by the name of-
DAWSON
[bursting through the classroom door] Marsh! Broflovski! McCormick! Cartman! In my office! [leaves]
THE BOYS
[hanging their heads] Eeagh!
[Park County Police Department, later. The boys walk in sleepily. Dawson holds a file in his right hand.]
DAWSON
Looks like that meth lab you took down was the tip of the iceberg. They found a paper trail leading all the way to the biggest crime syndicate in Colorado.
CARTMAN
Uh oh...
DAWSON
The operators apparently run their business out of a sleazy strip joint down in Inglewood. They're all cop killers, so I'm sending you in undercover. [the boys look at each other]
KYLE
Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was-
DAWSON
What?! Now you listen to me! I'm givin' you one last chance! You're good cops, but you let your emotions get in the way! And your little "shoot first ask questions later" technique has no place in this century! Now you get down to that strip joint and you do it by the books, you got it?! The mayor is on my ass and blablablah! [the boys turn left and walk off. As they head for the entrance they walk down the hall. Around one corner are two of the officers they met in the locker room]
MURPHY
So, what did you boys have to say to the lieutenant?
STAN
Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff.
MURPHY
Maybe you decided you needed to tell him about our... bonus money.
KYLE
No. [the boys walk away]
OFFICER 2
They're lying.
MURPHY
They're dead!
[Inglewood, Colorado, night. A big city. The strip club shown is The Peppermint Hippo. Inside there are several dancers undulating for their patrons on individual stages. Other dancers dance on the club floor for individual patrons. The boys enter the club.]
KYLE
Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble.
KENNY
[stops and looks around, then jumps for joy] (Woohoo!!) [rushes up to catch the other boys, who now sit around a small stage]
STRIPPER
[bloated woman with a coarse voice, opens an embrace to Stan] Would you like a dance?
STAN
No thanks.
STRIPPER
[moves to Kyle] Dance? [moves on] Anyone like a dance?
DJ
Well all right, guests, put your hands together. Be sure to tip the dancers. And now, come on, let's hear it for Candy!
BOUNCER
[walks up to the boys] Whoa whoa, what the hell are you kids doin' in here? This isn't an appropriate place for children.
STRIPPER
[walking in the foreground, on the other side of the small stage] Dance? Anyone like a dance?
KYLE
Uh, it's okay. We know the owner.
BOUNCER
[crosses his arms] Oh, really? Let's go see.
[The Peppermint Hippo back room.]
OWNER
All right, so we'll have to start havin' the McCormicks make our meth again and-
BOUNCER
Hey Gino, these kids say they know you.
GINO
What? Ha-I don't know no kids.
BOUNCER
I didn't think so. All right, you kids-
GINO
Hey wait a minute. These kids might be just what we need to get our drugs past the security at DIA. How would you like to join our family?
TALL GOON
Yo Gino, I know I've seen these kids before, man. These kids are 5-0!
GINO
What?
TALL GOON
These kids are cops, man! [the five men in the room assume positions and start firing away at the boys. A man at the door is shot and he falls away. The boys begin pretending to fire back and make shooting noises.]
CARTMAN
Bang bang bang... [the boys move behind a chair. The men continue firing. The boys move back into view]
STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
Bang bang bang... [the men move to lesser-powered weapons]
KENNY
(Pakew! Pakew!)
CARTMAN
[looks at Kenny] Kenny, it doesn't go "Pakew! Pakew!", it goes "BANG BANG BANG!!" [outside, police cars of all types pull up to the club. Dawson quickly jumps out of his car. An explosion appears in two windows of the club, and Dawson ducks a little]
DAWSON
God damnit! Those junior detectives and their heroically reckless ways! Murphy! Jenkins! Hopkins! Get in there! [The three men move in. Jenkins is Officer 2. Inside, two of the owner's men rush out of the back room, and the strippers rush out of the way. The men turn around and shoot back at the boys. The boys return fire. None of the four boys has yet been hit. The gunfight continues. The old stripper walks by again]
STRIPPER
Dance??? Anybody like a dance??? [walks by without being hit once. The other two men appear and shoot at the boys]
HOPKINS
[enters the club] Freeze! South Park detectives! [Murphy and Jacobs quickly enter and take aim. Everyone stops and turns around to face the detectives. The DJ stands in his booth] Great job, boys. You found the meth boss!
GINO
Detective Murphy! Jenkins! Uh what the hell are you doing? We had a deal.
HOPKINS
[looks at his colleagues with suspicion] A deal?
MURPHY
That's right. We're partners in the drug business. Everything was fine until these "super-cops" joined the force. [the boys look stunned at the revelation: these cops are crooked]
JENKINS
Now we've gotta kill you all.
HOPKINS
Boys! Down! [the boys look for cover as the two crooked cops join the five men in firing at Hopkins. The boys huddle under a table]
DJ
Huh alright guys, put your hands together, a lot of shootin' and killin' goin' on, but be sure to tip your waitress let's hear it for Rebecca.
DAWSON
Christ! Those junior detectives have no regard for the law! [FBI trucks pull up and agents pour out of them]
LEAD FBI AGENT
Get me a hard line to the phone! And I want choppers on the roof!
DAWSON
[walks up] Who the hell are you??
LEAD FBI AGENT
[whips out his badge] Agent Fields, FBI!
DAWSON
Hey, I'm in charge of this investigation.
FIELDS
Not anymore, you're not.
DAWSON
But that's not fair!
FIELDS
Is so! Is so! [inside, the gunfight continues. Hopkins is shot, and he quickly kills two of Gino's men. Jenkins quickly shoots at Hopkins and gets the right arm. Hopkins winces and falls down]
JENKINS
Sorry, Detective Hopkins. We can't let anybody know about our partnership.
GINO
That's right. We split it all, fifty-fifty!
MURPHY
That's right. [raises his gun and shoots Gino through the forehead. Gino's body slides down along the wall behind him] I think we'll take a hundred percent now.
JENKINS
Huhuh yeah. Sorry, Gino, but in business like this, sometimes partnerships need to end.
MURPHY
That's right. [raises his gun and shoots Jenkins through the side of the head, and Jenkins wavers and falls] Sometimes partnerships need to end. [now seeing the boys] Well, super-cops, looks like I'll be taking in all the money now. I'm in business alone. And that means that the only person I can't trust... is myself. [raises the gun and shoots himself through his chin, then falls alongside Hopkins]
[Outside the Peppermint Club. The paramedics have arrived and are removing the bodies. Hopkins, up and about, reaches the boys.]
HOPKINS
[his arm in a sling] It looks like Murphy and Jenkins got what they deserved. If it weren't for you boys, we would have never cleaned up the department.
DAWSON
[approaches the boys] All right, detectives, let's get one thing straight! I do not agree with your methods! You're uncontrolled, and you're negligent! But by God you get the job done. Congratulations!
STAN
Thanks.
DAWSON
I'm probably going to regret this, but, well, I'm promoting you to full detectives. There'll be lots of action, and that big paycheck you've always wanted. [the paramedics close up the ambulance, then climb in and leave. The boys mull over the offer]
STAN
...I think I have a better idea.
[Cartman's basement, next day. The boys are back at playing Laundromat. The wall under the stairs has been removed to show the washer and dryer, which are now framed by a doorway saying "Employees Only." Two clothes racks are seen, and the detectives' desks are refashioned as washer/dryer combos. A "Laundromat" sign on the wall looks over the whole thing.]
KYLE
Hello, sir. Welcome to the Broflovski Laundromat.
STAN
[walks up with one of his outfits] Yes, I have a suit I need dry-cleaned, and pressed, please.
KYLE
Certainly.
CARTMAN
[walks up with some clothes] Here you are, Mister McCormick. Your laundry is all done and folded. That will be nine ninety five. [Kenny hands him a card] On your American Express.
BUTTERS
[coming down the stairs] Fellas! Hey fellas! I got it! Ah I got my semen sample!
CARTMAN
You did?
BUTTERS
Yeah. I was up there poundin' my wiener for two days straight, aaand finally, I thought about Stan's Mom's boobs, and this little tiny spooge of... this white stuff came out.
KYLE
That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners.
CARTMAN
Would you like those pants cleaned for four ninety five?
End of Lil' Crime Stoppers

synopsis:The citizens of South Park are being forced off their land to make way for a new super highway after owners of the Three Feathers Indian Casino acquire the town.

script:Red Man's Greed

[Three Feathers Casino, night. People flock in. The building is massive, the front entrance is prefaced with a long pool with water jets shooting water into the air. The interior is shown, with its slot machines and milling crowds. The boys enter with the Marshes and the Broflovskis. Randy and Gerald carry cigars in their hands.]
STAN
Wow, dude.
CARTMAN
Man, Indians have it good, huh?
RANDY
Now, Eric, they're called Native Americans, remember? Show some respect.
NATIVE AMERICAN CHIEF
Welcome to the Three Feathers Casino. I'm your host, Chief Runs With Premise. Please try your luck at one of our many games.
CARTMAN
[eagerly] All right, let's go! [moves forward]
RUNS WITH PREMISE
Halt. [spreads his arms out] I am afraid minors cannot go onto the casino floor.
CARTMAN
I'm not a miner, dumbass! Do you see a shovel in my hand?!
RUNS WITH PREMISE
You kids can enjoy our Native American Comedy Club.
GERALD
All right, we're gonna hit the tables. Why don't you kids run along to the comedy club? [Stan shrugs and the boys leave. The adults move forward]
RANDY
All right, time to win some money!
GERALD
Oh yeah! blackjack table!
BLACKJACK DEALER
Welcome to the blackjack table. May luck run through you, like the spirit of the buffalo.
SHEILA
Gerald, this is ten dollars a hand!
GERALD
Relax, sweetie [in hushed tones] I know how to count cards.
SHEILA
Well I don't wanna play here!
SHARON
Yeah. Come on, Sheila, let's go to the nickel slots.
RANDY
Oooo, the nickel slots! You might win the thirty-dollar jackpot! Ahh, women, huh? God I hate 'em. [smokes]
GERALD
All right, time to show these people how to gamble!
[An entrance is shown - The Laughing Coyote Comedy Lodge, then the interior of the lodge itself. A Native American drummer sits on stage.]
ANNOUNCER
Welcome to the Three Feathers Comedy Club. Please put your hands together for Johnny Manymoons! [Johnny approaches the mic]
KYLE
What is Native American comedy, anyway?
MANYMOONS
[takes the mic] Thank you, thank you. Bear walked into a bar. Bear said to Deer, "May I please... have a drink?" And so Deer said to Bear, "Why the big paws?" [the drums strikes three beats]
AUDIENCE
Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! [the boys are confused]
MANYMOONS
Many moons ago, Pony and Eagle walked up to Coyote. Pony said to Coyote, "I am very mad at Eagle. Will you yell at him for me?" Coyote said to Pony, "Why can you not yell yourself?" And Pony replied, "Because I am a little horse." [the drums strikes three beats]
AUDIENCE
Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!
[The blackjack table. Gerald sits alone fiddling with some chips. Randy returns from somewhere with a cup of coins.]
RANDY
How's it goin', Gerald?
GERALD
[nervous, fidgeting] Ohh, not so good.
RANDY
Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm down three hundred bucks.
GERALD
Yeah. I'm down twenty-six thousand.
RANDY
Yeah, well, maybe we should- ...wait. Twenty-six thousand dollars??
GERALD
I forgot to tell you, ah I have a gambling problem.
RANDY
Gerald, twenty-six thousand-!
GERALD
Sshhhh! I have to win it back before Sheila finds out!
RANDY
Where did you get that kind of money??
GERALD
The casino gave me credit! I put the house up as collateral! But I still have this ten-dollar chip.
BLACKJACK DEALER
Dealer, twenty one. [takes the last chip] Sorry.
GERALD
[collapses on the table] That's it. I'm destitute. [leaps up and grabs Randy] Loan me money! You've gotta have money in the cup! [grabs the cup and tries to wrest it from Randy] Wha- what's in the cup?
RANDY
[keeps the cup] Just six quarters!
GERALD
[sits down and mopes] Oh God. Oh Jesus.
BLACKJACK DEALER
Thank you for playing at Three Feathers. May your life be filled with the song of the sparrow.
GERALD
[bolts upright again] Oh, shove the song of the sparrow up your ass!
[Three Bears Casino, sometime later. Randy and Gerald sit on a bench next to some slot machines. Gerald's head hangs low.]
GERALD
How am I going to tell my family? [raises his head] How do I tell them that tomorrow, we have to ...pack up our things and ...get out of the house? [Sheila and Sharon show up in the background with the boys.]
SHEILA
There's daddy!
GERALD
[hangs his head] Oh, Jesus. [the boys and the women arrive.]
SHEILA
Where have you guys been? We've been looking all over.
KYLE
Yeah. Come on, Dad, this place sucks. I wanna go.
GERALD
[raises his head] What, What did you say?
KYLE
I said I wanna leave.
GERALD
[shifts gears and stands] Oh, you wanna leave, huh?! Okay, fine, Kyle, when we get home, we'll just pack up our things, load them in the car, and we'll leave! [Sheila and Kyle are baffled]
KYLE
What?? No, no, I mean, I-
GERALD
No, no, no, if you wanna leave South Park, fine! Tomorrow we're leaving!
SHEILA
Gerald, what are you talking about?
GERALD
Oh, you heard him, Sheila! Kyle wants to leave! Our nice old house doesn't interest Kyle anymore! Well I'm calling a moving company right now! [leaves]
CARTMAN
Well, you shouldn't be such a dick, dude. [Kyle remains baffled, even as he looks at Cartman]
SHARON
[walks up to Randy] What's wrong with Gerald?
RANDY
He... he lost his house to the Native Americans.
SHARON
What?? But don't the Native Americans know he has nowhere else to go?
RANDY
They don't care. [the camera rises and focuses on a window behind them]
[The casino office. Chief Runs with Premise looks out over the floor.]
RUNS WITH PREMISE
Look at them! Small-minded idiots pouring their life-savings away!
ELDER 1
Their cash flows out of them like diarrhea from the buffalo.
ELDER 2
[wearing glasses] Yes, but we have milked these simple mountain folk almost dry. If we really want to see cash flow, we need to bring in city-people from Denver.
RUNS WITH PREMISE
[turns around] Yeessss. It is time for us to implement our plan. [walks over to an easel on which sits a map of Colorado, with a new highway drawn on it between the casino and Denver] A superhighway, built from Denver right to our casino!
AIDE 1
And what do we do about the small town of South Park that lies in the highway's way?
RUNS WITH PREMISE
[holding up large stacks of bills] Simple. We buy it, and we demolish it! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!
ELDERS
Ha ha ha ha!
[South Park Elementary, next day. A town meeting is being held in the gym. Mayor McDaniels sits at a table with four aides, two on either side of her.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
And that's really all I can tell you. The town of South Park is going to be leveled, in order to make way for a twelve-lane superhighway.
RANDY
[rises] But how can they do that?!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
The Native Americans have purchased the land out from under us. Tomorrow, they're buying the last of what they need to have complete ownership.
JIMBO
[rises] Well can't we stop them? Let's call the bank.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
The Native Americans bought the bank.
MR. GARRISON
Oh my God.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Now, look, it isn't all horrible. The Native Americans are offering you retail values on your homes.
RANDY
No, screw that! We'll just pool our money together and buy the town ourselves! [the town clamors in agreement]
CHEF
[rises] Yeah! Let the South Park people own South Park! [the town clamors in agreement]
RANDY
How much do we have to raise, Mayor?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Three hundred thousand dollars. [the town thinks, then grumbles]
RANDY
Ohhh, never mind. [sits down]
[The town library. Nine boys sit in front of it: Timmy, Jimmy, Tweek, Butters, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, and Alex.]
BUTTERS
How can they do that, huh? How can they make us all move away?
CARTMAN
Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians!
KYLE
[correcting] Native Americans. [Stan rises and walks away from the building]
STAN
Our whole town, gone. We'd had such great times here. [begins to reminisce]
[The scenes are as follows:
Zombies destroy the town as the boys walk through in their Halloween costumes.
Trapper Keeper grabs a phone booth as it reaches mammoth dimensions.
The townsfolk fight the mutant turkeys.
Christopher Reeve throws a truck at some people, and they dive out of the way.
The giant fireworks snake demolishes the town.
The Geldon causes havoc on the Drew Carey Show as the Knights of Standards and Practices watch.
The pirate ghost ship fires off a cannon shot and the townsfolk dive out of the way. Some of them are killed on impact.
The pro-war and anti-war factions fight over the Iraq war.
The town reenacts the Civil War
Mr. Hankey summons up massive amounts of crap in order to get rid of the Hollywood gliterati
Mecha-Streisand fights off Ultura Marutin and Megara Poatia.]
STAN
[stops reminiscing, turns around, and walks back to the boys] We can't let them do it, you guys! We have to find a way to stop those Native Americans!
THE BOYS
Yeah!
ALEX
Yeah, this is our town!
STAN
We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team!
KYLE, BUTTERS, TWEEK
Yeah!
CARTMAN
That's right!
BUTTERS
Yeah, ahh, that's right!
ALEX
Yeah, we're a team!
STAN
We just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars! [the boys start thinking]
CARTMAN
[rises and moves to the sidewalk] Wait a minute! I've got it, you guys! We can get Kyle infected with AIDS! And then start a charity organization that we steal money from! Come on, let's go! [trots off excitedly. The other boys just watch him leave. Cartman returns a few seconds later] No? We can't give Kyle AIDS?
STAN
We need something that'll get us money tomorrow!
BUTTERS
Hey, I know! How about a dog parade? [smiles]
KYLE
Dog parade?
BUTTERS
Yeah! We dress up all our dogs in little outfits, and parade them down the street. [closes his eyes and beams] It'll be so adorable!
KYLE
How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that?
BUTTERS
Oh... Uh well, we could sell tickets to our moms and dads.
STAN
Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters!
BUTTERS
Oh... [the boys go back to thinking]
CARTMAN
Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now.
[South Park, later on, day. The Broflovski house is shown, and a massive bulldozer rolls up to knock it down. A large chunk of it is torn off by the scoop.]
SHEILA
Oh, Gerald, I, I can't watch!
RANDY
[walks up to the Chief] How can you do this to people?
RUNS WITH PREMISE
We're sorry. But if we do not build a superhighway, our casino might stop seeing profits.
RANDY
There's more to life than profits!
RUNS WITH PREMISE
Well like what?
RANDY
Well like, you know, Slurpees and stuff. [more of the house is torn down]
CHRIS
Well, come on, honey, I guess we should start packing up our things as well.
MR. GARRISON
Yeah. [begins to wave] So long, South Park.
STAN
Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars!
CHRIS
A dog parade? [smiles in anticipation]
STAN
No!
RANDY
Stan, we've all tried to raise money, but we only raise ten thousand dollars, and the deadline is tomorrow.
STAN
I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle!
KYLE
[opens a book he's carrying and reads] The odds on a single number in roulette are thirty-five to one. [looks up and closes the book] That means, with a ten thousand dollar bet, you win three hundred and fifty thousand.
SHEILA
Boys, that's ridiculous.
STAN
Look, we- we've got nothing to lose.
CHEF
What do you guys think?
JIMBO
It's a long shot.
RANDY
Yeah. [turns around and makes fists with determination] But it's the only shot we've got to save our town.
[Three Feathers Casino, that night. The townsfolk are there once more.]
RUNS WITH PREMISE
[reading from a newspaper] The residents of South Park had hoped to raise three hundred thousand dollars. but in the end managed to raise only ten. The loss of their town may be imminent for the poor people of South Park. [fakes sadness] Awww, I think I'm going to cwy.
TWO ELDERS
HA ha ha ha! HA ha ha ha!
[The doors open and the townsfolk surge in. Randy carries a large amount of yellow chips.]
RANDY
All right, boys. You're gonna have to wait here. [the adults begin to move past the boys]
STAN
Dad. [Randy turns around] Good luck.
RANDY
It's in God's hand now. [turns around and moves forward] Stand aside, everyone! [the adults move towards the roulette table. The Chief notices a change in atmosphere and rises to see what's going on from his office.]
RUNS WITH PREMISE
What are they doing?
RANDY
We're gonna try and beat you at your own game, Chief Runs With Premise! Ten thousand dollars! [sets the yellow chips down] On thirty one black! [moves the chips towards the number. Everyone gasps. The dealer takes the chips and puts them away, substituting some blue chips for the yellow ones.]
RUNS WITH PREMISE
Impossible!
STAN
[begins to wish hard] Come on! Come on! [the dealer starts the wheel and tosses the ball in the opposite direction. Everyone looks on in anticipation. The ball slows down and settles in on thirty one black.]
RUNS WITH PREMISE
Thirty one. Black. [the town erupts with joy]
TOWNSFOLK
Yeah! All right! Woohoo! Oh we did it! We did it! Oh my God! Oh this is amazing!
RUNS WITH PREMISE
No... NOOO! [The boys cheer. Cartman and Kenny hug]
ALEX
South Park is saved. [the dealer adds more blue chips to the amount bet]
MR. MACKEY
We have plenty enough to save our town now!
GERALD
Yeah! But wait. [the rush of winning gets to him] Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. That means if we won again, it will be twelve and a quarter million! [the people gasp a bit at the possibility]
MR. GARRISON
We can save the town and be super-rich!
RANDY
Oh hell yeah! Let it ride!
GERALD
Let it ride!!
TOWNSFOLK
Woohoo! Yeah! [they stay with thirty one black, and the dealer spins again]
KYLE
What the hell are they doing??
JIMBO
Let's go thirty one! Let's see it! [the ball bounces around and settles in on two red.]
ROULETTE DEALER
Two, red. You lose.
TOWNSFOLK
AWWWWWWW!!
RANDY
Dammit!
RUNS WITH PREMISE
[satisfied with this result] Hmmm! [walks off]
STAN
They, they had it! They freakin' had it!
[The road. The Marshes drive home in their car. Randy drives, Sharon sits on the passenger side. Stan sits between Shelly and Grandpa in the back seat.]
STAN
You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some.
RANDY
Stan? Okay? You just don't understand the fine points of gambling. You're never supposed to stop when you're on a winning streak.
STAN
A winning streak??!! You played one game!!!!
RANDY
Stan? Okay?
STAN
What???
RANDY
All right? Stan? Okay?
STAN
You people just got greedy, like the Native Americans! [Randy brakes the car angrily]
RANDY
[menacingly] Hey, mister!! We're not like them, all right?! [turns and faces Stan] Now, we may have pie in the sky dreams once in a while, but we aren't the ones kicking people out of their homes! So don't you compare us to those cold-hearted, money-grubbing, evil stinky Indians! [turns back to the wheel] I'm sorry, Native Americans.
[South Park, next day. A "SOLD" sign is placed above the town sign, indicating that the town, indeed, has been sold. At South Park Elementary, the residents stand in long lines waiting for the checks being offered for their homes.]
ELDER 2
[facing Mr. Garrison] There you are, sir. There's the check for your home. Just sign here, and here.
MR. GARRISON
[signing] Well, this is it, Mr. Slave. We're officially homeless.
MR. SLAVE
[sobbing] Jesus! Jesus Christ!
STAN
[walks up to Randy, who is in line with the others] Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take their dirty money!
RANDY
Stanley, we don't have a choice. The Native Americans own South Park now. We have to take what they'll give us for our homes.
ELDER 3
There you go. Have a nice day. [hands a check to Liane, who turns around and walks off with it]
STAN
[walks with his friends to a clearing where he could be heard] Come on, you guys! This is our town!
MR. MACKEY
It's over, Stanley. What else can we do?
STAN
We can stay. And fight.
CARTMAN
Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts!
KENNY
(Yeah!)
ALEX
Yeah! They don't own our town! We do!
CHEF
I'm sorry, boys. You just don't understand economics.
RANDY
It'll be okay, boys, we'll just... move to the next town over.
STAN
Oh sure. Until the Native Americans decide they want that land, too! What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? We have to stand up to them now! [the adults look back helplessly] Rrrgh! Forget it! Come on, you guys! [the boys leave. Cartman stays behind.]
CARTMAN
You're all a bunch of God-damned pussies! [follows his friends them out. The adults just watch]
[South Park, day. Moments later, a train of bulldozers roll down into town. Runs with Premise, riding on the lead bulldozer, looks happy until he sees the boys standing abreast on the street, blocking the way.]
RUNS WITH PREMISE
Get out of our way.
STAN
No! We won't let you destroy our town!
RUNS WITH PREMISE
Boys. It isn't your town anymore.
STAN
Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chili's. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life.
ELDER 1
Well your way of life is about to change, little boys. Now move! [points the way to the side of the street]
KYLE
You can't just roll into places and take people's lives away!
A DRIVER
And what are four little boys going to do to stop us, huh? [the boys stand unsure, but a sound rises up behind them. Townsfolk appear in mass and walk down the street.]
TOWNSFOLK
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
[Stan looks behind him, smiles, then looks up to his left. People now appear on the roofs of the buildings as well as on the street.]
Searching our hearts for so lohh-oo-ohh-oo-ong
[Stan looks at the roofs on the other side of the street, smiling.]
All of us knowing...
[The boys grin]
Love Is A Battlefield
STAN
This land is not for sale.
RUNS WITH PREMISE
Dammit! I thought you said they were dealt with!
ELDER 1
They were!
MR. GARRISON
Sorry, Charlies! You can just keep your filthy bastard Indian money!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Filthy bastard Native American money!
MR. GARRISON
Uh oh, right, huh. Sorry about that.
RUNS WITH PREMISE
This isn't over! [he and the others get into their bulldozers and pull out of town]
JIMBO
We'll never give up! You bastards!
ALEX
Yeah! South Park is ours.
MR. MACKEY
But, what do we do now? I mean, we can't just stand here and block their way forever.
RANDY
We can stand here as long as it takes. [no one moves. The scene stays for a few seconds, then...]
[Three Feathers Casino, night. Chief Runs with Premise looks over the casino floor from his office.]
RUNS WITH PREMISE
What is the state of our people?
ELDER 2
Last night I spoke with the spirit of the bear, and Bear said that if we do not build our highway soon, our investors may soon sell off their shares of the new casino.
ELDER 1
Yes, and Eagle says the cumulative shared market loss on the revenue of the new casino drops fifteen percent every day.
RUNS WITH PREMISE
Then we must force the South Park people off their petty land.
ELDER 1
But they are determined and proud. And the spirit of the wind has stated that if we use force, it could be a publicity nightmare, further hurting our net assets.
RUNS WITH PREMISE
I already have a plan how we can force them off their land... sneakily. [begins to move off] We're going to give them... [stops in front of a wall] blankets. [three of them are shown]
ELDER 1
Blankets?
RUNS WITH PREMISE
Yes. We will present the blankets as a peace offering. But what the round-eyes will not know is that the blankets are infected with SARS. [his fellow tribespeople look at each other] They will all get SARS! And then SARS will run through their town like a buffalo. Now I need your help getting the SARS onto the blankets. [everyone puts on their little white face masks] Okay, bring them in!
RUNS WITH PREMISE
[The office doors open and several naked Chinese men are brought in] Let's see how South Park deals with this! [he picks up one of the men and rubs him on a blanket. The Chinese man looks at him bewildered] Everyone grab a Chinese person and rub them on a blanket. [other elders pick up the other Chinese them and carry them over to other blankets hanging on the wall] Make sure you rub them all over. Get the SARS nice and deep in there. [the Chinese men grumble at their treatment]
[South Park, next day. The deadline has arrived.]
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing in chilly South Park, Colorado, where the residents are entering the third day of their sit-in to try and stop Native Americans from building a superhighway through their town. The temperature is low, but spirits are pretty low, too. [a Three Casinos Humvee rolls into town and four elders, including Runs with Premise, exit the vehicle]
RANDY
[looking on suspiciously, huddled with his family] What do they want?
MR. GARRISON
We're not moving, ass-faces!
RUNS WITH PREMISE
[walks up to Mr. Garrison with a blanket] Free blanket? [presents it to him] Though I know we have differences, we believe that a compromise can be reached. In the meantime, it hurts us to see you all on television sitting in the cold. Will you not take this offering as a gesture of good-will?
MR. GARRISON
You had me at "free blanket." [Runs with Premise nods and Garrison takes the blanket and opens it. Runs with Premise moves on to other townsfolk and the other elders join in, passing out blankets to the townsfolk.]
ELDERS
Free blanket? Free blanket? Free blanket...
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, it now looks as if the Native Americans are handing out blankets as a sign of good-will towards the South Park people. What an incredible display of compassion. I certainly hope there's nothing sinister behind it.
RUNS WITH PREMISE
[walks up to Randy] Please. As a token of good faith.
RANDY
You... understand if I'm a little wary of trusting you.
RUNS WITH PREMISE
It is only a blanket, Mister Marsh.
RANDY
Well, thanks. [takes the blanket and opens it up. The Chief walks away]
RUNS WITH PREMISE
Oh. You're welcome.
[South Park, day, later. People are anywhere from asleep to sick.]
FIELD REPORTER
[leaning to his left] Tom, it's Tuesday morning now, and the outbreak of SARS in South Park has reached epic proportions. [coughs twice and sniffs] The entire town has been quarantined by the federal government, nobody allowed in our out, which means, nobody can come to our aid. [sniffs twice] It appears this town, and this reporter, are done for. Coming up next, choosing the right hair conditioner. What you don't know about hair care products could be costing you a bundle.
[Randy has taken ill and now lies under a lean-to. Sharon sits on one side of the lean-to, Shelly on the other. Stan walks up to his dad with a can of beer in his hand. Randy coughs.]
STAN
It's all right, dad.
RANDY
How's your... mother?
STAN
[looks over] She's hanging in there. [looks at Randy again] Here, drink some beer. [Randy turns his head aside a bit so he can take a sip, then resets his head]
RANDY
It's cool on my tongue.
STAN
You're gonna be all right.
RANDY
Stanley, listen to me. I have SARS. There's only a ninety-eight percent chance that I will live.
STAN
No, Dad, NO.
RANDY
Listen, Stan. SARS is destroying our people. The Native Americans put it in the blankets they gave us. [coughs and sniffs] Soon there will be only ninety-eight percent of us left. [runs out of air, then turns aside and breathes in. His voice turns raspy]
STAN
What can I do?
RANDY
You... must find a cure for SARS, son. And save our people.
STAN
Cure SARS? Aw, Jesus!
RANDY
The spirit of middle-class white people is strong in you, son. Seek out the wise man in Bellow Creek. Now go. GO! [Stan steps away, then runs. Randy relaxes and lays down]
[Bellocreek Trailer Park. Stan approaches it and enters. He walks up to a trailer and knocks on the door.]
WISE MAN
[answers the door] What?
STAN
Hey, my name's Stan, and I was-
WISE MAN
Your coming was foretold to me. You've come to save our people. Come in. [steps aside and Stan enters] Watch the cats.
STAN
Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS?
WISE MAN
Me?? Huh, no. I am just a guide. Sit down.
[[Stan sits down on a bucket seat from a car. Beer bottles litter the trailer floor. The walls are dingy. An open doorway reveals the man's bedroom, which shows a cross hanging on the opposite wall. A poster of a swimsuit model posing on a car hangs on the living room wall. The man sits on the couch].]
WISE MAN
You must find the answer yourself, by taking an inward journey. [picks up a can of paint thinner and pours it into a brown paper bag]
STAN
An inward journey? That sounds kinda gay.
WISE MAN
Let the voices of our ancestors show you the way. [offers the bag to Stan] Breathe. Breathe from the bag of visions. [Stan takes the bag, looks at it, then takes a deep breath from it]
STAN
[disgusted] Ah! Oh, dude!
[Three Feathers Casino, night. Chief Runs with Premise holds a meeting in his second-story office.]
RUNS WITH PREMISE
How much longer must we wait for our superhighway??
ELDER 1
SARS has spread throughout the entire town of South Park, Chief Runs with Premise. Their wills will break soon.
RUNS WITH PREMISE
Then I suppose we must be patient.
WOMAN
Runs with Premise, come quickly!
RUNS WITH PREMISE
What is the matter, wife?
WOMAN
It is our son, Premise Running Thin. He is very sick.
[Premise Running Thin's bedroom. He's in bed, wearing a headband with a feather attached to it. His parents approach.]
RUNS WITH PREMISE
Premise Running Thin, what is the matter?
WOMAN
He, he shared a cup with one of the people from China. He has SARS!
RUNS WITH PREMISE
No! I told you not to touch them!
PREMISE RUNNING THIN
Papa. Papa...
MEDICINE MAN
[wearing a wolf skin over his head and back] I have given him herbs from the desert plant and water from the cactus of life. But nothing seems to be working.
RUNS WITH PREMISE
This would not have happened if those townspeople would have just moved away! No more waiting around! Tomorrow we begin the final stage of our plan! Shock and Awe!
[South Park, next day. The townspeople are still sick. Stan runs up to Randy.]
STAN
Dad! Dad!
RANDY
Stanley. Did you have an inward journey with the old man? Did you have a vision??
STAN
Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS. [reaches into the bag and pulls out each item as he names it] Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite.
RANDY
Yes. Yes, of course. Quickly, Stan, we must give it to everyone! [a few hours later, everyone is standing around enjoying the soup, soda, and medicine prescribed, and chatting]
KYLE
Boy, that really did the trick, Stan. I thought we were kind of, sort of, not really done for.
ALEX
Thanks to you, we're all safe now, Stan.
[In the distance the bulldozers return and a yell is heard. As the bulldozers draw near, Chief Runs with Premise is seen standing on the running board of the lead bulldozer.]
RUNS WITH PREMISE
Now, I will blow your weak, SARS-infested bodies off the Earth! [the townsfolk look at the coming vehicles and slowly close ranks] What the? [thinks quickly] Wait a minute. [to his men] Stop! Stop! [hops off the bulldozer and walks up to the people] Your, your SARS. Where did it go?
RANDY
We have cured ourselves using the medicines of our culture.
RUNS WITH PREMISE
My son... Premise Running Thin has the SARS as well. [makes a truce sign with his hands] You... you can cure him?
[Three Feathers Casino, upstairs. Premise Running Thin sits in bed sipping his soup. A can of Sprite and some Dayquil are on his tray. Around his bed are the Three Feathers tribe on one side, the South Park residents on the other.]
ELDER 1
It is amazing. All our plants and herbs failed to heal him.
ELDER 2
But your people's remedy brings the spirit of the buffalo back into his heart. Perhaps there are many things we can learn from your way of life.
RANDY
We're a simple people. All we want is to be allowed to live our lives.
RUNS WITH PREMISE
You have cured Premise Running Thin. In return, I shall give you all five dollars credit at the casino. [his wife nudges him with her elbow a few times and he gets irritated] All right, all right, I will not build a superhighway through your town. And you can all have your homes back.
TOWNSFOLK
All right! Yeah! [townspeople jump and cheer. Sheila and Gerald hug each other.] Woohoo!
ALEX
Well, I guess we all learned that South Park is more than just a town. It's a community that nobody can split up.
STAN
Dude, who the hell are you?
ALEX
Alex. Alex Glick. I got to come on and do the guest voice thingy.
KYLE
What?! Get the hell out of here!
ALEX
Hi Mom! Hi Dad! Hi Jill!
End of Red Man's Greed

synopsis:The town of South Park celebrates the new, hip metro-sexual craze.

script:South Park is Gay!

[South Park, school bus stop, morning. Stan, Cartman and Kenny wait for the bus. Stan is dressed in fishnet tank top, artsy pants, and a new, furry cap with the same colors as his old one. Cartman is dressed in a Madonna fashion shirt and artsy pants. His hair is tussled and brighter than usual. Kenny is dressed in a purple parka with light purple sleeves. A lock of his hair peeks out from under the hood.]
STAN
Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night.
CARTMAN
What? Tell us?
STAN
So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top.
CARTMAN
Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ever!
STAN
I know!
KENNY
(I just LOVE this jacket 'cause it's SOOO beautiful!)
STAN
Oh, tell me about it, Ken doll.
KYLE
[joins them, but dressed as usual] Hey dudes. [the others glance at him]
CARTMAN
[begins to laugh at him] What a dork!
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall! [laughs heartily]
KYLE
Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear.
STAN
You've gotta get with the times, girlfriend.
CARTMAN
Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th. [Stan inspects Kyle's jacket]
STAN
Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??
CARTMAN
We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys.
KENNY
(That's the truth.)
STAN
Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover! [the boys excitedly pull Kyle along to South Park Mall]
[Montage]
SINGERS (WIDELIFE)
You... came into my life... and my world never looked so bright. Yeah.
It's true. You bring out the best in me.
When you are around, when you are around, all things just keep getting better.
It keeps getting better. Life keeps getting better and better (All things just keep getting better).
[The Broflovski house. Gerald and Sheila watch TV from their couch]
ANNOUNCER
Coming up on HBC, it's Queer Eye for the Straight Guy!
CARSON
[a shot of Queer Eye...] We have got to get you some tighter-fitting shirts!
ANNOUNCER
[the night's schedule pops up over the scene] Then it's Boy Meets Boy, followed by Will and Grace, and then, the Love Boat... with Men.
SHEILA
My goodness, there certainly are a lot of gay shows on television these days.
GERALD
Yeah. I think it's great that gays are finally being so accepted. [the door opens and the four newly-clothed boys enter]
KYLE
[waves] Hi Mom, Hi Dad!
GERALD
[looks and screams, then walks over to Kyle] Kyle! What's happened to you??
KYLE
I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen! [leads the others boys out of the living room]
GERALD
Oh my God! Come on, Sheila! [she rises] We'd better go tell the other parents what's going on!! [they leave.]
[The Marsh house. Gerald is pounding on the front door and Sharon answers.]
SHARON
Oh hi Gerald, Sheila.
GERALD
Hi Sharon. Uh, we need to talk to you about the boys.
SHARON
Sure. Come on in. The guys are all watching TV.
GERALD
Oh, is the game on or something? [they move towards the sofa, where a bunch of the men are watching]
RANDY
[moves over to Gerald and hugs him] Heeey Geraaald! How are youuuu!! [the other men greet him as well]
OTHER MEN
Geraaald! Hi Gerald.
STUART
Sit down, Jer-Jer! Queer Eye For the Straight Guy is on.
GERALD
Oh no! Y-you guys all turned gay too?? [the other men laugh]
RANDY
Not gay, Gerald, metrosexual.
GERALD
What's that?
SKEETER
Just because a guy cares about how he looks and is in touch with his feminine side doesn't mean he's gay anymore.
STUART
Yeah. Metrosexual means you're straight, but you appreciate the gay culture.
RANDY
It's super-fabulous. Would you like some shirazz?
[The ladies look on from the kitchen.]
SHARON
Don't our men look
LINDA
Haven't you seen Queer Eye For the Straight Guy, Sheila? These five gay men go around and show straight men how to better themselves. It's the best.
SHEILA
It is?
SHARON
Well sure, Sheila. Our husbands are all so clean and neat. My Randy irons his clothes and even has pedicures.
LINDA
And they like to talk about their feeling now and drink wine and decorate the house.
SARAH
My Steven shaved his chest and his balls. Oooh, I love it!
SHARON
And how about our boys, huh? Ever since gay culture became cool, our boys bathe every night and brush their teeth three times a day. This is the greatest thing ever.
SHEILA
I don't know. Sometimes boys take cultural fads too far...
[South Park, day. The boys go to school in their new threads. They stop at the main entrance.]
STAN
Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look!
CARTMAN
That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us.
KENNY
(Woohoo!!)
STAN
All right. Let's work it! [shimmies a bit. The boys turn and pass through the entrance, but stop in their tracks.] What the...?
BUTTERS
Tootaloo, Connor. See ya after classes.
CONNOR
Okay, sweetums. [they part ways. Butters goes off to his right. Farther away, near the drinking fountains, stand Timmy, Jimmy, Kevin, and Pip]
CLYDE
Oh my God, where is my homework?! I am freaking out! [turns right and follows after Butters. The boys look on in stunned silence]
A BOY
Hey dudes. [the boys look and it's Craig with Tolkien, Jason, and Tweek]
STAN
Hey Craig.
CRAIG
You guys look pretty gay.
KYLE
[happily] Thanks.
CRAIG
[him and his group are not happy about it] Not as gay as us, though.
CARTMAN
[moves in front of Kyle] Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you!
CRAIG
Oh yeah?! We're super duper triple-dog gay!
CARTMAN
Oh yeah?! We're all ultra super stamp it stamp it no erasies mega gay!
CHEF
[arrives] What's all this fightin' about, children?!
STAN
These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us!
CHEF
Aw nah. Don't tell me you children have taken up this whole metrosexual fad, too.
STAN
Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are!
CHEF
No it isn't. Last year you children were all trying to be black, and now you're trying to be gay!
STAN
We're metrosexual!!
CRAIG
Maybe. But you'll never be as metrosexual as us! Come on, fags! [snaps his fingers and his group follows him away]
CARTMAN
GOD I HATE CRAIG!! [Stan and Kenny turn to leave] That son of a... djah!! [leaves. Kyle turns to leave, but has second thoughts.]
KYLE
Chef, I don't feel very metrosexual.
CHEF
Well, then, don't buy into this fad, Kyle. Be who you are, not what's cool.
[Mr. Garrison's class, next day. He enters. On the blackboard are two math problems: one addition, one subtraction.]
MR. GARRISON
All right children, let's take our seats.
CLASS
[in unison] Good morning Mr. Garrison. [their dulcet tones get his attention, and he turns around]
MR. GARRISON
Well, uh d-don't you all look nice.
TIMMY
[responds, gestures gaily with his hands] Oooo, Timmy. [the door opens and Kyle enters. A closeup of the boys as Kyle goes to his seat]
STAN
Dude! W-what are you doing?
KYLE
I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me.
CRAIG
HA! Told you you guys were straight!
STAN
We're not straight! You're straight!
JASON, CRAIG, TWEEK, TOLKIEN
You're straight!
CARTMAN
You're straight like a freeway!
MR. GARRISON
What the hell is going on??
CARTMAN
You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!!
CRAIG
I'm not just gay, I'm a catamite. [Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny stay silent, looking at each other]
CARTMAN
...So? I'm half bisexual!
MR. GARRISON
Oh, stop it!! You kids don't even know what you're talking about!! Eric, you're not half-bi!!
CARTMAN
I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi.
MR. GARRISON
WHAT??
[Nighttime. Mr. Garrison and Mr. Slave walk down the street.]
MR. GARRISON
It was the craziest thing I've ever seen, Mr. Slave. All the children were suddenly acting like being gay was cool. I mean, maybe we're not the only gay couple in town anymore. [they cross the cross street and enter the bar at the corner]
MR. SLAVE
Oh, Jesus Christ.
[The bar, inside. Disco music is playing. Mr. Garrison looks in awe at the metrosexuals now milling about.]
MR. GARRISON
Look at that, Mr. Slave. [a pan shot of the people there. He puts his hands over his mouth] Our cup runneth over.
MR. SLAVE
[puts his right hand over his mouth] Jesus Christ.
JIMBO
[standing with Ned at the bar] Mr. Garrison, those are great pants.
MR. GARRISON
Thanks, Jimbo. I really like your outfit, too. [cuddles up to him] Soho... so Jimbo, you... wanna come back to my place with me and Mr. Slave?
JIMBO
Uh, for what?
MR. GARRISON
Well, you know...
JIMBO
No.
MR. GARRISON
Huh.
RANDY
Mr. Garrison! [Garrison and Slave walk over] Hey doll.
MR. GARRISON
Oh hey Randy.
RANDY
You're looking ultra-fabulous.
MR. GARRISON
Well thanks. You too. [leans in a bit] So uh, Randy, you want me to give you a hand job in the bathroom?
RANDY
[turns his back to Mr. Garrison and walks away] Nuno, thanks, I'm, I'm not like that.
MR. GARRISON
Not, not like that?
RICHARD
[approaches, carries some glasses of wine] How about some shirazz, guys? [Garrison and Slave each take a glass]
MR. GARRISON
Uh-Oh, thanks, Mr. Tweek.
RICHARD
My pleasure, silly-buns.
MR. GARRISON
Oh, wuh, well uh, Mr. Tweek, why don't we uh, go back to my place.
RICHARD
Why?
MR. GARRISON
Well, you know, I was just thinking we could... put on some music and watch videos and pound Mr. Slave's tight little ass.
MR. SLAVE
Woohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ.
RICHARD
Wohohoho, goodness no. I, I'm straight.
MR. GARRISON
Straight? Bu-uh, Oh what... Jesus, what the hell is goin' on here?!
PATRONS
Huh?
MR. GARRISON
Why won't anybody pound Mr. Slave's butt?!
RANDY
Well, we don't "pound butt," Mr. Garrison, we're straight.
MR. GARRISON
Those pants and those shoes say you pound butt!!
JIMBO
Hey, now that's not true. My shoes don't say I pound butt.
MR. GARRISON
No, your shoes say you take it in the butt!!
SKEETER
So, Mr. Garrison. We learned that gays are totally cool. You're just one of us now.
PATRONS
Yeah.
MR. GARRISON
One of you?! [throws his glass down] We've spent our whole lives tryin' NOT to be one of you! You can't do this to us!!
[South Park Elementary, playground, day.]
CARTMAN
Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp.
STAN
Wow, is that from Origins?
CARTMAN
Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that-
KYLE
[approaches with a football] Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around?
CARTMAN
Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second? [pulls Stan and Kenny away from Kyle] Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay? And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle.
STAN
Well, what can we do about it?
CARTMAN
We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle.
STAN
What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.
CARTMAN
Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore.
STAN
Yeah. Wait, what?
CARTMAN
You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy.
CRAIG
[approaches with his friends] Hey, butch boy. Nice football you got there. [they laugh at him]
TOLKIEN
When was the last time you had a manicure, straight man? [Kyle picks up his football]
JASON
Yeah, let's see that hair. [lifts up Kyle's hat] Look, he's not even using any product! [he and the others laugh at him. Other boys gather in and join in the laughter]
STAN
[returns with Cartman and Kenny] Hey, what's goin' on?
CRAIG
Oh, here come the butch boys to help their butchy little friend!
CARTMAN
He's not our friend. [Stan's jaw drops a bit. Cartman looks at Stan and walks away. Kenny follows]
KYLE
Stan? [Stan looks at Kyle, sighs, and walks away]
JASON
[shoves Kyle a bit] This playground is for metrosexuals, macho man!
CRAIG
Take your non-flaming ass to some other school! [the other boys gather round Kyle and gang up on him]
KYLE
No! Ah!
[South Park sign, now with a bed of flowers under it.]
[The Broflovski house. Kyle returns with bruises all over his body. His mom is dusting.]
SHEILA
[sees him and drops her duster to kneel next to him] Kyle! What happened to you?!
KYLE
[sniffs] I got beat up at school... for being different.
SHEILA
WHAT?? Your classmates beat you up for being a Jew?
KYLE
No! For not being a metrosexual.
SHEILA
Gerald! Gerald, get down here!
GERALD
[upstairs. Disco music plays] Here I come! [dances down the stairs, then moonwalks right back up, then strikes a pose.]
KYLE
Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too?
GERALD
Kyle! You look terrible! [walks down and approaches him]
SHEILA
The boys at school beat him up, Gerald.
GERALD
Oh, really?! Well, don't you worry, Kyle. We can cover that black eye up with some cream base, and the coat and pants we'll bleach with an acid wash for a fun vintage look.
KYLE
Gah! Just leave me alone! [walks away and passes the TV]
A VOICE
There you go! Now you look fabulous.
KYAN
You see that? A spray-on tan does wonders for your look.
KYLE
GRRRRR!!
THOM
Now let's get down to the tango class and learn some new steps. [the straight man smiles]
KYLE
That does it! I know what I have to do! [walks off]
[Chef's house, day. Mr. Garrison rings the bell.]
CHEF
Oh, hello, Mr. Garrison.
MR. GARRISON
[sadly] Chef, can I talk to you?
CHEF
Sure. Come on in.
MR. GARRISON
Thanks. Come, Slave. [yanks Mr. Slave in by a leash around his neck. Both men sit on Chef's couch. Mr. Slave buries his face in his hands] Oh, it's just awful, Chef! I used to feel like an outsider, a totally different person who stood out in this town! Now every straight guy is acting gayer than me!
MR. SLAVE
[sobs] Oh Jesus! Jesus Christ!
CHEF
Well, what do you want me to do about it?
MR. GARRISON
Chef, what did you do when white people stole your culture?
CHEF
Oh. Well, we black people just always tried to stay out in front of them.
MR. SLAVE
[straightens up] How did you do that?
CHEF
Well, like with our slang. Black people always used to say, "I'm in the house" instead of "I'm here." But then white people all started to say "in the house" so we switched it to "in the hizzouse." Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then white folk started saying that, and we had to change it to hizzie, then "in the hizzle" which we had to change to "hizzle fo shizzle," and now, because white people say "hizzle fo shizzle," we have to say "flippity floppity floop."
MR. GARRISON
[slumps forward] We don't have time for all that, Chef! Oh, if only those Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people understood what they were doing. [thinks] Wait. [rises] That's it! I know exactly what to do! [yanks on Mr. Slave's leash] Come on, Mr. Slave! Let's get back to our flippity floppity floop. [exits the front door with Mr. Slave]
CHEF
Oh no! Damnit! Don't call it that! [the door closes]
[South Park Train Station. Kyle approaches a ticket booth.]
KYLE
One ticket to New York, please.
CLERK
[handing a ticket over] You're going to New York alone?
KYLE
I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people.
CLERK
Oooo, great idea! They can help you with those dated clothes.
KYLE
Mrrh.
[Kyle walks away, then unsheathed a sharp knife. He enters the train. Inside, he walks down the aisle until he sees a bench. He hops onto it and sits down. A few seconds later, he notices the two men to his left, then looks up in recognition: they are Mr. Garrison and Mr. Slave. Mr. Garrison is carrying his own knife.]
KYLE
Mr. Garrison?
MR. GARRISON
Kyle, what are you doing here?
KYLE
I'm going to New York to kill the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people!
MR. GARRISON
What?? That's what I'm doing!
KYLE
Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!
MR. GARRISON
They took gay culture from real gays and their asses are ours!
KYLE
I thought of it first!
MR. GARRISON
No you didn't! No you didn't!
KYLE
Did so! Did so!
MR. GARRISON
I thought of it yesterday!
KYLE
I thought of it two days ago!
MR. GARRISON
I thought of it before you were born!
MR. SLAVE
Stop it, you two! Stop it! Don't you see how crazy this is?
MR. GARRISON
Oh. [sigh] You're right, Mr. Slave. We can both kill them together.
KYLE
Cool.
[South Park Mall, day. The boys are at a clothing store.]
STAN
Wow, we look great!
CARTMAN
Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now.
RANDY
Boys! Boys! Come on! There's a sale down in Express for Men! [leaves. The boys follow him out. Randy calls out to the other men in the mall] Hey guys! There's a sale in Express for Men! [their wives sit on benches in the center of the mall with nothing to do]
RICHARD
Oh my God!
MAN
Let's go! Let's go!
RYAN
[walking down the far side of the mall] You guys have got to see these shoes I bought!
GERALD
Hurry, you guys! The mall closes in seven hours!
JIMBO
Oh, why can't we all live at the mall?!
SHARON
You know, I'm starting to think this whole metrosexual thing isn't so great.
LINDA
I know what you mean. All my husband ever does now is look at himself in the mirror. He cares more about how he looks than how I look.
MRS. TWEEK
I hope something happens soon to put an end to this whole fad.
[HBC Television Headquarters, New York. The head of programming is with the Queer Eye guys.]
HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
Guys, you've done a terrific job. Queer Eye For the Straight Guy is our number one show! [the guys cheer]
CARSON
What can I say? We're fabulous.
HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
You guys are changing the world! And tomorrow, we're gonna have you make over the President of the United States!
JAI
Oh my God, I think I'm gonna faint. [a knock is heard at the door, then it opens]
MR. GARRISON
Room service. [a service cart rolls in]
HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
What? We didn't order any room service.
MR. GARRISON
Oh, well, the woman at the front desk sent it up.
HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
Carol? [lifts the platter's lid for a brief peek, then lowers it] Well, I'll have to check on this. Excuse me a minute, fellas. [leaves. Mr. Garrison continues inside the office when the coast is clear. He takes the cart to the desk and parks it there. Kyle pops out and rushes to lock the door]
KYLE
Clear!
MR. GARRISON
[whips out his walkie-talkie and speaks into it] Okay, Mr. Slave! [From a nearby building Mr. Slave swings down like Spiderman and crashes through the window, but passes out on impact. His body collapses on the floor]
MR. SLAVE
Unh, Jesus [a chunk of window falls onto his ass] Christ.
MR. GARRISON
Well crap, that didn't work.
[South Park Mall, day. Stan and his group face off against Craig and his group at the center of the mall.]
STAN
You'd better shut up, Craig.
CRAIG
Everyone knows it's true!
STAN
It is not!
CRAIG
Is so!
TOM
Craig! Behave yourself!
RANDY
Yeah, Stanley. What are you fighting about?
STAN
Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you!
RANDY
What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about.
TOM
Yeah. Everyone already knows I dress better than Randy.
RANDY
Oh really?!
TOM
I mean, you do have the fashion sense of a Japanese woman.
MEN
Ooooo.
RANDY
Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare.
OTHER MEN
Oh no, errrr!
SHARON
Oh, stop it! Will you all just stop it?! [the men fall silent] Look, you guys are carrying this fad too far! Will you please stop acting this way?!
TOM
You don't... like us being metrosexual?
THE WOMEN
NO!
RANDY
Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic!
THE MALES
Yeah!!
LINDA
What?
JIMBO
We shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves, we should be uniting against metrophobes like these!
SHARON
This is crazy!
RANDY
[steps forward, past the boys] Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us what you want. But us metros are real people, just like you!
TOM
[steps forward, past the boys] You can metrobash us all you want, but we're here to stay!
CRAIG
[steps forward, past his father] Yeah Mom! We're proud of who we are.
CARTMAN
[steps forward] That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade.
RYAN
Great idea, Eric! Raise metrosexual awareness!
STUART
We can make floats and decorate them with streamers and flowers!
KENNY
(Woohoohoo!)
RANDY
Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and into the streets!
THE MALES
Out of the malls and into the streets! Out of the malls and into the streets! Out of the malls and into the streets!
MRS. TWEEK
What the hell did that show do to them?
[HBC Television Headquarters, New York. Police have been called in and have apprehended Mr. Garrison, Mr. Slave, and Kyle.]
OFFICER
You sure you don't want to press charges?
KYAN
That's okay, officer. I think they learned murder is wrong.
CARSON
Especially in those pants.
MR. GARRISON
[the cops leave] Look, guys, we're sorry we tried to murder you, but... You have to stop what you're doing!
JAI
Are you crazy?! We're the hottest thing on TV!
MR. GARRISON
But don't you see the price? You're selling out your own kind. Look, us gays have created a lifestyle, a, a culture that is uniquely ours. If we keep trying to make straight people into us, well, we're gonna have no identity left.
KYAN
Sorry Charlie, no sale. [he and the others turn and walk away]
MR. GARRISON
Buh... but... this doesn't make sense! [grabs his head] How can gay men do this to their own people?? [the Queer Eye guys reach the exit] Unless... you're not gay at all... [the guys stop, turn around, look at Garrison angrily, then return]
THOM
You just had to push it, didn't you?!
JAI
Just had to keep asking question!
CARSON
[locks the exit] Now you know the truth!
KYLE
They aren't gay? Then what are they?
KYAN
For a thousand years our kind have lived beneath the earth's crust! Banished by man in the Kindling Wars.
MR. GARRISON
Oh my God. [Kyan steps forward and begins to crumble. A walking crab pops out]
LEADER
We are the Crab People!
KYLE
AAAAAAAAAAAAH!
MR. SLAVE
Jesus Christ!
THE QUEER EYE GUYS
[they too crumble and advance] Crab People! Crab People! Crab People!
[A subterranean cave. The crab people lead their hostages to their camp.]
CRAB PEOPLE
Crab People! Crab People! Crab People!.
CRAB LEADER
[entirely red] See now where we have been forced to live for a thousand years! But soon we shall rule the land above, and mankind will be gone!
MR. GARRISON
Gone?? ["Crab People! Crab People!"]
CRAB MAN 2
Crab people are too small and weak to take over man by force, and so we came up with our perfect plan! [another crab person walks over to a closet full of human shells, all of them replicas of the Queer Eye guys. The crab person climbs in a Carson replica and closes the shell behind him. Carson's replica comes to life]
CARSON REPLICA
If you can't beat man, [drops down from his hook] change man!
MR. GARRISON
I knew it! I knew gay people would never do this to their own kind! [some crab people restrain him and Mr. Slave]
CRAB LEADER
When all the world is metrosexual, the crab people shall finally reign supreme!! [raises his pincers and claps. The other crab people join him and clap]
CRAB PEOPLE
Crab People! Crab People!
CRAB SOLO
Taste like crab, talk like people.
CRAB PEOPLE
Crab People!
KYLE
You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy!
CRAB MAN 2
[approaches] Very well. If we can't make you into metrosexuals, then we will make you into crab people! Take them!! [the crab people swarm in and separate the hostages. Some of them take Kyle into Crabwear and select a crab outfit for him to wear. Then they take him to Crab Salon and put antennae on his hat, then they take him to get a facial, then they march him down the underground road]
SINGERS
(CRAB PEOPLE)
All things just keep getting better
You... came into my life
(Crab People)
and my world never looked so bright. Yeah.
(Crab People)
It's true. You bring out the best in me.
(Crab People)
When you are around, when you are around,
(Crab People)
All things just keep getting better.
(Crab People)
[South Park, day. A Metrosexual Pride Parade moves down the street in the background, and News 4 is covering it.]
REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where the first Metrosexual Pride Parade is underway! [in a rainbow peacock float Randy, Jimbo, Skeeter and Stuart ride and cheer. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny ride in a banana float which features an ocean wave and a palm tree. On the tree waves a rainbow flag that says "Here to Stay"
THE BOYS
We're here! [clap clap]
We're not queer! [clap clap]
But we're close! [clap clap]
Get used to it!
We're here! [clap clap]
We're not queer! [clap clap]
But we're close! [clap clap]
Get used to it!
SHARON
[as the boys' voices fade away] That does it! I can't take it anymore!
THE BOYS
We're here! [clap clap]
We're not queer! [clap clap]
But we're close! [clap clap]
Get used to it!
LINDA
I should have never wished for a cleaner, neater husband.
SHARON
Ladies, get your things! I know what we have to do! [leads the ladies away. Randy's float hits a pothole and veers to the right. It hits the sushi restaurant as the spectators back away quickly]
JIMBO
Whoa, look out! [the float hits the building and breaks a window. A small fire is heard]
RANDY
Oh my God, it's on fire! [the men jump out of the float and run to the other side of the street]
SKEETER
Put it out! Put it out!
RANDY
I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants!
SKEETER
The heat could really damage our hair. We'd better let the police handle this!
OFFICER BARBRADY
[seated on his patrol car, buffing his nails] Are you crazy? I just had my uniform pressed!
JIMBO
[the float and building are now fully engulfed in flames] Oh Jesus, it's burning! Oh my God!
SKEETER
Eeeek!
RANDY
Put it out! Put it out! Fire!
[HBC Headquarters, New York. The Queer Eye guys work on President Bush on their show.]
CARSON
Mr. President, it is such an honor to make you over!
KYAN
Now, we've got to do something with your hair.
THOM
And your nails are filthy. Let's get those clean.
HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
This is gay gold! [Mr. Garrison, Mr. Slave, and Kyle look down from the sound booth]
MR. GARRISON
Stop them! They're crab people!
CRAB MAN 3
They cannot see or hear us, foolish man. Now stand by and watch as your pitiful race becomes helpless!!
CARSON
That is very good, Mr. President. Now, put on this silk jacket. [Kyan, Jai, and Thom remove the President's coat and Carson hands him the jacket]
KYLE
No Mr. President!! Don't do it! [the crab man holding him quickly covers his mouth] Help!
MR. GARRISON
You bastards!
KYAN
That looks great! Now, how about some moisturizer. [Bush and the guys smile. The studio door bursts open and the women flood into the studio wielding bats]
SHARON
There they are! Get 'em!
KYAN
What? [their smiles vanish]
LINDA
You turned our husbands into whiny little wusses!!
SARAH
It's payback time! [the women rush in and start beating up the Queer Eye guys]
HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
Oh my God, what are they doing?!
CRAB MAN 3
Oh noooo!! [Mr. Garrison and Mr. Slave react and crack the crab people in two in the booth as the women finish Queer Eye guys off below]
HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
[kneeling at the corpses of Carson and Kyan] Wha? What have you done?
SHARON
We're sorry, but we didn't have a choice. You see, at first we liked having our men be clean and neat. We thought that having them use product in their hair and wanting facials would make them sexier. But it doesn't.
LINDA
That's right. Event though my Steven sickens me out sometimes, it's his rugged manly grossness that I'm attracted to.
SARAH
We're sorry, but we knew that the only answer was tuh kill the Queer Eye guys.
HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
Well you're going to jail for thi-! [Kyan's body begins to move, and the HoP looks down] Wait a minute. [a crab man crawls out] What is that?
CRAB LEADER
No! Our evil plans! Noooo... [dies]
HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
Oh my God. They were crab people.
MR. GARRISON
[enters the studio with Slave and Kyle in tow] Yes! They were trying to systematically make men into wusses so they could take over the world!
KYLE
Mom!
SHEILA
Kyle!
HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
I should have known they were crab people. They tried this before with The Jeffersons.
MR. GARRISON
So now, can you please change your network's programming?
HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
Yes. Yes, I think this gay fad is over. Gentlemen, back to Studio 12! We're gonna bring back the Latin fad.
[South Park. The sign has been redrawn with a barrio graffiti font.]
[The McCormick house, day. Randy, Jimbo, Skeeter, and Stuart are now dressed as cholos on the porch. Two six-packs of Coronas are on the ground. Some of the bottles are already empty.]
RANDY
Hey eses.
STUART
Hey hefe. You want some cerveza? [hands Randy a beer.]
[South Park Elementary, day. Kyle walks into view in the school hall.]
STAN
Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us?
KYLE
What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?
STAN
Yeah. It's cool, holmes.
KYLE
No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened?
STAN
Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us. [turns and walks away]
CARTMAN
Yeah, don't be such a fag, dude! [turns and walks away. Kenny just looks at him and walks off. Kyle looks away, then back at the boys, then walks away in the opposite direction. He stops, thinks for a while, then turns around and hurries to them]
KYLE
God-damnit!
End of South Park is Gay!


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:When the other boys kick Cartman out of their band, he pulls his own group together to make music for Jesus.

script:Christian Rock Hard

[Stan and the boys are in the Marsh garage belting out tunes, but their musical styles are scattered. Cartman sings lead, Stan and Kyle on are guitars, Kenny is on the drums.]
CARTMAN
God dammit! [hangs his head and lets the mic stand fall into his left hand. All stop playing and the side door opens]
RANDY
[looks in] Stan, are you okay?
STAN
Yeah, dad. We're just rehearsing our band. [Cartman straightens up]
RANDY
Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths. [steps back and closes the door]
CARTMAN
[cackling] Heheheheheh heheheheheh.
KYLE
He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz.
KENNY
(What? Is it?)
STAN
Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented. [Cartman paces the floor with arms behind his back]
KYLE
I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.
CARTMAN
[stops] Inspiration. Wait a minute, [turns right and walks away from them] that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see?
STAN
See what?
CARTMAN
[turns around] Our band should play Christian rock! [beams with pride]
KYLE
Christian rock?!
CARTMAN
[races back to the band] Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap!
KYLE
That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
CARTMAN
[protests, takes a step towards Kyle] It worked for Creed!
STAN
I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band!
CARTMAN
[steps towards Stan] You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius!
KYLE
[pointing to an exit] Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!
CARTMAN
Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do!
KYLE
You're on, fat boy!
CARTMAN
Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go! [runs out as fast as his fat little body will let him, and pants]
KYLE
[after a few seconds of watching the door] What a stupid asshole!
[The neighborhood, day. Cartman runs through the streets. He appears over a rise on one of the streets.]
CARTMAN
Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle! [runs up to a house and pounds on the front door. The door opens up and it's Butters who answers]
BUTTERS
Oh, hi Eric.
CARTMAN
Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters! [dashes off]
BUTTERS
[watching Cartman run off] ...Ohhh!
[Tolkien's mansion. Cartman runs up to the front door.]
CARTMAN
No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle! [pounds on the door and Tolkien answers] Tolkien! Get the bass guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house! [turns around and dashes off]
TOLKIEN
What?! We don't have a bass guitar.
CARTMAN
[spins around] Your family's black, Tolkien! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere! [runs off. Tolkien gets annoyed and shuts the door]
[Cartman's house. He and Butters are in the living room. Cartman is at the piano, Butters is on drums.]
BUTTERS
Whoa, you sure seem with it, Eric. You must have some... inspiration.
CARTMAN
Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me. [makes changes to the sheet music on the piano's sheet music holder]
TOLKIEN
[arrives with a bass and a small amplifier] Hey, there was a bass guitar in my basement.
CARTMAN
I told you, Tolkien.
TOLKIEN
So, what are we doing?
CARTMAN
Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives.
BUTTERS
Wow!
CARTMAN
We are going to start... a Christian rock band.
BUTTERS
[his smile vanishes and he slumps in his chair] Awww.
TOLKIEN
[moves towards the front door] I'm out. [picks up his amp]
CARTMAN
Wait! [Tolkien stops, Cartman rushes over] Walk out that door, Tolkien, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be- [points to Butters]
BUTTERS
Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars.
CARTMAN
Still want to leave, Tolkien? [Tolkien thinks a bit, then resumes his place] Thank you.
[The Broflovski house, living room. Gerald and Sheila are on the sofa. Gerald reads a book, Sheila is knitting.]
KYLE
[enters and stands before them] Dad, can I borrow three hundred dollars?
GERALD
Three hundred dollars?? What in the world for??
KYLE
Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.
GERALD
Sorry Kyle, we gave you your allowance already.
KYLE
Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!
GERALD
It wasn't your life yesterday. [resumes reading]
KYLE
Hold it. [plaintive] Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops.
GERALD
The answer is no, Kyle.
KYLE
Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!
SHEILA
Kyle, don't belittle your own people!
KYLE
[turns and walks off in frustration] Aaaargh! [heads for the front door and opens it. Stan and Kenny approach the entrance. It's night out.]
STAN
Hey dude.
KYLE
It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs!
STAN
No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet!
KYLE
Really?
KENNY
(Yeah!)
STAN
You got a computer?
[Stan's Dad's den, moments later. The boys are at the computer. Stan works the keyboard as Kyle and Kenny watch.]
STAN
See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer!
KYLE
All right, cool. [takes over] Let's download some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder. [with each name, he clicks on some songs and a download indicator shows download progress for each one. It's an extremely fast connection]
KENNY
(Oh you forgot to get some Judas Priest.)
STAN
Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too.
KYLE
[types in the search box] Judas Priest. [a two-tone bell sound indicates a successful download] Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome! [immediately, helicopters are heard coming and the light outside turns bright white. A night sun hovers overhead and stops at a position in which the helicopter pilots can see inside the den. Police sirens are then heard]
STAN
What the hell is that?
KYLE
I don't know. [drops from the bench and walks over to a window] Let me go check. [an FBI agent crashes through the window, falls and rolls into a standing position, then aims his firearm at the boys. The boys are startled and jump]
AGENT 1
Freeze!! FBI!! [a second agent crashes through the other window and rolls into position as well. A third agent leaps in through the second window]
AGENT 2
Down on the ground! Down on the ground! [the boys are herded closer together. Three thumps are heard on the door and more agents break in with a battering ram.]
AGENT 3
Hurry up! Let me see those hands! [the boys quickly raise their hands as more agents pour in. The boys are handcuffed]
AGENT 2
[into his walkie-talkie] Tango Teamus to Point Bravo! Suspects in custody! [the boys are escorted out of the room]
AGENT 4
Move move move move move move! All clear, men! [to the boys] Get your ass going!
AGENT 5
Move move move move move move! Move!
GERALD
[appears at the door with Sheila] Kyle, what did you do?!
KYLE
[being herded into an FBI van with the other boys] I don't know!
[Cartman's house. He, Tolkien and Butters begin to practice.]
CARTMAN
All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them. [some sheet music is shown. Cartman has already crossed out the original author's name] See? All we have to do is cross out words like "baby" and "Darling" and replace them with [writes next to "baby"] Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat. [Butters doesn't understand, but starts drumming. It's rather good] Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Tolkien, give me a smooth bass line.
TOLKIEN
I don't know how to play bass. [Butters stops]
CARTMAN
[Sighs, has his left fist on his forehead, eyes shut] Tolkien, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass.
TOLKIEN
I'm gettin' sick of your stereotypes!
CARTMAN
Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line! [Tolkien begins to play a bass line, then is surprised that he can actually do it, then realizes that Cartman is right]
TOLKIEN
God-damnit! [Butters joins in and their sounds flow together]
CARTMAN
 All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. [begins to sing]
I need you in my life, Jesus.
I can't live without you, Jesus
And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus.
BUTTERS
Well done!
[United States Federal Bureau of Investigation, day. Inside, a detective reviews some reports on the boys' Internet activity. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny wait on the other side of the table.]
KYLE
[some seconds later] Um, sir-
YATES
Shut up!! [the boys jump in their seats, then look down, chagrined] You downloaded a lot of songs! Says here you even downloaded Judas Priest? That's hard time you boys are lookin' at. You got anything to say for yourselves?
KYLE
[rubs the table a bit] We d-didn't think it was that big a deal.
YATES
[pissed off] Not a big deal! You think downloading music for free is not a big deal?! Put your coats on! I'm gonna show you something! And I don't think you're gonna like it!
[A mansion, unknown location, day. The agent has taken the boys for a ride and arrived here. He leads them to the main gate.]
YATES
This is the home of Lars Ulrich, the drummer for Metallica. [they approach a bush] Look. There's Lars now, sitting by his pool. [he's seen sitting on the edge of a chaise longue, his face in his hands, softly sobbing]
KYLE
What's the matter with him?
YATES
This month he was hoping to have a gold-plated shark tank bar installed right next to the pool, but thanks to people downloading his music for free, he must now wait a few months before he can afford it.
YATES
[a close-up of Lars sobbing] Come. There's more. [leads them away. Next seen is a small airport at night] Here's Britney Spears' private jet. Notice anything? [a shot of Britney boarding a plane, then stopping to look at it before entering] Britney used to have a Gulfstream IV. Now she's had to sell it and get a Gulfstream III because people like you chose to download her music for free. [Britney gives a heavy sigh and goes inside.] The Gulfstream III doesn't even have a remote control for its surround-sound DVD system. Still think downloading music for free is no big deal?
KYLE
We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh...
YATES
That is the folly of man. Now look in this window. [they are at another mansion, and they look inside a picture window] Here you see the loving family of Master P. [He's shown tossing a basketball to his wife while his kid tries to catch it] Next week is his son's birthday and, all he's ever wanted was an island in French Polynesia. [his mom lowers the ball and gives it to the boy, who smiles, picks it up and drops it. It rolls away and he goes after it]
KYLE
So, he's gonna get it, right?
YATES
I see an island without an owner. If things keep going the way they are, the child will not get his tropical paradise.
STAN
[apologetically] We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again!
YATES
[somberly, dramatically] Man must learn to think of these horrible outcomes before he acts selfishly or else... I fear... recording artists will be forever doomed to a life of only semi-luxury.
[Some bluffs by a beach, dawn. Cartman, Tolkien and Butters scramble over some boulders to get to the beach. Seagulls fly overhead.]
CARTMAN
Almost there, you guys.
BUTTERS
Ow...
TOLKIEN
Why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here?
CARTMAN
Because, Tolkien, we have to take pictures for our album cover. [sets up his camera on a tripod] The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.
BUTTERS
Wow, neato! An album cover! [walks out onto the sand]
TOLKIEN
[follows Butters onto the sand] This Christian album better make as much money as you said it would, tubby!
CARTMAN
[when Tolkien seems out of earshot] I'm going to kill you one day, Tolkien.
TOLKIEN
[spins around] What did you say?! [Cartman is startled]
CARTMAN
Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too. [begins to focus the shot. Butters and Tolkien stand together]
BUTTERS
Cheese!
CARTMAN
No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care! [Butters and Cartman move apart. Tolkien moves off to a boulder a little farther away, Butters moves a bit closer to the camera]
BUTTERS
Cheese!
CARTMAN
No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!
BUTTERS
Oh...
CARTMAN
Tolkien, look away to the right. [Tolkien looks off to the right] More. [Tolkien turns his head to the right] More!
TOLKIEN
[turns all his body to the right] Why the hell would I be looking way over there??
CARTMAN
So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it! [starts the timer, then steps into the shot] Our first album cover.
[He raises his hands and head in praise and closes his eyes. The first shot is taken. More album covers. First, the three boys looking down at the camera as if in a football huddle. Next, a shot of the three of them standing in line, frowning. Next, a shot of Cartman making more changes to sheet music, Cartman in his room/home studio making changes with a reel-to-reel player beside him, Cartman on a bus writing new lyrics onto his left palm: "Jesus is awesome. I love him so much. Jesus is great." Cartman playing his changes on the reel-to-reel player to his band-mates. At Butters' house Butters presents Cartman with a fresh print of their first album wrapped in cellophane. Tolkien uses a hair dryer on the CD to shrink-wrap the cellophane in place, and the camera zooms in. While the scenes roll by, Cartman sings.]
CARTMAN
Don't ever leave me, Jesus. I couldn't stand to see you go.
My heart would simply snap, my Lord, if you walked on out that door.
I promise I'll be good to you, and keep you warm at night.
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why don't we just... shut off the lights.
[The FBI building, next day. The parents have shown up to retrieve the boys.]
GERALD
Thanks for releasing them to us, detective. Sorry for all the trouble they caused.
YATES
It's all right. I think these boys learned their lesson.
STAN
Boy, I'll say!
YATES
If you parents will just step over here, you can pay their four hundred dollar release and penalty fees.
RANDY
Four hundred dollars? Just for downloading some songs off the Internet? It's not that big a deal.
YATES
Not a big deal, huh?! Come with me! I'm gonna show you something! And I don't think you're gonna like it! [leads the parents away]
STAN
[walks off in the opposite direction] Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice.
KENNY
(Yeah)
KYLE
No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime!
STAN
Oh yeah.
KYLE
Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play!
KENNY
(Yeah!)
[Kyle's house, day. A reporter stands in front of it waiting to make his report. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny sit on the steps with a sign beside them: "Musicians on Strike".]
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where the rock band, MOOP, has refused to play. The strike started yesterday and could go well into next week.
CARTMAN
[walks up] Oh hey guys. How's it going?
KYLE
We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!
CARTMAN
[brushes off Kyle's comment] I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band, [brings out the CD] Faith + 1, is about to go platinum.
STAN
It is?? [Kyle's jaw drops]
CARTMAN
That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya! [tugs at one of the lobes on Kyle's hat] Hahahaha ha ha!
KYLE
You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd!
CARTMAN
It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album.
KYLE
You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!
STAN
Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity.
CARTMAN
I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta! [walks off]
KYLE
Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!
STAN
What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.
KENNY
(Yeah.)
[Christ-fest, night. A stadium's parking lot is crowded with all sorts of booths selling stuff.]
T-SHIRT VENDOR
Psalm T-Shirts! Get a T-Shirt with your favorite psalm!
BIBLE VENDOR
Leather-bound bibles. Show your faith.
CARTMAN
Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually..
ELDERLY WOMAN
Oh, this will be great for my grandchildren. They need hip cool music, but with inspirational lyrics.
CARTMAN
[takes the woman's body and puts it in the treasurer's box] I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ.
BUTTERS
Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are. [Cartman flashes an angry look at Butters. The woman looks deceived, but she takes the album with her anyway]
CARTMAN
Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.
MC
[the boys look up] All right, everyone! Welcome to Christfest 2003! [the boys leave their booth and enter the stadium] are you ready for some live music? [the crown inside begins to move]
A MAN
Yeah Jesus!
MC
Then let's give it up now for one of Christian rock's biggest bands! Trinity! [the lights come up on them]
TRINITY
The Shepherd and the Light, and His Word lifted me up
And I praise His Holy Name wherever I go.
CARTMAN
[listening backstage, moves away a big] Dammit! If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage! [a group of men walk by]
SANCTIFIED MEMBER 1
Hey is this the way to the backstage?
CARTMAN
Who are you?
SANCTIFIED MEMBER 1
We're the band Sanctified. We play metal and punk, but with lyrics that inspire faith in Christ.
SANCTIFIED MEMBER 2
Yeah. We proved that Christian music can be tough and hard core.
CARTMAN
Yeah, you guys are real hardcore.
SANCTIFIED MEMBER 1
You bet your gosh-darned rear end we are!
STAGE HAND
[stepping in] All right, uhh, Sanctified, you guys are up next.
SANCTIFIED MEMBER 3
Yeah! Let's do it!
SANCTIFIED MEMBER 2
Sent down from Heaven! The Spirit and the Glory!
CARTMAN
Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage.
SANCTIFIED MEMBER 2
Well, that, that's cool.
SANCTIFIED MEMBER 1
Always good to be praying before you're playin'.
CARTMAN
[edges over to a storage room with an open door] Let's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better. [enters. The members of Sanctified follow him in] Lord, Father in Heaven, we thank you for all your blessings and we... [quickly runs out and locks the band in, then props a chair up against the doorknob so the band can't get out]
BUTTERS
Hey, Eric, I don't think they can get out. [a shot of the stadium's exterior, then of the stands and stage]
MC
All right, Christians, how are you feeling tonight? [the crowd cheers]
FANS
Praise Jesus! Praise him! My Lord!
MC
Let's keep this salvation train going with the hot band, Sanctified!
STAGE HAND
[walks up and whispers] That's Faith + 1.
MC
Uh. Uh apparently there's been a change. Give it up for ... Faith + 1! [steps away as the house lights converge on the group. They begin to play]
CARTMAN
You know, Jesus? I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song.
I love you, Jesus. I want you to walk with me
[the fans sway back and forth]
I'll take good care of you baby. Call you my baby, baby!
You died for my sins, and you know that I would die for you, right?
What's the matter, baby? You tremble at Jesus, baby!
Your love... is my life! You know when I’m without you, there's a black hole in my life! Oo-ohhh!
I wanna believe. It's all right, 'cause I get lonely in the night and it's up to you to
Save me! Jee...sus...bay-by!
[Kyle's house, day. The MOOP boys are still sitting on the steps, sulking, striking.]
STAN
[sighs] Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough.
KYLE
Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of. We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey!
FIELD REPORTER
[the News 4 crew is still there, too] Tom, we're now entering the second day of the rock band MOOP's refusal to play, and the second day of absolutely no other news to report on. In a recent poll we asked people if MOOP's refusal to play would stop them from downloading music off the Internet. One percent said yes. Two percent said no. And ninety-seven percent said, "Who the hell is MOOP?!" Back to you, Tom.
LARS ULRICH
[the guys from Metallica approach] Hey, are you the guys protesting free Internet music downloading?
STAN
[awed] Hey, it's that Lars Ulrich guy!
LARS ULRICH
That's right. Metallica is behind you dudes a thousand percent!
JAMES HETFIELD
We're gonna sit here and protest with you until free downloadin' stop, hyeah!
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, it appears now the musicians' strike is growing! As I'm speaking, more musicians are arriving! It looks like Alanis Morissette, Blink 182, Britney Spears, and dozens of others are going to join MOOP in not playing music. This is a veritable Strikapalooza!
[Faith Records. Doves fly across the view. The building is bathed in bright sunlight.]
CEO
Guys, we here at Faith Records were very moved by your performance at Christfest. You're one of the most talented Christian rock bands we've ever heard!
CARTMAN
Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent.
BUTTERS
[tickled by Cartman's line] Heeheeheeyeah.
EXECUTIVE 1
[looking at some papers, starts off hesitantly] We just have one question, though. We were looking over some of your lyrics, uh... "I want to walk hand-in-hand with Jesus on a private beach for two./I want him to nibble on my ear and say 'I'm here for you.'" It...it seems you really love Christ.
CARTMAN
Yes, we sure do.
EXECUTIVE 1
Eh no but it appears you are actually... in love with Christ. [the boys look at each other confused]
CARTMAN
[turns the tables] Well what are you saying? That, that you don't really love Christ??
EXECUTIVE 1
[on the defensive] Well uh of course I do. I mean I just-
CARTMAN
Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this??
EXECUTIVE 1
Uh, we'd just like to make sure the bands we sign are in it for God, and not for the money.
CARTMAN
I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now.
BUTTERS
[slowly moves away] Uhm, oh. [leaves his chair]
EXECUTIVE 1
That's- all we needed to know. Just, sign here and we'll get your album sold.
[Commercial. A partly-cloudy sky is shown.]
ANNOUNCER
K-tal Records [its logo descends from the sky and drops below the screen] presents the most inspirational Christian rock band in the world! Faith + 1, [The CD cover appears] featuring the very best in good, wholesome Christian music.
CARTMAN
Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone.
ANNOUNCER
[speaking over Cartman] With great inspirational songs like "I Wasn't Born Again Yesterday,"
CARTMAN
Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday.
CARTMAN
I wanna get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus! I wanna feel his salvation all over my face!
ANNOUNCER
[a shot of a home library, with fireplace and the CD propped on an end table] The CD is filled with instant classics. Who doesn't remember... [the titles scroll by: "The Body of Christ," "Christ Again," "A Night With the Lord," "Touch Me Jesus," "I Found Jesus (With Someone Else)," "Savior Self," "Christ, What a Day," "Three Times My Savior," "Jesus Touched Me"]
CARTMAN
The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer's body, all muscled up and toned!
The Body of Christ! O, Lord Almighty, I wish I could call it my own!
You're one time, two times, three times my Savior...
Whenever I see Jesus up on that Cross I can't help but think that he looks kinda hot...
ANNOUNCER
["Quantities Limited!!!" cycles on the screen] This album is not available in stores and limited quantities are available, so order now!
[Kyle's house, day. Various musical acts, some of them from Chef Aid, have gathered to strike against free music downloads with MOOP, including the Lord of the Underworld!]
STAN
I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band.
KYLE
You guys, we can't give up on our dreams now! As soon as this strike ends, we're gonna be the biggest band ever!
LARS
Yeah, if we all give in now, people might never stop downloading our music for free!
KYLE
I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop. [a vehicle is heard pulling up. It's a U.S. Mail van. The driver steps out and approaches the crowd]
DRIVER
Certified letter for the rock band MOOP?
KYLE
[steps down to get the letter] That's us! [the driver hands him the letter and leaves. Kyle opens the envelope and reads] "Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies."
STAN
What??
KYLE
"We cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony, which will be held tomorrow morning at ten. Details and proof of sales enclosed. P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha." [stands silently for a moment, then hands the letter to Stan and walks forth a bit] He did it. Cartman got a platinum album.
STAN
Is this for real?? This is for real!
KYLE
He beat us. Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play.
LARS
But why play if we're not gonna make millions of dollars?
KYLE
[turns around and addresses the crowd] Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening.
STAN
[joins Kyle and faces the crowd] Besides, maybe our songs would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert. [shots of Rick James, Ozzy, Britney and two other acts.]
KYLE
From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music! We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?! [grins, but gets no response]
BRITNEY
...We're just about the money.
OTHER ACTS
Yeah, yeah.
KYLE
[casts his eyes down] Oh.
STAN
So... Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman? Are you- gonna pay 'im?
KYLE
I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say "Congratulations. You were right." And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars. And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it.
[Platinum album award ceremony, South Park, next day. Cartman has spent plenty of money to make this possible. He brings forth a parade complete with elephants, clowns, jugglers, a marching band, carnival rides, the works. Cartman stands on stage with Tolkien and Butters before a curtain with a large image of his album cover printed on it.]
CARTMAN
Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly.
TOLKIEN
Cartman, what the hell is all this?
CARTMAN
Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense.
TOLKIEN
But you spent all the money we made!
CARTMAN
We're Faith Plus One, Tolkien, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole. [addresses the milling crowd] There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone! [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny arrive and join Cartman onstage] Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you!
KYLE
Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars.
CARTMAN
[deferring] Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on. [grabs the mic and addresses the crowd] Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please? [the crowd cheers wildly]
A FAN
We like to praise Christ!
CARTMAN
Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now. [Kyle is awfully pissed. A technician lowers a lever and stage lights bathe the boys]
ANNOUNCER
[a power chord is played, with angelic accompaniment added] Welcome to the presentation ceremony for Faith Plus One. [the crowd cheers] And now to present the award, here's Michael Collins. [he walks up with a plaque]
KYLE
This is the worst day of my life.
CARTMAN
Ahhh, this is the best day of my life. [basks in the moment]
MICHAEL COLLINS
Boys, in recognition for over one million records sold, the Christian Recording Industry is pleased to present you with this Myrrh album. [presents the album plaque to Cartman. The crowd cheers]
CARTMAN
[takes the album] Thank you very uh- wah? Myrrh album?
STAN
I thought albums win either gold or platinum.
MICHAEL COLLINS
Nono, in Christian rock, our albums go gold and frankincense and myrrh. Congratulations!
KYLE
Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy!
CARTMAN
You mean to tell me I can never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?!
MICHAEL COLLINS
No, but you can go double myrrh. [Kyle walks off and Cartman gets pissed]
CARTMAN
GOD DAMMIT!! [throws his plaque onto the ground, where it shatters. The myrrh album falls away and the crowd is stunned]
MICHAEL COLLINS
[tries to calm Cartman down] Oh, please don't take the Lord's Name in vain.
CARTMAN
Who cares?! I can never win my bet because you stupid assholes don't give out platinum albums!
MICHAEL COLLINS
But you spread the Word of the Lord. You've brought faith in Jesus.
CARTMAN
OH, FUCK JESUS!! [deep gasp from the crowd. A woman screams loudly in disbelief]
BUTTERS
Eric, I-I'm pretty sure you shouldn't say the F-word about-uh Jesus.
TOLKIEN
Yeah. You're gonna hurt the band.
CARTMAN
[pounces onto him] Who fuckin' cares, Tolkien?! I can never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! Fuck Jesus! [The crowd screams in disbelief and scatters about]
A MAN
My ears are bleeding!
TOLKIEN
Good job, dickhead! You lost the entire audience!
CARTMAN
Ah, fuck you, Tolkien! You black asshole!
[Tolkien has had enough of that. He smacks Cartman with a left fist, a right fist, and a kick to the head. Cartman is laid out on his back and Tolkien walks away. Cartman rises, but ends up on all fours coughing. A shot of Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. They turn to leave.]
STAN
Hm. Guess he got what he deserved.
[They walk away, leaving Butters. Cartman is still coughing and Butters is unsure what to do. He rubs his fists past each other tentatively. Then he farts on Cartman's head and flips him off.]
BUTTERS
Fuck you, Eric. [He walks away.]
End of Christian Rock Hard


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:With South Park's senior citizens behind the wheel, more than a few farmer's markets have been mowed down. Unwilling to surrender their driver's licenses, the elderly fight back.

script:Grey Dawn

[South Park Farmer's Market, Day. A crowd is gathered under this banner and listens to Father Maxi as he delivers a service.]
FATHER MAXI
Friends, we gather in this place to mourn the victims of yesterday's tragedy: nine good people who were run over in the street by an elderly woman driver. [the four boys are shown in their funeral best]
CARTMAN
[yawns] Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring.
KYLE
[jabs Cartman and says in hushed tones] You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine people died!
CARTMAN
Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly.
FATHER MAXI
It is sometimes hard, in times like these, to understand God's way. Why would he allow nine innocent people to be run down in the prime of their lives by a senior citizen who, perhaps, shouldn't be driving? It is then that we must understand, God's sense of humor is very different from our own. He does not laugh at the simple "man walks into a bar" joke. No, God needs complex irony and subtle farcical twists that seem macabre to you and me. All that we can hope for is that God got his good laugh and a tragedy such as this will never happen again. [screeching tires are heard]
MR. GARRISON
[rushing into the crowd] Look out!! [everyone turns to see. An elderly driver approaches them]
ELDERLY DRIVER
[somewhat short, nearsighted] Huh? Was that a stop sign back there? [the banner recedes behind him. Everyone screams and the driver begins mowing people down. He crashes into a light standard at the other end of the market] Ooooh, I think I hit a pothole.
[Stan's house, night. The family is eating dinner.]
STAN
Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive?
RANDY
Well, Stan, it's a very fragile issue.
STAN
But they kill people.
RANDY
Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly, Stan. We can't just take their licenses away.
MARVIN
[enters in his motorized wheelchair] I'll be Goddamned if they think they can take my license away! [stops at his place at table]
SHARON
Oooh, Hi Dad.
MARVIN
[to Randy] I heard what you said! You wanna take drivin' privileges away from seniors! Well let me tell you something, peckerface! I worked fifty five years in the steel mill!
RANDY
Yes Dad.
MARVIN
And I flew Spitfires over Germany in World War II!
RANDY
Yes I know.
MARVIN
And I will be God-damned if the government thinks it can step in and take away my right to drive!
STAN
I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die.
[Stark's Pond, night. A lone man is fishing in the middle of the pond. He senses something ominous and looks around. On the road nearby, a brown Buick drives by slowly. A short old woman is at the wheel.]
ELDERLY MAN
Damnit Mona, this isn't the fastest way to Country Kitchen Buffet!
MONA
No, but it's the shortest. I save the most gas that way. [back at the pond the fisherman casts his line and looks back at the car]
ELDERLY MAN
You save the most gas if you take the highway to Country Kitchen Buffet!
MONA
Less miles means less gas, you old fool. [back at the pond the fisherman catches something and is reeling it in, but looks at the car in doing so]
ELDERLY MAN
There's Country Kitchen right there!
MONA
Where?
ELDERLY MAN
Right there! You're gonna miss it! [the woman steps hard on the brake and spins the car out of control. The fisherman is about to put his catch into his little boat. The car smashes through the guard rail over a bridge and lands directly on the fisherman, killing him.]
MONA
Is this the parking lot?
ELDERLY MAN
I think so.
[News 4. A splash screen shows various correspondents and anchors, and a globe spins in front of the Montage.]
ANCHOR
Another death tonight by a senior citizen motorist. Carl Zorn of Pine Junction was killed instantly when struck by a vehicle driven by Pete and Lydia Malman, who were trying to find Country Kitchen Buffet. This latest tragedy comes only two days after the accident in Deer Creek, where three construction workers and a bulldozer [shown] were run down by senior citizen Paul Thom [shown, irate], who was trying to find Country Kitchen Buffet. Public outcry is forcing the DMV to consider suspending the licenses of all seniors over seventy, though no decision has yet to be made.
[Park County Community Center, day. The seniors have gathered there for a meeting.]
MARVIN
Seniors of South Park, I don't know about you, but I am mad as hell!
SENIORS
[randomly] Yeah!
ELDERLY WOMAN 1
[rises] I'm sick of having my mental condition come into question!
ELDERLY MAN 1
[waving his cane] We need to let everyone know we're pissed off, and we're not gonna take it anymore!
SENIORS
[randomly] Yeah! Yeah! That's right, Pete!
MARVIN
That's right! Now, ...can anybody remember what we're pissed off about? [everyone seems to have lost a clue] Now, remember we're all pissed about something and uh... that's why we had this meeting, but I... can't for the life of me re-
ELDERLY WOMAN 2
[rises] Oooo. Was it the kids skateboarding on the sidewalks? No? [sits down]
ELDERLY MAN 2
[seated behind a walker] Oh, I remember! They're gonna take our licenses away!
SENIORS
[randomly, suddenly animated] Yeah! Yeah! That's right!
MARVIN
That's right! They're gonna try and take our licenses away! And I, for one, am mad as hell!
SENIORS
[randomly] Me too! Yeah, that's right! And mine too!
ELDERLY WOMAN 1
I'm sick of having my mental condition come into question!
MARVIN
So now, what are we gonna do about it?
ELDERLY MAN 3
Do about what?
ELDERLY WOMAN 3
They're gonna take our licenses away.
ELDERLY WOMAN 1
They are?? They can't do that! [brief argument ensues]
MARVIN
That's right. So you know what I think we should do? I think we should have a senior citizens' meeting! Get all the seniors together at the community center and unite!
ELDERLY MAN 3
Great idea, Marvin!
ELDERLY WOMAN 4
Wait, ah I think we're having that meeting right now.
MARVIN
...Oh, right, this is the meeting.
ELDERLY MAN 4
Right. To get those damn kids to stop skateboarding on the sidewalks!
SENIORS
[randomly] Yeah! Yeah! That's right! Someone's gotta stop them!
[The Marsh house, day. Sharon and Shelly are making construction paper cutouts in the kitchen. Shelly has finished some eyes.]
RANDY
[steps into the kitchen] Sharon, have you seen Dad?
SHARON
He's not here, hon. He's having a meeting with all the seniors in town at the community center.
RANDY
Oh. [steps back out] Wait a minute. If all the seniors in town are at a meeting, that means that when the meeting gets out...
SHARON
Every senior in town will be driving home...
RANDY
[with rising alarm] At the same time. [closeup] Oh My God!
[Downtown South Park. People are milling around. Randy runs into the scene.]
RANDY
Get inside! Get inside! [people begin taking heed] Seniors' meeting getting out! Get off the streets! [everyone moves off the streets in panic]
SOMEONE
Oh my Goddd!
[Park County Community Center, day. The seniors exit the center and head for their cars.]
MARVIN
[amid the crowd] All right, great meeting everyone. Let's do it again sometime.
ELDERLY WOMAN 1
So long, everybody.
ELDERLY MAN 5
Goodbye, Missy. [other seniors say their goodbyes. They drive off slowly, some bumping into other cars on their way out]
[Downtown South Park, at the farmer's market. Randy runs in.]
RANDY
Get off the streets! Get off the streets! Old people are driving! [everyone runs off in a panic. Randy finds Gerald and grabs him] Gerald! Where are the boys?!
GERALD
We've gotta get out of here!
RANDY
The boys, Gerald! Where are they?!
GERALD
They, they're... they're playing street hockey!
RANDY
[closeup] Oh My God!! [lets Gerald go and runs off]
[The neighborhood. Stan and the boys are playing street hockey. Cartman is the goalie, a trashcan his goal.]
CARTMAN
[providing his own play-by-play] With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for the goal and passes the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again [the ball bounces off Cartman's girth], proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey!
KYLE
It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal.
CARTMAN
I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body.
RANDY
[in the distance] GET OFF THE STREETS! [Cartman perks up a bit] GET OFF THE STREETS! [the other boys listen, then turn to face the source of the sound]
KYLE
Dude, look!
RANDY
[running across empty fields] GET OFF... THE STREETS! GET OFF THE STREETS!
STAN
What is that?
KYLE
I don't know.
RANDY
[coming closer] GET OFF... GET OFF THE STREET!
KYLE
Dude, is that your dad?
STAN
I think so.
CARTMAN
Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.
RANDY
-STREETS!! OFF-
STAN
What is he saying?
KYLE
I can't understand him.
RANDY
GAAAAAH!!
CARTMAN
[slowly] Calm down! We cannot understand you!
KENNY
[Looks to his right] (Ohhhhh, look!) [a phalanx of slow-moving cars cruises down the street towards them] (You guys!)
STAN
Oh! [drops his hockey stick and holds his hands to his face]
CARTMAN
Old people!
RANDY
[scoops them up and away] Come on! [the cars get closer, Randy and the boys head for a an abandoned lodge]
CARTMAN
Oh God, they're coming! [the other boys mutter other things]
[The Lodge. The group enters, Randy shuts and blocks the doors.]
RANDY
Get over there! Stay low! [the boys go to the far wall and turn around]
KYLE
Why are they all out driving at the same time?
RANDY
Shhhh! [lowers the blinds, closed them, and peeks out. Seeing nothing, he closes the blinds and sighs in relief] It's okay, boys. They're gone. Let's just lay low for a minute until we can find- [a blue car crashes through the large picture window the blinds were covering and stops. Randy jumps in alarm] AWWWW!!
ELDERLY DRIVER
[a man] I don't remember there being a building here.
RANDY
RUN! [they all gather at a corner, but another car crashes through the wall]
ELDERLY PASSENGER
[a woman] I told you to turn left, Larry.
RANDY
Get up the stairs! Up the stairs! Come on! Come on!! [he and the boys run up the stairs]
KYLE
Aah! There's another one!
RANDY AND THE BOYS
AAAHH!!
ELDERLY DRIVER
[follows them up the stair in her car] Excuse me, is this Costello Avenue? [Randy and the boys reach the second floor]
RANDY
In here! [Randy opens a door and a bloody body drops down, dangling by its feet. They move on to the next room and close the door]
CARTMAN
They're not gonna stop until we're all dead!
RANDY
Quiet! Keep quiet! [a few seconds of silence pass]
STAN
Dad, I'm scared.
RANDY
Just, keep your voices down. We'll stay the night in here. We'll stay the whole winter if we have to. [looks for a light switch to flip on]
STAN
I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore!
RANDY
Awgh. Stan, it's not that simple! Just relax while I find the lights. Here we go. [finds the switch and flips them on, revealing a car]
ELDERLY DRIVER
How the hell did we get up here?
RANDY AND THE BOYS
AAAAAAAHH!! [quickly exit the room]
ELDERLY PASSENGER
I told you this was the wrong way!
[News 4. A splash screen shows various correspondents and anchors, and a globe spins in front of the montage.]
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing outside of the Department of Motor Vehicles, where senior citizens have until three p.m. to hand over their driver's licenses. The new law was passed just three days after the Night of Horror, in which all seniors were out driving at the same time, causing fourteen deaths and three million dollars in damage.
[DMV, inside. A poster on the wall says "Drive 65 MPH. Stay alive." Two men and a woman sit at a table taking the licenses seniors standing in line give them.]
DMV OFFICIAL
[seated in the middle, takes a license from an elderly man] Alrighty. [cuts it in two and drops the halves into a box] There we go. Next? [a fat elderly lady approaches, then the elderly man with the walker]
ELDERLY MAN 2
It ain't right what you're doin'! I never had an accident in my life!
ELDERLY WOMAN 6
That's right. You shouldn't punish all of us. [the senior with the walker leaves the table]
DMV OFFICIAL
We're sorry, but this is the only way to be sure. Next please. [cuts up another license] There we go.
ELDERLY MAN 6
But how am I supposed to get to the grocery store? Or the pharmacy to buy medicine?
DMV OFFICIAL
Well, maybe you should be in a nursing home. Hmmm?
ELDERLY MAN 7
Some of us would rather die!
DMV OFFICIAL
Well, we can certainly help you with that, too.
ELDERLY WOMAN 7
We aren't second-class citizens!
ELDERLY MAN 8
That's right! You can take our licenses, but you'll never take our pride!
AN ELDERLY MAN
Yeah...
[Stan's house, day. The boys leave the house.]
CARTMAN
Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong?
MARVIN
Billy, get in the car! I need you boys to help me pick up my new Hov-Around.
STAN
Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving.
MARVIN
God-damnit Billy! You're supposed to listen to your dad, right?! Well I'm your dad's dad, and that means you get in this car before I tan all your hides!
KYLE
[to the other boys] Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside.
CARTMAN
My God, he's right. [the boys climb in, strap themselves in, and Cartman offers a quick prayer] Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death. [Marvin starts up the car and groans a bit] Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys. [a few moments later] Except for you, Kyle.
MARVIN
Okay, all set? [he backs out of the a driveway, and an oncoming car honks at him. The driver screams something at him. Pretty soon, other cars and trucks are doing their best to avoid him. Cars begin crashing and flying through the air. The boys wince at every accident]
KENNY
(Oooooo my God!) [a police cruiser catches up to them]
STAN
Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa.
MARVIN
Eh? [signals to the officer] Go around. Go around, you moron!
BARBRADY
Blue Impala, pull your vehicle over!
CARTMAN
I believe that's us... thank God. [Marvin pulls over to the side and stops. Barbrady stops as well and approaches the driver side.]
BARBRADY
Could I see your license, please?
MARVIN
I ain't got one! You peckers took it!
BARBRADY
Well then, I have to take you to jail.
MARVIN
You just try taking me to jail, scrotum-head! You just try!
[The police jail. Marvin sits behind bars with a cane.]
MARVIN
Stupid son of a- God damnit!
BARBRADY
I just got him right here, Mr. Marsh.
RANDY
Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look at you now!
MARVIN
Oh God damnit, don't you lecture me you son of a bitch!
RANDY
You just had to be so damn stubborn, didn't you?!
MARVIN
Now my son is gonna talk to me like I'm twelve.
RANDY
We're not treating you like children, Dad. All right? Now I think you owe Mr. Police Officer an apology. Who needs to apologize, hm? [wags his left index finger at Marvin] Who's the sorry-sorry?
MARVIN
Kiss my sagging ass!
RANDY
Well fine. I was gonna bail you out, but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did!
MARVIN
Well I won't be sitting here long! I've already called the AARP!
STAN
What's that?
MARVIN
The American Association of Retired Persons! The largest political group in the country! When seniors like me are bein' discriminated against, the AARP comes and sets it right! [points to Randy] And you're gonna be sorry when they get here!
[Mr. garrison's Classroom, day. He is giving a history lesson to the class.]
MR. GARRISON
And so you see, children, Genghis Khan was a "Mongol," not to be confused with a "mongoloid" like the actor, Nicolas Cage. Okay now, who can tell me in what [notices something outside and goes to the window, his voice fading off] the ...first ...film by a... mongoloid...
MR. GARRISON
[What he sees is elderly paratroopers drifting down onto the school grounds. The kids' eyes follow him and then the kids gather at the window with him] That's odd. [the AARP has landed] Those ROTC guys are way off course. [the paratroopers open their cargo boxes and unload some firearms]
CARTMAN
More old people!
STAN
The American Association of Retired Persons.
MR. GARRISON
Stay in your seats, children. I'll be right back.
AARP LEADER
Set up a perimeter! Bring Bravo Team to Point Delta!
AARP MEMBER 1
[a heavyset woman] Bravo Team is go.
AARP MEMBER 2
[a light-skinned black man] Move! Move! Move!
AARP MEMBER 3
[a woman in purple dress] Let's go! Let's go! [Mr. Garrison comes out to meet them.]
MR. GARRISON
Uh, can I help you folks find something? [the woman smacks him across the face with the butt of her semi-automatic.] Oowww! [goes down in pain on one knee. The seniors begin firing away, with rifles, semi-automatics, whatever. The kids look on and gasp]
CARTMAN
Old people gone mad!
[U.S. Geological Service. Randy sits at his desk making notes when he hears the soft rustling of tarp on snow. He spins around in his chair to see more AARP paratroopers. He rises in disbelief. A gas canister flies through the window and unleashes its fumes. Randy starts coughing. The door flies open and some AARP paratroopers walk in wearing gas masks.]
AARP MEMBER
[woman wearing a flower-design dress] Contact. [quickly aims her machine gun at Randy] Put your hands up, young man!
[South Park Jail. Marvin is looking out his small cell window when the AARP enters the jail and approach the cell.]
AARP LEADER
Marvin Marsh?
MARVIN
[turns around] Yes?
AARP LEADER
I'm Bill Stewart, President of the AARP. Hu-we've come to help the seniors in this town fight back.
MARVIN
Oh, it's nice to meet ya, Bill.
STEWART
Huh?? We came as fast as we could. We just had to stop by Country Kitchen Buffet first.
[Shady Acres, a Retirement Community. The AARP has arrived.]
AARP LEADER
[a black man] It's the nursing home! Liberate our comrades!
[Shady Acres, inside]
MALE NURSE
There now, Mr. Johnson. [wheels a senior across the room] We can go to the cafeteria and get you some creamed corn and toast. [the front doors swing open and the nurse stops in his tracks. The AARP members swarm in] Can I help you?
AARP LEADER
Help this! [jams the butt of his gun into the nurse, and the nurse falls.] The revolution is on, brother! [hands Mr. Johnson a semi-automatic] We're taking control of the town!
MR. JOHNSON
Well, alright, well it's about damn time! [addresses the nursing home residents] Hey everyone, we're taking the town. [other seniors look at him and express their approval]
[The television room. More seniors there are watching TV.]
AARP MEMBER
[enters with the black leader] Seniors, we're taking the town over.
AARP LEADER
The revolution is on! [walks away]
ELDERLY WOMAN
The revolution?
ELDERLY MAN
Oh, I'd better get my other sweater. [goes to change while the others leave the room]
[A convalescent room.]
A NURSE
[distributing weapons] Mrs. Wyland, seniors are taking over the town. Would you like a gun?
MRS. WYLAND
Oh, I suppose so.
[Downtown South Park, day. One of the members brings Randy forward.]
RANDY
What the hell is going on?!
AARP MEMBER
Shut your piehole and get over there! [Randy joins Gerald and other adult hostages]
GERALD
Randy, what is this?
STEWART
Hey! You are now under the authority of the AARP!
MARVIN
Ha! There you go, Mr. Smartmouth! Look at you now!
RANDY
Dad, what are you doing??
MARVIN
The AARP is gonna help us take this town until we get our licenses back!
ELDERLY WOMAN
[in dark-blue dress] Yeah, and we're gonna ask for more money in Medi-Care, too!
AARP LEADER
[black] That's right.
ELDERLY MAN
Yeah.
MAN IN VEST
[handcuffed in front] Have you all got Alzheimer's? The-they're not gonna listen to a bunch of whacked out senior citizens.
STEWART
[puts hand to ear] Heh?? [lowers his hand] We'll tell them if they don't give us our demands, we'll start killin' hostages!
MAN IN VEST
Huh, right. They're gonna really believe that. [the elderly woman next to him simply lifts her gun and fires at the man point blank. The man falls down dead]
MARVIN
Isn't that a little extreme, Bill?
STEWART
[puts hand to ear] Heh?? [lowers his hand] No, we gotta be tough! Just like with those damned Japs!
RANDY
This is insane, Dad! You all need to stop right now before more people get hurt!
MARVIN
The time when you can tell me what to do is over, pucky-boy! We're in charge now!
[South Park, day. The town is now an encampment, protected by barbed wire, sandbags, and metal shields. Mrs. Wyland stands behind some sandbags with her IV unit.]
MARVIN
All right, we've got control of the Mayor's office and the fire station.
AARP MEMBER
Reinforcements have arrived from the nursing home in Conifer.
STEWART
Good! Hell, us senior citizens could take over the entire country!
AARP LOOKOUT
[a black woman] We've got company! [the military arrives]
TANK DRIVER
[over a PA system] Attention seniors: lay down your weapons and turns yourselves over!
STEWART
Mrs. Applegate, show 'em we mean business.
MRS. APPLEGATE
[holding an RPG launcher] All right. [fires the rocket and falls back from the recoil. The rocket heads for a Jeep full of troops. The troops scramble off. The rocket strikes and demolishes the Jeep, killing one of the soldiers]
TANK DRIVER
What do you want?
STEWART
[puts hand to ear] Heh??
MARVIN
We want our licenses back!
OTHER SENIORS
Yeah!
ELDERLY WOMAN
That's right. And we want more money in Medi-Care!
OTHER SENIORS
Yeah!
ELDERLY MAN
And we want those damned kids to stop skateboardin' on the sidewalk!
OTHER SENIORS
Yeah!
[Nighttime, the drive-in. All adults who are not senior citizens have been gathered into an enclosure around the massive screen. Two seniors stand guard at the gates, other seniors keep the adults in line. The adults are cold. Some cough, some try to keep warm by burning tires inside empty gas drums. Randy is one of those warming his hands over a fire. He moans. The boys arrive, having not been arrested.]
STAN
Hey Dad.
RANDY
[runs to the fence] Stan! Boys! You're safe!
STAN
Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?
RANDY
They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!
KYLE
They're saying something about taking over the entire country.
RANDY
[exasperated] Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them!
STAN
No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?
RANDY
No, son. We... like to sleep in.
AN ELDERLY WOMAN
Two hostages come front and center! [Randy looks back, alarmed].
RANDY
They're coming!! Get out of here before they see you! Run to the hills and find a way to fight them! Go!! [the boys turn and leave] Boys, avenger me! AVENGE ME!!
[The woods. The boys have set up a little camp there for the night.]
STAN
All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town. The old people have blockades here [south entrance] and here [west entrance]. The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office.
CARTMAN
So our only solution is to cut off their life force.
KYLE
We can't fight them, Cartman.
CARTMAN
No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply. [runs his finger along the map to its destination] Here.
KYLE
Country Kitchen Buffet?
CARTMAN
Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do.
KYLE
That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week.
STAN
Yeah, I remember hearing about that.
KYLE
Even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?
CARTMAN
I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight.
CARTMAN
We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people. [they appear from the sides of buildings dressed in black and then gather in front of one of them] At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town. [they head for a train at the South Park Train Station and climb into a caboose. Kenny pulls on the horn] Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's office[the elderly guards sleep standing up and fail to take notice of any sound] and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed.
CARTMAN
Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside.
[Cartman does all the strapping, and he brings out a remote-control trigger as Kyle approaches the restaurant's front door. He presses the button and the buffet blows up. Kyle's charred hat drops back in front of the boys. The boys cheer.]
CARTMAN
Yeah!
STAN
All right!
KENNY
(Woohoo!)
CARTMAN
Aw yeah!
STAN
We did it! [Cartman is finished and the others look at him like he's crazy]
STAN
...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in.
CARTMAN
Well, right, or we could always do that.
[South Park, day. The old people have the run of the town, and they're bringing in heavier artillery.]
STEWART
All right everyone, round up your ammunition and get ready to move! We're takin' this war further out!
AARP MEMBERS
[amid other cheers] All right!
MARVIN
Uh, I appreciate what the AARP is tryin' to do for us, but uh, all we want is our licenses back.
STEWART
[puts hand to ear] Huh?? [lowers his hand] Heck no! This is goin' too well. We're gonna take the whole country back. Wipe out everyone below the age of sixty five!
MARVIN
Wipe 'em out?? What are you? Senile?
STEWART
[approaches the front door of Country Kitchen Buffet] Come on, everyone! It's time to plan for Phase 2! [tries to get the doors open, but finds they're locked. He scratches his head] What the heck? [checks again, but the doors remain locked] Huh? What is this?! It's 6 a.m. C-Country Kitchen should be open!
ELDERLY MAN 9
It's not open? It has to be! [each man takes a door and tries to open it, but the doors won't budge]
ELDERLY MAN 10
Try a window.
ELDERLY MAN 11
[bangs on a window, to no avail] They're blocked from the inside.
STEWART
No... [bangs frantically on the double doors] Let us in! Let us in!
ELDERLY MAN 9
Open the door! It's six a.m. [the other seniors come up and bang on the windows]
ELDERLY WOMAN
Open the Country Kitchen Buffet for us!
ELDERLY MAN
You have to let us in! [a few hours later and all the seniors are sprawled out on the snow. One of them is still trying to crawl. A few more hours and all movement has stopped]
ARMY OFFICIAL
All right everyone, area secure. Collect their weapons and free the hostages. [walks up to the boys] That was a great strategy, boys. You may very well have saved this entire country. [Randy and Sharon arrive rubbing their eyes. Gerald and Sheila arrive also]
RANDY
Whoa-ho-ho-ooh, what happened? Is it over?
ARMY OFFICIAL
Everything is fine. Control of the town is back to you folks.
STEWART
[two soldiers escort his fatigued self away] Country Kitchen... wha-what happened?
SOLDIER
[one of two escorting Marvin] Sir, what should we do with this one?
ARMY OFFICIAL
It's up to the townspeople.
RANDY
Well, I think he learned his lesson. Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad? I think somebody owes us all an apology. Yes he does.
STAN
Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault!
RANDY
Huh?
STAN
Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it.
MARVIN
That's right.
STAN
And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine.
MARVIN
I know. I guess sometimes us seniors need to know when to stop driving so we don't put the responsibility on our families.
RANDY
Well, I think this has been a real learning experience for the Marsh family. People died, but we all grew a little. Let's just go home.
MARVIN
Sure. I'll drive.
RANDY
[laughs and goes to wheel Marvin off] That's our Grandpa. [both men and Sharon laugh]
STAN
[to his friends] Dude, I hate my family. [looks down embarrassed and walks away]
End of Grey Dawn


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Kyle chooses Stan, Kenny and Butters to celebrate his birthday at Casa Bonita. When Cartman finds out he's not invited, he arranges for Butters to conveniently go "missing".

script:Casa Bonita

[Stan's house, day. Stan, Kenny, and Cartman watch TV from the couch. Cartman is eating a bowl of chips.]
STAN
Dude, I wonder where Kyle is.
CARTMAN
Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome.
STAN
Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that.
KENNY
(Yeah.)
CARTMAN
Who's joking? [a door opens and closes offscreen]
KYLE
[enters excitedly, his arms up in the air] You guys! You guys! I have awesome news!
CARTMAN
You have AIDS?
KYLE
No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends!
CARTMAN
[stands up] Wow! Casa Bonita?!
KENNY
[stands up] (Woo-hoo!)
STAN
[stands up] What's Casa Bonita?
CARTMAN
Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and [holds out his hand wide] all kinds of stuff!
KYLE
It's like the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants.
CARTMAN
This Saturday! Awesome! [begins to sing to "La Cucaracha"] Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive atmosphere. [begins to snap his fingers] Casa Bonita!
KYLE
Who said I'm inviting you? [this freezes Cartman for a few seconds]
CARTMAN
You... your Mom said you could take three friends.
KYLE
Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend.
CARTMAN
Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny?
KYLE
I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one.
CARTMAN
Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?!
KYLE
Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!
CARTMAN
I have never been a dick to you.
KYLE
[rolls his eyes] Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!
CARTMAN
Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?
KYLE
[thinks back and counts the number of times Cartman has ripped on him for being a Jew]
[in the playground. Craig is there instead of Kenny] Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew!
[in the playground, by the school's back doors] You're a Jew!
[in Cartman's room. Cartman is wearing a crown] Shut your God-damned Jew mouth!
[at Kyle's house, on the front steps] Good job, Jew!
[singing the Dreidel song with Kyle's family and Stan] Jew...
[leaving his seat in class] Shut up, Jew!
[at Cartman's house, with outfits] You're Jewish!!
[seated on a curb with the other boys] Dude, he's Jewish!
[staking out a house] Jew!
[on Nightline, seated next to Stan] Jew!
[in Cartman's dining room] Jew!
[at the side of a road, with Tweek and with their parents] Jew!
[next to stacks of lumber, as Kyle is about to whack him] Jew!
[at a barn, through a hole on the roof] Jew!
[Stan's room. Kyle reads a Bible] Jew?!
[At the Costa Rican rainforest, during practice] "I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm." "Fuck off, Cartman!"
CARTMAN
[Cartman thinks back as well] Okay, except maybe for that one time.
KYLE
You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you. [turns and walks away, but Cartman stays close]
CARTMAN
Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place [Kyle turns around] in the whole world. I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please! [holds his hands together in a sign of pleading]
KYLE
[crosses his arms and avoids Cartman's eyes] Sorry, my mind's made up.
CARTMAN
[turns irate and flips him off] Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day! [shoves the middle finger close to Kyle's face] Kiss my balls, asshole!!! [turns and walks away. The front door opens, closes, and opens again. Cartman returns and apologizes] Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle. I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.
KYLE:
[clearly annoyed now] I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
CARTMAN
[turns irate and flips him off again] Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die!! [turns and walks away. The front door opens, then closes]
[Cartman's house, night. Cartman sleeps...]
CARTMAN
Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys! [waves them on. Next scene is him getting a large platter of food] Oh, awesome!! [next scene is him waving his friends to a cave] Come on, you guys! Black Bart's Cave! [next scene is him by a waterfall] Wow, cliff divers! [a cliff diver takes a dive from the top of the waterfall. Next scene is Cartman on his third dish] More sopapillas, please! [next scene has him dancing in front of a low stage, on which a mariachi quartet plays its songs. An image of Kyle floats through his dream]
KYLE
I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.
CARTMAN
[with more foods on his plates, the dream dissolves. He's pulled up and away] No! Noooo! [he's pulled out of Casa Bonita and floats away] Casa Bonita! Noooo! [startled out of his dream] AAAAH!! [catches his breath] Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!
[Kyle's house, next day. Cartman approaches the front door in a nice sweater and rings the bell. Kyle answers.]
CARTMAN
[looking quite presentable] Hi Kyle. [smiles]
KYLE
[studies Cartman a bit, but isn't impressed] That isn't it, Cartman.
CARTMAN
What isn't it?
KYLE
That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!
CARTMAN
...I don't understand the difference.
KYLE
I know you don't. [steps back and slams the door on Cartman's face]
[South Park Elementary, day. The kids head for class: Bill, Craig, Wendy, then Jimmy. Cartman enters and rounds the corner, sees Jimmy and runs up to him.]
CARTMAN
Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up! [Annie and Red walk by at the far end of the hall. Jimmy stops] Dude, uh I need your help on something.
JIMMY
Well, sure, Eric. W-w-what seems to be the p-p-p-problem?
CARTMAN
Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how "do" you act nice to people?
JIMMY
Well, the best thing is not to act nice, Eric. Uh, the best thing is to be genuinely nice.
CARTMAN
Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people?
JIMMY
Well, Eric, pah part of being nice is just making people smile and laugh. The best way to do that is by telling a fan-tastic joke or a humorous anti-d- ant'duhh ...anecdote.
CARTMAN
Like what?
JIMMY
Well, like, try this one on for size: Knock knock.
CARTMAN
Who's there?
JIMMY
Ing-mar ...Bergman. [Cartman jumps, but not because of the joke. Kyle approaches them from the other end of the hall.] Now you say, "Ingmar Bergman who?" [Cartman quickly punches Jimmy in the face]
CARTMAN
Take that, Jimmy! [strikes him again, and Jimmy falls away] And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again! [Kyle stops by and looks. Cartman glances at him] Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?! [looks at Kyle] Oh, Kyle. Hey.
KYLE
Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice? [turns and walks on his way]
CARTMAN
Uh... [turns and runs towards Kyle] He-hey Kyle! Knock knock. [follows him around the corner] Knock knock, Kyle!
[The school cafeteria. Cartman is looking at a picture. A tear wells up in his left eye. The picture's frame reads "I Had A Good Time at CASA BONITA," and the picture within is one of Cartman, his mom, and the mariachis in the background. He hears Kyle's excited voice.]
KYLE
Yeah, Casa Bonita, this Saturday! [approaches a table with Kenny, Stan, and Butters]
BUTTERS
Wow, that's gonna be so fun!
STAN
Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us.
KENNY
(Yeah!) [Cartman sits at his own table, alone.]
[The school hall, the bell rings. Red and Annie walk one way, Kyle and Craig the opposite way. Keven opens up his locker. Kyle stops at his locker, and Cartman walks up.]
CARTMAN
Hey Kyle.
KYLE
Well?
CARTMAN
Well what?
KYLE
How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time?
CARTMAN
I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go.
KYLE
Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did.
CARTMAN
So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.
KYLE
I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
CARTMAN
I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later. [turns and walks away]
KYLE
Eh... hey, Cartman? [Cartman turns around] You really don't care that you can't go?
CARTMAN
I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore.
KYLE
That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.
CARTMAN
Good.
KYLE
And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.
CARTMAN
Sweet, whatever. [walks on, then mouths to himself] Bingo!
[Cartman's house, Friday night. Cartman leads Butters into his bedroom.]
BUTTERS
What's this all about, Eric?
CARTMAN
[leads him to a telescope, then turns] Butters, can you keep a secret?
BUTTERS
Well, sure I can!
CARTMAN
For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible.
BUTTERS
Nnn-how terrible?
CARTMAN
A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth.
BUTTERS
What?? [begins rubbing his hands together nervously]
CARTMAN
Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think. [backs up and looks through the eyepiece] Do you see anything?
BUTTERS
I just see stars. [Cartman hops onto a chair and fishes in his left jacket pocket. He pulls out a wad of junk hanging from a string]
CARTMAN
Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.
BUTTERS
Nope, uh I don't see any... [Cartman holds up the wad against the objective lens] Oh wait. Oh my God! I see it. I see it! It's a meteor! Oh my God!
CARTMAN
Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer? [Butters looks through again and Cartman holds up the wad, moving it closer to the objective lens.]
BUTTERS
It is! It is getting closer! Oh my God!
CARTMAN
Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth.
BUTTERS
When do you think uh it'll get here?
CARTMAN
I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations. [heads for his desk and pulls out a calculator] 10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus.
BUTTERS
What??
CARTMAN
According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours.
BUTTERS
Oh, you mean we're gonna die?!
CARTMAN
No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!
BUTTERS
Wha...? Where is there a bomb shelter??
CARTMAN
Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry! [heads out the door]
BUTTERS
AAAAHH! [follows him out]
[Jimbo's house. Cartman and Butters head for the bomb shelter.]
BUTTERS
Oh Jeez!
CARTMAN
Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here! [opens the shelter's lid]
BUTTERS
[enters and climbs down the ladder within] Oh God! Oh Jesus! [Cartman watches him, then follows him down the ladder]
CARTMAN
[reaches the shelter floor] All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks.
BUTTERS
But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too.
CARTMAN
No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.
BUTTERS
Are you sure?
CARTMAN
[looks away] I'm not sure of anything anymore. [turns and climbs up the ladder. He makes it out and looks down] Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.
BUTTERS
But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?
CARTMAN
Well, you know, with your wiener. [Butters just stares back] Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind. [leaves and closes the lid, then locks it]
BUTTERS
[in darkness] Oh God, oh God!
[Kyle's house, Saturday night. Stan and Kenny are dressed in stripes, Sheila waits in a fur coat, Kyle is in his Sunday best checking his watch.]
KYLE
Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago.
SHEILA
Well I think we better just go without him, Kyle. It's getting late.
KYLE
Yeah, screw him. Let's go. [the door bell rings and Kyle looks at the door] Oh, finally! [walks to get the door, but sees Cartman instead]
CARTMAN
[bearing a gift] Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present.
KYLE
Oh. Thanks, dude.
CARTMAN
Hope you have a good one. See you later. [turns around and walks toward the street]
KYLE
Oh wait. Cartman.
CARTMAN
Yes?
KYLE
Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?
CARTMAN
[enters the house] Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything?
KYLE
I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?
CARTMAN
Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.
KYLE
All right, let's go.
SHEILA
[heads for the front door] Okay, boys. Get in the car.
CARTMAN
[gets excited] Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!
SHEILA
[finds Butters' parents approaching] Oh, hello Chris, Linda.
CHRIS
[misty-eyed. Linda sobs silently] Hello everyone. Have any of you seen our son?
KYLE
Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight.
CHRIS
We know, but... he hasn't been home since last night. The police have been looking everywhere, but... [Linda cries audibly] Well, thank you. Uh, please, let us know if you find out anything. [they leave. Linda is sobbing hard]
LINDA
Oh Butters!
KYLE
Aw dude, weak.
CARTMAN
[lowers his head and walks towards the front door] Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters. [brightens up] Well, let's get going, shall we?
KYLE
Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing.
STAN
Yeah, it's kinda weird.
CARTMAN
[a little stunned] Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters...
KYLE
Nah, I can't. We should help look for him.
STAN
Yeah.
SHEILA
That's very good of you, boys. We can postpone Casa Bonita until next Saturday.
CARTMAN
Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the... [catches himself and waits for a reaction. None comes] In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.
STAN
Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there. [exits]
KYLE
Yeah. And then we can try the football field. [exits]
SHEILA
I'll drive you boys. [exits]
CARTMAN
[left alone] Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!
[South Park, Sunday. In front of the police station, Officer Barbrady stands by while one of his men issues the report to the crowd standing before the dais.]
YATES
All right, folks, this is the little boy we're looking for: [holds up a picture of Butters] Leopold Stotch, also known as Butters. He's been missing for two days and was last seen at the school. Let's go find him.
[The bomb shelter. Butters has found the light switch and is enjoying the rations stored on the shelves along the wall.]
BUTTERS
[reading some directions] "Dried food rations. Add water to feed flavored square..." [the lid opens up above him] Hello? [rises and looks up] Hello??
CARTMAN
[suddenly looks in, looking terribly roughed up] Butters!
BUTTERS
[jumps back, startled] Hwaaaah!!
CARTMAN
Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!
BUTTERS
Wuh, wait, well, what happened??
CARTMAN
[faking fatigue] The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time...
BUTTERS
What about my parents. Did you see them?
CARTMAN
There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation. [coughs]
BUTTERS
[heads for the ladder and begins to climb] Oh my God, let me see!
CARTMAN
No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh...
BUTTERS
[off the ladder] How many survivors are there? You should all come down here.
CARTMAN
We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can. [strains a bit, like he's gonna cough]
BUTTERS
Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me.
CARTMAN
Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild. [coughs] I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday. [moves off] G-goodbye! [locks the lid down once again] All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.
[Police station, night. News 4 is covering another announcement by the police.]
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, it has now been three days since the Stotch child has gone missing. Townspeople continue to search, but hope... is dwindling.
YATES
All right, folks. I wanna thank you for all your efforts. Three days is a long time, but we've got to keep going if we're gonna find him.
CARTMAN
[not spoken, he's thinking this while Yates speaks.] Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita. [closes his eyes and begins anticipating. Three images come up. The first is of his waitress bringing him food, the second is of him dancing before a mariachi band, the third is of the cliff divers. He begins to dance while he daydream]
YATES
Many times in cases like these a child can trap themselves. It is important that we spread our search to duct pipes, wells, and bomb shelters. [Cartman's dance is rudely interrupted by this]
CARTMAN
What what what?
YATES
I say we need to move the search to ducts, wells, and bomb shelters. Let's move out, people! Every second counts! [the crowd breaks up and begins the search]
CARTMAN
UUuuugh!! [runs off]
BUTTERS
But if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.
Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl, baby please don't go. Eh,
Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl. [the shelter lid opens again] Eric? [rises and looks up the shaft] Eric, is that you?
CARTMAN
[scrambling down the ladder] Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way!
BUTTERS
Who's coming this way?
CARTMAN
The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!
BUTTERS
Oh God! I hate cannibals!
CARTMAN
They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive.
BUTTERS
Noooo!
CARTMAN
We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box! [picks it up and promptly drops it over Butters so Butters can't see a thing.] There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins.
BUTTERS
But I can't see nothin'.
CARTMAN
Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location. [guides him to the ladder and nudges him up] There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top. [Butters climbs out] Good.
BUTTERS
Are we out in the destruction?
CARTMAN
Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.
BUTTERS
Aw man.
CARTMAN
All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice. [walks off. Butters follows]
[An open field, night. Butters and Cartman are walking through the field behind a row of houses, far enough away so that no sound can reach them.]
CARTMAN
Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble.
BUTTERS
Huh... Oh, it's terrible.
CARTMAN
We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter.
BUTTERS
Whoa!
[The old gas station.]
CARTMAN
Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here. [steps to the other side and begins making noises, then steps back] Oh my God!
BUTTERS
Whaaat??
CARTMAN
It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal! [steps to the other side and begins making noises, then steps back]
BUTTERS
AAAAHH!
CARTMAN
We've got to fight them off! [jabs at the air a few times] Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope! [makes "cannibal" noises] Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!
BUTTERS
Waaaaaah!
CARTMAN
[picks up a twig] Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack? [goes to Butters' other side and begins breaking off pieces of the twig as he makes more "cannibal" noises.]
BUTTERS
Ooohhhh!
CARTMAN
Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh! [swings it and kills the "cannibal"] Die! [one last jab, the "cannibal" "croaks" and it's over]
BUTTERS
Ooooh, what happened? What happened?!
CARTMAN
[feigns exhaustion] The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me, [checks out his hand] which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well.
BUTTERS
Oh no!
CARTMAN
We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you!
BUTTERS
Uh w-where??
CARTMAN
Look! There's an old refrigerator! [reaches it and opens it] Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you!
BUTTERS
Aren't you coming?
CARTMAN
Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change. [begins to "change"] No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter.
BUTTERS
Eric, you're the ...best friend in the whole world. I... I love you.
CARTMAN
I love you too, man. I just [goes into spasms] You look so delicious! Must eat your brains! [lunges at Butters, who quickly closes the refrigerator door. Cartman walks up and rips off the door handle, then walks away chuckling to himself. A few seconds later a garbage truck backs up and removes the refrigerator from the gas station]
[South Park, next day. Cartman is happily asleep in his bed and his alarm goes off.]
CARTMAN
Hah! [turns off his bear alarm clock, hops out of bed cheerfully and skips to his wall calendar he made just for the occasion.] It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday! [crosses off Tuesday on his calendar] Only three more days till Casa Bonita. I'm gonna go through Black Bart's Cave first. No! I'm gonna watch the cliff divers first! Maybe if I tell them it's my birthday, they'll let me cliff-dive in the pool! [walks off to get dressed] Oh, that would be so bad-ass!
[Park County Trash Dump, night. The refrigerator is now there and begins to heave. Butters kicks his way out of it, having run out of air.]
BUTTERS
[rises, catches his breath, and dusts himself off] Finally I can breathe a- [looks at the apparent devastation around him] Oh my God. Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It's all destroyed. Nothing left. [walks forth] Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school. Hello? [rustling sounds are heard and he tenses up in fear, then softly] Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for radioactive cannibals. [more loudly] Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma'am? [he watches, and a dog emerges from the rubble] Oh. Aww, it's a little dog. [approaches the mutt] Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky. [walks into the rubble and begins his work]
[South Park, day. On the highway, Sheila drives the boys towards their destination. All the boys are now wearing suits instead of sweaters. Stan, Cartman, and Kenny sit in the back seat.]
CARTMAN
We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon. You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.
STAN
Really?
KYLE
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
CARTMAN
[sniffs] "Pretty cool." So, um, should we go to Black Bart's Cave first or watch the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart's Cave right away 'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we'll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show.
STAN
Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do.
CARTMAN
What? Fuck Kyle. [the others look at him in astonishment] Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle.
CARTMAN
Happy Birthday to you. Happy- [looks at the other boys for support]
STAN, CARTMAN, KENNY
Birthday to you. Happy Birthday dear Kyle. Happy Birthday to you. [they pass a missing person's billboard with Butters on it and South Park PD's phone number].
[Park County Trash Dump, day. A worker drives into the dump in her truck and pulls out stuffed trash bags from the truck bed.]
BUTTERS
[off-screen] You take away the biggest part of me. [the worker listens, then goes to the source of the sound] Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please don't go. [hums a bit; the worker arrives to see him sweeping] Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan...
WORKER
Hello? [her name tag reads "Irene."]
BUTTERS
[quickly arms himself with the broom] HAAAAGH! Who are you? Are you infected?
WORKER
With what?
BUTTERS
You're not a cannibal, are you?
WORKER
No?
BUTTERS
Oh. [drops the broom and smiles] Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we can repopulate the earth. Yippee!
WORKER
Kid, what are you doin' here?
BUTTERS
I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look. [moves off to his left, she follows. They pass a row of makeshift buildings that he built overnight] This is the library, and over here is the bank. That over there I'm thinking into a P.F. Chang's or a Bennigan's. And this [a statue that reads Cartman under it] is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society. Well ma'am, I guess we should start repopulatin' the earth, huh? [promptly unzips and drops his pants, then steps forward.] I'm ready whenever you are.
WORKER
Kid, I don't know what you think is going on, but this place is a dump.
BUTTERS
Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!
WORKER
No, I mean you're at the garbage dump. The town is right over there, everybody is fine, and I think they've been looking for you for over a week.
BUTTERS
[looks at her for a long time, then looks towards the town] Oh... [realizes he's been tricked, he looks down and pulls up his pants.] Ma'am, can I use your phone?
[Casa Bonita, night. Sheila pulls into a parking space.]
CARTMAN
We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita! [the boys climb out of the car] Aw man, this is gonna be so great!
SHEILA
Wait up, Eric. We need to stay together. [Cartman stops and dances in place. A phone rings] Uh, hold on boys, that's my cell phone. [fishes it out of her purse and answers it] Hello? Yes. Oh, that's great! [to her charges] Boys, they found Butters. [Cartman stops dancing and his grin turns into panic] He's okay.
KYLE
Oh, awesome.
STAN
I knew he'd turn up.
SHEILA
Yes, Eric Cartman is with us. Why? [her face turns stern] Oh really? [Cartman looks around for a way to escape]
KYLE
What?
SHEILA
Yes, I will certainly let him know. Thank you. [hangs up and puts the phone away] Well, it appears that Eric here is responsible for Butters missing, because he wanted to go to Casa Bonita. [the anger now registers on the other boys' faces]
KYLE
What?
SHEILA
Eric, the South Park Police are already on their way here to have a little talk with you!
CARTMAN
But... Casa Bonita.
KYLE
[approaches Cartman, who turns around] I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all!
CARTMAN
[turns to face Casa Bonita] But I... [turns back] but... [suddenly takes Kyle hostage] Stand back!
STAN
Cartman, stop it!
CARTMAN
[backs up towards the restaurant with Kyle still hostage] I! Am going! To Casa! Bonita! [sirens are heard]
KYLE
It's too late, fatass. [Cartman stops] They'll be here in less than a minute.
CARTMAN
[hauls Kyle away a bit longer] Ah! Eh. Nuh! [throws him away and dashes for the entrance] Less than a minute! Less than a minute!
KYLE
[rises and turns around] Cartman!
[Casa Bonita, inside. Cartman races into the restaurant.]
CARTMAN
Oh, awesome!! [approaches a table which has a family enjoying its dinner] Excuse me, excuse me? Can I get to eat some of your- [grabs some food from both the mother's plate and the father's plate] Thank you. Thank you. [climbs over the table] Oh, I've got to get to Black Bart's Cave! [hops off and runs for the cave, barging his way past two other kids] Ah! Excuse me? Excuse me! Coming through to Black Bart's Cave! [runs in] Oh! [stops at a treasure chest with a pirate skeleton beside it] Oh, scary! Look, a skeleton! [moves on] Oh man, I'm so scared! [exits]
CARTMAN
Oh! Oh! Oh, that was awesome! Oh! Oh! Cliff divers! [rushes to them, stopping long enough to dance before the mariachi band] Come on! Come on, dive! [atop the waterfall, a cliff diver stands ready] Dive, asshole! [the diver dives into the pool below] Oh, awesome! That was cool, huh? [looks towards the entrance and sees the rest of his party and the police enter the restaurant] Whoa. [dashes for the jail set at the Photo Flash Back. He puts on the suit waiting for the next customer and looks out from behind bars. His picture is taken and he quickly jumps down from the cell. He moves on to the table he dreamt about two weeks ago] Sopapillas! Can I get some sopapillas please?! [a waitress arrives with a plate of sopapillas] Sweeet! [runs off with it and heads for a new attraction] Oh! Booth! Puppet show! Puppet show! [an officer steps in and blocks his way, he tosses his dessert away and turns back]
KYLE
Cartman! [the boys and Sheila trace his path and close in on Cartman. Cartman runs up along the side of the "cliff" until he gets to the top, where two other officers meet him]
YATES
All right, kid! End of the line!
CARTMAN
[steps left] Ah. [steps right] Uh. [moves around a bit more, then jumps off the cliff] Yeeeesss!
KYLE
Jesus Christ! [Cartman ends up face down in the water, which isn't deep enough to drown him. He flips over and coughs.
YATES
Well kid, you made an entire town panic, you lost all your friends, and now you're going to Juvenile Hall for a week! Huh, was it worth it?
CARTMAN
Totally. [smiles]
End of Casa Bonita

synopsis:A Mormon kid moves to South Park and it's up to Stan to kick his ass. But when Stan and his dad meet their new Mormon neighbors, they become fascinated with how genuinely nice they are.

script:All About Mormons

[South Park Elementary, day. In Mr. Garrison's classroom the kids enter and go for their desks.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, let's take our seats. [a blond boy stands to his left] We have a new student joining us today who has just moved here from Utah. I want you all to say hi to Gary. [Gary looks around. The kids don't say a word]
GARY
Hello everybody. It's really great to meet you all.
MR. GARRISON
Gary was state champion in wrestling AND in tennis. [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny look at each other] He also maintained a 4.0 grade point average at his old school AND has been on two national commercials for toothpaste.
GARY
I'm really excited to live in this town and share all kinds of great experiences with you, my new friends!
KYLE
[quietly, to Stan] Oh, dude, what a little asshole!
STAN
Yeah, screw that kid!
MR. GARRISON
All right, Gary, why don't you take that empty seat and we'll get started with the lesson? [Gary goes to the seat to Cartman's right as Cartman looks on with some trepidation. Once Gary is seated, Cartman lurches away from him about six inches]
GARY
[offering a handshake] Hey. My name's Gary.
CARTMAN
[falsetto] Hi. My name's Eura. Eura Fag.
GARY
[laughs] That's funny. You're cool, man.
MR. GARRISON
Okay now, who can tell me what year the first astronauts landed on the moon? [writes "Moon Landing" on the board]
GARY
[without hesitation] Oh! Oh oh oh! Nineteen sixty nine!
MR. GARRISON
Very good, Gary. Wow, looks like I don't have a class full of retards anymore, doesn't it, children? [writes "1969" on the board]
[The playground. Gary is kicking a soccer ball around. The other fourth grade boys approach and look. Shown are Craig, Butters, Kyle, Clyde, Stan, Cartman, Tolkien, Kevin, and another boy]
KYLE
Dude, that new kid is such a douche!
CARTMAN
Yeah. Somebody needs to put him in him place!
BUTTERS
He's a peckerface, that's what he is!
CARTMAN
Go kick his ass, Stan.
CLYDE
Yeah, go kick his ass.
STAN
Well, maybe he won't fight.
CARTMAN
Will he bleed? That's all we care about.
KYLE
Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe that fuckin' smirk off his face!
CRAIG
Yeah, little bitch!
STAN
All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass. [leaves]
CARTMAN
Yeah! Go Stan! Go Stan! [then, when Stan is gone, softly] All right, I've got five bucks on the other kid. Who wants in?
GARY
[looks up as Stan approaches] Oh hey there! You wanna kick the ball around with me?
STAN
No. I'm... I'm gonna kick your ass.
GARY
Excuse me?
STAN
I'm gonna kick your ass... [glances back] bitch.
GARY
How come you wanna fight me? ...Oh, I get it. I'm the new kid. [sigh] Yeah, I guess maybe I deserve it.
STAN
[off guard] Huh?
GARY
It's really tough being in a totally new place, but I think all you guys are really cool so... I understand if there's initiation rites.
STAN
Dude, stop it.
BUTTERS
[back in the crowd] Let him have it, Stan!
STAN
Shut up, Butters!
GARY
The other kids are watching. Look, do what you gotta do. I won't fight back. I just hope that maybe afterwards we can... try to be friends someday.
KYLE
[back in the crowd] What are they doing?
CARTMAN
They're just standing there, talking. [A few moments later, Stan returns defeated. He glances back at Gary, then approaches the other boys]
KYLE
What happened? [Stan glances back, then looks at Kyle]
STAN
I'm... [stares back at Gary] going over to his house for dinner tonight.
TOKEN
What?! How did that happen?
STAN
[stammering] He's a really nice kid.
CARTMAN
You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!
KYLE
You're having dinner with his family? What kind of family has a kid like that?
[Gary's house. His family is enjoying itself at the dinner table, playing a board game, "LIVING", and laughing.]
DAD
Okay, my turn. [turns a little wheel] Ooo, five! [moves his piece] One two three four five. Uh, awww, lost your mortgage, pay ten thousand dollars! Oh no! [they all laugh. Gary and Stan enter]
MOM
Hey, it's Gary!
OLDER SISTER
Gary!
OLDER BROTHER
Great to see you!
MOM
How are you?
GARY
Hey everybody! This is my new friend Stan. Stan, this is my mom and dad.
DAD
Hi Stan!
MOM
It's so nice to meet you.
GARY
[the camera pans to the older brother] And this is my brother Mark.
MARK
Hi!
GARY
[then to the older sister] My sister Jenny.
JENNY
Hey!
GARY
My little brother Dave.
DAVE
Hi!
GARY
And my baby sister Amanda.
AMANDA
[removes her pacifier] Hello Stan!
DAD
Well, it's great you could join us for Family Home Evening, Stan!
STAN
What's that?
GARY
That's when we don't allow any TV and just entertain each other with music and stories. Doesn't your family ever do that?
STAN
No.
DAD
Hey kids! Why don't you grab your instruments and play a song for Stan!
JENNY
Oh yeah!
MARK
All right! Let's play! [the kids grab their instruments. Jenny and Gary take guitars, Mark takes a trumpet, Dave takes the drums, and Amanda takes the little piano. The kids launch into song]
GARY
Yeah yeah, yeah, I love my family!
My family is the best!
If we ever have to face a challenge.
THE KIDS
My family!
GARY
Can pass the test. [the parents bounce softly to the beat. Next scene, the family is back at table for dinner. Mom comes in with a big turkey platter]
DAD
Oh boy! Who is the best Mom in the world?? [the rest of the family chatters. Next scene shows Dave juggling three balls]
MARK
All right! Go Dave!
GARY
Yeah!
JENNY, MARK
Woohoo! [next scene is Mark doing Shakespeare's "Hamlet", with skull]
MARK
Where be your gibes now? Your gambols? Your songs? [next scene is Amando in Russian dress, dancing]
THE FAMILY
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! [next scene, they're all laughing at something]
MARK
That's a great story, Sarah.
DAD
All right, kids, now how about we do some Scripture readings! From the Book of Mormon!
MARK
All right!
KIDS
Yeah!
MARK
Woohoo! OOWW!
STAN
The... Book of Mormon? What's that?
GARY
You know... the book that Joseph Smith found.
STAN
Who's Joseph Smith? [they laugh at his ignorance]
MARK
Only the most important person in the world.
JENNY
You've never heard of him?
STAN
No!
GARY
Tell us the story of Joseph Smith, Dad.
THE OTHER KIDS
Oh yes, tell us Dad. Yeah Dad. All right.
DAD
All right, you rascals. Gather round. [the kids draw closer to their dad] Joseph Smith lived in a little American town in the early 1800s.
[A little American town in the early 1800s. A man rides by in a small carriage pulled by one horse. In the distance, Joseph Smith strolls into town.]
SINGERS
Joseph Smith was called a prophet
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
He started the Mormon religion

There goes that kooky Joseph Smith.
CUSTOMER
You know, he claims he spoke with God and Jesus.
WOMAN
Well, how do you know he didn't?
SINGERS
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Joseph Smith was called a prophet-
BUTLER
Hey, Joseph! I told my wife that you spoke with God and Jesus, and she didn't believe it.
SMITH
Well it's true. I did.
WIFE
Where?
SMITH
I was out in the woods, praying [a shot of him on his knees in the woods] I was asking God if I should be a Protestant, or a Catholic, or what? And suddenly God and Jesus appeared before me. [a bright light appears before him and he shields his eyes from the glare] And they said I should start my own church, because none of the others had it right. [the flashback ends] And that's exactly how it happened.
BUTLER
You see? You believe it now?
WIFE
Well yeah, sure. Why would he make that up?
SINGERS
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Many people believed Joseph
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
And that night he-ee saw an angel
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
SMITH
[in bed inside a shack] And please bless Mother and Father, and please keep our bellies full of yum-yums and luscious goodies. [a flash of light and a glowing orb flies around the room] AAAHH! [the orb turns into an angel] Oh my gosh!
ANGEL
I am Moroni. I am a Native American.
SMITH
A... [looks at the camera] Native American? [looks at Moroni] But your skin is white.
MORONI
Yes. Long ago all Native American were white. We all came to America from Jerusalem. And while we were here we were visited by Christ.
SMITH
[looks at the camera] Jesus live here in America?
MORONI
Yes. Eventually, my people were all killed by the other tribe of Israel, and as punishment, God turned their skin red. These are the Native Americans you know today. [Smith looks at the camera dumbstruck]
SINGERS
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
MORONI
There is an ancient book buried near here, written on gold plates that account my people's lives. Also buried with the book are two seer stones, the Urim and Thummim, which will allow you to translate the writings. Find it, and fulfill your destiny. [brightens and then vanishes]

KIDS
Rice Crispy squares! Yay! All right! Rice Crispy squares!
DAD
Hey gang, let's wrap some more of them up in plastic wrap and hand them out to the poor!
GARY
Awesome! I can't wait!
JENNY
Yeah! [the family rises from the couch and leaves]
GARY
You coming, Stan?
STAN
No, I was supposed to be home at eight.
DAD
Awww, that's too bad. Well, it was really nice meeting you, Stan. [the family returns and hugs Stan]
MARK, JENNY
Bye Stan!
MOM
Great to meet you!
GARY
Bye!
[Stan's house, night. What a contrast. Randy watches TV on the couch with beer in hand, Shelly watches it on the floor, Sharon watches it from the dining table solving crossword puzzles. Stan enters upon this desolate scene.]
STAN
...Hello?
SHARON
Oh, hi Stan.
STAN
[a few seconds later] Hey Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith?
RANDY
Who?
SHELLY
Shut up, turd! We're watching Friends!
STAN
The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.
SHARON
Well, Stan, God and Jesus don't actually speak to people.
STAN
That's not what the Harrisons said.
RANDY
Who are the Harrisons?
STAN
The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right.
RANDY
Oh, did he now?! What are they, religious kooks?!
STAN
They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?
RANDY
We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger.
STAN
But that's just you and your friends.
SHELLY
I said shut up, turd!
STAN
Mr. Harrison said that I should be following Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is.
RANDY
[rises and moves towards the front door] All right, that does it!
SHARON
Where are you going?
RANDY
I'm gonna go have a talk with this "Mr. Harrison." [grabs his coat from the coat rack and puts it on] If he thinks he can fill my son's head with wacko religious crap, he's wrong! [drinks the last of his beer]
SHARON
Randy, don't cause trouble.
RANDY
Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop! I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Garrison's ass! [exits and slams the door shut, but quickly returns] This, Mr. Harrison is, is a white guy, right?
STAN
Yeah.
RANDY
[confidence restored] Yeah, I'm gonna go kick his ass! [slams the door]
[The neighborhood, night. Randy walks down the street.]
RANDY
God-damned religious kooks! Tell my son what to believe, will you?! We'll see how you like my fist in your ass! [approaches the front door of the house and pounds on the door. Gary's father answers it]
MR. HARRISON
Hello!
RANDY
Yeah, are you Mr. Harrison?
MR. HARRISON
I sure am. [offers his right hand] The, the name's Gary.
RANDY
Well, look, my kid was just over at your house and he a-
GARY SR.
Oh, you're Stan's dad! It's so nice to finally meet you! Karen! Mr. Marsh is here!
RANDY
Uh, look, I just want to tell you that
KAREN
[arrives with a tray of squares] Oh, Mr. Marsh! What a treat! It's so nice to meet you!
RANDY
Well, thanks. Uh...
GARY SR.
Karen just finished baking the most amazing Rice Crispy squares.
KAREN
With chocolate frosting
GARY SR.
Come on out of the cold. You've gotta try one. Or six. [chuckles]
[The coffee table in the living room.]
GARY SR.
I cannot tell you how wonderful it is to have you over.
KAREN
[serving lemonade] I hear you're a geologist. That is so amazing.
RANDY
Look, uh, I actually came over because I'm a little concerned about some of the things you told my son.
GARY SR., KAREN
Uh huh?
RANDY
You know. About... God, and stuff.
GARY SR.
Oooh... Oh boy... you think we were trying to convert him.
RANDY
Well, I...
GARY SR.
Oh, Mr. Marsh, I am sooo sorry.
KAREN
We just moved here from Utah and we're so used to everyone being Mormon that we... Oh, we forget not everyone wants to hear about it. Oh boy, you must be furious!
RANDY
Well, no, no, I just...
GARY SR.
You just heard your son talking about religious ideals that aren't your own and you said "Who the heck do these people think they are?!" I I'm really, truly sorry, Mr. Marsh. It won't happen again.
RANDY
Y-you can call me... Randy.
KAREN
Randy, the last thing we want is for people to think we're pushing our religion. We know there are a lot of beliefs out there and ours just works for us.
GARY SR.
To each his own, right?
RANDY
Yeah. Yeah! You know, to be honest, I've never known any Mormons. I, don't even know what you people believe. Who was this Joseph Smith guy? Why did he believe that Native Americans are actually white people from Jerusalem?
GARY SR.
Well, because they found ancient books they had written on gold plates, right where the angel Moroni said they would be.
[The Early 1800s, day, a small town. People mill around.]
SMITH
I found them! I found them! [people turn and look, and he stops] You're not gonna believe it, everybody! I found them!
BUTLER
Found what?
SMITH
Another New Testament of Jesus Christ!
PEOPLE
What? What did he say? Are you crazy?
SMITH
Last night, a Native America angel told me where I could find another testament of Jesus Christ, so I went out to the woods. I dug around all morning where the angel had told me to look. [a shot of Smith digging yet another hole].
SMITH
Maybe there isn't anything out here. [strikes something hard] Wait a tick! [throws the shovel off to the side] What's this? [starts digging and find a tiny coffin, then removes the lid] Wow...
SMITH
[back to the story] Inside the stone box, I found the magical seer stones. Under that, I found four gold plates written in strange writing [he lifts up two of them].
SMITH
This must be the Gospel that Jesus told the Nephites!
SMITH
Well, they were the most amazing things I'd ever gazed upon.
MAN
[middle-aged] Well, so where are they?
SMITH
Where are what?
WOMAN
The gold plates and the seer stones. Where are they?
SMITH
Oh, well, I... was not allowed to take them. You see, after I found the plates, the angel Moroni appeared to me again and said that I am not allowed to show the plates, or the seer stones, to anybody. Because first I must translate what's written on the plates into English, so you can all read it!
SINGERS
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.
PEOPLE
Wow, amazing!
SINGERS
He found the stones and golden plates
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Even though nobody else ever saw them
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
[The Marsh house. Sharon and Shelly are at their spots, Stan sits on the couch, all three watch TV. Randy returns with a Book of Mormon in hand.]
SHARON
So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass?
RANDY
Not exactly. We're uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night.
STAN
See? That's what happened to me!
RANDY
Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a new testament to the Bible buried here in America?
SHARON
What are you talking about?
RANDY
Well it's just that... the Harrisons are really nice people and... you should see how loving and together their family is. I, I think there's something to that religion.
STAN
That's what they made me think, too!
RANDY
All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon!
[The neighborhood, day. In front of Kyle's house Kyle, Kenny and Cartman are tossing a football around. Stan arrives. Cartman catches the football and approaches Stan.]
CARTMAN
Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid?
STAN
Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented.
CARTMAN
[cooing] Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love.
KYLE
Yeah. Did you make out with him, too?
STAN
What's the big deal? Can't I have other friends? You guys should give Gary a chance.
GARY
[arrives] Hey Stan.
CARTMAN
Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now.
GARY
Hey guys. Stan, I remember you said last night that you'd lost your wallet, so I made you a new one. [hands Stan a brown leather wallet] I carved a picture of John Elway into the leather on the front.
STAN
Wow, you made this?
CARTMAN
[playing it up] Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together?
GARY
Hey! My family's on their way over to the fire station to donate blood. You wanna come along? [Cartman gags.]
STAN
Uh, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh... [a car horn is heard]
GARY
Oh here comes my family now!
THE HARRISONS
Hey you guys! [they get out of the car]
KAREN
Look, we painted our faces! [they laugh]
MARK
I'm a lion. [scratches the air like a lion might]
JENNY
I'm an alien. [green face paint]
GARY SR.
Hey, just what the heck am I supposed to be? [they laugh]
CARTMAN
Oh my God...
DAVE
[a piglet] You gonna come with us to the fire station, Stan?
STAN
[fumbling about] Uh, no. I've got a lot to do.
GARY SR.
Well... Gary, you wanna just hang out with your friend Stan?
GARY
Oh. Well, I'd like to, but... Oh man, I would miss you guys so much!
MARK
We'd miss you too, Gary. Heh.
KAREN
Aw, we'll all see each other tonight when we go to Stan's house for dinner. Stay and play with your friend, Gary.
GARY SR.
Yeah. Have a good time, boys. [the family laughs and gets inside the car]
MARK
Let's go. [the doors close and they drive off] Our faces are painted. [more laughter]
KYLE
Wow!
GARY
So what do you guys wanna do?
CARTMAN
[backs away a bit with Kyle and Kenny] Uh, that's cool. We're gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. The three of us have to go put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter. [looks at the other two. All three move off to their left and leave]
GARY
Oh cool! I'm gonna do that tomorrow.
CARTMAN
Eeheehee, Jesus Christ. [an awkward moment between Gary and Stan follows]
GARY
So hey, I heard your dad came over last night and he and my dad talked about Joseph Smith. That's great!
STAN
[turns right and walks. Gary walks alongside] Yeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy.
GARY
Sure.
STAN
What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground?
GARY
Well, he kept them hidden from everyone like he was told. And then he translated what was written on the plates into the Book of Mormon.
STAN
Yeah, but... how?
[Back to the 1800s, night. Joseph Smith and another man walk up into the attic of a large building.]
SINGERS
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
MAN
What's this all about, Mr. Smith?
SMITH
Mr. Harris, can you keep a secret?
HARRIS
Well, sure I can.
SMITH
I have, in my possession, an ancient book written on gold plates that tells of Jesus Christ's second coming. Here, in America.
HARRIS
In America? [scratches his head] Really? That sounds kind of...
SINGERS
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
SMITH
It's true. And I'm going to translate the plates and publish it into a book for the whole world to read. Now, ahah-I know you have a lot of money, Mr. Harris, and I'm just gonna need a little bit to pay for the publishing costs.
HARRIS
Mmm, I don't know. Uh, how do you expect to translate it?
SMITH
With these. [presents the seer stones]
HARRIS
Rocks?
SMITH
They're not rocks. They're seer stones, given to me by an angel. With them, God allowed me to translate the plates into English. Watch. You take this quill and paper and write down what I say. Sit here. [on the floor, by some sheets of paper and a quill pen in an ink well] I have the golden plates here in this hat. I need to have them somewhere dark so I can read the spiritual light.
HARRIS
Really?
SMITH
Now, when I put the seer stones into the hat, the ancient letter light up and change into English, which I can then read to you.
HARRIS
Wow! [Smith looks down and lowers his head so the face is buried in the hat]
SMITH
Ooo, I'm seeing the light. Oh, okay. Write this down. "And... so... it... was... that... Christ... appeared before... the... Nephites."
SINGERS
And that's how the Book of Mormon was written
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dumb dadumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dumb dadumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dahumb dahumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dumb dumb dumb dumb duuumb, duuumb.
[The Marsh house, night. At the dining table they're playing the same board game the Harrisons were playing a few nights before: "LIVING".]
RANDY
One two three four. "Pay one thousand dollars property tax." [pays the property tax] Isn't this great, you guys? Our first Family Home Evening.
SHELLY
I wanna watch TV.
RANDY
We're not watching TV! We're Mormons now and we're having Family Home Evening!
STAN
Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?
RANDY
And? [to Sharon] Your turn, Sharon.
STAN
It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.
RANDY
Yes.
STAN
But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.
RANDY
Well you can't believe everything school tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelly. [the doorbell rings] Oooo, that must be the Harrisons! [rises and goes to the front door. He opens and the Harrisons walk in with enthusiasm, chatting away]
GARY
Hey everybody.
MARK
[walks around] Wow, what a great house!
KAREN
[walks up to Sharon] You must be Mrs. Marsh; it's so nice to meet you!
JENNY
[walks up to Shelly] And you must be Stan's sister. Oh, I think your brother's the greatest.
SHELLY
My brother is a stupid turd.
GARY
[walks up to Stan] Hey Stan.
STAN
[with reservations] Hey Gary.
RANDY
Well, come on in and sit down, everybody. [they all settle in on the couches in the living room. Shelly avoids looking at the Harrisons] You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion.
STAN
Dad!
GARY SR.
Ohohoho, really? Well, that's just because he hasn't heard the best part about the Joseph Smith story! The one that proves he was for real!
THE HARRISONS
Yeah! Woohoo!
RANDY
Ooo, what's that?
GARY SR.
Well, you remember Martin Harris, the rich man who wrote down what Joseph Smith read out of the hat?
STAN
Yeah.
GARY SR.
See, after he was done, he took some of the pages of what would become the Book of Mormon home.
[Back to the 1800s, night, the large building.]
SINGERS
Martin went home to his wife
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
And showed her pages from the Book of Mormon
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
HARRIS
A-and so Joseph Smith put his head into a hat, a-and read to me what the golden plates said. I wrote it all down and we're gonna publish it into a book.
MRS. HARRIS
Martin, how do you know he isn't just making stuff up and pretending he's translating off golden plates?
SINGERS
Lucy Harris smart smart smart
Smart smart smart smart smart
HARRIS
Why would he make it up?
SINGERS
Martin Harris dumb dadumb-
LUCY
All right, here. I'm gonna hide these pages. [puts them in a drawer at the bottom end of an armoir] If Joseph Smith really is translating off of golden plates, then he'll be able to do it again. But if Joseph Smith is making it all up, then the new translations will be different from these.
HARRIS
Okay, fine. I bet he'll have no problem. [puts on his coat and heads out]
SINGERS
Lucy Harris smart smart smart
Martin Harris dumb.
So Martin went on back to Smith
Said the pages had gone away
Smith got mad and told Martin
He needed to go pray
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
HARRIS
[upon Smith's return] Look, ah I'm sorry about losin' the pages we worked on, Joe, but I'm ready to write it all down again if you translate from the plates.
SMITH
I would love to, Martin, except, I just had a vision. And the Lord said he's very angry with me for letting you take those pages.
HARRIS
[gasps] He is??
SINGERS
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
SMITH
Yes. He is so mad that he will never let me translate from the plate of Lehi again. He's... we must now translate from the plate of Nephi. So it will be the same basic story, but written a little differently.
HARRIS
Wow! If God got angry with you, then you must be tellin' the truth.
SINGERS
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.
HARRIS
All right, Martin. Let's get to work! [Smith reads from the hat again and dictates to Harris, who writes it all down]
[Back to the present, the Marsh house.]
GARY SR.
And that's how it happened.
KIDS
Yeah! All right! [the Marshes sit there without a word to say]
STAN
...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?
GARY SR.
Well sure. The story proves it, doesn't it?
STAN
No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind?
MARK
Well, Stan, it's all a matter of faith.
STAN
No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translations were hidden!
RANDY
Hey, Stan, don't denounce our religion.
STAN
[crosses his arms] I don't wanna be Mormon, Dad!
SHELLY
Me neither.
GARY
Hey, that's only cool, guys. You can believe whatever you want!
GARY SR.
Yeah, it's great you have your own beliefs.
GARY
Yeah! Hooray for the Marshes!
STAN
Oh, stop it! [stands up] That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!
RANDY
Yeah! [moments later they are standing outside, and the door is slammed on their faces. They turn around, and Gary Sr. sighs]
GARY SR.
Well kids... Who's up for a water balloon fight?!
KIDS
Yeah! All right! [they leave the Marsh house in high spirits, except Gary, who looks insulted]
[The bus stop, next day. Kyle, Cartman and Kenny wait for the bus, Stan walks up somewhat somberly.]
KYLE
Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary?
STAN
I'm not hanging around that kid anymore.
CARTMAN
[needling] Oh no! You guys broke up?
STAN
You guys were right, okay? The new kid's a douche. Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me.
GARY
[shows up] Hey Stan.
STAN
Oh brother.
CARTMAN
Uh oh, the jilted lover returns.
GARY
Listen, I just wanted to let you know you don't have to worry about me tryin' to be your friend anymore.
STAN
I don't?
GARY
Look, maybe us Mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense, and maybe Joseph Smith did make it all up, but I have a great life. and a great family, and I have the Book of Mormon to thank for that. The truth is, I don't care if Joseph Smith made it all up, because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people. And even though people in this town might think that's stupid, I still choose to believe in it. All I ever did was try to be your friend, Stan, but you're so high and mighty you couldn't look past my religion and just be my friend back. You've got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck my balls. [turns around and walks off. All four boys just look at him in wonder.]
CARTMAN
Damn, that kid is cool, huh?
End of All About Mormons


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:After singing and dancing representatives from an anti-smoking campaign rap about the dangers of smoking, the kids at South Park Elementary realize how cool it really is and take up the habit.

script:Butt Out

[South Park Elementary, gymnasium, day. A school meeting is called and kids file in. Between two basketball backboards hangs a blue banner with the words "BUTT OUT!" The O doubles as a no-smoking symbol. There's plenty of chatter in the gym.]
MR. MACKEY
[off-screen] M'kay, kids, can I have it quiet, please? M'kay? M'kay, quiet now, the assembly's about to start, m'kay. M'kay, quiet ple-mk-m'kay? [Mr. Garrison approaches him, takes the microphone and puts it against one of the massive speakers, creating a loud feedback loop. The kids scream in pain as Mr. Garrison returns the mic to Mr. Mackey.] M'kay. Uh, now kids, we have a really fun motivational group today who are gonna talk to you about the dangers of smoking, m'kay? So please give a very big South Park Cows welcome to, "Butt Out!" [music starts up and a very enthusiastic troupe dashes out from behind the speakers and multi-screen monitor. After some chatter they begin to sing]
BUTT OUT!
Butt out! Yeah yeah! Kids, that cigarette butt is gross!
Butt out! Uh huh! Smokin's got to go! [the music stops and the troupe members strike poses]
KYLE
[rolls his eyes] Oh no...
BUTT OUT!
Yeah! All right! Woohoo!!
BUTT OUT! LADY
Hey students, how are we all feelin' today? Woooo! [not a sound emanates from the student audience]
BUTT OUT! MAN 1
[steps forth] Hey, did you guys know that each year over six hundred thousand people a year die from smoking? A year!
BUTT OUT! MAN 2
[steps forth] Six hundred thousand?? Are you sure you're not just blowing smoke? [the troupe members laugh]
BUTT OUT! LADY
Blow smoke? Us? No way! Because we don't need to smoke and neither do you, right kids? Butt out! Break it down! [a rap begins. The third male trouper becomes a human beat box.]
BUTT OUT!
Butt out! Yeah yeah! It's cool to say no!
Butt out! Uh huh! Smokin's got to go!
BUTT OUT! MAN 3
[steps forward and begins his beat box, just a bunch of utterances including] Smoking, no. No smoking. [ends his bit and backs up]
BUTT OUT! MAN 2
Freestyle!
BUTT OUT! LADY
Vernon! [The first of the Butt Out! males steps forth while the third one resumes his beat box]
VERNON
Don't smoke! Don't ever smoke!
BUTT OUT!
Kyle! [Vernon steps back into the line, the second But Out! male steps forth]
BUTT OUT!'S KYLE
B to the U to the T to the T to the O to the U to the T to the C to the I to the G to the A to the R to the E to the T to the T to the E! Butt out, cigarette!
KYLE
Dude, this is unbearable.
CARTMAN
I'm going to kill myself. [return to the rap, which soon ends and Butt Out!'s Kyle goes back in line]
BUTT OUT!
Randy!
BUTT OUT!'S RANDY
[steps forth] Smoke you know has got to go. You go, you got to know to say the "no" to the smoke, you go go.. [Stan holds his nose, grimaces and sighs heavily] ... you gotta get it!
BUTT OUT!
Pam!
PAM
[steps forth and makes like a diesel truck pulling to a stop. In a screeching voice she says] Dooooonttt smooooke.
BUTT OUT!
Woohoo! [she goes back into the line]
CARTMAN
You guys, Kenny's eating his own hand. [Kenny's chewing on his left hand. Stan and Kyle are half asleep]
BUTT OUT!'S KYLE
Hey! What's the big deal? I like smoking, and it makes me cool! [turns his hat around so it's on backwards, and strikes a pose]
PAM
Oh, really?? Do you think lung cancer is cool, too?? [Butt Out!'s Kyle strikes a surprised pose]
BUTT OUT!'S RANDY
What about emphysema?? Is that cool?? [Butt Out!'s Kyle clasps his hands together]
VERNON
And what about abortion, and AIDS? [Butt Out!'s Kyle slumps]
BUTT OUT!'S RANDY
Pfft! That's none's the cool.
PAM
Word.
VERNON
Yeah. So butt out! [Butt Out!'s Kyle turns his hat back around]
BUTT OUT!
Butt out! Yeah yeah! Give that cigarette butt a throw!
STAN
[rolls eyes] Ugh, Jesus Christ! [Cartman has his hands buried in his face]
BUTT OUT!
Butt out! Uh huh! Smokin's got to go!
VERNON
Remember, kids, if you smoke, you could grow up to be a failure.
PAM
Worse yet, you could grow up to be dead. [collapses into Vernon's arms. He stands her up again]
BUTT OUT!'S KYLE
So don't believe what those evil tobacco companies tell you!
BUTT OUT!'S RANDY
Yeah, because if you don't smoke, you can grow up to be-
BUTT OUT!
[strikes one final pose] Just Like Us. [the boys look at each other, not quite sure what to make of that]
[South Park Elementary, loading area. The boys are there next to a trash bin, smoking ... and coughing.]
STAN
Give me a hit. Give me another one, give me another one. [takes a cigarette from Kyle's pack, lights up, and puffs]
KYLE
Aw dude, this is really hard.
CARTMAN
Oh shit, here comes Mr. Mackey. [the boys quickly turn away and toss the cigarettes and lighter into the trash bin]
KYLE
Throw 'em away! [the boys' faces are red. Kyle glances back] Dudes, here he comes. Guys, stop coughing. [the boys stifle their coughs as Mr. Mackey draws near.]
MR. MACKEY
[stops, then walks around to face the boys] Boys, what are you doing back here? [the boys try their best to keep their coughs in check] I asked you a question: What are you doing back here, 'k?!
CARTMAN
[in clipped tones] Nothing.
MR. MACKEY
What??
CARTMAN
Nothin' Na- Due-nothing. [moments later Stan sneezes, and a large amount of snot ends up on his face and jacket]
KYLE
[looks] D'awww sick! [Stan coughs and tries to cover his mouth]
CARTMAN
Gross dude! [with the stifles broken, the boys resume coughing]
MR. MACKEY
Well hey, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you boys have been smoking!
CARTMAN
No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don't have any cigarettes.
MR. MACKEY
Well you'd better not! Because let me tell you some'n' about smokin'! [a burst of flame appears in the trash bin] Uh, smokin's bad, m'kay. [the boys look a bit alarmed] And uh, if you start smokin' at an early age, m'kay, it's gonna be bad. [the wall behind the bin and one of the posts holding up the awning over the loading dock burst into flame. The boys are getting scared. More of the wall bursts into flames and the flames begin to enter classrooms] M'kay, because uh, smoking can lead to all kinds of health problems like cancer. [the rest of the awning bursts into flames and flames appear at the bottom of the roll-away security door] M'kay, and let me tell you something about cancer, m'kay. Cancer's bad. M'kay, and uh, eh, what? [sniffs] What the? [turns around] Holy shit! M'kay?! [the fire alarm goes off and the school empties out the front door. Mr. Garrison, Mr. Adler, Ms. Choise, and Mr. Slave are all seen]
MR. SLAVE
Oh! Jesus Christ! [time-lapse a few hours. The school has been gutted by the flames and firefighters clean up. Police are present for crowd control. Mr. Mackey is none too pleased]
STAN
...Whoops.
[The Principal's office, Only the door and the desk remain. The bookshelves are burnt up except for the bottom shelf. The cabinets are charred. The desk is charred and two of its legs are burnt off.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[seated behind her desk] Well, you boys have certainly done it this time!
CARTMAN
We're sorry.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Not as sorry as you're going to be when your parents get here! Ah, here they come now. [sure enough, their parents can be seen approaching through the ruins]
KYLE
Oh God... [looks down. One of the parents knocks.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Come on in. [Randy opens the door and the parents enter]
SHARON
Stanley, what did you do this time?!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
You'd better brace yourself, parents. The boys were caught... smoking!
SHEILA
Smoking?
SHARON
No, it can't be! My son is not a filthy smoker! [begins to sob. Randy holds her]
STAN
Mom... [Randy holds her tight] Dad, it was just a-
RANDY
I don't have a son!
LIANE
Eric, you've done a lot of horrible things in your life, but smoking? You're grounded for three weeks!
CARTMAN
Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding me?
GERALD
Haven't you boys heard anything about how harmful smoking is to you and those around you?
SHEILA
Of course they haven't, because the tobacco companies have gotten to them first. This is really their fault.
KYLE
[seizing the opportunity] Yeah. This is really their fault.
SHEILA
No matter how much money the anti-smoking groups spend, the tobacco companies are there to fill our children's heads with lies and propaganda that make them wanna smoke.
CARTMAN
[agreeing] Yeah, huh? [launches into a small demonstration] It-it's like the tobacco companies have control of my mind- No. Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies... making me want to smoke. Ah!
LIANE
Oh my goodness, I had no idea. [kneels next to him] Are you okay, sweetie?
RANDY
Well, those God-damned tobacco companies aren't gonna have control over MY kid! I say we bring them down!
SHEILA
We need the help of the greatest anti-smoking celebrity that ever lived. Rob Reiner.
KYLE
[to Stan] Who's Rob Reiner?
[Rob Reiner's Smoke Stoppers, day. A blue skyscraper flanked by two taller blue towers, with the Hollywood sign in the background. Inside, Rob Reiner speaks to four executives, but he's facing the window. He's reading from some papers.]
ROB REINER
[breathless, dabs his forehead] I don't understand it. I pushed a law for higher taxes on cigarettes, I lobbied to get images of cigarettes removed from movies and art, I forced smokers out of bars and parks, but still I get letters from parents saying their kids are doin' it. [puts the papers on the desk, unwraps a triple cheeseburger, starts eating it, and sits down at his desk] Apparently, people still don't understand how bad smoking people is for them. Don't they know how dangerous it is to their health? [dabs his forehead] Don't they know the hazard of second-hand smoke?
EXECUTIVE 1
According to the letter, sir, the town has a tobacco company quite near them.
ROB REINER
Yeah, that must be it. [dabs his forehead] The tobacco companies, with their millions of dollars and their slick desks and fancy buildings, [the camera pulls out to show the slick desk and fancy building Reiner is in. Reiner dabs his forehead again] they're the ones making music wanna smoke! [dabs his forehead again, opens another triple cheeseburger and begins munching on that] They're the ones hurting our nation's health! I will not stand by and see the children of America corrupted by those bastards! [dabs his forehead] This is war!!
[South Park City Hall, day. People have gathered to greet Reiner when he arrives, and some people have signs saying the same thing as the banner. Other signs say "THANKS ROB!!", "Welcome MEATHEAD!" and "Give 'em hell REINER!" Stan and friends wait by the front door.]
KYLE
You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke.
STAN
What??
CARTMAN
Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us.
STAN
Yeah, what's the problem?
KYLE
Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now?
CARTMAN
Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you?
STAN
Yeah, don't worry dude. Things aren't gonna get out of hand.
MR. GARRISON
Here he comes! [Two Smoke Stoppers vans and a big rig pull up to City Hall. Rob Reiner follows in a Cadillac, which stops at the walkway leading up to the front door. Reiner opens the door and tries to get out, but he's too big to fit through.]
ROB REINER
[after a few grunts] Damnit. [struggles some more, but fails to move any] Butter! [the driver glances back] Butter! [the driver exits the car and walks around the front]
MR. GARRISON
What'd he say?
ROB REINER
Butter!! [the driver arrives with a bucket of butter. Rob Reiner grabs a bunch of it and butters himself up. The driver leaves with the butter as Reiner rubs the last of it against the seat of his pants. Reiner struggles once more and pops out of the car, falling to the ground. He stumbles, then rises and stumbles again. This time he stands up and raises his hands in victory. This raises his sweater, and his belly is exposed. He notices this and lowers his sweater. He raises his hands again and his sweater rises. He lowers his hands and walks up to the dais. The mic transmits his breathlessness as he dabs his forehead. His cheeks are rosy from the heat leaving his head] Hello South Park!! [the crowd cheers, the boys look at each other] It is so nice to see an entire town come together to fight for good health! And I'm gonna help ya! [the crowd cheers] These poor innocent children have been seduced into smoking tobacco. So I say, "We fight fire with fire!" We're gonna use these children to bring the tobacco companies down! [someone shoots some confetti in the air and it rains down over everybody.]
KYLE
Oh no...
[The town bar. Reiner sits at a booth with the boys, feverishly eating. A waitress comes up with a platter of cheeseburgers and fries.]
ROB REINER
Alright kids, here's what we're gonna do. [the waitress replaces a cleared platter with the newly loaded one] We're gonna sneak you into the tobacco company by saying you kids want a tour for a school paper. [begins eating the burgers and dabs his head] Once you're inside, mm, mm, I'm gonna take photos and then we'll publish them, saying that the tobacco company invited you over to seduce you into smoking. Got it?
CARTMAN
Got it! [Stan and Kyle look at each other]
KYLE
But... isn't that, kind of, lying?
ROB REINER
Uh, we're just leveling out the playing field. [dabs his forehead] The tobacco companies lie to you about the dangers of smoking. If we're gonna take them down, we've gotta lie right back! [begins to sniff around after detecting cigarette smoke, then focuses in on the source. The boys look as well. The source is a man wearing a Buds Light Beer hat, enjoying a drink and a smoke at the bar] Oh my God! [coughs loudly, but fails to get the man's attention. He rises from the booth and walks up to the smoker] Excuse me!
BUDS MAN
Yes?
ROB REINER
Would you mind putting that death stick out?!
BUDS MAN
But, uh, this is a bar.
ROB REINER
Isn't smoking illegal in bars here?
BARTENDER
Not in Colorado.
ROB REINER
Oh my God! What kind of backward hick state is this?!
BUDS MAN
Look man, I work fourteen hours a day at the saw mill. I just got off work and I need to relax.
ROB REINER
Well when I relax I just go to my vacation house in Hawaii!
BUDS MAN
[getting irritated] I ain't got a vacation house in Hawaii!
ROB REINER
Your vacation house in Mexico, then, whatever it is! Look, you are putting my life and these boys' lives in danger by smoking that in here! And I'm not gonna tolerate it! I will end smoking in bars in Colorado! There will be no more smoking here!
[Back at the table...]
CARTMAN
[impressed] Isn't he awesome, you guys?
KYLE
What??
CARTMAN
Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He's my idol. [pics up an onion ring and munches on it]
[Big Tobacco Co., day. Reiner and the boys approach the front door.]
ROB REINER
[turns to face the boys] All right boys, just do what I tell ya and we'll be able to sue this tobacco company for two billion dollars! [pulls out a drumstick from his sack and starts eating it] As soon as we get into the main facility, I'll snap the photo of you kids, and we can all run out! Think you can handle it?
CARTMAN
Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd handle my grandpa's balls, sir.
ROB REINER
Heh, great. [opens the sack and pulls out a costume] Okay, now watch yourselves, kids. These tobacco company people will do anything to get you hooked on smoking. They are liars and they are frauds!
[Big Tobacco Co., headquarters. A door opens and closes.]
RECEPTIONIST
Can I help you?
ROB REINER
[now dressed in the costume he pulled out] Yes. My name is Rita Poon. I called about my boys wanting a tour.
EXECUTIVE
[enters the scene] Ah, yes, Mrs. Poon. My name's Kevin Harris and I'm the vice president of Big Tobacco.
ROB REINER
Oh. Hello, Mr. Harris.
KEVIN HARRIS
Well, come on in. [motions the group to a hallway, which they enter] How about a little history first? [stops by a portrait of Indians seated around a campfire] Native Americans were the first to cultivate the tobacco plant. They smoked it in pipes for medicinal and ceremonial purposes.
ROB REINER
[mutters] Not if I were around, they wouldn't have.
KEVIN HARRIS
Excuse me?
ROB REINER
Oh, nothing! Please continue.
KEVIN HARRIS
The first successful commercial crop of tobacco was cultivated in Virginia in 1612. [stops by a portrait of Pilgrims harvesting the crop] Within seven years it was one of the country's largest exports.
KYLE
So, tobacco helped to build America.
KEVIN HARRIS
That's right. Over the next few centuries the tobacco business was so great that many slaves were brought from Africa to help work the fields.
CARTMAN
[strokes his chin] Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today.
KEVIN HARRIS
[moves on] And so for centuries, tobacco production flourished. Nobody was even aware of any dangers back then, until, in 1965, [stops at a framed tobacco warning] when Congress passed an act forcing all tobacco companies to put the Surgeon General's warning on their packages. So now, everyone knows the dangers of smoking. And some people still choose to do it, and we believe that's what being an American is all about.
KYLE
That sounds perfectly reasonable.
KEVIN HARRIS
And here's our factory at work. [opens the double doors to the factory. The workers begin to sing. Some of them scoop tobacco plants into large tanks. Other collect minced leaves into large wheelbarrows, others keep inventory. They break into song and dance near the end of the song]
FACTORY WORKERS
With a hidey lidey lidey and a hidey lidey lay
We work and we make cigarettes all hidey lidey day
So folks can get a breaky from their stressful lidey lives
And relaxy with the cigarettes we make all day and night
YOUNG WORKER
I like to have a cigarette every now and then [turns around]
It makes me fee-l calmer when the day is at an end. [hops onto the wheelbarrow and rides away]
OLDER WORKER
And if it gives me cancer when I'm eighty I don't care
Who the hell wants to be ninety anyway.
FACTORY WORKERS
So with a hidey lidey lidey and a hidey lidey lay
We work and we make cigarettes all hidey lidey day
So folks can get a breaky from their stressful lidey lives
And relaxy with the cigarettes we make all day and night
KEVIN HARRIS
Well, I guess that's the end of our tour.
ROB REINER
Oh, here boys. Let me get your picture. [the boys turn around and Reiner takes the picture] Got it! Ha! You bastards are going down now!
KEVIN HARRIS
What??
ROB REINER
I'm not Rita Poon! I'm Rob Reiner! [takes off the wig] And you've just been Reinered! Come on boys, let's make our escape! [makes a dash for the exit. A worker with a cart of cases of cigarettes is gong about his business] Don't you try and stop us! [he smacks the worker, who goes down cold. He runs further on and picks up another worker over his head, then throws him down onto the floor below. The other workers panic]
KEVIN HARRIS
[looks down at the mayhem] Oh my God!
[Temporary Smoke Stoppers offices, night. Reiner and the boys arrive.]
ROB REINER
Hoh boy, that was great, kids.
STAN
Those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice.
ROB REINER
Hah, you see that? They got into your head. Now you kids can meet some good, decent people, the folks who work to get smoking banned!
[Temporary Smoke Stoppers offices, interior. The workers there walk around like zombies, or Igor, Dr. Frankenstein's helper. They make grunts as they pass each other. The woman runs off and the man chases after her.]
ROB REINER
[walks across the room towards a table laden with burgers] This is how we get rid of smokers. [approaches and grabs a burger] We go state to state and do things like, use bogus studies and make extensive commercials to get the public on our side and force cigarette smokers to stop!
CARTMAN
Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them. [cuddles up to Reiner] You are so awesome.
ROB REINER
[walks up to an employee and hands him the camera. The worker hooks it up to his computer] Here you go Bob. [Explains to the boys] This is Mr. Baffrey. He does all our Photoshop work. [the screen is shown with a picture loading behind a download progress bar] Now, all we have to do is Photoshop cigarettes into your hands! [Baffrey places cigarettes into the boys' hands] And bingo! When this hits the papers the tobacco company is screwed! Hahahaha! [Baffrey joins in the laughter]
KYLE
But dude, you're making stuff up.
ROB REINER
[munching on another burger] You kids need to understand something, okay? Sometimes lying is okay. Like, when you know what's good for people more than they do.
CARTMAN
Oh my God, that is what I've always said. [motions to Reiner] I love this guy!
WORKER
[walks in with a news feed] Mr. Reiner, your bill to have smoking outlawed at bars here didn't pass.
ROB REINER
What?! [grabs the news feed the worker was holding] God-damnit, what the hell is wrong with people in this state?!
WORKER
Apparently, several people here still believe there's no proof second-hand smoke can kill you.
ROB REINER
Well they want proof?! All right, we'll give them proof! Boys, I need one of you to act in a commercial for us! We'll shoot it tomorrow!
CARTMAN
[eagerly] Wow, a commercial?
ROB REINER
And you boys decide which one of you will be best for the part. All right people, we've gotta get moving on the bill to ban smoking in Potsdam! Let's go!
CARTMAN
God, he's just the best! [rushes off to follow Reiner] Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps?
[Outside the tent. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny rush out of there and stop some distance away from it.]
KYLE
Guys, I think we should bail out of this right now!
STAN
Huh?
KYLE
This is just startin' to look like another one of those times where it-it's gonna end up with the whole town turning out, it's a big showdown happening, and us havin' to talk about what we learned, and I say we just stop right now, and go play cards or something.
KENNY
(Well yep, that's what I think.)
STAN
Yeah, maybe you're right. [Cartman walks out and catches up to the others]
CARTMAN
So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!
KYLE
Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial.
CARTMAN
[confused] Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle?
KYLE
No, we really want nothing more to do with these people.
CARTMAN
Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say next. You're gonna say, "How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?" And then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew double bluff and it ain't [poke] gonna [poke] work [poke] on [poke] me [poke] ha [poke] ha [poke] ha [poke]. Only one of us can be in the commercial, gentlemen. The game... is on. [leaves]
[Kyle's house, night. Cartman climbs up to the second story and opens a window at the end of the hallway. He carries with him a bunch of lumber, a hammer, and some nails. He approaches Kyle's door and gets to work hammering the lumber in place over the door.]
CARTMAN
Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now. [Cartman forgets that hallway doors open in to their respective rooms] Hahahahaha! Haa haa hahahahahaha! Haa haa haha- [Kyle appears next to him with a glass of water]
KYLE
What are you doing? [Cartman snaps his head around and looks]
CARTMAN
[drops his hammer in this awkward moment] Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man. Wait, this isn't my house.
KYLE
Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous. [walks around Cartman, opens the door, goes under lumber obstruction, enters the bedroom, then closes the door. Cartman is a bit surprised]
CARTMAN
Hahahahahaha! [resumes hammering] Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha!
[Temporary Smoke Stoppers offices, day. Cartman is at the photo shoot getting makeup, being prepped for the shot.]
ROB REINER
Okay Eric, this is going to be real simple. All you gotta do is read the words on the Teleprompter here. [motions to the monitor to his right, which has the Teleprompter ready to go]
CARTMAN
[giddily] Heh, okay. [the make-up crew leave]
ROB REINER
Let's see how the tobacco companies deal with this. [settles into his director's chair] All right, roll camera. Roll the TelePrompTer. And whenever you're ready, Eric.
CARTMAN
Heh, okay, okay. [takes a deep breath, then strikes a somber pose] You know, some people say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. The tobacco companies say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. I've just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm the proof. The next time you want to believe that second-hand smoke doesn't kill, think about me. Because, by the time you see this commercial, I'll be... dead. [takes a closer look at that last line, then looks at Reiner] Dead??
ROB REINER
And cut! Great! We got it! Wrap it up, people. That was fantastic.
CARTMAN
Uh what... what does that mean, "I'll be dead"? Hey, uh what, what was that "dead" part?
SCARY ASSISTANT
That was very good, Eric. Here, eat this cupcake.
CARTMAN
Uh, nnno, thanks. I'm not hungry.
SCARY ASSISTANT
But you are. Just eat this one cupcake. It has... sprinkles.
CARTMAN
[pushes the cupcake away] I'm not eating the cupcake.
ROB REINER
[approaches Eric] Eric, do you know what a hero is? A hero is somebody who sacrifices himself for the good of others. You can be a hero, Eric. All you have to do... is eat the cupcake. [the scary assistant moves it towards Eric's mouth again]
CARTMAN
[realizes what the words he said mean and bolts from the stool] Jesus Christ! HAAAA!
ROB REINER
[gives chase] Hey! [Eric runs out a side door, Reiner follows close behind]
[Stan's house. The other boys are in the dining room playing cards. Cartman opens the door, runs in, and closes it quick. He then goes to a window and looks to see if he's being followed.]
STAN
What are you doing, Cartman?
CARTMAN
They're going to kill me! [walks to the other window and looks out]
KYLE
Who's going to kill you?
CARTMAN
The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!!
STAN
[pushes away from the table] Well, get away from us then.
KYLE
Yeah dude, don't get us killed too. [the boys leave the table]
CARTMAN
[draws close] You guys have to help me!
KYLE
[the other boys back away] No dude, get away!
CARTMAN
[draws close] Please, you guys, I don't know what to do!
STAN
Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own!
CARTMAN
If I go, you guys go!
STAN
Daaaad!
RANDY
[enters from the kitchen] What?
STAN
Anti-smoking people are trying to kill Cartman and he won't stay away from us!
RANDY
Don't be ridiculous, boys. The anti-smoking people are kind, caring, and intelligent. Your heads have just been corrupted by the lies of the big tobacco companies. [turns around and goes back into the kitchen]
CARTMAN
Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us! [the boys keep their distance]
STAN
Help you, fatass! We weren't in the commercial, remember?
KYLE
Yeah! Go to the tobacco company yourself!
CARTMAN
Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong! [crosses his arms]
KYLE
Yeah dude. You were totally wrong.
KENNY
(Uh huh.)
CARTMAN
You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heh! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company!
STAN
[yielding] Oh all right.
KYLE
No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded.
STAN
Why?
KYLE
Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula!
STAN
So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks. [all the boys stroke their chins]
[Big Tobacco Co., night. The town arrives with all the townspeople carrying torches and clamoring.]
KYLE
God-damnit! [Cartman hides behind Mr. Harris upon seeing Rob Reiner]
ROB REINER
Give us the child!
KEVIN HARRIS
We will not!
ROB REINER
There, you see that?! The tobacco company won't give us the kid! And do you know why?! Because they know that if they give us that kid, then we'll kill him! And when our commercial goes on the air, it will lose them business!
TOWNSPEOPLE
Yeah! Yeah, that's right!
MR. MACKEY
[suddenly realizes] Wait a minute, what?
ROB REINER
Yeah. When we kill the kid, people are gonna think it's because of second-hand smoke! And then these bastards are all gonna make money, and they know it! [crowd goes silent]
RANDY
Wha- what the hell is wrong with you? That's not right.
ROB REINER
Oh, God-damnit, do I have to explain this again?! Smoking is bad, people! So if we have to be a little extreme to stop it, it's okay!
KYLE
No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate- [to Stan] See, I knew it.
STAN
Yup.
KYLE
You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole!
ROB REINER
God-Damnit There'll be no more smoking!!
STAN
It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked. It was our fault, us! We should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do!
MR. MACKEY
You're right, boys, m'kay?
BUDS MAN
Yeah. Let smokers smoke.
TOWNSPEOPLE
Yeah!!
MR. GARRISON
Hey Mr. Reiner, why don't you Butt Out! [they all laugh]
ROB REINER
[holding a big slice of chocolate cake] I'm warning you: don't mess with anti-smoking groups!
CARTMAN
[approaches Reiner] I don't idolize you anymore, asshole! [takes the fork Reiner was holding and jabs it into his belly, Reiner begins to deflate as fat gushes out of the punctures Cartman made with the fork]
ROB REINER
My goo! My precious goo! [apparently, there were no bones there. All that's left of Reiner is a puddle of fat and the skin it was all in. Cartman returns to the other boys, and the parents gather around them]
SHEILA
So Kyle, it wasn't the tobacco company that made you wanna smoke?
KYLE
No.
SHEILA
Well then, you are grounded, mister!
LIANE
You too, Eric.
CARTMAN
Aw awww!
[Added in later showings of the episode.]
STAN
Well, I guess we learned our lesson.
KYLE
No we didn't, dude! No we didn't! [walks off]
End of Butt Out


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:After Wendy breaks up with Stan the boys take him to "Raisins", a local restaurant known for its great chicken wings and hot girls.

script:Raisins

[South Park Elementary playground, recess or lunch. The camera pans across the playground and settles on two teams of seven players each. A football lies on the ground between the two groups. The group left of the football consists of Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, Butters, Tolkien, and Clyde. The second includes Craig, Tweek, Kevin, Pip, and three others]
STAN
All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third "set hut!" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen.
CARTMAN
Right. What are we playing again?
STAN
Football.
CARTMAN
Got it. [the teams get into position]
STAN
Okay. 23! [Bebe appears behind him and taps him on the shoulder] Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut! [Bebe taps him on the shoulder again. Stan turns and looks at her]
BEBE
Wendy breaks up.
STAN
What? [looks let down]
BEBE
Wendy breaks up with you. [turns to walk away. Stan looks on for a few seconds]
STAN
[moves forth to hold her up] Oh whoa, wait a minute. [Bebe turns around] What did I do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy for weeks. [This gets the other boys' attention]
BEBE
She just doesn't wanna be with you anymore. She said she still wants to be friends. [the other boys turn to see what's going on]
CARTMAN
What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank!
BEBE
Fuck you, fatass! You guys are assholes!
BUTTERS
Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!
CARTMAN
Yeh-heah, right!
BEBE
God, you're so stupid! [turns around and walks away]
CARTMAN
What a whore! [turns around and goes back to the game. The other boys do the same. Stan is too stunned to move]
KYLE
Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up! [The boys get back into their playing positions. A few moments Kyle looks back] Stan? [Clyde looks back, then Cartman]
CARTMAN
[turns around] Come on, Stan, it's first down still. [Butters looks back, then Kenny. Stan loses heart and walks off slowly, his head hanging low. The other boys look at each other, unsure what to make of that. A montage begins.]
[Stan is next seen walking onto a small red stone bridge. The next scene has him walking down the middle of a two-lane road in the rain. He stops to take in the moist air. The next scene has him back on the bridge, looking over the creek with his head on his right hand. On the water he sees a reflection of Wendy walk up to him. She's smiling. He brightens as she approaches. He turns to greet her, but there's no one to greet. He looks back at the creek, then turns around and walks off. The next scene has him at a rainy night sitting on the curb in a run-down part of town, under a working street light, with his face buried in his legs, crying. The last scene has him in his room, sitting on the floor by his bed, looking at a picture of Wendy. He gently strokes the picture, which has Wendy holding a daisy and smiling broadly. On the picture are written the words "I love you forever. Wendy." The image fades to black]
[South Park Elementary, day. In the hallway Craig goes to a drinking fountain for a drink of water. Fosse and Dog Poo walk towards the camera. Stan is at the far end watching Wendy open her locker. Stan looks away and walks towards Kyle, who's seated next to his locker reading a book.]
STAN
Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?
KYLE
[not looking up] Why?
STAN
'Cause I need to know why she broke up.
KYLE
Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework.
STAN
[pleading] Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her?
KYLE
[puts his book down and sighs] God damn it! [walks over to Wendy, but avoids eye contact] Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up. [Wendy turns around]
WENDY
Look, Stan is really nice. I just don't wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. I've been wanting to break up for a while. but it's, it's nothing against him.
KYLE
'Kay. [walks back to Stan, but avoids looking at him, as well] She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you.
STAN
What? That's no answer! [nudges him a bit] Go tell her to be more direct with me.
KYLE
[goes for his books and picks them up] No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic. [walks off. Jimmy appears]
STAN
Kyle, this is my life. [points at Jimmy] Jimmy!
JIMMY
Hey Stan.
STAN
Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me?
JIMMY
For- Forw- Forw-w-w what?
STAN
Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her, [thinks] tell her... [gestures] she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me.
JIMMY
She's what?
STAN
She's a continuing source of inspiration to me.
JIMMY
...Okay. [walks over to Wendy] Hey uh-Wen, hey wu-Wendy. [she turns around with her books]
WENDY
Yeah?
JIMMY
Stan says you're a cont...[pronouncing as "cunt"] you're a- cont- S-Stan says you're a cont- cont-
WENDY
Well tell Stan to fuck off!! [closes her locker and runs away]
JIMMY
-cont- You're a cont-tinuing source of inspiration to him. [his mission done, he returns to Stan]
STAN
Well?
JIMMY
She just- w-walked away, Stan. You're gonna have to face facts. It's over. [hangs his head for emphasis, then walks off]
STAN
[softly] Over? [walks away dejected. He's next seen in bed, a blanket hung across his window blocking out the outside light. He has his sheets drawn up tight against his chin. A few moments later, Kyle enters with Butters, Cartman, Jimmy and Kenny. Kyle studies his friend.] Jesus...
BUTTERS
We came over to cheer you up, Stan!
STAN
[softly, creaking] ...Go away.
KYLE
Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live.
STAN
Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone?
CARTMAN
God, what a fag!
KYLE
Dude, not now! [Cartman looks down, embarrassed]
STAN
You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken...
KYLE
Jeez, he's worse than I thought.
BUTTERS
Well what do we do now?
JIMMY
Should I try telling him a fa-fantastic joke?
KYLE
No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins.
BUTTERS
What's Raisins?
[Next day, Raisins, a Hooters-like restaurant with al-fresco dining. The boys enter the restaurant, and a pretty little girl in a Raisins outfit walks up. Other girls walk around, all seem to work there]
BLONDE
Hey guys, welcome to Raisins. Six of you? [smiles and grabs some menus from the counter] Right over here. [leads the boys to their table]
REDHEAD
[waits at a table] So you guys having a good time today?
DINERS
[Table 1, say, enthralled] Uh huh...
BLONDE 2
[waits at the next table] How about some more fun fries, guys?
DINERS
[Table 2, enthralled] Okay... [the waitress at the other end of the table smiles]
BRUNETTE
[at the same table] Boy, am I glad you guys came in. Everyone here is such a loser, but you guys seem really cool.
BLONDE
[leaving them at their table] Here you go, guys. Lexus will be right with you.
KYLE
What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh?
JIMMY
Jesus Christ, I think I've died and... gone to... heaven.
BUTTERS
This place is awesome!
CARTMAN
How do you know? We haven't even tried the food yet.
LEXUS
[with flyaway light brown hair] Hey guys.
BUTTERS
Whoa!
LEXUS
How are we doing this afternoon?
THE BOYS
Good.
LEXUS
I'm so glad you guys came in. Everyone here is such a loser, but you guys seem really cool.
BUTTERS
[amazed] W-we are.
LEXUS
So what can I get you?
CARTMAN
Okay, um, we're gonna get the zingy tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts [Lexus winks at Butters] and uh, OH, and the bite-size pizzazzas, and a pitcher of lemonade.
LEXUS
Great. I'll put your order in right now. [strokes Butters' shoulders, which sends shivers of excitement through his body]
BUTTERS
You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes me. She, she touched my back when she walked away. Did you see that?
LEXUS
[near the kitchen] Raisins, girls! [sends an order along a conveyor to the kitchen staff]
BLONDE 3
Woohoo!
REDHEAD
Oh Yeah!
BRUNETTE 2
[farther away] Do it!
KYLE
Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is really cute, huh? [a Raisins girl walks by with long black hair] Why don't you say hi to her? [calls out] Excuse me? [motions for her to come over]
BRUNETTE 3
[walks back and to the table] Hi guys. My name's Porsche.
KYLE
Hey. Uh, this is Stan.
PORSCHE
Oh hey cutie. How are you? I love your hat. I used to have a hat juuust like that, except, it was black and it didn't have a puffball on it. Oh my God, my hands are sooo cold. How come people have hands, anyway? Did you ever wonder that? [Stan looks more and more miserable with every word coming out of her mouth.]
[Some time later, still dining. The Village People's "YMCA" begins to play, and some Raisins girls begin to dance]
RAISINS GIRLS
YMCA... [they make the hand signs for the letters. The rest of the diners look over at them and cheer them on] YMCA-A.
CARTMAN
[really stuffed, with a soiled face] Omigod! You guys... this is the greatest place in the world... [their meals have been served]
PORSCHE
[still regaling Stan, who hasn't touched his food] Have you ever noticed how much sand there is at the beach? I mean, haven't you ever wondered where all this sand came from? Omigod, this one time, I saw a beetle that was thiiis big. Eeewww!
STAN
Can we go, please?
KYLE
Okay. Okay, come on you guys. [they all hop off their seats and walk off]
PORSCHE
Oooh my God, thank you guys sooo much for coming to Raisins! [Butters is last to leave]
LEXUS
[sees him and stalls him] Oooh, sweetie, are you leaving?
BUTTERS
Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my stupid friends wanna go.
LEXUS
Awww, well, when am I gonna get to see you again??
BUTTERS
When do you wanna see me?
LEXUS
[holds on to him] As soon as possible!
BUTTERS
Oh my God! Here, we left you a tip already, but here is another five dollars. [hands her the bill]
LEXUS
Oooh, you are such a sweetie. Come here, youuu! [comes around and gives him a full embrace and hugs him]
BUTTERS
[hugs her back] Waa... ahaaah... [the other boys arrive at the entrance]
RAISINS GIRL
Bye, guys! Thanks for coming to Raisins!
JIMMY
Well, Stan. Do you feel, uhb- better now?
STAN
No, dude, I feel worse!
KYLE
Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there.
STAN
Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life!
BUTTERS
[catches up to the other boys] She wants to see me again! My Raisins girl said she wants to see me again!
STAN
I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all the talking for me. It's time I took control! [turns and opens one of the doors]
KYLE
What are you doing?
STAN
Something I should have done a long time ago. [walks out the door and into the night]
[Bebe's house, night. Stan walks towards the front door, looks around, and knocks three times. No response, so he knocks again. The door opens and Bebe appears]
STAN
Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for me right now! [Bebe rolls her eyes and sighs] All this time I've been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me! Now I realize I need her friends to do it! Tell her I love her!
BEBE
Stan, why don't you show her you love her? If you really want Wendy back, try doing the most romantic thing you can think of.
STAN
[thinks] Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of?
BEBE
If you really want a shot at getting her back, stand outside her window, hold a boombox over your head, and play [closes her eyes] Peter Gabriel.
[Wendy's house, night. Stan stands on the lawn with a boombox, looking up at Wendy's window. He presses the play button and holds up the boombox. Peter Gabriel's "Shock the Monkey" plays from somewhere in the middle. Wendy appears at the window and looks down, her jaw dropping. Stan holds the boombox higher, keeping Wendy's gaze on him. Wendy covers her mouth as Tolkien appears next to her at the window. Stan's jaw drops. Wendy leaves the window. Tolkien unleashes the curtain ties, and the curtains close upon the window]
[Raisins, night, outside. The outside lights turn off. Butters waits outside on the curb with a present. The front door opens and Lexus appears. Butters rises to greet her]
LEXUS
Okay, Porsche, see you tomorrow. Bye, Mercedes.
BUTTERS
[approaches] Lexus! [she takes a few steps back]
LEXUS
Oh. Oh, hi, sweetie.
BUTTERS
I waited all night for you to get off work.
LEXUS
Oh, really? [takes a few more steps back] Huhunh, that's great. Uhm, Maury...
BUTTERS
I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you.
MAURY
[a huge bouncer] There a problem?
LEXUS
Could you uh just help walk me to my- bike?
MAURY
Right. [steps up behind her and shoves Butters aside. He keeps his arm in place so Butters doesn't get any closer to Lexus]
LEXUS
[to Butters] Thanks again for the big tip. You are such a sweetie. Come back and see me real soon, okay? [moves forward, with Maury close behind]
BUTTERS
Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present.
LEXUS
[stops and grabs it] Oh wow. Thanks, cutie.
BUTTERS
It's a little stuffed bear dressed as a rabbit. [tries to get closer, but Maury holds him back]
LEXUS
Gosh, that's the nicest gift I've gotten all night. Thank you. [reaches her bike] Well I gotta go, honey. Be sure to come back to Raisins and see me again, okaaay? [unlocks her bike from its post]
BUTTERS
[tries to get closer, but Maury him back] Well yeah, but, but, hey, [tries to get closer, but Maury him back] hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime.
LEXUS
Oh gee, that would be great, honey, but I'm reeeally busy this week. Tell you what: you come back to Raisins and then we'll be able to hang out all we want, okay? [Maury helps her on to her bike]
BUTTERS
O-kay!
LEXUS
Bye, cutie!
BUTTERS
Bye, bye darling! [Maury turns and goes back to the restaurant. Butters holds his hands over his heart] Wow... a real-life relationship.
[[South Park Elementary, day. All the boys are in various stages of dress. Most of them are in their P.E. uniforms.]]
MR. GARRISON
[sternly] All right, kids! Out on the gym floor for P.E. class. [the boys break up and head to their lockers. Stan remains on a bench on his back, alone, with just a towel and his hat on]
KYLE
[returns] Come on, Stan. We're gonna play dodgeball.
STAN
[with emotion in his voice] I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else.
KYLE
Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Tolkien. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life?
STAN
There's nothing else I can do. She was my whole life.
KYLE
Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time!
STAN
Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth kids.
[South Park Elementary, loading bay. Stan finds the goth kids.]
PETE
[with black puffy, feathery hair, streaked in red] Life is pain. Life is only pain. [his hair falls over his right eye, he jerks his head back to put it back in place] We're all taught to believe in happy fairytale endings. [his hair falls over his eye, he jerks his head back] But there's only blackness. Dark, depressing loneliness that [his hair falls over his eye, he jerks his head back] eats at your soul.
MICHAEL
[dressed in something like a tuxedo, sporting a curly pompadour] Who needs that kind of Barbie love, anyway? Everyone's just walking around like a bunch of conformists. Go ahead and wear your business suits so you can make thirty-four thousand dollars a year to buy your condominium. They're all zombies racing to their graves. Love didn't work for my mom and dad. Why should it work for me?
HENRIETTA
My dad is such an asshole. Drunken bastard doesn't even know I exist. But then he won't let me go to the Skinny Puppy concert because my heroine-addict aunt is coming over for dinner. [takes a puff] Dinner? That's a laugh. Just an excuse for my mom to bitch at me for not wearing girly clothes like all the Britney Spears wannabes at this school.
FIRKLE
They're all a bunch of Nazi conformists cheerleaders. [Stan looks stunned at the age of this youngest of Goths]
STAN
But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living?
PETE
Just to make life more miserable for the conformists. [his hair falls over his eye, he jerks his head back]
STAN
All right, so how do I join you?
MICHAEL
If you wanna be one of the non-conformists, all you have to do is dress just like us and listen to the same music we do.
STAN
...'K.
[Raisins, day. Raisins is preparing for a new day of food and fun. Mercedes escorts a new employee around]
MERCEDES
Okay, I know it's your first day, Ferrari, so I wanna go over the basics with you.
FERRARI
Okay.
MERCEDES
First of all, there's a five foot rule. If you come within five feet of a customer, you need to acknowledge them, even if they're not at your table. "Hey, cutie." [waves and winks] When you're not serving food or talking with customers, you need to dance around and have fun. [they stop by a wooden bucket] We use things like Hula Hoops, silly strings, and water guns to play with the other girls. Be sure to giggle a lot, and be sure to show off your raisins. [they leave the bucket] Now, when you take a customer's order, you need to sit down at the table with them and make them think you're interested. Write your name down for them and make them feel special. "Oh man, I am so bored. Thank God you guys came in." If you want good tips, the most important thing is physical contact. Just a simple hold of the arm can mean the difference between five and twenty dollars. "I'll be right back with your order, guys." [holds Ferrari's shoulder]
FERRARI
Wow, thank you so much, Mercedes.
MERCEDES
Okay. Well, I guess we're ready to open for business. Good luck. [Ferrari walks off] Go ahead and open for business, Porsche!
PORSCHE
Okay! [opens the doors and Butters bolts in, quite excitedly]
RAISINS GIRL
Hi, welcome to Raisins!
BUTTERS
Hi! Is Lexus here?
LEXUS
Hey, cutie.
BUTTERS
Darling!
LEXUS
[hugs him] How are we doing today?
BUTTERS
[hugs back] Oh God. I missed you so much.
[Henrietta's room. It's quite the room, with posters for Skippy Puppy and the Nothing Matters tour, a Blauhaus poster, candles all around, a mace on the floor, cigarettes next to a book, an ornate candelabrum and chair, and a darkened atmosphere.]
HENRIETTA
[Reciting her poem]
Shallow life.
Drowning alone, I gasp for air.
Coldness creeps over pale skin.
There is sadness so deep it pulls me down
Happiness dies in a deep, dark sea.
PETE
Yeah, happiness dies. [his hair falls over his eye, he jerks his head back]
STAN
[dressed all in black, with a black hat with puffball] Yeah.
MICHAEL
All right, your turn, Stan. Read one of your poems about pain.
STAN
[takes up his paper and reads his poem]
There is darkness all around me
Deep, piercing black, I cannot breathe
My heart has been raped.
HENRIETTA
Whoa.
STAN
[continues]
The pain is everlasting.
I miss you so much, babe.
Want to hold you in my arms again, girl.
Want to-
PETE
Whoa, whoa! Dude! Those last two lines aren't Goth!
STAN
They're not?
MICHAEL
No, dude! You can't say "I miss you so much, babe. I want to hold you in my arms."
HENRIETTA
Make it "I miss seeing you so much I wanna slash my eyes out with razor blades."
HENRIETTA'S MOM
[the bedroom door opens and a blindingly invasive amount of light comes in, she looks inside] Henrietta! Hi sweetie!
HENRIETTA
Go away Mom! Leave me alone!
HENRIETTA'S MOM
Daddy and I just got your birthday present! But you can't see what it is till tomorrow!
HENRIETTA
You'd like to wait till I was dead, wouldn't you? You'd like to see maggots eat my face.
HENRIETTA'S MOM
Ee-you are so creative, honey.
HENRIETTA
Conformist bitch.
OTHER GOTHS
Yeah.
[Raisins, day. Two of the Raisins girls are entertaining the child customers, who respond enthusiastically. The phone rings and Porsche arrives to answer it.]
PORSCHE
Thanks for calling Raisins. This is Porsche. Have you tried our Double Whammy Wings?
BUTTERS
[seated on his bed in his room. A picture of Lexus is taped to his wall next to the window. The action switches back and forth] Hi. Is Lexus there, please? This is her boyfriend. [Lexus happens to walk by, and Porsche hands her the phone.]
LEXUS
Thanks for calling Raisins. This is Lexus.
BUTTERS
Hey Lexus.
LEXUS
Hi, sweetie! Who's this?
BUTTERS
Wuh it's me, Butters.
LEXUS
Oh, okay. Hi, cutie. [keeps an eye out for passing customers. Three boys walk by and she covers the phone's receiver] Hey sweetie. [lifts her hand from the receiver] So how are you, honey?
BUTTERS
I'm fine. I miss you though. [lays on his back, getting comfortable] Yeah, school was pretty tough today. We had two quizzes, and one of them was a pop quiz. [shot of Lexus pouring lemonade into a pitcher] Sometimes I think our classes are too hard. [back to Butters' room] But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going?
LEXUS
Good, good.
BUTTERS
Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD.
LEXUS
Oh, gee, I don't know, cutie. [another Raisins girl comes with glasses to refill, Lexus ] Why don't you just come down to Raisins?
BUTTERS
Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times.
LEXUS
[waving to customers] Awww, that's too bad, cutie. I really wanna see you.
BUTTERS
Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby. Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more money
LEXUS
[walks to the phone's base to end the conversation] 'K sugar. Gotta run.
BUTTERS
Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's something I've been meaning to say. [Lexus has hung up and is walking away with her pitcher] Here it goes: Lexus, I- Oh jeeze, maybe I shouldn't say it- no wait, I want to say it. I love you. [hangs up quickly and nervously] Heeheee, heh, Oh my God.
[Butters' house, living room. Butters arrives there moments later and faces the couch]
BUTTERS
Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again.
STEPHEN
O-hoo no Butters! You got an advance two days ago. [Linda is dusting off the family portrait by the front door.]
BUTTERS
Uh but I spent it all.
LINDA
What are you spending all that money on, Butters?
BUTTERS
On my girlfriend.
STEPHEN
[he and Linda are surprised] Girlfriend?
LINDA
You... have a girlfriend, Butters?
BUTTERS
[bashfully, puts his hands behind his back] Yeah.
CHRIS
And she's... a... girl, right?
BUTTERS
Yup!
CHRIS
Well all right! Good for you, Butters!
LINDA
Oh, that is so cute. When do we get to meet her?
BUTTERS
Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone. [holds a cautionary finger] But don't embarrass me or nothin'. [lowers it] I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you.
STEPHEN
Don't worry, Butters. We just wanna say hi and then we'll leave you two alone.
BUTTERS
Okay. [walks off]
STEPHEN
[holds out his hand] You see? I told you he wouldn't turn out gay.
LINDA
[hands him a bill] All right, you win.
[Benny's, night. "We're always open." The Goth kids are seated at a booth drinking coffee. A middle-aged waitress walks by with a pot of coffee]
MICHAEL
Hey, can we get more coffee over here?
WAITRESS
Damn it, are you kids just gonna sit here all night again and drink six dollars' work of coffee?! Why don't you get a life?! [walks away]
MICHAEL
[bitterly] Conformist. Have fun in your rat-race life, living paycheck to paycheck for corporate gains.
OTHER GOTHS
Yeah.
PETE
[to Stan] Dude, you haven't drank your coffee. [his hair falls over his face, he jerks his head back]
STAN
Well I don't drink coffee.
PETE
You can't be a non-conformist if you don't drink coffee. [Stan picks up his mug and drinks. Kyle enters the restaurant and approaches Stan's booth]
KYLE
Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?!
STAN
[sips some coffee] Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul. [sips some coffee. Pete jerks his hair back into place]
KYLE
God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home!
STAN
So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so.
PETE
Yeah. Why don't you just go back to your Justin Timberlake and your homework, you conformist asshole? [jerks his hair back into place] You just don't know what real pain is.
KYLE
Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy!
PETE
I'm not gonna live in a Third-World country with all the conformists.
KYLE
Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back!
STAN
What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token?
KYLE
Yeah. She is.
STAN
Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain?
HENRIETTA
For sure.
KYLE
[walks away, defeated] Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable.
STAN
[sips some coffee] ...conformist.
OTHER GOTHS
Yeah.
[Raisins, night. Butters and his parents arrive.]
BUTTERS
Here we are, Mom and Dad! [they enter, but his parents are immediately troubled by the setting]
MERCEDES
Hi, welcome to Raisins. Three of you?
BUTTERS
Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her.
MERCEDES
Great. [gets some menus] Be sure to try our Cheddar Poppers. Right this way. [leads them to a table]
RAISINS GIRL
Who else wants a signed Raisins Girls calendar for five dollars? [the table she approaches cheers]
DINERS
Woohoo, all right, yeah! [the Stotches look around, amazed]
LINDA
Stephen, what is this place?
STEPHEN
I, don't know.
MERCEDES
[stops at a table] Here you go. Porsche will by right with you. [walks off]
BUTTERS
Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ah I've gotta go and find Lexus! [runs off. Stephen and Linda take their seats]
RAISINS GIRL
[blonde, to a boy at a table nearby] Hey cutie, you having a good time?
BOY
Yeah.
STEPHEN
Oh boy, I think I know what's happened. Our son hasn't learned yet that girls will pretend to like him for money.
LINDA
[holds her hands together] This place is horrible. To objectify girls like this.
PORSCHE
[arrives] Hi guys. Can I take your order?
LINDA
Little girl, you shouldn't be working here.
PORSCHE
I shouldn't? Where I supposed to be working?
LINDA
No, I mean you shouldn't work somewhere where you're paid for how you look. You should be learning a skill so you can grow up to be a businesswoman or even a doctor. Who knows? You could cure cancer.
PORSCHE
I could cure cancer? Oh-my-god! That would be sooo cool! I had a cancer sore on my lip once and it hurt sooo bad.
LINDA
... Oh. Never mind, I think Raisins might be the perfect place for you.
PORSCHE
Cool! [grins and hops off the stool, then carries it off. Butters arrives with Lexus, who carries a plate of chips]
BUTTERS
Mom? Dad? This is Lexus.
LEXUS
Hi. Welcome to Raisins.
STEPHEN
Uh, Butters, can we have a little talk with you? Outside?
BUTTERS
Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me [holds on to Lexus] you can say in front of Lexus.
LINDA
Butters, these girls pretend to be interested in you because they know you'll give them tips.
BUTTERS
Huh?
STEPHEN
You see, Butters, women know that they can make men do anything by flirting. And some girls, like these, turn that into a profession.
BUTTERS
Oh, I see. [gets angry] You don't approve of my girlfriend! [Lexus looks off and smiles at somebody] Well let me tell you somethin', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we're gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad! [walks away from the table with Lexus] Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint!
LEXUS
What are you talking about, kid? We are NOT boyfriend and girlfriend.
BUTTERS
... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore?
LEXUS
I'm sorry, sweetie. Yes.
BUTTERS
So that's it? We're broken up now?
LEXUS
I gotta go, i gotta get these curly fries to Table 12. [walks off]
BUTTERS
Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over. [walks off dejected] Our relationship is o-over.
[Stan did, at the curb under a working street light. Some shadows move in on him and stop when they cover most of his head]
MICHAEL
Look at that. Another tortured soul.
PETE
Another life of pain. [Butters looks up to see the Goths. Stan isn't shown yet.]
MICHAEL
Hey Raven, check it out. [Stan, now named Raven, enters the picture]
STAN
Butters?
BUTTERS
Oh [sniff, wipes away his tears] Uh hey, hey Stan.
STAN
What's the matter with you?
BUTTERS
[sobbing] Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me.
HENRIETTA
Did she step on your heart with stiletto heels?
BUTTERS
Yeah. [sniff] It sure does hurt.
MICHAEL
That's cool. I guess you can join up with us if you want.
PETE
Yeah. We're gonna go to the graveyard and write poems about death and how pointless life is.
BUTTERS
Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life.
STAN
Huh? But you just got dumped.
BUTTERS
Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like, [sobs] it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid...
PETE
Yeah.
STAN
No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all.
BUTTERS
Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan. [walks off]
STAN
He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. As Cartman would you say, Screw you guys, I'm goin' home. [walks off]
MICHAEL
Go ahead and go back to your sunshine fairytale!
[South Park Elementary, playground. The school kids are back at play. The same two teams face off, except that Bill has replaced Tolkien on Stan's team, and Stan hasn't arrived yet.]
KYLE
[prepares to receive the football] Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play!
STAN
[arrives] Hey, can I join in? [the other boys turn around]
KYLE
What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain?
STAN
Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way. [Tolkien and Wendy walk by at this point] Hey Wendy! [Tolkien and Wendy look] You're a bitch,.. Token? [flips him off] Right here, buddy. [Tolkien and Wendy walk off, insulted]
KYLE
Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back.
STAN
Yeah. Let's play ball.
End of Raisins


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The town decides to cancel Christmas and take up a collection when Ike's Canadian birth parents show up unexpectedly and want their baby back.

script:It's Christmas in Canada

[Kyle's house, night. "Happy Chanukah" The Broflovski family sings as Gerald lights the first candle on the Chanukah menorah.]
THE BROFLOVSKIS
Chanukah, Chanukah, sivivon, sov, sov
IKE
I gotta go tinkle.
KYLE
No Ike! Shh!
THE BROFLOVSKIS
[while Ike and Kyle talk] Sov, sov, sov! Sov, sov, sov! Ma nayim vi-tov.
GERALD
We thank God for our blessings this Chanukah. Our little family is so loving, and perfect, and nothing will ever tear us apart. [the doorbell rings] I'll get it. [goes to answer the door. A Canadian couple stands at the entrance]
MAN
Gerald Broflovski?
GERALD
Yes?
MAN
My name is Harry Gintz and this is my wife Elise. We're from Canada.
GERALD
Yes, I can tell.
HARRY
My wife and I had a child a few years back, and, we weren't ready to have a child, so we put him up for adoption. [Kyle and Ike come into view] We were told that you might be the-
ELISE
Peter! [rushes in] Oh God, Harry! It's our son! [approaches and kneels. Ike hides behind Kyle] Peter, it's Mommy.
SHEILA
Gerald, what the hell is going on?
GERALD
I'm not sure.
[Moments later, both couples are at the dining room table.]
HARRY
It was a tough time for us. It was a tough time for all of Canada. The whole country was devastated by the cola wars. It just seemed we couldn't take care of a baby.
ELISE
So we put him up for adoption. But as the years passed, I, I just felt an emptiness in my heart. [Kyle eavesdrops on the conversation, with Ike at his side] Oh it's so good to see him.
SHEILA
Well, we wish you all the best, Mr. and Mrs. Gintz, but to be honest, I think it would be best for Ike if you didn't come around again.
ELISE
I don't think you understand. We didn't come to visit Peter, we came to take him back.
GERALD
What?
HARRY
We want to take Peter home, to Canada.
SHEILA
Are you crazy?!
GERALD
Look, you gave Ike up. You can't just change your mind.
HARRY
Changing your mind is a Canadian custom that we hold quite dear. And besides, the new Canadian Prime Minister has issued a decree that all adopted Canadians must be returned home.
SHEILA
The new Canadian Prime Minister?
GERALD
Look, Ike is our son now!
HARRY
He doesn't belong here. He belongs in Canada with his own kind.
SHEILA
I think you'd better leave.
HARRY
Please, don't make things any harder for Peter.
GERALD
Harder for Peter?! Now you two just blow in here and say you're gonna haul him back to Canada, and we're being hard on Peter?!
HARRY
We're prepared to go to court! We had hoped it wouldn't come to that!
GERALD
Well you bet your ass it'll come to that!
[Park County courtroom, day.]
JUDGE
I'm sorry to say that my hands are tied. The new Prime Minister of Canada has authority this court cannot override. By Canadian law I must award custody of the child to his birth parents.
THE GINTZES
Yes!
ELISE
Yes!
SHEILA
No!
KYLE
[frightened] Ike's not my little brother anymore?
SHEILA
Gerald, do something!
GERALD
There's nothing I can do.
[Kyle's house, day. Sheila cries as Gerald sends Ike off.]
GERALD
Good-bye, Ike. You... [wipes a tear from his eyes] be a good boy, huh? You... remember all the things we taught you. [kisses Ike on the head and steps back to console Sheila. Kyle steps forward.]
KYLE
Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay?
HARRY
Come on, Peter, we should get going.
IKE
[holds onto Kyle] No!
ELISE
Peter, you must come with Mommy and Daddy.
IKE
No no no no no!
HARRY
[whips out a chocolate bar] I have some chocolate.
IKE
Chocolate! [rushes for the candy, and Harry settles him inside the car]
HARRY
We're going to take good care of him.
KYLE
You'd better! [Harry closes the car door and goes to his side, then settles in to drive. The car lunges forward on square wheels. Kyle looks as Ike goes away. Ike looks back] Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister? If he knew the situation, he might be-
GERALD
Oh! Kyle, appealing to the Prime Minister of Canada would take... time and money we don't have.
[Luau's Toys, night. It's dressed for Christmas. Stan, Cartman, and Kenny look inside the shop through the window.]
CARTMAN
Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas.
STAN
Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action.
KYLE
Guys. [the other boys turn to face him] Guys, I need your help.
STAN
Sure dude.
KYLE
It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone.
CARTMAN
We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas!
STAN
Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure?
KYLE
Please, you guys, you don't understand. [walks off some distance] My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.
CARTMAN
Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmas time.
STAN
Dude, Cartman.
CARTMAN
I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all.
KYLE
[returns] I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then-
STAN
Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way. [he, Cartman and Kenny leave. Cartman stops and returns]
CARTMAN
Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year, I still wouldn't help you. [walks off in the direction of the other boys. Kyle walks off sadly in the other direction]
[South Park City Hall, night. The town Christmas tree is up, City Hall is decked out in Christmas decorations.]
CROWD
Three! Two! One! [The lights to the Christmas tree are plugged in] Yaaaaay!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
As we celebrate this glorious time, we can't forget those families who are suffering. As many of you know, the Broflovski family has recently had their child torn away from them. As a community, we must do all we can to ease their pain. Are there any suggestions how we might help?
MR. GARRISON
How about, we get rid of all the Mexicans? [a few seconds of silence]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Mr. Garrison, every Christmas you suggest we get rid of all the Mexicans, and every Christmas we tell you "NO!"
MR. GARRISON
Rats!
CHEF
The Broflovskis need money to appeal that case to the new Canadian Prime Minister. What if this Christmas, instead of buyin' presents, we all use that money to give to the Broflovskis?
CARTMAN
HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas!
LIANE
That's a great idea, Chef.
CARTMAN
What?
RANDY
Yeah. Who needs more stuff, anyway? This Christmas we can do somethin' that really matters!
STAN
[trying to rein in his dad's enthusiasm] Dad, don't get carried away.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Then it's settled: This year we'll give all our Christmas money to the Broflovskis, in hopes that they may someday have their child returned to them. [the crowd cheers and disperses]
CARTMAN
No! No, this can't be happening! [Kenny, Heidi and Clyde remain there as well. Clyde begins to cry.]
[Kyle walks down the street still depressed. Cartman bounds in before him.]
CARTMAN
You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!!
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying Christmas presents!! [Stan and Kenny walk in behind him] You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!! [lunges after Kyle] AAAAAA!! [Stan and Kenny jump in and hold him back]
STAN
Whoa whoa, Cartman.
CARTMAN
It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?!
STAN
Cartman, calm down!
KYLE
[to Stan] Is that true?
STAN
It's true, dude. Christmas is ruined.
CARTMAN
[takes off his mittens and coat] This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now.
KYLE
I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money.
CARTMAN
You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?
KYLE
It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this.
STAN
Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures.
KYLE
[reassuring] We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.
CARTMAN
Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all.
[City Wok, night. "Christmas Special: Chinese Food For The Holidays" Mr. Kim sits at one of his tables with nothing to do.]
MR. KIM
No business... Christmas time come and nobody wanna eat Chinese food. Looks like I might as well close. [a phone rings. He perks up and runs to get it] Oh boy! Some business! [puts on his chef hat and grabs a notepad] Finally! [grabs the phone and waits for the order] Herro? Shitty Wok, take ur orda prease!
KYLE
Uh, I must have the wrong number. We were trying to reach City Airlines.
MR. KIM
Oh, oh yes, just a moment prease. [flips a sign over so it now reads "City Airlines" and switches to a captain's hat] Herro, Shitty Airrines. Can I help you take ur orda prease?
KYLE
Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon as possible.
MR. KIM
Oooh, Canada. Okay, that's uh pretty far. Gonna cost ya a lot of money... hmm let's see. How many people?
KYLE
Four.
MR. KIM
Okay. Four people, Canada, cost a lot of money, that uh gonna be about ah six thousand five hundred dolla.
KYLE
How about fifty daura?
MR. KIM
Fifty daura?! You flight to Canada cost at least three thousand dollar!
KYLE
Fifty-five daura.
MR. KIM
Hey! Stop wasting my time with fifty-five daura! No way I take my plane to Canada for less than a thousand daura!
KYLE
Okay. Sixty daura.
MR. KIM
Sixty-two daura.
KYLE
Okay.
MR. KIM
Okay. Meet me Park County Airfield, yellow Cessna, tail number 432G.
KYLE
Got it. [hangs up]
MR. KIM
[hangs up, then giggles] Hehehehe, never try to barter with a Chinese man.
[Park County Airfield, night. A plane comes in for a landing in the background as the boys approach the yellow Cessna.]
CARTMAN
We have exactly fifty-two hours before Christmas. [this sets it at 8 p.m. December 22] That means we have to be back in twenty-eight hours to still give our patents twenty-four hours to buy us presents. Synchronize watches on my mark. Mark.
MR. KIM
Herro, welcome Shitty Airrine. [Stan and Kyle move ahead. Kenny stays with Cartman]
CARTMAN
[shakes his head vigorously] Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying in that thing!
KENNY
(Me neither!)
KYLE
Why not?
KENNY
('Cause, dude, I'll fuckin' die!)
KYLE
You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid.
CARTMAN
You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.
STAN
No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not?
CARTMAN
Of course I care about Christmas- oh, Christ on a stick! [he and Kenny head for the plane]
[Cessna 432G, inside.]
CARTMAN
Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here!
MR. KIM
Okay, welcome aboard Shitty Airrines. This is your captain speaking. Looking about a two hour fright. I'll be turning on the seatbelt sign now. If your seats have seatbelts, this is the time you will fasten them. Please sit back, relax, and enjoy your Shitty fright. [he turns off the intercom and takes flight after a small bump.]
KYLE
All right! We're going to Canada!
CARTMAN
Weak.
[Cessna 432G, day. The flight has taken longer than two hours. The boys are sleeping in their seats - and so is Mr. Kim. The plane begins to hit turbulence and lose power.]
MR. KIM
Hey, turn off the right. ...Wha- oh! [a sudden noisy dip awakens the boys]
STAN
What's going on??
MR. KIM
Herro from the cockpit, this is your captain speaking. As you can see, it appears that we are goin' down. Now would be a good time to reflect on your rife, and pray to whatever deity you believe in. Thank you for flying Shitty Airlines. We know you have a choice in airlines, and it looks like you made the wrong one. [quickly puts on a parachute and opens his door to drop away]
KYLE
Hey, where the hell are you going?? [Mr. Kim jumps out and away. A few seconds later he pulls the rip cord and the parachute comes out]
STAN
Do something, Kyle! [Kyle grabs the controls and tries to steer the plane]
KYLE
I'm trying! [the plane bounces around in the air]
CARTMAN
Look out!
KENNY
(N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O!) [the plane makes a steep descent and crashes onto the ground. It flips over and crumples up, resting near a town. The boys scramble out of the rubble and walk into the town]
[Now begins the "Wizard of Oz" sequence. The boys look around in wonder. A pair of legs is seen at a bench, but no head is shown.]
STAN
You guys, I don't think we're in America anymore. [As they look in one direction, four Canadians pop up from some bushes and look at them. They drop back into the bushes before the boys turn back around]
CANADIAN MAN
Excuse me? [a head pops up over the legs at the bench] Uh, is this an invasion?
KYLE
No.
CANADIAN MAN
[a doctor, it seems] Oh thank heavens! It's okay. Everyone, it's not an invasion! [people come out of their hiding places. A man pops up out of a manhole mumbling something as the others mill around]
KYLE
Hey! We're in Canada!
DOCTOR
Well of course you are! And Canada Friends welcomes you!
CANADIANS
Welcome, friend, to Canada! Canada Friends loves you!
We're just like any other country without the big tattoo!
SAILOR
[walks up] We greet thee with pleasure, but one question, if we may?
BUSINESSMAN
[walks up and joins him] What brings you folks to Canada? Why are you here today?
KYLE
Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back?
CANADIANS
His brother is our quest. The question is, is what? You must talk to the new Prime Minister if you think his brother's home's back there.
CARTMAN
Oh Jesus Christ.
SCOTT
[shows up] Hey! What the hell is going on?!
CANADIANS
It's Scott! AAAAHHHH! [they all take off in different directions]
SCOTT
Who damaged our beloved Canadian land?!
KYLE
Who's that?
DOCTOR
That's Scott! He's a dick
SCOTT
[fixes his gaze on the boys and approaches] A-ha! Americans! I should've known! You think you're the police of the world! You think you own Canada! Well, you aren't welcome here! Get out now!
DOCTOR
Oh no you don't, Scott! Leave these boys alone!
SCOTT
This isn't over, you American scum! I swear to God: you'll rue this day!! [walks off]
MAN IN BARREL
God, what a dick!
KYLE
Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay? Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is?
DOCTOR
The new Prime Minister doesn't live in this part of Canada. He's in Ottawa. [the other Canadians concur]
KYLE
So how do we get to Ottawa?
WRESTLER
Oh that's easy. You just have to follow the road.
CARTMAN
Which road?!
FIREFIGHTER
This is Canada. We only have one road. [he moves to one side and the crowd splits in two to allow the boys through]
PRIEST
Follow the only road.
MAN
Follow the only road.
CANADIANS
To go anywhere in Canada, you just follow the only road.
There's only one road in Canada. We call it the Road, the only road.
Hip-hip, hooray, let's hear it for our Road.
ROAD WORKERS
And it's paved and wide and up to code.
STAN
All right dude, let's get the hell out of here!
KYLE
Word!
CANADIANS
You're off to see the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Canada!
DOCTOR
Good-bye, friends! Good luck with the new Prime Minister! And remember to watch out for Scott! He's a dick!
CANADIANS
Good-bye, good-bye, see ya, good luck.
[The Road, day.]
CARTMAN
[checking his watch] Twenty hours until Christmas. Our parents still have time to buy us presents IF we hurry. [a mountie appears]
MOUNTIE
Ahoy there, travelers.
KYLE
Who are you?
MOUNTIE
I am Rick, the proud Canadian Mountie. [he's shown riding a sheep]
SHEEP
Baaaah.
STAN
I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses.
RICK
[hangs his head a bit] Yes. Yes, we are. But our funding has been cut and now we're forced to ride...
SHEEP
Baaaah.
CARTMAN
But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister.
RICK
You're going to see the new Prime Minister. Oh, I would so like to meet him myself. It's his strange new laws that took our horses away. Perhaps I will go with you.
KYLE
That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves.
RICK
Follow me this way! We're going to see the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Canada!
SCOTT
[monitoring their progress over remote cameras] Power-hungry Americans! I'll fix you!
[Further down the Road, Rick and the boys pass through another town.]
CARTMAN
Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time!
RICK
All right boys, prepare yourselves. We're about to enter... French Canada.
KYLE
French Canada?
FRENCH CANADIANS
[Before them, lots of French Canadians cavort like it is Euro Disney, with circus performers of all stripes doing what they do best.]
There'z no Canada like French Canada, it'z za bezt Canada in ze land.
Ze ozer Canada is hardly Canada. If you lived here for a day, you'd understand.
MIME
Honh honh honnnh! Welcome to French Canada.
HOCKEY PLAYER
We have everything your heart could desire. Trapezes. Trampolines. And lots and lots of cheese.
ARTIST
[takes off his mustache] Would you like a moustache?
RICK
Just stay calm, boys. French Canadians are a little... odd. [behind them, two of them walk by. One is dressed in blue and looks a bit like an alien. The other is dressed something like He-Man, with long flowing locks.]
STAN
Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister.
MIME
Well first you must answer that phone. [makes his left hand into a phone receiver] Ring-ring. Ring-ring.
KYLE
We don't have time for this.
MIME
You cannot pass through French Canada unless you take zat phone call! [holds out his "phone"] Ring-ring. Ring-ring. [Kyle responds by make his right hand into a phone and answering]
KYLE
Hello?
MIME
Allo. If you are going to see za new Prime Minister, then I want to go with you. He has passed a new law forbidding us French Canadians to drink wine.
ARTIST
[walks up to the boys] How can ze French not drink wine?? Travestie!
KYLE
Okay, you can come with us.
MIME
Honh honnnh! Very good! Let us make haste!
FRENCH CANADIANS
[they escort the boys out and on their way with the Mime and the Mountie]
There'z no Canada like French Canada, it'z za bezt Canada in ze land.
And ze ozer Canada.
MIME
Is a bullshit Canada
FRENCH CANADIANS
If you lived here for a day, you'd understand. [the small group leaves the town behind]
MIME
I think you'd understand. ...You understand.
[Newfoundland. The group arrives at a dark place.]
RICK
Oh my! This certainly is a desolate place!
MIME
It reminds me of death and fear.
CARTMAN
How much further to Ottawa?! Christmas is only twelve hours away.
RICK
We must be very close now.
SCOTT
[jumps out in front of them] Ey! What are you doing?!
RICK
Waaaah!
MIME
Oh no. It's Scott.
SCOTT
What are you two doing helping these Americans?! Don't you know America thinks it owns Canada along with the rest of the world?!
RICK
You're a dick, Scott!
SCOTT
You're a dick! And by helping Americans, you're just as smelly as they are! Now I'm going to get you!
FISHERMAN
[exits a house with a fish in his left hand and a pole in his right] Not so fast, Scott!
SCOTT
Who the hell are you?!
FISHERMAN
I'm Steve the Newfoudlander. And you're on Newfoundland property now! Get off before I have you arrested!
SCOTT
Ugh! This isn't over! Not by a long shot! I'll fix you. I'll fix all of you!! [leaves in a huff. Steve draws closer to the group]
RICK
Woo, that was a close call. Thank you, kind Newfie!
KYLE
God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW!
STEVE
Oh yeah, the Prime Minister, eh? He sure has screwed up things for Newfoundland. Life just hasn't been the same since he made sodomy illegal.
MIME
Well, come with us! Maybe you can ask him to take his sodomy ban away.
KYLE
Can we just get going, please?
STEVE
Yeah, sure, except there's just one problem.
STAN
What?
STEVE
You folks are goin' the wrong way.
STAN
What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada.
STEVE
Yeah. And you all went the wrong direction on it.
RICK
Ohh, that's right. Ottawa is that way. [points behind the group]
MIME
Of course. Ottawa left, Newfoundland right!
STAN
[grimacing] Oh no!
CARTMAN
[glaring at Rick] How could you be so stupid!
KYLE
There's no way we can go all the way back. We'll never make it now!
RICK
It's okay, boys. The power is inside us to get to Ottawa! We can wish ourselves there!
MIME
Ah yes, let's wish ourselves there. [the three Canadians close their eyes and wish real hard]
RICK
[peeks with his left eye] Is it working?
CARTMAN
Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we were gonna throw down! [puts up his fists] Well it's on! We're gonna have it our RIGHT NOW! [grabs Kyle by the collar]
STEVE
[now in his boat at the end of a dock] Of course, we could always take my boat, eh?
RICK
Oh yes! On the river we could travel to Ottawa in no time!
KYLE
Well come on! [everyone hops into the boat]
STEVE
Okay, next stop, the new Prime Minister. [the boat leaves the dock and goes on its way]
KYLE
Do you think we can still make it in time?
CARTMAN
We'd better, Kyle. Or you're dead.
[The Parliament building, dawn. Steve and the rest of the party pull up to the small dock at one end of the grounds.]
STEVE
Here we are at the Parliament buildin'.
MIME
Ze Prime Minister is inside.
CARTMAN
[hops off the boat and runs towards Parliament] Well come on, let's hurry! It's almost Christmas! [the rest of the group follows]
[The Parliament building, entrance. Kyle knocks on the heavy wooden doors. A wooden panel opens up to reveal a window. A doorman looks out through it.]
DOORMAN
Yes?
KYLE
We need to see the new Prime Minister.
DOORMAN
Ha! Impossible! The new Prime Minister isn't seeing anybody! [slams the window shut]
MIME
Oh well, so much for zat. [turns around and slowly walks away]
STEVE
Yeah, we gave it our best, but our best wasn't good enough, eh? [joins the Mime]
KYLE
No. No!! [knocks on the door again. Steve and the Mime turn around]
DOORMAN
[opens his window again] Yes?
KYLE
Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me.
DOORMAN
[a big smug] The Prime Minister isn't here. He's in China on official business. So you might as well go home. Good-bye!
KYLE
[turns around and walks off slowly] Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back. [sits down on the steps farther away from the door]
CARTMAN
And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents. [sits on the steps]
STAN
And... I'm not gonna have a Christmas adventure. [sits between the two of them]
KENNY
(And I'll just fuckin' die again...) [his voice trails off and he joins the others on the steps. They all cry]
DOORMAN
[begins to cry with the boys] Oh please! Please stop crying.
CARTMAN
[through his tears] I'm gonna kill you, Kyle.
DOORMAN
All right all right, I was lying. The Prime Minister IS here.
KYLE
[turns around] Really? [the boys stand and approach the doors]
DOORMAN
Yes yes. Come in. [opens the large wooden doors, and the group enters.]
[The Parliament building, inside. The group walks down a long hallway and approach a large sanctum with three fire pits. Two small ones burn before and on each side of the huge one, which sits at the center and has a holograph of the Prime Minister hovering over it]
PRIME MINISTER
I am the Prime Minister of Canada. What do you guys want?
KYLE
[after a few moments, steps forth] Sir, you recently passed a new law allowing parents who have given their children up for adoption to change their minds. My little brother was-
SCOTT
Not so fast! [soon appears with the Gintses]
KYLE
Ike!
IKE
Kyle!
SCOTT
Prime Minister, these are the child's Canadian parents! Their Canadian blood pumps through his veins! Would you send him back to America with those world-hungry scum?!
KYLE
Please, sir. I came because I don't think Ike belongs here. Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you. We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother. We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and that makes us more family than anything. [Harry and Elise look at each other]
PRIME MINISTER
That is a great speech, guy. But the answer is no! All of my new laws will stay in effect forever!
SCOTT
Haha, you lose, Americans!
RICK
Then, I suppose us mounties will never get our horses.
MIME
And we won't get our wine.
STEVE
And we can't perform sodomy, eh?
KYLE
But why are you making such strange laws??
PRIME MINISTER
I SAID GO! [a blast from his holographic eyes incinerates Kenny]
KENNY
(Aah!) [Kenny explodes and pieces of him splatter all over the boys]
STAN
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
KYLE
[walks over to the charred remains] You... bastards! [brushes off a bit of Kenny from his jacket] Wha, what the hell is wrong with you?? What kind of Prime Minister bases his decisions on hatred? [Stan dusts himself off] And, and takes away mounties' horses? [Stan notices a purple curtain nearby and walks over to it] And French people's wine? What the hell kind of Prime Minister are you, anyway?!
PRIME MINISTER
I am the Prime Minister of Canada. [as he says this, Stan pulls the curtain back and Saddam Hussein appears behind it, cramped behind a console] I can do whatever I- [notices his cover is blown] Uh oh. Uh, don't mind that guy hiding in the spider hole, he's just my friend.
KYLE
[the other members of the group gather in, as well as other people nearby] What the hell??
RICK
Hey, that looks like Saddam Hussein!
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Saddam Hussein?? Naw, relax, buddah. I'm not him.
MIME
Zat explains everything! Za new Prime Minister was Saddam Hussein, once again trying to take over our beloved Canada like he did before.
SOLDIER 1
Saddam Hussein?
SOLDIER 2
He was fooling us?
BUSINESSMAN
Get him! [the soldiers quickly seize him and haul him away]
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Ahh, don't shoot. I want to negotiate. Hey, relax! [the crowd pounces on him and tear him apart] Gah!
RICK
Wait a minute. This means all the Prime Minister's new laws are null and void. We can have our horses back!
MIME
And we can drink our wine.
STEVE
And I can sodomize me boys again
HARRY
[brings Ike over to Kyle] Young man, you... must really care for Peter to have come all this way.
ELISE
Perhaps we were wrong to try and take Peter back. He doesn't belong here. He belongs with his family.
HARRY
[gently drops Ike to the floor] Peter, would you like to go back to your home in Colorado? [Ike walks over to Kyle and hugs him. Kyle returns the hug, and the Gintses hug as well, looking at the bond between Kyle and Ike. An alarm goes off. Cartman looks at his watch]
STAN
What is that?
CARTMAN
It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada.
KYLE
Well yeah, but ah-I got my brother back.
CARTMAN
Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents! [takes off his mittens] And what did I tell you, Kyle?! [unbuttons his jacket, takes it off, and bunches it up] I told you that if we didn't make it back in time for Christmas I was gonna whup your ass, didn't I?! [tosses his jacket away]
KYLE
Dude, come on.
CARTMAN
Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker! That's right! You and me! Right now! [puts up his fists] We're havin' it out! Let's go! Come on! Come on!! [Kyle puts up his fists and gives Cartman a quick right hook across the face. Cartman's eye twitches a few times before he begins to bawl while he's crying.] Mooooooom! Moooooooom!
RICK
Hey, come on, boys! You can spend Christmas with us, Canada style!
[Ottawa, day. A Christmas parade goes by and the crowds cheer and throw confetti. Saddam is paraded on his own float, with huge candy canes around him.]
CANADIANS
Ding dong, they caught Saddam! Merry Christmas to the world!
Ding dong, the Americans caught Saddam!
[Santa's sleigh passes by and the boys are hoisted into it]
Now Canada is free for you and you and me
