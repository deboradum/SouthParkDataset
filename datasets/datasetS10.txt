synopsis:Chef returns to South Park after spending time away with a group called, "The Super Adventure Club", but when his strange behavior starts getting him in trouble, the boys risk everything to save him.

script:The Return of Chef

["Previously on South Park" Daytime. Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny are playing with their toy trucks and cars under a tree in the neighborhood park. The basketball court, slide, and grass are cleared of snow. Stan runs up to them']
STAN
You guys, you guys! Chef is going away. [the others look up at him]
KYLE
Going away? For how long?
STAN
Forever.
[Cut to the boys in the school kitchen, watching Chef pack up his apron]
CHEF
I'm sorry boys.
[Cut to Chef in a bookstore]
STAN
Chef said he's been bored, so he joining a group called the Super Adventure Club. [Chef opens a pamphlet about the club]
CHEF
Wow!
[Cut to Chef in Mrs. Garrison's classroom]
MRS. GARRISON
Chef?? What kind of questions do you think adventuring around the world is gonna answer?!
CHEF
What's the meaning of life? Why are we here?
MRS. GARRISON
I hope you're making the right choice.
[Cartman's house, day. Cartman crying in front of Butters, in the middle of the living room]
CARTMAN
I'm gonna miss him. [Butters walks forward a few steps and puts his hand on the sofa] I'm gonna miss Chef and I...and I don't know how to tell him! [turns his head left and cries into his left arm]
[Stan and Kyle sit on a log by Stark's Pond watching the sunset]
STAN
Dude, how are we gonna go on? Chef was our fuh...f-ffriend. [Kyle draws close and hugs him]
[Cut to a meeting room in City Hall. The room is decorated with balloons and a sign saying "Good Luck, Chef!!" hangs over the town mayor]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
And we will all miss you, Chef, [Chef watches from a nearby table] but we know you must do what your heart tells you..
[Dusk. Chef boards a Super Adventure Club jet. The town is out to see him off at the airport.]
JIMBO
Bye-bye!
GERALD
Good-bye!
MR. MACKEY
So long!
A MAN
So long Chef!
A SIGN-HOLDER
Good-bye, Chef!
RANDY
Good-bye, Chef! Have a good time at the Super Adventure Club!
CHEF
[waves] Good-bye! [goes into the plane and disappears from the door. The door closes and the plane taxis away. The town waves good-bye to Chef again and Cartman bawls uncontrollably in a high-pitched voice. The plane climbs into the sky]..
[And now, Part Two of "Life Without Chef" The boys are playing Uno in Stan's house. Their insults to each other are flat now that Chef is gone.']
KYLE
Draw two card, fatass.
CARTMAN
[draws two and puts one down] Reverse to you, Jew. [the doorbell rings]
STAN
[irritable] I'll get it. [rises and walks over. He opens the door...]
CHEF
Hello there, children!
STAN
He's back!
KYLE
Yeah!
CARTMAN
All right! [applause comes out of nowhere. Chef gives them a hug]
KYLE
Chef! I can't believe you're back!
CHEF
Well, it's true.
STAN
But are you back for good?
CHEF
That's right.
['The bar, daytime. Mrs. Garrison bursts through the door with the big news.']
MRS. GARRISON
Hey everybody! Chef's back!
PATRONS
What? All right! Yeah! [they clear the bar to meet Chef]
RANDY
Oh, finally! [prances away gleefully after the others]
['Jimbo's house, later. Jimbo serves up lemonade. Everyone is laughing at Chef's tales, but they quiet down']
GERALD
Wow! It seems like you had a great time with the Super Adventure Club, Chef. They sound like interesting people.
CHEF
Yeah!
MRS. GARRISON
But now that you're back here, does that mean you're not in the Super Adventure Club anymore?
CHEF
N-No! No.
RANDY
Ohhh, so have you decided you can still belong to the Super Adventure Club but live here in South Park again?
CHEF
That's right.
RANDY
Well, it seems like the Super Adventure Club was just what you needed, Chef. You must be feeling very happy that you found a club to belong to with new friends, but that you can also live here in South Park with all your old friends whom you care for deeply. [catches his breath] Right?
CHEF
That's right, Randy! [everyone laughs approvingly]
JIMBO
Well Chef, you're welcome to stay with me until you buy another house.
CHEF
Thank you, Jimbo.
RANDY
Well, come on everybody. I'm sure Chef would like a little time to get moved back in.
CHEF
That's right! Thank you. Good-bye everybody.
TOWNSFOLK
Later. Great to have you back. Bye-bye. See ya Chef. See you later. Bye-bye.
KYLE
Well, I- guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef.
CHEF
You bet! Good-bye, children! [the boys are puzzled at the way he's replying to them. It sounds choppy.]
STAN
Right. Uh, see ya.
['Outside Jimbo's house. The boys walk down the steps and move towards the sidewalk']
CARTMAN
Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you?
STAN
[stops. The others stop too. Stan looks up] Well, look. he said he's happier now. Maybe he just needs to rest up a little.
KYLE
Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring.
STAN
[turns left and cross the street. The others follow] Yeah, but whatever, I'm just glad he's back for good.
KENNY
(muffled) Yeah, me too.
['South Park Elementary, lunchtime. The floor is darker now.']
A BOY
[at one of the tables] It's really weird what he said, I don't know, it kind of confused me.
CARTMAN
Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again.
KYLE
Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles! [a distraught Clyde walks by and stops.]
CLYDE
Something's wrong with Chef. He's saying some really weird stuff.
KYLE
Like what?
CLYDE
I think...[glances at his food] I think he wants to have sex with me.
STAN
What??
CLYDE
I gotta- I gotta go. [turns right and walks off]
KYLE
Weirdo. [Fosse moves up and gets his lunch; the boys follow him in]
CHEF
Hello there, children!
THE BOYS
Hey Chef.
CHEF
How's it goin'?
KYLE
Good.
CHEF
Well, how about I meet you boys after work and we make love?
CARTMAN
[The boys are stunned] Excuse me?
CHEF
Come on, children! You're my sexual fantasy. Let's all make sweet love.
KYLE
...Chef?? A-are you ok?
CHEF
I want to stick my balls inside your rectum, Kyle.
STAN
Dude, what are you saying??
CHEF
I'm gonna make love to your asshole, children.
STAN
...WHAT??
['Mr. Mackey's office, later. A detective is walking into the class']
DET. JARVIS
Hi kids, I'm Detective Jarvis. I need to ask you all some difficult questions about your school cafeteria chef.
KYLE
This doesn't make any sense!
DET. JARVIS
We have some information that all this time Chef has been and still is a pedophile.
STAN
No he's not.
DET. JARVIS
[childish voice] Uh huh.
STAN
No he's not.
DET. JARVIS
[childish voice] Yeah, yeah he is so.
BUTTERS
What's a pedophile?
DET. JARVIS
Now, we need some testimony in order to arrest Chef, [whips out generic plush doll with no features on it] so I'm gonna use this doll to ask you kids a few questions. Did Chef ever touch any of you... here? [points to the genital area]
STAN
NO!
DET. JARVIS
Ok, did he touch you here? [moves two fingers over the groin]
THE CLASS
NO!
DET. JARVIS
[sits the doll on his right lap and starts rubbing the doll's nipples] Did he ever do this? How about this? [lifts the doll to his face and wags his tongue over the doll's genital area]
BUTTERS
My Uncle Bud did that to me once! [smiles unwittingly]
DET. JARVIS
[gets off the desk and walks around] Did Chef ever try one of these on for size? [places the doll face down on the desk and starts humping it]
KYLE
Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here!
DET. JARVIS
[continues humping] Young man, will you PLEASE pay attention! This is very important stuff! Ohhh. Ohhhhhh.
['South Park Elementary, after school. The kids pour out of the school. The boys come out last, and the doors close. Chef appears before them']
CHEF
Hello there, children!
KYLE
[the boys look at each other] Chef, the police are asking questions about you!
CHEF
Oh really? Well, let's all go home and make love.
STAN
No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you!
CHEF
Kenny, how would you like to sodomize my black ass?
KYLE
Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?!
CHEF
I specialize in your asshole, Kyle. [turns and walks away]
CARTMAN
...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex.
KYLE
He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things.
KENNY
(muffled) Like what?
KYLE
Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex.
STAN
Well look, he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him.
KENNY
(muffled) Yeah! I say we go to that adventurers' club right now and get to the bottom of this shit once and for all!
CARTMAN
Yeah!
KYLE
All right, come on guys!
['The Super Adventure Club, day. The club is a rambling house several stories tall, and access to it is just one ragged rope bridge. The entrance to the bridge reads "Super Adventure Club." The boys approach it calmly and walk upon the bridge.']
CARTMAN
Hey you guys, you know what they call a Jewish woman's boobs? Jewbs. [they step off on the other side and approach the front door. Stan reaches over and pulls the rope that rings the house's bell. A black butler opens up]
BUTLER
May I help you?
KYLE
Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something?
BUTLER
Right this way. [the boys enter and the butler leads them]
HEAD ADVENTURER
Now, the upper rim of Kilimanjaro should be quite a trek, and so we'll need to have a-
BUTLER
Excuse me, sir. These boys wanted to speak with you.
HEAD ADVENTURER
Ahh yes, splendid! Good afternoon, lads! I'm Head Adventurer William P. Connolly, Esquire! Welcome, to the Super Adventure Club!
CLUB MEMBERS
Tally ho!
MR. CONNOLLY
Indeed!
KYLE
Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids. [the members just look around]
MR. CONNOLLY
What? Well... well yes, of course! That's what the Super Adventure Club does!
MARKSMAN
We travel around the world and have sex with children!
MARINE
Yes, what else would we do?
KYLE
Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff!
MR. CONNOLLY
Noo, no, that's the Adventure Club. We're the Super Adventure Club! [turns and approaches a world map from maybe two centuries ago] Next week, we'll be heading to the outer banks of the Amazon, where we will make camp and have sex with children of the Ugani tribe, then it's off to the mighty Himalayas, where we will climb K-2, and molest several Tibetan children on the east summit.
KYLE
...Dude!
MR. CONNOLLY
I know, but it gets even better! From there we will kayak to the fruitful banks of the Mele River in Africa, where the secret and mysterious Hanimi people have children who have never seen a white man's erect penis. Of course, we're always looking for kids to have sex with on the plane rides over to these places, so how would you ALL like to join the Super Adventure Club!
STAN
NO!!
MR. CONNOLLY
No? Oh really? Perhaps I should ask you again? [whips out a portable hypnotizer and makes some whistling sound effects] How would you like to join the Super Adventure Club? [more sound effects]
STAN
[unnaffected] No! [Mr. Connolly tries harder, even stepping forward...]
KYLE
Dude, what are you doing?
MR. CONNOLLY
[looks at his machine] Oh well, it doesn't work on everybody. [hides it behind his back] Well, so long then.
KYLE
Just what the hell is that thing?!
MR. CONNOLLY
What? What thing? I don't see anything.
KYLE
HA! I knew it!
STAN
Knew what?
KYLE
The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this - fruity little club!
CARTMAN
Oh, son of a bitch!
['Robert J. Neeland, psychiatry. Chef and the boys are in the waiting room with a woman reading a magazine.']
CHEF
Come on, Children. Let's all go home and make love.
STAN
You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good.
CHEF
I just like to make love up your butt.
WOMAN
[turns away] Oh my God!
NURSE
[comes out to get the next patient]Mr. Chef, is it?
KYLE
All right, come on. [they follow the nurse in]
DR.NEELAND
Hello, I'm Dr. Neeland. What can I do for you today?
KYLE
Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club.
DR. NEELAND
[approaches Chef] Brainwashed?
STAN
Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr.
DR. NEELAND
I thought that club was for hiking and kayaking.
STAN
No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children.
DR. NEELAND
Oh. ...Oh, that's right, yeah.
CHEF
Doctor, do you have- children?
DR. NEELAND
Why, yes, I have two young boys.
CHEF
Have you all been sodomizing your children too?
DR. NEELAND
You say he's never been like this before?
CARTMAN
No, Chef has always been super-cool.
CHEF
I'm gonna make love to the children.
DR. NEELAND
He's pretty brainwashed all right. Worst case I've ever seen.
CARTMAN
So what can we do??
DR. NEELAND
I'm afraid there's no simple answer. When somebody's brainwashed it can take months, even years, to reverse the process.
KYLE
But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever!
DR. NEELAND
Tell me, what was Chef's favorite thing to do before it was having sex with children?
STAN
Having sex with women.
DR. NEELAND
Then that's it. We'd better get your friend to the Peppermint Hippo right away.
[The Peppermint Hippo. The place is busy with pole dancers doing what they do best and so on.]
DJ
All right guys. be sure to tip the waitresses; this is two for one; put your hands together, this is Monique!
CHEF
[a long-haired blonde tries to excite him] Aw, come on, children. Let's go home.
STAN
This isn't working.
DR. NEELAND
WEll let's...give it some time, kids. [a brunette is keeping him busy]]
BLAZE
[coarse voice] Would you like to daaance???
KYLE
No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend.
BLAZE
[walks away] Daaance??? Anybody wanna daaance???
CARTMAN
Come on, bitch! Dance!
BLONDE
Up yours, fatty.
CARTMAN
Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off!
DJ
All right guys, help me feel it out to them; we got a featured dancer coming out next; put your hands together for... Spantaneous Bootay! [an immense black stripper walks out, down the runway, and to the stripper pole, stout enough to hold her up. Chef leans his head to the right to get a better look.]
STAN
Come on guys, we might as well go. [the boys prepare to leave. The obese stripper can move, though, and Chef is interested. He drops the blonde off and approaches the stage]
CHEF
God-damn!
STAN
Chef, we're leaving.
DR. NEELAND
No-no wait. Let him go. [Chef moves closer and stands in awe of Spantaneous Bootay]
SPONTANEOUS BOOTAY
[walks up to Chef] Come here, chubby. [buries his face between her breasts and rattles it with them, then turns around and buries his face between her ass cheeks and rattles it with them as well. She releases him from their hold]
CHEF
Wait a minute.
STAN
He's remembering.
CHEF
Children! What have I done?
CARTMAN
It's ok Chef, Go on, remember!
CHEF
I'm goinna- I'm gonna-
KYLE
Come on, Chef! You can do it!
CHEF
I'm gonna make love to you woman, 'gonna lay you down by the fire!
THE BOYS
Yay!
KENNY
(muffled) Chef!
CHEF
Hey children, everybody! I'm back! [a tranquilizer dart flies in on his left side and strikes him under the ear, behind the jaw, and his smile vanishes] Ow.
MR. CONNOLLY
[The Club is there] Great shot, William! Hit him with another. [William, dressed in outback gear, blows another dart out through a tube. This one lands in Chef's left arm]
CHEF
Oh! [gets groggy quickly and drops like a sack of potatoes]
THE BOYS
Chef!
['Super Adventure Club, a stormy night']
[Mr. Connolly]
STAN
Where's Chef?! What have you done with him?!
MR. CONNOLLY
He's safe. [presses a remote control. The main screen comes on and Chef is shown strapped down to a bed while William sits in a chair at its foot] He's fasting in the Deprivation Room and being read the Super Adventure Club manual. We've got to undo the damage you've done.
CARTMAN
Look, If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?!
MR. CONNOLLY
We don't need him, he needs us! Our club offers hope. Do you think we go around the world molesting children just because it feels really really really really good?! No! Our club has a message! And a secret that explains the mysteries of life!
STAN
Oh Jesus, here we go.
MR. CONNOLLY
Very well. I'm now going to tell you the secret of the Super Adventure Club.
STAN
We don't wanna hear it.
MR. CONNOLLY
You see, the Super Adventure Club was founded by the greatest explorer of all time, William P. Phinehas! [a gregarious man with an open smile in the picture] Phinehas climbed the highest peaks, tamed the mightiest rivers, [a shot of him climbing up a mountain] but every time he got somewhere, he realized that other explorers had beat him to it. [A shot of Phinehas reaching a summit, only to find two Brits there, celebrating] Phinehas was depressed, until he realized that if he couldn't be the first to discover places, he could be the first to have sex with the native children that inhabited those areas! [Phinehas with some Australian natives] Phinehas quickly went down in history books as the first man to have sex with the Aborigine children at Uluru, and the first explorer to bugger all the underage mountainfolk of Nepal. [a shot of him with those kids] But now the most wonderful part. You see, after having sex with all those children, Phinehas realized that... molesting all those kids... had made him immortal.
STAN
Immortal?
MR. CONNOLLY
He discovered that children have things called marlocks in their bodies. [a graphic of kid bodies appears, and bright dots dapple them and move around] And when an adult has sex with a child, the marlocks implode, feeding the adult receptive cavity with energy that causes immortality, so saith the ruler of Bethos. [a blue monster alien with a bright red crown. Next shot, Phinehas in the gondola of a hot-air balloon with several boys] Phinehas traveled the world, loving many, many children, and he lived for eternity. Until he was hit by a train in 1892. [a shot of Phinehas' body on the train's bumper]
KYLE
...Do you realize how retarded that sounds?
MR. CONNOLLY
Is it any more retarded than the idea of God sending his son to die for our sins? Is it any more retarded than Buddha sitting beneath a tree for twenty years?
STAN
Yeah, it's way, way more retarded.
MR. CONNOLLY
Well, now that you know our club secrets, it appears you ... leave us no choice. I'm afraid we're going to have to... ask you to leave. [dramatic fanfare]
STAN
We're not leaving without Chef.
MR. CONNOLLY
If you choose not to leave, then I'm afraid we're just going to have to ... call security and make you leave. [dramatic fanfare] You'll be let out by security and it will be super-embarrassing and everyone here will see! [laughs more and more sinisterly. Moments later...] Okay, you know how like, when you want people to leave but they won't leave, it's really frustrating?
KYLE
We're not going anywhere without Chef.
MR. CONNOLLY
Cool people leave before they've overstayed their welcome. [the boys do not move] You petulant fools! You just had to push it, didn't you? You don't realize who you're dealing with here. Security! [two officers come out and stand behind the boys] Take these boys to the door.
GUARD 1
All right, come on kids.
KYLE
No! Hey!
MR. CONNOLLY
[the lights come on] Haha! Look they're being led by security! Haha!
STAN
[to one of the guards] No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room!
GUARD 2
This is their house and they don't want you here. [about to push Stan out the door. Kyle grabs a bat from a nearby jar and whacks the second guard in the back and the first guard on the legs. They both fall. The boys run towards the Deprivation Room]
KYLE
Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend!
[''The Deprivation Room. William reads to Chef]
WILLIAM
And sex with Eskimo children requires some special skills. [the boys break the door down]
KYLE
Chef, come on!
CHEF
Childern!
WILLIAM
Get out of here!
CARTMAN
Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash!
KENNY
[launches himself into a spinning projectile] (muffled) Yeeeeehah! [smashes William's groin. William doubles over in pain]
STAN
[rushes up to Chef] Come on, Chef!
CHEF
[struggling] I can't...break these locks. [those are solid locks indeed]
KYLE
Here! [walks up to the fallen William, gets a small ax from him, walks up to Chef and chops the locks open. They escape the Deprivation Room]
['The club's living room. The boys run through it on the way out.']
CARTMAN
Run Chef!
MR. CONNOLLY
[turns to see what's happening] What the-? Impossible! I made them leave!
KYLE
Get outside! [chef and the boys reach the front doors]
MR. CONNOLLY
Stop them! [he leads the adventurers in the charge]
['Outside the club. Chef and the boys run out, heading for the bridge']
CHEF
Children! Run! [they run to the other end of the bridge]
MR. CONNOLLY
Stop! [his group runs out of the club. Stan and the others reach the other side]
STAN
We made it!
MR. CONNOLLY
[calling out] Don't you remember why you left South Park in the first place?? [Chef stops in his tracks]
STAN
Chef, come on!
MR. CONNOLLY
You sought adventure! And why do people seek adventure? Because their lives have become dull and empty!
KYLE
Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef? [Chef's hesitance shoes a dilemma] Chef?
MR. CONNOLLY
Don't forget all your training, Chef! Stay with us and your life will be GRAND and ETERNAL!
STAN
[softly] Chef, we love you.
CHEF
[his eyes shift back and forth with his thoughts] I'm sorry children. [turns and walks towards the club]
KYLE
No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that??
CHEF
Get the hell out of here, children!
MR. CONNOLLY
Yesss. Looks like our fruity little club is safe after all. [a fierce flash of lightning tears the bridge in two, right behind Chef. Fire leaps on him and he screams] NO! [The club end of the bridge smashes into the cliff]
THE BOYS
Chef! [Chef tries to scramble up the bridge, but the fire is too fast and consumes it. He can't climb. The club members approach the edge of the cliff. One of them inadvertently kicks a stone off and it hits Chef, knocking him off the bridge and to his doom below.]
CHEF
Ack. [He bounces off five jagged rocks before finally...] Ow! Oh! Ah! Oh! Damnit! [...landing on the jagged stub of wood piercing through some rocks, which impales him] Ah- Awww! [blood spreads out under him]
STAN
NO! [Chef struggles to get up, but can't move. A mountain lion leaps down into view]
CARTMAN
A mountain lion! [the lion grabs at Chef's right arm, but is having trouble ripping it off]
MR. CONNOLLY
We can't lose another member! Shoot it! [the marksman aims and fires]
CHEF
Ah!
MARKSMAN
All right, this! [fires twice, but the lion remains unaffected and continues pulling at Chef's arm]
KYLE
[heartbroken] CHEF! [a huge bear appears]
CARTMAN
A grizzly bear!
['the bear stands on its hind legs and roars at the lion, who lets go of Chef and runs up to the challenge. The lion leaps on the bear, trying to go for the jugular, but the bear grabs it and throws it off. The lion hits a cliff wall and falls onto the ground, dazed, but quickly gets up and sinks its fangs into Chef's head. Chef's face and left eye are ripped off and Chef is left babbling. The lion bites into Chef's right arm again while the bear has a hold of Chef's right foot, and at the same time, bear and lion each take a limb. Chef's legs and hips rip away from his torso, and Chef is effectively dead. The bear and lion walk off in different directions with their meals. The boys stare at Chef's remains in horror]]
STAN
Oh my God...They killed Chef!
KYLE
You bastards. YOU BASTARDS!!
MR. CONNOLLY
Pity. He would have made an excellent child molester. [the men turn and go back to the clubhouse]
CARTMAN
Maybe- maybe he's still okay. [the other boys look at him, dumbfounded] No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your-
CHEF
POOOT! [a mean final fart, and a soiled log falls out]
CARTMAN
Oh never mind.
STAN
Come on, let's go.
['South Park, a nice, sunny day. Spring is in the air. and a funeral for Chef is set in the town square. A long line of people are paying their respects. Mrs. Garrison steps up to the coffin, and Principal Victoria stands next to her for support. Down in the coffin is a spatula with a red ribbon around it. Kyle steps up to the podium, on which sits a picture of Chef and on the front of which hangs a wreath with the banner "R.I.P. CHEF."']
KYLE
We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days. [Elton John is present] Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us. [Stan, Cartman and Kenny look down at their feet] But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile. [they perk up a bit] I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song. [Timmy and Jimmy are sitting together] I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by. [Terrance and Phillip are present, weeping quietly] So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains.
RANDY
Yeah.
MR. MACKEY
He's right. [soft applause rises from the crowd]
KYLE
And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all. [smiles]
['The SAC house, operating room. The club members have gone down to retrieve Chef and put him on the table. Mr. Connolly and two of his men quickly get to work']
MR. CONNOLLY
Is it working? Is it working?
TECH
Yes. We've got a pulse!
MR. CONNOLLY
Get him in the ICU suit! Hurry! [an ICU suit is fitted onto Chef] We have done it! Good! Raise him up! [Chef and the operating table are tilted upright - but this Chef looks like Darth Vader. He has a glowing red spatula in his right hand] Chef, can you hear me? Say something.
DARTH CHEF
Hello there, children. How would you like some Salisbury Steak?
MR. CONNOLLY
Yes, go on.
DARTH CHEF
And for desert, how would you children like to suck on my chocolate salty balls?
MR. CONNOLLY
Oh? You mean like chocolate candy?
DARTH CHEF
No, I mean my balls.
MR. CONNOLLY
Yes, YES! Hahahahahahaaa!
End of The Return of Chef


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Kyle and his family are moving to San Francisco. The only way Stan can get his best friend back is to convince everyone to start driving hybrid cars.

script:Smug Alert!

[Downtown South Park, day. A hybrid car zips along Main Street. Gerald is driving it, with Kyle and Ike in the back seat and Ike safely tocked into his car seat behind Gerald. He stops in front of the Tweek house. The car has "hybrid" plastered all over it]
GERALD
Hey there, Richard!
RICHARD
[stops shoveling snow and stands up] Oh, hey Gerald. New car?
GERALD
Yeah. It's a hybrid. I just... I just couldn't sit back and- [closes his eyes as if to banish bad thoughts] be a part of destroying the earth anymore.
RICHARD
Well... Good for you.
GERALD
Oho... [gives a thumbs up, closes his eyes and says with a slight falsetto] Thanks. [drives off and back into town, where Mr. Stotch and Mrs. Garrison observe him drive by]
STEPHEN
Well, there goes the new high-and-mighty Gerald Broflovski.
MRS. GARRISON
Yeah, ever since he got that new hybrid he thinks he's better than everyone else.
[An intersection. Gerald ends up abreast of an SUV and gets the driver's attention.]
GERALD
You know, the emissions from a vehicle like yours causes irreparable damage to the ozone. I drive a hybrid; it's much better for the environment. [begins to drive away, with his eyes closed] Thanks.
KYLE
Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off! [a quite-satisfied Gerald stops at the next intersection. Another hybrid car pulls up alongside him]
DRIVER
Hey, is that a hybrid?
GERALD
Oh yes. You've got one too, I see.
DRIVER
Yeah, I like to be a part of the solution and not part of the problem. Well, anyway, [sticks his thumb up through the passenger window] good for you!
GERALD
[sticks up his thumb in return and begins to drive away with his eyes closed] Thanks.
KYLE
[firmly] Dad, I think Ike is starving to death. [Ike's eyes are half-closed and he's getting woozy]
GERALD
Hold on, boys. We still have to go to the hardware store, and hand out awareness citations to SUV cars in the parking lot.
KYLE
What?!
[True-Value Hardware and Home Improvement. Gerald begins posting citations on cars. He and his boys are wearing orange safety vests. Kyle and Ike are none too pleased about having to do this]
GERALD
Okay, there's another one. [smiles and looks up after posting a citation on a green car] Aw, man! Look at that! [walks two cars over] Can you believe this?! An SUV with a V8 engine, makes me sick! [begins writing up a citation] "Ticket for driving a gas-guzzler"
KYLE
[catches up] Dad, can we go home, please?
GERALD
Look, there's a Jeep over there! Go write them a ticket, Kyle!
KYLE
But Dad, I want-
GERALD
NOW, KYLE! [Kyle's eyelids drop and he goes to write the citation. He and Stan cross paths]
STAN
Oh hey Kyle.
KYLE
Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here?
STAN
Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing?
KYLE
[his head drops] Helping my Dad give people fake tickets. [Randy reaches his red SUV and notices the citation on his windshield]
RANDY
What's this? [takes the citation and reads it]
GERALD
Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket.
RANDY
A ticket? "Failure to care about the environment" Oh Goddammit, did you do this, Gerald?!
GERALD
Yeah. I'm just, you know, trying to make people more aware ya' know, it's a-
RANDY
You got some nerve, you know that?! Where do you come off ticketing people?!
GERALD
Well, Randy, calm down. It's not a real ticket.
RANDY
I know it's not a real ticket!!
JIMBO
[approaches] Broflovski, did you put this crap on my windshield?! [Randy crosses his arms]
GERALD
Jimbo, your truck probably gets less than ten miles to the gallon.
JIMBO
[crumples the ticket into a wad and throws it down] Well thanks, Officer Dickhole!
KYLE
Dad, let's just go!
GERALD
Look, I'm just trying to make the people of South Park aware of a very serious problem.
RANDY
The problem, Gerald, is that ever since you got a hybrid car, you've gotten so smug that you love the smell of your own farts!
GERALD
Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't think it was "high and mighty" to [closes his eyes] care about the earth!
RANDY
And that too! Stop talking with your eyes closed! That's what smug people do!
GERALD
Well, I really don't see how [closes his eyes] that has anything to do with the-
RANDY
There, like that! Stop that!
DARRYL
Who the hell put this faggy fake ticket on my truck!
GERALD
All right, that does it! Come on, Kyle, I don't want you hanging around with these ignorant idiots! [they walk away, and Ike bounces along]
[The Broflovski kitchen, night. Gerald and Sheila chat as Sheila washes dishes]
GERALD
Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best we just do it right away.
KYLE
[walks into the kitchen with Ike] Dad. [his parents turn to face him] Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you.
GERALD
[closes his eyes] Yes, it certainly is.
KYLE
We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too... [rolls his eyes]
IKE
Take offense.
KYLE
...a-are starting to take offense at your actions. We feel like you're starting to become-hmm... [rolls his eyes again and cues Ike]
IKE
[slowly] Alienated.
KYLE
...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends.
GERALD
Well, I totally agree, Kyle.
KYLE
You do??
GERALD
Yes. A lot of people in town just aren't ready to drive hybrid cars.
KYLE
Righ! [grins] Okay, good.
GERALD
And that's why, [hugs Sheila by the shoulder] I've talked it over with your mother, and [releases the hug] ...we've decided to MOVE!
KYLE
What??
GERALD
We need to be where everyone is motivated and progressive like us! Start getting your things packed, boys! The Broflovksi family is moving to San Francisco! [grins. Kyle and Ike look stunned]
[Stan's room, day. Stan has a book open, but his thoughts are elsewhere. Someone knocks on his door]
STAN
Yeah? [the door opens and Butters enters]
BUTTERS
Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over. Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle.
STAN
Going away party? What do you mean?
BUTTERS
Well don't you know? Kyle's movin' away.
STAN
[jumps off his chair and looks at Butters] Moving away?? Kyle can't move away!
BUTTERS
Well he is.
STAN
Where's the going-away party?
BUTTERS
At Cartman's house.
[Cartman's house. There is indeed a party there, but Kyle isn't visible among the guests. The other fourth-graders are enjoying themselves. A banner above the sofa reads: GOODBYE KYLE]
CARTMAN
[walks into the living room with a pitcher and cups of pop] Hey everybody! There's more pop in the refrigerator. Let's make this the best going-away party EVER! [blows into a noisemaker and makes it stick out. Other kids walk up and take cups away]
TOLKIEN
Hey Eric, where's Kyle?
CARTMAN
Who? [smiles innocently]
CLYDE
Kyle, the person leaving.
CARTMAN
Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle?
CRAIG
Dude, a going-away party is supposed to be for the person who is going away!
STAN
[enters the house and the other boys move a bit] Kyle? Kyle!
CLYDE
Kyle's not here. Cartman didn't invite him.
STAN
What?!
CARTMAN
You guys, this is our party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving! Come on, everyone! Let's sing! [Stan leaves]'Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye Kyle!
[Kyle's house, front lawn, day. His family is almost finished packing everything into the moving van]
STAN
Kyle! Du-what is going on?!
KYLE
My Dad says he can't live here anymore.
STAN
Mr. Broflovski, please. Kyle's my best friend.
GERALD
I'm sorry, Stan, but unfortunately you live in a small-minded town filled with ignorant boobs.
STAN
Well... Maybe they'll change.
GERALD
[puts a small box into the trunk] I wouldn't count on it. Come on, boys, get in the car! [Kyle and Ike head towards it]
STAN
Nooo!
GERALD
[opens the back right door, and the boys climb in] Maybe you can make a difference, Stan. [closes the door] Maybe you can get everyone to drive hybrid cars. Until that day, [walks around to the driver's side] we're just gonna have to be [closes his eyes] with our own kind. [gets in and begins to drive away. Stan steps into the street and watches them go]
STAN
I will. I will get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it!
[San Francisco, day. The city is seen from the north, with the Golden Gate Bridge in the foreground. All around is a brown haze that hangs over the city, but people don't seem to notice it. Another shot has a streetcar go by as San Franciscans go about their day. The third shot is Chinatown, the fourth is the Haight-Ashbury district with hippies everywhere. The last shot is of a row of houses stepping up a hill. The moving van stops in front of one of them. The Broflovskis move into their new home]
GERALD
Well? What do you think, huh? [the boxes are present, but as yet unpacked]
SHEILA
Oh Gerald, it's beautiful.
GERALD
Yeah. Now THIS, is a house. [some neighbors stop in]
MAN
Oh hello there, you must be the new neighbors.
GERALD
Yes that's right. We're the Broflovskis.
MAN
Welcome to San Francisco. I'm Peter Thompson. This is my wife, Nancy Jarvis, and our son, Brian Thompson-Jarvis [sucking on something purple] So how do you like the neighborhood?
SHEILA
Oh it's gorgeous. These old houses are so neat.
PETER
Yes, well, unlike most cities, in San Francisco we try to [closes his eyes] keep all the historic houses instead of knocking them down.
MAN 2
[approaches the front entrance] You in here, Peter?
PETER
Oh hay, Paul. Come on in and meet the Broflovskis
PAUL
Hello there. I'm Paul McDonahue. This is my wife, Paulie Beaumont-McCallahan, and our daughter, Mindy McDonahue-Beaumont-McCallahan
GERALD AND SHEILA
Hello.
PAUL
We noticed your hybrid out front - that's a V series, right?
GERALD
Yeah. That's right.
PETER
Whoa, nice car, but we're gonna have to get you into the BT series [closes his eyes] Its emissions are actually cleaner.
GERALD
Wow, so, everyone here drives a hybrid, huh?
PETER
Oh, of course. We're a little more progressive and ahead of the curve here in San Francisco. [farts, then bends over to take it all in, then stands up again] Ahhhm. [licks his lips to savor every last bit of fart] Anyway, I'm sure you'll find it much better here.
PAUL
Yes, you'll find that San Francisco is pretty much more open-minded and grown-up than the Midwest. [farts, then bends over to take it all in as if it were oxygen] Ahhh, [sniff] ahh, [sniff] ahh. [stands up] We're just a little bit more protective of our environment here in San Francisco
GERALD
Yeah. We sure are.
[South Park, Stan's house, night. Stan is on his bed working out a new song on his guitar. His door is open]
STAN
Come on, people. Come on, people now. [Cartman and Butters enter]
CARTMAN
Dude, what are you doing?
STAN
I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways.
CARTMAN
THAT's gay, heh.
STAN
Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!
CARTMAN
Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?
STAN
You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow.
CARTMAN
[fears that for a moment, then] Psh! Whatever dude. I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters. Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew! [walks out]
BUTTERS
Yeah! I'm a dumb Jew. [walks out after Cartman. Stan resumes composing]
STAN
Come on, people. Come on, people now.
[KXUV Radio Station. An extreme closeup of the host's booth.]
DJ
All right, all you dreamers and creamers out there out there in South Park, I'm gonna play a song by a local artist that really made me think about my impact on the earth. This is Stan Marsh with "Hey, People, You've Gotta Drive Hybrids Already". [Stan's intro begins to play]
STAN
Come on now, people now people now
People now, come on now, people now
Got to drive hybrids, people now
People now, people now, people now
Hybrids are for people now, people now
Group of people driving people now
Get a hybrid, be good people now.
[as he sings, the following takes place: FM 1 98.7 shows up, Randy notices his son singing, Jimbo notices his nephew singing, a stranger slumps a little in his car, Principal Victoria notices one of her students singing, other people stop to listen]
CUSTOMER
He's right. [people leave their cars and go to a Toyonda hybrid dealership]
STAN
We have all got to be people now
People-driving-hybrid people now
People now, people now, hybrid now
Hybrid-people-driving people now.
Come on, people, let's be people now
Hybrid-people-driving people now
Come on, everybody be people now
[as he sings, the following takes place: Randy joins the rush of customers checking out hybrids at the dealership, Jimbo drives off in his new red hybrid and pulls up next to the Stotches, who are driving their new hybrid as well. They give each other thumbs up and gloat a bit. Another driver pulls up alongside Randy and gives him a thumbs up. Randy returns the gesture. More people check out the dealership. Mrs.Tucker (Craig's mother) pulls up alongside Jimbo]
LAURA TUCKER
Hey Jimbo, you got a hybrid too?
JIMBO
Yeah, I just wanted to [closes his eyes] try to set an example, you know?
LAURA TUCKER
Yeah, I guess it's up to us to [closes her eyes] show everyone the way.[opens them] Good for you.
JIMBO
[cheerfully closes his eyes] Thanks. [drives off]
[At an intersection]
MRS. GARRISON
Can you believe some people still don't drive hybrids? [pets her own hybrid]
RANDY
I know! It's like "Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl".
[Mr. Mackey is parked amid a small crowd]
MR. MACKEY
Well from now on, I'm only going to associate with other hybrid-car drivers. Everyone else is just ignorant, m'kay?
[Two drivers going the same direction]
DRIVER 1
[eyes closed, thumb up] Good for you!
DRIVER 2
[eyes closed, thumb up] Thanks!
RANDY
[eyes closed, thumb up] At least we're smart enough to know better!
DRIVER 3
[leans out and looks back, eyes closed, thumb up] Thanks! [the street is now filled with hybrids]
STAN
Come on, everybody be people now
[South Park Town Square, day. The stage is set up for a speech. On the curtains is a banner with a flag over it. The banner reads: WAKE UP AMERICA!]
SPEAKER
And so we are here to honor Stan Marsh for making South Park the city with the highest percentage of hybrid owners in the country! [the crowd cheers]
RICHARD
If only the rest of the country [closes his eyes] was as insightful as we are.
STAN
[steps up and holds his trophy] Ah, thanks. I was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so... if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now. [steps down and walks off the stage. The crowd cheers]
JIMBO
Great speech!
GERALD
Yeah, well, you know my son is just [closes his eyes] a little bit more clever than some.
AN OFFICER
[stops Stan as Stan steps onto solid ground] Hello there, I'm Ranger McFriendly. I'm the person who watches over the delicate ecosystem of South Park. You must be the little boy who wrote that song.
STAN
Yeah.
RANGER MCFRIENDLY
Uhh! [smacks Stan on the left cheek enough to spin his head around]
STAN
Ow!
RANGER MCFRIENDLY
You son of a bitch! Do you have any idea what you've done?!
STAN
What?!
RANGER MCFRIENDLY
Come with me! [walks off. Stan follows]
[Ranger McFriendly and Stan walk to the top of a hill overlooking the town]
RANGER MCFRIENDLY
There! Look! [a dark brown cloud is showing hovering over the town]
STAN
Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before.
RANGER MCFRIENDLY
Don't you get it?! When people drive hybrid cars, they get so full of themselves they spew tons of self-satisfied garbage into the air! That isn't smog, it's smug!
STAN
Smug?
RANGER MCFRIENDLY
Hybrid cars make better for emission levels, but people who drive hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug. You can have smug in the atmosphere, and you know what that leads to? Glodal laming! Thanks to your gay little song, South Park is now the second smuggiest city in America!
[South Park breaking news. Awesome graphics]
ANNOUNCER
This is a South Park News Weather Bulletin!
ANCHOR TOM
It looks like we have a smug alert here in South Park. Our own Keenan Williams has the details. Keenan?
KEENAN
[at the weather desk] Thanks, Tom, a smug alert is in effect at least tomorrow morning. [a map of Denver and surrounding areas] All those hybrid cars on the road have caused heavy smug to develop over most of Park and Jefferson Counties. On the national map, we can see smug over Denver and developing smug in Los Angeles. However, San Francisco is once again the smuggiest city in the country.
[San Francisco, day. The scenes shown previously are repeated]
SINGER
A smuggy day in San Francisco town.
[The Broflovski house, housewarming party]
PAUL
Sheila, did you meet Gail and Brian?
SHEILA
No! Hello, how are you?
GAIL
Really good, really good. [she farts and quickly bends over to inhale it all]
GERALD
Hey there. Alan, right?
ALAN
Actually, it's Alain.
GERALD
Right right, w-would, would you like red or white wine?
ALAN
Can I just get an empty glass?
GERALD
Oh. Sure. [hands him an empty glass]
ALAN
Can you believe all these imbeciles in Texas? They just put another prisoner to death. [puts the glass to his ass and farts into it, then lifts the glass to his nose and inhales deeply]
[Kyle's room. Brian and Mindy are present with two other kids. All of them are on Ike's side of the room, two of them on Ike's bed, while Kyle and Ike are on Kyle's side, sitting on Kyle's bed.]
KYLE
[hesitant at first] So... what do you do for fun?
BRIAN
We drink and take drugs.
BOY 1
Do you want some acid?
KYLE
Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff.
BOY 2
You will. There's a reason most San Francisco kids take a lot of drugs.
BRIAN
It's the only thing that allows us to deal with our parents all walking around loving the smell of their own farts all the time.
GERALD
Everything okay in here, Kyle?
KYLE
Yeah, fine, Dad.
GERALD
So much better here with the intellectuals, isn't it, boys? [farts, then bends over and inhales his own fart] Wuhh [sniffs, rises and walks away] Mmmm.
KYLE
Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.
IKE
I want three.
[Stan's house, day. Butters and Cartman are playing a video game from Stan's sofa while Stan is on the phone]
STAN
No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!
CARTMAN
Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football!
BUTTERS
[giggles] Yeah. You're right. [Cartman stops for a few seconds, then drops his controller]
CARTMAN
You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.
BUTTERS
Well I'm sorry. Well it's just that I'm not Jewish, and now th-
CARTMAN
No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole!
RANGER MCFRIENDLY
[barging in] Marsh!
STAN
Oh crap, Ranger McFriendly.
CARTMAN
Who?
RANGER MCFRIENDLY
You'd better come with me to the news station! Our situation just got a lot worse!
[South Park News station, later. Stan looks over Keenan's shoulder as McFriendly, Cartman and Butters look on]
KEENAN
I noticed it on the computer this morning. Look here. [a satellite map is shown, with a closeup window over it. There's smug everywhere] This is the smug over South Park. It's... getting bigger and gaining strength.
CARTMAN
[clearly doesn't know what's happening] The smug?
KEENAN
The smug is getting so massive that it's moving west... and fusing with the San Francisco smug... Here. [points to the smug over the California-Nevada border, near Reno] These two smug clouds are combining, fueling each other. [moves his hand over the hurricane-like formation over the Nevada-Utah border] Now take a look at this. [moves his hand towards Southern California. A small cell is moving northward]
STAN
What is that?
KEENAN
It's the smug from George Clooney's acceptance speech at the Academy Awards.
STAN
George Clooney's acceptance speech?
KEENAN
Did you hear it? He talked about how people in Hollywood are ahead of the curve on social mattes. He even took credit for the Civil Rights movement -Look!! The point is... the smug from his acceptance speech has been slowly drifting north since he gave it... and is headed straight for the super cell. The South Park and San Francisco smug is already at critical mass. If it gets hit by George Clooney's acceptance speech, it will be a disaster of epic proportions. The perfect storm... of self-satisfaction.
RANGER MCFRIENDLY
We've got to tell the townspeople! South Park still has a chance to make it through the storm!
STAN
What about San Francisco?
KEENAN
[with gravity] Kid, thanks to your gay little song, there's not gonna be a San Francisco.
[South Park Square, day. A town meeting has again been called, this time for storm preparation. Ranger McFriendly is talking]
RANGER MCFRIENDLY
Soo, that's it people. [a different map showing the various smugs is shown, with an arrow going from Clooney's smug to the center of the super cell] When the smug from George Clooney's speech hits the San Francisco and South Park smug, we're gonna witness a storm the likes of which we've never seen.
RANDY
Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all?
RANGER MCFRIENDLY
If the smug clouds remain the way they are, yes. [the crowd grasps, then people begin talking about it]
JIMBO
This is all Stan's fault! He wrote that gay little song and got us to drive those damned hybrids!
RANDY
Yeah. Good going, stupid!
RANGER MCFRIENDLY
Listen! Though we all agree this is Stan's fault, there is still something we can do. If we all work together to reduce smugness, we might be able to lessen the effects of the storm, at least here in our own town.
STEPHEN
Then that's it. There's only one way to reduce smugness. We've gotta destroy every hybrid car in town! [the crowd responds vigorously to the plan]
JIMBO
Everyone get your hybrid and meet at Dawson's! [Stan turns left and walks away]
RANDY
Hey, where do you think YOU're going?!
STAN
[stops and turns to face the crowd] I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.
RANDY
Oh no you're not! Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you're gonna help us get rid of 'em!
RANGER MCFRIENDLY
How long do we have until the smug clouds collide?
KEENAN
Not long. The smug from George Clooney's Academy Awards Acceptance Speech has already crossed into Arizona.
[The Arizona desert, day. The smug is shown floating over a desert road. Dusty and Sons gas station is shown. The smug is quickly approaching the station.]
ATTENDANT
The hell is that? [The cloud goes over the station. As it goes over, clips of George Clooney's Academy Awards Acceptance Speech issue from within, ending with "Oscar winner, George Clooney, sexiest man alive"]
[San Francisco, day. Cartman and Butters are at the city limit, having planned to rescue Kyle. Cartman puts on a pressurized suit with a long umbilical cord]
BUTTERS
Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this.
CARTMAN
[puts on the gloves] I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.
BUTTERS
But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?
CARTMAN
You don't know San Francisco, Butters. [zips the suit up] It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old. [turns around and sighs] I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me. [reaches down, picks up the helmet, and puts it on, locks it in place, and pressurizes the suit. Communication resumes through the intercom] All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength.
BUTTERS
[adjusts his headset] I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric.
CARTMAN
I'm not doin' it for Kyle. [turns around] I can't believe I'm actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes. [begins to walk slowly and deliberately into the city]
[Dawson's Junkyard, day. Hybrid cars are awaiting destruction. The camera focuses on a green one, which is soon lifted away by a massive electromagnet. Inside a small room, Stan mans the controls. Mr. Mackey and Stan's parents look on as Ranger McFriendly guides Stan]
RANGER MCFRIENDLY
All right. All right, now get it into the masher! Hurry up!
STAN
Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.
RANGER MCFRIENDLY
Well then you shouldn't have written that gay little song, shouldn't you have?! [The green hybrid is now over the masher, and Stan releases it. Moments later, a cube of twisted green metal slides out and drops onto the ground] Keenan, we've gotten rid of half the hybrid cars! How are the smug levels?!
KEENAN
They're dropping, slowly, but... but we're running out of time!
[San Francisco. Cartman is now in the Haight-Ashbury district. People look and move on]
MAN
Yeah, it's like, San Francisco is more of a European city, like Paris or Milan.
CARTMAN
[checking in] Butters, are you there?!
BUTTERS
[making sure the cord is taut] I'm here, Eric.
CARTMAN
I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?
BUTTERS
[now reading a map] You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left?
CARTMAN
Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.
BUTTERS
Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west.
CARTMAN
Turning right at O two four niner. [turns right at the corner and continues walking]
[Dawson's Junkyard, day. Stan is still manning the controls. He drops a red hybrid into the masher, and a cube of twisted red metal slides out and drops onto the ground]
RANDY
That's it. That's that the last one.
RANGER MCFRIENDLY
Keenan? Keenan, we've smashed the last hybrid!
KEENAN
Harry, the smug from Clooney's speech is about to hit the other smug system! Get everyone inside! [the townsfolk hear the warning and run around all over the place. Keenan says softly, deeply] God help us.
[Over northeast Nevada, the speech's smug nears the supercell. From the ground, the smug is seen floating along quickly, reciting Clooney's speech. It runs into the super cell and stops talking. Immediately, lightning envelopes the super cell and spreads to San Francisco and South Park]
[San Francisco, under the Perfect Storm of Self-Satisfaction. Stuff begins to roll down the street on which Kyle lives. Cartman approaches his house]
CARTMAN
Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?!
BUTTERS
That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!
[The Broflovski house. Gerald and Sheila are thoroughly spent from the party, so they don't take notice of the storm outside. Cartman opens the door and the sound of thunder fills the house]
CARTMAN
Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!
GERALD
[Slowly, blissfully] Being smug is a good thing. [farts in his armchair, bends down to inhale it]
CARTMAN
Oh my CHRIST! [runs up to Kyle's room and kicks the door open. Kyle and Ike are as wasted as Gerald and Sheila are. They sit on the floor with their backs against Ike's bed] Kyle? Kyle!
KYLE
The acid. Dude, I'm totally tripping balls.
IKE
I'm totally tripping balls. I'm totally tripping balls.
CARTMAN
[trying to shake Kyle to his senses] We have to get out of here! Now! [lightning strikes the house, which begins to burn. The lights begin to flicker, and the camera zooms in on Cartman, who continues shaking Kyle] Kyle! Kyle!! [the screen goes black]
[Fade in to South Park, the morning after. People begin cleaning up. The storm dealt a heavy blow to South Park]
NETWORK ANCHOR
And now, the worst appears to be over. Last night's smug storm... has left thousands homeless. All across the Midwest, people are picking up the pieces. Cities like Denver and South Park are heavily damaged, but still all right. However, San Francisco, I'm afraid... has disappeared completely up its own asshole.
STAN
No...
RANDY
I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend.
CLYDE
Hey! Hey, Stan! You're not gonna believe it! You've gotta come see!
STAN
What?
CLYDE
It's a miracle!
[Downtown South Park, day. The Broflovskis are back in town, safe and sound and glad to see everyone. Everyone marvels at their return. The Marshes arrive. Stan spots Kyle and runs up to him]
STAN
Kyle!
KYLE
Hey Stan.
STAN
Dude, what happened?? [grins]
GERALD
We don't know. We were all passed out and... next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here.
MR. MACKEY
It's like you had a guardian angel, m'kay? [Butters looks to Cartman for any reaction. Cartman puts his left index finger to his mouth, indicating that Butters should keep his mouth shut about this]
STAN
[gives Kyle a brief hug] Dude, I'm so glad you're not dead.
RICHARD
So I guess there's nothing left to do now but... rebuild.
RANDY
Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars.
GERALD
And let's make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid, right? [everyone seems to agree and discusses it...]
KYLE
NO! Hybrid cars are a good thing!
MR. MACKEY
But hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug, m'kay?
KYLE
Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do. [silent reactions all around] Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it.
RANDY
You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it.
KYLE
Yeah!
RANDY
I'm... [puts his hands over his lower belly] I'm not ready...
GERALD
I don't think I can do it either.
MR. MACKEY
It's simply asking too much.
RANDY
Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us.
GERALD
Come on, everybody! Let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers! [everyone likes the idea; they all disperse]
CARTMAN
[walks up to Kyle] Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle?
KYLE
Yeah, I guess so.
CARTMAN
We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!
KYLE
Don't belittle my people, you fucking fatass! [turns and walks away angry]
CARTMAN
Ah, that's better. [smiles]
End of Smug Alert!


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:When the creators of the Family Guy announce that they will show the image of a religious symbol, the network threatens to ban the episode. Cartman sees this as his chance to get "Family Guy" off the air for good.

script:Cartoon Wars Part I

[Stan's bedroom, night. Sharon is seated on his bed and is reading to him from a book called "The Bubble Gum Prince In The Land Of Chocolate." Stan looks up at her, half-asleep and smiling]
SHARON
But the Bubble Gum Prince wasn't afraid. He knew that the Land of Chocolate was safe forever and ever. [Stan's eyelids shut themselves and his left arm falls a bit. He's asleep. Sharon rises from the bed and bends down.] Goodnight my little angel. [kisses him on the forehead, turns out the lamp and closes the door on her way out. Moments later, the door flies off its hinges and a frantic Randy runs in with two large plastic water bottles]
RANDY
STAAAN!!
STAN
[awakens and looks around as the lights come on] What?? What??
RANDY
Get up! Get your shoes on! Gotta get out of here! MOOVE! [brings the shoes over, but yanks Stan along before Stan has a chance to put them on. As they go down the hall, Randy stops to get a vase and toss the flowers out.] Take this!! [hands the vase to Stan] We've gotta bring all the water we can!! [Shelly opens her door and steps out] Shelly, go get my gun!!
SHELLY
What's going on dad?
RANDY
JUST GET THE GUN!! [runs down the hall and down the stairs. Sharon comes out of the master bedroom running while putting her coat on.]
[Stan's house, front, night. The family exits. Randy has a sleeping bag]
RANDY
Unh, come on! [the camera switches to a wider view and shows everyone running around with all manner of items in hand. A man carrying a large first-aid kit trips and moans in pain]
MAN
AWWWGH!
WOMAN
Oh nooo! [Stan sees Kyle in the crowd with his family]
STAN
Kyle! What the hell is going on this time?!
KYLE
I have no idea!
[a red car runs into a light pole and its driver flies out through the windshield, ending up either unconscious or dead. A man breaks the display window at Tele's and runs off with a small TV. The community center has its doors open and people run inside it]
MAN
Take cover in the community center again!
[The community center, inside. People try to find places on which to bed down for the night. A nake redhead runs around aimlessly]
JIMBO
All right, everyone get in and get a seal on that door!
LINDA
Oh my God, Stephen, we've left Butters. [moves to find him. Stephen stops her]
STEPHEN
We can't go back out, Linda! It's too late for him!
STAN
Dad? [Randy is cutting duct tape into several equal-length strips] Dad, what the hell is going on?! [Randy stands up and faces the boys. Behind him, Mr. Mackey and a man in a raincoat set up a TV]
RANDY
A cartoon...! A cartoon is about to air on American television with... with the Muslim prophet Mohammad as a character! [Stan and Kyle look at each other and blink]
STAN
So?
RANDY
SO?! Stanley, Mohammad is sacred to the Muslim people. [people around them begin to pay attention] Ever since those cartoons in Denmark, the rules have changed. Nobody shows an image of Mohammad anymore.
GERALD
[approaching in his pajamas] Which cartoon is it? What cartoon'll be so insensitive as to have Mohammad as a character?
RANDY
Who do you think?! The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor! Family Guy!
CROWD
AWWW!
JIMBO
How could Family Guy do that?
SHEILA
Why would Family Guy so blatantly insult Muslims?
RANDY
Because Family Guy doesn't care who they insult! They only care about their... precious money!
STAN
Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon??
MR. MACKEY
Wu-we've got the TV working! [the picture comes into focus]
[South Park News 4, Anchor Tom reporting]
TOM
Once again, a cartoon depicting the Muslim prophet Mohammad is set to air tonight on Family Guy!
SHARON
Oh Randy, hold me. [Randy holds her]
TOM
The news has already sparked a shockwave of protests throughout the Muslim world. [Live footage is shown - a crowd holds an American flag aloft and someone sets it on fire] All over the Middle East, Muslims are burning American flags and Family Guy posters. Muslim terrorist al-Zawahri made this statement:
AL-ZAWAHRI
[translated] We are so super pissed off at 'Family Guy'. 'Family Guy' isn't even that funny of a show. A jihad on 'Family Guy', and the 'Family Guy' nation!
LINDA
So what happens now?
RANDY
We stay here through the night, wait it out to see if they do anything. If we're still alive in the morning, [dramatic closeup] then we'll know we're not dead.
[South Park, morning. The sky is red as the sun rises. At the South Park Community Center, Mrs. Garrison opens the doors and looks out.]
MRS. GARRISON
It's okay! [everyone heads out]
RANDY
We're alive?? We're alive! [pumps his fists]
JIMBO
[listening in on a boombox] Everyone. Everyone, listen. FOX Network censored the image of Mohammad at the last minute.
CROWD
Oh thank God.
RANDY
Well, it looks like we've dodged a bullet.
STAN
They censored the image of Mohammad? How?
KYLE
I TiVo every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did.
[Kyle's house, later. Kyle leads the boys to the front door running and opens the door. They all go in]
[Kyle's living room. Kyle gets the TiVo remote and gets to work.]
KYLE
Okay you guys, check it out. [begins scanning the recorded programming]
CARTMAN
You TiVo every episode of Family Guy?
KYLE
Dude, it's a good show.
STAN
Yeah, lots of people like Family Guy.
CARTMAN
Yich. [Kyle has reached his target. The Family Guy living room is shown. Peter is in his armchair, the rest of the family is on the sofa]
LOIS
Peter, I can't believe you invited your old high-school sweetheart over for dinner.
PETER
You think that's bad? Remember when I auditioned to be David Hasselhoff's car? [flashback #1]
PETER
Hey there, Knight Rider. [Michael Knight climbs onto Peter's shoulders and they're off]
MICHAEL
After those bad guys, KITT! [Peter smiles and his teeth glow like KITT's headlights used to]
CHRIS
Yeah, but Dad, why would you invite an ex-girlfriend to dinner?
STEWIE
Perhaps he wants to make our mother nervous.
PETER
Nervous? Like when I had to sell pancakes to the school soccer captain? [flashback #2]
PETER
[rings a doorbell. The captain answers, dressed as Capt. Kirk] Pancakes for you, Captain?
SOCCER CAPTAIN
I'll be the Captain, and you'll be Tenille. [rushes away and returns with a wig and pale blue dress for Peter to don. Moments later the captain is at a keyboard on the front lawn playing a Captain and Tenille tune as Peter sings]
PETER
Love will keep us together
KYLE
Hehaha, heh.
CARTMAN
Yich.
LOIS
But Peter, I don't wanna cook dinner for your ex-girlfriend.
PETER
Well, maybe we can just have tea.
BRIAN
You mean like the time you had tea with Mohammad, the prophet of the Muslim faith? [flashback #3]
PETER
Come on, Mohammad, let's get some tea. [Mohammad is covered by a black box with the words "IMAGE CENSORED BY FOX" printed several times from top to bottom inside the box. They stop at a tea stand.]
MR. T
Try my "Mr. T. ...tea." [squints]
PETER
Oh boy, was that ever weird. Anyway, I can't believe I invited my old sweetheart to dinner. Huh.
KYLE
That's it? That's all they did?
CARTMAN
Oh man, that's not cool! Seriously, that is not cool.
STAN
What? What's the big deal?
CARTMAN
What's the big deal? You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people. [Stan and Kyle look at each other in silence] What, you guys think that's okay?! Do you care at all about people's feelings?!
KYLE
Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?!
STAN
Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!
CARTMAN
That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?!
KYLE
Uhhh...
CARTMAN
I'm telling you guys, it's wrong! It's WRONG!! [turns and heads for the front door, then turns back and aims his index fingers at the other boys] It's wrong! [opens the door, heads out, and closes it behind him. Kyle's parents walk in from the kitchen with their survival gear]
SHEILA
Kyle? Kyle, what are you watching?!
PETER
Hey Brian, this is like the time I got a job as a carrot cake.
SHEILA
Gaaah! It's Family Guy! Quick, Gerald, do something! [Gerald arrives with a bat and begins bashing the television set to bits]
KYLE
Dad, Dad, Jesus Christ!
GERALD
[stops once the picture is gone] It's okay... it's dead.
SHEILA
You boys know you're not supposed to watch that careless show!
KYLE
Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea.
SHEILA
You boys don't understand anything! It's obvious that you ALL need Muslim-sensitivity training!
[Mrs. Garrison's class, day. Class is in session, and Mrs. Garrison is at the board]
MRS. GARRISON
Welcome to Muslim-Sensitivity Training. It is important for us to understand why the Muslim feel the way they do, and why we can never show an image of Mohammad.
KYLE
No, Muslims can't show an image of Mohammad.
MRS. GARRISON
Kyle, you're not being very sensitive.
CARTMAN
Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't.
MRS. GARRISON
Let's all look at why Muslims are upset: [turns and picks up a stick of chalk] First of all, in the Muslim religion, you're not allowed to have what? [no response] Sex. Good. [writes "NO SEX" on the board] There's no sex until marriage in the Muslim world. [faces the class] Now, this would be fine except that in the Muslim religion you also can't... Anybody? [no response] Jack off. [writes "NO JACKING OFF" on the board] Okay, jacking it is strictly forbidden in the Muslim religion. [faces the class] And what do we know about the places Muslims live? They live in? [no response] Good, sand. [writes "SAND" on the board] Now put yourself in the shoes of a Muslim. It's Friday night, but you can't have sex, and you can't jack off. There's sand in your eyes and probably in the crack of your ass, and then some cartoon comes along from a country where people are getting laid, and mocks your prophet. Well you know what? I'd be pretty pissed off too!
CARTMAN
Mrs. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of Family Guy, not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy?
WENDY
[skeptically] ...yeah.
MR. MACKEY
[over the school PA system] Attention students: Proceed to the school gymnasium immediately for an emergency announcement!
STAN
The hell's going on now?!
[The school gym, moments later. The teachers gather behind Mr. Mackey and Principal Victoria as Mr. Mackey gets the TV working. The kids enter and are seated on the floor]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Shh! Quiet, students, quiet!
[SNN special report. A graphic about "FOX: CENSORED" is over the reporter's left shoulder]
SNN ANCHOR
Once again, we have just learned that the Family Guy episode featuring Mohammad was only Part 1 of a two-parter! And Part 2 is going to air next week, with Mohammad uncensored!
CARTMAN
What?
MRS. GARRISON
Why would they-?
SNN ANCHOR
FOX Studios claims that the Family Guy writing staff has demanded the Mohammad character be seen in full view. [a shot of some townsmen watching the news at the bar] The head of FOX had this to say:
FOX PRESIDENT
Family Guy is our biggest show. If they insist we don't censor their work, then we we can't.
RANDY
[angrily leaves his bar stool] FAMILY GUY!!! [throws his Corona bottle down; it shatters] I DAMN YOU TO HELL!!!
SNN ANCHOR
Once again, bitter riots have started in the Middle East; this time, even more massive. And terrorist leader al-Zawahri has issued a threat.
AL-ZAWAHRI
[translated] Seriously, 'Family Guy' isn't even that well written. The jokes are all interchangeable and usually irrelevant to the plot. When this episode airs-our retaliation will be MASSIVE!!!!
MR. MACKEY
Retaliation... Oh my God. M'kay?
[South Park Elementary, afternoon. The kids pour out the front doors]
CARTMAN
Goddamned Family Guy! Now they're just provoking people! It's like they want a holy war!
STAN
Does this mean we don't have school all week?
CARTMAN
You guys, this is serious! We have to do something!
KENNY
(Like what?)
CARTMAN
We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me?
STAN
Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses.
CARTMAN
Then we'll ride our Big Wheels.
STAN
To Los Angeles?
CARTMAN
If that's what it takes, yes! We have to talk to the network! The Family Guy writers aren't gonna back down!
KYLE
Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated!
CARTMAN
Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle?
KYLE
All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real!
CARTMAN
All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get hurt. If ten people die because Family Guy just had to have their little joke, will you still think it's funny? [Kyle stifles an answer] What if a hundred people died? Will it be funny then, Kyle? [Kyle's jaw drops] I'm going to Los Angeles. I'm gonna do whatever I can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Somebody has to speak for the Muslim people. Somebody has to speak for what's right. [walks off]
[Kyle's room, night. Kyle's asleep when his father bursts into the room]
GERALD
Kyle! Kyle, wake up! [Sheila and Ike follow him in] We have to go! The terrorists are attacking!
[Outside. Terrorists run around with rifles scaring everyone else, but the military gives chase]
KYLE
Dad? Are you sure this time?
GERALD
This isn't a joke, Kyle! Bombs have already gone off in six cities!
KYLE
No!
SHEILA
Wait a minute! [looks around and drops her stuff] Where's Ike?!
GERALD
[looks around and drops his stuff] He was just here! Ike!
SHEILA
Ike! [Kyle goes back through the crowd to look for him]
KYLE
Ike? Iiike! [sees him] Ike! [Ike is heading for the ice cream shop]
IKE
Ice cream. And chocolate.
KYLE
Ike! [points left] This way! [a flash of light fills the night, and Kyle shields his eyes from it. A bomb has gone off behind the ice cream shop and the shockwaves spread out, obliterating the row of stores before Ike.] Iiike! [races towards him. Ike is engulfed by the flames, flesh turning to bone]
IKE
[hauntingly] Kyyyle! [Kyle's flesh is consumed by the flames] Nooooo!
KYLE
[sits upright in his bed and is quite awake now. He catches his breath, then leaves his bed to check on Ike. He opens Ike's door and looks in. Ike is sound asleep under his mobile. Kyle lets out a soft sigh of relief]
[Cartman's house, next day. He equips his Big Wheels with whatever he can take to keep him going for the trip to Los Angeles. Cheesy Poofs. Socks. Doughnuts... Kyle stops by on his own Big Wheels]
CARTMAN
Come to try and stop me?! [...a bigger box of Cheesy Poofs...] It isn't gonna work. [...a can of Dr. Pep-er, a can of lemon-lime soda...]
KYLE
I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled.
CARTMAN
[...Snacky Cakes...] Yeah well, I don't need a partner on this. [...another can of Dr. Pep-er...] Especially one who doesn't trust me. [seals his knapsack shut]
KYLE
Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before.
CARTMAN
[turns around slowly] Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time.
KYLE
It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together.
CARTMAN
You know we might not even make it into the studio.
KYLE
I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that.
CARTMAN
So what made you change your mind?
KYLE
I got some sound advice... from an old friend. [they smile at each other. Cartman turns and hops onto his Big Wheels]
CARTMAN
Well Kyle, we'd better get going.
KYLE
Yeah! [dramatic shots of Cartman getting on his Big Wheels, then of Kyle doing the same]
CARTMAN
Are you set?
KYLE
I'm set! Let's do this!
CARTMAN
All right, let's roll! [they ride off, slowly]
[Town meeting in one of the rooms in City Hall. Everyone is talking all at once]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
People! People, quiet, please! [the crowd quiets down] We must not panic!
RANDY
Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! Part 2 of the Family Guy episode airs in six days!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
I believe that Professor Thomas from the University has come up with a solution.
PROF. THOMAS
[steps up to the podium] Thank you, Mayor. [everyone sits] Now look, everyone, Muslim terrorists and extremists are threatening us for what Family Guy is going to do... because they've wrongly grouped us together. Our only hope is to make the Muslim extremists know... that we had no part in the Mohammad episode. That even though the episode aired, we didn't watch it, we didn't hear it, and we didn't talk about it.
JIMBO
So how do we do that?
PROF. THOMAS
We bury our heads. In sand. [flips a board over to reveal his plan for disavowing any knowledge of the episode] We take twenty to twenty-five dump trucks, fill them with sand from Monarch Lake, and then dump the sand along South Park Avenue. By using approximately eighteen dozen shovels, we can each dig a hole in the sand, stick our heads in the holes, and then have the person to our left bury them. If we can manage to get every person's head buried deep, deep in sand before the Mohammad episode airs, we could avoid looking like we're responsible for any part of this at all.
STEPHEN
No, no, wait a minute, [Mrs. Garrison looks at him] that's ridiculous. [Gerald looks at him] What we need to do is just the opposite. Freedom of speech is at stake here, don't you all see? [makes his way to the board] If anything, we should ALL make cartoons of Mohammad, and show the terrorists and the extremists that we are all united in the belief that every person has a right to say what they want! Look, people, it's... been real easy for us to stand up for free speech lately. For the past few decades we haven't had to risk anything to defend it. But those times are going to come! And one of those times is right now. And if WE... aren't willing to RISK... what we have, then we just believe in free speech, but we don't defend it. [the other people there mull this speech over...]
RANDY
I like the sand idea.
MR. MACKEY
Yeah, me too.
GERALD
Yeah. The sand thing sounds a lot simpler. [everyone else agrees]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
We're gonna need eight dozen shovels and sixteen tons of sand! Let's move, people!
[Out in the desert during the day, Cartman and Kyle ride along. Cars pass them by]
KYLE
We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.
CARTMAN
Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air forever.
KYLE
[puzzled] Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled.
CARTMAN
It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
KYLE
[races ahead] Whoa whoa wait a minute! [pulls a hand brake so as to block Cartman, then gets off his Big Wheels] This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever?
CARTMAN
Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.
KYLE
But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy.
CARTMAN
[gets off his Big Wheels, his anger sudden and strong, and walks up to Kyle] Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand! [turns and goes back to his Big Wheels]
KYLE
[realizes Cartman's true intent] You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want Family Guy off the air.
CARTMAN
Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, "Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right?" "Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman." [turns and faces Kyle] I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!!
KYLE
What are you talking about?!
CARTMAN
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
KYLE
I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.
CARTMAN
Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled! [begins to walk towards his Big Wheels]
KYLE
No! [moves to stop Cartman in his tracks] I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air!
CARTMAN
Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw?
KYLE
[turns around to see] What? [Cartman shoves him to the ground from behind and quickly gets on his Big Wheels, and peels away. Kyle gets up] CARTMAN! [gets on his Big Wheels and gives chase.]
[The highway. Kyle catches up to Cartman and then tries to run him off the road. Cartman recovers and Kyle tries again. Cartman pulls ahead and Kyle works on one of Cartman's back tires with his big front one. That gets Cartman to fishtail back and forth]
CARTMAN
Kyle, stop it!
[Cartman pulls ahead. Kyle can't catch up. A car goes by, and then Cartman gets an ingenious idea. He crosses the sandy median and continues down the highway the wrong way. Kyle decides to catch up with Cartman, so he crosses the median as well and pops up behind Cartman. Cartman looks over his shoulder at Kyle, then looks ahead, then looks in disbelief as a tanker truck barrels towards them]
CARTMAN
Holy Crap! [swerves to the right]
KYLE
Ahhh!
[Kyle swerves to his left. The truck rolls by between them. The two of them line up again and continue riding. They pass a patrol car, which turns on its sirens and follows them. Both bikes and the cruiser fishtail down the highway]
TROOPER
Stay on 'em! [the fishtailing continues, but the patrol car loses control] Jesus, Mary! [the car falls back into the median, flips over backwards, and falls apart. Cartman and Kyle continue on as fast as possible towards the setting sun]
[South Park, next day. The sand has been brought in and is now being spread out, Mr and Mrs Tucker walk by with their son Craig; Mr Tucker holds a shovel]
PROF. THOMAS
If you have children, be sure to bury their heads in the sand before you bury your own. [the camera pans across as a row of residents already has their heads buried, with snorkels in place for undisturbed breathing. The camera stops at Stan.]
STAN
Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand.
RANDY
It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up?
STAN
Yeah.
RANDY
All right, make sure your snorkel is working. [Stan slips it on] All right, now get your head in the hole.
STAN
Dad, this is stupid.
RANDY
Stanley, there's no time for your immaturity! Do it! [Stan dips his head into the hole and Randy quickly buries it] All right Sharon, now do me. [gives the thumbs-up sign, puts on the snorkel, and dips his head in the hole. Sharon buries his head]
JIMBO
[approaches Prof. Thomas with Mrs. Garrison] Uh Professor, we all just thought of somethin'. If everyone has their head buried by the person standing to their left, then who's gonna bury the last person's head?
PROF. THOMAS
Yes. I'm afraid one person is going to have to be last, and... not have his head in the sand.
FARMER
[steps forward through the crowd] I'll do it.
WIFE
[appears and tries to stop him] Dylan, no!
PROF. THOMAS
You realize by not burying your head in sand, you'll appear to be a part of the Family Guy audience.
DYLAN
Yes, I know.
WIFE
Dylan, please, you can't!
DYLAN
Somebody has to do it, Sarah. [strokes her hair and face] You run along now and you get your head in the sand. I'll be all right. [she looks at him, then cries uncontrollably into his shoulder. He looks at the professor] You have to understand... I'm all she has. [the other townsfolk look on for a few seconds]
MRS. GARRISON
[to Jimbo] Who are those people?
[The Highway. Cartman and Kyle continue racing towards Los Angeles. Kyle is closing in. Cartman looks back and opens his knapsack, unleashing everything he packed in there. Kyle gamely swerves to avoid it all. Cartman opens the big box of Cheesy Poofs and pours out the contents]
KYLE
[begins losing control] No! [his Big Wheels go left and he can't brake] AAAAH! [he jumps off as he nears the edge of a cliff] AAAAH! [the Big Wheels goes over the edge and starts bouncing down the side of the cliff. At the first bounce, a rear wheel comes off. At the second bounce, Kyle's knapsack flies off. The rest bounces a few more times until it reaches the ground below, upside down. The Big Wheels explode. Kyle rises and looks down at the wreckage. He nurses an injured right shoulder]
CARTMAN
Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!
KYLE
You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?!
CARTMAN
[riding into the distance] Suck mah balls, Kyle! [Kyle sobs a little, then pounds his left fist into the sand along the side of the highway]
[FOX STUDIOS, a heliport. A government helicopter emblazoned with the Presidential seal descends onto the heliport. FOX executives come out to greet the visitors. President Bush and Condoleeza Rice exit the helicopter with two Secret Service agents flanking them]
PRESIDENT BUSH
Are you the network president?
FOX PRESIDENT
Yes, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT BUSH
We need to discuss this Family Guy episode, Mr. President.
FOX PRESIDENT
Mr. President, my hands are tied. The Family Guy writers insist I don't censor Mohammad.
PRESIDENT BUSH
But Mr. President, this is a matter of national security. They must be reasoned with.
FOX PRESIDENT
Mr. President, there's something about the Family Guy writing staff I think you should know. [a close-up of Bush looking perplexed.]
[End sequence. Cartman sneaks out from behind the Family Guy Studios sign with a gun and runs up to the front doors. He enters the writing room...]
ANNOUNCER
Next week on South Park: The race continues. Cartman reaches the Family Guy Studio and learns the shocking secret behind the Family Guy writing staff.
CARTMAN
[...and reaches a slow, undulating glowing light, judging from the reflection coming off him] This... explains everything.
ANNOUNCER

Previously on South Park...
SNN ANCHOR
The popular cartoon, Family Guy, is going to show the image of Mohammad uncensored!
[a shot of the town hall, where the town has gathered to listen to emergency plans on dealing with Family Guy]
PROF. THOMAS
If we all bury our heads in sand, [a shot of the townsfolk with their heads in the sand] we can avoid being any part of this.
[a shot of the four boys in front of the school, before Cartman heads off to L.A.]
CARTMAN
I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand.
[a shot of Kyle in the desert when he learns of Cartman's true intentions]
KYLE
You just want Family Guy off the air...
[Kyle messes with Cartman's Big Wheels to slow him down. Cartman fishtails.]
CARTMAN
Kyle, stop it!
[A shot of both of them after Kyle loses his Big Wheels]
CARTMAN
So long, Kyle!
KYLE
You son of a bitch! I won't let you win!
[A shot of President Bush and of the FOX President]
FOX PRESIDENT
Mr. President, there's something about the Family Guy writing staff I think you should know. [a close-up of Bush looking perplexed.]
ANNOUNCER
And now, the thrilling conclusion of... Cartoon Wars... will not be seen tonight! ["Special Presentation"] so that we can bring you this Terrance & Phillip Television Special [tooot! Terrance & Phillip... in... Mystery at the Lazy "J" Ranch. Terrance and Phillip are shown catching a blackhat in action]
[Lazy "J" Ranch, day. Terrance and Phillip ride their horses]
PHILLIP
Say Terrance, isn't it wonderful having a holiday here at the Lazy "J" Ranch?
TERRANCE
It sure is, Phillip. But I do believe this steer I'm riding has the farts. [the horse farts and its tail goes up like a flag. They both laugh.]
PHILLIP
Oh, look who's coming! Isn't that Mohammad, the holy prophet of the Muslim religion? [Mohammad, covered with a "CENSORED BY CBC" box, rides up to them]
MOHAMMAD
Hey guys, how's it going?
TERRANCE
Hello Mohammad, we've read all aboat you in the Koran.
MOHAMMAD
I'm here to investigate a murder.
[Canadian Broadcasting Company, day. Terrance and Phillip stands to the opposite of the Network President in his office.]
TERRANCE
ALL RIGHT, JUST WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE??!!
PHILLIP
You censored out the image of Mohammad in our television special!!
NETWORK PRESIDENT
Ey! You guys know the rules! Nobody can show the image of Mohammad anymore. It's dangerous.
TERRANCE
But you ruined the whole show!
NETWORK PRESIDENT
Look, I'm not gonna risk the lives of the people at this network. Let's just forget aboat it, okay guys? [farts and laughs. Terrance and Phillip look hard at him, their arms crossed] Aw, come on guys, give me a break.
PHILLIP
We demand you rerun Mystery at the Lazy "J" Ranch with Mohammad uncensored!
NETWORK PRESIDENT
Ey! I run this network, not you guys! And if you ask me, your show has become so preachy and full of messages that you've forgotten how to be funny! NO Mohammad!
TERRANCE
But Family Guy is going to show Mohammad on an episode that airs tonight!
NETWORK PRESIDENT
I doubt it! I'll bet that right now, somebody is on their way to FOX Network to demand that that episode be pulled.
[FOX Studios, day. An entrance to the Studios is shown, with guards at heightened secuity. Cartman rides right into the studios with no one noticing him. Cartman enters the main building and approaches a receptionist]
CARTMAN
Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away.
RECEPTIONIST
What is it regarding?
CARTMAN
It's regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG!
RECEPTIONIST
O...kay, but if you've got a problem with Family Guy, you'll have to wait in line. [points to her right. Cartman looks over and then back at the receptionist] That little boy over there has an appointment to try and get Family Guy off the air altogether. [Cartman walks over and sees Bart Simpson seated in a chair, his skateboard leaning on it]
CARTMAN
Dude, can I go before you?
BART
Eat my shorts!
[The highway, dawn. Kyle, still nursing his shoulder, arrives at a truck stop and his eyes open wide]
KYLE
What the hell is going on? [everyone there has his or her head buried in sand. Kyle walks among them] Hello? [stops next to someone in a red sweater] Excuse me, I need to get to Los Angeles. [tugs at the pants. The person waves. Kyle looks around and goes into the diner] Hello?! [a TV in the store is tuned to SNN]
SNN ANCHOR
...starting in a small town in central Colorado. The idea has now spread all over America. [a helicopter shot of buried heads everywhere] Muslims continue to riot in the Middle East, demanding that Family Guy not air tonight's episode. [more live footage is shown. Kyle gets close to the TV] Amd Muslim terrorists continue to make threats.
AL-ZAWAHRI
[translated text reads] "Family Guy" better not show Mohammad tonight. I'm serious. "Family Guy" isn't funny.
SNN ANCHOR
Osama bin Laden had this to say:
OSAMA BIN LADEN
[translated text reads] If you look closely at the writing in "Family Guy", you will see that the jokes never derive from the plot, and I think that's totally gay.
SNN ANCHOR
Bin Laden went on to say that if Family Guy shows the image of Mohammad as planned, the terrorist retaliation will be immediate. [a rifle appears next to him and a hand cocks it]
TRUCKER
[with rifle trained on Kyle] You one of them?
KYLE
Who?
TRUCKER
How come your head ain't in the sand? [Kyle is confused]
[FOX Studios. Cartman is seated two chairs away from Bart. Muzak is playing in the background]
CARTMAN
So... you don't like Family Guy either, huh?
BART
I hate Family Guy.
CARTMAN
So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air?
BART
Not nicely.
CARTMAN
Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air.
BART
Cool, man.
CARTMAN
Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want.
BART
Isn't that like, terrorism?
CARTMAN
...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism.
BART
I could do that.
CARTMAN
This is manipulation at its highest level; you should let me handle this.
BART
I'm a pretty bad kid.
CARTMAN
Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done?
BART
I stole the head off a statue once.
CARTMAN
Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him.
BART
[compares the two acts in his mind...] You got it, man. You got it. [hops onto his skateboard and skates off]
CARTMAN
Seeya.
[The White House, day. President Bush is addressing the White House press corps in the press room]
PRESIDENT BUSH
I want to assure the American people that as President, I have exhausted every possible solution. Unfortunately, Mohammad will appear uncensored on Family Guy tonight at seven.
REPORTERS
[clamoring] Mr. President!
REPORTER 1
[rises] Mr. President, can't the writers of the show be reasoned with? Don't they know they're putting the country in danger? [sits]
PRESIDENT BUSH
I have come to... understand something about the Family Guy writing staff. Suffice it to say that they will not be persuaded by the possibility of violence.
REPORTERS
[clamoring] Mr. President!
REPORTER 1
[same one as before] What exactly did you learn about the Family Guy writing staff, Mr. President?
PRESIDENT BUSH
[thinks a moment, then leans into the mic and says in a low voice] I'm afraid that information is classified.
REPORTERS
[in unison] AWWW!!! [then clamoring] Mr. President!
TCO REPORTER
[rises] Mr. President, can't you force the Family Guy writing staff not to write anything about Mohammad? [sits]
LSX REPORTER
[rises] Couldn't you throw them in prison? [sits]
PRESIDENT BUSH
Look! The fact of the matter is the Family Guy writing staff is protected by something called the First Amendment!
REPORTER 2
And what exactly is this First Amendment, Mr. President?
PRESIDENT BUSH
[beat] Uh you know, the right to free speech.
REPORTERS
[in unison] AWWW!!! [they begin to fight furiously and clamor amongst themselves]
REPORTER 3
[rises] Mr. President, when your administration came up with this "First Amendment," did it not foresee a problem like this might happen? [sits]
PRESIDENT BUSH
[beat] Well... We didn't come up with the First Amendment. It was already in place.
TCO REPORTER
[rises] What do you intend to do about this "First Amendment," Mr. President? [sits]
REPORTER 4
[rises] Forgive me, Mr. President, but this "First Amendment" sounds like a lot of bureaucratic jibbery-joob? [sits]
REPORTERS
Yeah!
REPORTER 5
That's right!
[FOX Studios, day, the President's office. The FOX President is discussing schedules with the department staff]
FOX PRESIDENT
Okay, let's discuss the fall lineup.
RECEPTIONIST 2
[enters] Sir, there's still one little boy out here who wants to speak with you about pulling the Family Guy episode
FOX PRESIDENT
All right, let's get this over with. [Cartman enters the room leaning on a crutch]
CARTMAN
[removes his cap] Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow...
STAFF
Oh, poor kid.
CARTMAN
You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened. [shocked looks on the faces of the staff] First one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. They just kept coming. Suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another! They were like Mexican jumping beans. I just don't wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your responsibility. [coughs] Ow..
FOX PRESIDENT
I feel terrible. It's so easy to put terrorism out of mind until one of its victims is staring you in the face.
STAFFER
Sir, if we pull the episode, the Family Guy writing staff will refuse to work again.
FOX PRESIDENT
Little boy, will you talk to the Family Guy writing staff? If your story touches their hearts like it has ours, perhaps they'll back down from demanding we air the episode.
CARTMAN
I'll certainly do my best. [coughs] Ow.
FOX PRESIDENT
Take this noble child over to the Family Guy offices. If he can scare them like he has us, maybe we can pull the Mohammad episode after all.
CARTMAN
[turns and walks out, and says softly with an evil smile] Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead.
FOX PRESIDENT
What was that?
CARTMAN
[stops and turns] I I said "thank you." Thank you for listening. [walks out again]
[FOX Studios, outside. A truck pulls up to the curb and the passenger door opens. Kyle steps out of the truck and closes the door]
KYLE
Thanks a lot for the ride.
TRUCKER
Ey, it's the least I could do. I hope you succeed, kid. I really don't wanna see Family Guy go off the air. I love that show!
KYLE
I'll do everything I can.
TRUCKER
I mean, I know it's just joke after joke, but I like that. At least it doesn't get all preachy and up its own ass with messages, you know? [drives off]
[FOX Studios, exterior studio wall. Bart is writing "I HATE FAMILY GUY" repeatedly on the wall, much as he'd do in the opening credits of The Simpsons. His skateboard is leaning on the wall]
KYLE
[noticing Bart writing, but doesn't see the actual text] Excuse me. [Bart stops writing and approaches Kyle] Do you know which way the network president's office is?
BART
Who wants to know?!
KYLE
Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting Family Guy off the air.
BART
[eyes narrowing] The network president's office is in there! [points to his right, to a small red building labeled "154 c"]
KYLE
Oh thanks, dude.
BART
No problem, man. [smiles, knowing Kyle isn't going to the right building]
[A storage room. This is the building Bart pointed to. Kyle opens the door and enters]
KYLE
[looks around] Hello? This can't be right, I- [Bart whacks him from behind with a skateboard, and he falls forward] Ow!
BART
Cowabunga, motherfucker!
[The Family Guy offices. The receptionist shows Cartman in]
RECEPTIONIST 2
[behind a desk] Hello Mitchell.
MITCHELL
Oh hi, Miss Travis.
MISS TRAVIS
The president has asked that little Danny Pocket here speak with the Family Guy writing staff.
MITCHELL
[rises and walks forth] Are you... sure? They're working on a new episode right now.
CARTMAN
It won't take long, sir. [coughs with more energy] Ow...
MITCHELL
All right, I'll take him back. Follow me, little Danny. [walks back to the writing area. Cartman follows.] You must be excited. Not many people get to meet our writing staff.
CARTMAN
[removes his cap] Yes, I'm totally excited. Family Guy is so funny.
[The Family Guy writing room. Mitchell and Cartman enter and walk by the cubicles]
MITCHELL
Well, here we are. Danny, the Family Guy writing staff.
CARTMAN
[stops and stares] Wha? [before him is a wall tank the height of the writing room. Manatees are swimming slowly within, and a huge pile of plastic balls sits at one end of the tank. Some of them are snacking on small fish] What are they?
MITCHELL
They're manatees. [gray manatees] Gretchen and Flubber are from the Gulf of Mexico. Tinker, Pete and Lucy are from the Caribbean Sea.
CARTMAN
Family Guy is written by manatees? [rethinks] Of course, it all makes sense now.
MITCHELL
They really are brilliant creatures. [the camera focuses on the ball pile] You see, the right side of the tank is filled with idea balls. [the camera zooms in and pans across] Each ball has a verb, noun, or pop culture reference written on it. There's millions of them. [A manatee swims to the left side of the tank balancing a ball on its nose] The manatees choose an idea ball and swim it over to the joke combine on the other side of the tank. [another manatee swims into the pile] Uh there goes Gretchen! She's comin' up with an idea. Oh, she came up with Gary Coleman. [another manatee reaches the combine and drops a ball in] The idea balls drop into the joke combine and form part of the new script. [the ball reads "Mexico" as it goes down the pipe into the sorter] Laundry Date Winning Mexico Gary Coleman. A perfect Family Guy joke! I can see it now!
[The imagined joke]
LOIS
Peter, you didn't do the laundry today.
PETER
You think that's bad? Remember the time I won a date to Mexico with Gary Coleman?
[Pedro's, somewhere in Mexi]
WAITER
¿Qué pasa, señores?
GARY COLEMAN
Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Willis?
[Back to the Family Guy offices]
CARTMAN
Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk!
MITCHELL
When FOX censored the image of Mohammad last week, it also meant that the Mohammad ball had to come out of the idea tank. It made the manatees very upset. Pull just one idea ball out of the idea tank, and the manatees stop working. He-here, I'll show you. [looks up] Keith? [Keith, seated at the top of the tank, reaches in and pulls out a green RIVERDANCE ball. The manatees stop in their tracks and slowly drop down as the balls they're carrying slip away from them] All right all right, put it back in! [Keith drops it back in. The manatees respond quickly and resume work] Manatees are very ethical writers. Either everything's okay to write about, or nothing is. Anyway, the president of the network wanted you to ...speak with the manatees.
CARTMAN
Oh... yes, yes. Um [clears his throat and talks to the tank] hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you-
MITCHELL
That isn't gonna work on them.
CARTMAN
Why not?
MITCHELL
Don't you know anything about manatees? They're the only mammals that are completely unmoved by terrorist threats.
CARTMAN
[softly] Son of a bitch.
[The storage room. Kyle is now dangling from the ceiling, enveloped in a rope trap. He struggles to get out]
KYLE
[calling to Bart] Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this?
CARTMAN
[voice] Well well well! [now shown walking up to Bart, who's keeping watch while leaning on his skateboard. Cartman has a mean air of satisfaction on him]
KYLE
Cartman!
CARTMAN
Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.
KYLE
You fat son of a bitch!
CARTMAN
You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate Family Guy.
BART
Yeah.
KYLE
Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too! Who are you to decide it shouldn't be on the air?!
BART
Shut up! [points to Kyle] You shut your fucking face, man! [to Cartman] Did it work? Did you scare the network into pulling the episode?
CARTMAN
Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the Family Guy writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in.
BART
Cool man!
KYLE
Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!!
CARTMAN
Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like Family Guy. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle, [turns and walks away] I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank.
KYLE
WHAT?!
[Family Guy offices, later. The FOX President looks at the manatee tank along with the rest of the staff]
FOX PRESIDENT
I don't understand it. What's wrong with them? [the manatees are floating aimlessly]
MITCHELL
We don't know, Mr. President. They just stopped working.
FOX PRESIDENT
[concerned] But, nobody took any idea balls out of the tank, did they?
MITCHELL
No sir, none of us did. [Cartman smiles and looks around at the results of his handiwork]
FOX PRESIDENT
Then why are they refusing to write? I agreed to show Mohammad uncensored! I did what you asked! WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME??!!
CARTMAN
[hobbles up to him] Sir! Sir! [faces him] If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now they thnk they can walk all over you. [they both turn to face the tank] Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge.
FOX PRESIDENT
You're right. It's time I stop letting these primadonna manatees tell me what to do! I'm pulling the Mohammad episode, you got that?! And if you all don't want to work tomorrow, you can just find other jobs!! [faces the staff] How long before Family Guy's supposed to air?!
EXECUTIVE
Twenty-five minutes.
FOX PRESIDENT
I gotta hurry! [rushes off]
CARTMAN
I did it. I... AM... GOD!!!
[FOX Studios, outside. Cartman has left the offices and dances down a street]
CARTMAN
Family Guy is going off the air! No more Family Guy for me, mon frère!
KYLE
[appears in the shadows] Cartmaaaan!!! [Cartman stops in his tracks] You fucking fatass!
CARTMAN
How the hell did you get out?
KYLE
That kid and I had a long talk! I told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you!
CARTMAN
Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?!
KYLE
[seething in anger] You are not. Killing. Family Guy!
CARTMAN
You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! Family Guy is as good as dead!
KYLE
[checks his watch] There's still time to tell the network president you're full of crap!! [runs off]
CARTMAN
[runs ahead and cuts him off] I can't let you do that!
KYLE
Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass!
CARTMAN
[takes off his mittens] Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable. [Kyle removes his left mitten with his teeth and spits it away] Let this be our final battle. [they put on their battle faces and begin fighting, which is shown dispassionately. It's all a long series of slaps] Ow. OW! Stop it! Kyle, that's too hard! Ah! [they begin to move along a sidewalk] Ugh. Kyle! Stop it!
KYLE
Ow. Quit it!
CARTMAN
Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Bleh. Kyle! [throws him up against a wall. They slap each other some more and Kyle throws Cartman up against the wall. Some more fighting and Cartman throws Kyle up against a window, but they both crash through it into the King of the Hill offices.]
[King of the Hill offices. The boys continue fighting through the offices, Kyle having the upper hand]
CARTMAN
Stop it!
KYLE
Ow. Quit it!
CARTMAN
Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out. [Kyle stops his attack and a few seconds of silence follow. Then] Time in! [slaps Kyle hard. Kyle waits for a writer to stop staring, then resumes his attack] I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out!
KYLE
No more timeouts, fatass!
CARTMAN
Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay!
[King of the Hill offices, outside at the other end. The doors fly open and the boys fall out, get up, and resume their fighting. They are getting tired though.]
CARTMAN
Kyle! Kyle! Get the... Get the- Kyle! Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the balls! Dude, serious- seriously! That was in the balls! No hitting- No hitting in the balls! [throws Kyle off, but they resume fighting] Kyle! [Kyle finally gets Cartman in a reverse headlock. A few seconds later, he begins punching Cartman on the ribs] Quit it, Kyle. Give it up, Kyle! [gets out of the headlock, but the fighting resumes] Okay... Okay! Okay okay! [the fighting stops, and they're both panting] You win! You win. I give up. [kicks Kyle square in the nuts. Kyle doubles over in pain, coughing, and Cartman grins] Hahaha! I had my fingers crossed. [Kyle is still immobile, but a skateboard whacks Cartman from behind. Cartman falls over and Bart is there]
KYLE
[coughs] Thanks, kid.
[The Office of the FOX President. He is on the phone]
FOX PRESIDENT
Network Control! This is the President! I want you to pull the episode.
WOMAN
[whispers] What? [in normal tone] Mr. President, are you sure? [the other programmers look at her]
FOX PRESIDENT
I'm sure. Begin episode jettison sequence 0 2 900. [two programmers raise their access keys and insert them into corresponding locks in their desks, then turn the keys. Between their desks is a big red "PULL EPISODE" button. Its lid pops up and it begins flashing]
COMPUTER VOICE
Abort System initiated.
PROGRAMMER 1
Awaiting confirmation.
WOMAN
Mr. President, we need your final approval code.
FOX PRESIDENT
President approval code [Kyle runs past the office, but notices and comes back] 0-0-destruct-
KYLE
[runs in and interrupts] Sir! Mister television executive! Stop!
FOX PRESIDENT
Who are you?
KYLE
Listen to me: the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of Family Guy forever!
FOX PRESIDENT
The end of Family Guy?
WOMAN
Mr. President, we need final authorization!
FOX PRESIDENT
Hold on, Julie! [covers the transmitter] What are you talking about, kid?
KYLE
Pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction. You'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely. It's what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
FOX PRESIDENT
You mean... the manatees aren't trying to run the network?
KYLE
What manatees??!! [a fist knocks him away and Cartman steps in]
CARTMAN
Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing!
KYLE
[quickly rises] No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President!
WOMAN
Mr. President, we're awaiting your orders!
KYLE
Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech!
CARTMAN
No! Think about the people who could get hurt!
FOX PRESIDENT
Ah... I don't know who to listen to!
CARTMAN
Okay, I'll make it easy for you. [pulls out a gun and aims it at the president] Pull the Mohammad episode, now!
FOX PRESIDENT
Okay, I'll listen to you. [gets back to the phone] Julie?
KYLE
Noo! Wait! You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful monster who only wants Family Guy off the air!
FOX PRESIDENT
But he has a gun.
KYLE
You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!
CARTMAN
Shut up, Kyle!
FOX PRESIDENT
I can't be responsible for people getting hurt. Especially me.
KYLE
Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here.
CARTMAN
Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President!
FOX PRESIDENT
I shouldn't even be in the office still. It's supposed to be half-day Friday.
WOMAN
Mr. President, thirty seconds to airtime. What do you want us to do?!
KYLE
Do the right thing, Mr. President.
FOX PRESIDENT
How about I allow the episode to air but, just censor out the image of Mohammad again.
KYLE
I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more.
CARTMAN
No gay speeches, Kyle!
KYLE
If you don't show Mohammad, then you've made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at, and what isn't. Either it's all okay, or none of it is.
WOMAN
Five seconds, Mr. President! [the programmer J. Walker has his finger hovering on the button]
KYLE
[softly] Do the right thing. Show Mohammad. [Cartman still has his gun on the president] Do. The right. Thing.
WOMAN
Mr. President, we need a decision now!
FOX PRESIDENT
Family Guy goes on air as planned. Uncensored.
KYLE
Yes! [dances]
CARTMAN
No! No, I hate Family Guy!! [tries to fire the gun, but it seems to be empty. No bullets come out. He throws it down.]
WOMAN
Air it! [a different programmer gives his thumbs up and then turns to press the "AIR EPISODE" button. The credits come up and the self-destruct programmers remove their keys and sigh in relief. The "PULL EPISODE" lid comes down]
[The episode]
LOIS
Peter! You got a pink slip at work?
PETER
You think that's bad? Remember the time I got a salmon helmet from Mohammad while wearing a toga?
[The flashback. The doorbell rings]
PETER
[dressed in a toga, answers the door] Coming Mohammad. [opens the door. A salmon helmet appears and he reaches out to grab it]
[In this shot, Mohammad hands a football helmet to Family Guy.]
[Comedy Central has refused to broadcast an image of Mohammad on their network.]
PETER
Wow, a salmon helmet! Thanks! [closes the door and goes back to the sofa]
[back to the episode]
PETER
Anyway, what were we talking about?
[The White House. President Bush and his staff watch the episode.]
PETER
Oh yeah, my pink slip.
PRESIDENT BUSH
Hey, that wasn't bad at all. They just showed Mohammad standin' there, lookin' normal.
AN OFFICIAL
Mr. President, the terrorists are retaliating!
PRESIDENT BUSH
What?!
PETER
Or the time I- [click. SNN shows up onscreen]
SNN ANCHOR
As soon as the image of Mohammad appeared, terrorist leader al-Zawahri announced the retaliation!
AL-ZAWAHRI
[translated] We warned you not to show Mohammad- But "Family Guy" did it anyways. So now, here is our retaliation on America!!!
[Osama bin Laden & al-Zawahri present

JESUS
Look at me! I'm Jesus! Would you like me to crap on you, Mr. Bush? [craps on Bush. More Americans walk in and start crapping]
ALL
Mmm, yummy yummy crap. [more people crap, and an American flag appears under them, being crapped on]
[THE END]

Oh yeah, take THAT! We burned you! THAT WAS WAY FUNNIER THAN FAMILY GUY.

script:A Million Little Fibers

[P.F Chang's China Bistro, night. A waiter arrives at a table]
WAITER
Hi, welcome to P.F Chang's. How spicy would you like me to make your Chang sauce?
HEAD WAITER
Chris, the people at Table 3 need their check.
CHRIS
[whispers] I know. I'm swamped. I've got no help here!
HEAD WAITER
Well what about the new waiter?
CHRIS
The new waiter is useless. And, I think he's high.
TOWELIE
[at another table, mixing sauce...] How spicy would you like your Chang sauce?
MALE DINER
Will you just place our order, please?
TOWELIE
Oh man, I have no idea what's goin' on.
HEAD WAITER
Everything okay here?
MALE DINER
Fine, except this towel has been mixing Chang sauce for fifteen minutes. He's clueless!
TOWELIE
Don't call me shoeless! You're shoeless!
MALE DINER
Yeah? Well you're a towel!
TOWELIE
You're a towel!
HEAD WAITER
All right, that's it! Get out of here! You're fired!
TOWELIE
Yeah!
HEAD WAITER
Not him, you!
TOWELIE
Awww.
[The sidewalk outside P.F. Chang's. Towelie walks towards the camera, dejected]
TOWELIE
Aw man, I really screwed up this time. The rent's due at the end of the month, and I don't have any money. I need to shape up and find a new job, quick. [stops] But first, maybe I'll get a little high. [pulls out a lighter and joint, and lights up. His eyes change color from white to pink] Wait. Here it goes. Good ideas comin'. Yeah. Hey yeah! I should become a writer! If I just write a book about my life, I can get it published and then make plenty of money to pay rent.
[Towelie, at home, night. He gets to work at an old typewriter: he puts a paper in and rolls it into place.]

[Towelie, at home, night. He gets to work at an old typewriter: he puts a paper in and rolls it into place.]
TOWELIE
I bet people can't wait to read my memoirs. [begins to type]
[A publisher's office, day. The publisher reviews the first draft Towelie brings in]
PUBLISHER 1
Aha. Mmm. Yes. Yes, I see. Well, that's quite a fascinating story, you being engineered as a towel with a computer chip that determines dryness.
TOWELIE
Yep! And it's all true.
PUBLISHER 1
Chapters 4 through 8, however, seem to all be about Doritos Brand Corn Chips.
TOWELIE
I guess I could edit those chapters down some.
PUBLISHER 1
Don't bother. I'm sorry to tell you this, sir, but nobody's ever going to publish your memoirs.
TOWELIE
Huh? Why not?
PUBLISHER 1
Well, just the small trivial fact that... people aren't interested in autobiographies of towels.
TOWELIE
Wull yeah, but, maybe people will read my memoirs and like, apply its lessons to their own lives.
PUBLISHER 1
No. They won't. Because they're people. And you're a towel.
TOWELIE
You're a towel!
PUBLISHER 1
No. I'm a big book publisher who's not the least bit interested in your stony memoirs. You're a towel.
[Porcupine Press, day. Towelie leaves the building]
TOWELIE
Now what am I gonna do? I gotta pay rent and I just wasted three weeks writin' my memoirs. It's time for me to stop bein' so irresponsible. I've gotta shape up, focus, an' come up with real solutions to my problems. [pulls out his joint and lighter again] I'd better get a little high. [strikes the flint once, but doesn't light the joint] Oh, maybe I shouldn't.
JOINT
But you have to think of somethin' fast, an' gettin' high makes you smart.
TOWELIE
All right, I'll just use my special gettin'-high powers one more time. [lights the joint and sucks some fumes in. His eyes turn pink again] Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Of course! That's it! Why didn't I think of it before? [grins a small grin]
["A MILLION LITTLE
FIBERS"]
[The page turns and the Chapter 1 is shown]
TOWELIE
[in the stacks of a library, he proof-reads] All my life I've been a pretty irresponsible towel. [crosses out "towel" and writes] person. I thought I was somehow stronger and more immune than other towels. [crosses out "towels" and writes] people. [the next sentence reads "But as I pursued my derelict..."] This is a really good idea.
[Another publisher's office, day. The publisher reads]
PUBLISHER 2
Ogh. Oh my God. Uh I could not believe a human being has led this kind of life, Mr...!
TOWELIE
[wears a small fedora and fake mustache] McTowelie. Steven McTowelie.
PUBLISHER 2
It's heartbreaking passages like this one: "I am a person who often gets hung out to dry by all those around me." I know this company would be honored to publish this book. I just have one small question first. You're not... a towel, are you?
TOWELIE
...No. If I was a towel, why would I be wearin' this hat, an' this fake mustache?
PUBLISHER 2
Right, I'm sorry. [rises] Well Steveen, if it's all right with you, I'm gonna to get our agents and lawyers on the phone right now. We're in business, sir.
TOWELIE
[quite pleased] All right!
[Oprah. Her splash screen comes on, the studio audience cheers]
OPRAH
Thank you so much. [the applause dies down] Once in a while I come across a book that is sooo honest and sooo moving that it changes my life. [holds up a book] "A Million Little Fibers" is the true story about a man who was born in a laboratory. Please welcome author Stevem McTowelie! [she fairly sings his last name. Towelie comes out to cheers from the audience and climbs onto the sofa with some difficulty] Steven, when I read your book, I thought to myself, "How can a human being go through all this and still turn out okay?"
TOWELIE
Well, I guess I'm just an extra-special tow- [stops himself] person.
OPRAH
You talk in your book how you would sometimes have to spend days hung up on a rack. What would that do to you emotionally? You have been through... so much, [the camera pans down to her crotch] and I think that people all over America could benefit...
HER CROTCH
[in one UK accent] Oh God, there she goes again, babblin' about people's lives and carryin' on. She hasn't paid any attention to me in years!
OPRAH
...a life that kept getting up whenever it was down...
HER CROTCH
Nobody knows what it's like to be Oprah's minge. All she does is work, never gives her ol' minge a nice rub now and again. A minge needs attention! At least a scratch once in a while!
OPRAH
Well Steven, your book hasn't sold a lot of copies yet, but I have some pretty exciting news for you!
MINGIE
Used to be a time when Oprah would play with me night and day. She'd pet me for hours usin' every finger. Now I just sit here, in the dark, not even so much as a pinky! I should write a book! Be much more depressin' than his!
OPRAH
And so, Steven, I'm making your book my official Book of the Month selection! [sing-song ending]
TOWELIE
Really? [the audience cheers] Wow. I'm gonna get super-rich now.
[The book goes into mass circulation, the presses printing, cutting and binding at a fast pace. The paper cover goes on last, and the new book drops through a trap floor into a waiting cardboard box with more copies of the book within. The cover is shown and the box closed and shipped out. Next, Towelie is at a book-signing at Frontier Books autographing the books of a line of waiting readers. Posters promoting his book appear on the sides of buses, another shot of Towelie signing books at Frontier as dollar signs float by, a man checking the book out through a window at Tiara Books, shoppers buying the book at Barnes & Legal as Towelie floats by with his bong]
[Oprah's office. She has a lovely Persian rug there.]
OPRAH
[talking to her programming people] Uh huh, okay. Well listen, maybe we can get her in as a guest on the 19th. All right, is John Travolta available to be a guest the week after that? Okay, that might work better since it's Sweeps Week.
MINGIE
Can't take it anymore. All she ever does is work work work, never pays attention to the ol' minge. I'm always trapped in these stuffy pantsuits. I want attention! I'm bloody bored!
A VOICE
[in a different UK accent] Oh stop your complainin'! I'm tryin' to sleep back here.
MINGIE
Ay, 'oo's that? Is that you, Gary?
GARY
Yes it's me. You think you've go' it bad? Oprah hasn't paid any attention to me in years.
MINGIE
Oh, what do you care? You're just an asshole. I'm a minge! Minges need stimulation.
GARY
Assholes need stimulation too, you bastard! I want to travel. I want to see Paris. I thought lamp was goin' to get better, but Oprah's always busy. Werkin' and werkin', diyatin' and not diyatin'. I need a pukin' up mounds of chocolate cake or teaspoons of weedgrass.
MINGIE
She's a workaholic. Let's face it: the only way we're ever goin' tuh get any attention is if Oprah doesn't work anymore.
GARY
Well that'll never happen.
MINGIE
Not unless she gets fired.
GARY
[wonders] Fired... You got a plan, Mingie?
MINGIE
That bloke on the show today, the one Oprah supported. 'E isn't a bloke at all. 'E's a towel.
GARY
Ooo. How d'you know?
MINGIE
[low, ominous voice] I'm a minge. Minges know a towel when they hear one. If evidence gets out that Oprah's champion author is a towel, she'll look right foolish. Fans'll start droppin' off by the millions.
GARY
'Ow do we get proof?
MINGIE
We get somebody else to do it. The greatest investiga'ive reporter of our time.
[Geraldo Rivera's office, evening. Geraldo is busy writing up a report]
BUTLER
Mr. Rivera.
GERALDO
What is it, Dimitri?
DIMITRI
There's somebody on the phone to speak with you. He says he has inside information for you that may discredit Oprah Winfrey. [Geraldo stops, rises, and goes into his private offce, where he answers the phone]
GERALDO
[sits down] Thith ith Geraldo.
MINGIE
[somehow on the phone] 'Allo 'Eraldo. I've got some information for you ya might find interestin'. It could make Oprah Winfrey look quite foolish.
GERALDO
Who am I thpeaking with?!
GARY
'E wants to know who 'e's speakin' with.
MINGIE
Let's just say I work very closely with Oprah. You'd like to see 'er discredited, wouldn't ya?
GERALDO
[his left hand spread out over his chest] What information do you have?
MINGIE
What'd 'e say?
GARY
He wants to know what information we have.
MINGIE
Just tell me wha' 'e says, Gary! Don't wait for me 'o ask you "wha' 'e say?"!
GARY
Stop wastin' my time.
MINGIE
Ay, don't get snooty with me, Gary!
GARY
I didn't say "stop wastin' my time," Geraldo did.
GERALDO
What ith going on here?!
MINGIE
Oh all right Gary, this isn't workin'. Let's switch. I'll listen and you talk. [a few second later]
GARY
Hallo?
GERALDO
Who ith thith?
GARY
This is Gary.
GERALDO
Gary who?! What is your last name?!
MINGIE
Don't give away your name. We don't want anyone to know where we are.
GARY
A'right, look. All you need to know is that I'm definitely not Oprah's asshole.
MINGIE
Aw you stupid twit!!
GARY
Don't call me a twit, Geraldo!
MINGIE
He didn't call you "stupid twit," I did!! Now just tell 'im this:
GARY
The writer of the book on Oprah's Book of the Month Club is a phonih. He's not a person at all. He's a towel.
GERALDO
A towel? A talking towel? That doethn't make any thenthe.
MINGIE
Tell 'im 'e'd be surprised at things that can talk.
GARY
You'd be surprised at things that can talk.
GERALDO
What proof do you have of this accusation?!
GARY
Just look into the author of "A Million Little Fiyabers," and you'll discover the truth.
GERALDO
And how do I go about that? [click, and a dial tone. Geraldo tries to get the caller back on] Hello? HELLO?!
[Larry King Live. The splash screen pops up]
ANNOUNCER
This is Larry King Live.
LARRY KING
[Towelie is in the guest chair] My guest tonight is Steven McTowelie, author of the acclaimed book, "A Million LIttle Fibers." How are you tonight, Steven?
TOWELIE
Well Larry, I'm a little high.
LARRY KING
Your book has helped a lot of people beat addiction. What made you write it?
TOWELIE
Well Larry, I was... really just writin' down my memoirs as I-
LARRY KING
[holds his left hand up and looks to his director] What? What's that? Oh ex- oh excuse me, Steven, I understand that we have a special report coming in. Joining us live from Afghanistan, here is Geraldo Rivera. [a split screen comes up and Geraldo's feed struggles to come in]
GERALDO
Hello? Larry, are you receiving me?
LARRY KING
We're here, Geraldo. You're live on the show.
GERALDO
Larry, this brave reporter has been days investigating and researching, and I have come up with a shocking discovery that is going to rock the balls and ass of the literary world! Steven McTowelie, author of "A Million LIttle Fibers," is a towel!
TOWELIE
You're a towel.
GERALDO
No, you're a towel.
TOWELIE
Well you're a beaner towel.
GERALDO
What did you say??
[Oprah and two agents looks on from her office]
TOWELIE
I'm sorry. I'm high.
AIDE 1
This looks pretty bad, Oprah.
AIDE 2
Your fans look to you to be all-knowing and all-seeing, and you've just spent two weeks supporting a lying racist towel.
MINGIE
'E did it, Gary! 'Eraldo got the proof!
GARY
Oprah's got egg all over her face! She'll have to retire!
MINGIE
It's the beginning of a new life for us, Gary. Without 'er career 'o worry about, Oprah's sure to travel the world! Enjoy the finer things in life! She'll spend hours just ... playin' with 'er own minge!
GARY
And her Gary too.
MINGIE
Sure. And 'er Gary. We did it, mate!
AIDE 2
Oprah, we need to know what we're going to do.
OPRAH
What's the big deal? His book helped people. Why does it matter than he made some stuff up? Are people really going to be that mad?
[A Marryot Hotel, outside, day. Towelie looks down at the crowd from his hotel window. A large group has signs calling hima LIAR and demanding that he be put on trial or punished. More signs demand refunds on the books the bearers bought.]
PROTESTER 1
Your book got me to give up alcohol! But I thought you were a person!
PROTESTER 2
Yeah, we want our money back, you dumb towel!
LATINO PROTESTERS
¡No insultar Mexicanos! ¿Oye? ¡No insultar Mexicanos! ¿Oye?
TOWELIE
Oh God, I'm really in trouble now. [his phone rings and he answers] Hello?
OPRAH
Steven, it's Oprah. Can you come on my show again tomorrow?
TOWELIE
Why?
OPRAH
We need to tell the audience why you changed some of the facts in your book; that you thought it necessary to "heighten" certain things to make the book more relevant to people.
TOWELIE
Hey yeah.
OPRAH
Just come on the show and explain in a very level-headed way that changing some facts shouldn't matter if the book helps people, okay?
TOWELIE
Okay. Thanks Oprah! You're a real friend.
OPRAH
See you tomorrow.
TOWELIE
All right, I got one chance here. I need to focus and come up with what I'm gonna say. [gets out his joint and lighter] Maybe I should get a little high. [stops himself] No! Wait a minute! I'm not going to get high this time. [closes his lighter]
JOINT
Aw, come on. You need to come up with ideas of what to say on Oprah.
TOWELIE
But, the ideas I come up with when I'm high keep gettin' me in trouble.
JOINT
Yeah. That's why you should only get a little high.
TOWELIE
Well, maybe just a little high. [lights up and starts tokin']
[Oprah. Towelie returns for a second interview with her]
OPRAH
Today my guest is once again Steven McTowelie, whose memoirs many of you purchased after I made it my Book of the Month Selection. [a sea of angry faces looks back at the stage]
MINGIE
Ya hear that, Gary? Nobody's applaudin'!
GARY
Yeah! They're all right pissed off! This is great!
OPRAH
Now, it turns out that your name isn't really Steven. It's Towelie, correct?
TOWELIE
[sheepishly] Yeah.
OPRAH
And you are a towel.
TOWELIE
Yes, I'm pretty much a towel, Oprah.
OPRAH
Can you explain to the audience why you said you weren't a towel before?
TOWELIE
Well Oprah, I was all, like, um... uh, woo dat all like... It's like...
OPRAH
Was it that you thought embellishing the story was okay if it helped people?
TOWELIE
Yeah. Yeah, that's it!
OPRAH
Well you know what I think, Towelie? I think you're a LYING SACK OF SHIT! [the audience is a little shocked] You lied to all these people, and for what??!! To make money!! They bought your book thinking it was true!!
MAN 1
That's right!
MAN 2
Yeah.
TOWELIE
But I thought you said-
OPRAH
How DARE you like to me and make me look foolish?!
MINGIE
What's this? What's she doin'?
GARY
I don't understand, Mingie.
OPRAH
You think writing is a joke, you stupid towel?!
MAN 3
Yeah, you you get him, Oprah!
AUDIENCE
Yeah!
OPRAH
You will not get away with this!
MINGIE
She's getting everyone back on er side! Oh, tha' clever cow!
OPRAH
You lied to me, Towelie! And therefore you have lied to America! [stands up] We are going to rise up against you! [the audience cheers her on] Is this audience ready for a good old-fashioned lynching?!
AUDIENCE
Yeah!
TOWELIE
Huh?
OPRAH
Audience, if you look under your seats, you'll find your very own torches! [the audience members reach down under their seats and pull up the torches they find there]
AUDIENCE
Whoa.
GARY
Minge, does this mean I have to wait to see Paris?
MINGIE
There's not gonna be any Paris! Don't you get it, Gary?! The fat cow get everyone on 'er side again! She'll be workin' more than ever now! Our plan is ruined!
GARY
No!
OPRAH
We'll give you a five-second headstart. [lights up her torch] One. Two. [throws away her lighter. Towelie hops off and starts running]
TOWELIE
Hoooo!
OPRAH
Let's get him! [turns right and chases him]
WOMAN
Burn him! Burn the towel!
MAN 4
Burn that which lies to Oprah!
[The Chicago streets. Towelie is running for his life, with Oprah and her audience in hot pursuit. Towelie rounds a corner and enters the First National Bank of Chicago. Towelie tries to get in, but finds he can't open the doors. Oprah and her audience quickly surround him at the doors.]
OPRAH
Looks like your time is up, Towelie! I've led my adoring fans RIGHT to you!
MAN 5
All right Oprah!
OPRAH
I've shown my fans that... ugh! Ow! Wha?? [her pants rip open over her crotch and a handgun pops out]
MINGIE
All right! Everyone back! Get back I said! [takes control of Oprah's body and turns her around. The fans cower]
OPRAH
What the hell is this??!!
MINGIE
[waves the gun around] Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt!
GARY
Mingie, what're you doin'?
MINGIE
Gettin' ou'a here Gary! One way or another! [a police officer shows up, gun at the ready]
OPRAH
What is going on??!!
MINGIE
[aims the gun at Oprah's head] Shut up! Shut up, you miserable old cow, or so help me I'll blow your brains out! [aims it at the police officer] I want a chooper! You got that?! And a jet waiting at the airport!
GARY
Mingie, have you lost your mind?
MINGIE
Come on, Gary! You always said you wanted to see Paris!
GARY
Not like this, Mingie. Not like this!
OFFICER
[approaching cautiously, ready to fire his gun] All right, gig is up. Put down the gun!
MINGIE
Stay back, mate!
OFFICER
Drop the gun and step away.
MINGIE
I'm warnin' you!
OFFICER
[takes a few steps forward] Put it down, I said- [a gunshot hits him in the chest] Augh! [falls onto his knees] Gawhh [falls forward and dies]
GARY
Jesus Minge! You killed him! You shot him dead!
MINGIE
No turnin' back now, Gary.
GARY
Oh God, I think I'm goinna be sick eh.
MINGIE
Oh keep your head, Gary.
GARY
I can't, uh... I'm goinna puke! [moments later he begins to puke]
MINGIE
Ah, Gary, that smells awful! Now I'm gonna throw up! [moments later he begins to puke. Everyone is looking on in amazement. One of the fans begins to move slowly away from Oprah, but Mingie notices and aims the gun at him] Try to leave and I'll shoot you too! You hostages aren't goin' anywhere till we get what we want!
MAN 6
Oh my God, what are we goinna do?
MAN 7
You got us into this, towel. Think of somethin'!
TOWELIE
All right, I'm gonna get a little high. [sets up to light the joint, but stops himself again] No! No I'm NOT gonna get high! Every time I get high, I come up with ideas that get me in more trouble. I'm not gettin' high this time!
[HBC World News]
GERALDO
I'm standing in the business district of central Chicago, where Oprah's vagina has killed a police officer and taken several people hostage. It is yet unconfirmed but believed that Oprah's asshole may be an accomplice in this as well.
SWAT OFFICER 1
Got the walkie-talkie you asked for.
MINGIE
Put it underneath me. [the SWAT officer bends down and place the walkie-talkie underneath Mingie] Slowly, mate, slowly! [the officer slides it in place] Now back off. [the officer backs away] All right, Gary, squeeze the walkie button. [click] This is Oprah's minge!
LT. NELSON
Hellow, I'm Lieutenant Nelson. What are your demands?
MINGIE
I want a chopper, and a jet waiting at the airport to take us to France! Plus we need some fresh knickers right away.
LT. NELSON
All right, how about fresh underwear for one hostage.
MINGIE
I'm not playing games with you, mate! Gary's drownin' in his own sick!
LT. NELSON
All right, we'll work on it. Don't do anything foolish. [turns off the walkie talkie] We don't have any time; this is the most unstable vagina I've ever talked to.
SWAT OFFICER 2
O'Reilly, you got a shot?
O'REILLY
[from a nearby rooftop] I got it. [has his sights on Oprah's minge]
LT. NELSON
[shifting gears] Not with those hostages so close! It's too risky!
GARY
Oh just put down the gun, Mingie. Maybe they'll go easy on us.
MINGIE
Don't be stupid, Gary. I've got a policeman. They'll fry me, lock you up for life.
GARY
[emotional] Aw Mingie, I'm soo scared.
MINGIE
We're gonna get out of here, mate. Just leave it to me.
SWAT OFFICER 3
Oprah's vagina, this is your last warning! Put down the gun!
MINGIE
If that chopper isn't here in two minutes, I'm killin' a hostage!
TOWELIE
Hey wait a minute. [begins to move slowly, then quickly to the bank doors again. He thinks a moment, then slides in under the doors and stands up. He turns around and opens the doors] Pssst! [the hostages look and then move into the bank]
MINGIE
I mean it! Hostages are gonna start dyin' if you don't listen! [the hostages run through the bank and out the back doors]
SWAT OFFICER 4
Hostages are clear!
LT. NELSON
All right, that's it. Take it out! [O'Reilly shoots]
OPRAH
AAAAaaah!
MINGIE
What the? Haha! You missed me, you stewpid buggers! You see that Gary? They can't even aim!
GARY
[softly] Min... [louder] Mingie.
MINGIE
Gary, what's, what's wrong?
GARY
They got me, Mingie.
MINGIE
No... Oh no!
GARY
Aye. They got me bad. Oh, the blood.
MINGIE
Try to hang on, Gary!
GARY
Ih... It's gettin' dark, Minge.
MINGIE
Oh Gary! What have I gotten ya into?
GARY
I've seen muh life flash before me eyes. Mingie!
MINGIE
I'm 'ere, Gary!
GARY
Where... where are we, Mingie? Are we in Paris?
MINGIE
Yeah. Yeah, we're in Paris, mate.
GARY
Ahhh... Is it as wonderful as I 'oped?
MINGIE
Ih, it's beautiful. We've finally made it!
GARY
Tell me what you see, Mingie.
MINGIE
[getting emotional] Well, there's the... Eiffel Tower right in front of us. The Louvre, right over there behind ya. And f-fresh baguettes all around.
GARY
Ahhh... I can smell them, Mingie. At least I got to see Paris before I- [and no more is heard from him]
MINGIE
Gary? Gary, say somethin'. [Gary craps his last, or maybe it's just a final fart] You killed him, you bastards! He didn't even want any part in this! This is all your fault, you stupid cow! You never gave your ol' Gary the time of day and now he's gone! Life ain't worth livin' any more! What's the use?! ...I'm comin' to see you, Gary! [the gun is cocked] I'm comin' to see ya!
OPRAH
No! Don't! [the gun goes off. Moments later, Oprah is put on a gurney and wheeled over to a waiting ambulance, and rolled in]
LT. NELSON
Oprah's going to be okay. Wish I could say the same for her vagina and asshole.
DETECTIVE
That's a great idea you had to sneak the hostages inside the bank.
MAN 7
Yeah, it sure was. We're sorry we tried to burn you and murder you before.
TOWELIE
Aw, that's okay. This whole thing was my fault. I learned that I shouldn't get high to come up with ideas. I should come up with ideas and then get high, to reward myself. [whips out his joint and lighter]
JOINT
Youuu said it. [Towelie lights it up and chugs away]

synopsis:Al Gore warns the school about the threat of ManBearPig.

script:ManBearPig

[South Park Elementary school gym, day. The student body is gathered there to hear from a guest speaker. Mr. Mackey is presiding.]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, students, we have a very special guest speaker today. Who can tell me the name of our country's last vice-president?
KYLE
Dick Cheney?
MR. MACKEY
No, the last one.
BUTTERS
Bill Clinton.
MR. MACKEY
No, Clinton's vice-president. [no one has an answer] He is here today to talk to you students about some very serious issues. Please welcome Al Gore. [some applause. Al Gore arrives and Mr. Mackey steps away to one side]
STAN
Who?
AL GORE
Thank you, Mr. Mackey, students of South Park Elementary.. I'm here to educate you about the single biggest threat to our planet. You see, there is something out there which threatens our very existence and may be the end of the human race as we know it. I'm talking of course about... [a projector comes on and a picture of a monster appears] ManBearPig. [a beast with the legs and tail of a pig, the body and arms of a bear, and the face and upper-body posture of a man]
KYLE
[softly, to Stan] ManBearPig? [Stan just turns his hands up and shrugs]
AL GORE
It is a creature which roams the earth alone. It is half man, half bear, and half pig. Some people say that ManBearPig isn't real. Well, I'm here to tell you know, ManBearPig is very real, and he most certainly exists. I'm serial. ManBearPig doesn't care who you are or what you've done. ManBearPig simply wants to get you! I'm super-serial. [Mr. Mackey and Mrs. Garrison just look at each other.] But have no fear, because I am here to save you! And someday, when the world is rid of ManBearPig, everyone will say "Thank you, Al Gore. You're super awesome." The end.
MR. MACKEY
[reappears and claps a little] Uhhh, ohhhkay, thank you Mr. Gore.
AL GORE
Thank you, class. Excelsior! [Stan and Kyle just blink at each other]
[South Park, evening. The boys are playing basketball in a neighborhood park. Cartman has possession of the ball.]
CARTMAN
[giggles as he dribbles] Check out this sweet move. [tries to dribble around Kyle, but Kyle blocks him] Kyle, you can't block like that.
KYLE
Just play the game, fatass!
STAN
[open under the net] Pass it to me, Cartman?
CARTMAN
Hang on. I'm going to do something killer. [tries to fake Kyle out, but Kyle taps the ball away. Cartman goes after it] God damnit, stop it, Kyle!
[Nearby, as the moon rises over the mountains, a shadow moves across the forest, its claws fairly visible.]
CARTMAN
[tries again, moving Kyle back some] All right, check it out. This is a total Kobe Bryant I'm about to do. [keeps dribbling without making a move]
KYLE
Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late!
[The beast moves closer to some bushes, then stands up and sees the basketball court.]
CARTMAN
Let's just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy! [again tries to get by Kyle, but Kyle taps the ball away again. Cartman chases it down again.] Kyle, knock it off! [the beast breaks through the bushes and steps onto the basketball court. Cartman continues to dribble]
STAN
Cartman, stop hogging the goddamned ball!
BEAST
FOOD! [it's Al Gore in a homemade ManBearPig costume. The boys turn to see who it is] Don't worry, it's not really ManBearPig. It's me, Al Gore.
KYLE
We know. [several seconds of silence follow]
CARTMAN
Dude, what are you doing?
AL GORE
I'm spreading ManBearPig awareness. Here, each of you kids take a pamphlet and a bumper sticker. [Kyle looks at the sticker; the sticker has a "ManBearPig" crossed out by a red circle and bar, and the words "We must all stop ManBearPig" to the left of the ManBearPig] I hope now you boys see that this is totally serial. The next time, it could be the "real" ManBearPig. Can I just get you to sign the awareness sheet? Just your name and phone number and where you first heard about ManBearPig?
RANDY
[waiting nearby in the family car] Uhh, Stan?
STAN
Oh, hey Dad.
AL GORE
[turns around slowly and waves] Hello.
RANDY
[vigilant] It's ah, getting late, boys. Why don't you get in the car and I'll drive you all home?
KYLE
Okay, Mr. Marsh. [the boys move towards the car]
AL GORE
Be safe. [the boys get in the car and Randy drives off. Al Gore looks on as they leave, then turns around and walks off in the opposite direction]
[Randy's car.]
RANDY
Boys, I don't want you hanging out with that ex vice-president anymore, okay?
STAN
Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig.
RANDY
ManBearPig?
KYLE
He's half man and half bearpig.
CARTMAN
No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig.
KYLE
That doesn't make any sense.
STAN
He could be half bear, half manpig.
RANDY
Boys, there's no such thing as a ManBearPig. The vice president is just desperate for attention.
STAN
But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends.
[Stan's room, night. He's fast asleep when his phone rings. Stan sits up and rubs his eyes, then hops off his bed and goes to answer the phone on his desk.]
STAN
Hello?
AL GORE
Hello, this is Al Gore.
STAN
[shuts his eyes and covers them with his left hand] Oh man... Hi Mr. Gore.
AL GORE
I was the vice president.
STAN
I know.
AL GORE
Can you and your friends make it to an emergency ManBearPig meeting tomorrow morning? I have some evidence he could be in this area.
STAN
Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy.
AL GORE
[several seconds of silence] Oh. I get it. You don't believe me either.
STAN
No, no, it's not that.
AL GORE
Yes it is. Nobody believes me! [gets emotional] I'm trying to warn everybody and nobody takes me serial! [begins weeping over the phone] I just want somebody in the world to take me serial just for once. [continues weeping over the phone, Stan rolls his eyes in pity.]
STAN
Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you.
AL GORE
No you don't.
STAN
Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him.
AL GORE
Are you serial?
STAN
...Yes, I'm serial.
AL GORE
[reinvigorated] Don't worry! We CAN stop him! Bring everyone you can to my ManBearPig meeting tomorrow at 8 a.m. sharp! [hangs up]
[A Komfort Inn, morning. The boys climb up to the second floor and walk to Room 2B.]
CARTMAN
Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?
KENNY
(Yeah, I don't get it.)
STAN
Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go. [the door opens and Al Gore greats the boys]
AL GORE
Hi kids! Come on in! [the boys follow him in] Okay, let's get this meeting started. What do you kids think we should do to stop ManBearPig?
STAN
Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado.
AL GORE
[alerted, goes down on one knee] What does your dad look like?? Does he have large hooves where his feet should be??
STAN
NO.
AL GORE
Damn. For a minute there, I thought we found him.
STAN
Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now.
AL GORE
[an alarm goes off nearby] Oh my God! [runs to his control center and leans back in his chair to look closely at his monitor. He begins to type quickly] ManBearPig screen active! What is this area of Colorado! It's a it's a cave of some kind! [a map of Cave of the Winds is shown, with the target below the text blinking]
KYLE
Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds. It's a tourist attraction.
AL GORE
Oh Jesus on ice skates, we've gotta get down there right away.
CARTMAN
Ah I don't think so, dude. [the boys head for the door]
KYLE
Yeah, we've got school anyway.
AL GORE
I can get you all excused from school. [the boys stop in their tracks and turn around.]
CARTMAN
You... have that kind of power?
AL GORE
Look! You boys have a chance to help me find and kill ManBearPig once and for all! I'm totally serial!
[Wonderful Cave of the Winds, day, inside. A tour group gathers to embark on its tour.]
TOUR GUIDE
Hello everyone, welcome to Cave of the Winds. Our tour is gonna take us to two chambers in one of the most elaborate cavern systems in Colorado. [his head bobs as he sighs] Before we get started I do understand we have a special guest in our group today: the ex vice president, Mr. Al Gore. [one or two people clap, and Gore smiles at the two ladies, one on either side of him] Mr. Gore asked me to make sure you all knew he was here. Now, once we enter the cave we do ask you that you follow two rules: stay on the path and do not touch anything. Aright, are we ready?
GROUP
Yeah.
TOUR GUIDE
Let's go cavin'. [turns on his headlight, opens the velvet rope and leads the group into the cave]
[The tour.]
TOUR GUIDE
Here we are in the main chamber of the cave; it was discovered in 1892 and first used as a hideout for smugglers of the Old West.
AL GORE
Have you noticed high deposits of sulfur or a salmon-like odor coming from the caves lately?
TOUR GUIDE
[to Al Gore] Ahh, no. [addressing the group] Now, as you can see, the cave is filled with stalagmites and stalactites. Water drips from the cave's...
AL GORE
All right, kids, I need you to keep an eye out for ManBearPig droppings.
KYLE
What do ManBearPig droppings look like?
AL GORE
Similar to pig droppings, but more manbearlike.
TOUR GUIDE
These rocks often make interesting shapes which we like to name. For instance, this one here we named "The Hanging Mushroom." [a solid stalactite in the shape of a penis] And over here we have "Man With Helmet and Two Bowling Balls." [a massive stalagmite, again in the shape of a penis and two large testicles] And finally, of course, the "Two Sisters." [two smaller stalagmites, each the shape of a penis and testicles] Now the cave itself is millions of years old and has a constant temperature of 57 degrees.
AL GORE
Groan! Groan! [this stops the tour and everyone turns to face him]
TOUR GUIDE
Sir? Mr. Gore? Is there a problem?
AL GORE
Not yet.
TOUR GUIDE
All right, everyone, if you'll step this way, you'll see how the cave gets its name. [the group moves forward]
AL GORE
[looks at an opening and motions the kids over] Kids! Kids, over here! Look.
KYLE
What?
AL GORE
I bet this is where he's hiding. [shines his light around] This looks like ManBearPig Central. Come on! [goes down the path he found] Come on! This is where ManBearPig is! I'm serial! [the boys follow him down the path. They have officially broken from the group.]
TOUR GUIDE
In certain areas of the cave, the wind actually blows through, causing a sound you can hear. [the cave begins to howl]
GROUP
Wow...
WOMAN
Take a picture of the sound, Steven. [her husband takes the picture.]
[Al Gore's path.]
STAN
Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group.
AL GORE
[hearing the wind] Wait! Shhh. [concludes] Christ! He's here! Take this rope! [hands some rope to Stan] Be ready to tie him up! [brings out a shotgun] I've got you now, you son of a bitch! [begins shooting randomly, and bits of the cave ceiling begin falling]
KYLE
What are you doing?! [bigger chunks of cave fall between Al Gore and the boys]
STAN
Oh no!
AL GORE
No!
THE BOYS
Aaaah! [the boys are now sealed off from Al Gore. Gore turns around and assumes the worst]
AL GORE
Leave them alone, you Goddamned ManBearPig!
THE BOYS
Help!
AL GORE
Damn you ManBearPig! They're just children!
[The tour. Chunks of cave begin falling along its path as well, and the tour guide takes appropriate action.]
TOUR GUIDE
O-kay, everyone, out of the cave. Now! [the group turns around and runs back towards the entrance. The collapse follows the group] Go! Go! Go out, now! [the last person out of the cave is Al Gore, and the cave entrance is sealed shut by the collapse of the cave ceiling]
[The inner collapse.]
KYLE
Hello?
STAN
Help!
KYLE
We're trapped in here!
CARTMAN
Somebody get us some help down hyah!
KYLE
Hello, help!
CARTMAN
Hello??
KENNY
(Hello!)
STAN
Help!
KYLE
Forget it! They can't hear us!
KENNY
(What are we gonna do??)
CARTMAN
[pointing at Stan] You'd better get us out of here, asshole!
STAN
[faces Cartman] Me??
CARTMAN
You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we're trapped in a cave!
STAN
Maybe there's another way out of here.
KENNY
(Oh, no kidding.)
KYLE
A-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction. [the boys split up. Kyle climbs along a pile of boulders] Oh man, we're in big trouble here.
CARTMAN
[scrambling along his own path] This is... bullcrap! If I'm thin- I'm gonna be so... pissed off! [loses his footing and slides down some distance to the floor. He gets up and coughs from all the dust that went up around him] Goddammit! [reaches down and grabs his flashlight. He slaps it until it comes back on, coughs, and looks ahead. His eyes grow big. Before him is "Smuggler's Den," a corner of the cave in which sits an open treasure chest and two skeletons guarding it. Gold and jewelry are in and around the chest, while the skeletons have guns in their hands. Cartman approaches slowly, in awe]
KYLE
You see anything, Kenny??
KENNY
(No, nothing!) [Cartman is frozen, speechless]
KYLE
Cartman?? Cartman, you see anything??
CARTMAN
[in a soft, trembling voice] No, nothing [clears his throat and speaks normally] No, nothing here! Nothing this way! [his eyes fixed on the look, he swoons] Tr... treasure.
KYLE
Cartman, you okay?? [Cartman snaps out of it] You need help??
CARTMAN
I'm fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now! [turns to head back to the other boys, but turns around one last time to remember where the treasure is, then heads back to his friends.]
KYLE
It looks like we're completely sealed in.
KENNY
(Yeah, No shit.)
STAN
[returning] There's a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep. [Cartman arrives]
KYLE
Maybe we should go for it.
CARTMAN
You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out. [the other three boys turn to face him]
KYLE
Why?
CARTMAN
I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down.
STAN
Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.
CARTMAN
No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead.
KYLE
No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon.
CARTMAN
That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there [points to his last location] if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump.
KYLE
Aw, dude! [lifts his jacket over his nose.]
[Cave of the Winds, outside. Rescue personnel have arrived and make their way towards the cave entrance. the tour guide demonstrates on a map what happened.]
MINER 1
The cave-in was massive. It has cut off all access in or out. The children are believe to be trapped somewhere in this area. [circles with his index finger an area on the right side of the map]
MINER 2
Does anybody know who these kids are?
MINER 1
No, nobody seems to knew them. Only that they were in the tour group. Digging to them is going to take days.
AL GORE
[arrives, interrupting] Excuse me, Excuse me. This cave-in was no accident, and it isn't going to stop unless we move fast! I am super... duper... serial!
MINER 1
What do you mean? The cave-in is over.
AL GORE
I'm afraid you have a much bigger problem than a cave-in.
MINER 1
What's that? [Gore whips out a drawing of ManBearPig]
FIREMAN
What is that, a pigbearman?
AL GORE
No, stupid! It's ManBearPig!
[Back at the inner collapse.]
STAN
I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here?
KYLE
They saw us on the tour. [Cartman comes back from the den] Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?
CARTMAN
I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.
KYLE
Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes!
STAN
Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow.
[Sleep time at the inner cave-in. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny sleep. Cartman sits alone, smiling.]
CARTMAN
[softly throughout] All that treasure. [gets excited] It's all mine! [gets angry] So long as these greedy assholes don't find out about it! [looks at the other boys] You would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure, wouldn't you?! Even though I found it, you'd love to think it's somehow yours, too! God, I hate you guys! [begins to crawl towards Kyle] Especially you, you money-grubbing snake in the grass! [reaches Kyle so that his face is smiling evilly down at Kyle's face. He whispers] Well I have news for you, Kyle! You're never going to get my treasure. I've got a little plan going, to get the treasure out of here without you ever knowing. [Kyle stirs and wakes up]
KYLE
C-Cartman?
CARTMAN
[says nothing for a few seconds, then] Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'?
KYLE
Dude, what are you doing?
CARTMAN
Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?
KYLE
Dude, get away from me!
CARTMAN
Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around. [gets off Kyle]
[Cave of the Winds, outside. The rescue personnel - rangers, firefighters, and paramedics - return to their work.]
AL GORE
[whining, stamps his right foot when saying "serial"] Why won't anybody listen to me?! ManBearPig is in there and we have to kill him while we all have the chance. I'm serial!
MINER 3
Mr. Gore, please, we need you to calm down. Now, w-what exactly do you suggest we do?
AL GORE
I told you we need to fill the cave with hot molten lead, 'cause it's the only way to make sure ManBearPig never comes out! And I'm sane and I'm totally serial, but everyone just keeps digging!
MINER 3
Well, see, the problem is that if we fill the caves with hot molten lead, it will kill those boys too.
AL GORE
They're already dead! Didn't you listen to me?? They got attacked by a ManBearPig and ManBearPig leaves nobody alive! I'm super serial! Nobody will listen to me but I'm serial! [begins to weep]
POLICE OFFICER
Do you want me to get the ex vice president out of here?
MINER 2
Naw, I f- I feel kind of bad for him. I don't think he has any friends.
[Smuggler's Den, some time later. Cartman makes his way to it again with a bottle of water in his right hand. He heads straight for the treasure and cackles softly, then stops.]
CARTMAN
[determined] All right. Gotta be strong. [looks at the coins in his hands] There's still a lot more treasure to go. [begins to swallow the coins and wash them down with "WOTTUR." He soon runs into some difficulty swallowing and drinking, so it seems like he's puking. The other three boys are awake and listening with concern]
STAN
Dude, he's really sick. [Cartman has moved on to swallowing necklaces and loose gemstones]
[Cave of the Winds, outside. The media have gotten wind of the story, so an HBC reporting crew has joined the rescue personnel.]
HBC REPORTER
It's been three days since four unidentified children were trapped in a cave-in. Three days without food and time is certainly running out. The digging continues, but progress is fatally slow.
MINER 1
All right, people, we've gotta work faster! Our best estimate still puts us three days from reaching the area of the cave called Smuggler's Den.
RANGER
Smuggler's Den?
TOUR GUIDE
Ih it's a room near the end of the tour where you can get your picture taken with fake treasure. Here, see? [holds up a picture of two kids standing in front of the treasure]
MINER 1
Based on where the boys were seen last, they're somewhere near this area! Hopefully they've followed the first rule of survival and stayed put.
[Back at the inner collapse. Stan is asleep and Kyle goes to wake him.]
KYLE
Stan! Stan, wake up!
STAN
[wakes up and rubs his eyes] Huh? What? Have they come for us?
KYLE
No, it's Cartman. Something's really wrong with him. [moves off, and Stan follows. Stan shines his light on Cartman, who's now overstuffed with the treasure he's been swallowing. Kenny holds the water bottle Cartman was drinking from]
CARTMAN
Meh, meuh urgh. [coughs] Mbeuh.
STAN
Oh my God. [runs up to Cartman] Cartman? Dude, can you hear me?
CARTMAN
[cough] I'm fahn. Just a lit- [gulp] No big deal. [burps] Beh.
KYLE
[taps Stan and takes him aside] We can't wait here any longer! Dude, we've gotta get him out of here or he's gonna die.
STAN
How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere.
KYLE
Maybe we should get out first. See if we can find a way out and then come back for him.
CARTMAN
NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die. [coughs]
[Cave of the Winds, outside. The rescue mission continues.]
[Back at the inner collapse. Stan, Kyle and Kenny have climbed out and have wrapped Cartman up to hoist him out. Cartman coughs as he rises to the top. The boys are pulling with all their might.]
KYLE
Come on come on! Pull!
STAN
Goddamnit, he's soo heavy!
CARTMAN
Buh. Hurry you guys. You gotta get me out of here. [grunts, and a fart comes out. His face lights up in alarm]
KYLE
What the hell is that??
STAN
Cartman?
CARTMAN
You guys, we've got no time! You gotta get me out!! [the boys pull again.]
[A river nearby. A crane approaches the river with a hoist full of boulders. Al Gore is manning the crane, moving levers here and there, positioning the hoist.]
AL GORE
This is the end of you, ManBearPig. [releases the boulders onto the river, and the water is diverted towards the cave] Excelsior!
[Cave of the Winds, outside. The rescue personnel stare as they notice water flooding towards the cave entrance. The water enters the cave]
KENNY
(We're almost there!)
STAN
[exhausted] I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength!
CARTMAN
Yes you do! [something drops, and the roar of flooding water is heard]
KYLE
What the hell is that? [the boys turn quickly to see where the sound is coming from, and the wave of water appears. Cartman coughs again. The water rises towards them.] Oh my God. [the boys back up]
CARTMAN
No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys!
KYLE
Ruuun! [the boys turn and run from the advancing water, but it overtakes them, sweeping them along]
[Cave of the Winds, outside. The flash flood stops all activity.]
MINER 1
That's it! Pull everyone out! There's nothing more we can do!
FIREMAN 2
You're calling off the rescue?
MINER 1
We didn't plan on a freak river flood. God must really want those kids dead.
FIREMAN 2
Well what if the children aren't dead?
MINER 1
Look, the cavern is completely flooded. Nothing could have survived. There's nothing left alive down there. [the guide and fireman turn right and walk past Al Gore]
AL GORE
[softly] Nothing left alive... [grins] I did it. I killed ManBearPig. I've saved the earth from certain destruction. Everyone is super-stoked on me, even if they don't know it.
[Cave of the Winds, inside. The boys have been swept into a newly-made lake. Stan is the first to pop up out of the water. He swims to a nearby bank and holds on to a boulder. Kenny pops up next to him.]
STAN
Kenny! Here, take my hand! [Kenny does so and makes it to safety. A change of POV shows Kyle hauling Cartman] Hurry Kyle, the water's rising!
CARTMAN
Grab my hand.
KYLE
Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs!
CARTMAN
I can't kick!
KYLE
Yes you can!
CARTMAN
I can't! Kick yourself back to safety!
KYLE
I need your help!
CARTMAN
No, you just have to save me. [Cartman stops and begins to drop down to the bottom, taking Kyle with him]
STAN
Kyle! No!
[Cave of the Winds, outside. The music indicates a funeral, and it is so. Al Gore is at the podium giving a eulogy.]
AL GORE
We are gathered here to say goodbye to four kids whom we all tried to help, but, in the end, could not. But where there is loss, there is hope. For ManBearPig is no more.
TOUR GUIDE
Oh Jesus, here we go again. [the mourners hold candles with little paper guards over their hands]
AL GORE
I have beaten ManBearPig, and we will never forget the names of the brave young kids who lost their lives. Kid 1, Kid 2, Kid 3, and of course, Kid 4. [off to the mourners' left, some rocks move and give way to a new opening] I remember how Kid 1 used to laugh and play. [a tour guide notices and watches. The rocks move some more and Stan appears] And how Kid 2 was always there when I needed him.
STAN
Agh.
MINER 4
[jumps out of his seat and stands up] Oh my God! ["Kid 4 was filled with hope and ... terrorism when..." Stan and Kyle work to pull Cartman out, but it's hard]
MINER 1
It's the kids! [everyone rises and runs towards the boys]
MINER 4
They're alive! [all four of them are out now]
AL GORE
[walks up to the boys] Kids! I saved you!
STAN
Just stay away from us, asshole! I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you, because you don't have any friends! But now I see WHY you don't have any friends! You just used ManBearPig as a way to get attention for yourself because you're a LOSER!!
AL GORE
[undaunted] Hyeah right. The man who singlehandedly killed ManBearPig is a loser. [grins. Cartman starts to groan]
KYLE
We need to get our friend to a hospital right away!
CARTMAN
No! No I'm fine! [begins to walk with difficulty] I just need to get home, a-and rest.
STAN
Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.
CARTMAN
[leaving] Noo! I just need to get to a toilet. See you guys. I... [stops] habbeh... HABBEHHHHHHHHHH! [his pants rip open in the rear and much of the treasure he had swallowed comes flying out of his body. Then he farts. A long silence follows as everyone looks at him and at the fake treasure he just pooped out]
KYLE
Dude, did Cartman just crap treasure?
CARTMAN
It's mine! It's mine, you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to me! Keep your greedy hands away!
TOUR GUIDE 2
Hey, that looks like the fake treasure from our Smuggler's Den photo room.
CARTMAN
That's right, and I... [looks at the tour guide] Fake treasure?
TOUR GUIDE 2
Yeah, we put it there for kids to take their picture with. All in all, I'd say that treasure is worth about fourteen dollars.
CARTMAN
Noo... NOOO!! [craps out some more treasure] NOO! OW!
KYLE
You made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! You son of a bitch!
CARTMAN
Don't you think I'm hurting enough, Kyle?! Ah, ow!! [craps out even more fake treasure] Dowww!
AL GORE
[now wearing a cape, loosely] Well, my work here is done. I've killed MBP, and now I must save the world from something else. Maybe I'll make a movie. A movie starring me. Then people will take me super-serial. [runs off in superhero pose]
CARTMAN

synopsis:When Cartman's mom realizes she can't control her son anymore, she gets help from an expert. The "Dog Whisperer" may have what it takes but Eric Cartman's not going down without a fight.

script:Tsst

[Mr. Mackey's office, day. He's at his desk with Liane and Eric facing him]
MR. MACKEY
Mrs. Cartman, we have had it with your son's behavior, mkay?! Little Billy Turner is now being treated at the hospital!
LIANE
Eric, why would you do such a thing?
CARTMAN
I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to the school flagpole.
MR. MACKEY
You know that's not the point!
CARTMAN
Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg.
LIANE
That's very naughty, Eric.
CARTMAN
Well he called me chubby!
MR. MACKEY
We have tried at this school to make Eric understand that there are boundaries, mkay?! But frankly, we believe his behavioral problems start at home!
LIANE
[agreeing] I know. I know he's out of control. But... you don't know what it's like. [reaches into her purse, pulls out a napkin and cries into it] I'm sorry. It's just that... he seems to get worse every day. [crying through her words] He just never listens.
CARTMAN
Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry!
LIANE
It's not him, it's you, Eric. [Cartman's anger vanishes] I don't know what to do with you.
CARTMAN
Sure you do. You're a great mom.
Who's got the greatest mom in the world?
I dooo.
My mom is number one in my heart.
It's true!
LIANE AND ERIC
My mom's the best mom, better than your mom.
It's singing together in harmony.
MR. MACKEY
Mrs. Cartman, I know this is extremely difficult but, there is help out there for people like you. Have you ever heard of a show called Nanny 911?
[Nanny 911 clips.]
ANNOUNCER
They're every parent's worst nightmare. [Two boys are in a bedroom. The older boy jumps around on the bed and throws a blue pillow at the younger one, the younger one cries, gets up, and throws the pillow back at him.]
GIRL
[in the bathroom with her father] Shut up! I hate you! I hate you! [runs away. Her father cries]
ANNOUNCER
Kids completely out of control. [a boy is at the dining table at home, next to a bowl of spaghetti. He picks up the bowl, turns it over, dumps the spaghetti to the floor, and wears the bowl as a hat]
BOY
[drops to the floor and slides around in the spaghetti] Look, I'm skating, I'm skating!
ANNOUNCER
It's time to call Nanny 911. [a silhouetted nanny walks in from the left and into the show's coats of arms. Next shot is a camera zooming into NANNY CENTRAL. Inside the manor the nannies are shown: Nanny Stella, Nanny Deb, Nanny Yvonne, and Nanny Skexis] We've gathered a team of world-class nannies to help families in crisis. [five kids are on a living room sofa. One kid dances around, another repeatedly bangs an object on the floor, two others throw stuff to the floor] Parents of America, help is on the way! [Cartman is shown finger-painting] Tonight...
CARTMAN
[grabs a can of Red Bull. Several more cans are scattered around, and one of them has tipped over and spilled some drink] Mom, I need another energy drink! [tosses a can away. Next shot, he's in the tub taking a bath and farts. Next shot, he has finished off the tacos his mom served him and takes one of hers without permission.]
ANNOUNCER
This eight year old son of a single parent just won't behave.
CARTMAN
[from his days supporting Mel Gibson's The Passion Of The Christ: pounds the table a few times] Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! [his hair gets messed up from the impacts]
ANNOUNCER
And Nanny Stella is selected to set him straight. [Stella, a stout blonde, walks toward Cartman's house, and people take second looks at her. She approaches Cartman's front door]
STELLA
It's time for Nanny Stella to show Eric Cartman his ways are not going to be tolerated anymore! [knocks on the door. Inside, Cartman is playing a video game. Stella knocks again]
CARTMAN
Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody's at the door!
LIANE
[walks by] Yes. I think it's the nanny, poopsiekins.
CARTMAN
Killer. I'm gonna be on TV now. [burps]
STELLA
[Liane answers the door] Hello. I'm Nanny Stella.
LIANE
Oh, thank you so much for coming. Please come in. [shows Stella in. Stella walks up to Cartman]
STELLA
And you must be Eric.
CARTMAN
Mom, I want a Twinkie.
LIANE
All, all right dear. [starts walking, but Stella stops her]
STELLA
Hold on, Mrs. Cartman. There are going to be some rule changes around here, Eric. First of all, no video games until chores are done.
CARTMAN
[glances up at her] Ha! Hahahahahaha!
STELLA
I'm serious. Let's put down the video game and go to the kitchen.
CARTMAN
[mocking her British accent] No thanks, I'd rather naught.
STELLA
Right. Then I'm going to have to take it. [takes away the controller, then unplugs and gathers up the rest of the game console]
CARTMAN
The hell do you think you're doing?
STELLA
Come on. [leads Liane and Cartman into the kitchen and sets the console down] This video game is going right here on the counter until we've done some chores. Now, first thing we're going to do is make your bed. [She walks off. Eric simply grabs the console and heads back to the living room, and she returns] Eric, no! This is not acceptable! [takes the console and sets it back on counter]
CARTMAN
Stop trying to bogart my Xbox, you fat bitch!
STELLA
All right, that's it! [grabs his hand] You're going to time-out! [leads him away]
CARTMAN
Time out?
STELLA
[takes him to a stool and places him on it as Liane watches] Whenever you are naughty, Eric, you are going to sit on this stool for five minutes.
CARTMAN
[glances down and thinks] And what exactly keeps me on the stool?
STELLA
It's the time-out stool. You can't get down until the time is up.
CARTMAN
[looks at her, then hops off the stool] Whoa, how did I do that? [walks off to get his X-Box]
STELLA
Eric, you have to stay in time-out!
CARTMAN
Ummm, no?
STELLA
[approaches him, takes his hands off the console, and takes him back to the stool] Come on, you don't have a choice.
CARTMAN
All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now.
STELLA
[genuflects and addresses him firmly] Eric, you need to listen to me. [to Liane] This is very important. I am getting down to eye level with Eric so that I can talk to him on his level. [to Eric] Eric, you need to understand why you are being punished. All right?
CARTMAN
I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move.
STELLA
Well then, I'll just have to stand right here! [Cartman snorts inward, gathering up a wad of mucus and saliva and spitting it at Stella's mouth] Oh! [Cartman hops off and walks toward his X-Box] He spit in my mouth!
LIANE
Yeah, it's best to avoid his level.
STELLA
All right! I've dealt with this before! We just need to use psychology on him!
CARTMAN
[hooks up the X-Box again] Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.
STELLA
[genuflects behind him and embraces him] Eric, can I just talk to you for a quick second? Why are you so angry?
CARTMAN
Because you took my Xbox.
STELLA
Is this about more than your video game? Are you feeling angry at me because you think I'm here to change your life?
CARTMAN
Well, yeah.
STELLA
And you're feeling like I have no right to come in and tell you how to live.
CARTMAN
Yeah. I guess so.
STELLA
[to Liane] See this? You have to take the time to talk to your children about their feelings. What else are you feeling, Eric?
CARTMAN
Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny.
STELLA
Me? Well, it's because I love children, like you.
CARTMAN
Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy?
STELLA
Oh, I just never had kids.
CARTMAN
Why not?
STELLA
It... just... didn't happen.
CARTMAN
You're sterile, is that it? [she releases him, taken aback by that question] No, that's too convenient of an excuse. The truth is, nobody ever wanted to have babies with you. Isn't that it? [her jaw drops] Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless.
STELLA
Why you, you... [stands up] you little bastard! How dare you?!
LIANE
Eric, naughty.
STELLA
What kind of [picks him up by the collar] monster would-
CARTMAN
Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile! [Stella drops him and steps back a bit]
STELLA
That's it! [walks up to the camera] I'm not doing this!
LIANE
Oh, but we really need some help. [Stella steps back to talk to Liane]
STELLA
Find yourself another nanny... television show!
[Next nanny show: A British flag, then a smiling nanny, then the nanny next to a British phone, with three kids next to her, then an early limousine pulls up and she gets inside it, then an American flag appears, then she's having dinner with an American family. Last scene is a montage of children she's dealt with over the length of her career]
ANNOUNCER
Coming up next, it's Super Nanny! Where other nannies fail, Nanny Jo comes through. [a parasol appears in her hand, then the camera pulls back to show three child silhouettes on either side of her. The silhouettes jump up and down]
[The Super Nanny's limo rolls up to Cartman's house. In the back seat, she's holding up a portable DVD player. A scene of Nanny 911 is playing: Stella taking the X-Box from Cartman after they enter the kitchen]
JO
This child's behavior is totally unacceptable!
[Cartman's front door. Jo walks up and knocks]
JO
Well, there's no trial too tough for Super Nanny! In just three days' time you're going to see a new Eric Cartman.
[Three days later, Slater-Carey Mental Hospital. Inside, a doctor is walking down the hall with Liane]
DOCTOR
I'm afraid Super Nanny is in a deep state of mental psychosis.
LIANE
What do you mean?
DOCTOR
I mean, [looks into the nanny's room, 23A] she spends most of her time sobbing and eating her own excrement. [Liane looks inside through a window. Jo is glued to her toilet seat, eating her own shit.]
JO
[through mouthfuls of poop] From heeell! It's from heeell!
LIANE
Oh dear. I don't know what else to do about my son's behavioral problems. We've been through every nanny reality show on television.
DOCTOR
Well there... is... one more show you could still try.
[Dog Whisperer title screen. First scene: two dog owners try to keep their angry dogs away from each other. Second scene, a Chihuahua tries to keep a lampshade his owner is trying to take from him. Next, a man runs through a meadow with four dogs. Next, he's skating down a city street with six dogs on leashes pulling him along. Next, he's training a dog at poolside. Next, he's handling a terribly agitated dog. Next, he's running along a shore with the six dogs he had on leashes earlier, now unleashed. Next, he's giving a dog's leash to its female dog owner. Finally, a montage of silhouettes with Cesar and a bunch of dogs]
ANNOUNCER
When good dogs go bad, there's one man who's their best friend. Cesar Millan.
CESAR
No dog is too much for me to handle. I rehabilitate dogs, I train people. I am the dog wheesperer.
[The Cartman house, day. Cesar approaches the front door and knocks. Liane answers]
LIANE
Please, come in.
[The living room. Cesar walks in and quickly ignores Cartman]
CESAR
So tell me what are the problems you are having with the child?
LIANE
Well, he's just... out of control. I mean, he never listens to me, and he pretty much runs my life.
CESAR
So the child needs to learn that he's not the most important person in the house.
CARTMAN
You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake.
CESAR
See I'm not looking at the child, I'm not acknowledging the child, I'm just letting the child know I'm not interested in him.
CARTMAN
Not interested in me?
CESAR
See the child thinks your world revolves around him, because it does. Because everything he does gets a response from you.
CARTMAN
Yeah, well I don't see why-
CESAR
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
CARTMAN
Hey!
CESAR
Don't look at the child; just keep looking at me. Let, let him know we are having a conversation.
CARTMAN
Mom, this guy doesn't-
CESAR
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
CARTMAN
Ah! Quit it!
LIANE
What what is it that you're doing?
CESAR
Dogs show their dominance by nipping each other on the neck, but it works equally well on a child. I just use two fingers, nip at the child's neck, doesn't hurt the child, just let him know I am dominant.
CARTMAN
Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can-
CESAR
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
CARTMAN
KNOCK IT OFF!
CESAR
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. See, I'm not validating his bad behavior with either negative or positive response.
LIANE
Oh, that's very interesting.
CESAR
I think the first thing we need to work on is getting the child some exercise. He's fat and he has all this pent-up energy that-
CARTMAN
I'm not fat!
CESAR
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. -we need to let him burn off. Do you take walks with your son?
LIANE
Well, no, I don't.
CESAR
Go on, take your son for a walk.
[Outside. Cesar and Liane are walking along, with Cesar holding Cartman on a leash and harness]
CARTMAN
Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch?
CESAR
See once again, I am the one going for a walk. It's about me, the child is lucky to come along.
CARTMAN
Mom, this is degrading!
CESAR
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
CARTMAN
Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh! [begins to strain the leash, but can't get loose. He struggles to escape]
CESAR
Don't look at him, just look straight ahead and he'll run out of evergy soon. [Cartman tries to get loose from the leash, but Cesar reins him back every time. Cartman starts getting tired.]
CARTMAN
Maaaa. Mommm. [getting hoarse] Mommm.
CESAR
Here, why don't you try it now? Take your son. [Liane takes the leash and Cartman goes to her left side]
CARTMAN
Mom, seriously, people are seeing me!
CESAR
Good. Just keep your confidence, shoulders back, eyes straight ahead. The child can pick up on that confidence, learning he's supposed to follow you, not lead you.
CARTMAN
Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now?
LIANE
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. [Cesar is pleased]
CARTMAN
Mom!
CESAR
Good, Ms. Cartman. Very good!
[The Dog Whisperer, back to the show.]
ANNOUNCER
And now, back to the Dog Whisperer.
[Cesar is in the living room talking with Liane. A bag sits on the floor to his left.]
CESAR
It is important to understand that dogs run in packs. And one dog is always dominant: the pack leader.
CARTMAN
[on the sofa to Liane's left] God dammit stop ignoring me!
CESAR
You must assert yourself as pack leader with dominant energy.
LIANE
Ahall right.
CARTMAN
This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention!
LIANE
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
CARTMAN
Quit it, mom!
LIANE
It doesn't seem to work as well when I do it.
CESAR
Okay, let me show you how to express the dominant energy. What I have done is I have brought over some Kentucky Fried Chicken. [pulls a bucket of chicken out of the bag. He and Liane walk away from the sofa]
CARTMAN
Ooo, Colonel?
CESAR
I am going to eat first, because that is what the pack leader does. [Cartman hops down from the sofa and goes to the bucket]
CARTMAN
Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken.
CESAR
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
CARTMAN
Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken!
CESAR
I am not going to acknowledge the child's attempt at aggressive dominant behavior. Now you eat the chicken. [hands the bucket to Liane]
CARTMAN
Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom!
CESAR
We won't reward him until he's in a calm submissive behavior.
CARTMAN
[to Cesar] Goddammit, I am not a dog! [turns to Liane and hops up and down like an excited dog] Give me the chicken. Give, give, give me the chicken. I want the chicken! Chicken! [gets shrill] Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken!
CESAR
[observing Cartman] We need him to become relaxed and submissive.
CARTMAN
Gih- [quiets down] Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now. May I have some chicken please?
LIANE
Oh, very good, sweetie.
CESAR
Oh no, now he's lying. You can tell from his stance he's still aggressive-dominant.
CARTMAN
Suck my asshole, taco vendor!
CESAR
See?
CARTMAN
Goddamnit, you can't stand here and eat KFC in front of me! [to Liane] Now hand it over!
CESAR
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
CARTMAN
You can't do that to me, I-
CESAR
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. [Cartman sits on the floor]
CARTMAN
Goddamnit, you just can't-
CESAR
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. [Cartman is on his back]
CARTMAN
Seriously! Ey? Eh... [he's now fully on his back, calm]
CESAR
I am not being aggressive; I am being dominant.
LIANE
Wow, I have a lot to learn.
CARTMAN
[sits up, then stands] Mom, I am serious! This has gone on long enough! Get that guy out of here and give me a piece of chicken! [Liane ignores him by looking up and away] That's how you want it, bitch?! Fine! [goes upstairs] I hate you! I'm running away!
LIANE
Oh dear. [Cartman's bedroom door closes]
CESAR
It's okay, this is all part of the dominance struggle.
LIANE
But what if he does run away?
CESAR
Let him go. He'll be back. This a good opportunity for you to relax and enjoy your favorite hobby. [they walk toward the kitchen]
[Stan's living room, later. Stan, Kyle, Butters, and Kenny are playing Monopoly.]
BUTTERS
[his turn] Oh boy, Park Avenue! I'm rich! [he and the dealer Stan exchange money through Kyle. Cartman enters]
CARTMAN
Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news. [sighs as Kyle takes his turn] I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn't even try to stop me. It's gonna be tough livin' on my own. But I'll get by, somehow.
STAN
[takes his turn] You can't stay here.
CARTMAN
Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street!
KYLE
You're not staying at my house either.
CARTMAN
All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you.
BUTTERS
No, my parents won't let me bring homeless people home anymore.
CARTMAN
Well what do you guys expect me to do?! Stay at Kenny's house?! [Kenny takes his turn] His family's totally poor; I'm not staying with poor people! [play continues] All right, I'll stay with Kenny. Let's go, man.
KENNY
(Fuck you.)
CARTMAN
Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere! [Butters takes his turn] Out in the cold! Probably get mugged and gang-raped by some minorities! You guys'll be sorry when I turn up dead! [walks out and shuts the front door]
BUTTERS
[taking his turn] Whoopie! G and R Railroad!
[Jimmy's house. The doorbell rings and Jimmy walks over to answer the door. He opens it and sees Cartman there.]
CARTMAN
Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now.
JIMMY
Who is your best friend?
CARTMAN
You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other.
JIMMY
What's my last name?
CARTMAN
[tries to answer, but can't, so he leaves in a huff] Goddammit! [knocks on another door and Craig answers] Craig, dude, I ran away from home. You're the first person I came to. I knew you'd take me in off the streets.
CRAIG
...But I hate you.
CARTMAN
...Should that really matter at a time like this?
[An alley in downtown South Park, during a rainy moment. Cartman sits next to a trash bin, shielding himself from the rain with some newspaper and some other sheets]
CARTMAN
This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her.
[Cartman's house, later. Liane is at the kitchen making a calligraphic painting. The front door closes and Cartman appears]
CARTMAN
All right, I'm back.
LIANE
Oh Eric, I'm so happy you're home.
CARTMAN
Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here.
LIANE
Look what I did, Eric. I learned how to make Sumie paintings. I had almost forgotten how artistic I was.
CARTMAN
That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat.
LIANE
Cesar...
CESAR
How is the painting going?
CARTMAN
Aw, Goddammit!
CESAR
Oh look, it came back.
LIANE
Yup, just like you said he would.
CARTMAN
What is he still doing here?!
LIANE
He said he's hungry. What should I do?
CESAR
Well, let's feed it.
[An hour or so later, they're seated at the dining room table for dinner]
CARTMAN
What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz!
CESAR
This is more aggressive-dominant behavior. Don't nurture it.
CARTMAN
Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That's it. I'm calling child-protective services! [gets off and walks to the phone]
CESAR
Come on, Ms. Cartman, you must become pack leader. What do you do?
LIANE
Eric, if you don't want to eat then, why don't you go brush your teeth and go to bed?!
CESAR
Nooo, you're asking him a favor. Don't ask a favor, dominate! [they walk up to Cartman, who's ready to dial]
CARTMAN
Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you!
CESAR
You project the dominant energy and he will pick up on it. I promise. Shoulder back, head high, don't reason with it, don't argue with it, just dominate it.
CARTMAN
I am your son, and you will listen to me! You have no right to-
LIANE
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
CARTMAN
Mon, know it off! I'm not gonna stand for th-
LIANE
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. [Cartman drops the receiver and sits on the floor]
CARTMAN
Seriously! Mom-
LIANE
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
CARTMAN
Seriously! Why are you... doing this-?
LIANE
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. [Cartman is flat on his back]
CARTMAN
Mom?!
LIANE
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
CARTMAN
Mom? Mom...
LIANE
[makes sure Cartman is relaxed, then stands up and turns to Cesar] I did it! [smiles. Cartman doesn't move]
[The living room, moments later. Cesar is back on a chair as Liane sits on the sofa]
CESAR
You see? You're calm, assertive, and in control. [Cartman walks by, looking defeated, glances at Cesar, then at his mom, then sits by his mom on the sofa and cuddles up to her, a little warily]
LIANE
Oh... Oh my gosh!
CESAR
See? This is the behavior we've been looking for. This is a relaxed, submissive state.
LIANE
He's never done this before.
CESAR
Good. Now you can reward the behavior with praise and attention.
LIANE
I love you very much, poopsiekins. You're Mommy's sunshine. [Cartman sniffs]
CESAR
Now you can give him a snack. [Liane offers Cartman a chunk of candy, which Cartman laps up like a dog] Good, this is really good. Now try a command.
LIANE
Eric, I want you to go upstairs and brush your teeth. Then I'll be up to read you a story before bed. [Cartman doesn't do anything at first, then he hops off the sofa and heads for his room, head down] Oh my goodness. I can't believe it.
CESAR
This is a great first step, but you're gonna have to stay firm and confident. You are the pack leader now.
LIANE
I am the pack leader! [grins]
CESAR
Now before you go read your son his story let's go enjoy a nice quiet cup of tea.
LIANE
Sounds divine!
[The bathroom. Cartman goes in to brush his teeth.]
CARTMAN
Who does she think she is, telling me to go brush my teeth?! [despite his indignation, he looks compeled to follow orders. He gets up on the stool, gets the toothbrush, turns on the cold water, and gets the toothpaste] Jesus. What's happening to me?
[Café Monet, day. Cesar and Liane wait to be served as a waiter attends other tables al fresco]
CESAR
So, how is your son doing, Ms. Cartman?
LIANE
Oh, he's been amazing, Cesar. He got an A on his last spelling test and a B+ in history. He's losing weight and he's doing what I tell him.
CESAR
That's greeat!
LIANE
The best part is I'm not letting him boss me around anymore. I could have never come out and have a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon with a friend before.
CESAR
Good, Ms. Cartman, sounds like you're treating your son like a son and not like a friend.
LIANE
There's just one problem: he still fights me every step of the way. I feel like he's doing what I tell him, but that inside he's still the same angry spoiled child.
CESAR
Don't worry. When you correct the behavior, eventually you will see a change in the personality.
LIANE
Oh Cesar, I'm so happy to have you in my life. [places her left hand on his right one - closeup shot]
[Kyle's house, later. The boys have gathered there to play video games. Cartman enters, wearing a blue shirt and combed hair. He looks thinner]
CARTMAN
Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom.
BUTTERS
Kill your mom?
CARTMAN
She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes.
STAN
Dude, have you lost more weight?
CARTMAN
Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out.
KYLE
Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool.
CARTMAN
She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?! [rushes away and gets an easel with some schematics on it] All right now, here's the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked. [the plan includes blaming Tolkien for the murder] You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom.
STAN
Dude, we're not killing your mom.
CARTMAN
Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face.
STAN
Where am I supposed to get a gun?
CARTMAN
Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?!
STAN
I'm not shooting anybody.
CARTMAN
Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face.
KYLE
NO, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?! [the boys ignore him. He gets pissed off and walks away with the easel] Fine! I'll do it by myself!
[Cartman's house, night, the master bedroom. Liane is sleeping in her bed. The door cracks open and light enters the room. A silhouette of Cartman and a sharp object rises from the floor. Cartman walks in with a roll of paper towels in his left hand and a large kitchen knife in his right hand. He climbs the bed and stands over her.]
CARTMAN
You forced me to do this! You couldn't just love me as a son. [Liane moves a bit] You just had to humiliate and degrade me with your rules. I won't let you dominate my life anymore! [he moves the knife to a stabbing position] Goodbye, Mother. [about to deliver the fatal stab, he trembles for a few seconds, but his conscience gets a hold of him. Cartman relaxes a bit]
CARTMAN'S CONSCIENCE
Wait. Maybe I don't have the right to kill my mom.
CARTMAN
[shakes it off] No! She's my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It's more important that I live the way I want!
CARTMAN'S GOOD SIDE
She isn't an object you can own. She's a human being.
CARTMAN
She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being.
CARTMAN'S BAD SIDE
No, she's just... out to make you suffer!
CARTMAN
Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes are good for me. Maybe...
CARTMAN'S GOOD SIDE
The world doesn't revolve around me?
CARTMAN
[hops off the bed, dropping the knife and roll of paper as he heads for the door] Maybe the world doesn't revolve around me. [stops and vomits some pretty black stuff. Could be the evil in him]
CARTMAN'S GOOD SIDE
The world doesn't revolve around me!
CARTMAN'S BAD SIDE
Idiot! [Cartman pounds the floor and gets up. For a moment he turns into a snowy screen, then into a red silhouette, snowy screen, back and forth as he fights his sides leaving his mom's room and going to his. At his door he turns into a blob, which is added to the silhouette and screen effects until he passes out in the hallway]
[Morning at the Cartman house. Liane has showered and dressed, and enters the room with the knife and roll of paper towels Cartman left in her room the night before. She's wondering how they got there. She might have asked Cartman how they got into her room, but she's more shocked by what she sees next. Cartman is at the table doing his math homework and eating breakfast at the same time, quietly]
LIANE
Why Eric, you made your own breakfast.
CARTMAN
Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean ham.
LIANE
And you're studying before school?
CARTMAN
Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started.
LIANE
[a tear escapes her left eye] Oh, Eric. I'm very proud of you.
CARTMAN
Tha... thank you?
LIANE
I love you, sweetie.
CARTMAN
'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez. [the doorbell rings and Liane goes to answer the door]
LIANE
Cesar. I'm so happy you're back.
CESAR
How is the child doing?
LIANE
Oh, he's amazing. I think the change in personality happened. He's doing things for himself now, and he seems to be accepting it. I've lost a best friend, but I've gained a son.
CESAR
That's much healthier for him, and when he gets older he'll be able to be your friend too.
LIANE
You're the best, Cesar, and to show my gratitude I've got two tickets for you and me to see Madame Butterfly this Friday night.
CESAR
Well no, my work is done. I've got to get back to Los Angeles.
LIANE
Oh... But I thought we were becoming friends.
CESAR
No, not really. You're just a client. Well, good luck to you. Gotta go. [turns around and walks away. Cartman shows up soon after]
CARTMAN
I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now. [waits a bit, then turns to go to his room. Liane turns around]
LIANE
Eric, how would you like to go with me to see Madame Butterfly Friday night?
CARTMAN
No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then.
LIANE
Well, what if I took you to Kentucky Fried Chicken afterward? [Cartman blinks, Liane genuflects] And then we'll go to Target and buy you a Mega Ranger.
CARTMAN
Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?
LIANE
[hugs him] Yes, darling. You can have whatever you want. [A beatific smile appears on Cartman's face as foreboding music plays.]

synopsis:There's trouble in the online gaming world when a mad gamer won't play by the rules. The boys dedicate their lives to defeating the renegade and saving the World of Warcraft.

script:Make Love, Not Warcraft

[Scenes from the World of Warcraft are shown. Various beings mill around. The camera pans down and a red-bearded dwarf walks into view.]
CARTMAN
[as the dwarf, with mallet] Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys?
KYLE
[voice only] We're over here, by the cart. [POV switches to three other characters - a blue knight, a green lady, and an orange knight stand around waiting for the dwarf. The dwarf walks into the group]
CARTMAN
Okay, I'm back.
STAN
[the blue knight, with sword and shield] Dude! We've been waiting forever!
CARTMAN
Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!
KYLE
[the green lady with big breasts] If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass!
CARTMAN
Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl!
KENNY
[orange knight] [mumbles, then] (I think Kyle has sweet titties, hahahaha)
CARTMAN
Heheh, totally, heheh.
KYLE
Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven. [walks off, and the others follow]
RANDY
[voice only] Stan? [Stan stops] Stan?
STAN
H-hang on, guys, my dad wants something.
RANDY
Stan!
[Randy's den. Stan removes his headset and furiously glares at Randy.]
STAN
What?!
RANDY
[displeased] You've been on your computer all weekend. Shouldn't you go out and socialize with your friends?
STAN
[swivels around to face his dad] I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak.
RANDY
[stares, then gets dejected] ...I'm not a r-tard. [turns and leaves. Stan returns to his game]
[World of Warcraft, the land of Azeroth.]
STAN
All right, sorry guys. So where to now?
KYLE
See where I am? It's this way. [Stan joins the group. Kyle's character turns around, realizes its mistake, and jumps back around]
CARTMAN
Yeah, come on, let's go! [the four now walk abreast] I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth!
KYLE
Wow, look at all these people playing right now.
CARTMAN
Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half of these people are Koreans.
STAN
[stops and motions] Oh crap! It's that guy again! [a player approaches them and begins to dance. The character is wearing a helmet, boots, elbow-length gloves, and tight shorts. No shirt, no other armor]
KYLE
Who is this?
STAN
This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!
CARTMAN
Get out of here, asshole!
STAN
He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair.
KYLE
It's all right. He can't kill us unless we agree to duel. [the ganker jabs at Kenny, who immediately dies.]
STAN
Oh my God, he killed Kenny!
KYLE
[in a soft feminine voice, makes a fist and holds it up for emphasis] You bastard! [the ganker stabs Kyle and then Stan, who both drop and die]
CARTMAN
Don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?! [the ganker begins generating power] No! I don't want them to start over at the graveyard! [the ganker shoots a fireball at Cartman] No! [the fireball hits and Cartman falls face down and dies.]
[Cartman's room. Cartman looks stunned, then throws down his headset]
CARTMAN
That son of a bitch!
[Gerald's den.]
KYLE
Who is that guy?
[Randy's den.]
STAN
[head resting on left hand] Whoever he is, he is one tough badass.
[The rogue's apartment. The rogue is actually an obese man who's taken to leaning back and playing WoW. Empty soda cans and candy wrappers litter his pad. A red glow emanates from his computer through a clear side panel. He continues playing while adjusting his glasses]
[Blizzard Gaming Entertainment, day, exterior. Lovely architecture.]
[Blizzard Gaming Entertainment, interior. A pool of telephone representatives fields incoming calls.]
REP
[female] World of Warcraft support line.
STAN
Yeah, we bought your game, and played it online, but every time we log in, some other player comes in and kills us!
REP
O..ohhh that shouldn't happen. We designed the game so that players have to agree to a duel before they can kill each other.
STAN
Yeah? Well this guy does it anyway!
CARTMAN
He's a God damned butthole!
REP
Really? That's odd. [her co-worker approaches. She muffles the mic to talk to him] More people calling in about their characters getting killed. [removes her hand]
CO-WORKER
Oh no.
REP
Well, we'll certainly keep a look out for that player and ban him from the network. [She muffles the mic] Better tell the guys upstairs.
[Blizzard Gaming Entertainment, executive boardroom.]
PRESIDENT
Fellow board members, we have a problem: somebody in the World of Warcraft is ignoring the World's rules...and is going around killing innocent players..
MEMBER 1
Why kill innocent players? The game is about finishing quests.
MEMBER 2
We've got to delete him from the servers.
PRESIDENT
We can't. Whoever this player is, he has played World of Warcraft so much, that he has reached a level we thought unreachable. He's actually able to kill our admins. And he grows stronger every day.
MEMBER 3
Jesus...
JIM
[rises from his chair] I've gotta get home! My kids are playing World of Warcraft right now!
PRESIDENT
Jim, your kids' characters are already dead.
JIM
No... [sinks back into his seat] No... [frustrated] They just started playing!
MEMBER 2
What kind of person would do this?
PRESIDENT
[walks back to the end of the table, by the doors] Only one kind. Whoever this player is, he has played World of Warcraft nearly every hour of every day for the past year and a half. Gentlemen, we are dealing with someone here who...has absolutely no life.
MEMBER 3
How do you kill...that which has no life? [the question hangs there for a long time...]
[USGS. Randy is working in a much better environment now - much more modern office, with several LCD screens around. Randy is online]
NELSON
[walks into view] Randy, you workin' on that sediment analysis?
RANDY
Not now, Nelson. I just joined a big party of night elves and we're gonna explore the Tower of Azora together.
NELSON
[walks up to Randy's desk] Is that a computer game?
RANDY
No, r-tard, it's an MMORPG. These are real people I'm playing with. See, I'm a hunter, level 2. [he moves his blond character around] I can chat with all these other people. I can even wave to this guy, see? [demonstrates.] "Hello." [the character waves back] In the outside world, I'm a simple geologist, but in here...I am Falcorn, Defender of the Alliance. I've braved the Fargodeep mine and defeated the Bloodfish at Jarod's Landing. [the griefer returns and stabs Falcorn in the back, killing him, then walks away]
NELSON
Hm. Looks like that guy just killed you. [turns around and walks away]
RANDY
What?? Why?? Why?!
[Cartman's basement. Most of the boys in class are seated in chairs, listening to Cartman. In the back row are Tweek, Jimmy, Kevin, and Jason. In the middle row are Clyde, Tolkien, Butters, and Timmy. In the front row are Craig, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.]
CARTMAN
My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters.
KYLE
The past...four nights we've tried to play, he shows up and kills us!
CRAIG
He killed my character right in the middle of a quest!
TWEEK
Mine too!
CARTMAN
We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance.
TOLKIEN
Hey yeah!
JIMMY
We can really stick it to that assm-m-muncher!
CLYDE
Are you guys dumb? We can't beat him, even with all of us. It's a waste of time.
STAN
Dude, we have to try.
CLYDE
I've got better things to do.
CARTMAN
Clyde, Clyde! [moves around his podium to talk to Clyde more directly] If you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it? [beat] I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but you would, right?
CLYDE
[unshaken] I'm just gonna stop playing.
CARTMAN
When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde?
CLYDE
No.
CARTMAN
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde? (Would you like to sleep with me, Clyde?)
CLYDE
All right all right, I'll do it!
JIMMY
So what's the p-plan?
CARTMAN
All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30. [walks up to a map of their quest] We will meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to victory!
ALL
To victory!
BUTTERS
I don't play World of Warcraft.
CARTMAN
Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time!
BUTTERS
Yeah, but I'm playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
CARTMAN
Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you.
BUTTERS
O-oh, o-oh, a-alright. All right then.
[World of Warcraft, near Westfall. The camera looks upon a meadow, then pans down to show a group of characters. Cartman is marshaling his forces.]
CARTMAN
All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect buff.
TOLKIEN
[playing a black warrior] Okay.
CRAIG
Got it.
CARTMAN
The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards.
JIMMY
All right, Eric. You can c-c-count on us.
TIMMY
Timmy!
CARTMAN
This shall be a day for all to remember! Let us bravely charge the fields of Azeroth! [another dwarf walks in looking just like Cartman's dwarf] From with-
BUTTERS
Hey fellas! [Cartman's dwarf looks over] Boy, this is neato, huh?
CARTMAN
Butters? What the hell are you doing?
BUTTERS
I got World of Warcraft, like you said.
CARTMAN
You can't be the dwarf character, Butters, I'm the dwarf.
BUTTERS
Well, there's only like four races to choose from-
CARTMAN
So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in!
BUTTERS
[walks off grumbling] I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure a lot more 'n this stuff.
STAN
Come on, let's do this!
JASON
Yeah, my mom says I have to be in bed at 9:30.
CARTMAN
[turns around and leads] Then let's move out! [the others charge after him]
[A field. The ganker walks along his merry way, but with one armswing he slaughters other players nearby with an energy blast. It's a very effective move.]
STAN
Look! There he is!
CARTMAN
Everyone hold! [everyone stops in their tracks. The ganker turns around and faces them.]
KYLE
He's targeting us.
CARTMAN
Prepare to charge! Scroll over him with your mouse cursors! And...Right-click! [that sends the group charging at the ganker, who responds by summoning an army of giant scorpions] What the? Oh Jesus, he summoned scorpions! [the actual rogue player is shown in his apartment, leaning back on his chair and playing without needing to think very much about what to do next. His character and scorpions decimate the group]
TWEEK
Aaaa! [his character runs all over the place, with no one offering to smother him and put out the flames] I'm burning! Oh Jesus I'm burning! [a scorpion kills Kenny's character nearby]
JIMMY
Kenny's down. K-k-kenny is down. [Tweek is still burning, running around]
IKE
[purple mage] I'm gonna poop on my pants.
KYLE
Ike, look out! [the ganker rushes in and stabs him in the back]
IKE
Aah Kyle! [Ike is out of the game. Stan runs through a group of scorpions]
CARTMAN
All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow! [Clyde's character looks like he's about to aim a crossbow] Hit him now, Clyde! Clyde? Clyde! [Clyde is at his computer, but not participating in the game. He's looking at Playboy centerfolds.] Clyde! Clyde, you asshole! [rushes to join the others] Goddammit we lost Clyde!
[Nearby, Stan is fending off scorpions, and the blond hunter walks up.]
RANDY
Hey, Stan, can I play with you guys? [Stan's character turns around]
STAN
Dad??
RANDY
Yeah, I'm playing from the office.
STAN
Dad, get off our teamspeak line!
TOLKIEN
[the ganker kills him] That's it, I'm dead!
STAN
[the ganker kills him. He throws off his headset again] That's it, screw this game!
CARTMAN
No, leave me alone, don't do- [the ganker stabs Cartman with his dagger through the mallet] god, dugh [Cartman dies, and the ganker skips away. Cartman furiously screams into his mic, then throws down his headset] God-fucking-dammit!!! [meanwhile, in his apartment, the ganker just keeps plugging along.]
[The Blizzard boardroom.]
MEMBER 3
Oh Jesus...Oh God no...
PRESIDENT
What?
MEMBER 3
He just finished killing every single player in the Arathi Highlands.
MEMBER 1
How many people's characters were in there?
MEMBER 2
Over five thousand. [some of the members sit down. Member 1 rises]
MEMBER 1
There are over seven million people who log on to World of Warcraft! Are you telling me all those people's characters are going to die, and there's nothing we can do to save them?
PRESIDENT
Yes. And it won't be long before everyone gets really really frustrated and stops playing altogether. Gentlemen, this could very well lead to the end of the World...of Warcraft.
MEMBER 5
[grabs his head] No! Nooooooooo!
[The neighborhood park. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are playing basketball. Cartman enters the park.]
CARTMAN
What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?!
STAN
Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time.
CARTMAN
Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft.
KYLE
We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times.
CARTMAN
I have a solution, you guys. That guy can kill us so easily because he's a super-high level, right? What if we were super-high level too?
STAN
We can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests!
CARTMAN
That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars.
KYLE
Boars?
CARTMAN
There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow.
KYLE
Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels?
CARTMAN
Yes. [whips out a sheet full of calculations] Sixty-five million three hundred and forty thousand two hundred and eighty five. Which should take us seven weeks five days thirteen hours and twenty minutes, giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep. What do you say, guys? You can just...you can just hang outside in the sun all day tossin' a ball around, [firmly] or you can sit at your computer and do somethin' that matters.
[World of Warcraft. "Live to Win" by Paul Stanley begins to play. The four friends are back in the forest looking for boars. They slaughter the boars as they come upon the groups of them. Cartman chugs down energy drinks and has doughnuts and other sweets around his keyboard. He wipes his mouth dry with his jacket sleeve. In the McCormick living room Kenny plays while his parents argue in the background. In Gerald's den, Ike nourishes Kyle on the fly. The days fly by, starting at September 3...During recess and lunch, as the other kids play outside as usual, the boys are at computers at the school's computer lab playing WoW. As Tweek, Craig, Clyde, Kevin, and Tolkien play football in the street outside, Stan plays WoW in his room. Day passes into night and back into day...]
PAUL STANLEY
Live to win, 'till you die, 'till the light dies in your eyes!
Live to win, take it all, just keep fighting till you fall!
Day by day, kickin' all the way, I'm not cavin' in
Let another round begin, live to win
Yeah! [...and back into night...Stan's first pimples appear and his face is fatter.]
Live! [More pimples appear, and his hair begins to look matted]
Yeah!
Win! [He's gotten fatter than Cartman normally is, to the point where he's too fat to wear his jacket anymore]
[The Blizzard boardroom. Executives are monitoring the gameplay.]
MEMBER 3
Sir, you'd better have a look at this! Four of our subscribers...They've gone up fifty levels in three weeks.
PRESIDENT
My God...they must have no lives at all.
MEMBER 3
A hope?
PRESIDENT
A chance.
PAUL STANLEY
Live to win, 'till you die, 'till the light dies in your eyes
Live to win, take it all, just keep fighting 'till you fall
Day by day, kickin' all the way, I'm not cavin' in
Let another round begin, live to win
Live to win
Live to win
Yeah, win.
[Kyle's room, 6:30 a.m. He rises from bed, which means he went to bed at 3:30 a.m. He's gotten as big and pimply as Stan. He hops out of bed, heads for his father's den and then to the computer and logs into the game to slaughter more boars.]
KYLE
Dude, my mouse-clicking finger hurts.
CARTMAN
Keep clicking, Kyle! You can do it!
[Kenny's playing from the living room. Stan is at his dad's computer now, and Randy looks in on him. Stan earns an xp of 142. Cartman has gotten so big he looks like Jabba the Hutt. His fingers are shown up close typing away. Kyle flexes his right wrist and fingers to get circulation back in them, them resumes playing the game. More boar slaughter ensues. Next, Cartman is shown on the toilet crapping away and reading the World of Warcraft game manual. Stan's left hand is shown typing away. Kenny's still at it, but he's not as big as Stan is now. Stan looks like a huge baby...with pimples. Back at school, the boys are back in the computer lab playing away. As the music ends, Cartman raises his fist seemingly in victory]
[The Blizzard boardroom, night. The president looks out over the city from the boardroom. He stands at a table in front of the window, on which stand some WoW statuettes.]
PRESIDENT
The admins tell us they are four players from a small town in Colorado.
MEMBER 1
Are they strong enough to defeat the Evil One?
MEMBER 5
[wearing a black T-shirt with the green words "Dwarf Needs FOOD!" on it] We ran the numbers: even with their amazing rise in levels, they have a 90% mortality probability. They'd be walking in a slaughter!
MEMBER 1
There has to be...someway we can help them.
MEMBER 6
What about...the Sword of a Thousand Truths?
MEMBER 7
Quiet, Thomas! We aren't even to speak of that sword!
THOMAS
But maybe these new players are the ones the prophecy foretold of.
MEMBER 7
It is not an option!
MEMBER 1
What is this sword?
MEMBER 7
Long ago, when the World of Warcraft was created, one of the programmers put a sword called the Sword of a Thousand Truths into the game inventory.
PRESIDENT
Apparently it could cause 120 damage per second, with an instant mana burn and an enchantment that boosts its stamina +80.
MEMBER 7
But the sword was considered to be too powerful for anyone to possess. So it was removed from the game and stored on a one-gig flash drive.
THOMAS
But it was foretold that one day, players who could wield the sword might reveal themselves.
MEMBER 1
Who foretold this prophecy?
PRESIDENT
Soltzman. He's an accountant.
[The accountants' room, night. The executives open the door and walk in slowly, softly. Member 1 opens the top drawer and pulls out a small safe, gets the key and opens it. The President reaches in side and pulls out the small flash drive.]
PRESIDENT
Behold, the Sword of a Thousand Truths. [the flash drive gets its close-up] We must get this sword to the ones who have proven they have no life. Let's just hope to Christ they don't start the battle before we can reach them.
[Cartman's basement, night. The boys have taken their computers and assembled them in the basement. They are all now connected and online.]
CARTMAN
All right, you guys. The Moment of Truth is here. It is time for our final battle. Everyone, log in!
STAN
I'm in.
KYLE
Me too.
KENNY
(Me too.)
CARTMAN
[begins to slur his speech ever so slightly, giving it a blasé feel] Everyone equip healing potions to the hotbar if you haven't already. Uh, Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance to raise our intelligence.
KYLE
Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range.
CARTMAN
Nice. Stan, what enchantment does your Cloak of the Tiger have?
STAN
+15 agility.
CARTMAN
Give the cloak to Kenny, he needs the agility boost for bow attacks.
STAN
'K.
KYLE
Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food?
CARTMAN
Don't worry, I have that covered. [pressed a button on a small intercom on his desk] Mom?
LIANE
Yes hon?
CARTMAN
More Hot Pockets!
LIANE
[answering at the other end] Right away, hon. [Cartman turns it off]
STAN
That's übercool.
CARTMAN
All right, everyone ready?
KYLE/STAN
Ready.
CARTMAN
Let's go get him! [the battle begins. The rogue is playing with the right hand, eating a cookie with the left.]
STAN
Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire.
CARTMAN
Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan.
KYLE
What's the autolocate macro?
CARTMAN
Command-0. [sniffs]
KYLE
Okay, right behind Stan.
CARTMAN
Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use intimidating shout.
STAN
Okay, he sees us...He's targeted us.
CARTMAN
Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle.
KYLE
Casting...there's an 8-second cast time.
CARTMAN
Aren't you spec'd to reduce cast time?
KYLE
No, ah, I'm an arcane fire mage.
CARTMAN
Christ...
KYLE
Cast on him again.
CARTMAN
Everyone target scorpions.
[World of Warcraft, final battle. The four boys are attacking the ganker, who's just defending himself right now, mostly attacking Kenny. Seventeen hours later...the rogue is sitting up, signifying that he's paying attention now that the boys have battled him this long without dying. Meanwhile, the President of Blizzard and Member 1 arrive at Stan's house. Member 1 bangs on the door. The door opens]
RANDY
Yes?
MEMBER 1
We are looking for a great knight by the name of LovesToSpooge.
RANDY
That's my son's character's name in Warcraft.
PRESIDENT
Where is he?!
RANDY
Who are you?
PRESIDENT
Sir, we don't have time! We just heard from our admins that your son's party is already in battle!
MEMBER 1
Unless they have this sword, [pulls out the flash drive] your son's character is going to die!
RANDY
[close-up, Randy's eyes widen] Nn-Oh my God! [drops his coffee cup and runs upstairs. The two other men look at each other and follow]
[Back in the World of Warcraft the battle continues.]
CARTMAN
Kyle! Fire spell!
KYLE
Aaaa... [starts generating the spell, but it abruptly goes out] AH! Huh?! [his character grabs her right wrist with her left hand]
STAN
Kyle! [Kyle leaves his desk grabbing onto his right hand, then flexes his right wrist around. Stan leaves his desk and approaches him] Kyle! Dude, what's wrong?
KYLE
Carpal tunnel! Carpal tunnel! It's aaaah! [pain shoots through his wrist as he continues flexing his wrist and stretching his fingers]
STAN
Oh, Jesus, he's got it bad! [Cartman walks over]
CARTMAN
Wait, we need Ben-Gay. [waddles to Kenny's desk desk and pulls out a tube of the stuff, then walks back and squirts some of it onto Kyle's right wrist, then rubs it in.]
STAN
Hurry dude!
CARTMAN
I'm going as fast as I can!
STAN
Kyle, you have to keep playing.
KYLE
I can't. Just leave me behind.
STAN
We can't do this without you now! Come on! [he and Cartman help Kyle back to his computer]
[Stan's room. The computer is missing. Randy and the two executives run in]
RANDY
Stan?! Stan! [turns around and sees Sharon walk by with the laundry] Sharon, where is Stan?!
SHARON
I don't know. He took his computer somewhere to play that stupid online game.
MEMBER 1
Stupid?
RANDY
Where?!
SHARON
I don't know.
RANDY
Sharon, his character is going to die if we don't get to him!
SHARON
So what?
THE THREE MEN
So what?! [Sharon rolls her eyes and walks away]
PRESIDENT
We're too late. Without the sword the players will fail.
MEMBER 1
I-if we could get to a computer, we could sign on to the World of Warcraft and give the boys the sword online.
PRESIDENT
I don't have a World of Warcraft account. Do you?
MEMBER 1
No, I have a life. [the men fall silent]
RANDY
Give me the sword.
MEMBER 1
You?
RANDY
I have a Warcraft character. I'm a newb, but I can log on and get the sword to Stan online.
MEMBER 1
We can't trust the Sword of a Thousand Truths to a newb!
RANDY
Sounds to me like we don't have a choice! Give me the sword. [Member 1 kneels and reverently gives the USB drive to Randy. Randy holds it above his head like an actual sword] Ahhhh. Come on, we've got to get to a computer that works! [runs out of the house with the other two men behind him]
[Outside, night, snowing.]
RANDY
Where's your car?
MEMBER 1
We took a cab here!
RANDY
Dammit, mine's in the shop! [runs out into the street] Uh hey! Eh help! Stop! [a car slows down] Please, it's an emergency! [the driver opens his door, Randy yanks him out and knocks him out with one punch. Randy and the other two men get in the car and speed away. The driver comes to and looks on. Randy is now on his cell phone] Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over and use your computer! No, I d-I need to play World of Warcraft! NELSON!
[The rogue's apartment, day. He's eating tortilla chips. Part of one falls onto his shirt. He looks at it and scoots it off, then goes back to playing without missing a beat.]
[Cartman's basement. The boys haven't missed a beat either.]
CARTMAN
All right, major stone shield potions should be...Oh God, I'm going to have diarrhea again. Ohhh...Duuuh...
STAN
You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor!
CARTMAN
It's okay. [clicks on the intercom] Mom? Bathroom!
LIANE
What hon?
CARTMAN
Bathroom! Bathroom! [clicks off. A second later Liane goes into the basement with a bedpan. Cartman senses this and lowers his pants as Liane positions the bedpan in place. Cartman lets go and a log comes out first, followed by a spattering stream of crap. Some of it ends up on the floor, some of it on Liane's blouse. Nasty.]
LIANE
Oohh, that's a big boy, isn't he? [walks away with the poop. Cartman lifts his pants back in place without cleaning his ass]
CARTMAN
All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow.
[The road, night. Randy hangs up and rests his cell phone when he notices a Best Buy off to his left. He pulls into the parking lot and runs into the store. He grabs a greeter.]
RANDY
World of Warcraft! I need to play!
GREETER
Our demo is set up right over by the- [Randy runs to the demo. A small boy is playing the game. Randy shoves him off and logs him out.]
RANDY
Got to...sign in...character name...All right, I'm in! [puts on the headset]
[Cartman's basement.]
STAN
Dude, I'm almost dead.
CARTMAN
Kyle, cast arcane missiles!
KYLE
I'm out of mana, I told you.
[Within the game.]
STAN
[his character leaves the battle] I've gotta heal. [his character turns to see the battle]
RANDY
Staaan! [Stan's character looks around trying to determine where the voice is coming from, then turns around]
STAN
Dad? Not now!
RANDY
Stan! I've been sent here...to bring you this. [holds the Sword of a Thousand Truths aloft] This sword can completely drain his mana.
STAN
Dad, how did you get that?!
RANDY
No time! Just take it! Here! [the sword stays fixed to his left hand] ...How, how do you hand something from one player to another?
STAN
Bring up your inventory screen: Control-I...
RANDY
Okay. [The ganker notices the lull in action and faces Stan. Cartman is alarmed and spins around to look at Stan.]
CARTMAN
Stan, what the hell are you doing?! [the ganker runs and leaps toward Stan and Randy]
STAN
I got it! [the ganker stabs Randy and Randy goes down]
RANDY
Augh!
STAN
Dad!
RANDY
Stan... [falls down face first]
STAN
Dad, no! [turns around to face the ganker] You killed my father. [walks up to the ganker and strikes him with one blow of the sword. The ganker's defenses start to crack.]
CARTMAN
His shield and armor spells are down!
KYLE
Attack! [Kenny quickly takes his bow and arrow and fires an arrow into the ganker's chest. Kyle fires an energy ball at the ganker. The energy ball knocks the knife from the ganker's hand and disables him some more. He falls to the ground on all fours, and the dwarf approaches him, ready to smash the ganker's head in with the mallet]
CARTMAN
Looks like you're about to get pwned. [swings back and then pulls the mallet forward] Heeyeah! [the mallet smashed the ganker's head into little bloody pieces.]
[The rogue's apartment. The rogue sits at his desk as usual, but now his mouth is slightly open in astonishment. Random noises follow, and his game is through.]
[Within the game, Stan throws away the Sword of a Thousand Truths and rushes up to his father's dying character. He shakes the character around a bit]
STAN
Dad? Dad?
RANDY
[answers] Staaan. [falters a bit, but Stan holds him up] I've never been able to say this before, but...I love you, son.
STAN
I know you do, Dad.
RANDY
[swats Stan's hand away] Augh! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...
[Cuts to Randy continuing the melodrama at the demo desk in Best Buy.]
MEMBER 1
They did it!
PRESIDENT
Our world is saved! [Randy smiles]
[Within the game. The boys' characters gather around the fallen ganker. Other characters appear and gather around the group]
MAN 1
They did it! They killed him! [leaves his hiding place. Others follow]
MAN 2
They did it!
WOMAN
They killed him! We can come out!
CARTMAN
Yes!
STAN
We did it!
CARTMAN
Yeah!
[Cartman's basement.]
STAN
Yeah.
KYLE
Yeah yeah.
CARTMAN
All right, yay.
KENNY
(Woohoo! Oh man!)
CARTMAN
We did it you guys. We're totally heroes.
KYLE
That was such über pwnage
STAN
I can't believe it's all over. What do we do now?
CARTMAN
What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.
KYLE
Oh yeah.
CARTMAN
Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar. Stan, check your fury talents to boost your shots.
STAN
Got it.
End of Make Love, Not Warcraft

synopsis:The world's biggest conspiracy of all time is finally uncovered when Eric Cartman exposes the true culprit behind the September 11th attacks.

script:Mystery of the Urinal Deuce

[South Park Elementary, Fourth Grade classroom, day. Mrs. Garrison launches into her lesson]
MRS. GARRISON
And so, class, that is when Joe Lee countered back to Aniston and said things like- [the door opens and Mr. Mackey enters the classroom, looking quite pissed. Mr. Mackey walks by Mrs. Garrison without saying a word] Oh hello, Mr. Mackey.
MR. MACKEY
[faces the class] All the girls go out in the hall please? I need to speak with the boys of this class, m'kay? [the girls leave their seats and go into the hall] Boys, we have a very serious problem! I've just come from the men's restroom, and somebody went number 2 in the urinal! [Mrs. Garrison's jaw drops at the behavior, then she gets concerned. The boys just blink at Mr. Mackey]
BUTTERS
What's a urinal?
STAN
A wall toilet for peeing in.
MR. MACKEY
And some jokester took a poop in it! Okay? Now I want whoever did it to come forward right now, and it will be less painful for everybody! M'kay?!
JIMMY
Who would take a d-dump in a urinal? It's such a s-senseless crime.
CARTMAN
Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11.
KYLE
Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!
CARTMAN
Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle?
MR. MACKEY
Excuse me!! Could we get back to the issue, please?! You all don't seem to understand how serious this is!! Now who made dookie in the urinal?! [the boys just laugh] Oh, you think it's funny, huh?! M'kay! M'kay! You're gonna think it's real funny when the police get here!
[Men's- er, Boys' Room, later. The police are in there with Mr. Mackey. Police tape has been placed around the urinal]
OFFICER 1
I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, but there just isn't really any evidence to go on.
MR. MACKEY
But there must have been some motive. Nobody would just dook in the urinal for no reason.
OFFICER 1
But who would benefit from crapping in the urinal? Uh this is too big a mystery for me. I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys.
[A montage of the Hardly Boys follows. The following titles appear: The Secret of the Lost Tunnel, The Hooded Hawk Mystery, The Clue of the Broken Blade, The Mystery of the Spiral Bridge...]
NARRATOR
The Hardly Boys. Two young whippersnappers with a knack for solving mysteries. The Hardly Boys in: [the cover of book 37 is shown] The Mystery of the Urinal Turd.
[The Hardly Boys are now with the police officer in front of the boys' room. Mr. Mackey observes nearby. The Boys have screwed-up smiles, suggesting buck teeth]
OFFICER 1
So, that's it, Hardly Boys, we've got no leads and nobody admitting to the crime.
FRANK
That sure is a mystery.
JOE
Yeah, it sounds super-hard.
FRANK
Whoever did it must have been angry with the school. Oh... Oooo... I think I'm getting a clue.
JOE
F-really?
FRANK
Yeah, this is totally giving me a clue right now.
JOE
[turns to Frank] Oh... I'm starting to get a clue too.
FRANK
My clue is kind of pointing this way.
JOE
[moves to his left, to where Frank's clue is pointing] Ohhgh. Yeah, now I've got a total clue.
FRANK
I've still got a raging clue.
JOE
[turns right] My clue's pointing over there now!
FRANK
Oh, let's follow that clue! [move off to the right and away from the boys' room.]
[The school bell rings and the kids pour out into the hall]
STAN
Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?
KYLE
Not yet.
CARTMAN
They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again.
KYLE
Will you shut up about 9/11!
CARTMAN
Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!
KYLE
Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard!
CARTMAN
Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards?
KYLE
Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards.
STAN
Yeah, at least one-fourth.
KYLE
Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth.
CARTMAN
...There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters! [sees Butters walking towards the group]
BUTTERS
Hey, fellas!
CARTMAN
Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup?
BUTTERS
Well, I heard that 9/11 was caused by President Bush.
CARTMAN
Aha! Do you see?
KYLE
Where did you hear that?
BUTTERS
[points] From Eric.
CARTMAN
I rest my case.
KYLE
[walks up and stands next to Butters] Butters, you don't really believe that, do you?
BUTTERS
Well, l-uh, I mean, uh, you never know. Uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. The government and the corporations headed by the Jews that tear down 9/11.
CARTMAN
That's right, Butters.
KYLE
Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass?
CARTMAN
What? People see the truth?
BUTTERS
Can I go now?
CARTMAN
You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media! [begins to move away from the boys] I'm gonna go find out the truth. I'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all! [goes around a corner and disappears]
KYLE
[rolls his eyes] Oh no...
[Montage. Cartman exits the school as the camera is in a position to watch him pass under the U.S. Flag. Next, he scours the Web for information on 9/11. He looks at the sites with a critical eye. Next, he goes to the library to find more in-depth information. Among the books Cartman is reading are "Security Tyrrany" and "How the Towers Fell." He goes up on a hill and sees the whole town laid out before him. He returns to the boys' room and analyzes the urinal. He makes himself some tea and watches a video on his computer that stops right before the second plane hits and presents a big red question mark. He's making notes on something while sitting in the armchair... it turns out to be a picture of the urinal with the deuce still in it.]
CARTMAN
It is wrong for me to ask questions?
Is it wrong to seek the truth?
I just can't blindly accept their version.
I can't base my logic on proof.
Almost all the evidence points one way,
But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:
I need to know what really happened
On 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.
What really happened
On 9/11?[He's back at his computer once more and clicks on his mouse]Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before?
[Next day, Mrs. Garrison's class is again in session. It's Show and Tell day. Leroy walks up to the front of the class and presents his topic.]
LEROY
This is my frog. He doesn't have a name. He's a frog not a toad because toads don't ribbit. I think frogs are good pets. [he gets a smattering of applause from the other kids, then goes back to his seat]
MRS. GARRISON
Okay, thank you, Leroy, thanks for sharing your dumb little frog with the class. Okay, anybody else have anything for Show and Tell?
CARTMAN
[raises and waves his hand] Uh! Erh, eh. Uhhh!
MRS. GARRISON
All right, Eric, you can go next.
CARTMAN
[leaves his seat and goes to the front of the class with his laptop.] For Show and Tell today I have brought... [puts on some glasses] ...my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth!.. [removes the glasses for dramatic effect] behind the 9/11 attacks! [the lights go out and a projector is turned on]
KYLE
[rolls his eyes] Oh Christ...
CARTMAN
[his first image is that of the Twin Towers] We are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers, [the image gets animated as a cross-section of a wall is picked apart and the steel girders shown, which led to their collapse.] which led to their collapse. But did you know jet fuel doesn't burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel? [the other kids look at each other. Kyle's eyes are half-closed, showing his disinterest] We were told the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well, [a picture of the Pentagon with the damage clearly visible. A helicopter hovers nearby] but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane?
CLYDE
Whoa...
CARTMAN
So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did? [he begins to use his fingers to show the numbers as he says them] Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. [click. Kyle now appears superimposed on the 9/11 picture already onscreen]. Kyle!
KYLE
Me??!
CARTMAN
Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2! [clicks, and another shot of the Twin Towers is shown] When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur, [he zooms in on the picture, which just becomes pixilated] but when I computer-enhanced it, [the pixilation disappears as the picture sharpens - it's a drawing of an evil Kyle with a large, sharp knife in his right hand] You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.
[The bell rings again and the kids once again enter the hall. The camera looks towards the front doors. Kyle walks toward the camera and scratches his nose.]
KYLE
Hey Tolkien. [Tolkien does not respond, but just watches him walk by. Kyle stops by Butters and Craig] You-you gonna watch the game tonight, Butters? [Butters is suddenly scared]
BUTTERS
Waaaah! [drops his book and runs away. The other kids just stare at Kyle]
KYLE
All right, all right, I was not responsible for 9/11! [the other kids move away quickly] God-damnit!
[Kyle's house, after school. Kyle walks in through the front door, upset. He slams the door shut behind him. Sheila is cleaning the coffee table in front of the couch]
SHEILA
Hello bubbe, how was school today?
KYLE
[stops in front of Sheila, to her left] Terrible.
SHEILA
Oh, come on, school isn't all that bad.
KYLE
But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9/11.
SHEILA
Whatwhatwhaaat?!
[A PTA meeting, later]
SHEILA
We have to do something! It is obvious our children are still completely confused about 9/11!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Yes, we need to go over it again in the classroom so they understand what really happened.
SKEETER
Well, what really happened? There's strong evidence that what we were told isn't the truth.
OTHER MEN
Oh no, oh brother, oh God.
MR. ADLER
[stands up] That's right. Did you know that there were explosions seen at the base of the towers?
OTHER MEN
Oh no, oh God, that's so retarded.
MR. MACKEY
[stands up] Look, what-ever you believe, the fact of the matter is somebody... dropped a dookie in the school urinal, and there's still no explanation for that!
SHEILA
Mr. Mackey, there are more important things going on here!
MR. MACKEY
More important?! You aren't the one, who had to walk into the boys' bathroom, okay, after having tuh, to wake up early, you know, there's no, no coffee in the teachers' lounge, and then you, you walk into the bathroom just to find a big dook laying there in the urinal! Like it's laughin' at you!
JIMBO
He's right! The turd could have been put there to cover up 9/11!
MR. MACKEY
No, I'm not saying they're related!
RANDY
[rises] How do we know they're not? We need to be brave enough to ask questions! [makes a fist]
SKEETER
It's obvious that before we go any further, we need to find out who was behind 9/11 once and for all!
RICHARD
Who else could it have been?
DET. YATES
This is too big a mystery for me. I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys.
MR. MACKEY
Oh no, not the Goddamned-
[A montage of the Hardly Boys follows. The same music and montage as before are played]
NARRATOR
The Hardly Boys. Two young whippersnappers with a knack for solving mysteries. The Hardly Boys in: [the cover of a new book is shown] The Case of the World Trade Center Conspiracy.
[Police headquarters. Det. Yates has a post-9/11 picture with a circled question mark where the towers used to be.]
DET. YATES
So that's about the long and short of it, Hardly Boys. There were two towers that stood right here, [shows off the question mark] and they're gone.
FRANK
And nobody knows who's responsible?
DET. YATES
There are theories, but, nobody's certain.
JOE
Nnnn, who would benefit most from two buildings disappearing?
FRANK
Ooo... oh, I just started getting a clue.
JOE
Really?
FRANK
Yeah, I'm totally getting a clue.
JOE
Oh... Oh, that's giving me a clue. Yeah, ye-yeah, I've got a raging clue right now.
FRANK
Mine's pointing to the left.
JOE
Oh F-, oh Frank, seriously, I have such a raging clue right now, I think we'd better follow it.
FRANK
Okay, let's follow your raging clue.
JOE
Oofff.
RANDY
[watches them walk away] Godspeed.
[Kyle's house, night. The front door opens and Kyle looks out. A couple of agents look back at him from their car parked out in front of the house. One looks both ways to make sure no one is coming while the other looks at his watch. Kyle move away from the entrance and closes the door softly]
STAN
[appears suddenly in the living room] Kyle!
KYLE
[jumps] Aaaah!
STAN
Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys [looks around] are coming to my house and questioning me about you??
KYLE
I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there.
STAN
Well why did you have to involve me??
KYLE
It's not my fault.
STAN
All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11.
KYLE
Really?
STAN
Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you. [moves off, then stops and turns around] There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?
KYLE
......Dude.
STAN
[mulls it over] That's all I needed. [turns around and heads for the back door. Kyle follows.]
[South Park Elementary, next day. The bell rings and the students are all in the gym. Mr. Mackey addresses them]
MR. MACKEY
Now you might all think I've given up finding out who crapped in the urinal. M'kay? And maybe, maybe you think it's a victimless crime. This, is Mr. Venezuela [walks up to a school janitor, who's a Latino with mop and bucket in hand], the school janitor. Okay? [the fourth graders are shown with some kindergartners in front of them] He's the person... who has to clean up... when some trickster... drops a dook in the wrong toilet! Mr. Venezuela makes six bucks an hour at best! Okay? He's got three kids at home, he's got a car that barely works, he's gotta clean up puke with sawdust, m'kay, then he walks into the boys' room and sees a big meaty chud starin' him in the face! [the sixth graders are shown seated to the left of the fourth graders] So when you crapped in that urinal, m'kay, you might as well have just dropped your pants, and laid a turd right on top of Mr. Venezuela's head! [the kids laugh] Oh, you think it's funny, huh?!
MRS. GARRISON
Mr. Mackey! [he and Principal Victoria enter the gym] We got him.
MR. MACKEY
Huh?
MRS. GARRISON
We caught the person that did it.
[Somewhere... A taxi drops Stan and Kyle off in front of a large house. They walk up to the front door and Stan knocks.]
STAN
Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11.
MAN
[wearing a 911truth.org T-shirt] Aw geez. Come on in, kids. [the boys enter. A model of the towers stands on the coffee table while the computer displays a 9/11 Web page. The rest of the office is littered with 9/11 stuff] It doesn't surprise me. More and more people are being blamed for 9/11 every day.
KYLE
They are?
911TRUTH MAN
Yeah, it a way of keeping people from seeing the real evidence. I know it seems crazy, but 9/11 was pulled off by our own government, so they could gain support for attacking the Middle East.
KYLE
What? No no no.
911TRUTH MAN
I know it's hard to believe.
STAN
Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings?
911TRUTH MAN
It's called the False Flag policy. Make it look like the enemy attacked you. Get all your citizens riled up and waving American flags. Then you're free to invade any country you want.
KYLE
...That's retarded.
911TRUTH MAN
[sits at his computer and starts typing away] Look into the evidence of 9/11 and you'll see there are a lot of holes in their story.
KYLE
There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too; it doesn't mean it's wrong.
911TRUTH MAN
You don't understand! The government controls everything. The media, the corporations, they have the power to do anything they want. Here, look! [grabs two large glass jars and hands them to Kyle] Read the labels on these! Go on, read them!
KYLE
[reads the labels] Code 234
911TRUTH MAN
We think they came from a government office.
KYLE
What is it?
911TRUTH MAN
It's anthrax.
KYLE
Anthrax?!
911TRUTH MAN
Someday we'll use it as evidence against them.
KYLE
Stan, we can't be seen with this nutjob! [at that moment the house is raided by Chicago cops. The doors and windows fall away as they rush inside. An ambulance and a lot of police cars wait outside as a helicopter hovers overhead. Kyle stands with the jars of anthrax, sure that he's in big trouble] Aw, aw, awww!
[Mr. Mackey's office, day. He's addressing the guilty party...]
MR. MACKEY
Why, Clyde? Why did you do it?
CLYDE
I don't know. [looks away as Mr. Mackey gets up, walks around the desk, and stands behind him, to his left]
MR. MACKEY
You got a whole school here, Clyde! M'kay? You got over three hundred people that need to use the boys' room. [walks behind Clyde to the right side. Clyde looks away and to the left] Then you decide you're gonna be a comedian, m'kay, and pinch one off in the urinal, and leave it layin' there for everyone to have to look at! [Clyde tries hard to contain his laughter] Okay okay, you think it's funny, but nobody else does! They gotta walk in that bathroom and see your rancid dook propped up against the back of the urinal like a brown rag doll! [Clyde grins, then bursts out laughing. The door opens and Principal Victoria looks in]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Mr. Mackey, Clyde's parents are here.
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, that's good! [Principal Victoria walks away. Mr. Mackey addresses Clyde again] Let's see what your mom and dad have to say about your little poopscapade! [The Donovans show up] Come on in, please. I'm just trying to get your son to explain why... he would drop a dook in the urinal!
MR. DONOVAN
Mr. Mackey, there's something you should know...
[The White House, day. Stan, Kyle, and the man from 911truth.org are brought into the Oval Office by the Secret Service. The President's staff awaits.]
KYLE
Eh-xcuse me, there's been a misunderstanding.
DONALD RUMSFELD
Come on in, Mr. President. [President Bush comes in through one of the side doors]
KYLE
Uh, Mr. President, my name is-
BUSH
SSHHUUDDUUPP!! You think we don't know your name?! We know everything! We control everything! [walks to his desk] We've all worked very hard to keep our involvement in 9/11 a secret! But you just had to keep digging!
KYLE
[quite surprised] Really?
911TRUTH MAN
You won't get away with it! People know!
BUSH
People? You mean sheeple. We have the majority of them kept in blissful ignorance. Just one more... leak... [pulls out a pistol and his voice gets sinister] to fix... [the Secret Service agents take the 911truth man to the President]
911TRUTH MAN
Wait. What are you doing?
BUSH
[leaves his desk and cocks the gun] You've been a thorn in our side for too long, I'm afraid.
911TRUTH MAN
No! You can't do this! [Bush grabs him by the collar] Please! I'll stop. I'll take down the Web site. I'll sto- [the President sticks the gun into the man's mouth] Oh no! Oh no!
BUSH
Too late. [squeezes the trigger once and the bullet goes clear through the man's head. The 911truth man is dead]
STAN
JESUS CHRIST!!
RUMSFELD
[Condoleezza Rice stands to his left] Hahaha. He died like a pig.
BUSH
[wipes the blood off his clothes and skin] Some pigs never learn.
KYLE
[in sheer disbelief, cocks his head right] No. Way.
STAN
He was right. You DID cause 9/11.
BUSH
Yes. Quite simple to pull off, really. All I had to do was have explosives planted in the base of the towers. Then on 9/11 we pretended like four planes were being hijacked.when really we just rerouted them to Pennsylvania, then flew two military jets into the World Trade Center filled with more explosives, then shot down all the witnesses of Flight 93 with an F-15 after blowing up the Pentagon with a Cruise missile. It was only the world's most intricate and flawlessly-executed ever, ever.
KYLE
[ever more incredulous, cocks his head left and lower] ...Really??
STAN
Why?!
BUSH
[smiling, he begins to pace] Oldest reason in the world. Money. The towers fell and the American sheeple all waved their flags. [walks by Dick Cheney, who's got a crossbow and is dressed to hunt] Finally we could invade Iraq, [finishes off with sinister glee] and get the oil which made us all richer than before.
RUMSFELD
[rubs his hands together greedily] Beauutiful money, hahahaha!
KYLE
[cocks his head right and even lower. He's not buying it] ...Really??
STAN
[off on a different page] Is the whole government in on this?
BUSH
We are all-knowing and all-powerful. Good-bye, boys. [steps aside as Dick Cheney takes aim at them. Cheney fires an arrow at them, but the arrow hits a marble vase on a table behind the boys. The arrow bounces off the vase and hits fire alarm, which sets off the sprinkler system. Everyone does his best not to get wet]
CHENEY
Dangit! I missed again!
BUSH
For Christ's sake, Cheney! [Two aids open the doors to the Oval Office and enter]
STAN
[seeing their chance] Kyle! Run! [the boys take off with the Secret Service in hot pursuit]
BUSH
KILL THEM!
[Attendance office, day, next to the Principal's office. Mr. Mackey stands there with Principal Victoria in the background, at her desk. He picks up the PA mic.]
MR. MACKEY
Attention students. Apparently, Clyde could not have been the one who crapped in the urinal, because Clyde had a colostomy at age 5. 'Kay? Now, whoever did this unspeakable act is still at large. The boys' bathroom is closed until further notice, 'cause one of you thought it would be a good idea... to pull down your pants... m'kay, hover your buttcheeks over the urinal... and squeeze out a chocolate hot dog... m'kay? [all the kids in the hall listen, then start laughing] Oh you think that's funny, huh?! [Principal Victoria is also snickering in the background] Let me assure you, there is nothing funny... about going up to a nice, clean, unsuspectin' urinal, [next shot is the school gym, where some students are practicing their basketball skills, but now they're listening] 'kay, droppin' your pants then... turnin' around... squattin' over that urinal, 'kay, maybe... maybe pullin' your buttcheeks apart with your hands, m'kay, and then layin' out a big fudge dragon for all the world to see. [the kids there begin to laugh] Oh yeah, that's real funny! [turns off the mic and slams it down] I'm gonna catch this sonofabitch if it's the last thing I DO! M'kay?! [moves off]
[A bus terminal. A bus pulls in from Washington D.C. and the door opens. Passengers pour out, including Stan and Kyle.]
STAN
All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude. [next scene is another city, somewhere] We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw.
KYLE
It just... doesn't seem right.
STAN
Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time.
KYLE
Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out. [a door opens besides them and the 911truth man the President had shot exits a restaurant and goes the other direction]
STAN
Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that? [Kyle stops and turns around]
KYLE
Hey! [the 911truth man turns around, then panics as he recognizes the boys] Dude. You're alive? [the man stands there for a few seconds, not knowing what to do, then turns around and runs away, pushing people aside. Kyle gives chase] Come back here! [the man keeps running]
MAN 1
Hey!
MAN 2
Ogh!
[the POV changes to that of a dead-end alley. The camera descends from on high as the 911truth man runs down the alley. It stops descending when Stan and Kyle round the corner. The man reaches a chain-link fence and tries to climb it. The boys come in closer. The man fails to climb the fence and drops to the ground when the boys reach him.]
911TRUTH MAN
[begins to plead] No. Please. Pleeease!
KYLE
Dude! What the hell is going on?!
911TRUTH MAN
Don't kill me! I, I just do what they say!
STAN
What who said?
911TRUTH MAN
I have a family. Please don't kill me!
KYLE
Dude, we aren't going to kill you. [just then a gunshot is heard and the 911truth man falls dead... again]
STAN
Oh God!
BEARDED MAN
[appears with the smoking gun] It isn't safe here, boys. Follow me!
KYLE
Who the fuck are you?!
BEARDED MAN
There's no time! come on! [the camera pans up but stays focused on the three folks as the boys follow the bearded man out of the alley.]
[A mansion, night. The bearded man escorts Stan and Kyle in and leads them to his library]
KYLE
Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on??
STAN
Who are you?
BEARDED MAN
[pours himself a drink] I'm a detective, and I'm afraid that you kids have been double-crossed.
KYLE
You f-figured this thing all out?
BEARDED MAN
Not me. My mystery-solving sons. Come on in, boys. [the Hardly Boys enter] My boys were researching who went number two in the urinal at your school when they discovered something odd, which gave them a clue.
FRANK
Gave us both a clue.
MR. HARDLY
That clue led them to a 9/11 conspiracy group party, where they got a lot more clues.
JOE
I was getting a clue like every two minutes.
FRANK
I got such a raging clue that I almost shot clue goo all over Joe.
MR. HARDLY
Those clues pointed out that all the 9/11 conspiracy theories could be disproven scientifically. And that's when Frank got his biggest clue.
FRANK
It was huuuge.
MR. HARDLY
That all the 9/11 conspiracy Web sites are run by the government. The 9/11 conspiracy... is a government conspiracy.
STAN
Aw Jesus...
KYLE
Why would the government want people to believe they caused 9/11?
MR. HARDLY
For a government to have power, they must appear to have complete control. What better way to make people fear them than to convince them they are capable of the most elaborate plan on earth?
BUSH
[off-screen] That's quite enough, Hardly! [the camera shows him entering with his staff] Don't believe what he says, boys; we caused 9/11. [brings forth a manila folder] It's all right here in these secret documents, [hugs the folder tight] but you'll never get them. [turns around as he yawns, dropping the folder to the floor behind him. No one picks it up]
KYLE
I knew it! You didn't plan 9/11 and you really didn't shoot that guy!
BUSH
[dropping the act] Boys, you don't understand. People need to think we are all-powerful. That we control the world. If they know we weren't in charge of 9/11 then... we appear to control nothing.
KYLE
Well why don't you just tell people the truth?!
BUSH
We do that too. And most people believe the truth. But one fourth of the population is retarded. If they wanna believe we control everything with intricate plans, why not let them?
MR. HARDLY
Just one thing, Mr. President: How the devil did you know we were all here? [a close-up of Kyle. A gun appears next to his left temple. The camera moves clockwise as it refocuses on Stan, who's got the gun aimed at Kyle. Stan must have told the President]
STAN
How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do!
KYLE
Stan! What the fuck?!
STAN
It was all planned out!
KYLE
You knew this whole time? Why?
STAN
Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.
KYLE
[backs away a bit] What??
STAN
The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!
KYLE
So you blamed the government?!
MR. HARDLY
And the government was more than willing to take the blame, so long as it made them look responsible for 9/11!
STAN
[lowers his pistol] Oh man, now everyone's gonna know. Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have to be so good at solving mysteries?
KYLE
So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government?
STAN
Yuh.
KYLE
So then, who was responsible for 9/11?
STAN
Whattaya mean? A bunch of pissed-off Muslims.
FRANK
[giggles] Yeah. What are you, retarded? [The President and his staff laugh heartily]
MR. HARDLY
Well, it looks like this mystery is solved. It's time for the culprit to finally pay!
[The boys' room at South Park Elementary, day. Stan is cleaning the urinal under Mr. Mackey's supervision]
MR. MACKEY
When you dook in the urinal, it's bad, m'kay! [Stan squirts some cleaning fluid onto the urinal basin] How would you feel... if somebody came into your home, m'kay, pulled down their pants and laid a big mud monkey right on your mom's face? [Stan laughs] Oh you think that's funny, huh?! Yeah, that's real funny!
End of Mystery of the Urinal Deuce


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:In his new role as School Hallway Monitor at South Park Elementary, Cartman must team up with Kyle when they discover a teacher having sex with a student.

script:Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy

[South Park Elementary, day, school hall. The bell rings and the students go to their lockers. Stan and Kyle put some books away as Cartman shares an encounter with Kenny and the other two.]
CARTMAN
And so then, I put my finger up my butthole, right? And I walked up to Kelly Nelson, and I said, "Do you smell lemon grass?", and she smelled my finger and puked! Hehehehe. Oh, guys, you should have been there.
HALL MONITOR
[a ginger, he taps on Cartman's right shoulder] Eric, I have to take you to the principal's office.
CARTMAN
What? I didn't do it, Kelly Nelson's a liar!
HALL MONITOR
I've been instructed to bring you to the principal's office.
CARTMAN
Oh, suck my balls you ginger Jew rat hall monitor! Punkass stoolie, who the fuck do you think you are?!
HALL MONITOR
I'm just doin' my job.
CARTMAN
[taunting and jabbing at him] I'm juh duh duh duhhh! Do you know why you're a hallway monitor?! Because you don't have any friends! You should kill yourself! You should kill yourself!!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Eric Cartman, report to the principal's office immediately.
CARTMAN
Aw Goddamnit!
[The principal's office, moments later. A knock is heard at the door.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Come on in, Eric. [Cartman and the hall monitor enter]
CARTMAN
[apologizes, but in a blasé fashion] I'm sorry, Principal Victoria. I didn't mean to do it, how could I have been so foolish?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Eric, the reason we called you in here is because it is your turn to be the school hallway monitor. [the former hall monitor removes his belt and sash and prepares to give them to Cartman]
CARTMAN
The hall monit- me?
MR. MACKEY
You need to watch for bad behavior, and make sure anyone in the halls during class has a hall pass. M'kay? [Cartman receives the sash and the former hall monitor leaves]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
If anyone doesn't, you have the authority to bring them to me.
CARTMAN
[incredulous] Auth- authoritah?
MR. MACKEY
Now Eric, being the school hallway monitor is a big responsibility. M'kay? It is important that you take the job seriously, and that you don't abuse the power.
CARTMAN
Ahem. Me?
[A montage. First scene is the school hall. Cartman pops up dressed as Dog the Bounty Hunter. He walks around and strikes a few poses. He pockets a can of Bear Spray into its holster, makes sure he has handcuffs, then resets his fake facial hair. Next, he pretends he's driving a real car. Back at school, he walks into view and strikes one more dramatic pose, then the POV changes and he's walking towards the camera. One more scene has him turning the steering wheel of an SUV.]
CARTMAN
There's fear and darkness all around you
The criminals are on the run
No use in not having your hall pass
I'll take you to the principal 'cause I'm the Dawg
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg
The Hallway Monitor!
[laughs until a hand appears and knocks on the driver's window.]
CAR SALESMAN
[opens the door] Hey, kid, get outta there.
CARTMAN
That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways. [leaves. The video shoot resumes at school. Cartman is on the job when he turns around and sees someone else in the hall. He strikes a dramatic pose and yells] Hall pass! Show me your hall pass!
BOY
What?
CARTMAN
[shoves the boy into the lockers and whips out the Bear Spray] You know what this is? This is the mace that they use on bears, faggot! Now let me see your hall pass!
BOY
It's right here. [reaches into his pocket and pulls it out to show him]
CARTMAN
[releases the boy] All right, cool, brah. Go with Christ. [turns right and walks away. The boy isn't quite finished]
BOY
What? You can't just push me up against the-
CARTMAN
[kicks the boy away] Argh!
BOY
[flies out of view]Aah!
CARTMAN
[marches on] I am the Dawg, the big bad- [stops] Oh my God! [sees a wad of paper on the floor, runs up to pick it up and checks it out] What the fuck is this?!
[Kindergarten. The kindergartners' new teacher is shown teaching them about shapes. She's drawn a circle and is now drawing a square]
TEACHER
And so this shape with four sides is what, class?
CARTMAN
[bursts into the classroom] Boyarrrgh! [everyone turns to see who it is. Cartman walks up to Ike] Ike Broflovski! You littering my hallway, brah?!
TEACHER
What are you doing?!
CARTMAN
I found this in the hallway. [unfolds the wad of paper - it's a drawing Ike made of his teacher with hearts all around her] Apparently your student Ike has a crush on you. [Ike looks around nervously] You got a crush on your teacher, brah?! Keep it out of my hallway! Go with Christ. Here you go. [hands the drawing to the teacher and heads for the door]
TEACHER
I don't think that's really necessary.
CARTMAN
Hey! I don't tell you how to run your class, don't tell me how to run my hallway! [leaves and closes the door]
FILLMORE
Ike has a crush on teacher!
CLASS
Ike has a crush on teacher! [the class laughs]
TEACHER
That's enough, class! [the period ends and the teacher begins erasing the chalkboard] Okay, well see you tomorrow, everybody. Ike, could you stay just a few minutes, please? [Fillmore takes his crayon and leaves. The teacher moves towards Ike] Ike, I'm very flattered, by all of your love notes, but I need to be clear. See, there've been a lot of female teachers on the news lately who have been having relationships with young male students and, people might get the wrong idea, even though... I do admire you. You are so smart and gifted. Soo mature for your age.
IKE
I don't like Mason.
TEACHER
You listen, and you really care about what I have to say. You make me feel things I've never... [reaches out to Ike and touches his right hand] felt before. [she and Ike hold hands, but she lets go and leaves her seat] Ike, this is crazy. I'm your teacher. How can we be having these feelings for each other? [turns around and faces him] You're so mysterious, and I can't... and I can't... [begins to swoon. A montage follows]
[She and Ike rub noses as a heart frames them. Their shadows rush up and hug each other, then twirl around together as hearts pulsate outward. They hold hands again. She takes him out to dinner and chatters away. She takes him out to ice-skate at a skating rink. She takes him out to a dinner picnic before a setting sun - they share wine and cheese. She takes him out for a ride on a duck boat - she does the driving. She has an artist draw a picture of them. They hop onto a merry-go-round and get on horses - she blows a kiss at him there. She takes him home and watches TV with him]
REO SPEEDWAGON
And I can't fight this feelin' anymore
I've forgotten what I started fightin' for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashin' through your door
Baby, I cant fight this feelin' anymore
[the last scene is the two of them under the covers ]
TEACHER
That was unbelievable. I've never felt like such a woman before. They'll say our love is wrong, but we can't let anybody know; they'll never understand. [rolls to her right and starts massaging Ike tenderly] We were meant to be, I know it. How else could sex be that incredible? [lays back down]
IKE
[oops] Ike made a nuno.
[The boy's room at South Park Elementary. Butters rushes in and towards the urinal. Once in place, he sets his hall pass aside, drops his pants, raises his shirt, and lets fly]
BUTTERS
Hey there, Mr. Wiener, whattaya know? Do ya need to tinkle tinkle? [falsetto] Yes I do think so.
CARTMAN
[bursts into the restroom. Butters is startled] Hands?! Let me see those hands!
BUTTERS
[backs off] Haaaah!
CARTMAN
[advances] Where's your pass?! Show me your hall pass, brah!
BUTTERS
[looks around frantically for it] It's, it's... I just had it! [keeps looking, but Cartman grabs him...]
CARTMAN
I knew it! [...slams his head against a toilet stall, then tosses him to the floor, cuffs him, and escorts him out of the restroom. Butters doesn't get a chance to pull his pants up. The hall pass remains on the sink where Butters left it.]
[The waiting room outside the principal office, moments later. Cartman and Butters wait on the bench outside, and Butters still has his pants around his ankles]
CARTMAN
Look, brah, I had to bring you in, but I don't have any hard feelin's against you all right?
BUTTERS
Huh?
CARTMAN
Here, you need a smoke, brah?
BUTTERS
Uhh, okay. [Cartman puts a cigarette into Butters' mouth, then lights it for him]
CARTMAN
You've gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah.
BUTTERS
I do. [coughs]
CARTMAN
Jesus is Lord. You can go one direction in life, or you just walk around the hallways without a hall pass. Or you can see the light, brah. [Butters coughs some more]
[The Broflovski house, afternoon. Kyle walks in.]
SHEILA
[greets him holding some laundry] Kyle, I need you to go get your brother over at his teacher's house.
KYLE
Huh?
SHEILA
Tell his teacher I'm sorry, but I forgot he has a doctor's appointment today.
KYLE
What's he doing at his teacher's house?
SHEILA
He's been going there in the afternoons for private tutoring.
[The teacher's house, a lovely one-story structure. Starland Vocal Band's "Afternoon Delight" is playing inside. Kyle walks up to the front door and knocks.]
KYLE
Hello? [finds the door open and walks in] Excuse me. I'm here to pick up Ike? [moves further into the house] Uh, hello? Is Ike here? [enters the room the music and some giggling is coming from - it's the bathroom] Hello? [the teacher, in the bathtub, looks at him]
TEACHER
OOOH! [covers her breasts]
KYLE
Oh God! [squeezes his eyes shut] I'm sorry. [opens them again] I didn't mean to-ah, I'm looking for my brother. [Ike pops up out of the water dressed in snorkel gear. Kyle's eyebrows go up] Ike?? [they just look at him] What the hell is going on??
TEACHER
Oh, what's the use, Ike? We're caught. [moments later, an angry Kyle is pulling Ike towards the front door] Hold on, please, you don't understand.
KYLE
[turns to look at her] Really?! What's there not to understand?!
TEACHER
Your brother and I... are in love.
KYLE
He's a little young, don't you think?!
IKE
Oh. [angrily, he leaves Kyle for his teacher]
TEACHER
Ike is very mature for his age, and you know it!
IKE
Ring around the rosey.
TEACHER
He makes me feel like nobody else does. He loves me and only me, and I know I'm a goddess to him. When we make love, he can give it to me HARD, or soft and gentle-
KYLE
All right! We're getting the hell out of here! [begins to pull Ike away from the teacher]
IKE
[resisting] Nonono, nononono.
KYLE
Ike, you can't possibly want this. We have to tell Mom.
IKE
[sobbing] No, no.
KYLE
Ike?
TEACHER
Is it so hard to believe that true love exists?
KYLE
[turns to the front door] This is nuts.
[The Broflovski house, dinnertime.]
KYLE
Mom, Dad, have you ever met Ike's kindergarten teacher? [Ike glares at Kyle]
SHEILA
Miss Stevenson? Yes. She's very nice.
KYLE
Yeah. Well, she likes Ike a whole lot.
SHEILA
That's great.
KYLE
Yyeah, except maybe it's not perfectly great, because to some degree, Ike and Ms. Stevenson are having an-.
IKE
Spider-Man! I'm safe, Mom.
SHEILA
Yes, Ike, you like Spider-Man, don't you?
KYLE
Mom, there might be something that you should look into about Ike staying after school all the time-
IKE
Weohhh part ten. Mom-my I love you I love you.
SHEILA
Mommy loves you too, sweetie.
KYLE
Would you excuse us for a second? [leaves his chair and takes Ike to the living room. Kyle now addresses Ike] You just can't expect me to sit there and say nothing. No, Ike, I'm supposed to be looking out for you. So what? I wasn't going to just blurt it out, I was gonna use some tact, but you won't even let me... What? Uh uh! That's not fair, Ike! [Ike replies with a series of snippets from nursery rhymes, which has nothing to do with Kyle's concern. Kyle is finished, and the two of them return to the table] Mom, I think maybe you should talk to Ike about love and sex!
SHEILA
Sex? Oh bubbe, Ike is much too young. [silence follows as the family continues eating]
[Park County Police Station, day. Seems like Officer Barbrady and his police station have been phased out for good now. Detective Yates and his men are in the breakroom eating lunch]
DET. YATES
You're so full of crap, Foley.
FOLEY
What? I did shoot him in the face. Twice.
KYLE
[appears at the breakroom entrance] Ex, excuse me? [the officers look, and he walks in] My name is... Brad. And uh I need to report a crime. Anonymously.
YATES
Oh? What's the crime?
KYLE
Well, I attend South Park Elementary, ah-and... w-one of the teachers is having sssex with a student.
YATES
Oh my God! This is terrible! [other officers say other things. Yates and another officer get on bended knee next to Kyle] Ya-you did the right thing telling the police, Brad. Now, who is the teacher? What's his name?
KYLE
Well, it isn't a guy teacher. It's a woman.
FOLEY
A woman?
KYLE
Yeah. She's having sex with a boy. [the officer to his right is taking notes.]
MITCH
Oh, but, but she's ugly, right?
KYLE
Well no, not really. It's the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Stevenson.
YATES
The blonde?
KYLE
Yeah.
FOLEY
Some young boy is having sex with Miss Stevenson?
KYLE
[firmly] Yes.
FOLEY
Nisssse.
YATES
Nnice.
KYLE
What?! No, you don't understand-
FOLEY
You sure they've had sex?
KYLE
Yeah.
OFFICER 1
Has she performed oral sex on him?
KYLE
I think so.
OFFICER 1
...Nice.
FOLEY
Nisssse.
OFFICER 1
[whispers] Nisssse.
YATES
So wait, what, what's the crime?
FOLEY
The crime is, she isn't doing it with me. [jabs jokingly at Officer 2. All the officers laugh]
KYLE
Hay! He's totally underage. She's taking advantage of him.
YATES
You're right. We're sorry. This is serious. We need to track this student down and... give him his "Luckiest Boy In America" medal right away. [All the officers laugh harder]
KYLE
[throws his hands up in frustration and leaves] Gargh!
[South Park Elementary, day, hallway. The students at either at their lockers or milling around. Kyle approaches Stan and Kenny.]
KYLE
Guys, can I talk to you?
STAN
Sure dude.
KYLE
I need you to keep quiet about this, all right? [Cartman walks up] My little brother and his tea-
CARTMAN
Brahs, it's almost class time. I need you to start clearin' the hallways aright?
KYLE
Not now, Cartman! I have really serious problems!
STAN
Dude, what's the matter?
KYLE
The kindergarten teacher is having sex with my little brother.
STAN
...Wow.
KENNY
(Reaaly??)
CARTMAN
Damn, brah, your little brother's pretty cool.
KYLE
It's not cool! Ike isn't old enough to understand.
CARTMAN
What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee.
KYLE
[looks long and hard at Cartman] "stick it inside her and pee"
CARTMAN
Well, okay, fine. Unless you don't want to get her pregnant, then you pull it out and pee on her leg.
STAN
Dude, I really don't see a problem.
CARTMAN
Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with.
KYLE
You guys don't understand! His wacko teacher is like a schoolgirl! They pass notes to each other in the classroom, they have sex at her house over lunch break, [Cartman waves Kyle off and walks away] and during class they sneak out and kiss in the hallways! [this stops Cartman and makes his eyes big]
CARTMAN
They what??
KYLE
They sneak out during class and make out in the hallways!
CARTMAN
[spins around] Hang on a second: making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy!
KYLE
Well they're doing it!
CARTMAN
Yeah, well now it's personal! The hallways are my jurisdiction! If there's a hallway infraction going on, they're gonna have to deal with the Dawg!
[Kindergarten class, in session]
MISS STEVENSON
Okay, just continue with your macaroni pictures. Teacher has to step out for a second. Uh Ike, could you help me out, please? [Ike leaves his seat and joins Miss Stevenson outside. She puts him on the shelf of the telephone booth next to the classroom] Oh Ike, I just had to have a second alone with you.
IKE
I like dada better.
MISS STEVENSON
I got your love letter, and I wrote you one back. Oh, just one kiss to hold me over for the rest of class. [she begins to kiss Ike. Cartman appears in the distance and turns right...]
CARTMAN
Hall infraction! [runs up to Miss Stevenson]
MISS STEVENSON
[turning to Cartman] Oh uhh, we were just heading back in.
CARTMAN
You got a hall pass, brah?!
MISS STEVENSON
I don't need a hall pass. I'm a teacher.
CARTMAN
Yeah? Well, where's his hall pass?!
MISS STEVENSON
Look, just let us get back in-
CARTMAN
Get down on the floor!
MISS STEVENSON
We're going back inside!
CARTMAN
[whips out the Bear Spray] You like bear mace, icehead?!
MISS STEVENSON
Bear mace??
CARTMAN
You're goin' with Christ! [sprays Miss Stevenson pretty good]
MISS STEVENSON
Oooooh!
[Next stop, the principal's office. Cartman, Miss Stevenson and Ike stand before Principal Victoria]
CARTMAN
...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
"Ike, I long to feel your arms around me"?? Miss Stevenson, you- you're having a relationship with this student?
CARTMAN
Yes. During classtime, without a hall pass.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
This is unbelievable.
CARTMAN
I know. It's like a hall pass doesn't even matter to her.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Miss Stevenson, I will need to inform the police.
MISS STEVENSON
[puts her hands to her cheeks] Oh God...
CARTMAN
You just dealt with the Dawg, bitch!
[South Park Elementary, later. The front doors are open, revealing the school logo and the steps leading up to the hallways. Police and news reporters are present. Two officers exit with Miss Stevenson in handcuffs.]
YATES
[sarcastically] Sorry we had to do this, but the lady principal insisted. [the officers move past Yates]
RANDY
[shows up next to Jimbo and Ned] What's goin' on?
JIMBO
The kindergarten teacher is suspected of having sex with a student
RANDY
With a student? But... she's a woman.
JIMBO
Yeah. I know.
RANDY
But... she's hot.
KYLE
Wow. I think I owe you one, Cartman.
CARTMAN
You don't owe me anything. My hallways are cleeean. [points his index fingers at the camera]
[The Broflovski house, night, Kyle's room. Kyle is writing something out when Ike appears at his doorway, pissed off that his teacher was taken away]
KYLE
[sensing Ike, turns around in his chair] Ike, I didn't tell on you, you got busted by the hallway monitor. [Ike glares at him] Okay, okay. I did have something to do with it. But someday you're gonna realize it was for the best.
IKE
You are dead to me!
KYLE
What?
IKE
I said, you're dead to me!
KYLE
I'm dead to you?
IKE
[points at him] You're dead to me, Kyle!
[Park County Police Station, day. Miss Stevenson is calling someone from there as officers stand around and discuss police items]
MISS STEVENSON
I'm at the police station. They say they found some evidence. I'm so scared. [Ike is at the other end of the line] Listen, I want you to know it's okay. If anybody tries to talk to you, you don't need to say anything. Just leave it to me. I know a way out of this.
[News 4 Newsbreak: A reporter in front of the South Park Courthouse]
REPORTER
Tom, an elementary school teacher is under arrest for allegedly having an affair... with one of her young students. The case is shocking, due mostly to the fact that the teacher... is pretty hot, Tom. If the accusations are true, then... damn! Uh, looks like the defendant and her lawyer are about to give a statement, Tom.
MISS STEVENSON
I am deeply sorry to announce that the allegations against me are true. Over the past several weeks, I have been having physical relations with one of my students.
MAN 1
Nice.
MAN 2
[whispers and squeezes his eyes shut] Nissse
MISS STEVENSON
I know my actions were wrong, but I cannot be fully to blame. You see, I am an alcoholic.
OFFICER 2
Ohhhh.
[Kyle's hosue, day. Cartman and Kyle are watching the special report on TV]
MISS STEVENSON
Yes, I'm afraid it's true.
CARTMAN
Oh no!
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
I don't believe it. She's using the Mel Gibson defense.
[Back at the Courthouse]
MISS STEVENSON
I am a perfectly good person, but when I drink, the alcohol makes me say and do things I wouldn't normally do.
YATES
Well, that explains it.
FOLEY
Do we still press charges?
YATES
Who are we gonna convict? Johnny Walker?
MAN 3
Poor woman. She's a victim.
RANDY
Yeah, she's a hot victim. [looks around for any reaction, but none comes]
LAWYER
[steps up to the mic] My client has agreed to check herself into rehab immediately. [everyone cheers her on]
PRINT REPORTER
Good luck, ma'am. You can beat your alcoholism. [more cheering]
[Park County Drug & Alcohol Rehabilitation Center. Patients line up and go in through a revolving door only to come back out and continue down the line.]
[The office of a rehab counselor. Miss Stevenson is seated before the counselor.]
THERAPIST
Alcohol is a crutch which we use to medicate ourselves; to, to cover up emotional baggage from our past. Was there ever a history of sexual abuse in your family?
MISS STEVENSON
No, but my uncle used to ask me and my twin sister to kiss and he'd take pictures.
THERAPIST
Nissse. [sometime later, they're outside the center. He sees her off] Congratulations, Miss Stevenson.
MISS STEVENSON
All better now. [walks away, gets into her truck and drives away. She drives up to the Broflovski house, stops, gets out a ladder and extends it, props it up against Ike's window, and climbs up]
[Ike's room. Ike is building something with Legos. Miss Stevenson appears at the window and opens it up]
MISS STEVENSON
Ike. [climbs in and walks to Ike. He turns and stands, his arms outstretched]
IKE
Miss Stephenson [she kneels down, picks him up and holds him close]
MISS STEVENSON
Ike, we have to get out of here! They'll never let us be together. I think... I think we should go to Milan, like we always talked about. [puts both her hands to her heart]
IKE
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaay, Mulan!
MISS STEVENSON
Get your things together. We don't have much time.
[Kyle's room. He's at his desk copying text from from a book. He hears the sound of something landing on the ground outside, then of a car door closing. He gets up to investigate. He goes to Ike's room and opens the door, then looks around.]
KYLE
Ike, are you okay? [sees an emptier room than usual, and the open window.] Ike? [walks up to the window and sees the ladder still in place.] Iiiike! [the teacher and Ike away.]
[Park County Police Station, breakroom day. The officers are now eating pizza.]
YATES
Are you sure you're not lying, Foley?
FOLEY
No, really! I shot both of them! They weren't even doin' nothin'!
SHEILA
[enters the breakroom with Kyle following close behind] Help! Please, I need your help! That teacher, Miss Stevenson, she, she left town with my son! I got a note saying they're going to Milan!
YATES
You're kidding!
SHEILA
No, it's true!
YATES
Damnit, where were all these sexed-up teachers when I was a kid?!
SHEILA
This is serious!
OFFICER 1
Yeah, boys going to Milan with a beautiful older woman. Quick! Call the FBI! [the officers laugh. Detective Yates smiles]
SHEILA
Are you going to do nothing?!
YATES
[irritated] All right all right, we'll make a report. Jesus...
[The Broflovski house, day. Kyle sits at the edge of the patio, depressed. Cartman walks up to him]
CARTMAN
There you are. What are you doing? You giving up, brah?!
KYLE
Dude, my brother's in Milan. There's nothing I can do.
CARTMAN
No, they haven't left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning.
KYLE
How do you know that?
CARTMAN
I had Beth check out their Travelocity account.
KYLE
Who's Beth?
CARTMAN
Beth is my bitch. I put a whole crew together, brah. I'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut no matter what it takes! Are you in?!
[Music video. In this one, Cartman introduces his crew. One of them is "Kyle, Jew."]
CARTMAN
I got some badass guys to help me.
I only had to pay them fifteen bucks.
You think you got away with not having a hall pass?
You won't get away from me 'cause I'm the Dawg!
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
Think you can get away with not having a hall pass? Think again! [the video ends and the hallway looks normal again] How was that, Butters?
BUTTERS
[behind the camera] Ehthat was pretty good.
KYLE
Can we get going now, please?!
CARTMAN
Yep. We're all done with the video, let's move out! [they go forth]
[An airport Hilton, night. Planes can be seen behind it taking off.]
[A room at the Hilton. Ike is in bed watching TV. Miss Stevenson comes out of the bathroom.]
MISS STEVENSON
Ike, is that all you're gonna do is watch TV?
IKE
I love TV. Yaaay!
MISS STEVENSON
[climbs into bed] But what about me? I want to talk. [Ike just goes back to watching the TV]
[A car, night. Cartman and his crew are driving to the airport]
CARTMAN
Everyone get a good look at our fugitive! I want her taken down fast and clean!
LEEROY
[in a retarded voice] She ran away; now she got to deal with the Dawg, huh?
CARTMAN
[determined] Beth found out they have a room at the Airport Hilton. We need to search it. Here's the hotel! [into the Intercom] Beth, tell Leeroy to pull up here! [Beth just signals for Earl to drive into the hotel driveway and stop at the front doors. Earl pulls up and brakes quickly] All right, let's go! Move out! [they leave the SUV and rush into the hotel]
BELLBOY
Hey! You can't leave your car there!
CARTMAN
It's okay! I'm a hallway monitor! [they pass through the front entrance] Keep separation! Leeroy, check out our twenty!
RECEPTIONIST
Can I help you?
CARTMAN
You seen this woman, brah? [shows her a picture of Miss Stevenson] She's staying here!
RECEPTIONIST
Who are you?
CARTMAN
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
HEAD CONCIERGE
I think you should leave before I call the police!
CARTMAN
Beth! Bear-mace that guy! [she sprays bear mace all over the concierge and he crumbles to the floor, trying to vomit] Let's check out the rooms! Leeroy and Kyle go that way! Beth, you come with me!
BELLBOY
[dials 911] We need police here, right away! [Cartman begins his rounds. He goes to Room 236 and knocks on the door with the bear mace can]
GUEST 1
[a man, opens the door] Yes?
CARTMAN
I'm looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?!
GUEST 2
[an elderly man in Room 233] Do you mind keepin' it down?
CARTMAN
[walks over to the second guest] Keep your mouth shut, brah!!
[Ike and the teacher's room. Both of them react to something. In the distance, police sirens sound and get closer to the hotel. Miss Stevenson looks out the window and sees three police cruisers pull up to the hotel, right outside her window]
MISS STEVENSON
Oh no! Ike! [Ike climbs up to see the commotion] They're on to us!
IKE
Oh no!
MISS STEVENSON
Hurry darling! We have to get out of here!
[The hotel lobby. The police rush in]
OFFICERS
What have we got? What have we got?!
OFFICER 3
Who called 911?!
RECEPTIONIST
They went that way. [points in the direction Kyle and Leeroy took. The concierge barfs continuously. The officers leave] Look out! They have bear mace!
[The hotel, upstairs. Kyle and Leeroy make the rounds on the third floor.]
LEEROY
[pounds at the door at Room 323] Open up! I'm with the Dawg! [pounds some more]
KYLE
Oh crap! [some officers round the corner at the far end of the hall]
OFFICER 4
[draws his gun] You freeze right there! [Kyle and Leeroy run in the other direction]
[The fifth floor. Miss Stevenson covers up and peeks into the hallway. She looks both ways, then steps out of the room]
MISS STEVENSON
Come on, darling! [Ike steps out and they beginning walking. Earl rounds the corner behind them and catches them]
EARL
Hey! [they stop and the camera zooms in on Earl.] Uh I got 'em, Dawg. Fifth floor!
CARTMAN
Praise Christ! Let's go! [the elderly man is convulsing from the effects of the bear mace.]
MISS STEVENSON
Ike, run! [back on the second floor, Cartman and Beth run down a hallway]
CARTMAN
Bear mace that guy! And that guy! [Beth maces another bellboy and a guest as she and Cartman run by. Police officers round the corner and run after them]
[The roof. Miss Stevenson and Ike have made it all the way to the top. Cartman, Beth and Earl show up behind them and run out onto the roof. Police officers show up behind them and run out onto the roof]
CARTMAN
Freeze, bitch!
OFFICER 5
Freeze!
OFFICER 6
Hands up! Hands up!
OFFICER 7
Don't move! Don't move!
CARTMAN
It's all right! There's been a misunderstanding! I'm a hall monitor. [the officers are somewhat stunned] This fugitive is trying to avoid a hallway infraction by skipping off to Milan.
OFFICER 8
Hey, that is the teacher we just got the report about. [she and Ike back up slowly, towards the roof's edge. Kyle and Leeroy show up]
OFFICER 5
[through his bullhorn] All right, Miss Stevenson, you got nowhere to go!
MISS STEVENSON
Why couldn't you just leave us alone? All we wanted was to love.
CARTMAN
Get down! We can do this the easy way, or we can do it Dawg-style!
LEEROY
She gawt a scarf awn her heyed, huh?
MISS STEVENSON
It's all over, Ike. Milan, the house in Tuscany. They'll never let us be together! We have to go with the backup plan. [she and Ike walk to the roof's edge and look down at the ground]
OFFICER 5
[through his bullhorn] Now hold on, don't do anything foolish! We can talk about this!
MISS STEVENSON
[returns from the edge with Ike] You can't accept our love? So then we can only be together in eternity.
KYLE
[steps through Cartman and Beth towards Ike] No! Ike, don't do it!
IKE
I don deser futty bad man.
KYLE
Ike, please. I know your first love seems like the only love, but trust me, it's not. You have so much life ahead of you. [Ike looks at Kyle intently]
MISS STEVENSON
You who don't believe in true love don't understand.
KYLE
Ike, you need to have a life. Have fun. Then ruin it by having a serious relationship. [Ike thinks it over]
MISS STEVENSON
I'm afraid you're too late. [to Ike] Are you ready, my love? [she and Ike turn around and run for the edge] Here we go! One, two, three, aaaahhh! [she jumps over the edge, Ike turns back and walks towards Kyle. She looks up at the roof's edge] Ike?? [she lands on her back and dies on impact]
IKE
Yaaaay!
KYLE
Ike!
CARTMAN
[moves towards the camera] Well, looks like once again, the Dawg has prevailed. I hope you've learned, kids, that if you don't go with Christ, you could end up just like that splattered bitch down on the pavement.
OFFICER 6
Hey kid, you need to get off the roof now.
CARTMAN
That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways. [walks towards the camera to turn it off.]
End of Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Satan is throwing the biggest Halloween costume party ever. Just like a girl getting ready for her sweet sixteen, every detail must be perfect for the prince of darkness. The antics of the most notorious serial killers of all time threaten his fun.

script:Hell on Earth 2006

[Hell, outside Satan's castle.]
[Hell, inside the castle. Satan is seated on his throne with two lava fountains behind him, one on either side. Before each fountain is a pile of bleached skulls. Before the throne is a semicircular table with six elder demons sitting behind it. Nine steps lead up to the throne]
SATAN
[slow and deliberate] Halloween is a night for evil. It is time for me to take what is mine.
DEMON 1
[the pale one] What do you plan, Lord Satan?
SATAN
On Halloween we shall open the Gates of Hell, rise up to the earth, and we will rent out the entire W Hotel, for an awesome party, and invite a bunch of celebrities!
DEMON 2
[second from right] How big a party are we talking?
SATAN
Have you seen those rich, spoiled, teenage girls who have massive Sweet 16 parties? That big.
DEMON 2
Satan, we can't possibly do-
SATAN
SILENCE! [descends from his thrown to the floor] Halloween is about me! And I deserve a par-ty! This... shall be MY Super Sweet 16!! [raises his arms up in victory and laughs heartily. A few blasts of steam pop out of volcanoes and the citizens of Hell are frightened. Satan's image appears in the smoke] Minions of Hell! The time has come for us to rise! For my Super Sweet 16 Halloween party!! [the minions look at each other] I got Bacardi, and Ghetto One to sponsor the party, and I'm calling it [a poster for the event appears] Hell On Earth 2006! [everyone yells approval] But now, heed my words: in order to get in to the party, you have to RSVP and get a blue wristband. Everyone is gonna try and get into this party, so if you don't get your wristband in advance, or you're not wearing that wristband at the door, you're NOT GETTING IN!! [the volcanoes fire off another batch of smoke and the minions tremble] And NOW know this: It's a costume party, so you have to wear a costume. BUT... nobody better show up as The Crow! I'm serious. Every costume party there's like fourteen guys come dressed like the Crow 'cause they wanna look hot and hook up. It's lame! If you come dressed as the Crow, you're NOT GETTING IN to the party!! [the volcanoes fire off another batch of smoke and the minions tremble] Go now and prepare!! If you miss my party you are a looozer!! [laughs miniacally and vanishes. The minions tremble once more]
GEORGE BURNS
Oh boy, a Halloween party up on Earth.
GHANDI
I can't believe he got the entire W Hotel.
PRINCESS DIANA
This is going to be the best Halloween ever. [Other minions raise their arms and cheer]
[Stan's house, night. The house looks darker than normal, but that could be because the lights are on and jack-o'lanterns decorate the windows and the steps outside.]
[Stan's House, bathroom, in the dark. The boys has turned it into something of a temple, with candles on the vanity to make it look like an altar, and another two candles on the toilet seat cover. Kyle is in there with five other students: Stan, Cartman, Butters, Tolkien, and Tweek. Kyle looks at the mirror.]
STAN
Go ahead, Kyle, do it.
KYLE
[glances defiantly at Stan] I am doing it.
TWEEK
No! Don't do it!
CARTMAN
What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times.
KYLE
[blinking rather quickly] Biggie. Smalls... Biggie Smalls...
CARTMAN
See? You're scared. Because you know if you say it a third time, he's gonna show up and shoot you in the face. [starts imitating a hen's cluck]
KYLE
Fine! [hops off the stool and walks past Cartman] Then YOU do it, you're so tough!
CARTMAN
I've done it lots of times.
KYLE
[pushes Cartman to the stool] Prove it!
CARTMAN
[now on the stool facing the mirror, laughs a bit] Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... This is dumb, you guys, let's do somethin' else.
KYLE
You're afraid to do it, too.
CARTMAN
I am not!
BUTTERS
Then do it, if you're not yellow! [Cartman is shocked that Butters talked to him this way, so he raises a fist as if he's about to punch him in the face. Butters flinches.]
CARTMAN
[turns back to the mirror] Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... [the door opens and Jimmy enters]
JIMMY
Hey fellas. [Cartman freaks out and falls from the stool.] You should come downstairs. Stan's mom made pa-pizza.
THE OTHER BOYS
[rushing out of the bathroom] Let's go. Yeah, let's go!
CARTMAN
Oh my God. I crapped my pants. [feels his ass through his pants to be sure] You guys, I crapped my pants! [thinks, then leaves the bathroom] Heheh. You guys! You guys, check it out!
[Back at Hell's castle, Satan gazes at his crystal ball. The pale demon enters.]
DEMON 1
Satan, I must speak with thee.
SATAN
[turns around] What is it?
DEMON 1
You've invited so many celebrities on Earth to your party that people in Hell can't get wristbands.
SATAN
Well I have to invite celebrities or else my party won't be cool.
DEMON 1
Satan, I warn thee, do not throw this party at the cost of alienating your friends.
SATAN
[childishly] I'm not alienating my friends! I know they come first!
DEMON 1
I hope for your sake that's true. You've never thrown a party of this magnitude before, Satan. Be wary. [turns and leaves]
[Cathedral of Our Lady Of the Angels, morning. Inside, Cardinal Mahoney addresses a group of Church leaders]
CARDINAL MAHONEY
Halloween has always been a time of evil and darkness. But now it appears that Satan will literally be among us. He is bringing Hell here to Los Angeles, and from what we understand, the gathering is going to be... completely off the hook. [the clergymen begin to murmur amongst themselves] There's more: None of us... are invited. [the murmurs get louder]
BISHOP 1
None?
BISHOP 2
Satan mocks us.
BISHOP 3
His party must be stopped.
PRIEST 1
Yes, we cannot let evil take over our city, even for a night. [he's holding a leash... which has a small naked boy at the other end of it.]
PRIEST 2
[an old priest with his own boy] What can we do? [more boys on leashes begin to appear]
RESIDENT BISHOP
Tomorrow night, after all of Satan's guests have arrived, we'll call in a complaint about how many people are there. We'll see how long Satan's party lasts... after the fire marshal shows up.
[Butters' house, bathroom. Butters is brushing his teeth for the night. He's wearing some Wonder Bread footie pajamas.]
BUTTERS
That's why I like to brush my teeth; I know they're clean and white. All the [begins to choke on the words and spits out some toothpaste] I truly love to brush my teeth. [smiles, then frowns. He looks around, then] Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... [hesitates a bit] Biggie Smalls... [a second later, Biggie materializes behind Butters]
BIGGIE SMALLS
What the fuck is THIS?!
BUTTERS
AAAAH! [dodges the bullets Biggie begins firing at him.]
BIGGIE SMALLS
Hey! [Butters falls off the stool and gets up, runs to the bathroom door and gets out without getting any bullets in him, and makes his way to the front door.]
BUTTERS
[runs outside] WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! [his parents pull into the driveway just as Butters leaves the front steps, and get out of the car]
STEPHEN
Butters! We told you to be in bed! What are you doing?!
BUTTERS
I summoned Biggie Smalls, the hip-hop rapper!
STEPHEN
You had a nightmare! Turn around and get back in your room right now!
BUTTERS
But Dad, he's gonna bust a cap in my ass!
STEPHEN
Well, you wanna get shot or you wanna be grounded?!
BUTTERS
AAAAAAAAAAH! [runs back up to his room]
STEPHEN
[to his wife Linda] ...Honestly, why do let him watch that darn Black Entertainment Channel?
[The W Hotel. Satan is present with his chief demons and the head W staffers.]
SATAN
So I want the DJ to set up over here, and then the main dance floor area can be this whole area right here.
MALE STAFFER
What about valets? Ha, how will people be arriving from Hell?
SATAN
Oh, it's like a dimensional vortex gate thingy, they won't have cars.
FEMALE STAFFER
Buut we're probably gonna want security at the dimensional vortex gate.
SATAN
I want all the servers dressed in skimpy outfits serving all the hors d'oeuvres.
DEMON 1
This is getting really expensive.
SATAN
Shut up, it's Halloween! This is my night! Then at midnight, for dessert, I'm thinking over here, we bring out a huuuge chocolate fondue fountain.
MALE STAFFER
Oh yeah, P Diddy had his birthday party here a couple years back and he had one of those.
SATAN
Oh, screw that, then. I don't want a fondue fountain if P Diddy had one.
DEMON 1
[between his teeth] Does it matter?!
SATAN
Yes it matters! I don't wanna do it if Diddy did it!
DEMON 1
How about a doughnut machine?
SATAN
Did Diddy do it?
MALE STAFFER
Diddy did do it.
SATAN
A full ice cream bar!
MALE STAFFER
Diddy did it.
SATAN
[steps forward in frustration] Damnit, what didn't Diddy do?! [thinks a moment] Wait. I know. [turns right] Yes. It's perfect. At midnight, all the lights go down. The music stops. And then we wheel in... a Ferrari. Only it isn't a Ferrari... It's a cake. And everyone gets a piece.
DEMON 1
A Ferrari cake?
MALE STAFFER
Diddy didn't do it.
DEMON 1
Satan, really, the logistics of getting a cake the size of a Ferrari made in time-
SATAN
[spins around] This party has to be the bomb! Don't you get it?! [turns around] When everyone sees the Ferrari cake, [makes a fist and says in a low voice] they will shudder and know my greatness!
DEMON 3
Hear me, demons! Lord Satan has demanded a Ferrari cake! Now I will take charge of Halloween, and call upon the spirits of Hell's most evil souls! Ted Bundy! [walks into view] Jeffrey Dahmer! [walks into view] And John Wayne Gacy! [walks into view. Each entrance is accompanied by newspaper clippings and actual background shots of their faces] You shall rise once again to walk the earth, for tomorrow is Halloween, and I need you... to pick up Satan's Ferrari cake, and deliver it to the W Hotel!
BUNDY
No problem.
DAHMER
We can handle it.
DEMON 3
Heed my words: Satan's entire Halloween depends on this Ferrari cake. Fail, and you will know his greatest wrath!
[Butters' room, later. He slowly opens his door and looks inside. Quickly, he enters and closes the door, then begins to sneak across the room. He feels a gun against his head and looks up]
SMALLS
You punkass fool!
BUTTERS
Haaaah.
SMALLS
Why'd you summon me?
BUTTERS
P-please don't ice me, homie?
SMALLS
You'd better have a good reason, sucka!
BUTTERS
I just... w-was seein' if it works.
SMALLS
[lowers the pistol and walks away] Damn! Every Halloween I gots tuh deal with this shit! I'm in hell, mindin' my own business, and the next thing I know, I'm in some kid's bafroom.
BUTTERS
[scared] I Iii, I apologize, Mr. Smalls.
SMALLS
[returns and places the tip of the gun against Butters' forehead] You don't understand, fool! I ain't missin' the party!
BUTTERS
W-what party?
SMALLS
I already got my wristband, see? [lowers the gun and shows off the blue wristband Satan was passing out] You've got to get me to Los Angeles!
BUTTERS
Uh whah well can't you just take a plane?
SMALLS
How, punk?! We don't use money in here, ni**a!
BUTTERS
Well damn, ni**er, there's gotta be some way!
SMALLS
[places the tip of the gun against Butters' forehead again] This is your fault, homie! You've gots to get me to that party in L.A., or i'm gonna smoke your ass!
BUTTERS
Oh hamburgers!
[Satan's castle. Some of his advisors come to talk to him...]
DEMON 1
Yes. Yes, Satan. Your Halloween costume turned out perfect.
SATAN
[dressed as the Crow] Yeah, it's okay, but everyone thinks Zazul's schoolgirl costume is hotter.
ZAZUL
[Deomn 3] Ehhhhhhh.
SATAN
Zazul, switch costumes with me.
DEMON 1
Satan, Zazul worked really hard on his costume.
SATAN
Nobody can look hotter than me! It's my Super Sweet 16 Halloween party! Take it off, Zazul. [dejected, Zazul walks away slowly] And what about my Ferrari cake?! Where's the Ferrari cake?!
DEMON 1
Relax, it's being picked up from the bakery.
[Montage, to the tune of Yello's "Oh Yeah." The bakers have made a life-size replica of a Ferrari and are now decorating it. The bakery in question is Napoleon Bakery. Bundy, Dahmer, and Gacy appear at the door]
BUNDY
[looking at a map] All right, this is the place. Now remember, you numbskulls, this Ferrari cake is really important for Satan's party, so don't louse it up!
DAHMER
[as Larry] Who's lousing?
BUNDY
[as Moe] Come 'ere. [Dahmer draws near, Bundy slaps him] Shut up! [Bundy opens the doors and the three killers go inside]
HEAD BAKER
Can I help you?
BUNDY
We're here to pick up the Ferrari cake.
HEAD BAKER
Ohhh yes, it's just about finished. What kind of truck are we loading it up to?
BUNDY
We got that flatbed. [Gacy whips out a butcher knife]
HEAD BAKER
Okay well, we're just gonna need to- GYAAAH! [Gacy has just impaled him and begins to slice his body in two by moving the knife towards his head]
BUNDY
Gacy, you numbskull, what'd ya kill him for?!
GACY
[as Curly] I didn't mean tuh. [a second baker comes out of the kitchen]
BUNDY
Give me that! [takes the knife from him and smacks him upside the head]
GACY
Oh!
BUNDY
What's the matter with you?! [hands the knife to Dahmer] Take this!
BAKER 2
Everything all right? [Dahmer stabs him in the throat with the knife.] Bwa! Gaaaghaghaghagh!
BUNDY
You nincompoop! [bops him on the head]
DAHMER
Ow.
BUNDY
That was the baker!
DAHMER
He startled me.
BUNDY
[looks to his left] Gacy! [goes into the kitchen, where Gacy is stabbing away at a third baker] What'dja kill him for?! [bops him on the head] Siddonw!
GACY
I'm a victim of circumstance. [Dahmer bops him on the head]
BUNDY
[grabs Dahmer by the back of the head] Ahh, who're you hittin'? [picks him in the eyes.]
DAHMER
Ohhhh... [stumbles away]
GACY
Nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk. [Bundy smacks him] Oh!
BUNDY
[to Dahmer] Get outta here. [to Gacy] Be quiet. [Gacy makes like he's rubbing blood from his face as he groans] You idiots! Now who's gonna help us load the Ferrari cake onto the flatbed?!
[Butters' house, later. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Jimmy, Tweek, and Tolkien are with Butters, and their parents are behind them. Stan's parents are not there. The police have arrived to talk to Butters' parents]
OFFICER
Did your son say anything before he disappeared, Mrs. Stotch?
LINDA
He just said something about... summoning Biggie Smalls... [upon hearing this, the other boys know what happened and look at each other.]
CARTMAN
Dude...
JIMMY
Du... du... dude.
[Stan's house, moments later.]
STAN
[rushes into the living room with the other boys] Dad! Dad!
RANDY
[reading his newspaper on the sofa] What?
STAN
If you look in the mirror and say Biggie Smalls' name three times, he doesn't come and get you, right??
RANDY
[thinks a moment] Biggie Smalls?
CARTMAN
You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen, sippin' on booze at the House of Blues
RANDY
[folds his paper up and rises] All right, boys, I know it's Halloween, but you can't summon dead rappers in the mirror.
CARTMAN
How do you know??
RANDY
I'm a geologist! [leaves]
KYLE
He's right. It's just a spooky story.
TWEEK
Hguh. Then how come you couldn't do it?
KYLE
I can do it. It just got... look, it just doesn't matter, because it's not true.
CARTMAN
How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn't with Biggie right now? Being tormented by him?
[Up in the sky. A jet plane heads towards Los Angeles]
BUTTERS
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh, yeah, I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh-
SMALLS
Yo dawg, keep it down.
BUTTERS
Yo dawg, uh, can't I just go back home right after the flight so I don't get grounded?
SMALLS
Oh no! YOU summoned my spirit, YOU're gettin' me all the way to the party! As long as I get to the party in time to party, everything'll be all right. [begins to vanish] Hey! [Smalls is gone]
[Kyle's bathroom. The boys are assembled once again to summon Biggie Smalls]
KYLE
...Smalls. [Smalls materializes]
SMALLS
Oh, God-damnit! [the boys scream and run out of the bathroom, leaving Kyle on the stool]
STAN
It does work!!
KYLE
Holy crap!!
SMALLS
[pulls out his gun...] That's it! Now I'm pissed! [...and begins firing away. Kyle and Tolkien are the last to leave.]
[The W, moments later. Klieg lights are lit up and light up the night as guests arrive. The camera pans around showing the costumed people waiting outside and the party scene inside. Pumpkin disco balls spin around slowly from the ceiling. Two bartenders mix drinks. A large poster of Satan is up on a wall, a DJ spins records.]
GEORGE BURNS
Hehey, everybody. Check out Hitler. [Hitler appears with a cell phone attached to his ear] He's the "Can you hear me now?" guy. [the minions around him laugh]
HITLER
[moves from spot to spot and asks] Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now? [the minions around him laugh again]
SATAN
[introducing himself] Everyone quiet! Here he is, the man of the night, SATAN! [four Chippendale men enter, two with leather pants and two with leather briefs, carrying Satan on a litter. Satan is seated on his throne dressed as a girl celebrating her Sweet 16 party. Adolf Hitler wanders by still testing out that cell phone] Get out of the way, Hitler! You're ruining my entrance! Gaau!
[Outside, across the street from the hotel entrance, some Catholic clergy have gathered around a pay phone. Cardinal Roger Mahoney places a call]
CARDINAL MAHONEY
Yes, hello? It this the fire department? [the other clergy whisper and remind him what to say, he whispers back] Wait, shh, shh, shh. [normal voice] I need to make a complaint to the fire marshal. [listens for the reply] He's what? Where? [soon hangs up, having gotten nowhere] Damn your evil heart, Satan!!
RESIDENT BISHOP
What?
CARDINAL MAHONEY
The Fire Marshal is at the party! Satan invited him!
PRIEST
Satan's trickery knows no bounds!
CARDINAL MAHONEY
That's it! One way or another, we're crashing this party!
[Back at the party. Satan is talking to a bouncer]
SATAN
This is VIP. Don't just let anybody into my VIP area, okay? [the bouncer walks away and an elderly minion arrives]
FRANK SINATRA
Hey, Satan, you got a little problem.
SATAN
What?
FRANK SINATRA
Somebody showed up in a Crocodile Hunter costume. It's really offending some of the other guests.
SATAN
Oh jeez. [walks over to the offending guest, who happens to be none other than Steve Irwin, with a stingray attached to his chest. Steve looks around with a smile on his face. Satan arrives] Hey, uh, hi, listen, dude, ya know, the whole Crocodile Hunter thing? It... it's just a little soon, you know? I mean, he just dies a few weeks ago and... it's just not supercool and you gotta leave.
STEVE IRWIN
But it's me, Satan. Steve Irwin. I am the Crocodile Hunter.
SATAN
[thinks a moment] Oh... oh, but then, dude, no costume. Sorry, you gotta go. [two bouncers come and escort him away]
STEVE IRWIN
Wait! I thought we were friends!
SATAN
[watches Irwin leave, then] Oh hey, Sinatra! [walks away]
MALE STAFFER
Demonius! [approaches a minion wearing a Captain America outfit] Demonius, we have a problem!
DEMONIUS
[the pale elder demon, lifts up his mask] What is it?
MALE STAFFER
The Ferrari cake! It isn't here!
DEMONIUS
What?? Don't even tell me that!
MALE STAFFER
It was never delivered to the hotel.
DEMONIUS
Deva! Fetch my Blackberry! That Ferrari cake must get here by midnight! [lowers his mask and moves on]
[a short pops up - The Three Murderers, using music from The Three Stooges]
[The scene is the Napoleon Bakery. Gacy and Dahmer guide the Ferrari cake onto the flatbed. Bundy is at the controls. A man walks by and stops to watch]
MAN
Do you gentlemen need a hand? [Gacy and Dahmer look; Gacy runs over, jumps on him and stabs him to death with a knife. Bundy notices, jumps out of the crane and runs over]
BUNDY
Gacy! [Gacy jumps off the man and cleans the knife quickly] Whatcha do that foor?!
GACY
I did it for Dahmer.
BUNDY
For Dahmer?
GACY
Yeah. He likes havin' sex with dead bodies. [Dahmer is shown pumping away, from the elbow up]
BUNDY
Dahmer! Stop havin' sex with them intestines!
DAHMER
What good are intestines if you can't have sex with them?
BUNDY
[slaps Dahmer hard] We gotta get rid of this body before anyone sees it! [brings out a portable saw and begins sawing the body to bits. The crane continues moving the cake around, and no one is at the controls. Bundy finishes cutting up the body] Now get those to the trashcan! [Gacy has the man's head, Dahmer has the man's left forearm and starts eating it] Stop eating that! [takes the forearm and slaps him with it.]
GACY
Leave him alone! [Bundy slaps him with the forearm] Unh!
BUNDY
Cut it! [punches Gacy in the belly] Come 'ere, ya. [takes Dahmer's right hand and places it under Gacy's chin, then forces an upper cut with his own fist]
DAHMER, GACY
Oh! [both men then take their right hands and move them up an imaginary pole]
DAHMER
There. [Bundy punches them both in the belly and the nose] Oh. [the cable snaps and the cake drops down a bit] The cake! [the pulley is undone and the cake flips over and hits the ground. Pieces of it fly everywhere. The three murderers are covered in it]
BUNDY
Oh no!
GACY
Mmm, Ferrari.
BUNDY
[smacks him] What's the matter with you?! It's ruined!
DAHMER
We're gonna get it now.
[Back at the party...]
A GUEST
This is a really extravagant party, Satan.
SATAN
I know, but just wait till midnight. You are not gonna believe what's coming for desert! [laughs heartily]
[The entrance. The bouncers let a Conehead and a maid enter, and the Catholic clergy are next in line. They show their wristbands, which are yellow, not blue]
BLACK BOUNCER
Uh, these aren't the right wristbands.
A BISHOP
Uh, yes they are.
WHITE BOUNCER
Then how come they say "Knott's Berry Farm"? [the clergy get restless, the bouncers hold them back]
CARDINAL MAHONEY
In the name of Christ, just let us in!
[Denver International Airport. The other six boys are now going to Satan's party with Biggie Smalls. Kyle is ordering the tickets]
STAN
We're really sorry, Mr. Smalls.
SMALLS
Not as sorry as you're gonna be, if I completely miss the party!
TICKET AGENT
Here you go, flight 72 to Los Angeles boarding in 10 minutes.
KYLE
[gets the ticket and goes back to Smalls] See? You can still make it for the end of the party.
SMALLS
Yeah, I'm just gonna be pissed if I miss- [begins to vanish again] What the? No! No!
[Stan's bathroom. Randy is now summoning Biggie Smalls]
RANDY
...Smalls. [Bigge Smalls materializes behind him] No way!
SMALLS
Motherfucking God-damnit!
RANDY
That's pretty cool. Hey, Hey Sharon!
SMALLS
Cool this, sucka! [begins firing at Randy, who's grazed by a few bullets but runs out of the bathroom.]
[A second Three Murderers short. This time, the murderers have dressed as chefs so they can make the Ferrari cake themselves]
BUNDY
All right, listen you mugs! It's now 11:30. That means we only have twenty minutes to bake a new Ferrari cake.
DAHMER
No problem! It just so happens that I went to an Italian cooking school.
BUNDY
Yeah? Why'd you quit?
DAHMER
There weren't enough Italians to eat. [a second later Bundy smacks him across the face]
GACY
Nyak nyak nyak nyak nya-eh [Bundy moves his hand in front of Gacy and then moves it around his head] Nyaaa nyaaaa
BUNDY
Get over here! [pulls Gacy by the left ear. Dahmer follows. They go to a clean, ready counter] All right, what's the recipe call for first?
DAHMER
Ten thousand eggs.
BUNDY
Gacy, go get ten thousand eggs.
GACY
You get 'em!
BUNDY
[bops him on the head] Shut up!
GACY
Nyaaaaa! [pokes Bundy in the left eye]
BUNDY
Oh! Ohh, wise guy, ey? [pokes both of Gacy's eyes out, leaving him with bleeding sockets]
GACY
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
BUNDY
How's that?
DAHMER
Hey! Leave him alone! [gets the knife and stabs him in the ribs]
BUNDY
AAA!
DAHMER
[sticks his tongue out at Bundy] Nehhh!
BUNDY
Try that again!
DAHMER
[sticks his tongue out at Bundy again] Nehhh! [Bundy grabs the tongue and cuts it right out with a knife]
GACY
What happened??
BUNDY
Shut up! [smacks Gacy with Dahmer's tongue. Dahmer sticks a knife in Bundy's chin, making him fall down. Gacy with loss of eyesight smacks Dahmer's head open with a rolling pin, leaving his brains pouring out]
[A men's room in the hotel. Various costumed men are there looking at a man dressed as John Elway tries to summon Biggie Smalls, daring him all the while]
COWBOY
He can't do it, he can't do it.
JOHN ELWAY
All right, be quiet. [laughs] Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... [the others crowd in for the payoff] Oh I can't do it! I'm too freaked out. [the others laugh at him as he leaves the restroom]
[Back at the hotel...]
MALE STAFFER
What do we do?? It's midnight. The Ferrari cake never arrived!
ZAZUL
This is terrible!
DEMONIUS
[rushes up] It's okay! It's okay! [lifts up his mask] I found a backup! Go ahead and start the ceremony! [the music dies out and the lights go down]
ZAZUL
[through the party's speakers] Your attention please: It is now midnight! Time for Satan's special surprise. [the guests gather around a raised platform]
A GUEST
I wonder what this is going to be.
SATAN
[in a low voice, making a fist] Just you wait. [the sound of revving car engines play through the speaker system. The doors open and the surprise is revealed] Yes. Here it comes. [the car is rolled into place and begins rotating counterclockwise]
ZAZUL
Ladies and gentlemen: a fully edible Acura cake! [the guests cheer, not knowing what Satan really wanted]
SATAN
Acura?? But I wanted a Ferrari! [Zazul and Demonius are quickly at his side]
DEMONIUS
We did the best we could; there was a problem.
ZAZUL
Acuras are really nice.
SATAN
IT'S NOT THE CAR I WANTED! THE WHOLE PARTY'S RUINED! [one swing of his left arm and Zazul flies out of the picture]
DEMONIUS
It doesn't matter. Your guests are having fun. They don't care.
SATAN
[jumps up and down] IT'S NOT ABOUT THEM, IT'S ALL ABOUT MEEEEEEE!!! [his voice echoes throughout the hotel and no one says a word for several seconds]
FRANK SINATRA
Wow, what a jerk.
A COWBOY
Come on, Helen. Let's just go back to hell. I'm suddenly not so hungry for Acura cake.
SATAN
Oh God, what's happened to me? I've never been this terrible before. By trying to have a party like those spoiled rich teenage girls on MTV, I've become like one of them.
ZAZUL
[returns] Satan, don't be so hard on yourself. You're not as bad as they are.
SATAN
But I am. Throwing people out, making a big entrance, having these stupid pictures of me all over. Halloween is supposed to be for everyone. Everybody, I'm sorry. This party is for you. It's for all of you who make my life so special. If I don't realize that, then I'm no better than a rich American teenage girl. [the guest begin to applaud the speech] Open the doors! Let everyone in, wristband or no! [everyone cheers at this and the waiting guests rush in, including the Catholic clergy and their naked boys on leashes. Butters appears in the crowd and stops a catwoman powdering herself]
[Outside]
BUTTERS
Uhh, excuse me. uh ma'am, can I borrow that? [she hands him her mirror, and he looks into it] Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls. [Smalls materializes next to him]
SMALLS
What the-?
BUTTERS
Thanks. [hands the mirror back to the catwoman, and she enters the party]
SMALLS
I am soo sick of this! Wait, I'm at the party.
BUTTERS
Sure, homie. I got your back, yo.
SMALLS
[happily] And it's not too late. Hey, why don't you come in with me?
BUTTERS
Wull what the heck? I'm gonna get grounded anyway, might as well. [they both enter the party happily]
[Inside. Butters is dancing with everyone else, the priests dance with their naked boys, Satan dances with Captain America.]
End of Hell on Earth 2006


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:South Park Elementary faces strong opposition to the topic of evolution. Cartman's too busy to notice as he plans to propel himself into the future on the precise release date of the newest, hottest game console.

script:Go God Go

[South Park Mall, dawn. One red car is seen on the parking lot.]
[EV Games. Advertisements for the upcoming Nintendo Wii are plastered all over the windows. Cartman paces the floor in front of the store]
CARTMAN
[under his breath] Come ohhhn! Come ohhhn! Oh, for the love of God, how much longer?! [his mom arrives]
LIANE
There you are, Eric. What are you doing here?
CARTMAN
I'm waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out.
LIANE
When does it come out?
CARTMAN
Three weeks. Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!
LIANE
[takes him by the hand] It's time for school.
CARTMAN
[yanks his hand away and runs back to the store] No Mom, you don't understand! I've been waiting for this thing to come out for months. And now, every day time is slowing down. It's like... waiting for Christmas... times a thousand.
LIANE
Eric, you're just going to have to be patient. [pulls him away again]
CARTMAN
Noo!! Nooo!!
[South Park Elementary, day. Mrs. Garrison's voice is heard]
MRS. GARRISON
Principal Victoria, it is wrong! [she's at the principal's office, her back to the principal's desk.] It is wrong and I simply will not do it! [walks back to the desk] I care about my students, and I will not fill their heads with lies! [pounds the desk for emphasis] I am NOT teaching evolution in my class!! [Mr. Mackey is also present]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Mrs. Garrison, evolution is in the school curriculum. We have to teach it.
MRS. GARRISON
Evolution is a theory! A hare-brained theory that says I'm a monkey! I am not a monkey!! I'm a woman!
MR. MACKEY
M, m'kay. Ya-you realize evolution has been pretty much uhhh... proven.
MRS. GARRISON
I warn you, Principal Victoria! Those students are not prepared to hear this stuff!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Our students want to learn, Mrs. Garrison, and they're mature enough to handle anything.
[Mrs. Garrison's classroom, later. The kids are chatting and moving about the classroom. Cartman is blabbering incoherently]
CARTMAN
How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?!
STAN
It's still three weeks.
CARTMAN
Oh God... [shivers like someone in withdrawal] Okay, how long now?
KYLE
Will you shut up already?! [Mrs. Garrison enters and isn't too happy about her lesson]
MRS. GARRISON
All right kids, it is now my job to teach you the theory of evolution.
BUTTERS
Oh boy!
MRS. GARRISON
Now I, for one, think evolution is a bunch of BULL CRAP. [nobody says anything] But I've been told I have to teach it anyway. It was thought up by Charles Darwin and it goes something like this: [goes up to a large poster of evolution and begins pointing things out with her pointer.] In the beginning we were all fish. Okay? Swimming around in the water. And then one day a couple of fish had a retard baby, and the retard baby was different, so it got to live. So Retard Fish goes on to make more retard babies, and then one day, a retard baby fish crawled out of the ocean with its [waves his left hand limply] mutant fish hands... and it had butt sex with a squirrel or something and made this. [points to a rodent] retard frog squirrel, and then that had a retard baby which was a... monkey fish-frog... And then this monkey fish-frog had butt sex with that monkey, and... that monkey had a mutant retard baby that screwed another monkey and... that made you! [faces the class. A new girl is seated in the front row, looking around] So there you go! You're the retarded offspring of five monkeys having butt sex with a fish-squirrel! Congratulations!
CARTMAN
[hopping out of his chair and running out] HEHHH! I can't take it anymore! HAAAAAH!
MRS. GARRISON
Yeah? You see? I knew that would happen.
[EV Games, next time. Cartman again paces the floor in front of the store.]
CARTMAN
Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn! [a store clerk notices and walks over]
CLERK
Look, kid, for the fortieth time, pacing in front of the store isn't gonna make the Wii come any faster. [he goes back inside, and Liane walks up]
LIANE
Eric, you're coming home right now!
CARTMAN
Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer?
LIANE
It's almost bedtime. If you sleep then time'll go by faster.
[Cartman's room, night. He's sprawled out on his bed in his pajamas, his eyes open. He can't sleep, tossing and turning every few seconds. He looks at his clock: 2:15.]
CARTMAN
Oh God!
[He throws himself back on the bed and squeezes his eyes shut. He peeks at the clock, then squeezes his eyes shut again, turns over... Moments later he's on his pillow, his left leg dangling over the foot of the bed. Next, he's on his belly, looking over the foot of the bed. Next, he's tossing and turning, and sees the time now: 2:16. He gets up and walks to the wall calendar, where he has Nov. 19 marked - a Sunday, the day the Wii comes out. Halloween is marked off, so it's now less than three weeks. He logs onto the Internet and fires up his browser - he gets an ad for the Wii, coming in three weeks. He's now downstairs watching early-morning TV. He paces in front of the TV, then heads for the fridge. Finding nothing to eat, he goes back upstairs and looks at the clock in his room: 2:18. He throws down the clock and throws a fit]
CARTMAN
Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!!
[The bus stop, later in the morning. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are waiting for the bus.]
CARTMAN
You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me.
STAN
Dude you don't look so good, Cartman.
CARTMAN
I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.
KYLE
Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient.
CARTMAN
[assertively] No. There is something I can do.
KENNY
(What?)
CARTMAN
All right, listen: you know how in space movies they put astronauts in suspender animation so that their trip seems really short, right? [turns around] I think I figured out how to do it.
STAN
Do what?
CARTMAN
Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me.
KYLE
No.
CARTMAN
It's simple science, Kyle.
KYLE
You'll die, retard!
CARTMAN
I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!!
STAN
Dude, no way.
KYLE
Yeah, I hate you, but I'm not going to help kill you.
CARTMAN
I thought you were my friends! I guess I was wrong! After everything we've been through together, you guys won't even help me freeze myself! [walks away in a huff]
[South Park Elementary, day. The new girl, her parents, and Mrs. Garrison are in the principal's office.]
FATHER
Principal Victoria, we are a devout Catholic family! Do you mind telling me why my daughter now thinks she's a retarded fish-frog?!
MRS. GARRSION
I told you this would happen, didn't I?!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Mr. Triscotti, I wasn't aware that-
MR. TRISCOTTI
We have worked years to instill the teachings of Jesus Christ into our daughter, and in one fell swoop, you try to destroy everything we did!
MRS. GARRSION
I hear ya.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Sir, if you don't wish your daughter to learn about evolution, then we can pull her out of class.
MR. TRISCOTTI
You most certainly will!
DAUGHTER
But Dad, I want to learn everything.
MR. TRISCOTTI
No you don't! Shut up! [takes his daughter and leaves the room]
MRS. GARRSION
Well, I told you. We should leave evolution out of the classrooms.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
It has become obvious to me that you don't know enough about evolution to teach it! I'm having you replaced! Mr. Dawkins! [Mr. Dawkins enters the office]
MRS. GARRSION
Re-replaced??
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Richard Dawkins is a world-renowned evolutionary scientist.
MR. DAWKINS
[courteously] Charmed to meet you. Ms...
MRS. GARRSION
Shut up, faggot! Principal Victoria, I can teach my own class!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
You are to sit in class and help Mr. Dawkins with whatever he needs!
[Mrs. Garrison's classroom. Richard Dawkins is the guest teacher now. He takes some chalk and .]
MR. DAWKINS
Over billions of years life has evolved from simple one-celled organisms into all the complex life we see around us. [although all the kids have pencil and paper out ready to take notes, only Kyle is actually writing anything as Dawkins lectures. Mr. Dawkins himself delivers his lecture in a scholarly voice.]
MRS. GARRISON
Whatever.
MR. DAWKINS
[glances over, then continues] It was changes in hereditary traits that allowed the first mammals to breath in the air.
MRS. GARRISON
[relating Dawkin's points to his own] Retarded fish-frogs.
MR. DAWKINS
[a bit shocked] Ms. Garrison, I believe that's a gross over-simplification.
MRS. GARRISON
Well, you're a faggot! [the look of shock returns to Dawkins.] Continue.
MR. DAWKINS
You see, children, life has the amazing ability to change, to adapt. Like changing us to the point that we walk upright.
MRS. GARRISON
So you are saying that we're all related to monkeys.
MR. DAWKINS
[puts the chalk in the holder below the blackboard] Well yes, basically, we are.
MRS. GARRISON
Do you see monkeys at the zoo?! They crap in their hands and throw it at people!
MR. DAWKINS
Ms. Garrison, this isn't theory, it is scientific fact!
MRS. GARRISON
What about the fact that by believing this crap, you're gonna go to hell?! Doesn't that bother you a little?
MR. DAWKINS
Actually, no. Because I'm an atheist.
MRS. GARRISON
[rises and walks up to him] AHA! I've got you, you snake in the grass!! I found you out!!
MR. DAWKINS
I never covered it up.
MRS. GARRISON
And if I'm a monkey, then I might as well act like a monkey, huh?! [begins to dance around like a monkey, hooting and hollering. He lowers his pants and poops into his left hand.]
MR. DAWKINS
What on earth are you doing?? [now Butters is the one taking notes]
MRS. GARRISON
Don't ask me, I'm a fuckin' monkey!! [throws the log of feces at Dawkins and gets him on his forehead and on the left side of his sweater]
MR. DAWKINS
AAAH!
[The principal's office, once again.]
MRS. GARRISON
Principal Victoria, I was simply trying to make a point to Mr. Dawkins about the incongruity of some scientific statements.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Mrs. Garrison, I am pulling you out of the classroom.
MRS. GARRISON
What??
MR. DAWKINS
Principal Victoria, I really don't think that's necessary. This woman is very opinionated but, she does care about her students.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Very well. But there is to be no more throwing of feces. Understood??
[Waiting area outside the office. Garrison and Dawkins walk in]
MR. DAWKINS
Ms. Garrison. Ms. Garrison, could I have a word with you, please?
MRS. GARRISON
What?!
MR. DAWKINS
Look, I know you think we're at war, but I want you to know I admire your passion.
MRS. GARRISON
[softens immediately] You d-you do?
MR. DAWKINS
I've never met a woman with so much... fire
MRS. GARRISON
Well I... [begins preening] I do bring down a woman's wrath now and again. [slight giggle]
MR. DAWKINS
So much boldness in a woman. So beautiful. [snaps out of it] I'm sorry, I'm sure you have a husband, but I-
MRS. GARRISON
No! N-no! My, my husband is g-gone, dead.
MR. DAWKINS
Would you then... consider having dinner with me tonight?
MRS. GARRISON
Well, [preens again] well, I suppose we could have a little steak or something. [Dawkins smiles, Garrison smiles back]
[The hallway. Kids are milling around. Around the corner comes Mrs. Garrison, jumping joyfully]
MRS. GARRISON
I've got a date! I've got a date! My first real date with a real man since my sex-change operation! [skips away, towards the front doors] Oh boy, what'll I wear?! [opens the doors and skips out] Hey everybody!
[Cartman's house, day, kitchen. Humming, Liane enters the kitchen with groceries and snacks, including doughnuts. She sets them down on the counter, takes an ice cream and heads for the freezer. She opens the freezer door]
CARTMAN
[in the freezer] Ey!
LIANE
[jumps back in surprise, dropping the ice cream] Whoa!
CARTMAN
Close the door, I'm trying to freeze!
LIANE
Eric, get out of there. [tries to pull him out, but he kicks her hand away]
CARTMAN
[resisting all of Liane's efforts] No! No, it's too soon!
LIANE
[pulls him out of the freezer] Now Eric, this has gone far enough! [sets him down and goes down on a bended knee] You need to learn to be patient!
[A door opens and Butters appears. Before him is Cartman, dressed in heavy jacket. Cartman has some equipment on his back and an ice pick in his right hand.]
CARTMAN
Butters, get your coat. We gotta go.
BUTTERS
Go where?
CARTMAN
You're gonna help me freeze myself.
BUTTERS
[looks at Cartman a while, then] Okay. [walks away to get his coat, smiling]
[The Rockies, far from town. Two small figures walk forward in the snow. The camera gets progressively closer, and the figures turn out to be Cartman and Butters]
BUTTERS
Well, how come we've gotta come all the way out here?
CARTMAN
[stops and begins digging ] Butters, if anyone else comes upon my frozen body, they'll try to unfreeze me right away. [finishes digging a hole, tosses the ice pick away, and prepares to step down into it] I have to be hidden. [removes his jacket and gives it to Butters] That's good. [begins to gather the snow around him and then faces Butters, who's shocked at this turn of events] And no matter what happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?!
BUTTERS
Eric, are you sure this is a good idea?
CARTMAN
No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea
BUTTERS
[not so sure, casts his eyes down] Yeah...I guess it is...
CARTMAN
All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right?
BUTTERS
I got it. [looks around] Big Tree. Oval Rock.
CARTMAN
All right, now get out of here. You can't freeze too, or else we're both screwed. [Butters looks at Cartman once more, then leaves. Butters turns to look at Cartman again] Get out of here, you asshole! You're gonna ruin everything!
BUTTERS
Oh jeez! [turns around and walks away quickly]
CARTMAN
[all alone now] Yes. Come on. Freeeze. Freeeze.
[Buca di Faggoncini, evening. Mr. Dawkins and Mrs. Garrison are having dinner there.]
MRS. GARRISON
So I told my gynecologist, "you put so many things in my vagina, maybe I should charge you!" [they both laugh at the story.]
MR. DAWKINS
Oh, Ms. Garrison, you are the most outspoken woman I have ever met! It's almost like you're one of the guys.
MRS. GARRISON
Hehyeah, almost.
MR. DAWKINS
You have so much spunk, so much life... If only you were an atheist.
MRS. GARRISON
Well... Well, you know, I'm... I'm open to stuff.
MR. DAWKINS
Why is someone as outspoken as you given themselves over to the whole God thing?
MRS. GARRISON
Oh I'm not... I'm not totally into the whole God thing. I just... I just think, you know, you can't disprove God.
MR. DAWKINS
Well what if I told you there was a flying spaghetti monster: Would you believe it simply because it can't be disproven?
MRS. GARRISON
[Thinks a moment] You're riiight. It's so simple! God is a spaghetti monster. Oh thank you, jeez! My eyes are opened! [stands up] Hey everyone, I'm an atheist!
MR. DAWKINS
Really?? Oh that's wonderful!
MRS. GARRISON
No, I totally get it now! Evolution explains everything! There is no great mystery to life, just evolution and God's a spaghetti monster! Thank you, Richard!
MR. DAWKINS
You're so welcome!
MRS. GARRISON
Would you like tuh... [preens again] head over to my place for dessert?
[Mrs. Garrison's bedroom, night. Mr. Dawkins is giving it to Mrs. Garrison doggy style, hard. Both moan and make other sexual noises.]
MRS. GARRISON
Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm a monkey! Give this monkey what she wants!
MR. DAWKINS
Oh Ms. Garrison!
MRS. GARRISON
Yeah, pound my monkey hole, Richard! Yeah, I'm a monkey all right!
[In the Rockies, Cartman slowly freezes. The camera closes in]
CARTMAN
Nin-ten-do. I'm coming. I'm coming, Nin-ten-do.
[his hearbeat stops as he expels one last puff of air. The camera pulls back as wolves howl in the night. Night turns to day. Cartman's face has turned blue. An avalanche knocks down the tree and covers up the oval rock Butters is supposed to check for when he returns. It also buries Cartman, who is in pajamas. A time-travel sequence begins, which takes him forward in time to the year 2546. There, the block of ice that contains him is picked up and thawed. Three curved surfaces come together to form an egg around Cartman, and the egg is moved to a bed. The three pieces fall apart and disappear. Three items appear - an electronic eye, a small pump, and a vibrator.]
MEDIC
We have a pulse. [Cartman comes to, coughs, and sits up. The aliens gather around]
ALIEN 1
Can you... understand me?
CARTMAN
Where am I?
SHVEK
My name is Shvek. You are safe.
CARTMAN
Safe where, butthole?!
SHVEK
My friend, this is going to be a bit of a shock, but... it is the year 2546.
CARTMAN
[looks around] What??
SHVEK
You have been frozen in ice for over 500 years. [Cartman jumps off the bed and runs to the nearest window, where he sees a city unlike any he's seen before.]
CARTMAN
Butters? Butters, you black asshole?! [suddenly looks tired.]
MEDIC
Please be careful. You are frail.
CARTMAN
Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii?
ANALYST
[brings up a holoscreen and presses a few buttons on it. A picture of the Wii appears] Ahh, Nintendo Wii. A primitive gaming device used in his time.
CARTMAN
Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe!
MEDIC
Young man, you don't seem to understand. [goes down on one knee] Your family, your friends, everyone you knew, has been dead for over 500 years.
CARTMAN
I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii!
SHVEK
We don't play videogames in our time. There's no such thing as a Nintendo Wii.
CARTMAN
No... [looks up at the ceiling and] NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
[South Park Elementary, next day. Mr. Dawkins is back teaching about evolution. Mrs. Garrison looks quite enamored]
MR. DAWKINS
You must understand, children, that we are dealing with VERY large numbers here.
MRS. GARRISON
[thinking] That's my man.
MR. DAWKINS
So, evolution doesn't even happen by chance. It is, in fact, bound to happen.
MRS. GARRISON
That's right, kids. And so you see, there is no God.
MR. DAWKINS
Careful darling. The school board doesn't like it when we-
STAN
Well there could still be a god.
MRS. GARRISON
What?!
STAN
Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why?
MRS. GARRISON
[brings out a triangle and starts ringing it] Uh oh, retard alert! Retard alert, class! [leaves her desk and walks up to Stan's] Do you believe in a flying spaghetti monster too, bubblehead?!
STAN
I wasn't talking about spaghetti. [Mrs. Garrison picks him up, desk and all, and carries him to the front of the class.]
MRS. GARRISON
Come on, you. You're gonna have to sit in the dunce chair! [sets him down next to the blackboard, goes for a dunce cap, and places it on Stan's head. The cap reads "I HAVE FAITH"]
[Mrs. Garrison's house, night. She and Mr. Dawkins are in bed. She runs her fingers through Mr. Dawkin's chest hair.]
MR. DAWKINS
Ms. Garrison, I'm not so sure what you did in class today was right.
MRS. GARRISON
What?? But Dick, you told me the world would be a better place without religion.
MR. DAWKINS
Yes, but to be so bold about it... [looks away] I've just never seen a woman with such... balls.
MRS. GARRISON
[gets up and sits on Mr. Dawkins with the blanket over her chest] You've just been too soft on religious people in the past. Think about it, Richard. With your intellect and my balls, we can change the future of the world.
MR. DAWKINS
Can you imagine a world with no religion? No Muslims killing Jews, no Christians bombing abortion clinics. The world would be a wonderful place... without God.
MRS. GARRISON
You're the smartest man on earth, Dick. With me by your side, there's no stopping you.
MR. DAWKINS
Oh, just let me see those beautiful breasts again.
MRS. GARRISON
Oh, all right. [lowers the blanket and the breasts appear. The implants... are not balanced. The left nipple is huge and lower compared to the right one, and the stitches are still visible.]
MR. DAWKINS
Oh yeah, baby! Oh-hm. [begins to shake his head between the breasts, which has the effect of a motorboat's engine revving up.]
MRS. GARRISON
OHOH YEAH!! AHHH!! [Mr. Dawkins revs up again]
[Butters' house, day. He and Dougie play in the backyard as Professor Chaos and General Disarray. Toy action figures and various toy vehicles litter the yard]
BUTTERS
Quick, General Disarray! Kill those superheroes!
DOUGIE
[fires at the action figures] Pehpew Pehpew! [walks over and kicks them down]
BUTTERS
Yes! Now the world shall feel the wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!
LINDA
Butters? [she appears at the sliding door entrance with two policemen behind her] Butters, you haven't seen Eric Cartman in the past few days, have you?
BUTTERS
[a bit afraid, slowly] Who, me?
LINDA
It's very important, Butters. He's missing. You haven't seen or heard from him?
BUTTERS
[looks right, then left, trying to figure out what to say...] No ma'am.
LINDA
Okay. [closes the sliding door and walks away with the officers]
DOUGIE
Come on, Professor Chaos! Let's destroy this anthill! [Butters turns and joins him]
BUTTERS
Geh-General Disarray, can I ask you a scientific question?
DOUGIE
Okay.
BUTTERS
Well, um, can... Can anything bad happen if you completely freeze yourself and then unfreeze yourself three weeks later?
DOUGIE
[long pause] ...Yeah.
BUTTERS
Well, like what?
DOUGIE
...Like, you die.
BUTTERS
...Die??
DOUGIE
Well yeah. If you freeze your body, it means you die. When you wake up three weeks later you can be unfrozen, but you're still dead.
BUTTERS
Oh hamburgers!! [runs away]
[the Rockies. Butters and Dougie reach the spot where Cartman is frozen. Butters calls out to Cartman]
BUTTERS
Eric! Eric!
DOUGIE
You just left him here?! Without a jacket or anything?!
BUTTERS
He told me to!
DOUGIE
He's dead for sure.
BUTTERS
Wait! [looks around.] It's all different. Nothing's in the same place!
DOUGIE
Oh my God...
BUTTERS
[begins to dig frantically through the snow] Uh, eh, Eric! Eric!
DOUGIE
[trying to stop him] Butters ButterButterBUTTERS! [Butters stops and looks at him] We have to get out of here!
BUTTERS
What??
DOUGIE
Nobody is ever going to find his body. You've got to never say anything about this, do you understand?! He's dead, and if they know you had a hand in it, you'll go to jail! [runs off]
BUTTERS
But I just did what he told me!
DOUGIE
Come on, we have to leave!!
BUTTERS
Oh, jumping Jesus! [follows Dougie. They head back to town]
[Back to the future. Cartman sits at a desk]
CARTMAN
This is terrible. Five hundred years in the future. [puts his head in his hands and starts to weep. A door slides open and three of the aliens enter the room]
SHVEK
Eric, I have good news for you. We may have found you a Nintendo Wii.
CARTMAN
What?? [hops onto the desk] Really?? [jumps down and exults] YES!! YES!!
MEDIC
It's rumored that there's one at the Museum of Technology at New New Hampshire.
CARTMAN
So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go!
SHVEK
Well, there's just... th-there's something we need from you first.
[A meeting room. The three future humans talk to Cartman there]
SHVEK
You see, my young friend, you were unfrozen for a reason.
MEDIC
Lots of people froze themselves in cryogenic labs and we don't unfreeze them. But you... are special.
CARTMAN
I know I'm special. This isn't news to me.
SHVEK
You lived in a time when a great event happened. A glorious event that finally made all religion obsolete. Now, the entire world is atheist.
CARTMAN
[strokes his chin and thinks] And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how?
MEDIC
We believe that somebody you knew in your time was the person who first started our wonderful group: The Unified Atheist League.
CARTMAN
Who? [the medic is about to reply when something shakes the building they're in]
SHVEK
What in Science's name was that?! [outside, an enemy ship first at the building and leaves a hole in it. The ship docks at that hole and the invaders pour into a cargo room. The UAL members and Cartman enter the cargo room at the other end.]
MEDIC
Oh no! It's the United Atheist Alliance!
SHVEK
Oh Science, help us! [a laser battle between the two groups begins]
UAA MEMBER 1
[yellow hair, green suit] Science damn you, Unified Atheist League!
CARTMAN
Who are they??
SHVEK
The Alliance Atheists. We're at war with them. [the battle rages on, with laser shots going back and forth. The laser shots turn out to be syringes which inject the victim with poison. Once the load is fully inside the body, the head explodes. Men on both sides explode and die.]
UAL MEMBER 1
[a syringe gets him] No! [his head explodes]
CARTMAN
Jesus Christ!
SHVEK
Hahahaha, you believe in a supernatural being. [gets a syringe to the neck] Oh my Science. [his head explodes and the battle is over. The UAA closes in on Cartman, its guns drawn]
CARTMAN
I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii.
[The UAA ship's bridge. Cartman enters with UAA members escorting him.]
UAA MEMBER 1
Put me through to the Allied Atheist Allegiance!
UAA MEMBER 2
[black hair] Onscreen.
UAA MEMBER 1
Look, Allied Atheist Allegiance! We have the time child!
AAA LEADER
Science damn you, United Atheist Alliance!
UAA MEMBER 1
Now you see, foolish sea otters, that we are the atheists in control!
AAA LEADER
It won't make a difference! This is the dawning of the sea otter! Know this, time child! I shall smash your skull like a clam on my tummy!
CARTMAN
What??
AAA LEADER
Otters! The time has come! Sound the nafferty!
SEA OTTERS
The nafferty! [a giant otter walks over to a very fanciful horn and blows into it.]
AAA LEADER
[rises on a platform and turns around. A lens drops down from a contraption he has to his left ear and lands on his nose] So, it begins!
End of Go God Go


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Eric Cartman has frozen himself in an attempt to make his three-week wait for a Nintendo Wii pass quickly. A freak accident landed him over 500 years in the future and now, he's stuck in a Godless world on the brink of war with no Nintendo Wii.

script:Go God Go XII

[This episode begins with an expanded montage of last week's time-lapse imagery. First you see the town, the mall, and a house. Next, Cartman and the Wii at EV Games. Next, scenes from his night of insomnia, including him checking his calendar and the Wii's Web page, then watching TV. Then, Eric is shown begging his friends to help him freeze himself. Then, a collage of Eric hiding in the freezer, talking to Butters, and walking to the designated spot with him. Then, scenes of the avalanche and Eric getting frozen. Then the years begin to roll, and scenes of humanity's future appear. They are: the scene of the avalanche, a scene of devastation, the room where Cartman is taken to be thawed, his meeting with the high UAL command, the UAL building being attacked, a shot of Earth from space, the UAA storming in to fight the UAL, the battle between the two factions, the UAA closing in on Cartman, the voyage away from the UAL building, across a desert; the onscreen communication with the AAA, a shot of Earth's future, a sea otter blowing into the nafferty, and the final shot of two ships leading the camera to the city the UAL is based at]
NARRATOR
The year is 2006, and young Eric Cartman cannot wait for the new Nintendo Wii to come out. Unable to cope with the wait any longer, Eric decides to freeze himself for three weeks. But a freak avalanche makes Eric impossible to find, and so he remains frozen for 500 years.
[The next scenes all involve Cartman playing a part in the future. The background is the UAL's city. First he's dressed in a blue military outfit. Next, he's running with a robot dog, then firing off a laser gun, then of him and the bog in a vehicle. The background changes to the UAA's ship. Cartman is walking with the UAA members. The AAA is shown firing at them. Cartman and the UAA now sport helmets and go forth. The background changes to the AAA's city. The AAA has captured Cartman. Cartman plays chess with a sea otter. Cartman enjoys flying around upside down in a room of UAL members doing the same thing. Cartman is then shown in a different blue suit, and finally, a fleet of shuttlecraft fly to a new city. At this new city, ostriches are seen walking around, with otters riding them. The city is either in ruins or shabbily built]
OTTER LEADER
Whoa, steady! [motions to the otters] This way, otters! [other otters move forward on their ostriches]
OTTER 1
This is it. New New Hampshire. We have risked much bringing you here, Time Child. [the camera pans left to show Cartman on an ostrich and wearing goggles.]
CARTMAN
Can it. You otters may have evolved to the point you can talk, but I don't need lectures.
OTTER 1
Don't let the time child out of your sight. He could try to run.
CARTMAN
[goggles now above his eyes] We have a deal, Blavius. As long as I get what I want, you have nothin' to worry about. [the leader's ostrich makes a noise]
OTTER LEADER
Something is spooking the ostriches.
CARTMAN
Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere.
OTTER LEADER
Here it is! We have arrived.
BLAVIUS
[Sea Otter 1] Hold! [the ostriches stop at a large entrance] This is it, Time Child. [the building's name is shown: New New Hampshire Museum of Technology] The old museum of technology, abandoned long ago. Let's get what you want, Time Child, and get out of here.
[The otters escort Cartman to the Museum of the Past. Cartman looks around and finally spots the Wii.]
CARTMAN
Over here! [runs over to it] Yeah it's here! It's here! The Nintendo Wii... I've waited so long for this. [shatters the glass case protecting it and removes it]
BLAVIUS
All right, Time Child, we've filled our side of the bargain. Now return with us to Otter Bay.
CARTMAN
Sorry Blavius. I've got other plans. [switches hands in holding the Wii, presses a button on his left glove and disappears]
BLAVIUS
NOOOO!
OTTER LEADER
It was a trick!
BLAVIUS
SCIENCE DAMN YOU, TIME CHILD!
[UAA transporter room. As various UAA members wait, Cartman appears on the transporter pad]
CARTMAN
I got it! I got the Wii!
UAA LEADER
Time Child! You've returned!
UAA 1
We thought for sure you had died in the in the Phobart plant.
CARTMAN
[turns and leaves the transporter pad] Yeah. Lucky for me the otters believed I was on their side. [turns around as he reaches the door] Do me a favor: next time I'm in a recessed biocave, don't send me a level 2 homing call. [the door opens and Cartman walks into the hallway outside the room. The leader and his assistant look at each other]
UAA LEADER
TC, wait!
CARTMAN
[ruonds a corner] Oh I can't wait! This is gonna be so awesome! [almost walks into another UAA member] Get out of my way!
UAA LEADER
[catches up with Cartman] You gained the otters' trust?! Were you wearing an information crystal?!
CARTMAN
Here. [takes off the information crystal and hands it to him]
UAA 1
Science be praised. This could end the war!
UAA LEADER
You've done a great thing, TC. [Cartman turns right...] How can we repay you?
CARTMAN
[...and enters an elevator] Just send a maintenance guy to my room. I want this Nintendo hooked up to my float screen NOW! [the doors close]
[Cartman's room. A maintenance guy is trying to figure out how to connect the Wii to the screen.]
CARTMAN
Come on! Come on! Dude, what is taking so long! I wanna play!
MAINTENANCE GUY
Uhh, what kind of output does this have? This is some ancient Super-VHS output or somethin'. I can't connect it to your float screen.
CARTMAN
There's gotta be some way to hook it up! It's the freakin' future!
MAINTENANCE GUY
It may be the future for you, but I can't hook up anything to a float screen without at least a laser-7 output.
CARTMAN
You've gotta be shittin' me!! Science-dammit! I am so fucking sick of the future! [starts throwing a tantrum, throwing things around]
UAA WOMAN
[entering the room] TC? What's wrong?
CARTMAN
I'll tell you what's wrong! I've been waiting 500 years to play the Nintendo Wii! And if I don't get to play real soon, I'm gonna bust a nut!
UAA WOMAN
Well, we're all glad you're back. I know somebody who's missed you very much. Come on in, K-10. [steps aside to reveal K-10, who walks in]
K-10
Bark bark. Hello, Eric. I have missed you.
CARTMAN
Suck my balls, K-10. I'm not in the mood.
[A United Atheist Alliance meeting.]
UAA LEADER
Fellow atheists: the time child has returned with information on our sworn enemies, the Allied Atheist Alliance. They have started digging for clams in sector J7. If we mount an all-out attack, we can wipe out their food supply!
UAA 2
But, those are civilian otters.
UAA LEADER
We cannot tolerate the otters! Their Science is flawed! Their answer to the Great Question is different from ours.
UAA 3
Yes, but... sending out all our ships at the same time... it would leave our city exposed!
UAA LEADER
...That's why we have to be super-duper sure that nobody finds out we're doing it.
[Unified Atheist League headquarters. The UAL elders gather to discuss the situation]
UAL 1
[hanging upside down from a jet-powered platform] The United Atheist Alliance is about to send out all its defense ships to take down the Allied Atheist Alliance's clam fields.
UAL 2
Praise Science. This is your chance, young Shvek, to avenge your father's death.
UAL 3
Careful, son. Just because their Science leads them to a different answer to the Great Question doesn't mean we have the right to kill them all.
SHVEK
No! Our answer to the Great Question is the only logical one. Our Science is great. [walks away from the table and stands before a wall] Let us not forget the great Richard Dawkins who finally freed the world of religion long ago. [a painting is shown, with Dawkins in it] Dawkins knew that logic and reason were the way of the future. [More of the painting is shown: Mrs. Garrison appears] But it wasn't until he met his beautiful wife that he learned using logic and reason isn't enough. You have to be a dick to everyone who doesn't think like you. [turns around] Prepare all the troops! We will level the United Atheist Alliance to the ground!
[Cartman's room at UAA headquarters. Cartman watches TV on his float screen, K-10 standing nearby. A commercial comes on]
ANNOUNCER
With new Glade monvert cleaner, you can make your monvert sparkle like never before.
WOMAN
My monvert's never looked so clean. [apparently, a monvert is a phallic device]
CARTMAN
God I hate future TV. There's too many commercials! [switches channels. A picture appears briefly in which a reporter is about to mention an attack, but that vanishes. Three bored kids appear seated at a coffee table]
BOY 1
Agh! I'm so bored.
BOY 2
There's nothing to do.
CARTMAN
Tell me about it.
BOY 3
Hey, I know! Let's crank call people in the past!
BOY 1
Huh?
BOY 3
I just got... [brings out a big box] the Crank Prank Time Phone! [the other two boys marvel at it]
SINGERS
Crank Prank, Crank Prank Time Phone.
ANNOUNCER
New, from Blasbro, it's Crank Prank Time Phone!
BOY ANNOUNCER
I just dial a random number on the keypad, enter a date and year on the debilibrator, and...
BOY 1
Wow! Someone from the past is on the line! [talks into the phone] Hello? Is there a refrigerator running? Well then, you'd better go catch it! [the boys have a good laugh]
SINGERS
Crank Prank, Crank Prank Time Phone.
CARTMAN
[now interested] What?
BOY 2
Uh hi. It's the year 1973, right? Could I speak to Al Coholic, please? [the boys laugh again]
ANNOUNCER
Crank Prank Time Phone comes with debilibrator [looks like a space-age microphone], antimatter fusion cone, and 30 plain HF watt triggers. Warning: Crank Prank Time Phone is for entertainment purposes only. Making anything OTHER than crank calls to the past could affect the present and end your existence. Crank Prank Time Phone is not intended for the use by otters.
CARTMAN
Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?!
K-10
Why does it matter? Bark bark
CARTMAN
Don't you see?? If I get one of those phones, I can call myself in the past and tell me not to freeze myself. [walks forward a few steps] Then I can go back into my time... and play Nintendo Wii.
K-10
Bark bark. That call is for crank calling only. Using it in the way you describe is illegal.
CARTMAN
I care! Where's the closest toy store??
K-10
Working, bark bark. The Jarvanian shopping complex. But it is not open yet.
[Zeebod's Toys, some time later. K-10 stands by as Cartman paces the ground in front of the store, just as he did in the past waiting for the Wii]
CARTMAN
Come on! Come on!
VOICE
Store is now... open. [the storefront lights up like a Christmas tree and the doors open] Welcome
CARTMAN
Ugh, finally!
CLERK
Welcome to Zeebod's Toys
CARTMAN
I want one of those time-phone things.
CLERK
Ahh, the Crank Prank Time Phone. Sure. Now, I am required by the state to make sure you know this is for prank-calling the past ONLY, right?
CARTMAN
Yeah yeah, I'm only gonna prank-call people.
CLERK
[pulls up a small float screen and calculates the cost on it] All right, that'll be 6000 credits. [a second float screen pops up with the price on it]
CARTMAN
Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?!
CLERK
This is a pretty advanced piece of equipment. It's expensive.
CARTMAN
Look, I have to have one of those phones!
CLERK
Oh, all right, then I have to have 6000 credits. [Eric sighs and looks down]
K-10
Bark bark, I'm sorry, Eric, bark bark.
CARTMAN
How about a robot? How much for the robot?
K-10
Awww.
CLERK
[puts the phone away] Sorry, kid, you're just gonna have to crank-call people in the present.
CARTMAN
[turns around and walks away. K-10 follows] Science-dammit! [stops] Wait. K-10, can you access the store's sales records?
K-10
Working, bark bark. Access.
CARTMAN
I want the name and address of anybody who's bought a time phone from this guy in the past week.
K-10
Working, bark bark.
[Otter Bay. evening. A sign there says "Allied Atheist Alliance." Blavius addresses a large crowd of sea otters]
BLAVIUS
The United Atheist Alliance has taken the bait! Soon they will send their ships out to destroy our decoy clam fields! And while their ships are away, the United Atheist League intends to attack them! Our plan has worked perfectly! For when the United Atheist League attacks the United Atheist Alliance, we will charge in and kill them all! Our Science, our answer to the Great Question shall prevail!
OTTERS
Hail Science! Hail Science! Hail Science!
BLAVIUS
And I will personally kill the Time Child, and eat his entrails on my tummy!
[The turn of the 20th century, day. An early blue car rolls down the street and the driver honks his horn. The car passes by a Colonial-style house. Inside the house, a woman vacuums a rug with an early vacuum cleaner when the phone rings. She turns off the vacuum cleaner and starts moving towards the phone]
MAN
I'll get it, darling. [approaches the phone and picks up the receiver. His wife goes back to vacuuming] Hello? Hello?
BOY 4
Uh yes, hello? I'm calling for Mr. Wall?
MAN
I'm sorry, there's no Mr. Wall here.
BOY 4
Oh. Is Mrs. Wall there?
MAN
Nno, there are no Walls here.
BOY 4
Then how does your roof stay up? [he and his friend begin to laugh]
MAN
Oh, I see! Is this the Johnson boys from down the street?!
BOY 4
No, we're from the future. [stifled laughter]
MAN
Very funny!
BOY 5
Hi, uh, I'm a Pepper, and I'm wondering if you'd like to be a Pepper too?
MAN
God darn ya! [hangs up. The two boys laugh]
BOY 4
Yeah.
BOY 5
That was a great one! [the doorbell rings and Boy 4 gets up to answer it. Cartman, dressed as a maintenance man, and K-10 appear at the entrance]
CARTMAN
Hello, I'm with the cubic waste department. I need to check your lowertram for inhibitors.
BOY 4
Oh. Okay, I guess.
CARTMAN
[steps inside] Come on in, Bob. [K-10 enters the room] All right, just let me use my tools... [pulls out a gun and fires at Boy 4, who is instantly trapped in a bubble, floating in the air. K-10 does the same to Boy 5.]
BOY 5
Hey!
CARTMAN
[walks up and takes the time phone from the coffee table] Haha! Stupid assholes! I got your time phone! [walks out the door with K-10]
BOY 4
Science H. Logic! What a jerk!
[Otter Bay. evening. The otters are arming each other]
THE WISE ONE
[walks in with a cane] Silence, otters!
OTTER 1
It's the Wise One
OTTER 2
The Wise One speaks.
THE WISE ONE
This is not the path we should be taking. Will more bloodshed end anything?
BLAVIUS
[floats up to him on a hovering throne] Wise One, our answer to the Great Question is the only one based on good science.
THE WISE ONE
Science, reason, is that really all there is?
BLAVIUS
They are not a logical race, Wise One! They go around chopping down trees for tables, when they have perfectly good tummies to eat on. How logical is that?!
OTTER LEADER
Yes! [walks up to a painting of Dawkins and Garrison] The great Dawkins said we cannot tolerate those who don't use reason! How reasonable is it to eat off wood instead of your tummy?
THE WISE ONE
Well perhaps the great Dawkins wasn't so wise. Oh, he was intelligent, but, some of the most intelligent otters I've ever known were completely lacking in common sense. Maybe, some otters do need to believe in something. Who knows? Maybe, just believing in God makes God exist.
OTTER SOLDIER
Kill the Wise One!
OTTER 3
Kill the Wise One! [the other otters crowd him in and start attacking]
THE WISE ONE
What?! Whoa, wait wait! [perishes amid the pummeling while Blavius watches on]
[Cartman's room, night. He's sprawled out on his bed in his pajamas, his eyes open. He can't sleep, tossing and turning every few seconds. He looks at his clock: 2:15.]
CARTMAN
Oh God! [throws himself back on the bed and squeezes his eyes shut. This time, the phone rings. He gets up to answer it. The caller is the Time Child] Hello? [he gets static until...]
TIME CHILD
[in a higher pitch] Hello? [Cartman is surprised to hear his own voice on the other end] Are you there?
CARTMAN
Who is this?
TIME CHILD
[to K-10] No, no, I have me. [to his past self] All right, all right, listen! Listen to me carefully! You need to be patient!
CARTMAN
What?? Who the hell is this?!
TIME CHILD
It's me.
CARTMAN
Me who?!
TIME CHILD
Me you!
CARTMAN
What?!
TIME CHILD
I'm you in the future! You have to be patient and wait for the Nintendo Wii to come out, or else you'll wake up in the future and have to deal with a bunch of see otters!
CARTMAN
Oh very funny, Kyle!
TIME CHILD
It's not Kyle, it's you!
CARTMAN
Yeah? Well you can go fuck yourself.
TIME CHILD
I'm trying to do you a favor, dumb-ass!! Just listen to me!
CARTMAN
Listen to this! [puts the phone to his ass and farts into it, then slams the phone down on its base] Dickhead. [the phone rings again. Cartman picks it up and quickly slams it down again.]
TIME CHILD
[surprised at his own reaction in the past] What an asshole!
[Butters' house, later. The phone rings in the kitchen. Butters walks in to answer it.]
BUTTERS
Hello? [he gets static until...]
TIME CHILD
Butters? Butters!
BUTTERS
Eric? Is that you?
TIME CHILD
Butters, Butters! Listen to me! Just just listen. I'm about to come over to your house and ask you to help me freeze myself. Do not... do t!
BUTTERS
[looks around unsure what to make of this strange call] Eric, are you playing a joke on me again?
TIME CHILD
No! This is not a joke! Whatever I say to you, Butters, no matter how hard I try, do not... do... what I tell you!
BUTTERS
But... [notices Cartman entering through the front door] but you're here right now. [Cartman walks into view]
CARTMAN
Butters?! Come on, we gotta go!
TIME CHILD
[hearing his past self] No! Don't listen to me! Tell me to go screw myself!
BUTTERS
Huh??
CARTMAN
Come on, Butters, it's gonna get dark!
BUTTERS
But, you're telling me not to go with you.
CARTMAN
What?? [enters the kitchen to talk to his future self] Who the fuck is this?!
TIME CHILD
Aw dammit, just listen to me! If you freeze yourself, you're going to die!
CARTMAN
Suck my balls!
TIME CHILD
No, you suck my balls!! Just listen to me for one minute!
CARTMAN
...Okay, you have one minute.
TIME CHILD
Right before you left for Butters' house, you drank a buncha Ovaltine and put Clyde Frog in the closet so nothing would happen to him, right?
CARTMAN
[shocked] Are you spying on me?!
TIME CHILD
No, I am you, you stupid asshole!
CARTMAN
Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself! [hangs up and pulls his hood back over his head] Come on, Butters, we're going!
BUTTERS
Oh, all right then.
TIME CHILD
[frustrated] God I hate that guy!!
[UAA war meeting, a full room]
UAA LEADER
My friends, the time has come! May Science give us the courage to do what we must! Launch all defensive ships to sector J7! Take out the otters' clam fields! [a fleet of UAA ships takes off]
[UAL headquarters. The UAL leader ponders the painting of Dawkins and Garrison before him]
UAL AIDE
Sir! The United Atheist Alliance has sent out all their ships. Their capital is now unprotected.
UAL LEADER
[turns and issues the command] Then begin the attack! Science be praised.
[A vast meadow, day.The ground begins to vibrate, then the first ostrich zips by. A couple more follow, then a bigger group of them, then the whole army of them, all with otters on them riding into battle]
OTTER LEADER
Kill the table-eaters! In the name of Almighty Science! [the otters ride on]
[Kyle's house, day, kitchen. The phone rings and Kyle arrives to answer it]
KYLE
Hello? [he gets static until...]
TIME CHILD
Hello? Kyle?
KYLE
Hello?
TIME CHILD
Yes. Hello, Kyle. It's Eric. Uh, how's it going?
KYLE
What do you want?!
TIME CHILD
Kyle, you are the smartest guy I know, so I think maybe you're the only person who can understand this. You know how earlier today I asked you to help me freeze myself?
KYLE
I'm not going to help you freeze yourself, Cartman! It's a stupid idea!
TIME CHILD
No, see, I know it's a stupid idea. Because, I actually did freeze myself.and... you were right, Kyle. It backfired and I was frozen for 500 years, and now I'm calling you from the future.
KYLE
[with half-closed eyes] ... Uh huh.
TIME CHILD
No, really, Kyle, I'm I'm seriously. Here, talk to my robot dog. [backs up to hand the phone to K-10.]
K-10
Bark bark. Hello, Kyle. Bark bark.
KYLE
... I'm hanging up now.
TIME CHILD
No, Kyle, listen! Please! I think right about now, I'm in my mom's freezer.
KYLE
Suck my balls, fatass.
TIME CHILD
... I will. I will suck your balls, Kyle. Just stop me from freezing myself, and I will get down on my knees, and I will suck your balls. I'll suck 'em dry, Kyle. [a car honks its horn at Kyle's end and he looks over. It leaves]
KYLE
Aw Goddammit, now you've made me miss my ride! My whole day is screwed up because of you! [hangs up]
TIME CHILD
Kyle? [as he asks, everything around him changes. His float screen goes from red to green, his suit goes from blue to saffron with light blue cape, the plant turns leafy, and the floor goes from orange to navy] Kyle!
KIT-9
[K-10's new look] Eric, I really think you should stop calling the past. You could change the present.
TIME CHILD
Well I don't notice anything different, KIT-9! Do you?
KIT-9
I guess not, meow meow.
TIME CHILD
[begins to notice the differences] Hm, I see... [the building is shaken hard by something striking it] Hey!
KIT-9
Meow meow. [the UAL ships swarm in and fire at all the buildings in UAA territory]
TIME CHILD
Heeeeey!
KIT-9
Meow meow.
UAA WOMAN
TC! We're under attack!
TIME CHILD
By who?!
UAA WOMAN
We have to get to the War Room! It's the only safe place!
[The War Room. Officials there mill around trying to keep things under control. KIT-9 and Cartman arrive. Cartman has the Crank Prank Time Phone]
UAA LEADER
The United Atheist League is bombing the city! We're defenseless!
CARTMAN
This is terrible! I'm gonna die in the future without ever playing Nintendo Wii?!
TACTICAL OFFICER
Sir! The sea otters are advancing! They've broken through the east portal!
[The outskirts of the UAA city. The otter army reaches the edge of the city]
UAA LEADER
What?! Three-way phone channel onscreen! [the main screen lights up with two windows. On the left window appear the UAL leader and the UAL, on the right window appear Blavius and the otters]
SHVEK
[from UAL headquarters] What are you otters doing?! This is our attack!
BLAVIUS
[from AAA headquarters] Yes. And we're attacking both of you!
UAA LEADER
You fools! This will be the end of us all!
BLAVIUS
Then accept our answer to the Great Question, and we will withdraw.
UAA LEADER
Your answer to the Great Question is illogical!
CARTMAN
What is the Great Question?
KIT-9
What atheists should call themselves.
SHVEK
Unified Atheist League is the most logical name.
UAA LEADER
>Unified Atheist Alliance makes more sense.
BLAVIUS
No! Allied Atheist Alliance! That way it has three A's! That is the logical choice!
SHVEK
So be it. We cannot agree; prepare to die.
TACTICAL OFFICER
Forward missiles launched, sir!
CARTMAN
I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they think I'm crank-calling them?!
KIT-9
But Eric, meow meow, you knew the wife of the smartest man in all of history.
CARTMAN
Who?
KIT-9
Your teacher, the one called Garrison.
CARTMAN
Garrison? But he's an asshole.
[Mrs. Garrison's bedroom, night. Mr. Dawkins is giving it to Mrs. Garrison doggy style, hard. Both moan and make other sexual noises. The phone rings]
MRS. GARRISON
Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm a monkey! Give this monkey what she wants!
MR. DAWKINS
Oh Ms. Garrison!
MRS. GARRISON
Dammit, who the hell is calling?!
MR. DAWKINS
I'll tell them... to call you back... Oh... yeah... [answers the phone] Garrison residence. Can you call... back later, please?
CARTMAN
It's an emergency! It's an emergency!
MR. DAWKINS
[stops] An emergency?
CARTMAN
I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now!
MR. DAWKINS
I'm sorry, but Mr. Garrison has passed away. Mrs. Garrison is the only person here and she's rather tied up at the moment.
CARTMAN
Look asshole, this is a real emergency! Just pass the phone to whatever Garrison wants to call himself since the sex-change operation!
MR. DAWKINS
Sex-change operation??
MRS. GARRISON
Uh oh.
MR. DAWKINS
[pulls out and protects his genitals] Uuuuugh! You're a man?!
MRS. GARRISON
Not anymore. I've been fixed. [Dawkins runs for his clothes] Richard, hold on. I can explain.
MR. DAWKINS
Explain?? How can I be so stupid?? [runs out of the house with his pants on, carrying the rest of his clothes]
MRS. GARRISON
Richard, come back, please! [Dawkins does NOT return, and Garrison loses her faith in atheism in a flash] Well go ahead and leave, you atheist faggot! Have fun mocking God in hell! You queer!
[The battle in the future. The War Room has been destroyed, but Cartman and KIT-9 are still there]
CARTMAN
Mr. Garrison! Mr. Garrison! [Cartman's present changes again, and now he's wearing a gray suit with orange cape. Also, he's back at UAL headquarters, which is quiet and undamaged]
SHVEK
[enters from a side door] All right, Eric. Are you all set to go?
CARTMAN
[turns around] Go... Right... Where am I going? [he was facing a panel of UAL and UAA members]
UAA LEADER
[joins Shvek from the left side] W-we told you: we're sending you home. With the Crank and Wank Time Machine.
BLAVIUS
[joins them both from the right side] Don't worry, my son. When you return to your time you will merge with your other self. It's all very Zen.
CARTMAN
Wait... Isn't... everybody at war over atheism?
SHVEK
Atheism? No. We've learned to get rid of all the isms in our time.
MEDIC
Yes. Long ago we realized isms are great for those who are rational, but in the hands of irrational people, isms always lead to violence.
CARTMAN
So there is no war now in the future.
BLAVIUS
Of course there's war. The stupid French-Chinese think they have a right to Hawaii.
ALL
Yeah!
UAA LEADER
But now the moment has come to send you back to your time. [some rings descend from above and a blue light appears, indicating that beaming is about to begin]
SHVEK
We unfroze you for a purpose, and now that purpose is fulfilled.
CARTMAN
[wondering] And what was that purpose again?
SHVEK
We explained that to you already.
CARTMAN
Right... [a bird flies in and sets down next to him.]
KOK-A-3
Goodbye, Eric. I will mess you. Squawk squawk
CARTMAN
I'll miss you too, KOK-A-3.
UAA LEADER
So long, Eric. And tell everyone in the past for us, that no one single answer... is ever the answer. [the rings go back up and take Eric with them.]
[EV Games. Cartman is pacing in front of the store again]
CARTMAN
Hoowww- [his future self is beamed into his body and he checks himself] I'm back. Wow! I'm back!
LIANE
There you are, Eric.
CARTMAN
Mom! Mom, they did it!
LIANE
Eric, you have to come home. You can't just wait here for that game to come out.
CARTMAN
[happy, for once] No, I know. You're right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out.
LIANE
But, honey, it's only September. That... [points] Nintendo Wii doesn't come out for two months.
CARTMAN
What? NO! [runs up to the window and sees that his mom is right] NOO!! [turns around and moves away from the storefront] You sent me back too far!! HEY! Do it over!
LIANE
Who are you talking to, muffin?
CARTMAN
I can't wait two months! [runs back to the doors] I can't! There has to be a way around this!
CLERK
Hey, kid, somebody's on the phone for you.
CARTMAN
Hello?
[Cartman the Time Child is calling from a different future, in which everyone floats around on large purple-pink bubbles]
TIME CHILD
Hello? Hello? I know what you're thinking! Do not do it! You just need to be patient and wait the two months! Do you hear me?!
CARTMAN
...Oh, suck my balls, Kyle! [hangs up and leaves the store.]
End of Go God Go XII


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Stan Marsh has hit rock bottom. He's got no job, no bicycle and his only way out of a bad situation is to coach the local pee wee hockey team. But Marsh is still living with the memory of how he let his team down when he missed the winning shot in the big game.

script:Stanley's Cup

[The South Park Gazette, est. 1997, day. A bicycle rests on the sidewalk outside the office. Inside, Stan talks to the editor.]
EDITOR
[The nameplate on his desk says Mr. Jarvis] Being a delivery boy for the South Park Gazette is a noble privilege.
STAN
I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day.
MR. JARVIS
Oh waaa waaa waaa! We've all got problems, pussy! Get used to it! [picks up today's paper] You aren't delivering the papers on time!
STAN
[insistent] My bike had a busted pedal, but I got it fixed, so there won't be a problem anymore. [behind him, outside the window, a tow truck pulls up]
MR. JARVIS
[noticing] Is that your bike out there? [the driver leaves the cab and moves towards the back of the truck.]
STAN
Yeah. Why?
MR. JARVIS
'Cause it's being towed.
STAN
[turns around] What?? [walks to the door and looks out its window, then leaves the office while the driver locks the bike in place]
[Outside the Gazette office.]
STAN
Hey, hey! What are you doing?!
DRIVER
This your bike?
STAN
Yes!
DRIVER
It's on the impound list. You owe the county for tickets. [the list shows the tow truck belonging to Jerry's Towing. The driver activates the crane, which slowly lifts one end of the bike up]
STAN
No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!
DRIVER
Yeah? Well my job is to tow this bike. You want it back? You talk to the county. [gets back into the cab and closes the door]
STAN
[climbs up the door towards the driver] No NOO. Do NOT tow my bike! [the truck moves forward and Stan hops off. He moves towards the bike.] Stop, asshole! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! [catches up to the bike and grabs one of the pedals, but that just jerks him up and down a few times as the wheel on the ground moves the pedals. Stan hits the ground several times, getting bruised until he finally lets go of the pedal and rests on the street. He looks on helplessly as the truck keeps moving and his bike disappears in the distance]
[Park County Government Center, day. A man sits in his office, and a knock is heard at his door.]
JUDGE
Yes? Come in.
STAN
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to-
JUDGE
Yes! Come on, Mr. Marsh. I've been told all about your case. Impounded bicycle, $83 owed to the county. Maybe you should get a job.
STAN
I got a job, but without my bike to do my paper route, I can't make the money! See?
JUDGE
[pulls out a pre-loaded record player and puts the needle onto the record, which begins playing, then says] Stan Marsh is a bright young man. He's got a great family, a promising paper route; only problem is, [removes the needle from the record] his bike's been impounded! [puts the needle back on the record, on another song] But now, he's about to find out that getting his bike back isn't so easy. [pulls the needle off again and puts the needle's arm in its resting place]
STAN
[several seconds later] Look, I really need my bike.
JUDGE
[puts the record player aside] Well, I'm afraid I can't give it to you, because then you wouldn't learn anything..
STAN
What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair!
JUDGE
Whoa whoa, hold on. I've looked your case over and I think maybe we can cut a little deal here. According to your background check, when you were in kindergarten, you played on the Park County Pee Wee Hockey Team.
STAN
...Yeah?
JUDGE
Well it just so happens that the pee wee hockey team this year needs a coach.
STAN
[apprehensive] Me?
JUDGE
[pulls out the record player again and plays it] Stan Marsh is a washed-up fourth grader. He's got no job, no bicycle. And his only way out is to coach... [pulls the needle off the record] a pee wee hockey team! [puts it on again] And now, he's about to find out that to coach, you've got to grow.
[South Park Recreation Center, looking more sophisticated than before. A hockey rink is in place, with kindergartners inside moving around. Stan is near the center's entrance moving towards the rink. Kids fall and get back up as they struggle to skate. Stan reaches the rink's entrance and looks inside]
STAN
Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys, over here? Come over here. [the kids move towards him, tumbling. Stan decides to go in and meet them] We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in.
# 10
Who are you?
STAN
My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our-
# 8
Coach, I have to go potty.
STAN
All right, fine, go ahead.
# 8
...By myself?
STAN
S- hold it a while, okay?
# 7
What does "passing" mean?
STAN
When you shoot the puck to another player.
# 15
[chubby boy] My mommy said I'm as big as the sky.
# 3
Coach, Morgan spit on my foot!
MORGAN
I did not!
STAN
All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie.
NELSON
[downcast] I can't play goalie. [he's bald, save for a few hairs hanging down from inside his helmet]
STAN
Why not?!
NELSON
My doctor says I'm not supposed to.
STAN
What, you got asthma or something?
# 3
No, he has cancer.
STAN
[off guard] What?
# 8
Nelson has leukemia. It's already spread to his bone marrow.
NELSON
I don't wanna have cancer! [covers his eyes and begins to weep]
STAN
Ah, it's okay. Don't cry.
NELSON
But why me, coach? Why?
# 7
Coach, why do people get cancer?
STAN
[feeling overwhelmed] Oh Jesus, can we just practice?
# 10
Are we gonna get cancer if we play with Nelson, Coach?
STAN
NO! [a rival team and its coach walk up to Park County]
COACH
Well well well! If it isn't the Park County Losers! [the rival players laugh. They're from Adams County]
# 7
Oh no! Adams County! [the Park County players back away, leaving Stan out front]
COACH
We just thought we'd come check out the ice for the game tomorrow. [steps forward and offers a handshake] Gavin Throttle, coach of the Adams County team.
STAN
[steps forward to reply] Hey. [Coach Gavin withdraws his hand]
GAVIN
Look, why don't you just give up? You can't beat us. You really want to embarrass your players?
# 7
Our coach isn't gonna let us lose!
PARK COUNTY
Yeah!!
GAVIN
[steps forward again] Fine, if that's the way you want it. See ya tomorrow, coach! Adams Team!
ADAMS COUNTY
Right! Follow! [they leave the rink]
# 6
Coach, please don't let us lose to Adams County. My daddy will beat me again.
[Stan's house, night. It's been a long day and Stan looks tired. He opens the front door and enters.]
STAN
Jesus Christ. [his parents walk up to him]
SHARON
Stanley, where have you been?! It's almost bedtime!
RANDY
Your mother's been worried sick, and I've been watching TV!
STAN
I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe.
RANDY
Oh, well that's good.
SHARON
What kind of job?
STAN
I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League.
RANDY
...What? With the-? [turns around] What whoa wait, Stan. You gave up playing hockey a long time ago.
STAN
I'm not playing, I'm coaching.
RANDY
Have you forgotten what happened all those years ago? Or are you just trying to make up for it?
STAN
[tense] What are you talking about?
RANDY
Your Pee Wee hockey game! The Pepsi Center?! In between periods of the Colorado Avalanche?
STAN
[relaxes] I remember going to Shakey's afterwards.
RANDY
Stan, you can't put your family through this again! Whatever your reasons are!
STAN
[heads upstairs] I'm tired. I'm goin' to bed. [Randy moves towards him a bit, but Stan's door closes, and Randy turns to Sharon]
RANDY
What are we goin' to do, Sharon??
SHARON
What?
RANDY
Don't you get it? He's getting back into hockey to prove something to himself. So he can forget what happened in that Pee Wee skirmish.
SHARON
Maybe he doesn't remember. He was only 4.
RANDY
Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it eats at him every single day.
[Stan's room, night. He's now asleep and begins to dream.]
ANNOUNCER
And we're about out of time here in another scoreless Pee Wee hockey game. [a boy skates towards the camera] And that's # 7, Stan Marsh, skating towards the goal, sort of, but h doesn't have the puck. [players nowhere near him just fall randomly. Two players manage to move towards a puck. The South Park player falls onto the Denver player, who kicks the puck away]
DENVER GOALIE
[farts, and realizes he did more than that] I crapped 'em! Oh me I crapped 'em! [leaves the goal defenseless]
ANNOUNCER
Oh, it appears the goalie has pooped his pants. [the pucks moves towards Stan and stops right in front of him. The spotlight lands on him. The announcer stands] Oh and look at this! Little Stan Marsh actually has a shot at the goal!
CROWD
Ohhhh!
RANDY
[with longer hair] Stan?? Shoot it! [Stan isn't sure what to do]
ANNOUNCER
Time is running out. Stan Marsh with a chance to win!
KYLE
You got it, Stan!
RANDY
[quite animated. Sharon holds him down] Take the shot!! Take the shot!! [Stan takes the shot and the puck moves towards the goal, but stops just inches from success. The buzzer sounds and no one wins] NOOOOOOOOOOO!
ANNOUNCER
Ohoooo, that's the end of the game! How disappointing. [Stan looks around, scared.]
[The master bedroom. Randy wakes up from his dream in a fit, jumps up and runs around the bedroom. Sharon sits up in fear]
SHARON
Randy, what's wrong??
RANDY
OH! Ohh... Oh Sharon, it was horrible! It was like I was living it all over again.
[Park County Hockey Rink, day. Inside, Stan is with his team.]
STAN
[blows his whistle] All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice.
A MAN
Coach? Hey coach. [the man and his wife appear] Could we talk to you, please? [Stan leaves the rink to meet them]
WOMAN
We are the Browns. Nelson's parents?
STAN
Oh
MR. BROWN
Our little Nelson, he's... taken a turn for the worse, I'm afraid! His cancer is... real ba-a-a-ad. [Mrs. Brown tries to soothe him, but begins to weep softly]
STAN
Ohhh.
MR. BROWN
Yeah. Oh. Doctors say this could be it. How am I supposed to do it, coach? How do I look a five year old child in the eye and tell him he's not gonna live? [frustration leads to anger] You tell me, coach! You tell me how!!
MRS. BROWN
Stop it, Jack! He doesn't mean to take it out on you, coach.
MR. BROWN
[frustrated again] No, I don't mean to take it out on you, coach. It's just... [fiddling with his had nervously] I don't know what to say to him, coach. Neither of us do. What do you say tuh... somebody who's dying, huh?
STAN
... I don't know.
MR. BROWN
Will you talk to him, coach? He looks up to you.
STAN
No, I think you oughta.
MR. BROWN
Nah, I'm just his father. But you're his coach! You're like a father to him.
MRS. BROWN
Please, coach, he's... [turns aside to cry] he's counting on you!
MR. BROWN
[bows several times] Please, coach, he's counting on you!
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day.]
[Nelson's room. A banner over his bed reads "We Love You, Nelson" and a balloon reads "Get Well".]
STAN
[enters the room] Oh uh, hey Nelson.
NELSON
Oh. [coughs] Hi, coach.
STAN
Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you?
NELSON
Yeah, it's a pretty bad time for me, coach. I'm only five and I'm dying. [Stan walks up to him] Coach, what's it like when you die?
STAN
Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born?
NELSON
How come I have to die now?
STAN
Ogh.
NELSON
I mean, how come I don't get to grow up?
STAN
Goddammit, dude, I don't know.
NELSON
I'm sorry.
STAN
No, what I mean is, nobody really knows, see? But everyone does it. I mean, it's not like everyone else gets to live and only you have to die. Everyone's gonna die. You feel better now?
NELSON
I think so.
STAN
Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right? [gives him a thumbs up and walks away]
NELSON
Thanks, coach. [Stan is close to the door...] Will you do me just one favor, Coach? That game tonight? I'm gonna be watching, so... could you... make it so I don't have cancer?
STAN
No- dude, I told you I can't do that.
NELSON
Well then, will you just... win for me?
STAN
Okay. [pause. He steps out of the room and closes the door. Behind the door is the judge, waiting. He has his record player with him. He starts playing it...]
JUDGE
Stan Marsh has always lived a carefree life. But in the blink of an eye, what seemed important before can all be put in perspective. Stan Marsh is... "Bummin' on Cancer." [takes the needle off, and Stan walks away.]
[Park County Hockey Rink, night. Spectators begin to stream into the recreation center.]
ANNOUNCER
Welcome, parents, to this Pee Wee hockey match between Park County and Adams County. [Sharon walks in and sits down]
ADAMS COUNTY
[Gavin leads them in the cheer] Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win!
STAN
[walks up to Gavin] Coach, can I talk to you for a second?
GAVIN
Come to surrender, coach?
STAN
[takes him aside] Look, there's a kid in my team who's got cancer, and, he wants us to win this game really bad, so, could you just... give us kind of a break?
GAVIN
HA! I don't think so, Coach. We're gonna beat you into the ground, cancer or no! [turns and heads back to his team] Win! Win! Win! Win!
ADAMS COUNTY
Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! ...
[The Park County locker room, before the game. Stan and his team hold a meeting.]
STAN
All right, guys, listen. [turns around] I saw Nelson in the hospital, and he asked me one thing: he said he wanted us to win this game... for him. [the players look at each other]
# 6
Sooo, if we lose we're gonna kill Nelson?
# 7
Oh Jesus, no!
# 3
I don't wanna be a murderer!
STAN
Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers.
# 7
If we lose are we gonna get cancer?
# 13
Oh no!
# 15
Ohhh..
# 8
Oh no.
# 6
I don't want cancer.
[The game begins. Adams County players tap their sticks to the drum rhythm going on over the speakers.]
# 7
They look pretty strong, coach. I think Nelson's gonna die for sure. [Stan looks a bit awed at the kid's assessment. The referee skates up to the center of the rink. Blur's "Song No. 2" begins to play.]
GAVIN
Good luck, Coach! You're gonna need it! [the ref throws down the puck and the skaters move... and fall over] Yeah! Let's go Adams!
[the spectators look bored. Nothing is happening in the rink except for the Park County goalie picking his nose. The clock shows 5:05 left in the first period]
STAN
Let's go, Park! Come on!
[Still nothing is happening in the rink. An Adams County player waves to his mom, she waves back. The camera moves around excitedly]
GAVIN
That's it, Brian! Kill him! [motions to Stan, then returns to watching the game]
STAN
Get near the puck! [Park County players fall. No one is getting near the puck. No. 15, the goalie, continues picking his nose. Fast forward to the end of the third period. An Adams County player is struggling to keep his bladder in check. One second left in the game]
ANNOUNCER
And that's the end of the game. The result is a tie.
STAN
Tie? Well, what does that mean?
JUDGE
[walks up with his record player and plays it] Stan Marsh was supposed to win it all. The big game. A dying boy's hope. Only problem is, [pulls the needle off the record.] he tied! [puts the needle on another track] And now, he's about to find out that tying isn't the same as winning. [pulls the needle up]
# 10
So did we kill Nelson or not?
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Stan peeks into Nelson's room]
STAN
Hello?
NELSON
Coach.
STAN
How are you feeling?
NELSON
I feel pretty good, except for the cancer. [coughs] Coach? Does God hate me?
DR. DOCTOR
Oh, hello Coach.
STAN
Uh, hi Doc. How's he doing?
DR. DOCTOR
Well, he isn't worse, but, he isn't getting better. It's almost as if... his cancer were tied.
STAN
Oh boy.
NELSON
[coughs] Oh. My cancer hurts.
DR. DOCTOR
He seems to have put all his hope into you winning that game. And with a tie, he's in a kind of... cancer limbo.
STAN
But what can I do?
JUDGE
[rushes into the room with his record player] Stan Marsh! Stan Marsh! Great news! Our hockey team has just been invited to play against Denver County during a Colorado Avalanche game!
NELSON
Wow. [smiles] At the Pepsi Center?
DR. DOCTOR
Look! He's coming around again.
NELSON
That's our biggest game ever. Do you think we can win, Coach?
STAN
Well, ah, I mean...
JUDGE
[sets the record player on the floor and plays it] Imagine. If there was one game, one chance, to make everything right. Stan Marsh is being given that chance. But to win, he's gonna have to pull out all the stops in... "Stanley's Cup"! Rated R. [turns the player off]
STAN
Yeah... yeah, we'll beat 'em.
NELSON
All right! Maybe there IS hope for me.
DR. DOCTOR
[takes Stan aside] Just be aware of this, Coach. If you lose the Big Game, that little boy is going to die faster than Steve Irwin in a tank full of stingrays.
[A restaurant booth, day.]
# 6
Coach! What the hell were you thinking?
# 3
We can't beat Denver County.
STAN
Well, sure we can.
# 6
Last time we played Denver they scored seven times.
STAN
Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything?
# 8
No, 'cause they're gonna kill us.
STAN
They're not gonna kill us.
# 6
That's what Steve Irwin said about those stingrays.
STAN
[thinks a bit] Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end.
# 3
No. In the movies, they always go out and find a kid who's really good to join the team.
STAN
Hey that's right. We need a ringer. [smiles]
# 13
We need a Canadian. [Next thing you see is Ike shooting pucks into the goal. Stan and Kyle watch. Stan smiles.]
# 6
Wow, he's good.
PARK COUNTY
Yeah!
KYLE
Stan, I told you. My mom doesn't want Ike playing hockey. She thinks it's dangerous.
STAN
It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise. [Ike is wearing #2]
PARK COUNTY
Yeah!
KYLE
All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan.
[Stan's room, night. He's drawing up plays for his team to carry out. The camera moves enough to include Randy, in his briets at the door, in the shot]
RANDY
Can you believe it, Stan? The Pepsi Center. You're going back to the place where it all happened. Same place where you missed that shot all those years ago.
STAN
Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now.
RANDY
Ya have to understand why I can't go. I can't... sit there in that same crowd and watch you destroy yourself again. [sits at the foot of the bed] Oh, Stan. Of all the places, why does it have to be the Pepsi Center? All right, all right, I'll go. No, no I WANT to go. [gets up and looks at Stan] I'm gonna be there for you and... I'll be rooting louder than anybody, saying "That's my son!" [turns around and leaves the room, then turns around again] And just remember, Stan: win or lose. Those are your two options, Win, or lose. [turns left and walks away]
[The Pepsi Center at Denver, night. Your Colorado Avalanche vs. The Detroit Red Wings. The match is underway and the Red Wings are on offense. One of the Red Wings fires the puck towards the Denver goal, but the Denver goalie blocks it by catching it with his left glove]
ANNOUNCER
His shot is blocked! What a great save! [a man holds up a banner that reads "GO AVS." The buzzer sounds and the score is tied at 2-2 at the end of the second period] And that's the end of the second period. The score is tied 2-all. [the teams go to their locker rooms] And now please put your hands together for three minutes of exhibition play from some of our state's finest Pee Wee hockey players.
STAN
[at an entrance with his team] All right, you guys, this is it. The moment is here. We've been through a lot together, and according to every movie ever made, we're going to win this game. Just don't forget: there's a little boy in the hospital who's really counting on us. So let's not let him down. Are you with me?! [all the players are with him in their own ways.] All right, let's go win!
OFFICIAL
[rounds the corner and spots them] Sorry boys, you aren't playing tonight.
STAN
Huh?
OFFICIAL
The other Pee Wee hockey team didn't show up. There's nobody for you to play. Thanks for makin' the trip though.
PARK COUNTY
We came to play.
STAN
S-so then we win?
OFFICIAL
No. Nobody wins.
STAN
Hey. Hey, you can't do this. [the Avs come up behind Park County] We've, we've been through all this stupid emotional crap!
OFFICIAL
Well, you've got nobody to play, there's nothing we can do.
STAN
But it isn't supposed to end like this!
AV 1
Hey, hold on a second. If these kids have been through a lot of emotional changes, then they have to play.
AV 2
Yeah.
OFFICIAL
Well, who are they gonna play?
AV 1
They can take our place.
AV 3
Yeah. Let 'em play the Red Wings.
STAN
[turns around and face the Avs] Play the Red Wings?
JUDGE
[pops in with his record player and plays his record] Stan Marsh coaches a Pee Wee hockey team. But now [pulls the needle off the record] they're going to play in the big leagues. [plays his record again] They've got small bodies but big hearts. Stan Marsh is... going professional. [pops out]
AV 1
All right! Give 'em hell, boys!
THE AVS
All right! Yeah!
[The Pepsi Center, night, third period.]
ANNOUNCER
It's a tie game here in Colorado as we get set to start the final period. Your attention, please: for this third and final period, the Detroit Red Wings will be playing... the Park County Pee Wee Hockey Team.
[Spectators return to their seats, and the period begins. The Red Wings take possession of the puck and begin to knock out Park County players left and right. One Red Wing smashes a Park County player into the plastic]
DENVER FANS
OHHHHHHHHH!
STAN
Jesus Christ! [another Red Wing takes the puck to the goal, but kicks another Park County player into the plastic off to the side] Stop! Stop this!
MAN
Let them play!
FANS
Let them play! Let them play! [even Randy is cheering for this. The Red Wing finally fires off the shot... into the goalie]
# 15
EEEK-ugh [lies there, helpless. The shot is good, and the Red Wings get another point.]
[Another Red Wings skates up to # 7, jumps, and steps on his face with the edge of the skate, then skates away]
STAN
Hey, can they do that??
IKE
[another Red Wing beats him to a bloody pulp] Ow, no. Oh! [a Red Wing fires the puck at # 8 and draws blood out his mouth]
# 8
AAAGH! [the Red Wings fire pucks into the goal at will and rack up lots of points. For some reason, there's a 4th period and the score is 31-2 Detroit. One final shot from Detroit and the final score is 32-2]
A RED WING
Yeah! We did it! We did it! [Queen's "We Are The Champions" begins to play]
[Red Wing fans celebrate the victory. Red Wings skate around the rink and hug spontaneously, and hi-five each other.]
RANDY
NOOO! NOT AGAIN! NOOO! [Sharon restrains him. Red Wings 14 and 30 French-kiss]
# 6
[with a black left eye and a bloody mouth] I hate you, Coach. I hate you. [The Red Wings coach kisses his wife, then shakes an older man's hand]
RED WINGS COACH
Thank you, Dad.
FORMER COACH
I'm proud of you, boy. [they give each other a long, warm hug. An NHL official takes a huge trophy over to the Red Wings coach and his team]
[Nelson's room at Hell's Pass Hospital. Large text blinks "Red Wings Win!" green and yellow on his television.]
FANS
Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings!
NELSON
No hope. No... hope... [dies right there, and his vitals flatline]
FANS
Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! [the coach celebrates his victory by waving the trophy around]
End of Stanley's Cup
