[South Park Elementary, Garrison's class. A group of visiting kids in yellow G.G.W.K. shirts stands next to Garrison.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, we have a special guest today, a woman recruiting young people [she walks to the group and smiles] for a national choir tour. Now I know that choir tours are totally stupid and lame [she frowns], but please, give her your full attention. [to her] Go ahead.
MS. STEVENS
Uh. Thank you, Mr. Garrison. [cheerfully] How are we all doing today?! [the kids' eyes wander] I can't hear you! I said, How are we all doing?! [Cartman farts]
MR. GARRISON
[angrily] Eric Cartman, you say ‘’excuse me”!
CARTMAN
Okay.
MR. GARRISON
[to the choir teacher] Go ahead.
MS. STEVENS
Children, we are a national choir called, "Getting Gay With Kids!" We're gonna do a big tour down in Central America to help save the rainforest, and you can be a part of it!
KENNY
(That sounds fucking screwed.) [the others laugh]
MR. GARRISON
Kenny McCormick, you speak when you're spoken to!! [to the choir teacher] Go ahead.
MS. STEVENS
You see, we take kids from all over the country and put them in a choir [Pip yawns and Bill notices. Clyde nods off] where we sing and dance to raise awareness about our vanishing rainforest.
JAKE
[steps forward] Did you know over 10,000 acres of rainforest are bulldozed every year?
KELLY
[steps forward] That's right. And over 30% of the world's oxygen [Kenny sees her and begins to swoon] is made in the rainforest. [smiles back at him. Kenny's in love - ahem, distracted. The camera stays on him]
MS. STEVENS
So, who wants to join the fun??
CARTMAN
What if you don't have any rhythm?
MS. STEVENS
Excuse me?
CARTMAN
Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm.
KYLE
Shut up, fatass!
STAN
Choirs suck.
MR. GARRISON
Kyle Broflovski, you watch your language!! Eric Cartman, you be nice to people!! Stan Marsh, you mind your manners!! Kenny McCormick, you pay attention!! [sighs deeply and tells the choir teacher] Go ahead.
MS. STEVENS
Well, uh, that's all, really. [the girl picks her nose, smiling at Kenny] So, if anyone is interested in seeing the rainforest and joining our choir, I'll leave information packets up front.
CARTMAN
Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper. [the other kids laugh]
MR. GARRISON
All right, that does it!!
[Mr. Mackey's office. Craig isn't sitting on the bench outside, as he usually is.]
MR MACKEY
[behind the door] I am tired of seeing you in my office, young man! [The camera is now inside] You get sent here every day, Craig!
CRAIG TUCKER
I know.
MR. MACKEY
Why can’t you behave?
CRAIG
...I don’t know.
MR. MACKEY
What do you have to say for yourself?! [nothing] Well, I tell you what, young man. Uh, you're gonna be held back a grade if you don't luh- [Craig sticks his right middle finger up] Did you just flip me off?
CRAIG
No.
MR. MACKEY
Yes you did, you just flipped me the bird! Now, see? This is exactly what I'm talking about! If you don't shape up, m'kay, and get your head straight, uh- [Craig flips Mr. Mackey off again] There! You just flipped me off again!
CRAIG
No I didn’t.
MR. MACKEY
Yes you did! And until you stop flipping people off, you can just go back to the waiting room, m'kay?! Next! [Craig hops off the chair as the door opens. The boys enter.] Well, well, well, if it isn't Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Eric. [Craig exits]
KYLE
Hey, Craig.
CARTMAN
Hey, don't flip me off, you son of a bitch!
MR. MACKEY
Sit down, boys. Now, let's see. What did Mr. Garrison send you in here for? The boys were being rude while a choir teacher was giving some stupid presentation-
STAN
It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.
MR. MACKEY
Uh, young man, "Getting Gay With Kids" is not dumb, m'kay? It just so happens that I'm on the board of directors.
KYLE
Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use pre-recorded tapes.
MR. MACKEY
Well, guess what, boys? I think that "Getting Gay With Kids" is just what you need. I'm gonna sign up all four of you.
STAN
What?!
KYLE
You can't do that! [Cartman's jaw drops]
KENNY
(Woohoo!) [the boys look at him] (I mean, 'Oh...') [looks down]
MR. MACKEY
I think this will be very good for you [writes their names down]
STAN
But we don't even care about the rainforest.
MR. MACKEY
And that's exactly why you need to go!
CARTMAN
[drops down and pleads] Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey.
[Kyle's house, some days later. The Get Gay With Kids bus pulls up to Kyle's house to pick up Kyle, Cartman, and Stan.]
SHEILA
Be safe, Kyle. Bring me something back from the rainforest.
MS. STEVENS
Oh, nonono. The rainforest is very fragile. We must take only pictures and leave only footprints.
SHEILA
Oh, I didn't realize.
JAKE
Did you know that right now, bulldozers are tearing down thousands of acres of rainforest every day?
CARTMAN
[as he enters the bus] Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls.
STAN
[As Sharon drags him to the bus] Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!
SHARON
Stan, you should be excited. I would love to see the rainforest. Besides, your dad and I need some time alone. [tosses him into the bus]
STAN
Nooo-ho! [The door closes and the bus pulls away. Stan and Kyle look out the back window in dismay]
MS. STEVENS
Okay, children, that's all of us. We're ready to head for the Latin American nation of Costa Rica, a country filled with virgin rainforest.
CARTMAN
Whoopee.
MS. STEVENS
And you must be Eric Cartman. I've heard about you. You don't respect nature or other cultures.
CARTMAN
Yeah, pretty much.
MS. STEVENS
Well, I'm gonna change the way you think, kiddo.
CHOIR GIRL
[Kenny sits next to her] My name's Kelly.
KENNY
(My name’s Kenny.)
KELLY
Lenny?
KENNY
(No, Kenny.)
KELLY
Johnny?
KENNY
(KENNY!)
KELLY
Oh. [looks away and picks her nose.]
CHOIR GIRL
Now, we've got a looong trip ahead of us, so let's take the opportunity to learn our choreography.
CARTMAN
[hushed] The nightmare begins.
[The bus rolls along. A map pops up, showing the bus's route, and Latin music plays. It crosses the border at Mexicali, goes down the Baja peninsula, takes a ferry to Mexico and cuts across the North to the Gulf, then snakes down Central America to Costa Rica. They arrive at San José.]
MS. STEVENS
Oh, look, children! I think we're entering San José, which is the capital of Costa Rica. [the kids move to their windows and look out] Oh! This is so exciting!
CARTMAN
Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is!
MS. STEVENS
Eric, Costa Rica is a Third-World country. These people are much poorer than those in the U.S.
CARTMAN
Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?! [Throws open his window and yells] Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college!
MS. STEVENS
Eric, sit down!
CARTMAN
[sits] Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny? [Kenny looks at him angrily] Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor.
KENNY
[to Kelly] (Argh! That's not true.)
KELLY
[picks her nose] Your family isn't poor? [picks her nose]
CARTMAN
Whoa, dude, look over there! [The bus stops. There are three women in front of a shop. A man has just dropped them off, pays them and drives away, and they wave at him.] Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys!
REDHEADED PROSTITUTE
[with heavy accent] What are chu looking at, man?
MIDDLE PROSTITUTE
Yeah, why don't chu take a peekture?
CARTMAN
Okay. [pretends] Cleek! [grins]
MS. STEVENS
Eric, SIT DOWN!
[The bus stops at the Centro Nacional de Costa Rica and all exit.]
MS. STEVENS
Kids, this is the Costa Rican Capitol building. This is where all the leaders of the Costa Rican government make their-
CARTMAN
[rushing out] Oh my God, [covers his nose] it smells like ass out here.
MS. STEVENS
Alll right, that does it! [turns Cartman around] Eric Cartman, you respect other cultures this instant!
CARTMAN
[covers his nose again] I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass.
KELLY
Wow, seeing a place like this really makes you appreciate living in America, huh?
KENNY
[in bliss] (Uh-huh.) [Kelly picks her nose again]
MS. STEVENS
You may think that making fun of Third-World countries is funny, but let me-
CARTMAN
I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!
MS. STEVENS
Eric, will you please, please, just keep your mouth shut while we present ourselves to the Costa Rican President?
CARTMAN
Why?
MS. STEVENS
Because I'll buy you some ice cream afterwards if you do.
CARTMAN
Eh-heheh!
[Inside the Capitol. All seem to be facing the President.]
MS. STEVENS
Well, it was a long trip, but the children are very excited to sing tomorrow.
EL PRESIDENTE
[long pause] ¿Qué?
MS. STEVENS
Uh, we're, uh, we're the choir? That, that was sent from... the United States?
EL PRESIDENTE
[long pause] ¿Qué?
MS. STEVENS
We're the group singing for the "Save The Rainforest" summit tomorrow? [her head is cocked way to the left by now. El Presidente has no clue. Now the teacher is worried] Oh dear, where's, where's Mr. Mackey? He should have been here by now. [faces the kids] Children, do any of you speak Spanish? [Cartman waves his left arm] Don't you dare! [the main door opens]
MR. MACKEY
[rushing in] Sorry I'm late.
MS. STEVENS
Ogh! Thank goodness you're here; I don't speak any Spanish.
MR. MACKEY
Oh, no problem. [to El Presidente and his men] Usted es choir de Estados Unidos, mbien?
EL PRESIDENTE
¡O! ¡O! Save The Rainforest.
MS. STEVENS
Yeess!
EL PRESIDENTE
Pablo los llevará en un tur de la jungla. [Pablo appears]
MR. MACKEY
Uh, he says Pablo here will take you on a rainforest tour.
MS. STEVENS
Oh boy! Mr. Presidente, round up your subjects outside. We have a special gift for you. The gift... uh-of song. [moves aside]
EL PRESIDENTE
[long pause] ¿Qué?
[On the Capitol steps.]
MS. STEVENS
All right, children, Let's get in our rows quickly, so we can begin.
KELLY
[walks over to Kenny, her partner] Did you remember all the choreography, Lenny?
KENNY
(Yeah, I think so.)
MS. STEVENS
Hello, everybody. This is just a little rehearsal for tomorrow, so we may be a little rusty. [chuckles and shrugs. The people just look. She presses the play button. The kids begin to dance to the music]
THE TAPE
[Intro] Tootin' tootin' to, tada choo choo wow!
[Men sing]There's a place that is magical, and full of rain.
[Women sing] But now it needs help, because it is in pain.
[Men sing] Cleaning the earth is a mighty big chore
[All sing] We're spreading awareness like never before!
[Chorus] Getting Gay With Kids is here! [Kyle is out of step now]
To spread the word and bring you cheer
Let's save the rainforest! What do you say?!
Being an activist is totally gay!

[Bridge. Man sings] Someday if we work hard, boys and girls,
[Woman sings] There'll be nothing but rainforests covering the entire world!
[Man joins her] World!
[Chorus. Kids rush into the audience and bring some members back as new partners]
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
To spread the word and bring you cheer. Yeah!
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
Let's save the rainforest! It's totally gay!
It's totally gay!
[The kids regroup and Kyle stumbles into place. The tape is stopped and the subjects just walk away]
MS. STEVENS
Great job, gang! You were really all over the place, Kyle.
KYLE
Thanks!
CARTMAN
I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!
KYLE
Fuck off, Cartman!
STAN
No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right.
KYLE
[alarmed] No! That's a stereotype.
STAN
Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm. [Camera closes in on a stunned Kyle]
[Next day, the sun rises over a sea of green, the canopy of the rainforest. The choir teacher and her group are touring with Pablo.]
PABLO
This is now secondary rainforest we are entering. Notice the canopy of foliage.
MS. STEVENS
Oh, it's everything I ever dreamed it would be!
KYLE
God-damn, it's hot out here!
STAN
[sees a branch] Aaah! Snake!
KYLE
No, dude. That's a branch.
STAN
Oh. [sees it again] Aaah! Snake!
KYLE
No. That's the same branch again.
STAN
Oh.
PABLO
[turns and stops the group] The rainforest is very delicate, and we must take steps to protect it.
CARTMAN
[impatient] Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah. [Pablo looks at him] We hear this a million times back up in the States.
PABLO
Here! Look! These are squirrel monkeys. [one sits in a tree, resting] Endangered inhabitants of the rainforest.
KELLY
Wow! Isn't he neat, Lenny? [takes a picture]
CARTMAN
[takes a branch and starts beating the monkey] Bad! Bad monkey! [it screams in pain]
MS. STEVENS
Eric, what the heck are you doing?? [the monkey flees]
CARTMAN
[stops] I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, “Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!” and I smack him on the head!
PABLO
And here is a three-toed sloth. [hangs from a branch with all four legs]
CARTMAN
[takes the branch and starts beating the sloth] It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth!
MS. STEVENS
[pulls him away] Eric, for God's sake, knock it off!!
CARTMAN
[throws the branch at the sloth] Re’spect my authoritah!
MS. STEVENS
Well, Mr. Pedro, this was a great tour, but I guess we should be getting back. We have a big concert tomorrow, Don't we, kids?!
KIDS
YEAH!
JAKE
I wish we could have seen the Yanagopa.
KYLE
What's the Yanagopa?
MS. STEVENS
The Yanagopa are gentle native people that live in the rainforest, but bulldozers are destroying their homes. Soon, they will have nowhere to go. So we must stop bulldozing the rainforest so that they can live-!
CARTMAN
[fed up, buries his face in his mitts] Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!!
STAN
AAAAAAA! [hides behind a girl]
MS. STEVENS
Stanley, what is it?
STAN
SNAAAKE! [all see and gasp]
PABLO
[standing next to the snake wrapped around a tree trunk] Oh, yes. Uh this is what we call a coral snake. Notice the red markings. Quite an amazing creature.
STAN
AAAAAAA! [runs farther back]
PABLO
What's the matter, little boy?
CARTMAN
He's a little wuss, what's it look like? [Stan is hiding behind some foliage]
STAN
[lifts some away] I'm just a-scared of snakes.
PABLO
Naw, naw. You must remember. This snake is more afraid of us than we are of it. [the snake jumps out of the tree and wraps itself around him, suffocating him] Oh!! [the snake bites him all over the face. Stan looks and drops the foliage so as to hide, and Pablo falls] Agh.
MS. STEVENS
[in horror] Oh my God!! [the snake starts swallowing Pablo]
CARTMAN
Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right!
MS. STEVENS
[petrified] Jesus Christ, is he dead?! [Pablo's bones come out of the snake's anus]
STAN
Dude!
KYLE
My guess would be yes.
MS. STEVENS
Oh, no! God, no, no! [spins around] Don't panic, children.
CARTMAN
[beats the snake, which turns and comes at him] Bad! That's a bad snay-ah! [hurries away, and the snake gives chase]
[The sun sets over the rainforest. The choir teacher now guides the group…]
MS. STEVENS
Maybe we came from that way. [points to her left] No, nno. Let's try this way. [points to her right and moves that way]
KELLY
[walking behind Kenny] Benny? Do you think we're gonna be okay?
KENNY
[stops] (Yeah. Everything is fine.)
KELLY
That's good. Can I tell you something?
KENNY
(Okay.)
KELLY
I think I like you. [holds his shoulder]
KENNY
(Really?!)
KELLY
[releases] Yeah. I mean, I think we communicate really well.
KENNY
(Oh, that's great!)
KELLY
[looks away] No, that's not good.
KENNY
(That's not good?)
KELLY
No. See, if I start to like you too much, [looks away] I'm only going to get my heart broken. 'Cause we live on opposite ends of the country. [looks at him again] Once this choir tour is over, we'll never see each other again. [grabs him and gets emotional] And that would devastate me. [lets go] So I can't have any feelings for you, I just can't, Lenny! [walks away]
KENNY
[pissed] (Aaaargh!)
MS. STEVENS
Oh, children, the sun is setting. We have to find our way out of here quick!
[The sun sets and the moon appears over the rainforest. Lightning flashes and the camera slowly drops to ground cover.]
MS. STEVENS
Whoa-kay, okay, everything is just fine, kids. Now it is important that we all stick together. Is everybody still here?
A BOY
I’m not.
MS. STEVENS
Who's not?!
A BOY
Me.
KELLY
Benny, will you hold my hand? [picks her nose. When she lowers her hand, Kenny grabs it, but she looks away] I don't want to get emotionally attached, though.
STAN
Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!
[Lightning flashes and the group is seen sitting in a row on the ground with Tony Danza visible seated in the middle next to the choir teacher.]
MS. STEVENS
No, you didn't just see Tony Danza, Stanley.
[Next day. The sun rises over the Centro Nacional. A rooster crows. A massive stage is prepared for the Save the Rain Forest summit. It looks like an amphitheater, with a scaffold holding ten speakers over the stage and bullhorns atop the pillars. Balloons and a Save the Rain Forest banner are also anchored to the scaffold.]
EL PRESIDENTE
[on stage] Bueno, bueno. Pongan el arcoiris al lado de las tortugas muertas. (Put the rainbow next to the picture of dying sea turtles.) [the worker moves along]
MR. MACKEY
[approaching] Buenos dias, Señor Presidente, ¿mbien? (Hello, El Presidente)
EL PRESIDENTE
¿Qué tal? ¿Está todo bien? (Oh hello. Is everything going okay?)
MR. MACKEY
Uh, muy bien. Señor Presidente, um... ¿Usted no ha visto el coro, no, mm-hm bien? (Oh fine, fine... You, uh, haven't seen the choir have you?)
EL PRESIDENTE
¡¿QUÉ?! (WHAT?!)
MR. MACKEY
Parece que anoche no regresaron al hotel, hmbien. (Well, they never came back to the hotel last night...)
EL PRESIDENTE
¡¿Está bromeando, Mackey?! ¡¡¡Más de cien mil personas atenderán este evento!!! ¡¿Y me dice usted que no tendré a mis chiquitos lindos para que les canten?! (You've got to be kidding!! I have over a hundred thousand people coming to this event!!! Are you telling me that I have no darling little kids to sing to them?!)
MR. MACKEY
Estoy seguro que-uh-mmm, que-aaah llega- llegarán. No se preocupe. Eh, olvidelo, ¿yeah-mbien? (I am sure they'll get here. No problem, forget I said anything.)
[At the same time, in the rainforest, the group rises and marches on.]
KYLE
Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!
KELLY
We are?
MS. STEVENS
Don't worry, Kelly. We're gonna find our way out of the rainforest and make it back to the concert in time. We just need to respect our mother rainforest so that she will respect us.
KYLE
Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back.
MS. STEVENS
Oh, really? Could you brush it off? [shows her backpack, and a huge insect half her size growls on it]
KYLE
Um, no.
MS. STEVENS
[panics] Oh, boy oh!! Oh my God, get it off me!! For the love of God, get it off me!! Oh my God!! [the insect growls and falls silent. Miss Stevens returns] Oh-okay, children. We must understand that the insects of the rainforest help the delicate balance of life here. [sees the insect, still on her back] Oh my God!! [runs off]
KYLE
Rainforests suck! I wanna go home!
KELLY
Me, too! [the rest start to groan]
MS. STEVENS
Shh. Children, okay, let's try to listen to what the rainforest tells us. And if we use our ears she can tell us so many things. Perhaps-
KYLE
[Kyle runs into an adult] Aaaaa! There's a dude here! [a soldier holding a shotgun]
MS. STEVENS
Oh, thank goodness! Hello, sir. We are lost. [giggles] Cah heh, can you help us?
SOLIDER
¿Qué?
CARTMAN
[moves forward] Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca. [the soldier listens] We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos. [rubs his belly]
STAN
I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme.
CARTMAN
Y taco.
KYLE
I want two tostadas and mild sauce.
CARTMAN
Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.
MS. STEVENS
Boys, please. Not every Spanish person eats tacos and burritos. That's a stereotype. [the soldier points a way out with his thumb] Children, he wants us to follow him! Oooh, thank goodness! I think this ordeal is over! [they leave]
[The group arrives at a military camp deep in the rainforest. Soldiers go about their maneuvers. The kids pass a small barbed-wire bunker.]
STAN
This doesn't look very safe.
KYLE
Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.
MS. STEVENS
Now kids, let's be a bit more open-minded. I read all about this in Newsweek; this is a people's army. They are fighting the fascist policies of their fascist government. [addresses them with a lilt] Oh, hello. Do you speak of English?
PEOPLE'S ARMY LEADER
[crisp] Who are you?!
MS. STEVENS
Oh, wonderful! We were lost, and it is such a great coincidence we found you. You see, we're here to protest the government-sanctioned raping of your rainforest. [the soldiers just stare] We are fighters, just like you. Could you help us get back to San José? [no response] Um... [thinks] Oh, I know! Perhaps you would like a gift. Well, we have o-honly-hee one gift to give. The gift... of song [she moves aside]
KIDS
Honh. [she presses the play button, and the song plays. The kids begin to dance]
MS. STEVENS
[through clenched teeth] Kyle, for the love of God, do the right choreography. [as the chorus nears, Kyle is still doing the wrong moves] Oh, Kyle, please! [the kids dance through the first line of the chorus...]
PEOPLE'S ARMY LEADER
Enough! [the music stops]
MS. STEVENS
Well, we hope that our gift of song has warmed your hearts.
PEOPLE'S ARMY LEADER
We're not getting gay with any kids, okay?
MS. STEVENS
Uh, yah, soooo, do you have a phone we could use?
PEOPLE'S ARMY LEADER
Heehee yes, we have a phone. It's right over there next to the 12-person jacuzzi. [the other men begin to laugh] Now, get out of here before we kill you!
MS. STEVENS
[sullen] Is it because of the little Jewish boy's choreography?
KYLE
Hey!
PEOPLE'S ARMY LEADER
[the soldier next to him cocks his shotgun] You white Americans make me sick! [emphasizes his disgust with thumps on the table] You waste food, oil, and everything else because you're so rich, and then you tell the rest of the world to save the rainforest because you like its pretty flowers.
[Two Costa Rican soldiers can be seen behind the gasoline barrels. They pop up and open fire. The people's army immediately responds, and bullets fly everywhere. The kids scream.]
PEOPLE'S ARMY LEADER
[waving the choir away] ¡Rápido, rápido! [Kenny steps in front of Kelly to shield her from any shots coming their way]
MS. STEVENS
Run, children, run! [the choir moves out]
[Back in San José.]
EL PRESIDENTE
¡¿Dónde putos está el coro?! ¡El espectáculo comienza pronto! (Where the hell is our choir?! The show is supposed to start soon!)
MR. MACKEY
No se preocupe, ¿mbien? El Presidente, estarán aquí. Este evento es muy importante para que la maestra del coro se lo pierda. ¿M-m-mbien? (Don't worry, El Presidente, they'll be here. This is too important for the choir teacher to miss.)
[Back in the rainforest. The choir now walks along a riverbank.]
MS. STEVENS
Hello?? Anybody?? Help??
JAKE
Wow, look at the pretty flower. [stops by to touch a huge yellow flower with blue support on a large green stalk]
MS. STEVENS
Oh nonono, Jake. That fragile flower is very delicate, okay? [before she could finish the sentence, the flower wraps its petals around Jake and pulls him off the floor.]
JAKE
Aaaah. Ugh, help!
MS. STEVENS
[quakes] Ga-ow! [quickly grabs Jake's feet and pulls. The choir walks on]
KELLY
[crying and pouting] I wanna go home! [Kenny stops and turns] I hate the rainforest!
KENNY
[walks up and puts his arm around her] (Oh, there, there now. There's nothing to be afraid of, dear.) [comforted, she smiles]
KELLY
[gushing] Oh Lenny, hold me. [moves away] No, I can't get attached. [pause, then moves closer] Oh, but I do like you.
KENNY
(Well, I like you-)
KELLY
[moves away] Oh, but you're only going to leave me.
KENNY
[pissed] (Oh, God damn it!)
[San José. The reporters for the telecast have arrived and are in position.]
SHORT REPORTER
We're here live in San José, Costa Rica, where hundreds of rich Americans have gathered for the Save the Rain Forest summit. Everyone is here so they can feel good about themselves, and act like they aren't the ones responsible for the rainforest's peril.
SLIM REPORTER
That's right, Bob, and of course the main attraction today is the darling kids' choir, "Getting Gay With Kids," all of whom must be backstage preparing at this very moment.
[The rainforest. The terrain looks familiar…]
MS. STEVENS
[the problems mount] Oh, there's just no end to this place! I think maybe we're going in circles. Oh, dear God! The summit starts in an hour; I'm gonna lose my job! [another large insect roars behind her backpack, and she jumps] Aaaah!
CARTMAN
[turns and walks back the way they came] This is bullcrap! I am not following this stupid hippie around anymore.
MS. STEVENS
Eric, where are you going?
CARTMAN
I'm going this way!
MS. STEVENS
Young man, I am the adult here, and I say you go this way!
CARTMAN
[stops] Look: you can stay over nyah [gestures towards her], but I'm going over nyah. [Gestures away from her]
MS. STEVENS
Young man, I have had it!!
CARTMAN
Nononono! You nyah, me nyah! [gestures forward and backward] Screw you guys, I'ma going home. [walks away]
MS. STEVENS
Good! You deserve to die, you little bastard! [the others watch him leave] Eric, we have to stay together!
[Eric moves through the rainforest.]
CARTMAN
God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat- [finds himself at a clearing full of bulldozers moving wood around] Yes! I knew it! I'm saved! [rushes in]
[Back by the river.]
STAN
Hey. Maybe Cartman was right.
KYLE
Yeah. It happened once before.
MS. STEVENS
No. The Spirit of Maya has told me to go this way.
[At the clearing.]
CARTMAN
[reaches the foreman] Mister! You've gotta help me! I'm starving to death!
FOREMAN
What are you doing here, little boy?
CARTMAN
I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast!
FOREMAN
Lost in the rainforest? Oh, my Lord! Where are all the others?
CARTMAN
Food! I have to have food! [falls on his face]
FIREMAN
Oh my God! Get this child some food, quick!
CARTMAN
[lifts his head] Chicken wings. [drops it]
FOREMAN
Chicken wings!
CARTMAN
[lifts his head] Medium spicy. [drops it]
[San José]
CROWD
Start the show! Start the show! Start the show!
EL PRESIDENTE
La gente está ansiosa. Dentro de poco, se alborotan y empiezan a tirar chorchadas. (The activists are getting anxious. They will start throwing things soon.)
MR. MACKEY
Estoy seguro que llegarán. Eh-sólo poquito más de tiempo, ¿mbien? (I'm sure the choir will be here. We just need a little more time)
EL PRESIDENTE
Bueno, voy a entretenerlos con mis chistes de Polacos. [heads for center stage] (Well, I will try and amuse them with my Polish Jokes.)
MR. MACKEY
Mbien.
EL PRESIDENTE
[on the mike] ¿A cuántos Polacos les toma a comerse un burrito? [the crowd is silent. He holds up two fingers] Dos. [seeing no reaction, he laughs, then tries again] ¿A cuántos Polacos les toma a manejar a Panamá? (How many Pollacks does it take to eat a burrito? Two. How many Pollacks does it take to drive to Panama?)
[In the rainforest, the choir keeps walking.]
MS. STEVENS
Oh God, this is a nightmare! We're never going to make the festival!
STAN
Hey, look over there. Isn't that smoke? [a column of smoke is seen floating above the canopy]
MS. STEVENS
Let's go, quickly! [they rush towards the column and find a small campfire]
KYLE
Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people. [the shrubs around them rustle, and they face the shrubs. Some big-lipped dwarves surround them.]
MS. STEVENS
Children, it's the Yanagopa. [to the dwarves] Do not be afraid. We are not here to tear down your rainforest. [the group is surrounded by spear-bearing Yanagopa men.]
YANAGOPA 1
Damtilié?
YANAGOPA 2
Damtilié?
MS. STEVENS
[marveling] Look how they live in peace with all living things. Gentle, noble... [the Yanagopa raise their spears high] Run for your lives, children!
STAN
Holy crap! [all run]
YANAGOPA
[giving chase and throwing spears] Damtilié! Damtilié! Damtilié!
STAN
Jesus Christ!
MS. STEVENS
Run run ruuun! [A huge insect lands on her backpack and roars. She looks back and the insect flies away] Waaah!
KELLY
[trips and falls down] Aaaaa! Lenny! [Kenny goes back, helps her up, and they keep running. The choir runs across a puddle of quicksand and begin to sink]
KYLE
What the hell?
STAN
We're sinking.
MS. STEVENS
It's quicksand, people! [the Yanagopa warriors surround them and leap with excitement, still screaming "Damtilié!"]
[The Yanagopa village. Heads of unfortunate trespassers hang on poles. An abandoned camera is among them. Further on, the choir is found seated around a campfire... tied up individually.]
STAN
All we ever heard growing up was, "Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile"!
KYLE
Yeah! Fragile my ass!
KELLY
Larry, if we make it out of this, I want to be your girlfriend. Even if we do live in different places, I don't care! [snuggles up to him]
KENNY
(Kelly, you said it!) [she tries to pick her nose, but the ropes won't let her]
[The Yanagopa men are apparently no different than other men. They have dressed Miss Stevens in a skimpy home-made red-and-white cheerleading outfit, complete with pom-poms, then strung her up between two trees. They dance around her, chanting "Damtilié"]
MS. STEVENS
[put off] Okay. Just what the heck is going on here, people? [a giant Yanagopa rises from the brush and his voice rumbles across the rainforest. She responds] AAAAA!!
KELLY
Oh no, that big thing is going to make love to Miss Stevens!
MS. STEVENS
All right, that does it!! [the men stop dancing] Goddamn stupid-ass rainforest!! This place fucking sucks!! [the giant Yanagopa is shocked] I was wrong!! Fuck the rainforest!! I fucking hate it, I fucking hate it!!
STAN
Oh, now she figures it out.
[A bulldozer appears, driven by the foreman.]
FOREMAN
Quick! Everybody help the children!
[More bulldozers enter and spread out. The workers go after the Yanagopa and chase them away. The children brighten up considerably. One bulldozer scoops up a group of Yanagopa and crushes them against a tree, killing them, then backs up over a coral snake, crushing it to bits, then rolls forward over a large insect, crushing it.]
STAN
Wow!
KYLE
Dude! Bulldozers rule!
FOREMAN
[cutting the ropes off the kids] Come on! Let's get you back to civilization!
KIDS
HOORAY!!
MS. STEVENS
[being cut down by a worker] Hooray, children!
[Later, Miss Stevens is back in her regular clothes and sits on a gasoline barrel. Kyle sits on another one, and the rest of the kids take positions all over the bulldozer. All sip lemonade.]
MS. STEVENS
How did you know where we were?
FOREMAN
Your little friend helped me out.
MS. STEVENS
Eric?
CARTMAN
[arriving] Who'd you expect? Merv Griffin?
MS. STEVENS
What exactly are you guys doing out here, with all this ...construction equipment?
FOREMAN
We're clearing out big sections of the rainforest for a lumberyard.
MS. STEVENS
Really? [excited] That's great!!
FOREMAN
You mean, you don't mind?
MS. STEVENS
Nooo, I hate the rainforest! You go right ahead and plow down this whole fucking thing!
FOREMAN
That’s swell!
KELLY
Okay, Benny. So in order for our long-distance relationship to work, we'll have to call each other every other day.
KENNY
(Okay. I can do that.) [lightning strikes him, knocking her away] (Christ!) [he falls, she gets up and goes to him]
KELLY
Aaaah! Lenny! No! [Stan and Kyle rush in]
STAN
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
KYLE
You bastards!
KELLY
[turns to face them] Whah?? Who?! Who killed him?!
STAN
They did.
KELLY
Who's "they"?!
STAN
[pause] You know, "they."
KYLE
They're... they're bastards.
KELLY
Well don't just stand there, help him!!
KYLE
What?
STAN
Help ...him?
KELLY
Aaagh! [turns around and pounds on Kenny's chest] Come on, Benny! Breathe! [she tries giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, then pounds on his chest again] Breathe, you son of a bitch! [she picks her nose, then pounds some more. Kenny coughs, and she listens]
KYLE
Whoa, dude!
[San José. The choir is now at the Save the Rain Forest summit stage.]
SUMMIT HOST
And now, here to teach us about the rainforest is Getting Gay With Kids. [the crowd applauds]
MS. STEVENS
Does everybody remember the new lyrics? [the kids nod yes] And…
THE NEW LYRICS
[Intro] Tootin' tootin' to, tada choo choo wow!
[Men sing] There's a place called the rainforest; it truly sucks ass.
[Women sing] Let's knock it all down and get rid of it fast.
[Men sing] You say, "Save the rainforest," but what do you know?
[All sing] You've never been to the rainforest before.
[Chorus] Getting Gay With Kids is here! [Kyle still can't dance]
To tell you things you might not like to hear. [Kenny and Kelly exchange glances]
You only fight these causes 'cause caring sells.
All you activists can go fuck yourselves!
MALE ACTIVIST
That was so inspiring.
FEMALE ACTIVIST
What a wonderful message.
THE NEW LYRICS, PART II
[Bridge. Man sings] Someday if we work hard, boys and girls,
Each year, the Rainforest is responsible for over three thousand deaths from accidents, attacks or illnesses.
[Woman sings] There'll be no more rainforests left in the entire world!
There are over seven hundred things in the Rainforest that cause cancer.
[Man joins her] World!
Join the fight now and help stop the Rainforest before it's too late.
[Chorus]
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
To spread the word and bring you cheer. Yeah!

synopsis:When South Park citizens start randomly exploding, the mayor enlists the town's only geologist Randy Marsh to find the cause and solution. Stan, Kyle and Cartman reenact the Stations of the Cross.

script:Spontaneous Combustion

[General Store. The boys are shopping…]
STAN
[with an air pump] Is this what you're looking for, Kyle?
KYLE
No, I don't think so.
KENNY
[bringing a hair dryer] (How about this?)
KYLE
No, that's a hair dryer!
MANAGER
May I help you find something?
KYLE
Yeah. Do you have any "nurections"?
MANAGER
Any what?
KYLE
I need to get a nurection for my dad.
MANAGER
Very funny, boys. Go on, beat it. [gestures to the exit with his thumb]
STAN
Why is that funny?
KYLE
Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one. [the boys are suddenly outside, with the door slamming shut behind them] Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody? [the boys walk away]
STAN
That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?
KENNY
(I know, fucking seriously!)
KYLE
I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.
MAN
[walks by with his lady] What?
KENNY
(Well, see you guys. I gotta go take the bus out of town.)
CARTMAN
Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again?
KENNY
(Yeah, dude. She saved me.)
CARTMAN
Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't-
KENNY
(Ach.) [Poof. Stan and Kyle turn. All three are left looking at a charred body]
STAN
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
KYLE
You bastards!
CARTMAN
What the hell happened to him?
STAN
He just... ignited.
MAN
[rushing up] What happened?
WOMAN
[rushing up] I saw it from across the street. He just caught on fire. [Barbrady drives up and screeches to a halt]
OFFICER BARBRADY
[rushes up to the boys] Okay people, stand back. Give the little burnt boy some breathing room.
BLOND MAN
I've heard about this. This is... spontaneous combustion. But it usually only happens to fat people near open flames.
MAN 2
Is it contagious?
WOMAN
Am I going to spontaneously combust?
MAN 3
I hope it doesn't happen to me.
WOMAN
This is very scary.
[City Hall,the Mayor's office. The Mayor is talking with someone.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
The people are panicking about spontaneous combustion. That's why I've assembled this crack team of scientists to find out the cause of the phenomenon. You are the best scientific mind South Park has to offer.
RANDY
...Uuuh. Mayor, I'm a geologist.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Right.
RANDY
Well, uh I don't study human biology, I study the earth.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Look, you're the only scientist that lives in this town. You have to find an answer before more people combust. You do that, and you'll be the most beloved man in South Park. [Randy begins to daydream]
[The Most Beloved Man In South Park. Hands move him over the crowd.]
CROWD
Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!
MAN
We love you, Randy.
WOMAN
[rushing up] Make love to me, Randy. Please!
[Returns.]
RANDY
Wow.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Marsh, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you! Find the cause of spontaneous combustion, or else!
RANDY
Or else what?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[pounds on her desk] Exactly!
[First Church of South Park. The organ is heard as people gather for Kenny's funeral. Inside, Stan and Kyle hop up to the bier the coffin is on. Cartman tries a couple of times and finally makes it.]
STAN
Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on.
KYLE
Yeah. [The boys hop off the bier and move to the front row for the service as Priest Maxi approaches the coffin. He opens the Bible and reads]
PRIEST MAXI
The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Sometimes the giveth seems a little disproportionate to the taketh. There seems to be a lot more takething going on, but there it is. Perhaps if more of you attended church on Sundays [Kevin falls asleep, Stuart reads Gazongas magazine and checks out its centerfold while his wife sniffs], the Lord would not have felt it necessary to punish us by takething this little boy…
MR. GARRISON
[to man to his left] Oh, here comes the guilt trip again.
PRIEST MAXI
Now, let us pray. [all close their eyes and bow their heads] Lord, though we have lost Neil Smith to free agency and Steve Atwater to the Jets, still, we hope our beloved Broncos can bring home another Super Bowl championship, and once again bathe in the glory of your light. Amen.
ALL
Amen.
PRIEST MAXI
[raises left arm and fist] Let's go-
ALL
Let’s go
PRIEST MAXI
Broncos
ALL
Broncos
PRIEST MAXI
Let’s go Broncos
ALL
Broncos, let's go! [The priest extends the fist and all rise and exit. Three men carry the coffin out]
STAN
Wow, that was short. [Priest Maxi stops them as they leave the pew]
PRIEST MAXI
Boys, I haven't seen you in church lately.
KYLE
Well, I'm Jewish.
PRIEST MAXI
You're not too Jewish to worship Jesus, are you?
KYLE
I guess not.
PRIEST MAXI
Good. Boys, how would you like to perform the Stations of the Cross this Friday night?
STAN
The what?
PRIEST MAXI
It's like a skit, where you reenact the death and glorious resurrection of Jesus Christ.
KYLE
Hey, resurrection! That's what my dad needs!
PRIEST MAXI
Huh?
KYLE
We'll do it! We'll do it!
PRIEST MAXI
Wonderful. Here's a book on how to perform it. Don't let me down, boys. [hands it to Kyle and walks away. The cover shows two excited kids under a radiant cross]
KYLE
Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?
STAN
I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible.
[Outside, some of the churchgoers are still around.]
TOM
Good night, Jerry.
JERRY
See ya, Tom. Bye, Helen.
HELEN
Bye, Jer- aaa! [poof. Now she combusted]
JERRY
Oh my God, another one.
TOM
Helen, no!
JERRY
What happened?
MAN 5
[consoling Tom] God must be very angry with us. But why? [looks to the heavens] How have we angered you, Lord?
[Stan's house. Randy's in the basement doing preliminary work. He's working on some chemical reactions when the boys come down.]
RANDY
[to himself] Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no.
STAN
Dad, where's our Bible?
RANDY
Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else.
STAN
Or else what?
RANDY
Exactly.
STAN
...What?
RANDY
Right.
STAN
[after a long pause] Where's our Bible?
RANDY
It's in the attic with the old LP's. [the boys start up the stairs...] Boys, did you notice anything uuuh strange about Kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion? Ooh, what did he spend his time doing?
KYLE
He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.
RANDY
New girlfriend?
STAN
Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?
RANDY
Maybe nothing... [close up] maybe everything.
STAN
...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection. [the boys go up the stairs and exit]
RANDY
[resumes the reactions] Yes, yes, of course. I've got work to do. [the door closes] What?!
[Stan's room. Stan reads from the Stations of the Cross booklet while Kyle reads from the Bible.]
STAN
Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets.
KYLE
This is gonna be fun.
CARTMAN
I'm gonna be Jesus!
KYLE
You're too fat to be Jesus!
CARTMAN
Oh, and like you're gonna do it, Jew?!
KYLE
Stan should be Jesus.
CARTMAN
Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home! [gestures his intent.]
KYLE
You're such a fat baby!
CARTMAN
Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves. [gestures again, and again]
KYLE
All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!
CARTMAN
[retorts] Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't.
[Back in the basement…]
RANDY
All right, all right, let's try it again. Kenny was standing here. Stan, Kyle and Cartman were walking around him. [four men dressed as the boys stand before him] Now, walk. [the men move around] Do you feel hot?
KENNY
Uh, no.
RANDY
Damn it! How come you're not combusting? [throws down his clipboard]
STAN
Come on, Randy. You said we were gonna drink beer and watch the fight.
TOWNSMAN
[rushing in with several other people] Another one! Another one combusted! [pours out the ashes for Randy to see]
RANDY
No! Has she been doing anything odd?
TOWNSMAN
No, she was just on her way to her new boyfriend's house.
RANDY
Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend.
CARTMAN
This is stupid. Screw you guys, I'm going home. [walks off]
RANDY
No! I think I might have it.
[The First Church of South Park, night of Good Friday.]
PRIEST MAXI
Well, well, well. A lot of you came to church. Looks like we're a little "nervous" about this spontaneous combustion thing, huh?
A FEW PEOPLE
Yeah.
PRIEST MAXI
Well, on this blessed Friday let us give thanks for stuff, and things. [all bow their heads] Lord, is it so much to ask that you not let us suddenly burst into flame for no apparent reason? I mean, come on! Amen. [Stan and Kyle approach the pulpit, followed by Cartman] And now, some of our darling local children are going to perform the Stations of the Cross. [leaves, and Stan takes over]
CROWD
Awww.
STAN
Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.
KYLE
Die! [hits Cartman, dressed as Jesus, with a stick]
CARTMAN
Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God.
CROWD
Awww.
SOMEONE
Phew.
STAN
Station Two: Jesus takes his cross.
CARTMAN
[now carrying the cross] This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak.
STAN
And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him. [this is not part of the Stations]
CARTMAN
Peter!
KYLE
I don't know you, dude.
CARTMAN
Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess.
[Night, the Mayor's office. She's wearing a mud mask in bed and reading Gazongas. The phone rings.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Mayor.
RANDY
[calling from his lab] Mayor, I have it. I found out why people spontaneously combust.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Why?
RANDY
Uh, it's too complicated to explain over the phone. [his clipboard indicates].
Girlfriend --> DEAD
Boyfriend --> DEAD
Call a town meeting tomorrow
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Okay. If you're right about this, Marsh, you're going to be the most popular man in South Park.
[The Most Popular Man In South Park. Hands move him over the crowd.]
CROWD
Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!
MAN
We love you, Randy.
WOMAN
[rushing up] Make love to me, Randy. Please!
[Returns.]
RANDY
Wow. [hangs up the phone]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[hangs up the phone] Shmuck!
[At the church, Stan continues the Stations. Cartman is stripped to his underwear.]
STAN
Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross. [Kyle has tied Cartman to it]
CARTMAN
Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.
STAN
[produces a crown of thorns] Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, "Thanks."
CARTMAN
Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven. [Stan replaces Cartman's cap with the crown] So I guess it's cool. [Stan returns to the pulpit]
STAN
And then Jesus was lead away [Kyle leads Cartman out] to Mount Sinai, where he dies, and has a resurrection three days later.
CARTMAN
[on his way out the door] Hi, mom. [Stan leaves the pulpit and the priest returns]
PRIEST MAXI
Thank you, boys. Blessed be the name of Jesus!
CROWD
It's a great name, isn't it? [Stan exits]
[Stan and Kyle now carry Cartman on the cross and are headed towards a hill. Kyle has the heavier end.]
KYLE
Hey, that went really well. They really liked it.
CARTMAN
Yeah. I told you I'd be a sweet Jesus, you guys.
KYLE
Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!
CARTMAN
Up your ass with broken glass!
STAN
This spot looks good. [they drop the foot of the cross into the spot and lift the rest of the cross upright, then leave]
KYLE
Yeah. That looks pretty good.
STAN
Okay, cool. See you, Cartman.
CARTMAN
Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?! [they stop and turn]
STAN
Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess.
KYLE
Yeah, me too.
CARTMAN
Well, get me down from here!
KYLE
Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days.
CARTMAN
What?!
STAN
Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection.
KYLE
Then I can give it to my dad. [both turn and leave]
CARTMAN
Hey, uh I don't wanna be Jesus anymore! Don't leave me here, you guys! ...All right, that does it! Screw you guys, I'm going home! [looks around] Okay, I'm getting pissed now! [struggles to get loose, but doesn't get anywhere] God!
[City Hall, the next day. Stan and Kyle are present for the Mayor's announcement, along with much of the town.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
All right, people. Scientist Marsh and I have been working very hard on the problem of spontaneous combustion, and we have finally come up with a solution. Mr. Marsh?
RANDY
[approaches with a large book] The little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend. It wasn't the girl that caused him to combust, it was the fact that Kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her. [displays a diagram of the digestive system] You see, as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas. [the next page is a diagram of the stomach, showing how food produces methane]
RANDY
The methane gathers here in the bowel area [shows the intestines, or the bowels], where it causes pressure. Normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart. [shows the colon, where the gas collects and moves out] Should the gas not be expelled, [shows the gas trapped in the bowels] the methane can build up and then ignite, [shows the bowels exploding] leading to... disaster. [shows picture of Jocelyn Wildenstein, then closes the book] Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long.
TOWNSMAN
You mean, all we have to do is fart and we won't explode?
RANDY
Exactly. [after a while, a fart is heard, then more farts follow as the townsfolk release their gases]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
So, from this day forward, everyone in South Park will be required to fart on a regular basis to insure that nobody else spontaneously explodes.
CROWD
Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! [Randy waves back gratefully]
MAN
We love you, Randy.
OLD WOMAN
[in a wheelchair] Make love to me, Randy. Please!
STAN
Whoa, dude, my dad's famous.
KYLE
Come on. Let's go see how Cartman is doing with his uh, urection.
[The boys go to the hill on which they left Cartman on the cross.]
STAN
Wow, he died.
KYLE
Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad.
CARTMAN
[wakes up] Hey, there you guys are!
STAN
Cartman??
CARTMAN
You guys are in big trouble! Now get me down from here!
KYLE
How come you're not dead yet, Cartman?!
CARTMAN
You guys, I mean, seriously! Get me down!
STAN
Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus.
CARTMAN
...Really?
KYLE
Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap! [he and Stan leave]
CARTMAN
[watches them leave] ...When I get all my superpowers, I'm gonna use them to smote you two assholes right off the planet! [to himself] Dude, superpowers are sweet.
[The boys are back in town, and they run across Mr. Mackey.]
MR. MACKEY
Hi, boys.
STAN, KYLE
[imitating him] Hi, Mr. Mackey.
MR. MACKEY
Have you guys been sure to pass gas regularly so you don't spontaneously combust?
KYLE
We know how to fart, Mr. Mackey!
MR. MACKEY
Well, let me show you, just to be sure, m'kay? [moves his bowels as he hums,] Hmm, come on. Be good, now. [slaps his butt and lets loose]
KYLE
Jesus Christ! [the boys cover their noses with their jackets]
STAN
Sick, dude!
MR. MACKEY
I had a steak wrapped with bacon last night. [laughs]
KYLE
Dude, I think you pooed a lot.
MR. MACKEY
So, you boys understand you have to do that regularly, oh-mkay? [laughs]
STAN
Okay, okay, just go away! [Mr. Mackey leaves laughing, and the boys walk on]
KYLE
God, that was not cool at all, dude!
LIANE
Oh, hello boys. Have you seen Eric around anywhere?
STAN
Uh. We've been taking care of him.
KYLE
Yeah. We're having him resurrurected.
LIANE
Oh, all right. I was just at the store buying some apples.
STAN
Apples?
LIANE
Yes. Apples. [farts] Ahapples, get it? [the boys cover their noses again]
STAN
Dude!
KYLE
Sick!
LIANE
Stinky apples. See you, boys. [leaves]
STAN
I don't think I like this new law.
LIANE
[returns] Squeaker! [farts, then leaves]
[The boys return to City Hall to see the rest of the ceremony. The people in the crowd all have their noses covered. A covered statue stands next to Randy.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
And so I declare today Randy Marsh Day, where we shall remember forever how he freed us all from the threat of spontaneous combustion. Gentlemen? [her aides unveil a nicely muscled concrete statue of Randy]
BEARDED MAN
You're the best, Randy!
RANDY
I am? I am, huh? I never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now.
KYLE
It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this.
STAN
Yeah.
[Back on the cross...]
CARTMAN
[vultures hover above him] You guys, seriously! somebody get me down from here!
OFFICER BARBRADY
[strolling] Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur-
CARTMAN
Officer Barbrady! [Barbrady looks up to see Cartman on the cross and says nothing for a while]
OFFICER BARBRADY
[taps his chin] T. T is for turtle. [turns and walks away] Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur…
CARTMAN
Ey! Help me, you son of a bitch! [to himself] Huh, I'm gonna die up here.
[The Nobel Prize Awards. Looks like the Oscars...]
ANNOUNCER
We now return to the 42nd Annual Nobel Prize Awards. Here again your host, Whoopi Goldberg. [the audience applauds]
WHOOPI
[In elaborate dress and geisha hairdo] Republicans are so stupid. [the crowd laughs] I hate Republicans. [the audience laughs] Republicans are so stupid. [the audience laughs] And now, here to present the Nobel Prize for Science is Nick Nolte [fanfare. The audience applauds and Nick steps up]
NICK NOLTE
Science is good. Science is very important. This year's nominees are: [the candidates are shown as their names are mentioned]
Herald R. Pinkerton, for his further development of the grand unified theory of physics.
Randy Marsh, for his formulated break-wind theory of spontaneous combustion.
And Alphonse Mephesto for his seven-assed Galapagos turtle.

And the Nobel Prize goes to: [opens the envelope] Randy Marsh, for the theory of spontaneous fart things. [the audience applauds wildly]
MEPHESTO
[in the audience] No! No, this can't be!
RANDY
[at the podium, very excited] Whoa hoho, whoa! [grabs his head] Oh wow, oh, ah, I'm the best! Yeah! Yeah! Ah, it's just so amazing to be told that you're the best. I, I thought I was just a normal person like all of you, but... Yeah! Well, thank you for showing me otherwise! Yeah! I kick ass, yeah!
MEPHESTO
Fixed! Fixed! That was supposed to be my award, Kevin. I'll get him for this. Mark my words.
[Back in South Park, Stan and Kyle are on Kyle's couch watching the show.]
STAN
Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to my dad!
KYLE
Hey! My dad's pretty cool, too.
[In the master bedroom Gerald and Sheila look at Gerald's penis, to see if it'll rise.]
GERALD
I'm sorry, honey.
SHEILA
It's okay, [picks up the phone] I'll just call some 20-year old and have him come over.
GERALD
What?!
SHEILA
[hands up] I'm just kidding.
GERALD
Kidding? Well, that's not funny! That hurt my feelings!
SHEILA
Why?
GERALD
Why?! [the door opens]
SHEILA
Kyle. [Gerald see him, too]
KYLE
Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak.
GERALD
Huh?
KYLE
Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up! [his parents just look at him. He grins and walks away]
SHEILA
We have a very strange little boy, Gerald.
[Next day, Cartman on the cross. Stan and Kyle arrive to check up on Cartman.]
STAN
Dude, he's still not dead.
CARTMAN
You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down.
KYLE
She's not worried about you.
CARTMAN
Yes she is! I've been hearing her all day! Listen! Listen. [prepares for a bit of ventriloquism] Eric? Eric, where are you? I miss you very much.
STAN
That's not your mom calling!
CARTMAN
[still in falsetto] Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now.
KYLE
How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass!
CARTMAN
You guys, it's too hot out here! I can't do this!
STAN
He is right. It has been getting really hot lately.
KYLE
Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade.
STAN
Hey, yeah! [they turn and walk away]
CARTMAN
Oh! God-damnit! Urh! You guys! You guys wanna hear my "I hate Stan and Kyle" song?! Ahem.
CARTMAN
I hate Stan and Kyle
I seriously hate Stan and Kyle...
[City Hall. The Mayor and her aides are in shorts and T's.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
My God, it's burning up in here! Can't we crank the AC up some more?
AIDE 2
It's already on full.
RANDY
[entering, wearing his Nobel medal] You wanted to see me, Mayor?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Yes, Marsh. We have a new problem, and I think only you can solve it.
RANDY
I suspect you're talking about the dramatic heat wave.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Yes. The temperature is steadily rising every day. I want you to find out why.
RANDY
Mayor, I think I'm a little overqualified for this. My scientific mind is best used on global problems.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
All right, all right. Name your price.
RANDY
Ten thousand. I have to protect my talent.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Done. Just find out what's happening.
RANDY
Don't worry, Mayor. I'll find the cause. Or else. Or else what? Exactly. [they just look at him]
[Another night on the cross. The Last Temptation of Cartman.]
CARTMAN
[whispering, hoping...] Hey you guys. Seriously. [Chef walks into view]
CHEF
[startled] What the-? [sees Cartman on the cross with his head down] Oh, what now?!
CARTMAN
Chef! Chef!
CHEF
[rushes up to him] Children, what the hell are you doin'?
CARTMAN
Just get me down from here! [Chef does] Oh, finally! My arms are killing me!
CHEF
You children shouldn't be crucifying yourselves in this heat.
[Chef drives him into town.]
CARTMAN
Sweet. Now, I'm gonna go kill those guys!
CHEF
Eric, I have to tell you something, and it's really gonna bum you out.
CARTMAN
What?
CHEF
It's really gonna piss you off.
CARTMAN
What?!
CHEF
This is just a dream. You're still up on that cross.
CARTMAN
[waking up] Oh, damnit!
[Stan's house, basement. A Cheesy Poofs commercial ends as Stan comes down the steps.]
STAN
Dad, where's the phone book?
RANDY
Not now, Stanley. Without my scientific genius, the town is doomed. [Stan goes back up the stairs and exits. Randy mumbles] Let's see now, when exactly did the temperature start to go up?
[Jesus and Pals comes on.]
JESUS
Our topic tonight is the rising temperatures in South Park. Let's go to the phones. [beep] Caller, you're on the air.
STAN
Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect?
RANDY
Stan?
JESUS
That's not the topic tonight. The topic is global warming.
STAN
Oh.
JESUS
Do you have an opinion on global warming?
STAN
Uh, it... sucks ass.
JESUS
Okay! Thank you caller. Well, let's go to our first guest, Dr. Alphonse Mephesto. [Mephesto appears and sits] Thank you for coming. You claim to know the cause of global warming in South Park.
MEPHESTO
I most certainly do! The cause of global warming is [brings out a picture of a man, with horns, mustache, and angry eyebrows drawn on] Randy Marsh! [Randy is stunned] It was Marsh's theory on spontaneous combustion that told everyone to fart all they want. Now all the methane from all those farts has ripped a hole in our ozone layer. We are all doomed to die!
RANDY
Awww crap.
[City Hall, the next day. The town is gathered clamoring for Randy to come out.]
TOWNSMAN
Go get him!
TOWNSMAN 1
We want answers!
TOWNSMAN 2
You've killed us all!
TOWNSMAN 3
Someone's got to pay!
WOMAN
It's out of control.
[inside the Mayor's office.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Boy, they're really pissed.
RANDY
Well, they're right. We should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Well, let's go talk to them. Stick by me. [turns and walks to the door. Randy follows. She shows him out and quickly closes the door]
RANDY
[turns to the door] Hey!
TOWNSMAN 4
You killed us all!
TOWNSMAN 5
Shove that Nobel prize up your ass! [Stan and Kyle approach]
STAN
Oh my God, what's going on?
TOWNSMAN 6
Now we either hold in our farts and spontaneously combust, o-o-or we let our farts out and kill our entire planet. Well I, for one, am not farting anymore! [he combusts and others gasp]
RANDY
Uuuh, I- I'll try to find a solution.
TOWNSMAN 7
We don't want your solutions, phony!
TOWNSMAN 8
Give me that! [rips the Nobel medallion from Randy's neck, leaving the strap] Yeah!
TOWNSMAN 9
Damn you Marsh! Get out of town!
TOWNSMAN 10
You fraud! [two of the townsmen throw the statue onto Randy, who drags it away on his back. The crowd begins to stone him]
RANDY
[struggling] Mr. Garrison, help me!
MR. GARRISON
[keeping Randy at arm's length] I, I do not know you, sir.
TOWNSMAN 11
Up your-
TOWNSMAN 12
Arrn!
KYLE
[throws a stone] Yeah, take that!
STAN
Dude, that's my dad!
KYLE
...Oh, yeah. Sorry.
[News 4 Special Report.]
TOM
The spontaneous combustion problem escalates as more and more people go back to holding in all their farts. [a man combusts in front of his wife and child as he deposits a letter in a mailbox. A milk delivery man combusts after setting down a four-pack of milk. A boy combusts as he rides a bicycle] Meanwhile, the ozone layer continues to deplete as others refuse to hold in their farts for fear of combustion. As we all know, the cause for all of this is Randy Marsh, the son of a bitch who calls himself a scientist. We caught up with Mr. Marsh earlier today and he had this to say:
RANDY
I-I don't know what to say.
TOM
What an asshole! I hate that guy, and so do you. And now, on to the weather. It's fucking hot, thanks to Randy Marsh, son of a bitch!
[Everyone has gone to the Marsh house. Stan and Kyle look out from the living room window as the crowd clamors outside with torches. A man knocks down the trashcan next to the garage.]
KYLE
Dude, those people are pissed!
STAN
I know, huh?
KYLE
Where's your dad?
STAN
He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do.
KYLE
Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help my dad.
[Cartman is still on the cross.]
[Gerald's law firm. The sign reads "Brovlofski & Jackson," so he's got a partner. Gerald sits at his desk looking over papers.]
RADIO TALK SHOW HOST
Still more up next from the heat wave caused by Randy Marsh. A giant glacier is melting above South Park and the entire town is doomed. And now, these messages.
BOB DOLE
Having a hard time with male potency? [Gerald sits up and listens] Well, I don't, and I'm Bob Dole. What's wrong with you? Christ, I'm Bob Dole and I can get it up. [upset, he turns off the radio. The door opens and three prostitutes enter]
BLONDE
Are you a lawyer?
GERALD
Yes.
BLONDE
We want to sue Randy Marsh.
GERALD
Why?
BLONDE
He gave us skin cancer.
BRUNETTE
Yeah. He put the hole in the ozone, and now we have skin cancer all over our hot bodies. Look. [she takes off her clothes and stands before Gerald dressed in thong panties. The other does the same, and he is in shock]
[The Marsh house. Stan and Kyle go to the basement. Randy cowers in a corner wrapped in a blanket.]
STAN
What are you doing, dad?
RANDY
Stanley, I think its best you live with Kyle from now on. His dad is better than me.
STAN
No, he's not. He can't even get an erection.
RANDY
Hm. Really?
STAN
Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution!
RANDY
Not me. I'm not a scientist, I'm a hack. Even if I found a solution, those people would still all hate me.
STAN
Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross.
RANDY
What?
STAN
See, at first, Jesus was all like, "Why me?" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying, [performs a Vulcan greeting] he raised his hand and said, "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."
RANDY
You're right, Stanley. You're absolutely right. [gets up and the boys go to the stairs] Hey, that Bible sounds like kind of a good book.
STAN
It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime. [Randy returns to his work]
KYLE
Dude, that was Star Trek again.
STAN
Huh?
KYLE
"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?" That was Wrath of Khan.
STAN
Uh, well, Bible, Wrath of Khan, what's the difference?
RANDY
All right. Now, let's get to work.
YOU AND ME, GIRL
[Intro. Randy mixes some chemicals, then writes some formulas on the chalkboard]
[Randy explains the hold in the ozone layer] I've been telling everybody that you're my girl
[Randy set off a reaction that boils over] Cause I'm not one to be shy
[Randy looks into a microscope] You don't have to go with me if you don't want to, just
[the boys approve] Tell everybody I'm your guy
[Monster chases Randy and the boys all over the house] You and me, girl, it's forever
Sha la la la la laaa
I've been telling everybody that you're my girl,
Cause I'm not one to be shy
[Randy and the boys as a band] I've been telling everybody that you're my girl,
Cause I'm not one to be shy
[Randy and the boys in hearts on moiré] You don't have to go with me if you don't want to, just
Tell everybody I'm your guy
[Randy and the boys floating up through clouds] You and me, girl, it's forever
Sha la la la la laaa
[Randy and the boys play, and a monster appears]
You and me, girl, forever and ever
You and me, girl, forever and ever
You and me, girl, forever and ever... [fade. Randy's humming]
STAN
Dad. Dad! [Randy slowly comes out of his daydream]
RANDY
Wow!
STAN
Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!
RANDY
[looks at Stan] ...Right, right right.
[The Broflovski house. Kyle watches TV and Ike plays on the floor. The front door opens.]
GERALD
Kyle, where's your mother?
KYLE
She's upstairs.
GERALD
Well, I have something to give to her! [runs by with a big erection in his pants] Don't worry, Kyle. Everything's gonna be okay between me and your mom.
KYLE
Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore. [Ike hops onto the armchair next to Kyle]
[Another night on the cross.]
CARTMAN
Hello-o.
[The Marsh house. The crowd is still clamoring outside.]
TOWNSMAN 13
Look! There he is!
TOWNSMAN 14
Get him!
RANDY
Uh. Please, everyone- [the crowd closes in and stones him]
TOWNSMAN 15
You're a dead man, Marsh!
RANDY
[shielding himself from the stones] Please, just listen to me. I think I found the answer.
TOWNSMAN 16
[to Townsman 15] Could I borrow one of your rocks?
RANDY
It's all about moderation. If you never fart, you combust, but if you always fart, you deplete the ozone. So we must fart only at appropriate times or when it's really, really funny.
TOWNSMAN 17
Huh? [the people hold their fire]
RANDY
I know you all hate me, but please, for your own sake, fart in moderation. You can keep stoning me now, if you want. [most of the people drop their rocks, and Stan smiles through the window. A man throws one last rock] Ow.
[City Hall, three weeks later.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
And so we salute Randy Marsh and his unified theory of moderation that has saved us all. [the Nobel medallion has been repaired and is back around Randy's neck.]
STAN
[to Kyle] See? My dad is the coolest after all.
KYLE
Well, my dad is, too.
STAN
Cartman!
KYLE
I forgot all about him. [they leave]
[The boys are not at the foot of the cross.]
STAN
He's been up there for like, three weeks.
KYLE
Wow!
STAN
That's amazing!
CARTMAN
[in a slight falsetto] Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now.
KYLE
Dude! You're still alive, Cartman?
CARTMAN
Get me down from here!
STAN
Dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body?
CARTMAN
[who is now incredibly thin] Yes. And when I get down from here, I'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts!
["You and Me, Girl" plays.]
End of Spontaneous Combustion


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:When Chef gets engaged, the boys become concerned of his different personality and his evil fiancee. Cartman suffers from vision problems.

script:The Succubus

[The optometrist's office. A penguin sits above the OPTOMETRIST sign. Liane and Cartman are waiting in the lobby. Liane reads a magazine. A poster off to one side reads "Real eyes the beauty within."]
CARTMAN
Mom, please can we just leave?
LIANE
You have to see the eye doctor, Eric.
CARTMAN
But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.
LIANE
You're not fat, you're big-boned.
CARTMAN
That's what I told him, but he doesn't listen to reason.
DOCTOR'S ASSISTANT
[at the door, flatly] Eric Cartman. [a poster behind her looks like her]
CARTMAN
[enters the examination room] Weak. [the assistant follows him in to close the door.]
[Inside, Cartman stops]
OPTOMETRIST
Hello, Eric.
CARTMAN
[resigned] Hi, Doctor Lout.
DOCTOR LOUT
How's my little piggy today?
CARTMAN
[points his finger at him] Ey! Don't call me a little piggy!
DOCTOR LOUT
I just say that because you're my little buddy.
CARTMAN
I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!
DOCTOR LOUT
Hop up on the chair. [Cartman hope up] Don't break it now!
CARTMAN
[turns around and sits] God damn it!
DOCTOR LOUT
Just kidding. Let's see how your eyes are doing. [lowering a refractor to Cartman's eyes] All you have to do is read the letters. Can you see the letters?
CARTMAN
Yes.
DOCTOR LOUT
All right, read them out for me.
CARTMAN
I am a little piggy. Ey! [the optometrist laughs. Cartman stands up on the chair and pushes the refractor away.] That does it! Mom!
DOCTOR LOUT
No no. That, that was just a weird coincidence. [voice fades as he removes the card from the refractor] I do not know how that happened. [reads the card] "I am a little piggy." Wow! What are the odds of that? [throws it away] All right, let's get down to business, shall we? [places the refractor back on Cartman's face.]
CARTMAN
Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!
DOCTOR LOUT
[begins to calibrate] Hmm, let's see, which is better: one, or two? One, or two?
CARTMAN
They look exactly the same.
DOCTOR LOUT
Just pick one. Or two.
CARTMAN
I don't know, two!
DOCTOR LOUT
[flips between two women] Okay. One, or two? One, or two?
CARTMAN
Uh, one.
DOCTOR LOUT
[flips between an apple and a tall slice of chocolate cake] One, or two? One, or two?
CARTMAN
[chooses the cake] Two.
DOCTOR LOUT
No! The answer is one, piggy! One! [hits Cartman through the refractor]
CARTMAN
Ow! I hate you!
DOCTOR LOUT
[removes the refractor] Yes, there is obviously a problem with your eyes. I am gonna have to dilate them and run some tests.
[Lunchtime at the school cafeteria. Stan, Kyle and Kenny stand in line to get their lunches]
KYLE
I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?
STAN
Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch.
KENNY
{Maybe he took a dump and got sick.} [the others laugh]
KYLE
Yeah. [sees Cartman] Oh, here he comes.
CARTMAN
[with very dilated pupils] Hey dudes.
STAN
[squints hard for a better look] Whoa, what happened to your eyes, Cartman? [Kyle blinks hard]
CARTMAN
My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.
KYLE
Why?
CARTMAN
Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it!
STAN
Why do you have to see an eye doctor?
CARTMAN
Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.
KYLE
Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do.
CARTMAN
Hey, yeah! [The four enter the kitchen, but Cartman runs into the entrance and falls on his way in.] Ow!
[The kitchen. The boys approach the lunch counter]
THE BOYS
Hey Chef!
MR. DERP
[wearing a hair net and cook's cap] Hello there, children.
CARTMAN
[rubs his eyes] Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy.
MR. DERP
It's time for lunch-e-roo
STAN
Where's Chef?
MR. DERP
Chef quit.
THE BOYS
What?!
MR. DERP
Chef is gone. So let my introduce myself. I'm your new cook, Mr. Derp. [ta-daaa!]
KYLE
Mr. Derp?
MR. DERP
When I'm in the kitchen, you never know what nutty things are gonna happen. If you like Chef, you're gonna love Mr. Derp. [ta-daaa! Mr. Derp hits himself with a hammer and toddles] Ooo! Derp! [falls to the floor, then gets up] Derp! O-hoh wasn't that silly kids? [laughs, but the boys aren't impressed]
STAN
Why did Chef quit?
MR. DERP
Aren't I a great character? My antics go right to the funny bone. [takes out a tiny cannon and shoots himself with it. His face is full of gunpowder] Oh, I don't feel so good. [laughs] Derp!
STAN
[after a moment of silence] Could you just hand us some food please?
MR. DERP
Sure gang! I have yellow stuff or white stuff, huh. Derp!
CARTMAN
Can I have the yellow with a side of white?
[the boys reenter the cafeteria with their lunches]
KYLE
Dude! I hate Mr. Derp!
STAN
Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back.
CARTMAN
I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny. [chuckles]
KYLE
[looks back] Shut up, Cartman!
[Chef's house. The boys reach the front door]
CARTMAN
[runs into the door] Ow!
CHEF
[wrapped in a lavender towel, opens the door] Oh! Hello there, children!
STAN
Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today.
CHEF
Oh! Didn't they tell you? I quit.
KYLE
Yeah, but we didn't believe them.
CHEF
Well, it's true.
STAN
But why? Why would you quit?
CHEF
Children, three nights ago I was at the library checking out some books on Kama Sutra when I met the most amazing woman ever. She knew so much about so many things. She really got me thinking. We eventually came back to my place and really hit it off.
STAN
So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.
CHEF
No no, we just sat there all night long and... taaalked.
STAN
Talked?!
CHEF
Yeah. She told me all about the powers of goddess, and how men have been oppressing women for years and viewing them as sexual objects, and I realized that I had done that myself.
WOMAN
[walks up and looks out] Oh! What darling little children.
CHEF
Here she is now. Children, meet my new girlfriend, Veronica.
STAN
[ignoring that statement] That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!
CHEF
Children, Veronica is moving in with me.
KYLE
Moving in?!
CHEF
I'm in love.
BOYS
Love?!
VERONICA
Oh, you knight. [cuddles Chef]
STAN
What the hell is going on?!
CHEF
Veronica spent the whole day sharing her favorite poems with me.
VERONICA
[teasing] Sorry boys, looks like I'm stealing Chef away from you.
KYLE
But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better.
CHEF
Well, I can still do that, children. In fact, Veronica can help me. She's a great singer, too.
VERONICA
What's the problem?
CARTMAN
My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean.
VERONICA
Oh, I know just the song for you.
[reaches behind the door and pulls out a guitar. She starts to play it]
There's got to be a morning after
if we can hold on to the night
[the boys are shocked, and Kenny pulls his hood tight]
CHEF
[blandly] We have a chance to find the sunshine.
CHEF, VERONICA
Let's keep on looking for the light.
KYLE
This... is insane. [
"Oh, can't you see the-"
]
[On the sidewalk. The boys walk away from Chef's house]
KYLE
That bitch!
STAN
She's stealing Chef from us.
KYLE
He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.
CARTMAN
Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is.
STAN
Wait you guys. [pensive] Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new? [the others think about it...]
KYLE
Yeah, so?
STAN
...Yeah, screw that bitch.
CARTMAN
Bitch, I hate that bitch!
KYLE
Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around.
STAN
Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.
KYLE
Good idea.
[The optometrist's office. Doctor Lout sits in the examination room holding a clipboard]
DOCTOR LOUT
All right, we got the test results back, piggy-
CARTMAN
[sits on the chair, his pupils normal again] Stop calling me piggy!
DOCTOR LOUT
You've got a small astigmatism that's causing all the problems.
CARTMAN
So, what does that mean?
DOCTOR LOUT
It means, piggy, that your eyesight is never going to get better.
CARTMAN
[seething] All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair [throws a fit] and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!
DOCTOR LOUT
Well, don't worry. I've got something that's going to make your eyes as good as new. [puts a pair of blocky glasses on Cartman]
CARTMAN
[after seeing how they look and fit] Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me.
DOCTOR LOUT
I know, the hardest thing to do is get kids to wear their glasses.
CARTMAN
I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!
DOCTOR LOUT
That's why we have the little stapler. [takes it out and starts stapling the glasses to Cartman's head]
CARTMAN
Ow! Son of a bitch!
[The streets of South Park. The boys, without Cartman, are in the business district looking...]
KYLE
They said that Chef works in one of these buildings [the boys run into Cartman in front of Steinburg & Burgstein Accounting.]
CARTMAN
Hey dudes. [the others study him, then laugh. Cartman's hurt, but jabs] Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha!
KYLE
Dude! Just take them off!
CARTMAN
I can't! They're stapled to my head! [they study him again, then laugh harder.] I hate you guys.
[Inside. The boys enter and see the receptionist]
RECEPTIONIST
Hello and welcome to Steinburg & Burgstein. Can I help you?
STAN
We wanna talk to Chef.
RECEPTIONIST
Chef?
KYLE
He's a big guy, with a beard.
STAN
And a chef hat.
KENNY
{And a real huge dick.}
RECEPTIONIST
Oh! The black guy!
STAN
Huh?
RECEPTIONIST
Third cubicle on the left [directs them to the work area, where Chef's hat can be seen, but stops Cartman] Hey! Aren't you that cute little kid from Jerry Maguire?
CARTMAN
[dismissively] Uh, yeah, sure sure.
RECEPTIONIST
Wow! You really got fat.
CARTMAN
Ey!
[The boys reach Chef's cubicle]
CHEF
Hello there, children.
KIDS
Hey, Chef.
CHEF
Eric, you got glasses!
STAN
Chef, you have to dump the bitch!
CHEF
Huh?
KYLE
We need you, Chef.
MAN
[pops up from another cubicle] Hey, Chef-o, we're gonna run down to the office supply store and get some leather holders for our pagers, you wanna come?
CHEF
You bet! [the guy grins]
KYLE
Chef, this place isn't you!
CHEF
Children, Veronica showed me that I've been living a very empty life. Meaningless sex is fun for twenty or thirty years, but after that, it starts to get old.
STAN
But we don't like her.
CHEF
Why not??
STAN
I don't know-uh. No reason I guess.
CHEF
Children, friends get girlfriends all the time. It's something even you will have to face with each other some day.
KYLE
No way, dude!
CARTMAN
Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses.
CHEF
That's easy! Get some laser corrective surgery. That's what I did.
CARTMAN
Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef!
CHEF
You see? Everything's gonna be fine. Now how about I meet you boys after work and we can play ball?
KIDS
Okay!
[The bus stop. The boys wait for Chef. Cartman carries a bat in his right hand and a baseball in his left]
KYLE
Chef should be here any minute.
[The day passes into night, and Kenny falls asleep. Rats gather and nibble on him. The others stand watch waiting for Chef, but there's no sign of him. The night turns to day, and still no Chef. Kenny wakes up...]
STAN
[pissed] Dude! He bailed on us!
KYLE
[pissed] I can't believe it!
STAN
Come on! We're going to his house! [they leave the bus stop]
[Chef's house, inside. There's a knock on the door and Chef answers. The boys stand outside, angry.]
CHEF
Oh! Uh, hello there, children.
KYLE
All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!
CHEF
Oh, children, I'm sorry. I forgot.
STAN
[sarcastic] You forgot!
CHEF
Veronica surprised me at the office and took me out to dinner. [dreamy] She's so amazing.
KYLE
Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!
VERONICA
[appears behind Chef] Hello, children!
CARTMAN
Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind?
CHEF
Children, I've got some great news for you. Veronica and I are getting married. [a dramatic riff signals the boys' alarm]
STAN
Oh no! No nononononono!
CHEF
My whole family's coming here for the wedding, and I want you boys to come, too.
VERONICA
This is so wonderful! Let's sing! [gets the guitar]
There's got to be a morning after.
CHEF
[blandly] If we can hold on through the night.

[the boys are truly shocked] We have a chance to find the sunshine.
[South Park Elementary, Mr. Garrison's class]
MR. GARRISON
And that, children, is what you need to know about The Facts Of Life. So, let's review. [writes a diagram on the board] Tootie left in the fourth season, but Blair and Jo stayed on and got husbands, leaving the fifth and sixth seasons hideously stagnant. [the bell rings] Okay children, that's lunch. See you in thirty minutes. [the class leaves, but the boys walk up to Garrison]
KYLE
Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you?
MR. GARRISON
Sure.
STAN
Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time.
MR. GARRISON
[asserting himself] Well children, I am your teacher. I think you'll find that my advice is just as valuable as Chef's, if not more so.
KYLE
All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?
MR. GARRISON
Oh, the old succubus syndrome.
STAN
What's a succubus?
MR. GARRISON
A succubus is a woman sent from Hell to suck the life out of a man.
KYLE
That's it!
STAN
Yeah!
MR. GARRISON
Yeah, there's not much you can do about a succubus. Their evil power makes man blind to love.
KYLE
This is totally what's happening!
STAN
Wow, you are smart, Mr. Garrison!
MR. GARRISON
Yeah, I tell you boys, women can kill. Poontang's expensive. That's why when it comes to chicks, I just screw them and leave them. I'd say "get out of my bedroom, poontang, before you suck my life dry!"
KYLE
Thanks, Mr. Garrison.
MR. GARRISON
Sure, kids. [the boys leave the classroom]
MR. HAT
You're not fooling anyone!
MR. GARRISON
Shut your hole, Mr. Hat!
[South Park business district. The boys head back to Steinburg & Burgstein]
KYLE
Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus.
STAN
Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him. [a small station wagon pulls up, driven by Cartman's mom]
LIANE
There you are, Eric! Come on, we have to go to the eye doctor.
CARTMAN
Oh, no!
LIANE
Come on. Do you want your laser corrective surgery or not?
CARTMAN
Yes, but can't we wait until tomorrow.
LIANE
Now, hon.
CARTMAN
But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus!
[Chef's house. People are milling around outside as Stan, Kyle, and Kenny arrive. Stan rings the doorbell, and an elderly gray-haired man answers]
CHEF'S DAD
Hello there, children.
STAN
Who are you?
CHEF'S DAD
I'm Chef's father. We just flew in for the wedding.
KYLE
Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him.
CHEF'S DAD
Well, come on in. [they enter]
[Once inside, Chef's dad closes the door]
KYLE
There he is! [rushes in]
[The fitting room. Chef's dad shows them in, then leaves. A tailor takes Chef's measurements for the pants as Veronica walks by. Chef is wearing the finished coat and shirt.]
STAN
Chef, we have to talk to you!
CHEF
Who? Not now, children! I gotta get fitted for my britches! Be right back. [hurries away. Stan's head drops, then the boys walk away.]
[The living room. The boys reach the sofa and hop up to sit on it. Chef's parents sit across from them on the love seat. An uneasy silence follows]
CHEF'S DAD
Well, aren't you crackers just cute as the dickens?
STAN
You're Chef's parents?
CHEF'S MOM
Yes, all his life.
KYLE
We have to talk to him!
CHEF'S DAD
Well, he should be out now directly.
CHEF'S MOM
Oh, he's so excited about the wedding now.
CHEF'S DAD
Say, would you crackers like to hear about the time we saw the Loch Ness monster?
STAN
No, that's okay.
CHEF'S DAD
Ooh, it must've been about seven, eight years ago. Me and the little lady was out on this boat, you see, all alone at night, when all of a sudden this huge creature, this giant crustacean from the paleolithic era, comes out of the water.
CHEF'S MOM
We was so scared, Lord have mercy, I jumped up in the boat and I said "Thomas, what on earth is that creature?!"
THOMAS
It stood above us looking down with these big red eyes,-
CHEF'S MOM
Oh, it was so scary!
THOMAS
and I yelled. I said, "What do you want from us, monster?!" And the monster bent down and said, "...Uh I need about tree-fitty." [a long silence follows]
KYLE
What's tree-fitty?
THOMAS
Three dollars and fifty cents.
CHEF'S MOM
Tree-fitty.
STAN
He wanted money?
THOMAS
That's right. I said "I ain't giving you no tree-fitty you goddamn Loch Ness monster! Get your own goddamn money!"
CHEF'S MOM
I gave him a dollar.
THOMAS
She gave him a dollar.
CHEF'S MOM
I thought he'd go away if I gave him a dollar.
THOMAS
Well of course he's not gonna go away, Nellie! You give him a dollar, he's gonna assume you got more!
[The optometrist's office. Cartman is on the examination chair flanked by a nurse on each side. He is wearing a breathing mask. Doctor Lout moves around him]
DOCTOR LOUT
Okay, let's get started. You're here for the liposuction, right? [the nurses giggle]
CARTMAN
Hey! You son of a bitch!
DOCTOR LOUT
All right. Time to laser me a little piggy. [the nurses giggle]
CARTMAN
Ey! You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick you square in the nuh- [Doctor Lout turns up the sleeping gas] I'm gonyanya, uhnyuh, uhnyuuh, nyaahh [the gas knocks him out]
DOCTOR LOUT
I bet his mom wishes she could do that.
[Chef's house. Thomas is still telling the story...]
THOMAS
And that was the third time we saw the Loch Ness monster. Then one time, I believe it was July-
NELLIE
August.
THOMAS
August. There's a knock on the door. I open it, and there's this cute little girl scout-
NELLIE
And she was so adorable, with the little pig tails and all.
THOMAS
And she says to me, "How would you like to buy some cookies?" And I said "Well, what kind do you have?" She had thin mints, graham crunchy things-
NELLIE
Raisin oatmeal.
THOMAS
Raisin oatmeal, and I said "We'll take a graham crunch. How much will that be?" And she looks at me and she says, "...Uh I need about tree-fitty."
NELLIE
...Tree-fitty.
THOMAS
Well, it was about that time that I notice that girl scout was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era.
NELLIE
The Loch Ness monster.
THOMAS
I said, "Dammit monster! Get off my lawn! I ain't giving you no tree-fitty!" It said, "how about just two-fitty?" I said, "Oh, now it's only two-fitty!! What?! Is there a sale on Loch Ness munchies or something?!"
NELLIE
Lord, he was angry.
THOMAS
Damn right, I was angry!
NELLIE
Not you, the monster. He was about to kick your ass.
THOMAS
Aah, shut your mouth, woman!
STAN
Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here?
THOMAS
Sure. That crazy old monster [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny walk out] Now, then the fourth time I saw the...
[Cartman's room. Cartman is in bed recovering from the laser corrective surgery on his eyes. Patches cover his eyes and are taped to his face. There's a knock on his door, and the boys enter]
STAN
[disappointed] Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
CARTMAN
That asshole eye doctor screwed up my laser surgery; I have to wear these bandages for three days!
STAN
Damn, your eyes must really suck, Cartman.
CARTMAN
Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you tell him she's a succubus?
STAN
Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us.
LIANE
[entering] Eric, you have a little visitor. Is that all right? [the others face her]
CARTMAN
Okay. [Liane leaves, and Veronica soon enters]
VERONICA
Hello, boys. I heard Eric had laser surgery, so I made him a pie.
CARTMAN
Aaah! It's the succubus! [looks in her direction as the others jump, and Kenny pulls his hood tight]
VERONICA
Huh?
STAN
We know what you are, lady!
KYLE
Yeah! You're a blood-thirsty succubus!
VERONICA
A what?
STAN
A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men!
VERONICA
[sweetly] Boys, you know how silly that sounds, don't you?
KYLE
Well, you are taking Chef from us. [Kenny has loosened his hood]
VERONICA
[sets the pie down on the floor] Boys, come here. I want to explain this to you. I know Chef is your friend, but Chef is a grown man. He has needs you boys can't fulfill. He wants a life with me because I make him happy. Do you understand?
STAN
I guess.
VERONICA
Good. Oh and boys. Just one more thing. I'm going to marry Chef tomorrow, [her face becomes that of a demon's, with blood-red eyes and sharp teeth, and her voice grows sinister] And there's not a God-damned thing you can do about it! [laughs evilly. Stan and Kyle jump and scream, and Kenny pulls his hood tight again. Her face resets itself] Toodle-oo! [leaves]
STAN
Jesus dude! [the boys are trembling, and Kenny keeps that hood tight]
CARTMAN
What? What happened?
[King Jimmy's Buffet. A banner spans the front of the restaurant, saying, "Closed for Wedding Rehearsal Dinner Party." Chef, his family, Veronica, and other guests are present. Soft jazz plays in the background.]
THOMAS
Could I have your attention please? [the guests quiet down and the music stops] Tomorrow, my son is gonna get married to a beautiful lady. [sniffles] I'm very happy for them both. [sobs] Ooh there I go! I told myself I wasn't gonna cry, now.
CHEF
It's okay, pop.
NELLIE
Thomas, you're gonna get me going now. [sobs]
THOMAS
Oh, I remember when Chef was just a three-year-old little man. He came running up to me with a big smile and his little chef's hat on, and he said, "Poppa, poppa!" I said "What do you need, Chef, my boy?", and he said, "...I need about tree-fitty."
NELLIE
...Tree-fitty.
THOMAS
Well, it was about that time I got suspicious. I said, "Chef, why do you need tree-fitty?" He said, "My imaginary friend Goo-Goo the dinosaur wants it." I went to my son's room, and sure enough, there was the Loch Ness monster!
NELLIE
Oh, it was scary!
THOMAS
I said, "Dammit monster! You stop bugging my children now! We work for our money in this house and we don't give money away!"
[the door opens, and the boys enter]
STAN
Excuse me! [the boys stop at the register] We're sorry to interrupt, but we've got bad news. [the boys approach the head table]
KYLE
[pointing to Veronica] This is not a woman! It is a succubus!
CHEF
What?!
STAN
Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him
VERONICA
[hurt] Children! That hurts my feelings.
KYLE
[unmoved] Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody!
CHEF
All right guys! That's enough! I have had it with you! This is the happiest time of my life, and you can't be happy for me!
STAN
Chef, but-
CHEF
No buts, Stan! [Veronica starts crying, and he cradles her] I love this woman, and I am marrying her! Now you can either accept that, or get out of my life! Now if you'll excuse us, we're having a party. [the boys exit]
THOMAS
So I chased the monster down the street, you see...
[Outside, the boys walk away from the restaurant]
KYLE
I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us.
STAN
No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us!
[Cartman's room, morning. Cartman is in bed with patches over his eyes. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are reading books on demonology]
STAN
Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them.
CARTMAN
You guys, it's six in the morning, I have to get some sleep.
STAN
Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus.
CARTMAN
You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep. [rolls over]
KYLE
Here! Here! Look at this. It says "The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power."
STAN
What the hell does that mean?
KYLE
I don't know.
KENNY
[closes his book and expounds] (Hey, you guys! You guys, I think I know precisely what it's saying. It says that we've gotta go and find a pile of records and get the one that has the entire lyrics, and then we gotta get into learning to rearrange them.)
STAN
Right.
KENNY
(And then we gotta go down and get a piece of paper and write down each one of the words we sang on the tape deck. And then, sing it back again!)
STAN
Yeah?
KENNY
(That's what that means!)
STAN
Oh-hoho!
KYLE
Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings?
There's got to be a morning after.
CARTMAN
[picks up] If we can hold on to the night.

We've got to find our way together...
STAN
That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards.
KYLE
[doubting] In three hours.
[First Church of South Park. A banner above the lower cross reads "Congratulations Chef and Veronica." People are streaming in for the wedding]
KYLE
Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open. [Cartman is nodding off, too]
STAN
We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song. [turns to Cartman] You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman?? [taps him]
KYLE
He's asleep. Wake up fatass!
CARTMAN
[rattled] What what what?
STAN
God-damnit! You can't fall asleep.
CARTMAN
I wasn't sleeping, I was just thinking really hard!
THOMAS
[telling his tale to Randy and Sharon] ...And then these aliens had me up on their ship, right? They was probing me and all that.
NELLIE
We had taco salad that night.
THOMAS
Don't matter what we had for dinner woman! Now this alien had a big head and big black eyes, and it was all bent over me. I said, "What do you want from me, alien?!" and do you know what he said?
NELLIE
Tree-fitty.
THOMAS
Uh. Let me tell the damn story now! He said, "tree-fitty." And so I realized I that it wasn't no alien, it was that God-damned Loch Ness monster again, trying to trick me into giving him tree-fitty by dressing up like an alien. Don't that just beat all?!
NELLIE
I had just given him tree-fitty the week before.
THOMAS
What?! You gave that monster another damn tree-fitty?!
NELLIE
[somewhat defensive] He tricked me.
THOMAS
Well no wonder the damn monster keeps coming back to our house! You keep giving it tree-fitty!
[The ceremony begins. An usher goes up to a turntable and sets the needle down on a record. Veronica enters in a traditional wedding gown]
STAN
There she is! ["Here Comes the Bride" plays. Chef and Priest Maxi await her.]
STAN
[as Veronica walks by] Bitch. Bitch.
KYLE
[joins in] Bitch.
STAN
Bitch.
KYLE
Dirty bitch.
STAN
[to Cartman] All right. Kyle and I are gonna take our positions up front.
CARTMAN
Okay. [Stan and Kyle leave]
PRIEST MAXI
Do you, Chef, take this woman as your lawful-wedded wife, to have and to-
CHEF
Iii do!
NELLIE
Aaah, my baby's getting married!
PRIEST MAXI
And do you, Veronica, take Chef to be your daddy?
VERONICA
I do!
PRIEST MAXI
And now a special sharing of vows through song.
STAN
[as "A Morning After" begins] Here it goes.
VERONICA
There's got to be a morning after. [the needle is removed and there's no more music]
STAN
Now, Cartman! [Kyle holds the needle in his left hand. The crowd gasps and Veronica is pissed]
KYLE
Now, Cartman!! [No response. Cartman is asleep again.]
CHEF
[looks over] Children! You are screwing up my wedding! [Priest Maxi and Veronica turn to face them]
VERONICA
I'll take care of them! [begins to move towards them]
KYLE
Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!! [Kenny punches Cartman]
CARTMAN
Ow! [Veronica reaches Stan and Kyle, but the backwards version of "A Morning After" soon plays]
STAN, KYLE
[singing on the tape]

STAN, KYLE

CARTMAN
Oh no! The tape jammed! [Veronica transforms again, this time tearing through the gown, revealing her huge wings and succubus body. The congregation reacts with groans and screams]
MAN
Oh my God!
WOMEN
Oh my God!
CHEF
What the-?! [everyone else falls silent]
THOMAS
She's a goddam Succubus!
NELLIE
Succubus trying to take my baby! [the succubus roars and flies into the air. As she hovers over the congregants, they scream and dive under the pews]
[Outside, The doors open and people pour out]
[Inside, Stan and Kyle try to get Cartman's attention again]
STAN
Come on Cartman!
CARTMAN
[pressing every button on the tape player] I can't see anything!
KENNY
[tries to help] (Wait...) [the succubus lands on Kenny, breaking the pew in half. Kenny is dead under her feet]
STAN
Oh my God! She killed Kenny!
KYLE
You bastard!
NELLIE
[with a stick, runs at the succubus] You damn monster! Get away from my baby!
THOMAS
[reaching into his pocket] Hold on, now, I'll see if I have tree-fitty!
NELLIE
[gets a few blows in, but the succubus knocks her away] Oh my-
CARTMAN

STAN, KYLE
-the to on hold can we if after [the succubus grips her head with both hands, roaring in pain]

Warm and safe that's... [the ground opens up, flames appear, and the succubus drops down into the hole. The flames leave with her. Chef walks up to the hold and looks over it]
MR. GARRISON
[sits up in his pew] Hoh, wow! You don't see that every day!
STAN
[walks up with Kyle to Chef] We're sorry Chef, we had to do it!
CHEF
[sadly] No I'm, I'm glad you did, children. Now that she's gone, I can't really figure out what I ever saw in her.
MR. GARRISON
[to man on his right] Poontang's poontang.
CHEF
Come on, children. Let's go get some ice cream.
STAN, KYLE
Hooray! [the three walk out. As they do, people start rising from under the pews]
CARTMAN
What? What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay?
[The cafeteria kitchen. Chef is back at the counter as the boys enter.]
CHEF
Hello there, children!
STAN, KYLE
Hey, Chef!
CHEF
How would you like some fish sticks and tater tots?
STAN
[cheerfully] We'd love them!
KYLE
It's great to have you back Chef!
CHEF
Yeah, well, I learned a very important lesson this week:
[begins to sing]
Sometimes you fall in love and you think it feels that way forever.
You change your life and didn't know your friends cause you think it can't get any better.
But then love goes away; no matter what, it doesn't stay as strong.
And then you're left with nothing, cause your thinking with your dong. So watch out for that love bug! It can destroy like a typhoon wind!
Just play it cool and don't be a fool...
MR. GARRISON
[from the entrance] And never let poontang come between you and your friend.
CHEF
Daaamn right, Garrison! [song fades out]
[The optometrist's office. Cartman walks in with a large ice box. His bandages are off. Now we know why he wasn't at school with Stan and Kyle.]
DOCTOR LOUT
Oh, hello, piggy. How are your eyes doing?
CARTMAN
After today they're gonna be fine, and I'll never have to see you ever again!
DOCTOR LOUT
I don't think that's possible, piggy, not with your eyes.
CARTMAN
No, not with my eyes. With these! [takes Kenny's frozen head out of the box to show the eyes] Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
DOCTOR LOUT
Was he an organ donor?
CARTMAN
Eh-sure.
DOCTOR LOUT
All right, then let's get to work. [Cartman gets in the chair, and the optometrist pulls out Kenny's left eye] Say, you don't have three dollars and fifty cents on you, do you?
STAN, KYLE
[Over end credits"A Morning After" plays backwards]

End of The Succubus


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The boys try to instigate a fight between Tweek and Craig. Meanwhile, Mr. Adler the shop teacher is haunted by a recurring dream of his lost love.

script:Tweek vs. Craig

[South Park Elementary. The school bell rings. Most of the third-grade boys are in a shop room.]
MR. ADLER
This is shop class. My name is Mr. Adler. For the next week, rather than your normal schoolwork, you'll be learning how to make things. Now, does anybody know WHY you're in shop class? [Stan raises his hand] Yes?
STAN
Because we had to choose between this and home ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies?
MR. ADLER
Wrong! You are here because you are America's future! [stirring music plays] You may someday be doctors, or lawyers, or scientists. Most of you, however, will be pumping gas, or cutting sheet metal, and that's why we have... [points to the words] shop class.
CARTMAN
Ooooohh.
MR. ADLER
Now, let me make one thing crystal clear: I don't like kids that screw around! You screw around in shop class, you can lose a hand or an eye. I have a- [picks up a picture of a woman and begins to get lost looking at it] I have... uh, I have a...
KYLE
Mr. Adler?
MR. ADLER
[sets the picture down] Huh? Oh, uh, I was just saying that I want to know who is the biggest troublemaker in your class?
STAN
[quickly points] Tweek is!
TWEEK
Arrh! No, I'm not!
KYLE
Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble.
TWEEK
Arrrrh!
CARTMAN
Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class.
MR. ADLER
That true, Craig? You a troublemaker?
CRAIG
No.
MR. ADLER
Well, you'd better not be, because in shop class we- [Craig flips him off] Hey! Did you just flip me off?!
CRAIG
No.
MR. ADLER
Yes, you did!
CARTMAN
Told ya!
KYLE
[hushed, to Stan] Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec.
STAN
Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls.
[The Home Economics room. All the girls are here.]
VOICE
[female] Welcome to home ec. [the camera scans across the class] For the next week, you will be learning how to bake, sew, clean, and make things that are lacy and pretty. [Kenny appears]
KENNY
(Woohooo!) [Wendy raises her hand]
WENDY
I requested to be in shop class, but they sent me here.
WOMAN
That's right, Wendy. You see, some of you girls will go on to have interesting jobs and careers. [now cautioning] But all of you pretty ones... won't have to worry about that, because you can marry a nice man. And that's why we have... home ec.
KENNY
(Woohooo!) [the girls on either side of him look at him]
[The Shop room. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman sit before a power miter box. Cartman is feeding it wood.]
CARTMAN
I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class? [cuts out two slabs]
STAN
I don't know. He's such a wuss.
MR. ADLER
[passing by] Hey! Don't screw around! You screw around too much!
CARTMAN
You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is. [Craig leafs through some wood scraps, and Tweek approaches a belt sander on the floor]
STAN
No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.
CARTMAN
Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass.
KYLE
Do you wanna bet?
CARTMAN
Yeah, I'll bet.
STAN
How much?
CARTMAN
Five bucks.
STAN
You're on!
TWEEK
[revs up a belt sander.] Arrh! [jumps. Stan and Kyle walk to him]
STAN
Hey Tweek.
TWEEK
[jumps] Gaarhrhrh!
STAN
Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.
TWEEK
[drops the sander] He does?
STAN
Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight?
TWEEK
Why?
KYLE
Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him? [Craig is still leafing through the scraps]
TWEEK
[jumps] Rrrrh! He doesn't look like he wants to fight me.
CARTMAN
Craig, could I talk to you real quick? [Craig flips him off, and Cartman puts his palms up to calm him] Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater.
CRAIG
He did?
CARTMAN
Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it.
CRAIG
Why would he say that?
CARTMAN
I don't know, Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you.
CRAIG
[now pissed] Well, I've gotta go over there and-
CARTMAN
[blocks his way] No, no! Craig, you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today.
CRAIG
Okay. [flips Tweek off]
KYLE
There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.
TWEEK
[twitches to one side] Rrrr! What a jerk!
STAN
He's really got it out for you, dude.
TWEEK
Why?! What did I do?!
KYLE
So, do you agree to fight him after school?
TWEEK
I guess so.
STAN
Super. See you there. [they walk away, pleased]
[Mr. Adler takes out the picture of his fiancée again and looks at it. He begins to daydream. Memories of his fiancée come to him, and her voice echoes every time reminisces.]
FIANCÉE
[runs from him] Catch me, Richard. [she laughs even after he catches her and she's on the grass] I'm so in love with you, Richard. [next scene: she's in the kitchen holding a tray] I made you some cookies, Richard. [sniffs them real good. Next, she's by the fireplace with a little stocking] Merry Christmas, Richard. [laughing on the yard outside] Oh, Richard. Say you'll hold me forever. [in flight, trying to regain control] Aaaaaaa! [in a swimming pool, under water] Richard!
[The school bell rings, and Mr. Adler snaps out of the daydream.]
MR. ADLER
Aaaarr! Uh. [opens a drawer to get some nicotine gum, and chews some] Oh why? Why? [closes his eyes and continues chewing]
STAN
Mr. Adler! Mr. Ad-ler!
MR. ADLER
[opens his eyes] Huh? Stop screwing around!
STAN
The bell rang. Can we go?
MR. ADLER
Well, uh, well, sure. Uh, class dismissed.
STAN
Come on, you guys. [Kyle and Cartman follow him out.]
[The school yard.]
STAN
This is gonna be so sweet, dude.
CARTMAN
You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.
KYLE
We'll see!
CARTMAN
Why don't we just raise our bet to ten dollars?!
STAN
You're on, fatass! [Kenny shows up]
CARTMAN
Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!
KENNY
(Hey guys, what's going on with you?)
STAN
How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?
KYLE
Yeah. That's not cool, dude. [the girls walk by]
BEBE
Bye, Kenny. See you tomorrow.
ANNIE
Bye, Kenny.
KENNY
(Bye, ladies.) [the other boys arrive as the girls leave]
CLYDE
Hey, what's going on?
KYLE
Tweek and Craig are gonna fight.
CLYDE
Really? Cool. [the boys stand around waiting] It's funny, 'cause Tweek and Craig both went home about fifteen minutes ago.
KYLE
What?
TOLKIEN
Yeah, they left.
STAN
Aw, hell!
CARTMAN
Those sons of bitches!
CLYDE
I guess they don't wanna fight.
KYLE
Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet! [walks off with Stan, Cartman, and Kenny]
[Stan and Kyle arrive at Tweek's house. Stan rings the bell.]
STAN
Tweek?
KYLE
[looks up to the second floor] Tweek?
TWEEK
[opens the center window] Arrh! What do you guys want?
STAN
How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?!
TWEEK
Craig and I have no reason to fight each other.
KYLE
Well, Craig showed up.
TWEEK
He did?
STAN
Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, "Man, Tweek's a wuss," and we were all like, "No he's not, Craig," and he was all like, "Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!"
TWEEK
I don't have crooked teeth!
KYLE
And then Craig was all like, "Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken." And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken; [Stan watches as Kyle demonstrates] well, everybody in the world saw it!
TWEEK
Everyone in the world?! Rrrr! [falls down behind the window]
STAN
Yeah, it was weak.
TWEEK
I'm not a chicken!
KYLE
Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya. [turns to walk away]
TWEEK
[pops up] Wait! I'll fight!
STAN
Tomorrow?
TWEEK
Okay.
[Cartman and Kenny arrive at Craig's house. Cartman knocks and Craig answers.]
CARTMAN
Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek!
CRAIG
Red Racer's on.
CARTMAN
Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!
CRAIG
I do watch Red Racer every day of the week!
CARTMAN
[aloof] Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom.
CRAIG
Nope. [shuts the door]
CARTMAN
[hushed] Egh. God damn it! [knocks again, and Craig answers] Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig.
CRAIG
What?! What did he say about Stripe?!
CARTMAN
Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed.
CRAIG
That son of a bitch, I'll kill him!
CARTMAN
Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?
CRAIG
After Red Racer.
CARTMAN
[being gracious] After Red Racer, of course.
[The Tweek house, that night, dinner. The Tweaks are at table.]
RICHARD TWEAK
How was school today, son?
TWEEK
Errh!
RICHARD TWEAK
That's great.
TWEEK
Dahad, if some kid in school wants to fight me, what should I do??
RICHARD TWEAK
Son, let me tell you a little story about when your mother and I first met. [gets up and stands next to her. Peaceful music plays] You see, a long time ago, there were a lot of guys who were after your mother. She used to be very attractive.
MRS. TWEAK
It's true. I was. [Tweek bobs as he listens]
RICHARD TWEAK
Well, when I started courting your mother, there was this big muscular football player named Quib, who didn't take too kindly to me. He wanted your mother all to himself. And so, one day, he challenged me to a fight. [sits down, and both parent resume eating. Tweek waits for the rest of the story.]
TWEEK
[after a long lull] Well?
MRS. TWEAK
Well what, honey?
TWEEK
Nrr. What happened?
RICHARD
Oh'd. I, I don't know. He moved away or something.
MRS. TWEAK
Yes, I think that's right.
TWEEK
Rrrrr! You guys never help me! [the parents look at each other, and Tweek starts banging his head against the table] Your stories never go anywhere! I hate it! I want out! I want out! [the parents resume eating]
[Craig's house, dinner time. Craig has a little sister.]
CRAIG
Dad, I'm supposed to get in a fight tomorrow.
THOMAS TUCKER
With who?
CRAIG
Some kid.
THOMAS
Oh.
LAURA TUCKER
Don't just "Oh" him, Thomas!
CRAIG
Yeah, don't just "Oh" me!
THOMAS
I'll "Oh" whoever I want! [Mrs. Tucker flips Thomas off, he flips back, the daughter flips them both off, and Craig flips his dad off with the right hand, his sister off with the left, and his mom with the right, up close.]
[Mr. Adler's home. He and a woman have just returned from a date.]
MR. ADLER
Well, that was fun, Pearl. See you later.
PEARL
Richard, aren't you going to invite me in?
MR. ADLER
Why?
PEARL
Well, I thought maybe you would at least at-tempt to make love to me tonight.
MR. ADLER
Oh, well, uuh, I can't. I left the oven on.
PEARL
Oh, Richard, why can't you open your heart to me? Why?
MR. ADLER
I just... I can't. Oh, I know. I have genital warts. [he begins closing the door]
PEARL
We'll use plastic wrap.
MR. ADLER
Nope. Sorry. Maybe some other time. [shuts the door on her face. He holds the door in place, then makes his way to a picture of his deceased love, picks it up, and remembers...]
FIANCÉE
[on a swing] Swing me Richard, swing me higher. I wanna touch the sky, Richard. [now in a gazebo] Richard, I'm here! [waves him over] Smile. [now opens a little box and sees a ring] Oh, Richard, it's beautiful. Yes. Yes. [Now at a phone by a desk] But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you. [next day, next to a plane] Don't worry, Richard. I'll pilot! It's what I do! [in flight, trying to regain control] Aaaaaaa! [in a swimming pool, under water] Richard! [now rising from an open coffin] Richard.
MR. ADLER
[returns] Haaarrr! [opens a small drawer in the side table, gets some nicotine gum, and starts chewing, then mumbles] Aw, God, what am I gonna do? [resumes chewing]
[South Park Elementary, the cafeteria, next day, recess. From left to right on a table are seated Stan, Tweek, Kyle, Cartman, Craig, and Kenny. Much of the class is assembled before them. A large sign saying "Tweek VS. Craig" hangs above them from the ceiling.]
STAN
Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45.
CLYDE
Uh, how long do you expect the fight to last?
CRAIG
I uh...
CARTMAN
[covers Craig's mouth] However long Craig wants it to last. [the kids laugh] T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge.
KYLE
He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!
CARTMAN
Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.
KYLE
Shut up, fatass!!
CARTMAN
Don't call me fat, you son of a bitch! [jumps on him, and they start fighting. Kenny and Stan soon join in, leaving Tweek and Craig looking at them]
CLYDE
Wow. Tweek and Craig really hate each other, huh? This should be a good fight.
[Home Economics, after recess.]
PEARL
[stands by a chart equating shoes with money] On your first date, look at the man's shoes. Sometimes you can tell how much money a man has just by his shoes. [Kenny and the girls take notes. Pearl then stands by the chalkboard listing the number of credit cards from 1 to 4] When he takes you out to dinner, try to sneak a peek at his wallet while he pays for you. If he only has one credit card, BEWARE. [crosses 1 out] It means he doesn't spend a lot, and worse yet, it could be a debit card. If he has more than four credit cards, that's a little fishy. [crosses 4 out] The perfect number of credit cards for a man to have is... two. [circles it. Bebe raises her hand]
BEBE
What if we meet a guy who wants to be a doctor or a lawyer, but is still getting his degree?
PEARL
Dump that zero and get yourself a hero! He could be earning that degree all his life while you starve to death with two dying babies sucking at your teats. [the girls and Kenny just look at her]
[Shop class. The boys are busy on various projects. Cartman stands on a stool operating a drill press as Stan and Kyle stand on the floor.]
CARTMAN
When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world.
KYLE
That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!
CARTMAN
Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000.
MR. ADLER
Hey, quit screwing around back there! You're horsing! [He now hears a voice calling to him, from the drawers in his desk...]
FIANCÉE
Ri-chard! [he whistles] Ri-chard! [he remembers mumbling something in return, and pulls out her picture. He dreams: she is back on the swing] Swing me Richard, swing me higher![now in a gazebo] Richard, I'm here! [waves him over. Cut to her opening a little box] Oh, Richard, it's beautiful. Yes. Yes. [Now at a phone by a desk] But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you. [next day, next to a plane] Don't worry, Richard. I'll pilot! [in the cockpit, she calls out] It's all for you! [an alarm sounds, and the gas tank explodes behind her] Aaaaaaa! [she tries to land the plane right, but it falls into a swimming pool. She's thrown clear, into the water] Richard!
CLYDE
Mr. Adler. Mr. Adler!
MR. ADLER
[returns] Huh? Uh, what?
CLYDE
Tommy stuck his face in the belt sander [Tommy comes and stands beside Clyde. There are no features on his face.]
MR. ADLER
The belt sander? Tommy?? I told you not to screw around with the belt sander, didn't I? [Clyde looks at Tommy for a reaction, but...] Well go on. Go see the nurse; she'll give you some peroxide. [Tommy walks away in the wrong direction]
CLYDE
[noticing the picture and points] What's that?
MR. ADLER
Huh? Oh, this is a woman I knew a long time ago.
CLYDE
What? She die or something?
MR. ADLER
What? Hey! Go on! [upset, he puts the picture away] You're screwing around in here! [Clyde hurries away]
[After school. The kids climb over a hill to reach the tetherball pole. Stan, Kyle, and Tweek lead the way]
CLYDE
Oh boy! Here we go!
WENDY
[joins the group] What's happening?
KYLE
Tweek's gonna fight Craig!
WENDY
Oh cool!
STAN
Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed. [the two groups meet] All right. Here we go.
KYLE
Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy.
CARTMAN
You're gonna be eating those words, asshole.
KYLE
No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby. [Craig and Tweek look at each other, but nothing happens]
STAN
Well?
CARTMAN
Come on!
WENDY
Yeah, if you're gonna do it, do it!
CRAIG
[turns to the crowd] What do we do?
STAN
Huh?
CARTMAN
What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other.
TWEEK
How?
KYLE
How??
CRAIG
I've never been in a fight before.
TWEEK
Me neither.
CROWD
[let down] Awwww.
STAN
[in disgust] Aw, dude, come on!!
CARTMAN
You just hit each other, smack each other around. [Tweek slaps Craig, and Craig slaps Tweek. No effect]
KYLE
[sighs] Not like that!
TWEEK
Like what, then?
STAN
[approaches the fighters] All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight.
CROWD
Awww. [disperses]
CLYDE
[to Wendy] All that build-up for nothing.
WENDY
Yeah. Christ, I could have been home by now!
STAN
All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig.
CARTMAN
I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek.
STAN
Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!
CARTMAN
[faking fear] Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys! [serious] I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!
STAN
Fine! We'll see you back here tomorrow!
CARTMAN
Fine! [the parties part ways]
KYLE
Fine!
CARTMAN
Fine, that's fine!
[Big's Gym, later. This is where Stan and Kyle took Jesus to learn to box. On this occasion, Stan and Kyle bring Tweek. Jimbo is the coach, Ned the sparring partner. All are in the ring]
JIMBO
Alrighty. Tweek, my little nephew Stanley has asked me to teach you the fine points of boxing.
TWEEK
Rrrrh!
JIMBO
You're in luck! Ned here used to be the state champion until a grenade blew his arm off.
NED
Mmrr I can still kick ass.
JIMBO
Now, Tweek, boxing is a Man sport. There is nothing in the world more Man than boxing. It is Man at his most Man. So when you spar with Ned here, just dig deep into that most Man part of you.
TWEEK
Hwaaah! [Stan and Kyle look at each other and shrug]
JIMBO
Well, enough of the lectures. let's get to boxing. [rings the bell, and Ned sends Tweek to the ropes with one punch]
TWEEK
Uugh!
NED
Mmm whatcha got, bee-ahtch? [Tweek gets up]
JIMBO
Keep your guard up, Tweek! [Tweek does so. Ned punches him twice more, and Tweek falls]
TWEEK
Ow!
STAN
Damn it!
KYLE
Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!
JIMBO
All right, looks like we'll have to apply the Oppenheimer technique with Tweek here. [Tweek gets up]
NED
[prancing] Gmmmmm, whatcha got, bee-ahtch?
JIMBO
Punch him in the balls, Tweek!! [Tweek lunges at Ned and lands the punch]
NED
AAAAaaaarrgh.
JIMBO
Atta boy! Now quick, get him again while he's down! [Tweek lands a barrage of punches, and Ned groans after each punch]
NED
Ow.
JIMBO
Good! Now kick his balls! [Tweek does so several times, and Ned groans] There, see? You've got him coughing up blood.
STAN, KYLE
Hooray!
TWEEK
Rrrr!
JIMBO
Now THAT'S BOXING!
[The Nishimura School of Martial Arts]
MASTER
Your friend hasa brought you to learn the ancient art ofa sumo. You must learna discipline anda respect. [Craig flips him off] In sumo, your body must be rike a stone, and your mind rike a meatroaf.
CRAIG
Meatloaf?
MASTER
The object is simpry to push opponent out of circle. Is opponent ready?
CARTMAN
I'm ready! [comes out, speaks softly] Hey, I like this hair thing. This is cool. [stops to pull some salt out of a kettle and pats his hands together]
MASTER
Let us begin. [Cartman plants his feet] Ready? And, th-ree.
CARTMAN
Respect my authoritah! [he and Craig engage in pushing each other]
MASTER
Body rike a stone! Mind rike a meatroaf!
CARTMAN
[turns around to back Craig out of the ring] Dude. Come on, now. Come on.
CRAIG
Oh, Jesus! I can't take it! Stop!
MASTER
Fight back! Resist the ass!
CRAIG
How can I resist an ass so great?
MASTER
It is only an ass. You must overcome the ass with your mind.
CRAIG
This ass is unlike any I've encountered, Master. [Cartman bumps him off the ring, he hits a wall, and he's out]
CARTMAN
I win!
MASTER
There is indeed great power in your ass, Eric. Perhaps you should consider sumo as your profession.
CARTMAN
Hey, maybe. [plants his feet again]
[Mr. Adler's house, night. He's asleep, and a bad dream begins]
MR. ADLER
[twisting and turning] No. No. Make it stop.
FIANCÉE
[laughing on the yard outside] Oh, Richard. Say you'll hold me forever. [Now at a phone by a desk] But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you. [next day, next to a plane] Don't worry, Richard. I'm a pilot! [in the cockpit during flight] Watch me, Richard! [waves to him as she writes "I love U Richard." As she gets to the last letters, she loses control and the alarm comes on. Her gas tank explodes and she screams. She manages to write A's on her way down to a crash in the pool. She sinks and calls out] Richard!
MR. ADLER
Baaaaa! [looks around and then sobs] I never got to say good-bye. I never got to say good-bye! [reaches for some nicotine gum, only to find the box empty] Oh no! Oh NO! NOW what do I do?! [begins bawling]
[South Park Elementary, next day. Home Ec.]
PEARL
Okay, that was very good, class. Now let's try this one together. [holds up a board saying] Honey, can I get a new wardrobe?
CLASS
[including Kenny] Honey, can I get a new wardrobe?
PEARL
All right, now let's try this one together. [holds up a board saying] Lisa Smith's husband just bought HER a new car....
CLASS
[including Kenny] Lisa Smith's husband just bought HER a new car....
PEARL
Good. Bebe, why don't you try this one. [holds up a board saying] I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life.
BEBE
I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life.
PEARL
Outstanding! Now, Kenny, how about you try? [holds up a board saying] I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed.
KENNY
(I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed!)
PEARL
[looks at him in dismay] O-kay. Kenny, could I talk to you over here real quick?
KENNY
(Sure you can.) [gets up and goes to her desk]
PEARL
Kenny, I don't know quite how to tell you this, but... I'm not sure home economics is right for you.
KENNY
(Why?)
PEARL
Well, your cooking is unsatisfactory, your sewing skills are below average, and, frankly, I don't think the odds of you marrying a nice rich man in the future are very, well, good.
KENNY
(You don't?)
PEARL
No. I think you should consider transferring to shop class.
KENNY
(Shop class?) [images of threatening tools tools fill his head: a drill, a torch, a belt sander, a table saw] (No, I won't!)
PEARL
Now, now. Very few students are severely injured in a shop class.
KENNY
(I don't wanna take shop class!) [draws his hood tight, and the bell rings]
BEBE
Come on! It's time for the fight!
WENDY
Yeah! [the girls begin to file out of class]
PEARL
Fight? Oh no no, girls! Haven't I taught you anything?
[The playground, after school. The kids head for the tetherball pole. The fighters are present: Tweek wearing a boxing robe with hood, Craig in sumo gear]
STAN
Okay, the time has finally come. [the other kids close in]
CLYDE
[holding a box of] Programs, get your programs here. Programs.
KYLE
Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low.
TWEEK
Hrrr.
KYLE
This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek.
TWEEK
Rrrr, mean, rrrr.
CARTMAN
The spirit of the dragon is in your hands. Hurshar kashurshar. Hurlong churshar. All right?
CRAIG
Okay.
CARTMAN
Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong!
CRAIG
Okay, okay!
[Tweek is ready first, then Craig gets ready]
TWEEK
Rrrr! [Craig adjusts his own head] Hr. [Craig flips him off]
STAN
You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on!
CRAIG
Respect my authority.
[Tweek lands some punches and Craig tries to throw Tweek off sumo-style. They go back and forth this way for a while]
STAN, KYLE
Come on, Tweek!
CARTMAN
Come on, Craig!
[The shop room. Mr. Adler is alone and starts to write]
MR. ADLER
To whom it may concern: I can no longer live without her. I couldn't say goodbye to her, and so now I must say goodbye to all of you, for I am all out of nicotine gum.Sincerely yours,
Richard Adler
Shop Class
P.S. Don't screw around. You all screw around too much.
[he leaves the desk and goes to the table saw, turns on the switch, lies on the table feet first, and is pulled towards the blade]
MR. ADLER
Good-bye, cruel world. [sits up] Jesus Christ! What was I thinking?! That would have hurt like hell! [lie back down, now head first]
[the playground. Craig and Tweek tumble towards the school, neither giving in. The other kids follow them to a clearing outside a bungalow, where Craig and Tweek resume trading punches]
STAN
Ye-hah!
CARTMAN
Come on, Craig! Time to kick his ass! [the fighters, now tired and panting, butt heads]
KYLE
Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him!
CARTMAN
Come on, Craig!
STAN
Come on, Tweek! You got him!
KYLE
Get him! [the fighters just pant, stuck to each other] Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?
TWEEK
What?
KYLE
Craig just called you a boner!
TWEEK
Rrrr! [punches Craig]
KYLE
[to Stan:] We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.
STAN
Yeah.
[Shop class. Mr. Adler draws closer to the saw blade and sighs. Kenny comes in and hands him Pearl's note.]
KENNY
(Hi, Mr. Adler.)
MR. ADLER
What? Who are you? [takes the note and reads] "Kenny McCormick has been transferred from home ec to shop class." Well, all right. Get some safety goggles and start gettin' acquainted with the jigsaw over there. [hands him back the note and Kenny goes to the jigsaw] Hrh.
[Outside the bungalow Craig and Tweek continue fighting. They lock up and tumble into the slide, tearing it down. They end up under the debris]
TWEEK
[gets up] Huh? [Craig pops up and tackles Tweek. The other kids, fearing the fight over, cheer again.]
[Shop Class. Kenny starts cutting wood on the jigsaw, but looks at Mr. Adler going to his death. Craig and Tweek crash through the shop class window and continue fighting]
MR. ADLER
[sits up] What the-? [the door opens and the other kids pour in]
STAN
Here they are.
MR. ADLER
[stands and walks towards the kids] Hey! What's going on?
STAN
Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching. [trading punches]
MR. ADLER
Well, why the hell don't you stop them?
CARTMAN
'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it.
MR. ADLER
Don't screw aROUND!
[Craig and Tweek tumble towards Kenny]
KENNY
(Hey!) [They knock the stool out under him. He hangs on to the jigsaw table] (Hey!)
MR. ADLER
Stop screwin' aROUND!!
[Tweek slams Craig into a second jigsaw and both tumble into a tool cart, which falls onto the second jigsaw, which tumbles onto the one Kenny is on.]
KENNY
(Hey, God damn it!)
MR. ADLER
Eh. Hey, you're SCREWIN' AROUND TOO MUCH!! [Kenny gets stuck in the blade and spins around. He's finally thrown clear and ends up in a box of old nails. Some nails fly out of the box.]
KENNY
(Ugh!)
STAN
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
KYLE
You bastards!
MR. ADLER
[goes to the box of nails and plucks Kenny out] Well, don't just stand there, call an ambulance! [the boys just shrug] You see? You see what happens when you screw around in shop class?
KENNY
(Richard.)
MR. ADLER
What? What's that, son?
FIANCÉE
[through Kenny] Richard.
MR. ADLER
AAaaagh! [settles down] No! No, please don't go. I need you. I can't live without you. [Stan and Kyle look at each other, Stan shrugs]
FIANCÉE
[visible now, where Kenny's face was] Richard, you have to move on. I want you to be happy.
MR. ADLER
But I can't. I never got a chance to say good-bye.
FIANCÉE
Then say it now, Richard.
MR. ADLER
Good-bye?
FIANCÉE
There. Now do you feel better?
MR. ADLER
No.
FIANCÉE
Of course you don't. Saying good-bye doesn't mean anything. It's the time that we spent together that really matters, not how we loved it.
MR. ADLER
You... you're right. You're right. [The fiancée leaves and an old woman takes her place. The background is blue.]
WOMAN
Richard, this is Grandma.
MR. ADLER
Gram'ma? Hi, Gram!
GRAM'MA
You never said good-bye to me either. [she leaves and a man enters]
MAN
Hey, Richard. Remember me?
MR. ADLER
Uncle Corey! Wow, you're all alive again!
UNCLE COREY
[gleefully] No! We're dead! [leaves]
FIANCÉE
[returns] I love you, Richard. See you soon.
MR. ADLER
Thank you. Thank you for freeing me. I feel like now I can move on. Baby, I feel so much better. I feel so alive. [holds Kenny close] Thank you, baby. Thank you.
STAN
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
[Hell's Pass Hospital. The kids enter. Stan approaches a nurse]
STAN
Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig.
NURSE
Oh. Well, I suppose a quick visit is okay. Maybe you kids can cheer them up. [leads the way. The kids follow and are let in. Craig and Tweek are in adjacent beds recovering from their injuries.]
STAN
Hey, you guys. How are you feeling?
TWEEK
Rrr!
CRAIG
Ugh.
STAN
Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you.
KYLE
Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other. [Craig flips them off]
CARTMAN
Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to apologize. We feel so bad.
KYLE
Boy, do we ever.
STAN
So I guess we'll be going now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies. [the group turns towards the door]
TWEEK, CRAIG
What?!
STAN
[the group turns back to the beds] Well, I mean, that's what was on the news.
CRAIG
What was on the news?
CARTMAN
Oh, you didn't see it? Oh. Tweek's family was on the news saying what a wuss you are, Craig.
CRAIG
Huh?
KYLE
Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters.
TWEEK
Uuh! You son of a bitch! [pounces on Craig, and the fighting starts again, leaving the room a mess]
CRAIG
I'm gonna kick your ass!
STAN
Come on, Tweek! You got him!
CARTMAN
Give him sucky, Craig, give him sucky! Hurlong churshar!
End of Tweek vs. Craig

synopsis:The boys discover a prehistoric creature called a Jakovasaur while camping at Stark's Pond. The town tries to save the species from extinction.

script:Jakovasaurs

[The boys are camping near Stark's Pond. They've set up a campfire and are roasting marshmallows. Cartman plays a harmonica.]
CARTMAN
You guys, listen to this song I just wrote. It's called, "I Hate You Guys":
[plays four notes before each line]
I hate you guys.
You guys are assholes.
Specially Kenny.
[the other three glare at him] I hate him the most.
CARTMAN
Okay now, let's try one all together:
I hate you guys.
Come on, you guys know the words.
Specially Kenny.
KYLE
This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen. ["Hey you guys, sing the song!"] Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,... [Cartman gets up and walks away]
STAN
Where are you going?
CARTMAN
I'm going home for a minute. I have to go to the bathroom.
KYLE
Just go behind a tree.
CARTMAN
I have to go number two.
STAN
So? You can poo in the wilderness.
CARTMAN
No way, dude! What would I wipe with?
KYLE
Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!
CARTMAN
Well what do I sit on?
KYLE
You just squat, stupid! [Cartman begins to lower his pants...]
STAN
Not here! Go further away!
CARTMAN
[moves away] God, I'm glad you guys know all these "pooping outside" rules! [he squats some distance away and begins] Urgh. Come on, now.
KYLE
Watch out for ground eels! [he, Stan and Kenny begin to laugh]
CARTMAN
Stop, you guys! I can't think!
KYLE
What do you have to think about?
CARTMAN
I have to think about... planes dropping bombs, and dump trucks, and self-serve ice cream... [a dump is heard] Oh, that did it.
STAN
Sick, dude!
[In the lake, the water becomes agitated, and a bubble comes up. Cartman pulls out his harmonica and plays again]
CARTMAN
Poopin' outside,
[a rear shot] Makin' self-serve ice cream
For my friends
Specially Kenny.
Hey, Kenny, Can I borrow one of your gloves? [a yellow creature peeks out between the trees. It is the one looking at Cartman's rear.]
KENNY
(Here you go.) [begins to walk to Cartman, but realizes what it's to be used for] (No way!) [goes back to roasting his marshmallow]
CARTMAN
[hears some rustling and zips up immediately] What the?
CREATURE
[running through the trees] Oohma poota!
CARTMAN
Oh my God! Come on, you guys, come look at this!
STAN
[thinking of poo] We don't wanna look at it, Cartman!
CARTMAN
[urging] You guys, get over here!
KYLE
No way, dude!
CARTMAN
I'm serious now! [the boys walk over to the spot] Look. Over by those bushes.
KYLE
What?
CREATURE
Meesa scared!
STAN
I see it!
CARTMAN
Come on! Let's kill it! [the boys move forward]
KYLE
[steps in the poo and looks at his shoe] Aw, Cartman! You're supposed to bury it!
[Jimbo's lodge. This is where Huntin' and Killin' is shot. Inside, Jimbo is watching TV and Ned, in a short kimono, looks for something.]
ANNOUNCER
Look at this sword. Only on House Shopping Network. It has a dragon on the blade. [close-up of the samurai sword] It's got a dragon painted right on the blade! You should buy the samurai sw-
JIMBO
Ned, how the hell could you lose your voice box?! [Ned tries to speak] I can't hear you, Ned. You don't have a trachea. You smoked too much and you had it removed. And then you drank too much and you lost your god-damned voice box, Ned!
NED
[eructing] Shut... up... Jimbo.
JIMBO
Aw, Ned, don't burp-talk. That just sicks me out.
STAN
[outside] I saw it this way!
KYLE
Over here!
CARTMAN
[trying to keep up] Come on, you guys!
[The boys reach the lodge.]
JIMBO
[opens the door] What the hell's goin' on?!
STAN
Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way!
JIMBO
Hold on, I'll get my shotgun! Ned! Ned, come on! [goes in, and reappears with his gun. Ned follows him out the door] Where did it go?
KYLE
It just ran by here a second ago. [rustling is heard]
JIMBO
[cocks the shotgun] Sounds like it ran into the ostrich trap! [all move slowly around a corner] Sshh. Now keep quiet. All right. I'm gonna turn my flashlight on. It may get startled, so be ready. [turns it on and flashes it into the trap]
CREATURE
Ooba jaaga!
JIMBO
Holy Crow! I've never seen anything like it!
CREATURE
Meesa gonna die? Wooo-wowoop!
CARTMAN
Heheh. Hey-heh, that thing's funny.
KYLE
[annoyed] It's stupid.
JIMBO
Well, let's kill it.
CARTMAN
[intervening] No! No. Don't.
JIMBO
Huh?
CARTMAN
I like it.
KYLE
You don't like anything, Cartman! [the creature is shaking from fright, and Cartman looks at it affectionately]
JIMBO
Well, all right. Ned, get the Mayor on the phone, tell her that we... hoh yeah, he can't talk. All right, never mind, I'll do it.
[South Park, the next day.]
JIMBO
Yeah, it was like wrestling a Louisiana alligator, this thing. Put up one hell of a fight. [the crowd murmurs and the creature just stares out of the cage. His view is that of a fish lens]
SHEILA
[walks up to it] Hello there. Who's the cute baby? Who's the fuzzy, huh? Yes, that's a cutie. [three men with briefcases walk up]
FED
Mayor, we're from the Department of Interior.
MAYOR
Ooh, yes. How are you?
DOI 1
[the one with black hair] Fine, just fine.
DOI 2
[the one with red hair] Fine, just fine.
DOI 3
[the one with brown hair] Fine.
MAYOR
Right over here. [she shows them the creature and they stare in awe]
DOI 2
My God, McClanahan, do you believe it? [DOI 3 is just stunned]
CREATURE
Meesa needa Jakov. [raises its arms] Dwooooooo!
DOI 1
Mm-it's amazing.
MAYOR
What?
DOI 1
Mayor, this is a jakovasaur. A live one has never been seen.
MAYOR
Oh, neato.
DOI 2
Incredible. [turns to look at the Mayor] We know of this creature only from remains frozen in snow.
DOI 1
Do you realize what this means? We could use its DNA and have a chance of bringing the entire jakovasaur species back from extinction.
CARTMAN
Wow! Cool!
NED
[eructing] Is... there... re... ward... money? [the DOI agents look at him]
JIMBO
Huh, cut it out, Ned! That's just disgusting!
DOI 2
This one jakovasaur can mother an entire population of the animals.
WOMAN
Well, in that case, I think we should name it... Hope.
WOMAN 2
Hope.
MAN
Yes, Hope.
HOPE
Meesa name Junjun.
STAN
I think his name is Junjun.
MAYOR
Hope. Why, that's a perfectly beautiful name!
DOI 1
Now we must find a safe place for it.
MR. GARRISON
I'll keep it at my house.
MAYOR
No, Garrison, you'll just try to have sex with it!
JUNJUN
Uuh?!
MR. GARRISON
What?! How dare you say that?!
MAYOR
Garrison, you remember what happened to the wounded pigeon you were supposed to take care of?!
MR. GARRISON
Oh, come on! You all know that pigeon was a total slut.
RANCHER
Oh, I got a barn it can stay in. It ain't much, but it's heated.
DOI 1
Well, that sounds fine, just fine.
DOI 3
Fine, just fine.
DOI 2
Fine.
MR. GARRISON
Now, wait a minute. I wanna clear the air here. We all know that pigeon was a whore. Raise your hand if you didn't sleep with that pigeon? [everyone around him raises his or her hand] Oh, whatever!
[That night, something mysterious is happening at Stark's Pond. The water is agitated again, and another jakovasaur rises out of the water. It sees a pup tent and rushes to it. It finds a backpack next to it and searches it. The following address shows up: E. Cartman, 21208 E. Bonaza Cir., South Park, CO. But Cartman is at home looking at the House Shopping Network on TV.]
ANNOUNCER
It's got a dragon painted on the blade. This is the Sumatomi sword-
CARTMAN
[wondering] Wow, a dragon right on the blade. Mom, can I get a Sumatomi sword used by the ancient Tokugawa soldiers??
LIANE
[from somewhere else] I'll think about it, hon.
CARTMAN
Sweet. [someone knocks on the front door] Mom, somebody's at the door.
LIANE
Mommy's busy, boopie-kins.
CARTMAN
Should I get it?
LIANE
[in bed, with torch and bong in hand] Go ahead, snookums. It's probably one of your little friends.
CARTMAN
Okay.
LIANE
[inhales, with a manly voice] Hmmm. [two men are in bed with her. One of them is her congressman, O'Reilly]
[The knocking continues.]
CARTMAN
Okay, okay, hold your horses! God! [opens the door and screams. An angry jakovasaur glares at him. Cartman backs into the living room] Mom, it's another Stark's Pond creature!
LIANE
That's nice, muffin.
JAKOVASAUR
Please help me. Whoa-oh-oh-oh. [falls on his face and gets up] Please help me find Junjun. She has been gone since last night, and I'm worried sick.
CARTMAN
You mean the other jakovasaur?
JAKOVASAUR
What means a jakovasaur?
CARTMAN
You're a jakovasaur; that's what they call you.
JAKOVASAUR
Oh. Cool beans.
CARTMAN
But the other jakovasaur talked different.
JAKOVASAUR
That's 'cause Junjun's a girl. Girls talk different.
CARTMAN
I have to call my friends over; they're never gonna believe it.
JAKOVASAUR
Please take me to Junjun. We're the last of our kind. There are only two of us left.
[Cartman's room. He's telling his friends what he learned.]
CARTMAN
He's the last of his kind, you guys. There's only two of them left. [the others stay silent, looking at him]
KYLE
Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?
CARTMAN
Will you stop with the whole "mom smoking crack" thing?! It's a old joke!
JAKOVASAUR
[hidden] Eric, do you have any more cookies? [Cartman turns his head aside and grins]
STAN
Who's that? One of your mom's boyfriends?
CARTMAN
No, that was a jakovasaur. It's okay to come in. [the closet door opens and the jakovasaur comes out]
STAN
Wow!
CARTMAN
Jakov, I want you to meet my friends.
JAKOV
Huhello, guys. I love new friends. [trips and flies across the room, then clears his head. A rattling noise is heard]
CARTMAN
Hahahahaheh, isn't he funny?
STAN
[put off] No, he's annoying.
KYLE
What are we supposed to do with him?
CARTMAN
We have to take him to that rancher's barn to see his girlfriend.
STAN
Why don't we just tell our parents?
CARTMAN
No! Why don't you wanna to understand? We have to do this ourselves.
[The rancher's barn, that same night. The boys break into the barn with Jakov.]
STAN
[softly] Sshh! Be quiet. We could get in big trouble for being here.
JAKOV
[sees his mate and can't help it] Junjun!
STAN
[softly, curtly] Sh! Keep quiet, stupid!
JAKOV
[rushes up to her] Oh, Junjun, I'm so glad you're okay! [she's sitting on some hay]
KYLE
[softly, curtly] Dude, have you ever heard of whispering?!
JAKOV
[turns around] I am whispering! [steps on a rake, whose handle smacks him on the head] Yyeow!
CARTMAN
[laughing] Haaahahahah. You're so funny, Jakov.
JAKOV
[soothing his head] I am?
STAN
Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond?
JAKOV
Oh, I don't know. This place is kinda nicer than Stark's Pond. [the barn doors open to show the Mayor, the rancher, and the DOI agents looking quite angry.]
JUNJUN
Aw, we's in big doodoo now.
JAKOV
Uh oh.
[Jimbo's lodge, daytime. Ned is on the phone.]
OPERATOR
Hello, and welcome to Voice Box Express, your #1 source for voice boxes. I'm Amanda. How may I help you?
NED
[eructing] Yes... Hello..., um..., I... lost... my... voice... box…
AMANDA
Excuse me?
NED
I... lost... my... voice... box…
AMANDA
[after a long pause] Excuse me?
NED
[faster, after a pause] I... lost... my... voice... box... [Jimbo enters the room and Ned hangs up]
JIMBO
Hey Ned, look what I bought you! A new voice box! [Ned reaches for it, but Jimbo keeps it out of reach, teasing Ned] You want it? You want it? Yeah! Do you? Yeah! You want it? All right, here you go. [hands him the box] Well, try it out!
NED
[crisply] Mmm. Aw, Jimbo, I can't thank you enough for the new voice box. Gmmm, now, what in the devil is this thing?
JIMBO
Oh, no, I must have picked up the Irish model by mistake.
NED
Mmm-aw, what a bloody pickle this is! Did you keep the receipt, then?
MAN
[barges in] You guys come quick! I've only just heard!
JIMBO
What? What is it?
MAN
They've found another one! They've found another jakovasaur! [silence]
NED
Gmmm, blimey.
[South Park Square. The Mayor stands on stage with the DOI agents and the two jakovasaurs as the townsfolk filter in. The boys stand in front of the steps on the left side of the stage.]
MAYOR
[on the mic] Here with more on the status of the jakovasaurs is Department of Interior guy.
DOI 1
Thank you, Mayor. [takes over] The noble jakovasaur is on the brink of extinction. And now, you, as a community, have a chance to bring them back.
CARTMAN
[reading his acceptance speech] "Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."
KYLE
What are you doing, fatass?!
CARTMAN
I'm preparing my speech for when they call me up to congratulate on me on my discovery. "Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."
DOI 1
...Hope and Jakov are the last of their kind. But with the help of the Mayor, we have implemented a plan to help them breed. We will give them a home and a fighting chance at survival.
MAN
[amid much chatter] Yea for us!
JAKOV
Thank you!
MAYOR
And now, the little boy who first discovered the jakovasaurs, Eric Cartman!
CARTMAN
[walks to the podium and speaks] Thank you, Mayor, for this honorable distinction.
MAN 2
Well, that's about it. Let's go.
MAN 3
Yeah. [the crowd begins to disperse]
CARTMAN
You know, there's really only two seasons here in South Park: Winter, and July, heh heh heh. But, but um, seriously, South Park has always been a place of discovery for me... [finds himself all alone in the square] Ey, you sons of bitches! Get back here! I'm having a god-damned distinctive honor!
[The jakovasaurs' new home. Everyone involved in finding and caring for the jakovasaurs is there.]
JAKOV
Wow!! It's so pretty!
DOI 1
Well, Jakov, we hope this new home "inspires" you and Hope to uh, hm, you know... [the room falls silent]
JAKOV
What?
DOI 2
Well, we'd love to see more jakovasaurs, so, maybe you two should uuh…
JAKOV
What?
DOI 3
Get to some business. [make a ring with the thumb and index finger of one hand and sticks the other index finger through the ring]
JAKOV
[scratches his head] What??
KYLE
They want you to have sex, God-damnit!!
JAKOV
Ooohh.
MAYOR
[as the rest leave the house] We'll just leave you two lovebirds alone.
JAKOV
Well, all right, then. [the Mayor closes the door]
[The jakovasaurs have no idea what to do, so they don't do anything. Outside, the boys, the agents, the Mayor, the rancher, and Jimbo wait for something to happen. Sure enough, things are heard falling inside. Jakov is heard moaning and yelling as he stumbles around. Junjun runs out of the house and Jakov stands at the entrance.]
JUNJUN
Meesa just don't wanna!
JAKOV
[walking out] I don't know what to do!
DOI 1
Jakov, to have sex, all you need to do is, well, you know, put your... [sees there's nothing where something should be] Hmmm. [stroke his chin] I guess we don't know exactly how jakovasaurs mate.
DOI 2
[holds his index finger up] There is... another option.
[Mephesto's ranch. The boys, the agents, and the Mayor are present with the jakovasaurs. Jakov and Junjun are on the examination table.]
MEPHESTO
I've managed to artificially inseminate Hope with your semen.
JAKOV
I have seamen? Where's their boat? [imitates a fog horn] Arrrrr-urrrrr! Arrrrr-urrrrr! [Cartman laughs]
MEPHESTO
Yes, yes, that's... very funny, Jakov. [Jakov stops] I... will need to examine Hope once more to see if the process worked. [sticks a syringe into Junjun's arm and draws a blood sample. Junjun reacts immediately as Mephesto goes to his microscope]
JUNJUN
Oh-wwoooooop! Oh-wwoooooop!
JAKOV
[adds his reaction] Arrrrr-urrrrr! Arrrrr-urrrrr!
STAN
God-damn!
KYLE
Shut up!!
MEPHESTO
Yes! Yes, I think it worked! [Jakov and Junjun stop as Mephesto turns to face the group] You are going to be parents!
DOI 3
Yeah!
DOI 2
We did it!
JAKOV
Now I can be like all the other guys in South Park!
STAN
[to Kyle] Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around?
[The Marsh house. A football game is heard inside. Next, several men are behind or sitting on the sofa. Seated are Randy, Gerald, and Stuart, and behind are Chef, Mr. Mackey, and Mr. Garrison. Jakov is seated next to them on a folding chair. Jakov will now know what it is to be one of the guys.]
COMMENTATOR
...and Bubby Brister is having a great first quarter! Let's see what trickery he uses here. Here's the snap, and he's down-
JAKOV
Thanks for inviting me to watch the game, guys!
RANDY
No problem, Jakov.
COMMENTATOR
To the 40-yard line!
MEN
Yea!
JAKOV
Go Niners! Ni-ners!
GERALD
We're rooting for the Broncos here, Jakov!
JAKOV
Oooops!
COMMENTATOR
...to Terrell Davis! He's at the 50, the 40, the 30,... [the men are happy]
JAKOV
You guys know what? [they angrily snap their heads in his directions] This one time, I was watching this rabbit, a brown rabbit-
COMMENTATOR
He breaks another tackle, and the ball is loose!
JAKOV
You guys know what... happened? It touched Junjun right in front of me.
RANDY
Hey Jakov. Uh, could you run down to the store and get some more... pretzels?
JAKOV
Sure. You got money?
GERALD
[hands him some bills] Here- here you go. And and don't go to the store down the block. The one four miles away in Fairplay has better pretzels.
JAKOV
[gets up] Cool beans. [trips over the plug, knocking down the TV] Oopsie. I'll be right back. [closes the door]
MR. MACKEY
Jakovasaurs kinda piss me off, mkay.
THE OTHERS
Yup.
[The house of the jakovasaurs. The boys, the agents, Jimbo, Mephesto, the Mayor, and Sheila are all present.]
DOI 1
Amazing! The gestation period was only four days.
DOI 2
At that rate, we could repopulate the jakovasaurs in just a few years.
JUNJUN
Doe-wooop!
DOI 1
Don't worry, Hope. Everything's gonna be fine, just fine.
DOI 3
Just fine.
DOI 2
Fine.
KYLE
Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby.
CARTMAN
If Jakov and Hope don't have kids, their race will become extinct.
KYLE
Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was. [he and Stan laugh]
CARTMAN
Hey! I might have been still-born, but at least I got better!
DOI 2
Here we go.
JUNJUN
Doe-woooop!
SHEILA
[gushing] Behold, the miracle of childbirth!
JUNJUN
Dowoop! [her water breaks and lands on everyone]
KYLE
Gross!
JUNJUN
Dowoop! [a baby jakovasaur is shot out and strikes the wall. It whimpers as it drops]
ALL
Hooray!
DOI 3
This is the first step in bringing the species back from the brink of extinction! [the baby jakovasaur gets up and moves around, growling]
JUNJUN
Dowoooop! Dowoop!
DOI 2
Looks like there might be a second one.
DOI 1
Wow! That would be a great start for them. [close-up of the second baby flying out of the vagina]
ALL
Hooray! [Junjun starts pumping babies out in all directions. The adults crouch behind the sofa for cover]
MAYOR
She's a cannon! [seventeen babies end up in front of the wall. The lead agent walks up to them]
DOI 1
Well. Ap-parently, they breed in litters.
CARTMAN
[picks up a baby and says sweetly] Aren't they cute, you guys?
STAN
[to Kyle] Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing.
JUNJUN
Huh-owhoa-o-woop! [pumps out a second set of jakovasaurs]
DOI 1
Huh?! [getting out of the way] Whoa-o-whoa!
[South Park Elementary, Garrison's class. Class is now in session.]
MR. GARRISON
Ho-okay, children, we have some new students joining us today. Let's all be warm and welcome them to our class. [the class is full of jakovasaur children]
STAN
Dude, it's crowded in here.
JAKOVASAUR BOY
[sitting in front of Pip] I like school!
JAKOVASAUR GIRL
Bo-woop!
MR. GARRISON
O-kay, so, we're just gonna stick to our normal lesson plan and start the day with history. [starts writing on the board] Now, does anyone know why Chubby Checker left the Beatles in 1972? [a jakovasaur kid in the front row raises his hand and waves it] Yes?
JAKOVASAUR BOY
I don't know.
JAKOVASAUR GIRL
Bo-woop!
MR. GARRISON
O-kay, is there anyone who can answer the question?
JAKOVASAUR KID 1
[in front of Wendy] I can't.
JAKOVASAUR KID 2
Me neither.
MR. GARRISON
[angrily] Damnit, you don't raise your hand if you don't know!
JAKOVASAUR KID 2
Oh.
JAKOVASAUR KID 3
O-wowo-oop! O-woo-oop!
JAKOVASAUR KID 4
Ooo! Fight! Fight! [he and another jakovasaur start to fight]
JAKOVASAUR KID 5
School, school! I like school! [the fighting escalates]
JAKOVASAURS
School, school! I like school!

School, school! I like school!
KYLE
Dude, this sucks ass!
CARTMAN
["School, school! I like school!"] I like going to school now. Jakovasaurs are so cool. ["School, school! I like school!"]
MR. HAT
This is insane, Mr. Garrison. ["School, school! I like school!"]
MR. GARRISON
[looking defeated] It sure is, Mr. Hat. ["School, school! I like-!"]
[The bar, that night. Many of the town's adults are inside chatting away, including the Mayor.]
MAYOR
Now, folks, I know we're all a little worried about the jakovasaurs, and I want to hear you all out!
MR. GARRISON
Mayor, the little jakovasaurs are ruining my classroom. I can't teach our kids anything!
ALL
Yeah!
CHEF
And those jakovasaur eat three times as much as normal children! I can't keep up!
ALL
Yeah!
MAN
Totally!
TRASHMAN
And they're creating more trash than we can handle, too!
MAN
Totally!
ALL
Yeah!
MAN
Listen to her!
MAN 2
And what about little Laura, the Williams' kid? If she doesn't get that heart-valve operation, she could die. [no one responds, so he supports himself] Yeah! Yeah, that's right!
MAYOR
All right, all right. It's obvious we have to do something, but we can't just make them leave.
JIMBO
We just encourage them to find someplace better.
MAYOR
But where? Jakovasaurs are big, loud, annoying, and stupid. Where would they fit in?
[The house of the jakovasaurs, next day. The Mayor and others are talking to Jakov and Junjun]
JAKOV
Memphis?
MAYOR
Yes, Memphis. [shows him a brochure of the city] You jakovasaurs would love it there.
JAKOV
I don't know. I like South Park a lot. What do you think, honey?
JUNJUN
G'ooh-woo-ooop!
JAKOV
Yeah.
MAYOR
But everyone in South Park wishes they could live in Memphis. Right? [several people respond with "Yeah" and "Memphis"]
JAKOV
Okay, we'll move to Memphis!
MEN
Yea!
OTHERS
Hooray! [the door opens, and the boys appear with Liane]
CARTMAN
[cheerfully] Hey, Jakov, how's it going?
JAKOV
Great, Eric! We're moving.
CARTMAN
[gasps] Moving?
JAKOV
Me, Jun and the family are heading to the Promised Land of Memphis.
CARTMAN
You... can't leave. You're my friend.
LIANE
Oh, Eric dear. It's what's best.
JIMBO
Yeah. Let's get that luggage packed!
CARTMAN
[softly] Jakov, please don't go. [music] You make everything in South Park fun. [Jakov is touched] You brought life to this whole town. It would suck without you.
JAKOV
It would?
CARTMAN
Yes. These people, Jakov, these people need you. I need you. Please, Jakov. Stay?
JAKOV
O-kay. I like South Park best of all. We're staying!
CARTMAN
[exulting] Hoo-ray! Jakov is staying, you guys! [everyone else is pissed at him]
[Outside. Everyone leaves the house disappointed.]
MAYOR
Now what do we do?
DOI 1
Don't worry, We've come up with a plan.
MAYOR
You have?
DOI 1
Yes. We're leaving.
ALL
What??
DOI 1
We're getting the hell out of here and away from those God-damned things.
MAYOR
You can't leave.
CARTMAN
Yes. Who would take care of them?
DOI 2
Little boy, we're making you an honorary Department of Interior person. [gives him a DOI badge] So now, you are officially in charge of South Park's fish and wildlife. You have authority over all of them.
CARTMAN
[a bit humbly] I have authoriteh?
DOI 2
That's right. And people must respect it.
CARTMAN
[fitting into the role] Well, that should be fine, just fine. [the agents climb into their van]
DOI 2
Fine, just fine.
CARTMAN
Fine.
STAN
Oh, no! Nothing's worse than Cartman with authoritah!
DOI 2
Bye-bye, now. [closes the door, and the van speeds away. Stan and Kyle just look at each other.]
[The Jakovasaurs' house, later that week.]
ANNOUNCER
And now back to... Jakovasaurs! on Comedy Central. ["Jakovasaurs" appears on screen. Then, Junjun appears in the living room with some of her children.]
JAKOV
[enters wearing a fedora and carrying a briefcase] Hi, honey! I'm home! [trips over the welcome mat and crashes into the sofa. Canned laughter is heard] Wooooo! [gets up, rubbing his head] Boy, it was rough at work today. I've never seen so much coffee.
JUNJUN
Booo-wooop?
JAKOV
No, in the boss's lap. [more laughter]
BOY
Hello, dad.
JAKOV
Hello, son. How was your day?
BOY
Oh, not so good. Something really strange happened.
JAKOV
What? You mean MTV played a video that wasn't Will Smith? [more laughter]
BOY
Noho, dad. A man in a blue suit and a bag came to the door. He just left this li'l piece of paper with a stamp on it. [brings out the letter]
JAKOV
That's called a mailman. He takes care of mail.
BOY
Oh! He took care of mom, too. [more laughter]
JAKOV
You're a nut! Let me see that letter. [opens it and reads the letter] It's from a game show. The Mayor has invited me to compete. [the front door opens]
CARTMAN
Hi, Jakov. [applause] What the hell is that? [laughter] Who's laughing?
JAKOV
Eric! The Mayor has invited us to compete on a game show in South Park! Big prizes, an all-expense paid vacation-
CARTMAN
Wow, that's cool. I can help you get ready. [he and Jakov start walking]
JAKOV
Woo, woo! [trips over one of his kids and falls on his back. Cartman stops. Jakov gets up. He and Cartman face the camera as laughter and applause are heard, and grin.]
[While Cartman visits Jakov, the other boys are in the Mayor's office with several townsfolk. Liane is there, too.]
MAYOR
[anxious] Come onn, come on! [the phone rings and she snatches the receiver] Hello!
JAKOV
Mayor? This is Jakov. I'm the tall fellow down the block from-
MAYOR
Yes. Yes, Jakov. You're calling about the game show. Congratulations! Will you do it?!
JAKOV
Sure! If a free trip is involved, can my whole family go?
MAYO
[rushing] Of course! That's the point! Just be ready this afternoon at the public access building, and good luck! Hope you win!! [thrusts the receiver to arm's length]
JAKOV
Cool beans!! [the Mayor hangs up]
MAYOR
We've got 'em! All right. The boys here will keep little Eric Cartman distracted. Meanwhile, we get rid of the jakovasaurs and bring some normalcy back to this town! Ready?
ALL
Break!
[South Park Public Access. The Mayor is hosting her own game show this afternoon. To her right is Jakov, to her left Officer Barbrady. Jakovasaurs cheer in the first two rows in the studio audience. Jimbo approaches Ned.]
JIMBO
Hey, Ned! A package came for you today from Voice Box Express.
NED
[eructing] Oh... boy..., oh... boy.
MAYOR
[whispering in Barbrady's ear] Now remember, Barbrady, all you have to do is lose!
BARBRADY
Right.
MAYOR
[goes back to her mark] Okay. Let's quiet down, people and jakovasaurs! [turns on the mic] Now, as you know, the winner of this little game will get an all-expense paid trip for himself and fifty of his closest relatives to lovely France! [the jakovasaurs hoot and holler] And, all one of you lucky contestants has to do is answer only one of these questions! Are you ready, players?
BARBRADY
Ready.
JAKOV
Ready.
MAYOR
Okay. Hands on your buzzers.
JAKOV
[bzt] Forty-seven! [his kids cheer wildly]
MAYOR
[correcting Jakov] You have to wait until I ask the question first.
JAKOV
Sor-ry!
MAYOR
That's okay. Hands on buzzers.
JAKOV
[bzt] Turkey sandwich!
BARBRADY
Damn, he's quick!
JAKOV
[bzt] Oh. Sor-ry! [bzt]
BARBRADY
No, I'm sorry. [bzzzt]
JAKOV
[Bzzzzzzzzt] No, it's my fault. I'm sorry.
BARBRADY
[Bzzzzzzzzt] No, it's all me. Uh, my bad.
JAKOV
Sorry.
BARBRADY
Sorry. [both buzzers stay on]
MAYOR
Will somebody please unplug the God-damned buzzers?! [the buzzers stop]
STAGEHAND
[off camera] Got it!
MAYOR
Now, can we get on with this? First question: What color is blue? [drumroll]
BARBRADY
Blue? [ping. Barbrady gets the first point]
MAYOR
What?
BARBRADY
Uh. Blue is blue?
JAKOV
Awww, did I lose?
MAYOR
What? Blue is-? Nono. Hang on. [whispers to Barbrady] You're supposed to lose, you idiot!
BARBRADY
Where am I?
MAYOR
Just don't answer any more questions, got it?
BARBRADY
Okie-dokie.
MAYOR
Sorry, folks, a little mix-up. We're playing best out of three!
[The woods. Stan and Kyle lead Cartman along. Cartman is in uniform.]
CARTMAN
What are we doing out here, you guys? I wanna see if Jakov wins that game show.
STAN
Oh, he'll win. Don't worry.
KYLE
We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.
CARTMAN
Oh. Let me get out my notepad so I can classify this new species. [brings it out] Well, this should be fine, just fine. Just fine, fine.
KYLE
[pointing] There it is! [a shot of Kenny wearing twigs] That must be of the antelope family.
CARTMAN
[after some study] That's Kenny with branches on his head. [looks again] Why did you bring me all the way out here, you guys?
STAN
[huffs] Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that.
CARTMAN
Well, what does that have to do with me being all the way out...? Wait a minute. You're distracting me! That game show is a fix! [drops his notepad and rushes back to town]
KYLE
Cartman! Wait!
KENNY
(Hey you guys, wait up for me!) [a black bear rushes down the hill, growling] (Waaah!) [the bear mauls him and tumbles away]
[South Park Public Access. The game show continues. Barbrady is ahead 7-0.]
MAYOR
What's two plus two, Jakov?
JAKOV
I don't know!
BARBRADY
Four? [ping. 8-0]
MAYOR
Jakov, what is your name? [drumroll. The studio audience looks at him quite annoyed]
BARBRADY
Jakov [ping. 9-0]
MAYOR
Oh, screw it. Jakov wins! [raises his hand in victory]
JAKOV
I do? [his kids rejoice]
MAYOR
You and your entire family are going to wonderful and exotic France!
JAKOV
Hooray!
MAYOR
All right, everybody. Let's get them to the airport! [members of the studio audience start carrying out little jakovasaurs] Let's go, people! There's no time to lose! [two people carry Jakov out]
[South Park Airport. The jakovasaurs are being whisked into the plane as quickly as possible.]
JAKOV
[looking at Randy and Gerald] But what about our clothes? Shouldn't we pack first?
RANDY
Jakovasaurs don't wear clothes, Jakov.
JAKOV
Oh yeah. Well, good-bye everybody! We'll send stuff from France!
CROWD
Good-bye!
JAKOV
[almost trips as he turns to enter the plane] Werrr. [the crowd laughs weakly]
CARTMAN
[arriving and running up the stairs] Jakov!
JIMBO
Close the door! [an attendant closes the door on Cartman's face]
CARTMAN
[pounding] Open this door!
LIANE
Eric, this is for the best.
CARTMAN
[facing the crowd angrily] I am Department of Interior guy, and I have authoritah! [the plane backs into the runway, then moves forward. Cartman rushes down the steps and runs alongside the plane] No! Jakov, don't go!
JAKOV
[from his window] Hi, Eric! Okay, bye, then! [the plane takes off. Cartman can only watch as the plane disappears in the horizon]
CARTMAN
[resigned] Come... back. [the crowd begins to surround him.]
LIANE
[reaching out] Eric, it's important for you to understand-.
CARTMAN
Don't, mother! Just, don't.
MAYOR
[on one knee] I know it's hard, Eric, but I've learned something today. You see, animal species come and go. It's all a part of natural evolution.
JIMBO
The jakovasaurs would have gone extinct if we hadn't interfered. Because their particular form of life simply wasn't practical.
NED
[with a much better voice box] We can't go around saving every form of life, any more than we can kill them all. We have to let nature run its course. [silence]
JIMBO
Mhmm Ned, that voice box sucks!
NED
I know. I'm still trying to find my old one.
MAYOR
Well, then. What say we all go get some ice cream!
CROWD
Hooray!
CARTMAN
No. That's okay. I'll see you guys. [slowly walks away]
KYLE
Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something.
STAN
Yeah. I guess he finally found something that's as annoying as he is.
[The Café Grenouille in Paris, France. The Eiffel Tower in in the background. An accordionist plays.]
WAITER
Bonjour.
WOMAN
[blonde wearing stylish shades] Bonjour.
WAITER
Café?
WOMAN
Oui. [a bus pulls up and drops off passengers, then pulls away]
JAKOV
[with his family] Come on, kids! Let's go find some pyramids! [crashes into a table and ends up in its umbrella on the ground] Woops! Aaaah! [The accordionist stops and everyone stares at Jakov. Then they start laughing]
MAN
[one of two in suits] C'est drôle et amusant (That was SO FUNNY!!) [chuckles]
ACCORDIONIST
(I love its antics!!!)
BLONDE
Il est si comme Jerry Lewis!!! (He's just like Jerry Lewis!!!) [the laughter continues]
End of Jakovasaurs

synopsis:A giant panda mascot educates the children on sexual harassment. Cartman sues Stan for sexual harassment, which eventually leads to everyone in South Park suing each other.

script:Sexual Harassment Panda

[Mr. Garrison's classroom. The kids chat away as Tolkien enters]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children. Let's take our seats. We have something very important to discuss. Due to recent events around the country I've been instructed to teach you all about sexual harassment in school.
KYLE
About what?
MR. GARRISON
Now, does anybody know what sexual harassment means? [Cartman raises his hand] Yes, Eric?
CARTMAN
When you're trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind.
MR. GARRISON
...No, Eric! That's not what I'm talking about! The school board has sent over a special guest to teach us all about sexual harassment in schools. Please welcome Peetie, the Sexual Harassment Panda. [Peetie enters]
PEETIE
[song and dance]
Who lives in the east 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda
Who explains sexual harassment to you and me?
Sexual Harassment Panda
"Don't say that! Don't touch there!
Don't be nasty!" says the silly bear
He's come to tell you what's right and wrong
Sexual Harassment Panda
Hi, boys and girls. [the class says nothing]
MR. GARRISON
Say "hi" to Sexual Harassment Panda!
CLASS
[hesitant] Hi, Sexual Harassment Panda.
CLYDE
Hababah...
PEETIE
[reaches behind the desk for a picture of two pandas in briefs] Did you know that when one little panda pulls on another little panda's underwear, that's sexual harassment? That makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda. [drops his head to one side]
KYLE
[to Stan] This is freaking me out, dude.
PEETIE
[shows another picture of two pandas...] And when one little panda puts his furry little willy in another panda's ear, that makes me a very sad panda. [puts the picture away and gets some literature] Now, I'm going to pass out these booklets, and we're going to go through each and every sexual harassment law.
CLASS
Awgh..!
[Five hours later...]
PEETIE
"...Article 36, Section 19: One panda may not make sexual comments about another panda's appearance. If said panda does make..."
STAN
Ohh, dude, get me out of here!
CARTMAN
I think Sexual Harassment Panda is cool.
STAN
You would think that, you little ass-sucker.
CARTMAN
What did you call me?
STAN
An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker.
CARTMAN
[indignant] That does it! I am suing you for sexual harassment!
PEETIE
Uh-oh.
STAN
What?
CARTMAN
You have... sexually harassed me for the last time! It says right here... that now I can sue you and take all of your money.
PEETIE
That's right, he can.
STAN
No you can't, you little ass-sucker!
CARTMAN
Oh, you did it again! You all heard him!
PEETIE
"The first party of the first panda may sue the second-party panda unless that panda was said panda aforementioned panda."
[South Park Courthouse, day. The Honorable Judge Julie presiding]
JUDGE JULIE
This is Cartman vs. Marsh, Case No. 3433. What is your complaint, Mr. Cartman?
CARTMAN
Your Honor, my lawyer is just parking the car. He should be here any second.
KYLE
[sitting by Stan] Dude! He got a lawyer?
GERALD
[entering] Sorry I'm late.
KYLE
Dad?!
GERALD
Oh! Hi, Kyle. [moves to Cartman's side]
JUDGE JULIE
All right. Let's move this along, shall we? Now, Eric Cartman, uh, you claim that Stan Marsh sexually harassed you in school.
CARTMAN
Th... That is correct, my honor.
STAN
Hoh, whatever! [rests his head on his left hand]
CARTMAN
He talked about having oral sex with my ass.
STAN
I called you an ass-sucker!
CARTMAN
Yes, that was it. I was suh-so upset. [sniffs, Gerald comforts him] I couldn't concentrate the rest of the day. And the way his eyes kept looking at me, slowly going up and down my body, like he was undressing me with his eyes. [hides his face in Gerald's coat and begins sobbing]
STAN
What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time!
GERALD
As you can see, Your Honor, my client is too upset to continue.
JUDGE JULIE
Mr. Marsh, what do you have to say?
STAN
Wwhat do you mean?
JUDGE JULIE
I need to hear your defense.
STAN
Uh... I'm eight?
JUDGE JULIE
All right, this seems pretty open-and-shut. Stan Marsh, under the new Sexual Harassment in Schools law, I am forced to find you guilty.
STAN
Huh?
GERALD
All right, we did it!
CARTMAN
Hooray!
JUDGE JULIE
Since the defendant is underage and has no monetary resources, it is the judgment of this court that 50% of Stan Marsh's belongings are to be handed over to Eric Cartman immediately.
STAN
I have to give him half my stuff?
CARTMAN
Sweet..!
[Marsh residence. Cartman is present with Gerald and a collector in Stan's room]
CARTMAN
Let's see. I want that Clown Criminy game [on the cabinet next to the door. The collector puts it into Cartman's box], and that Power Jim doll. [goes to Stan's toy box] And, let's see... [pulls out a Mega Truck] Do you really like this remote-controlled truck?
STAN
Yeah, dude. That's my favorite toy.
CARTMAN
Oh, well, I'll just take that, then. [tosses it into his box and reaches for a lizard] And what about this? Is this one of your favorites?
STAN
Uh, no! I hate that toy!
CARTMAN
Oh, then you won't mind if I take it! [tosses it into his box]
STAN
Damnit!
COLLECTOR
[approaches Gerald with two toys] Here you go. As your legal fee you can choose between the green choo-choo or the squishy football.
GERALD
Hm. [drops them and walks to Cartman] You know, Eric, I've been thinking, uh...
CARTMAN
Uh-huh? That model airplane kit? Go on.
GERALD
Uh, you know, the people really responsible for your harassment is the public schools. [Cartman looks through Stan's drawers] Perhaps we should sue them next.
CARTMAN
What? But uh, why should I sue the school?
GERALD
Well, because they're the ones that let this harassment go on. And, they have a lot more money. I think we could get a lot more out of this than half of Stan's belongings.
CARTMAN
Interesting. [the collector picks up a can and presses a button on it] Ooo, Stan's asthma inhaler. I want that. [rushes to grab it]
[Courthouse, day. The gavel sounds. Cartman vs. South Park Elementary, The Immediate Party]
JUDGE JULIE
Answer the question. Did you know that sexual harassment was going on in the classroom?
MR. GARRISON
No, I had no freakin' idea!
GERALD
Mr. Garrison, do you know the definition of sexual harassment?
MR. GARRISON
Of course, and so does Mr. Hat. We do not tolerate sexual harassment!
JUDGE JULIE
You are the witness here, Mr. Garrison, not Mr. Hat.
MR. GARRISON
I'm sorry, toots.
GERALD
Did you, or did you not, hear my client being called an ass-sucker?
MR. GARRISON
Yes.
GERALD
And you did nothing.
MR. GARRISON
Well, he is a little ass-sucker. [the audience laughs]
JUDGE JULIE
[gaveling twice] Mr. Garrison, I will remind you that we are in court!
MR. GARRISON
Okay, baby, I'm sorry.
[Later that day. Cartman vs. South Park Elementary, The Responsible Party]
GERALD
Principal Victoria, were you aware that my client was being harassed at your school?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, not any more than any other student.
GERALD
Oh! So you admit that harassment goes on!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I don't know!
GERALD
You don't know?! You're the principal!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I can't be around every second!
GERALD
[staring her down] So it DOES go on!!!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
All right, all right, I killed him. I hit him over the head and I cut up the body. I tried to burn him, but it wouldn't burn! Oh, the smell of it! I put the legs in garbage bags and hid the torso under a bridge. I HAD TO DO IT!! [beaks down on the stand] OH GOD!!!
GERALD
Principal Victoria, was Eric Cartman called an ass-sucker? Yes or no?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[composes herself] I believe so, yes. [the audience begins to murmur]
MAN
That's sexual harassment.
[The courthouse, still later. Cartman vs. South Park Elementary, The Expert Witness]
GERALD
Last, I'd like to bring up my expert witness: Sexual Harassment Panda.
PEETIE
[song and dance as he goes to the stand]
Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda
GERALD
Expert witness, did South Park Elementary allow sexual harassment to go on?
PEETIE
Well, when one little panda asks another little panda to perform oral sex, that is sexual harassment.
GERALD
And who's to blame?
PEETIE
I'm afraid the law states that the school must be held responsible.
GERALD
There! You have it! Straight from the horse's mouth!
PEETIE
Panda.
GERALD
Pan-Panda's mouth.
[Cartman vs. South Park Elementary, The Verdict]
JUDGE JULIE
After careful review, it is the judgment of this court that South Park Elementary pays Eric Theodore Cartman $1.3 million in damages.
GERALD
All right! We did it, Eric!
CARTMAN
[takes his jacket off and twirls it around]

It's time to celebrate, yeah
It's time to celebrate, yeah
[Broflovski residence. It is literally bigger now - 50% taller, wider, deeper... Same with the garage, itself bigger than the house to it's right. The icicles are also bigger. Furniture movers come by with new furnishings for the new, big house. Two delivery men take a big-screen TV into the house]
GERALD
That goes in the master bedroom. [Kyle walks up] Well, Kyle. What do you think of your new house?
KYLE
It's... big.
GERALD
Yes, it is big, isn't it? It is very big.
KYLE
Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?
GERALD
Well Kyle, schools have lots of money. You see, we all pay taxes, and part of that tax money goes to public schools, and it's from that money that we got our 1.3 million.
KYLE
[thinks a bit] And you don't see a problem with that?
GERALD
No. It's a very fragile system that nature has designed. All things flow into each other.
KYLE
You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you?
GERALD
Sort of, yeah.
[Mr. Garrison's classroom, some days later. The alphabet strip, the poster, and the teacher's desk and chair are gone. Only the chalkboard remains. Mr. Garrison enters]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, there's a few changes being made here at school, but lessons will go on as normal. Any questions? [Stan raises his hand. The desks, pictures, and numbers are gone] Yes, Stan?
STAN
Where's our desks?
MR. GARRISON
Right, desks. Well, a lot of cuts had to be made since the school's funding is short for lawsuits.
STAN
[huffs] You see, Cartman? You see what this has done?
CARTMAN
All I know is, I got this sweet digital watch and these cool shoes; I'm telling you guys, suing people kicks ass!
CLYDE
Wow! I wanna sue somebody! [smiles at Bebe]
BEBE
Me, too. I wanna get a lawyer.
CLASS
Yeah!
KENNY
(Woohoo!)
MR. GARRISON
Well, let's just try to cope with the changes and do our schoolwork. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence on the board, and I want you to tell me the noun. [starts writing, with a nail. The sound just grates to the ear]
CLASS
[wincing] AAGGGHHH!!
MR. GARRISON
[turns to face the class] I know, I know. I'm sorry, children, but we can't afford chalk anymore. I have to write on the chalkboard with this rusty nail. Anyway, children, in the sentence, "The ball is red..." [loud scratching]
CLASS
[wincing] AAGGGGHHH!!
[The offices of Broflovski and Jackson. Gerald is in his office looking out the window. His briefcase is open. Music starts for a commercial]
GERALD
[turns around] Kids! Are you tired of being harassed at school? Sick of being called a homo? A farty-pants? A butt-... face? Then call me, Kyle's dad, and I'll help you [slams his briefcase shut] close the lid on sexual harassment in schools!
BEBE
[outside] After a boy in my class tried to put his tongue in my mouth, I knew I needed legal help. Kyle's dad helped me get a $1.6 million settlement, and this bright new shiny bicycle. Thank you, Kyle's dad! [rings her bell and rides away]
CLYDE
[on a yacht, The Litigator, sunning himself] Kyle's dad got me 1.4 million, and he can do it for you, too. Just look at all these beautiful girls! [four of them come to cater to him]
GERALD
So call me, Kyle's dad. Because it's not about money, it's about... wait, what am I saying? Call me! [jumps for joy. This shot is frozen as the jingle is sung]
SINGERS
'Kids picking on you? Well, don't be sad
Just sue their asses with Kyle's dad
["Call now! 1-555-SUE THEM"]
[South Park School Board meeting at South Park Elementary]
CHAIRMAN
All right, what other cuts do we have to make to the school budget?
WOMAN
Uh, next we have Tom Morris. He plays Sexual Harassment Panda at the schools.
CHAIRMAN
Oh, right. We certainly can't afford him anymore.
WOMAN
I warn you, Mr. Evans, uh, Tom Morris takes his job a little seriously.
PEETIE
[enters]
Hello, sexual harassment cubs.
Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda
MR. EVANS
Uh uh, have a seat, Mr. Morris.
PEETIE
Who?
MR. EVANS
Uh... S-Sexual Harassment Panda.
PEETIE
Oh, all right. [sits]
MR. EVANS
Uh—M-m-m-Mr. Morris, we at the school board have been thinking, and, we've decided that perhaps a "panda" isn't the best way to explain sexual harassment to children. [Peetie's head tilts]
WOMAN
You see, Mr. Morris, we believe that a panda doesn't really have anything to do with... sexual harassment. [long pause] At all.
MR. EVANS
...I'm afraid we're just going to have to let you go.
PEETIE
[rubs his eyes] I'm a sa-a-a-a-ad panda.
[The courthouse, day. The dominoes begin to tumble. Pip vs. Cartman]
JUDGE JULIE
Eric Cartman, it is the judgment of this court that you sexually harassed Pip Philip at school.
CARTMAN
No way!
PIP
I won!
CARTMAN
This is ridiculous!
JUDGE JULIE
You asked Pip to suck your... you know what. You must give Pip half your stuff, and the school must give Pip $1.6 million.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[Mr. Mackey sits with her] Oh, dear God!
GERALD
Wow, I'm good!
JUDGE JULIE
Next!
[Craig vs. Wendy. They go to their respective podiums. The boys have left]
CRAIG
This girl touched my thigh.
JUDGE JULIE
Half her belongings, school is sued for 2.1 million.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
We're ruined!
JUDGE JULIE
Next!
[Mr. Mackey vs. Tweek. They go to their respective podiums.]
MR. MACKEY
Uh, Your Honor, this young man commented on the shape of my ass.
TWEEK
[hops] Guh!
JUDGE JULIE
Half his stuff, 2 million from the school.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh..! [faints right off the chair]
[South Park Elementary, class time, barren classroom]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, let's all take our seats. We have a lot to learn today. [gets out the rusty nail, but turns to see the class with Mr. Broflovski in the back] Oohh-kay. Uh, Clyde, can you tell me when Ulysses S. Grant was president?
CLYDE
Um...
GERALD
[admonishing] Don't answer that!
MR. GARRISON
Uh, Craig, how about you?
CRAIG
Um... [Gerald whispers in his ear] Okay. I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incinerate me.
GERALD
[whispers] Incriminate.
CRAIG
Incriminate.
MR. GARRISON
[angrily] Okay, children, I'm having a real problem with you all having lawyers. It is really disrupting class time! [Gerald approaches and whispers in his ear] Uh huh. Ri-oh, uh oh, I see. Oh, okay. Ri-ight. [Gerald leaves] Kids, what I meant to say is that I fully condone you all having lawyers and support your legal recourses in every way. Now, let's get back to Ulysses S. Grant, if that's okay with you, uhum...
[Cafeteria. The boys are in line. At least the tables are still there]
KEVIN
[to Red] Let's trade sandwiches.
[The kitchen. The poster and menu board are missing, but the counter is there]
CHEF
Hello there, children!
BOYS
Hey, Chef.
CHEF
How's it going?
STAN
Bad.
CHEF
Well, they're about to get worse. All I can serve you for lunch is lumpy potatoes.
CARTMAN
Lumpy potatoes?! Oh, no!
CHEF
Sorry, children. All my funding's been cut.
CARTMAN
Oh my God! You guys have to do something!
STAN
Chef, how can we stop all these sexual assment lawsuits?
CHEF
I don't know, children. [to Kyle] Why don't you ask your dad? He's a lawyer, ain't he?
KYLE
I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money.
CHEF
Well, somebody else has got to know all about this sexual harassment whosafudge.
KYLE
Hey, what about that stupid panda?
STAN
Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him!
CHEF
Well, I hope you do. Otherwise, it's lumpy potatoes from here on out.
CARTMAN
Noooo! [runs out]
[South Park School Board meeting]
MR. EVANS
That's thirty-two more lawsuits in the past twenty-four hours.
WOMAN
Oh my God!
MR. EVANS
Looks like we'll have to cut all counseling and nutrition programs.
WOMAN
The children have started suing adults. They could sue us next.
MR. EVANS
Holy smokes, you're right!
STAN
[enter with Kyle, Cartman, Kenny] 'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please.
MR. EVANS
Ugh! [he and the other members hide behind their chairs] P-please! Don't sue us.
KYLE
[confused] Huh?
MAN
We'll give you anything you want.
STAN
We want Sexual Harassment Panda.
MR. EVANS
Oh! Well, uh... We had to let him go.
CARTMAN
What?!
MR. EVANS
[ducks and rises again] D'uh. I mean, he left.
STAN
Well, where is he?!
WOMAN
We don't know! Honestly, I swear it! Please!! Let us go!
STAN
What the hell is wrong with these people?!
[The Company]
COMPANY REP
Well. Uh, your credentials are very impressive, and you do seem to have a lot of ambition, uh but I'm afraid there's no room for you at our company at this time.
PEETIE
It's because I'm a panda, isn't it?
COMPANY REP
Well, i-it is because you're a panda. Euh, it's because you're a sexual harassment panda.
PEETIE
I can't help what I am.
COMPANY REP
Now, have you ever heard of a retreat called "The Island of Misfit Mascots"?
PEETIE
Well, yes, but that place is for loser mascots that make no sense.
COMPANY REP
Well, uh, yes. They may be... just what you're looking for.
PEETIE
I don't have to sit here and listen to this! How would you like a big panda punch in your puss?!
[Special Report: Sexual Harassment]
REPORTER
As sexual harassment lawsuits increase all over the state, the mother of all trials is set to begin. The sexual harassment case of Everyone vs. Everyone begins tomorrow. No matter what the outcome, the public schools are sure to lose at least a whopping $30 million. Representing the side of Everyone is Gerald Broflovski, the lawyer from South Park who plans to make quite a commission. Representing the side of Everyone Else is Gerald Broflovski. So whatever the outcome, things look very bright for Kyle's dad. Personally, I think Kyle's dad is just a whore, taking advantage of everyone in town and... [a note is handed to him] This just in! Newscaster Kevin McCarty is being sued by Kyle's dad for slander. The newscaster has yet to be reached for comment. Wait...
[South Park Bar. Cool Beer In Here. A jukebox plays. Peetie sits at the bar, and three unsavory patrons, two of them seated, study him.]
JUKEBOX
Some days just seem lonely

Still, there don't seem to be no end in sight...
BARKEEP
Another scotch? [Peetie nods affirmatively, and the barkeep serves up another scotch. Peetie sips]
JUKEBOX
So I'll drive this ol' 18-wheeler down the highway...
STANDING PATRON
Hey! Panda bear! [Peetie lowers his drink to look at him] We don't take kindly to your types in here.
BARKEEP
Now, calm down, Skeeter. He ain't hurtin' nobody.
SKEETER
No! [approaches Peetie] I wanna know som'in' from Mr. Panda Bear here! If you pandas are from mountainous areas of China and Tibet, how come you eat bamboo, which is prone to grow only in drier, more arid regions?! [Peetie has no answer]
BARKEEP
Sk-heeter, I don't want no trouble nu-how.
PEETIE
It's okay. I get it. There's no room in the world for pandas. Well, you don't have to worry about me! I'm off to the Island of Misfit Mascots! [rises and goes out the door. Skeeter watches him go]
BARKEEP
Damnit, Skeeter! How come every time a panda bear come in here you gotta go flappin' your jaw?
[Broflovski residence. Now it has massive front doors, five stories, and a water fountain just to the right of the doors. The garage itself is bigger than the house next to it. And the icicles are bigger, too. More furniture arrives]
GERALD
[Kyle arrives] Well? What do you think, Kyle?
KYLE
Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough?
GERALD
Well, this one is bigger!
KYLE
Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it!
GERALD
[kneels] Kyle, let me explain something to you.
KYLE
[annoyed, looks askance] Hoh God, here we go.
GERALD
You see, Kyle, we live in a liberal, democratic society. And Democrats make sexual harassment laws. These laws tell us what we can and can't say in the workplace. And what we can and can't do in the workplace.
KYLE
Isn't that fascism?
GERALD
No, because we don't call it fascism. Do you understand?
KYLE
Do you?
GERALD
[rises] Just look at how big this house is, Kyle. Just look at it.
[South Park Bar. Stan, Cartman and Kenny enter. The three patrons are still there]
STAN
[enters] 'Scuse me.
BARKEEP
Yeah? What can I do for you?
STAN
Somebody told us they saw a big panda bear in here.
BARKEEP
Big panda bear, big panda bear, hm...
SKEETER
Hey! Eight-year old! We don't take kindly to your types in here.
BARKEEP
Now, calm down, Skeeter. They ain't hurtin' nobody.
SKEETER
No! [approaches Stan] I wanna know som'in' from Mr. I'm Eight Years Old here! How come you types are always wearin' them funny padded shirts in the winter?!
STAN
...Coats?
BARKEEP
Now, Skeeter, I don't want no trouble.
PATRON WITH HAT
[pointing at Stan] We don't take kindly to your types around here!
STAN
Dude, what the hell is going in?!
CARTMAN
Did you guys see a big panda bear in here, or not?
SKEETER
[pounds the counter] We don't take kindly to panda bears!
STAN
Well, we don't take kindly to you!
PATRON WITH HAT
[pointing at Stan] Well, we don't take kindly to folks that don't take kindly around here. [they look anew at each other, and nothing more is said among them]
BARKEEP
Kids, there was a panda bear in here. He said somethin' about the Island of Misfit Mascots.
CARTMAN
Where's that?
BARKEEP
If I'm not mistaken, it's over near the Jenkins' place.
STAN
Come on, we'd better hurry. [the boys make their way past the men and leave]
SKEETER
Whoa! Lookie her! [a blonde sits alone at the bar] Hey! Beautiful woman! [she sips a beer and lowers the bottle] We don't take kindly to your types around here!
BARKEEP
Nu-how, Skeeter. She ain't hurtin' nobody.
[Courthouse, next day. Everyone vs. Everyone begins. Everyone is chattering in the audience]
JUDGE JULIE
This is Case No. 47g, Everyone vs. Everyone. [gavels, and all fall quiet] Representing the side of Everyone is Gerald Broflovski.
GERALD
Thank you, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Everyone has committed a crime here, and Everyone must pay for that crime. My client, Everyone, has been hurt by this crime and must be compensated.
[The Island Of Misfit Mascots Commune. The boys reach the front gate]
STAN
[reads] "Island Of Misfit Mascots Commune". This must be the place. [they enter]
WORM
Hello there, boys.
STAN
Whoa! Who are you?
WORM
I'm Willy, the "Don't Stare Directly Into The Sun" Worm. Now, you boys know not to stare directly into the sun, right?
BOYS
Yes.
WILLY
That can burn your retinas and make you blind. [pulls out some shades and a cane, puts on the shades, and sticks the cane out, to simulate a blind person, then puts his props away]
STAN
...Thanks a lot, dude.
PIG
[rushes up snapping two pairs of scissors around] Oink oink! Be sure to run around with scissors, says Oinky, the "Run Around With Scissors" Pig.
CARTMAN
I thought you weren't supposed to run around with scissors.
WILLY
That's why he's on the Island Of Misfit Mascots. [Oinky walks away]
STAN
Have you seen any panda bears?
WILLY
Hm...
FALCON
[shows up behind the boys] Hey, kids! I'm Jimmy, the "Don't Hold On To A Large Magnet While Someone Else Uses A Fan Nearby" Falcon!
KYLE
What??
JIMMY
Here, watch. [hands a large magnet to Kenny, then walks to a wind-generating fan and turns it on. As the blades rev up, the magnet tugs at Kenny]
KENNY
(You guys, come get this fucking magnet noooowwww!) [the magnet pulls him into the blades, and he's chopped up into bits] (Argh--!)
JIMMY
See?
STAN
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
KYLE
You bastards! [looks further on] Hey! There he is! [Peetie, the Sexual Harassment Panda, seated on a bench while a whale and an octopus are playing badminton]
PEETIE
Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda
[the boys rush up, and the whale and octopus leave]
STAN
Dude, are we glad to find you! You have to come back to South Park, quick!
PEETIE
Why?
KYLE
Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all!
PEETIE
Seems all I do now is cause trouble.
BADGER
Hello, kidsh, I'm Hoppy, the "Don't Do Stuff That Might Irritate Your Inner Ear" Badger. [a long silence follows as the boys look at Hoppy] Well, I'll leave now.
STAN
Please, Sexual Harassment Panda. People listen to you. You have to get them to stop suing each other.
PEETIE
But, I'm just a panda.
KYLE
No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume! [All mascots within hearing distance turn to see the cause of this outburst]
WILLY
[rushes over to Peetie and the boys] Heeyy, I'm a real worm, pal!!
KYLE
Okay, sorry, sorry.
CARTMAN
You're-you're a worm. That's-that's cool, that's cool.
STAN
[to Peetie] Okay, you are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a new message. A new message that people will find useful again.
PEETIE
What message?
KYLE
That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.
PEETIE
...You know? You little cubs might just be right.
WILLY
Yeah!
PEETIE
[jumps up and stands] Okay!
[Courthouse. Closing arguments begin.]
GERALD
Your honor, I'd like to make my closing arguments.
KYLE
[bursting in] Wait! [Stan, Cartman, and Peetie follow]
MR. GARRISON
Hey, it's Sexual Harassment Panda.
STAN
[faces the audience] No! He's a whole new panda now, and he's got something to say.
PEETIE
Hello, everyone. I'm Peetie, the "Don't Sue People" Panda.
JIMBO
"Don't Sue People" Panda? [the bar patrons are present]
SKEETER
[stands up] Hey! We don't take kindly to folks that don't sue people 'round here!
BARKEEP
Nuhow, Skeeter, he ain't hurtin' nobody.
PEETIE
Listen to me: when you sue somebody, it hurts everyone. You sue for money, but where do you think that money comes from? From the schools, from taxes, from the state. From you. [The courtroom is silent, listening] There's no such thing as free money. When you sue somebody, you take money away from parks and schools and charities, and put it in your own pocket. And that makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda. [reactions are seen in the faces of various people in the courtroom, even in Gerald's face.]
BEARDED MAN
I'm a sad panda, too.
MAN 1
I'm a really sad panda. I didn't know we were doing all that damage. This is all that damn lawyer's fault! [people get angry at Gerald]
MAN 2
[rises] Yeah! Let's sue the lawyer!
ALL
[rising] Yeah!
GERALD
[approaches Peetie and the boys] No! Don't you see? Th-the panda's right. Boy, what a great message he has! When you sue people, you just end up causing a lot of problems for society. Uhwell, I've really learned something today. All I could see was the millions of dollars coming to me and I didn't care about where the money came from. Well, I'm no longer doing sexual harassment lawsuits in schools! They're too vague and too easily corruptible. Thank you, Sexual Harassment Panda!
PEETIE
"Don't Sue People" Panda.
GERALD
Yeah, well, whatever, sooo let's... not... sue anyone again. Okay, come on, guys. Let's go get some ice cream!
PEETIE/BOYS
Hooray!
PEETIE
Pandas love ice cream. [Gerald, Peetie, and the boys leave the courtroom]
JUDGE JULIE
Well, seeing as we have no lawyers, I'm throwing the case out. Case dismissed! [gavels and leaves the bench]
SKEETER
[people in the audience leave] Hey! We don't take too kindly to cases being dismissed around here!
BARKEEP
[passing by] God damnit, Skeeter, shut the hell up.
[Public Service Announcement]
PEETIE
Hello, cubs. I'm "Don't Sue People" Panda, with an important message for you! Lawsuits damage our society. I know it's tempting to make money, but just remember: that money has to come from somewhere. And usually, it ends up hurting a lot of innocent people. So, until next time, don't let frivolous sexual harassment lawsuits ruin our schools. Good-bye now. [walks off]
End of Sexual Harassment Panda

synopsis:While all the adults gather at Mr. Mackey's house to watch the meteor shower, Shelly Marsh babysits for Cartman and invites her much-older boyfriend over. Cartman's cat is in heat.

script:Cat Orgy

[The Cartman house, night. Cartman's room. Cartman plays off-camera while his plush lizard, Rumpertumskin, sits on the bed. Cartman does all the voices...]
RUMPERTUMSKIN
[as Loveless] Heheheheh! Now I will kill the President and Salma Hayek!
POLLY
[as Salma Hayek, tied to a cross standing in for railroad tracks] Oh, save me! Who will save me?
CARTMAN
[in cowboy gear, and six-shooter] I will! James West, cowboy and rap star! [whips out Clyde from behind his back] Quick, Artemus Clyde Frog! We've got to save Salma Hayek!
CLYDE FROG
[as Artemus] If we save her, I am going to take off her pants and play Slip'N'Slide!
CARTMAN
Are you okay, Salma Hayek?
POLLY
Yes, but I need to get out of here and eat some tacos and burritos. Me gusta tacos mucho!
RUMPERTUMSKIN
You cannot stop me, James West!
CARTMAN
Look out, Artemus Clyde Frog! It's a giant metal spider! [tosses Clyde aside, aims at a plush spider hanging on the edge of his toy box and fires] Bang! Bangbang! [strafes and performs a cartwheel] Yoyoyo, jiggity jiggy with it! Bang bang bang! [tosses a baseball at the spider and knocks it out of the box] We saved the day! The Wild Wild West, The Wild Wild Wild West. Uhyo wicky wicky scratch, Uh wicky wicky scratch... [the door opens]
LIANE
[nicely dressed, looks in] Eric. [he turns around and drops his shades and the gun] The babysitter's here. Come on downstairs.
CARTMAN
[begging] But mmmooom, I'm playing Wild Wild West.
LIANE
I have to leave soon, Eric.
CARTMAN
But mom, me and Artemus Clyde Frog still have to do our love scene with Salma Ha-yek.
LIANE
Come down as soon as you're done. [exits and closes the door]
CARTMAN
[begins to rap]
Well, I'm a badass cowboy living in a cowboy's
Age wicky wicky scratch yo yo bang bang
Me and Artemus Clyde Frog go save
Salma Hayek from the big metal spider
Wicky wicky wick, wicky wicky wick, Fresh
Cowboy from the Westside-
[The kitchen. Liane fixes herself as Shelly looks on]
LIANE
Thank you so much for babysitting little Eric, Shelly.
SHELLY
Okay.
LIANE
All those other babysitters won't come back.
SHELLY
I charge $5 for the first hour, 5% bumps every hour after that up to six hours, which enters into golden time.
LIANE
Oh, that sounds fine. I'm going to a meteor shower party. The number where I'll be is on the refrigerator. Eric's nookie time is 9 o'clock sharp. If his little woogums get cold, you can turn up the heat over here. And if he gets cranky, just play tummy-rub-rubs with him, and make sure he wipes good after he makes bears.
SHELLY
Bears?
LIANE
Oh! And don't mind the cat. She's just being loud because she's in heat.
[The living room. Cartman is on the sofa watching TV now, and Kitty is near him]
KITTY
Meowrowr!
CARTMAN
No, Kitty! I don't have anything!
KITTY
[starts rubbing her ass against the sofa] Meow rowrrowrrowrrowrrowr!
CARTMAN
What the hell is wrong with you?! Stop it, Kitty!
KITTY
[looks at him with her ass up in the air] Rowrrowrrowrrowrrowr!
CARTMAN
No Kitty, that a bad God-damned kitty! [Kitty runs away]
LIANE
[enters with Shelly] Okay, muffin. Mommy's leaving now. You do what the babysitter tells you, okay?
CARTMAN
[absently] Uh-huh.
LIANE
Be good.
CARTMAN
[huffs] Right.
LIANE
Come give Mommy Eskimo kisses! [kneels next to Cartman]
CARTMAN
Aw, Ma.
LIANE
Eskimo kisses for Mom-my!
CARTMAN
[mad] Jesus Christ. [drops to the floor, and they rub noses]
LIANE
Bye, kids. [gets up and leaves the house]
CARTMAN
[now approaches Shelly] Well, go put that pizza in the oven, bitch! I'm hungry! [she punches him into the wall, which leaves an impact site with paint fallen off] Ow!
SHELLY
Alright, turd, listen up! Now that your mom is gone, I'm in charge. I don't know how you treat your other babysitters, but when I'm babysitting, you're nothing but a little turd. You're a stinky dried-up stupid turd! Got it?!
CARTMAN
You can't hit me! Didn't you see those nanny videos on TV? [she punches him, sending him into the wall again]
SHELLY
My boyfriend is coming over, so you go to the kitchen, and you make us that pizza before I snap you in half like the little turd-stick you are!
CARTMAN
You're not allowed to have people over!
SHELLY
[takes the remote] Move! [points towards the kitchen, and Cartman eventually rises and goes there]
[The kitchen. Cartman walks to the refrigerator]
CARTMAN
This is bullcrap! [strains to open the freezer, but fails] I can't reach the freezer!
SHELLY
[from the living room] Figure it out, turd!
CARTMAN
[huffs] God dammit! [goes for a chair and props it up in front of the refrigerator. As he hops onto the chair, Kitty walks in still pining] Shut up, Kitty! [turns and sees the note on the freezer door, then grabs it and reads it] Any problems, contact Eric's Mommy at 303... Aha! [hops off the chair, moves it back to the table, and sits on it. He grabs a telephone] I'm gonna call mom and tell her that the babysitter is having her boyfriend come over! Then we'll see who's the turd! [he picks up the receiver, only to find a familiar voice on the line]
SHELLY
...So I said, "you're a little turd!" and he w-
CARTMAN
[hangs up] Dammit! [waits for a moment, then picks up the receiver again. Kitty now pines on the stove]
SHELLY
...But when you've seen one turd, you've seen them all. [hangs up, waits, then picks up again] ...stupid turd! The one night-
CARTMAN
Ey! I need to use the phone!
SHELLY
Oh. Hold on a second, Carrie. [enters the kitchen and pulls Cartman's underwear over his back and head, blinding him]
CARTMAN
Ey! Aaah! Uh-ow! Ah! [she leaves and he picks up the receiver again]
SHELLY
I placed his underwear over his head.
CARTMAN
[hangs up and puts his underwear back in place. Kitty resumes meowing] I'm gonna get her, Kitty! Mark my words!! [her meows are persistent] SHUT THE HELL UP, KITTY!! [Kitty screeches and dashes out of the kitchen]
[The living room. Cartman watches TV]
ANNOUNCER
And now, back to the movie of the week, Aliens.
NEWT
[to Ripley] They mostly come at night, mostly.
CARTMAN
[echoing Newt] They mostly come at night, mostly. [Shelly comes in and tosses Cartman off the sofa, then changes the channel to Friends. Cartman returns to the sofa] Ey, I was watching Aliens on TV!
SHELLY
Well, I'm watching Friends, turd! [the doorbell rings] That's my boyfriend. Go answer the door while I make sure I don't have food in my braces. [Cartman answers the door and looks at a young man in baseball cap and leather jacket]
DUDE
Hey there, is Shelly around?
CARTMAN
Who the hell are you?
DUDE
I'm the guy who's gonna put a boot up your ass if you don't tell me where Shelly is!
SHELLY
[appears at the door] Hey, Skyler.
CARTMAN
You know this guy?
SHELLY
He's my boyfriend! [Cartman studies him]
CARTMAN
Christ, he's like 50 years old!
SHELLY
He's 22! [Cartman studies him some more]
CARTMAN
Dude, that's not cool.
SHELLY
You're a turd! You're the Turdman of Alcatraz!
SKYLER
Ye Yeah-ha.
CARTMAN
Dude, when my mom finds out that my babysitters have their boyfriends over, she mostly gets really mad, mostly. [Skyler enters and pulls Cartman's underwear over Cartman's head. Shelly grins and Skyler drops him.] Yaaah. Eeyy! Ey, God dammit!
SHELLY
Turd wedgie. Come in the kitchen, Skyler. There's refreshments [giggles and takes his hand. They walk to the kitchen. As they pass the sofa, Kitty is looking at TV]
ANNOUNCER
And now, back to Wild Animal World
HOST
[a lion follows a lioness around] Here in the more arid regions of Africa, the gold-coat lions are in the throes of mating season. [Kitty watches intently as the lion overtakes the lioness. The lioness lays down] The male lion positions himself behind the female and prepares to insert his lionhood. Notice his large swollen balls. [Kitty meows loudly with excitement as the lion does his stuff] The female lion relaxes her body and says "hello" to Mr. Winky. [Kitty continues meowing. The lioness rolls over on her back] The male lion is enticed by the female's supple breasts and firm backside. [The lion moves away] Quickly and suddenly, the male is finished. Now he wants to be alone, so he kindly asks the female to leave. He promises he'll call her tomorrow. But the female doesn't leave. Nope, she's moving right in. Looks like the male lion... is screwed. [lion and lioness relax as the sun sets. Kitty is almost beside herself, rubbing her ass against the rug]
[The kitchen. Cartman cooked the pizza after all. Shelly and Skyler finish it]
SKYLER
Mmmmm. [tries to kiss her]
SHELLY
No, Skyler. Quit it.
SKYLER
Come on, babe. How long have we known each other?
SHELLY
Eight days tomorrow.
SKYLER
And I still don't get any action.
SHELLY
I don't know, Skyler. It's just kind of strange to me that you're 22 and all.
SKYLER
But I'm still in high school. I told you: I'm a very immature 22-year old.
SHELLY
Well, maybe just one kiss.
SKYLER
Mmmmm [kisses her on the lips, but Cartman intrudes]
CARTMAN
Hey, what are you doing? [Skyler pulls back quick]
SKYLER
Beat it, chubby!
SHELLY
Go on, Astroturd!
SKYLER
Mmmmm [a tongue-kiss]
CARTMAN
I'm gonna tell my mom on you.
SHELLY
Turd Rock From the Sun!
CARTMAN
Ey! You ate all the pizza!
SHELLY
We left you some crusts! [tosses some to him]
CARTMAN
That does it! I'm calling my mom right now, and bustin' your ass! [she snatches the note from him and sends him into the wall with one jab]
SHELLY
Guess again, Richard the Turd!
CARTMAN
Give me that phone number!
SKYLER
Come on, babe. Let's go to the living room. [they leave]
CARTMAN
[rises] I am not gonna be bossed around by a chick! [thinks for a moment] Maybe I'll just use my Wild Wild West techniques and get proof that Shelly had a boyfriend over.
KITTY
[walks in] Meow.
CARTMAN
God dammit, Kitty, you have to calm down! Here, I'll get you some catnip. [goes to the sink, opens the doors, and starts looking]
KITTY
Meow.
CARTMAN
Okay, okay, hold on, I'm finding the catnip. [pulls out a box of Playful Pussy Catnip and pours some onto the floor in front of Kitty]
KITTY
Meowrowrowrowrowrowrowrowr. [still longing for consummation, she jumps all over the kitchen knocking things over]
[The living room. Skyler strums on the guitar as Shelly listens]
SKYLER
Red Rocket spills my icy soul.

Demons from Hell seek the chosen one!
SHELLY
You're such an amazing poet, Skyler.
SKYLER
[putting the guitar aside] Isn't this guitar awesome? It's the best of its kind, and not a scratch on it. [reaches over to kiss Shelly]
SHELLY
[holding him off] Skyler, not here.
SKYLER
I can't help it. I see your pretty lips and I want to kiss them. [draws her close]
SHELLY
[giggles] Really?
SKYLER
I cherish you, almost as much as I cherish my guitar.
SHELLY
Wow!
SKYLER
When I make it to the big time, I'm gonna take you shopping, and buy you lots of badass stuff.
SHELLY
O Skyler, I love you. [their lips lock]
SKYLER
Mmmmm. [A flash bulb goes off and Shelly stands up on the sofa]
SHELLY
What the-?
CARTMAN
[with Polaroid camera in hand and a fresh picture] Aha, charade you are! Looks like you're the turd now!
SHELLY
[lunges after Cartman] Give me that picture!
CARTMAN
Aaaaa! [runs away, and she gives chase. He runs up the stairs, but she catches up and grabs him by the foot halfway up the stairs. He kicks her off, then hurries to his room, closing the door on her as she reaches him] Yes!
SHELLY
Open this door, Turdledove!
CARTMAN
I think not! I'm gonna show this picture to my mom when she gets home!
SHELLY
Your mom doesn't get home for three more hours! That's plenty of time for me to make a turd sandwich out of you. [Cartman is shocked at the possibility]
[later that night]
SHELLY
[banging on Cartman's door] Give me that picture, turd!
CARTMAN
You're never gonna get this picture! Not until my mom comes home and I can prove you had a boyfriend over heuh!
SHELLY
[in the hallway] I'm gonna bust this door down! [starts banging on the door again. Kitty is meowing]
CARTMAN
[sees his toy frog on the bed and walks over] What should we do, Artemus Clyde Frog? [dons his cowboy hat]
CLYDE
[with his Wild Wild West shades on] We've got to get that picture to your mom so that she will come home and save us.
CARTMAN
Oh, that's quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog. [doffs his hat and sees Kitty on his dresser rubbing her ass on the wall. He walks over] Listen very carefully, Mr. Kitty. I am putting this picture of the babysitter and her boyfriend on your collar. [the banging subsides] You have to take this picture to Mommy, Kitty, so that she can come home and save me. [walks to the window and sets Kitty on the sill] Now run, Kitty. Take this picture to Mommy, and lead her back here. When you return, be sure to bring Mom in through the back door. Hurry, Kitty! You're my only hope! [Kitty jumps from the window to the garage roof, then from the roof to the trashcan, then to the ground] That's it! That's it, Mr. Kitty! [Kitty ends up at the front door]
KITTY
Meow. Meow. [the door opens and Shelly takes her in]
CARTMAN
Oh! God dammit!
[The living room. Shelly takes the picture and the door bell rings]
SHELLY
Who is that?!
SKYLER
Oh, I invited the guys in the band over, so that we can practice. [moves to answer the door]
SHELLY
Skyler, your band can't practice here.
SKYLER
Hey, do you want me to make it or not?! Don't stand between me and my dreams, babe! [opens the door and the bandmates come in] 'Sup Mark? [carrying drums] 'Sup up. Jonesy? [carrying other drums]
SHELLY
Just keep the volume down! I have to go deal with Turdboy. [walks away]
[Cartman's room. Shelly knocks on the door]
CARTMAN
Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?!
SHELLY
[faking concern] Hey Eric! Your mom's been in an accident!
CARTMAN
[wary] You just want me to open the door!
SHELLY
We need to run over to the hospital and identify her body! We'll be right back.
CARTMAN
What?? Ih- is she okay?
SHELLY
Not really. She's dead.
CARTMAN
Huh?! [quickly opens the door]
SHELLY
[enters] Haha! That was a turd trick. Your mom isn't really dead!
CARTMAN
Aha! I knew it was a turd trick, and I opened the door because Mr. Kitty is on his way right now to my mom's party with the picture!
SHELLY
HAha! I knew you sent the cat, and that's why I went outside and got him!
CARTMAN
Haaha! I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it!
SHELLY
[walks to a dresser] You mean this one? [hold out the letter she finds]
CARTMAN
O-kay! Let's see heuh. Haha! Um... Aw, dammit! [he turns away defeated, and she gives him another wedgie over the head] AAAAH! [she pulls him downstairs by his underpants and enters the living room. Cartman groans at every step he hits]
[living room. Shelly drags Cartman past the band and hurls him onto the coatrack]
SKYLER
Okay, check check, check, 1, 2, check. Okay, ready? All right, let's try the new song. This is a song I wrote for you, Shelly. [points at her and winks. She sits on the sofa, happy]
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4
When I saw her walking down the street, I thought she was Shelly, Shelly.
[she dances in place on the sofa]
CARTMAN
Aw, man, you guys suck.
SKYLER
Now that we're together I'm absolutely sure that she's Shelly, Shelly.
CARTMAN
You're the crappiest band I have ever heard!
SKYLER
Move into my mom's house with me, Shelly Shelly
[Outside. Kitty is at Cartman's window once again. The band is heard in the background]
KITTY
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
A CAT
[from a red house nearby] Meow. [Kitty looks to see where the meow coming from] Meow.
KITTY
[urgently] Meow?
A CAT
Meow. [Kitty looks to make sure there's no one around, then jumps onto a car parked on the driveway and runs away. A red van is parked on the street]
[Living room. Skyler's band continues playing]
SKYLER
Bridge!
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States
of Shelly
Shelly!
CARTMAN
[rocks back and forth on his hook, hands to ears] Oh my God, somebody shoot me in the head!
SKYLER
Ey, shut up, tubby!
CARTMAN
Don't call me fat! Now, you guys are not supposed to be in heuh! [Shelly walks to the coatrack] You get out now and respect my authoritah! [she pulls Cartman down a bit so the coatrack can act like a slingshot. She lets go and Cartman hits the ceiling] Ow! [lands on his feet as Shelly turns to walk away. She stops to watch the band and he picks her pocket to get his mom's note.]
[Night. Kitty wanders the streets of South Park]
KITTY
Meow?
A CAT
Meow.
KITTY
Meow?
A CAT
Meow. [Kitty is near the source, but keeps looking]
KITTY
Meow? [enters a small passageway between two buildings]
A CAT
Meow.
KITTY
Meow?
A CAT
Meow. Meow. Meow. [an obese orange cat on his back rolls over and inches over to Kitty. Kitty looks at the camera]
[Cartman's house, living room. The band finishes up]
SKYLER
Yah, dude, that was hot. This guitar rocks, man! It rocks! What do you think, Shelly?
SHELLY
Honestly? I think you guys need some work.
MARK
Oh, really?!
SHELLY
I just think your sound is kind of... last week.
JONESY
Oh, I'd like to see you do any better, bitch!
SHELLY
Well, I do have a song I wrote.
SKYLER
O-kay, why don't you sing it for us?
SHELLY
Nnno, Skyler, I'm embarrassed!
SKYLER
Hey man, don't be shy.
SHELLY
Uhwwell, okay. [hops off the sofa] I'll try. But I'm not promising anything. [Skyler moves to the keyboard as Shelly hands out her music and takes the mic]
1, 2, 3, 4
So much pain in the world today.
Too many turds are headin' my way.
But we can flush our turds together.
Passing by turds whenever.
SKYLER
Don't you know? Isn't...
SHELLY
Life so full of happiness?
Feel free to mark my words.
But me and you, will my love do
in a world that's full of turds? TURDS!
llama judgin finger-lovin' turds. TURDS!
[Cartman's room. He's taken the phone upstairs with him, extension and all, and he's called Liane]
CARTMAN
Mom! The babysitter has her boyfriend over!
LIANE
No no no, that's impossible, hon. I told her: no visitors.
CARTMAN
Well, there's a whole crappy band here! ["TURDS! Llama judgin' finger-lovin' turds. TURDS!"] Can you hear them? Here. Can you hear them? [directs the receiver towards the music]
LIANE
This party is very loud, boopy-kins. You'll have to speak up.
CARTMAN
["TURDS! Llama judgin' finger-lovin'..."] Dammit! Her boyfriend's here! Don't you believe me?!
LIANE
Not really, hon. [Mr. Mackey appears behind her] Mom has to go now! I'll be home in about an hour! [Cartman just looks at the receiver] Oh! Oh, Mr. Mackey!
MR. MACKEY
Mhm, mkay? [upset, Cartman hangs up]
CARTMAN
I'll never be able to prove that son of a bitch was here! [looks at his Mr. Microphone-type radio] My Speak and Record bear. Of course.
[Downstairs, Shelly continues her song]
SHELLY
In a world that's full of turds. TURDS!
MARK
[tiring of the song] Dude, this is gay!
SKYLER
Shut up! [Shelly stares at Mark]
MARK
You shut up! Your girlfriend is not joining our band!
JONESY
Yeah, dude. What the hell is wrong with you, anyway? She's like, 12.
SKYLER
You guys, get out! Don't question my love! My love is as pure as morning snow! Get out, I said! [his mates take their instruments and leave]
[The passageway. Kitty and the fat orange cat face each other]
KITTY
Rowr! [quickly shows her ass to the orange cat, waiting for his move. The orange cat pounces on her and smothers her] (Rowrowrowrowr!) [she squeezes her way out from under him]
ORANGE CAT
Rowr!
KITTY
Rowr. [this time, she rolls on her back. He jumps on her and smothers her again] Hrowr!
ORANGE CAT
Geuugh. [Kitty makes her way out again]
KITTY
[angrily] Meowr! [the obese cat simply collapses and sleeps] Meowuh! [seeing that the cat won't move, she leaves] Oh meah!
[Cartman's room. He begins recording]
CARTMAN
[softly] Testing, testing, 1 2. [stops and rewinds, then plays the tape. The recording worked] Sweet. [Shelly enters and Cartman hides his radio]
SHELLY
We're going outside to watch a meteor shower! I'm locking you in your room 'til we get back in, turd!
CARTMAN
Okay. See you in a while.
SHELLY
Wha-?
CARTMAN
Will you tell me what they look like? The meteor shower. They mostly come every few years, mostly.
SHELLY
What the hell is wrong with you?! How come you're not yelling and whining?!
CARTMAN
Well, I just, I kind of like having you around.
SHELLY
What?! No you don't!
CARTMAN
No. Um seriously. See, I never had a brother or a sister. I think people that have a brother or a sister don't realize how lucky they are. Sure, they fight a lot, but you know there's always somebody there, somebody that's family. [Shelly's face softens] I wonder if, well, maybe sometimes, I could pretend like you're my big sister. And you could kind of, watch over me. You know, like, we could watch a meteor shower together sometime. Heh, and I could pretend I'm somebody's brother, if only for a day.
SHELLY
...Oh, all right, get your turd coat. You can come see the meteor shower with us.
CARTMAN
Yuh, you mean it?
SHELLY
But don't bug me and Skyler! Come on!
CARTMAN
Hooray! [Shelly exits, Cartman speaks softly] Yes. I'm gonna have your and your boyfriend's voices on my Speak and Record bear, and then you'll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly.
[The Cartman backyard. Skyler and Shelly sit on a bench, Cartman stands off to the side in front of them]
CARTMAN
[recording] Yes, yes, what a beautiful night! It is Saturday the 12th at 10:45, and my mother is away at a party right now.
SHELLY
Shut up, turd!
CARTMAN
That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is twelve.
SHELLY
What are you doing?
CARTMAN
I'm just thinking out loud. [walks over to the bench and sits with his back to Skyler] Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelly's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh?
SHELLY
Go away, turd!
CARTMAN
I'm sorry. Did you say something, Skyler? [Skyler simply bumps him off the bench] Agh!
[South Park. Kitty walks around looking for some action]
KITTY
Meow [a bunch of other cats answer her call. They are all sitting by some steps. She walks over, sticks her ass in the air, and the other cats jump her]
[The Cartman backyard. Meteors flash across the sky. Skyler tries to kiss Shelly. Cartman stands close to the house with his Speak and Record bear in full view]
SKYLER
Yeah! Come on! Give it up!
SHELLY
No.
SKYLER
Give it up, babe!
SHELLY
NO!
SKYLER
Come on, babih!
SHELLY
[pushes him off] No, Skyler, I'm not putting out for you!
SKYLER
Why the hell not?!
SHELLY
'Cause I'm twelve! [Cartman moves up a bit]
SKYLER
You're not putting out for me?
SHELLY
No!
SKYLER
Well then, screw you, bitch! I've got plenty of other girlfriends that will!
SHELLY
What?? But I thought you liked me.
SKYLER
If you're not puttin' out, then I'm movin' on! There's plenty of chicks like you out there! [she looks forsaken, Cartman draws closer] Screw you, prude bitch! Me and my badass guitar are going home! Hasta!
CARTMAN
Gotcha! [Skyler drives away in the red van]
[The living room. Shelly sits on the sofa crying, her face buried in her hands. Cartman comes dancing in]
CARTMAN
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh wicky wicky Wild West!
Shelly, guess who's busted! [Shelly continues crying] Hey! I said, guess who's busted! [Shelly doesn't seem to realize he's there] Eh, you're not gonna trick me, I've got the goods on you!
SHELLY
[between tears] I don't care. [cries some more, then pours out her emotions] He acted like he really liked me. Nobody's ever liked me before. [now Cartman softens] I can't believe I trusted him. I'm so stupid.
CARTMAN
Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway?
SHELLY
Nobody my age would go out with me 'cause I'm too ugly.
CARTMAN
You're not ugly.
SHELLY
You don't think so?
CARTMAN
Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls?
SHELLY
You're right! He is a scumbag! I wish I could get him back! I just don't know how.
CARTMAN
Weh-hull, I could ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know.
SHELLY
Huh?
CARTMAN
If you want, I could help you.
SHELLY
Really? You would do that?
CARTMAN
Just let me get my cowboy hat.
[Outside. Kitty returns to the house, opens the front door, and enters]
KITTY
Mreow? Mreow? Mreow! [the other cats come in and make themselves at home. Kitty turns on the stereo and music blares from the speakers. More cats come]
[Skyler's pad. He sits on his sofa strumming his guitar. He hears a knock on the door. He gets up, opens it, and looks down. Clyde is there]
SKYLER
What the hell is this?!
POLLY
Help me! Help me! This is Salma Hayek. Is anybody there? [she lies next to the bear, which is playing the voices]
SKYLER
Salma Hayek? Whoa, she's hot. [goes into the woods to find her]
CARTMAN
[dressed as James West, reaches the open door] Okay, it's clear. [Stands watch as Shelly makes her way inside]
[The woods.]
POLLY
Over here! Please, come quick! [Skyler moves towards the voice]
[Skyler's pad. Cartman stands watch as Shelly gets to work]
CARTMAN
We don't have much time!
SHELLY
This won't take me long!
[The Cartman house. The front door remains wide open as music blares from inside. Cats are all over the living room. Kitty bring a box of Playful Pussy catnip from outside and pours out the catnip. The other cats rush towards it and divide amongst themselves. One cat makes lines of it so he can snort it, another snacks on a slice of pizza. Others sip from beer bottles. Some cats come towards Kitty and she shows her ass again.]
[Skyler's pad. Cartman grows impatient]
CARTMAN
Hurry up in there!
SHELLY
I'm almost done.
[The woods. Skyler is looking...]
SKYLER
Hello-o? Hello-o, Mrs. Hayek?
POLLY
Over here! Please help me! I am lost and I have no clothes!
SKYLER
[to himself] No clothes, right.
[Skyler's pad. Shelly finishes up]
[The woods. The search continues...]
POLLY
I'm over here! Please help me! I will reward you greatly!
SKYLER
Right here, Miss Hayek!
POLLY
Oh, please help me!
SKYLER
What the? [sees the Speak and Record bear and Polly Prissy Pants on the ground]
POLLY
Please help me! I will give you tacos!
SKYLER
Dude, somebody tricked me! I'll make you pay for making me come out here, God dammit! [rushes home and enters] Stupid asshole stuffed animals trying to ruin my night! [gasps loudly. His guitar is in pieces and buried in kitty litter. Shards of wood are arranged to read "King Turd" in front of the neck of the guitar] My guitar! NOOOOO!
[The Cartman house. Shelly and Cartman return home]
CARTMAN
That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face!
SHELLY
[faces him at the door] Thanks for all your help, Eric. You know, as far as turds go, you're okay. [opens the door, and they both are shocked at what they see]
CARTMAN
Oh my God! [the orgy is well under way]
SHELLY
They're having a cat orgy!
CARTMAN
You are all very bad kitties! That is a bad, bad kitty!
SHELLY
Your mom's gonna get home soon. We're gonna get busted!
CARTMAN
[gets the catnip and holds it up high] Come on, kitties. Outside. Come on. [points the way out, then goes towards the door. The cats follow] That's it. Come on, come on. [opens the door, only to find Skyler waiting for him] Uh oh.
SKYLER
You two ruined my career! I'm gonna get you! [Cartman throws the catnip at him and scores] Umph! [the cats jump on him] Ogh! Oh! Owey! Owwey! Duewy! Oh! [horror and then glee appear on the faces of Cartman and Shelly] Oh, you ripped my pants off! Oh my God! Oohh my Goodd!
SHELLY
Come on! We've got to get the house clean before your mom gets home. [they go back inside and close the door] You know, Eric. It's kind of cool that two people who hated each other can be friends.
CARTMAN
Yeah. I think we get along okay.
LIANE
[enters] Hi, kids. I'm home.
CARTMAN
Heh. [all are afraid. Two cats hide behind Kitty] Mom! Uh I can explain. It was all Shelly's fault! She didn't watch the cat!
SHELLY
No! It's Eric's fault. He let those cats in here.
LIANE
[holds on to the doorway] Oh, what a party that was! [walks towards the sofa] Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. [Crashes onto it and falls asleep]
SHELLY
Wow, she passed out.
CARTMAN
Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush.
SHELLY
Well, let's clean up the house. Looks like everything turned out o-kay.
CARTMAN
That's how it goes in the Wild Wild West. [raps once more]
CARTMAN
[Shelly watches him perform and grins, then joins him in the dance]
Well, I'm a badass cowboy living in a cowboy's
Age, wicky wicky scratch yo yo bang bang
[End credits roll]
Me and Artemus Clyde Frog go save
Salma Hayek from the big metal spider
Wicky wicky wick, wicky wicky wick, Fresh
Cowboy from the Westside. Wicky wicky scratch yo yo bang bang
Me and Artemus Clyde Frog go save
Salma Frog Polly Prissy Pants go down to...
Well... mm-Rumpertumskin.
End of Cat Orgy

synopsis:Stan is dragged to Mr. Mackey's meteor shower party and sent down into the basement to play with Pip, Butters and Dougie. Randy and Gerald share an intimate moment in a hot tub.

script:Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub

[The Marsh car, night, Randy's driving. He and Sharon take Stan along with them. It seems Shelly has already been dropped off at Cartman's house to babysit him.]
STAN
I don't want to go to this stupid party!
RANDY
Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time.
STAN
No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels.
RANDY
Well, your mom and I don't get out much, so you'll just have to bear through it.
[The Mackey house. The Marshes arrive. Four other cars are there, one of them double-parked. The house is festooned with stars of various sizes, with two shooting stars among them. A banner reads, "METEOR SHOWER PARTY" while a sign on the door reads "WELCOME SKYWATCHERS." The Marshes reach the door and Randy rings the bell. Mr. Mackey answers.]
MR. MACKEY
Hello! Welcome, hmkay? This is already a wild party, hm.
RANDY
Yeah, well uh, sorry we had to bring the kid along. We had nowhere else to put him.
MR. MACKEY
Oh, that's okay. I've got a special kids' room down in the basement.
STAN
Awww!
MR. MACKEY
[leads the family across the room] Be sure to help yourselves to the crab soufflé, and uh, eh, Juanita? [clap clap] Juanita? [clap clap] We need some more finger sandwiches? [she scurries by]
[The basement. Mr. Mackey leads the family down the steps.]
STAN
I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody
RANDY
Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time.
MR. MACKEY
[opens a door] Here you go, it's right in here. [Stan enters and gasps. Before him are Pip, Butters, and Dougie.]
RANDY
We'll be upstairs if you need anything, Stan.
STAN
[soft but urgent, tugging at Randy's pants] Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins!
SHARON
You have fun, Stanley.
STAN
[soft but urgent, tugging at Sharon's dress] No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school!
MR. MACKEY
We'll come get you kids when the meteor shower starts. [closes the door. Stan looks at it with hands in pockets, then he looks at the other kids. Pip, Butters, and Dougie smile at him. Stan tries to open the door, but it's locked. He turns to face his peers.]
PIP
Cheerio, Stan. I do say it's quite a nice surprise seeing you here.
STAN
Shut up, Pip.
BUTTERS
Hey, Stan. Why I-I-I sure am glad you're here, 'cause then we'll have even more fun than we, why, than we was havin' before. Why, we wuh, we were havin' an awfully good time before you showed up, too, however.
STAN
Butters, is there any way out of here?
BUTTERS
Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room. [motions to the little boy to his left] Uh, this here is Dougie. He's not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he's in first grade, I think.
DOUGIE
I like math.
STAN
Oh my God.
PIP
We were just playing a game called Wickershams and Ducklers. Do you want to play?
STAN
No.
PIP
I'm the head Wickerknicker. And you are all little Wickershams [Butters bows] We all sing the merry tune of Stratford until I yell, "Turrah!" and then you all fall down laughing, and I join you, as I find it funny too. Stan, would you be the Wickersham of Brumble Briar? [Stan just looks at them] And all right, here we go. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la.
ALL THREE
Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la. [Stan tries opening the door again]
[Upstairs. The party is well under way. Mr. Garrison walks up to Mr. Mackey]
MR. GARRISON
[quite drunk] Great party, Mr. Mackey. Mr. Hat just grabbed Principal Victoria's ass. [his right hand jerks to the right, pulling him] No! Mr. Hat, you get back here! [walks away. The Marshes and the Broflovskis stand in front of the punch bowl]
MR. MACKEY
Anyone for some meteor mai tai punch? It packs quite a wallop.
SHARON
Oh, I'll pass. I don't drink hard alcohol.
MR. MACKEY
[offers the drink] Come on! Loosen up! Meteor showers only come once in a great while. [Sharon takes it]
RANDY
One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little.
SHARON
Well, it is kind of a special night. I guess I could... experiment. [she takes a sip]
RANDY
Yeah, experiment.
[The basement. Pip, Butters, and Dougie continue with Wickershams and Ducklers. Stan sits on the floor with his back to them, arms wrapping his knees]
ALL THREE
[dancing] Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la.
PIP
[all turn 'round] Wickersham tally-ho ugh. [all fall on their backs. Pip gets up] Are you sure you don't want to play, Stanley?
STAN
[looks back] Yes.
DOUGIE
What are you? A sourpuss?
BUTTERS
Uhuh, you uh really oughta play, Stan. It's an awfully fun game. Ah I've never been to England, but uh I'll bet the people there are really nice. [Pip walks off] Are people nice in England, Pip? I bet they are, huh? [annoyed, Stan covers his ears] They got those thick noses and all.
PIP
[looks in a box] Hey, look at this!
BUTTERS
Uh what is it? Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be. [he and Dougie reach the box and look in]
PIP
[leafing around] It's a box filled with ladies' clothes.
DOUGIE
[pulls out a padded bra and checks it out] Neato.
BUTTERS
Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels.
STAN
[incredulous] Oh, dude, you've gotta be kidding me.
PIP
[hopping] Yes, let's! Can I be Jaclyn Smith? Can I?
BUTTERS
No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it.
PIP
[twirls with joy] Oh, this sounds as much fun as Wickershams and Ducklers! Come on, Angels. Let's get dressed. [walks over to Stan] Which ladies' garments would you like, Stan?
STAN
Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!
PIP
Well. [turns and walks away] Alrighty then.
[The backyard. A hot tub sits just behind the house. Mr. Mackey leads the Marshes and Broflovskis to it]
MR. MACKEY
Here it is. I just had the hot tub put in last week.
GERALD
Wow, neat!
SHEILA
It looks quite inviting.
MR. MACKEY
Yeah, you can get a lot of action when you have a hot tub.
SHARON
Oh Mr. Mackey, you nut.
RANDY
Hell, we should get in.
GERALD
Yeah.
MR. MACKEY
Sure, go ahead. It's a-it's a party, isn't it? Mkahy?
SHARON
Oh, I'm not hot-tubbing. I have nothing to wear.
MR. MACKEY
Hm huheh, that's okay. [giggles]
SHEILA
No hot tub for me!
GERALD
Well, screw you guys! [disrobes and jumps in]
RANDY
I'm getting in for a while, too. [disrobes and jumps in] Geronimo!
SHARON
Oh, look at our boys, Sheila. [Randy and Gerald splash each other] It's just like they're in college again.
[The basement. The Angels are dressed and ready for action, but...]
PIP
Okay, Angels, what's our mission this week?
BUTTERS
Well, I don't know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, little first-grade kid?
DOUGIE
How should I know?
PIP
Oh, dear. We're Charlie's Angels, but we don't have a mission.
BUTTERS
Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley. [strokes his chin. All three look around, but the silence alerts Stan]
STAN
[looks back displeased] What?
PIP
Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but would you mind terribly being Bosley for us?
STAN
[grudgingly] What do I have to do?
BUTTERS
Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it.
STAN
Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast.
PIP
Oh, that's a splendid mission!
BUTTERS
Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels! [they go in different directions, but Dougie pauses]
DOUGIE
Which Angel am I again?
[The hot tub. Gerald and Randy relax in its bubbling warmth]
RANDY
Oh boy, it's nice to have a night out without the kids, huh?
GERALD
Yeah, I know what you mean.
RANDY
I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things.
GERALD
Well, that's what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar. [brushes it under his nose and sniffs it] Only 'cause I've never smoked before. [picks up a lighter and lights the cigar, then sets the lighter back]
RANDY
Good idea.
GERALD
What haven't you tried that you've always wanted to try?
RANDY
Hohn. [raises his elbows to the rim] Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll drink a few more beers and see where the party takes me.
GERALD
Yeah! ...Was that your leg?
RANDY
Huh? Oh, you mean, this?
GERALD
Yeah.
RANDY
Yeah. That, that was me.
[The basement. Pip rushes up to Stan]
PIP
Bosley! Bosley!
STAN
[in no mood for role-playing] What, Pip?
PIP
Oh no no no. My name is Sabrina Duncan. Remember? We're playing Charlie's Angels.
STAN
What the hell do you want?!
PIP
Well, we've completed our mission. Jill found a way upstairs.
STAN
You did? [rises and walks to the way]
DOUGIE
[dressed as Jill] Air shaft.
BUTTERS
Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown.
PIP
So Bosley, what's our next mission?
STAN
We're going upstairs.
BUTTERS
Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for?
STAN
Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs! [crawls into the duct]
[The hot tub]
RANDY
Hey, did you see Principal Victoria in there? She looks hot.
GERALD
She sure does. I wouldn't mind takin' that home.
RANDY
O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that.
GERALD
I wish. That's the one thing I've always thought of experimenting with. A threesome.
RANDY
[eager to know] With two girls or two guys?
GERALD
Huh, well, two girls, of course! I mean ...with another guy, you know, that'd be... [ends up staring at Randy]
RANDY
You, you never have a homosexual fantasy? Not that I have.
GERALD
You haven't?
RANDY
No, I mean... Well, they say everybody has at some point, don't they?
GERALD
Well, I never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy. You know... maybe just... I don't know... masturbate in front of another guy.
RANDY
Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it?
GERALD
NO, no, uh I don't think so.
RANDY
...Well it is a night for experimenting.
GERALD
Sure is. [both of them wait for the other to make the first move, then...]
RANDY
Okay, I'll start. [begins]
[some activity is going on out on the street. Someone is looking at the house through night-vision scopes and taking snapshots. One of those shots is of Liane talking to her son over the phone. Five ATF agents are now seen looking at the house from across the street]
ATF LEAD
This must be the place. They've got all kinds of crazy stuff going on in there.
ATF AGENT
[talks into a communicator] Code 7. We believe we have found the compound. Request immediate backup. [the ATF lead looks at the house again]
BARBRADY
[immediate indeed, appears in the lead's sights] Okay, so just what is going on here, people?
ATF LEAD
Get down! [pulls him into position along with the others]
BARBRADY
What?
ATF LEAD
It's just like we told you, officer! There's a religious cult in there that plans to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts. [resumes viewing, but is interrupted]
BARBRADY
Are you sure?
ATF LEAD
Of course we're sure! [points out the initials on his cap] We're the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms! It's our job to know what these fanatics do!
BARBRADY
So what does the ATF do when religious fanatics are gonna commit mass suicide?
ATF LEAD
Oh, don't worry! We won't let that happen! Even if it means we have to kill each and every one of them.
[Out front, later. ATF trucks and tanks roll in and more agents arrive]
ATF LEAD
What's the situation?
ATF AGENT
[coming in from reconnaissance] Apparently, we've got at least five dozen men and women in there who intend to commit suicide when the meteor shower starts.
ATF LEAD
Any luck talking to somebody in the house?
ATF AGENT
We've tried calling, but there's no answer. I think we're gonna have to move in, sir.
ATF LEAD
Alright. Johnson!
JOHNSON
[a marksman, runs up] Sir!
ATF LEAD
I'm sending you in. Watch your ass.
JOHNSON
Yes, sir! [makes his way to the front door while stopping at various points for better views. He rings the doorbell with his elbow, but doesn't wait for an answer]
[The Mackey house, living room. Johnson now looks around the living room, but no one seems to be alarmed at his presence. Mr. Mackey's face soon fills the view]
MR. MACKEY
Oh, come on in. Join the party, mkay? [Johnson, surprised, lowers his guard] Would you like a meteor mai tai?
JOHNSON
Heeey, I love mai tais! [closes the door]
[The living room, at the ventilation duct. Stan leads the others out]
PIP
We did it! Great job, Angels!
BUTTERS
So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder?
STAN
[mischief flashing across his face] Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set.
PIP
What kind of cookies do you want, Bosley?
STAN
I don't care, just hurry! [the Angels walk away]
BUTTERS
Well, hooray!
[The deck. Gerald and Randy have left the hot tub and are getting dressed. Things get awkward]
GERALD
[buttoning his jacket] So uh. Well. That was certainly... interesting.
RANDY
[tying his shoes] ...Yeah.
GERALD
Uh, you don't regret doing it now, do you?
RANDY
No no. ...Wuh what's there to regret, right? I mean..., all we did was watch each other ...masturbate. That's that's not gay or anything. We said so, right?
GERALD
Thuh that's right. It's just harmless experimenting.
RANDY
Well, let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing. [turns to go in]
GERALD
Hey. [Randy looks] Nothing changes between us, right? I mean, we're still friends.
RANDY
Um... Yeah yeah sure sure. [goes inside]
[Outside, the ATF agents are armed and ready to fire. The lead agent reviews the situation inside with his scopes]
ATF LEAD
Damn it, where is Johnson?!
ATF AGENT
No communication, sir. It doesn't look good for him.
ATF LEAD
Those bastards!
[Inside. Johnson is dancing away. A couple is about to leave the party]
MAN
Great party, Mr. Mackey. Thank you so much.
MR. MACKEY
Well, are you sure you have to leave so early?
WOMAN
We both have to be up early tomorrow, but thanks again.
MR. MACKEY
Mkay. Drive carefully, mkay? [waves them off and closes the door]
[Outside, The couple walks a few steps before two spotlights stop them in their tracks]
ATF LEAD
[On a bullhorn] Hold it right there! Whatever it is you are intending to do, do not do it! [the man shrugs] Your freaky religious cult will not succeed in its plan!
MAN
What?
ATF LEAD
Do not move, or we will be forced to shoot- [Shooting starts. The couple falls dead and the lead lowers the bullhorn] God damn it, who was that?! [most of the agents raise their hands] Did you see them move?!
AGENT 1
...I did.
AGENT 2
[next to floodlight] Yah.
AGENT 3
Yeah, they moved alright.
[Inside, several men gather around Jimbo and Randy.]
JIMBO
Well, I tell you what: we may not have Elway this year, but Brister won every game he started in last year.
BURLY MAN
Eh that's true, but Elway was the heart of the team. Who's the leader now?
BLOND MAN
I think the Jets are gonna be the team to beat this year in the AFC.
RANDY
Yeah. Hey uh, if you watch another guy masturbate, does that make you gay?
JIMBO
...What??
RANDY
Well I just... I have this buddy, uh, he, sat and watched another guy ...play with himself.
BURLY MAN
Well... Let's go kick his ass!
OTHER MEN
Yeah!
JIMBO
Where is he?!
RANDY
Oh he, he lives in, like, Florida.
BURLY MAN
Aw! [the men disperse]
GERALD
[walks up] Hey, Randy. What are you doing? [pats him on the back]
RANDY
[subdued] Nothing. Uh. I'm gonna go get some chips.
GERALD
Can I come with you?
RANDY
[softly] Okay. [rolls his eyes]
[Mackey's bedroom. Butters leads Stan inside]
BUTTERS
Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea. [Pip and Dougie are already inside, waiting] Uh I got to thinkin', "Wuh, where do people keep TV sets?" and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was.
STAN
Rad! [hops on the bed and starts switching channels]
PIP
Okay, Bosley, we got you cookies and a TV set. So what's our next mission?
STAN
There are no more missions. I have everything I want. [four shows and a commercial pass by as he channel-surfs.]
BUTTERS
Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission?
STAN
[annoyed] Just... play something else! God!
PIP
Oh dear. We've angered Bosley.
[Breaking news]
REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing in front of a house where a religious cult is planning to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts.
STAN
Whoa, cool!
DOUGIE
I wanna be a reporter someday.
REPORTER
Just moments ago, a couple emerged from the house. [footage of it is shown] According to the ATF, the couple refused to cooperate, then pulled out very big guns and started shooting everyone. The ATF had no choice but to shoot the insane couple, and now a standoff has ensued.
PIP
Oh, looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits.
REPORTER
The ATF commander tells us that he has reason to believe there may be children inside and that they are the primary concern of all. There are choppers here along with several tanks. [choppers and tanks are heard coming in] The commander is very concerned about what the mood is inside.
STAN
[as the reporter speaks] Wait a minute [hops off the bed and walks towards the window. He looks out and sees the ATF] Oh my God! [runs back to the others] Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult!
DOUGIE
Do you think someday I can be a reporter?
REPORTER
We just received a photo from the recon team of the action inside the house [Stan looking out the window just moments before] showing evidence that there are indeed innocent children trapped inside. Those sick cult fanatic bastards!
STAN:
Dude!
BUTTERS
Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we?
PIP
Yes. Come on, Angels. Looks like we have a new mission.
[The living room. Everyone is carrying on, drinking and dancing, oblivious to the commotion outside. Randy sits on the sofa, his hands to his eyes, his mind in turmoil. Gerald walks up to him]
GERALD
[sits] Randy, you're making me feel unimportant. Talk. Talk, damn you.
RANDY
I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub.
GERALD
So, so now we can't be friends?
RANDY
I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody could know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody.
GERALD
We said we'd never tell anybody?
RANDY
[now cross] Well, of course we wouldn't.
GERALD
Oh, uh I didn't realize that. [looks away ashamed]
RANDY
[sensing betrayal] Yuh... You didn't ...tell anybody, did you?
GERALD
Well, uh uh a few people, yeah.
RANDY
[hushed] What?! Why the hell would you do that?!
GERALD
You didn't say not to tell anyone.
RANDY
[hushed] Well, of course! I thought it would be implied! When you masturbate with another guy in a hot tub, you assume that nobody is gonna tell anybody! [looks around in desperation to make sure no one else is listening]
GERALD
Listen to you. You're yelling at me; you've never yelled at me before.
RANDY
AAAW!! [jumps up and hurries away]
STAN
[rushes out with the others in tow] Hey you guys! We've got a big problem! [sees everyone quite drunk. A naked man dances by with a lampshade on his head] The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them. [the adults didn't hear him]
BUTTERS
Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such?
STAN
[sees his mom waddle by] Mom, go look outside.
SHARON
[drunk, with mai tai in hand] Mommy's little boopie-kins [falls down and out]
BUTTERS
Uh let me handle this, Stan. [walks forward] Uh now l-listen up and listen good, everyone! Why, I'm awful disappointed in you drinkin' and carryin' on this way! Why you uhyou should be ashamed of yourselves! Uh if you don't get outside right now, and tell those army guys you're not religious fantastics, there's, why there's gonna be heck to pay. Uh, heck, I tell ya! [The adults laugh and his face drops]
STAN
Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves. [walks to the door. The others follow]
[Outside. The boys step out, the ATF agents reload, and the door closes. The spotlights come on and the commander takes up the bullhorn]
ATF LEAD
Lay down your weapons!
STAN
We don't have any weapons.
ATF LEAD
Go back inside and tell everyone that they are surrounded! Tell them to come out peacefully, and we will not shoot them. [Shooting starts]
BUTTERS
Whoa!
STAN
Get back inside! [opens the door and the boys hurry in]
ATF LEAD
I don't think they're gonna come out. Use the Ganz technique.
BARBRADY
What's the Ganz technique?
ATF LEAD
This is what we did in Waco. [two monster speakers are moved into place on either side of the front of the house. A technician readies the large CD player] Play really bad music really loud until it drives them nuts and makes them want to come out. [the technician presses a button and a garbled song plays] Nobody can stand this much Cher. This is her new album. If this doesn't drive them out, nothing will.
[Living room, the stereo. Mr. Mackey turns on the very same song and starts dancing to it]
MR. GARRISON
That's great music, Mr. Mackey. What is that?
MR. MACKEY
Uh this is Cher. This is her new album.
MR. GARRISON
Well, hell, turn it up.
[Living room, away from the stereo. Randy is walking around. Two men talk in the foreground]
GOATEED MAN
Yeah, well, you know what I heard? I I heard that he's gay.
OTHER MAN
Oh, is he?
RANDY
[runs up] Who?!
GOATEED MAN
Huh?
RANDY
Who who did you hear is, is gay?!
GOATEED MAN
Ricky Martin, the singer.
RANDY
Oh. [the two men walk away as Gerald approaches]
GERALD
Hey, Randy, what's up?
RANDY
[tenses up] What the hell is that supposed to mean?!
GERALD
Huh?
RANDY
Ssh-shouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now?
GERALD
Wulluh uh I just felt like talkin' to you.
RANDY
There's nothing to talk about.
GERALD
You're having regrets, aren't you?
RANDY
No, I-... I don't know.
GERALD
Hey. Talk to me.
RANDY
No!
GERALD
I thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn't change our relationship.
RANDY
Will you stop it?! I don't... I just...
GERALD
Hey, Mr. Withdrawn, you might not need to talk about it, but I sure do.
RANDY
Aaww! [rushes away] Sharon? [finds her at a table and genuflects] Sharon, cuh can we go?
SHARON
[swaying] Go?? The meteor shower hasn't even started yet.
RANDY
[his voice grows urgent] Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now.
SHARON
Randy, relax. We don't ever get to party. Now come on! Loosen up! Experiment!
RANDY
Ogh, I already did.
STAN
[rushes up with the other boys] Dad! Dad, they shot at us.
RANDY
Not now, Stanley. [gets up and walks away. Stan watches him go, then turns to Sharon]
STAN
Mom!
SHARON
Whoopee! [gets up, and the bowl of chips drops to the ground. She faints on the table. Stan looks around, not sure how he can rouse the adults to action, drunk as they are.]
BUTTERS
[panicking] Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain't gonna stop until we're all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families.
STAN
[slaps Butters across the face with a backhand and grabs him by the collar] Get a hold of yourself, man!
BUTTERS
How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways?
STAN
Come on. We have to find out what's happening. [leads the other boys to the bedroom]
[Mackey's bedroom. The boys enter and check out the news again.]
REPORTER
I'm standing now with Danny Ganz, the commander of the ATF. Commander, what is the latest?
GANZ
We have not had any cooperation with the cult inside the house. They are refusing to come out, and apparently they still plan to commit mass suicide once the meteor shower starts, which should be any moment now.
DOUGIE
See how reporters get to wear those cool jackets? That's why I wanna be a reporter.
REPORTER
So what are your plans, commander?
GANZ
Right now, our plan is to burn the house down. If we set it on fire, they'll have no choice but to come out.
BUTTERS
Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus-
STAN
Sh!
REPORTER
Setting them on fire seems a little dangerous, commander.
GANZ
It is, but we can't let them kill themselves.
STAN
We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.
PIP
But we can't. They'll just shoot at us again.
BUTTERS
Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on.
STAN
Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real. [walks off]
[Outside. The reporter continues]
REPORTER
For hours now, the ATF has tried to communicate with the religious fanatics inside this house. The meteor shower is expected to begin at any moment, and so time is running out.
[Inside, the party continues.]
MACKEY
Hoh, look. Harold's doing it again, hm huh hnmkay? [Harold is wearing a lampshade, but he's fully dressed. The camera moves to the crowd, then to the ground, where Dougie is standing with microphone in hand]
DOUGIE
This is Jill Munroe reporting live from inside the meteor shower party. [Stan is filming, Butters is cuing] As you can see, this is a perfectly normal party. Nobody is killing themselves. We tried to tell ATF people, but they shot at us. [aside] Anything else?
STAN
Tell them not to burn us down.
DOUGIE
Oh yeah. Don't burn us, please. Jill Munroe, GFN news.
PIP
Now what do we do?
STAN
[removing the tape from the camera] Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters.
DOUGIE
Hey, I'm a real reporter.
STAN
You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job. [Dougie smiles]
[Outside, Ganz is back behind the firing line with the bullhorn]
GANZ
Attention, cult people! Do not commit mass suicide! There are so many reasons not to kill yourselves! Flowers, for instance. And back rubs. [turns off the bullhorn and listens for a moment] Alright, I'm through trying to reason with them. Send in the Negotiator! [a large truck hauls a large cannon in. The barrel of the cannon reads, "NEGOTIATOR"]
REPORTER
[approaches] Excuse me, but what proof do you have that those people inside are religious fanatics?
GANZ
We know what we're doing. We did this all before in Waco.
REPORTER
Uh yes, but you totally screwed up Waco. You killed a bunch of innocent people and then tried to say they killed themselves.
GANZ
[holds out a beanie baby] Look. You see this? You see this?
REPORTER
Yes.
GANZ
You see it? You see it? Go get it. [throws it away to his left] Go get it! [the reporter soon moves in the direction of the throw] Alright, let's get ready to kick some religious fanatic ass!
[Inside. Randy is scarfing down some nachos at the snack table, and Gerald approaches him. Randy sees him and gives him the evil eye, then moves to the mai tai bowl. Gerald follows. Randy glowers at him]
GERALD
Having a good time?
RANDY
Yeah, swell! Could I just... have a few minutes alone?
GERALD
I'm not gonna let you change on me, Randy. Just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub, I won't let it change our friend-
RANDY
[irritated, interrupts] We did not share an intimate moment, okay?! That makes it sound gay! [walks away]
[Outside. The front door opens and six guests exit]
GUEST
Good night, everyone.
GANZ
Look out! [Shooting starts. Screams are heard as the guests are hit. The guests die on the spot] Ho-old your fire! Okay, hrm. [on the bullhorn] People at the door! That was a warning! Go back inside and tell the others that they now have one minute to surrender! [the Negotiator is aimed right at the front door]
[The boys are in Mr. Mackey's bedroom. From outside, the boys are seen looking out the window]
STAN
Oh no, we're out of time! [hops down and moves away. He ties some rope around Butters' middle] Are you sure you can do this, Butters?
BUTTERS
Wuh, no, I'm not sure. Uh-I'm not sure at all. Wha-what am I doin' again?
STAN
We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there. [hands him the video]
BUTTERS
Tha-at sounds awful dangerous.
STAN
Can you hit a target, Pip?
PIP
[with bow and plunger] I was archery-class esquire at Stratfordshire. [pulls back on the bow]
STAN
Hit something nice and solid now. [Pip releases the plunger, with rope attached, and it lands on the left side of Barbrady's head. Barbrady moves just a bit, then sips his coffee]
PIP
[pulls the rope taut] I think that's got it.
STAN
Nice job, Pip.
PIP
Did I do a nice job? Really?
STAN
Alright, Butters. Now it's your turn. [he and Dougie help Butters onto the window sill and hook him up to the rope]
BUTTERS
Wha-ah I don't know about this, uh. I think I'll reconsider. Yep uh I think reconsiderin' is the thing to do right now. [Dougie pushes him off] Waaah! [slides down to Barbrady and bounces off the hook] Gooh. [runs to the reporter]
STAN
He made it down. [Pip and Dougie grin]
[Outside.]
GANZ
Alright, people, prepare to fire on my command! [the agents take aim]
BUTTERS
Uhuh, Mr. Reporter, sir?
REPORTER
Huh?
BUTTERS
Uhuh wuhwe've got an eyewitness exclusive video for you, sir. [hands it to the reporter, who inspects it]
[Inside, living room. Randy stands alone in the middle of the crowd, despondent]
GERALD
[walks up] Honey?
RANDY
[hushed] God, everybody's looking at me. Everybody knows.
GERALD
Everybody doesn't know. And why are you so ashamed of me?
RANDY
What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-!
GERALD
I just want to know it meant something to you.
RANDY
It didn't mean anything to me, Gerry! [the music stops] All we did was watch each other masturbate in the hot tub! [people turn and stare. One man gasps and Sharon lifts her head from the floor]
MAN IN BRIEFS
Aw, I was just in the hot tub. [a man next to him pulls away]
RANDY
Yeah! Yeah, it's true! I thought it would be exciting, and maybe it was, but I can't deal with your accusing stares! [shots of various people looking at him] We watched each other jack off in the hot tub! There! We did it! I'm not proud of it, but there it is!
MACKEY
Uh. Well, it's not like you're the only guy who's ever watched another guy masturbate; I've done it.
NED
Mmm-me too. [other men begin to answer]
MAN 1
Yeah, uh I've done it a few times.
MAN 2
Yep.
MAN 3
Yup.
MAN 4
Uh huh.
MAN 5
Me too.
MAN 6
Myeup, me too.
MAN 7
Yup.
JIMBO
Aw, hell, uh I've done it too. With Cameron here. [points to the burly man who spoke earlier]
MACKEY
[music resumes] Uh, Juanita, could you fix some more dip, please, Juanita? [she goes to do it, and conversation resumes among the guests]
RANDY
You mean it? I'm not gay?
JIMBO
[walks up] Hwell... maybe a little. But we're all a little gay.
RANDY
Oh, I feel so much better! Wow!
GERALD
So we're friends again?
RANDY
Uh, you bet we are, Gerry! I feel great! I feel like I could take on the world! Everything's gonna be okay!
[Outside. The Negotiator is rolled into placed and aimed once more]
GANZ
Alright everyone, fire!
REPORTER
[runs in front of the cannon and waves his arms] Hold on just a minute! This is Derek Smalls reporting. We have just received an exclusive video from inside the house [holds it up], proving that the people inside are not cultists after all.
GANZ
[to an agent] Uh oh. [runs to address the agents and waves his arms] Uh uh attention everyone! This has only been a test. Good job, men, on this, uh, simulation.
BLOND AGENT
Simulation?
GANZ
[to the blond] Sh. [to all] All is well. Do not shoot at [BOOM. The cannonball hits a house behind Mackey's, then bounces to crush another, then another, and yet another. Stan, Pip, and Dougie rush outside to join the reporter.]
PIP
O-hoh, I believe we've saved the day! [Butters joins them]
GANZ
Woops.
ATF AGENT
Sir, this isn't gonna look good.
GANZ
You're right. Quick, let's get out of here! [in the blink of an eye, every ATF agent and vehicle rushes away, leaving a clear road]
DEREK
Say, that was a fine piece of journalism, boys.
DOUGIE
Wow, you mean that?
DEREK
Sure. Why, with your tape, I'll be able to make millions and further my career beyond my wildest dreams. [walks away with the tape]
BUTTERS
Uhuh oh uh, uh hooray, then!
PIP
There. Angels, I must say I think we did a smashing job.
BUTTERS
Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya.
STAN
But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along.
BUTTERS
Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh?
KYLE
[shows up] Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had.
STAN
You?! You think you had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins!
KYLE
Hoh, dude, weak.
STAN
Super weak.
KYLE
Come on. I'll tell you all about what happened to me. [goes inside with Stan and Ike, leaving the Melvins outside sad.]
[Cher's mangled song plays.]
End of Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Kyle invites Kenny to join him and Ike at Jewbilee, a camp for Jewish kids, where they summon Moses. Meanwhile, an evil plot to release Haman is at hand.

script:Jewbilee

[Broflovski residence. Gerald and Sheila are with Ike at his changing table in his room.]
SHEILA
Hold still, Ike! We have to get you dressed! Where the heck is Kyle?
GERALD
I don't know. Come on, Kyle! You're gonna be late for Jew Scouts!
[Kyle looks in the bathroom mirror to make sure everything is set, and hums. Both he and Kyle have little pigtails hanging from their hair.]
SHEILA
Kyle!
KYLE
I'm coming, Ma! [the doorbell rings]
SHEILA
Go get the door, Kyle!
KYLE
[to himself, angrily] "Get ready", "answer the door", Jesus Christ, make up your friggin' mind! [exits]
[Living room. Kyle walks across to the front door and opens it]
KYLE
Oh! Hey, Kenny.
KENNY
(Kyle, I'm gonna camp and watch the meteor shower. Do you wanna come and see it with me?)
KYLE
I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee.
KENNY
(What's that?)
KYLE
It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure.
KENNY
(Oh, that's alright.)
KYLE
Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.
KENNY
(Really?) [follows Kyle to the sofa, where Kyle's parents now wait]
KYLE
Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me?
SHEILA
...Uhwell, Kyle, Jewbilee is sort of a ...special thing.
KYLE
...Oh. Kenny isn't special?
KENNY
(Aw.)
SHEILA
No, no, you're very special, Kenny. It's just that... well, Jewbilee is... for Jewish kids. [Kyle and Kenny have blank stares]
GERALD
You see boys, Jew Scouts is a special group that borrows a little bit from all different Jewish denominations. From the Orthodox Jews, from the Hasidic Jews, from the Northern Italy Cave Jews... But you have to believe the basic tenets of Judaism to be a Scout.
KYLE
Kenny'll believe whatever you want him to.
KENNY
(Yeah.)
SHEILA
Kyle, eh, the problem is...
KYLE
Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight.
GERALD
Oh, all right. Just don't let any of the elders know that he isn't Jewish, okay?
KENNY
(Woohoo!)
SHEILA
Come on, Ike! [he hops in] It's time to go to Squirts!
KENNY
(Squirts?)
SHEILA
You have to be in Squirts if you're too young to be a Jew Scout.
KENNY
(Oh.)
SHEILA
Don't worry, Kenny. I'll fill you in on our faith on the way up there. [everyone heads out the door]
[In the car. The family and Kenny drive south as a full moon rises. Sheila gives a quick overview of the Old Testament, or Tanakh]
SHEILA
And then, Kenny, Abraham's wife bore him no children. She had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said unto Abraham, "Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing. I pray thee, go into my maid."
KENNY
(Uh huh.)
SHEILA
Abraham begat Isaac, who the Lord then said to kill. But that was just a little silly trick to see if Abraham would do it.
KENNY
(Uh huh!)
IKE
Eng jeck. [takes off his cap]
KYLE
No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform!
SHEILA
Ike, you behave!
IKE
Buwor? [takes off his cap again]
KYLE
No, Ike!
IKE
Buh buh buh buh. [the cap is back on, the bandana comes off]
KYLE
I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts.
GERALD
[turns to face the boys] Ike, your brother Kyle was in Squirts, and so was I. You have to go so someday you can be a big brave Jew Scout.
IKE
No-o. [takes off the pigtails]
GERALD
Tell Ike how much fun Squirts is, Kyle.
KYLE
What? You want me to lie?
GERALD
Yeah, lie.
KYLE
Oh. Ike, Squirts is so much fun--
SHEILA
Oh my God, what is that?! [brakes hard and stop. A big brown bear is walking towards them.]
GERALD
Hey, it's a bear! [the bear turns left and walks into the woods]
KYLE
Wow, cool.
SHEILA
This retreat really is out of the way, isn't it?
[The Jew Scout camp. The sign on the entrance reads, "WELCOME TO JEWBILEE." They reach the Jew welcome station]
RANGER
Welcome to Jewbilee. You folks find it okay?
GERALD
Yeah. [the boys leave the car] Actually, we saw a bear a few miles back.
KYLE
He was huge.
RANGER
Yeah. We spotted him a few days ago. Nothing to worry about, though. Your boys are safe with us.
SHEILA
I'm sure they are.
GERALD
We'll be back to pick you up after the meteor shower party, boys.
SHEILA
Good-bye, boys. Kyle and Ike, you be safe. And Kenny?
KENNY
(Uh huh?)
SHEILA
Try and act Jewish. [drives away. Ike is properly dressed again]
KENNY
(How do you do that?)
SQUIRT LEADER
[arrives with his troop] Come on, Squirt! We're meeting over here! [motions to the place]
KYLE
[Ike hides behind him] Who are you?
SQUIRT LEADER
I'm the Squirt leader. I don't want to be the Squirt leader, but I don't have a choice; it's the only way I can earn my chutzpah badge. So I gotta spend all night instructing Squirts.
KYLE
You have to go with him, Ike.
IKE
Buh buh buh buh.
KYLE
Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building. [points to it.]
IKE
Boul ball.
SQUIRT LEADER
Come on! [drags Ike away. The Squirts leave as well, and the ranger returns]
RANGER
Name?
KYLE
Kyle Broflovski.
KENNY
(Kenny McCormick.)
RANGER
What?
KYLE
Uh, Kenny McHeinenberg.
RANGER
[writes the names] Alright, get to Meshuggeneh Hall! The meeting is already starting.
[On the way to Meshuggeneh Hall. Kenny is curious about the buildings, naturally.]
KENNY
(What's that?) [about the CHAMBER OF ELDERS]
KYLE
This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting.
[Chamber of Elders, the meeting. The Chief Elder sits on a futuristic throne, from which he can look down at the other elders]
CHIEF ELDER
Baleilah hazein, Hame kadesh mekoh hikenazu puanazikeh hakeilah. (Now gather us, the elders, on this most holy of nights.)
ELDERS
Helalelah, het Moshe. (Praise Moses.)
CHIEF ELDER
I want to welcome you all. Though we each come from a different sect of Judaism, on this night of Jewbilee, we all pray to Moses as one. Hineinih kureh leirukeshu. (May all the power of Moses show the way...) Now, let us all introduce ourselves.
ELDER 1
[with buns on his head] Elder Carn, from the Orthodox synagogue.
ELDER 2
[with mustache] Elder Harris, from the Hasidic sect.
ELDER 3
Elder Garth, from the synagogue of anti-Semites.
CHIEF ELDER
[cautiously] I don't believe I've heard of the anti-Semitic sect of Judaism before.
ELDER GARTH
We're new.
[Squirt's Lair. Stars of David are everywhere]
SQUIRT LEADER
Okay, Squirts, the elders have given us a very important task tonight. We are all going to make macaroni pictures, like this one, [pulls out a picture of the Star of David made from macaroni] using dry macaroni, paper, and glue.
SQUIRT 1
How come we have to make macaroni pictures?
SQUIRT LEADER
[angrily] Because that's what Squirts do! Now, shut your pie-hole!
SQUIRT 2
What's your name?
IKE
No.
SQUIRT 2
How come your head is lookin' so... funny-looking?
IKE
Uh-uh. [doffs the hat and pigtails and hops to the window. He sees Kyle and Kenny walk to Meshuggeneh Hall]
[Meshuggeneh Hall, the camp lodge, but inside it looks like a lecture hall. The banner outside says, "Jew Scouts Meeting Hall"]
ELDER
And that's how we'll be making tonight's craft. And so you see, Scouts, all you need is a bar of soap and a dull knife [displays them], and you can make nifty soap sculptures like these. Here's a giraffe. [displays it] And here's a cloud. [displays it] You can all pick up your bars of soap later on, as we will all be making soap sculptures tonight. [Kyle and Kenny enter and take their seats] Now, this year we are pleased to announce that Jewbilee has grown to over one hundred Jew Scouts from all around the country. All new inductees, raise your hands. [several of them raise their hands. None of them wear the Jew Scout cap yet.]
KYLE
That's you, Kenny. Raise your hand. [Kenny does so. The elder spots the new Scouts, but returns to an odd prospect]
ELDER
Uhhhh, yess, and what is your name, young man?
INDUCTEE
Junichi.
ELDER
O-oh, wonderful, uh, uh, um... [places his index finger on his lower lip] Cu-could you run out and grab some... some of those candles for us? [Junichi leaves, and the attendant locks the door immediately] There we go. Ahem. [Kyle notices the injustice that has just been done] Now, I would like all the new inductees to step forward, please. [the new Scouts leave their seats and come up]
KYLE
This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up. [Kenny moves forward]
ELDER
Raise your left hand and repeat after me: I pledge to be a Jew Scout.
INDUCTEES
I pledge to be a Jew Scout.
ELDER
My honor, wide and true.
INDUCTEES
My honor, wide and true.
ELDER
I am proud to be a Jew Scout.
INDUCTEES
I am proud to be a Jew Scout.
ELDER
Otherwise, I'd just be a Jew.
INDUCTEES
Otherwise, I'd just be a Jew.
ELDER
[brings forth a large bell] Nahit chaim.
INDUCTEE 1
Nahit chaim. [the elder lowers the bell over his head and strikes it once to produce a long, loud peal, then raises it. The boy walks off]
ELDER
Nahit chaim.
INDUCTEE 2
Nahit chaim. [the elder lowers the bell over his head, strikes it, and raises it. The boy stumbles away crying]
ELDER
Nahit chaim.
KENNY
(Nahit chaim.) [the elder lowers the bell over his head, strikes it, but Kenny ducks] (Ha! Hiheh haha.) [the elder lowers it again and strikes it several times to make sure] (Hah! Oh my God!)
[Squirt's Lair. Macaroni projects now due]
SQUIRT LEADER
Okay, Squirts, let's see what you made macaroni pictures of. Ishmael?
ISHMAEL
Apple.
SQUIRT LEADER
Good. Matthew?
MATTHEW
Cat.
SQUIRT LEADER
Joseph?
JOSEPH
Triangle.
SQUIRT LEADER
Okay. Ike?
IKE
Cokeshen.
SQUIRT LEADER
[gasps] ...You don't make a macaroni picture of the Last Supper at a Jewish camp! [growling and other noises are heard] What the geez? [outside, a bear is searching through trashcans. The leader goes to the window] Oh my God, it's that bear they've been talking about! [the bear looks back, then jumps and runs away, leaving the trashcans strewn about and trash everywhere. The leader walks out with the Squirts] Where did it go?! Squirts, go grab your gear! We're gonna hunt us a bear! Then I'll get my chutzpah badge for sure!
[Chamber of Elders. Meanwhile...]
CHIEF ELDER
Elehem hav dorim, ashoseveh laoleinu. Hakadosh boruku, omasheh hachreit. (Tonight, for the meteor shower, we will pray to Moses. Then we will give Moses thanks.)
ELDER GARTH
[losing patience] Oh, enough already. What has Moses ever done for us?
CHIEF ELDER
All sects of Judaism follow the words of Moses.
ELDER GARTH
Not mine. Tonight's meteor shower is a sign of the New Time, heh. We should use it to pray to Haman and enter into a new millennium faith, and it--
CHIEF ELDER
Enough, elder! You will not speak the name of Haman here!
ELDER GARTH
All you ever do is worship Moses, but it says in the Book of Centuries that Haman will one day lead the Jews.
ELDER HARRIS
We pray to Moses here, elder.
ELDER GARTH
If you guys love Moses so much, why don't you marry him?!
CHIEF ELDER
We accept all denominations of Judaism here at Scouts, elder, but your synagogue of anti-Semites is too strange! Get out and do not return: you are no longer welcome here!
ELDER GARTH
Fine! [goes to the door and turns] Jewbilee is the time of Haman! You will all see how wrong you are, very soon! When Haman returns from the Ninth Tower of Disillusionment, and smotes Moses and all his followers into pillars of dust that would cry for their petty lives but can't, having recently been turned into dust and all, you will see! You will see this very night! [walks out and closes the door.]
CHIEF ELDER
Hello.
[Campfire. The Jew Scouts form a ring around it and sit. Kyle and Kenny stand behind the chief elder.]
KYLE
Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle.
KENNY
(What the fuck are we doing?)
KYLE
This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee.
KENNY
(Uheheheheh, that's stupid.)
KYLE
It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!
CHIEF ELDER
Alright, Jew Scouts, the meteor shower will start soon. Let's pray to Moses for guidance. [spreads his arms out. All the Scouts close their eyes save Kenny, who looks around first, then closes them.] Moses, great leader, on this blessed night of Jewbilee, we ask for your tutelage.
SCOUTS
May the teachings of Moses fill our ears and our hearts respectively.
ALL
[the elder first, then the Scouts join him one by one] O...
ELDER GARTH
[behind a nearby tree] Stupid assholes. Moses ain't gonna teach them anything! [softens to pray] Do not fear, Haman. This night shall be yours, and the anti-Semitic Jews will once again rule the Earth.
[The Squirts and their leader march through the woods...]
SQUIRT LEADER
We are Squirts, we are Squirts; we're so kosher that it hurts
When we get older we'll be Scouts, but until then we are Squirts
[gasps. The brown bear is in front of him approaching a pile of crap] There he is, Squirts. [the bear turns up its snout, but sniffs again] Okay, Squirts. Remember the plan: immobilize and attack. Matthew, y-you immobilize the bear with the net, then Echo team, run up and attack it with your Squirt knives. [the bear sniffs some more] Don't get too close now, just close enough to throw the net on the stupid bear. [Matthew goes forward with the net. The leader and the other Squirts hide behind some bushes and watch. The leader then barks] Now! [the bear turns to see Matthew and growls, and Matthew throws the net on himself]
MATTHEW
Oh, funt. [the bear takes the net and carries Matthew away] No!
SQUIRT LEADER
Oh, no! [the bear disappears] Oh, God! [comes out of the bush with the Squirts] Oh, the bear took a Squirt. Oh, I'm gonna get it now!
[Back at the campfire, the Scouts are trying to summon Moses]
ALL
[long note] O... [the Scouts are now holding hands as they chant]
KENNY
[notices some rumbling] (What's happening now?)
KYLE
[looks at him] Shh. Shut up, Kenny. [rejoins the rest in chanting, the fire builds, and a huge techno-colored dreidel rises out of the fire. A face appears on it]
KENNY
(What the fuck is that?!)
KYLE
[stops long enough to say] That's Moses, stupid! [rejoins the rest in chanting]
CHIEF ELDER
Great Moses, we, your most loyal followers, want to thank you a lot for coming.
MOSES
The hour of Jewbilee is near. Let all debts be forgiven and all slaves freed. Mwaaaaaaaaaah!
ALL
Aaaaaaaaaah!
CHIEF ELDER
Alright Scouts, let's all show Moses our soap sculptures so that he may rejoice and be pleased. [the Scouts approach Moses one by one, offer their sculptures, and drop them off before him]
KYLE
[steps up and offers his] It's a duck. [Kenny steps up, but he's just starting on his sculpture]
[Behind the tree. Garth reads from the Book of Centuries]
ELDER GARTH
"And it was foretold that the spirit of Moses would finally rest when his spirit was imprisoned by Haman in a conch shell of blind faith." Conch shell, like this one, hnee. [produces one from his robes]
[Campfire.]
CHIEF ELDER
Moses, the Squirts have made you tidings of macaroni pictures. They should be here any second. [walks up to Elder Harris] Where the hell are the Squirts? [Elder Harris shrugs] We need those macaroni pictures for Moses right now!
[The woods. The Squirt leader is setting a trap for the bear. He places some bait on a tray swinging from a rope as the Squirts hold the rope steady from behind a bush. Then he pours some DED RAT grains onto the bait]
SQUIRT LEADER
Now, we'll just see how Mr. Bear likes rat poison. [reviews his work] Well now, that'll be enough to kill a stupid bear. Okay, raise the tray! [the Squirts start heaving] Chutzpah badge, here I come. [the bear shows up and growls] Yikes! [runs for the bushes and reaches the Squirts] Okay, here he comes. Easy now. Easy, Squirts. [the bear comes closer, sniffing] Okay, Squirt, lower the tray. [the Squirt begins to lower it] That's it. That's it, you god-damned stupid bearface! [the bear rears up and pounces on the tray, jerking the rope.]
SQUIRT
Agghhh! [the leader gasps. The Squirt is pulled into the air and lands in the tray] Ah--! [the bear carries him off] Agghhh!
SQUIRT LEADER
Jesus! Hell, he got another Squirt!
IKE
Mommy.
SQUIRT LEADER
[steps out of the bush with the Squirts] You think you can stop me from getting my chutzpah badge, you stupid bear?! Think again!
[Campfire. The Scouts now sing "Kumbaya," a spiritual]
ALL
Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya
O Lord, Kumbaya
CHIEF ELDER
Great and honorable Moses, what do you desire from us, your children?
MOSES
I desire... [the elders and the Scouts await anxiously] I desire... macaroni pictures.
CHIEF ELDER
Yeh yes, yes, the macaroni pictures are coming right away. Uh, anything else you want from us, O great leader of the people?
MOSES
I desire... popcorn necklaces.
CHIEF ELDER
You heard him. Get to making popcorn necklaces right away! [the elders and Scouts scatter] All you need is some popcorn, and a needle and thread. [Kenny finishes his sculpture, which is of himself, as the last few Scouts leave. He then offers it and leaves it on the pile]
MOSES
Hold! [Kenny stops in his tracks as Kyle looks on. Kenny looks at Moses] There is... an impurity.
GARTH
[still behind the tree] Oh no, he's on to me, Haman.
CHIEF ELDER
[the Scouts gasp and Kenny droops] An impurity, Moses?
MOSES
This child here is not kosher.
KENNY
(Uh-oh.) [Garth looks, curious. Kyle rushes to Kenny's side, and the Scouts move in on them] (Help me, Kyle! What are we gonna do?)
KYLE
Don't worry. I know what to do.
CHIEF ELDER
Scout Broflovski, have you defiled Jew Scouts by bringing a non-Hebrew to Jewbilee?! [the Scouts grow angry]
KYLE
Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish.
KENNY
(What?!) [the Elders and Scouts approach Kyle and Kenny closer]
[Campfire. Some time later...]
CHIEF ELDER
A non-Jew has infiltrated Jew Scouts and looked upon the face of Moses! He must be dealt with!
KENNY
(I'm telling you, it's Kyle you want. He's the one who tried to get me in here, and you know it.)
CHIEF ELDER
You are banished from here. You must leave before the great eating of carrot cake.
KENNY
(What?!)
KYLE
He doesn't get cake?
MOSES
No cake for the impurity.
CHIEF ELDER
Go now. You do not belong here. [points to the woods. Kenny comes out of the middle of the group and walks towards the woods. Kyle is sad for him. Kenny looks back, then faces forward and walks on]
MOSES
[spins around and around] Aaggghhh! [the others turn to see what's happening]
ELDER GARTH
[prostrated, with conch in hand] Infatu camdavid. David hakum ba'ikan shtud!
CHIEF ELDER
Elder, what are you doing?!
ELDER GARTH
[now standing with hands outstretched] Shtud balaa shtud inca inca brusht!
ELDER HARRIS
He's reading from the Book of Haman!
ELDER GARTH
Enter the conch shell, Moses! [thrusts the shell forward]
MOSES
[spins and shrinks to fit in the shell] Eo! Eh! Diu! [disappears into the shell]
ELDER GARTH
And there you shall stay, trapped for all eternity!
CHIEF ELDER
Elder, what have you done?
ELDER GARTH
I told you, the meteor shower is the time of Haman! I am running Jewbilee now!
ELDER
[from Orientation] Release Moses, now!
ELDER GARTH
[pulls out a gun] I don't think so. [all gasp]
SCOUT
When do we get to eat carrot cake?
ELDER GARTH
Now... All of you into that building, or I shoot you where you stand!
CHIEF ELDER
Elder, you cannot mean--
ELDER GARTH
Move! [drives them towards the building. Kenny peeks out from behind a tree. Garth follows the last of the Scouts to the door, closes it, and padlocks it. He descends the steps and heads for the campfire as the others look on through the window, frightened] Now! Now, Haman, your time has come!
KYLE
Dude, what the hell is going on?!
CHIEF ELDER
If he summons Haman, we will all be destroyed.
KENNY
(Oh no!)
[Woods. The Squirts still march]
SQUIRT LEADER
We are Jew Squirts, we know Jewish
Stick stick smiley smiley Stick stick smiley smiley
dur dur dur dur dur--
Hold it, Squirts! This is where we'll set our trap. Everyone remember your squadron. Alpha-5 and Gamma-7 will be on recon teams. Alpha will take left flank and flush the bear out of sector three. Once we're in position, I want constant contact between all squad leaders. We'll flush him out and we'll attack him! [the bear comes up silently and snatches another Squirt]
SQUIRT
Agh! Agghh! [the bear rushes away]
SQUIRT LEADER
[not missing a beat] Remember, this is only a bear. All we have to do is stick together, and we can spend the rest of the night making bear sandwiches! [turns and counts his troop] Where's Zigmal?
IKE
No.
SQUIRT LEADER
God-damnit! You stupid god-damned son of a bear, you've taken your last Squirt! Do you hear me?!
[Campfire. Elder Garth is kneeling before it, summoning Haman.]
ELDER GARTH
And the Ancient One looked upon Haman as the new leader of the people! [clouds roll in and the winds whip Elder Garth's hair around] And it was the night that stars flew around the sky! [the meteor shower goes by] Yes! Yess!!
CHIEF ELDER
If he summons Haman, it will be the end of everything we hold dear.
SCOUT
I wanna go home.
[The road. Kenny walks along the curb, then sees reflections of headlights in front of him. He turns to see a car coming and tries to stop it]
KENNY
(Stop!) [a red car speeds by. Kenny watches it leave, then hears more vehicles coming] (Officer Barbrady, I really need to talk to you!) [Barbrady and the ATF speed by as well] (Shit!)
[The woods. The Squirt leader takes the Squirts back to camp.]
SQUIRT LEADER
That bear thinks he can outsmart me! Well, I'm not gonna let a stupid bear get the-- [gasp] Hold! Look over there! [a figure resembling a Squirt stands alone in a clearing in front of a cliff] It's one of the Squirts the bear took. Maybe he's okay. [takes the Squirts over to the figure to make sure. They arrive, only to see a straw Squirt - straw dressed in a Squirt uniform. The Squirt leader looks at the straw Squirt long and hard before deciding] It's a trap!! [jumps out of the way as a net descends and traps the rest of the Squirts. The full net rises to a high branch; the bear comes to the edge of the cliff and carries it away] Damn! Damn, damn, damn! Okay, bear, that does it! You wanna kill all the Squirts?! You can have 'em! I give up! I don't need my chutzpah badge, or Jew Scouts, or any of this crap! Forget it!
[The campfire. The meteor shower continues]
ELDER GARTH
Let the New Tide turn! Let Haman rule his people once again!
CHIEF ELDER
No! [Kenny walks into the camp again]
ELDER GARTH
We await your return, Haman! [Kenny stops to see Elder Garth at work] Your passage is safe from the enemies!
KENNY
[the bear finds him and carries him off] (Aghh!)
[The building. The chief elder tries to burst through the door, but fails]
CHIEF ELDER
It's hopeless.
ELDER
Haman will be summoned and we will be forced to obey him, or die. [the Scouts are scared]
ELDER HARRIS
Uh I'm fine with obeying.
ELDER
Yeah, obeying should work out swell. [!]
KYLE
Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us.
ELDER 2
How?
KYLE
Kenny will find a way.
[The bear cave. The bear brings Kenny in.]
KENNY
(Haaarrrrrh!) [the bear drops him off and leaves the cave] (Huh?)
SQUIRT
Hey, welcome to the party. [Kenny studies the scene] See this li'l bear cub? It's his birthday.
SQUIRT 2
Yeah, so his mommy brought us all over to play with him.
BEAR CUB
Mrar.
KENNY
(Aww.) [the momma bear comes and licks a Squirt's face, and the Squirt laughs] (Okay, you guys, we've gotta get back to the camp and... [indistinct chatter])
SQUIRT
They are? Uh oh.
KENNY
(Come on, Squirts, we gotta run! We're already god-damned late!)
SQUIRT
Come on, Squirts. We have to help them.
ALL
Yeah! [everyone, including the cub, races out of the cave]
[The camp. The Squirt leader returns alone]
SQUIRT LEADER
Elder Schwartz, I lost the Squirts! I lost all the Squirts! [no answer] Well, screw you too! I don't need your Chutzpah badge anyway! Hello? [in the building behind him, heads rise from under the window sill]
ELDER SCHWARTZ
[the chief elder] Shlomo, get us out of here!
SHLOMO
[Squirt leader] What the geez? [turns and walked towards the hostages] What are you guys doing in there?
ELDER SCHWARTZ
Get the keys and unlock the door! [the Scouts jump up and down]
SCHLOMO
What?!
ELDER SCHWARTZ
[now points] Get the keys and unlock the door!
SCHLOMO
[doesn't understand what Schwartz is saying, but gives his own news] I lost the Squirts! [Elder Garth appears behind him]
ELDER SCHWARTZ
Look out!
SCHLOMO
Huh? [turns to face Garth]
ELDER GARTH
Don't move!
SCHLOMO
[backs up quick] Oh, Jiminy gravy, what is this??
ELDER GARTH
It's the summoning of Haman, fool! The awakening of a new kingdom, heeheh!
SCHLOMO
You can't wake Haman. What would Moses say?
ELDER GARTH
Moses is trapped for all eternity in the conch of blind faith!
SCHLOMO
[sees the shell and dives for it] Oh, no you don't! [grabs it, but Farth shoots him. The bullet grazes Schlomo's right shoulder, which he then covers with his left hand, dropping the shell] Ooowww!!
ELDER GARTH
Enough of this waste of time! [turns and goes back to the campfire. Once there, he reaches for the Book of Haman] Haman! The Great Summoning is done! Upon these words let your spirit come! Einich! Hos!
ELDER SCHWARTZ
It is lost.
ELDER GARTH
Zayak. Kareem! [Kenny comes up behind him]
KENNY
(Woohoo!) [takes off with the book]
ELDER GARTH
Hey, give that back! [chases Kenny into the woods. The Squirts line up before the window where the hostages await]
ELDER SCHWARTZ
It's the Squirts.
KYLE
Go, Ike!
ELDER SCHWARTZ
Unlock the door, Squirts! The keys are up there.
ELDER HARRIS
They'll never reach.
SQUIRT
Squirts, fall in. Chinese formation. [the Squirts hurry and climb up one on top of another to form a human pillar]
[The woods. Elder Garth catches up to Kenny]
ELDER GARTH
Give me that book! [knocks Kenny down]
KENNY
(Ow!) [gives up the book, and Garth kicks him]
ELDER GARTH
Haman will deal with you! [kicks him again]
KENNY
(Ow!)
[The camp. The Squirts have finished the pillar, with Ike at the very top. Ike gets the key and the pillar falls apart to form two rows of four Squirts each, and Ike alone at the top of the steps. He jumps up to the padlock and unlocks it. He then removes the lock. The door opens and everyone inside pours out. Elder Harris moves out into the open]
ELDER HARRIS
Oh, no. It's too late!
ELDER GARTH
Ramek shtud! [lightning strikes the ground. Nearby, the bear returns and gets the conch shell. She moves away, only to take it to Kenny, who receives it. The bear growls and leaves. Meteors continue to shower down as a black cloud with a pair of red eyes appears among the gathering clouds]
KYLE
What is that?
ELDER SCHWARTZ
It is Haman.
ELDER GARTH
Yes! Yes! [Kenny tries to break the conch shell open on a rock, then against the tree, but it doesn't break]
HAMAN
Free! Free to punish those that imprisoned me!
ELDER GARTH
[now prostrate before Haman] Haman! It's me, Garth! I freed you!
KYLE
Look! [Kenny comes into the clearing and throws the shell against the snow several times.]
KENNY
(It's okay, I'll use my head!) [faces the shell and throws his head back]
KYLE
Kenny! Noooooo!
KENNY
(Heeeeeyah! Ugh--!) [the headbutt opened the shell alright, but Kenny falls back on his side as Moses comes out of the broken shell]
HAMAN
Moses! Nooo!
ELDER GARTH
Nooo! Eheh. Nooo! [Moses rises into the sky, absorbs Haman, and reclaims his place above the campfire. Elder Garth turns to face him again] Moses. Uh I, I apologize for any inconvenience, eheh. Uh yuh you see, I was just uh--
MOSES
Die! [lightning comes out of both his eyes and nukes Garth until Garth explodes]
ELDER GARTH
No! Aaagghhh! Ooww..! [poof]
ALL
[gathering] Hooray!
KYLE
Kenny! [runs to Kenny, who now lies in a pool of blood. The others follow]
ELDER HARRIS
That blow to his head must have killed him.
ELDER CARN
He saved us. He saved all the Jews.
KYLE
You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass.
ELDER HARRIS
We've learned a lot from you and your great friend, Kenny.
MOSES
[joins them next to Kenny] Every year we shall gather here in this special place and bring Kenny tidings of soap sculptures and macaroni pictures.
ELDER HARRIS
Yes.
MOSES
And those little shaker things where... you put beans inside of paper plates that are glued together.
ELDER HARRIS
Paper-plate bean shakers.
MOSES
And let us put patterns of glue on the outside of those paper plates so we can then pour glitter on them so they can look nice and sparkly.
ELDER SCHWARTZ
You heard him, Scouts! Let's get to work!

Be sure to tune in tomorrow for another inexplicable episode of... Chinpokomon.
CARTMAN
[exults] Hooray! [hops off the sofa and begins to walk away...]
ANNOUNCER
Hey kids! [Cartman turns to look at the TV] Do you love Chinpokomon?
CARTMAN
Yes.
ANNOUNCER
Well, now you can buy your very own! [the little monsters begin to flash across the screen]
SINGER
I got to buy Chinpokomon
I got to buy it, I got to buy it! [six Chinpokomon appear]
ANNOUNCER
[more Chinpokomon appear...] Now you can collect them all. Furrycat, Donkeytron, Pengin, Shoe, Lambtor. Collect them all, and you can become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master.
CARTMAN
Royal Crown Chinpoko Master? Holy shit!
ANNOUNCER
All the Chinpokomon are in stores now.
JAPANESE WOMAN
[dressed in business attire] Chinpokomon is soo-peh-rior rubbeh toy, Nuhmbah 1!
SINGER
I got to buy it! Chinpo-ko-mon!
CARTMAN
[turns off TV and rushes to the kitchen, tossing the chicken tenders away] Mom! Mom!
[Kitchen. Liane is at the sink. Cartman rushes in and runs circles around her legs.]
CARTMAN
[pants] Mom! Seriously! Let's go to the toy store, Mom. Now! Must go! Toy store!
LIANE
Eric, calm down. [genuflects and restrains him]
CARTMAN
Uh seriously! Mom! Must go! Must buy!
LIANE
What is it, Eric?
CARTMAN
[breathless] Mom-Mom! I've only just heard. They're making Chinpokomon dolls, mom. You can collect them all. You can collect them all, Mother; quick, come on. Let's go to the toy store!
LIANE
[stands up and turns to the counter] I'm making you some lunch right now, Eric.
CARTMAN
[stops] ...But Mom, I have to get Chinpokomon dolls before everybody else does, 'cause then I'll be coo-oo-ool.
LIANE
Can't it wait till tomorrow, hon?
CARTMAN
[shriek] ...But Mom, I have to get the first one, or else people won't think I'm coo-oo-ool!
LIANE
Alright! let's go. [heads towards the front door. Cartman follows]
CARTMAN
Sweet.
[Toy store, "TOYS." Cartman and Liane approach it.]
CARTMAN
Everybody's gonna be sooo jealous when they see my Chinpokomon. [Liane opens the door, and both are shocked to find the store full of kids looking around and walking with Chinpokomon dolls. The class is there...]
BOY
Wuh-I love Chinpokomon.
GIRL
[amid the din] Give it to me!
BOY
Give it here!
LOUIS
[fighting with Bradley Biggle over a Chinpokomon doll] Give me that!
CARTMAN
Oh, god damnit! [walks in and runs into Stan]
STAN
Hey, fatass.
CARTMAN
Hey, dickhole. I guess you saw the commercial, too.
STAN
Yep. I got Roostor, Lambtron, and Shoe.
CARTMAN
Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna get a Pengin. He's the cutest. [walks to the Pengin canister and finds it empty] God damnit, there's no more Pengins! [Kenny walks over with one] Kenny, Pengin is my favorite. That's the last one. Let me have it. [starts pulling]
KENNY
(Nuh uh.) [pulls back. Tug-of-war]
CARTMAN
C'mon.
KENNY
(Nuh uh!)
CARTMAN
C'mon, Kenny. Let me ha--
KENNY
(No!)
CARTMAN
C'mon.
KENNY
(No!)
CARTMAN
C'mon. Give me Pengin!
KENNY
(No! This is mine!)
CARTMAN
C'mon!
[Checkout counter. Sharon is ready to pay for some Chinpokomon. Liane has one, too. Sharon turns to Liane.]
SHARON
Honestly, I don't see what they find so amusing about those things.
LIANE
They're so strange. Where are they from?
CASHIER
Well, it's some new big thing from Japan. I tell you, those Japanese really know how to market to kids.
"ASH"
[on a TV screen] I've got to collect all Chinpokomon. I've got to collect them all so I can become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master, oooh? [static]
JAPANESE WOMAN
Own-ah Chinpokomon, and-ah you vill-ah have-ah happy feelings-eh. [static]
"ASH"
I have to become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master.
KIDS
[recite as they disperse] Must collect Chinpokomon.
[South Park, next day. The boys stand around with their Chinpokomon. Kyle is missing.]
CARTMAN
Okay, Kenny. I'll trade you my Chuchunezumi for your Pengin.
KENNY
(Fuck you!)
CARTMAN
God damn it, you're supposed to trade, you little asshole! Give me Pengin!
KYLE
[arrives at the bus stop] Hey dudes. [notices] What are those?
STAN
What are these? They're Chinpokomon!
KYLE
Huh?
CARTMAN
[haltingly] You don't appear to have any Chinpokomon?
KYLE
No, but look. I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll.
CARTMAN
Oh, please! Cyborg Bill is so yesterday.
STAN
Yeah, like ancient history.
KYLE
Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore?
STAN
No, dude!
CARTMAN
Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle.
KYLE
Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!
CARTMAN
It's all Chinpokomon now.
STAN
Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective.
KYLE
What's the Primary Main Objective?
CARTMAN
You don't even know what the Primary Main Objective is?
STAN
The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.
KYLE
Well, what's the Evil Power?
STAN
[exasperated] Ogh..!
CARTMAN
[exasperated] Oh, my God..! The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpoko Master!
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
Duhhh!
STAN
Yeah, get with the times, dude. [turns and walks away with Cartman and Kenny]
CARTMAN
Duhhh!
KYLE
[throws down Cyborg Bill] Shit!
[Broflovski residence. Sheila and Gerald are talking on the sofa. Ike sits to Gerald's left.]
GERALD
Yeah, I guess so.
KYLE
[enters] Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?
SHEILA
What's a Chinpokomon?
KYLE
I'm not sure.
SHEILA
Well, why do you need one?
KYLE
I don't know.
SHEILA
...Well then, the answer is no, Kyle. You just got money to buy your Cyborg Bill doll.
KYLE
Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon.
GERALD
Well, Kyle, that's not a reason to buy something.
IKE
Neah Kyle doh.
GERALD
You see, son, fads come and go. And this "Chin-po-ko-mon" is obviously nothing more than a fad. You don't have to be a part of it. In fact, you can make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers, "I'm not going to be a part of this fad, because I'm an individual." Do you understand?
KYLE
Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass.
GERALD
Hm... Good point; here's $10. [hands it to him]
KYLE
Thanks.
GERALD
Wait, here's 20. Get one for your brother, too. [Kyle receives the other $10 and walks out]
IKE
Hey, Chih-paw-ko.
[Toy store. Kyle has just purchased a Lambtor.]
CASHIER
[hands him the doll] There you go, son. I honestly don't know what you see in these things.
KYLE
Neither do I. [turns and walks out.]
CASHIER
[closes the door and turns off the lights] I guess I'll call it a night. [heads towards the back]
A VOICE
Chinpoko! [the cashier turns] Buy me! Buy me! [the cashier heads for the Chinpokomon display] When will you become Royal Chinpoko Master? [the cashier gets a Lambtor and squeezes it, making a little squeak.] Hurry up and buy me. [squeeze] Down with America!
CASHIER
What? [squeeze]
LAMBTRON
I love you. Let's be best friends, and destroy the capitalistic American government.
CASHIER
What the hell is goin' on here?
[Cartman residence, next day. The boys are engaged in a video game. Again, Kyle is absent.]
KYLE
[enters] Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!
CARTMAN
Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week.
KYLE
What?
STAN
Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller?
KYLE
[a little lost] Huh? No.
CARTMAN
[haltingly] Oh, you didn't get a special Chinpokomon game controller. T-heh heh heh heh. Jehesus C-hrist! [Cartman presses "START" on game controller]
ANNOUNCER
Chinpokomon, what is Primary Objective?
STAN/KENNY/ CARTMAN
To destroy the Evil Power!
"ASH"
I've got to buy all the Chinpokomon so I can destroy the Evil Power, oooh?
STAN/KENNY/ CARTMAN
Oooh?
KYLE
Damnit! [walks out]
"ASH"
I've got to buy them all, so first I'd better go to Hawaii and visit Pearl Harbor.
JAPANESE WOMAN
[pops up] Gottai to bomb thah hahbah! Deddy? [vanishes]
"ASH"
Go! ["GO" pops up, and the boys are furiously maneuvering their controllers]
KENNY
(Hey, you guys...) [the boys bomb the harbor, grunting all the while]
"ASH"
I must buy them all! I must buy them all!
STAN/KENNY/ CARTMAN
We must buy them all! [they finish the first round of bombing and fly away]
JAPANESE WOMAN
[pops up] Gottai to bomb thah hahbah! [drops down. The second round begins and the bombing is more intense. Kenny begins to convulse and finally drops off the sofa. Play stops as Cartman and Stan look on with shock]
STAN
Dude, the video game gave Kenny a seizure!
CARTMAN
Cool! This game rules!
[Japan; Chinpokomon Company, outside. An inside shot looks to the main doors as they open, and one man walks in.]
CASHIER
Hello-o? Ey, hello? [a monitor drops down from above]
JAPANESE WOMAN
[on screen] Werucome to Chinpokomon Toy Corporashon. Purease state a-name.
CASHIER
Rr-Red Harris? I own a toy store in America?
JAPANESE WOMAN
Purease state the puhpose-uh.
RED
Uh, I wanna know what the hell you people are doing with these dolls, talkin' about bringin' down American government and all? [the monitor is pulled up in a hurry, and an elevator rises from the floor. The doors open and two men walk towards him.]
TALLER MAN
I am President Hirohito. And-ah, this is Mr. Ose.
MR. OSE
[nods forward] Peased to meet you.
PRESIDENT HIROHITO
We unduhstand you have big concern about our fine pro-duct.
RED
Oh, eh-yes. Do you mind tellin' me what the hell this is about? [squeezes Lambtor]
LAMBTOR
The American government lies to you! Join the fight for Japanese supremacy of the world! More to come. [the two men remain silent]
RED
Well?
MR. OSE
Uuuh.
PRESIDENT HIROHITO
That is so sturange. [takes Lambtor from Red] I do not a-know how this could happen. But urest assured, I will make sure [glares sideways at Mr. Ose] it does not happong again!
RED
Well, now, come on, I don't think that that quite satisfies my--
PRESIDENT HIROHITO
You are American?
RED
Yes.
PRESIDENT HIROHITO
[begins to gesture] Ogh! You must have very big pee-anis!
RED
Excuse me? I was just asking you what you're up to with these toys!
PRESIDENT HIROHITO
Nothing. We are very simple people. With very small penis. Mr. Ose penis is ...especially small.
MR. OSE
[fakes a sob] Uh, smuh, so small.
PRESIDENT HIROHITO
We cannot achieve much with so small penis. But you! Americans. Wow! Penis so big! Soo big penis!
RED
[flattered] Well uh, he-I guess it is a pretty good size.
MR. OSE
Minna-san, kite kite! ["Everyone, come come!" A group of Japanese women move in, chattering] This-a man has veh-ry big penis! [the women applaud, Red grins big]
WOMAN 1
Take takeru o da ne? ["It's rather large, isn't it?"]
WOMAN 2
Hai. ["Yes."]
MR. OSE
Uh, hoh, what an-whoa immense penis-uh!
RED
Well, it certainly was nice meeting you folk, I just wanted to bring that little malfunction to your attention. Bye-bye now.
PRESIDENT HIROHITO
Good-bye. Thank you for stopping by, with your gargantuan penis. [Red walks out humming happily. After a moment Hirohito looks angrily at Mr. Ose] Dame, dame da. ["Its over. Its all over." The women quickly exit the room. He slaps the back of Mr. Ose's head] Naze kono chippu o soto wo detanda? ["Why did you let this chip get outside?"]
MR. OSE
Wa, wakarimasen, shachou-san. Mondai desu ne. ["I, I don't know, president. This is going to be a problem, isn't it?"]
PRESIDENT HIROHITO
Seki ni shou yoube! ["Prepare a sit down meeting!"]
MR. OSE
Hai. Hai, shachou-san. ["Yes. Yes, president." He bows out]
[The Cartman house, night. Kitty roars outside. Cartman is asleep, but tossing...]
CARTMAN
I've got to buy Chinpokomon... I've got to... buy them... Must buy Chinpokomon...
[His Chinpokomon sends up an antenna, which sends out a signal, which goes out the window and joins other signals at a point in space. Then the merged signals go to a satellite, which bounces them to Japan. The signals reach the Chinpokomon Toy Corporation's rooftop satellite dish and split up to show each Chinpokomon in its own screen on the company's video wall. President Hirohito is talking to his board of directors under heavy guard.]
PRESIDENT HIROHITO
Amerika no kodomo minna ga Chinpokomon mo motte ima na. "Phase two" kaishi suru toki da. IKIMASHOO! ["All the children in America already own Chinpokomon now. It is time to begin "Phase two" . LET'S GO!" The soldiers set their rifles] The time has come! We will take Pearl Harbor!
[Marsh residence, next day. A TV is on: "I've got to buy it! I've got to buy it! Chinpokomon!" Sharon sits on the sofa looking at the cartoon.]
RANDY
[walks up] What are you doing?
SHARON
I'm watching one of Stanley's Chinpokomon video tapes.
RANDY
Why?
SHARON
Our son loves this show, Randy, so I think it's important that we watch it to see if it's teaching him good moral values. [Randy sits]
"ASH"
[addressing a robot rooster] Hey, you must be Roostor! I haven't bought one of you yet, but I'll bet you can transform into Roostallion if you found Diamond Skill 7! [picks it up and squeezes]
ROOSTOR
Roo-oo-oostor! [a teen boy in black body suit emblazoned with an 8 appear]
"EIGHT"
[does the following as he speaks] Hey, I'm gonna take your Roostor and put it in this bag, where it will flourish or expire, depending on fate!
"ASH"
Hey! Is that a good idea?
"EIGHT"
Roostors aren't like Chuchunezumis. They haven't the heart for such endeavors.
"ASH"
Oooh? [Randy and Sharon look lost]
RANDY
...Are those good moral values?
SHARON
I don't know what the hell they're talking about.
[Hours later. Randy and Sharon watch a battle scene in disbelief.]
"ASH"
Lambtron! You are losing the battle of your life! [Lambtron battles Furrycat]
NARRATOR
But Lambtron's powers also give him a good chance for a new fight. Will he succeed?
"ASH"
I am sad now, because Lambtron must be very lonely because there are so few Lambtrons in the world. Will he ever find a companion?
SHARON
This doesn't make sense. Are those stupid things supposed to be animals or robots or what?
RANDY
I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all.
SHARON
Randy, we can't allow our son to watch this stuff!
RANDY
Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent.
SHARON
No, but it's incredibly stupid, and that could be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence. Remember what Battle of the Network Stars did to an entire generation.
RANDY
[solemnly] My God, you're right.
[South Park, by Tom's Rhinoplasty, day. Cartman is strumming a guitar. A sign on the case reads: "Please HELP...Boys Sent to camp".]
CARTMAN
Come on, brothers and sisters
We've all got to join together
Join together and give me money
So I can buy more Chinpokomon!
We've got to stop this fight and...
STAN
[arrives with Kenny] How's it goin', fat ass?
CARTMAN
I haven't made any money yet.
STAN
What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp?
CARTMAN
Ey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a God-damned hippie all weekend! What have you two assholes done?!
STAN
We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure. [moves Kenny so the glazed eyes can be seen]
KYLE
[rushes up with a new item] I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller! [Tthe others look at him and then laugh]
CARTMAN
Jesus tap dancing Christ! Get with the program, Kyle!
STAN
Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.
KYLE
Camp?
CARTMAN
[sighs] The makers of Chinpokomon are going town to town and putting on a special camp to show all the Chinpoko Masters how to destroy the Evil Power.
STAN
You didn't know that?
KYLE
[quickly saving face] No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight? [turns and walks away]
STAN
Dude, did you just say "a-ight"?
KYLE
[turns back] Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight?
CARTMAN
Oh, my God, that's so yesterday!
STAN
Yeah, dude. Nobody says "a-ight" anymore.
KYLE
What?? "A-ight"'s not cool, either? When did that happen?
CARTMAN
Like, eight days ago.
KYLE
God damnit! [turns and hurries away]
[Marsh residence, night. Living room. The Marshes, the Broflovskis, Liane, the McCormicks, and the Tweeks watch an Chinpokomon advertisement.]
ANNOUNCER
Hey, kids! [Furrycat appears] Only one more day till the Chinpokomon camp! ["Ash" and "Eight" appear] Come early and enjoy all the Chinpoko fun! ["Chinpokomon CAMP" is placed over Furrycat, then a violet gorilla appears]
SINGER
Chinpokomon Camp!
I've got to buy a ticket!
I've got to buy one! A ticket!
I've got to buy buy buy!
JAPANESE WOMAN
[pops in from the side] It'sa Satuhday anda Sunday. You can'ta wait to go! [moves out]
SINGER
Chinpokomon! [the TV clicks off]
SHARON
We just thought we'd bring it to everyone's attention because, honestly, we don't know how to feel.
LIANE
Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp. I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad.
SHEILA
Yeah. We told Kyle he could go if he did all his chores, and he did.
RANDY
[concerned] Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys.
SHEILA
Well, you know how it is, Randy. The more we forbid them to play with Chinpokomons, the more they're gonna love them.
SHARON
You're right, Sheila. I guess the best thing we can do is just let them go until they get sick of it.
SHEILA
Sure. Apparently, they've been doing these camps in every city around the country; how bad can they be?
[Chinpokomon camp. A huge temple looms over the crowd of kids. Three huge screens display the Chinpokomon program. Soldiers guard the screens and the central stairway. Stan and friends move through the crowd. Several classmates are already there.]
CARTMAN
Get outta the way! Move it!
STAN
Can you see anything? [the gorilla Chinpokomon appears onscreen]
KIDS
Yay!!! [applause]
STAN
It's starting, it's starting!
SINGER
I've got to buy it! I've got to buy it! Chinpokomon! [the kids continue to cheer and clap. Mr. Ose takes center stage]
MR. OSE
Attention! Attention! [the kids quiet down] This isa Chinpokomon Camp!
KIDS
Chinpokomon is what we strive to be great at in our hearts!
KYLE
...our hearts. [looks left] Kenny? [Kenny stands motionless]
MR. OSE
What is the Primary Main Objective?
KIDS
To destroy the Evil Power!
KYLE
...Power.
MR. OSE
Yesuh. Anda what is the Evil Power? [no one answers] The Evil Power is the United States gorvernment! [the three screens display the U.S. flag. The kids stay silent]
CARTMAN
Ohhh.
MR. OSE
United Statesuh government is the Evil Power! It hasa taken Japanese Americans! It hasa broken Japanese spirit! And what do Chinpoko Masters do to Evil Power?!
KIDS
Destroy it!
KYLE
Destroy it?
MR. OSE
That isa correct! Now, it isa great honor to present... your Chinpoko Leaduh! Emperor Hirohito! [a gong is heard, and Mr. Ose claps a few times]
EMPEROR HIROHITO
[President Hirohito in shogun attire takes center stage] Welcome to campu. Whoever passes it knows and honors that the greatness of Japan is in its history, and it is based on that history that we shall again rise to the dominant world powuh!
CARTMAN
Is this cool or not? I can't tell.
EMPEROR HIROHITO
It is again time for the Rising Sun to sit tall in the sight! One Japan! One society! [walks off. Mr. Ose claps and takes the mike]
MR. OSE
We will begin witha language anda exercise skills. Hajimete!! ["Begin!" Two instructors walk up]
INSTRUCTORS

KIDS
Ichi, ni, san, shi! Ichi, ni, san, shi! ["1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3, 4!"]
[South Park Elementary, Mr. Garrison's class. The kids are chatting away happily in Japanese. All have anime expressions.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, I want it quiet! [the class shuts up] Now, we're gonna try this again until we get it right! What is six times three?
STAN
Juuhachi desu ka? ["Isn't it eighteen?"]
CLASS
Juuhachi da nee! ["Eighteen it is!"]
MR. GARRISON
No, goddammit, it's eighteen!!
STAN
Juuhachi is eighteen, Garrison-san.
MR. GARRISON
For the last time, my name is not Garrison-san, all right?! And this is not Hat-san! And you all better start talking in a manner that I can understand!
CARTMAN
Wuu, Garrison-san sabuchii dana. ["Ooo, Mr. Garrison is such an asshole!"]
MR. GARRISON
What did he say?!
STAN
He said, "Garrison-san sabuchii da naa."
CLASS
Soo desu nee! ["That's right!"]
MR. GARRISON
Damnit, this is not Japan!!
CARTMAN
Minna-san! Kite kite, churi... [farts. The class laughs]
WENDY
Dare ga pu shita no. ["Who farted?"]
MR. GARRISON
Aggghhh! [rushes out of the room amid the kids' laughter]
[City Hall, the Mayor's Office. The parents are gathered in it.]
MAYOR
People, please! We can only speak one at a time. Now, Mr. Garrison, you were saying...
MR. GARRISON
I can't take it, Mayor. You have to put an end to this Chinpoko Camp.
SHARON
[Randy holds her] My son hasn't made any sense in days.
PRIEST MAXI
I tell you, Mayor, these Japanese are trying to change our American children somehow!
MAYOR
Alright, people, Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Ose were nice enough to stop by to talk to you. Gentlemen? [Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Ose step up]
PRESIDENT HIROHITO
We at the Japan Toy Company are vetty cohncerned about-a your cohncerns. That is why we make Chinpokomon camp.
RANDY
Well, how is it good?! We don't understand what the point of your product is!
PRESIDENT HIROHITO
There is nothing to worry about. We at Japan Toy Company are in awe of your large penis.
MR. GARRISON
What?
PRESIDENT HIROHITO
You see, Japanese penis so small. [holds his hands about an inch apart]
MR. OSE
[set his index finger an inch from his thumb] So-eh small.
PRESIDENT HIROHITO
You Americans have such humungous burbous penis.
MR. GARRISON
Well, uh-I guess that's true.
MR. OSE
Oh, suh-n nice-a big penis American.
PRESIDENT HIROHITO
What can we possubruh do with such small penis? We cannot take over your city, filled witha men awith such mastodonic penis.
JIMBO
Huwell, uh he's got a point there.
RANDY
Well, I guess that settles that.
PRIEST MAXI
We're sorry we took your time, gentlemen.
PRESIDENT HIROHITO
[bowing with Mr. Ose] Oh, no. Thank you. Another chance to be in same room with big American penis. [exits]
MR. OSE
Uh-uh, my penis so small. [exits]
PRIEST MAXI
Nice guys. [the door closes]
[City Hall, outside the Mayor's Office.]
PRESIDENT HIROHITO
Jikan ga nai. Sugu ni bara de shimaou. Shikashi, itsu baru shinkuro isoga reba. ["Time is short. Those people will discover our plan soon. We must finish quickly."]
[City Hall, the Mayor's Office. The men and women have split into two groups by gender. Sharon speaks.]
SHARON
So, what are we going to do about our children? [the men smile down at their crotches] Ahhh, hello-o?
MAYOR
O-kay, people. I know this Chinpuku Man fad is causing a lot of problems. But I think we've already found a solution.
LIANE
You have?
MAYOR
Children are fickle. [thump] All we have to do is come up with a new fad. We find the next toy and turn them all onto it as soon as possible.
SHARON
Of course! That's a great idea!
SHEILA
But what toy?
[South Park Market Research Laboratories, a nondescrpt building. A big-screen TV is shown, flanked by two lab techs. Then a sofa is shown, with Kyle, Stan, Cartman, Kenny, and Butters.]
LAB TECH 1
Alright, boys, we're going to show you a couple of commercials, and you tell us which toy interests you the most. Now, watch carefully. [the first one comes on]

SINGER

SINGER
Goin' to try to ride all day long, but I'm goin' to fail
'Cause it's Wild Wacky Action Bike!

SINGER
You can't ride it, you can't ride it
Wild Wacky Action Bike!

BOY 1
[watching Alabama Man swing a bowling ball] Wow! He can bowl. [presses a button, releasing the bowling ball. It goes down the bowling alley and knocks six pins down]
SINGER
He can bowl, he can drink, he can drink and bowl
Alaba-ma Man!
ANNOUNCER

ANNOUNCER
Not all people from Alabama are wife-beaters. [Again, the boys stay silent]
CARTMAN
Gay.
STAN
Totally gay.
KYLE
Liberace gay.
LAB TECH 1
[writes "GAY" under "Alabama Man" and underlines it twice] Oooh, dear. Well, let's keep trying. How about this? [cuts into an actual commercial...]
[South Park, next weekend. The adults are lined up on either side of Main Street as Mr. Ose leads the kids through the town. Japanese flags, a poster of President Hirohito, and red flags are being paraded.]

No, it's not okay!
MR. OSE
Oh, but-a you have-a such large penis-uh. [behind him, Stan has a fierce expression on his face]
SHARON
What?
MR. OSE
Your penis, wooww-- [President Hirohito walks up and slaps him] O-oh..!
PRESIDENT HIROHITO
What he means is that all men in this town have very large penis. [all the men smile at the compliment]
SHARON
Can't you see what's happening?! They're just using that talk to distract you! He doesn't really have a small penis!
PRESIDENT HIROHITO

SHEILA
How?
SHARON
Come on! We don't have much time! [leads the adults away]
[Washington, D.C.; the White House.]
REPORTER
And now, for a special announcement from the President of the United States.
PRESIDENT CLINTON
[from the Oval Office] My fellow Americans, I wish to address the concerns many of us have over the growing number of Japanese military bases forming in the United States. The new Japanese emperor, Hirohito, has made our own children into fighter pilots who will soon fly to Hawaii and attack Pearl Harbor. I spoke with Mr. Hirohito this morning, and he assured me that I have a very large penis. He said it was mammoth, dinosauric, and absolutely dwarfed his penis, which, he assured me, was nearly microscopic in size. My penis, he said, was most likely one of the biggest on the planet. I applaud Mr. Hirohito in his honesty. Thank you.
[A Japanese military base. Eighteen planes and 39 troops are seen. The kids stand at attention. Kyle is missing.]
MR. OSE
Your plane will fly autopilot to Pearl Harbor! When you arrive you will drop many bombs!
KIDS
Hai, shachou-san. ["Yes, Mr. President." The kids part to the planes. Stan, Cartman, and Kenny run into the adults]
STAN
Nan da kore? ["What's this?"]
RANDY
Chinpoko ga dai-suki yo! ["We're crazy about this Chinpoko stuff." All the adults carry Chinpokomon now]
STAN
What?
RANDY
Uh, we just came to support you. We love Chinpokomon, too. It's super toy, number 1!
STAN
You like it?
MR. GARRISON
You bet. I think Chinpokoman is chinpokorrific. I got Shoe.
LIANE
Come on, Eric. Let's try to battle your Roostor with my Donkeytron.
CARTMAN
Uh... no, that's okay, Mom.
PRESIDENT HIROHITO
Whar are they doing?!
MR. OSE
It's a trick!
RANDY
Hey, Stan, look at my new bumper sticker. ["MY KID IS A CHINPOKOKID" with a smiling kid's face on the left end, and a Lambtron on the right. Randy walks to it and kneels to display it] Isn't that cool?
STAN
[holding a Chuchunezumi] No. [the adults laugh, and he throws the Chuchunezumi away] Screw this, dude. [starts walking out]
CARTMAN
Where are you going, Stan?
STAN
Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something. [walks away]
CARTMAN
Wait for me, I wanna get out of these stupid clothes. [follows]
OTHER KIDS
Yeah. Me too! Me too. [each one tosses a Chinpokomon onto a pile and leaves the airfield. A Lambtron lands on its side and a kid steps on it. The adults cheer.]
PRESIDENT HIROHITO
[grabbing his head in frustrated disbelief] Nooo!!
RANDY
Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves.
SHARON
That's right. Anything we like is instantly not cool. [turns to Mr. Garrison] We know how to take them out, Mr. Garrison. Spread the word! Get on the wire to every parent around the country and tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down! [he walks over to a telegraph machine and starts spreading the word]
STAN
Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?
SHARON
You bet, Stanley! [a fighter plane has left its spot and appears before the crowd. Kyle is in the cockpit]
KYLE
Owatta Beikoku! ["Down with the U.S.A.!"] [the adults are stunned]
SHEILA
Kyle, it's over!
KYLE
But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!
STAN
[flatly] Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore.
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
Yeah, dude, that's way over. [a rat is on Kenny, trying to nibble]
KYLE
Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!
STAN
No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused.
KYLE
So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?
STAN
...Ye-eah.
KYLE
But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya. [moves forward]
STAN
Oh... Wait. [walks with the plane] Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes.
KYLE
Aw, screw it; I'm too confused. [turns the power off and hops out of the plane. Mr. Garrison walk away]
RANDY
Well, I'm sure glad this is all over.
CARTMAN
[sees rats on Kenny and swats them off] Hey, get offa him! He's not dead yet!
[Bus Stop, next day. The four boys are waiting. The rats return and crawl all over Kenny.]
CARTMAN
Nnno! Get off, you stupid rats! He's not dead yet!
STAN
Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards?
KYLE
Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while.
CARTMAN
Me, too. [Kenny starts to tremble] I'm choosing my own toys from now on, 'cause-- [Kenny falls and trembles harder. The others watch]
STAN
What the..? [Kenny's body rips open and a bunch of rats crawl out of him.]
CARTMAN
Ooooh-ho-ho-ho, gro-hoss! [Stan and Kyle laugh as Cartman looks on, the credits play the instrumental theme that played in the Wild Wacky Action Bike & Alabama Man commercials]
SINGER
(over the Braniff Airlines logo) Bye bye buh-buh-buh-buh-buh chicken!
End of Chinpokomon

synopsis:Starvin' Marvin returns to South Park with an alien spaceship and enlists Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny's help to seek out a new home for his starving people.

script:Starvin' Marvin in Space

[In Memory of Mary Kay Bergman]
[Space. A small ship makes its way towards Earth. An alien flies the ship. It has a big brain, and its head is covered with veins that stick out.]
MARKLAR
Marklar, this is Marklar. Approaching Marklar.
MARKLAR DISPATCHER
Proceed with marklar and make first contact.
MARKLAR
Marklar. [the Marklar ship descends to Earth and hovers over a desert. It lands, and the Marklar pilot steps out. It walks forward] Greetings, Marklar, I am Marklar. [Two lions and a lioness look at him hungrily.] I come in marklar. [the lions move towards him] Oh, marklar. [the lions jump him and rips him to shreds] AAAAAAAAAA! [the lions run away carrying chunks of the Marklar in their mouths]
[Fade to next day, the Ethiopian desert under the hot sun. The Ethiopians laze about in front of their huts, having nothing to do. The camera pans past the hut to a small white church with a simple cross and a white picket fence.]
WOMAN
Hello, everyone. I am Sister Hollis. I was chosen for my mission work to come here to Africa and teach you all about the teachings of Jesus. [a group of Ethiopians sit cross-legged, with their Bibles in front of them on white benches. This is her Bible class. Above them, two ceiling fans spin, clanking a little] Okay then, do we have our Bibles that were handed out freely? [an Ethiopian attempts to eat one, but Hollis interrupts] No no, we don't eat the Bibles, we read them. [returns to the front] Now, let's turn to Mark 3:19. [the class does not respond] Come on, remember [pulls down a chart]: reading Bible plus accepting Jesus equals food. [the students study the chart, then open their Bibles] Good. Now, who can read Mark 3:19? How about... Marvin? [glissant as the camera switches to Marvin reading. He lowers his Bible]
MARVIN
Doundobi godia dyum * *
HOLLIS
No, Marvin, in God's language. English.
MARVIN
Dongdin * * mium bidu [closes his Bible, leaves it, and heads towards the door]
HOLLIS
Where are you going? Back to your life of sin? Don't you understand that unless you find Christ, you and all your people are doomed to eternal hellfire? [Marvin just opens the door, walks out, and heads towards the desert. He passes his people, who can do nothing but moan]
ETHIOPIANS
Ooooohhh. [some of them cough. Marvin shows surprise as he sees a group of eight people on a hill looking down at a column of smoke. He moves up to them]
MARVIN
Duo bet tum debettum * * ghm * *? [the camera goes over the group to reveal the Marklar's ship. Marvin stares in awe] Mah tah guum tyum * * ghm tm tm. [moves towards it. The chief says something, but Marvin continues to the ship. He touches it, and it opens up for him, the sand washing off its surface. The group on the hill screams with joy. Some of the group runs away]
ETHIOPIAN
Necah * * necundat? [Marvin opens the cockpit and hops in]
CHIEF
Nn * * de co?
MARVIN
Umi chu. [presses a button to activate a map display. The cockpit closes and the ship lifts off]
ETHIOPIAN WOMAN
Wobe dabiga gm * *.
MARVIN
Gobede *. [presses a button and the ship lurches up. He takes off and comes back, sweeping over the villagers' heads. He takes off into space, into the distance, and then returns. The episode title follows close behind]
[Starvin' Marvin in Space]
[In Star Wars fashion, the camera moves from space down and right to a sunny day in South Park. The camera settles on South Park Elementary as the bell rings. Class is now in session]
MR. GARRISON
...And so, children, that's why Hare Krishnas are totally gay. [the door opens and two agents enter. They start looking under tables and lifting desks, then lower the blinds...] Uh, can I help you?
AGENT 1
Yes. I'm Connelly, and this is Sphinx. We're with the CIA.
SPHINX
We're here to speak with some of your students. [turns to them] You [Cartman], you [Kyle], you [Kenny], and you [Stan].
MR. GARRISON
Oh, for Pete's sake, what have you bastards done now?!
CARTMAN
Hey! That was Kyle that went #2 in the urinal!
KYLE
No it wasn't, fatass! I saw you do it!
CONNELLY
Boys, we need to talk to you about a matter of national security. Now!
KENNY
(Huh?) [Connelly takes Cartman and Kyle, Sphinx takes Kenny and Stan. They then carry the boys out the door. Sphinx reaches back to close it]
MR. GARRISON
I hope you give them the chair! [turns back to the chalkboard] Anyway, children, as I was saying, Hare Krishnas are totally gay. [writes "Hare Krishnas" on the board.]
[A military complex. The boys are seated inside a hangar, with a lamp shining on them.]
CARTMAN
Oh, dude, this is not cool!
KYLE
Relax, fatass.
CARTMAN
No. Dude, I've seen this on TV. They shine that light in your face, and then they try to get you to tell them stuff by squeezing your balls really hard.
STAN
What??
CARTMAN
Dude, I've seen it! They grab your balls with their leather-gloved hands and they squeeze 'em as hard as they can until they pop like little grapes!
STAN, KYLE
Ow, dude! [the hangar doors open and the two agents enter]
CARTMAN
[pointing] Start with Kenny! Start with Kenny! [Kenny looks at him]
SPHINX
Relax, boys. We just need to talk with you.
STAN
* I told you, fatass.
CONNELLY
Approximately 31 hours ago, an ethnic-looking child was spotted flying some kind of state-of-the-art space craft over Chinese air space.
CARTMAN
Whoa, cool.
SPHINX
Cool? That craft appears to have enough plutonium fuel on board to blow up a large city! Do you think that's cool?!
CARTMAN
Totally!
CONNELLY
Alright, children, we just need to know one thing: Do you know this person? [holds up a picture of Marvin]
CARTMAN
Heeyy, that's Starvin' Marvin.
STAN
Sshh!
CONNELLY
Who?
KYLE
You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!
CARTMAN
Oh. We don't know him.
SPHINX
We already know you know him. We have this! [a picture of the boys standing behind Marvin outside King Jimmy's Buffet] Now, who is he?! [Kyle farts, and the boys laugh]
CARTMAN
Kyle's makin' mudpies; you guys want one? [the agents walk away and talk with each other. The boys laugh for a long time...]
CONNELLY
This is getting us nowhere. We'll have to resort to more drastic measures.
SPHINX
But they're just kids. We can't torture them.
CONNELLY
Look, we don't know what that craft is capable of, but the kid is going to have to land it somewhere. God only knows what sadistic backwards Third-World country could get their hands on that ship!
[Australia. The ship heads towards it, with a song playing in the cockpit. Marvin is enjoying his flight, but the screen tells him to debark]
SINGER
Soaring so high above the world,
Never thought I could be so free.
I'm one with the birds, and magic is all I see.
MAN 1
[pointing] Oy, look up there! [the ship descends and the engines turn off]
MAN 2
It's a UFO! [the windshield rolls back]
CROWD
[start backing up] Oohh?!
MARVIN
[appears] Dogom * Dommm * *.
MAN 3
Boy, that's one creeepy alien.
MARVIN
Gmm * Mmm-mm * *.
MAN 4
[prodding] Talk to 'im, Mayor. [the Mayor walks up to Marvin and speaks]
MAYOR
Great and noble alien creature. As Mayor of the fine planet of Australia, I welcome you to our fine... planet of Australia. Chippy chip.
CROWD
Churrah! [Marvin pulls out pencil and paper and starts drawing...]
MAYOR
Look out, he's got a gun! [shields his face. The others cower]
MAN 5
Wait, it's not a gun. It's a piece of paper.
MAYOR
Oh. [the paper has a drawing of Australia and of Marvin's people. Marvin draws an arrow from his people to Australia] Oh, I think he's tryin' to tell us that he wants to relocate all his species here to Australia.
MARVIN
* * Muogleblabla mb'g * *.
MAYOR
Well, you certainly are all welcome 'ere, alien. In fact, there's a mission right over there that will take all your people in. [it looks just like the one he left in Ethiopia. A woman is at the door.]
WOMAN
Hello-o. [Marvin looks, and the smile leaves his face. He hops back into the craft and takes off]
MAYOR
Guess the little pecker doesn't like missionaries.
[The military complex. The children are being tortured, but not physically. They moan and grunt]
SPHINX
Now, I'll ask you again. Who is the little boy that took our ship?
STAN
We don't know. [some scratching is heard]
THE BOYS
Aaaaaaaa! [Sphinx is scratching at a balloon] Aaaaaaaa!
CONNELLY
[holds up a picture of Marvin in the spacecraft] Who is this person!
CARTMAN
[gasping] K-kill me.
CONNELLY
Do it again. [Sphinx scratches the balloon...]
THE BOYS
Aaaaaaaa!
CARTMAN
No wait. I'll tell you. [the agents take off their ear muffs] He's, he's a little starving Ethiopian kid. We adopted him.
KYLE
Cartman!
SPHINX
Adopted from whom?
CARTMAN
Sally. Sally Struthers. The lady on TV. She knows everything. Sally Struthers.
CONNELLY
Sally Struthers!
SPHINX
Where can we find her?!
CONNELLY
I know exactly where Sall Struthers is. Let them go.
KYLE
Good job, fatass!
CARTMAN
Dude, I couldn't take anymore of that balloon. Another couple hours of that, and I would've been totally pissed off.
STAN
[moving past Kyle and Cartman] Whatever. Let's go see what's on TV.
[Ethiopia, the FEED THE CHILDREN FOUNDATION building. The agents sit in the lobby reading newspapers]
RECEPTIONIST
Gentlemen, Ms. Struthers can see you now. [the men rise and go for the door, but before they enter Connelly stops and closes the door]
CONNELLY
I'm warning you, Bill. Sally Struthers is a bit heavy. But don't say anything, because she's pretty sensitive.
SPHINX
Oh, I would never say anything. I saw some show where they made fun of Sally Struthers' weight, and I thought it was totally cruel. I mean, she helps people, you know. [they enter. The storage room has been transformed into awfully dark living quarters for her]
CONNELLY
Ah, Ms. Struthers.
SALLY
Oh ho ho ho. [she now has the shape of a Hutt] Un chaka solo david. Saime no Chewbacca dakaiminbi? ho ho. ["Hello gentlemen. How can I help you?"]
CONNELLY
Ms. Struthers. We understand you have helped raise millions of dollars to help starving children in Ethiopia.
SALLY
Oh? Makarendae bi cho. ["I do my best."] Ho ho ho.
CONNELLY
We need information on one of the Ethiopians. You must tell us everything you know about him. [waves his hand in a Jedi fashion]
SALLY
Do ba kim.
SPHINX
Uh, heh-his name is Starving Marvin.
SALLY
[begins to sniff around] Jonoba unko chocolate Yum Yum bar ancho? ["Is that a chocolate Yum Yum bar in your pocket?"]
CONNELLY
Why, yes. It is a chocolate Yum Yum bar, Ms. Struthers [removes it from his coat pocker and waves it around], and there are several more where that came from. [Sally licks her lips. Connelly sees a trash can nearby and opens it, then dangles the bar over it] Of course, if you don't want to tell us about the Ethiopian boy...
SALLY
Mmmmo na ka!
CONNELLY
[closes the trashcan and walks over with the candy bar] I'm... glad we can do business.
[Cartman's house, night. The boys are on the sofa watching TV. Cartman has the remote]
STAN
Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news.
CARTMAN
Well, I can't find anything- wait. What's this? [a shot of Pat Robertson asking for pledges on the CBC channel.]
PAT
Uh, God wants you to send us money. He needs you to send us money so we can help others.
CARTMAN
Oh, my God, this guy again. ["What we do is- "]
KYLE
Why would anybody send this asshole money? ["-we go all around the world and-"]
KENNY
(To pay for the pockets on his peehole) [The boys laugh. "-we give Bibles and and, and..."]
KYLE
Yeh-hah. [They hear noise outside, and soon Marvin's ship crashes through the front wall of the house.]
BOYS
Whoa! [They rush outside to see the rest of the ship. Cartman goes to see the damage]
CARTMAN
Oh! Aww! [Part of the second story of the house falls away.] Oh, weak! [Marvin hops down from the ship]
KYLE
Starvin' Marvin!
MARVIN
Bongi groinit * *.
KYLE
He did take a ship.
CARTMAN
Well nice job, Marvin! I hope you got about a thousand dollars to pay for my house!
MARVIN
Ingan *.
STAN
Dude, you're gonna get busted for taking this thing.
MARVIN
Chede gwodum * * godom.
KYLE
I think he wants us to get in.
STAN
Kick ass! [Marvin returns to the pilot's seat; the others hop in and stand around him.] Wow, this thing is awesome!
KYLE
Let's go somewhere. [Marvin pulls the ship out of Cartman's house and flies low over the ground]
SINGER
Soaring so high above the world,
Never thought I could be so free.
STAN
[the ship goes higher, over other cities] Wow!
KYLE
Yes!
SINGER
I'm one with the birds, and magic is all I see.
STAN
This is great!
CARTMAN
Yeah, but where's that crappy song coming from? Could you turn that off? ["And it's a wonderful day 'cause something-"]
MARVIN
[turns off the music] Gmmm?
STAN
Yeah, that's better.
[Ethiopia, day. A man tries to rise, but doesn't have the energy to do it]
MAN
Oooh. [falls back on his pillow. Sister Hollis comes up]
HOLLIS
Hello? Howare we doing today? Look what I got for you.
MAN
[quickly rising] Nn * wohg *?
HOLLIS
No, it's not food. It's a cross. [hands it to him] And it has your Christian name printed on it. From now on, you are Michael. Can you say "Michael"? [the man clicks and holds up the cross] Mmmi-chael. [the man clicks again] Oh, well. You'll get it. [walks away and heads over to a family of four] Hello, brother David. Do you have any sins to confess? [David does not respond, but a fly lands on his eye] Anybody? Sins to confess? Joshua? [he just looks up at her] You know, today I'm reminded of Psalm 46, line 39: "Though the mountains shake and th-" [the CIA agents walk up]
CONNELLY
Here they are!
HOLLIS
Who are you?
CONNELLY
We're with the American government! Sally Struthers told us where we'd find Marvin's parents!
SPHINX
Hello there, Mr. and Mrs. Clickclickderk. I think you know why we're here. [the family stares in horror]
[The Marklar ship, night. The boys are flying over a desert]
KYLE
No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too.
MARVIN
Blubedegub? [points to Utah on the map]
CARTMAN
No way, not Utah. Utah's nothin' but missionaries.
STAN
Dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world. [the world map is shown]
CARTMAN
Well, he hasn't been here yet. Where's this? [presses a big red button on the left side of the display panel. The ship bucks and heads into space.]
BOYS
Whooaaa! [the ship rolls sideways for a moment]
STAN
What the hell did you hit, Cartman?! [a wormhole appears before them, and they head for it]
KYLE
Oh, my God! What the hell is that thing?! [the ship races into the wormhole]
BOYS
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [everything inside the ship begins to twist and warp] Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [more twisting and warping, and the ship races out of the wormhole into a star system with a green planet. Everything inside the ship is normal again]
KYLE
[gasps] Where are we?
MARVIN
Gobin gobedo * * gowog. [the ship heads down into the atmosphere and then towards an island]
STAN
We're on like, some foreign planet.
KYLE
This place is rad. Look at all the trees and stuff.
MARVIN
Gewhit * * Gewit um hebed wabaduh. Gabalah. [the ship descends to a plain next to a waterfall, and lands]
[Planet Marklar, day. The ship's windshield rolls back. The boys climb down and look around]
MARVIN
Badak bladla buk.
MARKLAR LEADER
Greetings. Welcome to Marklar.
STAN
Uh, thanks.
MARKLAR LEADER
I am Marklar, leader of the Marklar.
STAN
U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth.
MARKLAR LEADER
[bows] Marklar to you.
STAN
Cool!
CARTMAN
Ey! I'm the leader of Earth!
STAN
Screw you, Cartman! I called leader first!
CARTMAN
Well, you can call leader 'til your ass bleeds, but that doesn't make it true! [the Marklar leader looks a bit confused. Marvin steps forward and smiles. The land around the group is green and lush, water is plentiful...]
MARKLAR LEADER
We are very thankful to you for bringing our marklar back to us.
KYLE
[joins Marvin] Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar.
MARKLAR LEADER
Oh, here on Marklar, we refer to all people, places, and things as marklar.
KYLE
Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'.
STAN
[Cartman looks in pleasant wonder] Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here.
MARKLAR LEADER
Well, there is a lot of room on Marklar. If Marklar here wants to bring his marklar to Marklar, that would be fine. Just take our marklar back to Marklar and bring all the marklar back with you.
STAN
Uuh. Thanks.
MARVIN
* *.
[Ethiopia, day. The agents are still drilling Marvin's family]
CONNELLY
Let's go through this one more time, Mr. and Mrs. Clickclickderk! Your son Marvin has the ship that we want! How can we get it from him? [the family sits still]
SPHINX
[switching places with Connelly] We are the CIA. That ship needs to be with us! Maybe we should just take something precious of yours, huh?! [lifts his shades and scans the area] Daha! [picks up a gourd and dangles it] This! This gourd-thingy, for instance. How do you like that, huh? If you ever wanna see this... little... thingy again, I suggest you contact your boy! [the family just looks at him. At that moment, the Marklar ship zooms over the little village, and the villagers raise a ruckus over Marvin's return. The ship stops and descends, engines roaring]
SPHINX
There it is! [Hollis covers her ears. The ship lands and everyone moves towards it. The windshield rolls back and the boys scramble down from the ship]
MARVIN
Muwuhbuh * * mlamleblubluh mjek.
CONNELLY
Back away from the space craft, children!
STAN
Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar.
KYLE
Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there. [the Ethiopians all begin to speak]
HOLLIS
Alien race? Have they... heard the word of Christ?
CARTMAN
No, never. It's perfect.
HOLLIS
Ooh, no. Those poor souls. We must spread the Gospel to them. [hurries away]
STAN
What??
MARVIN
*. [walks to Hollis] Mluglu dja mugm blugabeb * * *.
KYLE
Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do!
CONNELLY
You'll do nothing of the kind! This ship is now property of the United States Government!
KYLE
No! [agents rush in from all sides and some black helicopters appear over the space ship. Two FBI agents come and stand behind the boys.]
MARVIN
[tugs at Hollis' dress] Dor dor binor hm ghm.
SPHINX
Call those boys' mothers. [Connelly starts dialing] I'm sure they'll be very interested in the trouble their boys have been up to.
KYLE
Oh, no, dude!
[CBC television studios. The CBC logo, a pair of angel wings topped by a halo, and CBC printed in front of them, fills the screen. Next comes "Christian Broadcasting Channel"]
PAT
["TO PLEDGE CALL: 1-800-555-2717"] You know, Susan, the uh-there are so many great missionaries doing work, out there in in in-in parts of Africa, and uh we're trying to get Bibles to people all over the world. And what we need, is the help of everyone out there so that we can continue these, these projects. Now, listen to this, Susan. [a picture of Hollis with two Ethiopians appears over his right shoulder] Wha-one of our missionaries in North Africa has made an amazing discovery. U-u-uh a new planet, in the in the galaxy Alpha Seti VI, that has intelligent life on it.
SUSAN
Amazing.
PAT
Yeah. We're not sure what these hyper-intelligent beings look like, but one thing is for sure: they've never heard of Jesus Christ.
SUSAN
What can we do at the 600 Club to help those poor aliens?
PAT
Well, what we need, Susan, is we need money to build an interstellar cruiser. [a diagram of said cruiser appears over his shoulder: the XT-9000] Now, this space ship will be able to travel through a wormhole and deliver the message and guh-glory of Jesus Christ to those godless aliens. S-send your money now. Amen.
[Ethiopia. The agents are still investigating...]
CONNELLY
I want everyone to keep a safe distance from the craft until we can run some tests.
FBI AGENT
[walks up] E-excuse me, gentlemen, uh Tom Brokaw is here to see you.
SPHINX
Tom Brokaw? Oh no, the press already? [the CIA agents walk over]
"BROKAW"
[sounds like Cartman] Oh. Good day, gentlemen. [the yellow headband and the shape of the pant legs look familiar...]
SPHINX
Uh huh. [FBI agents gather behind him and Connelly] Mr. Brokaw, I presume.
"BROKAW"
You presume wisely, sir. I'm here to get the big story, the big scoop. [Marvin tip-toes to the ship unnoticed] I understand that you've found some kind of ship from an alien race. [Marvin opens the cargo door and signals for his people to enter the ship. They start doing so] Seeing as though I am Pulitzer-prize-winning Tom Brokaw...
CONNELLY
Look, kid. Did you really think this was going to fool anybody? You don't look anything like Tom Brokaw.
"BROKAW"
What?! Do you question my integritah?!
KYLE
[from the pants] I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass!
"BROKAW"
Buh-eh, ugh. I had some bad burritos today.
MARVIN
* * wughum chughum * *, * *.
CONNELLY
[he and Sphinx remove the men's clothes from the boys] Alright boys. Time to get back to your quarters.
STAN
Oh. [the cargo door closes and Marvin is ready to take off]
CONNELLY
Son of a bitch!
STAN
Run for it!
CONNELLY
Get 'em! [two FBI agents move]
CARTMAN
Wah-ey. Come on you guys, wait!
KYLE
Watch out! Here I come!
KENNY
(Hey, you guys, I'm a little bit be-) [trips over a rock and lands on his face] (Oof.)
KYLE
Kenny!
CARTMAN
Forget him! He's done for! [Stan climbs up and looks back]
STAN
He's not done for, he's standing right there.
KENNY
(You guys, just fly away!)
CARTMAN
No, no, he's done for. Come on! [the windshield rolls down and the ship takes off. It zooms into the distance, then straight up into space. The helicopters could not catch up]
SPHINX
[holding Kenny] Nooo!
CONNELLY
Damnit, damnit, damnit!
[The Marklar ship, space. The ship speeds away from Earth.]
STAN
Alright, we made it!
KYLE
Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home!
MARVIN
Gakchak ghm. [a blast is felt inside. Its impact site is near the cockpit]
KYLE
What was that? [the CBC's XT-9000 appears behind them. Inside, Sister Hollis is manning the bridge, with another woman and four men.]
HOLLIS
This is the Missionary 600. We have you locked on "fire: ready." Turn back right now. [another shot is fired, and the Marklar ship is hit again.]
BOYS
Aaaa!
ETHIOPIANS
[tossed to one side of the cargo bay] Whoa!
STAN
They're shooting at us.
KYLE
Quick, Marvin. Get us to Marklar.
MARVIN
[tries all the buttons, including the red one, but to no avail] Midik, gmanjaum * *.
KYLE
Well, how'd we do it last time??
STAN
Cartman just hit the button, and the ship flew itself.
KYLE
Which button did you press, Cartman??
CARTMAN
U-u-huh. I don't remember.
KYLE
You don't remember?!
STAN
You dumbass, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Hey, I was under duress! Maybe it waaas this one. [presses the big red button]
SINGER
Soaring so high above the world.
THE BOYS
Aawwww!
SINGER
Never-
[The Missionary 600, still pursuing the Marklar ship]
HOLLIS
The ship seems to be made out of a... super-strong alloy. These lasers aren't powerful enough.
[The 600 Club, Pat Robertson reporting]
PAT
Everyone, the Word of God is going around the world and all your help is so greatly appreciated. Eh-oo What we need now is an argon crystal laser. [the 900txl] Eh you see, an argon crystal laser can pierce thick space holes in a way that other lasers just can't. Send your money now. Uuh-I th-thank you.
[Ethiopia, day. Feed The Children Foundation. The agents are talking to Sally Struthers]
SALLY
[eating her way through a box of food relief] Onadonakami?
CONNELLY
Ms. Struthers, we understand that you have a ship of your own. One capable of interstellar travel.
SALLY
Chewmbacca vije dai gwo. ["Maybe I do, and maybe I don't."]
SPHINX
We need to use your ship to catch those boys. We will do anything for that technology.
SALLY
Juodo nakahobi? Ho ho ho ho. ["Why should I help you?"]
SPHINX
Ms. Struthers, if those Ethiopians make it to another planet, who will send money to your foundation? Without Ethiopians, you have no food.
SALLY
Wo? Wo chaka gom??
CONNELLY
Oh, that won't be a problem, Ms. Struthers. We have... collateral. [steps aside and brings Kenny in]
KENNY
(Oh my God, I get it.)
SALLY
Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho. [a small creature pops out and laughs]
[The Missionary 600, still pursuing the Marklar ship]
HOLLIS
I have the infidels in my sight. [the Marklar ship tries evasive maneuvers, but it is hit again.]
CARTMAN
Holy shit!
ETHIOPIANS
[tossed to the other side of the cargo bay] Whoa!
MARVIN
Doye dondabuh. [swings the ship around and fires two blasts at the Missionary 600]
CREW
Aaah.
HOLLIS
Holy crap, they have photon torpedoes.
[The 600 Club, Pat Robertson reporting]
PAT
Uhnow, our deflector shields are useless against phorton torpedoes, and we really need your support on this one, folks. Here at the 600 Club we need your money to spread the Word of Jesus, and build more advanced deflector shields for our galactic cruiser. Call now, and we'll give you this free pin. [a CBC logo pin]
[Space. The Missionary 600 and the Marklar ship now do battle. Marvin fires at the Missionaary 600 twice more.]
600 CREW
Aaah.
STAN
You got 'em, Marvin.
KYLE
Yeah, now finish 'em off! [a huge junker comes up behind and fires at them]
COMPUTER
[female voice] Warning. Deflector shields failing.
KYLE
Where did that come from??
SALLY
Ho ho ho ho. [the CIA agents stand behind her, and two other men are at the helm]
CONNELLY
Good! Now get them in our tractor beam! [the beam is activated and holds the Marklar ship in place. The Missionary 600 comes around and faces the Marklar ship]
HOLLIS
Now we've got 'em! [in the Marklar ship, the boys look at the screen...]
SALLY
Ho ho ho ho.
CARTMAN
It's Sally Struthers!
HOLLIS
Well, it appears they'll be going back to Ethiopia, so we can go on to the aliens.
KYLE
Sorry, Marvin. We tried.
CARTMAN
Wait. Ms. Struthers? Ms. Struthers!
SALLY
Wo?
CARTMAN
Ms. Struthers, please. Just listen to me for one second. You started the Feed the Children Foundation for wonderful reasons: to help starving, helpless people who live in a rotten part of the world. Well, it's for those reasons we wanna help our friend Marvin now. [Sally looks moved]
SALLY
Holna chewbacca? ["Because of me?"]
SPHINX
Ms. Struthers, don't forget the gift we gave you: the child in carbonite. [points. The camera pans over to a panel which shows Kenny encased in carbonite]
SALLY
Dama doko nou na oh. ["Let him speak."]
CARTMAN
Ms. Struthers. You helped so many people, and you've taught us that helping people is what life is all about. All we wanna do is... be like you. [Sally considers Cartman's statements for a moment, then...]
SALLY
Oh, foada! ["You're right!" She presses a button, and the tractor beam switches off the Marklar ship and on the Missionary 600]
600 CREW
[the bridge jerks a bit] Whoa! [the beam pulls the Missionary 600 closer to the junker.]
CARTMAN
She bought it.
STAN
Sally Struthers is saving us!
[The 600 Club, Pat Robertson reporting]
PAT
Uh, now, now, stay with me on this one, folks. Uh, Sally Struthers has a Tiberian junker [pictured in a window], which is uh the favorite ship of the Hutts, and she has trapped oureh, our our new CBC ship in an uh [struggling] poe-sitronic tractor beam. [a stage hand holds up this cue card that reads: Tractor Beam, so we're gonna need a Ionic Tractor Disruptor] Uh, so we're gonna need an ionic tractor disruptor. Now now, not a regular ionic di- tractor disruptor, but a negative ionic tractor disruptor to uh, help spread the Word of Jesus. [to Susan, softly] I don't have a fucking idea up here.
[Space. The junker is busy pulling the Missionary 600 in. The Marklar ship is free to leave]
STAN
Now's our chance!
CARTMAN
Wait. I remember. It was the red button! [presses it, and the ship zooms away. The wormhole appears again and the ship head for it]
HOLLIS
They've opened the wormhole!
KYLE
It's pulling us in! [the junker and the Missionary 600 give chase. All three ships enter the wormhole, and all experience its warping effects.]
BOYS
Aaaah!
600 CREW
Aaaah! [the ships rush out of the wormhole and into Alpha Seti VI, near the Marklar planet]
[Marklar. The ship land. The Missionary 600 has to lean to one side. All parties are out of their ships]
KYLE
Marvin... [everyone talks at once]
MARKLAR
Please, please, please. We are confused. You must explain one at a Marklar.
HOLLIS
Alien friend, we are here to spread the Word of Jesus. He died for your sins.
MARKLAR
Who? Marklar?
STAN
We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us.
MARKLAR
Brought m- marklar??
HOLLIS
What is "marklar"?
MARKLAR
Yyou're marklar; everyone and everything is referred to as marklar.
SPHINX
Doesn't that get confusing?
MARKLAR
Oh no. Watch this. Hey, Marklar!
MARKLAR
[in orange robe] Yes?
MARKLAR
You see?
KYLE
[steps forward] Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars.
MARKLAR
Young marklar, your marklars are wise and true.
HOLLIS
What the hell did he say?
STAN
[hushed] Wow! Good job, dude!
KYLE
Thanks.
MARKLAR
The marklars can stay!
ETHIOPIANS
Wooo!
BOYS
Alright!
CARTMAN
Alright,
MARKLAR
You marklars must leave.
HOLLIS
But you will all burn forever in eternal hellfire. [she and the other woman are taken away]
MARKLAR
Yes, that's nice. Thank you for stopping by.
STAN
Well Marvin, it was sure cool seeing you again.
MARVIN
Chak chak glika gm gm guchab mglup.
KYLE
No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth.
SALLY
Bwo chaaga bi.
BOYS
[leaving] Goodbye, Marvin.
MARVIN
Chak chak m geteaub m * *.
STAN
Maybe we'll come and visit sometime.
CARTMAN
Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President, heh.
STAN
Dude!
CARTMAN
What? We're not gonna come visit him.
STAN
I know, but you don't tell him that!
CARTMAN
T'heh, whatever. [the Ethiopians chatter over their new home and head for the lake at the foot of the waterfall]
DVDA
[Over end credits]
I am Chewbacca
I am a Wookie
I am Chewbacca
I have no home
My home is where

synopsis:Korn comes to South Park for a Halloween concert and helps the boys solve a spooky pirate ghost mystery.

script:Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery

[A bustling scene on a dock. A large lake is behind the dock, a stage is off to the left, and the whole place is being dressed for Halloween. Beyond the lake, a lighthouse looks over the scene. At center is a booth for a radio station. The camera moves in]
DJ
[with classic 1970's big hair] We're here live at the KOZY 102.1 Halloween Haunt at the South Park docks! Come on down! We've got a haunted house [Chef finished pinning a banner on the top right corner of the stage] and everyone is decorating for tomorrow night, [one man pins a rubber bat to a shack roof, another walks past with a jack-o-lantern] HALLOWEEN, when the band KoRn, that's right, KoRn, is going to play live! And don't forget to wear a costume tomorrow, because there's a big first prize! Why, here's some kids enjoying the Halloween Haunt now! [Kenny, Kyle, and Stan walk past, but turn to face the DJ] Say boys, what do you think of KOZY-FM's Halloween Haunt so far? [lowers the boom mic to Stan]
STAN
This one time, like eight months ago, I saw two guys kissing in a park. And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt. [turns and walks away with Kyle and Kenny]
DJ
Uh-hall right! Well, enjoy the spooky docks, kids.
[Further down the dock. The boys keep walking, and Cartman runs up to meet them]
CARTMAN
Hey you guys! [they stop] You know what time of year it is?
KYLE
Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween.
CARTMAN
That's right, and that means only two more months till Christmas! You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry—
STAN
Christmas?
CARTMAN
—Christmastime is presents for me.
[On another part of the dock, Jimbo and Ned leave a ticket booth]
JIMBO
Aw, nuts! Come on, Ned, this ain't no whore house, it's a hor-ROR house.
GUESTS IN LINE
Awwww! [all leave. The boys walk by]
CARTMAN
Eeyyy [Kyle stops, the others walk away], Spooky Laboratory, you guys. ["THIS WAY TO SPOOKY LABORATORY" The entrance doors are stained with blood]
KYLE
[annoyed] Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff.
CARTMAN
Well, I'm going to Spooky Laboratory! [throws open the doors and enters] Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells...
GUIDE
Welcome to Spooky Laboratory. [pulls out a blindfold and puts it over Cartman's eyes] I'm your guide, Dr. Spookalot. Allow me to show around the lab. [leads him to a table on which is a bowl of eggs and a bowl of lime Jell-o cubes]
CARTMAN
Cool!
DR. SPOOKALOT
[helps him up to a chair] Here I have a bowl of human eyeballs.
CARTMAN
[rolls his fingers around the eggs] Ewww-hoohooo.
DR. SPOOKALOT
[switches bowls] And here you can feel the brains.
CARTMAN
[rolls his fingers through the lime Jell-o cubes] Oh-HO, grohoss.
DR. SPOOKALOT
[leads him to an ass] And here you can feel the warm innards of the body [Cartman reaches into the ass's ass and the ass looks surprised]
CARTMAN
Eewww, it feels like cold spaghetti! You guys, it feels like cold spaghetti!
[Stan, Kyle, and Kenny walk past a shack on which hangs a banner: "COSTUME CONTEST TOMORROW"]
KENNY
(You guys, I'm gonna try and win that costume contest!)
KYLE
[two older boys peek out from behind some boxes, then drop down] Give it up, Kenny! You're not gonna win that costume contest! Your costumes always suck. [the boy with his picture on the shirt pops out and faces them]
BOY IN GREEN SHIRT
BOO!
STAN, KYLE, KENNY
Aaaaah! [they turn and run around in circles]
BOY IN GREEN SHIRT
Ha ha ha ha ha! We scared you, chickens!
STAN
W-we weren't scared!
BOY IN GREEN SHIRT
Oh no? Well, you should be! [walks towards them] The pirate ghosts are gonna come getcha!
KYLE
The what?
BOY IN GREEN SHIRT
Didn't you know? There's an old legend in South Park that says these docks are haunted by pirate ghosts.
KYLE
Nuh-uh.
BOY IN GREEN SHIRT
Yuh-huh. They roam these docks with their swords and hook-hands [molds his left hand into a hook] looking for victims tuh... [swipes it through the air] cut up!
KENNY
[Kyle gasps] (Hoh!)
STAN
That's just an old legend.
PIRATE GHOST CUTOUT
[pops up] Rar!
STAN, KYLE, KENNY
Aaaaah! [they turn and run around in circles]
BOY IN GREEN SHIRT
[the cutout drops to reveal another friend] Ha ha ha ha, gotcha again, heh ha ha! [both his friends flank him now] Just wait till tomorrow! We're gonna scare you kids to death! Ha ha ha haa! [the three move away]
CARTMAN
[arrives] You guys, my hand totally smells like spaghetti now. Smell it. [starts sniffing it]
STAN
I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them!
KYLE
Yeah! Let's see how they like it!
[The KOZY-FM booth. The DJ is joined by the town's priest]
DJ
Joining me now is Father Maxi, from the South Park Church. Father, what do you think of all the preparations here at the docks?
PRIEST MAXI
Halloween is an abomination of God! A celebration of the occult-eh!
DJ
Yeah, and how about KoRn playing the big concert tomorrow? Pretty exciting, huh?
PRIEST MAXI
KoRn is a devil-worshiping group that plays violent music! If we allow that demon band to play on this most unholy of holidays, we may incur the full wrath of evil!
DJ
Alriight, we'll see you tomorrow for Halloween! In the meantime [suddenly soft] here's a KOZY hit by Barry Manilow.
[The lake. The boys are still on the docks...]
STAN
Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary.
CARTMAN
We could get a big scary plastic spider, and dangle it in front of them on a string... s- spooky spider, that's pretty scary.
KYLE
That's not scary, fatass!
STAN
Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts! [all turn left and walk off. As they walk towards the shore, they pass a shack. After they pass, three pirate ghosts peek out from behind the shack, scowling]
PIRATE GHOSTS
Darrrr!
[The woods. A van rumbles down a road. On the side it reads, "KoRn." Several men inside it talk]
JONATHAN
Are you sure we're goin' the right way?
DAVID
I don't know. This map doesn't make any sense.
HEAD
That's because you've got it upside down, chowderhead! [canned laughter]
DAVID
[spins the map around and realizes his error] Oops.
FIELDY
When are we gonna get to the gig? I'm starving.
JONATHAN
Don't think about it. We'll just keep playing our game. Ready? I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter T!
MUNKY
I know! A t-ree!
JONATHAN
You've got it. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter R.
DAVID
A road?
JONATHAN
That's it! [they pass the South Park Docks sign, and then the three pirate ghosts show up to watch]
PIRATES
Darrrr!
[further down the road...]
JONATHAN
Okay, here's one. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter P.
HEAD
The letter P?
FIELDY
What the heck starts with the letter P?
JONATHAN
[trembling] Puh-pirate ghosts! [the ghosts appear in front of the van]
ALL
Aaaaah! [the van swerves left to avoid the ghosts, but ends up going over a hillside. It finally settles upside down at the foot of the hill]
[The Cartman house. Cartman walks towards the sofa with a catalog in hand]
CARTMAN
Mom! You got the new Duffy's catalog! I-I'm gonna circle everything I want for Christmas, okay? Mom? Okay? O-kay [sits on the sofa], let's see. [softly] I waant... thiis... aand... this... [a truck] and... [flips the page] let's see, comes with so... [the Phillip doll. The doorbell rings] ...comes with two bars [circles the boxed doll], so there we go, have that... [a door opens in the background] and, let's see...
LIANE
[walks up to him] Eric, your little friends are here.
CARTMAN
[excited, motions with the catalog] Mom, mom! You wanna see what I want for Christmas?
LIANE
E-heric, it's only Halloween.
CARTMAN
That's only 72 shopping days left for you!
STAN
[walks up with Kyle and Kenny] Come on, fatass, we have to go!
CARTMAN
Ey! Don't call me fat! [Liane starts to giggle. Cartman is hurt] Mom, don't laugh.
LIANE
I'm sorry, hon,
CARTMAN
[to his friends] I can't go with you guys right now.
STAN
Yes you can, porky. [Liane giggles again]
CARTMAN
Mom, seriously! [her giggles die down]
LIANE
Oh, that's not funny, boys. Eric isn't fat, he's big-boned.
KYLE
He must have a huge bone in his ass, then. [Liane bursts out laughing]
CARTMAN
God-damnit, mom!
[Outside, night. The boys head out and away]
CARTMAN
[closes the door] God, I hate you guys!
STAN
Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders.
CARTMAN
How?
STAN
What's the scariest thing we could get?
CARTMAN
[quietly] Spooky spider?
STAN
No! [turns, then says gravely] A dead body.
KYLE
Yeah, fatass, a dead body.
CARTMAN
You mean, we make something that looks like a dead body?
STAN
We could never make one that looks real enough. [his voice lowers] To be really scary, it would have to be real.
KYLE
Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!
CARTMAN
So where the hell are we going to get a dead body?
STAN
[voice low] We're gonna dig up Kyle's dead grandma.
KYLE
Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up- [stops] Dig up Kyle's dead grandma??
STAN
[appeasing] Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right?
KYLE
Are you insane?!
CARTMAN
U-hi think that's a sweet idea!
KENNY
(Yeah!)
KYLE
Dude! We're not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble.
STAN
All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone,
KYLE
[uneasy] Naww, let's dig up somebody else.
STAN
Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to.
CARTMAN
This is gonna be fun!
[The graveyard. Spooky music and a howling wolf punctuate the foggy atmosphere as a full moon rises. Kyle leads the way with a flashlight. Cartman is singing]
CARTMAN
Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-in', ring ting tingle-in' too
Outside it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, and you, and you.
STAN
Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted!
KYLE
[shines his light on a tombstone] This must be it. "Cleo Broflovski" That's my grandma. [turns off the light. The boys have a moment of silence]
STAN
Well, let's dig 'er up! [walks to the grave and jabs his shovel in]
KYLE
Wait. I don't know if this is cool.
STAN
Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!
KYLE
I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.
CARTMAN
[taunting] "Ooh, I don't wanna dig up my dead grandma 'cause I'm such a goody-two-shoes!" [Kyle smacks him with the shovel] Ow.
STAN
You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?!
KYLE
I don't really care, dude.
STAN
Yes you do! Now, dig! [all four begin to dig]
CARTMAN
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, "You-hoo"...
[Later. The casket is now vertical, leaning against the tombstone]
STAN
Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three! [they pry the door open, and then jump back and peer in] Whoa, dude.
KYLE
Oh, my God. [the corpse sways to the right, against the casket wall] Hi, ...Grandma.
A VOICE
Hi, Kyle.
KYLE
[hops back] Aaaah!
CARTMAN
[providing the voice] Have you been a good boy, Kyle? Have you been making Grandma proud?
KYLE
Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny!
STAN
[chuckling] Eheh, yes, it ihis, heh.
CARTMAN
Heh heh, I'm sweet.
KYLE
Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!
STAN
Okay, grab the sled. [Kenny goes and pulls it up. The others stand aside. When the sled abuts the casket, Cartman pulls at the corpse with his shovel, and it falls forward onto the sled]
[The docks. A dog is sniffing at the boards, then raises his head. He growls and runs off stage left. The boys come in from the other side pulling the corpse, and Cartman sings]
CARTMAN
Silver Bells, Silver Bells, it's Christmas time in the city...
STAN
Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders.
KYLE
How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?
CARTMAN
We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet: "Rowr, rowr, I'm scary Grandma!"
KYLE
Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!
MALE VOICE
[off screen] O-o-o-o-oh. [thunderclaps. The boys are afraid.]
STAN
Who was that?
KYLE
Cartman?!
CARTMAN
It wasn't me! [camera pans to the corpse]
MALE VOICE
Who-o-oa.
STAN
Dude, not cool. This is scary. [Some rustling, and a member of KoRn shows up]
THE BOYS
Wa-a-a-ah!
MUNKY
Hey! Like, it's just some kids.
JONATHAN
Oh, fwooh, I was really scared there, for a second.
STAN
Hay, you're that band KoRn.
JONATHAN
Yeah. I'm Jonathan [with the high forehead], and this is Munky [with chiseled looks], David [with thick eyebrows], Fieldy [short, with white cap], and Head [with dreadlocks]. And over there is our pal, Nibblet. [the mates look around] Hey, where'd Nibblet go?
NIBBLET
[a yellow bird with curled antennae and a great wing span ripping into a bag of chips] Uh-huh, Nibblet likes potato chips.
KORN
Nibblet!
NIBBLET
[stops] Okay.
STAN
What are you guys doing out here?
HEAD
We were just driving our van when all of a sudden we were run off the road by some super-spooky pirate ghosts.
STAN
Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders.
KYLE
Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.
STAN
Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.
JONATHAN
Oh, swell. We're supposed to play here tomorrow. Do you know where the stage is?
STAN
[points to it] Yeah, dude. It's right over there.
KORN
O-kay! [they walk away and pass by the priest, who is nailing a post into place: "Halloween is Anti-God." He stops.]
JONATHAN
Oh, hi. We're KoRn. We're supposed to play the Halloween concert tomorrow.
PRIEST MAXI
I know who you are and what you stand for! I think your music and Halloween is an abomination!
JONATHAN
Groovy! Could you show us where to set up?
[The boys walk a little further, and Cartman pulls the sled over to one side of a stack of boxes]
STAN
Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes. [Cartman hides the body behind the boxes]
KYLE
Shouldn't we hide her better than that?
STAN
Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go! [they start walking away]
KYLE
Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet!
KENNY
(Mine is so fuckin' badass it's gotta win now!)
CARTMAN
Oh, come on, Kenny! You never have a sweet costume! You're not gonna win the costume contest!
KENNY
(Yes I am! I've got the costume; it's waiting in the house! Yesterday I got this huge package in the mail, and it was big, okay?) [The dog returns and sniffs the body from a distance. It approaches slowly, sniffing. Then it lifts the covering and drags the body away.]
[The next day. Two uniformed men approach the Broflovski house. One of them rings the bell.]
SHEILA
Hold on, kids. [grabs the candy bowl next to the door and opens the door with it in hand]
BRUNET
Mrs. Broflovski?
SHEILA
Yes?
BRUNET
We're from Mt. Peaceful Cemetery. Could we have a word with you?
SHEILA
Eehh, sure, come in. [they follow her in and sit on the sofa. She takes the armchair, and they look at each other] What is it?
BRUNET
Ms. Broflovski... somebody has defiled your mother's grave.
SHEILA
Defiled? How?
BLOND
Well, I'm afraid that... somebody dug her up.
SHEILA
Dug her up? Why??
BRUNET
Well. The- most likely reason is that... somebody wanted to have sex with her dead body.
BLOND
Yeahp.
SHEILA
What?!
BRUNET
Uhuh, we don't want to upset you, but it happens. Somebody's probably making love to her corpse as we speak.
BLOND
Every vile position, every disrespectful act imaginable.
SHEILA
Hoh, dear God!
BRUNET
Yes. By now he's probably even removed her eyes and made love to the empty sockets as well.
SHEILA
[sadly rubs her eyes] Oooh.
BLOND
No-, we don't want to upset you, but you should know that your mother's body would be stiff and dry, so he would have to have it soaked in warm water for several hours before making love to it.
SHEILA
[helplessly] O-o-o-o-oh!
BRUNET
Yes. And, now for the difficult part.
BLOND
Brace yourself.
BRUNET
It is highly possible that he has created new orifices in her decomposing flesh, leaving her to look something like — an overloved hunk of Swiss cheese. She probably-
SHEILA
Okay, okay! I get the point! Just tell me what you're gonna do about it!
BRUNET
...Do?
BLOND
Oh, we don't do anything. We're just the watchmen.
BRUNET
Yeah, I guess, maybe, you might wanna call the police or something.
SHEILA
O-o-ogh! [gets up and walks away. The men just sit there]
BRUNET
[to the blond] Now, he probably would make love to the dead body in a cool dry place, so as not to allow further decomposition. [the blond indicates he's thinking by placing his index finger to his lips]
[The Cartman house. A delivery man walks towards it with a package and rings the bell. Cartman answers]
DELIVERY MAN
Package delivery for Mrs. Cartman?
CARTMAN
A package? Oh, really? Well, I think I can sign for that!
DELIVERY MAN
Sign heah, and heah, and heah. [Cartman signs and the delivery man goes away. Cartman closes the door and dances with glee]
CARTMAN
I got a Christmas present! I got a Christmas present! [stops] ...Maybe I can see what it is. I'll just open one little corner. [lifts up a corner of the wrapping] Let's see here. [yanks the wrapping off and away] That's good, I'll rewrap it later! [the box reads, "LIFESIZED Blow-Up ANTONIO BANDERAS LOVE DOLL. WITH REALISTIC GENITALIA"] Oh, sweet! Life-sized blow-up Antonio Banderas love doll! With realistic geni-ta-lia. [takes the doll out] Oh, this kicks ass! What a cool Christmas present my mom got! [blows it up through the penis]
[The lake. The docks are bustling again, and the DJ is in his booth]
DJ
It's Halloween day, so come on down to the docks and bring your costumes! [a ghost and Ultraman walk by while a joker stands next to the boxes. Stan and Kyle are nearby in their costumes]
STAN
[a cowboy sheriff in white] Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever. [Kyle is a clown in a yellow jacket]
CARTMAN
[walks up with the doll and jingles] Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.
STAN
Where's your costume, fatass?
CARTMAN
Screw Halloween, I already got my Christmas present! In a few days I'll wrap it back up, and then when I open it on Christmas, I'll act all, like, surprised, like "Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll! What a surprise!" [heavy machinery is heard, and the boys look up to see an ED-209 unit walking towards them. It stops, turns, and settles into place]
STAN
Hey, Kenny.
KENNY
(Hey, guys. Uh, check out this kick-ass cool costume.)
CARTMAN
U-huh, nice costume, Kenny. If you think you're gonna win with that, huh!
STAN
[rushes his friends along] Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma! [Cartman goes for the sled] This is gonna be sweet
CARTMAN
[pulls out the sled, but the body is gone] Uuh, problem, guys.
STAN
What's the problem?
CARTMAN
Nno Grandma.
KYLE
No Grandma??
CARTMAN
Nno Grandma.
KYLE
[turns and reaches the sled. Stan turns as well] She's not here!
STAN
She has to be here! [Kenny meanders]
KYLE
Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!
[City Hall, outside. Officer Barbrady stands behind a podium addressing the crowd]
BARBRADY
Okay, people. I know we all want to get down to the docks for the Halloween Haunt, but first we just need to inform you about thee- people or persons out there digging up bodies to have sex with them. Gentlemen? [leaves. The watchmen step up]
BRUNET
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. A person who steals bodies to have sex with them is called a necrophiliac. So that you all know what to expect, my partner Alan has a sketch of what having sex with a dead body might look like. [Alan shows the sketch]
CROWD
Ee-oooh!
BRUNET
Yes, we know it's horrible. It's probably best you not look at it. Now, Alan will demonstrate what having sex with a dead body might sound like. [Alan pulls out a jar of mayonnaise and jams his fist into it, proceeding to simulate the act. He begins to look surprised at what he's doing as his arm gets covered with mayonnaise]
CROWD
Awwwgh! [Alan continues]
MAN
Excuse me, how is this helping?
BARBRADY
That's it, folks. Now, we can all go to the docks and enjoy the Halloween Haunt.
PIRATE VOICE
Noo! Don't go to the docks! [the camera looks up to see a pirate ghost floating outside the Mayor's office] Aarrrgh! [the crowd gasps and screams] Argh, I'm Captain Bly! You land-lubbers had better stay away from the docks! Or else, there'll be hell to pay! [the crowd is afraid. Women scream] Fire the cannon! [a pirate ship appears high above the road, and a cannon goes off. The ball lands amid the crowd and leaves a crater. Bodies are strewn all over] Har harharharhar! [the crowd disperses. A couple runs into another pirate ghost]
PIRATE GHOST 2
Arrrgh! [slices their heads off with his sword]
CAPTAIN BLY
We won't warn ya again! Stay away from our docks! [the pirates and their ship disappear]
PRIEST MAXI
[rushed to the podium] I warned you! I told you this would happen! [survivors sit up and begin to look his way] When you allow bands like KoRn to come to town and play your hedonistic Halloween concerts, this is what you get!
[The docks. KoRn is practicing on stage.]
JONATHAN
Great rehearsal, gang. That was really groovy. Let's practice one more time before the show starts.
DJ
Aah, guys, I'm sorry, but the Halloween Haunt's been cancelled.
JONATHAN
Cancelled?
DJ
You best clear out of here! There's pirate ghosts, and they'll kill you. [leaves]
JONATHAN
Well gang, it looks like we have to pack it up.
THE OTHERS
Awww. [Stan and friends walk towards the stage]
KYLE
God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!
MUNKY
Oh, hey! The kids from last night.
HEAD
Wow! Is that the Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll? [Kenny catches up with his friends]
DAVID
Hey, Kenny.
KENNY
[frustrated] (Aw, man!) [he can't impress anyone]
JONATHAN
Say, what's the matter? You kids look kind of glum.
KYLE
Somebody took my dead grandma.
FIELDY
What?
STAN
We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away.
KYLE
Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo. [starts to sob]
FIELDY
Aw, I hate to see little clowns cry.
JONATHAN
Well, that does it. Somethin' funny is going on here. Your missing grandma must be connected somehow to those creepy pirate ghosts.
DAVID
They're not pirate ghosts, Jonathan, they're ghost pirates.
JONATHAN
Huh?
DAVID
"Pirate ghost" would suggest that a pirate died, and became a ghost, but a ghost pirate is a ghost that later made a conscious decision to be a pirate.
MUNKY
No, David. Then they are pirate ghosts, because they're the ghosts of pirates.
FIELDY
You're wrong, because there were no pirates in Colorado. So these must be ghosts that have decided to become pirates after the fact.
JONATHAN
But that makes them pirate ghosts.
DAVID
No. It makes them ghost pirates.
MUNKY
Pirate ghosts!
HEAD
Guys! Guys! Guys! Fighting isn't gonna solve anything. Don't you see? This is exactly what those ghost pirates want us to do.
JONATHAN
Pirate ghosts.
KYLE
Then, you'll help us?
JONATHAN
Sure, we'll help you. If there's one thing we like more than playing music, it's solvin' a groovy mystery.
THE BOYS
Al-right!
[City Hall. People are still laying on floor. Chef arrives]
CHEF
Is everybody okay?
SHEILA
[people gather around Chef] People stealing bodies to have sex with them? Pirate ghosts destroying the town? When did everything go so wrong?
GERALD
I hate to say it, but I think Priest Maxi was right. This is what we get for celebrating Halloween and allowing that band KoRn to come play.
MR. GARRISON
He's right! Nothin' ever went wrong in this town before that evil KoRn band showed up.
SHARON
Well, I say we go find them and kick their devil-worshiping butts out of town!
CROWD
Yeah! [various exclamations follow]
RANDY
Lynch mob! [torches and pitch forks appear and the crowd begins to move]
MAN
Down with KoRn!
[Halloween night, the docks. KoRn and the boys are still talking...]
JONATHAN
So this is where you last saw your dead grandma.
KYLE
Right. [Kenny walks along the shore way in the background]
STAN
Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside.
JONATHAN
Alright, gang, we have to split up and look for clues.
STAN
How should we split up?
JONATHAN
I know. Let's have everyone who enjoys having obstacles in their life, which they can overcome, go this way, [points to his right] and everyone whose insecurities sabotage their potential to overcome those obstacles go that way. [points to his left]
KORN
O-kay! [the groups separates in two. In the secure group are Stan, Kyle, Jonathan, Munky, and Fieldy. In the insecure group are Cartman, Kenny, David, and Head]
KYLE
Wow! That was easy.
[The lynch mob reaches the docks and head for the van. Randy reaches it first.]
RANDY
[excitedly] Here's their van! Here's their van!
WOMAN
Let's flip it over!
SOME FOLKS
Yeah!
BARBRADY
[moves to intervene] Okay, people, let's try to stay orderly. The best way to do this is, all get on one side and push it from the top. [the crowd moves in and starts pushing. Even Barbrady participates]
MAN
Devil worshipers! [the van tips over]
CROWD
Yeah!
MAN 2
Come on, they gotta be around here somewhere!
[A warehouse. The secure group walks along with Nibblet. Munky is not with them.]
STAN
This place gives me the creeps.
JONATHAN
Say, this looks like a clue. [picks up a book: "Pirate Lore of South Park, By A.R.R. Robbins"] "Pirate Lore of South Park." Hmmm. Now, why would pirate ghosts need a book on pirates? [something metallic falls]
KYLE
Whoa. What was that?
JONATHAN
The noise came from in here. Stay close, everybody! [opens a door and goes in. The rest follow]
FIELDY
[runs into a supporting pole] Oh, no! I lost my glasses.
[The insecure group walks in a darkened part of the warehouse. Munky is in that group now.]
HEAD
What does this dead grandma look like?
CARTMAN
Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff.
DAVID
Hey, I got an idea. [all stop] We should set a groovy trap.
MUNKY
Good idea.
CARTMAN
How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?
DAVID
We need something that might catch their eye to use as bait. I know, your Antonio Banderas love doll.
CARTMAN
[holds the doll tight] Oh, no! This is my Christmas present! If anything happens to it, my mom will know I opened it early!
MUNKY
Come on, kid. We all have to do our part, even Antonio.
[The lit side of the warehouse. Fieldy is still looking for his glasses]
FIELDY
My glasses gotta be around here somewhere. [a peg-legged pirate ghost appears next to him] Is that you, Jonathan? Boy, I'm glad to see you. I lost my glasses.
PEG-LEG
Raaarrrgh!
FIELDY
Hey, you got a cold, Jonathan?
PEG-LEG
Raarraarrgh! [canned laughter]
FIELDY
Yeah, that sounds like a groovy song, man! Remember that one! [more canned laughter]
JONATHAN
[from the other end of the room] Fieldy, what are you doing?!
FIELDY
[turns to face him] Oh, I was talking to you, Jonathan. ...Hey, wait a minute. If you're over there, then how could you be over here? Unless you're actually a...
ALL
Puh-puuhh pirate ghost! [all scatter]
PEG-LEG
Raaarrrgh!
[The darkened part of the warehouse. The trap is set]
DAVID
Okay. Here's how the trap will work. When the pirate ghosts walk in, they should go right for Antonio Banderas. [the camera now follows the trap as David describes it] When they hit the super-slippery floor, they'll slide onto this mining cart, which should travel down this path, into the next room, where the fish net will fall on them.
CARTMAN
Wow, cool!
MUNKY
Hey! Somebody's coming. [everyone jumps back behind some boxes]
SECURE GROUP
Aaaaah!
STAN
We've got to hide!
JONATHAN
Hey, there's Antonio Banderas! He'll help us. [calls out] Mr. Banderas!
DAVID
[peeks up] Jonathan, no!
SECURE GROUP
[hits the slick] Aaaah! [the trap works exactly as David said it would]
HEAD
Oh, no!
SECURE GROUP
Aaaah! [the cart hits the wall and stops. The insecure group rushes in]
STAN
Ow!
DAVID
Hold on, guys! [the lynch mob, led by the watchmen, bursts through the doors and moves in on the group]
BRUNET
Alright, KoRn, time for you to get out of town! [the pirate ghosts appear]
PIRATE GHOSTS
Aarrrrgh.
CROWD
[frightened] Aaaaaah!
RANDY
KoRn is sending their demon minions upon us!
CROWD
[shrieking] Aaaaaah!
JONATHAN
[to his band mates] Alright, gang. Looks like we're gonna have to use our special KoRn powers. [the five members huddle and link hands to forearms] KoRn powers, vitalize! [starbursts abound as each member transforms]
MUNKY
Munky!
DAVID
David!
FIELDY
Fieldy!
HEAD
Head!
JONATHAN
Jonathan!
KORN
Form of... CORN! [final starbursts give way to various corn products: two corncobs, a tub of popcorn, a can of creamed corn, and one corn kernel. The tub of popcorn swells and spits out several popped kernels. The townsfolk just stare and the corn products stay still. The pirates are seen staring. Soon, the products revert to the band mates]
JONATHAN
Alright! Great job, gang! [The townsfolk stare]
CARTMAN
That didn't help at all.
HEAD
We know. It's just cool to do.
PIRATE GHOSTS
Aarrrrgh!
NIBBLET
[floating up to release the net] Nibblet! [releases the net, and it lands on the pirate ghosts]
KORN
[grateful] Nibblet!
BARBRADY
What the hell is that thing??
DAVID
You did it, Nibblet! You trapped them!
JONATHAN
[approaches the net] Yeah. And now let's see who these pirate ghosts really are! [the ghosts disappear, and he throws his palms up] Oh, I guess they really were pirate ghosts.
BARBRADY
[approaches with gun drawn] Alright, KoRn, you can stop your demonic shenanigans and come downtown with me!
NIBBLET
[notices some twine hanging from two trap doors on the ceiling] Hehey, look what Nibblet sees. [pulls on the twine, and the doors open. Priest Maxi falls to the ground]
PRIEST MAXI
Whoa! [lands with a thud]
CHEF
What the...?
MAN
Father Maxi?
PRIEST MAXI
[gets up] Well, what are you waiting for, Barbrady?! Arrest that band!
BARBRADY
Oh?
JONATHAN
No! Arrest him!
MOB
Huh??
JONATHAN
I think I've got this groovy mystery solved!
[Outside. The mystery has apparently been explained. The priest is now under arrest]
CHEF
Well, I must say I still don't get this at all.
JONATHAN
It's simple. Priest Maxi didn't want there to be a Halloween, so he decided to scare everyone away from the docks.
DAVID
Yeah. And then he used this flashlight and some cotton swabs to create the ghosts. [shows the flashlight and swabs, then shines the light through the swabs. The pirate ghosts appear in the distance]
FIELDY
[with some cheese and a cup] Then all he needed was some sound effects created by this cup and a piece of cheese. [holds them to his mouth and sounds] Aaaaraargh!
JONATHAN
And all he had to do then was create a ghost ship, by using some candles, a mirror, and two squirrels. [genuflects to place the candle between the mirror and the squirrels. A pirate ship appears on the lake]
CHEF
Father, why did you go to all this trouble?
PRIEST MAXI
Because Halloween is an abomination of God. I would do anything to stop this wretched, unholy holiday!
CHEF
Including killing people and wreaking havoc all over South Park?
BRUNET
Don't you see that by trying to stop Halloween you've scared the hell out of everybody?
PRIEST MAXI
No.
BARBRADY
Okay buddy, you can explain downtown! [takes the priest away]
SHEILA
Well, this is all fine and good, but it doesn't explain what happened to my mother's body!
KYLE
Yeah! Where's Grandma? [the dog walks in and begins regurgitating. First, the head comes out]
MOB
Eeewww! [the rest of the body comes out]
STAN
There she is!
MOB
Oooh!
MAN
Ho-hoh.
CHEF
Well thanks a lot, KoRn! You KoRn powers really came through for us!
SHARON
Yes! We were wrong about you. Will you please play for our Halloween party?
JONATHAN
Well, sure. Why the heck not?
MOB
All right! [the pirate cutout is hoisted up on two poles]
PIRATE VOICE
Raarrrr!
STAN
Oh, no! The pirate ghosts are back! [the cutout shakes and falls away, revealing Nibblet]
ALL
Nibblet!
NIBBLET
Uh oh!
[The stage on the docks. KoRn is preparing for their concert. The mob is spread out in front of the stage. Jonathan takes the mic.]
JONATHAN
Well, this sure has been a wacky night, but me and the gang learned a lot, and we hope you did too. You all perceived us to be mean, evil people, but, really, we're just normal guys. And we all perceived pirate ghosts to be real when, actually, they were just cotton swabs. So I guess the lesson is: it's easy to perceive somethin' someway, and then be wrong. So we all need to learn to be a little less perceptive.
ALL
[reflecting] Yeah.
JONATHAN
The gang and I wrote a song about it, and it goes goes a little somethin' like this:
And a-one, and-a-two, and a [goes right into "Falling Away From Me." The strobe lights come on, and the crowd looks a little stunned. The fifth graders are at the very front of the crowd, and the body of Grandma Broflovski inches up to them]
STAN
Boo!
FIFTH GRADERS
Aaaah! [they run away]
STAN, KYLE
Sweet! [Nibblet floats up to the Antonio Banderas blow-up doll and punctures it. It deflates, alerting Cartman]
CARTMAN
Antonio, no! [sees Nibblet and goes after it] You son of a bitch chicken from outer space... thing, come back here! [KoRn continues playing. At another part of the docks, Mr. Garrison holds court over the Halloween Costume Contest. Kenny is present]
MR. GARRISON
And the winner of the costume contest is [reads the name] Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume! Come on up, Wendy. [she rushes up and stands next to him]
KENNY
[droops] (Awww.)
[End of KORN's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery... Wait a minute! Dejected, Kenny walks away slowly from the crowd. A tiny snowspeeder flies by and wraps a cable around his costume's legs. He begins to stumble]
KENNY
(What the hell? What the fuck is this?!) [two more speeders fly by and bomb him to bits, and rats converge on him.]
End of Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery

synopsis:To help Cartman win the school spelling bee, Cartman's Mom gives him the Hooked on Monkey Fonics spelling system.

script:Hooked on Monkey Fonics

[The Cartman house, night. Liane brings a box into the dining room.]
LIANE
[sets the box down on the floor] Eric, Mommy got you a present!
CARTMAN
[suddenly excited] A present?? Is it a rocket racer?? No, let me guess: It's a Frogman Jay doll! No wait, I know! It's a police power chopper!
LIANE
Nnno, I got you something that's going to help you win the big spelling bee tomorrow.
CARTMAN
[drops and sighs heavily] Mom, I'm not going to win the spelling bee; I never do.
LIANE
This year is gonna be different. Look! [places the box on the table] I got you "Hooked On Monkey Fonics." [mom and son look at each other]
CARTMAN
[after a while] What the hell is "Hooked On Monkey Fonics?"
LIANE
It's a new way to learn how to read and spell. And it comes with everything you need to help win that spelling bee. [unpacks the contents: two cassette tapes, a tiny drum set, an owner's manual, and a live monkey. The monkey chatters] It says we just put the cassette into a tape player [does it, and presses the Play button. A glissant plays, and the monkey sits behind the drum set]
FEMALE VOICE
Welcome to "Hooked On Monkey Fonics," level 1. I will read the sounds and the monkey will help keep the beat. [Liane smiles] If your monkey arrived in the box dead, call 1-800-555-4500 to get a new monkey. Ready? Let's begin. [glissant. The monkey plays. A little rap follows]
The learning monkey is here to say
That reading is easy and it's okay.[Liane starts swaying like a metronome]
Work with the monkey and you will learn
To spell hard words, like "morbid" and "fern."
Start with Card 1. [Liane holds it up] Ready? Begin! [glissant] C, H. [a "ch" sound] Chalk. [the monkey plays four beats more, then turns to Cartman. One more beat...]
CARTMAN
[finally responds, keeping the beat] C, H. "Ch." Chalk.
FEMALE VOICE
Good. Card 2. [Liane holds it up] T, H. [a hard "th"] There.
CARTMAN
T, H. "Th." There.
Hey, this is easy! [raps] I'm gonna win the spelling bee for sure, Mom!
[South Park, next day. A stage has been set up in front of the rebuilt library, and the adults are there to watch. A banner over it reads: The 15th Annual South Park Spelling Bee Finals]
[On stage, back row, are Wendy, Kevin, Annie, Clyde, Butters and Bebe. In the front row are Tolkien, a new boy, an empty chair, Kyle, Stan, and Cartman. Off to the left, Mr. Mackey will keep score, but doesn't look at all happy about it. The Mayor is front and center]
MAYOR
All right, everyone. Welcome to the 15th Annual South Park Spelling Bee Finals! [the crowd cheers. The Mayor walks over and stands next to Mr. Mackey. The new boy is gone!] This should be very interesting. We have with us twelve of the brightest spellers from South Park Elementary.
JIMBO
Kyle, Kyle, he's our man. If he can't win it, I'm out 50 bucks.
GERALD
You bet money on my son to win?!
JIMBO
Sure! When it comes to spelling bees, always bet on the Jew.
CARTMAN
You're going down, bitch!
KYLE
Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you.
CARTMAN
Yeah, well this year I have a secret weapon! [signals something with a thumbs-up. The monkey and drums are next to him, on the floor.]
MAYOR
And, joining us this year, are the two home-schooled children, Rebecca and Mark Cotswolds! [they enter...]
JIMBO
What?! [...and take their seats]
CARTMAN
Home-schooled kids? Who the hell are they?
JIMBO
Ey, that's not fair! You can't let home-schooled kids into a public-school spelling bee!
KYLE
What's a "home-schooled kid"?
STAN
I don't know, dude. I've never seen them before. [the left side of the groups is shown. Mark, the new kid seen earlier, sits next to Tolkien, and Rebecca takes the aisle seat. The others in their section study them.]
THE COTSWOLDS
[cheering] Go, Mark! Go, Rebecca!
MAYOR
[reads, then] Our first contestant is Mark Cotswolds, from home school. [he steps on the platform] All right, Mark. Your word is "conscientious."
CARTMAN
What?! What the fuck that that mean?
MARK
"Conscientious." May I have the definition, please?
MAYOR
Closely attentive to details. Careful.
MARK
"Conscientious." Could you use it in a sentence, please?
MAYOR
Mary's analysis of the spreadsheet was... conscientious.
MARK
"Conscientious." C O N S C I E N T I O U S.
CARTMAN
[as the bell rings] Holy crap! [the crowd is stunned]
THE COTSWOLDS
Way to go, Mark! Alright!
MAYOR
Okay, our next contestant is Eric Cartman. [he goes to the platform, smiling] Alright, Eric, here's your word: chair. Chaaiirr. [he looks to the monkey, who's minding its own business]
CARTMAN
Come on, Fonics Monkey, drum! [it looks around] Come on! [it begins to drum something else, getting excited. Cartman looks resigned]
MAYOR
Eric, your word is "chair."
CARTMAN
Uuh. Definition?
MAYOR
Something you sit on.
CARTMAN
Country of origin?
MAYOR
English! [the angrier she gets, the more afraid Mr. Mackey looks]
CARTMAN
Could you please use it in a sentence?
MAYOR
Oh, for Christ's sake, kid! The word is "chair"!!
CARTMAN
Uh- chair. C H A R E [the buzzer sounds and Eric panics] God damnit, how come I get the hard ones?! [races off the stage] Get over here, you son of a bitch Fonics Monkey!
[The spelling bee. After several rounds, the other kids are eliminated. The Cotswolds kids and Kyle are the only ones left.]
MAYOR
All right, we're down to just three finalists. First up is Rebecca Cotswolds from home school. [Rebecca takes the platform, but casts her eyes down and away from the mayor. She nervously taps her hands together] Alright, Rebecca. Here's your word: littoral.
REBECCA
[voice quivering] "Litoral." Deh-finition?
MAYOR
Having to do with a lake or ocean.
REBECCA
"Litoral." Will you please use it in a sentence?
MAYOR
Gary was most interested in the littoral features of Michigan.
REBECCA
"Littoral." [Before saying each letter, she opens her hands like a book, whispers the letter into them, and closes them] L I T O R A L
MAYOR
[sounding the little bell] Correct!
KYLE
[softly] Wow! [he's impressed]
MR. COTSWOLDS
[both parents clap] Alright, Rebecca. Good job, honey. [she takes her seat]
MAYOR
Now we have Kyle Broflovski. [he takes the platform] Here we go. Krocsyldiphithic.
KYLE
What??
MAYOR
Krocsyldiphithic.
KYLE
Definition?
MAYOR
Something which has a krocsyldiph-like quality.
KYLE
Uh, could you use it in a sentence?
MAYOR
Certainly. "Krocsyldiphithic" is a hard word to spell.
KYLE
"Krocsyldiphic."
JIMBO
You can do it, kid! You can do it!
KYLE
"Krocsyldiphic." C [the buzzer cuts him off] Damnit!
JIMBO
You little bastard, you cost me fifty bucks. [Stuart, Gerald, Randy, and Ned start carrying him away] Why don't you run away and join the circus, you stupid little son of a bitch?! Aaargh!
MAYOR
Congratulations, Mark and Rebecca. [hand them their trophies] You are truly South Park's finest. [a print photographer takes a picture]
STAN
[standing before the stage with Cartman and Kenny] Damn, dude. Those home-schooled kids are smart.
CARTMAN
Yeah. Too bad they have the personalities of a wet dishcloth. [the finalists come off the stage and stand in front of it.]
KYLE
[walks up to Rebecca] What's your name? [apparently, he wasn't paying attention...]
REBECCA
Guh what's in a name? [turns and walks away]
KYLE
Wooww.
MARK
It was nice competing against you boys. We will have to do it again sometime.
CARTMAN
[mocking] Oh, yes. We must do it again.
STAN
We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something?
MARK
No. I live right over there. [points to a house like any other, but it has bars on its windows] I've lived there all my life.
CARTMAN
How come you don't go to school?
MARK
Because I'm home-schooled.
STAN
What's that?
MARK
My parent teach me. So I stay at home instead of going to school.
CARTMAN
You what? Stay at home? All day? No school?
MARK
Right.
CARTMAN
[waxes poetic]
Who would have thought such a miracle could be?
Who could have known that this moment I would see?
A new way of living, a chance to be free?
STAN
Shut up, Cartman?
CARTMAN
You shut up, [backhand slap] butthole.
STAN
You shut up, [backhand slap] gaywad!
CARTMAN
You shut up, [backhand slap] ass-logger!
MARK
[astonished] Oh my goodness, are you two enemies?
STAN
No, we're friends.
MARK
Strange, friends would call each other names and fight.
STAN
What?
MR. COTSWOLDS
Come, children, let's take our trophies home and place them high up on the mantel. [the family walks away. Kyle looks after Rebecca. Mark looks back at the boys.]
STAN
Dude, what a bunch of freakin' nerdos.
[The Cotswolds house, night. The family is at dinner]
MARK
Papa?
MR. COTSWOLDS
Yes, Mark?
MARK
Why can't I go to school with the other boys?
MRS. COTSWOLDS
[gasps] Oooh.
MR. COTSWOLDS
[leans in on Mark] Well, because, son, public schools are inefficient and dangerous!
MARK
But I want to play with the other children. O, how they laugh and play, Papá.
MRS. COTSWOLDS
Mark, you have play time. You get to play in the afternoon.
MARK
I just feel like I should go to public school, if only for a little while. To see what other little boys are like.
MR. COTSWOLDS
Mark, public schools are no good! Your mother and I were both home-schooled, and we turned out much better because of it.
MARK
Please, Papá. Just let me try it for a few days.
MR. COTSWOLDS
Alright. Fine, Mark! You go ahead and go to public school! You can just find out for yourself how flawed and treacherous it is!
MARK
Hooray!
MR. COTSWOLDS
You don't want to go to public school too, do you, Rebecca?
REBECCA
[voice quivering] Oh, heavens, no.
MR. COTSWOLDS
Well, thank God for that! At least my daughter will remain safe! [the doorbell rings and all look towards it]
KYLE
[Mrs. Cotswolds opens the door] Uh, hi. Is, uh, is Rebecca home?
MRS. COTSWOLDS
Yes she is. [doesn't move]
KYLE
...Uuh, can I talk to her?
MRS. COTSWOLDS
Oh. Well, I suppose so. Rebecca! [Rebecca walks up] This little boy wants to see you.
REBECCA
[with hands in prayer pose] Huhlo? [Kyle looks a little dismayed, as her tapping of hands is a habit. He looks at her mom for any assistance, but sees none. He looks at Rebecca again]
KYLE
U-u-uh, hi. [puts his hands behind his back]
REBECCA
Hel-lo.
KYLE
Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all. [turns and hurries away. Rebecca looks, then goes in. Her mom closes the door]
MR. COTSWOLDS
[walks up] Who was that?
MRS. COTSWOLDS
A little boy wanted to see Rebecca.
MR. COTSWOLDS
[wary] Oh no. I told you the spelling bee was a bad idea.
MRS. COTSWOLDS
But the children won, and they were happy to meet the other children.
MR. COTSWOLDS
Yes, but now I think we may have opened a Pandora's box that we can't close! [they then stand motionless for a while]
[South Park Elementary, day. Mr. Garrison's class. Craig, Butters, and Tweek sit in the front row.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, we have a new student joining us from home school. Now, his parents are very worried about his safety, so please don't be too cruel to him. Mark? [A large plastic ball rolls into class, and Mark is inside driving it. He runs into Craig's chair and stops.]
MARK
Hey, guys. What's up?
CARTMAN
Dude, what's wrong with you? You got some kind of John Travolta disease?
MR. GARRISON
Alright, children, let's just try to pretend there isn't a little boy in a huge plastic hamster ball here, and go on with our studies. Now, who can tell me when Columbus sailed the seas and discovered America? [Mark and Cartman vie to answer] Ehyes, Mark?
CARTMAN
Ey! How come you never pick me?!
MR. GARRISON
Because you never know the right answer, butt-for-brains! Yes, Mark?
MARK
The answer is 1492. However, the Americas had already been discovered by many before him, including the Vikings and the Native Americans. And therefore, your question is a charade.
CARTMAN
Aww, see? That's what I was gonna say!
MR. GARRISON
Well, very impressive, Mark. You should be able to throw the grading curve and flunk all these little bastards. [every kid looks angrily at Mark.]
STAN
Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground.
MR. GARRISON
Now, who can tell me what country Columbus was from? [again, Mark and Cartman vie to answer] Put your hand down, creampuff.
CARTMAN
That does it! [gets off his seat and moves towards the door] I do not need to sit here and be ridiculed! I'm gonna go be home-schooled from now on!
STAN
You don't wanna be home-schooled, fatass.
CARTMAN
I'm gonna be home-schooled, and leave all the pain and suffering of public school behind me! Screw you guys, I'm a-gonna be home-schooled! [leaves and closes the door]
MR. GARRISON
Oh, please God, let it be forever.
[The playground. The recess bell rings and the kids rush out the door. Mark joins them in his huge hamster ball. Beside the jungle gym Stan and Pip stand next to each other, with Bebe and Annie behind them.]
STAN
Come on, Pip, say it. Say "Please, hit me."
PIP
But, if I say that, you'll hit me.
STAN
No! I'm gonna hit you if you don't say it. If you say "Please, hit me," I won't hit you.
PIP
Please, hit me.
STAN
All right. [backhand slap]
PIP
Ooowww!
STAN
Alright, we'll try this again, Pip.
MARK
[rolls up] I don't understand. You seem to like that boy, yet hate him at the same time. [Craig and Butters walk up]
CRAIG
Hey, kid. Get out of that hamster ball.
MARK
Oh. I promised my father I wouldn't.
STAN
Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own. [moves out of the way as Craig and Butters position the ball]
BUTTERS
Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench.
MARK
You mean you would actually duct-tape my entire body to a bench? For what purpose?
CRAIG
Just get out of the hamster ball, or else you're gonna find out!
[Mark moves to the door and opens it. The ball moves, and Butters holds in in place while Mark flips his way out of it. Once he's on the ground, a bunch of boys come in and crowd him. Tolkien, Bill, Tweek, Clyde, and Terrence join Craig and Butters in carrying Mark to the bench.]
BOYS
Okay, let's get him... [more chatter as they place him on the bench and duct-tape him to it]
BUTTERS
Got it. [the boys disperse]
CRAIG
Have a nice second half of the day, nerdo!
BUTTERS
Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All!
MARK
Oh, dear.
[The Cotswolds house. Mr. and Mrs. Cotswolds pace their living room, worried about their son's whereabouts]
MR. COTSWOLDS
Oh, where could he be? He should've been home from public school by now.
MRS. COTSWOLDS
I'm sure he's alright.
MR. COTSWOLDS
[a thump on the door] That must be him. [thump. Mr. Cotswolds opens the door, and both parents look]
MRS. COTSWOLDS
Waaaaah! [Mark has walked home still strapped to the bench]
MR. COTSWOLDS
Oh my God, son!
MARK
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. [walks in]
MR. COTSWOLDS
Mark, what have they done to you?!
MARK
Well, they duct-taped me to a bench.
MRS. COTSWOLDS
But why?
MARK
I don't know, mother. It didn't make any sense at all.
MR. COTSWOLDS
Well, you see? This is what happens at public schools!
MARK
But I want to go back tomorrow, papá.
MRS. COTSWOLDS
What??
MARK
Please, just give me one more day. [walks off]
MRS. COTSWOLDS
What do we do?
MR. COTSWOLDS
Well, if we're goin' to let him go back, it looks like I need to have a little talk with those other boys' fathers. [snort, snort. He seems to have a little problem with phlegm in the nose]
[The Cotswolds house, night. A girl's bedroom is shown. Rebecca is at her desk writing.]
A VOICE
[with guitar]
Everywhere I go, I'm thinking of you, Rebecca.
[she stops writing and looks to the window]
I don't know what to do, Rebecca.[she hops off the chair, walks over to her toy box and hops onto it]
You're so nice, I'd like to get to know you better.[she looks out the window. It is Kyle she sees]
So what do you say we get together?
You really are quite good-looking, Rebecca!
You really are quite good-looking, Rebecca!
Rebecca, you're really quite good-looking!
You're a fox.[she looks a bit more, then moves away from the window. Kyle waits, then brightens as she returns. She drops some money down to him, and it lands in the guitar case. She moves away again, and he looks at the money]
[The town bar. Jimbo, Ned, Randy, and Gerald sit at the bar sipping some beers. As Mr. Cotswolds enters, the camera pulls back to reveal Stuart McCormick, Richard Tweek, and Craig's father at the bar with the others]
MR. COTSWOLDS
Good evening, gentlemen. If I can have your attention for a few moments. [the other men turn to face him] My son Mark was beat up in school today by your sons. I think it would be appropriate for you to talk with your sons, and instruct them to no longer tease or bother my boy. [sniff]
RANDY
Uh, look, Mr....
MR. COTSWOLDS
Cotswolds.
RANDY
Mr. Cotswolds, we can't completely control what our kids do socially. That's..., you know, that's for them to figure out on their own.
MR. COTSWOLDS
Well, obviously, they need to be coached a little better. [the men get mad. He coughs, then points to Gerald] And furthermore, your son has been harassing my little girl! I would like you to tell him to stop.
GERALD
Hey, my son is just discovering love. Maybe your daughter is, too. They-uh, they need to know about that stuff.
MR. COTSWOLDS
Uh, hello-o? My girl is eight years old! What does she need to know about love?
RANDY
Well, something. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once.
MR. COTSWOLDS
I will not tell you how to raise your children, and you will not tell me how to raise mine!
JIMBO
Eh, you wanna beer or something, Cotswolds?
MR. COTSWOLDS
No, I don't drink beer. I just like wine coolers.
JIMBO
You what??
[The town bar, later. The men head out the door.]
JIMBO
See ya, Cotswolds. [Randy looks and grins] Thanks for stopping by.
GERALD
Yeah. See ya. [the camera pans down to show Mr. Cotswolds duct-taped to a bench]
[South Park Elementary, the cafeteria, next day. Lunchtime. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are at table]
KYLE
...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.
MARK
[walks up] Can I sit here with you?
STAN
[tsk] Aw, man, if you have to.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[over the P.A.] Attention, students. Don't forget that this Friday night is the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. We will have a very special band performing, so please come early.
KYLE
Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!
STAN
Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now. [laughs]
KENNY
(Heheh, yeah. You're a faggot, dude. Fuck, yeah. Hehe-eheh.)
MARK
Why do you call Kyle names and laugh at him? Is he not your friend?
STAN
Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff.
MARK
I see. It's like, you have to mark your territory as a boy. You have to socially find your place.
KYLE
What??
CRAIG
[leading a group of boys, walks up] Enjoying your lunch, nerdo?
MARK
[confidently] Ah! Stick and stones may break my bones, but words will never harm me.
STAN
Ah, dude, you don't say that.
MARK
Huh?
CRAIG
Get him! [the group grabs him and duct-tapes him to an adjacent bench, then walks away.]
KYLE
Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school.
STAN
Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.
[The Cartman house, afternoon. Cartman is in bed with a bag of chips.]
CARTMAN
[sighing drowsily] Eeehhh.
ANNOUNCER
Welcome to Huntin' and Killin with Jimbo and Ned.
CARTMAN
Eehh, shut up. [stretches] Ooohhh, yeasss.
LIANE
[opens the door] Hon, are you ready for some math problems?
CARTMAN
Eh, not right this second, mother. Put them there by the door.
LIANE
Oh, all right. [sets them on the nightstand]
CARTMAN
Mom?
LIANE
Yes?
CARTMAN
Could you turn up the heat just a little?
LIANE
Sure, hon. [turns it up and walks out]
CARTMAN
Egghhh. Dude, home-schooling rules. [turns to his right side] Yeeehhhhhhss! [goes to sleep.]
[The Cotswolds house, afternoon. Kyle approaches the front door and rings the bell. Rebecca answers and immediately puts her hands together]
REBECCA
Oh, hel-lo.
KYLE
Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um,
REBECCA
He-ey, would you like to come up to my room?
KYLE
Huh?
REBECCA
Woowould you like to come up to my room?
KYLE
Uuuh, okay. [she yanks him in] Gah!
[The Cotswolds house, the living room. Mark is talking with his parents]
MR. COTSWOLDS
I'm sorry, son. There's nothing we can do to stop those bullies. We have to pull you out of public school.
MARK
Oh, papá. Can I at least go to the dance tomorrow?
MR. COTSWOLDS
Well alright, you can go, but I'll be there to supervise.
MARK
Alright. [starts to shuffle away]
MR. COTSWOLDS
Mark, where's your sister?
MARK
She's upstairs playing Doctor with that Kyle boy.
MR. COTSWOLDS
Oh, alright.
BOTH PARENTS
What?! [they dash to her room]
MRS. COTSWOLDS
Rebecca! Aaah! Aaaaah! Noo-hooo!
MR. COTSWOLDS
Rebecca, don't play that perverted game! [reaches the door and opens it. Before them is Kyle on his back on a low table covered by a blanket. Rebecca, in scrubs, stands on a chair cutting away at Kyle's hat. Both look at her parents]
REBECCA
I have to extricate a rr-region in his cerebral cortex, or risk ih-nfection to the synaptic responses.
MR. COTSWOLDS
Ah. Alright. Rebecca. But it's time to start your home-schooling! [snorts twice and leaves with his wife]
KYLE
Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go.
REBECCA
[voice quivering] Hhm. Alright, I guess I'll go.
KYLE
You will?
REBECCA
[voice quivering] I guess. Are you gonna go? Maybe I'll see you there.
KYLE
No no. I mean, go with me.
REBECCA
Oh, I'm sure Father will give me a ride. [walks off to her home-schooling. Kyle gets mad and bangs his head against her chair]
[The Cartman house, his bedroom. He still looks sleepy.]
CARTMAN
Ahhhhhhhhh. ["Jesus and Pals" is heard in the background] Ahhhhhhhhh-ahhhh. Tired, tired.
LIANE
[opens the door] Eric, I got you a new history textbook. Why don't you come downstairs.
CARTMAN
Wwaargh. Not right now, Mom. [sighs]
LIANE
Eric, please. We have to do some studying today.
CARTMAN
I am studying, Mom. I'm learning with the Fonics Monkey. [she looks over and sees the Fonics Monkey tossing a box of Snacky S'mores around. She withdraws and Cartman yawns again. Stan and Kenny enter]
STAN
Hey, fatass, how's home-schooling going?
CARTMAN
[sleepily] Oh, it's soo sweet, you guys.
STAN
Well, get your ass out of bed! [Kenny walks off] We have to go deal with that home-school kid!
CARTMAN
Huh, I can't. I'm too tired. [moves to sleep again] Maybe tomorrow.
KENNY
[to the monkey] (Hey, can I have that?) [reaches for a Snacky S'more in the monkey's hand, but the monkey tosses it away] (Heey.)
STAN
But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.
CARTMAN
[sleepily] That sounds cool. Maybe I'll go to that.
KENNY
[smacked against a nightstand by the monkey] (Hey!) [the monkey starts tossing him around like a box] (Hey, Cartman, help me.)
CARTMAN
No, Fonics Monkey! [the monkey throws Kenny up against the ceiling and stomps on him] No, Fonics Monkey, that's a bad Fonics Monkey! [the monkey smashes Kenny against the foot of Cartman's bed several times, then stomps on him until he no longer responds]
STAN
Oh my God, Fonics Monkey killed Kenny!
CARTMAN
You're damn straight, he did.
[The Cotswolds house, later that afternoon. Kyle is in the backyard waiting for Rebecca. She comes out and closes the sliding door.]
KYLE
You got my note?
REBECCA
[voice quivering] Uh of course. You taped it to my dog; how could I not see it?
KYLE
Uh, can we sit down?
REBECCA
Wha-y noh-ot? [leads him onto a nice path next to a lovely flowerbed with all sorts of flora] Isn't Papa's garden beautiful? He works so hard on it. [picks a flower]
KYLE
Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that... [draws close] flicker of light over there?
REBECCA
I... [looks down and away, pulls away a bit] have looked at it.
KYLE
Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children, [draws close] just like us.
REBECCA
How can children go to school on a f-licker of light?
KYLE
From public school, your house is just a flicker of light. [they walk over to a stone bench and sit] Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study
REBECCA
Well, what else would one do?
KYLE
Love, for one thing.
REBECCA
And woowhat is love?
KYLE
Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss.
REBECCA
Woowhat means "ki-iss"?
KYLE
When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.
REBECCA
Oh, you mean a-a mate. When it is time to increase the herd, my provider will select one for me.
KYLE
Rebecca, in public school, [hops down] we select our... own mate. [walks off a bit] In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy.
REBECCA
You certainly come from a silly place. Still, I should like to try that... kiss. [he turns to face her] So I cold write about it. [Kyle walks back and sits on the bench] How do we do it?
KYLE
I'm not completely sure.
REBECCA
Should we... [looks at him] l-look it up?
KYLE
No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right. [she hums as they get closer and closer. Their lips touch. A quick kiss and they pull apart]
REBECCA
Wow. Wow, that was fun! [grabs him]
KYLE
Dah. [she kisses him back, then lets go] Does that mean you'll go to the dance?
REBECCA
Y-you bet your sweet a-ass I will.
[South Park Elementary, night. The school is lit up for the dance. Seven boys move towards the flagpole: Pip, Stan, Tolkien, Craig, Butters, Fosse, and Bill]
CRAIG
Alright, here's the plan. Tomorrow night at the dance, when none of the chaperones are looking, you guys go grab Mark. Bring him out here, and then we're gonna duct-tape him to this flagpole.
STAN
Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.
CRAIG
That's the point, buttpipe.
STAN
Don't call me a buttpipe, buttpipe!
BUTTERS
Wewell, come on. We gotta buy us some more duct tape.
BOYS
Hooray! [they walk away]
BILL
Hooray. [catches up to the others]
JIMBO
[arrives with a group of men] Alright, here's the plan. All we gotta do is volunteer to chaperone the dance tomorrow. [Randy, Gerald, Ned, and Stuart are also present]
RANDY
Uh, why do we want to all chaperone the dance?
JIMBO
Because Cotswolds is gonna to live there. And when he shows up, we all grab him, bring him out here, and duct-tape him to the flagpole!
GERALD
The flagpole! That's great! [Mr. Tweek and Craig's father are now present]
JIMBO
Come on! We gotta buy more duct tape.
MEN
[walk away] Alright!
[South Park Elementary, night. It's Friday and the kids are gathering in the gym for the dance. Mark is already in the crowd, but the time is not yet. There isn't much to dance to, but kids dance anyway. Wendy and Bebe hop back and forth. Tweek dances as well. Pip is dancing in the background. Annie and Clyde, Tolkien and Red, Kevin, Terrence and Fosse, and the tattered kid stand around.]
STAN
[sees Kyle enter and walks to him] Dude, we're gonna go duct-tape that Mark kid to the bleachers. You wanna help? [with him are Craig, Butters, and Cartman.]
KYLE
[with a bouquet of flowers] I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up.
STAN
Oh, brother! [shows his displeasure to the others]
KYLE
Don't you "Oh, brother" me! She's the woman of my dreams!
STAN
You suck now, Kyle! [walks away with the other boys]
KYLE
You suck!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[on stage] Boys and girls, can I have your attention, please? This year we have a very special guest performing the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. He was a musical force in the '70's and '80's. Please welcome Ronnie James Dio! [walks off as the curtains part. Dio appears with his band. The kids look back and say nothing]
DIO
Are you ready to rock, boys and girls?! [silence] I said, are you ready to rock?!
BUTTERS
Uh, uuh, sure uh, I guess.
DIO
Then let's hit it! [the band begins to play] I know you all remember this one. It's off my first solo album. The song that you all helped me make number 1.
Holy Diver, you've been down too long in the midnight sea.
Oh, what's-
CRAIG
["-becoming of me?"] Hey, there he is! There's the home-schooled kid! [Mark enters and stands next to Kyle] Come on! Let's go duct-tape him to the flagpole! ["Ride the tiger."]
BUTTERS
Hey, isn't that the home-schooled kid's sister? ["You can see his stripes but you know he's clean."]
REBECCA
[dressed as a slut] Hi, guys. ["Oh, don't you see what I mean?" She walks up to Butters, kisses him, and walks away]
BUTTERS
Woo-oh Holy Cow! [Kyle and Mark are quite surprised. "Gotta get away."]
REBECCA
[walks over to Tolkien] He-ey, baby. Come s-see me later, 'kay? [grabs his ass and walks off]
TOLKIEN
What the-? Damn, baby. [rubs his ass. Red looks angrily at Rebecca. Kyle is shocked, and Mark has left]
REBECCA
[walks over to Kyle] Hey, Kyle. Wanna go make out?
KYLE
Rebecca. You...
MARK
[returns] Rebecca, what the devil are you doing? [Pip walks by]
REBECCA
I'm... having... fun, Mark. [reels Pip back and kisses him]
PIP
Oh, my goodness! [hurries off]
MARK
You're out of control. [turns to Kyle] You did this to my sister!
KYLE
Uh. All I did was show her how to-
MARK
You made my sister into a slut! I'll kill you! [leaps at him and slaps him around. The kids gather around to watch the fight, and Dio plays on. Mark throws Kyle into the air]
KYLE
[landing on his back] Aaaah!
MARK
[pounces on again] You bitch! I'm gonna whip your bitch ass! [slaps him around some more]
KYLE
Ooww!
CRAIG
Oh my God!
STAN
Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle!
BUTTERS
Yeah. He's a badass! [smiles]
RANDY
[entering] Alright, alright, that's enough, boys. [takes Kyle with him]
MARK
...I'm not through with you, bitch! [Stan walks up]
STAN
Hey, you're pretty cool, Mark. [Butters walks up]
BUTTERS
Yeah, tha-that was real badass how you stood up for your sister. Uh-uh-I'd have kicked Kyle's bitch ass, too.
STAN
Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark? [Craig walks up]
CRAIG
[grabbing Mark's right hand] No! He's my friend!
BUTTERS
[grabbing Mark's left hand] Eh, he said he'd hang out with me! [Mark smiles, pleased that these guys would fight for his friendship]
MR. COTSWOLDS
[enters another door with his wife] They've got to be here somewhere.
JIMBO
Hey, there's Cotswolds. Come on! Let's duct-tape him to the flagpole!
MEN
Yeah! [move forward. Mr. Cotswolds goes to some outlet and unplugs the sound system. Dio stops playing]
MR. COTSWOLDS
Where are my children?! I'm taking them out of this God-forsaken place!
MARK
[onstage, takes the mic from Dio] Calm down, papá! [Papá looks at Mom] Everything is all right. [the kids look at him] You see, I've learned something today. Public schools may be a bit lacking in education, but it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves. And the only place to do that is on the playground, in the cafeteria, and so on. [his parents listen] Don't you see, papá? That's what happened to your daughter. You tried so hard to keep her from anything sexual, and now look at her. She's a God-damned whore, papá. [Rebecca is listening]
BUTTERS
Well, she sure is.
MARK
I know letting your kids out into the world is scary. I know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us. But bad things will happen, and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things. [Stan and Kyle look at each other. The men listen]
MR. COTSWOLDS
Mark. You're absolutely right. [Mark grins. His mom grins as well] Okay, children. If it's what you want, you can start going to public school.
KIDS
Alright! [Rebecca goes up to Kyle and kisses him]
STAN
[goes onstage] Nice speech, nerdo.
MARK
Thanks, gaywad. [Cartman joins them]
CARTMAN
Now you're gettin' it.
JIMBO
Well, come on, guys. If I'm not mistaken, we still have someone to duct-tape to the flagpole!
MEN
Hooray!
MR. COTSWOLDS
What?! [the men hoist him up and carry him out the doors]
MARK
See ya, papá! [Dio takes the mic back]
DIO
Well, I'm glad we all learned something today, kids. Now, let's dance! [resumes with "Holy Diver." The Fonics Monkey is drumming with the band. Mr. Cotswolds is now duct-taped to the flagpole]
DIO
Holy Diver, you've been down too long in the midnight sea.
Oh, what's becoming of me?
[End credits start to roll]
Like the tiger. You can see his stripes but you know he's clean.
Oh, don't you see what I mean?
Gotta get away, Holy Diver.
End of Hooked on Monkey Fonics

synopsis:Cartman has visions of glory as he suits up for the Confederacy in the annual reenactment of a Civil War battle, and leads the drunken rebels to defeat the union.

script:The Red Badge of Gayness

[The bus stop, morning. The boys are dressed in Union blue. Stan bears the flag, Kyle and Kenny have fifes, and Cartman carries a drum.]
STAN
Ready? 1-2-3-4. [the boys begin to march forward and play.]
CARTMAN
Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?! [answers himself] Yes, I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore!
KYLE
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
CARTMAN
I'm playing the drum.
KYLE
Well, you have to hit it softer!
CARTMAN
You can't just "hit" a drum, you have to beat the shit out of it! [to the drum, hitting it once in a while] Shut you butthole, or I'll kick your ass, you fucking drum!! [to Kyle] That's how you rock, dude.
KYLE
You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!
CARTMAN
I am keepin' the beat; your flute-playing sucks!
STAN
That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer!
CARTMAN
Ey, I'll get it!
KYLE
Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!
CARTMAN
Yes I will!
STAN
Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4. [again, the march and play. Cartman gets carried away and the others glare at him]
CARTMAN
Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, damn it!
KYLE
Cartman!!! [Cartman stops]
CARTMAN
What?
KYLE
Give me the drum, and you play the flute.
CARTMAN
No way! Flutes are totally gay!
KENNY
[inspects his flute] (Flutes are gay?)
STAN
Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!
CARTMAN
Oh! Well, you know what I say?! [drops his drum and jumps on it] Screw you guys, I'm going home! [walks away, leaving the drum split in two]
KYLE
You dick!
CARTMAN
Later.
[The South Park Banquet Hall, 8:04 A.M., morning of reenactment. "Welcome Reenacters." People inside chatter away]
JIMBO
Alrighty everyone. We just have a few things to go over before we head out to the reenactment battlefield. [the townsmen are dressed in the Blue and the Grey] First of all, I have great news. There are over 200 folks from around the state that have come to see this year's reenactment, and that's the best turnout ever!
MEN
[jump and cheer] Yes! Woohoo, yea!
STAN
Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment. [Kyle and Kenny are also present]
KYLE
He'll show.
STAN
He'd better!
JIMBO
I'm also very proud to announce that this year's alcohol sponsor, Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps, the schnapps with the delightful taste of s'mores.
MEN
Whoa. Mmm.
MR. GARRISON
Mmm. It does taste like s'mores.
STUART
[coughs] Hih yeah, and it's got quite a kick, too.
JIMBO
And now, to clarify how the reenactment should unfold, let's bring up our master historian, Grandpa Marvin Marsh, [Grandpa rolls up in his wheelchair amid applause] the only man old enough to have actually seen the Civil War... reenactment of 1924.
KYLE
Wow, dude! Your grandpa still isn't dead?
STAN
Dude, that's not cool.
CARTMAN
[arrives dressed in the Grey] Good morning, gentlemen.
STAN
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
KYLE
Yeah! You're dressed up like the South.
CARTMAN
Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time.
STAN
You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass!
CARTMAN
Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did.
GRANDPA
Okay, you all know the rules. You must fire your blanks into the air, and if someone says they killed ya, you gotta play dead.
KYLE
The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!
CARTMAN
Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win.
KYLE
No they're not, stupid!
CARTMAN
Yes we are!
KYLE
How much do you wanna bet?!
JIMBO
Now remember, everybody: for a good reenactment we've got to pretend down to the last detail that we're really in the Civil War. So when the North wins, all of us on the Confederate side should act all bummed and depressed. [continues as the boys speak]
KYLE
Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!
CARTMAN
Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month.
KYLE
And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??
CARTMAN
Right.
KYLE
You're on!
CARTMAN
Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield. [walks away]
STAN
Hoohoo what a dumbass!
KYLE
Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.
STAN
It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave.
JIMBO
...And with that, let's all go to Tamarack Hill and put on a good show!
MEN
[jump and cheer] Yes! Woohoo, yea!
["Tamarack Hill," 9:00 A.M. The Reenactment. Bleachers flank Grandpa on either side as the North and the South face off before him. Each side has set up its camp]
ANNOUNCER
Welcome to the South Park reenactment of the Battle of Tamarack Hill. The men in gray are the Confederacy, from the South [Butters is there]; in blue are the Union, from the North [Chef is there, and Kenny has the drum].
GRANDPA
[addressing the spectators] It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to get the bell of Appomattox down from Tamarack Hill. What ensued was a bloody battle, but after many hours, the Union Army prevailed. Here now is the reenactment of that great battle. [blows the whistle]
JIMBO
[leading the South] Forward! [The South advances]
RANDY
[leading the North] Let's bring those Confederate bastards down! [the North advances, the boys play their tune]
JIMBO
Fire! [some guns go off]
CONFEDERATE REENACTORS
Yeah!
RANDY
Alright men, fire! [some guns go off]
UNION REENACTORS
Yeah! [the battle is joined, and men left and right begin to drop away. Others scream]
RANDY
Hey, uh, I shot you, Ned. You have to fall down.
NED
[Jimbo fires a few shots] Ow.
RANDY
Yeh-hah! [the battle continues, and even a cow gets into the act]
MAN 1
[in the stands] Oh, so this is what it was like. [the battle continues, but now it's hand-to-hand combat. Cartman reaches the bell and starts to push it down the hill]
MAN 2
Hey! What's that guy doing?!
CARTMAN
Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!
REENACTORS
[on both sides] Huh? Wha-?
GRANDPA
What the hell?
RANDY
He took the bell!
GERALD
He can't do that!
GRANDPA
The Confederacy doesn't take the bell!
CARTMAN
[skating by on the bell] Hooray for the South!
STAN
Cartman, you can't do that!
GRANDPA
God dammit! Now we have to start over!
[10:24 A.M., reenactment - second attempt.]
JIMBO
Alrighty everyone. [Cartman walks up] We're going to do the entire reenactment again, because of some confusion over the bell. Now, I know you're just trying to help Eric, but we have to let the Union capture the bell this time.
CARTMAN
But why? Why should they get the bell?
JIMBO
Wuh. Well, 'cause we're supposed to lose.
CARTMAN
But we don't have to lose.
JIMBO
What??
CARTMAN
[assuming command] Gentlemen, we can win this battle! [paces] Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, "We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?!" Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, "Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!" [some of the men drink schnapps]
JIMBO
[takes a swig] By God, he's right!
MR. GARRISON
Jimbo!
JIMBO
Yeah, I've been reenacting this war for 22 years now. And for 22 years us Confederate reenactors have had to spend the evening being ridiculed and made fun of by the Union reenactors! Well, I'm sick of it!
MR. GARRISON
Yeah! Why do we have to be their bitches every year?!
STUART
I'm tired of losing this battle!
JIMBO
And I say it's high time we kicked some ass! Who's with me?!
REENACTORS
Yeah!
REENACTOR
Yeah! [drops down drunk. Cartman grins]
[The battlefield]
GRANDPA
Alright, folks. Sorry for the false start. We're ready to go again. It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to- [turns at the sound of a gun shot and looks as the Confederates charge down the field]
CONFEDERATE 1
Yaaaaah!
CONFEDERATE 2
Come on! Just give up! We're not gonna let you live another day!
GERALD
Uh, what are they doing?
MR. GARRISON
[drunk] You Yankee sons of bitches!
RANDY
[a Confederate shoots him on the belly] Ow! That hurt!
GRANDPA
God dammit, what the hell are they doing?!
KYLE
What do we do?!
STAN
Run for your life, dude! [the boys run off. Cartman watches from the hill as the battle rages on]
CARTMAN
God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!
REENACTOR
Come on!
RANDY
[tackled by Jimbo] Oh?
JIMBO
[pins Randy to the ground] Surrender your men, general!
RANDY
Jimbo, have you lost your mind?!
JIMBO
[yells] SURRENDER YOUR MEN, GENERAL!
RANDY
Alright, alright. We surrender. [the Union soldiers drop their guns and raise their arms. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny walk out from behind a tree with their hands up.]
BARBRADY
[in the stands] The South win?
JIMBO
The South wins!
REENACTORS
Yeah, woohoo!
GRANDPA
God dammit!
[South Park Banquet Hall, 3:45 p.m. Reenactment after party. The men are all in conversation]
JIMBO
[walks up to Randy] Well, we can all be friends now. [nudges him] Come on, Randy. Have some s'more schnapps. [hands Randy a bottle]
RANDY
Uh, I can't be happy. You ruined the reenactment.
JIMBO
Aw, come on. Have a little sip. [Randy sips]
CARTMAN
[walks up to Stan and Kyle] So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?
KYLE
You cheated, Cartman!
STAN
Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit!
KYLE
Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!
CARTMAN
[sighs] I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a long shot. [the men are getting more drunk]
RANDY
[talking to Stuart with slurred speech] All I'm saying is that... is that the Confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in Topeka!
MR. GARRISON
That ain't true! The Confederates would have whupped ass in Topeka, too!
BARTENDER
Yeah.
REENACTOR
Yeah.
GERALD
You're dreaming!
CARTMAN
[walks up to Jimbo] Perhaps we should take Topeka.
JIMBO
Huh?
CARTMAN
They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah.
JIMBO
They don't?!
CARTMAN
No. I say we take Topeka.
JIMBO
[to the crowd] You know what? I'll bet we could take Topeka right now and clear them all around!
RANDY
Huh?
STUART
That's right! Maybe we should do what the Confederates would've done and march on to Topeka!
MR. GARRISON
I'll bet we could!
JIMBO
I'll bet we could, too! [pounds on the podium]
CARTMAN
[throwing his voice] I'll bet you can't.
JIMBO
[jumps back] What?! [then walks and stands in front of the podium] Is that a challenge?! I'll bet we can!
CARTMAN
[fake voice] I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!
JIMBO
Pussies?! Oh yeah?! Men! It's time to show the world what the Confederate Army has got! We're gonna take Topeka once and for all!
REENACTOR 1
Yeah.
REENACTOR 2
Yeah.
JIMBO
[walks to the Union soldiers] All o' you men. You may have lost in the Union today, but join us now and win back your pride!
REENACTOR 3
Yeah.
REENACTOR 4
Yeah.
RANDY
Well, the Union be damned!
JIMBO
Let's go!
MEN
Yeah! [all walk out]
CARTMAN
[trailing, stops by his friends] Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be my slaves for a month.
KYLE
They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop.
CARTMAN
Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens.
KENNY
(Woohoo!) [exits with Cartman. The men charge out of the banquet hall growling]
[Topeka, Kansas, 7:53 A.M., next morning. A rooster crows. The town goes about its business. A mailman delivers some mail. A woman opens the school door. A traffic cop directs traffic. Two kids play catch in front of the school. The woman returns with the flag and hoists it up on the flagpole, and the mailman drops by.]
MAILMAN
Oh good morning, Mrs. Hollis.
MRS. HOLLIS
Hello, Ralph.
RALPH
Did you happen to catch that ball game last night?
MRS. HOLLIS
I'm afraid I was grading papers pretty late and- [both turn in the direction of a rumble. Everyone stops and looks in the same direction]
DRIVER
What's that noise, officer? [the officer looks, and the South Park men rise over a hill and charge towards town.]
SOUTH PARK MEN
Yeah! Yeah!
JIMBO
Ccchhhhaaaarrrrggggeeee!
[Randy knocks Ralph down with the butt of his gun. Gerald tackles Mrs. Hollis. Another man prepares a Molotov cocktail and throws in into a house, then salutes the resulting fire. Jimbo and Med head for the church, and its congregants rush out screaming. Stuart aims at the officer and shoots him]
OFFICER
[soothing his ass] Ow!
STUART
Freeze, buddy. These are blanks, but they still hurt like hell! [the church bell rings. Jimbo is pulling at the rope]
JIMBO
It's ours, it's ours! We've taken Topeka!
REENACTORS
Yeah!
RANDY
[still holding Ralph] Alright, Yank, tell us where you keep your Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps?!
RALPH
Uh-uh-uh schnapps? Uhm, uh-uh-I guess that would be at the liquor store.
RANDY
WHERE?!
RALPH
[desperately] At the liquor store, at the liquor stohohohohore!
RANDY
[drops Ralph] Come on, boys! [they all rush the store]
MRS. HOLLIS
[looking on] This is the most bizarre thing I've ever seen.
CARTMAN
[walks by] Excuse meh.
[South Park. Stan and Kyle wait at a regular bus stop]
STAN
Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas.
KYLE
I know, but—why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back?
STAN
Oh here comes the bus. [a tourist bus. Butters is behind the doors waiting to come out. The doors open and Butters exits. The bus leaves] Butters? Are you the only one that came back?
BUTTERS
Uh, conuh- [salutes] Confederate Messenger Butters reporting, sir. I have a message for you from the battlefield. [offers it]
STAN
What battlefield?!
BUTTERS
Uh Topeka. We're raisin' all kinds of hell, see? [hands the message to Stan] Eh, it's probably the most fun I've had in several months. Wuwell, you gonna read your message or not? [Stan opens and reads the message. A Ken Burns effect sequence starts using a 19th century sepia image of Cartman as General Lee]
CARTMAN
Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee
STAN
[crumples the message into a ball and throws it away] God dammit, that fat piece of shit!
KYLE
Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??
STAN
That would suck so much ass.
KYLE
We have to stop him, dude.
STAN
I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters?
BUTTERS
Uh-uh, wuh-I ain't supposed to tell you that. If I told you that, well, why I'd be a, a no-good Yankee son of a bitch.
KYLE
We'll give you 10 bucks.
BUTTERS
Oh. O-oh, okay.
[News Report]
REPORTER
...And she was forced to live off her own feces for several days. In national news, [the group's entry into Topeka is shown] a frightening radical group from Colorado is making its way across the Southern states of America. [the guy throwing the Molotov cocktail is shown] The group is recruiting new members in every town they pass through, and rapidly growing in number. [one last attack is shown] So authorities have decided to call in the National Guard. The groups seems to be led by military mastermind and right-wing radical Jimbo Kern [he is shown armed], who is known for his guerrilla-fighting and leadership skills.
[Somewhere...]
JIMBO
[now bloated and sluggish] Give me some more s'more schnapps! I'm gonna be sick. [vomits] Blouach.
[Chattanooga, Tennessee, 2:35 P.M. The town is destroyed and in flames. The men revel in their victory. Stan and Kyle approach the city with Grandpa and look over it from a hill]
STAN
Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought.
GRANDPA
Well, come on Billy, we've gotta make these little peckers stop before they get themselves killed.
MAN
[running] Aaaaa!
BRUNET
They say you can either fight them or join them.
BLOND
Well I'm joining them. Those blanks hurt!
STAN
[now in town] Dad, Dad. [Randy appears and stops] Mom wants you to come home.
RANDY
Not now, uh Stan, I'm pillaging. [a resident runs by] Get over here!
KYLE
You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!
GERALD
This is a reenactment, Kyle. My name is Pvt. John Fugasol, and I have to do what my general tells me!
JIMBO
Hey! There's some more schnapps over here!
GERALD
More schnapps! [moves towards it]
SGT. LARSEN
[the National Guard arrives] I'm Sgt. Larsen of the National Guard. We're here to stop the terrorists.
GRANDPA
They're not terrorists, they're just a bunch of drunk wankers from Colorado.
LARSEN
Well, we can't just shoot 'em; there's innocents and children about. Dawkins!
DAWKINS
Sir!
LARSEN
Fire a warning flare!
DAWKINS
Yes sir! [launches the flare. The flare goes up in the air, lands right on Kenny and burns him to a crisp.]
JIMBO
Medic! [amid the panic, a medic comes and extinguishes Kenny.]
LARSEN
Woops.
STAN
Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
GRANDPA
You bastards!
KYLE
Hey!
SOLDIER
[off camera] We can't fire at them, sir. There are too many children.
LARSEN
Then how do we stop them?
STAN
I know! But we'll have to wait until dark.
[South Park, Kenny's house, morning. Mrs. McCormick comes out to pick up the day's mail. She finds a letter, opens it, and reads... (Another Ken Burns effect sequence starts with Cartman as General Lee]
CARTMAN
Dear Ms. McCormick. It is with a very heavy heart that I must inform you that your son Kenny was killed in battle [her brows rise in surprise] on the morning of November 18, at Ruby Hills Funland in Chattanooga. This war has taken something from all of us, and, although your son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we all share your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and make Stan and Kyle my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate them so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee.
[The Confederate camp. The men relax and talk. Stan, Kyle, Grandpa, and Larsen sneak in...]
STAN
There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home.
GRANDPA
Nice thinkin', Billy.
LARSEN
Let's go. [they proceed to carry the schnapps away]
JIMBO
[enters Cartman's tent] Where to next, General?
CARTMAN
[with pipe in mouth] Where did the Confederates go, son?
JIMBO
Well, I guess uh Fort Sumter in South Carolina. That's where the Civil War really escalated.
CARTMAN
Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go.
JIMBO
Welluh, that sounds great. I'm gonna get some s'more schnapps. You want anything?
CARTMAN
[turns around] Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.
JIMBO
Um, sure. [exits to get some schnapps. He lifts a case and removes the lid, but finds the case empty. He takes a second case and again finds it empty] What the-? Ey, where's the s'more schnapps?
RANDY
[with a guitar] We're out of s'more schnapps?
MR. GARRISON
[checks his empty bottle] That can't be.
JIMBO
I guess we drank it all.
DAWKINS
Now what?
STAN
Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave.
KYLE
Yeah.
[The Confederate camp, 7:29 A.M., next morning, 7 hours without schnapps.]
SOLDIER 1
Uugh.
SOLDIER 2
Ouch.
RANDY
[exits his tent] Oh, my head.
GERALD
Where am I?
JIMBO
[sits next to Ned on a bench] Ned, I think I can say without any doubt that that was the longest drinking binge we've ever had.
NED
Mmm-oh. Gmm-oh, my head.
MR. GARRISON
[rises in his sleeping bag behind Stuart] Oh no, I'm supposed to be at work today.
STUART
Me, too.
JIMBO
[stands] Well, come on everybody. We've got to get to the nearest bus station, quick.
CARTMAN
[at his tent entrance] Where are you going?
JIMBO
We're goin' home kid. Come on. [walks off]
CARTMAN
We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter! [Randy stops by]
RANDY
Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us.
CARTMAN
[watching the sober Confederates walk away] No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?!
STAN
[rushes up with Kyle and Grandpa] Haha! You lose, fatass!
CARTMAN
God, I hate you guys!
KYLE
Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history. [Cartman eyes a phone...] You see, history is forever, [...and an empty schnapps case next to it] and everything happens for a reason. [Cartman turns and walks] Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno-
STAN
Where are you going?
CARTMAN
This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot! [Stan and Kyle just look at each other]
[The long march home... The group is in a meadow.]
RANDY
Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here.
JIMBO
Yeah? Well, I don't think the bus station is too far from here.
STUART
Uh, how much do you think a bus ticket back to Colorado is gonna run? [two schnapps trucks pull up and the drivers drop down. They head to the rears of the trucks and start unloading case after case of Jagermin's]
SUZETTE
Allo, I am Suzette, the S'more Schnapps girl. [Cartman gets out of the truck and walks up behind her] We are pleased to sponsor you with all the S'more Schnapps you need.
RANDY
Awgh, I can't drink anymore of that stuff.
GERALD
Me neither.
CARTMAN
Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw.
SUZETTE
Yes, please. Do a shot out of my breasts. [pours two bottles into her cleavage]
JIMBO
Well, uh I guhess one little cheers is in order.
[Soon, the men are drunk again and having a good time.]
JIMBO
Hey, look! Ned's doin' his trick again! [Ned tumbles by wearing a fancy lampshade]
MR. GARRISON
[rushes up] Hey, guys. Let's all play a game of "grab ass."
GERALD
What's "grab ass?"
MR. GARRISON
You know. We just run around in circles and try to grab each others' asses.
RANDY
Ey, that sounds fun. [grabs Mr. Garrison's ass]
MR. GARRISON
Hohoho.
SOLDERS
I got you. Oo-oh. [the men laugh and chase each other around trying to grab asses here and there]
CARTMAN
[intervenes] Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take.
JIMBO
You heard the General.
SOLDIERS
Yeah! [all charge out. Empty schnapps cases litter the field]
STAN
[reaches the scene a bit late] Oh, no.
KYLE
We'll never stop them now.
[The March of War. Chattanooga, Tennessee, is struck, then Atlanta, Georgia; then eastern and southeastern Alabama, then Orlando, Florida. The group is on a log ride]
SOLDIERS
Woohoo!
CARTMAN
Yes! Yes!
[Southeast Georgia is struck, then Darling County, South Carolina.]
[Fort Sumter, day. A tour is taking place.]
GUIDE
Throughout 1861 the Confederate authorities tried to drive out the Union occupants of Fort Sumter peacefully. But Abraham Lincoln's administration would not surrender the fort to the Confederates, so Jefferson Davis decided to take action.
TOURIST
And the Confederates won the fort?
GUIDE
Yes. [turns and leads the group to the gates] Imagine what it must have been like: you're a Union soldier stationed at this fort, and one day, you look out and see thousands of Confederates ready to pounce on you. [the group stares in awe at the seemingly thousands of Confederates just outside the gate. The guide turns to see...] Uh...
CARTMAN
Take the fort!
JIMBO
Charge!
MEN
Yeah! [they enter] Woohoo, yeah, come on!
JIMBO
We got it! The fort is ours! [a cannon blast knocks Randy down]
RANDY
What was that?? [the National Guard has caught up with the Confederates and now surrounds the fort.]
LARSEN
[on the bullhorn] Attention political activists: you are on government historical monument property! Surrender the monument with your hands up! If you would like a tour of the fort, one can be arranged through the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce.
STAN
[takes the bullhorn] Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here.
CARTMAN
Suck my ass!
JIMBO
What do we do, General? We're outnumbered.
CARTMAN
We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up.
LARSEN
Alright, that does it. Blow the whole thing up.
STAN
No, you can't do that. Our dads are there.
LARSEN
Sorry, son. We tried it your way; now we do it our way. Prepare the mortar.
ELDERLY VOICE
Hold it right there! [The camera zooms out to show the rowdy reinforcements converge on Stan, Kyle, Grandpa, and the National Guard]
JIMBO
Wow, look at that! The entire state of South Carolina showed up! [other men grin with joy]
CARTMAN
I knew they would!
STAN
Aw, dammit!
LEADER
[saluting] We're ready to fight with ya. Long live the Confederacy!
MEN
Yee-haw! All right!
CARTMAN
Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.!
[Washington D.C., 7:45 A.M., next day. The group has entered the city and are protesting outside the white house. The Million Confederate March?]
JIMBO
Hey, government! You can't ignore our anguished cries anymore! You hear that?! You Government?! [Clinton looks out the window with two advisors]
AL GORE
Oh boy, this doesn't look good.
[the three men turn away from the window]
ADVISOR
It's just like the Million Man March, except that there actually are a million people.
AIDE
Mr. President! A message for you from the extremists! [Clinton reads:]
CARTMAN
Dear Mr. President. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with Marisa Tomei.
CLINTON
Oh, dear God! Wuh-we have to meet their demands.
ADVISOR
What?? Sir, there's- there's not that many of them.
AL GORE
As Vice-Persident, I think we'd better give them what they want. It's just the Southern states; who really needs them?
CLINTON
My hands are tied. Tell General Lee that I'll meet him in front of the Capitol.
AIDE
[salutes] Sir!
AL GORE
I'm so glad I don't have your job. [Clinton is surprised]
[back outside in the raucous crowd]
STAN
Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves.
GRANDPA
Dammit, Billy, this isn't about you havin' to be slaves! This is about history! We can't let them change it!
STAN
Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do?
GRANDPA
Wait a minute! They're all still doing a reenactment. What we have to do is play into that. Come on, Billy. You boys need a quick history lesson! [wheels away]
[The Capitol, later. President Clinton is at a table on the Capitol with Gore and others]
CLINTON
All right, I'm gonna sign the document declarin' the Confederacy winners of the Civil War.
CONFEDERATES
[exulting] Hooray!
JIMBO
[to Cartman] Boy, we really got the President by the balls. Good thing you have that videotape of him and Marisa Tomei.
CARTMAN
I don't. I made it up. [Kyle and Stan approach Clinton as Lincoln and Davis, respectively]
JIMBO
Hey! Who's that?!
KYLE
Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States.
STAN
Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy.
CLINTON
Boy, this just keeps getting weirder, doesn't it?
CARTMAN
What the hell are you guys doing?!
JIMBO
Ey, General, he's reenacting Jefferson Davis! You can't talk that way to a superior officer!
STAN
Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering.
CARTMAN
What?!
KYLE
Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year.
CONFEDERATES
Wow!
RANDY
A whole year?
JIMBO
All right! Well, I think we got what we wanted.
CLINTON
That's it? I-I don't have to sign this thing? [Kyle and Stan turn to each other and shake hands]
GERALD
Hey, come on. We should take a tour of the Smithsonian before we head back.
CARTMAN
No! We still have to fight!
JIMBO
[stops] Lincoln and Davis signed the treaty, General. The war is over.
CARTMAN
NOOO!!
STAN
[walks over with Kyle] It's finally over, Cartman. You lost!
KYLE
Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off! [tugs at it until it pulls off]
CARTMAN
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA- [the camera zooms out for a view of the city, then the planet, then the Milky Way, then the binary-star system of Marklar, the Marklar themselves, then another planet, then the Visitors are seen...] -AAAH!
CLINTON
[walks up and genuflects behind Stan and Kyle, patting each of them on the shoulder] Boys, as President of the United States, I want to commend you for stopping the rebel uprising.
STAN
Don't touch me. [Clinton stands up]
KYLE
Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!
CARTMAN
Dammit! Dammit, I was so close! Dammit!
STAN
Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is-
CARTMAN
Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave.
KYLE
What??
CARTMAN
The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished!
CLINTON
Eh, he's right, boys. Slavery is illegal and immoral, partially in thanks to the North winning the Civil War.
STAN
Awwww!
CARTMAN
Hahahaha haa ha!
STAN
Aw, the hell with it. Let's go home. [he and Kyle walk away with Grandpa] Thanks a lot, Bill Clinton!
KYLE
Yeah. Thanks, dick!

MR. HANKEY
Howdy-ho, folks. We're gonna do somethin' a little bit different tonight. Instead of our normal thing, we're just gonna sit back and enjoy some holiday songs. And if ya don't like it, well, I guess you can suck my tiny little balls. So let's start off with a festive Hanukkah song, sung by my favorite Jewish person in the whole world.
[The Broflovski house, decorated for Channukah. A dreidel spins on the living room rug. Kyle and Ike watch it spin and fall]
KYLE
Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah. [picks it up] This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song:
[begins to dance]
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Oh,
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
[gives the dreidel to Ike. Cartman walks in]
CARTMAN
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
KYLE
Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?
CARTMAN
Sure.
[takes it and walks up to the camera. Kyle sways to the song]
Here's a little dreidel that's small and made of clay.
But I'm not gonna play with it, 'cause dreidel's freakin' gay.
KYLE
[stops] Hey, shut your mouth, fatass!
CARTMAN
[moves to block Kyle from view. Kyle moves to the other side of the screen to be seen. They go back and forth like this for a while]

STAN
Let me try. [takes it and spins it on the rug]
I'll try to make it spin.
It fell; I'll try again.

[Back at the armchair...]
MR. HANKEY
Woohoo! Golly, that sure was fun. But now, for our next song, hold on to your bootstraps, 'cause we're gonna descend down into Hell!
[Hell. Flames abound here, but an ashen plain is seen with a little campfire on it. Hitler, shown in shades of gray, is on his knees in front of the fire, crying. Before him is a tree stand, but there's no tree in it.]
ADOLF
O Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum,
wie treu sind deine Blätter.
O Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum,
[little Hitler is lifted up to put a star atop the Christmas tree]
wie treu sind deine Blätter.
De grünst nicht nur zur Sommerzeit,
[little Hitler beans a Jewish boy down with a snowball]
Nein, auch im Winter, wenn es schneit.
[Little Hitler looks at trees, and has visions of marching soldiers. He salutes.]
O Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum,
wie treu sind deine Blätter.
[live Nazi footage is superimposed on the fire. Hitler breaks down]
SATAN
[walks up] Hey, Hitler. [turns to face him] What's the matter, little guy?
ADOLF
Oh, oh Satan, der tannenbaum, wie treu sind deine Blätter.
SATAN
Awww, you don't have a Christmas tree?
ADOLF
…nur zur Sommerzeit, nein, auch im Winter, wenn es schneit.
SATAN
[the damned appear around him] Well, I tell you what: Maybe we'll have ourselves a little Christmas, right here! Come on, everyone, gather 'round!
String up the lights and light up the tree.
We're gonna make some revelry!
Spirits are high, so I can tell,
[two of the damned stand up and dance]
It's Christmastime in Hell.

Demons are nicer as you pass them by.
[passes them in front of Azrael's Toys]
There's lots of demon toys to buy.
The snow is falling, and all is well.

It's

Christmastime in Hell!
SATAN
There goes Jeffrey Dahmer with a festive Christmas ham.
[Dahmer walks out of a meat store and into the house next door]
After he has sex with it, he'll eat up all he can.
And there goes John F. Kennedy, caroling with his son.
[they stop by to sing with him]
WITH THE KENNEDYS
Reunited for the holidays, God bless us, everyone!

Everybody has a happy glow!
Let's dance in blood and pretend it's snow.

Yes, ein tannenbaum.
FEMALES

God cast me down from heaven's door

To rule in Hell forevermore.
But now I'm kinda glad that I fell,

'Cause it's Christmastime in Hell!

Here's a rack to hang the stockings on [...the type of rack with a man stretched out on it]

We still have to shop for Genghis Khan [seen]
SATAN
Michael Landon's hair looks swell.
WITH CHOIR
It's Christmastime in Hell!
SATAN
There's Princess Diana holding burning mistletoe
Over poor Gene Siskel's head; just watch his weenie grow.
[She does hold the mistletoe; Gene goes down on her]
WITH CHOIR
For one day we all stop burning, and the flames are not so thick. [a demon turns down the flames]
All the screaming and the torture stops as we wait for Ol' Saint Nick!
So, [Satan sets some cookies on a small table; a demon brings him an armchair]
String up the lights and light up the tree.
[with him are Mao, Gene, Diana, JFK Sr. and Jr., and Dahmer]
We're damned for all eternity.
But for just one day all is well.
It's Christmastime in Hell!!!
SATAN
Gather close together and make it quick!
We gotta make room for Andy Dick.[shows the picture]
WITH CHOIR

MR. HANKEY
Well, that was a nice little song, wasn't it? But let's not forget that for some people Christmas is about the birth of Jesus. So now, here's a more serious Christmas song, sung by Eric Cartman.
[The town of Bethlehem. Cartman is superimposed on it. He's in formal wear.]
CARTMAN
And...
O Holy Night, the stars are brightly shi-ning
[The Star of the Nativity appears, then the Three Wise Men]
It is the night of our dear Savior's b-b-b-birth
[The Nativity and Cartman are seen in the background, Formal Cartman vanishes]
O Holy Night, the- something, something, dis-- aah.
[Formal Cartman before a starry sky]
It is the night with the Christmas trees and pie.
[Present-day Cartman finishes decorating the tree, helps himself to a pie]
Jesus was born, and so I get presents.
[Little Drummer Cartman stands before the manger scene, Present-day Cartman is seen tearing into his gifts back at home.]
Thank you, Jesus, for being born. (Wo-o-o-o-o)
[back at the manger, Little Drummer Cartman turns to look at Baby Jesus.]
Fall (Fall) [four angels appear behind Formal Cartman]
On your knees (On your knees) [Cartman falls on his knees]
And hear (Can't you hear)
The angels'.. something (Voices)
O night (O night)
[Present-day Cartman tosses in bed, which is covered in candy canes]
Divine (Divine)
[Formal Cartman] The night
When I get presents (O-o)
[at the manger, Little Drummer Cartman takes the gifts meant for Jesus]
O night (O o-night) [loads them up on his camel, with other presents]
Di-viiine! [Present-day Cartman rips into more presents at home]
[Formal Cartman] O night (Ooo-ooo)
O night, di-vine! [Little Drummer Cartman leads the gift-laden camels away]
Oh. Ah. Ch.
[Back at the armchair..]
MR. HANKEY
Well, oh boy, that was a super song! And now, let's hear from the school teacher, Mr. Garrison.
[South Park Elementary. Class is in session. Mr. Garrison has drawn a world map on the board.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, let's take our seats. Today we're going to learn how different cultures around the world celebrate the holiday season.
CLASS
[flatly] Awww.
KENNY
(What?!)
MR. GARRISON
Now, pay attention. Ahem...
I heard there is no Christmas in the silly Middle East [points it out]
No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus; They have different religious beliefs
They believe in Muhammad, and not in our holiday.[shows some Arabic writing]
And so, every December I go to the Middle East and say, [tosses the picture away]

[In the Middle East]
Hey there, Mr. Muslim, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Put down that book, the Koran, and hear some holiday wishes [rips the Koran out of the Muslim's hand and dresses him up as a tree]
In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday [removes the veils of two women]
So get off your heathen Muslim ass and fuckin' celebrate. [sticks a candy cane in the man's house]

There is no holiday season in India, I've heard. [pulls down a chart showing India's demerits.]
They don't hang up their stockings, and that is just absurd. [Stan and Kyle look at each other and shrug]
They've never read a Christmas story, they don't know what Rudolph is about.[holds up a book: "The Night Before Christmas"]
And that is why in December I'll go to India and shout,

[In India, next to a swami sitting on a bed of nails]
Hey there, Mr. Hinduist, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Drink eggnog and eat some beef, and pass it to the Missus. [gives beef to one man, pours eggnog on another]
In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday. [wraps a few people in Christmas lights]
So get off your heathen Hindu ass and fuckin' celebrate. [passes out wreaths]

Now, I heard that in Japan everyone just lives in sin.
They pray to several gods and put needles in their skin.
On December 25th all they do is eat a cake.
And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and say,

Hey there, Mr. Shintoist!, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
God is gonna kick your ass, you infidelic pagan scum.
In case you haven't noticed, there's festive things to do. [throws some straw on the musicians]
So let's all rejoice for Jesus, and Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you. [knocks down the Shintoist and dumps gifts on him, and wraps others in lights]

[dressed as Santa, dances around the class]
On Christmas Day, I travel 'round the world and say,
"Taoists, Krishnas, Buddhists, and all you atheists, too!
Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you." [Mr. Hat claps]
Uh, thank you, Mr. Hat.

On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
I saw three ships come sailing in [Stan sticks out his tongue and wiggles his hands on his ears]
On Christmas Day, in the morning. [Kyle pulls the ends of his lips apart and goes cock-eyed]

And what was in those ships, all three? [Stan starts to slurp on his fingers, then the boys chuckle]
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
And what- [turns and points at them]
Shut up, turds! [silence]

On Christmas Day, in the morning?

The Virgin Mary and Christ were there [Stan mimics Shelly with exaggerated expression, Kyle stifles a laugh]
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day [Kyle cracks up]
The Virgin Mary and-
Shut up, TUUUURDS! [The boys cover their mouths. Kyle stifles his laughing]
-Christ were there
On Christmas Day, in the morning.

Let us all rejoice, amain, [Stan pulls his cap over his face, Kyle flaps his ear flaps]

And let- [walks to the boys]
I told you to shut up! [Stan stifles his laugh]

MR. HANKEY
Golly, that sure was swell. I'd say my Christmas special is going super-fantastic. Well, now it's time to hear from perhaps the two most important people of the whole season.
[McKemick's Night Club. Tonight: Jesus and Saint Nick. A man goes towards the club.]
EMCEE
Hello, everyone, and welcome to McKemick's. Now, please put your hands together and welcome... Saint Nicholas and Jesus Christ. [Jesus and Santa enter on stage, and the audience claps]
SANTA
Hello, everybody!
JESUS
[waves] How are y'all doing tonight?
SANTA
You know, Jesus, there've been so many songs written about us over the years.
JESUS
That's right, Santa, and we love each and every one of them. Like this one.
Joy to the world, for I have come.
Let earth receive Me!
Let every heart prepare Me room. [gets some applause]
SANTA
And heaven and nature sing...
JESUS
And heaven and nature sing...
SANTA
And heaven and nature sing...
JESUS
And heaven and na-
BOTH
And heaven and heaven and nature sing.
SANTA
You know, Jesus, that is a nice song, but I like... this one:
Up on the housetop reindeer pause
Out jumps good old... me. [get some applause]
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones' Christmas joys
BOTH
[sway together]
Ho ho ho! Who wouldn't go?
Ho ho ho! Who wouldn't go?
SANTA
Up on the housetop, click click click.
Down through the chimney with good old... me.
JESUS
He he hoo, get away! [pushes him away]
SANTA
Go away??
JESUS
Get away.
SANTA
Where away?
JESUS
[gets some applause]
Away in the manger, no crib for My bed
That's where cute little old Me lay down My sweet head.
The stars in the sky (Santa: Ooooo)
BOTH
Looked down where I lay.
JESUS
Cute little eight-pound me (Santa: Oo-oo)
BOTH
asleep in (Santa: on) the hay.
JESUS
[gets some applause and sings upbeat]
O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
O come ye to Bethlehem to see-ee Me...
SANTA
Here's one,
Jol-
JESUS
Hark, the herald angels sing, Glory-
SANTA
Hey, it's my turn.
JESUS
-to Me!
Silent Night,
SANTA
Uh.
JESUS
Holy Night
SANTA
Santa Cl- em
JESUS
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Me.
SANTA
Saint Nicholas... can't think of one.
JESUS
Holy Me, so tender and mild.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
[slowing] Sleep in heavenly peace.
SANTA
Okay, Jesus. Here's one you might remember:
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twistin' through the dusty land.
JESUS
Uh. Santa, Santa, Santa, that's not a Christmas song, bud. Ah... that's-
SANTA
I know, but there's, like, three-hundred Jesus Christmas songs and only four fucking Santa ones! It's not fair! Just do it yourself! I'm leaving. [walks off the stage]
JESUS
Aw, come on, Santa. You can't leave.
SANTA
Aw, fuck you, Jesus!
JESUS
But Santa... The weather outside is frightful
SANTA
[offscreen] Aw.
JESUS
But the fire so delightful
SANTA
[returns to the stage] Well, since I've no place to go.
BOTH
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow. [more applause]
JESUS
It doesn't show signs of stoppin'.
SANTA
But I brought some corn for poopity-poppin'.
JESUS
The lights are turned way down low, so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
[Santa: Snow... snow... snow.]
BOTH
The fire is slowly dyin',
SANTA
And, my dear, we're still good-bop-be-byein',
JESUS
But as long as you love me so,
BOTH
[they dance and hold hands, then Jesus twirls him. Santa spins off the stage]
Let it snow, let it snow,
JESUS
let it snow!
SANTA
[slides back on stage on his knees]
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand!

MR. HANKEY
Well, I guess that's about the end of my Christmas album. Gosh! It was sure nice hangin' out with y'all again. Well, I guess if there's just... one thing I have left to say, it would be this:
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
May your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight.

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay. [hops out of the bowl]
From now on, our troubles will be miles away.

script:Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus

[South Park, Main Street, day. Kyle, Stan, and Kenny walk towards Tom's Rhinoplasty. Some adults walk by them as a station wagon rolls by. On the buildings are posters of Father Time and Baby New Year.]
STAN
Dude, what are we gonna do for New Year's Eve? It has to be awesome.
KYLE
I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives!
CARTMAN
[runs up] You guys! You guys! [pants] Guess what?
KYLE
What, fatass?!
CARTMAN
I've become a man! I started puberty, you guys! [grins]
KENNY
(...What?)
STAN
No you didn't!
CARTMAN
Yes! I really did.
STAN
How do you know?
CARTMAN
Well, because yesterday I got my period. [lets the words hang there for a moment]
KYLE
You got your what?
CARTMAN
My period, you guys. You see, there comes a time in every child's life when they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass for a few days every month.
STAN
You're making that up! [a woman steps out of a small building, and he addresses her] Miss Aliton, what's it mean to get a period?
MISS ALITON
Well boys, ah-I don't think I can tell you. Ah-
STAN
Please, it's important.
MISS ALITON
Well, it's when puberty hits and you bleed, you know, down there. [points to the region]
KYLE
Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right! [Miss Aliton turns and walks away. The boys turn to face Cartman]
CARTMAN
Well guys, I'm afraid I won't be able to hang out with you on New Year's Eve. I have to hang out with the older crowd because now, I'm ma-ture. [begins to dance away backwards] I got my period, and you guys didn't. I got my period, and you guys didn't. [skips out of view]
STAN
Dude, Cartman can't hit puberty before us.
KYLE
Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out my ass.

[TV 4 News Flash]
ANCHOR TOM
In local news, a stomach virus is going around that is causing bleeding of the colon in some small children. Doctors are telling parents that the virus is nothing to worry about and that the infections can be dealt with simple antibiotics. [turns to face another camera, and a new picture, "New Year's Eve 1999" appears] Well, it's just four days until New Year's Eve, 1999. The new millennium is almost upon us, and all over the world people have started to celebrate by dancing, singing, and killing one another. [In New York, amid burning buildings, one man beats another man over the head with a bat. In Paris, people drop down from on high, and in Beijing people torch each other] But probably the biggest event of the millennium is one happening in South Park, Colorado, where people have gathered for a chance to see Jesus Christ. Craig Netzel is standing by.
[Reporter Craig Netzel in South Park. Television cameras are everywhere]
NETZEL
Thanks, Tom. It is indeed four days until the new millennium, and hundreds if not thousands of people have come from all over the world seeking Jesus, here at his house in South Park. [the camera begins to pan to the right. A man with two kids next to him sit in chairs. Skeeter and his friends are there, too] Everyone is giddy with anticipation for Jesus to come out, because as we all know, if Jesus comes out of his house and is not scared by his shadow, it means the next thousand years will be full of peace and love. [the front door opens] Oh, it looks like Jesus might be coming out! [turns to face the house. Jesus peeks out from it]
WOMAN
[picks up her son and points Jesus out] Oh look, Tommy. There he is. Can you see him?
BOY
He's neat, Mommy. [cameras go off as the crowd stands behind some "Jesus line. Do not cross" lines. Jesus drops back into his house, then peeks out again]
NETZEL
[softly] Everyone is quiet here, Tom. Looks like the little fellow's a bit nervous. [Jesus moves forward] But he has taken another step out, Tom! This is great new for us!
JESUS
Uh-mmm, um what are you people doing? [people lower their cameras, puzzled] Can I help you with something? [no one moves]
NETZEL
...Well, it's... the millennium, Jesus.
JESUS
Uuh-huh?
NETZEL
Well, it's "The Millennium".
MAN 1
Yeah.
MAN 2
Yeah.
MAN 3
Yeah.
CAMERAMAN
Right.
JESUS
So, what happens at the millennium?
NETZEL
...I don't know.

Yeah, you're supposed to know!

Yeah, you're Jesus.

Hey!

You're the one in control.

Oh. Well. Yea. Believe in me and ye shall find peace.

Yeah yeah yeah, we've heard that crap for about 2000 years now! We wanna hear somethin' new! It's the year 2000, for Christ's sake!
CROWD
Yeah!
JESUS
Well, what do ya want?
FR. MAXI
We want to see God!
RANDY
Yeah, with our own eyes.
CROWD
Yeah!
JIMBO
We followed blindly for thousands of years and we think the least God can do is show up for New Year's Eve 1999!
CROWD
Yeah!
WOMAN
That's right!
JESUS
Oh. Uuuh, let me think about that for a minute. [backs up and closes the door. The people in the crowd are left to talk amongst themselves]
MAN WITH PICKET SIGN
[to man to his left] Is that good?
MAN 7

MAN 8

[The Marsh house, living room. The phone rings and Stan goes to answer it.]
STAN
Hello?
KYLE
Dude, did you get your period yet?
STAN
No, there's no blood coming out of my ass.
KYLE
Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty.
STAN
Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways.
KYLE
Yeah.
[The McCormick shack, the restroom. Kenny reads from the South Park Enquirer on the pot. A stool drops into the toilet, and Kenny gets up to check it out]
KENNY
[seeing the red streak] (Woohoo! [jumps for joy] Woohoooo!)
[Al's Pharmacy. Inside, the boys check out various tampons. Cartman looks over a box of Breeze tampons]
STAN
Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's.
CARTMAN
Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people. [drops the Breeze and picks up the Plug-Ups. Softly] Let's see. Offers complete protection during heavy flow, hm. [swaps the Plug-Ups for the Cotton Cork] Lessee, might slow stoppage of vaginal chunks, eh. [swaps the Cotton Cork for the Beaver Dam] Oh, this one's got wings, you guys!
KENNY
[rushes in] (You guys! You guys, I did it! I got my very own period!)
CARTMAN
[pleased] You did?
KYLE
You got your period too, Kenny?
KENNY
(Yeah, it was awesome! I was just sitting down and then I got my period!)
CARTMAN
Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you're a man. We can hang out together on New Year's Eve. [Stan shrugs, but looks worried] But first you need to buy some Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don't get blood on your underwear.
KENNY
[exults] (Woo-hoo!)
[Jesus' house. The crowd awaits his decision. Inside, Jesus paces the floor]
NETZEL
[from the TV] Tom, it looked for a second as if Jesus was going to come out of his house, but then he went back inside. But meanwhile, more and more people are showing up to show their support for Jesus. [a man holds up a sign saying: "It's the end of the MILLENIUM. Please don't kill us JESUS". Jesus looks in wonder]
RANCHER
[holding a Bible] Well, the way I see it, if he really is who he says he is, well then he'd better do somethin' on New Year's Eve, 'cause it's in the Bible!
JESUS
[sighs heavily] Father, I need to talk to you. Please, Father, appear to me. [a flash of light and swirling clouds follow as Jesus comes forward to meet his father]
GOD
[voice-over] What is it, my child?
JESUS
Father, everyone is starting to pay attention to me again because of the new millennium. Huh-I'm kinda making a comeback!
GOD
Yea, like John Travolta before you. You are experiencing a second revival.
JESUS
It's the millennium, Father. People want to see you.
GOD
Nay, their eyes are not yet prepared to see the likes of me.
JESUS
But dad, I think this may be my one big shot at a comeback.
GOD
Be ye careful of pride, Jesus.
JESUS
Just make an appearance. You can come down, say 'hi' to a few people and can be back by 12:30.
GOD
I'm sorry, my son, but if you want to earn everyone's love, you will have to do it yourself.
[The Broflovski house, living room, day. Ike is playing with a set of blocks. Kyle approaches him.]
KYLE
Ike, can I talk to you? [sits down next to Ike]
IKE
Uh ar, stufid.
KYLE
Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't!
IKE
Whoa won toooo-reeee.
KYLE
Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore.
IKE
No. Martur sucker. Moghee. Muckeh m'gwoss. Tabyudog.
KYLE
Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little.
IKE
Cokeh mocker.
KYLE
[stands and moves out] Thanks a lot, Ike!
[The bus stop, day. Stan, Kenny and Cartman are hanging out there.]
STAN
So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's Eve with us?
CARTMAN
Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's Eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny?
KENNY
(No. All I could get was a couple of tampons.)
CARTMAN
Tampon? What's a tampon?
KENNY
(See, a tampon is what you stick up your ass so you don't bleed.)
CARTMAN
Ew, doesn't that hurt?
KENNY
(A little.)
KYLE
[rushes up quite excited] You guys! I got my period, too!
CARTMAN
Wow, cool!
STAN
[frightened] You did?
KYLE
Yeah! [Stan looks down sadly] I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place.
CARTMAN
All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this "Women Who Run With The Wolves" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers.
KYLE
Awesome! We get powers?
CARTMAN
Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for New Year's Eve! [Stan is left alone, but Cartman returns] Hey, don't feel bad, Stan. Some of us just mature a little later than others. [walks away]
[Stan's room, night. He's ready for bed, but sits at his desk with pencil and paper at the ready. He picks the pencil up and writes]
STAN
Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. If you wouldn't mind, I don't wanna be the only kid who doesn't get his period before the new year. Could you speed up my development a little? Thanks, God. Your friend, Stan [He sets his pencil down and goes to bed]
[Jesus' house, outside, night. The camera crews and crowd keep vigil. One window on the house is lit from within]
JESUS
Are you there, God? It's me, Jesus. I feel like I've got a real shot at a comeback, God. For whatever reason, people are starting to follow me again. I'm 2000 years old, but I feel like I'm 28 again! I think I'm going to win everybody back, because I just made a few phone calls, and I'm going to put on the most amazing New Year's spectacle this world has ever seen!

PHILLIP

ANNOUNCER
Good morning, South Park, it's 8 a.m., [Stan awakens] and only two more days until the new millennium! [Stan moves towards the radio, than away from it, then hides under the covers, then sprints for the restroom. Quickly, he lowers his pajamas and briefs]
STAN
Dammit! Dammit dammit dammit!
SHARON
Stanley, honey, what's the matter?
STAN
[sobbing] I'm not bleeding out my aahass!
SHARON
Well, that's good, honey.
STAN
No it's not! It's terrible! [Sharon looks worried. Stan returns to his bed and prays] Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. How come you didn't help me? I know you're really busy with things, but this is a matter of life and death. If I don't get my period, my friends won't let me hang out with them on New Year's Eve. Please, please give me my period soon.
[Jesus' house, day, one day before New Year's eve. The camera crews and crowd keep vigil. A woman yawns, and the front door opens again]
JIMBO
Here he comes!
MR. GARRISON
He's coming out!
JESUS
[steps out and closes the door] ...I have given it much thought, my children, and you are right. After reviewing the Bible, it does indeed say that something very big is going to happen at the millennium. [the crowd cheers and jumps for joy] I have spoken to my Father in heaven, and he agreed that the millennium is significant to all of us. And ye who believe in me SHALL be rewarded! [more cheering and jumping] So what we're going to do tomorrow night, New Year's Eve, 1999: we just got ROD STEWART to agree to play a comeback concert at the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, and you're all going! [...silence]
MAN
...We knew you could do it, Jesus! [the crowd begins to cheer again, and Jesus grins]
MR. GARRISON
Well, I'd better book my ass a flight to Vegas! [hurries away]
FR. MAXI
[beings to sing. Others step aside]
For he is Savior
For he is Lord
CROWD
He gives me hope when
I have only been bored
And he lifts me up with
His gentle arm...

KYLE

CARTMAN
Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?!
KENNY
[with fine pendant on his hood and purple cape] (Dammit, here!)
CARTMAN
And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool.
KYLE
I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde.
KENNY
(Yes, I agree. I think Craig is a thousand times as cool as Clyde. There doesn't really seem to be a doubt.)
CARTMAN
Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first.
KYLE
Oh. Ah-ah. Ah-uh-m-m.
CARTMAN
What's the matter, Kyle?
KYLE
Nothing. Um [clears his throat], my period is really uuuh... [Cartman looks on skeptically] Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly.
CARTMAN
...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too.
KENNY
(And mine too.)
KYLE
[sighs] Phew.

STAN
[despondent] Hey, Chef.
CHEF
How's it going?
STAN
Bad.
CHEF
Why bad?
STAN
Can I come in?
CHEF
Well, sure. [Stan enters and Chef closes the door. They sit on the sofa] Now, what's the matter, little cracker?
STAN
Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't.
CHEF
OOH, you're talkin' about your older sister, Shelly.
STAN
No.
CHEF
Your little girlfriend, Wendy.
STAN
Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't.
CHEF
Look, Stan. Do you really know what a period is?
STAN
Yeah, Cartman told us.
CHEF
Stan, let me sing you a little song about the menstrual cycle. I think it might clear things up for you. [gets up and faces him]
STAN
Okay.
CHEF
Ooo baby, yeah baby, ooo baby.
Yeah baby, yeah baby, now baby.
Ooo yeah, yes yes baby
Yeahyeahyeah, uh-huh baby now
Agh! Agh! Awww! No, baby!
Ewww, baby! No, no!
Alright now—I'm alright, I'm-I'm cool, it's okay.
Uh alright, watch out for the bedspread, baby.
Look out now, it's- alright, I'll tell you what.
Uuh, how about uuh, uh.
Why don't I call you next week?
And that's my song about the menstrual cycle, Stan. Did that clear things up for you?
STAN
[thinks] ...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time.
CHEF
...Is that what I said?
STAN
But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year-old boy! I'm gonna do something about it! [hops off and heads out the door.]
CHEF
Whoa! I musta missed a WHOLE middle part there.
[Rod Stewart's mansion, day. Jesus sits on a leather sofa with Stewart's agent. Around them are Grammys, some pictures of Stewart and framed gold records]
AGENT
I can't tell you how excited Rod Stewart is about this millennium concert. He's gotten a little older, but you're gonna see how much he can still rock.
JESUS
Hoh, I'm excited too. I think it will bring my Father's children back to their faith and back to mine eyes, for I an the Lamb of God.
AGENT
Yeah t-and uh, you know, Rod is a seasoned veteran, so I'm gonna have to ask for a bit more cash, but we could talk about that later; here comes Rod now. [some double doors open, and a nurse wheels Rod into the room]
ROD
Hullo-o-o.
JESUS
[surprised, but quickly recovers and shakes Rod's hand] Hey, Rod, great to see you.
ROD
Oh.
JESUS
Uh, the folks are sure glad you're playing. It's really given them a lot of faith in me again. I'm sure that together, we can make this millennium party the best New Year's bash ever!
ROD
Pooped pants.
JESUS
What?
ROD
Pooped pants.
JESUS
Poo pants?
ROD
Pooped 'nmuh pants.
JESUS
Uh, you pooped your pants?
ROD
Pooped in my pants.
JESUS
Oh Uh-n nurse? Mr. Stewart has apparently pooped his pants?
NURSE
Again?! [turns Rod around to wheel him away] Now, Mr. Stewart, what did we say about trying to hold in Mr. Dookie? [exits with Rod. Jesus can only look on, shocked]
[Genetic Engineering Ranch, night]
DR. MEPHESTO
[leading Stan into the lab] Yes, puberty is a very wonderful thing, Stan. It's what links us all together, makes us one.
STAN
But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty.
DR. MEPHESTO
Never went through puberty? Who never went through puberty?
STAN
Nn-nobody! I mean, uh, well, m-my dad.
DR. MEPHESTO
Your father never went through puberty?
STAN
No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself.
DR. MEPHESTO
Oh, I can't say that I blame him.
STAN
So do you know anything that can help him?
DR. MEPHESTO
Well, I should think the most logical solution would be... hormones.
STAN
Hormones? [smiles. Mephesto takes him to the medicine cabinet]
DR. MEPHESTO
Yes! [removes a bottle of PURE HORMONES] Here, and tell your father to take just one of these pills every week. It could be just what he needs. And be sure to tell him that his secret is safe with me.
STAN
Thanks a lot, Dr. Mephesto. You're the best! [walks away with the bottle]
DR. MEPHESTO
My pleasure. I just love helping people.
[Genetic Engineering Ranch, outside. Stan looks at the bottle and reads the prescription:
"one tablet weekly." He pops the lid off... One tablet falls, and then the empty bottle.]
[The Ewok Village 2000, next day. Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny have reassembled.]
CARTMAN
Now, for our first club activity, we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word means to us. [tips the bowl towards Kyle, who reaches in and takes a slip of paper]
KYLE
[unfurls and reads] Okay. Today's word is "spirituality." What that means to me is uh- [thump. The three look up]
STAN
[outside, below] Hey assholes! [the three rise and head for a window]
CARTMAN
Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet.
STAN
[now with some facial hair] Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones!
KYLE
Hormones?
STAN
Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!
KYLE
Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones.
CARTMAN
Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew.
STAN
So what are we gonna do for New Year's?
CARTMAN
Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go.
STAN
[voice breaking] Aaaargh. I'm gonna go take some more hormones. [walks away. The other three withdraw and resume their discussion]
CARTMAN
Now, the word is "spirituality." I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she-
KENNY
(Ooooowwwwwwwhh.) [leans forward in pain]
CARTMAN
Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has-
KENNY
(Oh- ooowww!)
CARTMAN
Goddammit, Kenny, shut the hell up!
KENNY
(Aaaaaa!) [falls back and passes out. Blood spews up from his mouth]
KYLE
Whoa, dude!
[Hell's Pass Hospital. An ambulance is parked outside. Inside, the McCormick parents sit in the waiting room holding hands]
DR. DOCTOR
Mr. and Ms. McCormick.
MCCORMICK PARENTS
Yes?
DR. DOCTOR
I'm sorry. We... couldn't save your son.
MS. MCCORMICK
[sobbing] Oh my God, my little Kenny's gone. I can't believe it.
DR. DOCTOR
We just didn't get to him in time. There's nothing we could do.
STUART
What happened? What killed him, doctor?
DR. DOCTOR
Well, we found a... tampon stuck up your child's ass. Apparently, he'd had it up there for several days. It plugged him up until he finally burst from the inside out like a ruptured septic tank.
MS. MCCORMICK
[sobbing] Oh my God.
DR. DOCTOR
My worry is that he could have been following some kind of crazy new fad. Perhaps the children are all shoving tampons up their ass because they've seen the Backstreet Boys doing it on TV or something.
MS. MCCORMICK
[sobbing] Gi-ih [gulp]
DR. DOCTOR
We must get to the bottom of this! ...if you'll pardon the pun. But actually, right now, I've got to catch a plane to Las Vegas to see the Rod Stewart Millennium Show.
STUART
Rod Stewart's gonna be in Vegas?
[Las Vegas, night. Klieg lights search the sky as a large crowd gathers for the concert. Craig Netzel is on scene]
NETZEL
Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas, where tomorrow night THE New Year's Eve event is going to happen. Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, is presenting Rod Stewart, the undisputed King of Pop, right here at this hotel behind me. [tents and stands pepper the grounds. Some of them have been seen in South Park before] It looks as though Jesus really has come through. [Jesus is in his room looking at the report] Everyone is very excited, because rumor has it that God Himself is gonna show up to the event.
JESUS
[shocked] What??
NETZEL
How about you, ma'am? Do you think God is gonna show up tomorrow night?
MA'AM
[in party hat] Of course he is. This is Jesus we're talking about. He wouldn't let us down.
JESUS
[turns off the TV] Oh no! Are you there, God? Father, will you please reconsider and show up tomorrow? [no answer] ...Hello?
[New Year's Eve, morning. Stan's radio alarm goes off]
SHARON
Stanley. [Stan awakes. A beard is forming] Wake up, honey. It's time to leave for Las Vegas. [he jumps out of bed and walks past a Terrance and Phillip full-length mirror. He stops, walks backwards, and looks at his reflection, strokes his sparse beard, turns to look at himself from the side...]
STAN
Who-o-oa, du-ude. I've got boobs.
[Las Vegas, New Year's Eve, 1999, night. The stage area. The crowds erupts in anticipation]
CARTMAN
[walks in with Kyle] Hey, Las Vegas is a pretty cool place for us mature people. [Jesus takes the stage and speaks]
JESUS
Alright, people. Are we ready to rock the millennium?! [the crowd roars. Jesus steps backstage and prays] Father in heaven, please let tonight's show go well. Please make them like it.
KYLE
[Butters is already next to Cartman] Hey, here comes Stan.
STAN
[walks up, with a deep boy voice] Have I missed anything?
CARTMAN
Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there.
KYLE
Did you get your period yet, Stan?
STAN
No. I didn't, but-
CARTMAN
Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas. [he and Kyle walk off]
JESUS
Well, I tell you one thing. I sure as heck am excited. We've got about four hours to the new year, and so I think it's time to START IT UP! Ladies and gentlemen, as promised, Mr. Rod "Do You Think I'm Sexy?" Stewart! [the curtains open as Jesus steps aside. The nurse rolls Rod up to the mic and walks away as the band plays. The crowd has no reaction. The band pauses after a while, so Rod can sing]
ROD
O-o-oh. [the band riffs a bit] O-oh. [the band plays on. Jesus keeps time] O-o-o-oh. Be-eh-o-o-or. [Stan walks around and then sits on a curb, truly depressed. Rod continues to sing unintelligibly]
JIMBO
[disgusted] Whoa, man.
ROD
Oh. Uh pooped 'em. [the band resumes play as the nurse brings a bucket on stage and checks him out]
MR. GARRISON
This sucks balls!
BLONDE
Yeah!
MAN 7
Alright, enough of this! Bring out God!
MAN 9
Yeah!
JESUS
Oh no.
CROWD
We want God! We want God! We want God!
JESUS
["We want God"] Please, Father. Do something.
CROWD
We want God!
JESUS
[goes onstage again] Uh, folks, I'm afraid God can't make it tonight.
RANDY
We came all the way to Las Vegas for this?!
WOMAN
This is the worst New Year's ever! Thanks a lot, Jesus!
SKEETER
Let's get him! [leads the charge to the stage]
[Craig Netzel with some breaking news. The crowd has begun to riot.]
NETZEL
Well, Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas in what is quickly becoming known as "the gayest party ever." Everyone is so outraged that they are building a large cross in which to once again crucify our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. [behind him, two men pop in and out of view. One holds a bat, the other runs back and forth. The man with the bat beats the other man down, but the other man pops up and continues running]
STAN
[goes onstage] Jesus, why does God hate me?
JESUS
Huh? He doesn't hate you, he hates me. He's gonna let me be crucified again.
STAN
He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me.
JESUS
Well, yeah, but just because God doesn't answer your prayers doesn't mean he doesn't care about you.
STAN
Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted?
JESUS
Well, God can't just answer every prayer and suddenly give you everything you want. That takes all the living out of life.
STAN
What do you mean?
JESUS
If God answered all our prayers, there'd be nothing left for us to do ourselves. Life is about problems, and overcoming those problems. [becomes reflective] A-and growing and learning from obstacles. If God just fixed everything for us, then there'd be no point in our existence. [realizes something] That's why he wouldn't show up to my New Year's party.
STAN
I just wanted my period.
JESUS
I get it now, Father. I had to learn all this on my own. [Skeeter and five other men bring a large cross in] I was overcome with my new popularity and, and I let pride get in the way of good judgment. [a bright light appears in the sky and descends towards the stage. The crowd gapes in awe]
MAN
Whoa, what is that??
JESUS
[the light approaches him] It's Dad.
FR. MAXI
God? God is going to show himself??
WOMAN
Look, I can see him. [the light begins to bathe the crowd]
JESUS
Father. You came.
GOD
Now look upon Me, My children, and know Me. [now the crowd is shocked] Be ye not afraid. [God is shown as some kind of short-legged squirrel, elephant, cat, hippopotamus hybrid] Blessed art thou, my children. [a man's party blower falls from his lips]
RANDY
That's God?
JESUS
Yea, 'tis my Father, the Creator. He is the Alpha and the Omega. [a snake's tongue lashes out from God's mouth] The Beginning and the End.
MR. GARRISON
Well, yeah, but that??
GOD
What did you expect me to look like, My son?
MR. GARRISON
[thinks a moment] ...Well not like that!
GOD
Since it is the end of the first 2000 years, I will allow you, My children, to ask me one question.
GERALD
[next to Mr. Mackey] One question?
MR. MACKEY
Only one?
SHARON
What should we ask him?
CHEF
We have to think carefully. We can ask him anything we want, like, "What's the meaning of life?" or "Why are we here?".
STAN
I have it. I have the question. [steps forth] Now you have to answer me once and for all! How come I haven't gotten my period yet?! [the crowd stands aghast]
GOD
[after a while] My child, you are a boy. Boys do not get periods. That's only for girls. Your friends were bleeding a little bit out of their asses because of an acute colon infection. And your friend Kyle simply lied about it.
KYLE
[exposed] How do know that?
GOD
You will hit puberty when the time is right. But you will never have a period, because you are a man — with titties. Thus spaketh the Lord. And now I return to heaven. [transforms into the light and returns the way he came]
MR. GARRISON
Hey, wait! That doesn't count as our question, does it??
GOD
I'll answer another on New Year's Eve, in the year 4000. [zips away]
STAN
Did you hear that everybody? I'm not even supposed to have my period; that's why God wasn't answering me before! [people look at him, annoyed] Boy, I'm sure everything worked out okay. [looks around] I guess now we can all celebrate the New Year, huh?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
[end credits roll]
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne?
For auld lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne...
SKEETER
Let's get him.
STAN
Let's have a cup o
-Aaaa! [mayhem ensues as people riot, breaking wood and glass all around. A gunshot is heard, a couple of women scream, and the rioting goes on]

synopsis:The children of South Park are invited to Arkansas for the "Four Million Child Blow 2000," the first worldwide recorder concert.

script:World Wide Recorder Concert

[A promo is the first thing shown. Live-action shots throughout]
ANNOUNCER
This Saturday, Pox presents the musical event of the new millennium! You all remember playing the recorder in elementary school! [a recorder resting on a book of sheet music is shown] Well, this Saturday in Oklahoma City [its skyline is shown], over 4 million third-grade students [a crowd of them is shown] from all over the country [a school bus full of students is shown] will gather in one place, and at the same time, play "My Country 'Tis Of Thee" on their recorders. [a girl is shown playing a white one] It's the largest third-grade recorder concert ever! [An elderly man instructs three students, one of them in a wheelchair] Special guest conductor Yoko Ono [pictured] and woodwind virtuoso Kenny G [pictured] will lead this fantastic event! This Saturday, at 11 Eastern / 10 Central. The world will be watching! [close-up of a small boy playing his recorder]
[South Park Elementary, day, Mr. Garrison's classroom. He rushes to the front of the class and stands next to a pull-down screen on which is projected "My Country 'Tis Of Thee"]
MR. GARRISON
Okay children, we've still got some time to practice the song before we load up the bus and head out for Oklahoma.
CLASS
[groaning] Awww.
MR. GARRISON
Now, come on, there's gonna be over 4 million third-graders from all over the country there, and I wanna make sure South Park is the best! Okay?! [raises his baton] Recorders up. [the students set their recorders between their lips] And a-1 and a-2 and a- [the class begins to play the song. Some students play slow] "...of liberty." You're late! [the kids play faster, but are still off] "...my father-" What the hell was that?! [the students lower their recorders] God-damnit, I don't think you children have been working on your fingering!
CARTMAN
That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long.
KYLE
[Kenny laughs] Shut up, fatass!
CARTMAN
Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle's mom says Kyle's getting really good at fingering, heh. [Kenny laughs so hard he falls off his seat]
MR. GARRISON
Shut up, Eric! There's gonna be 4 million children playing this song at the same time on their recorders, and, so help me God, South Park Elementary is not gonna be the only ones that don't know the song! Try again! Recorders up. [the students set their recorders between their lips] And a-1 and a-2 and a- [the class begins to play the song. Mr. Garrison genuflects and bangs his head against his desk. Mr. Mackey walks in, looking at this behavior]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, that sounded great, kids. [Mr. Garrison looks up at him]
MR. GARRISON
[rising] Sure, if you like the sound of a peacock getting its neck broken.
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, kids. Uh, we have some news. Uh, there's been a terrible flood in Oklahoma, m'kay? So the 4-million-recorder-children's event is being moved to Arkansas.
MR. GARRISON
[close-up. He's suddenly scared] Arkansas?
STAN
What's Arkansas—is that a state?
MR. MACKEY
Eh, the trip shouldn't take any longer, but I'll hand out these updated contact sheets so that your parents will know where you are, m'kay? [hands them out. Craig reads his sheet.]
MR. GARRISON
Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you for a second?
MR. MACKEY
M'kay. [joins Mr. Garrison aside]
MR. GARRISON
Mr. Mackey, um... I can't go to Arkansas. Somebody's gonna have to fill in for me.
MR. MACKEY
What? We can't find anybody to fill in for you. Why can't you go to Arkansas?
MR. GARRISON
[wistfully] Arkansas is where I grew up. My parents live there—my [stifles a sob] ...father still lives there.
MR. MACKEY
Well, don't you want to see them?
MR. GARRISON
I haven't seen my father for 23 years.
MR. MACKEY
Uh, perhaps you should sit down, Mr. Garrison, m'kay? [walks him over to a chair and sits him down] Mr. Garrison, I know this is very difficult, m'kay, but I must ask: is there a history of sexual abuse in your family?
MR. GARRISON
...Some, yes. There was my uncle, Richard. He... he molested me.
MR. MACKEY
When was that?
MR. GARRISON
Saturday. Last, last Saturday. He's a paraplegic, but it didn't—
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, eh, and your father? He molested you when you were a boy? [Mr. Garrison begins to cry] Mr. Garrison, I think, when we get to Arkansas, you need to see your father. You need to face this demon in your closet, m'kay?
MR. GARRISON
[turns away] Don't look at me! Uh, y'all go on your bastard trip and just- don't look at me! [hurries out of the classroom crying]
CARTMAN
That was pretty cool.
MR. MACKEY
M'kay.
[The trip begins. Inside the bus, Mr. Mackey is up front reading a book, Mr. Garrison is in the very back opposite Terrence and the redhead]
CARTMAN
[with recorder] Okay, how about this one, Kenny? [plays an A note]
KENNY
(Uh-uh.)
CARTMAN
No? How about this? [plays a G note]
KENNY
(Nope.)
CARTMAN
Hm, interesting. Let's see: how about this? [plays a Gb note. Kyle and Stan turn around on their seat]
KYLE
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
CARTMAN
We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control.
STAN
What's "lose bowel control?"
CARTMAN
That's a scientific term for crapping your pants.
KYLE
Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!
CARTMAN
Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!
KYLE
Nuh-uh!
CARTMAN
How about this one, Kenny? [plays an F note]
KENNY
(Nuh-uh.)
KYLE
There is no brown noise, fat boy!
CARTMAN
That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter.
STAN
Who's Karen Carpenter?
MR. GARRISON
Aaaaaah! [apparently, he's seen a sign that reads: "Arkansas 410 miles. Rest Stop 5 miles"] Huhh, ohh, [the students and Mr. Mackey look back.]
MR. MACKEY
Mr. Garrison, are you alright?
MR. HAT
Mr. Garrison isn't here right now.
MR. MACKEY
M'kay-Mr. Garrison, you're just having a hard time dealing with the memories of your father's sexual abuse, so you switch personalities to Mr. Hat, m'kay?
MR. HAT
Oh, good one, Sherlock! You figure that out all by yourself?!
MR. MACKEY
M'kay-I think the best thing for Mr. Garrison to do is to go see his father.
MR. HAT
No! No, you moron! [Mr. Mackey gets annoyed] Mr. Garrison can't let the memories end! Just leave us alone!
MR. MACKEY
M'kay! Mr. Hat, you need to let me talk to Mr. Garrison, m'kay?!
MR. HAT
Why would he want to talk to a second-rate dopey-ass elementary-school psychologist?!
MR. MACKEY
What did you say?!
MR. HAT
You heard me, jackass! There's monkeys that make better counselors than you!
MR. MACKEY
Why, you son of a bitch! [rips Mr. Hat from Mr. Garrison's hand and starts beating him up. Mr. Hat smacks Mr. Mackey down in front of Terrence, who looks aghast]
STAN
Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting. [the other students turn to see the fight]
MR. MACKEY
I'm gonna kick your ass, m'kay?! [resumes fighting Mr. Hat]
STUDENTS
[cheering] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
MS. CRABTREE
BE QUIET BACK THERE!
MR. MACKEY
Yuh-NO! [panting, dirty and black-eyed, gets up and places Mr. Hat between Mr. Garrison's arms] You may have won this time, Mr. Hat.
[The journey continues. The school bus and its passengers finally reach their destination - a large lot filled with buses and tents, and children]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, I want everyone to stay together, m'kay? Nobody move!
COORDINATOR
[a female with clipboard, walking up] School?
MR. MACKEY
Excuse me?
COORDINATOR
What school are you from?
MR. MACKEY
Oh, uh we're from South Park, Colorado?
COORDINATOR
Ssss, alright. South Park school, you go over there next to the kids from New York. [distracted by something away from the bus] Nono, don't put the Florida kids in the building! [moves away. The class walks past the New York children]
NEW YORK KID 1
[sitting on the bus's front right fender] Ey! Look at the little Eskimos in their freakin' hats and gloves.
NEW YORK KID 2
Yeah, huh? [they begin to snicker as the South Park kids look back]
NEW YORK KID 1
Whoa, look at this kid's coat. [Kenny's] Ey, kid. What's the matter—you a freakin' burn victim or somethin'? What? [the others laugh]
KYLE
[aside, to Stan] Who the hell are these guys?
NEW YORK KID 1
I didn't know they was invitin' rednecks to this event!
STAN
We're not rednecks!
KYLE
Yeah! That's Texas, butthole!
NEW YORK KID 1
Oh yeah? Well, you look like a bunch of queefs to me, huh?! [the other New Yorkers laugh]
CARTMAN
[aside, to Stan, softly] Stan, what's a queef?
KYLE
Kenny?
KENNY
(I don't know!)
NEW YORK KID 1
Oh, brother! You guys don't even know what a queef is, huh?!
CARTMAN
Of course we know what a queef is, you queef!
BLACK KID
[wearing EKKO shirt] Oh yeah? Well, what is it, then?!
CARTMAN
Aaaa-
STAN
Why?! Don't you know?!
NEW YORK KID 1
Are all redneck queefs from Colorado as stupid as youse?!
KYLE
Alright, dickhole! [feedback is heard, and all look to the source]
COORDINATOR
[on bullhorn] I need everyone's attention, please! We will now all be moving in an orderly fashion to our assigned hotels. Please follow your group leader to check in.
NEW YORK KID 1
[as South Park leaves] Yeah see ya later, queefs! [at least Stan and Kyle are pissed off. They look angry as they look at each other]
[Roman Holiday Inn, night. The four boys share a room with two beds. They sit amid stacks of books looking for information]
KYLE
Ungh, I can't find the word "queef" anywhere! [drops his book]
STAN
[reading another book] Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again!
KYLE
Well, let's try the dictionary. [picks it up] queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef.
STAN
Damnit! [closes his book]
CARTMAN
[reading another book, jumps for joy] Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it!
STAN
You did? [the other three gather around]
KYLE
What's it mean?! What's it mean?!
CARTMAN
I told you guys! Here it is, right here. "The brown noise."
KYLE
Awwgh!
STAN
Damnit Cartman, wha-?!
CARTMAN
"An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen." See? That means crap your pants. "The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb." What does that mean?
STAN
Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading! [he and the other two return to their books and read on]
[Garrison's home town, night. He walks to his former home, his parents' house, in the rain]
MR. GARRISON
[on the walkway, sighs] I can do this. I have to do this. [approaches the door and rings the bell. His father answers] Hello. Dad.
MR. GARRISON SR.
Oh, hello, son.
MR. GARRISON
Can I ...come in?
MR. GARRISON SR.
Ub. Sure, of course. [Mr. Garrison enters] Your mom's out at Bridge Night. You want a beer or somethin'?
MR. GARRISON
No. I don't think that will solve any of our problems, though you seem to think it did.
MR. GARRISON SR.
Uh, what?
MR. GARRISON
I have a lot of demons that I need to face, father. I need to know some things.
MR. GARRISON SR.
Uh, okay, like what?
MR. GARRISON
Alright, alright, let's just cut right to it! [sighs] I've come to ask you about the sexual abuse, dad!
MR. GARRISON SR.
What??
MR. GARRISON
I have to know why! Right here and now—we're gonna talk about this!
MR. GARRISON SR.
What the hell are you talking about?! I never sexually abused you!
MR. GARRISON
I know! I wanna know why not?!
MR. GARRISON SR.
WHAT??
MR. GARRISON
Was it that I was ugly?!
MR. GARRISON SR.
Oh, my God! [turns around]
MR. GARRISON
I wasn't good enough for you! Was that it, Dad?!
MR. GARRISON SR.
Well, NO!! [walks away, but his son rushes up to grab him]
MR. GARRISON
Sure, you can go off and screw any whore on Wyland Street, but when it came to your own son you were just too busy! [runs off crying. Mr. Garrison Sr. can only express shock.]
[The 4 Million Child Blow 2000 lot, next day. Looks like the 4 million kids are assembled]
COORDINATOR
[Onstage] Alright, everyone, quiet please! There are over 4 million of you, so we must have quiet! At this time I would like to introduce the woman who is making this all possible, Yoko Ono! [motions for Yoko to enter]
YOKO ONO
Please [orates 20 seconds of incomprehensible, imitation, Japanese-accented English]... sing song "My Country 'Tis of Thee."
COORDINATOR
You heard her, We'll start the rehearsal in a few minutes.
STAN
Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means.
KYLE
Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means.
STAN
No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's make up our own word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em.
KYLE
Yeah. That'll make 'em look stupid!
STAN
What word could we make up?
KYLE
How about... finkleroy?
STAN
No, uhno, not finkleroy.
CARTMAN
How about geebo, or, or mung?
STAN
Yeah, mung.
KYLE
Mung's good.
STAN
Sh. Here they come. [the New Yorkers arrive]
NEW YORK KID 1
Well hel-lo there, queefs. All bundled up nice and warm, are we?
STAN
You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung?
NEW YORK KID 2
We're not mung. You're mung.
KYLE
Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh?
NEW YORK KID 1
Of course we know what mung means!
ATHLETE
Yeah, D'ya think we wouldn't know what mung means? [Stan laughs, then Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny join in]
STAN
We busted you!
KYLE
Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up! [they resume laughing]
NEW YORK KID 1
You guys are even stupider than I thought! Mung is so a word!
STAN
[the boys stop laughing] It is?
NEW YORKERS
[behind the two toughs and two others] Yeah. [they turn around]
ATHLETE
It sure is.
NEW YORKER 1
Yeah.
NEW YORKER 2
Uh huh. [turns around]
NEW YORK KID 1
Yeah! Mung is the stuff that comes out when you push down on a pregnant woman's stomach.
KYLE
[winces] Eewww.
STAN
Ooogh.
NEW YORK KID 1
You guys didn't know that? [the rest of the New Yorkers turn around and they all laugh. Then, the rest of the 4 million+ kids laugh with them] Come on, guys. Let's get away from these rednecks before we get redneckasitis, or somethin'! [they leave. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny turn on Cartman]
STAN
You dumbass, Cartman!
KYLE
Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!
[The Garrison residence, day. Mrs. Garrison Sr. and her son are sipping coffee on the sofa]
MRS. GARRISON SR.
It's so nice to see you, son. I'm so proud that you're part of the 4 Million Child Recorder Blow.
MR. GARRISON
Yes. I hope it's okay if I stay here a few nights, Mother, I... I have some things I really need to talk to you about.
MRS. GARRISON SR.
About what?
MR. GARRISON
[set his cup down and sighs] Mother, did you know that ...Dad... never sexually molested me?
MRS. GARRISON SR.
That... that can't be.
MR. GARRISON
He never did, Mom, not once.
MRS. GARRISON SR.
[stands] That's not true! Your father loved you! Often!
MR. GARRISON
[stands] He never did, Mom! And I think you knew he never did!
MRS. GARRISON SR.
[cups her ears and shuts her eyes, spilling her coffee] Nohoho! No! If I knew I would have made him do it!
MR. GARRISON
You stood by and let it happen! You saw him come home drunk and then just go right to sleep!
MRS. GARRISON SR.
I'm not listening!
MR. GARRISON
Face it, Mother. He never abused me! [his mom starts to cry, and his dad enters the room carrying groceries]
MR. GARRISON SR.
Uh, what's goin' on?
MR. GARRISON
Mother won't hear the truth!
MRS. GARRISON SR.
He says you didn't molest him as a child!
MR. GARRISON SR.
Ah-I didn't! You knew I didn't!
MRS. GARRISON SR.
No! I didn't know! [cups her ears and shuts her eyes again] I'm not listening!
MR. GARRISON
You can't close your eyes forever, Mother! [she walks away, crying] Mother, wait! [runs after her. Again, Mr. Garrison Sr. is shocked]
[The 4 Million Child Blow 2000 lot, later. Kenny G has joined Yoko Ono and the coordinator onstage]
YOKO ONO
[Speaks in imitation, harshly thick, Japanese-accented English] Alright people, how many people has a copy. We must have-a practiced the ... song for the performance tomorrow, please.
COORDINATOR
Okay, children. We need to play closer attention to the sheet music. Remember, if you get lost, just follow along with Mr. Kenny G here.
CARTMAN
Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise.
KENNY
(Yeah.)
YOKO ONO
And-a one gop seven to-sand ... [the children begin to play, and she covers her ears in agony] O-o-o-o. Stop! Stop ... beh goos sa buh got pee you got dere. That was-a terrify! That was-a horri-bee! What we gonna do?!
KYLE
What the hell is that lady talking about?
STAN
I have no idea.
[The Garrison gas station. Used to be Garrison and Son, but since Mr. Garrison left, the "Son" has been crossed out. Mr. Mackey walks up to Mr. Garrison Sr., who is changing the oil on a car on blocks]
MR. MACKEY
[bends down and looks in] Uh, Mr. Garrison, Sr.?
MR. GARRISON SR.
Thuh, that's me.
MR. MACKEY
Uh, my name is Mr. Mackey. I'm your school counselor, m'kay.
MR. GARRISON SR.
[slides out and rises] What can I do for ya?
MR. MACKEY
Uh-I wanna talk to you about your son—I'm his n-therapist, m'kay.
MR. GARRISON SR.
Uh, brother! Look, I didn't sexually abuse my son when he was younger!
MR. MACKEY
Eh, you didn't?
MR. GARRISON SR.
No! He's upset because I didn't molest him!
MR. MACKEY
Oh. Hm. Uh, I guess that's a little different.
MR. GARRISON SR.
A little, yeah! He thinks if I don't molest him it means I don't love him.
MR. MACKEY
Well, now, uh, what's he supposed to think, Mr. Garrison? I mean, uh, look at all the media, all the magazine ads and television ads talkin' about "sexual molestation", m'kay? He sees all that and assumes you didn't molest him because of some flaw in his looks or personality.
MR. GARRISON SR.
I didn't do it because it's wrong!
MR. MACKEY
I know, I know, but I'm afraid this problem has run very deep through Mr. Garrison's mental state. I'm worried that if... you don't do something, well it could kill him.
MR. GARRISON SR.
Hold on a second: are you actually suggesting that I have sex with my 41-year-old son?!
MR. MACKEY
There comes a time in every father's life when he must ask himself, "How far will I go to save my son's life?"
MR. GARRISON SR.
Well, I won't have sex with him!
MR. MACKEY
Well, I've said all I can say. [walks away, then turns] I know it's difficult, but... family... is about compromises. m'kay? [walks away, then turns] Don't lose your son over this, Mr. Garrison. [emphasizes each syllable] Don't lose... your son, m'kay? [walks out of the station]
MR. GARRISON SR.
Am I the only sane person left on earth?!
[The Garrison residence, night. Mr. Garrison Sr. is now seated in his armchair watching television. News item:]
REPORTER
Tomorrow the whole world will be tuning in as over 4 million children play "My Country 'Tis Of Thee" on their recorders. [Mr. Garrison walks to the stairs behind his father, but stops to watch the report] It is by far the largest gathering of little plastic recorders in human history. Yoko Ono has...
MR. GARRISON
Well, Mom said I could sleep in the guest room tonight. Good night, Dad.
MR. GARRISON SR.
Good night. [Yoko Ono finishes rambling incoherently]
REPORTER
Words to live by.
MR. GARRISON
[pause] Guess I'll just... go on up to bed now.
MR. GARRISON SR.
Uh huh.
MR. GARRISON
[pause] Now, I don't really have any pajamas—guess I'll just... sleep in my boxers or something.
MR. GARRISON SR.
[flatly] Should be fine.
MR. GARRISON
[pause] Uh I'll leave the door open a little in case you ...need to see me about anything.
MR. GARRISON SR.
Won't be necessary.
MR. GARRISON
[steps up, then turns again] I'll just... be going up to bed now. [pause] Gueh... guess maybe I won't even wear those boxers.
MR. GARRISON SR.
I'm not going to molest you!
MR. GARRISON
You don't love me! [runs upstairs crying] I wanna die!
MR. GARRISON SR.
God-damnit! [pounds the arms of the chair with his fists, then rises and goes out the door.]
[Roman Holiday Inn, night.]
STAN
I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids.
KYLE
Yeah. They think they're so cool.
CARTMAN
[rushing into the room with Kenny wearing earmuffs] You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys!
KYLE
Calm down, Cartman.
STAN
You found what?
CARTMAN
The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look. [places some earmuffs on Stan's head] There, okay. Let's see here. [places some earmuffs on Kyle and rushes back to his side of the room] Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny?
KENNY
(Ready.) [Stan and Kyle look at each other and Cartman plays a fat bass note. Kenny farts] (Oh, [farts] shiiit. Damnit! Cartman, I've got to go to the bathroom! [bawling])
STAN
[incredulous, removes his earmuffs] No way.
KYLE
[removes his earmuffs] I don't believe it!
CARTMAN
[removes his earmuffs] Um, seriously, you guys! Come on, watch. [leads them outside where a UPS delivery man is offloading packages, and the three put on their earmuffs. He whispers] Okay. [plays that bass note again]
DELIVERY MAN
[farts] Whoa- Oh, my God! [grabs his belly and lets loose a long fart] Aaww, I crapped my pants! [rushes away with a brown stain on the seat of his pants. The boys remove their earmuffs]
KYLE
That's amazing.
CARTMAN
I told you guys!
STAN
[to Kyle] Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
CARTMAN
That they should bring back Chicago Hope for another season? Totally.
STAN
No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids.
CARTMAN
Ooooh.
KYLE
Yeah, dude!
CARTMAN
They should bring back another season of Chicago Hope though, seriously.
[Night, the Arkansas Bar. Mr. Garrison Sr. sits by himself at the bar sipping a glass of beer while others around him chatter. A man in blue shirt approaches him]
PATRON 1
Ey, what's the matter there, Garrison? You look kinda sad.
MR. GARRISON SR.
Well, I'm having some troubles at home.
PATRON 1
Well, come on. Tell us about it. We always help each other out, don't we, fellas?
PATRON 2
[with mustache] Yeah.
PATRON 3
[with goatee] Yeah, that's right.
PATRON 1
Yeah.
MR. GARRISON SR.
All right. It's just that... I mean... We're all family men here, right?
PATRON 2
Sure!
PATRON 3
Yeah we are!
BLOND
[at a table] I am. I know that.
MR. GARRISON SR.
Well, can I ask you guys a difficult question?
PATRON 1
Absolutely.
PATRON 2
Of course.
PATRON 4
Yeah, man.
PATRON 5
Come on, Garrison!
MR. GARRISON SR.
Alright. Would you have sex with your son to save his life? [the others ponder the question]
PATRON 2
...Oh, this is one of them Scruples questions, ain't it?
PATRON 1
Nono, I got a better one: Would you have sex with your mother... to save your father's life?
PATRONS
[wondering] Wooo, yeah.
PATRON 2
Oh, like if someone had a gun to your father's head and said, "Have sex with your mother or else I'll shoot him"?
PATRON 1
Yeah.
PATRON 2
Oh, that's a tough one.
PATRON 3
Hmmm.
MR. GARRISON SR.
No no wait, uh, you don't understand.
BLOND
How about if someone made you have sex with your mother and father to save your own life?
PATRONS
No, no, no way. No.
PATRON 6
But if it was to save my mother's life, uh-I think I would have to have sex with my father.
PATRON 7
Yeup.
PATRON 8
Me, too.
PATRON 9
Well, I think that goes without saying.
MR. GARRISON SR.
Weh actually, I'm just... talking about a... son.
PATRON 8
Well, personally, I would have sex with my son to save to save my mother's life. It depends, uh- how big a gun are we talkin' here?
MR. GARRISON SR.
Uh, he doesn't have a gun.
BLOND
The father doesn't have a gun?
MR. GARRISON SR.
No! Nobody's got a gun!
PATRON 3
I think if someone said, "Have sex with your mother or else I'm gonna kill your son," but he didn't have a gun, I wouldn't do it.
PATRON 2
He could have a knife, though.
PATRON 1
Yeah.
PATRON 3
Sure.
PATRON 1
Yeah, a knife.
BARTENDER
If a killer put a knife to my throat, and said, "Have sex with your father or else I'm gonna kill your mother while having sex with you," ...I would have sex with myself.
PATRON 1
...Yeah, I would [Mr. Garrison Sr. gets up and heads out the door]
PATRON 2
That's right.
PATRON 3
Uh huh.
BARTENDER
That makes sense.
PATRON 10
Mm-hm.
PATRON 1
Wasn't that right?
PATRON 3
Mm, See?
[Roman Holiday Inn, night. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are back in their room reading the sheet music]
STAN
How do we write the note, Cartman?
CARTMAN
Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this. [shows it to them on his book]
STAN
Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played. [makes the change] Come on. [the boys leave their room again and head for the New York room.] There. [tapes the music to the door. Kyle sticks a small yellow Post-It note saying "Revised Music for Tomorrow" onto the music] That should do it.
CARTMAN
Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys.
STAN
Okay, let's get back to the room. [the three walk off]
COORDINATOR
[arrives and sees the change] What's this?? [looks more closely at it] "Revised Music for Tomorrow"?? Chip, did you get revised music for tomorrow??
CHIP
What??
COORDINATOR
Ms. Ono has made revisions again! We've got to get these copied 4 million times and make the revisions to the projected music! Come on! Hurry! [hurries away.]
[The Garrison residence, later. Mr. Garrison is asleep in the guest room, which used to be his room. The back door rustles and he wakes up. Footsteps are heard]
MR. GARRISON
[sighs, then softly] Dad? [the door opens to reveal his dad's shadow.] Pop, I'm just fast asleep—I'm not hearing anything. [the shadow moves closer and closer...]
[The Garrison residence, later. Exterior shot. Energetic motion is heard inside]
MR. GARRISON
[ecstatic] Oh! Oh! Oh, Dad! Oh, goodness gracious, uh! Oh, stop Dad, stop! Whahawah, whah, how could you-hoo?!
[The Garrison residence, morning. Mr. Garrison is at the front door with his luggage]
MR. GARRISON
[well-rested and confident] Well, Mom, Dad, I guess I'd better be going. The concert is gonna start soon.
MRS. GARRISON SR.
Are you sure you can't stay one more night, son?
MR. GARRISON
No, I... think all my work here is done. Dad, I... don't know what to say; I feel closer to you than I ever have.
MR. GARRISON SR.
Well, I just hope that NOW we can put the past behind us and, and try to be a normal family again.
MR. GARRISON
We sure can! Well, I've got a worldwide-telecast recorder concert to get to.
MRS. GARRISON SR.
We'll be watching on TV. Make us proud, son.
MR. GARRISON
I will. [hugs each parent] Good-bye, Mom! Good-bye, Dad! [turns and heads cheerfully out the door] Gray skies are gonna clear up; put on a happy face...
MRS. GARRISON SR.
You did the right thing, Poppa.
MR. GARRISON SR.
I didn't do squat! [goes inside and opens a door behind which is Kenny G] Here you go, a hundred bucks. [hands Kenny G the money]
KENNY G
Oh, that's okay. Keep your money. Thanks. [walks out and away]
[The concert is introduced. Live-action shots throughout]
ANNOUNCER
Live, from Oklahoma City! [its skyline is shown] Four million third-grade students [a crowd of them is shown] from all over the country [a school bus full of students is shown] playing "My Country 'Tis Of Thee" on their recorders... "MY COUNTRY 'TIS OF THEE" special.
[The 4 Million Child Blow 2000 lot, concert day. The 4 million are assembled. Yoko Ono and Kenny G take the stage]
STAN
Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants.
KYLE
We have to watch them! We can't miss it!
KENNY G
Are we all ready to play? [almost whispering] Thanks. Okay. [loudly] Let's see the music! [the music pops up on the stage wall]
KYLE
This is gonna be sweet!
STAN
Oh no, dude. Look! [the projected music is shown] It's the music we changed! [the camera zooms in on the changed note]
CARTMAN
Uh-oh. [Kenny finally shows up]
KYLE
Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time-
YOKO ONO
One, two, sign paytah. [Kenny G starts the tune, then the children join in]
STAN, KYLE, KENNY, CARTMAN
No! [they rush towards the stage. The other kids continue playing]
STAN
Stop! Stop! [he and the other three are near the stage...]
MR. MACKEY
Uh, aren't those our boys?
MR. GARRISON
Oh, no. What are they doing?
STAN, KYLE, KENNY, CARTMAN
Noooo!!! [some of the kids part for them, but the end of the song arrives.]
[The kids play the brown noise, Kenny G and Yoko Ono double over in pain. The camera zooms out for a view of the state of Arkansas, then of North America, as people begin to groan. Shots of Beijing and Paris follow, with their citizens grabbing their asses in pain. A shot of Earth follows, then static. New York City is then shown in flames. An ambulance speeds by as people scream]
REPORTER
[soberly] Tom, I'm standing in New York City, but it could just as well be any town on Earth right now. The desolation, the damage is exactly the same in every city the whole world over. It's been just under 20 hours since everyone on Earth pooped their pants, and people still roam their damaged homes with disbelief, and loss. Rick?
RICK
[A cleanup crew is shown at work, and the camera pans over to the reporter] Alan, I'm standing at ground zero. Here, the damage is greater than anywhere. [the stage and the lot are bare, except for poop everywhere] Like the rest of the world, everyone here has crapped their pants. Some [Kenny lies dead with rats nibbling on him] crapped themselves to death. And still others ...ruined perfectly good pairs of pants. A nation mourns and tries to rebuild, but the big question that remains is, "How did this happen?" [Stan, Kyle, and Cartman walk by, whistling]
KENNY G.
Well, I see. Other than making everyone in the world crap their pants, our event went over really well.
YOKO ONO
[Chattering quickly in comical Asian-accented English] Wery well?! Wery well?! You're gonna be on Ricki Lake, I tell you again! Look at ad a bah godda circada she doin wery well?!
MR. MACKEY
[the school buses are ready to take all the third graders back to their homes] Alright, come on, everybody. We've got a long bus ride back to Colorado, m'kay? [Stan, Kyle, and Cartman come into view and stop]
KYLE
Well, that whole experience sure did suck.
STAN
Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means. [Kyle and Cartman grin]
MR. MACKEY
[passing by behind them] Uh, queef is a vaginal expulsion of gas, m'kay. [the boys look afraid to know]
KYLE
Huh?
NEW YORK KID 1
[stopping by with two others] Here they are!
NEW YORK KID 2
Yeah!
STAN
[to Kyle] Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here.
NEW YORK KID 1
Ey! Not so fast! We know it was you guys that changed the music and made everyone on Earth crap their pants!
STAN
Uuuuh...
NEW YORK KID 2
Yeah, we knows all about it!
KYLE
Oh, no!
NEW YORK KID 1
Yeah. Me and the guys, well we was talking, and well, well we just want you to know that we think you're pretty cool.
KYLE
Huh?
STAN
You do?
NEW YORK KID 1
Sure. I mean, everyone on Earth shat themselves 'cause of you. And that's pretty cool. I mean, that's pretty amazing!
NEW YORK KID 2
Yeah, we was wrong about you guys. We're sorry.
CARTMAN
Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay?
NEW YORK KID 1
Yeah. See you guys later. [the three New Yorkers leave]
MR. GARRISON
Come on, boys. You're holdin' up the bus. [the boys get on and Kenny G stops by] Oh, wow, look. It's Kenny G himself. Thank you for a wonderful concert, Mr. G.
KENNY G
Huhuh, good- good-bye. [hugs and kisses him]
MR. GARRISON
M-m-m. [Kenny G releases and walks away] Oh, well, thank you! [steps towards the bus, then stops] You know, it's funny: you kiss just like my dad. [steps into the bus and faces the driver] Well, Ms. Crabtree, this certainly has been a great trip. Let's head home.
MS. CRABTREE
Which way should we go?
MR. GARRISON
Second star to the right, and straight on 'til morning. [Ms. Crabtree starts the bus and drives as day fades into night. It goes over a rise and blinks out of view.]
End of World Wide Recorder Concert
