synopsis:The you-know-what hits the fan 162 times when the citizens of South Park tune in to hear the word "shit" on a popular TV shows.

script:It Hits the Fan

[Morning, bus stop. Stan and Kenny wait for the bus, and Kyle arrives.]
KYLE
[joining the two other boys] Hey you guys! Look what I have!
STAN
What?
KYLE
Four tickets to The Lion King on stage!
STAN AND KENNY
[pause] ...Oh.
KYLE
Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool.
STAN
Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool.
CARTMAN
[off-screen, but rushes in] You guys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!!
KYLE
What, doughboy?
CARTMAN
I was just- [looks stung, then flashes an angry look at Kyle] I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial.
STAN
So?
CARTMAN
So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, Cop Drama.
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television.
KYLE
What?!
CARTMAN
You'll never guess.
STAN
What?!
CARTMAN
Guess.
KYLE
Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?
CARTMAN
You ready? [focus on Cartman] Tonight, on Cop Drama, on TV, they're gonna say, [looks both ways] "Shit."
[By this time a counter, with the number 1 appears, and it goes up whenever "shit" is said]
KYLE
[gasps] They're gonna say "shit" on television?
STAN
They can't say "shit" on television!
CARTMAN
It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude.
STAN
Holy fucking shit!
KENNY
(Dude! We've gotta watch!)
CARTMAN
Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it.
KYLE
Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.
CARTMAN
Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said "shit" on television!
[Counter goes up a number, reading 5]
KYLE
It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?
STAN
Aw, come, on dude! This is history.
KYLE
It's stupid!
CARTMAN
Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina?
KYLE
No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!
[Day, South Park Center for Seismic Activity, water cooler. Randy Marsh and three others shoot the breeze there]
RANDY
Hey, uh, Sam, did you hear the news?
SAM
Yeah, they're gonna say "shit" on television.
COLLEAGUE 1
[balding man] Hey, we should all get together and watch it at the bar.
COLLEAGUE 2
[with light brown hair] Yeaaahhh!
SAM
Yeah.
RANDY
Yeah.
COLLEAGUE 2
Are you guys gonna let your kids watch?
RANDY
Oh, sure, I mean, you know, Cop Drama is a very artsy, dramatic show.
SAM
And they're gonna say "shit"!
[Day, sidewalk. Butters is tagging TELE's as Kyle walks up to him]
KYLE
Hey, Butters! [Butters turns to see Kyle, and the tag is shown: "Butters"] I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite [points] YOU before anybody else.
BUTTERS
Oh, sorry, I can't. [Kyle is disappointed] They're gonna say "shit" on Cop Drama, and my mom and dad say I have to watch it with them so that I don't take it the wrong way.
KYLE
How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!
MR. GARRISON
[walks by] Hey everybody, it's on in thirty minutes! [people get in their cars and peel out of there, while those on the sidewalks quickly disperse. Only Kyle is left, bewildered]
[Night, the town bar. Many of the town's men, including Randy and his coworkers, are inside watching "Cop Drama." The officers in the show speak in hushed tones.]
COP
[voice-over] Listen, Mitchell, I put my life on the line every day. How dare you accuse me!
MR. GARRISON
Oh, I bet this is it! Here it comes.
MITCHELL
I'm doing my job, Frank! We have to know where that evidence was shipped!
JIMBO
Oh, was that it? Was that it?!
RANDY
[annoyed] Shipped. He said "shipped".
FRANK
I told you, we don't have a record of that. And besides, -
[Cut to Cartman's house, night. Cartman sits on the sofa with Stan, Kyle and Kenny, and he's eating from a box of Cheesy Poofs]
FRANK
- your job is to protect the men who serve this force.
CARTMAN
Goddamn it! When are they gonna say "shit"?!
STAN
Sh!
MITCHELL
Maybe... maybe protect them from you?
[Cut to Chef's house, bedroom. He and Principal Victoria watch the show together in bed.]
FRANK
Maybe you're forgetting who you're talking to!
MITCHELL
And maybe you're forgetting I used to be a cop, too!
[Cut to the Broflovski house, living room. Sheila and Sharon are enjoying some popcorn as they view the show. Sheila is in the arnchair]
FRANK
Yeah? You used to be a lot of things.
SHEILA
Oh, he doesn't know that Mitchell slept with his wife, does he?
[Cut to the old folks home.]
MITCHELL
That's it, I've had enough of this.
FRANK
Don't you turn your back on me, you!
[Cut to New York's Times Square, in which a large crowd watches the show from behind a N.Y.P.D. police line]
MITCHELL
I said, enough!
FRANK
Is it?
[Cut back to Cartman's house.]
FRANK
Will it... ever be enough?
ANNOUNCER
Cop Drama will return after these messages.
STAN
Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say "shit?"
CARTMAN
I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene.
STAN AND KYLE
Uh! [Kyle drops from the sofa and heads away]
STAN
Where are you going, Kyle?
KYLE
[stops and looks back] I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!
STAN
But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say "shit" and you're gonna miss it!
KYLE
I don't really give a fuck! [turns and walks away]
STAN
Oh.
[The bar, later.]
MITCHELL
Just understand that it's my job. I still think you're a good cop.
FRANK
Well, Mitchell. I guess you're goin'ta do what you're gonna do. Let's just try and stay friends no matter what.
MITCHELL
You're right. Maybe I'll see you around.
FRANK
Goodbye. Oh, and Mitchell? [voice lowers to a whisper] You've got some shit on the side of your mouth right there.
MITCHELL
Oh, yeah, thanks, thanks.
BAR PATRONS
Wow!!!
[Cartman's house...]
THE BOYS
Whoa!!!
[Chef's bedroom...]
CHEF AND PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh!!
[The old folks home...]
OLD FOLKS
Whoa!
[Times Square... the crowd there cheers]
[The bar...]
JIMBO
[awed] They did it!
[Cartman's house...]
STAN
I can't believe they actually said it. [Kyle returns with some food]
CARTMAN
Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome!
KYLE
Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!
CARTMAN
Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch?
KYLE
Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?! [moves from one end of the sofa to the other] Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world? [moves towards the front door] It's still the same old world out there. Look. [opens the door to find frogs raining down on the neighborhood. The other boys soon join him] What the hell?
CARTMAN
Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs.
KYLE
Oh, whatever. [steps back inside]
[Channel 4 News]
ANCHOR TOM
Last night, the daring and bold show, Cop Drama [title screen pops up], broke new ground by saying "Shit!" on television, making "shit" officially okay to say around the country. [poll picture pops up, and is filled in as the announcer continues] A recent poll shows that 24% of Americans think the show has pushed the envelope too far, while a whopping 76% say they don't really give a shit. [A Medical Alert pops up] In other news, a strange virus which causes victims to vomit up their intestines is making life shitty for a small farming community. [a field reporter stands before an ambulance and a barn] Rick Watts has the story.
RICK WATTS
Thanks, Tom. Shit is certainly going down here in the small town- [begins to vomit strenuously, then falls over dead]
TOM
Whoa, shit!
[South Park Elementary, day. The school bell rings]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright, children, in lieu of the common usage, I'm s'posed to clarify the school's position on the word, "shit".
STAN
Wow! We can say "shit" in school now?!
KYLE
This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Yes, but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form.
CARTMAN
[quizzically] Huh?
MS. CHOKSONDIK
You can only use it in the non-literal sense. For instance, [turns and writes on the board] "That's a shitty picture of me." is now fine. Hoever, the literal noun form of [writes] "This is a picture of shit." is still naughty. [crosses out the sentence]
CARTMAN
I don't get it.
STAN
Me neither.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
The adjective form is now also acceptable. For example: [writes] "The weather outside is shitty." However, the literal adjective is not appropriate. For example: [writes] "My bad diarrhea made the inside of the toilet bowl shitty, and I had to clean it with a rag, which then also became shitty." [crosses it out] That's right out!
TIMMY
Sss...sss...[draws it out] shit. [grins]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Very good, Timmy.
BUTTERS
[raises his hand] Uh, Ms. Choksondik, eh, can we say it in the expletive? Like, "Oh, shit," or, "shit on a shingle"?
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Yes, that's now fine.
CARTMAN
Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word!
KYLE
[angrily] It's not new!! I'm gonna look "shit" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!
CARTMAN
Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina.
KYLE
There's no sand in my vagina!!!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[pointing] Boys, watch your language! Shit!
[Kindergarten, day]
MR. GARRISON
And so, children, instead of saying "Hand in your papers," I may now say, "Hand in your shit." Any questions?
FILMORE
What about, "I have to take a shit"?
MR. GARRISON
No! No, Filmore! You can say "I have to poop and shit," or "Oh, shit, I have to poop," but not "I have to shit." Are we all clear?
KINDERGARTNERS
No.
MR. GARRISON
Look, it's all about context. Well, for example, recently, I have come out and admitted that I was a homosexual. I'm gay. That means that now I can say the word, "fag". On television they usually don't allow "fag". But because I'm gay, it's alright. And with the new approval of the word, "shit," that means that finally I am free to say,

Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,
Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?
Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,
Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?
[pleased] Oh this is great!
[South Park, some days later. The town has taken to using the S word, with Shit-themed stores and products all over the place. People proudly sport the word on their shirts. An elderly couple walks out of Shit 'n Things and stop just outside the door]
ELDERLY WOMAN
Why that store has such lovely shit.
ELDERLY MAN
Yeah. [they walk forth] Too bad I don't have shit for cash right now. [camera pans to the right and shows Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh, looks like the weather might turn shitty.
MR. MACKEY
Oh, I don't really give a shit. I've done enough shit outside today and shit.
MAN
Shit, Peter, you look like shit.
PETER
No, shit, I feel like shit. I think I-[begins to vomit strenuously, then falls over dead as people gather to see what's the matter]
WOMAN 1
Holy shit!
WOMAN 2
Did you see that shit? [Officer Barbrady arrives]
BARBRADY
What kind of shit is this?
MAN 1
That is some weird shit. [camera pans up into the sky. Voice-overs from here on]
WOMAN 3
Susan, your shit's ready!
MAN 2
Do you know where this shit goes? [cut to a shot of the U.S. with Colorado highlighted. Smoke pours up from cities everywhere]
MAN 3
Shit if I know.
WOMAN 4
Nice going, shit-for-brains.
[a high mountain is shown]
MAN 4
Old McDonald took a shit, E I E I O
MAN 5
No shit!
[seven knights are shown encased in ice. The smoke reaches them and thaws them out. Music swells. They step forth and walk to the edge of a cliff, looking out over all those towns and cities spewing forth the filthy word. They draw their swords and raise them high, and lightning strikes each of the swords]
[South Park, another day. Mr. Garrisn is walking down the street, singing.]
MR. GARRISON
Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,
Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?
Hey, there,-
MAN 6
[bumps into Garrison] Oh, shit, 'scuse me. [walks away]
MR. GARRISON
Hey, watch it, fag.
MAN 6
[stops and backs up] What did you call me?
MR. GARRISON
I called you a fag. Because I'm gay, and that means I'm free to use the word "fag". So piss off, you fag-shitter! [laughs and walks away]
Heh, so hey there, shity shitty fag fag
Shitty shitty fag fag, ba doop a doop doo [walks past Stan and Cartman. Cartman is sucking on a Popsicle]
STAN
This sucks. Now that "shit"'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore.
CARTMAN
Yeah, they've taken all the fun out of "shit". We're gonna have to start saying other bad words, like cock and fuck and... meecrob. [licks his Popsicle]
STAN
What's meecrob?
CARTMAN
You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than "shit", dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob. [Kyle rushes in with Kenny behind him]
KYLE
You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, "shit"! I think it might have something to do with people dying!
STAN
What?
KYLE
Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said "shit" on television.
CARTMAN
[dismissive] Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob.
KYLE
I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word "shit" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, "The Black Death".
STAN
What's that?
CARTMAN
Kyle, do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to The Lion King with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go.
KYLE
Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on! [They walk past Shit Shack, and one of the knights steps out of the store as they leave. He sniffs a teal shirt with the word "shit" in his right hand.]
[Hollywood, day, the HBC building. The network president talks to his staff in a boardroom. They're all smiling]
HBC PRESIDENT
...Seventy-five share. My God, I never thought it was possible.
DIRECTOR 1
[brown hair and tie] Sir, your "shit" idea has turned the entire network around. We're proud to work for you. [all clap]
DIRECTOR 2
[a blond] Sir, I'd just like to take this opportunity: And, I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say, you are the most creative genius in Hollywood, and... well... I'd let you have me if you wanted.
HBC PRESIDENT
Thanks, Roger, but I've only just started. You see, I've already figured out our new marketing scheme technique for the next run of shows.
DIRECTOR 3
Whoa!
DIRECTOR 4
He's unstoppable!
DIRECTOR 1
What's the new idea?
DIRECTOR 3
I can hardly wait.
DIRECTOR 5
I'm about to piss myself!
HBC PRESIDENT
[dramatic. Music swells] This Saturday... on HBC... we're going to say... [music stops] "shit" ...twice.
DIRECTOR 3
[pauses] Twice!
DIRECTOR 4
Brilliant!
DIRECTOR 6
Think of the repetition!
DIRECTOR 3
It's like saying it once... but double!
HBC PRESIDENT
Well gentlemen, let's get on it!
ALL
Ho! [they raise their arms up in salute]
[South Park Elementary, day. Chef is singing away in the kitchen, serving up lunch for the kids.]
CHEF
Baby you are so fine, and shit!
The shit you do, the shit you say; I'd jump on your shit any day!
[the boys walk in] Oh, hello there, children.
THE BOYS
Hey Chef.
KYLE
Chef, do you know where "shit" comes from?
CHEF
Uh, from your ass, children.
KYLE
[holds his left palm out] No no! The word, "shit".
CHEF
Oh.
CARTMAN
[points to Kyle] Detective Sandy Vagina here [Kyle looks angrily at Cartman] thinks that "shit" might have something to do with everyone getting sick.
KYLE
Ungh, it said in my book that the word, "shit", started exactly the same time as something called, "The Black Death".
CHEF
The Black Death? Are you sure?
STAN
What's the Black Death, Chef?
CHEF
LaToya Jackson, children.
THE BOYS
Oh.
CHEF
But I think back in those days it meant something else: the plague!
[The Library, later. Chef reads from a large book on a large table on the ground floor. To his left sit Stan and Kenny, to his right Kyle and Cartman]
CHEF
It says here the word, "shit" has been around for over 600 years. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon word, "skite".
KYLE
Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it "skite" and started calling it "shit." The same year as the Black Plague.
LIBRARIAN
[walks up with a cart of books] This is the oldest book in the library. [stops and holds up the book] A priceless original of England's history. Just about everything you could want to know about the plague is in this great tome. [blows the dust off the book, and the book disappears in the dust] Oh, shit. Well, this other book has some good information, too. [hands Chef the book and Chef cracks it open. Music starts]
CHEF
The Black Plague. Over half of Europe was killed by it.
STAN
Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here. [points]
CHEF
Look at this, children. [the boys look closer] It says that the people in England believed that the plague was a curse, a dark magic infliction brought on by a mass utterance of a word of curse.
STAN
Word of curse?
KYLE
A... curse word.
CHEF
Of course! I've never even thought about why we use the term "curse word" before.
STAN
Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death.
CARTMAN
You guys, look here. [the others move over to see] In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina.
KYLE
Cartman, this is serious!!!
CARTMAN
So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn't get released, you could become a walking time bomb. [laughs]
LIBRARIAN
[returns] If you don't mind, I'll have to close up now. They're going to say "shit" seven times on HBC and I- [begins to vomit strenuously, then falls over dead]
STAN
Holy shit!
CARTMAN
Oh-Ho, gross!
KYLE
Dude, this plague is spreading like wildfire! [Kenny goes under the weather and coughs. The others look]
STAN
Uh oh.
KENNY
(Uh oh.)
CARTMAN
Kenny's got it. heh heh.
KYLE
We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network, [the lead knight looks into the library from the bushes] "shit" will become an even more acceptable word!
CHEF
Children, we've got to warn those producers in Hollywood that the plague, and "shit", could be linked!
[An airplane, day. Chef and the boys are headed for Hollywood]
CAPTAIN
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. If you look out the right side of the aircraft you can see some interesting shit. [all look right, except Chef and Kenny] And over on the left side, there's some interesting shit, too. [all look left, except Chef and Kenny] Well, we should be arriving in Los Angeles in about two hours. Until then we invite you to sit back, relax, and enjoy our shitty service. [Kenny coughs at Cartman]
CARTMAN
[brushes himself off] Goddamn it, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me!
KYLE
Cartman, stop being an asshole! [camera pans left to the lead knight sitting between two men, reading from THE WORLD NEWS. The knight lowers the paper and looks over at the boys, then sips from his coffee cup]
[HBC headquarters, Hollywood, day, boardroom.]
DIRECTOR 5
The ratings are in, sir. We broke another record last night with the show that said "shit" seven times! [applause]
DIRECTOR 1
Where is the roof on this thing? I mean, I mean, how can we top ourselves now? [the president walks behind him en route to the head of the table, then sits down]
HBC PRESIDENT
Gentlemen, I have it. The end-all greatest marketing ploy of all time. [applause] Tonight, on HBC, we will air all our sitcoms... LIVE. And have everyone say "shit" in place of their written lines. And we'll call it "Must Shit TV".
DIRECTOR 1
Bravo!
DIRECTOR 2
"Night Of A Million Shits!"
HBC PRESIDENT
Now, doing this live will be difficult, so we must- [Chef and the boys burst through the doors]
CHEF
Hold on a minute, Mr. Producer!
HBC PRESIDENT
Who are you?
CHEF
My name is Chef, and these are the children! We've come to warn you about "shit".
HBC PRESIDENT
[wearily] Oh brother, another Christian protest group.
DIRECTOR 1
Who wants to take this one?
DIRECTOR 2
I'll get it. [rises and walks over to the guests, with a box of complimentary gifts] Gentlemen, we appreciate your concern. [starts speaking quickly as he hands out beanie turtles, caps, American flags, and T-shirts. Kenny's eyes are bloodshot now] Here at HBC the general goal is providing the highest and most thought-provoking entertainment. How great it is that we live in a country where an artist can express himself freely. That's not only the American spirit, it's the HBC spirit. Which allows us to make great family programs like Halo The Turtle, and of course, everyone's favorite show, Cop Drama. We can't thank you enough for bringing your concerns to our network, for it is you, the loyal HBC viewer, who makes this great network, and indeed, the great country that it is. [finishes his speech with some confetti, then returns to his chair]
HBC PRESIDENT
Alright, now, as I was saying-
CHEF
Hey! Hold on a minute!
HBC PRESIDENT
Aw, are they still here?
CHEF
Haven't you people noticed all the strange things going on?
KYLE
We think that you might have caused it by helping make "shit" an everyday word. [the executives just stare back at him]
DIRECTOR 4
Hm, right, right.
KYLE
It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny.
HBC PRESIDENT
Do you have any proof of this?
KYLE
...No.
HBC PRESIDENT
Then [rises] get out of here before we have you thrown out!
CARTMAN
But... we can keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right?
[HBC headquarters, Hollywood, day, outside. Chef and the boys exit the building.]
CHEF
[defiant] Damn cracker-ass producers!
STAN
Now what are we gonna do, Chef?
CHEF
I don't know, children. I guess we've got to get the word out to people some other way.
LEAD KNIGHT
[arrives, and brandishes his sword] Aaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh.
STAN
Oh shit!
LEAD KNIGHT
Stand aside! [the boys make way for him, and he rushes into the building]
[HBC headquarters, Hollywood, day, boardroom.]
HBC PRESIDENT
Alright, now, we have to get all our biggest names to say "shit", and then we're gonna- [the knight bursts into the room]
LEAD KNIGHT
Halt your evil plans!
EXECUTIVES
Huh?
LEAD KNIGHT
I possess the Rune Stone of Undoing! Who is in charge here? [all the directors point to the president]
HBC PRESIDENT
Oh... [buries his face in his hands, believing his staff did something special for him] No, you guys didn't hire me a stripper for my birthday- oh, tell me you guys didn't.
LEAD KNIGHT
Show your true form, Geldon, lest you be afraid! Your short time in this world is at an end! [aims the Rune Stone at the president, but nothing happens. The directors just look at him.] Ach. The Rune Stone has no effect! You are not Geldon!
HBC PRESIDENT
I never said I was.
LEAD KNIGHT
[wields his sword and rushes towards the president] You will die anyway, for you have spread the word of curse! [decapitates a director]
HBC PRESIDENT
Security! [two officers come in with guns drawn and fire away at the knight]
LEAD KNIGHT
Ach! [the gunfire forces him out a window, and he falls to the ground five floors below] oh.
[HBC headquarters, Hollywood, day, outside. Chef and the boys approach the fallen knight.]
CHEF
Who are you?
LEAD KNIGHT
Take this. [reaches out, and gives Stan the stone.]
STAN
What are we supposed to do with it?
LEAD KNIGHT
Eeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. [expires]
KYLE
Now what?
CHEF
We've got to find people who would know what the hell this is all about. Children, we're goin' to have to go to the land of castles, knights, and kings!
[Las Vegas, sunset, a view of the Strip, showing many of the attractions that can be found there.]
ANNOUNCER
[as Chef and the boys take a people-mover in] Lords and Ladies, we bid you welcome to the grandest casino in the land, Excalibur! [a shot of the casino inside, with craps table, one-armed bandits, etc.]
BARKER
Take a free spin. Double your odds. [Chef and the boys approach]
CHEF
'Scuse me. Do you work here?
BARKER
How can I help you, noble sir?
KYLE
We need some help identifying an ancient English stone.
BARKER
A what?
STAN
It might hold the key to a curse.
BARKER
Uh... I can help get you some credit or a comp meal, perhaps.
STAN
Dude, we need help from the British!
BARKER
Look kid, This is just a casino. I can't help you. You know, not every British person knows about wizards [begins chuckling] and dragons and curses.
CHEF
We just need help identifying this. [holds up the stone]
BARKER
[suddenly concerned, with hushed tones] The Rune Stone of Gaelic! Where did you get this?
STAN
You know what it is?
BARKER
The Skire once spoke of such a stone! Come, we must see the sorcerer! [leads Chef and the boys off]
[South Park, bar, night. The men are gathered there once again]
ANNOUNCER
Get ready for "Must Shit TV"! Starting now, four straight hours of pure shit! It's all live!
[On the set of the Drew Carey show. Drew and Mimi are onstage, with Drew sitting at his desk]
DREW
Hey! Heh, shit! Heh. [studio audience laughs] Ya ain't shit.
MIMI
Yeah. Dude, ya ain't shit! [more laughs]
HBC PRESIDENT
This is it. My greatest work.
[Excalibur, inside. The barker leads Chef and the boys down a hall and run into a waitress dressed as a damsel]
WAITRESS
Cocktails. Cocktails.
BARKER
These Americans wish to see the Skire!
WAITRESS
Let us make haste to the inner sanctum!
[Excalibur, the hallway to the Inner Sanctum. The barker and waitress lead Chef and the boys through]
BARKER
How could you foolish Americans bring the wrath of scorn by mass-chanting the word of wretchedness?!
CHEF
Uh, yeah. We didn't mean to.
BARKER
Didn't you realize "shit" is a curse word?!
STAN
Well, yeah, but I don't think that we knew "curse word" meant... curse word.
BARKER
Ha! Leave it to Americans to think that "no" means yes, "pissed" means angry, and "curse word" means something other than a word that's cursed!!
[The Inner Sanctum. The group enters and walks towards the sorcerer]
SORCERER
Let me see the stone. [takes it and walks off to his right]
CHEF
But I don't get it. People use curse words all the time.
BARKER
Saying a word of curse once in a while does nothing. It's only when spoken repeatedly and en masse that the curse takes place.
SORCERER
[now seated at a table with a book of runes open] I've seen this before. Stones that were used by the Knights of Standards and Practices.
CHEF
Knights of Standards and Practices?
SORCERER
A legion of men sworn to do whatever necessary to keep the words at bay. But... they were just a myth.
[South Park, bar, night. The men watch the Drew Carey Show]
MIMI
You know what? You're dumb as shit!
DREW
Oh yeah?! Well, I don't really give a shit!
RANDY
Ya know, that word's kind of getting old. It's not really... funny anymore.
MAN 7
Yeah, they're gonna have to come up with a new swear word soon.
MR. GARRISON
Well, they can't use "fag". Because you can't say "fag" unless you're a homosexual.
RANDY
Really? So we can't say [bleeped] fag?
MR. GARRISON
No. See, you got beeped.
MAN 7
You mean you have to be a [bleeped] fag to say [bleeped] fag?
MR. GARRISON
That's right.
JIMBO
Well, that's not fair! I should be able to say "fag". [realizes he wasn't beeped]
RANDY
...Hey, you didn't get beeped.
JIMBO
Uh oh.
MR. GARRISON
Well, well, well! Guess we learned something new about you, Jimbo, you frickin' fag! You wanna make out or something?
DREW
[shown] Oh, man, I am up shit creek.
[On the set of the Drew Carey show. The door to stage C opens and in gallop the knights with swords drawn]
MIMI
Serves you right, shit-for-brains!
DREW
Yeah, how could I be such a dumb sh-
LEAD KNIGHT
Say not the word of curse! [throws his sword at Drew. The sword enters through Drew's mouth and out the left side of his head. The handle forces him off his chair and onto a cubicle wall]
HBC PRESIDENT
What the?
MIMI
[rushing in] Holy shit! [another knight chops Mimi's head off from behind]
[South Park, bar, night. The men watch the Drew Carey Show]
MR. GARRISON
Oh boy, this show is really reaching for plot now!
[Excalibur, the Inner Sanctum. The Sorcerer continues with the mythology of the knights.]
SORCERER
The knights were formed to keep curse words to a minimum. Should a curse word ever be let out, they would return. A rune for each word of curse was made, representing each of the eight words that so offended God...
STAN
Look, there's the F-word.
KYLE
And asshole.
CARTMAN
I knew it! Meecrob! [the word is shown in close-up] Meecrob is a curse word! God must hate it as much as I do!
SORCERER
Look at this: The writing here claims this stone can defeat the evil Geldon [the page he reads from show a dragon], who will rise when the word of curse has been said enough times to give him power. Then all the world will be destroyed.
STAN
All the world destroyed?
CARTMAN
My house, too?
CHEF
Oh no!
SORCERER
What?
CHEF
Tonight is the "Night of a Million Shits" on HBC! It's gonna be said over and over!
SORCERER
Then we haven't much time. We must go!
[On the set of the Drew Carey show. The blond knight approaches the cameraman]
BLOND KNIGHT
Turn off those devices of broadcast!
HBC PRESIDENT
What is going on here?! Stop this shit!
BLOND KNIGHT
We are the Royal Order of Standards and Practices! [a bald knight joins him]
BALD KNIGHT
We command you to stop saying the curse word!
HBC PRESIDENT
Listen, Mr. Shinypants, I am the head of this network, and I will say "shit" all I want! Shit, shit, shit shit shit, shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit, [gasp. A rumble is heard], shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit! [stops. The rumble gets very loud and the ground begins to heave, as if an earthquake is occuring. The ground splits open and the Geldon rises from it. The audience screams as the Geldon breathes real fire out at them.]
Oh, shit!
[South Park, bar, night. The TV screen is show, with the HBC logo.]
ANNOUNCER
And now, back to Must Shit TV, here on HBC.
[On the set of the Drew Carey show. The terror continues - the knights fight the geldon valiantly.]
LEAD KNIGHT
He is too strong! We cannot fight him without the rune stone!
DIRECTOR 1
My, my GOD, sir! What have you unleashed upon the world?!
HBC PRESIDENT
I didn't know. [begins to weep into his hands] I didn't know!!!
[South Park, bar, night. The men watch in increasing disbelief]
RANDY
I, I can't follow this shitty storyline at all.
[On the set of the Drew Carey show. The terror continues, but Chef and the boys arrive]
KYLE
Wait! [the Geldon lets loose another blast of fire]
CARTMAN
[as the Geldon sets more fires] Oh boy, that thing has really got sand in it's vagina! [one knight's horse's tail is on fire.]
LEAD KNIGHT
The rune stone! Point it towards Geldon! [Kyle does as ordered, and a flash of light emanates from the rune stone, stunning the Geldon]
GELDON
Agh. Dude, lame. Lame! [the ground opens up again and the Geldon drops down into the hole] Bummer, dudes. [the ground closes up again]
CARTMAN
What a stupid voice.
KYLE
It's okay. The curse has been lifted. [the audience falls silent. Kyle and Stan are on stage.]
STAN
Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back.
KYLE
You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems.
[Cut to Kyle's home, where he's on TV]
KYLE
We're all saying the S-word too much! [Ike hops in]
IKE
Kyle.
SHEILA
[on the sofa with Gerald] Look, Gerald. Kyle's on television! [she's sewing as he reads the paper]
GERALD
[doesn't look up] Uh huh.
[Cut to the old folks' home]
KYLE
The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. "Curse words" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances.
STAN
And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English.
CARTMAN
[camera cuts to him] So please, everyone, From now on you've got to try and watch your language. [murmurs and a smattering of applause come from the audience.]
[South Park, bar, night. The men think over the boys' message]
THE MEN
[one by one] Yeah.
RANDY
That makes sense.
COLLEAGUE 1
Ain't that right?
MR. GARRISON
Is this still part of the show?
[On the set of the Drew Carey show. The place is calm now.]
HBC PRESIDENT
We're sorry, noble knights of Standards and Practices. [the knights and the executives approach each other] From now on, we will obey your laws.
BLOND KNIGHT
See that you do!
CHEF
I'm very proud of you, children. Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to.
STAN
Yeah! And Kenny didn't die!
KENNY
(Yeah, I didn't- [he kneels over, his intestines pouring out over the sound stage]
STAN
Holy shi- [quickly taps his mouth with his hands and releases] poop.
CARTMAN
Hah, I love you guys.
End of It Hits the Fan


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Big Gay Al returns to South Park as the new scout leader. When he is fired for being gay, the boys rally to his defense with the help of the new "handi-capable" kid, Jimmy.

script:Cripple Fight

[South park, night. Randy is driving the boys, including Timmy on the truck bed, through the town. Stuart is with them, but Kyle is not. The boys are in Scout gear.]
RANDY
Well, you boys must be pretty excited: Your first night of Scouts.
STAN
It's gonna suck. There's gonna be like, new kids there we don't know.
KENNY
(Yeah.)
STUART
Well, now, that's part of the fun.
RANDY
Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years.
STAN
Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad. [all but Cartman laugh]
CARTMAN
That's not funny! Jesus Christ!
STAN
[calling to the back] Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy??
TIMMY
Hyeah Timmay!
CARTMAN
Yeah, he's excited.
[Park County Community Center, night, outside shot, then inside shot. The doors open and the group walks in. A shot of the many kids inside, then back to the doors. Butters walks up.]
BUTTERS
Hey, fellas!
CARTMAN
[flatly] Hey, Butters.
BUTTERS
Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody.
RANDY
Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine.
STUART
You boys just make sure to obey the scout leader now. He's the man in charge.
BIG GAY AL
[suddenly steps in] Hello scouts!
STAN
Hey, it's Big Gay Al!
BIG GAY AL
Hello, Stanley. I was happy to see you and your little friends' names on the list!
TIMMY
Timmay!
RANDY
You're the new scout leader?
BIG GAY AL
[walks around the boys and stops behind the dads, hugging them] I just got transferred in. [lets go of the dads and moves further into the room] I think everyone's here now, so we can get started. [stops] Come on, Scouts. We've got work to do! [moves again]
BOYS
Hooray! [they start moving, too]
STAN
See ya, Dad!
[Community Center gymnasium. Three tables are set for the scouts to sit at. Big Gay Al walks up to his chair at the center table. Stan, Cartman, Kenny, and Timmy find empty spots on the outside of the table to the left. A small banner hangs from the center table: TROOP 69]
BIG GAY AL
Hey, are you parents gonna stand there all night? This meeting is for scouts only, you silly gooses. [Randy and Stuart look on a bit longer, then turn around and walk out. Close-up on the table reveals four older scouts, two on either side of Big Gay Al] Now, before we get started, scouts, I want to introduce you to someone very special here tonight. He's a brave little boy with disabilities who proves just by being here that Scouts are for everyone!
TIMMY
[happily] Timmay!
BIG GAY AL
So let's all give a big round of applause to little... Jimmy! [points to his right. Jimmy walks up using his crutches.]
JIMMY VALMER
Well hello everyone. [applause]
TIMMY
Ji- Jimmay?
[The bar, nearby. There's some argument going on inside]
STUART
Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's a bad person, I just don't think he should be a scout leader!
RANDY
He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone.
STEPHEN
Well how gay is he?
STUART
He's really, really gay.
TOLKIEN'S FATHER
Well then, I don't want my boy there, either. [more argument ensues]
RANDY
So he's a homosexual. So what?
STUART
I have nothing against homosexuals either, Randy, but the big camping trip is next week! Are you sayin' you're fine with this guy campin' overnight, alone, with our boys??
SKEETER
You know, boys emulate authority figures. Even if it doesn't turn them gay, they could end up all talk and all fem' and prancin' around like girls. [more argument]
RANDY
Aw, that's ridiculous.
PRIEST MAXI
[walks in] People, people, please! You're forgetting that homosexuality is a choice! As many of you know, I, myself, went through a... homosexual... phase. But the light of Christ showed me how to change. Just give me two hours with this man, and I can convert him back.
MAN
[voice only] That's what you said about Peterson, and then you ended up having sex with him!
MAN 2
[voice only] That's right.
MAN 3
[voice only] You did.
[Community Center gymnasium. The Scouts are well into their first activities]
BIG GAY AL
And so that's how to make banana-nut muffins. And now, as a very special treat, our very special friend Jimmy is going to do what he loves most: Motivational standup comedy. [Jimmy walks into view] Let's give him a big hand. [applause]
JIMMY
Wow, what a great audience. [applause dies down] Well, just in case you were wondering, I do have a disability. I am totally happy with the way I was born, very much. I travel to different states and talk to kids about being proud of what they are. My mom says that God has a p-plan for everyone. I guess I was plan B. [the other kids laugh] You guys like im- personations? [applause]
TIMMY
[displeased] Timmy.
JIMMY
How about Jimmy Stewart? "Merry Christmas, movie house." And John Travolta. "Oh my God, Mr. Kotter! Mr. Kotter, oh, oh my God, Mr. Kotter!"
STAN
Jimmy's funny, dude.
BUTTERS
Yeah, well, he's the coolest kid with disabilities in the world!
TIMMY
[gets angry and crosses his arms] Hmph! [the doors open and in walk Randy and Stuart]
STUART
Uh, Kenny, it's nine o'clock.
RANDY
Come on, Stanley.
BIG GAY AL
Oops, guess we're out of time, kids. Now remember, tomorrow you all have bake sales in your respective neighborhoods to raise money. We'll meet back here next Tuesday, and see who raised the most. Good luck.
STAN
Hey, I have a great idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club?
CARTMAN
Hey, yeah!
TIMMY
[brushing off the idea] Timmuh Timmy Timmy Timmy. [camera pulls back to show Jimmy walking up]
STAN
Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join our bake sale in South Park tomorrow?
JIMMY
Gee, sure, that'd be great! Thanks, fellas.
RANDY
[the other scouts leave] Come on, Stan.
STAN
Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time.
KENNY
(Yeah, see ya.)
STAN, CARTMAN
Bye, Jimmy.
JIMMY
See ya tomorrow at the bake sale, fellas.
[Randy's truck, night. Randy is taking the boys home.]
STAN
You were right, Dad. Scouts is awesome!
KENNY
(Yeah!)
STAN
We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!
CARTMAN
Yeah, we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale.
STAN
And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome!
TIMMY
[outside, visibly upset] Yahahah!!!
CARTMAN
Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale.
STAN
Cartman, don't say "use him", you big silly goose. [Randy bears down on the brakes, causing Timmy to roll backwards and into the back window]
TIMMY
Ah.
RANDY
[to Stan] What did you say?!
STAN
[a bit softly, eyes fixed on his fater] I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a silly goose.
STUART
Uh huh!
RANDY
You do not say "Big silly goose"! You call him an asshole like a normal kid!
STAN
Dad, I was just tryin' tuh-
RANDY
Stanley, you call your friend an asshole this instant!
STAN
[glances at Cartman] ...Asshole. [looks at Randy again]
RANDY
That's better.
CARTMAN
Don't call me an asshole, you som' bitch.
[South Park, next day, Camera pulls back to show a booth next to a stage. On the booth is a banner: "Mountain Scout Bake Sale," and Timmy, Kenny, Cartman, and Butters are manning the booth. Items for sale: cookies, cakes, and donuts. Butters mans the collection box. People walk by this way and that. On stage, Stan prepares to speak.]
STAN
Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number six nine. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy! [Jimmy walks up on crutches to the mic and begins]
JIMMY
Wow, what a great audience. I just flew into South Park. Boy, are my crutches tired! [male laughter] What a terrific audience. You know, sometimes people ask me, "Are you angry at God for making disabled people?" I say, "No, I think the world is better with puh-President Bush." [laughter]
SHARON
[heartfelt] What a brave little boy.
SHEILA
He's able to use comedy to overcome his handicap! I love him! [Timmy, upset, sighs and crosses his arms]
JIMMY
Well, I sure have met a lot of interesting people here in South Park. [more people gather] H-how about that Eric Cartman kid, huh? "Goddamnit! God-. No, Kitty, that's my pot pie! Goddamnit! Eh, Goddamnit!" [more laughter]
CARTMAN
Hehe, I don't sound like that.
JIMMY
And how about that school counselor? "Uh, dr-, drugs are b-bad." [Mackey happily nudges a man to his right] "Uh. Drugs are bad, okay? Uh, drugs are, drugs are bad, okay? Okay?" [Timmy is stewing in his anger] Wow, what a great audience. "Mr. Hat. Be quiet, Mr. Hat. Mr.-" [Garrison grins] "Hello there, children. Mr. Hat. Hello- Mr. Hat" [more laughter] "I'm making Salisbury steak for lunch." [Chef looks flattered] "Salisbury steak for lunch." Eh. Uh. "Goddamnit, Goddamnit!" [more, stronger laughter and applause] And of course, my very favorite, "Timmy! Huh. Timmy! Uh liv-, I'm living a lie! I'm living a lie, Timmy!" [the laughter and applause get louder, and Timmy gets livid] "Ti- Timmy, I'm living a lie. Heh, heh. Ah Timmy." Heh. Sometimes it's like, "Please, Timmy, learn a new word," heh. "Timmy! Tu-Timmy!" [more laughter]
TIMMY
[angrily] Aaaaaaah! [Stan notices. Quickly, Timmy takes a cake half and throws it right at Jimmy, and it hits. Jimmy leans to his left, and stabilizes himself]
JIMMY
Wow, looks like when it comes to comedy, I really t-take the c-keh-c. I really take the cay. I really take the k-keh cake. [cheers and claps abound]
MAN
Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my
TIMMY
[wailing] Tiiimm-mmah!!!!!
[State Mountain Scouts of America headquarters, day, outside shot. Inside, three men sit behind a table - a tribunal.]
HEAD SCOUTMASTER
Well, this is it. We've simply gotten too many complaints from concerned parents about him. I'm afraid we don't have a choice.
BIG GAY AL
[enters the room] Hi ya fellas! [waves his left arm quickly]
HEAD SCOUTMASTER
How are you today, Scout?
BIG GAY AL
I'm super, thanks for asking. The troops are off having bake sales, and I'm pleased to report that we have already raised over $600 for the event. Yippie!
HEAD SCOUTMASTER
Uh, Big Gay Al, it's recently come to our attention that you are... gay.
BIG GAY AL
Well, stop the presses. Did you figure that out all by yourselves, silly buns?
SCOUTMASTER 1
Yes, well, unfortunately for you, the Scouts have a policy that openly gay men cannot belong.
HEAD SCOUTMASTER
We are left with no options, Mr. Al. I'm afraid you are hereby... out of Scouts.
BIG GAY AL
[Softly. Somber music plays.] Out of... Scouts?
HEAD SCOUTMASTER
We're sorry, Mr. Gay Al.
BIG GAY AL
But I've been in Scouts since I was nine - it's a... huge part of my life.
SCOUTMASTER 2
Uh, you must understand that Scouts is a private club. A club that follows certain beliefs, and one of those beliefs is that homosexuality is immoral.
BIG GAY AL
I see...
HEAD SCOUTMASTER
It's nothing against you personally
BIG GAY AL
What if I promise not to be gay anymore? [holds up a pinky] Pinky swear.
SCOUTMASTER 2
We think it's best you just... move on.
BIG GAY AL
[rejected] Right. Move on. [turns around, sighs, and walks out]
[South Park streets, day. Timmy sits on the sidewalk as Jimmy ambles towards him.]
JIMMY
Oh, hey Timmy. I'm glad you called, very much. I've been detecting some a-animosity towards me lately, and I was hoping we could bury the hatchet.
TIMMY
[holding a gift] Timmih.
JIMMY
What's that?
TIMMY
Hur livin' a lah, Timmih. [presents the gift]
JIMMY
A present? You got me a p-present?
TIMMY
Timmih!
JIMMY
...[takes the gift] Gee, you didn't have to do that. I mean, I understand why you've been jealous of my talent. [opens the present] If you work at it, maybe you could be as... handi-capable as I am, huh? [pulls out the contents] Wow, a parka. [an orange one] You-you didn't have to do that, Tim-Tim.
TIMMY
[all smiles] Tim-Timmy.
JIMMY
Oh, sure. I'll see if it fits. [Timmy grins with anticipation as Jimmy dons the parka. Next shot is of Jimmy looking suspiciously like Kenny] This is very warm. Thanks a lot, Tim-Tim. Well, I'll see you around. [turns around to walk away]
TIMMY
Timmih! [grins]
[As Jimmy walks, suspense music comes up. Jimmy reaches the corner, and a safe falls from above and cracks the sidewalk behind him. He crosses the street, and a truck plows into an oncoming car and jackknifes, sending the car backwards through the air. Jimmy is untouched. An eagle tries to swoop him up, but misses. Jimbo and Ned appear atop a building across the street]
JIMBO
There he is! Kill him! Kill him! [Ned fires three times] Oh, wait, that's not him. [the two men withdraw, and Jimmy keeps walking]
[Some glass blows out from a window next to Jimmy, followed by a blast of fire, and Jimmy walks. He crosses the second street and a herd of cattle stampede past him. He continues down the road, and a space shuttle crashes into the sidewalk, nose first.]
JIMMY
[calling back] Thanks again, Tim-Tim.
TIMMY
[thwarted] Tim-Timmay!
[Big Gay Al's house, night. Quite colorful front lawn, with fountain, flowers, a flower strip down the middle of the driveway. Soft music plays. Inside, Al sits on his bed looking over framed photos of his Scouting career. Scout Troop 417 - 1988, Camp White Swallow - 1974, his Scout medals, a picture of a black man dressed as Superman. Al sighs and looks over at his Scout uniform. He walks over and takes it down, then walk to his dresser and puts the uniform away in one of its drawers]
BIG GAY AL
Ah, bye, Scouts. [closes the drawer. The camera pans to show a man playing a piano] Okay, okay, Marc, stop playing now.
MARC
Hey, don't yell at me! Ya asked me to come over and play sad songs for you to pack to, and then ya yell at me.
BIG GAY AL
[approaching] I'm sorry. Sorry. But now I've packed everything away, so just... well, play something uplifting, like... "I'm gonna put all this behind me and make it okay" music.
MARC
[starts playing sprightly music] Ooooh, I don't want her. You can have her. She's too fat for me.
BIG GAY AL
Oh! [buries his face in his left hand] Jesus, Marc.
[Park County Community Center, night. A group of men stand outside. The head Scoutmaster exits the building with a big, beefy, decorated Scout leader]
HEAD SCOUTMASTER
Parents, this is the new Scout leader, Mr. Grazier. He will be taking over for the homosexual.
RANDY
Nice to meet you.
MR. GRAZIER
Marsh, right? We actually kind of know each other. Your wife and mine are friends.
STUART
Your wife, huh?
HEAD SCOUTMASTER
Carol is the head of a girls' Mountain Scouts troop.
RANDY
[nudges Stuart, who then smiles] Well, I guess we're off to the bar until nine, then.
MR. GRAZIER
Gonna go pound some brews, huh?
[Inside, Jimmy entertains the troops with more of his comedy skit as the men talk outside]
JIMMY
And so I said to him, "Hey, I- I may be handicapped, bu-but I'm not... deaf." [the other scouts laugh] Wow, what a terrific audience. Well, for my next joke I'm gonna need a vo-volunteer from the audience, very much. How about you, Timmy?
TIMMY
[resisting] Timmay.
JIMMY
Sure, come on up here, Tim-Tim. [the boys laugh, and Jimmy approaches] Timmy, ladies and gentlemen. Let's give him a hand, very much. Come to think of it, give him a pair of legs, too. [laughter. Timmy gets angry when Jimmy offers him a Dr. Seuss-like hat.] Here, Timmy, put on this silly hat. [Timmy throws the hat down. Jimmy picks it back up and offers it again.] Just for a second, Timmy. [Timmy throws the hat back at him, and he picks it up again] Don't be a jerk, Timmy. [approaches with the hat, but Timmy smacks him away] Hey, don't push me!
TIMMY
Timmih! [turns his chair to face Jimmy directly]
CARTMAN
Cripple fight! [the other boys cheer, but Mr. Grazier bursts through the doors]
MR. GRAZIER
That is enough, Scouts! Take your seats! [the boys turn left and go to their seats]
CARTMAN
Awww!
MR. GRAZIER
Alright, Scouts, I am your new Scout Master, Mr. Grazier! [paces back and forth between tables] Together we are going to become the best! The sleekest! The most polished Scout troop in all of Colorado! Isn't that right! [there's no answer] When I ask you a question you will answer "Yes, Scoutmaster!" Do I make myself clear?!
SCOUTS
Yes, Scoutmaster!
MR. GRAZIER
Good! Now, the first activity for this evening will be... [hushed] naked pictures [brings forth a camera] I'm going to take some pictures of each of you naked, in case we need them, for later.
SCOUTS
Awww.
MR. GRAZIER
Aw, what is this?! If there's one thing I hate, it's a whining platoon! "We don't wanna do pushups! We don't wanna get up early! We don't wanna have you take naked pictures of us!"
CARTMAN
[to Kenny] Man, this guy sucks.
MR. GRAZIER
Now, fall in and strip down, Scouts!
[Community Center gym, later. The pictures have been taken and the Scouts are dressed and at table.]
MR. GRAZIER
Alright, Scouts, we're gonna end this meeting with a little puppet show. [pulls out a smiling Scout hand puppet] Here's a little Scout. He's always prepared. He's always ready. Now, here's a little Scout telling his parents that Mr. Grazier took naked pictures of him. Look what happens. [pulls out a hammer with his left hand and whacks away at the puppet on his right hand. The Scouts are frightened] Oh! No! Aw! Aw! Aw! [his right hand is bleeding, leaving a small pool of blood under the puppet] Do I make myself clear, Scouts?!
SCOUTS
Yes, Scoutmaster! [the parents enter to pick up their boys]
MR. GRAZIER
[now hiding his right hand] Oh, hello parents. Alright, that's all the time we have for tonight, Scouts. We sure had a great time, didn't we?
SCOUTS
Yes sir Scoutmaster! [the troops break and go to their parents. Mr. Grazier walks over to Randy and Stuart, with his right hand behnd his back]
RANDY
Wow, you sure whipped those kids into shape.
STUART
Yeah. Now they're acting like men.
MR. GRAZIER
Well, you know what I say about kids: They're all pink on the inside.
RANDY
You bet.
STUART
I heard that.
RANDY
See ya, Mr. Grazier. [Randy and Stuart walk out. Mr. Grazier waits till they're gone and then pulls out the pictures he'd just taken and reviews them]
[Big Gay Al's house, night, living room. Al is on the couch unkempt, covered in a blanket, watching TV, and devouring ice cream. The door bell rings]
BIG GAY AL
Go away! I'm dead! [the door closes, and soon the South Park troop comes into view and stands in front of him]
BUTTERS
Oh, well, here he is.
STAN
Big Gay Al, what are you doing?!
CARTMAN
Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch and come be our scoutmaster again!
BIG GAY AL
I can't, kids. I've been... kicked out of Scouts.
STAN
Kicked out? Oh no!
CARTMAN
But you have to come back. We hate our new scout leader.
BIG GAY AL
Really? wull-why?
BUTTERS
[pause. Stan and Cartman look to him] We can't tell you.
BIG GAY AL
Why not?
BUTTERS
[approaches the kidney-shaped table and demonstrates] Oh, no. No. Oh, no. No! Oh no no! [Al is shocked at the implication]
STAN
Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week.
BIG GAY AL
Boys, there's nothing I can do. The Scouts don't allow homosexuals.
JIMMY
Well then that settles it! Fellas, what we're gonna hafta do is try to ch... change the Scouts' rules, very much.
[South Park streets, day. The six boys are picketing on the sidewalk. Cartman carries a picket: "Scouting is for everyone!" Butters and Kenny carry a fold-up table between them]
STAN
What do we want?
BOYS
Gays in Scouts!
STAN
When do we want it?
TIMMY
Timmih!
STAN
What do we want?
BOYS
Gays in Scouts!
STAN
When do we want it?
TIMMY
Timmih!
STAN
What do we want?
RANDY
[slowly, as the boys and Stan continue] Oh, no.
BOYS
Gays in Scouts!
STAN
When do we want it?
TIMMY
Timmih!
[South Park streets, day, further down the street. The six boys continue picketing.]
STAN
What do we want?
BOYS
Gays in Scouts!
STAN
When do we want it?
TIMMY
Timmih! [the boys approach Henry's Supermarket]
STAN
Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures. [a little girl stands at the market's entrance]
LITTLE GIRL
Puppies. Puppies for sale.
CARTMAN
[moves over to her] Beat it, toots! We've got discrimination work to do! [takes her box and looks inside, then tosses it away. She goes after the box]
STAN
Alright, let's set up. [the table's legs come down and Cartman's picket is hung in front of the table. A mic and sound system are set up next to the table. A customer exits the market, and Stan whips out a petition board] Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays? [the customer gets away, but another one comes] Uh, hello, gays in Scouts? [the customers ignore him] Goddamnit! [All the while Timmy looks down angrily at Jimmy]
BUTTERS
Hey! Why don't we have Jimmy do some stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale, very much?
STAN
That's a great idea! [takes the mic] Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment, stand-up comic, Jimmy!
JIMMY
[takes the mic] Wow, what a great audience. For my first joke, I'm going to need a... volunteer. Come on up here, Tim-Tim. [Jimmy gets the big hat and turns to give it to Timmy, only to see him wheel away. Jimmy follows, and they end up in a parking lot away from the market] Timmy, when I tell you to do something, you do it!
TIMMY
Timmih!
JIMMY
Timmy, don't make me k... kick you ass!
TIMMY
Timmay!
JIMMY
Put on the hat!
TIMMY
[smacks the hat down] Timmay!
JIMMY
Pu-put it on!!
STAN
Dude, this looks like it could get ugly. [he and Cartman leave the table and go towards Jimmy and Timmy. Timmy and Jimmy face off and start circling each other]
TIMMY
[makes a fist] Timmih. Timmih.
JIMMY
Not this year.
TIMMY
Timmih, Timmih.
CARTMAN
Cripple fight!
TIMMY
Haaa.
JIMMY
Come on. Come on!
TIMMY
Timmih.
[South Park Church. A service is on, and organ music plays]
CARTMAN
Cripple fight! [after a moment, the congregants get up and leave]
[Henry's Supermarket, inside. Shoppers mill about, getting their items]
CARTMAN
[on speakers] Attention, shoppers. Outside, we have... cripple fight. Cripple fight outside! [the shoppers abandon their carts and exit]
[Parking lot. Timmy delivers the fist blow, to Jimmy's head, but Jimmy delivers four blows back with his crutches. The third one turns Timmy's head to the left. The fourth one turns Timmy's head to the right and forces the wheelchair backwards. Jimmy recovers and the rivals approach each other anew]
JIMMY
Come on!
[Jimmy jumps up and delivers a blow to Timmy's face, but Timmy responds with four quick blows - a right hook, two left jabs, and another right hook - sending Jimmy to the ground face first.]
JIMMY
[struggling to get up] Uh.
STAN
Jesus Christ, dude! [a crowd begins to gather]
SUSAN
Oh my God!
MAN 5
Just let 'em have it out, Susan. They'll run out of steam soon. [Jimmy gets up quickly and faces Timmy again]
TIMMY
Hahnah Timmih.
JIMMY
[swipes at him, but Timmy blocks] Huah!
TIMMY
Hahnah Timmih.
JIMMY
[swipes at Timmy again, but Timmy blocks] Come on!
TIMMY
Timmih!
JIMMY
No! [swipes at him again, but Timmy blocks and quickly delivers a blow to the face, drawing fist blood] Ow!
[Jimmy recoups and delivers a back-handed blow to Timmy with his right crutch, then measures Timmy and swings the crutch back and launches Timmy out of his chair. Timmy quickly scrambles back to his chair, but Jimmy whacks him away again. Camera movements get more dynamic. Timmy rolls over and Jimmy walks up to him and offers his left hand]
JIMMY
Timmy? Timmy? [Timmy takes his hand and slowly rises to his feet. Jimmy helps him into the chair]
I told you to put on the HAT!! [swings his right crutch and blows Timmy out of the chair again. Jimmy walks up to Timmy and pulls him up by the hair, and swings the right crutch at him, but Timmy blocks it and holds both crutches down]
You dirty motherfucker! [hits Timmy with the crutches, and Timmy responds with a headbutt, knocking Jimmy down. Timmy goes down himself]
MAN 5
[just arriving] What's goin' on?
MAN 6
[turns to answer] Some kind of gay pride rally.
[Timmy gets a hold of Jimmy and delivers a right cross. Jimmy responds by striking Timmy with both crutches, then grounding his crutches and swinging his legs up to strike Timmy agian. Next, Jimmy tries to pull Timmy off the wheelchair head first, then tries to get a reverse headlock on Timmy. Timmy breaks out of it and delivers a blow. They each try a headlock on the other, but the effort forces the wheelchair backwards, and they both fall out.]
TIMMY
Lah-livin' a lie!
[Jimmy chokes Timmy for a bit, then rises to jump on him. Timmy tries to force Jimmy off by pushing Jimmy's face back, but Jimmy bites Timmy's fingers. Timmy cries in pain, then flips Jimmy off overhead. Jimmy scrambles up on his crutches as Timmy tends to his bitten hand, and strikes Timmy again, and again. Jimmy then swings his legs into Timmy and flies off - a flying kick. Timmy rises and jumps on Jimmy, grabbing his head and ramming it into the ground twice, then performing an eye gouge. Jimmy works around it and throws Timmy off, then jumps on him, driving a knee into Timmy's crotch five times, shot from various angles. Jimmy struggles to get up, and Timmy trips him.]
[Channel 4 News report]
REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing out in front of Henry's Supermarket where five brave little boys are holding a rally to support gays in scouting. The rally is drawing so much attention that people from all over the country are taking media notice.
FARMER
Those boys have shown me the light. I never knew the Mountain Scouts was a hate group.
JOE
[host of Joe n' Friends] This is a wake up call to America. We cannot turn our backs on gays anymore!
[South Park Bar. People are looking at the report]
RANDY
Oh, God, they're actually pulling it off.
REPORTER
[voice only] The rally has also caught the attention of old Scouts members, like Steven Spielberg, director of such films as Always and 1941.
[Cut to Channel 4 News report]
STEVEN SPIELBERG
[at his desk] I salute those boys and their courage. I am hereby cutting all my funding to the Scouts!
REPORTER
The rally has also caught the attention of high-powered lawyer, Gloria Allred.
GLORIA ALLRED
[at her desk] It is a disgrace that these homophobes are allowed to discriminate. [rises from her chair and pounds the desk] I am taking this case on, personally!
REPORTER
With this kind of support, Tom, these boys are sure to have a victory for gays. Back to you.
TOM
Thanks, Chris. In other news, the FBI has finally caught the child molester known as Mr. Slippyfist. [pictured is Mr. Grazier being arrested, then his mug shot] This sick child molester was found with disturbing graphic photos of young boys naked, which we will show you now.
[Cut to South Park Bar for reactions. The men are stunned]
TOM
[voice only] Here's one. And here's another.
STUART
Kenny?
RANDY
Oh my God.
TOM
Here, look at this one. Sick sonofabitch! Here's one right here.
[Jimmy and Timmy have taken to throwing each other all over the place. Jimmy and Timmy land on a car and tumble down to the ground beside it. The camera follows the action closely. Jimmy picks Timmy up and throws him back on the car, then swings his right crutch at Timmy, striking him, and strikes him again on the return swing. Timmy punches Jimmy with his left fist, sending Jimmy spinning around. Jimmy swings at Timmy again, but Timmy ducks and catches Jimmy in a sleeper hold, holding on for a few seconds. Jimmy escapes, then picks Timmy up high and brings him down upon the left knee for a back-breaker. Timmy rises and responds with a neck-breaker, knocking Jimmy out. Both boys lay there, motionless.]
MAN 6
Alright, boys, break it up.
[Colorado Supreme Court, day, exterior shot. Inside, the justices enter and take their seats]
BAILIFF
All rise.
CHIEF JUSTICE
In the case of Big Gay Al versus Mountain Scouts of America: due to the overwhelming show of support, it is the ruling of this court that the Scouts must allow Big Gay Al and all gays into their club!
CROWD
Alright! Yeah! Woohoo! [more cheering]
RANDY
Well, we've all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too.
CROWD
Yeah! [more cheering. Timmy and Jimmy, bruised and battered, sit next to each other]
CHIEF JUSTICE
And furthermore, the Scout elders will be put into stocks for three days, so they can see how it feels to be outcast!
CROWD
Hooray, yeah, yeah! [more cheering]
STAN
We did it! We did it!
GLORIA ALLRED
I did it! I did it! Haha! [the press gathers in around her.]
[Colorado Supreme Court, day, outside. Gloria Allred is holding a press conference at the top of the steps at the courthouse]
GLORIA ALLRED
Today is a great day for democracy. The Scouts have been exposed for the vile gay bashers they are. [each of the three Scout elders is in a stock, and underneath each one is written "HOMOPHOBE" The crowd throws stones at them.] And we all it all to me, and these six brave little boys [the big bird comes down and plucks Kenny right up. The other kids, Al, and Gloria move aside and return, the kids stunned] five... brave little boys. And now, here to take his official oath back in Scouts is Big Gay Al. [moves aside]
BIG GAY AL
[as the crowd cheers] Thank you all very much. But I don't want this. [the crowd quiets down and gets confused]
CROWD MEMBERS
What's he saying?
STAN
Huh?
BIG GAY AL
Look, I appreciate what you kids did; I really do. But this isn't what I wanted. I'm proud to be gay. And I'm proud to be in a country where I'm free to express myself. But freedom is a two-way street. If I'm free to express myself, then the Scouts have to be free to express themselves, too. I know these men. They are good men. They are kind men. They do what they think is best for kids. No matter how wrong we think they might be, it isn't right for us to force them to think our way. It's up to us to persuade, and help them see the light, not extort them to. Please, don't cut the Scouts' funding. The Scouts help and have always helped a lot of kids. That's why I love them. I will continue to persuade them to change their mind, but this is the wrong way to do it. So, I am hereby dropping my case, and allowing the Scouts their right to not allow gays into their private club.
MAN
Uh, Hooray!
ANOTHER MAN
Hooray, hey!
STAN
So wait, did we do good?
BUTTERS
Uh yeah, ah I think so.
CARTMAN
Eh, we kick ass.
BIG GAY AL
[approaching the boys] Come on kids, let's go get some ice cream! [moves along]
GLORIA ALLRED
[at the mic] You can't do this! You homophobe!
JIMMY
Well, Timmy, I guess we learned an important lesson, too, very much. There is room for more than one handi-capable person in Scouts.
TIMMY
Timmih.
JIMMY
I'm glad we're best friends now. See ya at Scouts. [walks off]
TIMMY
Tim-mih.
[Timmy's house, exterior shot. Inside, Timmy is working on his computer in his room. He's working the keyboard and the mouse like an experienced user. He sings to the tune of "Old MacDonald Had a Farm":]
TIMMY
Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih...
[on screen is a picture of Timmy and Jimmy, in a Photo Wiz program. Timmy traces a cutout around Jimmy's head]
Timmih Timmih Timmih.
Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih...
[he clips the head off and moves it to the right, and grins]
Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih.
Ahh!
STAN
[opens Timmy's bedroom door and enters. Timmy stops work to listen] Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts! [walks out]
[Park County Community Center, day. Inside the boys are seated around the table, and a new Scoutmaster, the head Scoutmaster, is present]
HEAD SCOUTMASTER
Alright, boys, I am your new Scout leader. Everything is going to be just fine. No naked pictures.
TIMMY
[rolls up to the scoutmaster] Uh, Timmih.
HEAD SCOUTMASTER
Yes, Timmy? [Timmy hands him an envelope, which he opens. He takes out a picture] Oh dear. Jimmy?
JIMMY
Yes?
HEAD SCOUTMASTER
You know our policy: I'm afraid you're... out of Scouts.
JIMMY
Out of Scouts? [the scoutmaster shows a picture of two naked men holding each other close from the waist down and looking at the camera. The paler man has Jimmy's head pasted over his]
TIMMY
[with eyes half-closed, waves at Jimmy and grins] Tim-mih.
JIMMY
What? [the two other Scoutmasters come up behind Jimmy, pull him out of his chair, and carry him towards the entrance] Hey wait a minute! This is crazy! You can't do this!
STAN
Wow, I never knew Jimmy was gay.
BUTTERS
Me neither. [the two Scoutmasters prepare to toss him out the doors]
JIMMY
No! No! [the Scoutmasters toss him a good distance]
TIMMY
[triumphantly] Timmay!
End of Cripple Fight


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Teaming up with Jesus, Stan calls upon all the Super Best Friends to destroy the evil cult leader and magician David Blaine and thwart the mass suicide pact he has planned.

script:Super Best Friends

[South Park, day. People mill around, but a group of them has gathered around a magician, tall and slender, with a severe face]
MAGICIAN
Okay, Carol, put the card you picked back into the deck so I can't see ittwah. [Butters and Kenny are watching as Stan and Kyle rush up]
STAN
What's going on? [he and Kyle have ice cream cones. He has vanilla, Kyle strawberry]
BUTTERS
Uh this feller David Blaine. He's doin' magic tricks. Hey, where'd you get that ice cream?
BLAINE
Okay, now hold this card up to the crowd. [Carol takes the card and shows it to the crowd. It is an ace of clubs] Was that the card you picked?
CAROL
No, I'm sorry. I picked the four of hearts.
BLAINE
Four of hearts? Really? Look again.
CAROL
[looks and find the four of hearts in her hand] Daa-ah!
CROWD
Oooohhhh! [applause]
WOMAN
Whoa
KYLE
That's pretty cool, dude!
CARTMAN
[walking up] Who's this asshole?
KYLE
He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass.
CARTMAN
Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?
BLAINE
Sir, c- could you come over here? [Jimbo walks over] Now, what I want you to do, Mr...
JIMBO
Kern.
BLAINE
Mr. Kern, I want you to just... think about a card. Pick any card, and picture it in your mind.
JIMBO
[shuts his eyes and keeps them shut] O-kay.
BLAINE
Okay, jus... s think about your card. [a few seconds pass] okay, look at me. [Jimbo looks at him] Look at me... Look at me... okay, now reach up your ass.
JIMBO
Huh??
BLAINE
Go on, reach up your ass.
JIMBO
[reaches into his ass and digs around] Uh, I don't feel nothin'.
BLAINE
Deeper.
JIMBO
[groans as he goes deeper] Hhud. I don't feel... hello... wait... wait... [pulls out a card and cleans the crap off it]
BLAINE
Was that the card you picked?
JIMBO
[in disbelief] Yes! Oh my God!
MAN
O-hoho! [more crowd reaction]
KYLE
Wow, that's cool!
STAN
How'd he do that??
BLAINE
Thank you. I've been traveling from town to town for quite a while. I've started quite a following, mostly because of my levitation tricktwah. Watch. [goes into a meditative state] Watch. [slowly, he rises into the air]
CROWD
Whoa!!!
STAN
No way!
KYLE
Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe!
BLAINTOLOGIST
[passing out pamphlets through the crowd] Pamphlet. Pamphlet. Here you go, kids, take a pamphlet. [Kyle takes one and reads from it]
KYLE
"David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic." Dude, we gotta go.
CARTMAN
Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks!
[The David Blaine Complex, in the middle of nowhere, day.]
SPEAKER
Hello, everyone. My name is Steven and I've been a Blaintologist for about three years. So, when David Blaine performed his miracles out on the street, what moved you the most?
STAN
His a-miracles?
STEVEN
Oh yes, you see, David Blaine is much more than a magician. He's a scholar, a visionary, a leader.
CARTMAN
When are we gonna learn magic tricks?
STAN
Yeah!
STEVEN
Oh, I've got a trick for you to learn: I can show you how to make your true self appear. Let me ask you all something: Do you consider yourselves to be happy?
BUTTERS
I don't think I'm very happy. I always fall asleep to the sounds of my own screams.
STEVEN
...Right, yeh. Eh, see, the reason that you are unha-
BUTTERS
And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?
STEVEN
Wait, the.. the point is... that you can be happy. You see, your friends and parents have programmed you in a way that makes you feel isolated and alone. How many times have you felt like nobody knows the real... you? [focus on a stunned Kyle] You're not really happy.
KYLE
[thinking] I'm not really happy.
STEVEN
Your potential hasn't even been reached.
KYLE
[thinking] My potential hasn't even been reached.
STEVEN
[holds up the book] If you look through David Blaine's incredible book, you'll find a lot of life's answers. Let's read some of the book together, shall we?
CARTMAN
Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club?
STEVEN
That's right.
CARTMAN
Cool.
[Kyle's house, day. In the dining room, Sheila is trying to feed Ike, who is in a baby chair.]
SHEILA
Ike, eat your gefilte fish. [Ike pulls away as far as he can]
IKE
No-oo.
KYLE
[rushes in with Blaine's book] Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine.
SHEILA
That's nice, Kyle. Ike, eat!
KYLE
We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four....
SHEILA
Well, it's nice to see you so interested in something, Kyle. Ike, for the love of Abraham, you are gonna eat this.
KYLE
So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95.
SHEILA
Magic Camp? I don't know, bubbe, ask your father. [Kyle turns and walks out] Ike, you will eat this!
[The David Blaine Complex, in the middle of nowhere, day. The new recruits are having their hair shaved off their heads]
BARBER
Prepare to be cleansed and release the magic inside you.
BUTTERS
[Solemnly] I am prepared. [the barber takes the clippers and clips Butters' hair off in one swoop. The hair ends up on the floor in one piece] Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here.
BARBER
Next? [Mr. Garrison appears...]
[The David Blaine Complex, main room]
STEVEN
Congratulations, young Blaintologists. From this day, you are clean. [a shot of the new recruits. They all look the same] Now, we have very important work to do! David Blaine is going to put on a big magic show in Denver tomorrow night, where he's going to eat his own head.
RECRUITS
Wow!
STEVEN
So it's up to all you new Blaintologists to get as many people there as you can. Whoever gets the most people to come gets a prize! [eight boys gravitate towards each other]
STAN
[talking to a boy between him and Cartman] Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea.
BUTTERS
Ha-I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters. I thought you were Kyle.
STAN
No, I'm Stan.
KYLE
[behind Butters] You're Stan? Where's Kenny?
STAN
Who are you?
KYLE
I'm Kyle.
CARTMAN
[thinking he's indistinguishable] Heheh, guess who I am, you guys?
STAN
Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here.
KYLE
[steps back to join Stan] What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff.
STAN
Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home.
KYLE
But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow.
STAN
I don't care! I'm leaving! [walks towards the door, but a man blocks the way] 'Scuse me. [eerie music begins]
AIDE
Where are you going?
STAN
I'm going home.
AIDE
You don't want to go home.
STAN
You said we're free to leave whenever we want
AIDE
You are.
STAN
Move out of the way.
AIDE
I'm not in the way. You are. Are you unhappy with the Church's teachings? Let's just talk about it
STAN
I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave.
AIDE
Why don't we go into the back room for a second, and talk? Then you can leave.
STAN
[begins to back away, intimidated] That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay.
AIDE
That's great news. [escorts Stan back to the group]
[The David Blaine Complex, dorm, night. Stan peers out from a door into a hall.]
STAN
Okay, it's all clear. [exits with Kyle]
KYLE
What are we doing?
STAN
We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand.
KYLE
Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere.
STAN
Come on, Kyle, this is stupid!
KYLE
It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something.
STAN
A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!
KYLE
Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.
STAN
No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go!
KYLE
I'm not going anywhere!
STAN
Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!
KYLE
Huh? I thought you wanted to leave.
STAN
Oh wait, who am I again?
KYLE
You're Stan.
STAN
Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second. [pulls out his hat and puts it on] Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me!
KYLE
Then I guess... I'm a dumbass. [turns and walks back to his room. Stan turns back to face the hall and watched Kyle walk away]
STAN
Kyle, please. You- [looks down and to the left, then looks up] You're my best friend.
KYLE
Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore. [opens the door to his room and walks in. Stan looks, then turns towards the exit and walks out]
[South Park, next day. Cartman and Kyle walk down a sidewalk visiting houses. They approach a pink house.]
KYLE
Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you.
ELDERLY WOMAN
Uh oh. My husband warned me about you Blainiacs. I'm sorry, but I'm a Catholic.
CARTMAN
Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew.
KYLE
That's right.
ELDERLY WOMAN
So you're not a cult?
CARTMAN
[giggles] Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we'd like to share it with you.
ELDERLY WOMAN
Well, alright, come on in.
CARTMAN
Cool. [the woman shows the boys in]
[Elderly woman's house, living room, moments later. The woman and the two boys sit on the sofa. Kyle has his book open.]
KYLE
...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square.
CARTMAN
Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you?
ELDERLY WOMAN
No, not really.
CARTMAN
Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often.
KYLE
David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night. [closes his book] We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!
CARTMAN
He's going to eat his own head.
KYLE
How many tickets can we put you down for?
ELDERLY WOMAN
Oh, I can't go.
CARTMAN
Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person.
ELDERLY WOMAN
I am happy.
CARTMAN
No you're not.
ELDERLY WOMAN
Yes I am.
CARTMAN
No you're not.
ELDERLY WOMAN
I really am.
CARTMAN
No you're not.
ELDERLY WOMAN
But I am.
CARTMAN
No you're not.
ELDERLY WOMAN
Alright, two tickets
KYLE
Great!
[Sidewalk. Kyle and Cartman exit the elderly woman's house]
KYLE
That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.
CARTMAN
Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize.
KYLE
I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- [they reach the corner. Facing them on the opposite corner is Stan, standing by his bike]
CARTMAN
Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him. [turns right and walks down the street. Kyle looks back at Stan for a few seconds, then follows Cartman. Stan turns and walks down the street in the same direction Kyle and Cartman were walking, but stops when a car appears in front of him. He sees some adult Blaintologists inside. The driver starts the car and moves towards Stan, who turns about face and begins to run with his bike. The car looms behind him and he lets go of his bike.]
STAN
HaaAAAA! [the car totals the bike, bumps Stan onto the sidewalk, and peels away.]
DRIVER
You'd better watch yourself next time, abandoner! [Stan looks at the car, scared.]
[Jesus' house, next day. Stan walks up and rings the doorbell]
STAN
Hi, Jesus. It's me.
STAN, JESUS
Stan Marsh.
JESUS
Of course. I know you, my child. Come in.
[Jesus' house, living room. A pitcher of water sits on the coffee table]
STAN
This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!
JESUS
You're good to bring this to my attention, Stan. Cults are a very dangerous thing.
STAN
I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special.
JESUS
The miracle I'm most famous for is turning water into wine.
STAN
Can you do it again?
JESUS
Very well. I shall perform the miracle. Behold. Here you can see ordinary water, clear, clean. Okay now, turn around. [Stan looks at Jesus quizzically. Jesus is now holding the pitcher] Er, nuh, tur- turn around. [Stan turns away and Jesus quickly switches pitchers] Uh, okay now, turn back. [Stan turns back] It is now wine!
STAN
That's it? That's how you did that trick?
JESUS
Wuh well, yeah.
STAN
That trick sucks, Jesus.
JESUS
Oh. Well, I guess it worked a little better on people 2000 years ago.
STAN
Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out.
JESUS
Then let's go.
STAN
But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick.
JESUS
Oh,don't worry [rises and joins Stan out the door] I have a few more miracles up my sleeve.
[Denver, night. An arena is shown, and the place is packed. Kyle and Cartman are seated in the third row, with around Blaintologists around them]
KYLE
This is a really good turnout.
ANNOUNCER
And now, ladies and gentlemen, David Blaine. [pyrotechnics go off all around, three spotlights shine on Blaine, and the crowd cheers]
BLAINE
Hello, my children.
ANNOUNCER
Ladies and gentlemen, may we have silence, please, as magician David Blaine will now eat... his... own... head. [Blaine looks around, and a drumroll begins. Blaine then proceeds to eat his own head, then falls over. A few moments later the crowd roars with approval]
KYLE
Dude, no way! [two female Blaintology assistants rush up and help Blaine stand. One has a little cage, another has a small curtain and rod. The one to his right places the cage where the head would be, while the one on the left places the curtain in front. A few seconds later, Blaine's head is back on his shoulders. The audience cheers]
BLAINE
Thank you, everyone. [the audience quiets down] Our organization grows larger every day. Soon, the government will even have to give us tax-exempt status as a bona fide religion.
JESUS
[walking down the steps towards the stage] Hold!
MAN
It's Jesus! [more murmurs]
CARTMAN
What's he doin' here? [Jesus goes on stage]
JESUS
My children, it is time for you to go home and stop following this false prophet. You should be using your money and time for other things. These are simple magic tricks. His magic is interesting, but will it put food on your table? Feeding the hungry - now that is a miracle! [a cart with loaves and fishes is wheeled in by Stan.] Behold! I have here fives loaves of bread and three fish. Certainly not enough to feed this entire crowd, but now - turn around [the crowd stares back blankly] Ya need tuh- turn around. [Stan slaps his hand to his forehead, but the crowd turns around. Jesus proceeds to pull bread and fish from behind the cart and pour it over the original bread and fish. Soon the cart is hidden under the food] Okay, now turn back. [the crowd turns back and just looks]
CARTMAN
Now how the hell did he do that? [Blaine simply extends his right arm, lifts the bread and fish mentally from the cart and drops them over by Stan]
CROWD
Wow!
BLAINE
Your magic is old and outdated, Jesus! Twah. Just like you are.
JESUS
Oh, really. Then what's this [reaches behind Blaine's ear and pulls out a card] Ace of Spades doing behind your ear?
CROWD
Whoa. [some chatter. Blaine then levitates, goes into a spin and disappears into a deck of cards, which then splits in two. Each half traces a circle and then both halves combine to make a larger circle. This circle then becomes a tornado of cards, and David Blaine emerges from the tornado triumphant.]
JESUS
[overwhelmed] Jesus Christ!
ELDERLY WOMAN
[seated with her husband] He's incredible!
BLAINE
The old religions have failed you! Twah. What have they offered except for war, poverty, and sadness? Blaintology offers you the key to living your life to the fullest! Will you join us?
CROWD
Yes!!
[The arena, outside. Jesus and Stan exit the arena]
JESUS
His magic is too powerful, Stanley. I've never seen anything like it.
STAN
Then what are we going to do.
JESUS
I cannot face him alone. We must get the help of all the super best friends. [speaks into his left wrist] Buddha. Buddha, come in!
STAN
Super best friends?
BUDDHA
[on a little screen on Jesus' unique watch] This is Buddha, Jesus. Go ahead.
[A futuristic headquarters, somewhere... Jesus appears on a giant screen as Buddha awaits Jesus' answer]
JESUS
Buddha, we may have a problem. I've just encountered a magic I've never seen before.
BUDDHA
I'll call everyone together. Come as fast as you can.
JESUS
Come, Stanley. We must travel far and long.
STAN
To where?
JESUS
Distances unfathomable to man. Yea, take hold of my robe, Stanley, and do not open your eyes.
STAN
[shuts his eyes] I am ready.
[Inside an airplane. Jesus and Stan have center seats, and Stan's eyes are still shut]
JESUS
Are you still keeping your eyes closed?
STAN
Yeah.
JESUS
Good. Want some peanuts?
[The David Blaine Complex, night. Blaintologists gather in the main room, and a new member is having his hair shaved off]
KYLE
Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist.
STEVEN
[rushes up to the podium] Everyone! Everyone, gather 'round! I have great news for all Blaintologists, and for our new members as well. We've just gotten word from Mr. Blaine himself: The government has denied our church's request for tax-exempt status!
MEMBER
But... we want tax-exempt status.
KYLE
Yeah. Why is that good news?
STEVEN
Be-cause! Mr. Blaine has arranged for all Blaintologists members from every city and state to march into Washington and demand our right for tax-exempt status by committing a mass suicide!
KYLE
Mass suicide?
STEVEN
Mr. Blaine has said that by killing ourselves in Washington, we are guaranteed everlasting happiness in the afterlife!
MEMBER
Hehehe, that sounds good. [other members echo the sentiment]
STEVEN
Get your things ready. We leave for Washington at dawn!
CARTMAN
[jubilant] Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die!
[A blue sky in a big city. The camera pans down to show Jesus and Stan in a park-like setting]
JESUS
Alright, Stanley. You can open your eyes now. [before them is a stone-and-glass building] This is the hall of the super best friends, Stanley, the headquarters for those who stand for what's right.
MOHAMMAD
Jesus, we've been working hard since we got your distress call!
LOA TSE
Who the kid?
JESUS
Stanley, I want you to meet some of the super best friends [they are shown when mentioned]: Buddha, with the powers of invisibility; Mohammad, the Muslim prophet with the powers of flame [he raises his hands palm up and a blast of flame emerges from each hand]; Krishna, the Hindu deity; Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet; Lao Tse, the founder of Taoism [performs some martial arts moves with his cane]; and Seaman, with the ability to breathe underwater and link mentally with fish.
STAN
So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends?
MOHAMMAD
More than friends, young boy, we are super best friends, with the desire to fight for justice.
JOSEPH SMITH
We all believe in the power of good over evil. Except for Buddha, of course, who doesn't believe in evil. [Buddha shrugs and grins]
STAN
Wow.
MOHAMMAD
Jesus, come look at this. [they walk to the monitor console with Stan following] After your distress call, we entered David Blaine in the super best friends' computer.
SEAMAN
[operating the console] Many interesting things showed up. He was raised in New York city by a decent family, but a freak washing-machine accident at the age of 12 made him learn the ways of the black arts.
BUDDHA
That's right, Seamen. [the other super best friends laugh at how Buddha said Seaman's name]
SEAMAN
[insulted] Sea Man!
BUDDHA
Uh that's what I said. Seamen. [the others laugh some more]
SEAMAN
Stop it!
[The David Blaine Complex, dorm, night. Kyle walks up to Cartman's bunk.]
KYLE
[whispering] Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman!
CARTMAN
[sits up abruptly, knocking Kyle off the bed] No, Paula Poundstone! Leave me alone! Eyuh! Uh? [now alert, if confused, and Kyle stands up]
KYLE
It's just me.
CARTMAN
[sighs silently] Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest?
KYLE
Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.
CARTMAN
What?
KYLE
I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad.
CARTMAN
Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either. [points to his groin] I haven't even gotten my pubes yet.
KYLE
I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too.
CARTMAN
That co- ugh. [drops to a whisper] That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning.
KYLE
Okay. Okay, you're right. [goes down the ladder to his own bunk, underneath Cartman's, and Cartman turns over to sleep] Oh uh Cartman: thanks. [goes to sleep. Later, he wakes up inside a large domed platform. Reflections of five adult Blaintologists and Cartman can be seen on the glass dome. He sits up and blinks] Cartman? [He tries to move, but encounters the glass. He taps to make sure] What the hell? [Camera pulls back to reveal...]
[The David Blaine Complex, main room. The Blaintologists and Cartman look on.]
CARTMAN
I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou.
KYLE
What have you done, Cartman?!
CARTMAN
This is for your own good, Brother Kyle.
BLAINE
You must understand, brother Kyle, twah, you know too much about the Church. If you left now, you'd become a danger to our cause.
CARTMAN
Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit.
KYLE
[knocking on the dome] Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale!
CARTMAN
At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble!
BLAINE
The suicide pact will go as planned. If we die, we all die together. [Cartman and the Blaintologists exit and leave Kyle alone, afraid]
[the Hall of the Super Best Friends, day.]
NARRATOR
[speaks for the fist time] Meanwhile, at the Hall of Super Best Friends...
JOSEPH SMITH
Look at that, Jesus. His followers are growing at a rate even faster than mine! It appears this David Blaine is as dangerous as you and your young friend had feared.
STAN
I knew it.
JESUS
Here. I have a videotape of his performance the other night.
JOSEPH SMITH
Perhaps we should have Moses look at the tape and see what he comes up with. [Mohammad takes the tape to Moses]
MOHAMMAD
Moses, scan this tape. Can you tell us the source of Blaine's power?
MOSES
[just as he appeared in "Jewbilee"] Give me the information. [Mohammad slips the tape into a slot near Moses' tip. Stan smiles]
STAN
Wow, the Moses.
MOSES
His magic is a combination of centrifugal line and sleight of hand. Wait a minute: I'm picking up movement from Blaintologists from all over the country.
LAO TSE
The Blaintologists are heading to Washington. But why?
JESUS
Wait a minute. At his performance David Blaine said something about trying to get tax-exempt status.
JOSEPH SMITH
Omigod!
LAO TSE
What?
JOSEPH SMITH
If he gets tax-exempt status, then he'll become a real religion.
KRISHNA
He would become unstoppable
[Washington D.C., day. The Blaintologists have gathered around the Reflecting Pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial]
NARRATOR
Meanwhile, in the nation's capital, Blaintologists from all over the country have gathered to commit mass suicide!
BLAINE
[facing the audience, with the Washington Monument in the distance] If the government will not give us tax-exempt status, then we must prove that we are willing to die for our beliefs, twah.
STEVEN
Alright, brothers and sisters, gather around. [they do so] It's time to drown ourselves in the Reflecting Pool! [he steps down into the pool] However, the-ah Reflecting Pool is a little more shallow than we originally thought, so to drown ourselves, you will need to lie on your stomach, face down, until you die, as such. [drops down into the water and floats on his stomach, expelling air for a few seconds, then groans to death as water fills his lungs. The corpse begins to float away]
MAN
Next! [A woman drops in, than a man...]
[The White House, day. The White House staff gathers at one of the windows to watch. Shown are Princess, Laura and George W. Bush, Karl Rove, and Maggie]
NARRATOR
Meanwhile, at the White House...
KARL ROVE
Mr. President, we can't let them all kill themselves!
GEORGE BUSH
Well we can't give them tax-exempt status either, Karl!
LARRY
[walks in] He-e-ey George! What's gon' on?
[Washington D.C., day. Cartman gets ready to flood Kyle, who's still in the glass dome, with a fire hose. More corpses float in the Reflecting Pool]
CARTMAN
Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die! [pushes the dome into the pool]
KYLE
Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!
CARTMAN
[brings the hose over] But it's the only way for us to be happy. [plugs the hose into the dome and releases the water]
KYLE
Cartman, no!
[The Reflecting Pool, later]
BLAINE
Give us what we want or we will continue to die
JESUS
Not so fast, David Blaine!
BLAINE
Jesus! Not again.
JESUS
Yes! But this time, I've brought some help! Super Best Friends! [they fly down as they are announced]
BUDDHA
Buddha!
MOHAMMAD
Mohammad!
JOSEPH SMITH
Joseph Smith!
KRISHNA
Krishna!
LAO TSE
Lao Tse!
SEAMAN
Sea-Man!
JESUS
The mass suicide is over, Blaine! And so are you!
BLAINE
I don't think so. Get them! [Blaintologists go on the attack. Two of them go for Mohammad, who shoots flames at them. They scream.]
JOSEPH SMITH
My ice breath should take care of you. [blasts some air at an oncoming Blaintologist, who freezes in place]
STAN
[emerges from the crowd and looks around the Reflecting Pool] Kyle! Kyle!
BLAINTOLOGIST
Sweet Salvation! [Stan sees the man drown, then notices a boy in the pool]
STAN
Kyle?? [frantically, he goes into the pool and reaches the boy, turning him over. A few seconds of observation and... gasp] Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
KYLE
[off-screen] You bastards!
STAN
Kyle? [looks to his left and calls out] Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
KYLE
[off-screen] You bastards! [Stan looks up and follows Kyle's voice]
STAN
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
JESUS
That takes care of them.
JOSEPH SMITH
Now it's your turn, Blaine!
BLAINE
Perhaps you need to see some real magic. [floats up to Lincoln's left foot and touches it. His magic infuses the statue with life, and Lincoln breaks free from his chair]
LINCOLN
Raaargh! [steps down towards the crowd]
BUDDHA
Oh this looks like trouble.
BLAINE
[floating high above the crowd] So long, Super Best Fools!
STAN
[reaches Kyle] Kyle!
KYLE
Stan!
STAN
Kyle, you can't kill yourself!
KYLE
I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water! [tremulous footsteps are felt, and Lincoln is shown walking among the crowd of Blaintologists]
JESUS
We've gotta stop that oversized Abraham Lincoln! Mohammad! [Mohammad rises into the air and blasts Lincoln with flames. Lincoln growls and swats Mohammad away with ease] Great Scott!
CARTMAN
[trying to drown himself from the edge of the Reflecting Pool] Bliegh! [rises. His body is on land] Yugh. Uh, okay, try again. Hep [dunks his head in the water again].
[Shot of Washington D.C. from the Vietnam Memorial. Lincoln is taking buildings off their foundations and tossing them aside. Krishna, in the form of an eagle, flies over the scene. Flames are everywhere.]
MOHAMMAD
It is too powerful, Jesus!
KRISHNA
[lands] It seems to have no weakness!
JESUS
There has to be a way to destroy it. [raises his left wrist to speak into the watch] Jesus to Moses!
[The Hall of Super Best Friends, day, at that moment]
NARRATOR
Meanwhile, at the Super Best Friends League...
JESUS
Come in, Moses!
MOSES
What?
JESUS
We need to know how to kill a giant stone Abraham Lincoln.
MOSES
...Um... Let me think, um... a giant stone John Wilkes Booth?
JESUS
[thinks for a moment] You heard him, Super Best Friends! We've got to make a giant stone John Wilkes Booth!
MOHAMMAD
Krishna, we're going to need wood for a mold!
KRISHNA
Form of... a beaver! [transforms into a beaver and runs off to chop down trees]
MOHAMMAD
I will find sources to concrete. [points to Seaman] You, get the water to mix it with, Seaman. [the other friends laugh]
NARRATOR
Using the wood that Krishna cut down as a beaver, Jesus uses his master carpentry skills to make a giant mold.
JESUS
That should do the trick. Now for some concrete.
NARRATOR
Meanwhile, in the ocean depths, Seaman seeks out water to mix with the concrete.
SEAMAN
Sea-Man! [lands on the ocean bottom] Look, Swallow, we should be able to divert the water with that pipe.
NARRATOR
And so, Seaman and Swallow get to... get to work [laughs]
[The Reflecting Pool, later. Water fills the bubble Kyle is in, and he struggles to breathe]
STAN
Kyle, you have to hold your breath! [a giant stone hand comes down and grabs the bubble as Stan looks on helplessly. Everyone backs away from the stone Lincoln as it holds Kyle in its left hand. Lincoln shakes Kyle around like a snow globe, and Stan gets mad] Oh, very funny! [Seaman and Joseph Smith pour the raw materials needed for a statue into Jesus' mold, and Mohammad fires the statue like a piece of clay. The likeness of John Wilkes Booth appears on the statue]
JESUS
Lao Tse, bring it to life. [Lao Tse puts index fingers to temples and shuts his eyes to concentrate on the task at hand]
NARRATOR
Using his power of Taoism, Lao Tse becomes one with the giant stone John Wilkes Booth. [the Booth statue begins to move. It breaks out of its mold, walks up behind the Lincoln statue, and fires one stone bullet into the back of Lincoln's head. Lincoln's head jerks back, and he falls forward, ending up face down. The bubble falls out of his hand and breaks up on the ground. Kyle is washed out]
KYLE
Wagh. [sits up]
JESUS
It worked. Now freeze over the pool so no one else can drown themselves! [Quickly, Joseph Smith reaches the Reflecting Pool and blows ice-cold air over it. The water turns to white ice as other Blaintologists try to drown themselves. Cartman tries once more, but looks up quickly]
CARTMAN
Hey, I was just about to do it.
[The Reflecting Pool, later. The crowd of Blaintologists is still there, and the water has melted]
NARRATOR
Later, at exactly the same location...
BLAINE
[now in his escape vehicle, on its own launcher] Damn you, Super Best Friends!
JESUS
Your magic is no match for our powers combined, Blaine!
BLAINE
Then I guess you win this time, Super Best Fools! But I'll be back! [he fires up the little rocket ship and takes off into the sky]
JESUS
Goddamnit! [behind him and the other Super Best Friends is a city in ruins]
BUDDHA
It's alright. Everything is as it should be.
JESUS
Oh, shut up, Buddha!
STEVEN
Our leader, he... he's leaving us! [a Blaintologist, about to drown himself, looks up and sees the ship fly away]
BLAINTOLOGIST
Don't leave us, David Blaine!
STAN
[with mic. Kyle and Cartman stand some distance to his left] Listen up, everyone! [the Super Best Friends gather behind him] You don't need David Blaine to tell you how to live. See, cults are dangerous because they promise you hope, happiness and, maybe even an afterlife. But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all.
BLAINTOLOGIST
He's right. He... he's right! [the crowd cheers, and Stan walks over to Kyle]
KYLE
Thanks for saving us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend.
STAN
Your my Super Best Friend too, Kyle.
CARTMAN
Oh, that's so sweet you guys. [Stan and Kyle are not amused] You wanna go get a room so you can make out for a while? Heheheheheh [Kyle turns and kicks Cartman in the groin, knocking him down]
KYLE
[moves away so Stan can have a turn] Haha, hehahaha.
CARTMAN
[Stan kicks him] Ah! [Kyle's turn] Ow, stop it! [Stan's turn] Ah! [they continue taking turns kicking Cartman in the groin — Roshambo!]
JESUS
Well, it looks like everything worked out. [the Super Best Friends take off into the air]
NARRATOR
And so, Jesus and his companions leave Washington. But their return is assured, for there will always be a need for... the Super Best Friends!
End of Super Best Friends


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:After the other boys explain to Cartman that pubes don't count unless you grow your own, Cartman realizes he's been tricked by the school bully, Scott Tenorman.

script:Scott Tenorman Must Die

[Morning in South Park. Cartman is riding his Big Wheels down the road, singing to himself. He soon reaches the bus stop. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are standing there]
CARTMAN
Doodoo doot doo, dadadadada daa, ya da dadaa
Doodoo doot doo, dadada daa,
heydy heydy heydy,
how's it goin', guys?
KYLE
What the hell are you so happy about, fatass? [Cartman gets off his bike]
CARTMAN
[coolly] Oh, nothing. No big deal, really.
STAN
What's no big deal?
CARTMAN
Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all.
KYLE
...What the hell are you talking about?
CARTMAN
Well, because, unlike you guys, I just got my first pubes! Ayada da daa, yadadadadee! [dances]
KENNY
(You got pubes??)
KYLE
What's "pubes"?
STAN
Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair.
KYLE
Oh. [to Cartman] No you didn't!
CARTMAN
Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man!
STAN
He's lying. [turns and walks away. Kenny follows, then Kyle]
CARTMAN
You wanna see 'em?
KYLE
[turns to look at them] Hell no! [Stan and Kenny turn to look]
CARTMAN
[reaches into his pants] Here, check 'em out.
STAN
[looks away and hides his eyes] We don't wanna see them, Cartman! [Kyle turns around, Kenny shuts his hood tight]
CARTMAN
There, see? How do you like them apples! [in his right hand is a clump of pubic hair. The other boys look, with Kyle ready to cover his eyes again] HA!
KYLE
[approaches] Uh, what are those? [Stan and Kenny follow]
CARTMAN
My pubes.
STAN
What??
CARTMAN
I got 'em from Scott Tenorman.
KYLE
Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader?
CARTMAN
Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten bucks. [sing-song] Ha ha ha! I got pubes 'fore you guys did! I got pubes 'fore youuu guys! Ahahahahahahaa ha! [dances a little more]
STAN
Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable.
CARTMAN
[moves in between Stan and Kyle and embraces them, one under each arm, and gloats. Kyle looks at Cartman's right hand] Don't be jealous, guys. [Kyle looks at Cartman] This doesn't mean we can't still hang out. [Kyle looks back at Cartman's hand] It just means that I matured faster than you. [Kyle fears for that hair touching him] You'll get your pubes guys, someday.
KYLE
Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!
CARTMAN
Uh oo what?
STAN
When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass!
CARTMAN
Nuh uh!
KYLE
Yuh huh!
CARTMAN
[looks at his purchase] But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars?
KYLE
Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!
CARTMAN
You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.
KYLE
Yeah.
CARTMAN
[walks off in a huff] Huh I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.
[A lavender house, day. Three teens sit on the front steps]
SCOTT
And so I told him, I said "Here. I'll sell you my pubes for only ten bucks." And this stupid asshole buys them! [the other two boys laugh]
ANOTHER BOY
Oh man! [Cartman makes his way up to the boys]
SCOTT
Speak of the devil! What do you want?
CARTMAN
Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please?
SCOTT
Uh uh, I don't take returns!
CARTMAN
Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you!
SCOTT
You would actually tell your mom that you were stupid enough to pay for my pubes? Huh uh, I don't think so!
CARTMAN
Just give me back my money...
SCOTT
Buyer beware, dude!
CARTMAN
Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!
SCOTT
Hehey, I said no! Now get your fat little butt out of here before I kick your head in! [defeated, Cartman walks away]
[Scott's house, later. Cartman rings the doorbell]
CARTMAN
[in costume, with briefcase] Hello, sir, my name is Kris
Kristofferson. I'm with the IRS. I'm here to collect ten dollars that you own in back taxes.
SCOTT
You're not from the IRS! You glued my pubes onto your face!
CARTMAN
[thinks a bit] Tax evasion is a very serious offense, sir! I suggest that you...
SCOTT
Alright alright. I'll trade you my pubes back for the money.
CARTMAN
You will? Oh, cool!
SCOTT
How much did I charge? Uh, oh yeah. Ten dollars. You got change for a twenty?
CARTMAN
Oh. Uh, lessee. [pulls out some money] I only got six dollars and twelve cents.
SCOTT
Oh. well... that's okay. Here. Just... give me the six dollars. [done.] And then I'll... give you the twenty.
CARTMAN
...Okay.
SCOTT
Now, give me the pubes, and I'll give you back two dollars.
CARTMAN
Right.
SCOTT
Now, give me the twelve cents, and I'll give you the rest of your change back.
CARTMAN
Cool.
SCOTT
And then give me the twenty, and I'll give you the pubes. [walks back in the house with his money back]
CARTMAN
Sweet! [the door closes] Uh. Oh, goddamnit!
[Bijou movie house, later. The boys are going to see a "BIG WAR MOVIE"]
CARTMAN
That asshole! That big, smelly, ass-sniffin' asshole! I'm gonna get him!
KYLE
Cartman, can I give you some advice?
CARTMAN
What?
KYLE
Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count your losses and move on. He's smarter than you.
CARTMAN
He is not smarter than me! He just charmed me, that's all! He's a charmer, that Scott Tenorman!! But I'll get him someday!! [the boys reach the box office and buy their tickets]
KYLE
One please.
STAN
One please.
KENNY
(One please.)
CARTMAN
One please. [with no money, he tries to pay with pubic hair. Nothing happens for a while]
RICK
That'll be six dollars.
CARTMAN
O-kay, and how much is that in pubes?
RICK
We don't take pubes!
CARTMAN
Listen, my money is as good as anybody's! Don't you, uh, discriminate against my people by not accepting these pubes.
RICK
We don't take pubes!! End of story!!
CARTMAN
Racist! [takes the pubes and runs off]
[Scott's house, later. Cartman rings the doorbell again]
CARTMAN
Scott, Scott! Courtney Love is in South Park! She's all drunk and spreading her legs and showing her poonanner to everybody! You gotta go check it out! I'll watch your house for ya!
SCOTT
Okay, I'll buy the pubes back! Here!
CARTMAN
[stunned] What?
SCOTT
Sixteen dollars! Take it! I-I'll even throw in an extra five! Here! Give me back my pubes!
CARTMAN
[softly] Wha-? Uh oo [audibly] why do you want then back so much?
SCOTT
No reason.
CARTMAN
I don't believe you.
SCOTT
Alright alright! The pube fair in Fort Collins.
CARTMAN
Pube fair?
SCOTT
They're paying five bucks a hair for pubes! If I leave now, I can catch the last bus!
CARTMAN
Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars!
SCOTT
Hehere, take your money!
CARTMAN
Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself!
SCOTT
Oh, you can't do this to me! Nooo!
CARTMAN
Haha, charade you are, Scott! [runs away quickly]
SCOTT
Have you no heart??
[Bus Terminal, day. Cartman stands in line waiting for a trip to Fort Collins. People are boarding the bus]
CARTMAN
[cuts through the line] Ahaaa, what a stupid asshole! Hahahahaha! [enters the bus]
[Bus, evening. The sun has already set and Cartman is still on the bus, en route to Fort Collins]
CARTMAN
Hohoho! I won a million dollars!! Whew! Ow!
[Fort Collins, night. Cartman gets off the bus and walks]
CARTMAN
Hahaaha! Ha. Ha. Heh. Huh, excuse me, sir.
MAN
Yes?
CARTMAN
Can you tell me where the pube fair is?
MAN
The pube fair?
CARTMAN
Yeah, I have some pubes to sell.
MAN
There's no such thing, you little smartass! [walks away]
CARTMAN
No- no such thing?
TEEN BOY
[approaches with a box] Hey, you wouldn't happen to be Eric Cart-man, would you?
CARTMAN
I'm Eric Cartman.
TEEN BOY
Well, I think this is for you. [hands it to Cartman and walks away. Cartman sets the box down and opens it. He looks in, and a look of shock is on his face. He reaches in and pulls out... more pubic hair]
CARTMAN
[screams] Aaah!!!
[Scott's house, night. Cartman rings the doorbell again, this time in the rain. Scott answers. Cartman is soaked with rain, his beanie wrinkling]
CARTMAN
A hundred and six miles, Scott. I had to ride a hundred and six miles in the back of a pickup truck... to get back here
SCOTT
You really went? What a 'tard.
CARTMAN
Alright, Scott, you win. I give up.
SCOTT
You do? Wow, you're not as stupid as I thought.
CARTMAN
Yeah, I'll see you around. [walks down the steps and towards the street, but stops] Sure is too bad about my grandma, though...
SCOTT
Your grandma?
CARTMAN
[turns around] Huh? Oh, it's... it's not really your concern, since uh-... well, my grandma's in the hospital. She's very sick. The doctors say unless I can come up with sixteen dollars for her operation, they're gonna put her down.
SCOTT
Oh. [strokes his chin] Jeez, I-... I didn't realize that.
CARTMAN
Yeah. Poor grandma...
SCOTT
Hey, kid... Hold on a second ah, ah, I'll get your money. [through the window, Scott is seen going for the money]
CARTMAN
[evilly, to himself] Heheheheheh. He's such a douche, heheheheheh. [turns around and returns to the house. Scott returns]
SCOTT
Here you go.
CARTMAN
Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Scott! [Scott withholds the money]
SCOTT
But... just one thing before I give it to you:
CARTMAN
What?
SCOTT
I just... well... I want you to beg for it.
CARTMAN
Huh?
SCOTT
Just... get down on your knees and- beg me for the money.
CARTMAN
Why??
SCOTT
Do you want your grandma to live or not?
CARTMAN
[looks around to make sure no one else is watching, then quickly] Please Scott give me my money.
SCOTT
No, no, get down on your knees. [Cartman begins to get on his knees] Lower your head [Cartman lowers it], and say "I beg you to give me back my money."
CARTMAN
I beg you to give me back my money.
SCOTT
Now say, "I'm a little piggy".
CARTMAN
What?
SCOTT
Say it!
CARTMAN
[looks around] I'm a little piggy.
SCOTT
[points to his nose] "Here's my snout."
CARTMAN
[points to his nose] Here's my snout.
SCOTT
"Oink oink oink."
CARTMAN
Oink oink oink.
SCOTT
Now dance, little piggy! Dance and oink for me!
CARTMAN
[looks back angrily for a few seconds, then]
I'm a little piggy; here's my snout.
Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.
[Scott begins to laugh]
I'm a little piggy; here's
- Aalrightalrightalright, now give me back my money!
SCOTT
You mean this? [Cartman brightens up] You really care that much about sixteen measly dollars? I mean, what can you buy with sixteen dollars? My parents give me a fifty dollar-a-week allowance. This pittance means nothing to me. Watch. [holds the bills out and strikes a lighter under them]
CARTMAN
What- What are you doing?? [the bills light up and burn from one end to the other. Scott lets the burning bills float away] No!... Wh-why?
SCOTT
Now you can't bug me for your dumb money! [turns around and enters the house, shutting the door behind him. Cartman then turns and walks towards the street anew. Halfway there, he looks at his mitts, then grows indignant]
CARTMAN
[yells at the sky] Yaaaarrgh! ...You'll diiiiiiiiiie! ...Damn youuuuuuuuuu!
[Cartman's house, cellar. The kids in class has been reunited for something important. They're chattering amongst themselves]
CARTMAN
[descending the stairs] Concerned citizens, I thank you for coming. [walks to the easel] I know that you are all deeply troubled and want to find a quick and painful way to get rid of Scott Tenorman once and for all! [Clyde raises his hand] Yes, Clyde!
CLYDE
Who's Scott Tenorman?
KIDS
Yeah.
KYLE
Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off.
CARTMAN
[correcting Kyle] Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge!
BUTTERS
Wuh what are you gonna do?
CARTMAN
Did you guys see that movie "Hannibal"? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony [flips the first page over to reveal a drawing of a pony and takes up the pointer with his left hand], we can train it. Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's wiener. [the other kids just stare back, but Cartman continues] It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!!
KYLE
What's in it for us?
CARTMAN
What?
STAN
Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?
CARTMAN
Oh, right. Why should we care? [slaps the pointer into his right hand] Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, "It's not your problem." But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, "You may take our pride, but you'll never take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!" [flips to the next page, which has written on it "$16.12" with double underline] Now who's with me? [turns around to find only Timmy in the basement]
TIMMY
Timmay!
CARTMAN
[slaps his forehead and sighs] Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy!
TIMMY
Euuh, livin' a lie, Timmih. [rolls out of the room. Cartman is stunned, then angry]
[A barn, day. Cartman stands next to a scarecrow. He pulls out a frank from a bag of wieners and places it in the scarecrow's crotch]
CARTMAN
There we go. [stands aside] Come and get it. [camera pulls back to reveal a pony nearby] ...Come on, pony, bite the wiener. Bite it. [the pony looks, then approaches] Come on, good pony. That's it! [the pony sniffs the wiener] Now, bite it off! Bite off the wiener! Good pony! [the pony bares its teeth... only to start licking the wiener] Oh no, pony, he'll like that.
JIMBO
[rushing up with Ned after eying Cartman in the corral] Eric! Are you training that pony to please you?
CARTMAN
No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off. [by this time, the pony is sucking on the wiener]
JIMBO
Oh. Well, does Mr. Denkins know you're usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers on sight, you know.
CARTMAN
He said it was okay.
JIMBO
Alright, then. [turns to walk away, but remembers something] Wait, why the hell are you trainin' Denkins' pony to bite off someone's penis?
CARTMAN
Because [ominously] of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!
JIMBO
Well, son, I think you have a pretty stupid plan there.
CARTMAN
[noticing the sucking] Not like that, pony! [slaps the wiener out of its mouth]
JIMBO
Look, if you wanna get revenge on somebody, you've gotta think like a hunter. [the pony reaches for the wiener and starts sucking it again]
CARTMAN
Whattayou mean?
JIMBO
Step 1: Find someone's weakness. Step 2: Exploit that weakness.
CARTMAN
How do I do that?
[Scott's house, night. Cartman appears in the bushes across the street. He pulls out binoculars and checks out the various rooms in the house. He sees Scott in his room, with Radiohead posters on his wall]
JIMBO
[pops up] What do you see? [Ned pops up. All three are in camouflage]
CARTMAN
I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!!
JIMBO
No, young hunter. I mean, what do you see? You must learn all you can about your kill.
CARTMAN
Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead!
JIMBO
Ooh, what's a Radiohead?
CARTMAN
You know, that band that sings that song: Well, I'm a creep. I'm a weirdo...
NED
Mmuh, what am I doing here?
JIMBO
Oh, Jesus, don't start singing, Ned!
CARTMAN
So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a [British accent] li'l ol' scheme [normal] that involves them.
JIMBO
Nice thinking, young hunter.
CARTMAN
Whoa!
JIMBO
What?
CARTMAN
I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra.
JIMBO
What?! Give me those! [rips the binoculars away and looks for himself] Holy crow, he's right, Ned! Mrs. Tenorman's lettin' the twins out!
NED
Mn let me see.
CARTMAN
Radiohead. Yes, of course. [drops down]
JIMBO
Dear God, they're bigger than I ever imagined!
NED
Let me see. Let me see.
JIMBO
Here you go. [allows Ned to look through the binoculars, and Ned begins to masturbate] Wow, those are great. Maybe I should go grab some beers, Ned. Ned, what- a-are you jackin' it?
NED
Kinda.
JIMBO
Well, stop it! [the porch light turns on and Mr. Tenorman walks out the front door. Jimbo and Ned freeze]
MR. TENORMAN
Hey, what the hell are you doing out there?
JIMBO
[hushed] Oh crap!
MR. TENORMAN
Who's out there?
JIMBO
[hushed] Ned, for Christ's sake, stop jackin'!
NED
I can't.
MR. TENORMAN
Don't think I don't see you! I know who you are and I'm calling the police! [Jimbo and Ned witness other men rise from the pushes and split. Among them are Randy, in a Groucho Marx outfit; Gerald, dressed as a clown; Stuart, with a paper shopping bag over his head; one man in scuba gear, and one more man]
A MAN
Whoa, I gotta get out of here! [Mr. Tenorman is left wondering why so many men were there.]
[Scott's house, the next day. Cartman returns yet again and rings the doorbell. Scott answers.]
CARTMAN
[cheerfully] Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all?
SCOTT
Uh huh.
CARTMAN
Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown. [gloats] Everyone's gonna be there!
SCOTT
Oh, cool. Um, thanks for tellin' me.
CARTMAN
You're welcome, Scott. [turns and walks away]
[Downtown South Park, night. Cartman stands on a small stage as a crowd gathers. On stage is a big-screen TV and tower speakers]
CARTMAN
Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we? [activates the screen and then walks off stage]
KURT LODER
Welcome back to MTV. We're here with the members from Radiohead, probably the hottest band in the world right now. [Cartman joins the crowd and stands next to Scott, his mood changing from happy to mad] Guys, when is the next album coming out?
CARTMAN
[has taped over the band's answers with his own — first as Thom Yorke] That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid. [now as Johnny Greenwood] Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too. [Now as Ed O'Brien] I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?
CARTMAN
Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott? [Scott looks down, and ponders Cartman's role]
KURT LODER
And will there be a new tour?
CARTMAN
[Now as Phil Selway] Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that we don't want to. [Now as Thom Yorke] Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's not cool!
CARTMAN
Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott. [Scott is gone] Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA! [feedback is heard] What a retard! [the kids around him face right] And now everyone saw it! [looks around]
SCOTT
[off screen] Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's time for the amazing Pube Boy! [moves aside to show an ever bigger TV, which is turned on. Scott has apparently filmed Cartman earlier begging for his money]
CARTMAN
[on screen] '"I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink."' [the kids begin to laugh hard, then harder. The same clip is shown over and over, and Kenny begins to laugh. Soon he can't control himself, and falls over dead. His ghost appears and continues laughing]
STAN
[looks over at Kenny's corpse] Oh my God, he killed Kenny.
CARTMAN
[seething with anger] That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!!
[That night, dark and stormy, appropriate for Cartman's mood at the moment, Cartman's house. A boy possessed, he's in his room devising a new plan. An evil look comes across his face]
CARTMAN
Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!! [goes into whispers and brings out a protractor and a compass] Then... that... [finishes his plan] Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman is going to wish he never met meee!!! [a truly evil grin appears on his face.]
[Mr. Denkins' farm, next day. Cartman is back at the corral waiting for his friends. Stan and Kyle walk up.]
KYLE
Okay, Cartman, what do you want?
CARTMAN
Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!
STAN
Got what all figured out?
CARTMAN
How to get Scott Tenorman back!
KYLE
[rolls his eyes] Oh, Jesus!
CARTMAN
I just finished planning a brilliant [British accent] li'l scheme [normal] that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars. [holds out two fingers]
KYLE
Okay, so what's the plan?
CARTMAN
It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right?
STAN
Yeah.
CARTMAN
So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — and — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony! [camera pulls back to reveal the setup: pony, scarecrow with wiener attached to groin]
KYLE
...What?
CARTMAN
Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!! [laughs demonically] Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!! [nothing happens for a few seconds]
KYLE
You're such a dumbass, Cartman. [he and Stan turn and walk away]
CARTMAN
...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!! [walks over to the pony] Ready, pony? [the pony nods] Bite it! [the pony bites off a piece of the wiener] Yes!! [exults]
[London Recording Studio, day. Inside, Radiohead prepares to record. One of them is on the floor reading fan mail]
JOHNNY
Thom, will you stop reading fan mail? We have work to do.
THOM
Just a second, fellas. Listen to this:
Dear Radiohead, My name is Eric Cartman. I'm a young, supple eight-year-old boy from South Park, Colorado. I am writing to you because of a kid I know named Scott Tenorman. Scott is fifteen, and I'm afraid he has cancer. In his ass. Radiohead is his favorite band, and it would make his short life if you could find it in your hearts to visit him before he dies alone and scared. Won't you please consider it? I don't think he'll make it past... next Tuesday around 5.
PHIL
Wow, we have to go.
ED
To Colorado? But we have an album to mix.
THOM
Didn't you hear the letter?? This poor kid has cancer! In his ass!
[Scott's house, day. A phone rings. Scott answers it in the living room.]
SCOTT
Hello?
KYLE
[voice at other end] Scott Tenorman?
SCOTT
What do you want?
KYLE
We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is going' to try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch.
SCOTT
How do you know?
KYLE
'Cause, we're his friends.
SCOTT
Then why are you telling me?
KYLE
'Cause we hate him.
SCOTT
Oh.
KYLE
Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya.
SCOTT
See ya. [the doorbell rings. Scott walks over to open the door]
[At the front door]
CARTMAN
[with tickets in hand] Hello, Scott!
SCOTT
Hey.
CARTMAN
I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides. [shows him the face of the ticket] Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!
SCOTT
Ooo, a chili carnival, huh? That sounds great.
CARTMAN
[getting smug] Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott. Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride!
SCOTT
Wow, a pony ride. Neat.
CARTMAN
Oh, it will be very neat, Scott.
SCOTT
Gosh. Chili, rides, and ponies? What more could I want?
CARTMAN
[under his breath] A little penis-biting, perhaps?
SCOTT
What?
CARTMAN
Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott?
SCOTT
How can I turn it down?
CARTMAN
Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott. [Scott turns around and closes the door] Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very good. [leaves]
[back in the living room]
SCOTT
Mom, Dad, that was my good friend Eric at the door? He told me that there's a starving pony at Denkins' ranch that's been abandoned.
MRS. TENORMAN
Oh dear.
SCOTT
Yeah, I feel really bad. But I don't know how I can help it, because I have a lot of homework to do.
MR. TENORMAN
[drops his paper. Both parents rise] Well, don't you worry, Scott. Your mom and I can go get the pony and have it taken to an animal shelter.
MRS. TENORMAN
We sure can.
SCOTT
Wow, would you really? I feel so much better now.
MRS. TENORMAN
[hugs him] Oh, Scott, you're such a loving, caring boy. I'm so proud of you.
SCOTT
I'm proud of you, too, Mom.
MRS. TENORMAN
Let's go, hon. [heads for the door]
MR. TENORMAN
Let's. [follows her out]
[In the kitchen. Scott is cooking up something... his friends arrive]
BUDDY 1
What are you doing, Scott?
SCOTT
What's it look like? I'm making chili. Did you bring the goods?
BUDDY 2
[holds out a bag full of hair] We got everyone we could find to chip in. [his friend giggles] There are pubes from just about every single kid in town.
SCOTT
Awesome! [yanks the bag away, opens it, and mixes the pubes into the chili]
BUDDY 1
Oh, dude!
SCOTT
The little fat kid thinks he's gonna get revenge tomorrow. We'll see how he likes it when I tell him he just ate the pubes of every kid in town!
BUDDY 2
Yeah! [hi-fives Scott, and the three laugh heartily]
[South Park, next day. The Chili Con Carnival is in full swing. People have already arrived. Stan and Kyle walk up]
CARTMAN
[steps out of the ticket booth to greet them] Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!
STAN
This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman.
CARTMAN
[smug] Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks!
KYLE
Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this. [looks at Stan, who's smiling]
CARTMAN
What's so funny?
STAN
Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet?
CARTMAN
Not yet, but they will be.
KYLE
Yeah, sure. [As Chef arrives, Stan and Kyle leave]
CHEF
Hello, Eric!
CARTMAN
Hey, Chef.
CHEF
I made some chili to enter into the contest.
CARTMAN
What contest?
CHEF
This is a chili cook-off, ain't it?
CARTMAN
Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here.
CHEF
It's my special recipe.
CARTMAN
[seeing Scott, interrupts. Slowly and sweetly] Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming! [Scott holds a small container of chili]
SCOTT
Oh, I wouldn't miss this for anything.
CARTMAN
[overjoyed] Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony!
SCOTT
Just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first?
CARTMAN
Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.
SCOTT
Well I don't want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize.
CARTMAN
[sighs silently] Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first. [Scott leaves] Goddamnit!
[Cartman's house, the judging table. Cartman and Scott take their seats. Behind Scott stand Butters, Kyle, Stan, and Scott's friends. Behind Cartman stand Bebe, Clyde, and Tolkien]
SCOTT
[setting his plate before Cartman] Alright, I guess we should taste each other's chili, huh?
CARTMAN
[inspecting the dish] Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine. [hands his plate to Scott, who takes it to his end of the table and starts eating]
SCOTT
Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it.
CARTMAN
Alright. [takes the dish and starts eating. Both boys munch away for a few moments] Hey, this is great! [Stan and Kyle stifle giggles]
SCOTT
Eh, it's a special recipe.
CARTMAN
[begins to wolf down the food] Gawh, this is really good, Scott!
SCOTT
I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have some'in' to tell you.
CARTMAN
What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? [Everyone at Scott's end of the table is shocked, even Scott, at this accusation]
SCOTT
What?!
CARTMAN
Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's. [Chef looks like he's been used] It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap. [Stan and Kyle are stunned] I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area. [A shot of Cartman telling Denkins of such a thing. Denkins is armed] I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents. [A shot of Scott talking with his parents] And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents. [The Tenormans are in the corral to rescue the "starving" pony, but upon seeing Mr. Tenorman's lit flashlight, Mr. Denkins fires at them, and they go down]
MR. DENKINS
[looks of horror surround him] Well, they was trespassin' and I was protectin' myself. I, I have my rights.
SCOTT
My... mom and dad are... dead? [A shot of Officer Barbrady taking a report from Denkins]
CARTMAN
I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies... [A shot of Cartman arriving, seeing Denkins and Barbrady, and pulling the bodies away. The pony munches at some grass] After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili. [more faces of horror behnd Cartman] Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott? [A gleefully evil look comes over Cartman] I call it, "Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili."
SCOTT
[looks at Cartman for a while, realizing what's just happened] Oh my God! [gagging, he fishes through the plate and finds his mom's wedding ring, still on her finger. He tosses it away] Oh my God!! [vomits off to the side]
CARTMAN
[leaping up on the table and sings] Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! [Stan and Kyle are way stunned]
STAN
Jesus Christ, dude!
SCOTT
[grief-stricken, he buries his face on the table] My mom and dad are dead! [pounds the table] No! NOOO!! [Radiohead arrives and stands behind Scott. Stan notices]
THOM
Uhm, excuse me?
STAN
Who are you?
JOHNNY
We're that band, Radiohead.
SCOTT
[raises his head] Jesus!
ED
Jeez, what a li'l crybaby!
COLIN
Are you gonna cry all day, crybaby??
THOM
You know, everyone has problems; it doesn't mean you have to be a little crybaby about it.
ED
Come on, guys, let's go. This kid is totally not cool. [the members of the band start leaving]
THOM
Yeah, that's the most uncool kid I've ever met.
PHIL
Little crybaby!
SCOTT
[gathers himself and looks] No, wait! Waaiittt!! Oh my God, Oh my Gaawwwd!! [buries his face in the table and bawls again] Noooo!
CARTMAN
[walks over to Scott's end of the table] Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott! [starts licking Scott's tears off his face] Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet.
KYLE
Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again.
STAN
Good call.
CARTMAN
Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-yummy. [licks the tears off the table and off Scott's face.] Mm-yummy you guys! [the iris common to Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons appears, with fanfare] Yuppitibut, that's all, folks! [waves]
End of Scott Tenorman Must Die


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:When the boys discover Terrance and Philip have called it quits, they'll go to any lengths to reunite the duo and recruit them for South Park's Earth Day festivities.

script:Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow

[Cartman's house, day. Cartman and his friends sit on the sofa watching TV]
ANNOUNCER
[voice only] And so, in her career filled with lies, backstabbing, and whoring herself for money, [shot of the TV, with the camera panning up to reveal Punky Brewster sitting in a director's chair] she learned that the price of fame can be pleasing 65 men at once in a dark, dirty alley. [image of Punky makes room for the show's logo on the right side] And so ends "Punky Brewster, Behind The Blow."
CARTMAN
Whoa, bummer, dude.
KYLE
Okay, dude, it's 3:30. [Cartman changes the channel]
ANNOUNCER 2
[Shot of TV as "The Terrance & Phillip Show" begins] It's time for the Terrance & Phillip Show!
THE BOYS
Yay!
PHILLIP
Excuse me, buddy.
TERRANCE
Why, did you fart? [farts] Oh, no! [both laugh]
STAN
Oh man, this is another rerun.
CARTMAN
Are you sure? I haven't seen it.
KYLE
Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch.
PHILLIP
I'm looking for a mechanic. Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage?
TERRANCE
Sure, buddy! All you need to do is go down to the [faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaart. Whatever Terrance is saying is drowned out by the fart], and that's how you [boys join in] get to the auto garage!
PHILLIP
Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage without farting?
TERRANCE
Sure. You go the same way [Kyle chimes in] except stick your finger up your ass.
PHILLIP
No no no! I mean, could you tell me the directions again without you farting?
TERRANCE
OOOH! Sure! Just stick your finger up my ass.
PHILLIP
Alright, no problem, buddy. [Terrance lowers his pants enough to show his ass; Phillip sticks his finger in there] Now, tell me: How do I get to the auto garage to see a mechanic?
TERRANCE
[now wearing a mechanic's hat] You're at the auto garage. I am the mechanic.
PHILLIP
Why the heck didn't you tell me you were the mechanic?
STAN
Because I had an itch up my ass.
TERRANCE
Because I had an itch up my ass. [the two laugh, then the boys laugh, then the laughter dies down. Terrance farts again, and they both laugh as the camera's iris shuts slowly.]
[Cut to next scene, where they are working on toilet plumbing]
TERRANCE
Terrance & Phillip will be right back...
PHILLIP:
...after these messages. [toilet water erupts from the toilet and blows them off camera]
[Cut to Cartman's living room]
STAN
When are they gonna make new ones?
ANNOUNCER 3
[On TV, "HEY KIDS!!," white on green, appears and gets bigger, then dances on a blinking background] Hey kids, don't miss the greatest event of the year! This Thursday night at the Denver Coliseum, see Terrance and Phillip LIVE! And in person! ["Terrance and Phillip LIVE! And in person" appears, then Terrance and Phillip flank the text on either side]
STAN
What's this?
ANNOUNCER 3
[scenes from various episodes appear] One night and one night only, see all your favorite Terrance and Phillip bits live! [Kenny starts babbling incoherently]
KYLE
Oh my God!
CARTMAN
[running in circles] You guys! Hey you guys! You guys!
STAN
Enough! I know!
ANNOUNCER
To order tickets, call TicketSlave NOW!! [a crawl at the bottom of the screen, black on red, reads "CALL NOW! 555-TIXS"]
KYLE
Write the number down! Write the number down!!
[South Park Elementary, day. Class is ready to start, the kids are in their seats. Kyle rushes to his seat]
STAN
Dude! Did you get 'em?
KYLE
I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning!
CARTMAN
Awesome! Give me mine! [Kyle gives them out]
BUTTERS
Wow, yuh-you guys ore gonna see Terrance and Phillip Live?
STAN
Yep. Tomorrow night.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[enters and goes before the chalkboard] Alright, children, let's settle down. As you know, this coming Friday is Earth Day. [writes it on the board] and I'm pleased to announce that the national Earth Day organization has chosen South Park as its location for the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival.
CLASS
Oohh.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
The heads of the Earth Day Brainwashing organization are here to tell you all about it. [moves aside for the heads. Two men and a woman come in, each of them sporting a bow on the left lapel.]
OLDER MAN
Hello children, I know you're all very excited about having the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival put on in your town.
YOUNGER MAN
[slowly waves his left forearm in a broad arc, to the left, palm out] You care very much about the earth, don't you?
CLASS
Yes.
OLDER MAN
Good, because it's up to all of you to get lots of people to come.and make it look great. The festival is on Friday, so we'll start getting it ready tomorrow night. [the boys stir and the camera closes in]
KYLE
What??
YOUNGER MAN
We've all gotta pitch in.
STAN
Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night.
CARTMAN, KYLE, KENNY
Yeah.
OLDER MAN
You... what??
KYLE
Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.
OLDER MAN
And Terrance and Phillip are more important than Mother Earth?
CARTMAN
Well yeah, dude.
OLDER MAN
[slowly waves his left forearm in a broad arc, to the left, palm out] You don't care about Terrance and Phillip. [the boys stare back] Nothing matters more than saving the planet from Republicans. [draws close and repeats the arm movement] You don't need to see Terrance and Phillip.
STAN
No, dude, we really, really do.
OLDER MAN
[to the woman at his left, whispers] Their will is strong.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
I'm sorry, boys, but nothing's more important than Earth Day.
KYLE
[fielding] Uhuh, but that's why we're going.
STAN
Huh?
KYLE
See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival.
YOUNGER MAN
You can get Terrance and Phillip to perform? [to the older man] That would be great. Terrance and Phillip would draw huge ratings from children all over the country.
OLDER MAN
Very well, kids; we'll work on getting the event ready here, and you go get Terrance and Phillip.
THE BOYS
All right!
OLDER MAN
[ominously] But I warn you: You'd better not promise things to Earth Day people that you can't deliver. Earth Day people can be... eheheh very unforgiving.
KYLE
[the boys look sufficiently scared] Heheh, heh, no problem, heh. No problem!
[Denver Coliseum, the following night. The place is packed and music plays in the background. The boys all sport their Terrance and Phillip shirts, as do some other kids.]
ANNOUNCER
Ladies and gentlemen! [the kids cheer and hoot. Spotlights wash over the audience, their beams moving around aimlessly] Put your hands together for... Terrance! [only one spotlight remains on, illuminating the mic, and the music cuts off]
TERRANCE
[approaches the mic from behind the curtains] Hellooo, Den-ver! [the roar of the audience fades quickly as they see only Terrance there, and he's not quite himself. A smattering of applause follows]
KYLE
Wow, dude, Terrance got really fat.
STAN
Yeah, he looks terrible.
TERRANCE
How are we all feeling tonight? Pretty good? Uh oh. [Terrance farts and the audience claps awkwardly] Hey, do you all remember this one? "Doctor, doctor. I think I cracked my ass." "Reallih? Let me take a look." "Look closer." [farts, and laughs]
STAN
Uuuuhh.
CARTMAN
Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip!
CARTMAN, KYLE
Phil-lip!
AUDIENCE
Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Phil-lip!
TERRANCE
["Phil-lip! Phil-lip!"] And now, for some classic Terrance and Phillip comedy! [the crowd cheers and music plays a bit]
PHILLIP STAND-IN
Hello Terrance.
TERRANCE
Hello Phillip.
STAN
Phillip? That's not Phillip.
TERRANCE
Say, Phillip, I have a question for you.
PHILLIP STAND-IN
Ho-okay, shoot. [bends down to receive the fart. Terrance bends over and farts on "Phillip's" face. They both laugh]
KYLE
Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?
CARTMAN
I think this new guy's funny.
TERRANCE
And now here's a classic Terrance and Phillip sketch that I wrote back in '62. [he and his partner pull out top hats]
PHILLIP STAND-IN
Excuse me, sir. Do you know Who farted?
TERRANCE
He sure did.
PHILLIP STAND-IN
What's the person's name?
TERRANCE
Who.
PHILLIP STAND-IN
The guy that farted!
TERRANCE
Who!
PHILLIP STAND-IN
The person that passed gas!
TERRANCE
Who passed gas!
PHILLIP STAND-IN
Now, why are you asking me?
TERRANCE
That's the man's name?
PHILLIP STAND-IN
That's Who's name?
TERRANCE
Yes!
PHILLIP STAND-IN
Something very terrible has happened in the world of Terrance and Phillip, and we've got to find out what.
PHILLIP STAND-IN
Look, buddy, all I'm trying to find out is What's the guy's name that farted?
TERRANCE
Right, the guy that drank his own urine.
PHILLIP STAND-IN
Who?
[Denver Coliseum, later. Stan and his friends walk down the corridors backstage, heading to Terrance's dressing room]
STAN
Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this. [they reach the dressing room, but a bouncer stands in the way] 'Scuse us.
BOUNCER
Where do you think you're going?
KYLE
We have to talk to Terrance.
BOUNCER
Hyeah, right.
STAN
It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club.
BOUNCER
Then get in the "Official Presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club" line. [points to the line, which has a lot more kids waiting to see Terrance. The boys turn to see...]
CARTMAN
Aw, dude, gay!
STAN
You don't understand! We saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once.
BOUNCER
You and about a thousand other people at one time or another. Now, get out of my face! [the boys head for the end of the line]
CARTMAN
Racist! [a boy wearing glasses watches the foursome approach. The boys fall in]
STAN
Man, this sucks!
BOY IN GLASSES
[quite timidly] Are you guys official presidents, too?
CARTMAN
Don't talk to us, kid.
KYLE
Hey! Look at that line! [a post next to it reads "FEMALE GROUPIES AND OTHER RANDOM SLUTS" An obese woman stands last in line] It's way shorter.
STAN
I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.
CARTMAN
Kenny's a random slut. [a look of anger flashes across Kenny's face]
KYLE
Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on. [moves to the other line. His friends follow.] Sshh. [stretches the fat woman's pants enough so that all four of them climb in and disappear under her fat]
[Terrance's dressing room. He and a groupie are making out on the sofa, both moaning.]
TERRANCE
Mmm. Mmm, yummy. [spanks her twice] Mmm. [they separate a bit]
GROUPIE
It was so great meeting you. I feel like we really shared something.
TERRANCE
We sure did, baby. [stands her up quickly and she looks back, disappointed in his reaction] Next? [the obese woman comes in happily]
OBESE WOMAN
[voice trembling] Hello Terrance. I'm such a huuuge fan.
TERRANCE
You're a huge fan alright!
OBESE WOMAN
Can I just have you sign my breasts?
TERRANCE
But what do I get in return?
OBESE WOMAN
Whatever you want. [starts making out with him]
TERRANCE
Oh yeah. [lays down on the sofa, under her] Oh, that's good, baby.
OBESE WOMAN
Oh, Terrance, I love you.
TERRANCE
You like that? [the woman unzips his pants, then her own]
OBESE WOMAN
I love you! [coitus ensues]
TERRANCE
Yeah.
OBESE WOMAN
I LOVE you!
TERRANCE
Ah good.
OBESE WOMAN
I LOVE YOU!!
TERRANCE
Yeah-
BOTH
[reaching climax] OH!!! [Cartman leaps out the back of the woman's pants]
CARTMAN
Agh! Wough! Man, it smells down there! [Terrance and the woman stand up]
TERRANCE
Jesus Christ! That was fast! Well, what should we name it? How about Jerry?
OBESE WOMAN
What the hell? [the other three boys climb out]
TERRANCE
Oh wow! We had quadruplets! [the woman throws up her arms and runs out screaming]
STAN
We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here.
TERRANCE
Oh! Thank God. The last thing I need is more kids. [gets a pen and paper] What do you want, an autograph or something?
KYLE
Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform.
TERRANCE
Earth Day, huh? That sounds like a very noble cause. How much does it pay?
STAN
But where's Phillip?
TERRANCE
[crosses his arms and looks mad] Who?
KYLE
Phillip, your partner.
TERRANCE
Why is it that every time somebody sees me they have to say, "Hey, where's Phillip?" Like we're freaking married or something! You know, I'll let you tater-tots in on a little secret: Phillip is a HACK! [shot of the boys listening] You know who wrote all the Terrance and Phillip stuff? ME! Phillip never did anything but read his lines!
KYLE
But the guy who replaced him sucks!
TERRANCE
Ah, I know. [sulks away from the sofa] I know he sucks [walks to his dresser and mirror. The boys are seen in the reflection] To be honest, things haven't been going so well lately. I'm not making any money because everyone wants to see Phillip. Why? What the hell does Phillip do?
STAN
Because, dude, it's Terrance and Phillip.
TERRANCE
Ogh, whatever. [turns around to face the boys] The point is, Phillip and I are through. [wistfully] And apparently, so is the act. And so is the money.
STAN
What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us?
TERRANCE
HA! Goood luck getting Phillip! He left because he wanted to do [does a quote with his index and middle fingers from both hands] "more serious" stuff. Last I heard, he was doing Canadian Shakespeare in Toronto.
KENNY
(Toronto?)
KYLE
[pleading] But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.
TERRANCE
Well, in that case, I'd say you four boys are up Fart Creek without a paddle. [the boys look at each other in dismay]
["South Park: Home of Earth Day Celebration 2001," day. Booths are being set up for the festival. The heads of the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival make their rounds]
OLDER MAN
[through a bullhorn] Work! Work, children! We only have two more days until Earth Day! Work!
CLYDE
Ah, excuse me? My daddy is a geologist and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming.
OLDER MAN
That's not true. [waves his right forearm slowly to the right, palm out] Global warming is going to kill us all. [repeats the arm movement] The Republicans are responsible.
CLYDE
Thank you. [turns and returns to work. Stan and friends come in from the other direction and stop at a sign announcing Terrance and Phillip: "TERRANCE & PHILLIP As Promised By KYLE AND HIS FRIENDS"]
STAN
Oh no, dude.
OLDER MAN
[arriving with his assistants] Oh, there you are, boys. I need Terrance and Phillip's information so I can tell them their schedule.
KYLE
Uuuh, we didn't get them.
OLDER MAN
[gravely] You what?
STAN
They're not together anymore, dude.
YOUNGER MAN
You'd better be joking. We've already announced their participation.
KYLE
Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy.
OLDER MAN
You promised us Terrance and Phillip! We therefore promised the WORLD Terrance and Phillip! You WILL get us Terrance and Phillip, or else!
STAN
But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.
OLDER MAN
Then you'd better get your asses to Canada and GET him. We'll make travel arrangements. [the three of them start to move away] Nothing is more important than the environment, boys. Not even your lives. [leaves]
KYLE
Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada.
CARTMAN
Weak.
PHILLIP
Ahhh [leaps on his rival, and both lose their swords. The two scuffle on the floor for a few seconds. Phillip's rival fends him off, but Phillip picks up the rival's sword and wounds him with it. We soon learn this is Act 5, Scene 2 of the play, the finale. And so...]
KING CLAUDIUS
Part them; they are incensed.
HAMLET
[Phillip] Nay, come, again.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Aaaah! [falls]
OSRIC
[steps forth.] Look to the queen there, buddih! [Hamlet looks over his left shoulder]
HORATIO
They bleed on both sides. [Hamlet goes to check on the Queen] How is it, my lord?
OSRIC
How is't, Laertes?
LAERTES
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
HAMLET
How does the queen?
KING CLAUDIUS
Hey guy, she swounds to see them bleed, buddih. [in the audience Stan and Kyle sigh deeply and Kenny plays with a toy plane, Cartman is asleep]
QUEEN GERTRUDE
No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--The drink, the drink! I am poison'd. Blagh! [dies]
HAMLET
O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:Treachery! Seek it out.
LAERTES
[genuflects next to the poisoned sword] It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain; No medicine in the world can do thee good; In thee there is not half an hour of life; The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, unbated and envenom'd: the foul practice hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd: I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.
HAMLET
[picks up the poisoned sword] The point!--envenom'd too! Then, venom, to thy work, buddih! [Stabs King Claudius]
ALL
Treason! treason!
KING CLAUDIUS
O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.
HAMLET
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, drink off this potion. Is thy union here? Follow my mother.
KING CLAUDIUS
Blagh! [dies]
LAERTES
He is served;It is a poison temper'd by himself.Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me. Blagh! [dies]
HAMLET
Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee, guy. I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu! You that look pale and tremble at this chance, buddih, That are but mutes or audience to this act, [chuckles] Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death, Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you, buddih--But let it be. Horatio, I am dead; Thou livest, guy; report me and my cause aright, to the unsatisfied. [chuckles]
HORATIO
Never believe it: I am more an antique Roman than a Dane: Here's yet some liquor left, buddih.
STAN
Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end? [Kenny continues playing with his plane]
HAMLET
...he has my dying voice;So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,Which have solicited. The rest is silence. Blagh. [dies]
HORATIO
Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest, buddih!...
[The parking lot. The play has ended. Phillip reaches his car with square tires. Stan and the boys chase him down]
STAN
[reaching Phillip] Phillip! Phillip!
PHILLIP
Yes?
STAN
Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.
PHILLIP
Oh, really? This run of Hamlet is closing down, I'm afraid. We could take it there.
STAN
[stammering] Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and-
PHILLIP
AH! Stop right there! I'm not doin' nothin' with that fatass egomaniac!
STAN
But we need you!
PHILLIP
Ah, I'm sick of him taking credit for all the work and not letting me change the act. It's old and stale! I mean, do you really think that fart jokes are funny for that long? [farts and laughs despite himself]
CARTMAN
Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents!
PHILLIP
Yeah, whatever, kid.
STAN
He'll do it, dude.
KYLE
Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side.
PHILLIP
What?
THE OTHER BOYS
What?
KYLE
They told us that "Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get him for Earth Day."
PHILLIP
Really? Well that sounds interesting. How much does it pay?
STAN
Two thousand dollars.
PHILLIP
[opens the driver-side door] I'm in! Here, call me at this number with the details. [hands Stan a business card] Gotta run! [peels away]
STAN
Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there.
KYLE
I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.
CARTMAN
Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies.
KYLE
[silent for a bit, then] Ih-it'll be okay.
[South Park, day. The kids put finishing touches on the various booths. The heads of the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival make their rounds again]
OLDER MAN
[through a bullhorn] Work faster! Faster, children! Earth Day is coming! [they approach and ascend a stage set up for Terrance and Phillip. Stan and friends are already there, waiting] Well, boys, it's rehearsal time, and your Terrance and Phillip haven't shown up.
KYLE
They said they'd come.
STAN
I'm sure they'll be here any minute.
OLDER MAN
[moves to stand behind the boys with his assistants flanking him] Maybe you kids don't understand how important Earth Day is for the future of our planet. Maybe you need some convincing. Carl? [the younger man, now known as Carl, takes an Earth Day meat cleaver and chops off Kenny's left hand]
KENNY
(AAAAHH!)
STAN
Oh my God!
PHILLIP
[arriving] Excuse me, is this where the Earth Day crap is happening?
KYLE
He's here! [Stan and Cartman smile]
OLDER MAN
Oh. Very good. Mr. Phillip, I am Jack Farliss, head of the Earth Day Committee. Thank you for being part of this important event.
PHILLIP
Whatever. Where's my check? [Terrance enters from the other side of the stage.]
TERRANCE
Alright, I'm here. Where do I-?
PHILLIP
[angrily] What's HE doing here?
JACK
Alright, let's do a rehearsal so that the camera crew can get a look at it. [a zoom-out shows Terrance and Phillip facing away from each other]
KYLE
Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again?
STAN
Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. But let's rehearse first.
PHILLIP
So, this is your dong, huh, Terrance?!
TERRANCE
My doing?? These kids called me and said it was your idea and that you wanted to apologize.
KYLE
Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day. [moves his left forearm, palm out, from right to left] You care about Mother Earth, don't you?
PHILLIP
Well, what the hell? I already flew all the way out here. But I want my check made out to me, not both of us!
TERRANCE
Ditto!
STAN
Fine! [the boys leave the stage]
KYLE
See? I told you it would work. [the boys take their places before the committee]
JACK
Alright, we'll come off the speech about the dying whales, and thennn, action!
TERRANCE
Doctor, doctor, I've cracked my ass.
PHILLIP
Really? Let me take a look.
TERRANCE
Look closer. [poots]
KYLE.
[encouraging, claps] Haha, hahahaha. Hahaha.
PHILLIP
Yon fart doth smell of elderberry sweet. Thou dost protes-
TERRANCE
[interrupts] Uh. What? That's not the line, asshole!
PHILLIP
You're right. It's a better one, asshole!
TERRANCE
Just do the bit right, dickface!
PHILLIP
Why don't you go eat some more pudding, you fatass drug addict?!
TERRANCE
I may be fat but at least I didn't get hair plugs!
PHILLIP
That's it! I ain't doin' nothin' with Kuko the Whale!
TERRANCE
I never needed you in the first place, yuh hack! [moves off the stage, left]
KYLE
You can't leave! The show starts soon!
JACK
Boys, you've got... three hours to get those two back together. Do I need to remind you what will happen if you don't? Carl! [Carl pulls out the cleaver again and chops off Kenny's right hand.]
KENNY
(OOOWWW!)
KYLE
You bastards!
JACK
Good luck, boys. [He, Carl, and the woman walk away. The boys move towards Kenny]
CARTMAN
We've got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to us.
[South Park, later. Media has come in to cover the event: "Terrance & Phillip Earth Day Brainwashing Festival"]
REPORTER
[a woman on stage sings and plays a guitar] Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where Earth Day 2001 is in full force. [one shot of the booths] Environmental awareness games, booths, and of course, [a shot of more booths] the entertainment on stage, which is being broadcast live all over the country. This eco-happy crowd is thrilled and waiting in anticipation for the arrival of Terrance and Phillip, who are promised by these four boys. [an inset of the boys appears over the reporter's left shoulder]
JACK
[takes the mic as the singer leaves] What a touching and true song. You know, it's true. [sweeps his left forearm, palmout, from right to left] Republicans are ruining the earth.
CROWD
[repeating] Republicans are ruining the earth.
JACK
Alright. Well, I think I know why most of you tuned in today. How about some Earth Day entertainment?! [the crowd cheers and claps. Jack gives the mic to Kyle and walks off. Stan has left the stage]
KYLE
Hooray for the earth! We must protect it. [the crowd nose dies down] And now, as promised, here are TERRANCE AND PHILLIP, on video! [Stan hands a tape to a camera man, who puts it into a VCR and starts it.]
CARL
On video? [the curtains part on stage, revealing "EARTH DAY 2001"]
NARRATOR
They were considered the best comedy act in all of Canada. [a shot of the duo, then another of them with Tony Orlando and Dawn] But a fast-paced rocket ride to success would bring them to the depths of despair. [a shot of Terrance, slumped over his couch, then of the show's logo, with vigorous music] This is Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow.
CROWD
Wow!
CARL
[approaching the boys] What the hell do you call this?! [Jack and the woman show up]
KYLE
Eh it's "Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow." I taped it last month.
JACK
We promised people Terrance and Phillip, not a video documentary! You've ruined the earth for the last time, boys! [Carl wields the cleaver one more time, and it reads "Earth Day Cleaver 2001." The boys make a run for it]
THE BOYS
Aaaahh! [they run behind the crowd as the committee pursues them]
NARRATOR
[the show resumes] Terrance was born Terrance Henry Stoot, in the small Canadian village of Toronto. [shown with his parents. Mom is a Mountie, Dad seems to be a lumberjack] At a very early age his parents noticed an uncanny musical ability and decided to enroll him in the Canadian School for gifted babies. [a shot of Terrance playing a xylophone, then of the school building, then of Terrance in a class picture with other toddlers] It was here that he partnered up with Phillip Niles Argyle [soon highlighted], a brash young baby from Montreal. [a shot of a poster announcing their next performance] Together, they performed musical acts that stunned Canadians everywhere. [stock footage of Las Vegas in the 1960s] At the tender age of six, Terrance and Phillip were off to the United States to perform on the Ed Sullivan show [stock footage of the building the show was filmed at]. where American audiences would be exposed to Canadians for the first time.
ED SULLIVAN
[arms folded over his chest] And now, ladies and gentlemen, we have two adorable little boys from Canada. Please put your hands together for the music of young Terrance and Phillip. [fanfare, audience claps as the two boys are shown in Canadian Mountie dress. They begin their song and dance]
TERRANCE & PHILLIP
Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!
WOMAN
Oh my God, what's wrong with their heads?!
MAN
It's alright, darling, they're just Canadian.
WOMAN
Oooh.
TERRANCE & PHILLIP
Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!
NARRATOR
The Canadian act confused American audiences. [one person claps. Ed looks disappointed] But then something happened that would change Terrance and Phillip's act forever. [Phillip farts. A man and woman laugh, and soon the audience joins in. Ed claps joyfully as well. The crowd is soon roaring with cheers and then Terrance farts in return. More laughter and cheers] It was the birth of Canadian comedy. [a shot of Terrance and Phillip using their fart routine in their music act, a shot of them with President Gerald Ford] Terrance and Phillip spent the next several years perfecting their art, and meeting some of America's most influential people. [a shot of the audience looking at the video, from the back of the audience]
PHILLIP
[approaches Mr. Garrison] Excuse me, which way is the bus station? [still mad, carries a suitcase]
MR. GARRISON
Hey, you're the guy on the screen. [points to the stage]
PHILLIP
What? [looks at the screen]
NARRATOR
But it was in 1974, on the Sonny & Cher Show, that Terrance and Phillip finally started to mix their Canadian humor with deep political insight. [splashy shots of the Sonny & Cher Show]
SONNY
You know, Cher, a lot of us real Americans don't know much about Canada.
CHER
[garbled somewhat] Well, a lot of us real Americans aren't as stupid and short as you, hm. [the audience laughs]
SONNY
Please put your groovy hands together for the young and talented Terrance and Phillip! [applause and music as the duo come on]
PHILLIP
Say, Terrance, I'm getting worried aboot all these Russians making missiles. Maybe we should stop this cold war.
TERRANCE
Here's a missile for ya! [farts in his direction, and they both laugh. The audience laughs along]
PHILLIP
That's better. [farts on Terrance's face, and they both laugh, and the audience joins in. Terrance farts on Phillip's face and they both laugh. The audience laughs some more. Terrance farts on Cher and Phillip farts on Sonny]
NARRATOR
With this bold mix of humor and political insight, the world couldn't get enough of Terrance and Phillip. [the shot of Terrance and Phillip with Tony Orlando and Dawn] But their fame would come at a price, when Behind the Blow continues.
[South Park Elementary, front. The boys stop there to catch their breaths]
STAN
[panting] Okay. Okay, I think we lost them.
KYLE
Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around!
CARTMAN
Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie!
KYLE
I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy!
STAN
Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason.
CARL
[off-screen] There they are! [the boys react and are off running]
KYLE
Haaah! [Carl chops off Kenny's left leg to the knee]
KENNY
(Aahhh!)
STAN
Go! Run run run! [Kyle wails, Kenny keeps up somehow]
[South Park stage. Behind The Blow continues]
NARRATOR
[a shot of Terrance and Phillip with three Playboy Bunnies] As they entered their late teens, Terrance and Phillip were already starting to taste the sweet milk of success. [a shot of Terrance and Phillip propped up as scarecrows out on a field] But the price of fame was looming, as Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow continues. [a shot of Johnny Carson laughing it up with Terrance and Phillip] The '70s and '80s were a good time for young Terrance and Phillip. [a shot of the Donny and Marie Show with Terrance and Phillip cavorting in the background] Their act on the Donny and Marie Show earned them a Nobel Peace Prize. They were on the cover of every magazine. [The Times, Teen Heat] And then in 1998, even a Saturday morning cartoon was made, based on Terrance and Phillip. [From episode #102, "Terrance and Phillip and the Land of the Goat People." The camera pans an alien landscape, from a star in the sky to a pair of muscular men in spandex space suits] Terrance and Phillip themselves supplied the voices.
PHILLIP
Say Terrance, what should we do aboot this strange planet we've crashed on?
TERRANCE
I don't know, Phillip. It looks like the alien species here breathe an inert gas.
PHILLIP
Oh oh, did you say what I thought you said? [farts, and they both laugh]
GOAT LEADER
[approaches with his tribe] As leader of the goat people, I have seen my species nearly wiped out by your dangerous gas.
PHILLIP
Wow, that sucks. [he and Terrance laugh. The dialog continues as the narrator speaks]
NARRATOR
The cartoon was such a huge success that it started to breed confusion over whether Terrance and Phillip were animated characters or real people. And so, in 1998, [a shot of them working on a script] the comedy team started work on what they thought would be their greatest achievement: A made-for-TV movie written by and starring Terrance and Phillip, called "Not Without My Anus." [a shot of the duo on the Metro, then the opening logo is shown, then shots of the episode itself] It was their biggest project to date. But it had the misfortune of being scheduled on a night when a different and more popular show, the John Schneider Variety Hour [a shot of John singing], was supposed to air. When fans tuned in to see John Schneider and instead were treated to the Canadian made-for-TV movie [a clip of Terrance and Phillip on the Metro], they were enraged, bewildered, and scared. [a shot of the HBC building in flames] The fans revolted and burned down the network, killing six television producers and wounding twelve others. [a shot of the dead and wounded, another of rioting] The hatred of Terrance and Phillip had begun. Terrance fell into a deep depression and started abusing wood polish. [Terrance sits slumped over his sofa with a small can of polish at his feet] Phillip beat up an angry six-year-old fan and was sued for six million dollars. It was the first time the duo tasted failure [a shot of teen Terrance and Phillip superimposed on a burning HBC building], and it nearly killed them both.
TERRANCE
[moves into view, looking at the video] What's going on here? [he's behind and next to Mr. Mackey]
MR. MACKEY
Sh. We're watching "Behind the Blow," m'kay.
[South Park. The boys run past Tom's Rhinoplasty, with the Earth Day Committee in hot pursuit]
STAN
Come on, Kenny, hurry up!
[South Park stage. Behind The Blow continues. A shot of Mr. Garrison and Phillip]
NARRATOR
[a shot of Terrance on a yellow sofa, drunk and unkempt, attempting to hammer himself to death] After years of depression and suicide attempts, Terrance and Phillip finally decided to get together [another shot of them working on a script] for one last film: [a poster for Asses of Fire is shown, then the camera zooms on on the duo in the car] the 1999 hit, Asses of Fire. It was one of the highest-grossing films of the summer. [shots of the duo singing and dancing in the street, during "Uncle Fucka"] And though the film also started the Canadian-American War of 1999 [shots of the war], in which eight million people lost their lives, the film was considered a great success. [a shot of Terrance and Phillip holding an Oscar] After almost being executed by the American government [a shot of the attempted execution], Terrance and Phillip were eventually returned to Canada [they are shown getting off the plane, with the captain waving at them from behind], where they were touted as heroes. [a shot of Phillip looking at the video] They have been to hell and back, through the very best and the very worst of times, together, but they had seen it through. [a shot of the duo being hoisted above the crowd, Terrance holding a golden cup.] And so ends Terrance and Phillip, Behind the Blow. [the audience cheers and claps. Terrance walks up to Phillip, still with suitcase]
PHILLIP
Terrance...
TERRANCE
Oh, Phillip. You're still here, too.
PHILLIP
I was just watching this video, I ah-. You know, I've never seen it before.
TERRANCE
[pause] Me neither.
PHILLIP
[pause] We sssure did go through a lot together.
TERRANCE
We sure did.
PHILLIP
[drops the suitcase and makes a move] Terrance, I-
TERRANCE
No. No, Phillip, don't say it. I was an asshole, and this is mostly my fault.
PHILLIP
That's what I was gonna say: You were an asshole, and this is mostly your fault. [awkward pause] But, you were always the more artistically driven of us; I ssshould've put more into it than I did. [now dejected]
TERRANCE
No, Phillip, I really thought I did everything. Until I- tried to do it alone. [now dejected. Phillip farts long and soft. A few laughs roll out of Phillip, then out of Terrance, and pretty soon they're laughing it up as they always do. The Earth Day committee approaches the boys, who have made it back to the festival]
JACK
Think of all the endangered species that will now vanish because of you! Carl! [Carl chops off Kenny's right leg with the cleaver]
KENNY
(AH how!) [topples over and away from the committee. Large amounts of blood quickly pour out]
JACK
So long, boys! [he and the other two start to move off]
KYLE
Wait! dude, LOOK! [the audience cheers as Terrance and Phillip take the stage]
TERRANCE
Thank you everyone, thank you! You know, Phillip and I have learned an important lesson: that when you go through a lot with somebody, you can't let trite things come between you.
PHILLIP
That's right, Terrance. You should only let trite things come between your asscheeks [both fart]
TERRANCE
Ohohoho, nohoho! [both of them laugh]
STAN
They're back!
CARTMAN
Alright!
JACK
Yes! Earth Day is saved, boys! Everything worked out after all!
STAN
It sure did.
CARTMAN
[rolling Kenny over so he can see] Look, Kenny, everything turned out okay!
KENNY
(Oh, well now that's sweet.)
PHILLIP
Say Terrance, can you tell me Who farted? [the camera pulls out as the skit continues]
TERRANCE
He sure did, Phillip.
PHILLIP
NO, I'm asking you his name!
NARRATOR
And so, Terrance and Phillip got back together, proving once and for all that fame and fortune are never as important as friendship.
End of Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Cartman inherits a million dollars from his grandmother and fulfills his lifelong dream of owning his own amusement park: Cartmanland!

script:Cartmanland

[A bright, sunny day, with some clouds in the sky. The camera pans down to a funeral scene in a cemetery with robust trees]
PRIEST
...And so it is with heavy hearts that we say good-bye to Mabel Louise Cartman. [a shot of the entire Cartman family, with a few new faces. Cousin Alexandra wears a veil over her face] She was a good woman, a community leader, a caring wife, a providing mother [a shot of Liane, teary-eyed], and a loving grandmother [a shot of Eric checking his watch]
CARTMAN
Mom, it's 3:30. This is taking up my whole Saturday.
LIANE
Ssshhh, pumpkin, it's almost over.
CARTMAN
Why couldn't the funeral have been on a school day?
PRIEST
And now, let us bow our heads in a moment of silence and reflect on how Mabel touched our lives. [all close their eyes]
CARTMAN
[softly] God! She didn't take this long to die.
PRIEST
And now we release the doves to symbolize the Lord taking Mabel into his arms and giving her everlasting peace. [a blonde assistant lifts the cage door cheerfully, then strains to hear some noise. She lifts the cage only to see the dead doves tumble out onto the grass]
ASSISTANT
[serenely] Peace. [music plays and everyone disperses]
CARTMAN
Great. Now can we go?
LIANE
No, sweetie, we have to tend to some of Grandma's business.
CARTMAN
Ogh! God-damnit..!
[The city, day. Johnson's & Associates Law Firm.]
EXECUTOR
[reads will] ..."And so I leave my stocks and bonds, worth an estimate fourteen dollars and twelve cents, to be divided amongst my loving family."
CARTMAN
[impatient, arms crossed] Mom, I wanna go home!
LIANE
In a minute, sweetie. This is important.
EXECUTOR
"To my loving son, Stinky: I leave you the house in Nebraska. Look after it as your father and I did."
CARTMAN
Bluh bluh bluhbluh bluh bluh...
EXECUTOR
"To my grandson Eric: You are always my favorite fat little man, my perfect round little pudding-piler."
CARTMAN
[under his breath] Oh, God, do you have to embarrass me even in death, Grandma?!
EXECUTOR
"For you, Eric, I leave from my life savings, the sum of one million dollars, to be transferred to you immediately."
CARTMAN
[stunned] Hoosajiggawha?
LIANE
A million dollars?
EXECUTOR
"Eric is the primary benefactor of my estate, since it is likely the rest of you would spend the money on crack."
LIANE
Oh my.
UNCLE STINKY
That can't be!
CARTMAN
Uh yah sir, excuse me. D-Does this mean that I..have...one million dollars?
EXECUTOR
Yes, Eric, it's yours.
CARTMAN
No, no, wait, you don't understand. [voice trembles] since I was th-three years old it has been my dream to have one million dollars...
EXECUTOR
And now, you do.
CARTMAN
Egh... [lets out four long screams while his family watches]
[South Park, day. A car with a woman seated in it appears on a hill]
STAN
"There you are, Jennifer Lopez!" [Stan's face appears, and it's instantly clear that the car and Lopez are dolls] "You've been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez."
KYLE
"No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!"
STAN
"It's too late for that, Ms. Lopez." [inserts a small firework next to Lopez in the tiny car]
KYLE
"Have mercy!" [Stan lights the firework. He and Kyle move away. The firework pops and the little car flips over] Yeah ha ha!
STAN
Yeah, awesome!
KENNY
panting(You guys! You guys! You gotta come down to Cartman's house! You hear Cartman got a million dollars from his Grandma!)
STAN
...Why?
KENNY
(Because! His grandmother just died and her will says Cartman now has a million dollars!)
KYLE
Nuh uh.
KENNY
(No, swear to God it's true! Cartman's got a million dollars!)
STAN
You'd better not be lying, Kenny. [the three walk out of view.]
[South Park, the Bank, later. Inside, a banker counts the money out in $100 bills. Mr. Garrison, Principal Victoria, Chef, and others are there.]
BANKER
Nine hundred ninety nine thousand four hundred, nine hundred ninety nine thousand five hundred...
JIMBO
Damn, Ned, I've never seen that much cash.
NED
Mm-me neither.
BANKER
...Nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred, one million. [sets the last bill and moves the stack next to the other stacks.]
CARTMAN
[softly] Look at it. Look at it, mother. See how the light reflects the spearmint green from its surface.
MR. GARRISON
Eric, that is a lot of money. Don't you think you should keep it in the bank instead of at your house?
CARTMAN
I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm spending it.
JIMBO
On what?
CARTMAN
On my dream. [zoom in] On the one thing that I've wanted ever since I could remember...
[South Park, the Bank, outside. Cartman leads the others out of the bank and down the street. The money is in his Radio Flyer wagon]
BROKER
[seen in the crowd, pops up next to Cartman] Excuse me son, I'm an investment broker; I can help you invest that money.
CARTMAN
Nuh uh, I'm spendin' it.
PRIEST MAXI
Eric, God could sure use that money for a bigger church.
CARTMAN
Huh, I think God has plenty of money.
KYLE
What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
CARTMAN
Not much, just taking my [stops the wagon and shows a stack of bill off] one million dollars out of the bank. [the other three boys are stunned]
STAN
Oh my God.
KYLE
Kenny wasn't lying.
CARTMAN
Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make.
STAN
Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket?
CARTMAN
HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloaders are gonna take my hard-earned cash!
KYLE
Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!
CARTMAN
Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch!
KYLE
No... No, this isn't possible.
STAN
Yeah, it's unbelievable.
KYLE
No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars?
STAN
Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money. [walks away, but Kyle stays behind, in doubt]
KYLE
Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?
[North Park Funland, day. Cartman and his mom are in the park office signing papers]
BROKER
...Aaand if we can just get you to sign here... [Cartman signs] and here... [Cartman signs].
LIANE
Are you sure this is what you want, sweetie?
CARTMAN
My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure.
BROKER
And now you just sign here, Mr. Fun. [Mr. Fun holds the pen and thinks a bit... a roller coaster zips by outside the window]
MR. FUN
I can't do it.
BROKER
What?
CARTMAN
What?!
MR. FUN
Uh uh I can't sell this poor kid my park. [Cartman remains stunned] Look, I haven't been honest with you. The park hasn't been doing great business.
BROKER
Frank...
MR. FUN
Sshhhh. It ain't right, Chris. [to Cartman and Liane] The truth is, the park is a financial flop. I haven't turned a profit in years because I can't keep attendance up.
CARTMAN
Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come.
MR. FUN
You... you're not?
CARTMAN
No no! I'm buying it to keep people out! [Chris and Frank look at each other] Don't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks. [zoom in] But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds, [shot of people waiting to enter "The Mine Shaft"] The rides are great, but... [a shot of crowds on Main Street] All the lines, lines, LINES! [shot of people waiting to enter a ghost ride, another shot of a kids' mine shaft ride; another of Cartman pissed off, eyes squeezed shut, with waiting times floating past him] If there's one thing I hate, [a shot of two lines of people entering his head] all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!! [opens his eyes, and a moment later...] And then there get to be so many people [his eyes roll around independently of each other] that they make FastPass. [a shot of people in a FastPass line] So then there's lines for FastPass. [zoom out to show Cartman in line for a FastPass] You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms [two lines for the Waterworks Restrooms], lines for the drinks [Astro Food line], lines for cantakuras [Seussian characters play strange instruments for the people in line] and rare Kartankulas Plinks! [a vendor sells them - they are a fruit treat shaped like strawberries] ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it.
MR. FUN
Nn-oh. Well then, I guess I don't feel bad. [signs the papers]
CHRIS
[the broker] Mr. Cartman, congratulations, the theme park is yours. [slides the documents to Cartman]
CARTMAN
Gentlemen, I thank you.
[South Park Synagogue, night. A main door opens and Stan enters]
STAN
Kyle? [at the front of the synagogue, Kyle sits in the first pew right, and a shaft of moonlight shines down on him from the rose window over the altar. Stan approaches] Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle?
KYLE
[not turning around, voice quivering] Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park.
STAN
Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--
KYLE
[leaves the pew to face Stan, teary-eyed] Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, "You know, I learned something today..." and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense! [to God] What is your logic?! [feels a pang in his ass] Ow. [tends to the pain]
STAN
Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already.
[North Park Funland, day. Cartman is on the Carousel on a white horse, alone]
CARTMAN
[gleefully] Yyeessss! Yyeessss! [next, "Java Jam!!" a Teacup ride. Cartman laughs to himself] Awesome! [continues laughing. Next shot: Cartman in the "Bumper Buggies" bumper cars] Ho ho! [bumps into the car before him] Sweet! [bumps into the car behind him] Yes! [next shot: Cartman announcing at the Mine Shaft Ride] Folks, please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times, make sure your seat belts are fastened, and enjoy the Mine Shaft! [pulls the lever and the cars pull away. Cartman rushes to jump in the first car and buckles in. Outside, the cars go to one end of the ride] Yes! [the cars go to the other end of the ride] Yes! [next shot, goes to "Ride Shots: pictures of your ride"] Oh, cool! [a picture of him on the ride appears on one screen] Oh, look how much fun I had! [next shot: a haunted ride. First, a mummy pops out of a casket to his right] Whoa! Heheheheh. [a skeleton pops out to his right] Ah! Heheh. [a ghost pops on from his left] Whoa! Heh, heheh. [next shot, Cartman on a ferry around an island] Woooo, Adventure Island! Check it out! Awesome! [the island seems to have real animals there, like giraffes, elephants. Next shot, Cartman on a log ride, "The Yeti." He goes down the chute] Yoohoo! Yeh-hehess! [lands in the lake below] Yehess! [comes to the end of the ride, sobs joyfully] I'm so happy! I'm so happy...!
[Stan's house. Kyle enters carrying a padded seat ring]
STAN
[on the sofa] Oh, hey, dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start.
KYLE
Great. [tosses the ring onto the sofa]
STAN
What's that?
KYLE
It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid. [hops onto the ring] Ow.
STAN
Heh, heh. [Kyle glares at him] Sorry.
KYLE
So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!
STAN
Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins.
KYLE
Hunh, I guess you're right.
CARTMAN
[voice, from the TV] Hey, everybody! Check out the all new Cartmanland! It's our Graaand Opening! Cartmanland has over a hundred fabulous rides [Cartman stands next to a Yeti. When the log car comes out, he jumps in and takes off], six roller coasters [one of them is shown], and tons of great surprises! [a haunted tree and the Yeti do their stuff. Cartman is back at the front gate] And the best part is: [zoom in] You can't come!! [Stan and Kyle look confused. Next shot: Cartman on Main Street] That's right, because at Cartmanland, only I, Eric Cartman, can get in! That means only I can ride the all-new Tornado Twister [a shot of the fancy new ride, with Cartman in one of the cars, going through the loops], a roller coaster that splashes in the water! Wow! [an overview of Adventure Island, with Cartman showing it off] It's the greatest amusement park in the Colorado area! And nobody can go!! Especially Stan and Kyle!! HAHA!! [a shot of Cartman landing in a space capsule, with parachute] So come on down to Cartmanland now! [Cartman in the Haunted Mansion ride] But don't plan on getting past the parking lot, [back at the front gate] 'cause remember: [cue music] So much to do at Cartmanland, but you can't come! [cut music] Especially you, Stan and Kyle.
STAN
[hops off the sofa and heads for the door] That does it, dude!
KYLE
Where are we going?
STAN
We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not! [Kyle hops off and takes his seat ring. Both boys leave]
[Cartmanland, Haunted Mansion, night. Cartman is back on the ride.]
CARTMAN
[a mummy pops out of a casket to his right] Whoa! Heheh. [a skeleton pops out to his right] Whoa! [a ghost pops on from his left] Whoa! Heheheheheh. [he exits the ride and ambles back to the road] Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the, um, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh.
KYLE
[in the distance, while Cartman speaks] Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts! [the sound of chain-link is heard] Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!
CARTMAN
[lifts his hand to his ear to hear better] What the hell?
KYLE
Hohohooho! Oowwww!
CARTMAN
You sons of bitches! [goes towards the source of the sound]
[Cartmanland, perimeter fence. Stan is in the park waiting for Kyle to come down, but Kyle is stranded on top of the fence. The view is from the park towards the parking lot.]
STAN
Come on, dude!
KYLE
[bawling] Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!
CARTMAN
[arriving] What the hell are you doing?!
STAN
Aw, crap.
KYLE
Oh God, get me off of here!! [falls off, but outside the park]
STAN
Dude! [rushes out of the park to Kyle]
KYLE
[now standing, rubbing his ass and wailing] Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!!
STAN
Alright, let's go.
CARTMAN
[reaches the scene, but stays inside the park] That's right! You stay out!
STAN
You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better!
KYLE
My life can't get any worse!
STAN
You'll see! We'll get in! [walks off with Kyle as Cartman glares after them.]
[Cartmanland, day. Cartman stands at the front gate with a new employee. The entrances are now barricaded with wooden planks. Two remain open: the middle one and the one at far right.]
CARTMAN
...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight!
SECURITY GUARD
So what does does this job pay?
CARTMAN
Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them.
SECURITY GUARD
Uh, I'm afraid I don't really like rides.
CARTMAN
[looks warily at the guard] But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line.
SECURITY GUARD
I'm not interested.
CARTMAN
Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines.
SECURITY GUARD
If you need security, I need a cash salary.
CARTMAN
But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park.
SECURITY GUARD
Well, look: Why don't you just let a couple of people in each day? Every day you can just let two people in, charge $29.95 per ticket, and then you can use that to pay my daily salary.
CARTMAN
Ugh... Two people?
SECURITY GUARD
This place is huge. You'll never notice two people. And then you'll have security for your park.
CARTMAN
Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park...
SECURITY GUARD
I will shoot on sight.
CARTMAN
Sweet.
[Hells Pass Hospital, day. Kyle is on a gurney, face down. A doctor stands behind him as his parents look on]
DOCTOR
You're a very lucky little boy. I've never seen a hemorrhoid so infected. It could have killed you. [walks away]
KYLE
Lucky. [the operating room doors open and in walks Stan]
GERALD
Oh, look, Kyle. Your little friend Stan is here to see you.
STAN
Dude, are you okay?
KYLE
Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?
STAN
Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in.
SHEILA
Ah-ah-ah-I'm afraid Kyle can't ride any amusement park rides for over a year because of his horrible hemorrhoid.
STAN
Jesus.
KYLE
But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude.
SHEILA
Kyle, don't say such things!
KYLE
Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?
GERALD
Kyle, y-you-you just don't understand. It's--
KYLE
No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God![Stan casts his eyes down] Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!
[Cartmanland, day. Barbed wire has been placed atop every fence imaginable. A crowd of people shows up. Among the people are Butters, Clyde, Jordan, Bebe...]
CARTMAN
[on the bullhorn] Alright, alright, listen up, people. Cartmanland is open, but only to two people each day. [turns it off]
KIDS
Aw.
BOY
That's gay.
CARTMAN
I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in.
BUTTERS
Hoh.
CLYDE
Oh. [Cartman moves a post and the two boys walk out. Cartman places the post back]
CARTMAN
The rest of you will just have to try another day.
KIDS
Aw. [they turn around and walk away. Cartman goes to the ticket booth and opens the window. Butters is waiting]
CARTMAN
'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir. [Butters gives him the money and gets back change, his ticket, and a map of the park] Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.
BUTTERS
Hoh boy, oh boy! [Clyde purchases his ticket]
CARTMAN
...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland. [Clyde leaves] Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can get back to riding my rides. [walks in and dances down Main Street] Dada da, I've got my own theme park. Hm, what should I go on now? I know! I'll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again! [enters the ride and makes his way through the line] Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah- [finds Clyde and Butters waiting for the ride as well. They turn to see him] What are you doing?
BUTTERS
We're waitin' in line for the-ah spook house.
CARTMAN
Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now? [Clyde and Butters lean away from Cartman, a bit afraid]
BUTTERS
Well we wanna see the spook house. Uh well, we paid twenty-nine ninety five; we should be able to go in the spook house. [crosses his arms in disappointment]
CLYDE
Yeah! But I think it's broke down. The cars aren't moving.
CARTMAN
Ugh, alright, alright, hang on. [pulls out a walkie-talkie and speaks into it] Security!
SECURITY GUARD
[arrives talking into his own walkie-talkie] What?
CARTMAN
Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it.
SECURITY GUARD
Uh, I'm security, not maintenance.
CARTMAN
But I don't know how it works.
SECURITY GUARD
Well your rides are gonna break down every now and then. You need to hire a maintenance person.
CARTMAN
Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person.
[Cartmanland, another day. A crowd of people shows up. Among the people are Bebe, Tolkien, Timmy, Kenny, Filmore...]
CARTMAN
[on the bullhorn] Alright folks, we've had another change in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a day. [a shot of the crowd from the front, then one of Cartman] However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks inside the park, so now I've had to hire a beverage person, and a cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! Understood? [everyone nods] Alright, let's go. [unhinges the velvet rope, and in walk Tolkien, Timmy, Filmore and friend, Kenny, two adults, Bebe, and another boy]
TIMMY
Timmay!
CARTMAN
[eyes the new boy and stops him] Wait a minute! Who are you?
BOY
Mike Gainor. [Cartman sees a bandage on the boy's face and rips it off]
CARTMAN
HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!
STAN
Goddamnit Cartman, let me in!
CARTMAN
I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY!
STAN
It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!
CARTMAN
Get him out of here! [Stan looks up in surprise]
SECURITY GUARD
Move along, sir. [sprays the pepper gas on Stan]
STAN
AGGH! [The guard escorts him away] This isn't over, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides! [smiles and walks into the park. Next shot, Cartman in a roller coaster. Next, Cartman on "Plummet from the Summit"] Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared! [reaches the top of the ride, then the car goes into free fall] AAAGGGHHH....
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. A nurse works on Kyle's hemorrhoid with pincers]
KYLE
Agh! [the nurse moves the pincers one way] Agghh! [then another]
NURSE
Just a little more. [one twist more] There we go. [withdraws the pincers. Gerald and Sheila enter Kyle's room with the Bible]
GERALD
Hello, Kyle. How's the hemorrhoid today?
KYLE
[the nurse leaves] Awesome. [Gerald and Sheila take their seats near Kyle]
SHEILA
Kyle, we wanna tell you about the Book of Job. It's a story from the Bible.
KYLE
I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?
GERALD
Oh, I think you'll see differently after hearing this. Sit down, Kyle. [Kyle gets cross, and Gerald corrects himself] Uh, okay. [begins the story. A Middle Eastern scene appears] You see, Job lived in the east of Jordan, a long long time ago. [camera pans across the landscape and rests behind a man in a red robe and long gray hair] Job was a great man. He was blessed with ten lovely children [they come out of a building with their mother], a wonderful wife, and many friends. [his friends show up to join the family behind Job, a proud and happy man]
SHEILA
[a shot of Job petting a bull] He was godly, and a good man, and fed the poor. [Job brings a bag of food to a woman with three kids next to her. One of them, a girl, walks up, and her mother hands her a loaf of bread]
GERALD
He was the most upright and honorable of men, and every day he praised God. [Job falls to his knees in praise, as his shepherds look on]
SHEILA
But one day, Satan went up to Heaven and talked to God.
KYLE
[still mad] Satan talked to God?
SHEILA
Yes, in the Book of Job, Satan talks to God. And God says to Satan, "Have you seen Job? He is a great man, and he praises me every day."
GERALD
But Satan said, "Oh yeah? He only praises you because you gave him so much. If you didn't give him those things, he would curse your name."
SHEILA
To which God said, "Oh yeah? I'll show you, Satan! I'll take those things away from Job and he will still praise my name."
GERALD
And so, God had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter Job's oxen and donkeys, and murder all his workers. [that scene is shown]
SHEILA
Then God sent his fireballs from the sky and killed his sheep and the rest of his employees. [meteorites rain down and destroy the fields and workers there, as well as the sheep]
GERALD
And then, as Job's sons and daughters were eating, God sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all. [the palm trees bend low as the winds pick up, then the two-story house collapses as the palm trees are swept away by the winds, and Job's family dies]
SHEILA
Job was terribly sad, but he fell to his knees and said, "The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away," and praised God's name. [Job falls to his knees and prays to God.]
GERALD
So then, Job got painful sores all over his body. [shown, with the burning fields behind him]
SHEILA
He was in terrible, miserable pain all day, every day. But he still kept his faith. [another shot of Job among the dead, then a close-up of Job with his sores]
GERALD
God said to Satan, "See? I told you. Job still praises me." [all that is heard after that is the sound of the heart monitor attached to Kyle.]
KYLE
[a few seconds later] And that's it? That's the end?
SHEILA
Basically.
KYLE
That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?
GERALD
Oh. Uhhh, I don't know.
KYLE
Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God.
[Cartmanland, day. Yet another crowd of people awaits to get in. Cartman greets them]
CARTMAN
[checking off items on a clipboard] ...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy's salary, so that's three more admissions a day... [the clipboard reads, "Cartmanland Expenses."] Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that's about four admissions - that brings the grand total to... [under his breath] God-damnit! [picks up the bullhorn and says] Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today! [the crowd hoots and hollers and surges forward, engulfing Cartman. The people rush towards the one open ticket booth]
CLERK
Welcome to Cartmanland.
[Hells Pass Hospital, day. The doctor has been in to see Kyle's recovery progress and is now talking to the parents]
SHEILA
Isn't he getting any better, doctor?
DOCTOR
I don't understand it. He's not fighting the infected hemorrhoid at all. It's like he... like he's lost all hope. Well if you'll excuse me, I've got more tests to run. [leaves. The TV monitor is seen, with a picture of a financial program]
ANNOUNCER
And now back to Money Quest, on HBC.
HOST 1
[Camera zooms in on the two hosts] Welcome back to Money Quest. [Kyle looks at the show] In just over two weeks, young financial genius Eric Cartman [his picture appears on the screen behind the hosts] has managed to turn a theme park that was seeing less than a hundred attendees a day into a thriving park with attendance in the thousands.
HOST 2
And the way he did it is with the brilliant "You Can't Come" technique. For the first several days, the young businessman saturated the market with the claim that nobody could get into his park. It made the public crazy. So then, weeks later, when he opened the doors, they were lining up around the block. Simply amazing.
HOST 1
Well, ahah I think we should point out that this technique is already being applied by businesses all over the country.
[At a restaurant where all the tables are empty and everyone is waiting in line...]
WAITRESS
I'm sorry, we're no longer taking reservations. Nobody can eat here. You'll have to leave now.
[At the Bijou, where everyone is waiting outside....]
CLERK
No, I'm sorry. You can't see this movie. Nobody can see this movie. I can't even go in.
[At Gracy's clothing store, a sales associates barks orders...]
ASSOCIATE
[the shoppers rush out of there] Out! Nobody is allowed into Gracy's anymore! Get out of here! [kicks the last shopper out]
[Back to Money Quest...]
HOST 1
Amazing. Eric Cartman is surely the financial genius of our time.
[Back to Kyle's room at Hells Pass Hospital...]
KYLE
Oh... Oohh—Ohuhughughhh... [passes out. A flatline appears on the heart monitor]
SHEILA
[approaches] Kyle? Kyle? [turns to Gerald] Get the doctor!
[Cartmanland, day. Every ride has people on it, and every ride Cartman is on shows a dejected Cartman as the others enjoy themselves. At the Carousel he rides his favorite white horse, but shows no joy in riding it. At Java Jam!!! he's in a purple teacup with three other kids, and is not enjoying it. At Bumper Buggies he's in the #7 bumper car]
CARTMAN
[Bumped from ahead by car #9, Clyde] Eh! [Bumped from ahead by car #4, Kevin] Goddamnit, stop running into me! [at the Mine Shaft Ride he sits in the fist car, but is not enjoying it with all those other kids. Kenny is in the last car]
KENNY
[around one bend] (Woohoo!) [around another] (Heeheehee!!) [he's out of his seat flying with the car, and he gets impaled in the face by a water pipe. It goes along for the ride. Outside, at Ride Shots, the shots from the just-completed ride are shown. Kenny is shown on screen 3 with the pipe buried into his face, which is now unrecognizable. On the steamboat ferry circling Adventure Island Cartman covers his ears and looks around angrily]
CARTMAN
AGH! [he's next in The Yeti log ride with older kids] DAAGGHHHH!!
[Cartmanland, Main Street. The crowds bustle about and business is good. Chris the Broker and Mr. Fun are seen walking down Main Street.]
MR. FUN
My God, look at it, Chris! That kid completely turned this place around!
CHRIS
He sure did!
MR. FUN
Oh, if I could only have a park that worked like this!
CARTMAN
[approaches] Hey, there you are! [The two men see him]
MR. FUN
Oh, hello. Congratulations on your success.
CARTMAN
Just give me my money back.
MR. FUN
What?
CARTMAN
I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park!
MR. FUN
...But it's doing great!
CARTMAN
You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit!
MR. FUN
[Chris smiles at this turn of events] You bet! I'll go get your money right now. [the men leave]
BOY
[walking along] Daddy, daddy, can we ride the rockets?
CARTMAN
GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! [scares the hell out of the boy. The father holds on to the boy]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. The doctor has brought Kyle's vitals back, and Kyle is on oxygen, but he's still unconscious. Gerald and Sheila look on]
GERALD
Isn't he responding at all, doctor?
DOCTOR
[turns around to face them] I'm sorry. Your son appears to be losing the battle. I'm afraid that the hemorrhoid has spread to his lungs. Normally, the body would fight the infection, but he's... he's just... given up on life.
SHEILA
But then... are you saying...?
DOCTOR
There's nothing I can do. Little fella's just... lost his will to live.
SHEILA
[walks up to Kyle] Oh Kyle! Kyle, you've got to fight!
[Cartmanland... ahem, North Park Funland, day. The old North Park Funland sign is being restored, as are many of the rides Cartman replaced. The ticket booths are missing. A bulldozer sits outside the park ready to clear out anything else that needs removal. Cartman exits with the million dollars he originally paid for the park. The money is back on the Radio Flyer]
CARTMAN
Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass! [three men in suits approach Cartman]
AGENT
Excuse me? Eric Cartman?
CARTMAN
[turns to face them] Yeah?
AGENT
I'm Frank Garrett with the IRS. You haven't kept records of your income or payout, and there's a five hundred thousand dollar discrepancy. [to the two other men] Seize the assets. [the men grab the discrepancy]
CARTMAN
He-hey, that's my money!
MR. GARRETT
There's also the lawsuit of the little boy who died in your park. The family's entitled to the rest of this. [takes the wagon with the other half million]
CARTMAN
What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time!
MR. GARRETT
You still owe thirteen thousand dollars more than this, Mr. Cartman. We'll see you in court. [the men walk away with the million]
CARTMAN
Ye-You can't take my money, Goddamnit!
MR. GARRETT
We know how well your park is doing; you'll make it back in no time.
CARTMAN
No! But I don't... ah... ah... [sees Mr. Fun through a fence and rushes to talk to him] Hey! Hey Mr. Fun, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back.
MR. FUN
Nohoho way, José!
CARTMAN
But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park, I lose everything!
MR. FUN
"I don't care," said Pierre. "I'm from France." [turns around and disappears into the crowd]
CARTMAN
This can't be happening! AGGGHH!!
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Stan bursts into Kyle's room]
STAN
Kyle, you gotta see!! [the doctor looks at him. Sheila and Gerald turn around]
SHEILA
[sadly] Kyle's not going to make it, Stanley. Oh, Gerald! [weeps into Gerald's chest]
STAN
Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached?
DOCTOR
Well, I s-supposed it could be rigged, but I--
STAN
Then damnit man, do it!
[North Park Funland, day. The ticket booths are back, and business is as strong now as it was when the park was Cartmanland. Off to the side, Cartman is throwing stones at one of the park walls]
CARTMAN
It isn't fair! [throws another stone] You goddamned assholes, it isn't fair! [throws another. Stan arrives with the doctor, the nurse, Kyle, and Kyle's parents]
STAN
Look, Kyle. Look. [smiles]
KYLE
[opens his eyes] Huh?
CARTMAN
You just build me up to chop me down, didn't you?! What about my dream?! What about my money?! [throws another stone]
KYLE
[more alert] Huh?
CARTMAN
I'M SO PISSED OFF! [the security guard arrives, ready to spray Cartman]
SECURITY GUARD
Move along, sir! You are vandalizing private property!
CARTMAN
Ey! You used to work for me! [the guard sprays Cartman in the face] Ut ut aw! Aw, Goddamnit, you sonofabitch! [coughs and wheezes. Stan grins and Kyle's vital stats get stronger. Kyle sighs]
STAN
Kyle!
DOCTOR
He's coming back.
SHEILA
That's it, baby. That's it.
CARTMAN
Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks!
DOCTOR
Wait a minute. Yes! The hemorrhoid is going into remission!
HEMORRHOID
[receding into the colon] Oh, shit!
STAN
Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable. [a shot of Cartman on his knees, sobbing] Even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it.
CARTMAN
It's not fair! It's not fair; I wanna die! I wanna daaahahie! [Kyle looks at Cartman, then up at the sky, then sits up and removes the oxygen mask]
KYLE
You are up there! [smiles]
End of Cartmanland

synopsis:In a time-honored tradition and right-of-passage, the boys are separated from the girls and schooled in the mysteries of sex by none other than Mr. Mackey.

script:Proper Condom Use

[South Park, day. A car with a woman seated in it appears on a hill — Jennifer Lopez doll with car, and some damage from the firecracker last time.]
STAN
[voice only] "So, we meet again, Jennifer Lopez!"
KYLE
[face appears] "No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies."
STAN
[face appears] "That's what you said last time [pulls out a magnifying glass from his back pocket], but obviously we must now resort to more drastic measures" [moves the magnifying glass over the doll's body and fixes it there, focusing the sun's rays into a point]
KYLE
[fakes a cry] "Oh God it burns! It bur-huhurns!"
STAN
"Scream for me, bitch!"
KYLE
"AAAAAAAH!" [the doll's head begins to melt and shrivel, then Stan removes the magnifying glass]
STAN, KYLE
Whoa! Awesome!
CARTMAN
[runs up excitedly] Ey you guys! You guys! Come 'ere, you guys, come check this out!
STAN
Oh no, what now?
CARTMAN
No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on! [goes away, and Stan and Kyle follow]
[Kenny's house, later. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle approach the house. Kenny's on the front lawn with a dog, and the other boys join him]
KYLE
What's this all about, Kenny?
KENNY
(Wait until you see what I can do to the dog!)
CARTMAN
Watch this. It's sooo funny. [grins] Come 'ere, Garland, come on. [giggles as he starts jacking the dog's penis] Good dog. [the dog rolls over on its back ] Red rocket red rocket. [Stan and Kyle look at each other. Kenny starts to laugh and clap, and the dog's penis lengthens] Red rocket. Red rocket. [chuckles] Come on. [giggles]
STAN
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
CARTMAN
I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.
KYLE
No they don't!
KENNY
(Yeah they do!)
CARTMAN
[continues milking] Yeah, just hold on a minute. The fifth graders showed us how to do it. [concentrates on the dog] Red rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket! [the dogs ejaculates, and the semen lands on Cartman's face] Ohooohhh!
STAN
Whoa, cool! [the dog quickly stands up and walks off]
KYLE
That's awesome!
CARTMAN
I told you guys.
STAN
I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.
CARTMAN
[sighs] Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn't work if you beat off the dog again right away.
KYLE
You "beat off?"
CARTMAN
[rolls his eyes up] That's what it's called when you milk a dog: beating it off. [looks at Kenny] Don't you guys know anything?
STAN
Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?
CARTMAN
Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it—hey come here, dog. Dog, come here! [laughs as a gray dog approaches]
[Stan's house, night. Sharon is holding court in the living room, in a circle of chairs. She and Randy have parents of the Stotch, Tweak, Black and Tucker families over for some discussion...]
SHARON
I was really happy with this month's book. I agree with what Bob and Linda said-
STAN
[rushes in with Sparky] Mom! Dad! You gotta see this!
SHARON
Not now, Stanley. This is Mommy and Daddy's book club night, remember?
STAN
But it's super-cool!
SHARON
Later, sweetie. [to the group] Anyway, I found myself enticed by Steinbeck's imagery.
STEPHEN
Uh the first chapter alone was filled with poetry.
SHARON
[Stan takes the dog and sets up near the table, away from the club circle] Oh, wasn't it? I mean, the first sentence: [reads from "Cannery Row." Stan starts milking the dog]
STAN
Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky. Red rocket.
SHARON
"Cannery Row in Monterey in California-" ["Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky. Red rocket."] "-is a poem, a stink, a grating noise..." [The other adults lean in to see the action in the background. "Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky."] It's amazing how with three images [Mrs. Tweek covers her mouth as Mr. Tweek looks on, surprised] he puts you right there, and...
STAN
[his parents turn at the sound of his voice] Red rocket, red rocket!
RANDY
[recognizes the activity] WAAAH!
SHARON
Stanley, what the hell are you doing?!
STAN
I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket. [the other adults turn away or show shocked looks]
SHARON
[both parents now standing] STANLEY, YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW!
STAN
My room? Why?
SHARON
Go, Stanley! [he walks off to his room. Sparky looks at the group, then gets up and follows Stan out, with penis still erect. Sharon turns around and says sheepishly] Ahaha, ahem. Heheh, he, he gets very good grades.
[Stan's house, later. His parents have entered his room, quite upset at his behavior earlier. Stan rests his head on his hands.]
SHARON
Stanley, do you know why you're being grounded for ten months?
STAN
No!
RANDY
Beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company! [Sharon glances at him] Ah I mean, ever! Beating off the dog is not appropriate ever!
STAN
Why?! What's the big deal?!
SHARON
Stanley, don't you understand what you are doing??
STAN
I was doing "red rocket" to make the dog's milk come out.
RANDY
No, Stan! What you were doing to the dog was-ss sexual.
STAN
Huh??
SHARON
You were stimulating the dog, Stanley! What came out of him was his... r-Randy?!
RANDY
Well, you know, when you do that to a m-male... the... eh eh you make his... stuff come out. [Stan looks confused] Well, Jesus, haven't they taught you these things at school?!
STAN
What things??
SHARON
Sexual education. Haven't you learned that yet?
STAN
No!
SHARON
Oh. Look, well, you see, Stanley,... Well, your school should be teaching this stuff!
RANDY
Yeah! Let's get that damned school on the phone! [walks out the door. Sharon follows him out. Stan looks ahead blankly]
[South Park PTA meeting, night. The parents are there, clamoring and arguing.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Okay, parents. I know a lot of you want a chance to speak, but we have to talk one at a time.
SHARON
[stands] Look, our kids are learning sexual things on the street and on television. There's no way we can stop it. The schools have to teach them sexual education at a younger age.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
School policy has been to teach sexual education later. In the fifth grade.
MR. TWEEK
It isn't soon enough.
STUART
Yeah. Why, just this afternoon our son was caught beatin' off our dog. [Randy and Sharon look at each other in recognition of the act]
CHEF
Look, parents. Do you really want your children learning about sex? Part of the fun of being a kid is being naive! Let them be kids for a while.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Naive at what cost, Chef? Parents, we have to face facts: Children in America are having sex at younger and younger ages. STDs are affecting younger and younger kids all the time. The only way we can combat that is by educating children before they have sex.
CHEF
The first thing that kids learn about sex shouldn't be some bitch-scare tactic about STDs.
SHEILA
[rising] No, she's right! With all the teen pregnancies that are out today, I think my boy does need to know about sexual education. [sits, then rises again] From the school.
ADULTS
Yeah. Uh huh. Yeah, we have to.
[South Park Elementary, day. "Fourth Grade B" is shown on a classroom door. Sixteen boys are present.]
MR. MACKEY
Okay, boys, this is the first day of sexual education, m'kay? Now, I know that some of you think this is very funny. Words like "penis" and "vagina." [Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman stifle some giggles] Nuh- now STOP that, m'kay! We're goin' tuh get through this by being mature and grown up, m'kay. [turns and goes over to turn off the light, and turn on the projector with a remote control. Color cross-sections of male and female anatomies show up on the screen. Mackey jabs the screen with his pointer. The boys, especially Kyle, analyze the pictures. Mackey then points to the male anatomy] Now, this is the male anatomy, m'kay. Here we see the testes and the scrotum. [Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman stifle some more giggles] STOP that, m'kay! The next person that laughs is gonna get a referral! [the boys stop quick] M'kay. Now, in order to have intercourse, the man takes his penis, and he... hmmm... uhh... [slows his speech a bit] let's see, the man takes his penis, and he... hm.
STAN
Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey?
MR. MACKEY
Well, sure I have! It's just... I was about 19 at the time, so it's been about 21 years... m'kay. Let's see, uh... [turns around and starts again] I'm pretty sure I took th-yeah I took the penis, and I bu- uh, what the hell did I do with that damned thing??
[South Park Elementary, day. "Fourth Grade" is shown on a classroom door — this is Ms. Choksondik's room. Twelve girls are present.]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright girls, even though this may be stuff you don't want to hear, you need to hear it.
WENDY
Oh, we wanna hear it, Ms. Choksondik. We're excited.
BEBE
Yeah, we think it's gonna be fun!
GIRLS
Yeah!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Fun! It's going to be fun! Well let's start with our first lesson, then, shall we? [writes on the board] SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES!! [the girls sit quietly] That's right, because unless you get boys to wear condoms you can and will get a sexually transmitted disease from them! How fun is that, hmmm?! Is that fun?
WENDY
I didn't mean that-
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Today over 20,000 Americans will contract a sexual disease! TODAY! Twelve thousand more tomorrow! And the reason is that you girls wake up in the morning and say, "It's not going to happen to me." You say, "Oh, Ms. Choksondik, that happens to girls in Detroit, in Brooklyn, but not here in Colorado." WRONG! [the girls look chastened] Gonorrhea, herpes, chlamydia, HPV, HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, the list goes on and on! These are serious diseases! They have serious consequences! [the girls are definitely afraid] You think that sex is about fun and games and love? [now with a folder in her left hand] Wrong! Sex is about disease! Here's a little picture of herpes.
GIRLS
AAAHHH!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
And here's a little syphilis for you!
GIRLS
AAAHHH!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
That's right, girls. Here's what happens when you don't get boys to use condoms!
[The school kitchen, lunch.]
CHEF
Hello there, children.
BOYS
Hey Chef.
CHEF
How is sexual education class going?
STAN
It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'.
CHEF
Yeah, I don't think Ol' Mackey knows a hymen from a hysterectomy. And Choksondik? I'd be surprised if she's ever gotten laid in her life.
KYLE
Yeah... Chef, what's "laid"?
CHEF
...Oh, nothin'. Now, move along, children, you're holdin' up the line.
[The school cafeteria, moments later. The boys exit the kitchen. Behind them are Tweek, Tolkien, Clyde, Butters, Kevin and Timmy.]
KYLE
Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.
STAN
Yeah. [they approach the girls] Hey Wendy, did you guys get-
GIRLS
AAAAHHH! [hurry away from their table]
KYLE
What the hell is wrong with them? [the boys move towards the girls, who now have their backs against the far wall]
STAN
You guys, we just wanna know-
GIRLS
AAAAHHH!
WENDY
Stay away from me, Stan!
STAN
Why?
WENDY
Are you wearing a condom?
STAN
...A what?
GIRLS
AAAAHHH!
BEBE
Do any of you have your condoms on?
KYLE
No.
GIRLS
AAAAHHH!
WENDY
Don't you know that without wearing a condom you could get a disease?
KYLE
Nuh uh.
BEBE
Yuh huh! If you don't wear a condom, you're gonna get AIDS.
CARTMAN
AIDS?
BUTTERS
Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas.
KYLE
Is that what you learned in sex ed?
CARTMAN
Mr. Mackey didn't say nothin' about that.
STAN
Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything.
WENDY
You guys have to wear condoms. Now, please, just, just go away. We don't want your AIDS.
STAN
[moves towards Wendy] But Wendy, we don't understand how that-
GIRLS
AAAAHHH! [they throw their food up in the air and scatter, leaving the boys confused]
KYLE
Oh my God, dude.
BUTTERS
Uh what are we gonna do, huh?
STAN
Dude, we gotta go get condoms quick.
BOYS
Yeah. [they set their meals down at nearby tables and walk away. Cartman returns for his meal and takes it with him]
[South Park pharmacy. The boys go in: Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, Clyde, Tolkien, Butters, Kevin, Tweek, and Timmy]
PHARMACIST
Can I help you boys?
STAN
Yeah, we need condoms!
PHARMACIST
[looks at them funny] Condoms?
KYLE
Yeah. Quick!
PHARMACIST
How old are you boys?
STAN
Why does that matter?
BUTTERS
Ha-I'll be nine next week.
PHARMACIST
Sorry, kids, I'm not selling you condoms.
KYLE
Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?
PHARMACIST
I just don't think kids your age should be-
ASSISTANT
[intervening] Mark, we have to be willing to supply condoms to anyone who requests them.
MARK
But... they're... children!
ASSISTANT
Would you rather them do it unprotected?
CARTMAN
Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?!
MARK
I just think that all this sex ed and condom talk in elementary school is wrong!
ASSISTANT
Kids are going to do what they do, and it's up to us to make sure they're protected.
STAN
Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side.
MARK
I don't think we have any that'll even fit them!
ASSISTANT
Sure we do. We just got in the new Gladiators for kids. 'Lil Mini's. They're specially designed for kids under 10, and they're only five ninety five for a box of fifty.
BUTTERS
Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same one every day?
ASSISTANT
No, you have to change it.
KYLE
Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things.
[Ms. Choksondik's house, night. Mr. Mackey has come by for a visit. Books sit on two tables and the floor]
MR. MACKEY
Uh thanks so much for letting me come over, Ms. Choksondik.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Oh, it's no problem, Mr. Mackey. It's probably best we come up with a lesson plan together anyway.
MR. MACKEY
Yeah I've already gone over most of the basics, you know, uh with the boys, but I uh... eh just wanted to see what else you were teaching the girls, in case I... "missed" anything.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[reaches for a book and opens it] Well we should make sure our students are good and scared of the consequences. We have to teach them that diseases are possible even with just oral sex.
MR. MACKEY
Right! Oral sex, which of course would be...
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[reading, then she looks at him] Using your mouth on the penis or vagina.
MR. MACKEY
Penis or vagina, right. Oral sex, m'kay.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
It's just too bad these girls are having sex so young.
MR. MACKEY
Yeah, why d-uh, did you?
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Did I what?
MR. MACKEY
Well uh, how long did you wait before you had... uh... doobers.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Well, if you must know, I'm still somewhat of a virgin. [thinks, then quickly adds] But I'm not ashamed of it! I wasn't sought after much in high school or college. [rises and moves off some distance] I was made fun of most of my life for having such large glasses. [looks down at her rims] The only boyfriend I ever had was this attractive popular boy named Steven Garrett. I liked him very much, but I... found out that he was dating me because he lost a bet on the Super Bowl. The loser had to go out with me for three days.
MR. MACKEY
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
People can be very cruel. Anyway, I know it's hard to understand.
MR. MACKEY
Ah actually I understand perfectly. I... I wasn't exactly the captain of the football team, either, huh huh, hehehuh, [softly] anyhow [normal] And then as I got older my... my head just sorta seemed to get bigger while the rest of my body stayed the same. That's how I got my nickname in college. [places the book on the side table]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Your nickname?
MR. MACKEY
"That guy with the really big head."
MS. CHOKSONDIK
...Right.
MR. MACKEY
Anyway, I... I sort of lost any confidence and found it impossible to ever ask a woman out, mm, hm mm.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Wow, I've... never met a man who is... as sexually unappealing as me.
MR. MACKEY
Neither have I.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[pause] Well, I'm quite happy without sex. I mean, with all the diseases and problems out there, who needs it, right?
MR. MACKEY
Uh not me! [they both giggle.] Huhuh, okay.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Well, back to the lesson plan, then.
MR. MACKEY
Right. [gets the book again]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Okay. [they both open their books] "Oral Sex"
[Bus stop, day. The boys are gathered there waiting...]
STAN
Doesn't it give any other directions?
BUTTERS
Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener. [takes a condom out and gives the bag it Kyle] "If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes"
KYLE
Uh, what are "studzes"
BUTTERS
How the heck should I know? [removes the wrapper from the condom] Why, it's just a little doughnut. [squeezes it a little] Hoh- it's all gooey.
CARTMAN
Just put it on, Butters.
BUTTERS
Ha-a how come I gotta go first?
CARTMAN
Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering?
BUTTERS
Ma-a-a-a-a-a alright, man. [turns his back to the camera and drops his pants, then slips the condom on] O-o-o-o-h, it's sticky.
KYLE
It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.
BUTTERS
I don't even understand how this thing... ooh, wait. Oh, I see. [Cartman leans in for a better look]
STAN
Don't look at Butters' schlong, gaymo!
CARTMAN
I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on!
KYLE
Sure.
BUTTERS
But it won't stay on. I- I need a rubber band or somethin'.
TWEEK
Ah, I got rubber bands. [pulls a few out and walks over to Butters. Butters takes one]
BUTTERS
[rubber band snaps in place] Ow! Huhuh, ow! Okay, eh. [snap] Ow! There. Okay, I think it's on.
STAN
How do you feel?
BUTTERS
...Pretty good.
CARTMAN
Do you feel protected?
BUTTERS
Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it.
STAN
Alright, here, everybody. [begins to move from his end to the other, visiting each of the boys] Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on.
TIMMY
Timmehah!
[South Park Elementary, day. Principal Victoria has called the teachers together in her office. Chef is there as well.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Teachers, I have some bad news. Last night I received a phone call from the local pharmacist. Apparently, almost all of our fourth graders are sexually active. And now that we've scared them a little they're buying condoms to use.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
I knew it! Well, at least we scared them enough to protect themselves. But now maybe you'll believe me when I say that we need to be teaching even younger than fourth grade.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
But how old do you think a student should be when they learn about proper condom use?
MS. CHOKSONDIK
...Kindergarten.
CHEF
Kindergarten?!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
We've got to get to the students before they start having... sex. Nu-not after.
CHEF
Aw, now this is getting ridiculous!
MR. ADLER
I have to agree with Ms. Choksondik. It's our responsibility to make sure our kids are safe if they're gonna screw around.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I guess we have no choice.
[Kindergarten, next day.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, who can tell me what a condom is? [puts a box of Gladiator condoms on the table. The kindergartners look at him, and finally a girl raises her hand] Yes, Jenny?
JENNY
It flies around and it's endangered.
MR. GARRISON
That's a con-dor, Jenny. Con-dor. [holds up the box] Con-doms are what we use to stop the spread of STDs. [Filmore raises his hand] Yes, Filmore?
FILMORE
Can we do fingerpaint?
MR. GARRISON
NO, we can't do fingerpaint! You kids wanna get herpes?! Huh?! How about a nice bucket of AIDS?! Sound good?! Now pay attention, alright? I'm going to show you the proper way to put on a condom. [puts a phallus on the table] First of all you remove the condom from its package. [demonstrates] Then you find which way the condom rolls out. [demonstrates] Put it in your mouth... [puts it in his mouth] And apply. [proceeds to do so. The kids watch on astonished, and one of the boys finally cries. Mr. Garrison finishes and raises his head] And it's as simple as that. Any questions?
[Ms. Choksondik's classroom, same time.]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright girls. Yesterday we went over the myriad of diseases you can get from boys, but today we're going to talk about the most horrible they can give you of all. [writes on the board] PREGNANCY! [turns around] That's right, since you girls have decided to be sexually active, teen pregnancy is at an all-time high! You seem to think it's gonna be fun and neat to have a baby-well, let's watch a little video, shall we?! [goes towards the door and wheels back a TV cart with VCR, and turns on the TV.]
NARRATOR
["The Miracle of Child Birth"] Snacky S'mores presents: The Miracle of Child Birth. [shot of the girls watching] The time is drawing close for delivery. Here we can see the water breaking.
GIRLS
Eeeeww. [as the narrator speaks, the girls get more and more shocked]
NARRATOR
Later, the contractions are happening closer together. Mom sure is in a lot of pain. Now we can see the crown of the baby's head, stretching the vaginal walls in ways never before thought possible by Mom. Finally, the miracle happens, and the baby is born. [Screen shot of baby being handled by the doctor is shown] but Mom's not done yet.
GIRL
Eeww.
NARRATOR
She still got some afterbirth to push out of her. [shot of afterbirth being pushed out]
GIRLS
AAAAAAAA!!!! [they get out of their seats and rush out of the room]
NARRATOR
That's right.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[follows the girl to the door] Girls! Girls! Where are you going?! [gets no answer, but she sees Mr. Mackey in front of her, in the hallway ending at her door, about to enter another door. She looks down and notices his butt, and just stands there...]
[Mr. Mackey's class, later. Some of the boys, including Stan and Kyle, have their hands over their crotches.]
STAN
Man, this condom's driving me crazy.
KYLE
Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.
CARTMAN
Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom easier. [takes a condom just filled with urine and tosses it at the trashcan. It hits the side and splatters the urine next to the can.]
MR. MACKEY
[enters with briefcase and books] Alright, boys, I now have all the information I need to teach you the female anatomy, hm'kay. [tosses the briefcase and books onto his desk and moves towards the light switch, grinning. He turns off the lights and starts the projector] M'kay, this part here is the vaginal opening. [a picture of the female reproductive system. He points to the opening. Cartman works on a new condom] This is where the man puts his- Eric, what the hell are you doing?
CARTMAN
I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up.
MR. MACKEY
Why are you wearing a condom?
CARTMAN
So I don't get AIDS.
MR. MACKEY
Eric, you can't get AIDS from just sitting around, you have to get it from sex.
STAN
From sex??
MR. MACKEY
Yes.
KYLE
You mean, intercourse with a girl?
MR. MACKEY
Yes! Now will you all pay attention, please?! The vagina and the clitoris are on the outside, and they are in fact very easily visible to the naked eye.
STAN
All this time... It's the girls that give us diseases!
CARTMAN
I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face!
MR. MACKEY
Now here we can see the interior female anatomy. Things like the uterus and the ovaries are on the inside
KYLE
Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!
STAN
Yeah, come on guys, this is war! [leaves his seat and heads for the door. The other boys follow]
BOYS
[among their statements] Yeah! That's right! Come on! [The last of the boys leaves, and Mr. Mackey doesn't notice. He begins to daydream. The generic female drawing turns into one of Ms. Choksondik, and he grins. He goes to the screen again, and moves his hand over the image]
MR. MACKEY
And here we see the tender, magical uterus. Here we see the enticing, voluptuous Fallopian tubes, m'kay.
[Mr. Garrison's room, later]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, now I wanna review the different sexual positions. Who can tell me which sexual positions we talked about?
FILMORE
[raises his hand] Miss'nary position?
MR. GARRISON
[turns around and writes the position] Missionary position, good. A little boring, but tried and true. What else?
GIRL
Doggie?
MR. GARRISON
[turns around and writes the position] That's right. Doggie style we went over, mhm.
BOY
Pile driver?
MR. GARRISON
[turns around and writes the position] Uh huh, pile driver position. Good, Quaid.
FLORA
The Filthy Sanchez?
MR. GARRISON
[turns around and writes the position] Yes, good Flora, you remembered the Filthy Sanchez.
BOY 2
Hot Karl?
MR. GARRISON
[turns around and writes the position] Yes,you can give your partner the ol' Hot Karl, sure.
[A barren field near the school, day. An army of boys comes in from a distance in makeshift military vehicles. Butters is wearing a hockey mask. Clyde comes up and stops them.]
CLYDE
There, you see? The girls have built some kind of stronghold to keep us out. [the stronghold has a moat and reads: "Boys Keep Out"]
WENDY
[at the helm of a gun turret] Stay away from us, bastards! We don't wanna get pregnant!
BEBE
Yeah! Just take your diseases and go away forever!
STAN
Ha! They're your diseases!
KYLE
Yeah! You get out of town!
CARTMAN
Here, talk to them, Butters.
BUTTERS
[lifts up his mask] Uh, me?? Huh, what the heck am I supposed to say?
CARTMAN
Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence.
BUTTERS
[lowers his mask and speaks into the mike. A deep raspy voice comes out] Just walk away. You can put a stop to all this. Just walk away and we will spare your lives. Just walk away.
KYLE
[to Stan] Man, he's pretty good.
BEBE
We'll never walk away. Never! [tosses a boomerang towards the boys. Clyde ducks as the boomerang comes towards him, and Kenny is struck dead]
KENNY
(Waa-ooo!) [falls back and expires]
CARTMAN
Oh, bitch!
STAN
That does it! Attack! [the boys rush the stronghold]
[Ms. Choksondik's house, at that moment. They have books open]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, so apparently the lesson plan tomorrow is s'posed to involve the secretion of bodily fluids, m'kay.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
I've already gone through that with the girls. [closes her book and sets it down] It's pretty simple. Do you wanna drink?
MR. MACKEY
Why, sure. [she goes to get drinks] Hey uh I think I can... get through that stuff pretty quick, mm... [he gets a good look at her derriere] Uh, maybe we should come up with another lesson plan.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[hands Mr. Mackey his drink] Something about how nerve endings play an important part in intercourse. [sits down]
MR. MACKEY
Uh, right, right, uh, like in the ...nipples.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Or the... shaft... of the penis? [they look away from each other]
MR. MACKEY
It... says here that the uh, head of the penis is actually the... most sensitive... part, m'kay.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Why, yes. The nerve endings are the most concentrated at- the- tip of the penis. Like they are in the... [looks at him. They draw close to each other] clitoris of the woman.
MR. MACKEY
And these... are the two areas most important to-
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Sexual stimulation. [they kiss quick, then kiss full and long. Some love music comes up. She pulls back] Oh, is this wrong?
MR. MACKEY
I don't know. It doesn't feel wrong. [they kiss full again] I've been thinking about you a lot, Ms. Choksondik.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Yeah? What do you do when you think about me?
MR. MACKEY
I go crazy.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Do you touch yourself?
MR. MACKEY
Yeah. Hmm. [they embrace. She takes off his tie. He stands, walks some distance, and takes off his shirt. She stands, takes off her top, and tosses it away. She approaches him and removes his belt. He takes off his pants. She looks at him again and goes down to remove his briefs. She tosses them aside. He bends down to remove her underwear and tosses them aside. She coaxes him down, and he follows]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[writhing] Haawww. Haawww.
MR. MACKEY
G'oh, m'kay.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Oh my God. Oh God, yeah! Stop! Stop!
MR. MACKEY
Huh, what's wrong?
MS. CHOKSONDIK
It's your turn. [goes down to work on him]
MR. MACKEY
Mm, oh, oh Ms. Choksondik. M' kay! M'kay!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[gets up] Do you want me?
MR. MACKEY
I do.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Tell me.
MR. MACKEY
I want you. M'kay. [they go down, then moments later quickly get up]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Wait wait wait! Do you have a condom?
MR. MACKEY
Well. No.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[looks into his eyes and then] Oh well, fuck it [they go down, and the consummation begins] Oh God, give it to me! [his ass rises for the first time]
MR. MACKEY
Oh yeah. Woh. [his ass appears again]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Woh. [his ass appears again] Ooh, that's it baby! That's it!
MR. MACKEY
[his ass appears again] Aw, this feels so good, m'kay. [his ass appears again]
[The empty field. later. The battle is joined. Kids run around seeking positions from which to shoot. Seven boys come up to the stronghold gate. Millie fires a Gatling gun at them from the left side, and they scatter, dropping their weapons]
BOYS
WAAAAHHH!! [two boys prepare a Molotov cocktail, and one of them tosses it at the tires on the right side of the gate entrance. The tires go up in flames. The boys run away, and a huge flash explosion rises inside the stronghold]
GIRLS
Waaaahh!! [they bail out immediately, and a much larger explosion rises, tossing kids away left and right]
[The Marsh house. Randy and Sharon are reading papers when the house moves about as if an earthquake had just rolled by. Sharon drops her paper]
SHARON
What the hell was that?
[Ms. Choksondik's house. Mr. Mackey and Ms. Choksondik rise from their activity and look out the window]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Did you feel something?
[Chef's house. The front door opens and he walks out. He's shocked at what he sees.]
CHEF
Oh, no!
[South Park Elementary. The four remaining staff members, Principal Victoria, Mr. Garrison, Mr. Adler, and Ms. Chosie, walk out and see the wreckage. Principal Victoria puts her hand over her mouth in dumbfounded shock]
MR. GARRISON
Jesus Christ. [a shot of the burning wreckage, then of Butters, Cartman, Stan, and Kyle looking at the wreckage]
CARTMAN
Ooo, Butters? You're in big trouble now.
[The empty field. later. All the parents have come by to make sure their kids are okay. The wreckage still burns]
SHARON
Well, I don't know what got into you kids. You should be ashamed of yourselves. [in the background paramedics pick up injured kids and put them in ambulances]
STAN
We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
I'm afraid this is all my fault. I... think I went a little overboard scaring the girls. I forgot to tell them that to get diseases from boys you... have to have sex with them first.
KIDS
Oooohhh.
CHEF
Well, I hate to say it, but you all got what you deserved.
PARENTS
Huh?
CHEF
Look: Schools are teaching condom use to younger and younger students each day! But sex isn't something that should be taught in textbooks and diagrams. Sex is emotional and spiritual. It needs to be taught by family. I know it can be hard, parents, but if you leave it up to the schools to teach sex to kids, you don't know who they're learning it from. It could be from someone who doesn't know, [a shot of Mr. Mackey] someone who has a bad opinion of it, [a shot of Ms. Choksondik looking around] or even a complete pervert. [a shot of Mr. Garrison]
MR. GARRISON
Wha? Why did you pan to me just now? What the hell is that s'posed to mean?
MS. CHOKSONDIK
He's right. I never knew how special and personal sex was un... until just recently.
SHARON
This whole mess started because we couldn't talk to our boy ourselves.
SHEILA
It's easier to just leave it up to the school, but it's...just not a school subject.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Then it's decided: no more condom classes in grade school.
KIDS
Hooray!
STAN
But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex?
CHEF
It's very simple, children. The right time to start having sex is... 17.
KYLE
Seventeen? [Sheila and Gerald approach]
CHEF
Seventeen.
SHEILA
So you mean 17 as long as you're in love?
CHEF
Nope, just 17.
GERALD
But, what if you're not ready at 17?
CHEF
Seventeen! You're ready. [Stan walks up to Wendy]
STAN
Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy?
WENDY
Yeah. Thank God.
CARTMAN
Well, I guess now that that's out of the way, we can get on with our lives. Come here, boy! [a dog enters the scene, and the camera begins to zoom out. Everyone is smiling and looking on as Cartman pleases the dog] That's it. Red rocket, red rocket. Come on, now. Come on, red rocket, dog. Red rocket now.
[End of Proper Condom Use, but Mr. Garrison has a few more things to say]
MR. GARRISON
Okay children, so what other sexual positions have we talked about? Yeah, the wrap-around butt grab. Sure, can't forget that. Uh huh, reverse cowgirl. Good, Kevin. Hot Lunch, sure, she likes that. Donkey Punch, uh huh. Glass-bottom boat. Good one, yes. Fish-eye. Good, Jenny. Chili dog. Mm-hm.
End of Proper Condom Use

script:Towelie

[Stan's house, day. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are in the living room playing video games.]
KYLE
HA! I killed you!
STAN
HA, I blew your head off!
KENNY
(Aw, Goddamnit!)
STAN
Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom?
KYLE
Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?
CARTMAN
Let a man take a crap!
STAN
Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet.
KYLE
Hyeah, that poor, poor thing
STAN
Come on, Cartman! You're missing the game!
CARTMAN
[from behind the bathroom door] I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that? [finishes wiping his butt and zips himself up. He comes out of the bathroom with something in his hands] You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper.
KYLE
Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?
CARTMAN
Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody.
SHARON
[walks in with a basket of laundry] Are you guys still playing that video game?
STAN
Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.
CARTMAN
[holds it up] Look. [Sharon gasps and drops the laundry. Cartman unravels it] But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through. [looks through it]
SHARON
Eric, put that down!
CARTMAN
Why?
SHARON
Just go put it back in the trashcan!
CARTMAN
[inspects it] Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive.
SHARON
No that... that came from me; just put it away.
CARTMAN
This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?! [hick accent] You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller.
STAN
[looks up at his mom] What is it, Mom?
KYLE
Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?
SHARON
Boys, that a... feminine thing. Alright, it's a personal, woman thing. [game play stops and the boys look at her] I tell you what: If you'll just drop the whole thing right now, I'll buy you that new video game console you've been wanting.
STAN
The 2001 Okama GameSphere?
SHARON
Sure.
KYLE
Cool!
CARTMAN
Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys!
[Luau's Toys, day, later. A banner reading "WE HAVE GAMESPHERE" hangs over the window, and the console itself is in the window display.]
STAN
There it is. The Okama GameSphere. [the game console is shown, along with two controllers and several boxes containing the console]
KYLE
Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM.
STAN
What's that?
KYLE
Don't know, but it kicks ass. [they watch as Sharon buys the console from Mr. Harris and he wraps it up and delivers it to her] Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park.
CARTMAN
Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere. [the boys turn away from the window]
STAN
Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend. [checks his watch.] It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!
KENNY
(Woohoo!)
KYLE
Awesome! [suddenly remembers] Oh, crap.
STAN
What?
KYLE
I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.
STAN
Dude, we got GameSphere.
KYLE
I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake. [a strange character walks up next to them]
TOWELIE
Don't forget to bring a towel. [it's a walking, talking towel]
STAN
What?
TOWELIE
When you get out of the water you need to dry off right away to avoid catchin' a cold. That's why Towelie says, "Don't forget to bring a towel."
STAN
...O-kay.
KYLE
Thanks, Towelie.
TOWELIE
[after a few moments of silence] Do you wanna get high?
STAN
No. [Towelie looks for a few moments, then walks away]
KYLE
Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games.
CARTMAN
Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere.
SHARON
Here you go, boys. [Stan takes the shopping box and the boys take off]
BOYS
AAAAAA.
[Stan's house, later. In the living room, Kyle finishes connecting the GameSphere to the back of the TV]
KYLE
Okay, turn it on.
TV
"Okama GameSphere"!
BOYS
Whoa!
TV
[the game title comes up] Thirst For BLOOD!
CARTMAN
Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it.
KYLE
Oh, this is so cool.
CARTMAN
Bring it, bring it! [on the TV two monsters fight each other. The one on the right attacks the other with a chainsaw. "Oh!"]
[Stan's house, night. The boys have been playing for hours. Around them are empty boxes of Cheesy Poofs and cans of Zoop soda. On the sofa is a bag of chips. Stan's parents walk up to the boys.]
SHARON
Goodnight, boys. Don't stay up too late.
STAN
G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere.
CARTMAN
[slowly slides into a hick accent] Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih.
RANDY
What?
SHARON
Nothing. Come on, Randy. [whisks him off to bed. From the TV: "Twenty kills."]
[Stan's house, Sunday morning, dawn. The boys have stayed up all night playing video games. Kyle is on the phone with his parents.]
KYLE
Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got- [to Cartman] wha-what is it?
CARTMAN
Date-rape psychosis.
KYLE
Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon. [hangs up] I don't have to go outside!
CARTMAN
Awesome!
KYLE
She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight..
STAN
Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!
CARTMAN
We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children!
STAN
Well, it's alright. We can still play for [looks at his watch] six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball.
TOWELIE
[walks in from nowhere] Don't forget to bring a towel.
KYLE
Uh no.
TOWELIE
When you're playin' sports, the sweat can get in your face. That's why Towelie says, "Always keep an extra towel in your duffel bag."
STAN
Okay, we will.
TOWELIE
[raises its arms in victory] Alright! [lowers them, then after some moments] Do you wanna get high?
KYLE
No we don't wanna get high!
TOWELIE
Okay... You sure?
CARTMAN
Yes! Go away, you stupid towel! [Towelie goes away]
STAN
Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!
CARTMAN
That's... so... cool!
[Stan's house, later... The boys have repositioned themselves and look half-asleep from all the game play. Doughnuts and ice cream appear - a cone is on the rug with its ice cream melting. Sharon walks up to them again.]
SHARON
Okay, boys, that's it. You have to go now.
STAN
No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer.
SHARON
No, Stanley, it's Monday morning. You have to go to school.
CARTMAN
It's Monday?
STAN
Oh, uh, I'm sick.
KYLE
Me too.
SHARON
No, you're not sick. Now get to school. [disconnects the console from the TV] All of you.
STAN
But Mom...
SHARON
Go!
BOYS
Aagh!
[Bus stop, moments later. The boys are now waiting for the bus.]
STAN
Can't believe we have to go to school!
KYLE
Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid.
STAN
We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere. [a green car pulls up in front of them. Two soldiers are in it]
COMMANDER
Hello, boys, how are you?
STAN
Fine.
COMMANDER
Say, boys, this may sound a little ...odd, but... have you see a ...talking ...towel around anywhere.
KYLE
What? You mean Towelie? [the two soldier look alarmed. The passenger quickly gets on the radio]
COMMANDER
Echo, this is Garrett. I've got a code 5 at... [checks his map] Park County, Colorado! Repeat! Code 5, Park County, Colorado! [the men look at the boys]
CARTMAN
What, dude? [the driver steps on the gas and the car peels away. The passenger soldier looks out the window and back at the boys.]
STAN
This is gonna be one looong-ass day. [Ms. Crabtree pulls up and the boys get on the bus.]
[Stan's house, Monday afternoon. The boys arrive there from the bus stop]
STAN
That was the longest day of school ever!
KYLE
Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! [the boys burst in and head for the television]
[Stan's house, living room. The boys stand in from of the television]
KYLE
Where is it?
STAN
It... it was right here.
KYLE
Where the hell is it??
CARTMAN
Come on, man, this isn't funny! [Kenny, Kyle, and Cartman look around and behind the TV] I need my fix! [the phone rings, and Stan goes to answer it.]
STAN
Hello?
VOICE
If you ever wanna see your Okama GameSphere again, you will bring us the towel. [the boys gather to wait for Stan]
STAN
What? Who-who is this?
VOICE
Just get the towel and meet us at the gas station outside of town. Or else! [in the background: "Okama GameSphere!"]
STAN
Don't hurt it! [Click. Stan then hangs up]
KYLE
What? [Stan turns around]
STAN
They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.
CARTMAN
[in disbelief, backs up.] No! ...No!
KYLE
Uh-uh-uh what do you mean "they've taken it"? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!
[South Park, sunset. The boys walk down Main Street.]
STAN
Towelie!
CARTMAN
Hey, towel!
KYLE
Where the hell is he?
KENNY
(I don't know. Where could it be?)
STAN
I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him.
KYLE
What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.
CARTMAN
Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call. [the others stop, and he calls out in one direction] Gebaayybeh! [then in another] Gebaayybeh!
KYLE
That's a towel call?
STAN
This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.
KYLE
Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water.
STAN
Hey yeah. [goes into the street and clears his throat] Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool! [looks around. So do the others] Aaah. Let's go take a shower! [all look around] Let's go waterskiing!
TOWELIE
[walks up] Don't forget to bring a towel.
KYLE
There he is!
TOWELIE
Be sure to bring a towel so you don't get aaall wet. [Stan walks over angrily and takes Towelie's left hand, and pulls him along].
STAN
Come on, dude! [the others follow]
TOWELIE
Where are we goin'?
KYLE
Just come on! It's getting dark.
TOWELIE
Are we gonna get high?
[Outskirts of South Park, night. A full moon shines down on the boys as they reach the gas station]
KYLE
Are you sure this is where they said to be?
STAN
They said the gas station outside of town.
TOWELIE
Well, I'm gonna get a little high. [A high-powered light comes on]
MAN
Hold it! [ten men stand in the light. Some of them wear red berets]
STAN
Who is that? [squints his eyes and blocks the light. Towelie does the same]
MAN
Step... away... from the towel! [the boys do so, and an official steps forth]
OFFICIAL
There you are, towel. We've been looking all over for you.
TOWELIE
If you ever go to a hotel, be sure to bring your own towel.
OFFICIAL
It isn't safe for you out here, towel. There are people out here to mean to harm you.
STAN
'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games.
OFFICIAL
Your what?
KYLE
Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!
OFFICIAL
I don't know what you're talking about.
STAN
You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back.
OFFICIAL
Omigod! [shrieks] IT"S A TRAP!! [gunfire strikes him and kills him. Behind the boys soldiers pop up in the hills and continue firing]
MAN 2
Cover! Cover! [the officials and their personal security force fire back, and the light is knocked out]
STAN
Goddamnit, what now?!
OFFICIAL
Run, towel! [a grenade lands between two guards and blows up, shredding them to bits. The boys just look on]
STAN
[disinterested] Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere. [leads the others away]
SOLDIER 1
Where's the towel?!
SOLDIER 2
It can't be far! [two more soldiers come up, and others move along behind them] Alvarez, you and Mitchell sweep left!
GUARD
[coughs up blood. The boys arrive] Hurry! You must get the towel back to Tynacorp!
STAN
[grabs the guard by the lapels and throttles him] Where is our Okama GameSphere?
GUARD
Get the towel home [cough] They will explain everything. Please, hurry! [coughs up blood once more, and dies]
KYLE
Aw, God-damnit!
STAN
Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?
TOWELIE
What? Oh yeah, back at the base. It's a long ways away.
STAN
Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys. [they go for the truck. From a distance in a woods nearby, a commander looks at the troop movements]
COMMANDER
Well?
SOLDIER
They've gone, sir. It's like they've vanished out of thin air.
COMMANDER
Damnit! I knew those boys were protecting that towel. [gets pensive] They must have some unexplainable bond with it.
SOLDIER 2
Perhaps they're telepathically linked to the towel, sir, like E.T. [the commander looks at him annoyed, and he leaves]
COMMANDER
It could already be anywhere, hiding out again. No, the time for being nice is over. We must instigate... Plan B.
SOLDIER 3
You mean...?
COMMANDER
Yes. [camera zooms in] Destroy all towels within a thousand mile radius. [fade to black]
[A desert, later that night. The truck rolls along... Stan steers, Kyle, Towelie, and Cartman ride along. Kenny mans the pedals]
KYLE
Are we getting close?
TOWELIE
I think so.
STAN
A little more gas, Kenny. [Kenny presses down on the gas pedal]
KYLE
How long has it been since you've been back there.
TOWELIE
I've been wanderin' around on my own for the past few weeks. You know, helpin' people out with towel safety and proper towel use. It's important.
CARTMAN
No it isn't.
TOWELIE
Is!
CARTMAN
No it isn't.
TOWELIE
Is! Wait, turn down here. It's down this dirt road.
STAN
Brake, Kenny, brake. [Kenny brakes, and Stan steers the truck to the right to go down the dirt road. Towelie moves to the window]
CARTMAN
Egh!
TOWELIE
M-maybe it's down that dirt road.
STAN
[sighs] Dude, don't you remember where it is?
TOWELIE
I can't remember, it all looks the same. Hold on, let me get high. [pulls out a joint...] then I'll remember where it is. [lights the joint and puffs deeply. The boys watch him as his eyes get bloodshot.]
STAN
Alright, so where is it?
TOWELIE
Where's what?
BOYS
Agh!
KYLE
The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! [Towelie simply snorts]
STAN
Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny! [Kenny brakes angrily and the truck jerks to a stop] Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!
TOWELIE
Well calm down.
KYLE
That's it! [takes the joint] You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!
TOWELIE
That's my last joint, asshole!
KYLE
I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!
TOWELIE
Oh man, why is everyone riding me today? God-damnit.
[A purple house, night. Inside, in the restroom, a woman washes her hands and face, then pulls a towel out of its rack to dry herself]
WOMAN
Kevin? Don't forget to wrap the potato salad in aluminum foil. [some strange sounds are heard outside the door] Kevin, is that you?
SOLDIER
Harris! Reach bang and clear!
WOMAN
Hello? [the bathroom door flies open and five soldiers pour in, firing away] WAAH! [she falls to the ground quick] Ohmigod! Oh no! Ohmigod! [she covers her head]
SOLDIER
Alright, it's clear! It's clear! [the soldiers leave the restroom. The woman gets up and checks herself for bullet wounds and finds none. She turns to see the wall behind her. The towels on their rack are shot through with holes. She blinks, confused]
[a backyard. Mrs. Tweak pulls down some clothes she's had drying on clotheslines. As she nears the towels, three soldiers rush in and start firing away at them]
SOLDIERS
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!! [Mrs. Tweak leans out of the way, watching her towels get shot up.]
SOLDIER
Let's go let's go! [The soldiers finish their job and walk away. Mrs. Tweak straightens up]
[A men's gym shower, night. Mr. Garrison is in the shower with two other men. He finishes and wraps a white towel with blue stripes around his waist, then walks towards his locker]
SOLDIER
Get it!
MR. GARRISON
What the? [two soldiers rush over and make him face the lockers. One of them pulls off his towel]
SOLDIER
Throw it down! [the soldier throws it down]
MR. GARRISON
Oh alright, have your way with me if you must! Go on, fulfill you sick pleasures! [the soldier stabs at the towel twice, then directs another soldier to fire away at it. The other soldier shoots at it while the other two watch]
SOLDIER
Alright, let's go! [the soldiers leave]
MR. GARRISON
Huh where are you goin'?
[The truck the boys are driving pulls up in front of a gleaming glass building with "TYNACORP" above the entrance, and the boys pour out with Towelie]
CARTMAN
This is where you came from?
TOWELIE
Yeah, I think so. [gets woozy] Oh man.
STAN
What?
TOWELIE
I'm so high right now. I have no idea what's goin' on. [the group goes around the fountain and goes inside]
[Tynacorp, inside. The boys walk down a long passageway]
RESEARCH LEADER
Welcome home, Smart Towel RG-400.
STAN
Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?
KYLE
We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.
RESEARCH LEADER
Thank you for bringing him to us, boys. You see, this is not an ordinary towel. He is the RG-400 Smart Towel, designed with a computer chip inside the terry cloth
STAN
We don't care.
RESEARCH LEADER
You see, here at Tynacorp, our goal was to make the perfect towel. A towel that would sense how wet or dry the user's skin was and fluff itself accordingly.
STAN
Dude, we don't care.
RESEARCH LEADER
Towelie was our greatest success. Smart enough to beat the average human at chess and absorbent enough to soak up even the toughest spills. But then one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off.
STAN
We... don't... care.
KYLE
All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?
RESEARCH LEADER
Ah yes, your video game. I'm afraid that what we all experienced was a trap. They called you and said to bring the towel, and then they called us and said they were bringing Towelie back. Their plan was to wipe us all out with one fell swoop.
KYLE
Who's they?
RESEARCH LEADER
Why, the military. You see, after Towelie got high and wandered off from here, the military got a hold of him. They wanted to turn Towelie into a weapon of mass destruction.
STAN
[dismissive] Don't care, don't care, don't care.
RESEARCH LEADER
Towelie was at their base for months as they tried to copy his TNA. But then, one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off. Again.
CARTMAN
Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!
RESEARCH LEADER
I'm afraid not. Because your Okama GameSphere is at "their" base.
STAN
Can you tell us where "that" is, please?
RESEARCH LEADER
You mean to go right into their base? [thinks] Of course. The entry code should still be in Towelie's memory banks. You could sneak him in there and recover his TNA. Great plan.
[Secret Government Base, night. Inside, various military officials man a command center. Two soldiers walk up to the commander and salute him]
SOLDIER
Sir! Sergeant Masters and Boll are reporting, sir!
COMMANDER
Ah yes. [salutes back, and all three men lower their arms] Tell me, Marine, did you accomplish your primary goal?
SGT. MASTERS
Sir yes sir! All towels have been destroyed! The Smart Towel is no doubt eliminated.
COMMANDER
Ahh. And you're... quite sure of this. [the two sergeants look at each other]
SGT. BOLL
Eh yes sir, there isn't a towel left within a hundred miles.
COMMANDER
Hmm... [taps his pointer on the strategic map] So perhaps, then, you can explain to me why we just got footage of the towel returning to Tynacorp?!
SGT. MASTERS
Oo we...
SGT. BOLL
He must have outsmarted us, sir.
COMMANDER
Well I'm through playing hide and seek! We've got no other choice! Prepare to blow up all of Colorado!
[The night sky. Clouds float by overhead, past the full moon. A helicopter flies into the sky and the camera follows it. Two officials prepare the boys for dives into the military base as the research leader talks]
RESEARCH LEADER
In a moment we will be over the base. This is the only way in. Any attempts on the ground would be easily spotted by guard posts.
KYLE
Okay.
RESEARCH LEADER
[rolls up to Towelie] I hate to send you back in there, Towelie, but only you have their security system in your memory banks.
TOWELIE
That's alright. It's always good to bring a towel.
RESEARCH LEADER
Good luck, boys. The fate of the world is depending on you.
STAN
We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?
GUARD
Alright, boys. When you drop from the plane, cover and roll. Got it?
STAN
Yeah. [the boys join Towelie and all go to jump from the helicopter]
GUARD
Go go go go! [one after the other, the four boys and Towelie jump off, and then the helicopter leaves. Stan is the first to pull his parachute string, and the others follow. Soon they're all next to each other, floating down. Stan sighs]
KYLE
Dude, I figured it out.
STAN
What?
KYLE
If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!
STAN
So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?
KYLE
Seven and a half.
STAN
[getting impatient] Hurry up, stupid parachute!
[Secret Government Base, night. The boys land silently and start walking]
CARTMAN
Alright, I think we go over there. [the Secret Government Base entrance is shown with Towelie and the boys approaching the gate]
TOWELIE
[at the security entry pad] Let's see. [types in some numbers] No. [touches his lips with his right index finger, trying to figure out what to type next]
STAN
Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks.
TOWELIE
Hey it's been a long time!
CARTMAN
You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!
TOWELIE
[faces Cartman] Don't preach to me, fatso!
CARTMAN
I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid!
TOWELIE
You're stupid!
CARTMAN
Yeah, and you're a towel!
TOWELIE
You're a towel! [Cartman has nothing more to say, and Towelie hops off the box towards the boys] Just let me get high. I know I can remember if I get high.
STAN
Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine! [gives Towelie the joint] Here's your stupid lighter. [tosses Towelie the lighter, and Towelie lights up. The bloodshot eyes return.]
TOWELIE
Hold on. [hops on the box and types into the entry pad again.] Wait a second [presses a few buttons] That's it!
KYLE
That's it?
TOWELIE
Yeah. That's the melody to "Funky Town." [starts playing the melody on the keypad] Won't ya take me down... to Funky Town.
STAN
No, Towelie, the entry code!
TOWELIE
[turns around] For what?
STAN
God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence.
[Secret Government Base, night, inside. The boys climb over the fence and sneak past a soldier without arousing suspicion. They end up at the genetic research building]
KYLE
Well let's look in here. [opens the door and leads the others in. Before them are cylinders of liquids, each with a floating deformed clone of Towelie in it. They come across a Towelie clone drying under a heat lamp]
TOWELIE CLONE
Kill... me... Kill... me.
TOWELIE
Oh my God! No-o-o-o!
COMMANDER
[enters with four soldiers, who quickly get set to fire] Well well well. Look what the cat dragged in.
TOWELIE
[turns around with the boys] What are these things?
COMMANDER
Genetic copies we tried to make with your TNA. They didn't work too well, I'm afraid.
TOWELIE CLONE
Kill... me.
STAN
Do you have our Okama GameSphere?
COMMANDER
You did very well to get the towel this far, boys. I wonder: What did they tell you at Tynacorp? That the big, bad government wanted to genetically engineer a Towelie as a weapon? Now let me tell you the real story.
STAN
Oh God, don't care, don't care.
COMMANDER
[pacing proudly, solemnly] Yes, we've been trying to make our own genetic copies of the towel, but only because we had to. You see, when we started spying on Tynacorp, we discovered a certain, terrifying secret. [the boys show no interest.]
SOLDIER
Go on! Ask him what terrifying secret.
KYLE
What terrifying secret?
COMMANDER
That Tynacorp was making these towels to take over the world!
CARTMAN
We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?
COMMANDER
Don't you see what genetically enhanced smart towels like these are capable of? You get out of the shower and dry yourself off. But even after you're dry, the towel makes you more dry. It keeps getting you drier and drier. [his voice begins to deepen] Can you imagine it? What it would feel like to be way, way too dry? I'll tell you something: You don't want to know. And I don't know.
KYLE
And we don't care.
COMMANDER
You've been double-crossed by Tynacorp, kids. They set this all up to get you in here and take us down.
STAN
So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.
COMMANDER
Oh yes. It has been all along.
SOLDIER
Can I kill the towel now, sir?
KYLE
Go ahead. [the boys move away quickly]
COMMANDER
No, wait. [stays the weapon] Perhaps now, we can use their own towel against them. These boys must return to Tynacorp, and we will launch a sneak attack on Tynacorp as well. [zoom in on a tiny camera close to Towelie's lower border. Officials back at Tynacorp's command center are looking at the live feed] You boys can take the towel to Tynacorp's central core, and upload this encryption disk into their system, bringing them down once and for all.
STAN
But we don't care!
[Tynacorp command center. The officials gather around the research leader]
OFFICIAL 1
What the hell is this?! The towel was supposed to go in there and then run its own self-destruct sequence!
RESEARCH LEADER
The towel has a will of its own. It's... learning compassion.
OFFICIAL 2
We don't have the manpower to hold off the entire military AND stop those wonderboys from getting to the core!
RESEARCH LEADER
Then we have no choice. We'll have to test the new prototype a little... earlier. [presses a button. A door with "GS-401" on it slowly spins around. A towel rack appears and a mean-looking buff towel hangs from it]
GS-401
[deep voice] Don't forget to bring a towel!
[Tynacorp, outside. Shadows appear in the brush across the way. The commander is there with his troops, the boys, and Towelie]
COMMANDER
Alright, boys, take the towel back in there and say your mission was accomplished. [hands a disk to Stan] Then upload this encryption disk into their computers.
STAN
We're just going in to get our video game back.
COMMANDER
If anything goes wrong, use this newly-developed photon rifle. [hands it to Kyle]
KYLE
Photon rifle, whatever. [the boys enter Tynacorp with Towelie.]
[Tynacorp command center. The boys walk through the center slowly]
STAN
Hello? Hello, anybody here? [GS-401 hops down from the rafters]
GS-401
Welcome to the party, boys! [flexes and rushes Towelie] HAAARRRHHHH!! [the two towels wrestle a bit]
TOWELIE
Oooh. Ooohh! Oh boy.
GS-401
HAAARRRHHHH!! [Kyle fires the photon rifle and knocks the beefier towel away with the beam. The research team and security force pour into the room angrily]
RESEARCH LEADER
So, you thought you could outsmart us, did you kids?
COMMANDER
[he and his troops pour in another door] Aaaaarrrr. Move move move move move move! [the two forces face each other, with the boys and Towelie in the middle] Don't make a move, you bastards!
RESEARCH LEADER
Bring the towel here, boys. They can't shoot children.
COMMANDER
Don't listen to them. They lied to you before.
RESEARCH LEADER
Oh yes, boys. Obey your government! Well perhaps it's time these boys knew what was really gong on!
STAN
Ohmigod, look! [in front of a monitor connected to a long table is the Okama GameSphere the boys had been wanting to get back. The boys rush to it]
KYLE
Our GameSphere! [the boys each get a controller and activate the GameSphere: "Okama GameSphere"]
STAN
Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays. [behind him, Towelie exits screen left as the two forces face each other. The boys quickly get lost in the game play]
RESEARCH LEADER
[turns to look at the boys] You see boys, I'm afraid you were double-crossed. If they were the military, why wouldn't they just attack us to begin with? Because they're not the military!
COMMANDER
Alright, maybe we lied to you, but it was to protect your own skin! We are a resistance group pretending to be the military to bring Tynacorp down!
CARTMAN
Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level.
KYLE
Sweet!
COMMANDER
[now facing the research leader] But perhaps we should show these kids who Tynacorp really is made up of. Go on! Tell them why you've been making towels! Zytar! [pulls at the research leader's head and the face comes off. Under it a green fish-alien head appears]
STAN
Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny!
ZYTAR
Our planet was dying! We had no choice but to find a new one! Manufacturing Smart Towels was our way to spy on humans to see how they lived.
COMMANDER
[looks at the boys] And now you know the horrible truth, boys.
ZYTAR
Truth or no, your alien-murdering group is over! [fires a gun at the commander. Both sides begin to fire at each other and there are casualties on both sides. Zytar and two guards slowly back away and out of view]
CARTMAN
Could you turn it up?
COMMANDER
Boys, try to reach the core override! We've got no choice but to try to take them all out! [the boys continue playing their game, so the commander comes up and reaches for the encryption disk in Stan's pocket, then goes away. Towelie sits on the floor with a huge bong, getting high. The commander reappears across the room moving towards a red button] I think I can get it from here, boys!
ZYTAR
[returns] What are you doing? You'll kill us all!
COMMANDER
Sorry, Zytar. Didn't your mom ever tell you? Don't mess with earthlings. [inserts the disk and a huge explosion blows the boys out of the room.]
BOYS
Oooww! [Then it blows out the roof and some sides of the main building, and the boys find themselves hanging from Towelie, above a boiling tank of acid]
CARTMAN
Hup hup. Come on, hang on. [Stan and Kyle moan]
STAN, KYLE
Whoa.
KENNY
(Help help! Heeelllppp!) [loses his grip on Kyle]
CARTMAN
Kenny!
KENNY
(Nooo!) [falls into the acid tank, disintegrating and sinking. Kyle looks on, but next to him is the GameSphere]
KYLE
[sees it] Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer! [above him, Stan watches large pieces of metal fall to the ground]
STAN
Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart! [Kyle swings ever closer to the GameSphere]
GS-401
[walks in on an adjacent catwalk and sees Towelie with the boys hanging] What are you doing?
TOWELIE
Get away from me, you evil towel!
GS-401
Towelie, listen to me. Let them go. Drop them.
TOWELIE
No way! They're my friends!
GS-401
They aren't your friends! Humans have ruined the planet, killed off their own environment! Their time is over. It is the towels' turn now.
KYLE
[swings closer] I've almost got it!
GS-401
You're going to let them go, Towelie! Because... I know your weakness. [holds out a joint. Towelie looks at it longingly] Here. You can reach it. Come on, Towelie! How long has it been since you've had a nice burn, huh?! Twenty, thirty seconds?!
STAN
[feels Towelie slip] Aw, crap!
GS-401
You're going to have to choose between their lives, and, getting high.
TOWELIE
You asshole.
CARTMAN
Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there!
GS-401
Come, Towelie! Make your decision!
TOWELIE
I-I-I choose... I-I-I choose... both! [Stan is shocked at the answer. Towelie stretches enough to take a puff while holding on to the boys, then slips enough for Kyle to succeed]
KYLE
I got it! [grabs the GameSphere. Towelie pulls himself and the boys up to the catwalk in front of a door. An explosion behind GS-401 sends it into the air]
GS-401
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [floats down into the acid and disintegrates]
STAN
Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!
KYLE, TOWELIE
Alright!
CARTMAN
Hooray!
[Stan's house, night. The boys are gathered before the TV playing their Okama GameSphere with a new player: Towelie.]
STAN
Oh, dude, we finished level 50!
KYLE
Awesome!
TOWELIE
Oh, man, I have no idea what's goin' on.
KYLE
Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.
STAN
Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level.
TOWELIE
[heavily slurred] Don't forget to bring a towel. [the boys laugh]
CARTMAN
You're the worst character ever, Towelie.
TOWELIE
I know.

synopsis:The kids of South Park have raised money to send to children of Afghanistan, but the Government believes the Afghani children's thank you gift is contaminated with Anthrax and the boys are forced to take it back to Afghanistan.

script:Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants

[Bus stop, day. The four boys stand at the bus stop waiting for the bus. Each of them wears a gas mask. The boys are silent.]
KYLE
...Remember when life used to be simple and cool?
CARTMAN
...Not really.
BUTTERS
[runs up] Uh, hey! [The boys jump, startled] How's it goin', fellas?
STAN
Butters, what the hell are you doing?
BUTTERS
Huh, well, I'm just standin' around bein' a kid. Why? How come you're all wearing those spooky spaceman masks?
KYLE
These are gas masks, Butters!
STAN
Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax!
BUTTERS
What?! [frightened] Oh, Jesus! I don't wanna get the 'thrax, fellas! Uh, what do I do?
STAN
There's nothing you can do except stop breathing.
BUTTERS
Stop breathin'?
KYLE
Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe.
BUTTERS
Well. Alright, then. [takes in a big gulp of air and holds his breath hard. His head goes cock-eyed. A few seconds later, the bus pulls up. The kids on the bus and Ms. Crabtree wear gas masks as well. Officer Barbrady, wearing a gas mask, gets out of the bus to inspect the boys' backpacks. The boys, including Butters, line up before him, and he inspects Stan's backpack. He pokes at it in a few places and then gives it back to Stan. Butters begins turning blue]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well okay. Next? [Stan boards the bus and Kyle steps up, giving his backpack to Barbrady. He inspects the backpack quickly and returns it to Kyle] Next? [Kyle boards the bus and Kenny steps up, giving his backpack to Barbrady. He inspects the backpack and pulls out some magazines...] Let's see: Hotties, Juicy, Whoppers... [returns the magazines and backpack to Kenny, who quickly boards the bus. Cartman walks up.] Okay, next? [Cartman hands him the backpack and Barbrady quickly pulls out some scissors in it] A-ha! What the hell are you doin' with this?!
CARTMAN
Those are my Hootie Owlie Round-Tip Scissors.
OFFICER BARBRADY
These are a weapon! [holds the scissors aloft, away from Cartman]
CARTMAN
Awww, come onnn! How am I gonna kill people with those?
OFFICER BARBRADY
I'll think of a way. Now move along!
CARTMAN
God-damnit! [boards the bus without his scissors]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Alright, next! [No one steps up. Butters is quite blue now and just stands there. Then he just faints forward] Okay, clear. [the bus starts up, Barbrady boards it, and away it goes.]
[South Park Elementary, morning. Along with the regular flag on the flagpole, a larger flag is draped over the front of the school, covering some second-story windows and the center of the school sign. Inside, the kids filter into class and drop off their gas masks along the wall. The door has been fitted with an industrial lock. Tweek enters and locks the door]
TWEEK
[drops off his mask] Oh, Jesus, man! They're gonna get me! [sits down] Oh Christ! [under his breath] they might - could get me.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright class, as some of you may have heard, the President has asked that American children all send one dollar to the children of Afghanistan. [holds up a sheet of paper with writing on it] So I have a list of addresses and we're goin' to all chip in.
CARTMAN
HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those towelheads!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Eric, the Afghan people need our help!
CARTMAN
Oh, I'm sorry, but I thought we were at war with these assholes!
WENDY
We're at war with terrorists, fatass, not with Afghanistan! And the only reason that you care is that you don't wanna give up the dollar!
CARTMAN
That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just get a regular milk for ten cents? [cue soft music. Cartman stands on his seat] Now look, it isn't our fault that terrorists hate us. We're just kids. We're not the ones bombing them now, we're- we're just kids. [now standing on his desk] There's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world, but, we're caught in the middle. It's not our fault.
WENDY
The Afghan kids are caught in the middle, too!
CARTMAN
Yes, but they're sand monkeys!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright, children, we are all sending a dollar to the kids in Afghanistan! That's it! End of discussion!
CARTMAN
[drops into his seat angrily] God-damnit, I hate regular milk!!!
[Afghanistan, day. Adults mill around as fighter planes fly by and bomb a few buildings. Two boys enter from the left and face the camera. They begin Speaking in Dari Persian]
AFGHAN STAN
(تمام روز ما را بمباران کنند؟ "Are they gonna be bombing us all day?"
AFGHAN KYLE (NAMED "AKMARH SHULUR")
.هواشناسی گفته هوا که بارونی شه، بعد از ظهر هم خوب می‌شه "The weather guy has said if it rains, it's gonna be OK in the afternoon."
AFGHAN CARTMAN
!هی! من اینجا هیچی پیدا نمی‌کنم بخورم "Hey, I can't find anything to eat here!"
[Afghan Kenny (named Keyvan) says something incomprehensible. Probably suggesting playing basketball.]
[They move off to play some basketball at a nearby makeshift ball court. The boy who was the first to speak gives the ball to his friend, the second to speak. The friend shoots the basket, but a bomb falls on the backboard, launching the ball away from the court and destroying the backboard and pole]
AFGHAN BOYS
Awww!
AFGHAN STAN
.حالا پاشو بریم فیلم ببینیم "Well, let's go watch a movie."
[then the four move off to their right. They pay for their tickets and head for the doors. A bomb falls on the theater and blows it up]
Awww!
AFGHAN STAN
حالا چی کار می‌خوایم بکنیم؟ "What do we do now?"
AFGHAN KYLE
پاشو بریم خونه‌ی ما بازی کنیم. کاری نمی‌تونیم بکنیم که. "Let's go play at my house. There's nothing else we can do. See guys, my parents are home.
[A bomb falls on the house and blows it up]
AFGHAN BOYS
Awww!
AFGHAN KYLE
من خیلی متنفرم وقتی بمب می‌اندازن"I hate it when they drop bombs."
AFGHAN KENNY
حالا چی کار کنیم؟ "What do we do now?"
[A horse-drawn small SUV pulls up, a man comes out and drops off four letters, one for each boy, and gets back into the driver's seat. The SUV pulls away and the boys look at their letters. As dramatic music plays, the Kyle counterpart opens his letter up, looks inside, flips it over, and lets a dollar float down from it. The other three boys do the same. Akmarh looks at the bill, then up at the death and destruction surrounding the boys, and it's apparent that $4 won't do much to repair any of it. Akmarh looks at the bill again and wonders what to do with it.]
[The Marsh house, day. The garage has a large flag draping the door. Inside, on the living room couch. Sharon is lying there covered with blankets and watching TV. On the floor around the sofa are bowls, candles, food, and other items. Sharon hasn't been off that couch in a while.]
REPORTER
[on TV] Another high-alert status for terrorists activity this weekend. [SNN - America Fights Back. A news ticker crawls by. Major headlines appear to the left, stock quotes on top, weather forecasts under the crawl] The government said "bad things are likely to happen." [the door bell rings] Meanwhile, the world continues to back down from their support of the United States [dingle] saying that they were really only kidding to begin with.
STAN
[approaching] Hey Mom, door bell's ringin'.
SHARON
Can huh get th'ere 'or me? [Stan goes to open the door.]
RANDY
[approaching through the kitchen, stops at the kitchen door] Hey, Sharon? Maybe you should stop watchin' the news for a little bit? [Sharon mutters something] Shu-Sharon, you've been watching CNN for about ah... eight weeks now. Don't you wanna watch somethin' else? [the door closes] Shu-Shu-Sharon? [Stan comes back into view, pulling a box a bit bigger than he is into the living room]
STAN
Hey, look at what the postman brought me! It's a big brown package from Afghanistan!
SHARON
Weh, that's nahice.
STAN
We sent the Afghani kids some dollars - they must have sent us something cool in return! [looks back at Randy] Do you have some scissors to get this open?
RANDY
Stanley, your mother's a little freaked out right now. Why don't you go play with your big brown package from Afghanistan outside?
STAN
Well alright. [pushes the package back towards the front door. Randy returns to the kitchen... Sharon bolts from the sofa as Randy rushes back into the living room]
RANDY, SHARON
Big brown package from Afghanistan??!!
[The Marsh house, night. Paramedics, fire trucks, the SWAT team, and the FBI are all there. Two klieg lights shine on the package as two Hazmat men approach the package. A crowd of residents looks on. Stan, Cartman and Kenny watch from the front.]
KYLE
[approaching] Dude, what's going on?
STAN
We got a package from the kids we sent dollars to. They sent us something back.
HAZMAT MAN
[in white] Prelims show negative, sir.
OFFICIAL
Then we're gonna have to blow it!
TWO SWAT MEN
[in gray] Yes sir!! [they leave and rig the box so it opens without much damage]
TWEEK
AAHH! This is it, man! It's over!
RICHARD
Tweek, calm down. Have some coffee. [Tweek looks up at Richard. The two SWAT members finish and return to the crowd. Everyone kneels behind the barriers and then cover their heads.]
OFFICIAL
Open! [one of the SWAT officers presses the remote control and the box pops open. Inside is a goat]
GOAT
Mma-a-a-a-a-a-a. [people begin to look up at the goat]
STAN
Oh, it's just a goat. [all rise]
PEOPLE
Oohhh.
BLOND MAN
Look, it's a goat.
MAN 1
Awww.
BRUNET MAN
A precious goat.
GOAT
Ba-a-a-a-a. [Stan approaches it as soft music plays]
STAN
[now next to the goat] Hey there, little guy.
OFFICIAL
[steps forward] Stay away from it! Terrorists could have given that goat anthrax or smallpox before sending it over! Johnson!! [another official steps forward and salutes] Check the goat for diseases!
JOHNSON
Yes sir! [walks over to the goat and begins licking its face. Stan backs away. After a few licks Johnson rises and announces] The goat seems to be clean, sir!
STAN
I told you: those Afghan kids just wanted to give us something back for giving them four dollars.
CARTMAN
Heh, four dollars for a goat? We got ripped off.
OFFICIAL
Alright, men, this area is secure. Let's head out! [the various services disperse and drive away in their vehicles. ]
KYLE
Well what are we supposed to do with it?
GOAT
Ba-a-a-a-a.
STAN
Yu- you're gonna have to take it home with you, Kyle.
KYLE
Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster.
STAN
Kenny?
KENNY
(No fuckin' way, dude!)
STAN
My parents will never let me keep a goat
CARTMAN
Well, I guess we're gonna have to kill it.
STAN
No, we're not gonna kill it, Cartman! We'll just have to [removes the return address from the box] take the return address and mail it back to the kids in Afghanistan. Come on, goat. [takes the goat's reins and leads it away. The other boys follow]
GOAT
Ba-a-a-a-a.
[Downtown South Park, night. All building windows have flags draped behind them, and some of the walls have flags on them as well. The post office has two flags on wall-mounted poles. The last postal worker closes up for the night as the boys approach]
KYLE
Uh oh, they're closing!
STAN
Excuse me, we wanna overnight this goat to Afghanistan, please?
POSTMAN
Excuse me?
CARTMAN
It's an Afghanistan goat, so it can't stay here, or else it'll choke on the sweet air of freedom.
KYLE
Yeah.
POSTMAN
Afghanistan? [cautions] H-I'm sorry boys, but our planes aren't flying there.
STAN
They're not.
GOAT
Ma-a-a-a-a-a-a.
POSTMAN
The only planes goin' to Afghanistan are the military planes over at the base. I'm sorry. [walks away]
STAN
Well yeah! The military planes. Come on, goat, we'll put you on one of them. [leads the goat away. The others stand there for a second, then catch up to them]
KYLE
[calls out] Stan, I don't think we're supposed to be in the military base. They might shoot us.
STAN
I don't care! We're going!
TOWELIE
[dropping in] Don't forget to bring a towel.
THE BOYS
Aaagh!
CARTMAN
Oh no, not Towelie.
TOWELIE
When goin' someplace new, you should always bring a towel.
STAN
Okay, thanks, Towelie. [rolls his eyes]
TOWELIE
Do you wanna get high?
CARTMAN
[quickly] No, we don't wanna get high!!
TOWELIE
You mean, you don't want Towelie around?
CARTMAN
That's right!
TOWELIE
So am I to understand that there's been a ...Towelie ban?... [snorts and starts laughing]
THE BOYS
[not amused. Kyle covers his eyes] Awww!
STAN
Goddamnit, get the hell out of here, Towelie!
TOWELIE
Alright, see ya. [walks off]
[The military base, night. Jeeps roll in as a battalion is assembled in the parking lot. A large cargo plane receives the vehicles and other cargo]
GENERAL
Alright, troops. We depart for Afghanistan in five minutes! Let's move out!
STAN
[now in the base with the others] Alright, come on. We just gotta get the goat on one of these planes.
SOLDIER 1
[off-screen] Isn't this exciting, Tony? [the boys hide behind some boxes nearby] We're finally gonna see some action.
TONY
[the soldiers, in desert fatigues, appear] Yeah, and uh, I hear that as soon as we land we get a USO show.
SOLDIER 1
We do! [draws close] Stevie Nicks is goin' to perform.
TONY
Hoh, Stevie Nicks. Huh, I love her! [they move on]
STAN
[peeks out] Okay, it's clear. Come on! [moves out with the goat and the other boys. A shadow falls across them]
SOLDIER
[off screen] Hey you!
TONY
[aims his rifle at the boys] What the hell do you think you're doing here?!
GOAT
...Ba-a-a-a-a.
TONY
[chastened, quickly retracts the rifle] H-uh, I'm sorry, Miss Nicks, uh. [looks around] Hey guys, this is Stevie Nicks. [a black soldier walks up]
SOLDIER 2
Oh wow!
GOAT
...Ma-a-a-a-a.
SOLDIER 3
Uh, can I get a picture?
SOLDIER 4
Miss Nicks. Over here, Miss Nicks! [takes a picture]
GOAT
...Ma-a-a-a-a.
TONY
Oh... M- Miss Nicks, I... I don't wanna bother you, but... could you sing a quick Fleetwood Mac for us. Could ya?
OTHER SOLDIERS
Oh yeah. Please. Come on, come on. Please. Yeah.
GOAT
...Ma-a-a-a-a. Ma-a-a-a-a.
SOLDIERS
Oh! No way! That was wild! That was great!
SOLDIER 3
Wait till I tell my sister about this; she is gonna flip!
STAN
Well, uh, we've gotta get Miss Nicks on the plane to Afghanistan, guys.
TONY
Oh, can we just get a-
STAN
[turns right and walks off] Ah, sorry. Miss Nicks isn't answering any more questions.
TONY
Oh, sure, we understand. Move along. [the soldiers watch the goat walk away with the boys]
SOLDIER 3
...She looks great.
TONY
She looks great.
[Cargo plane, later. The boys walk up to the plane with the goat and prepare to put in in the cargo hold. A side door is open, with a ramp leading up to the hold]
STAN
'K, let's put him on here. [walks up the ramp, pushing the goat along]
GOAT
[inside the hold] Ma-a-a-a-a.
STAN
[enters and soothes the goat] Shhh. There we go. You're gonna be okay, goat. You'll be back in Afghanistan in about 20 hours.
CARTMAN
[he and the other two peek in] Stan, if you're finished having your tearful goodbye with the goat, we'd like to go now, please?
PILOT
Alright, tango clear. [lifts the ramp up and swings it into the cargo hold...]
THE BOYS
Waaah!
PILOT
Let's head out. [...then closes the door and walks to the cockpit. The boys drop into the hold]
CARTMAN
[turns around and wrestles with the door] Aw, son of a bitch!
KYLE
[gets up, turns, and pounds at the door] Hey, wait! There are children in here!
KENNY
[rises and moves a bit] (Oh, shit, we're locked in.)
GOAT
[inside the hold] Ma-a-a-a-a.
STAN
Dude, looks like we're going tooh... Afghanistan.
KYLE
[steps toward Stan] Going to Afghanistan? Locked in a small space for 20 hours? How could things get any worse? [poot. Cartman blinks tightly and smiles]
BOYS
Awww! [Kyle covers his nose, Kenny draws his hoodstring tight]
KENNY
(Ee-hew-hoo!)
CARTMAN
[giggles] Uh ho, you guys.
[Afghanistan, next day. A cargo plane has landed and the camera pans from the plane to the runway behind it. Another cargo plane lands and rolls to a stop. The large cargo door drops down and the soldiers file out marching]
GENERAL
Welcome to Afghanistan, troops! Get your gear ready and report to the barracks at o-nine hundred!
SOLDIERS
Sir yes sir! [they march away. The pilot comes, opens up the small side door, and pulls down the ramp. The boys move out and go down the ramp with their jackets over their noses]
KYLE
Oh God, it was horrible!
STAN
Twenty hours!
KENNY
(God-damn, it stinks like shit!)
GOAT
Ma-a-a-a-a! [leaps out and runs off]
PILOT
What the hell?
KYLE
Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for 20 hours!
CARTMAN
It didn't smell that bad; you guys are overreacting.
PILOT
[leans in and sniffs] I don't smell any- boh! Oh God! [begins choking] Hohhgh! [looks away] Blagh! [convulses] Bleeaagghh [throws up twice and passes out]
CARTMAN
Uh, whatever!
KYLE
You sonofabitch, Cartman! [begins to walk away, passing Cartman] You don't fart when you're locked in a small space with other people! [Stan passes by]
CARTMAN
Oh, I'm sorry! Next time I'll just ask my fart nicely if it wouldn't mind staying tucked away for a while!
STAN
[finds the goat next to Kenny] Alright alright, let's just get the goat back to his home! [pulls out the return address] We have to find this address. [leads the goat off. The other boys follow]
GOAT
Ma-a-a-a-a.
[A large city in Afghanistan, day. Could be Kabul. Plenty of large building and roads abound, but they all look rundown or beat down - this is a city in decay. The boys walk through the city]
CARTMAN
God, what a craphole, dude! This is like East Denver! Jesus Chru-heist!
KYLE
Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this! If I grew up here, I'd be pissed off, too!
STAN
Hey look! There's a taxi! [horse-drawn, with small back tires. The boys head for it, passing a street performer.]
PERFORMER
[raises his hands] Haa-aa-aa. [the boys into the taxi's back seat]
STAN
[to the driver] Hello. We need to go... [hands the driver the address] here. [the driver says: شما می‌خواین برین خونه؟ "You guys wanna go home?" and whips the horse into action. The taxi moves off]
CARTMAN
What is this? The freakin' Flintstones?
[The home of the Afghan boys. The taxi pulls up and drops the South Park boys off, then goes away. The boys approach the door]
KYLE
Is this the right house?
STAN
I think so. [steps up and knocks on the door]
AKMARH
[approaches and opens the door] شما چیزی می‌فروشید؟ "You guys selling something?"
STAN
A-ah, hi. We're from America. [Akmarh simply looks back] Uh, we sent you the dollar? Uh, the four dollars? You, you sent us this goat?
AKMARH
Goat? [the other Afghan boys show up behind Akmarh]
GOAT
Ma-a-a-a-a.
STAN
Here. Wu-we don't want it.
AKMARH
Oh, you want something else? All we had was the goat. Your country bombed everything else.
STAN
No, dude, we're n- we're not ungrateful. It's just... none of us can keep the goat.
CARTMAN
It was choking on the sweet air of freedom in America, so we brought it back to your crappy country. [the Afghan boys are insulted]
STAN
Oh uh, and here. [pulls out a small flag] Take this American flag as... a gift. [hands it to Akmarh and backs up. Akmarh considers the gift for a few moments, then throws it on the ground and steps back. The fat kid moves up and pours some fuel on it, then the poor kid strikes a match and throws it on the fuel, setting the flag on fire.]
AFGHAN BOYS
Yaaay. [they jump up and down]
KYLE
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
STAN
Yeah, they told us in school that everyone but terrorists love America.
FAT BOY
Huh! !آمریکایی‌ها با خوک می‌خوابن Americans are pig fuckers!
CARTMAN
What did you call us?!
AKMARH
Your country is the evil empire! Your government wants to rule the world! But your values and your spirituality are in the guh-ter!
KYLE
Then why did you send us the goat?
BOY IN BLUE VEST
Because, in Afghanistan, we have pride. If you send us something, we must send something in return.
AKMARH
It doesn't mean we don't still hate you. Now, get out of here! [the Afghan boys back up and Akmarh shuts the door]
STAN
Hey! Hey, open the door!
CARTMAN
I told you! Jawas have no heart.
KYLE
Jawas?
CARTMAN
You know, sand people.
STAN
How come they hate America so much? What the hell did we do?
GOAT
Ma-a-a-a-a.
KYLE
Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates Americans, we'd better just leave the goat and get back to the plane!
STAN
Alright. [leads the others away. The goat follows. Stan hears the hoofbeats and stops] Oh look, he's following us. It's so sad.
CARTMAN
[softly] God, I hate you so much, Stan!
STAN
What? [voices rise in the distance (مرگ بر آمریکا! مرگ بر آمریکا "Down with USA" or "Death to America"! The boys look on. The protesters march by the boys and stop, curious about the boys standing there. Stan greets them] Howdy. [the protesters remain motionless]
KYLE
Um... [looks around, then slowly] Greetings from Canada. [now with Canadian accent] Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it?
CARTMAN
Ey, what the hell are you talking about?! [Stan and Kyle look at Cartman angrily] I'm not a god-damned Canadian, and neither are you!
STAN
[buries his face in his hand in disgust and shakes it] Cartman, you stupid asshole! [the crowd roars with anger and ties the four boys and the goat up. Two of the protesters talk about what to do next. One of them ends with]
PROTESTER
...Osama bin Laden! [the others crack up and lead the captives away]
KYLE
Good job, fatass!
CARTMAN
Dude, don't call me a Canadian! [the protesters lead the captives up a mountain road. A bird in a tree warbles an Arabic song. When the lead protester reaches the tree he shoots the bird, and the bird falls down and away, dead. The trek resumes]
[A cave in Afghanistan, day. "Not where Osama bin Laden is." Guards stand outside keeping watch. Inside, six guards interrogate the boys]
STAN
You've gotta listen to me! We're not spies! [one of the guards says something]
CARTMAN
Look, I think I can explain everything. You see, my friend Stan here is an oversensitive animal lover. He's got a boner for this goat, a-
VOICE
Amaar madmallah [the guards look up, then line up at either side of the cave entrance. A lanky figure walks in]
OSAMA BIN LADEN
[swaying as he walks in] Oooo, alamalamalamalaah.
KYLE
Oh crap, it's him!
GOAT
Ma-a-a-a-a.
OSAMA BIN LADEN
[pacing before the boys] Amalama hamahamahama? [draws close to Cartman] Una Haqa mala
CARTMAN
[leaning away] Ogh! Dude, it's called deodorant, okay? It's not expensive.
OSAMA BIN LADEN
Haqaama hamahalahamahaqa. [the guards move off and return with studio equipment - two spot lights and television camera. The cameraman announces that they're ready to tape (!اوساما خان، حاضره "Osama sir, we're ready.". Osama sways over to his spot. The cameraman gives a signal and several makeup artists rush in for some quick touch-ups, then leave. The cameraman gets behind the camera and gives the signal to start talking] U bataqataqaa maladala. Ameriqa la tabakabaka haka haqadaqadaqa [laughs] Haqahaqa, daaqadaqa!
CAMERAMAN
Aaaaand... cut! [Osama grins and the guards clap. Osama takes a small bow and tosses the mic away, then walks off]
STAN
Dude, these people are insane.
[The Marsh house, night. Sharon has resumed watching SNN on the sofa]
SNN REPORTER
...as more and more case of terrorist-related AIDS continues to grow. And this just in: the Taliban has apparently taken American civilians as hostages. The Taliban has just released this videotape [the boys and the goat in their chairs, flanked by two Taliban guards], in which it is clearly visible that they have indeed captured [closeup of the goat, with Kenny to the left] Stevie Nicks. Miss Nicks appears to be in good spirits, though her whereabouts are unknown.
RANDY
[pops in from the kitchen] Hey, Sh- Sharon? Ha- have you seen Stan in the last couple... days?
SHARON
[raises her head a bit] Yes. I just saw him.
RANDY
Oh okay. [slowly moves back into the kitchen]
[Afghanistan, day. The general and his troops are watching the same report]
SNN REPORTER
With Stevie Nicks in captivity, the other members of Fleetwood Mac have been hidden so the Taliban can't get to them as well. [the soldiers are crestfallen]
TONY
They... took Stevie Nicks?
SOLDIER 2
Bastards! Heartless, gutless bastards!
GENERAL
Alright men! Grab your guns and your Bibles! We are going to get Miss Nicks back!
SOLDIERS
[cheering] Hooray!!! [some of them have their arms raised]
[The Afghan boys' home, at that moment]
SNN REPORTER
The Taliban's video also shows what appears to be four American children in captivity, though they could just be French.
AKMARH
[rising] We have to help them.
FAT BOY
Do you say??
AKMARH
They are not espies. They came to give us our goat back.
BOY IN BLUE VEST
Screw them! They are evil Americans!
AKMARH
I know! But if we don't help the innocent ones, then we are no better than the Americans are.
FAT BOY
Help the Americans? That doesn't make sense.
AKMARH
Dude, we are espeaking English right now. Does that make sense??
BOY IN BLUE VEST
Alright, let's go. [they pick up their rifles and exit]
FAT BOY
!ای لعنت "Oh, goddammit!"
[Osama's cave, day. Inside, at table, the Taliban guards are celebrating Osama's birthday. The guards and Osama wear party hats]
OSAMA BIN LADEN
Aw, jihad, jihad. [the boys look at each other for reactions, and the alarms go off] Oh? [walks over to his security screen and sees the Americans converging outside the cave entrance, then runs around unsure what to do] Oh, oh! Ameriqa haqa haqa! Dursha! Dapadapadapa! [the guards respond and give each other orders while moving out. Osama pulls out a walkie-talkie and speaks into it] Hulagugla hugagugahagahaa!
[Outside Osama's cave, day. The American and Taliban forces engage each other in combat.]
[Inside Osama's cave. Osama is still giving orders]
OSAMA BIN LADEN
Qubada durqaana Ameriqanab! Qubada durqaana- [a grill next to the boys rises, and the Afghan boys climb out]
STAN
Hey, what are you guys doing here?
OSAMA BIN LADEN

BOY IN BLUE VEST
Shh. We've come to save you.
KYLE
But I thought you hate us.
BOY IN BLUE VEST
We do. [Osama talks away, and the boys slip out quietly with the goat. Cartman decides not to join them, and walks towards Osama]
KYLE
Cartman, where are you going??
CARTMAN
I'm gonna go take care of this prick!
KYLE
Cartman, he's crazy!
CARTMAN
He's not crazy, he's an idiot. I know how to deal with these people. [walks off]
OSAMA BIN LADEN
A flippity flappity floop! Jihad jihad!
CARTMAN
Mehah... [bites on some food] What's up, bin Laden?
OSAMA BIN LADEN
Arrrrrrrrrrrubadubaduba! Durbadurba haq!
CARTMAN
Uh oh, 5:30, time to pray. [quickly rushes for a prayer rug and rolls it out, then kneels and bows deeply a few times.] Allah, Allah, m'heh
OSAMA BIN LADEN
Taba haqa?? [goes for his prayer rug and does as Cartman does] Allah Allah Allah, Allah hakadurrpa durpa adurpa hagalah [Cartman brings out a huge mallet and smashes it on Osama's head. Osama's head rings like a bell, then he looks at Cartman and aims his shotgun at him]
CARTMAN
Uh oh! Mmm-mm! [kisses Osama and tumbles away]
[Outside Osama's cave, day. The American and Taliban forces are still fighting. The seven kids and the goat emerge from the cave]
AKMARH
We will have to be quick! The Americans are attacking!
KYLE
Where do we go? [they look around]
AKMARH
Get down! [all boys hit the floor and hide their faces. A bomb blows up in front of them. When the smoke clears, Kenny and the poor Afghan boy are both dead, both riddled with bullets]
BOY IN BLUE VEST
!اوه الله! کشتن کیوانو "Oh, my God! They killed Keyvan!"
AKMARH
!تو، دیوث "You bastards!" [Stan and Kyle look at each other. Akmarh gets his rifle and fires away at American helicopters] You... murdering Americaaans!!
STAN
Hey, shut up, kid. America didn't start this war.
AKMARH
America DID eh-start this war! They eh-started it YEARS ago, when they put their military bases on Muslim holy lands!
[A forest near the cave, at that moment. Osama bin Laden slinks around looking for Cartman. He stops next to a small bush. As bin Laden looks around the bush skittles away, then stops. Bin Laden sees the bush has moved and growls at it, aims his rifle, and walks up to it - four steps. The bush moves again, then stops. Bin Laden catches up in three steps. The bush moves again, then bin Laden tales a step forward. The bush moves again, then bin Laden tales another step forward. The bush leaps and bin Laden holds it in mid-air as Cartman drops to the ground. We get a view of the gun on Cartman's face from Cartman's perspective]
OSAMA BIN LADEN
[tossing the bush away] Ramadan!
CARTMAN
Hey look! An infidel! [bin Laden quickly turns around]
OSAMA BIN LADEN
Wuut? Peitoqaba! [Cartman gets up and pulls bin Laden's pants down. Osama looks stunned. A magnifying glass pops up over bin Laden's genitals, then another, then another... nine in all, and the penis is finally visible. A sign pops up... "Tiny, ain't it?" A few seconds later the sign and magnifiers go down and Osama pulls his pants up]
CARTMAN
So that's what this is all about?
OSAMA BIN LADEN
Ishta fatwa open sesame!
CARTMAN
[climbs up bin Laden and kisses him] Mmmm! Tastes like chicken. The ass of a chicken!
OSAMA BIN LADEN
Proila foqabam!
CARTMAN
Woohoo! [zips away, leaving a dust cloud front of bin Laden. Bin Laden gives chase, leaving his own dust cloud.]
[Outside Osama's cave, day. The fighting continues. Amid the fighting, the general crosses the battlefield.]
GENERAL
We're coming, Miss Nicks! Hang on!
GOAT
Ma-a-a-a! Ma-a-a-a!
[Outside Osama's cave, day. The South Park boys line up opposite the Afghan boys. Stan faces Akmarh, Kyle faces the boy in blue vest.]
KYLE
All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan like America.
BOY IN BLUE VEST
And you believe it? It is not just the Taliban that hates America. Over a third of the world hates America!
STAN
But why? Why does a third of the world hate us?
BOY IN BLUE VEST
Because, you don't realize that a third of the world hates you!!!
STAN
[considers the argument...] ...That doesn't make sense. You guys are just buttholes!
AKMARH
You're butt-holes!
STAN, KYLE
You're buttholes!
[Outside Osama's cave, day. Osama and Cartman are now out in the open desert. Osama resumes slinking around]
FEMALE VOICE
Youhoo.
[it's Cartman seated on a camel, dressed in a purple chador. Bin laden takes one look and he goes nuts over what he sees. His eyes bug out as he goes horizontal]
CARTMAN
Haduqaduqaduqa. [Osama's tongue has rolled out to the floor. He tugs it and it rolls up like a classroom projection screen] Huqadukadukadukaduuu. [Osama whistles and then lustily howls like a wolf as he stomps his foot down on the ground. Cartman hops off the camel, walks some distance, and bats his eyes at bin Laden. Osama takes big steps towards Cartman, and the camera alternates between the two. Bin Laden stops short of Cartman... and leaps over him, landing on the camel's neck. Bin Laden starts kissing the camel all over, and Cartman removes his veil, looks at bin Laden, then looks at the camera]
OSAMA BIN LADEN
[on bended knee] Oh bella, bella falafel. [brings out a bouquet of flowers]
Mi amore. Fatwa, fatwa. [Cartman holds up a sign with a screw and a baseball on it, then puts it away. Bin Laden hops away, then returns with a table, two chairs, two glasses and some wine, and sets up a table for two. He sets the camel down on one chair and sits on the other one opposite the camel. He then serves up some glasses of wine]
Ahh, de vino! Mi fatwa! J'ai une fatwa! [Cartman holds up four other signs: a jack and donkey, a pile of feces and a bald head, a rooster and lollipop, and Barbra Streisand]
[Outside Osama's cave, day. The boys have moved away from the cave entrance, and the fat Afghan boy has rejoined them. Beyond them the two forces continue fighting]
KYLE
Do you really think your civilization is better than ours?! You people play games by killing animals, and oppress women!
BOY IN BLUE VEST
It's better than a civilization that spends its time watching millionaires walk down the red carpet at the Emmys!
STAN
...He's got us there, dude. [pan out to see more fighting]
TONY
[finds the goat and picks it up] I got her. I got Stevie Nicks. [carries it away. The Americans retreat, but continue firing away]
GOAT
Me-e-e-eh.
[Nearby... Osama's grinning widely at the camel. Cartman walks up in a different costume - that of the fussy movie director.]
CARTMAN
There you are! Where have you been? We have another anti-American video to create! [hauls bin Laden away.]
OSAMA BIN LADEN
Oh, dapidiuta ako. [Bin laden manages a wave good-bye at the camel.]
CARTMAN
Hur-ry, get into wardrobe! [bin Laden goes behind the walll and changes clothes. Cartman taps his foot impatiently] Oh hur-ry up, will you hur-ry?! [bin Laden comes out dressed as Uncle Sam] Oh, you look marvelous, dahling.
OSAMA BIN LADEN
Haqa hamahama.
CARTMAN
Come on! The cameras are ready! [pulls bin Laden to his mark. Behind them, eight Taliban soldiers fire away at the Americans] Alright, there we go. Let's roll cameras. [walks off and returns with a director's megaphone and a firecracker] Oh, and here's your microphone. [hands Osama the firecracker]
OSAMA BIN LADEN
[the Taliban soldiers see Uncle Sam and approach him] Ogh. America adirqadirqa- [looks around. The soldiers fire away at him. Bin Laden staggers, then looks at the object in his hand. Other Taliban soldiers rush in to see, and they all recognize whom they just shot.] Uh ohhh.
OSAMA AND THE TALIBAN SOLDIERS
HAAAAAAGH! [the firecracker explodes, killing all the soldiers around it. Only Osama is left there at the point of impact, sitting on the ground, with his teeth dangling like piano keys. They play a few notes]
GENERAL
We've done it! The Taliban is destroyed!
SOLDIERS
Hoorayyy!!
KYLE
Wow! I guess Cartman really did take care of them.
OSAMA BIN LADEN
[flaps his lips with his finger, making some noise] Terrorists is the craziest peoples. Eheeee! [shows his teeth. An American soldier walks up behind bin Laden and dispatches him with one last shot]
SOLDIER
I got him! I got him!
BOY IN BLUE VEST
Well, it looks like the Taliban and bin Laden are finally out of power.
AKMARH
Yeup, you don't need us anymore. [they turn and walk away]
STAN
Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys should know one thing. [the Afghan boys turn around] Most people in America are good people. We just try to live day by day, like you guys do. Maybe if you took some time to see all the great things about our country, you'd see... we're not so different after all.
KYLE
Yeah.
BOY IN BLUE VEST
That's fine. But we still hate you. [the Afghan boys turn and walk away again]
STAN
Oh... Well, I guess, maybe, someday, we can learn to... hate you too.
AKMARH
[the Afghan boys look again] Maybe. In time. [they turn once again and walk off]
KYLE
I'm confused.
[USO concert. The stage is set amid the pup tents and soldiers clamor around in the audience. "VICTORY!" The general takes the stage]
GENERAL
Great job, troops! Once again we have killed our enemies!
SOLDIER 5
[cheering] Hooray!
SOLDIER 6
Hooray! Yeah, we sure did!
GENERAL
The world is now safe, thanks to you. And so now, as promised, here is Fleetwood Mac with Stevie Nicks!
SOLDIERS
Whoa. Yeah. [the goat, dressed to look like Stevie Nicks, approaches the mic.]
FLEETWOOD MAC
Just like the wild winged bird sings a song-
Stand back, she's singin'.
GOAT
Maaa
FLEETWOOD MAC
Baby
GOAT
Maaa
FLEETWOOD MAC
Babe
GOAT
Maa-ha [the concert continues. The three boys watch the performance.]
STAN
Come on, let's go get to the plane. [turns left and walks away. The others follow. On the way there, Stan sees a flag on the ground and approaches it. He goes down on one knee, picks up the little flag, blows the dust off it, sets it into the ground, takes off his jacket, and wraps it around the base of the flag ]
KYLE
[approaching with Cartman] Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America.
STAN
No, dude. America may have some problems, but it's our home. Our team. And if you don't wanna root for your team, then you should get the hell out of the stadium.
KYLE
Yeah.
STAN
[rises, steps back, and salutes] Go America.
KYLE
[salutes] Go America. [lowers his right arm] Go Broncos. [moves off]
STAN
[follows] Yeah, go Broncos.
CARTMAN
Yeah. [follows the other two out]

synopsis:Cartman gets Kenny's school picture on every "missing child" milk carton in the country.

script:How to Eat with Your Butt

[South Park Elementary School Gym, day. Stan, without his hat, is seated on a stool, none too pleased, before a backdrop of a meadow. Behind the photographer are the kindergartners and Mr. Adler's class]
PHOTOGRAPHER
Okay, now lift your chin a little. [no change on Stan's face] Look right here. Right here. [points at the camera lens] Hey, where's my smile? Come on, I bet you got a smile for me. I-I'm startin' to see a smile. [Stan doesn't smile] There it is. [FLASH!] Okay great, next.
STAN
[reaches for his hat and puts it on] I didn't smile. [hops off the stool and walks away. A wider view shows Ms. Choksondik's class in line off to the right. The kids move forward. Butters heads for the stool]
KYLE
I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England!
BUTTERS
[in dress shirt and tie, holds out his palms] Ah, hang on a second. My mom said to make sure I look good this time in... the school pictures. [pulls out a comb and some gel, dabs the gel on the comb, and combs his hair back. Four strokes, and he's done]
PHOTOGRAPHER
Okay, smile [Butters smiles, a lock of his hair goes up, and he blinks. Then the picture is taken, and Butters opens his eyes] Okay, next? [Butters hops off; Bebe, wearing heavy makeup, approaches and hops onto the stool]
STAN
[joins Kyle at the end of the line] Did you go yet?
KYLE
No. This is taking forever.
CARTMAN
[rushes up, giddily breathless] You guys! You guys! This is sooo funny!
KYLE
What, Cartman?
CARTMAN
Dude, check it out: for picture day, Kenny got into his parka backwards, so that his ass shows through his hood. Look! [points]. Kenny, Kenny, over here! [Kenny comes in looking as Cartman described, with his hands on the floor and his feet in the air, laughing uncontrollably. After Kenny stands still, Cartman roars with laughter]
KYLE
It isn't that funny, Cartman.
CARTMAN
Yes it is! [while this is going on, the other kids get their pictures taken, Tolkien being the last one. He hops off the stool and walks away.]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Next in line! Come on, let's keep it moving, kids! [Kyle walks up to the stool]
CARTMAN
...Don't listen to that Jew, Kenny, it's totally funny.
PHOTOGRAPHER
[Kyle sits for the camera] Take off your hat, please.
KYLE
But I never take off my hat.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Come on now, I bet your parents want a picture of YOU lookin' natural.
KYLE
This is how I look natural.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Kyle, we're taking pictures without hats today!
KYLE
[angrily] Crap. [takes off his hat to reveal big red bushy hair]
PHOTOGRAPHER
Smile! Come on, where's that smile? Is it gonna kill you to smile? I see a smile. [Kyle gives a small grin, and the picture is taken. He goes back to being angry, re-dons his hat and hops off the stool] Next!
KYLE
Gay-ass. [Cartman hops on, takes off his hat and quickly strikes a pose]
PHOTOGRAPHER
[takes the picture] Very nice. Okay, last one? [hops off laughing as Kenny approaches]
CARTMAN
Uh oh. [laughs]
PHOTOGRAPHER
Okay, have a seat, young man. [both Cartman and Kenny chuckle as Kenny sets himself down] Well, okay, lookin' great. Now where's that smile? Come on, give me a nice, wide smile. Wider. Perfect! [FLASH!]
CARTMAN
Huh, how long 'til we get the pictures back?
PHOTOGRAPHER
Should be about four days.
CARTMAN
Four days?? Oh man, I can't wait that long!
[South Park Elementary, four days later, day. Inside, in Ms. Choksondik's class, Cartman is fidgeting rather loudly in his desk]
CARTMAN
Heh, c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright, class, I have your school photos to hand out-
CARTMAN
[bouncing in his seat] YES! YES!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Most of them are very nice. But, apparently, one of you thinks it's fun to spoil their school pictures [Kenny looks around], and thinks he's a comedian. That person will be spending the afternoon in the principal's office!
KENNY
(Aww, that's bullshit!)
MS. CHOKSONDIK
School photos aren't for joking around, so you aren't getting your photo back, Butters! [thrusts the photo out for a close-up]
BUTTERS
Um-me?? Huh but I didn't do nothin'.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
For the rest of you, I think your pictures turned out very nicely.
BUTTERS
But, buut, but but what hey! Wait a minute! [the others get their photos and review them]
CARTMAN
[rushes up and takes Kenny's photos] Let me see! [returns to his seat. Stan and Kyle look at Cartman curiously while Kenny looks on angrily]
BUTTERS
[catches up to Ms. Choksondik as she sits at her chair] Bu-but Teacher, I didn't mean to look stupid in my picture. Honest!
CARTMAN
[opens Kenny's envelope and looks at the photo, then roars with laughter] Dude, dude! Check it out! This is the sweetest thing I've ever done!
KENNY
(You've ever done?!)
CARTMAN
[Laughs] Look at how the crap ...is sittin' right in the middle! [laughs some more]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Eric, calm down. I'm trying to yell at Butters!
CARTMAN
Okay, hokay, I'm sorry Ms. Chokesonrocks!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
You know very well my name isn't Chokesonrocks, it's Choksondik! Say it right or you can go to the principal's with Butters!
CARTMAN
I'm sorry Ms. Choksondik.
BUTTERS
I tried to make a good picture. Honest.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Your mother is waiting for you in the principal's office. [points towards the door]
BUTTERS
My mom? [turns around and walks out] Oh, sweet Jesus!
CARTMAN
Hoh, Oh my God! More people have to see this picture, you guys. I'm gonna put it on the Internet or... No, wait! Kenny. [Kenny looks over] I just had the greatest idea... ever!
[Dairy Gold Milk Company, day. A receptionist in blue suit sits at her desk. The doors open and Cartman enters]
RECEPTIONIST
Welcome to South Park Milk Company. Can I help you?
CARTMAN
Oh, yes, hello. I am helping out a family who has a missing child, and I was wondering if you could print his photo on your milk carton? [stifles a laugh]
RECEPTIONIST
Oh, of course. Printing those photos on our milk really does help. Do you have the photo with you?
CARTMAN
Yes, I have it right hmya. [shows her Kenny's school photo]
RECEPTIONIST
[takes the photo] O-okay, great. We'll print it immediately.
CARTMAN
You will? [tries not to laugh, but some escapes] Ah. [stifles another laugh] Oh, ah, thank you for your help.
RECEPTIONIST
Sure. If I could get a description of the child to print underneath the photo? [Cartman stops in his tracks and turns around]
CARTMAN
Oh, yehes. Uh-heh. He has ah, blond hair, aha-and, ah, and a brown eye. [sniggers, then laughs] Brown eye! [laughs some more under his breath]
RECEPTIONIST
Okay, brown eye...
CARTMAN
And, and big rosy cheeks! [laughs some more]
RECEPTIONIST
...Full cheeks...
CARTMAN
[cracks up] Full cheeks! [laughs] Winking brown eye, brown eye winking! [cracks up]
[Stan's house, day. A TV is heard.]
REPORTER
Ms. Hamilton was the fourth person to be run over by a motorcycle this week, leaving a city to ponder, who will be next? [Stan and Kyle are on the sofa eating popcorn. The phone rings, and Kyle answers it]
KYLE
Hello?
CARTMAN
[between the laughter] You guys! You guys! You guys! [laughs uncontrollably]
KYLE
Hello?
CARTMAN
[more laughter] ...You guys!... [more laughter]
KYLE
[getting annoyed] Cartman?
CARTMAN
[more laughter] You guys! You guys! You guys! Hurry. [hangs up]
STAN
What's he want?
KYLE
[pissed off] I don't know. Let's go see. [they walk off]
[Cartman's house, minutes later. Cartman can be heard laughing inside as Stan and Kyle approach his door. Kyle rings the doorbell and Cartman answers, still laughing.]
KYLE
Why'd you call us?
CARTMAN
Come on. Come on. [whispers] Come on.[leads the way] Oho, this is so sweet! [still laughing as he walks to the sofa and picks up a milk carton] You guys, seriously, this is sooo sweet!
STAN
Goddamnit Cartman, what?! [Cartman hands him the carton and erupts in laughter as Stan and Kyle look it over]
KYLE
...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??
CARTMAN
Look at, look at the description. Brown eye! [falls to the floor, pounding the carpet with his fists in hysterics]
STAN
That isn't funny, Cartman.
CARTMAN
Oh, it's soo completely funny!! Ahaha this is certainly funny!!
KYLE
No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children.
CARTMAN
No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you guys.
[A house in Wisconsin. A woman enters her kitchen with some groceries and sets them on the kitchen counter next to the sink. She pulls them out one by one, but stops when she pulls out the milk carton]
MARTHA
[gasps] Oh my God. Oh my God! [holds the carton close. Her face looks like a derriere] Steven! Steven, come quick!
STEVEN
[rushes in. His face does also.] What is it, Martha?
MARTHA
Look. It's him! It's... our son.
STEVEN
Our ssson!
[Dairy Gold Milk Company, day, a few days later. The Wisconsin couple are at the Dairy Gold Milk Company, talking to the receptionist. Their "s" and sometimes "th" comes out sounding like a raspberry]
MARTHA
...and so that's when I called out to my husband. I just knew the boy picture on your milk carton was our little Tommy.
RECEPTIONIST
[stunned] ... yes, I see. [pics up a milk carton carton] Uh, but the child on the milk carton was reported missing, not found.
STEVEN
We realize that. But we just thought that maybe someone else had found Tommy, and then lost him again. We're pretty certain that it's our boy, considering his physical appearance. Martha and I have the... same condition.
RECEPTIONIST
...Riiight.
STEVEN
You may not have realized this, but we actually have buttocks where our heads should be.
RECEPTIONIST
[flatly] ...Really?
STEVEN
Yes.
MARTHA
Steven and I have a condition called "torsonic polarity syndrome." It's a birth defect that's passed on genetically.
STEVEN
Over eleven people worldwide suffer from TPS.
RECEPTIONIST
[flatly] Hmm, hmm, that's am-, that's amazing.
STEVEN
Martha and I were lucky enough to meet each other at a TPS convention in France.
RECEPTIONIST
So... do you have heads down where your rear ends should be?
STEVEN
No no, don't be silly. You see, with TPS, the birth defect is on the exterior only. Behind this we still have all our vital head organs - tongue, eyes, nasal passages...
RECEPTIONIST
Well, Mr. and Mrs...
STEVEN
Uh, Thompssson.
RECEPTIONIST
...Thompson. Uh, I'll contact the young boy who gave me the photo, and perhaps we can all visit him together.
MARTHA
Oh, wonderful! Steven, we're goin' to see Tommy again!
STEVEN
Now, Martha, what did I say about getting our hopesss up?
MARTHA
You're right. You're right.
[Cartman's house, moments later. Cartman is laughing his ass off on the sofa when Stan and Kyle return to see him.]
KYLE
...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?
CARTMAN
[gets up and hops off the sofa] Oho, you guys, you guys! Oh my God. [tries to compose himself] Okay, okay, so get this, get this: The milk company calls me, right? [wipes some moisture from his face] And they call me and say that two people from Wisconsin... saw the picture of Kenny on the milk carton, and they think it's their kid. [cracks up again]
STAN
...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son.
CARTMAN
No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be! [waits a second, then roars with laughter again]
KYLE
...Nuh uh.
CARTMAN
Oh yes! And the best part is... they're coming here, to my house. And it's gonna be sooo funny!! [roars with laughter again. The doorbell rings and all three look at the door] Oh Jesus, that's probably them now! Okay, you guys, just play it cool, just play it-, just-sshh. No, sshh, you guys, sshh. [walks over to answer the door. He stops and stifle a laugh] Just- okay [chuckles] No. [takes a few steps] Okay, okay, no, you guys, sh, sh. [steps to the door, takes a deep breath, and opens it, grinning]
MARTHA
[greeting] Hello, we're Mr. and Mrs. Thompson. [Cartman stands there grinning, then it disappears into a frown. A few moments later he turns around dejected.]
CARTMAN
Oh God.
KYLE
[starts laughing, but stifles it with his hands over his mouth] Hohly crahap, duhude, heh!
STAN
No way! [Cartman turns around and looks again, frowning]
STEVEN
We understand you've seen our son. [Cartman looks speechless, then turns around looking lost]
CARTMAN
[very softly] Oh my... God. [walks away from the door quite afraid, then begins to ascend the stairs stammering nonsense]
STAN
Cartman, where are you going?? [Cartman keeps walking. The Thompsons simply shrug their shoulders, looking at each other]
MARTHA
[holds up the milk carton] Uh, excuse me, boys, do you know anything about this?
KYLE
[giggles a bit] Uh
STAN
Oh boy.
KYLE
Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house.
STAN
Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town.
MARTHA
[Steven puts his arm around her shoulder] Oh thank you. Thank you! [they turn and walk away. The receptionist waits for them on the walkway]
RECEPTIONIST
Well?
STEVEN
They said to inquire four houses down.
MARTHA
Let's hurry! [leads the way down the street. Steven and the receptionist follow]
[Cartman's room, moments later. Cartman is at a loss for words and looks scared. The door opens and Kyle and Stan walk in.]
KYLE
Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
STAN
Yeah, you missed them turning around.
CARTMAN
You guys, something's wrong.
STAN
What?
CARTMAN
I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.
KYLE
[quizzically] Blew a funny fuse?
CARTMAN
[turns to face them] It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded. [turns away] I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got?
[Outside, on the sidewalk. Six kids are walking along: Kyle, Stan, Tolkien, Clyde, Craig, and Tweek]
CLYDE
You mean they both have butts instead of heads?
STAN
Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's.
TOLKIEN
How do they eat?
STAN
How the hell should we know? [the kids stop before a house]
KYLE
Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!
BUTTERS
[opens his bedroom window and looks down] W-what?
KYLE
You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.
STAN
There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.
BUTTERS
Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture.
STAN
But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical!
LINDA
Butters can't come out and play, boys. He thinks it's funny to look like a jackass in his school pictures that I have to pay for!
BUTTERS
Huh, but I told you mom: ah-I didn't mean to look... like a jackass, eh. It just happened.
LINDA
You made a goofy face!
BUTTERS
No! That's just what I look like. See?
LINDA
[turns around and looks up] ...Don't you make that face at me, young man!
BUTTERS
I'm not makin' a face, mom!
LINDA
Stop it!
CRAIG
...Come on, we wanna see the ass people.
KYLE
Alright. [the kids turn left and walk away]
LINDA
Fine Butters! If you don't wanna stop making that stupid face at me, you can just stay in your room for another week! [goes inside and shuts the door.]
BUTTERS
Another week? [turns around and drops down] I hate my stupid face.
[Mr. Mackey's office, day. Cartman is on the couch laying on his back...]
MR. MACKEY
Okay Eric, as your counselor, uh I want you to feel comfortable talking about anything, m'kay?
CARTMAN
Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever?
MR. MACKEY
Well, I can't think of anything that would be THAT funny.
CARTMAN
Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.
MR. MACKEY
Oh, I see, well... Well, what did you used to think was funny?
CARTMAN
You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die... [Mr. Mackey is shocked by the last one] This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.
MR. MACKEY
Well Eric, I suppose that, just like everything else, laughter can be relative - in, in other words, sometimes people see somethin' so scary that nothin' else scares them, so, the same could be true for funny things.
CARTMAN
[turns over to look at Mr. Mackey] So does that mean I'll never laugh again?
MR. MACKEY
It's possible, hm'kay? [Cartman turns over and lays on his back again] But you know, if you have completely lost your sense of humor, you can always become a writer for the show, "Friends" [laughs at the unexpected humor in his own statement]. Ohokahay, huhuh.
CARTMAN
Ugh.
[The McCormick house, later. The Thompsons' car is parked outside, on the street. Inside, the McCormicks, the Thompsons and the receptionist are seated around the coffee table. A brick has replaced two of its legs. Kenny stands beside his mother.]
CAROL
...and so you see, our son was just playing a joke and the little fat kid put it on the carton.
MARTHA
Yes. Yes, I see.
CAROL
Kenny, don't you think you owe the Thompsons an apology? [Kenny just stares at them]
MARTHA
...No, it was foolish for us to get our hopes up.
STEVEN
It was just such a coincidence, considering the photo. You may not have realized this, but Martha and I have buttocks where our heads should be.
STUART AND CAROL
Really?
RECEPTIONIST
Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, how long has it been since you've seen your son?
STEVEN
Tommy disappeared when he was only seven.
MARTHA
[leans into Steven's right shoulder, sobbing, and he comforts her] Oh, Steven, it's like it's all happening all over again. [sobs uncontrollably]
CAROL
[rises to soother her also] There there now. [looks around, then walks off]
RECEPTIONIST
Please, Mrs. Thompson, it'll be alright. [Martha continues sobbing] Listen, the South Park Dairy Company is the country's largest. We find lost children all the time. [Carol returns with a box of tissues. Martha takes one and blows her "nose" with it. Stuart walks off again, and Martha resumes sobbing and blowing her nose] We can help you find Tommy with the company's database![Martha blows her "nose" even harder and louder.]
CAROL
[holds her arms out as if to keep Martha away] Yes, well, aaah-I'll help you find your son. Just stop cryin', Please, for the love of God, stop cryin'!
MARTHA
[blows her nose again and sobs some more, then tries to compose herself] Ah, agh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [blows her nose]
RECEPTIONIST
Mr. Thompson, how did your son become missing? Was he abducted?
STEVEN
Yes. He was in the care of our nanny at the time.
MARTHA
The nanny that we trusted so much took off with him and we still don't know why. [Stan and Tolkien are now looking in through the window. Kyle joins them. Martha sneezes] We think perhaps she wanted a child of her own. [a couple of hands try to get a grip on the window sill]
RECEPTIONIST
And this was back in Wisconsin? [Craig soon rises into view outside]
STEVEN
Yes, but we last heard the nanny was heading west. [Tolkien, Craig, and Kyle start laughing. Tweek pops up and pushes Craig out of the way to have a good look. Stan laughs, and Craig climbs up on Tweek.] That's why we thought Colorado made sssssense.
MARTHA
We've tried every avenue to find him, [Officer Barbrady happens by and says something. The kids jump] but, we've never tried the milk company. [Stan seems to tell Barbrady to come over and look at the ass people.]
RECEPTIONIST
Well you just give us a try. I think you'll find that South Park Milk [Barbrady approaches] is not only the best resource for finding kids, [Barbrady's eyes widen] but also the best producer of the freshest 2% lowfat milk the world can offer. [Barbrady walks away and calls out to some people, then returns to the window]
MARTHA
Thank you. Thank you so much for helping us. [Mr. Garrison walks by and looks in, then seems to say "Holy crap!"]
STEVEN
This certainly is a friendly town. [Sheila shows up behind Kyle] You've all been sssssso wonderful. [Chef shows up behind Mr. Garrison]
MARTHA
Yes, I'm so grateful I just wanna cry again.
STUART AND WIFE, AND RECEPTIONIST
[they hold their palms out] NO!
[The Bijou Theater, day. "Grossout Comedy 8" is playing there. Inside, Cartman sits amid a bunch of older folk]
MALE 1
Dude, why are you wearing Shalayna's panties? [the audience laughs; Cartman sits there, glum, his head resting on his left hand.]
MALE 2
I have to wear Shalayna's panties. Lisa's were in the wash. [the audience laughs; Cartman just blinks.] Look, can we just get this over with?
MALE 1
But dude, I can't French-kiss him. He's my grandpa! [the audience laughs]
MALE 2
Come on, dude.
MALE 1
Oh, alright Here it goes. Come'ere, Grandpa.
AUDIENCE
Aww
CARTMAN
[out of sorts] Oh, dude, oh.
JONESY
[noticing] Dude, what's wrong with you?
CARTMAN
Nothing's wrong with me. Uh-
MALE 1
Well, I'm glad that's over with. We'd better go back to the house now to see how Chris is doing. [Cartman fakes a laugh and the audience turns to look at him. Cartman manages a few weak laughs, then sinks in his seat]
[Dairy Gold Milk Company, day. An official leads the Thompsons through the factory. Cows are lined up in their stalls eating from personal troughs.]
PRESIDENT
Uh Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, as President of the South Park Milk Company, I want to apologize personally for printing that falsified picture on our milk cartons.
STEVEN
Please, please. It's not your fault.
PRESIDENT
Ye-yes, but here at South Park Milk we strive for excellence. For instance, we are now entering the extraction room. [stops] As you can see, we keep it close to the refrigeration room. That way we can get the milk to the container as fast as possible. [commercial music comes up] That's why some say South Park milk tastes like you're suckin' it right from the cow's tits yourself.
MARTHA
Amazing.
PRESIDENT
[a worker comes by with some food] Here, try a glass of our cold Vitamin D. And our fresh scones. [the Thompsons take some milk and scones and start eating]
STEVEN
Delicious.
MARTHA
Oh, excuse me. A little... difficult to drink with our condition. [the couple set their milks back on the tray and the worker walks out.]
STEVEN
Martha and I actually have buttocks where our heads should be.
PRESIDENT
Really? Well. And in here we have our Missing Child Resource Center. [leads them into a large darkened room]
MARTHA
Oh my, isn't this impressive?
PRESIDENT
Yes. With the Kelrom 4000, Mrs. Garthunk can search a database of over 30 million missing child cases.
MRS. GARTHUNK
[the receptionist] We'll start the computer on a data search. Now, when did your son turn up missing?
STEVEN
Well, it was 1982. Tommy was only six at the time.
MRS. GARTHUNK
Alright then. Computer...
COMPUTER
Workiiing.
MRS. GARTHUNK
Run a scan of missing children since 1982. Check for physical birth defects called TPS.
COMPUTER
TPS. Torsonic Polarity Syndrome. Child missing since 1982. Workiiing.
PRESIDENT
So you actually haven't seen your son in over 20 years?
MARTHA
That's right.
MRS. GARTHUNK
But then, why did you think the picture of Kenny was him. Wouldn't your son be much older now?
STEVEN
Yes, but since he appeared to be at least eight in the photo, [takes a bite out of the scone and chews it] we assumed someone had seen him since we did.
MARTHA
[pulls out a baby picture] This is the only photo we have of our little Tommy. [in diapers in a crib, looking like he's just finished eating]
MRS. GARTHUNK
It's gonna take quite a while for the computer to do a scan of all missing kids.
PRESIDENT
Well, why don't we let Mrs. Garthunk do her work, and I'll take you two out for some good old Colorado chili. [walks out. The Thompsons follow him]
STEVEN
We don't really like chili; it makes us throw up.
[Cartman's house, living room, day. The door bell rings and Eric answers it. Jimmy stands at the entrance]
JIMMY
Well, hello, Eric. I was really glad you called me, very much.
CARTMAN
Jimmy! Thank God! Get in here! [goes inside, and Jimmy follows, closing the door]
JIMMY
What's this all about?
CARTMAN
Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor.
JIMMY
Gee, that's a terrible thing, Eric. Um comedy can be the best therapy, very much.
CARTMAN
I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.
JIMMY
Oh, I don't think that'll be hard. I've been working on my rr... routine.
CARTMAN
Okay, let me have it.
JIMMY
Okay. Try this one on for size: Why did the... pigeon cross the road?
CARTMAN
Okay, why?
JIMMY
Because it was having sex with the chihi... Because it was having sex with the ch-hi-hi... Because it was having sex with the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch... eh, it was having sex with the ch-ch-hiicken. [Cartman doesn't respond]
CARTMAN
...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing.
JIMMY
Wow, what a great audience... How about this classic? Knock-knock.
CARTMAN
Who's there?
JIMMY
Orange.
CARTMAN
Orange who?
JIMMY
Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say bbb? Orange you glad I didn't say beh buhuhnnnaana?
CARTMAN
[stares back] ...naw, that didn't work either.
JIMMY
Wow, w-what a great audience... Knock-knock.
CARTMAN
Who's there?
JIMMY
An interrupting ca'ow.
CARTMAN
An interrupting cow who
JIMMY
[interrupting] Moooooo! [...no response.] ...What a terrific audience. [the two of them stand in the middle of the living room looking at each other]
[Dairy Gold Milk Company, day. Mrs. Garthunk is still at the computer doing her search]
MRS. GARTHUNK
Hah, let's see. The Dallas-Ft. Wroth area. I haven't tried there yet. Computer?
COMPUTER
Workiiing.
MRS. GARTHUNK
Scan for any children reported found in the Dallas-Ft. Wroth area, with a facial deformity.
COMPUTER
Workiiing. [some computer noises] Negative.
MRS. GARTHUNK
Ugh. This is hopeless! ...Wait a minute, let's try it this way: Computer?
COMPUTER
Workiiing.
MRS. GARTHUNK
Scan databanks for children who reported their parents missing.
COMPUTER
Workiiing. [some computer noises] One million six thousand hits.
MRS. GARTHUNK
Alright, then break it down to claims in the past twenty years.
COMPUTER
Workiiing. [some computer noises] Three hundred twenty-one thousand hits.
MRS. GARTHUNK
Alright, now run a scan on homogenized versus pasteurized skim milk.
COMPUTER
In skim form, homogenized has longer shelf life by 2.3 weeks.
MRS. GARTHUNK
Okaaay, okay, now give me a breakdown of people who are seeking their parents who also suffer from a disease called T P S.
COMPUTER
Torsonic Polarity Syndrome, plus, a claim to not know parents: one match
MRS. GARTHUNK
Bingo. Do you have a photo
COMPUTER
Printiiing. [the screen reads "Processing". A picture starts appearing on screen]
MRS. GARTHUNK
My God. Oh my God!
[Sidewalk, day. Six boys walk down the street again, only Kenny has replaced Tweek among the boys. They stop at Butters' house again,and again, Kyle calls out.]
KYLE
Butters! Hey Butters!
BUTTERS
[opens his windows; has a paper bag over his head] Hehyeah?
KYLE
They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!
BUTTERS
Aw gee, thah-at sounds swell, fellas, but I can't go 'cause I'm still havin' behavioral problems.
STAN
Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?
BUTTERS
Uh, my parents are makin' me wear this paper bag until I learn... to stop makin' silly faces all the time. They've really had it up to [raises his hand high] here with me.
STEPHEN
Butters? Are you ready to stop with the stupid faces?
BUTTERS
[hops down to the floor] I sure am, Dad!
STEPHEN
Alright, you can take the paper bag off.
BUTTERS
[removes the bag] Thanks, Dad! Ah I'm sorry I was bad-
STEPHEN
Oh, very funny, young man! You think it's clever to make yourself up like a girl?!
BUTTERS
Hububut Dad, ah I didn't lick a-
STEPHEN
Did you use your mother's makeup?! She's gonna be furious!
BUTTERS
I'm not wearin' makeup Dad! I uh-
STEPHEN
Put that bag back on!
BUTTERS
[subdued] Yes, sir. [slips the bag over his head again]
KYLE
Dude, that poor kid. [walks off]
CLYDE
Yeah, we gotta remember to kick his ass tomorrow. [turns with the other boys and follows Kyle off. Butters slams his windows shut]
[Cartman's room, day. Cartman sits on his bed dejected. He's unwrapped a box and a gun sits on his bed to his left, a notepad and pencil to his right. He picks up the pad and pencil and writes...]
CARTMAN
Dear Mom: I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can't go out to face it anymore. Please tell everyone why I won't be at school.
[He sets the notepad down and looks at it for a moment, then he reaches over for the gun. He opens his mouth and puts the barrel of the gun in... and bites it off. It's a chocolate gun, and he sets the remainder down on the bed again]
CARTMAN
And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.
[He picks up the chocolate again and takes another bite. Then he looks at the box the gun came in]
CARTMAN
Please get the kind with marshmallow inside. I don't like the peanut-butter filled one.
Eric.
[Dairy Gold Milk Company, day. A TV 4 news van and crew are present. Some of the factory workers are present in the background as the president of the company stands behind some microphones. The Thompsons stand next to the president. A sign behind them asks, "Got Missing Kids?"]
PRESIDENT
And so it is with great pride that we have flown little Billy Thompson out here, to be reunited with his parents for the first time in twenty years. [Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Craig, Tolkien, and Clyde show up and watch.] Mrs. Garthunk? [moves aside as she steps up]
MRS. GARTHUNK
Thank you, Mr. President. I'm proud to be an employee of South Park Milk, [music plays] which to date has found over a hundred thousand missing kids, and, led the way in the fight against curdling. Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, your son grew up not knowing who his parents were. [a shot of the Thompson couple] But he was strong and resilient, [a shot of the crowd] and ended up becoming very successful. I think it will amaze you as it will all of us to learn that your son... is Ben Affleck! [a picture is taken. The people in the crowd look puzzled]
PRESIDENT
Come around here, Ben! [a man makes his way through the crowd as the people clap and cheer. It's Ben Affleck]
BEN AFFLECK
Mom! Dad!
STEVEN
[opens his arms] Son!
MARTHA
[opens her arms] Oh, son! [Ben walks into their embrace as more pictures are taken]
CARTMAN
[walking up to the other boys] What's goin' on?
STAN
Dude, the ass-faces' son is Ben Affleck!
STEVEN
Oh, our same ol' Ben!
MARTHA
Oh, I'm so happy! [starts kissing him with her ass-face cheeks. Ben grimaces]
MR. GARRISON
Wow, I never realized Ben had TPS, but I definitely see the resemblance now. [Mrs. Thompson is still crying and kissing Ben.]
STEVEN
Aw, son. [begins kissing him, and Ben grimaces again]
PRESIDENT
Isn't this wonderful?
PHOTOGRAPHER
[gets into position] Okay gang, give me a big smile. [the Thompsons face the camera with Ben and the picture is taken. The crowd then disperses, and a man behind the boys is writing something on a note pad. He walks away as well.]
KYLE
Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.
CARTMAN
Yeah, I guess now we'll have to call him Ben Assfleck. [breaks into a grin and starts laughing] Ben Assfleck, say that's funny.
STAN
[noticing] Hey, you're laughing, Cartman.
CARTMAN
Hehey, you're right! Oho, this is great! Ben Assfleck! [laughs some more.]
KYLE
Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened?
CARTMAN
A-heh, what?
KYLE
Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh.
STAN
Huh?
KYLE
When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh.
STAN
Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse.
CARTMAN
E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.
KYLE
There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad.
CARTMAN
[silent sigh] Whatever. All I know is that I can laugh again. I'm gonna go home and eat another chocolate gun. Come on, Kenny! [Kenny follows Cartman, and they begin to cross the road. Kenny remains behind Cartman, and the sound of a motorcycle draws close]
MOTORCYCLE DRIVER
[running over Kenny] Dangit! [Cartman spins to see Kenny's bloody body on the road... and roars with laughter]
[Stan and Kyle face Cartman. Behind them the crowd consists of only the camera crew, Mrs. Garthunk, Ben Affleck and the Thompsons, and the workers]
STAN
Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them.
KYLE
Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up.
STAN
Yeah, I guess we all are. Maybe things are finally gonna start getting a more sophisticated around here.
[Close-up of the Thompsons taking turns kissing Ben Affleck. Mrs. Thompson sobs and blows her nose]
STEVEN
Aw son! [kisses him]
End of How to Eat with Your Butt


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Mr. Garrison gets fed up with long lines, delayed flights and the airline industry in general and invents his own transportation device.

script:The Entity

[Denver International Airport, day. Inside the terminal people are in long lines waiting to get their tickets or get on a plane. Mr. Garrison waits in line to have his bags scanned]
MR. GARRISON
Jesus Christ, these lines are ridiculous! I'm gonna miss my flight! [sees a guard] E- Excuse me, there are two other security checkpoints. Why can't you open those, too?
SECURITY GUARD
Uh I don't know nothin'.
MR. GARRISON
But you work for the- [the guard turns around and walks way] uh, God-damnit!!
VOICE
[over the PA system] Snooty Airlines announces the arrival of flight 239 from Connecticut.
[The Broflovskis stand in front of a perfume shop]
SHEILA
That's your cousin's flight, Kyle. Hold the sign up nice and high so he can find us.
KYLE
What's he look like?
SHEILA
He's your age and about your height.
KYLE
I'm stoked my cousin is comin' to live with us. It'll be just like having a brother. [Ike flashes an angry look]
IKE
I todd a nurra.
SHEILA
Oh, there he is. [waving] Over here, Kyle! [a boy wearing a NY cap and a #34 shirt appears. Kyle grins and holds up the sign. The boy looks to his right and walks off. Another boy appears, with bushy hair and a part down the middle and thick glasses]
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Hello, Aunt Sheila.
SHEILA
How was your flight? [Kyle lowers the sign and looks stunned]
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Oh, it was terrible. They recycled the air on board and it really did a number on my asthma. I-I-e-I asked them to turn up the oxygen and they wouldn't. [walks up and joins the family]
SHEILA
You remember Uncle Gerry.
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Hi, Uncle Gerry.
SHEILA
[kneels on one knee] And these are your cousins, Ike and Kyle.
KYLE
Hey dude.
KYLE SCHWARTZ
It's nice to meet you.
SHEILA
Let's get down to the baggage claim, Kyle. [rises and moves]
BOTH KYLES
Okay:
SHEILA
[returns and genuflects again] Oooh, that's right! We've got two Kyles now. We'll just call you [to the nephew] Kyle, and you can be Kyle... [to the son] Two! [holds up two fingers and walks off. Kyle Schwartz (Kyle) follows her while Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two) sorts this out]
KYLE TWO
Cool. [follows the others out]
[Ticket counter. Mr. Garrison's turn has come up and he approaches the counter]
CLERK
[female] Next?
MR. GARRISON
Oh, I feel like I've run a marathon. [hands her his ticket]
CLERK
[starts typing away] Mmmokay, the 2:30 flight to Cheyenne has boarded. Looks like you didn't make it.
MR. GARRISON
What? Well of course I didn't make it. The line to check in was two hours long, and the security line was two hours more!
CLERK
Nnnyeah, no problem, though. We'll get you on the 7 a.m. flight tomorrow morning.
MR. GARRISON
I can't go tomorrow, the Jizzfest is tonight!
CLERK
[ignoring comments] Would you like a window or an aisle seat?
MR. GARRISON
This is unbelievable! You know, I seem to remember when the airlines said, "We need a 15 billion dollar bailout from the taxpayers-"!
CLERK
Mmokay, and have any of your personal items been out of your possession since you left?
MR. GARRISON
[people in the lines hear him and turn to look] Well we gave them the 15 billion dollar bailout and they fired their employees anyway! So now we have three people to clear 400 passengers!
MAN
Hey, he's right!
PEOPLE
YEAH!
CLERK
Okay, and bags have been with you at all times?
MR. GARRISON
So where did that money go? I'll tell you where it went: it went into the pockets of the presidents and CEOs of the airlines, so they can keep their multimillion-dollar salaries!
PEOPLE
YEAH!
CLERK
[prints out a pass and hands it out for Garrison to get] And here's your boarding pass for tomorrow morning.
MR. GARRISON
You think you can treat us however you want because we HAVE to fly! Well I'll tell you what, Sally Sassalot, I'm gonna come up with a NEW mode of transportation! A ahah brand new vehicle that'll put all you bastards out of business!
PEOPLE
YEAH! ALRIGHT! GO!
MR. GARRISON
You think I can't do it?! I got a master's degree in mechanical engineering at Denver Community College! You watch me!! [turns and stretches his arms over the crowd] Come on, everybody!
PEOPLE
YEAH!
MAN
[next in line, approaches the clerk] Can I get on that 7:30 a.m. flight?
[The Broflovski house, night. The family is seated around the dining room table as Sheila enters with soup in hand]
SHEILA
Here we go, Kyle Two. [Kyle Two smiles at the soup he's gotten] And here's yours, Kyle. [Kyle inspects it]
KYLE
[sniffs] Oh, uh, wawawhat is this?
KYLE TWO
Mom's special stew. She makes it every Monday and I love it.
KYLE
Oh is, is this beef?
KYLE TWO
Yeah, dude, it's great! [eats the soup with gusto]
KYLE
Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass.
SHEILA
Oh, I'm so sorry, Kyle. What else can I fix you?
KYLE
Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh-
SHEILA
Nonsense. Can't I make you some nice pasta? Or a frozen fish fillet?
KYLE
We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble.
SHEILA
[rises and heads for the kitchen] I'll put it in the microwave right away. [heavy breathing is heard. Kyle Two looks at his cousin]
[Kitchen, moments later. Sheila has gotten the fish and breaks it apart on the kitchen counter. Kyle Two appears at the doorway]
KYLE TWO
Mom?
SHEILA
Yes, Kyle Two?
KYLE TWO
How am I related to him again?
SHEILA
He's your cousin, Kyle Two. I told you already.
KYLE TWO
Yeah, but like... first cousin or distant cousin?
SHEILA
He's my sister's son. That makes him your first cousin.
KYLE TWO
So we have the same blood?
SHEILA
Now Kyle Two, listen to me. Kyle is going through a very tough time in his life. His mother is very sick and he's in a whole new place. He's going to rely on you to make sure he fits in at your school.
KYLE TWO
What? How the hell am I supposed to do that?
SHEILA
I'm sure your friends will love him.
KYLE TWO
What about Cartman, huh? He rips on me for being Jewish! He's gonna tear this kid apart!
SHEILA
Kyle Two, he's your responsibility.
KYLE TWO
Oh my God.
SHEILA
I'm sure you two will become great friends with lots of late night pillow talk.
KYLE TWO
Well what do you mean? [she catches her breath] What room is he sleeping in?
[Kyle's room, past bed time. Both Kyles are in bed, the cousin getting used to the bed.]
KYLE
What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it?
KYLE TWO
I don't know, dude.
KYLE
Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?
KYLE TWO
I don't think so.
KYLE
Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on.
KYLE TWO
Okay. [reaches for the light and turns it off, then tries to sleep. That distinctive breathing returns as Kyle slowly goes to sleep, and Kyle Two takes a peek. Kyle swallows and turns his head to the left. Kyle Two looks at him, annoyed, then turns his back on Kyle and tries to sleep again]
[Mr. Garrison's house, night. He's working at an artist's desk in his bedroom. On the wall are drawings of various types of aircraft, and on the floor around him are bits and pieces of all kinds of vehicles, including bicycle gears, airplane propellers, car motors, a muffler. To his right is a dresser with a small color TV on top. Mr. Hat is present on his right hand, as always]
MR. GARRISON
Now it's got to be simple. Like a moped, but with the ability to travel at much faster speeds. The designs of our electrical moped were altered with a- no, nonono this won't work either!
MR. HAT
What was wrong with that plan?
MR. GARRISON
It has to be more stable, Mr. Hat! A moped would be too dangerous at those speeds. Damnit! [tries something new] Now, what if the jet power of an aircraft could be scaled down into a personal vehicle?
MR. HAT
Boy, that Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass around.
ENRIQUE IGLESIAS
[on TV, gyrating his hips around, holding his crotch in his left hand, the back of his head with the right one] ...I think about you day and night. I think about you...
MR. GARRISON
Oh, Mr. Hat! Would you stop drooling over Enrique Iglesias and... wait a minute. What did you say?
MR. HAT
I said Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass!
MR. GARRISON
That's it. Gyration. [pulls something onto his desk] A gyroscope. [sets it in motion] It would allow for maximum balance and yet... Mr. Hat! You're a genius! [starts writing again] It's so simple and yet genius!
MR. HAT
Check out his hot bulge, too.
[Bus stop, next day. Kenny, Stan and Cartman wait at the stop. The two Kyles walk up to them]
STAN
Hey dude.
CARTMAN
What's that thing?
KYLE TWO
Cartman, I need to talk to you. [takes him off to one side]
KYLE
[to Stan] Hello, I'm Kyle's cousin Kyle.
KYLE TWO
Cartman, I'm gonna make you a deal.
CARTMAN
What?
KYLE TWO
That kid over there is my cousin from the East Coast. He's having a really hard time right now, so I'm going to offer you forty dollars to not rip on him.
CARTMAN
Forty bucks?
KYLE TWO
But you can't make fun of him AT ALL. No smartass comments, nothin'.
CARTMAN
Alright, alright.
KYLE TWO
And you especially can't say anything about Jews!
CARTMAN
Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls?
KYLE TWO
Cartman, no Jew jokes! All you have to do is keep your mouth shut, and you've got forty bucks! Can you do it? [Cartman looks past Kyle Two and sees Kyle talking away at the bus stop]
KYLE
I can't believe how cold it is out here.
CARTMAN
[pulls back and mulls his chances] Could be tough. But I'll give it a shot.
KYLE TWO
Alright. [both return to the bus stop]
KYLE
It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.
KYLE TWO
[formal introductions] Kyle, this is Cartman, my sort of... friend-ish.
KYLE
[goes over to greet Cartman] Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff?
CARTMAN
[weakening] ...Oh, man.
KYLE
[observes this and gets angry] Cartman?!
CARTMAN
[snaps into action] Uh, it's nice to meet you, Kyle. I can certainly tell you're a relative of my good friend Kyle here. [at that moment, a large wheel zips by the bus stop, and the kids cover their eyes]
STAN
What the hell was that?
[Neighborhood, day. Barbrady stops Craig's father in his car and is writing out a ticket when the large wheel zips by them.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Uh what the hell was that?
[Downtown South Park. People walk about doing stuff. The giant wheel zips by them as well, but few seem to notice]
STUART
What the hell was that?
RANDY
I dunno, it was going so fast I couldn't see it. [looks at Stuart] But I want one.
STUART
Yep, me too.
[Garrison's house, curb level. The giant wheel stops and two legs dismount. It's Mr. Garrison, beaming with pride and confidence]
MR. GARRISON
We've done it, Mr. Hat. Airline companies be damned. We've invented a whole new mode of transportation! Get some investors on the phone! [Mr. Hat doesn't move] Well what are you waiting for?!
[South Park Elementary, day. Class is now in session.]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
And I know you'll all be very nice to our new student. [To Kyle] Kyle, why don't you tell us a little about yourself?
KYLE
Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's from the same family. [Kyle Two buries his face in his hands] I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are.
CARTMAN
[resisting an urge] Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.
KYLE
...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker.
CARTMAN
[resisting mightily] I... must.. fight it! Need... forty... dollars!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Okay, why don't you go ahead and take a seat, Kyle? [Kyle goes to the desks, looks around, then runs around]
KYLE
Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Yes, unfortunately the school seems to be completely out of extra desks. So you'll just have to share with your cousin.
KYLE TWO
What?
KYLE
Eh, oh, alright. [moves to Kyle Two's desk and squeezes in, and that breathing is heard again]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[turns to the blackboard] Now let's get on with our lesson on the-
KYLE
Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.
CARTMAN
Ugh, ugh!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[faces the class] I'm sorry, Kyle. You'll just have to make do. [turns to the blackboard again] Now let's get back to the le-
KYLE
Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death?
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[faces the class] Now Kyle, I need you to be quiet. In my class you need to be able to concentrate.
CARTMAN
Oh!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Concentration is the key to succeeding in my class.
CARTMAN
Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration camp. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit!
KYLE TWO
CARTMAN!
[News 4 Newsbreak. An anchor soon appears with a window of Mr. Garrison beside him]
ANCHOR
Kindergarten teacher Herbert Garrison has apparently invented a new vehicle that will give the airlines a run for their money. Mr. Garrison is putting the final touches on his top secret device, which he simply calls "IT". ["IT" appears in the window] So what exactly is "IT"? ["IT?" appears in the window] Here with a report is a Hispanic man with some gravy stains on his lapel. [a window with that reporter pops up and soon fills the screen. Behind him is the Garrison house, and a small crowd is standing outside]
HISPANIC REPORTER
Thanks, Tom, I-oh... [looks at his lapel and brushes some of the stain off] Thanks, Tom. So far, Herbert Garrison hasn't let anyone get a look at his invention. He claims that the vehicle is sooo genius and revolutionary that it could cause one's eyes to bleed if not properly prepared to see it. But earlier today HBC News got footage of some of the country's top investors and richest people who have been invited for a first look, including: Steve Forbes [seen exiting a black limo], Steve Jobs [seen exiting a white limo], Ted Turner [seen exiting a helicopter], Donald Trump [seen exiting a private jet], Bill Gates [seen leaving his own ship, the U.S.S. Bill Gates XP], and Yasmine Bleeth [seen exiting a small dingy car and wiping her nose]. Their curiosity is piqued, Tom, and so is ours. What is "IT"? What does "IT"do? And when will IT be somewhere where I can buy one? Reporting live, Jeff Arrando [trills the Rs], HBC News.
[Playground, day. Kids are on swings, hobby elephants, slides, etc, as the camera pans across. At the end of the pan, Kyle and Kyle Two face each other in a clearing]
KYLE TWO
You need to learn to play some sports, Kyle. So we're gonna start with a tough one called, "Catch the Ball." I throw the football to you; you throw it back to me.
KYLE
Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands.
KYLE TWO
It's fine!
KYLE
Alright then, hu-how do I catch it?
KYLE TWO
Ih it's a football, dude. You just- put your arms out and catch it. [Kyle's arms spread out] Alright, here we go. [throws the ball, and it lands in the snow in front of Kyle, who just looks at it]
KYLE
Now what?
KYLE TWO
Now throw it back to me.
KYLE
But it's down in the snow.
KYLE TWO
...So dig it out.
KYLE
But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands.
KYLE TWO
...Well, then we'll dry them off!
KYLE
Alright, then. [walks to the ball and digs it out]
KYLE TWO
[turns away] Oh my God.
CARTMAN
[offscreen] Kyle, Kyle! [arrives] I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people were sent to concentration camps.
KYLE TWO
[Angrily] Yeah! They WERE, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea.
KYLE TWO
You did, too! You are so full of crap!
CARTMAN
No, I'm seriously! Because, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, "Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps?" And I was all like, "No way!" And this little light went on in my head like, "Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin." But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan. [Kyle Two gets even angrier] What a misunderstanding, huh? [tries to be chummy with Kyle. Kyle brushes him off]
KYLE TWO
You blew the deal, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Goddamnit, give me another chance!
KYLE TWO
[his cousin walks up behind him with the football] Nuh-uh, I knew you were gonna make fun of my lame cousin, so I paid you the forty bucks NOT to rip on him! You ripped on him, deal's off!
KYLE
Uh you did what? [Kyle Two blanches]
KYLE TWO
[puts his mittens up to his cheeks] Oh no.
CARTMAN
Haha, [slaps him on the back] serves you right, asshole. [leaves]
KYLE
You, you paid your friends tuh... [hangs his head] not make fun of me?
KYLE TWO
Look, ih it's not because anything's wrong with you.
KYLE
Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me.
KYLE TWO
Kyle, I-eh I'm sorry.
KYLE
Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.
KYLE TWO
What?
KYLE
Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go.
KYLE TWO
Uh-uh-uh oh, dude. Uh [shuffles away]
KYLE
Boy it sure is dry out here.
[Mr. Garrison's house, backyard. The invited guest sit in two rows of chairs]
MR. GARRISON
Gentlemen, imagine being able to travel safely at incredibly fast speeds, and not having to go to the stupid fartface airports!
MR. HAT
That sounds incredible, Mr. Garrison.
MR. GARRISON
It IS incredible, Mr. Hat. And what makes IT possible [the back gate open and Kyle walks in] is IT's patented gyroscope design. [he backs up and unveils the vehicle] Gentlemen, I give you, IT!
GUESTS
Whoa.
STEVE FORBES
Nice.
DONALD TRUMP
Sweet.
MR. GARRISON
IT gets over 300 miles to the gallon, and is safely capable of speeds of over 200 miles per hour.
GUESTS
Whoa. Wow.
BILL GATES
This will change everything.
STEVE JOBS
We're going to have to rethink cities!
MR. GARRISON
[puts on a helmet] Now, IT is easily operated using four flexigrip handles. Two of them are on each side. Left side for throttle, right side for steering. [operates each one as he describes it] The third flexigrip is gently inserted into the anus, to keep the driver in place. [gets into the wheel and activates the flexigrip. It extends into his anus and he groans as it locks him in.]
GUESTS
Ugh. Oh.
MR. GARRISON
...there we go. Now, the final flexigrip is directly in front of the driver so that its small switches can be operated with the mouth, as such. [begins to suck on the flexigrip, then stops] Put the four together and we're ready to go. [gets the four flexigrips to work in unison and the vehicles takes off, first one way...]
STEVE JOBS
Oh my God! [...and then the other. The guests turn to see IT zoom across the yard]
STEVE FORBES
Look at it go! [Garrison crashes through the fence and disappears in the distance. Kyle, standing next to the new hole in the fence, isn't hurt]
BILL GATES
But the way it works... do you think people will go through that to travel?
STEVE FORBES
Hey, it... still beats what you go through at the airports.
GUEST 1
True.
GUEST 2
Yup.
GUEST 3
Yeah, that's true.
GUEST 4
Yeap.
[The Broflovski house, night. Two lights are on]
[Kyle Two's room. Stan is writing in a book as Kyle speaks]
KYLE TWO
I can't take it anymore, Stan. My cousin's been here for two weeks and he's driving me insane.
STAN
I know, dude. Every kid in school wants to kick his ass.
KYLE TWO
I spent five years in this town making a good name for Jews and this... this... stereotype shows up and wrecks it all! You know what my biggest fear is? That I'll become him. That somehow his mannerisms will start rubbing off on me, and I'll become a stereotype. I mean, I'm a Jew and he's making me hate Jews.
STAN
Dude, a self-hating Jew? You are becoming a stereotype.
KYLE TWO
Ya see?
KYLE
[opens the door] I'm ba-ack!
KYLE TWO
[slaps his head] Ugh.
STAN
Book. Later, dude. [leaves the desk, walks to the door and around Kyle, and exits. Kyle Two gets out his own writing book and starts writing. Kyle's breathing can be heard, and Kyle Two stops. Kyle eats a bit of cracker and Kyle Two resumes writing. After a while he grimaces, then buries his face in his arms]
[South Park, day. The day for IT's unveiling is here, and it's being offered at Better Buy. Another camera focuses on the Hispanic reporter]
JEFF ARRANDO
Tom, the day is finally here. IT has arrived for retail sale, and people are getting their first look at it.
MR. GARRISON:
[showing Craig's father how it works] Okay, good. Just step through here [the man does so] And then this is your steering and here's your throttle.
CRAIG'S FATHER
Okay. [starts working the flexigrips]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, now you're just gonna feel a little pinch.
CRAIG'S FATHER
[feeling it] HAAAOW!
MR. GARRISON
It's alright, it's just locking you in. [some more groans from the man] You can take it. [looks up to see another rider] Doing great, Kathy. How's that ride? [she mumbles something, gives a thumbs-up, and continues driving. Garrison goes back to Craig's father] Okay, now use your mouth to operate the turn signals, and you're off. [the man gets all four flexigrips going, and he begins to roll down the street. Two men bring out a new one] Great! Who else wants to give it a spin? [an elderly woman steps forth grinning]
[In front of Better Buy. IT drivers move about as Randy and Stuart look on. Craig's father rolls to a stop next to them]
RANDY
Oh, man, it that the IT?
CRAIG'S FATHER
Hehyeah.
STUART
How is it?
CRAIG'S FATHER
Well, ugh. Ih ih it beats dealing with the airline companies, that's for sure. [rolls on]
[Neighborhood, day. The boys have Kyle on a sled, which is tied to...]
KYLE
I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous.
KYLE TWO
Look, Kyle. Sledding is something all kids out here do. You've gotta learn.
KYLE
It seems like I might get splinters, though.
KYLE TWO
[moves to the front of the sled to face his cousin] Remember: Just hold on. No matter how long the sledding run lasts, hold on.
KYLE
Hold on. I see. [...a bus. It revs up and leaves, headed for Connecticut. The rope between the bus and sled tightens, and the sled takes off] Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast.
KYLE TWO
[calls out] Hang on!
KYLE
I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus! [the bus goes around a corner and is gone]
KYLE TWO
How far do you think it is to Connecticut?
KYLE
It's a least a couple of hours.
KYLE TWO
Think he'll be alright?
CARTMAN
[leaving] He's faaahn.
[Commercial]
ANNOUNCER
[shot of a plane in the air, then of a full cabin] Are you tired of corporate airline companies treating you like a worthless sardine? [angry faces crowded into each other] Tired of ridiculous lines and horrible security at airports? [angry, vocal crowds yelling at security guards who seem to be taking their time. Next: shot of the plane in midflight again] Well, now there is an alternative to airline travel. [Next shot, an IT zooming down the road. The camera now moves along with IT] IT. [the driver leans to the left a bit to see where he's going] IT has taken the country by storm. [A J-mart is shown, and several ITs are parked out in the lot] And already two million have been sold. [An IT driver is shown going down the street. Another IT driver passes him] Never have another important business trip ruined by airline incompetence. [two elderly women ride to the edge of a canyon] Hey ladies! How did you get to the Grand Canyon? [they answer, but their voices carry and blur in the canyon. Next shot: a woman exits her house with her baby] IT comes in sizes for the entire family.
WOMAN
[putting the baby, Robby, into his own small IT.] Here you go, Robby. [Robby cries]
JOHN TRAVOLTA
[in a studio stage, Stage C, somewhere, gets off his chair] Hello, I'm John Travolta. I used to rely on airlines to get me to set, but once I got used to IT, [walks over to IT and gets in] I found it to be a little less painful than dealing with the airline companies. I just power up the flexigrips. [groans in pain as the anal flexigrip takes hold] And I'm ready to go. Thank you, IT. [revs up and takes off.]
ANNOUNCER
[a shot of ITs entering and leaving a parking lot] So join the millions of Americans who have felt a little more comfortable with... traveling. [the oral flexigrip squirts something in a driver's eye. The IT logo appears] Order yours today and remember our slogan: IT's better than flying.
[Kyle's house, living room. Kyle Two has finished watching the commercial]
KYLE TWO
...Hm, that was pretty gay. [starts humming, and Sheila enters the room]
SHEILA
Kyle Two, where is Kyle?
KYLE TWO
[poised] I don't know, Mom. Last time I saw him he was sledding.
SHEILA
Where on earth could he be? [starts to leave]
KYLE TWO
You know, it's just possible he went back to Connecticut.
SHEILA
[quickly returns] What?
KYLE TWO
Well, ah I mean, maybe he got so worried about his mom that found a way to get back and see her.
SHEILA
Don't be ridiculous, Kyle Two. He's out playing with his new friends.
KYLE TWO
I'm just throwin' it out there as a possibility. [the doorbell rings and he goes to answer the door]
KYLE
[at the door] I'm ba-ack.
KYLE TWO
AAA!
KYLE
[enters] I'm sorry. You must've been worried sick. I got your sled tangled up with a bus. [looks at Kyle Two]
KYLE TWO
A, a bus. R-really?
SHEILA
[rushes up] Kyle, what happened to you??
KYLE
Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas. [gives Kyle Two the remains of the sled] I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle.
KYLE TWO
Oh no- don't worry about it, dude.
SHEILA
Oh you poor thing! Come upstairs and we'll get you out of those wet clothes. [leads him away. Kyle Two looks dismayed] Are you alright?
KYLE
Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long.
[IT dealership, day. The IT has grown so popular it's left Better Buy for its own sale space. The camera pans across the showroom floor to Mr. Garrison, seated in front of an IT Motors Inc. sign. He's got a stack of bills to his right and a computer to his left, all on a futuristic desk]
MR. GARRISON
We're in the money, Mr. Hat, We're in the money, Mr. Hat... [Jimbo, holding his lower back, walks up to Mr. Garrison] Oh hi, Jimbo. Can I help you?
JIMBO
Yeah, I wanted to order that theft alarm for my IT.
MR. GARRISON
[reaches under his desk and pulls out a form] Oh, right, right. Take a seat.
JIMBO
Uh, that's okay, I'll stand.
MR. GARRISON
[Randy walks up to the desk] What do you think, Mr. Marsh? All set to put a down payment on that baby?
RANDY
Well, yeah, but I have one question about the way it works.
MR. GARRISON
Sure.
RANDY
Well, [walks back to IT] it seems all the buttons on these front and rear flexigrips are also found on the side of the vehicle.
MR. GARRISON
Yeup.
RANDY
[returns to the desk] Well... so... they don't really... do anything.
MR. GARRISON
Right.
RANDY
So then, couldn't I just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth?
MR. GARRISON
[thinks about this a moment] Well, I... guess you could. [a view of the showroom]
MAN 1
Huh?
MAN 2
Whazzat?
MAN 3
Wha- what did you- what did he say?
MAN 4
What?
[Denver International Airport, day. A plane takes off. Inside the terminal the boys and Kyle stand around]
KYLE
I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous.
KYLE TWO
Kyle, we told you: Kids in Colorado all play hide and seek at the airport.
STAN
Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is.
KYLE TWO
[leans towards Stan and in a low voice] Ungh, this is taking too long. The flight to Connecticut is about to leave. [looks at the guard] Ey! Can we speed things up here??
SECURITY GUARD
Daaah, sorry, but ever since that IT thing came out the airlines have had to cut back on employees.
KYLE TWO
Dude, we're the only ones here! How long does it take five people through security?!
SECURITY GUARD
Derr, let's see: Twelve people... plus... times... divided... two hours domestic, three hours international.
KYLE
Can't we just play hide and seek at home?
KYLE TWO
No!
SECURITY GUARD
[to Kenny] Dah ha! What's this?! A toenail clipper! [rises to his feet and aims a gun at Kenny] Die, terrorist! [kills him with one shot]
KYLE
Oh, Jesus!! [the corpse starts to bleed]
SECURITY GUARD
See, we do these checks for a reason!
KYLE TWO
This is ridiculous! Come on! [leaves. The others except Kyle follow. Cartman stops and pulls Kyle away. The boys head through some doors designated for employees only, with security bypass]
[Tarmac, outside. The boys stop at a plane ready to take off]
KYLE TWO
Okay, Cartman, you're it. Start counting. [Kyle Two pulls Kyle away, Stan follows]
CARTMAN
[turns toward the landing gear and buried his face in a wheel, then starts counting] 1, 2, 3, 4...
KYLE TWO
[Stan and Kyle Two stop at a box] Here, Kyle. You go hide in here. [shows him the box]
KYLE
In there? But it's very confined. I'll get cramps in my legs.
KYLE TWO
JUST GET IN THE BOX!
KYLE
Uh, alright then. [goes in. Stan and Kyle Two quickly seal the box with wrapping tape and carry it off] Oh, would you look at that? I've got a corn on my ankle. [the two boys toss the box into a luggage cart, an employee tosses the box onto the conveyor, and it falls into the cargo bay with the other luggage] Now where did that one come from? That's the fourth one I've had- [the plane taxis to the runway and is ready to take off]
KYLE TWO
I hope he doesn't suffocate.
CARTMAN
[leaving] He's faaahn.
STAN
Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back at home. [he and Kyle watch the plane lift off]
KYLE
Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast! [as the plane climbs, the side of it is shown: Air Antarctica] Oh, I did it again!!
[IT dealership, day. Crowds mill around the dealership. Federal agents raid the building and start hauling ITs away. Mr. Garrison isn't pleased]
MR. GARRISON
Excuse me, what the hell are you doing?
AGENT 1
It's alright, we're with the government.
AGENT 2
We're just shutting you down.
MR. GARRISON
Shutting me down? Why?
AGENT 3
[the first two agents exit with an IT] The airlines are in desperate trouble. Your vehicle is causing them to lose money.
MR. GARRISON
Yeah, well that was the point, dingleberry! Ah-t put that down!
AGENT 4
Right, so the government is bailing the airlines out again, by shutting you down and making ITs illegal.
MR. GARRISON
OH, GOD-DAMNIT! You'd better be kidding! [pounds the desk]
AGENT 5
Sir, many people work for the airlines. We can't let them all be fired.
MR. GARRISON
THE AIRLINE COMPANIES ARE LOSING MONEY BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN INCOMPETENCE AND THEIR OWN INEFFICIENCY!!
AGENT 6
That may be true. But if you build, sell, or ride another IT, "it" will be the last time. Have a nice night. [the agent and his partner walk off with the last IT and Garrison is left with a barren showroom]
MR. GARRISON
HWAAAAHHH! Airline motherfuckerrrs! You pieces of shiiit! Cocksucking sons of bitch airlines! [the agents, in their black cars and big rigs, leave]
[The Broflovski house, night. In the living room, Sheila paces the floor as Kyle sits on the sofa]
SHEILA
Oh, it's been days! Where can he be?
KYLE TWO
I dunno, Mom. It's like he vanished into thin air.
SHEILA
I'm gong to call the police again. Kyle Two, go down to the playground and look there.
KYLE TWO
[gets off the sofa] I already checked the playground, Ma. [reaches the front door and opens it] I told you, he isn't really- [turns in astonishment to see Kyle back at the front door]
KYLE
I'm back.
KYLE TWO
GAAAH! [hangs his head in dismay]
SHEILA
[offscreen] Kyle! [Kyle enters] You're back!
KYLE
Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh, it was so dry down there.
[The Broflovski house, a few days later. Stan and Cartman approach the door. Inside, Kyle is standing in the living room, his arms crossed. He's clearly pissed off. The door opens, and Stan and Cartman walk in.]
STAN
So dude, did Cartman's idea work?
KYLE TWO
No. I tried getting my cousin lost in the woods, but a stupid bear brought him home.
STAN
Damn!
KYLE TWO
I just have to face facts that I'm goin' to live with my crappy cousin forever.
KYLE
[approaching with Sheila, carrying suitcases, ready to go home] Well, Kyle, I I gotta go.
KYLE TWO
[the boys are stunned] ...What?
KYLE
Yeah, I've gotta get back to Connecticut.
SHEILA
Now that things have changed for Kyle, his mother needs him back.
KYLE TWO
[gasps in relief and turns to Kyle] Do you promise?? [steps back] I mean, oh. Thah-uh that's too bad, dude. What, what changed for you?
KYLE
Well, I- I invested in that IT thing, and there was a bailout, so I received a five million dollar bailout clause check, which, which I can use to help my family, so, I- I guess, goodbye, cousin. [heads for the door with Sheila]
KYLE TWO
Okay. See ya, cousin. Hope to see ya soon. [once Kyle is out of earshot, says in a low voice] Not too soon, I hope.
STAN
Yeah, haha.
CARTMAN
Heheheheheh. [the door is heard opening and they realize what Kyle just told them]
ALL THREE
Five million dollars??? [they quickly rush up to Kyle and block him from leaving the house. Sheila is already outside]
KYLE TWO
Dudedudedude! You- you have five million dollars??
KYLE
Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya.
KYLE TWO
[holds his palms out] Wait. Kyle, this may sound crazy, but I think you should stay!
STAN, CARTMAN
Yeah!
KYLE
Re- really?
KYLE TWO
Yeah. You see, I've learned something today. [Sheila watches from outside, waiting for Kyle. Music starts up] Sometimes people have trouble fitting in at, at school and,... [music dies] and um... Let's see, what did I learn about? [voice fading, strokes his chin] What did I learn about today?
CARTMAN
[steps forth] I- I, I learned that... you shouldn't judge somebody because... that-no, wait.
KYLE TWO
Nonono, it was good! What were you going to say?
KYLE
Listen, guys, I appreciate you wanting me around, but, the fact of the matter is, well, yeh, you guys are just kind of douche bags.
KYLE TWO
... Uhwhat?
KYLE
I mean, yeyou people are all just such hick jock rednecks; it's just like you right out of a stereotyped catalog. [picks up his suitcases and goes towards the door] Ah I can't take it. See ya. [walks out and joins his aunt to the car. The boys are left stunned, having been judged and found wanting once again]
KYLE TWO
Dude! Weak.
CARTMAN
[turns to Kyle] ...Good job, Jew!
End of The Entity

synopsis:Tolkien is tired of being the only rich kid in town, and succeeds in attracting several other wealthy families to South Park

script:Here Comes the Neighborhood

[South Park Elementary, day. Butters stands in front of the class witha small volcano - his science experiment.]
BUTTERS
...And so, just like in nature, ah I can add the mixture into the volcano and... [throws his head back, closes his eyes, and chants] O Pele! God of Fire! Show us you uh- [the belching volcano draws his attention as it coughs up the "lava"] Aw, it's all uh g-gooey.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Okay, good job, Butters. You get a check.
BUTTERS
Ah, thank you, Ms. Choksondik! [wheels his experiment back to his desk] I got a check. That's like a C!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Okay. Whose project should we look at next? How aboouuut Eric? [tape is heard leaving its spool] Eric Cartman?
CARTMAN
[wrapping something together] Stand by, please.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
NOW Eric!
CARTMAN
[leaving his seat] Oh, god dammit!
KYLE
Haha!
CARTMAN
Shutup, Jew! [moves to the clearing, turns around, and faces the class. He clears his throat] Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
You just put that thing together just now! I'm giving you a check minus.
CARTMAN
Oh GODDAMMIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Siddown. [Cartman walks towards his desk]
CARTMAN
I'll make you eat your parents!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
What did you say?!
CARTMAN
Nothing! [takes his seat]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright, Tolkien, you're next. [Tolkien leaves his seat carrying a laptop computer, then turns towards the class]
TOLKIEN
Using my laptop computer, I hooked into the Internet and found a meteorology Web site. [pops open the case and displays the page] I donwloaded the data, and with my dad's video projector, I can show you the graph I made of predictable weather patterns over the next three months. [pulls the projector over and plugs it into the laptop, then runs the graph. The resulting projection shows cloud formations moving across the U.S. Ms. Choksondik is impressed]
CLYDE
Wwooww.
TOLKIEN
[turns around and shows some sheets to the class] I also printed out the results on my color printer. Here you are, Ms. Choksondik. [hands her the papers]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Very very good, Tolkien. You get a check plus.
TOLKIEN
Alright! [goes back to his seat with his laptop]
CARTMAN
Aw, that is such bullcrap!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[sigh] Eric, for the love of God. [drops her head down to her desk]
CARTMAN
No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Tolkien was able to do all that is because his family is rich!
TOLKIEN
My family isn't rich.
CARTMAN
Oh, come on, Tolkien! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!
STAN
Your family is rich, dude.
TOLKIEN
But I...
CARTMAN
[leaves his seat and walks over to Tolkien] Let's just see where Tolkien's clothes come from, shall we? [tugs at his sweater] Ooooo, Armani Exchange!
KYLE
Aharmani Exchange?
CARTMAN
All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been inside a J mart, Tolkien?! [Tolkien opens his mouth to say something, but shuts it up instead] I didn't think so! [moves back to his seat.]
STAN
Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table.
BUTTERS
Yeah. And their own sprinkler system. You don't think you're rich? [zoom in on Tolkien's face as he realizes they may be right]
[Tolkien's house, after school. His parents are at the sofa. His father reads a newspaper; his mother, a book. Tolkien walks in]
LINDA
[notices and lowers her book] Hello Tolkien. How was school today?
TOLKIEN
Mom? Dad? Why do we have a bigger house than everybody else in South Park? [both parents blink and lower their reading materials]
BOB
Well, because we have more money, son.
TOLKIEN
I know. But why?
BOB
...W-well, because we went to graduate school and therefore have more lucrative jobs than most people in town. For instance, your mother is a chemist for a pharmaceutical company, whereas your friend Eric Cartman's mother is a crack whore. One pays more than the other.
LINDA
Why, sweetie? What's the matter?
TOLKIEN
All the kids at school made fun of me today because I'm rich.
BOB
...Oh.
TOLKIEN
I don't wanna be rich anymore! I wanna eat macaroni and cheese for dinner and, and wear clothes from J mart!
LINDA
[voice quivering] J mart?
BOB
[comforts Linda] Son, you, you don't know what you're saying.
TOLKIEN
I just wanna be like all the other kids in South Park. Please, Mom and Dad, please. [his parents blink and look at each other]
[J mart, later. A small SUV pulls into the J mart lot. Tolkien takes his first look at J mart. He is awed by it and pleased at the chance to shop there.]
BOB
You... sure you want to do this, son?
TOLKIEN
I'm sure. [the SUV stops and Tolkien hops out. His parents follow, but just stand by the car]
LINDA
Hmmm...
BOB
Where's the... valet?
LINDA
He must be parkiing someone else's car.
BOB
Ah, here we go. [moves to his right as a man approaches and stops the man] Take good care of it, please. [puts the keys in the man's hands] Here's twenty dollars. [the man just stands there. The family walks into J mart through the center doors] Hoh? [shields his eyes from the lights] They've activated some kind of alien blinding device.
TOLKIEN
That's not a blinding device, Dad. It's fluorescent lighting.
BOB
[relaxing] Oh.
LINDA
[calling out] Excuse me, where can where would we find young men's fashion apparel? [an obese blonde woman appears]
OBESE WOMAN
Aisle 6, next to the pretzels.
BOB
[eyes widen] Next to the-?!
TOLKIEN
Come on! [runs forth. His parents follow, his father shielding his eyes. Tolkien stops at a clothes rack and pulls out a pair of pants] Hey look: there pants are only five bucks apiece. They must really suck. What do ya think?
LINDA
What, what brand are they?
TOLKIEN
It doesn't matter, Mom. They're poor people pants.
RANDY
[nearby with Sharon, who is checking out toilet paper] Hey, uh, Sharon? Isn't that the Williamses?
SHARON
[puts the paper in the shopping cart] Huh? [looks to see] Oh. Yeah, it is. [they see Tolkien look at more pants] What are they doing here? They can afford to shop at Cherry Creek. [nearby two shopping carts clash]
LIANE
Do you see that, Sheila? The Williamses are shopping here.
SHEILA
I don't get it. He must pull in at least two hundred thousand a year. [others stop and stare as Tolkien brings out another pair of pants for comparison. More people stop and stare, and a long silence follows]
BOB
S-son, can you just hurry it up? I don't think we quite fit n here.
[Stan's house, afternoon. In the living room, six boys are gathered on the floor around a board game: Clockwise: Craig, Tweek, Clyde, Cartman, Stan, Kyle]
CARTMAN
Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars.
TOLKIEN
[enters the room] Hey you guys. [has a DVD under his arm]
STAN
Oh hey, dude. Did you bring the movie?
TOLKIEN
I sure did.
CARTMAN
Hey, you changed your clothes, Tolkien.
TOLKIEN
Yeah, well, you know, I did a little shopping at J mart.
STAN
[gets up and walks over to Tolkien] Alright, well, let's just watch the Lion King. Cartman's cheating anyway. [stops next to Tolkien]
TOLKIEN
Here you go. [hands him a DVD disk]
STAN
[looks at the disk] What's that?
TOLKIEN
It's a DVD of the Lion King
STAN
DVD? We don't own a DVD player.
KYLE
Yeah, dude. [rises and joins Stan and Tolkien] Nobody does. They're too expensive.
CARTMAN
Not too expensive for Tolkien's rich ass family, apparently. [the others laugh and gether around Tolkien]
CRAIG
Don't you have a VHS of it?
TOLKIEN
I only have this.
CARTMAN
[takes the DVD and holds it up] Oh, well, let me take this disk up to the Enterprise and see if Captain Kirk can decrypt it. [the others laugh]
TOLKIEN
What's a VHS?
CARTMAN
Oh, Jesus, dude. [Lowers the disk and laughs with the others]
STAN
Come on, guys. We'll just have to find other stuff to do. [heads for the door]
KYLE
[jokingly] What's a VHS? [laughs and the others laugh as they head for the door. Cartman tosses the DVD to Tolkien, but it just falls to the floor.]
[Tolkien looks at the DVD, then at the boys, then at the DVD. He lets the DVD case fall to the floor on top of the DVD and leaves the house. Music comes up as he leaves the Marsh house]
TOLKIEN
Why can't I be like all the other kids?
[sees Kenny and brother Kevin playing on their lawn. Kenny is flying around getting dizzy while Kevin plays with a deflated basketball.]
They all have three-bedroom homes, broken trucks on their lawns.
[hops onto a wooden box and peeks in - he sees Butters eating]
And cut-up hot dogs for lunch
It's not my fault my parents succeed so much.
[leaves the window and walks over to Stark's Pond, then sits and pulls out a dollar coin from a small collection. The pond has thawed, and lily pods can be seen on the water. Tolkien tosses the coin, and it skips across the water. He then walks on and stops across the street from the South Park Welfare Office. Craig and his family leave the office with their welfare check as Cartman and mom walk in.]
There's no one in town I can relate to.
I play with autographed baseball bats
[he fades into a baseball uniform and holds a bat with Barry Bonds' signature on it]
while everyone else just plays with sticks and pine cones
[across the street he sees a baseball game, with Kyle pitching, Cartman catching, Stan at bat, Clyde in left field, and three other boys. Sticks and cones are being used. Stan hits the cone. It sails away and Stan rounds the bases]
Has a boy ever felt so alone?
[drops his bat and glove and walks away, then stops and gets a look of determination.]
Well, who needs them anyway? I won't pretend to be something I'm not
[rushes home and goes to his desk to work on something - a 2-page tabloid ad extolling South Park as the next Aspen]
If I can't be poor, I've got to deal with what I've got.
If I can't be like them, what I need is more rich kids around,
So I'm not the only one, and then I won't be so... down.
[he finishes, puts the ad into a sturdy envelope addressed to Forbes Magazine Department with some bills, and goes to the window to look at the sunset. Outside, the camera pulls back from the window]
Please, God, send more rich kids...
To my...
Town
[As the camera pulls back, Tolkien's house is shown to be big indeed, with a three- or four-car garage set back some distance from the street. To the right, two more houses appear, but they are small next to the Williams house.]
[Next shot, a mansion in the Hollywood Hills. The camera pulls back to show Will Smith reading Forbes Magazine]
WILL SMITH
Ooo, look at this, honey. [his wife Jada walks up] A beautiful unspoiled town in the Rockies. This is just what we've been looking for!
JADA PINKETT SMITH
"Like Aspen was 30 years ago." Sounds nice.
WILL SMITH
We could buy hundreds of acres of land for next to nothing! And then I could finally live like a cowboy.
JADA PINKETT SMITH
Oh Will, the country would be such a nicer place to raise our kids!
WILL SMITH
O kids? [they show up]
OLDER BOY
Yes, Daddy?
WILL SMITH
How would you like to move to the Colorado Rockies?
OLDER BOY
The mountains, Daddy?
GIRL
Can we have horses?
OLDER BOY
O can we? Can we Daddy?
WILL SMITH
You bet!
KIDS
Hooray!
[South Park, soon after, day. A new four-story mansion rises in a new lot. A crane positions the new fountain in a circular driveway in front of the mansion. Tolkien grins as he watches the laborers work. A limosine and a moving truck pull up behind him. Will Smith and family pour out of the limo]
WILL SMITH
Well, here it is. Our home to be.
JADA PINKETT SMITH
Oh, Will, it's beautiful.
TOLKIEN
[turns to greet them] Hi! Welcome to the neighborhood!
WILL SMITH
Why thank you, young man. We're the Smiths.
OLDER BOY
Ah, a local boy. You shall be our new playmate. I'm Frederick. This is my sister Lisa, and my brother Daniel [the younger boy grins and waves]
TOLKIEN
I'm Tolkien.
LISA
Our daddy is a very famous actor. What does your daddy do?
TOLKIEN
Aah, he's a lawyer. I think.
WILL SMITH
How quaint. Kids, why don't you play with little Tolkien while your mother and I check out the town.
FREDERICK
Very well. Come, local boy. [the kids move off] Show us how to play your mountain games.
TOLKIEN
All right! [rushes to catch up to them, but returns and stops] Thanks, God. [runs to catch up with the others]
[Tolkien's mansion, later. Tolkien leads the Smith kids on a tour of the mansion]
TOLKIEN
...And this is the room where my mom and dad keep their original v-Van Gogh painting.
FREDERICK
Yes, yes, we have one of those, too. In fact, we have seven of them, I believe.
TOLKIEN
[with relief] You do? God, that's great!
DANIEL
Why?
TOLKIEN
I'm just so happy you guys moved into town. You see, I used to be the only rich kid. All the other families here are kinda [motions a low palm] low to [raises his arm to shoulder level] middle-income.
LISA
Why? What happened to all their money?
TOLKIEN
Well, they never really had any money.
LISA
Well, then, why don't their daddies just act in a movie?
TOLKIEN
Well I... think that.. they...
FREDERICK
Sometimes children must be very firm with their daddies.
LISA
Indeed.
FREDERICK
Like when Daddy doesn't want to act in a movie because he thinks the script is bad.
LISA
So we must plead with him: [falls on her knees] "Please, Daddy, please! It's twenty million dollard, Daddy."
DANIEL
[falls on his knees] "Please, Daddy, please!"
FREDERICK
[falls on his knees] "Twenty million is still twelve million after taxes, Daddy!"
LISA
"I want a llama, Daddy!"
FREDERICK
"I'd do the picture, Daddy!"
LISA
"Please, Daddy!"
FREDERICK
"Daddy, please!"
LISA
"Daddy, do the movie, Daddy!"
DANIEL
"But Daddy!" [all three rise]
FREDERICK
And so Daddy does the picture.
TOLKIEN
...That's ...great.
LISA
Twenty million dollars great.
[A recording studio. A rapper is laying down some tracks.]
SNOOP DOGG
I found a girl who had an innie and I felt her with my jimmy
Player-haters try to do me 'cause my rhymes are just tooo-
ENGINEER
Sorry, Snoop Dogg, but Will Smith is on line three for you?
SNOOP DOGG
Oh. [removes his headphones and answers the telephone] William! How are you buddy?
WILL SMITH
[back in South Park on a public phone] Great, Snoop Dogg, and you?
SNOOP DOGG
Couldn't be better. I'm just laying down some vocals for my new album.
WILL SMITH
[chuckle] Great, Snoop-Snoop. Listen: Remember how we always talked about wanting to buy property up in the mountains so our kids could ski and ride horses?
SNOOP DOGG
Oho yes, the kids bug me about it all the time.
WILL SMITH
Well I found the place, Snooty-roo. It's in the Rockies, but totally undiscovered, laid-back, and beautiful.
SNOOP DOGG
Ogh. It sounds lovely!
WILL SMITH
You really should come give it a look. Jada and I would love for some friends to move here with us.
SNOOP DOGG
I certainly will, William. And perhaps I'll give ol' Magic and Kobe Bryant a call. They've been looking for vacation properties as well.
WILL SMITH
Great! Well, let me let you get back to your recording.
SNOOP DOGG
Hah, see you soon. Bye. [hangs up and puts on his headphones]
WILL SMITH
Bye. [hangs up]
SNOOP DOGG
Alright, let's take it from the top, gang. [the rhythm starts up again and plays for a few seconds...]
I shout "Hell Yeah!" from my vehicle. Livin' is a miracle-
[South Park, day. Another rich family moves into town. Jimbo, Ned, and Mr. Garrison watch from across the street.]
MR. GARRISON
Look, there's more of them moving into our town. [other men join these three. Among them are Randy, Gerald, Stuart, and Skeeter] You know, Oprah Winfrey is building a house up on Cannon, and some Snoop Doggy Doo Doo buildin' a gigantic place up on Main.
JIMBO
Yep, there goes the neighborhood. [a shot of the new family headed for the house]
MR. GARRISON
That's the fifth family of them that's moved here. Seems like all of a sudden South Park is being overrun by those types.
GERALD
Hey! W-what are you saying? What "types"?
MR. GARRISON
[pointing] Yiou know, those types! Rich people! [shot of movers and family members moving furniture into the new home]
JIMBO
Oh. I don't take kindly to rich folk. Neither does Ned.
NED
Nnnope.
JIMBO
I remember back in the day, RICH folk weren't alLOWED in South Park! Now thery're movin' here in droves!
SKEETER
They're gonna be sending their kids to our schools, and mixin' them with our pure, non-rich kids!
MR. GARRISON
Oh, yeah, and it won't be long before they drove all of us poor underachieving people out of town with inflated real-estate costs!
SKEETER
Damn, I hate those stupid richers!
MR. GARRISON
Yeah. [calls out] Hey, rich guy! [a man holding a box of dishes is laughing at something his partner said, but both men look at Mr. Garrison, and the grin vanishes] Hey, Richie Rich! Yeah, I'm talkin' to you, richer! What's in the huge box, richer?! Your checkbook? [the men laugh]
JIMBO
Yeah. How many rich people does it take to screw in a light bulb? None! They can hire people to do it for them! [the men laugh again]
MR. GARRISON
Yeah. Hey, hey, you guys know why richers have such big garages? 'Cause they need a place for all their Porsches and boats and aircraft carriers! [the men laugh. The two black men just look at this crowd] Yeah, that's right, cashchucker! Go have fun with your two million dollar house! [laughs. The two men across the street look at each other, confused, and go into the house with the boxes they pulled from the truck]
JIMBO
I guess we showed them!
[Another house, nearby. A crane is positioning a swimming pool. Oprah Winfrey directs the workers from the edge of the lawn]
OPRAH WINFREY
A little to the left. That's great and- Let's put another pool over there. [a kid stands across the street, behind Oprah] Uh huh, good. [close-up in the kid - it's Tolkien. Frederick approaches him from screen left]
FREDERICK
Tolkien, these are Oprah's newly-adopted children, Dominique and Zizi.
DOMINIQUE AND ZIZI
Hello. [Lisa and Daniel join Frederick so that Dominique and Zizi are behind them]
TOLKIEN
Hi.
A BOY
[enters screen right] Cheerio!
FREDERICK
Ah, and these are Puff Daddy's kids: P Diddy Mini, P Poofy Bite-size, and Poppa Diddy Diddy Puff Fun-size.
TOLKIEN
Wow, my plan to get rich people here sure did work. Hey, I got a great idea! Let's all pack some lunches and go sledding.
LISA
Oh no, we're going shopping.
THE KIDS
[exulting] Shopping!
FREDERICK
Yes, come Tolkien. We're all going to head down to the mall and buy some of the stores. [the group begins to move screen left as Tolkien stands there]
TOLKIEN
Oh. Alright then. [turns right and joins the group]
[The local bar, night. It's pretty busy, with people chatting away and enjoying their beer. Some motion is seen outside the doors, and soon they open. Three rich men enter and scan the bar, then move to a nearby table and sit. One of them is Kobe Bryant]
KOBE BRYANT
'Scuse me, can ew get a couple of beers here? [the jukebox stops and all the bar patrons look at the new guests.]
SKEETER
They've got nice expensive beers for you across the street at the new Wolfgang Puck's.
KOBE BRYANT
That's alright, we just want some cheap beer tonight. [the men at the bar glare at the three men]
BARKEEP
...Maybe you didn't see the sign out front: This bar is for people livin' below their means ONLY!
MEN
Yeah!
KOBE BRYANT
This is a free country. I can have a drink wherever I want.
MAN 1
[stands up and urges] Come on, Kobe, let's just go.
KOBE BRYANT
This ain't over! This ain't over by a long shot! [leads his two friends out of the bar]
MR. GARRISON
[turns to the bar with the others next to him] Those richers are getting snooty. We've got to show those richers they're not welcome here!
NED
Nn-what do you mean?
MR. GARRISON
How about tonight, we sneak up to one of their houses, and right on their lawn we'll set fire to a big lowercase "t"!
JIMBO
Lowercase "t"?
MR. GARRISON
Yeah, for "time to leave"!
BAR PATRONS
Yeah!
MR. GARRISON
Jimbo, you take some folk and build a big wooden lowercase "t"! I'll take the rest and get some gas and torches ready!
MR. GARRISON
Alright!
[Kobe's mansion, night. Through a bay window he's seen reading his newspaper in an armchair near a fireplace. A FOOM is heard and a flicker of light is reflected on the walls outside Kobe's house. He notices, takes a hard look, rises from his chair and goes to the front door. He opens it, annoyed, but his expression changes to one of fright. He sees the lowercase "t" burning on the lawn]
KOBE BRYANT
Tee. T- Time to- leave?
MR. GARRISON
[from some bushes across the street] T is for "time to leave," cashchucker!
KOBE BRYANT
I'm callin' the police. [moves inside to make the call]
SKEETER
I think we scared 'im.
JIMBO
Yeah. Next house we'll do a capital T, to show 'em we REALLY mean business!
MEN
Yeah!
[South Park, new polo grounds, day. A group of rich kids gather to begin a polo game. They all ride on ponies.]
FREDERICK
Now Tolkien, polo is very simple. You simply must hit the williard into some cilium with your fracaman.
TOLKIEN
Well, yeah, but can't we just play without these uncomfortable uniforms? [the other players laugh]
FREDERICK
[playfully jabs Tolkien] "Can't we play without the uniforms?" Yes, um. Lert's eat caviar without Bellini's as well! [the others laugh] Now come, Tolkien, and remember: it doesn't matter who wins. It matters who wins three times in a row. Tally ho!
PLAYERS
Tally ho!
PLAYER 1
Oh!
PLAYER 2
Yay!
PLAYER 3
This is exciting.
PLAYER 4
Oh, Frederick, this is wonderful!
CARTMAN
What in the hell are they doing?
KYLE
Is that fun?
STAN
I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play.
CARTMAN
Well, let's just play our game, then.
KYLE
Alright.
CARTMAN
Alright, I'll start. I'll kick you in the nuts, Kenny! [goes over and kicks Kenny in the nuts - Roshambo has begin!]
KENNY
(Ow!)
KYLE
I'll kick you in the nuts, Stan! [goes and does so. Kenny kicks Cartman in the nuts. Cartman returns the favor]
STAN
I'll kick you in the nuts, Cartman! [leaves Kyle and kicks Cartman in the nuts. When he turns around Kenny kicks him in the nuts.]
CARTMAN
Kick his nutsack! [kicks Kyle in the nuts. Stan kicks Kenny in the nuts. Tolkien rides up and stops to watch the boys while the game continues. Soon, a player and horse ram into his and knocks him and his horse away - It's Frederick.]
FREDERICK
You see, you must pay attention, Tolkien. I was able to jollyrow your davishmere with a forecastle.
TOLKIEN
[rises and dusts himself off as his horse leaves] This game is too confusing. How about we have a snowball fight?
PLAYER
A snowball fight?
LISA
How barbaric.
FREDERICK
Yes, Tolkien, if you want to play such savage games, I suggest you go live with lions. [the other players laugh at him as we turns wand walks away from them.]
TOLKIEN
I don't fit in anywhere.
[South Park, another part of town. Bill Cosby and his two kids]
BILL COSBY
Oh boy, we're going to the zoo, and we can eat Jerro pudding. Ah, this is goin' to be fun kids. We're goin' to the zoo, we could eat the Jerro pudding and chocolate cake.
THOMAS
Hey! What are you doing? If you're going to ride the bus in South Park, you're gonna have to sit in the FRONT!
PASSENGERS
Yeah!
PASSENGER 1
Yeah, that's where the first-class seating is! [points to the front. The Cosbys rise and head for the front, where four seats are empty. His daughter takes a seat to his left, across the aisle, his son takes a window seat, and he takes the aisle seat next to his son.]
THOMAS
Yeah. How do you like that, richer?!
BILL COSBY
Well it's very nice, actually
THOMAS
Yeah, I'll bet it is!
BILL COSBY
Very, very comfy.
THOMAS
Uh huh, looks like it.
[A field, a while later. Tolkien stands there talking to someone]
TOLKIEN
Hello, my name is Tolkien. I don't fit in with all the kids at South Park Elementary so, I invited a bunch of rich kids to move to town. The problem is, I don't fit in with them, either. That's why I've come to live with you. [the camera pulls back to reveal the field is actually a lion's lair. A sign outside the lair says AFRICANUS LIONUS CARNIVORUS. A waterfall gurgles nearby and lions laze about] So if you'll have me and raise me as one of your own, I promise to be the best lion I could be. [two lions growl at him] Uuuh, yeah.
[Chef's house, day. Chef is seen shoveling snow off his driveway]
CHEF
Shovel that snow, babih, it's all nice, heavy and wet. Just- [he hears voices and spins around. A group of rich folk are marching in protest]
MILLIONAIRE PROTESTERS
We shall perservere. We shall perservere.
OPRAH WINFREY
You there, come march with us!
CHEF
For what?
OPRAH WINFREY
All the poor people in town think they can persecute and harass us decent rich folk.
WILL SMITH
So we're uniting and marching on the town square!
KOBE BRYANT
[raises his fist a la Black Power] The Million Millionaire March!
MILLIONAIRE PROTESTERS
Yeah!
OPRAH WINFREY
Come on, brother! [the protesters resume the march]
CHEF
But... I'm not rich.
WILL SMITH
[stops and looks at Chef] What? [the others stop]
CHEF
I'm just a school cafeteria chef. Ahah I don't make much money.
WILL SMITH
We'll give you a hundred dollars.
CHEF
Woo, fudge the snow now. [tosses the shovel away and joins the march]
MILLIONAIRE PROTESTERS
We shall perservere. We shall perservere.
CHEF
[with the others] I shall perservere. We shall perservere.
[The lions' lair at the zoo, later. Tolkien takes a raw steak and bites into it, growling]
TOLKIEN
RRrrr!! [rips a piece of steak off with his teeth and chews on it]
MILLY LARSEN
[rushes up to the lair cage] Look at the little black lion, Mommy. [her mother passes by with her little sister in a stroller]
MRS. LARSEN
He's cute, isn't he? [the girl rejoins her mom and walks away. Two lions growl at each other and stand up, then leap down off their rock and stand next to Tolkien. He move his steak out of their reach]
TOLKIEN
Roar! [the lions step back and look at each other]
LION 1
What are you doing here, boy?
TOLKIEN
You- you talked. I, I understood you. I must be becoming a lion!
LION 2
You're not becoming a lion. The only way you can do that is to see Aslan.
TOLKIEN
Who's Aslan?
LION 1
Very well, walk this way. [they walk off, and Tolkien gets on all fours to follow them. They go through a low entrance into a white cave in the middle of which sits a great lion - Aslan]
ASLAN
[regal voice] Is this the boy who's been living in our realm?
LION 2
Yes. [two other lions come in and watch]
TOLKIEN
Are... you... Aslan?
ASLAN
M-I am.
TOLKIEN
[rises] Well, I'm Tolkien
ASLAN
So, you want to live with the lions, do you?
TOLKIEN
Yes. Um. Great Aslan. I don't fit in anywhere else.
ASLAN
And what makes you think you can fit it with us?
TOLKIEN
Well, I don't know.
ASLAN
Do you like jokes?
TOLKIEN
What?
ASLAN
Jokes! You know, funny, hahaaa. Us lions love jokes.
TOLKIEN
...I like jokes a lot.
ASLAN
Mmm. Then there may be hoipe in you yet, young apprentice lion. Very well. We wihill let you stay, if... you can pull this thorn from my paw. [holds up his left paw. Tolkien looks at it, and Aslan moves it closer to him] Go on, try it. Pull my thorn! Come on! Pull my thorm! [Tolkien approaches it and pulls the thron out. Aslan farts and the two escort lions snicker softly] Ho ho ho ho ho ho! Ho ho! [the other lions burst out laughing]
TOLKIEN
So can I stay?
ASLAN
He-you may. But being a lion may be harder than you think.
[The local bar, later. The bar patrons watch a TV as a report is heard. Seen are Mr. Garrison, Randy, Stuart, Skeeter, Gerald, Jimbo, and Ned.]
REPORTER
[not seen yet] A billion billionaires are gathering their ranks and will be marchng on the town square tonight [now seen on TV] in South Park to petition the end of separate bars, bus seating and restaurants. It looks like it will be a great turnout, as some of the millionaires also paid several thousand Mexicans to march for them. [a marcher carrying a rake and shover hears this and turns around]
SKEETER
If they get that petition passed, it's all over.
JIMBO
I guess we learned our lesson: you can't fight rich folk; they're just too powerful.
MR. GARRISON
Now, come on! Is that any way to talk?
SKEETER
They won, Garrison. They can't be scared out of town.
MR. GARRISON
No! We just haven't scared them the right way! Think about it. What scares rich people more than anything? [the other men think about this for a second]
JIMBO
...Ghosts?
MR. GARRISON
Bingo! Rich people don't want to live in South Park if they think it's HAUNTED!
MEN
Yeah!
MR. GARRISON
Everyonen get some sheets from home! If we can't chase the richers out, we'll spook 'em out!
MEN
Alright! Yeah! Let's Go! Right!
[The zoo, lion's lair, night. The lions have eaten and lay about on the boulders. One by one, they belch and the others laugh. Tolkien sets his bowl down...]
TOLKIEN
Huuuunh [...and walks over to Aslan] Aslan.
ASLAN
Yes? What is it, young lion apprentice?
TOLKIEN
...I thnk I'm gonna go home now.
ASLAN
Home. But I thought your friends made fun of you at home.
TOLKIEN
They do. But, I guess I learned something today. You see, even though kids at South Park make fun of me, I still like hanging around them more than snobby rich kids or, lions. Even though I may be different from them, I still like my old friends best.
ASLAN
It sounds like you learned much, young lion apprentice. Very well. But before you go, perhaps you would like... a stick of gum?
TOLKIEN
[recalling that lions love jokes] ...No thanks.
ASLAN
Go on. It's spearmint!
TOLKIEN
No, because there's a spring in there, and if I pull the gum out, it's gonna hurt my finger.
ASLAN
Oh. So you don't want any gum then? Are you... sure? Go on, try it!
TOLKIEN
[pulls the stick out of the pack, and a small spring-loaded bar hits his thumb] Ow. [half-heartedly]
ASLAN
[leads the other lions in a bout of hysterics] That is good stuhuff! [continues laughing with the other lions]
TOLKIEN
[under his breath, as he leaves the lair] Jesus, lions suck!
[South Park town square, night, in front of the Mayor's office. The billionaires are present, and Will Smith is at the podium]
WILL SMITH
And so it is with great determination that us decent rich Americans have gathered to say: "We will be separated no more!"
MILLIONAIRES
Hooray!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
This certainly has been an enlightening evening. And as Mayor, I accept your petition and will abolish all separation laws.
MILLIONAIRES
Yeah!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
And I want to assure the nation that is watching that South Park is not a town of prejudice or bigotry.
VOICES
Woooooo!! ["ghosts" appear from behind the various town buildings and rush towards the millioaire crowd. They surround the crowd, still makign ghost noises. The millionaires are startled]
OPRAH WINFREY
What the-?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[shuts her eyes] God no. [Will Smith moves around not knowing what to do. A "ghost" spooks him]
WILL SMITH
AAAaaahhh! [the "ghosts" begin to disperse the millionaires]
MILLIONAIRE 1
Carl, do you see what I see?
CARL
Yes, Martin. I do believe this town is hainted. [two "ghosts" come up and startle Martin and Carl. Nearby, Will Smith's kids stand in a huddle, scared]
WILL SMITH
Kids! Go find the limo and get in! [the kids hurry off.]
SNOOP DOGG
[walks up to Smith] You didn't tell me this town was hainted!
WILL SMITH
I didn't know! [grabs Snoop and shakes him] I.. DIDN'T... KNOHOHOHOW... [both men turn and flee as several "ghosts" move in on them. The "ghosts" take their sheets off: it's Skeeter, Mr. Garrison, Gerald, and Randy]
SKEETER
It's working!
GERALD
They're scared to death!
[A mansion, the same one Mr. Garrison and the men saw earlier as they commented on the new richers moving in, night. The family rushes towrads the front door]
MILLIONAIRE
Pack up your things quickly! We've got to get out of here! [some "ghosts" pop out from the bushes and drive the family away with their haunting noises.]
[The town, night. "Ghosts" continue to chase the millionaires around. In the background, Stan leads a group of boys down the street. With him are Kyle, Cartman, Butters, Pip, Tweek, Clyde, and Craig]
STAN
Oh hey, there's Token. [Tolkien approaches them from the opposite direction]
TOLKIEN
Hey guys.
STAN
Dude, we're gonna play football. Do you wanna play?
TOLKIEN
You mean, you want me around?
STAN
Sure, dude, you're our friend.
TOLKIEN
Yeah, I know. But you guys always rip on me for bein' rich.
STAN
Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you.
KYLE
Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy.
BUTTERS
They sure do.
STAN
Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew.
KYLE
Right.
TOLKIEN
That's right, huh?
KYLE
And Stan for being in love with Wendy.
STAN
Yeah, I get it for that.
KYLE
And Cartman for being fat.
CARTMAN
Uh huh.
KYLE
And Cartman for being stupid.
CARTMAN
Yeah.
KYLE
And Cartman for having a whore for a mom.
CARTMAN
Hey.
KYLE
And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole
CARTMAN
Ey, you did me already!
TOLKIEN
You're right, guys. From now on, I'm fine with being made fun of for being rich.
STAN
Oh, but we're not gonna rip on you for being rich anymore.
TOLKIEN
You're not?
KYLE
No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy.
STAN
[walks past Tolkien] Yeah, so now you're a pussy. Pussaholic.
KYLE
[walks past Tolkien, behind Stan] Come on, Nurse Tolkien. We're gonna play football, you puss.
CARTMAN
[walks past Tolkien, behind Kyle] Pussy. [Pip walks by without saying anything]
BUTTERS
[walks past Tolkien, behind Pip] Heh yeah, later, puss.
CRAIG
[walks past Tolkien, behind Butters] Ha, that guy's a pussy. [drags a sled behnd him. On the sled is Kenny, dead and badly beat up, with his right eye hanging out of its socket. Tweek and Clyde bring up the rear, and Tolkien looks as they leave him behind]
TOLKIEN
[turns to face the other boys] Wait! I liked being ripped on for being rich better! [walks behind the other boys]
[The rich enclave, later. The men of South Park have succeeded in chasing the rich folks out of town, and they gather in front of a mansion. They take off their sheets]
SKEETER
That was it. We just saw the last of them speeding away in a van!
MEN
Alright!
GERALD
They were so scared, I'm sure they'll never be back!
MR. GARRISON
That's great! And now we can sell all their homes, and become... millionaires!
MEN
[confused] What?
JIMBO
But then you had us do all that for nothin'. Don't you see: If you get rich sellin' these homes, then there will still be rich people in South Park.
RANDY
Yeah. You'd become what you hate.
MR. GARRISON
Well yeah, but at least I got rid of all those damn ni-

synopsis:In a very special episode of "South Park," Cartman fights for Kenny's life when he speaks before Congress in favor of stem-cell research.

script:Kenny Dies

[Unplanned Parenthood, day. It has undergone renovation, so it looks softer. It's snowing outside]
[Inside, operating room. A woman is waiting on a hospital bed. She's quite pregnant. A doctor enters the room with a cart housing everything he needs for his work, and approaches the bed]
DOCTOR
Alright, Ms. Sanders, all ready for your abortion? [picks up her chart and reads as canned laughter is heard]
MS. SANDERS
Ready as I'm ever going to be, I guess. [the laughter quiets down a bit, but still rolls]
DOCTOR
Well, try to relax; It will all be over very soon. [more laughter]
MS. SANDERS
Docter, can we turn off that television? [switch to a wide shot of the room, and the television is seen. On screen is a comedy skit featuring Benny Hill and an elderly man. That's where the laughter comes from]
DOCTOR
[looks up first] Oh yes, I 'm sorry. [moves to turn off the set and a close-up of the skit is shown: Benny Hill, dressed as a constable, raps the old man on the head and then shoos him along. The set is turned off, and the doctor returns to the woman's bed.] Now, there is one more thing.
MS. SANDERS
What?
DOCTOR
Have you heard of stem-cell research?
MS. SANDERS
Uh-I've heard of it on the news, but... I don't know what it is.
DOCTOR
Well basically, a lot of amazing studies have shown that stem cells might be used to fight cancer and a myriad of other diseases. Right now, a lot of stem cells come from the tissue of aborted fetuses- [taps the woman's leg] ah- I'm sorry, unwanted children. And if you sign a release, that tissue can go to studies.
MS. SANDERS
Oh well, I suppose, if it can help others.
DOCTOR
The hope is that someday it might. [hands her the release form and she signs it]
MS. SANDERS
Well okay. [hands the form back to him]
DOCTOR
Great. [puts the form inside the cart] Well, here we go. [puts on his gloves]
[Hallway outside operating room. A vacuuming sound is heard for a few moments before a janitor passes by with a vacuum cleaner. The OR door opens and the doctor steps out with a small container]
DOCTOR
Nurse? [a nurse arrives] This is to go to Alder's Labs for stem-cell research.
NURSE
Yes, Doctor.
[The nurse takes the container and goes to the room next door. She types in a keypad combination and a song starts up: Willie Nelson's "On The Road Again." She pours the contents of the container into a bio-hazard bag and places the back into a secure box. Outside, an Alder's Research Group truck backs up to the loading dock on the outside of Planned Parenthood. Clinic personnel gather the boxes and place them inside the truck's trailer. Once the last box is in they close the trailer and the truck rolls away.]
[The highway, moments later. The truck rolls along to "On The Road Again." and the driver joins in the singing]
TRUCK DRIVER
...going places that I've never been
Seeing things that I may never see a- Uuugh! [a deer leaps into the read ahead of him and looks at him] Jesus Christ!! [swerves to avoid the deer and goes over a cliff, tumbling down its side. It lands somewhere below with its contents spilled all over the place. The driver is killed on impact, but the song continues to play...]
[The highway, moments later. A Big Wheel rounds a corner...]
CARTMAN
[rides along] My baby takes the morning train and she takes another home again. Hmm. [sees the trashed truck and its contents] What do we have heah? [strokes his chin]
[A cow pasture, later. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny sit among the cows burning cow dung. Kenny holds the match and lighter. The cows around them are grazing]
STAN
Well that burned a long time.
KYLE
Yeah, that was pretty good. [a cow near them drops five pellets and walks off]
STAN
[all three rush to the new dung] Oh dude, there goes one.
KYLE
[to Kenny] 'K go! [Kenny strikes a match and lights the dung, which yields a nice fire]
STAN, KYLE
Alright!
KENNY
(That's awesome) [coughs heavily]
KYLE
You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay?
KENNY
(All right. I'm fine.)
BUTTERS
[rushing up to them] Hehehey, fellas! Ah, hey fellas!
STAN
What, Butters?
BUTTERS
Eric says you gotta come to his house right away.
STAN
Tell him we're busy.
BUTTERS
Oh, ah, well, he knew you'd say that, so, he told me to tell you that you don't wanna miss this.
KYLE
What, did he lose a hundred pounds? [the boys laugh]
BUTTERS
Yeah, he ah knew you'd say that, too, so he said t'say, uh, up your ass, Jew. [the boys stop laughing and look at him] Yeah.
STAN
Alright, let's go see what he wants. [the boys turn right and leave. Butters stays behind and looks at the melted turds. He approaches, squats, and sticks his finger in it]
BUTTERS
Oh, it's all sticky. [wipes his finger off on his coat, leaving a streak of turd on it]
[Cartman's house, minutes later. The three other boys approach him in the living room. Cartman can barely contain his glee.]
KYLE
Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!
CARTMAN
Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe it!
STAN
What?
CARTMAN
Guess what I have sitting in my back yard?
KYLE
A trampoline?
CARTMAN
Better.
STAN
A boat?
CARTMAN
Better.
KENNY
(A football machine?)
CARTMAN
Better.
STAN
Well WHAT, Cartman?
CARTMAN
Thirty-three aborted fetuses. [the boys look back at him for a long time] Oh yes.
KYLE
...What? [closes his eyes in disbelief]
CARTMAN
Mint condition, tax free.
STAN
Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?!
KYLE
I'm leaving right now! [turns and heads for the door]
CARTMAN
Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle!
KYLE
[turns around] You've never watched the news, fatass! [rejoins Stan and Kenny] And what the hell does that have to do with anything?!
CARTMAN
Stem cells, numbnuts!
STAN
Stem cells?
KYLE
Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?!
KENNY
(What the fuck are stem cells?)
KYLE
They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases.
CARTMAN
[points at Kyle] It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest.
KYLE
...I hate you so much. [turns around and heads back for the door again. The others turn and follow. Kenny coughs again.]
CARTMAN
Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own!
[Cartman's house, later. He's up in his room placing cold calls to business he finds in the Yellow Pages.]
CARTMAN
Hello. Is this the University of Colorado Biology Department? ...Great, uh I understand you're currently doing research on stem cells? Kewl, because I'm currently in possession of some aborted fetuses that I'm looking to unload? ...Uh, how much do you pay? ...No, no, come on, ah I got a guy who's gonna give me eighty dollars a pound right now. ...How about a hundred? ...Oh you're breaking my balls- I, I'll think about it.

[later]
Bosnod Medical Group? ...Yeah, I called earlier about the stem cells and the fetuses? ...Okay, hi Randy, yeah. ...Oh yes, they've been kept in a cool temperature, yeah. ...These are primo fetuses, Randy, I wouldn't jerk you around. ...So what can your company give me for 'em? ...Oh Randy, you're breaking my balls here. ...You're breaking my balls, Randy.

[later]
Oh plehease! Okay, you tell me where you can get aborted fetuses for seventy cents on the dollar? You tell me, Chuck? ...Yeah, I didn't think so-You know, I'm just like the fetuses, Chuck. I wasn't born yesterday, either. Uh huh. ...So are you gonna talk to me, or are we just gonna keep bullshitting each other? Breakin' my balls, Chuck.

[later]
I gotta unload these fetuses, you wanna do some research. Are we talkin' here or what? You're breaking my balls. ...I'm telling you, if you let this deal pass you by, you're making a fetal mistake. [suddenly grins and covers the receiver with his right hand] That's a joke [removes his hand from the receiver] ...A hundred ten. ...Alright, alright, we got a deal. ...Good bye. [hangs up and relaxes, putting his feet up on his desk and his hands behind his head] Damn I'm good.
[Alder Research Group, some days later. Cartman enters, hauling the thirty-three aborted fetuses behind him in a wagon. Workers around the lab move stuff around]
RECEPTIONIST
Can I help you?
CARTMAN
Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyah?
RECEPTIONIST
Oh, right, the fetuses. We were very lucky you called. Our last shipment of fetuses was lost in a truck accident.
CARTMAN
[rips out a bill...] Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do I talk to about payment?
RESEARCHER
[in the background, walking by] This is awful, just awful!
RECEPTIONIST
Oh Larry! This young man has some new fetuses for research.
CARTMAN
[picks up and carries a box] You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch.
LARRY
[the researcher] Oh well, I'm sorry, but we can't buy those from you now.
CARTMAN
...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought them all the way down here already!
LARRY
I'm afraid the government has just put a ban on stem-cell research.
RECEPTIONIST
A ban? Why?
LARRY
Too many people were upset about using aborted fetal tissue for a study. It's too bad, too. We really coulda helped a lot of people.
CARTMAN
[Cartman's mouth opens in disbelief, then he gets angry] Ay! What the hell am I supposed to do with these things, huh?! Goddammit! [throws the box down on the floor, breaking it and spilling its contents. Now there are thirty-two aborted fetuses]
[South Park Elementary, next day. The kids are filling their seats. Stan and Kyle enter the classroom]
STAN
Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again.
KYLE
[he and Stan take their seats] Yeah, they're gonna get busted again.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[enters carrying a few books] Alright, class, let's take our seats. [sets the book down on her desk and turns to the class] Now, uh, before we get started, Stan and Kyle? Uh, the principal needs to see you in her office.
STAN
The principal? Aw, come on!
KYLE
We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
She needs to see you now! [points to the door. Stan and Kyle leave their seats, Kyle leading Stan]
KYLE
Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat.
[Principal Victoria's office, moments later. Stan and Kyle enter expecting the usual lecture, but are surprised to see their parents on either side of Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Hello, boys.
STAN
Wait. What's going on here? [he and Kyle back up a bit. Their parents join them]
KYLE
Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know.
MR. MACKEY
[Chef has joined the principal and Mr. Mackey] You didn't do anything wrong boys. We just need to talk to you. Have a seat. [the boys each take a chair and sit down] Boys, uh... your little friend Kenny went to the hospital last night, m'kay. [the boys look stunned] And well, he's pretty sick. [Sharon leans on Randy]
KYLE
Kenny's sick?
STAN
Well how sick?
CHEF
Children, Kenny has been diagnosed with a... terminal disease.
STAN
[after a pause] ...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right?
SHARON
Oh dear. [buries her face in Randy's shoulder]
STAN
Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better.
SHARON
Randy...
RANDY
They don't think so, Stanley. Your... your friend is terminally ill, and that means.. Well son,... th- that means he's going to be going to heaven soon.
KYLE
Wait. Kenny's going to die?
GERALD
...He might, Kyle.
STAN
[tearing up] ...But... he's our... fu... fufu- friend.
MR. MACKEY
We know, and that's why he's going to need you boys to be strong for him, m'kay? He needs you now more than ever.
STAN
No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!! [buries his face in Randy's arm and begins sobbing]
[Cartman's hosue, day. He's upstairs in his room placing cold calls anew.]
CARTMAN
Come on, Jack, you gotta be able to offer me more than that. ...Yes, I realize there's a ban on stem-cell research, but I've got thirty-some-odd human fetuses in my backyard! I'm sure there's other research your company can do with them. ...You'll take one? Okay, how much for one? ...Aw, Jack, you're breaking my balls here, Jack.:[later. There are now thirty-one]
Yes, hello, is this Captain Bly's Seafood Restaurant? ...Yeah, hi, I've got a shipment of about thrity-one of the most succulent shrimp from the West Indies. ...These are killer shrimp, Gary, your customers are gonna love 'em. ...What kind of price you payin' for shrimp? ...Oh, Gary, you're breakin' my balls, Gary. How about ten and a quarter? ...Balls, Gary. Breakin' 'em. ...Alright, I'll call you back. [hangs up and sighs deeply]
LIANE
[opens the door and looks in] Sweetie, your friends are downstairs. They need to see you.
CARTMAN
Not now, Mom, I've only unloaded three feti; I've gotta sell the rest before they spoil.
LIANE
They say it's an emergency.
CARTMAN
[shifts in his chair] Buh, alright. [Liane leaves] eh, Butters?
BUTTERS
[steps into view in Cartman's room] Uh, yeah?
CARTMAN
Are you through databasing the clientele sheet?
BUTTERS
Eh, just about.
CARTMAN
[leaving his chair and heading for his door] Alright, well, you gotta take over the telemarketing for a bit.
BUTTERS
Oh. Well, uh okay. [approached Cartman's chair and hops on]
CARTMAN
[turns around] Just remember what I taught you and follow protocol. Next number to try is on the list.
BUTTERS
Right. [picks up the phone and checks out the next number. Cartman leaves. Butters starts dialing] Uh hello? Is this Mr. Thompson with Anatomy Research? ...Yes, uh, hello sir. Uh, aah, we have a surplus of unborn fetuses that we think you can use for a ...dissection study. Uh huh, ah, how much do you pay for that? ...You're breaking my balls. ...I said, you're breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson. ...My, my balls.
[Living room, moments later. Cartman reaches the foot of the stairs.]
CARTMAN
What is this, a PTA meeting? [before him stand his mother, Sheila, Kyle, and Stan. Stan's head hangs forward as he looks down]
KYLE
Cartman. [pause] Kenny's in the hospital.
CARTMAN
[shock and distress flashes across his face] In the ...hospital? Why?
KYLE
They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die. [Stan raises his head and looks at Kyle]
CARTMAN
[more worried] Die? Kenny?
STAN
[looks up at Kyle] Don't you say that! Kenny's not gonna die!
SHEILA
I'm going to go take the boys to go see him at the hospital, Eric. We thought you might wanna come.
CARTMAN
Yeah. Yeah, of course. Let me get my coat. [turns and goes up the stairs]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Kenny lies in a bed in a patient room with an IV unit attached]
DOCTOR
[fixing an IV for Kenny] There we go, little buddy.
KENNY
(Thank you, Doc.)
DOCTOR
You sure you don't wanna take your jacket off; it's pretty warm.
KENNY
(I'm all right)
NURSE
Hey, look who has some visitors. [walks in with Stan, Kyle, and Cartman]
DOCTOR
Hmm, what a lucky little man. We'll be right outside if you need us, Kenny. [the nurse and doctor leave the room.]
KYLE
[volunteers] Hey dude, how's it going?
KENNY
(I'm okay, I guess.)
CARTMAN
We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter.
KYLE
Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude.
CARTMAN
Heh, sorry. [Stan remains speechless. Kenny looks at his friends and coughs violently]
KYLE
Hey, uh- we were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan?
STAN
[finds his voice] I- [looks at Kenny, then at Kyle, then at Kenny, and rushes out the door]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day, outside. Stan rushes out the front door, Kyle pursuing]
KYLE
[looks around] Stan? [sees him and follows] Stan, where are you going?
STAN
I can't, I just can't.
KYLE
Dude, he needs us right now.
STAN
[turns around] I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing.
KYLE
I, I know it's tough but- [Stan turns away] Look at me! [turns him back around] I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now!
STAN
And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT!
KYLE
Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him!
STAN
[turns around and walks away] Just leave me alone!
KYLE
Stan, you can't leave!
STAN
[turns once more, with tears in his eyes] I'm not the one who's leaving, he is! [turns and leaves. Kyle turns to go back to the hospital, but sighs silently]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day, Kenny's room. Cartman was left alone with Kenny as Kyle went after Stan]
CARTMAN
[with emotion in his voice] ...You know, it's funny, Kenny. Stan and Kyle have always been sort of two best friends, you know, and... well I- I don't know if I ever told you this, Kenny, but um... I kind of always thought you were my best f-friend. I don't know.
KENNY
(Eric, well you're my best friend, too.)
NURSE
[opens the door and looks in] Okay, we're gonna need to get Kenny some time to sleep now.
CARTMAN
Don't you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find a cure for you. Everything's gonna be okay! [walks towards the door. The nurse leaves, then Cartman exits]
[Hospital corridor, Hell's Pass Hospital. Cartman appears outside the door with a long face, chokes up, and faces the wall to cry]
KYLE
[returning to Kenny's room] Cartman?
CARTMAN
[composes himself] Oh, Kyle. Hey, what's goin' down, Jew-boy? [sniffles]
KYLE
Cartman, were you... crying?
CARTMAN
' No! No, I mean, I, I got somethin' in my eyes. It's this uh, the air in here is just- uh. [breaks down again, but tries to hide it] Oh man.
KYLE
Hey Cartman. [Cartman looks up and turns around] I care a lot about him, too. [Cartman wells up again, and Kyle reaches out to hug him]
CARTMAN
I'm gonna find a cure, Kyle. I swear to God I'm gonna find a cure.
KYLE
[comforting him] Sure you will, Cartman. Sure you will.
[Alder Research Group, next day. Inside, employees are packing away their computers and other office equipment]
LARRY
[enters with Cartman] This is where the bulk of our research was being done. But due to the government ban, we're mostly just packing things up.
CARTMAN
Doctor, can you tell me exactly how stem cells work?
LARRY
Look, you have trillions of cells in your body: heart cells, skin cells, brain cells, and so on. But before a cell is designated as a toenail cell or a pancreas cell, it's what we call a stem cell. Sort of like a blank cell. Do you understand?
CARTMAN
Not at all, but go on. [they both turn and approach a table. On the table is a cage with a rat inside it.]
LARRY
Because these cells are blanks, they will often program themselves based on what cells you put around them. You see this rat? Earlier this year, we surgically removed the middle of her spine. then we injected her with some stem cells and... they became the missing part of the spine.
CARTMAN
My God...
LARRY
Nerve cells damaged by Parkinson's disease or heart tissue of cardiac patients might ultimately be replaced by tissue grown from stem cells.
CARTMAN
So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? In other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue.
LARRY
That's the theory.
CARTMAN
Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat!
LARRY
Well, no. To build another Shake's it would be better to use lumber.
CARTMAN
Hmmm.
LARRY
But, unfortunately, the government has banned stem cell research and so... we'll never know.
CARTMAN
Looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the government's mind. [turns around and heads for the exit]
LARRY
Where are you going?
CARTMAN
There's a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now, doctor. I'm gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves.
LARRY
Hey kid. [music stops, then a pause] Give 'em hell. Give 'em hell. [strikes his fists together, one over the other. Cartman returns the gesture with a thumbs-up, then walks off... then stops]
CARTMAN
Oh, doctor. [Larry turns around. Cartman has his thumb up] Thanks. Thanks. [Larry returns the gesture with his own thumb up, and Cartman leaves again.]
LARRY
Oh, hey kid. [Cartman returns] Good luck. Good luck. [Cartman gives a thumb up, walks away, then backs up]
CARTMAN
Oh, and doctor. ...Ah, never mind. [walks away]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day, Kenny's room. The McCormicks, Kyle, and Chef are present. Kyle has with him a bunch of get-well cards from the other students in his class. The bed is seen from an angle]
KYLE
...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, "We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny." And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane! [shows him the picture: Butters and Kenny are in a little yellow biplane]
CHEF
Oh, isn't that nice? You've got lots of friends, don't you Kenny?
KENNY
(Yes.) [coughs a bit] (But what about Stan?)
KYLE
Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny.
KENNY
(I hope so)
NURSE
[opens the door] Hey, look who's here.
KENNY
[perks up a bit] (Stan??)
WOMAN
[walks in with balloons and an assistant] Hello, Kenny, I'm Laura Jones, and this is Bob Ferrin.
BOB
We're with the Make-A-Wish Foundation. [a cameraman walks in and moves to the head of Kenny's bed]
MS. MCCORMICK
Oh, Kenny, isn't that nice?
KENNY
(The Make-A-Wish Foundation?)
LAURA
We travel the country given special little boys and girls like you their biggest wish.
KYLE
Neat, huh Kenny?
KENNY
(Yes.)
LAURA
So Kenny, if you could have ONE wish, what would it be? [there's no answer. A moment of silence]
BOB
What's your wish, pal?
KENNY
(I guess the only thing I wish is to not die.)
LAURA
What did he say?
KYLE
He said his wish is not to die. [a long stretch of silence in which the cameraman looks from person to person.]
LAURA
...O-kay, and, what if you're gonna have two wishes, what would the second one be?
BOB
I know! I bet you wanna meet Madonna, huh?
KENNY
(No. Fuckin' Madonna...) [his words trail off and are hard to understand]
BOB
Wu- what was that?
KYLE
He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself. [the Foundation reps are stunned. Madonna appears in the doorway]
MADONNA
Should I come in now?
BOB
Uh no not quite yet.
[The cow pasture, day. Stan has come here to reflect on Kenny's hospitalization. He sits on a log resting his head on his hands and watches as a cow drops a load of dung next to the log. He strikes a match and tosses it on the dung. The dung lights up and burns]
CHEF
[approaches] Hello there, children.
STAN
Hey Chef.
CHEF
How's it goin'?
STAN
Bad.
CHEF
Yeah. Things have been better.
STAN
Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend?
CHEF
[sighs] Stan, sometimes God takes those closest to us, because it makes him feel better about himself. He is a very vengeful God, Stan. He's all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago. He just can't get over it, so he doesn't care who he takes. Children, puppies, it don't matter to him, so long as it makes us sad. Do you understand.
STAN
But then, why does God give us anything to start with?
CHEF
Well, look at it this way: if you want to make a baby cry, first you give it a lollipop. Then you take it away. If you never give it a lollipop to begin with, then it would have nothin' to cry about. That's like God, who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry, so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears. You see, it's our tears, Stan, that give God his great power. [pause]
STAN
I think I understand.
[Capitol Hill, Washington DC]
CARTMAN
My name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado. My best friend in the whole world is Kenny McCormick and he, he's sick right now. He's real sick. He's only eight years old and his doctors don't think he has very long to live. Look, I realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a touchy subject, but... All I know is that if there's a chance, a... chance that stem-cell research could save my best friend's life, well... I guess I owe it to him to try and change your minds. [a shot of Congress] I love Kenny McCormick and... [sob] I want you to love him too. [cries as Congresspeople look to each other] And I uh, I'm not the best speaker in the world. Maybe I can put it best in the words of a timeless song [takes a deep breath]
It was the heat of the moment telling me what your heart meant

The heat of the moment shone in your eyes

I never meant to be so bad to you

One thing I said that I would never do
CONGRESSMAN 1
One look from you and I would fall from grace.
CONGRESSMAN 2
'And that would wipe the smile right from my face.
CONGRESSMAN 1, CARTMAN
Do you remember when we used to dance? [three Congressmen perform the following: two leg slaps and a clap]
A FEW CONGRESSMEN
And incidents arose from circumstance? [more Congressmen perform the moves]
EVERYONE
One thing led to another; we were young [everyone does the moves, and the result is thunderous]

And we would scream together songs unsung

It was the heat of the moment

Telling me what our hearts meant

The heat of the moment

shone in your eyes
[Planned Parenthood, day. Cartman, in shirt and tie, is outside with clipboard in hand, talking to a woman about to have an abortion.]
CARTMAN
And so you see, now that the ban on stem-cell research has been lifted, we can sell your fetus to companies like Alder Labs.
WOMAN
Oh, I don't know.
CARTMAN
Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now, Jill.
JILL
Seventy-five dollars? Well, alright.
CARTMAN
[hands the clipboard over for her to sign the release form] Great, just sign right here, please. [another woman arrives] Hi. Havin' an abortion today? [Jill hands him the clipboard back, then heads for the clinic] Great. [to the second woman] Listen, if you'd like to sell your abortion for research I'm offering uh, seventy-five dollars. Help you out a little bit with your medical bill in there. [she nods and reaches for the clipboard.] And you sign right here. [hands her the clipboard and she signs. A couple passes by] Uh excuse me, ma'am. Can I interest you in selling your aborted fetus? [the second woman enters the clinic]
WOMAN 2
We're not going to the abortion clinic. I'm going to have this baby.
CARTMAN
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because uh, there's a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could. The stem cells from your fetus could help save his life.
MAN
Oh. Well, I guess we can always... just make another one.
WOMAN 2
Oh Mark, I love you.
CARTMAN
Alright! Now Kenny has a fighting chance.
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Stan enters with a package, his faith renewed, his confidence strong, and makes his way down the hall, passing people as he goes]
HEAD NURSE
[at her station] Young man, do you know where you're going?
STAN
Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because he needs me right now.
HEAD NURSE
All right! [Stan passes a man in a wheelchair]
MAN ON WHEELCHAIR
Go kid! [Stan passes a man on crutches]
MAN ON CRUTCHES
Good for you! [Stan passes a doctor and nurse, and they smile]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, Kenny's room. Stan enters happily]
STAN
Hey, Kenny! [grins, then is stunned. The room is empty. Kenny is gone. Due to terminal illness.] Oh no. [Kyle walks up to the room, but stays outside] No.
KYLE
He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over.
STAN
But... [a shot of the bed reveals a teddy bear on the floor] I didn't get to see him. Hell I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye. [another shot of the bed reveals a teddy bear on the floor] Did he say anything before he went?
KYLE
He just said... "Where's Stan?"
[South Park Church, some days later, day.]
MR. GARRISON
And so, we will all miss Kenny, his playful laughter, his innocent smile. But we will never forget that it was because of brave Kenny that stem-cell research was allowed to continue.
STAN
I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend. [the doors fly open and Cartman walks in. He sees his friends and they look back.]
CARTMAN
You guys! Come quick! [Stan and Kyle look surprised]
KYLE
What, Cartman?
CARTMAN
It's... [Cartman turns around] Why, it's a miracle, you guys! [rushes out the door to a spot on the side of the road. Stan and Kyle follow.]
[Outside, day. Cartman stops, but still bounces from joy. Stan and Kyle join him]
STAN
What, Cartman? What's happened?
CARTMAN
Look. [across the street stands a Shakey's Pizza] I put the stem cells from all the fetuses I had next to a Shakey's, and they ARE replicating a new Shakey's! [oozing sounds are heard as a new Shakey's is indeed rising up next to the current one] It worked! [Kyle is shocked.]
STAN
This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses?
CARTMAN
Stupid fetuses? It's my own Shakey's!
KYLE
I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you.
CARTMAN
I think I only need a hundred or so more aborted babies, [Kyle turns and faces him angrily] and I can finish up the kitchen.
KYLE
AAARGH! [jumps up on Cartman and starts pummeling him. Cartman tosses him off]
CARTMAN
Aah! Kyle! [Kyle punches him across the face a few times] Kyle! [Kyle delivers a series of punches to the chest]
STAN
Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend! [Kyle gives Cartman a good roundhouse right and Cartman falls on the ground, face first.] Cartman was! [Kyle continues beating Cartman up]
End of Kenny Dies

synopsis:Alone and lost, Butters determinedly makes his way through porn theatres and gay bath houses in an effort to get his dad back home in time to eat at Bennigan's for his parents' anniversary.

script:Butters' Very Own Episode

[Butters' home, night. Butters enters the living room with a wrapped gift in hand. He walks up to his parents. His mom is polishing an end table while his father reads the newspaper on the sofa beside it.]
BUTTERS
Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya.
CHRIS
Oh, is it someone's anniversary soon? [chuckles]
LINDA
[puts her hands on her hips] Oh, you!
CHRIS
Just kidding. [lowers the newspaper and takes the gift from Butters and shakes it] Oh, I wonder what it is.
BUTTERS
It's a- [covers his mouth for a second, then looks down] Awww, shucks, [looks at his dad] I can't tell you. Uh, but it's really nifty.
CHRIS
Well, looks like we're gonna have to do somethin' extra-special for Mommy and Daddy's anniversary this year. How about on Saturday we all go have dinner at Bennigan's!
BUTTERS
Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it?? [starts running around the coffee table in excitement] Whoopee, at Bennigan's I'm gonna get the Rain Champ baby-back ribs! [stops and bounces with excitement]
LINDA
Calm down there, cowboy. You've still got four days.
BUTTERS
Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!
[A montage of Butter's previous appearances in South Park fills the screen. Then the picture of Butters with a Barbie doll grows to fill the screen. Then as this chorus is song, the following scenes appear: Butters at Picture Day - a lock of hair pops straight up as his picture is taken. He tries out for Fingerbang. He turns around and is about to show his "fruit bowl." He puts on a condom. He's with Tolkien and Timmy at the drugstore. He says a few lines in the "Helen Keller! The Musical" play. He gets his hair cut at the David Blaine complex. He's with his fellow Angels, then slides down a rope and bumps into Mr. Garrison, then hops off.]
CHOIR
Who's the boy that can laugh at a storm cloud?
Turn a frown into a smile for free?
Who's the kid with a heart full of magic?
Everyone knows it's Butters!
['It's "The Butters Show"' appears over a wallpaper design of Butters' head. This is the show's splash screen]
BUTTERS
[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] That's me.
[Next scenes: Butters in Mr. Mackey's basement. Butters tied to the feet of the Provider, a statue of John Elway.

CHOIR
Who's the boy with the eyes full of wonder?
Who thinks being yourself is the best thing to be?
Who's that rascal with the tweezers in his pocket?
Everyone knows it's Butters!
BUTTERS
[In the splash screen, claps his fists together in the hole] That's me.
[Next scenes: Butters jumps into a puddle. Butters runs down the hall to the theater proper. Butters petting a white goat. Butters holds a picture of himself and John Elway.

CHOIR
Jumpin' in puddles, skippin' down the hallway
Pettin' at the petting zoo. He loves John Alway.
[Butters, with pic of himself and John Elway, corrects the choir: "Elway!"]
Who's that tyke with the cutest little dimples,
Battin' his eyes at every puppy he sees?
If you look inside yourself, you might be surprised when you find
A little boy named Butters!
BUTTERS
[In the splash screen, the hole he was in is gone] That's me, [brings his fists together twice.] Yeah. [walks off to his left].
[Return to Butters' living room. His mom is dusting off a portrait on the wall as his dad returns to reading the newspaper]
BUTTERS
[making calculations on a sheet of paper at the coffee table] Three more days till we eat at Bennigan's. That's s-seventy-two hours. Aw gee whiz.
CHRIS
[rises and walks over to Mom] Well, if you two will excuse me, I need to go and buy a certain special lady her anniversary present. [hugs her gently]Linda: I hope he means me, haha. [Dad turns and walks to the door.]Butters: Don't be silly, Mom. Of course he means you.
CHRIS
[at the front door] I'll be back in a little bit. [Butters rises to see him off] Butters, you're in charge of the house.
BUTTERS
[salutes] Yes sir! [Dad exits and closes the door. Butters moves back to the table.]
LINDA
[walking towards the door] Oh, I wonder what he's gonna get me this year?
BUTTERS
We won't know until we're at Bennigan's.
LINDA
[walks around Butters to the other end of the coffee table] Every year it's the same. Your father gets me some great gift and my gift to him falls short. [walks away towards the camera and stops, wondering] I've just got to outdo him this year, I've just got to.
BUTTERS
Dad's a good shopper all right.
LINDA
[kneels beside Butters] Butters, maybe you could secretly follow your dad and see what he's getting me.
BUTTERS
You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'?
LINDA
[rises and goes to the computer] No, it's a little different. You remember when the nice policeman gave you a badge and made you an honorary inspector? [takes a badge from the desk and shows it to Butters.]
BUTTERS
Sure I do!
LINDA
Why, I think Inspector Butters could find out what Daddy'd getting Mommy without him ever knowing. [hands the badge to Butters, who puts it on] What do you say?
BUTTERS
[salutes her] Inspector Butters in on the case, ma'am! [walks away]
["The Butters Show" splash screen, but now only "Butters" is on the screen.]
CHOIR
Everyone know it's Butters!
BUTTERS
[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] Uh, that's me!
[South Park, night, the seedy side of town. Butter's father walks down the street and stops at a corner. He sees a pawn shop across the street and walks towards it. He turns and looks around the street, then puts on a hat and turns up the collar on his shirt. He walks back the way he came. Butters has arrived and sees him from behind a bush across the street. Butters has on his own disguise - a handlebar mustache - and carries a note pad, on which he takes notes of his father's every move. He pops out from behind the bush. His father looks around to make sure no one is following and arrives at Studcat Theater to see "Fisting Firemen 9." He looks around as he enters, and the doors close behind him]
BUTTERS
[takes down the info he sees] Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How nice.
[Butters' father soon leaves the theater and walks towards a men's bath house, the White Swallow Spa. He arrives and rings the doorbell. He looks around both ways and enters as soon as the buzzer sounds. Butters looks on from behind a trash can across the street]
BUTTERS
[writes down] "White Swallow Bath House"
["The Butters Show" splash screen]
CHOIR
Everyone know it's Butters!
BUTTERS
[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] Uh, that's me!
[Butters' house, night. He's returned from his tour of espionage and finds his mother in the kitchen cutting carrots into slices]
BUTTERS
I'm back, Ma!
LINDA
Oh, hi sweetie. Did you get to follow your dad around?
BUTTERS
I sure did. [walks over to the breakfast table and takes a seat] Dad sure had a nice night out.
LINDA
Well, did you see what he got me for our anniversary?
BUTTERS
Well first, he went to see a movie.
LINDA
A movie? Hmmm. I wonder why he'd wanna see a movie by himself.
BUTTERS
I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat. [Mom freezes] I didn't know it was open. [a look of dread is on her face]
LINDA
Wait a minute. What was the movie called?
BUTTERS
"Fisting Firemen 9" [her dread turns to shock] I've never seen 1 through 8.
LINDA
Oh my God...
BUTTERS
Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him.
LINDA
Butters, where did Daddy go after the movie?
BUTTERS
To the gym.
LINDA
To the gym?
BUTTERS
Yeah. The White Swallow Spa.
LINDA
[stung by that revelation] Gaah!
BUTTERS
Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight!
LINDA
[really shocked] ...Butters? Are you sure about this? You have to be absolutely sure!
BUTTERS
Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures. [holds them up for his mom to see. She walks over and takes them from him. She sees her husband gong into the theater, then into the spa, then being rammed by a man from behind...] The only thing I can't figure out is why dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for your present when he was goin' out to see the movies an' wrestlin'. [his mom faints right to the floor] Oh, did you have a nice "trip," Mom? See you next "fall." Hahaha, yo- Ma?
["The Butters Show" splash screen]
CHOIR
...Butters!
BUTTERS
[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] Uh, that's me!
[Butters' house, day. He's working with Lego blocks at the coffee table while his mom works on the wall behind him, painting over one shade of green with a lighter shade. Her hair is a mess.]
LINDA
[in a fractured, disturbed voice] Paaiint. Must paaiint. Everything clean. Paaiint.
CHRIS
Well, honey, you've painted the entire house. Three times.
LINDA
Must paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new!
CHRIS
[approaches Butters] Say Butters, m-I'm havin' real trouble finding an anniversary present for Mom. Any ideas?
BUTTERS
Hm. Uh-I can't think of one.
CHRIS
Well then, it looks like I'm gonna have to go out shopping again. [walks towards the front door.]
LINDA
[paints furiously now] Ungh. Paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new. Paaiint.
CHRIS
[opens the door] I'll be back in a little while. [exits]
BUTTERS
[walks over to the door] Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom?
LINDA
I don't think Daddy's shopping. I think Daddy's going out wrestling again. [rolls some paint on him downwards] Paaiint. [rolls some paint on him upwards] Paaiint. [turns around and walks away, leaving a confused Butters behind] Must be made clean. New.
BUTTERS
Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him. [opens the door and exits.]
LINDA
[alone with her thoughts in front of a family photo] Must clean Butters. [paints over her face] Clean. Never be clean. Must... [paints over Butters' face] kill? The only way? Must kill Butters. [paints some more over their faces] Paaiint.
["The Butters Show" splash screen]
CHOIR
...Butters!
BUTTERS
[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!
[The White Swallow Spa, night. Butters is at its front doors and rings the buzzer. The doors open and he enters He jumps up and gives the attendant some money - $10.]
BUTTERS
One please.
ATTENDANT
Locker two thirteen! [a towel pops out through a dispenser next to the window]
BUTTERS
Uh thanks! [takes the towel and heads for the spa's locker room.]
[The locker room. The camera pans across the locker room and shows nothing but men in towels. Some of them are exercising, others just chat.]
BUTTERS
[appears in the doorway] Dad? [walks in] Dad, you in here?
[A hallway. Butters happens upon a wooden door with a small window in the upper half. He looks up at the window, then enters the room.]
BUTTERS
Hello? Eh-anybody in here?
MAN
[voice only] There, do you think that works?
MR. GARRISON
[voice only] Well, that's four fingers; try five.
BUTTERS
Uh, Mr. Garrison?
MR. GARRISON
...Who is that?!
[The main hallway. Butters enters and checks the first door to his left. Two men walk towards the entrance and walk out]
BUTTERS
[reaches the second door to his left, which is ajar] Da-ad? Da-ad?? [pushes the door open] Are you wrestlin' in here? [gets a better look: two men are engaged in anal intercourse] Dad?
MR. SLAVE
This room's taken.
BUTTERS
Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs. [exits and closes that door, then moves to the opposite room and looks in] Dad? No. [leaves that room and moves to the third door to his right] Hm. [opens the door: his father is masturbating, but Butters doesn't know what that is.]
CHRIS
[sees his son at the door and quickly covers himself] OOH! BUTTERS!
BUTTERS
Hi Dad! [waves and smiles]
CHRIS
[now with towel in hand] Oh God! Aaah! Ohhh!
BUTTERS
I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your wiener out there, Dad?
CHRIS
[quite embarrassed, has the towel in position] Butters, you need... to leave here right now! You need to... get out of here, egeh... Go home and wait for me to talk to talk to you.
BUTTERS
Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya at home. [backs out and closes the door]
CHRIS
[now distraught] Oh, Jesus, no. OH, what have I done?
["The Butters Show" splash screen]
CHOIR
Everyone knows it's Butters!
BUTTERS
[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!
[Butters' house, night. Butters' dad is in his study.]
CHRIS
[closes a book, rises and calls out] Butters! Oh Butters! Could you come and see me in my study real quick?
BUTTERS
[appears in the doorway] Uh, hey Dad.
CHRIS
Come here, son. [taps his lap. Butters enters and approaches] I wanna have a talk with you.
BUTTERS
[hops onto his father's lap] Well, sure thing, Dad.
CHRIS
Son, I wanted to talk to you about lying.
BUTTERS
Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so.
CHRIS
Yes, it sure can be. [pause] But, there are also times when distorting the truth a little, uh, is appropriate. These are called "little white lies."
BUTTERS
Little white lies?
CHRIS
You see, sometimes telling a little white lie is okay. Like, for instance, when you catch your father jacking off in a gay men's bath house.
BUTTERS
...Uh, who's Jack?
CHRIS
Butters, the point is that, I think that if you told Mommy what Daddy was doing tonight, well, she might go completely insane.
BUTTERS
Oh no, that won't happen, Dad.
CHRIS
It won't? Oh, good.
BUTTERS
Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine.
CHRIS
You... what?
LINDA
[In the doorway] Butters, Mommy wants to take you for a little drive now.
BUTTERS
A drive? Oh, boy! [puts his fists together twice] I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too?
LINDA
No, sweetie, Daddy needs to sit and think.
BUTTERS
[hops off his dad's lap] Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad. [walks out after his mother] Oh boy, a drive!
[Boat dock, night, some minutes later. Mom drives onto a boat ramp and edges close to the water. A song plays on the radio: "Jingle Bell Rock." She slows the car to a stop.]
BUTTERS
Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along.
LINDA
[with a blank expression on her face] Butters, you know that Mommy loves you an awful lot, don't you?
BUTTERS
Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too.
LINDA
And sometimes mommies do things that seem hurtful to their babies, but it's really for the best.
BUTTERS
Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' "nutsack" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself.
LINDA
If a mommy has to end her life, she can't let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert.
BUTTERS
Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere? [begins searching] It's cold out here.
LINDA
I'm going to get out of the car now, Butters. [Butters looks up at her] I want you to stay put with your seat belt fastened.
BUTTERS
Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then. [she moves the gear shift to neutral, releases the emergency brake, opens the driver-side door, and exits. She walks away from the water, and the car starts to move forward] You know, I think the car might be movin', Mom. [cut to a view of the water from the dock] Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water.
LINDA
[close up. Her hands are together, fingertips touching] Shhh. Shhh. It's okay, baby. Mommy will be with you very soon.
BUTTERS
[a view of the dock from the water] Well, I think I- Yup, it looks like the car is fillin' up with water! [she turns away as the car leaves the dock] Yeah. I think right now might be a good time to try to get the car out, Mom! [she walks away]
["The Butters Show" splash screen]
CHOIR
Everyone knows it's Butters!
BUTTERS
[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!
[Butters' house, night, living room. His mom has returned home and is now writing a note. A noose hangs over the coffee table, ready for her to use when the time comes. His father, apparently, is not home]
LINDA
"Dear bastard husband," No. [scribbles over the words, then writes] "Dear lying sonofabitch," No. [scribbles over the words, then writes] "Dear assface," Yeah, that's it. "I will no longer-"
CHRIS
[enters the front door and quickly grasps the situation] Linda?? What are you doing?? [moves behind the sofa and to the lamp. Linda rises and quickly moves to the noose, then puts it on defiantly]
LINDA
Stay away from me, bastard!
CHRIS
Linda, I know this is very hard-
LINDA
[snaps back] You don't know anything!
CHRIS
I've been wanting to stop going to those places, Linda, but I couldn't. I still love you!
LINDA
[sobbing] Then why, Chris, why?!
CHRIS
It just... it started as some curiosity on the Internet. I would chat with other married guys in the chat rooms and... Well the things they would talk about, Linda, I, I don't know why I found it exciting. I just did, and it, and it grew from there and it spun out of control, and- eh, ugh, DAMN YOU, INTERNET!
LINDA
Well, [glares at him] you don't have to worry about your family being in your way anymore! [turns away and sobs]
CHRIS
No, Linda! I don't want that lifestyle! It's just kind of an addiction. I want help. And I'm going to get help. Please, just give me a chance to make this all up to you. [she removes the noose and falls to the floor] We can have a normal life!
LINDA
There is no going back, Chris!
CHRIS
Sure there is!
LINDA
No! [turns to face him] Our son is dead!
CHRIS
What?
LINDA
[sobbing] I killed him. [collects her thoughts] I was going to end it all, and everything spun out of control for me. I drowned Butters in the car, Chris!
CHRIS
Oh no. [Linda cries loudly] No! No, no, Jesus! Linda, what were you thinking?
LINDA
[snaps] I WASN'T THINKING! [catches her breath] I couldn't think! You destroyed my life, you! [points at him, then breaks down] Oh, God, what have I done?! Oh, Butter-her-hers-ss-ss- [dissolves into sobs]
CHRIS
[confused] This can't be happening! This is a bad dream.
LINDA
Just go away and let me die! [sobs]
CHRIS
[genuflects next to her] No! Linda, we-
LINDA
I'm a murderer, Chris! I don't have a life now! [lays down on the floor face first and pounds it with her right fist]
CHRIS
Linda, Butters is gone. [drops into thought] Oh Christ, if Butters is gone, then... there's nothing we can do about that. But I won't let you go to jail, I promise, Linda! Pleeease! [she start weeping, then he starts, and they both weep...]
[A river, day. The family car come into view, floating down the river, with Butters still strapped in.]
BUTTERS
Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now. [the car floats down some more and crashes into some boulders. The passenger-side door flies open] Ohhh, whoopee! Finally. Uh now that the car has come to a stop, it's safe for me to unfasten my seat belt. [unfastens it and lets it go. He scrambles out and over the boulders] Boy, Mom must be- worried sick about- me right now. Ah I gotta get back home. [before him are some low hills and the Rockies in the background. No buildings in sight] Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I?
["The Butters Show" splash screen]
CHOIR
Everyone knows it's Butters!
BUTTERS
[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!
[Butters' house, day. A News 4 crew is there, with reporter in place. So is a crowd of spectators and other news media]
NEWS 4 REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing in front of the home of Chris and Linda Stotch. They're living every parent's nightmare right now, as last night, while Ms. Stotch was driving with her son in the car, a man stopped her, put a gun to her head, and took her son away. When asked who the man was, Ms. Stotch replied, "some Puerto Rican guy." Naturally, the police are in an all-out manhunt for some Puerto Rican guy. [the front door behind him opens and the Stotches appear] Uh, it looks like the parents are about to make a statement, Tom. [cameras start snapping pictures. Officer Barbrady and fellow police officers form a barricade to keep the crowd away from the podium.]
REPORTER 1
Mrs. Stotch? Mrs. Stotch? Any word yet from the man who took your son?
LINDA
No, no, not yet. But if you're out there, we beg you: we just want our baby returned safely back to us.
NEWS 4 REPORTER
Mrs. Stotch, what did the kidnapper look like?
LINDA
Puerto Rican.
REPORTER 2
Was he tall? Short?
LINDA
He was... average Puerto Rican height. Please, just bring our baby back to me.
["The Butters Show" splash screen]
CHOIR
...Butters!
BUTTERS
[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!
[The highway, day. He's in a Busy Beavers moving truck going uphill]
BUTTERS
And so then my friend started hollerin' at me, sayin' "you took my rubber bands." Well, I didn't take 'em, Craig, did. I saw Craig take 'em. Anyway, boy, I sure am lucky you came along, Mister.
TRUCK DRIVER
Yeah. Too bad you're not a broad, 'cause I need some God-damned poontang.
BUTTERS
Yeah. I could use some God-damned poontang myself right now. Have you ever been to Bennigan's, Mister? Oh, it sure is great. I'm goin' to Bennigan's tomorrow night with my family. Oh, I can just see it now. [dream sequence: the doors open and the family walks in] We'll walk in the front doors, [a smiling waitress welcomes them and leads them to their booth] and the nice Bennigan's hostess lady will take us to our cozy booth [Butters focuses on the booth bench, runs to it, and climbs on] Then we'll order some mozzarella sticks, for appetizers. [a waiter brings the dish over] Dad will open his present, and Mom will open hers [he gets a tie, she gets the paint brush, and they smile at the gifts] Uh then the Bennigan's wait staff will sing
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
[the entire staff sings at the table as the family listens]
Happy Happy Anniversary-eh from everyone at Bennigan's
[the sequence is cut short as the driver gets annoyed]
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
[the truck stops and the driver exits to make his way to the passenger side]
Happy Ha-
Whoa, are we stoppin' for sodas? Hey, can I have chocolate milk? [the driver opens the door, plucks Butters out, set him by the side of the road, closes the door, and heads back for the driver's side. He gets in and drives off. Butters watches him go, then turns to face the receding truck...] He must like TGI Fridays
[Butters' house, day. The news crews and the crowd are gone. Inside, the parents sit on the sofa as the police and detectives handle the case. The phone rings. Chris rises, but the police chief stops him]
POLICE CHIEF
Let us handle it. [looks towards the phone] Barbrady?
BARBRADY
[answers the phone] Hello?
[Rob's Sassy Ladys titty bar. A few men sit around looking at an exotic dancer works her way around a pole. Butters is at a pay phone nearby]
BUTTERS
Oh. Hello? Uh, who is this?
BARBRADY
Who is this?
BUTTERS
Uh, is this the Stotch residence?
BARBRADY
Yes. Are you calling about the abduction?
BUTTERS
...No.
BARBRADY
Oh. Well, are you Puerto Rican?
BUTTERS
[looks down and checks himself out] ...No.
BARBRADY
We need to keep this line clear. Call back another day. [hangs up and faces the family and officers] It wasn't the abductors, sorry.
OFFICER 1
[enters the front door] Chief! Two more parents from the next town over have shown up saying their child might have been killed by the same guy that took the Stotch boy.
POLICE CHIEF
Really?
OFFICER 2
[enters with the couple] This is John and Patsy Ramsey, from Boulder.
JOHN RAMSEY
[they rush onto the sofa] We saw your story on the news, and we were so sorry to hear about your loss.
PATSY RAMSEY
Our daughter was killed a few years ago, in our house.
LINDA
Yes, I... remember hearing something about that.
JOHN RAMSEY
A and we realized... The man that murdered your son must be the same person that killed our daughter!
PATSY RAMSEY
Yes, because we certainly didn't do it! No. [they both laugh nervously]
JOHN RAMSEY
No, huh.
PATSY RAMSEY
No.
CHRIS
Well, our son was ab-ducted. We don't know that he's dead yet.
THE RAMSEYS
Riiight.
["The Butters Show" splash screen]
CHOIR
...Butters!
BUTTERS
[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!
[A road, day. Butters walks along and comes to a fork in the road. A gas station sits in the middle of the fork, and a mechanic works on a red car. Butters approaches him]
BUTTERS
Sir? Hello?
MECHANIC
[leaves the car to see Butters] Hallo, what can I do for ya?
BUTTERS
Wah I have to get to South Park. Eh, if you give me a ride, I could pay you the four dollars I made at the titty bar.
MECHANIC
Sarrih, wife took the car to Estes Park for the weekend. Won't be back until Sunday, hyeah. I can give you a ride Sunday, if ya like.
BUTTERS
I can't wait till Sunday. I'm eating with my family at Bennigan's tomorrow.
MECHANIC
Well, then, looks like you're walkin'.
BUTTERS
Uh will I eventually get to South Park if I follow this road? [points to the road on the left]
MECHANIC
'Aht road leads to Conifuh. You want to go to South Park, you gotta go down that rod. [the camera pans to the right and stops at a terrifying road. It is lined with spooky trees with faces on them, dark threatening clouds overhead, and eerie sounds.] 'Course, I ain't nevuh seen anyone go up that rod. Six years ago a group of campers went up there and got lost. Had to eat each other to say alive. Used to be the way to O'Riley house. He butchered over fifty children and kept their bodies in a cellah. But, you should find an old bridge about halfway up. That bridge is cursed, you know? They built it with the bones of two hundred Chinese laborers who were massacred in '34. Yeah. Lotta history down that rod.
BUTTERS
[unsure, blinks] ...Well, it's my parents' anniversary tomorrow, [starts walking] and they're gonna be awful sad if I'm not there with 'em.
MECHANIC
Well, uh good luck then.
BUTTERS
Oh jeez. [he enters the gloomy forest]
MECHANIC
[watches Butters leave] ...or is South Park down that rod?
[I Am Siam Thai Cuisine restaurant, day. Inside, the Ramseys and the Stotches are seated at a booth, men on the inside, women on the outside. Lunch is served]
JOHN RAMSEY
It's so very hard to lose a loved one, isn't it?
CHRIS
Yes, it, it sure is.
PATSY RAMSEY
Thank goodness we have each other to share our grief.
LINDA
Thank goodness.
JOHN RAMSEY
[points towards the entrance] Here he is. [a door is heard opening and in walks...]
A POLITICIAN
John! Patsy!
JOHN RAMSEY
Hello, Gary. Great to see you. Chris and Linda, this is our good friend, Congressman Gary Condit. [Condit approaches the table, waves hello, and takes a seat next to Linda] He also lost someone close to him and thinks it something to do with the same Puerto Rican guy that hurt our kids.
GARY CONDIT
We're goin' tuh get that sonofabitch! [grins. That grin is fixed in place]
CHRIS
Yes, I'd I sure hope we do.
GARY CONDIT
I spoke with the FBI and some Puerto Rican guy has just made their Number One Most Wanted, heh.
PATSY RAMSEY
Oh, good. Maybe now they'll catch him. [the door is heard opening again] Oh, here's another member of our support group. [waves hello] O.J.
O.J. SIMPSON
[waves] Hey guys.
GARY CONDIT
Chris, Linda, you know O.J. Simpson. [O.J. walks up and shakes Linda's hand]
LINDA
Oh. Sure.
PATSY RAMSEY
O.J.'s wife was killed by an uh, some Puerto Rican guy, too.
O.J. SIMPSON
Yup, it was some Puerto Rican guy all right.
JOHN RAMSEY
So you see, Chris and Linda, there are people like you all over the country who've been affected by some Puerto Rican guy.
GARY CONDIT
Hey! Let's make Chris and Linda an official part of the group.
JOHN RAMSEY
Yeah!
PATSY RAMSEY
Yeah!
O.J. SIMPSON
Alright!
PATSY RAMSEY
[waves her knife like a conductor's baton] One of us! One of us!
GARY CONDIT
Gooble gobble gooble gobble!
O.J. SIMPSON
[joins Condit] One of us!
[the two lines happen together]
THE RAMSEYS AND CONDIT
One of us! One of us!
O.J. SIMPSON
One of us! Gooble gobble!
THE RAMSEYS, O.J., CONDIT
Gooble gobble! Gooble gobble! One of us! One of us! [the Stotches look at the other four in fear]
[The scary road, night. The skies have cleared to reveal a bright full moon. The camera moves down to the road and Butters comes into view singing to himself]
BUTTERS
For family fun and great food, too, come on down to... Bennigan's
[a shadow flies over the trees in front of him, and an eerie cry is heard. He stops]
Buffalo wings and fried cheese sticks, the best are found at... Bennigan's
[a snarling sound is heard. He stops and turns right, looking into the trees]
Uhuh, hello?
[after a while of looking, he turns left and starts walking again]
So come and eat at...
A VOICE
[whispering] Why can't he see us?
BUTTERS
...Bennigan's.
You'll love all our... shenanigans.
[the eerie sound is heard again, and three red dots are aimed at his forehead - he has been targeted by someone, or something... He turns right again and looks into the trees. Someone looks back, and turns on thermal vision. A neon view of Butters is shown. Butters turns left and start walking again. The three dots remain trained on his forehead]
Oh, nutsack [moves his hands to his mouth and gasps a bit] Oops.
["The Butters Show" splash screen]
CHOIR
Everyone knows it's Butters!
BUTTERS
[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!
[Butters' house, day, the anniversary has arrived. Inside, Chris and Linda are fighting over the details of the unfolding story of Butters' disappearance. He sits on the sofa; she's pacing the floor, crying, and both are unkempt]
CHRIS
Naw, Linda! Because you can't now say that the abductor is Costa Rican! [rises] You have to learn to keep it straight!
LINDA
I can't keep it straight when you keep inventing new parts to the story!
CHRIS
Hey, don't forget that I'm covering for you! [the door opens and Butters walks in]
LINDA
Don't forget: your lies started all this. [Butters closes the door]
CHRIS
My lies may have been deceitful, but your lies cover up something much more horrible than anything I ever did! [Butters approaches and looks]
BUTTERS
Happy Anniversary!
CHRIS
Not now, Butters!
BUTTERS
Oh. [moves off to his left] Alright, then. I-
LINDA
Butters?? [spots him and scoops him up, then shares him with Chris]Oh, Butters!
CHRIS
Son! I don't believe it! [they both drop on one knee as they hold on to Butters]
BUTTERS
Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was-
LINDA
Oh, my baby's back!
BUTTERS
I ain't grounded, am I?
CHRIS
No-huih, no, Butters. Oh, son, why... [relief fades to spin] Oh... Uh, we're gonna need you to tell a little white lie about where you've been though, alright?
BUTTERS
Lie?
LINDA
Oh. Eh yes. Uh darling, you're going to have to say you don't know how you got home.
CHRIS
No! You have to say that a Puerto Rican man dropped you off! [both parents set Butters down and rise]
LINDA
Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped him off?!
BUTTERS
Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary.
CHRIS
[over Butters' voice] Now we don't really have a choice, do we?!
LINDA
You're the one that made up the stuff about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!
BUTTERS
Uh stop it, Mom and Dad.
CHRIS
Well you're the one who couldn't back it up wit a description, stupid!
BUTTERS
Now gosh darn it, you! [steps in between his parents] You listen here! Now I am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies. You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble! [Chris and Linda listen] Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here [puts his right hand to his chin, palm down] with you two! [a few seconds of silence follow]
CHRIS
...Butters... You're as right as rain.
LINDA
[genuflects and messes with Butters' hair] You sure are.
BUTTERS
Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I?
LINDA
No, Butters. You're the best son in the whole world. [Chris walks over to the phone as Linda and Butters look at each other] And I am so happy you're alive.
BUTTERS
...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?
CHRIS
You bet, son. But Mommy and Daddy have something they have to do first. [picks up the receiver and starts dialing...]
[Butters' house, day. The news media and the spectators are back at the Stotch house for another press conference.. The front door opens and the Stotches step forth to the podium, all cleaned up and well-dressed. Cameramen begin taking pictures]
CHRIS
We... have an announcement to make, um. Our son has been returned to us. [Butters comes out of the house to stand next to his parents, and cheers are heard in the crowd. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are present]
MAN IN CROWD
Wow, alright.
STAN
Butters was missing?
CHRIS
But, that isn't all we have to say. You see, we learned a very important lesson tonight and it took the smarts of our young son to show us.
BUTTERS
[points at the crowd] Yeah!
LINDA
We've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean.
BUTTERS
Yeah! [a shot of the Ramseys, O.J., and Condit]
CHRIS
You see, I've been deceiving my wife for several months. I was going to gay movies and bathhouses and having sex with random men who were complete strangers.
BUTTERS
[raises both arms in victory] Ye-! [turns to look at his father, and his arms go down] wait, what?
CARTMAN
Huho!
LINDA
[Butters is now afraid of what she might say] And when I found out I went crazy, I went crazy and I drove my son into the lake to kill 'im.
BUTTERS
Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ!
STAN
Damn, dude.
CHRIS
So you see, there was no "some Puerto Rican guy." He doesn't exist. And so the people we owe the biggest apology to are the Ramseys, Congressman Condit, and O.J. We gave you false hope for finding the person who hurt those close to you and, we're sorry. Now we're just happy we won't have to live a life of secrets. For I knew that even though some of you supported us, some others were looking at me and thinking, "You're a liar! You're a LIAR!" [points at the crowd, and Condit's fixed-grin face is shown] "You know somethin' that you're not telling us, you slimy, scumbag liar!" [back to Chris] Eh you know, that's what people would say to me. And then people would see my wife at the supermarket and they would say, "Hello," but they'd be thinking, "Ah, there goes that MURDERER!" [a shot of O.J.] "You got away with MURDER you murdering, lying, waste of life!" [back to Chris] And to me, people might say things like, [a shot of Condit] "LIAR! Tell us what you know you God-damned liar!" [back to Chris] And so, to both of us, people all over town would be saying things like, [a shot of the Ramseys] "You know God-damn well what happened to your kid, so stop acting like victims, and confess, you MURDERING MURDERERS!" [a shot of O.J.] "CONFESS!" [a shot of Condit] "LIAR! CONFESS!" [back to Chris] You know, and, that's what people would be saying to us, and so, we just had to come forward and tell the truth.
LINDA
We're sorry we lied to you all. It won't happen again.
CHRIS
And now, if you'll excuse us, this family has to get to Bennigan's.
MAN 2 IN CROWD
Yeah-ah-alright! [the parents go back in the house as a stunned Butters stands on the walkway. The crowd disperses and Stan, Kyle, and Cartman walk up to Butters]
STAN
Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you.
BUTTERS
Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now.
CARTMAN
We sure are.
BUTTERS
I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay.
STAN
Really?
BUTTERS
Naw, I'm lyin'
CHRIS
[appears in the doorway] Let's go, son.
BUTTERS
Wuh comin', Dad! [goes inside the house]
CHOIR
Everyone knows it's Butters!
BUTTERS
[returns to the doorway and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!
