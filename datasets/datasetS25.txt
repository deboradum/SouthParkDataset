synopsis:After failing to show respect for their teacher, PC Principal revokes Pajama Day privileges for the entire 4th grade class. Cartman is distraught. The kids aren’t going to stand for it but PC Principal refuses to back down.

script:Pajama Day

[South Park Elementary, 4th grade classroom. The bell rings and Mr. Garrison's class takes their seats.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, let's take our seats! Good morning, kids! So great to see you! [the class is silent] I know it's always a little hard coming back from a break. You know, you know, we've had a few distractions but let's just pick up where we left off. [he sits down on a stool] Kids, over this last break, I met somebody. And, uh, I'm pretty excited. And, uh, we've been really enjoying each other's company, and, you know, things got physical. His name is Rick, and, uh, well, anyway I really wanted you to meet him, just-- you know, he's a – he's a little nervous, so just be cool, okay? [he gets up and opens the classroom door] Come on, Rick. Oh, come on, you big silly, they're not gonna bite you. [he pulls Rick into the classroom] Class... this is Rick. [pause] Now, look, we're not gettin' married tomorrow or anything. We're just enjoying each other's company and seeing where this whole thing takes us.
RICK
This is really awkward. I-I told you I thought this was a bad idea.
MR. GARRISON
He's very shy, but I wanted you kids to know that he treats me really well. Way better than that narcissistic psychopath Marcus!
RICK
[awkward pause] I-I should be going.
MR. GARRISON
Okay, okay, well, you're gonna come pick me up after school?
RICK
Yeah, yeah, you're done at 4:00?
MR. GARRISON
I'll be ready like 3:30. [Rick leaves] They like you. They do! [pause] No, that's just them being them. [pause] Okay, text me at lunch! Bye Ri-i-i-i-ick! [he waves and sits down at his desk while the kids stare silently; his cellphone chimes] Oh, shit, it's Marcus! Should I answer it?! [they don't answer] I have to answer it. He's gonna suspect something. Just keep quiet about Rick! Don't say anything! [he answers the phone] H-hey Marcus. What's up? [pause] No. [scoffs] I'm in the classroom with the kids. Aren't– Aren't I, kids?! [he motions for them to answer; they remain silent] O-okay, you couldn't really hear them, but I'm with the kids. No. [pause] Who's Rick? We've never heard of Rick, have we, kids?! [silence] Will you fucking say something? Marcus, Marcus, I really don't– why?! Fine! Go ahead! [pause] That's fi-fine! Okay, geez! [he hangs up angrily] Well, nice going, kids. What is wrong with you?! You don't listen, and you blatantly go against my directions! [PC Principal walks by the classroom]
PC PRINCIPAL
What's going on here, students?
MR. GARRISON
I ask them for a response, and nothing! First they just sit there when I need their focus and their energy, and when I ask them–
PC PRINCIPAL
Hey! You kids know that these teachers are doing their very best for your benefit?!
MR. GARRISON
I don't know how much more I can take of this.
PC PRINCIPAL
I am sick and tired of students thinking they can walk all over their teachers who gave you everything they got!
MR. GARRISON
I've got enough problems as it is.
PC PRINCIPAL
I tell you what else. This Friday, for pajama day at school, this class does not get to wear their pajamas. [the class protests in anger] You heard me! No pajama day for this class. Now maybe you'll remember to have some respect for your teacher!
[South Park Elementary hallway. Eric Cartman is pacing back and forth in anger while the rest of the kids listen]
CARTMAN
This is bullshit! They can't take our pajamas from us! Who does the principal think he is?!
STAN
After everything we've been through the past couple years, they're gonna take pajama day from us, too.
KYLE
We didn't even do anything wrong!
CARTMAN
We didn't do fucking anything wrong! We keep not doing anything wrong, and we keep getting fucked!
BUTTERS
Guess that's just part of being a kid these days.
TOLKIEN
Yup.
CARTMAN
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. We are not just going to stand for this?!
STAN
What else can we do, brah?
CARTMAN
Brah, we can have some Goddamn balls! What does Matt Damon say on that Bitcoin commercial? Fortune favors the brave.
CLYDE
My dad says that he listened to Matt Damon and lost all his money.
CARTMAN
Yes, everyone did. But they were brave in doing so. We have to stand up for ourselves, you guys. I say we go right to the principal's office and tell him what's up, brah. [Stan and Kyle look at each other]
[PC Principal's office. He's curling weights when the phone beeps.]
PC PRINCIPAL
[he answers] Yeah.
WOMAN
Some kids want to speak with you about pajama day.
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright, send 'em in. [Wendy enters the room with Heather and Millie, the latter sobbing]
WENDY
Mr. Principal sir, can we please wear our pajamas on pajama day?
PC PRINCIPAL
I'm sorry, ladies. I've made a decision, and I'm sticking to it.
WENDY
Mr. Principal, we really didn't do anything wrong.
PC PRINCIPAL
I appreciate your sentiment, but as principal of the school, it's my job to make decisions and stand by them to maintain order.
HEATHER
[angrily] Do you know how long we've waited for pajama day?! You can't force us to wear normal clothes! What is this, Nazi Germany?!
PC PRINCIPAL
Hey! How many times have I told you kids not to bring up Nazi Germany when you don't get something you want?!
HEATHER
[leaving with the other two girls] You're a fascist!
PC PRINCIPAL
Get out!
HEATHER
You're a fascist, and this whole school stinks of Nazis!
PC PRINCIPAL
[to Mr. Mackey] I can't believe the things these students say sometimes.
MR. MACKEY
You better quit while you're ahead.
PC PRINCIPAL
What?
MR. MACKEY
You don't understand how important pajama day is to kids. It's like the Met Gala for children.
PC PRINCIPAL
If I change my mind now, I look weak.
MR. MACKEY
Mmkay... but I don't think this is gonna end up the way you want it to. [he walks away while the camera zooms in on PC Principal's face]
[South Park Elementary, pajama day. The school is decorated for the occasion. Children are getting their pictures taken of them in their pajamas.]
BOY
Hey look, it's Eric Cartman!
[Cartman walks sadly through the hallway in normal clothes as everyone laughs at him. He then wakes up screaming in his room, realizing it was a bad dream.]
LIANE
[she bursts into Cartman's room] Eric! Eric! [she runs over to him] it's okay! What's wrong?!
CARTMAN
panting] Oh, God! I-I was at the school and it– it was pajama day, and I– I didn't have pajamas on and then I died! And then I died!
LIANE
Shh! Eric! Eric, it's okay, sweetie. Shh.
[PC Principal's office again. He is on the phone.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Yes hello, Ms. Cartman. This is the school principal returning your call. What can I do for you?
LIANE
Uh, yes, I understand that you told my child that he isn't allowed to wear pajamas this Friday? What is this, Nazi Germany?
PC PRINCIPAL
Your son is part of a class that lost their pajama day privilege, correct.
LIANE
Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think it's safe for Eric to not wear his pajamas on pajama day. He could die.
PC PRINCIPAL
Well I've already made my decision, and it's final.
LIANE
Well, I'm not really sure where you get off telling me what my son can and can't wear. What do you think about that?
CARTMAN
Yeah, get 'em, mom! Tell him to fuck off!
LIANE
In fact, I think you can fuck off.
PC PRINCIPAL
Ms. Cartman, if you are worried about your son's safety, then perhaps you should just keep him home for pajama day.
LIANE
Uh, I can just keep him home on pajama day?
CARTMAN
No, I can't stay home because you have to go to work because fucking Matt Damon told you fortune favors the brave and now you lost all your fucking money!
LIANE
Matt Damon told me fortune favors the brave, and I lost all my fucking money!
PC PRINCIPAL
I'm sorry?
LIANE
I'm going to rally all the parents, and I'm going to the press! If my son can't wear his pajamas to school, then no kids are going to wear their pajamas to school! [she hangs up]
CARTMAN
Fuck yes, mom, that was fucking sweet! Wait, no, I want to wear my fucking pajamas to school! You fucked it up, Mom!
[A news report is being recorded outside of South Park Elementary.]
REPORTER
Tom, guten tag and heil Hitler. Apparently, we are living in Nazi Germany. The elementary school behind me is telling some students they can't wear their pajamas to pajama day. The principal of the school says the students are being reprimanded for bad behavior. But many parents are left wondering... nehmen sie meinen Schlafanzug? The school's mandate has caused a backlash with members of the community who are now wearing their pajamas to work in protest!
[The Broflovski residence. Gerald steps outside, dressed in his pajamas.]
LAURIE BERKNER
Pajama time! [the song "Pajama Time" starts playing as Gerald walks to work and enters his law firm, all of his coworkers are also wearing pajamas]
[A montage begins showing the townsfolk working while wearing pajamas]
RANDY
Making a difference can be fun!
[Some adults throw a rock through PC Principal's window and flips him off. The montage continues before cutting back to South Park Elementary. Wendy stands at her locker, looking forlorn.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Testaburger!
WENDY
[startled] Oh, fuck!
PC PRINCIPAL
I need to talk to you now! [he enters the gymnasium and she follows]
WENDY
Yes?
PC PRINCIPAL
Ms. Testaburger, I need you to get me out of this.
WENDY
Sir?
PC PRINCIPAL
I made a tactical decision. Now if I go back and say maybe I was wrong, I look weak.
WENDY
Well, Mr. principal, if you just–
PC PRINCIPAL
Zip it! I need you to get everyone in your class to work together and have Mr. Garrison come to me saying your pajama day should be reinstated. You get the girls and the boys to work together. This is your problem now, Testaburger. [she stands in silent shock as he exits]
[South Park realtors. All of the adults are wearing pajamas.]
FRANK
Hey, guys– I just wanna say I'm really proud to be a part of this office. Wearing our pajamas shows that we care about those school kids– that we care about other people. South Park Realtors!
ALL
South Park Realtors!
MIKE
Hey guys– sorry I'm a little late. Got a flat tire on the interstate. [he isn't wearing pajamas] What's the latest news?
FRANK
[he glares] What's going on, Mike?
MIKE
Well, what do you mean?
FRANK
You're not wearing... pajamas.
MIKE
Oh– yeah– I-I didn't really wanna wear pajamas.
FRANK
We're all wearing pajamas.
MIKE
Yeah, I just didn't want to with the rain and slush outside. It just... didn't make any sense to wear pajamas.
UNNAMED MAN #1
Uh, Mike, we're trying to do the right thing, and it only works if we all wear pajamas.
MIKE
Well you can't force me to wear pajamas! What is this, Nazi Germany?
FRANK
We aren't telling you to wear pajamas– he walks over and opens the door] But I'm pretty sure this sign right here on the door says you have to wear pajamas!
UNNAMED MAN #2
Hey, Mike, just put on some pajamas. It's not a big deal.
MIKE
Good, if it's not a big deal, then I'll choose not to wear pajamas.
UNNAMED WOMAN #1
You redneck, gun toting piece of shit.
[Cartman's basement. He's standing at a makeshift podium delivering a speech to his classmates.]
CARTMAN
Ladies and gentlemen. We have been at war for too long. Yesterday, Wendy Testaburger came to me and said we need to get the boys and girls together to find a solution for pajama day. I was delighted. [he flips a page] We must put our differences aside, because we all want one thing. The right to be in our jam jams this Friday all cozy wozy.
HEATHER
It's comfy womfy.
CARTMAN
Comfy womfy, cozy wozy, the point is, we are getting fucked.
WENDY
We all have to be on the same page here.
CARTMAN
That's right. We need all of us. Boys and girls working together. And so together, what are we going to do?
BUTTERS
[he raises his hand] We could shoot up the school!
CARTMAN
Shoot up the school, nice. It's just done a lot. Anything a little more original?
CRAIG
We burn down the cafeteria?
JIMMY
We smear human shit on all the windows?
WENDY
We apologize. [the boys all look at her, offended] You guys want a chance to save pajama day? Then join us in telling Mr. Garrison we're all sorry.
CRAIG
We didn't fucking do anything.
WENDY
At school tomorrow, we all tell Mr. Garrison he was right and that we've been terrible students. That we weren't listening and that he deserves to be angry with us. We tell him how much we care and that we want to see him more as a human being than just a teacher.
CARTMAN
That is just the kind of manipulative, psychotic thinking that we needed.
STAN
We can do this!
WENDY
We just have to be brave.
CARTMAN
But not too brave or else Matt Damon will come and take all our money.
CRAIG
Alright, dude, can we lay off the Matt Damon jokes, please? They're just getting old.
[Once again a news report is taking place outside of South Park elementary.]
REPORTER
Tom, warm up the wienerschnitzel and put on your lederhosen, because now people are being told to stop making Matt Damon jokes. Opponents are claiming that the jokes are already tired and Matt Damon had every right to make a Bitcoin commercial, so the jokes need to stop. All we can say is– Verzeihung für die Witze. 'Cause it's gettin' real Nazi Germany up in here. Back to you, Tom.
[IHOP, daytime. A woman is standing outside denying a man entry.]
SARAH
I'm sorry, sir, but we aren't seating anyone who isn't wearing their pajamas.
IHOP CUSTOMER
Please, ma'am, I just want to sit down and eat.
SARAH
I understand, but the management prefers that everyone inside be nice and comfy womfy.
IHOP CUSTOMER
So I have to be comfy womfy to get a Rooty Tooty Fresh N' Fruity?
SARAH
Sir, I'm just the hostess here. If you prefer, you only need to wear your pajamas to get in. You don't have to wear them at your table while you're actively eating.
IHOP CUSTOMER
So it's okay if we put on our pajamas, walk through the whole restaurant to the table, and then take our pajamas off. What is the fucking point?! [a police car pulls up behind them]
POLICE OFFICER #1
What seems to be the problem here? [the other cop puts the man in handcuffs]
IHOP CUSTOMER
Oh, I see! Bringst du mich ins Gefängnis? Bringst du mich der Führer? [escorted in the back of the car]
[South Park Elementary. All the kids are sitting at their desks, looking apologetic.]
WENDY
Remember... no matter how angry he is, tell him he's right. [the bell rings; Mr. Garrison enters the classroom excitedly]
MR. GARRISON
Good morning, class! [he starts singing and snapping] Good mornin'! Good morning'! Good mornin', good mornin'. To you and you and and you and you! [he pulls up a stool and sits down] So... how are you guys? [silence] You're probably wondering how things are with Rick. I just flat out told him that Marcus was still calling me and you know what Rick said? He said, "If you're not over Marcus, then take some time. I'll be here." Is that not the sweetest thing you've ever heard? I called him back like three minutes later and I said, "I don't need time. I need you." I said, "Can I just come over?" And the way he held me when I got to his house, it was like, "Ohhh, this is security." And then later on when we were in bed, I'd had my head on his chest, and I was just playing with his chest hairs a little bit, and I said– Excuse me, Butters, are you paying attention? [he pauses, looking at Butters who is asleep] Could somebody wake Butters up, please?
KYLE
Dude!
BUTTERS
Wuh huh huh?! Yes?
MR. GARRISON
I'm sorry Butters, am I boring you?
BUTTERS
Uh, no, sir!
MR. GARRISON
Okay, well, then maybe you can tell me what Rick said when I told him about Marcus?!
BUTTERS
Uh... Huh... He...
MR. GARRISON
Anybody? Does anyone know what I said when Rick held me tight?!
WENDY
"This is..."
CARTMAN
"This is really nice"?
MR. GARRISON
"This is security!" None of you are paying attention! None of you know the answers, do you?!
PC PRINCIPAL
What's going on, students?
CARTMAN
Aw, God damnit!
[Park County Police Station, night time.]
YATES
Jesus, I've never seen so many arrests in one day!
POLICE OFFICER #2
Sir, we got another one.
YATES
But she's wearing pajamas.
POLICE OFFICER #2
Yeah but she was caught shitting on the car of a guy who wasn't wearing pajamas.
UNNAMED WOMAN #3
That's right, and I'd do it again.
YATES
Alright, put her in with the others.
IHOP CUSTOMER
Hey, don't put that pajama wearing slut in here with us!
POLICE OFFICER #3
Chief, they're asking for your assistance down on Brighton street,
YATES
What now?
POLICE OFFICER #3
Looks like we got a domestic dispute.
YATES
Oh, finally something normal!
[Brighton Street, night time. An arrest is taking place.]
MR. BILLINGS
I told her I just wanna go to bed! If you're not gonna let me go to bed then I'm calling the police!
MRS. BILLINGS
He's just gonna go to bed wearing the clothes he wore all day! I don't wanna sleep in that filth!
MR. BILLINGS
Well, I don't have to wear pajamas!
YATES
Okay, Mr. Billings, but... you have to understand, it is bedtime.
MR. BILLINGS
So what?
YATES
Well, you should just understand where your wife is coming from. If any time makes sense to wear pajamas, it would be as you're going to sleep at night.
MR. BILLINGS
I don't care what time of day it is, I don't ever wear pajamas!
YATES
Alright, alright, listen. What if you were on a ski vacation. Hmm? A nice cozy condo after a long day hitting the slopes. The fire is crackling. You've got a cup of cocoa. You're telling me you wouldn't wear pajamas then?
MR. BILLINGS
No, I wouldn't wear pajamas!
MRS. BILLINGS
You would beg me for pajamas if we had a condo and cocoa!
MR. BILLINGS
No I wouldn't! No I wouldn't!
YATES
Alright, alright, is there any way the two of you could go to sleep tonight in this house together?
MRS. BILLINGS
He's not getting in bed in his clothes.
YATES
Okay, then you can just come sleep downtown at the station. Take her in, boys.
MRS. BILLINGS
What?! [two police officers arrest her] Oh, my God!
MR. BILLINGS
Ha ha, bye bye!
UNNAMED MAN #4
They're arresting people in pajamas? What is this, Nazi Germany?! [one of the pajama wearing citizens attacks the police officer]
YATES
Take him in, too! [they arrest the man] Arrest those people, and all of those people! This whole town is a powder keg about to go off. And tomorrow is pajama day.
[Music plays as kids enter South Park Elementary, all wearing pajamas. A news broadcast is recorded of the event, with the reporter now dressed in an SS uniform.]
REPORTER
Tom, es ist ein wunderschöner Morgen und der Pyjama Tag ist endlich da. Alle Kinder tragen Schlafanzug ausser es würde den Kindern verboten. Eine band spielt das traditional lied von Deutschland, und allen sind glücklich... [turns to a student who is running to school and lifts his revolver] Lich rennen! Sie müssen gehen! [turns back to the camera] Pyjama Tag ist hier. Back to you, Tom.
[PC Principal's office. He holds his head as the reporter continues to speak German.]
REPORTER
Hast du einen Matt Damon witz gemacht? Ich habe keinen Matt Damon witz gemacht.
[Gunshots are heard, followed by screaming.]
PC PRINCIPAL
What the fuck, bro?
WENDY
[she enters] You wanted to see me, sir?
PC PRINCIPAL
Bro... What am I supposed to do? [he starts crying and looks out the window] Do you know what a principle is? A principle is something that you see as a fundamental truth. You do something that you think is right out of principle! That's why I wanted to be principal. Tell your class they can run back home and put on their pajamas. I'll hand in my resignation this afternoon.
WENDY
Sir, maybe people won't lose respect for you if you change your mind. Saying you were wrong is sometimes the strongest thing you can do.
PC PRINCIPAL
You're totally wrong about that. When all these people see I caved in to their insults and their offensive World War II comparisons, I'll be done.
WENDY
Then we can't put on our pajamas. Out of principle. The kids will be okay. At least we still have opposite day to look forward to.
PC PRINCIPAL
No, you– Wait. What did you say?
WENDY
I said we'll be okay.
PC PRINCIPAL
No. What day is opposite day at school?
WENDY
It's always the second Friday in March.
PC PRINCIPAL
Testaburger! That's it!
[Cartman is walking through the halls dressed in his normal clothes while students laugh at him.]
PC PRINCIPAL
[over the loudspeaker] Attention all students, this is your principal. I need to inform you that a mistake has been made. Mr. Mackey, your counselor, totally screwed up the calendar. Today is not pajama day. It is in fact opposite day. [the students murmur confusedly] So we will be having breakfast for lunch in the cafeteria, and anything else you've been told to do, you can now do the opposite.
CARTMAN
Fuck yes! It's opposite day!
[The students all celebrate while music plays in the background. Mr. Garrison's class changes into their pajamas. Mr. Garrison pulls Rick into the classroom again, both wearing pajamas. The scene cuts to South Park Realtors.]
UNNAMED WOMAN #1
Hey, Frank! It looks like it's over! The school says the kids can wear what they want because it's opposite day.
FRANK
It's opposite day? Well, shit, we gotta go put some normal clothes on!
UNNAMED MAN #4
Aw, how come?
FRANK
Because we are people who believe very strongly in wearing pajamas to the workplace. If we're wearing pajamas on opposite day, that means we don't normally wear pajamas and we're douchebags like Mike!
[Park Country Police Station. Sergeant Yates is letting all the 'criminals' out of the cell.]
YATES
Alright, you can all go home. It's opposite day.
IHOP CUSTOMER
Oh, then should I be wearing pajamas?
UNNAMED MAN #5
I don't know what to wear now.
UNNAMED MAN #6
You can't make me wear pajamas!
YATES
That's fine, you can all wear whatever you want as long as it covers your dick and tits.
UNNAMED MAN #6
You can't make me cover my dick and tits!
End of Pajama Day


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Stan’s horrified to realize he’s misinterpreted some of the greatest writing of all time.

script:The Big Fix

[Colorado Convention Center, exterior, daytime. A banner that reads "Welcome Cannabis Growers! - Cannabis Cultivators Expo" is prominently shown as people enter the convention center. Inside, an exhibit hall featuring cannabis related items on display is shown. Then, Room B is shown, with a sign at the entrance that reads "THE CHANGING FACE OF HEMP FARMING". In the room, a spokesperson is giving a speech about marijuana.]
SPOKESPERSON
As farmers and cultivators of marijuana, we have a responsibility to society... [Randy is seen, high] I know we all respect the crop here, and we seek each day to better understand the nuances and legitimacy of its uses.
RANDY
Let's go weed! Wew!
SPOKESPERSON
But we growers must face a harsh reality– Since the legalization of marijuana, communities of color, black and brown Coloradans, those most affected by the racist war on drugs, have now been locked out of the wealth creation of the industry. [Randy yawns loudly and stretches] Luckily, the public is starting to understand this unfairness– and many people are now talking of boycotting cannabis growers who are only white owned.
RANDY
Boycotting what? Wait... what?
SPOKESPERSON
We are seeing a healthy and dramatic spike in consumers who demand that their marijuana be grown by those who understand the fight for social equity.
RANDY
Ugh ahhug–
SPOKESPERSON
The bottom line is this– a completely white owned weed business these days... just isn't going to survive. [dramatic music plays as the scene cuts away]
[Tegridy Farms, night time. Randy is sitting at the kitchen table with his family.]
RANDY
Guys... I wanna have kind of a tough talk with you. We don't really have any black friends, we don't reach out to the black community. Shelley, you never bring any black dudes over. I mean, Stan, your three best friends are all white.
STAN
There's only one black kid in my whole class.
RANDY
Yes, that kid Token. How come you never hang out with him?
STAN
I do hang out with him!
RANDY
In a group maybe, but I don't recall just you and Token ever doing anything. I've never seen Token here at the farm, just like the two of you guys. Why not?
STAN
I... I don't know.
SHARON
Randy, stop. We're not racists.
RANDY
We'd like to think that, wouldn't we? But... actions speak louder than words, gang. I guess... I guess I just want you to think about it. [he gets up and leaves, leaving the rest of the Marsh family looking confused]
[South Park Elementary, recess. Tolkien is throwing a football with Butters when Stan approaches him.]
STAN
Uh, hey, Token.
TOLKIEN
Oh, hey Stan.
STAN
Uh, listen, I uh... How you doin'?
TOLKIEN
[he looks at Stan] Fine.
STAN
Um... You think your family would wanna come over for dinner? Out at our farm?
TOLKIEN
It's kinda far, isn't it?
STAN
Yeah but... Look, Token, I think maybe you and I should hang out more.
TOLKIEN
What are you talking about?
STAN
I mean, we never just hang out, you and me.
BUTTERS
Hey, we never hang out just you and me either, Stan!
STAN
Shut up, Butters. Look, just will you please just see if your family will come over for dinner? It would mean a lot.
[Tegridy Farms, night time. Randy is setting the table for dinner. The Blacks are sitting with them.]
RANDY
Ok, there we go. This is a farm fresh hemp salad sourced locally here at Tegridy! Alright, come on everybody, dig in.
LINDA
Thank you so much for having us over. This is really nice.
STEVE
We've never been to a marijuana farm before.
RANDY
Well, you know, with our boys starting to become so close– we thought we better get the families together! If they're friends, then we need to be friends! Huh? [he pulls out his phone and starts recording] Do you mind if I post this? [to the camera] Check out our friends! [he snaps the photo]
STEVE
Randy... I hope you didn't invite us here because we're black.
RANDY
W-what are you talking about?
LINDA
It's just that the past year or so a lot of people have been inviting us over to dinner and then taking pictures of us to show everyone on Instagram.
RANDY
Oh, that's so lame. No, we really just wanted to get to know you guys better since Stan is friends with Token. You know... just out of curiosity– why did you guys name him that?
STEVE
What do you mean?
RANDY
Well– I mean, it's just kind of an odd name, isn't it? Like, some people might think you guys naming your son that isn't very cool.
STEVE
People have a problem with Tolkien's name?
RANDY
Well I mean other people just think it's a little... I mean, come on, I mean, I'm– I'm not calling you guys racist, but– why did you name your son that?
LINDA
My husband has always been a huge fan of Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.
STEVE
I wanted to name my son after my favorite author. But she didn't want to name our son J.R.R., so we just named him Tolkien.
RANDY
[shocked] His name is Tolkien?
STEVE
Yes, you know his name is Tolkien!
STAN
[to Tolkien] I thought your name was "Token".
TOLKIEN
My name is "Tolkien".
STEVE
Sorry, I don't think it's that weird. J.R.R. Tolkien is one of the most prolific, influential writers of our time.
RANDY
[to himself] Holy shit, that's what his name means?
STEVE
What did you think his name meant?
RANDY
[pause] Would you like to see how we grow and process our weed?
[Randy is giving Steve Black a tour through the refinery.]
RANDY
You see, it's all about refinement. Here at Tegridy, we believe the best weed is untouched from the earth– so we distill it down to its basic essence. Over there are our clean out vats and up here we have our first stage drying racks. Oh, real quick! [he poses with Steve for a picture] It all takes about six days from the field to a jar that we can sell. So... what do you think?
STEVE
It's... uh, very involved.
RANDY
Yeah, it takes a lot. You know– I just had a crazy idea... Our boys are best friends now... Why don't you come work for Tegridy?
STEVE
Randy, I have a job. I'm a very successful co-executive of a financial consulting firm.
RANDY
Oh my gosh– I was just saying we could really use a co-executive of financial consulting! Look, I... Would it be okay if... If I sent you some of our receipts and you could help us– financial consult?
STEVE
Well that's what we do... Sure.
RANDY
Oh my God, this is amazing. Here's to the start of something wonderful. Would you like some free weed?
STEVE
No.
[Kyle's house, night time. He's at his computer playing video games when his cellphone rings.]
KYLE
[he answers] Hey Stan.
STAN
Dude... my head is reeling, you're not gonna believe this.
KYLE
Not gonna believe what?
STAN
Token's name isn't Token. It's Tolkien.
KYLE
Yeah, I know it's Tolkien.
STAN
No, no, no, no. He's named after the guy who wrote The Hobbit and stuff!
KYLE
Yeah, I know. J.R.R. Tolkien. What did you think it was?
STAN
[horrified] You knew it was Tolkien like the writer.
KYLE
Everyone knew it was Tolkien.
STAN
No, no, no! No, no, no, no! I distinctly remember Cartman wearing a shirt where he spelled it T-O-K-E-N.
KYLE
Yeah, dude, ‘cuz Cartman's a fuckin' moron.
STAN
Wha– hold on a second! [he calls Cartman]
[Cartman residence, night time. Eric is lying on the living room couch, eating a bag of chips.]
CARTMAN
[watching TV while he answers] Whatsup, dog.
STAN
Dude, Cartman, did you know that Tolkien is named after J.R.R. Tolkien?
CARTMAN
Well yeah, I just figured.
STAN
Then why did you spell it "Token" without the "L" or the "I"?!
CARTMAN
J.R.R. Tolkien has an "L" in it? That's gay. Who did you think Tolkien was named after?
TOLKIEN
[from outside the room] Stan? You out here?
STAN
Uh, yeah, hang on a second Tolk-kien, just taking a shit.
TOLKIEN
Oh, okay, sorry.
STAN
Oh my God... I suck...
[The Black residence, early in the morning. Steve Black gets into his car and starts driving, listening to the radio.]
RADIO
This is your mornin' commute, South Park. Looks like we have a bit of slowing heading into town. There's like a truck and a couple cars... maybe take ya a couple minutes there. Also, if you're heading out of town on the main road there's a– there's like a car there, too.
STEVE
What the fuck? [he notices a Tegridy billboard with him and Randy plastered on it]
RADIO
Now let's look at the weather...Weather's looking like we're gonna have a little bit of snow. And the uh– [Steve speeds up]
[Tegridy Farms. Steve Black is knocking angrily on Randy's door. Randy answers.]
STEVE
What the hell are you doing?
RANDY
Taking shit tons of Tegridy orders. Sales are going nuts right now.
STEVE
No– why is my face on a billboard?!
RANDY
Because we work together?
STEVE
You said you just needed someone to help with accounting!
RANDY
Yes, but then– you got promoted! I was gonna surprise you. Don't you see how lucrative this can be? I mean, we make a pretty damn good team in the weed business. I mean, we are Ben and Jerry– We're Ben and Jerry. You're Jerry, and I'm Ben.
TOWELIE
I thought I was Jerry...
RANDY
No, you're a towel.
TOWELIE
Oh, that's even better.
STEVE
I told you before that I'm not interested in the marijuana business. I don't believe in drinking or doing drugs.
RANDY
Doing dru– Do you remember when Bilbo first set out with the dwarves to fight Smaug? What's the first thing they all did? They partied their asses off. [singing] Chip the glasses, click the plates. That's what Bilbo Baggins hates. [pause] And then they certainly had an adventure together, didn't they? Filled with... [he pulls out a wad of cash and puts it in Steve's pocket] Lucrative treasure.
STEVE
You really think we could make a lot of money together?
RANDY
Ben and Jerry, my man. Ben and fuckin' Jerry.
[Stan is sitting at the doctor's office. The doctor enters the room.]
DOCTOR
Hey-hey! Stan the man! How ya doin' buddy? [he reaches out for a fist bump]
STAN
[returning the fist bump] Okay, I guess...
DOCTOR
The nurse said you came here by yourself. No parents?
STAN
I kinda wanted to talk about something in private.
DOCTOR
Oh, okay, pal. What is it?
STAN
I think... I might be horribly racist.[pause]
DOCTOR
Well, kiddo... you don't normally go to a doctor's office for feeling racist, but tell me what happened.
STAN
So... there's this kid at my school, and... he's black. And his parents named him after the guy that wrote Lord of the Rings.
DOCTOR
Uh huh, Tolkien. Great name.
STAN
Yeah... well, I-I thought his name was Token. Like– like a black kid that's just there so that... like... there's a black kid.
DOCTOR
Uh huh... and how long have you thought that?
STAN
The whole time! I've thought that the whole time!
DOCTOR
Wow. Fuck you.
STAN
Huh?
DOCTOR
You really thought a couple of black people had a child and named him Token? Why would anyone name a black kid Token? You're a piece of shit.
STAN
No, I was just try–
DOCTOR
You were just going along with the dominant culture of the white paradigm, that's what you were just– Get out of my office, you make me sick!
STAN
I'm sorry!
DOCTOR
I don't know what's wrong with some people. I wonder if anyone else thought that this kid's name was Token? Hmm? Anybody? Anyone else just assume his name was Token? Because that's disgusting, and you are the problem.
STAN
Doctor?
DOCTOR
I thought I told you to get out of my office, because you seriously make me sick– I'm gonna shit my fucking pants right now.
STAN
Doctor, please, I don't want to be like this! I'll do anything, just tell me what to do!
DOCTOR
Oh, you wanna change? Then I suggest you start doing a lot of reading.
STAN
Okay, what should I read?
DOCTOR
[ignoring Stan] And I suggest that when you're reading– you do it from the perspective of a black person! [he leaves]
[Stan's room. He is sitting on his bed reading a book.]
NARRATOR
[speaking in African-American vernacular dialect] The knight Pigwiggen rides on a frisky earwig, and sends his love, Queen Mab, a bracelet of emmet's eyes, making an assignation... [scene cuts to Stan outside, still reading] Old Tom Bombadil was a merry fellow. Bright blue his jacket was, and his boots was yellow... [scene cuts to him reading in the library] It is told that in their beginning, the dwarves was made by Aule in the darkness of Middle-Earth.
[Music plays over stock footage of a black puppy playing with a white puppy, then a montage of Randy and Steve working at Tegridy Farms]
RANDY
Black puppy and white puppy
Play together in the backyard
Why can't we?
Getting rough with a brand new chew toy
Oh boy
Let's all get along
We all know
That puppies are the same wherever you go
There are good puppies (Mm-hmm)
And bad puppies
When one of them chews a shoe...
[Randy and Steve are now in court, being seen before a judge.]
JUDGE
As the owners of Tegridy Farms, you are accused of plagiarizing a song for your marijuana company. How do you plead?
RANDY
Not guilty, your honor.
JUDGE
The complaint says that you asked for the rights to the song "Ebony and Ivory," but when you were turned down by Paul McCartney, you copied the song into something similar.
RANDY
Not true, your honor. I've never even heard Paul McCartney's version. "Black Puppy White Puppy" is a song I wrote by myself on my piano keyboard.
[The singing resumes, with Randy and Steve now walking in the field at sunset. Randy then puts his arm around Steve's shoulders as they continue their stroll.]
RANDY
Black puppy, white puppy
Playing in the backyard, why can't we?
Black puppy, white puppy
Playing in the back...
[South Park Elementary, Mr. Garrison's classroom. Stan is at the front, wearing glasses and speaking.]
STAN
Guys... lately I've been doing a lot of soul searching. I've had to ask myself hard questions, because for a long time now, I've misinterpreted some amazing writing. I've done a lot of reading... And I've learned why Sauron built the black gate of Mordor across the path of Cirith Grogor, which led into the enclosed plain of Udun. I've learned that the Mouth of Sauron was once a man, who commanded the armies of Gorgoroth and dismissed Aragorn's claim as King.
CARTMAN
[leaning over to Kyle] I think Stan's lost his marbles.
STAN
I firmly believe that everyone would benefit from the school making required reading of these books. Because if we don't fully know about Tolkien, then we can make some terrible, offensive mistakes. In fact... did you guys know that our friend Tolkien, who goes to school here, is named after J.R.R. Tolkien?
BUTTERS
Yup!
CLYDE
Yeah, I knew that.
HEATHER
Why else would his name be Tolkien if it wasn't for the guy that wrote the books?
STAN
[glares] My point is, we need to petition the school to make Tolkien required reading. To better understand our classmate. I think maybe we all haven't done enough to make sure than Tolkien doesn't feel isolated and left out.
TOLKIEN
[opening the door] Guys? Can I come in now?
STAN
Not yet, Token. Just another couple minutes.
TOLKIEN
W-what are you guys talking about?
STAN
[pause] Just a couple minutes, bro. [Tolkien leaves, closing the door]
[Tegridy Farms. Hip hop music plays while Randy and Towelie dance and smoke a joint in the barn.]
MUSIC
Black puppy bitch,
Black, black puppy bitch
White puppy bitch,
Black, white puppy bitch
Black puppy bitch,
White, black puppy bitch
STEVE
[enters the barn] Hey, guys, I've got something really exciting to show you!
RANDY
[the music suddenly stops as he turns around] Ohhhh, buzzkill...
STEVE
I had this awesome idea last night... and I couldn't even sleep, I thought it was so cool–
RANDY
Okay, what is it?
STEVE
[he clicks the keys on his laptop] We do an entire line of cannabis based on all the different races of Middle Earth! [Randy looks unimpressed] We do seven different strains in all, representing the dwarves, the elves, even the uruk hai!
RANDY
Uhh, yeah... no.
TOWELIE
Everyone will think we're dorks! [they both chuckle]
STEVE
[annoyed] Randy, you seem not to care very much about any of my ideas.
RANDY
Well, you're just– you know, you're just not the idea guy.
STEVE
I don't seem to be the anything guy. I thought we were Ben and Jerry.
RANDY
Alright, look, I'm gonna tell you the truth about ice cream– Jerry actually doesn't do shit. Ben does it all, everyone knows that.
STEVE
Well, I don't want to just be here like some kind of... token black person.
RANDY
Oh, come on, I'm sorry.
STEVE
No. I totally get now why you want me around, and I'm not gonna do it. [he storms off]
RANDY
[smoking weed] He doesn't even really sound like a black guy, you know that?
[South Park Elementary gymnasium. PC Principal is holding an assembly for the students.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright everyone, listen up! We have a special announcement today. One of our fourth grade students says he's done a lot of work and has grown as a person. And he'd like to share his journey with you. Please welcome Stan Marsh.
STAN
Sup, guys. You know, I've done a lot of reading lately. And I'd like to announce that the school has allowed me to declare today J.R.R. Tolkien appreciation day! [the crowd is silent] These books go so much deeper than the Hollywood movies. And we see its influences everywhere in our modern culture. In fact, how many of you knew that our classmate Tolkien was named after J.R.R. Tolkien? [every audience member raises their hand] But you don't know that Lord of the Rings was an analogy for World War II, did you?! And I'll bet you didn't know that there was originally 19 Rings of Power that were forged by Celebrimbor! So there's much we need to understand. And so I would like to bring up the man himself. Come on up here, Tolkien! Come on!
TOLKIEN
[the crowd awkwardly claps as Tolkien walks up to Stan] I actually don't like Lord of the Rings. And I don't like The Hobbit. Just cause my dad's into that stuff doesn't mean that I am. I've always hated that my name is Tolkien, but I didn't really have a choice, did I? So please, whatever you do, just don't draw any more attention to my name. I can't stand any of it. It's just a bunch of nerdy, jive-ass dragon shit. [he drops the mic and angrily walks back to his seat]
[Stan's room. He is laying in bed, looking upset. Sharon enters the room.]
SHARON
Stanley? Are you feeling any better?
STAN
Nope. Not any better, Mom.
SHARON
Well, your friend Tolkien came over to see you. He's downstairs.
STAN
Tolkien is... here? [he walks downstairs into the living room] Hey, Tol-kien.
TOLKIEN
Oh, hey, Stan.
STAN
What are you doing here?
TOLKIEN
Stan... Are you ok? You've just been acting kind of strange the last few days.
STAN
Yeah, I'm good. I'm... No, I'm not... Tolkien, I have something I have to tell you.
TOLKIEN
Okay.
STAN
This whole time, I thought your name was "Token". Like... the token black person.
TOLKIEN
Wow.
STAN
Yeah.
TOLKIEN
Wow... Why would my parents name me something that means the only black person?
STAN
I don't know. So I understand if you don't wanna be around me anymore.
TOLKIEN
Well, it's not like I really have a choice. That's why I'm here. My parents just bought the farm across the street.
STAN
What?!
TOLKIEN
Yeah. Out of the blue my dad was just like, "We're going into the farming business!" And we all just picked up and moved.
STAN
Oh, my God, this is great! [he grabs Tolkien's hands and takes him into the kitchen] Mom, Dad, guess what?! Tolkien's family bought the farm across the street! We're neighbors!
SHARON
Oh, that's great!
RANDY
Yeah, that's really cool boys– Wait, wha-a-a-t?! [he runs outside to see the Blacks setting up "Credigree Weed"] What the hell's going on?!
STEVE
Oh, hey, Randy. What'dya think of the new place?
RANDY
Credigree Weed? How stupid is that?! Credigree isn't even a word!
UNNAMED MAN
[pulling up in his car] Uh, hello, we'd like to buy a little weed.
UNNAMED WOMAN
It's our anniversary!
RANDY
Well, there's really good weed across the street! Tegridy weed?
UNNAMED MAN
Yeah, we're just– we're looking for something with a little more... street cred.
UNNAMED WOMAN
Yeah, a little more cred!
STEVE
Well, y'all came to the right business, cuz this shit is hard!
RANDY
Oh, oh! He didn't even talk like that before! This guy is a total phony! Now just come across the street, and I'll show you some real nice weed made with Tegridy! These people don't even belong here!
UNNAMED MAN
Wow, bro, you're a racist piece of shit. [to Steve] Can we see what you've got, please?
STEVE
Hell yeah, we got all kinds of shit– Lemme give you a sample of my Rivendell Elvish Magic... [he walks away with the couple]
RANDY
[rushing back inside, furious] They stole it! They stole my idea!
SHARON
Who did?
RANDY
Those dickheads across the street! They took everything I learned about using black culture to make a bigger profit and they're doing it themselves! [he points to Tolkien] Get this little prick outta my house! [he forcefully grabs Tolkien]
STAN
Dad!
RANDY
Get him outta here, he's a spy! [he chases Tolkien out of the house before shouting at Steve] Hey, fuck face! I don't want your kid over at my house, you got that?!
STEVE
Hey man, what's your problem?!
RANDY
You want a war? Well, you got one! Game on, asshole!
STEVE
[pause] Game on, muthafucker.
RANDY
[angrily] Everyone back in the house. Come on, let's go.
STAN
But Dad–
RANDY
Shut up! [he slams the door]
DOCTOR
The story of young Stan Marsh might seem incredible, but the fact is many people suffer from unconscious biases. [he steps into frame] If you or someone you know might have also thought the name Tolkien didn't come from J.R.R. Tolkien, then please call... 1-800-I AM A GIANT PIECE OF SHIT. Because you are the fucking problem.
End of The Big Fix


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Cartman is not happy when his mom gets a new job.

script:City People

[South Park Realtors, daytime. The camera begins to slowly move to the right as we see the inside of the office, with phones ringing and the real estate agents talking all at once with different customers.]
AGENT 1
Yes sir. If you're looking to move out of the city, I think your family would love South Park. You can get four times the house here that you can get in the city. [there is a pause] A cortado? Is that like a coffee? [another pause] Yeah, we – we have a coffee shop here. Yes...
AGENT 2
We're up in the mountains about an hour from Denver. Do you think you could drive out from the city this weekend and I could show you some properties? [pause] Oh, you have a Tesla? Oh, how nice.
AGENT 3
South Park – yeah, it's a charming country village. If you're able to work from home, I think you'll really love it out here. [pause] LaCroix? The sparkling mineral water? Yes, I do believe we have that in our stores here...
[The camera now focuses on John Aspinal, sitting down on his office chair.]
JOHN
We're seeing a massive influx of city people moving out here to the country. And the truth is we don't have enough real estate agents to keep up with all the demand. [cuts to Liane]
LIANE
Well, I don't have much experience but I thought I'd give real estate a try.
JOHN
Mrs. Cartman, being a real estate agent takes a lot of intellect and a lot of raw talent. You have to get your picture taken. Get people to like the picture and go, "Oh, I'd like to hang out with that person." And then act like you like those people when you show them houses.
LIANE
Well, I do believe I'm good with people, and the truth is... I need to do this for my son. Our...rent is going up because of all the new people moving into town – and I don't think I can afford it anymore. [uplifting music begins to play]
JOHN
Well, then, I am going to give you a shot. Mrs. Cartman. For your little boy.
[Cartman's house, kitchen, later that same day. Cartman is seen scooping his hand from a jar of Nutella while looking at his tablet. His face is smeared with Nutella.]
CARTMAN
[struggling with his tablet] God dammit... Oh! You piece of shit! [Liane comes into frame a few seconds later]
LIANE
Hello, sweetie!
CARTMAN
Mom! Where the hell have you been?! I've been home from school for like 45 minutes!
LIANE
I'm sorry, honey, mommy had some errands.
CARTMAN
I didn't have anything to eat except Nutella. I was about to call Child Services!
LIANE
Honey... Mommy has some big news. [she sits down across Cartman at the dinner table]
CARTMAN
What?
LIANE
I... got a job, Eric. [menacing music plays]
CARTMAN
I'm your job.
LIANE
Oh, honey – It's going to be good! Mommy is just going to be working a few days a week and you can be a big boy and take care of yourself.
CARTMAN
[begins to get upset] No!
LIANE
Eric, this has to happen. We can't afford to live in this house unless I make more money, and this job pays really well.
CARTMAN
Wha– what job could you possibly have?! You don't know how to do anything!
LIANE
I'm a real estate agent.
CARTMAN
[softly] A what?
[Butters' house, living room, daytime. Butters is seen sitting down at the living room couch watching television and laughing. Seconds later, a knock is heard at the front door. Butters turns off the TV and gets up to answer the front door and Cartman is there. He seems to be carrying something in a duffle bag.]
CARTMAN
Hey Butters, I need your help.
BUTTERS
Well– Well, sure Eric! What's goin' on?
CARTMAN
Butters, I have some shocking news... My mom got a job.
BUTTERS
[he closes the door]Oh... Oh, and you're worried that maybe now your mom won't always be there to take care of you?
CARTMAN
What? No, my mom got a job. My mom is dumb as shit and somebody is paying her to do something. [he starts opening the duffle bag, revealing its contents. It is camera equipment.] Have you ever heard of a real estate agent, Butters?
BUTTERS
Well, not really.
CARTMAN
Yeah, well, neither had I. [he continues to set the equipment up as he talks] So I looked it up on a bunch of those shows and stuff. You don't do anything. You just look nice and hug people and then when someone buys a house, you make money.
BUTTERS
Wow! Well, that sounds like a good deal!
CARTMAN
It's more than a good deal, Butters. It's fucking legal theft. If my mom can be a real estate agent, then literally anyone in the world can. [he pulls out a green screen from his duffle bag and sets it up] We've got all these people moving from the cities into our town. I can probably be a millionaire in just a few days time.
BUTTERS
[excitedly] Wow wee!
CARTMAN
[he begins to change into a real estate agent] Now, whatever you do, don't tell anybody. If anyone else finds out about this, they'll all want to be real estate agents, too. You've always been great at taking pictures, Butters. [he poses for the camera and smiles] I won't forget this when I'm rich.
BUTTERS
Gosh, thanks, Eric! [he takes the picture]
[A random residence, daytime. Outside, there is a South Park Realtors "For Sale sign." Liane is seen with a clipboard on her hand, waiting. A Tesla vehicle starts to pull in as the camera focuses on the license plate. It reads "New York, JBG 1295 Empire State." Liane prepares herself to greet the city people.]
LIANE
Okay, Liane... you've got this. You can do this! [she takes a deep breath and walks over to the city people]
CITY MAN
[he hands out bottles of water] Bottled water. Bottled water. Bottled water.
LIANE
Hello there! I believe I spoke with you on the phone? I'm Liane Cartman with South Park Realtors!
CITY MAN
Uh-huh... uh-huh...
LIANE
Well, this is the house I was telling you about. It just came on the market. [she hands out some documents about the house to the city people] It's a 2,300 square foot mid colonial home. Detached garage–
CITY WOMAN
Pilates?
LIANE
Excuse me?
CITY WOMAN
Pilates?
CITY MAN
Is there a gym my wife can do Pilates?
LIANE
Oh, you're about five minutes from the local gym.
CITY MAN
Pilates. Bottled water?
LIANE
[nervously] Oh! Um, you have such a lovely family! It must have been a big drive from the city?
CITY MAN
Tesla. We have a Tesla.
CITY GIRL
Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi.
CITY WOMAN
Is there Wi-Fi?
CITY MAN
No Wi-Fi. Bottled water.
LIANE
Well, come on in, let me show you around!
[Cartman comes into frame moments later, dressed as a real estate agent as other city people follow behind him.]
CARTMAN
Okay, this is a three bedroom house with bathrooms. Front yard and backyard.
LIANE
Eric, what are you doing?
CARTMAN
Oh, I just got some clients here looking to relocate. These people are from the city.
CITY MAN 2
Uh, cortado.
CITY MAN 3
Bottled water.
CITY WOMAN 2
Wi-Fi. Pilates.
LIANE
Uh, excuse me one moment. [she walks over to Cartman and drags him out] Eric! What are you up to?
CARTMAN
I got a job as a real estate agent, mom.
LIANE
You are not a real estate agent–
CARTMAN
Neither are you–
LIANE
Now just march right back home and I will see you when I am done with work!
CARTMAN
Mom, real estate is an open market. You're not the only one who gets to take advantage of all the city people. [camera cuts back to the city people gathered around as they say things like cortado, bottled water, Wi-Fi, etc.]
LIANE
[assertively] Eric, this house is being represented by South Park Realtors. You don't get to just walk in and show it!
CARTMAN
[angrily] Oh, ok! That's fine! I have tons of friends in South Park! I'll get my own listings! [walks away]
[South Park Chamber of Commerce. Mayor McDaniels, Mr. Mackey, Mr. Adler, Mr. Kim, Jimbo, Skeeter and Harriet are all seen sitting down around a table. There is a meeting happening.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
People, this is the most exciting time in the history of South Park. As you know, there are people from all over the country leaving the cities and coming to small, rural towns like ours.
MR. ADLER
It's truly incredible for all of us. With this new surge of people from urban areas, we're seeing more town money from sales taxes, more profit in our local businesses–
HARRIET
My bakery has seen a 20% increase in sales. Oh, I just love all these city people moving in!
TUONG LU KIM
That's right. It's great to have shitty people. These shitty people come with their fancy shitty crothes and their big shitty cars. You know, and these shitty people have a shitty way of doing things that will expose us all to their shitty ideas.
JIMBO
Yeah, and they've got city money and city lifestyles!
TUONG LU KIM
Shitty money, shitty lifestyles. And they'll move here and bring their shitty famiries. And their cultured, shitty kids will hang out with our kids and expose them to their shitty ways.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
I've always dreamed of South Park becoming more than a little hick town. [the music intensifies] And these city people bring with them... a new hope.
HARRIET
Here's to the future, everyone!
ALL
The future!
[The Tweak Residence, Living room. Cartman opens the front door as he lets in all the city people inside the house. All the city people follow him.]
CARTMAN
Okay, so this is a three bedroom two and a half bath– come on in, everybody! [he motions the city people to come inside]
CITY MAN
Wi-Fi?
CITY MAN 2
Wha– Wha– Wha– Wha?
CITY MAN 3
LaCroix.
CARTMAN
You got about 2,300 square feet and there is a finished basement.
CITY WOMAN
Oat milk. Oat milk.
CARTMAN
Detached garage– stairs head up to the master, which is an en suite, if I remember correctly. Let's get on back to the kitchen... [starts walking, with the city people following him]
CITY MAN 4
Cortado?
[Few seconds later, the kitchen. Tweek, Richard and Mrs. Tweak are eating together at the dinner table. Cartman walks in uninvited with all the other city people looking around.]
CARTMAN
You've got a nice, big kitchen, pretty new appliances. Door in the back gets you out to the garage.
RICHARD
Excuse me, what are you doing?
CARTMAN
Just showing them your house. Come on, let's check out the second floor–
RICHARD
Our house isn't for sale! Hey! [gets up from his chair]
[Upstairs bathroom. Tweek's grandma is seen using the toilet. Cartman walks in, scaring the grandmother.]
CARTMAN
Nice, big bathroom for the two rooms up here. Tweek's grandma is staying in one of the rooms, which serves as an office space when she's not here.
[Back in the living room.]
CARTMAN
And then, we are back down to the spacious living room!
RICHARD
Will you please get out of our house?
CARTMAN
Yeah, we're just about done– well, what do you guys think?
CITY BOY
Macbook, Tesla?
CARTMAN
I'm sorry, I didn't get that...
CITY MAN
My son left his MacBook in the Tesla.
CARTMAN
Oh, sure, well, let's head on out now. We can take a lot at Jimmy's house. [he starts to leave] It doesn't have such sucky furniture. [the city people head outside] Let me talk to these guys and see if we can come up with a number. [he hands Richard a business card.] I think I can get you 4 million for this place.
RICHARD
Four million dollars, really?
CARTMAN
I'll be in touch. [he leaves]
MRS. TWEAK
Told you our furniture sucked! [she walks away]
[Outside of South Park Realtors, daytime. All the city people are seen gathering around the building talking all at once. On the windows, there are some house listings. The camera cuts to inside the office.]
REALTOR
Hey– Hey, John, I got some bad news. We just lost another client to the South Park Realty Group.
JOHN
What?!
REALTOR
We're losing people like crazy! These guys are ruthless.
JOHN
Who is this South Park Realty Group?! Has anyone heard of them?!
REALTOR
[points at the documents in the folder] It appears to be mostly one agent. A-A pretty young guy– Can't have been in the business that long– [Cartman's picture appears, with the flier caption saying "Looking to Buy or Sell YOUR HOME? Call SOUTH PARK REALTY GROUP to satisfy any real estate needs."]
JOHN
Oh my god... That's a pretty damn good picture. How'd he get that kind of depth of field?
REALTOR
I don't know he's gotta be using some kind of soft filter– nothing I've ever seen!
JOHN
Alright, everyone! Looks like we've got some competition! If anyone thinks they can take our clients, they've got another thing coming. Everyone, get up. We're gonna retake our pictures.
REALTORS
Awwwww!
JOHN
No, no, no, we're getting our butts kicked, and we need to show this kid what we can do!
[Some time later. All of the realtors are retaking their pictures. One realtor goes up and attempts to remain his posture, but it becomes difficult to keep it.]
JOHN
Come on, Chris! You gotta look really welcoming!
CHRIS
[struggling] Ugh. I'm trying–
JOHN
Come on, arch your back more!
CHRIS
I'm, ugh, arched as far as I can...!
JOHN
Come on, Chris, you wanna lose another sale?! Arch your back more!!!
CHRIS
I-I got it–! [he ends up arching his back so far that his bones are heard cracking and screams in pain] [John takes the picture]
JOHN
That's good, we got it– Get in here, Carol! [the next realtor does the same and ends up snapping her back, screaming in pain. John snaps a picture] Got it! Ok, next!
[A montage begins to play. The camera pans into the neighborhood as upbeat music plays. The Donovan residence is shown along with the address "2210 Mala Vista Dr." The camera cuts to Cartman.]
CARTMAN
Hey, guys, it's Eric from South Park Realty Group. Are you dreaming of moving out of the city and into the countryside? I want you to check out Clyde's house. This is a 2,300 square foot mid colonial home – detached garage – now listing for just $3.5 million. Let's check it out.
[The montage continues, as it transitions from the neighborhood to an open grass field with various cows. The camera cuts back to Clyde's house and Cartman walks inside]
CARTMAN
This house is so spacious. I think my cameraman Butters can attest to this. Isn't this nice, Butters?
BUTTERS
Yeah, it's real roomy!
CARTMAN
Just look at these amenities.
[As the montage plays out again, the camera shows the living room couch, the kitchen sink, a random chair and a toilet. It cuts again to Cartman opening up the backyard glass door and walking out to the backyard.]
CARTMAN
These giant, glass double doors lead to the unfinished backyard. Plenty of room here for a pool or a horse stable.[camera zooms out] This is just one of the amazing properties we have at South Park Realty Group. We've got other great listings, like– [the camera begins to cut to the different houses mentioned, first starting with the Tucker Residence] Craig's house, [next, the Testaburger Residence] Wendy's house, [lastly, the Broflovski Residence] and my personal favorite, Kyle's House. [the camera cuts to Cartman sitting down on a beach chair with a drink] Get out of that sewage drain you call a city and start living the country life you've always wanted.
[A logo for South Park Realty Group shows on screen.]
CARTMAN
South Park Realty Group. Get out of the city and into beautiful South Park.
[The montage comes to a close. Various cars begin to come in from the highway and air horns start to blare. The city people speak all at once and various billboards are shown from South Park Realtors, with all the realtors posing with arched backs and smiles.]
[South Park Realtors office.]
JOHN
Uh, Liane, you got a call, line 2. Sounds like a broker interested in 4600 Highgate.
LIANE
Ooh! Okay.
[Liane takes telephone call.]
LIANE
Hi, this is Liane with South Park Realtors.
[Cartman in front of the house.]
CARTMAN
How's it going? This is Eric Cartman with South Park Realty Group.
LIANE
Eric, stop it.
CARTMAN
Well, I'm standing here with some clients who want to make a deal on this Highgate place. They wanna offer $175,000.
LIANE
You are going to get me fired, Eric. And then we are going to lose our home!
CARTMAN
$175,000 is a great number—$25,000 below asking, but you know you're never gonna get $200,000. [to the city people] Don't worry, these deals are always like this.
LIANE
I am doing this job for us! So we can have a roof over our heads!
CARTMAN
The HVAC all needs to be redone and you know it.
LIANE
I am not talking about this anymore!
CARTMAN
Okay, that's fine mom, why don't you go to fucking hell?! [he hands up, and talks to the city people] It always gets like this with agents. Don't worry, she'll call back, watch.
CARTMAN
[Liane calls back] South Park Realty Group, this is Eric.
LIANE
You are in so much trouble, young man!
CARTMAN
Okay, okay... $180,000, but that's as high as I can go. [he hangs up and looks at the city people] We got it.
[South Park Realtors office, John is seen deeply troubled.]
JOHN
It just isn't fair... We retook all our pictures, and what does South Park Realty Group go and do? They go and make a video. And just like that, they take all our customers.
REALTOR
I think maybe real estate just isn't the same anymore. Maybe we gotta start making fancy videos to keep up.
HOT DOG OWNER
Excuse me, there's all these city people moving into town and I think I'd like to sell my property.
REALTORS
[all the realtors stand up and begin posing] R-really?
REALTORS
That's great!
REALTORS
Hey, hey, sir!
REALTORS
We can sell your house!
JOHN
[pushes the others away] Move! Move! Get! Get! [to the client] That's a very smart idea! It's definitely a sellers market right now! It's good you came to South Park Realtors. What kind of house is it?
[Que promotional video from South Park Realtors.]
JOHN
Once in a lifetime, a property comes up for sale that it's so unique, it defies words. We know that good houses are getting hard to come by in South Park...and that's why we are so excited to bring you this exceptional new property.
[Different still images of the Coney Island Hotdog property, showing its look from the outside.]
JOHN
This is the historic Aspen Park Hot Dog. 200 square feet of pure luxury. Let's check it out.
[A montage of different images of the property's disgusting and ruin looking interior.]
JOHN
You want to move out of the city and enjoy the laid back country life? It's all here. [South Park Realtors logo shows up] Find out more about this dream home today at South Park Realtors.
[City Wok restaurant, Tuong Lu Kim is preparing the foods.]
CITY PEOPLE
LaCroix? LaCroix? Wifi? MacBook?
TUONG LU KIM
Huh...sound like-a shitty people.
[Outside the restaurant, a bunch of city people are gathered, spouting nonsense.]
TUONG LU KIM
Oh, no! There's way too many shitty people! Go on, go, go! Shoo! Too many of you shitty people! Go on! Go on, shoo, shitty people!
[The Mayor looks down at the city from her office, it's plagued with city people. Then, inside her office.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
People... we have a giant problem. There are now so many city people looking for houses in South Park...that it could destroy our rebounding economy.
MR. ADLER
Uh...how so? I thought city people were good for our economy.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
They are, but Mr. Kim has a theory, and I think you all better listen to him. Mr. Kim.
TUONG LU KIM
What's the one thing shitty people hate most? Other shitty people. Shitty people wanna get out of the shitty. If too many come here... South Park becomes shitty, and then all the shitty people gonna reave.
HARRIET
We can't let that happen. Not when things are finally starting to turn around!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
So then we have to find a way to stop this.
JIMBO
It's the damn real estate agents! They're the ones who are going overboard. They only care about their commissions!
HARRIET
Yes! We are to tell the realtors to cool their jets!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Realtors don't care about anything but money. We have to show them who's really in charge of this town...Jimbo—go to your gun store and get the necessary supplies. I'm declaring open season...on real estate agents.
[A table with different things like LaCroix, Edamame, Cortados, and others. In front, a sign reading "OPEN HOUSE TODAY". City people begin approaching and naming things like, "cortado", "edamame", "LaCroix", "oat milk".]
CARTMAN
Welcome, home buyers! I'm Eric with South Park Realty Group. We hope you're enjoying the provided food and beverages. [the city people keep their distinct chattering] Yes, that's right. You know, here at South Park Realty Group, we've had some amazing listings—Craig's house, Jimmy's house—but I think you'll all agree that what we have for you today is a whole nother level. I present to you... Tolkien's house!
CITY PEOPLE
[music starts playing] Wha-- wha-- wha-- wha--
CARTMAN
These owners have just moved out to a farm, and we're listing this house at just under $50 million dollars.
[The city people start running inside the house.]
CARTMAN
Yes! Go on in! Check it out! Make me an offer!
LIANE
[tires screech, Liane gets out of her car] You are in big trouble, young man!
CARTMAN
This is my listing, mom!
LIANE
I have had it with you! Come here right now!
CARTMAN
[Cartman looks worried, he walks inside the house] This is my listing, mom!
LIANE
Eric!
[Outside the South Park Realtors building. Jimbo, Mr. Kim, Mr. Adler and Ms. Biggle show up with guns. Ms. Biggle kicks the door down. Inside, they find all the realtors bleeding and hurt on the floor.]
JIMBO
What the hell.
JOHN
[wounded] Over here...
JIMBO
What happened here?
JOHN
They're too smart for us. South Park Realty Group. We tried to keep up... took our pictures again—aagh! My spine is broken.
MR. ADLER
Well, it serves you right for what you're doing to our town!
HARRIET
You're driving all the city people away!
JOHN
Not us...South Park Realty Group...they upset the natural balance. Real estate agents don't really do anything. If they start doing stuff, then the whole housing market goes crazy!
HARRIET
Where is South Park Realty Group located?!
REALTOR
They're showing a house... The Tolkien house... you have to stop them.
[Inside Tolkien's house, the city people are everywhere. Cartman enters the scene running from Liane.]
CARTMAN
Agh! Help! Somebody call Child Protective Services!
LIANE
Eric, you're only making it worse!
[Liane chases Cartman to the second floor, until she corners him.]
CARTMAN
I am not doing a co-brokering deal, mom, it's not gonna happen!
LIANE
This isn't about that, Eric, and you know it! You're upset! You're upset because you don't want your mom to have a job!
CARTMAN
That isn't true.
LIANE
It is true! You're scared and you're jealous that a job will take my attention away from you!
CARTMAN
You just want to offer the sellers a lower commission to list this house and it's not going to work, mom!
LIANE
It's ok to be scared, Eric. I know that I'm the only family you have, but you're making everything worse for us!
[Gunshots shatter the windows, Liane and Eric scream, taking cover. Outside, Jimbo, Mr. Kim, Mr. Adler and Ms. Biggle are shooting the house.]
JIMBO
I see one! There's a real estate agent right there!
HARRIET
There's a big one and a little, fat one!
[Inside the house, the city people start panicking due to the gunshots. Cartman and Liane go to the kitchen and take cover.]
LIANE
Eric, you need to stop this right now.
CARTMAN
When I close this deal, mom, I'm gonna be the richest kid in town!
LIANE
It doesn't work that way, Eric! You aren't going to make any money—you're just driving up the market and none of your deals will make it through escrow!
CARTMAN
Well, we'll just see in 30 days, won't we? Except for some of my deals, which have a 45 day contingency period!
LIANE
Fine, Eric! Will you stop all this if I quit my job?!
CARTMAN
[Cartman looks at Liane with puppy eyes from the corner] And you won't get any other job?
LIANE
No!
CARTMAN
And your only job will be me? And, you'll be home when I get back from school and have my mid-afternoon meal already on the table?
LIANE
Yes, Eric!..Yes...
[The city people begin to escape from the house, while the others keep shooting the place. Liane shows a white cloth, in sign of surrender.]
JIMBO
Hold yer' fire! Come on out, ya' damn real estate agents!
LIANE
[with her hands up] Don't shoot! I am not a real estate agent! I am quitting as of right now. And South Park Realty Group is no more.
HARRIET
We did it! We fucking did it!
[Liane leaves with Cartman, defeated. The next scene shows the city people in their Teslas, leaving the town. A montage from South Park Realtors begins.]
JOHN
Real Estate is a delicate balance. It has to be left to the professionals. There's a great migration happening all over America. And if we do it right... Everyone ends up in a home...that they can afford.
[Cut to Coney Island Hot Dog, with a sign of "SOLD" taped on the name. A moving truck leaves, and inside, sit Cartman and Liane, with all their stuff cramped in the spot.]
CARTMAN
I think it's cool we live in a hot dog. [Liane looks at Cartman, then he walks to the sink] We have everything we need here. We've got running water, a couch to sleep on. And most important, we have each other. [he opens the sink, and ketchup spurts on his face. Then mustard. He then sits down next to Liane, feeling sad and ashamed.]
[Coney Island Hot Dog from the outside.]
CARTMAN
Weak... I live in a hot dog.

synopsis:A lot is riding on Butter’s ability to crush the competition in the all-important dressage championship.

script:Back To The Cold War

[South Park Elementary, Mr. Garrison's classroom, daytime. All the students are taking their seats getting ready for class. Mr. Garrison walks inside, ready to begin today's lesson.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay children, let's take our seats. [grabs a stool and sits down] I know there's a lot of things going on and we're all a little bit worried. I've heard some of you express concern over current events, so I think we should discuss what's happening. It is true – Rick and I did get into a fight over the weekend. [the class is silent] Now, I don't know what you've heard and what you haven't, but Rick was wrong, okay? He's the one that needs to apologize.
WENDY
We're not worried about that, we're all worried about Putin.
MR. GARRISON
Putin? It was just a little noise when I pulled out. Nobody was "pootin", okay? And anyway, you kids shouldn't be talking about that kind of stuff! Geez!
MR. MACKEY
[opens the classroom door] Uh, kids! I need your attention! We're doing an emergency drill this morning, m'kay?
CLYDE
A drill?
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, now, we haven't done these in a long time, but we need to be prepared if the Russians decide to nuke us. Now, when you hear this sound...
MR. MACKEY
[on the intercom] The Russians are nuking us.
MR. MACKEY
...then you need to quickly and calmly get out of your seats and get to the gymnasium, m'kay?
MR. MACKEY
[intercom] The Russians are nuking us. [For a few moments, the classroom is silent and they all look confused....]
MR. MACKEY
[loudly] The Russians are fucking nuking us! Go! Go, go go! [he points to the exit of the classroom] We're all gonna die! [the kids begin to rush out] Come on! Come on! The missiles are coming! They've lost their minds! Run! Get to the gym! Get to the gym! [he opens another classroom door] Come on, we're getting nuked! Everyone to the gym! It's our only chance!
[The children get to the gymnasium in a panic.]
MR. MACKEY
Under the bleachers! Go! Come on, move! Everyone's going to die!
[All the kids get under the gymnasium bleachers and the screaming stops. A kid sneaks his head out to check outside of the bleachers.]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay. That was... 22 seconds. That's not bad, m'kay. Now, if this were real, we would just all stay here and wait to hear from our government and maybe, maybe listen to some appropriate music. Like we did back in the ‘80s.
[Music begins to play. While the song plays out, Mr. Mackey starts dancing.]
MUSIC
Take your baby by the hand,
Do the next thing that you feel,
I said...
[An ‘80s style logo appears on screen. "South Park: Back To The Cold War!" A narrator is also heard.]
NARRATOR
South Park. Back To The Cold War. Starring...
[Brief images of Butters, Linda, Stephen, a horse named Melancholy and Vladamir Putin appear on screen as the song continues on in the background.]
NARRATOR
Butters! Stephen and Linda Stotch! Melancholy, the horse! And the comedy of Vladimir Putin!
MUSIC
Dancehall days, love...
[Park County Equestrian Facility, day. Dressage practice seems to be going on. Other kids are riding their ponies, practicing for an upcoming competition.]
KELLY
Hi, Katie!
KATIE
Hi, Kelly!
GIRL 1
Oh my gosh, Pixie looks so pretty today!
GIRL 2
Thanks! I braided my pony's tail.
BUTTERS
Hi, Josslyn! Hi, Staci Mae!
GIRLS
Hi, Butters.
DRESSAGE INSTRUCTOR
Alright, pony riders. We've got a big competition this weekend, so let's line up and do our rails.
[All the kids begin to prepare for practice. Butters approaches Linda and Stephen who are watching him from a distance.]
BUTTERS
Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad!
STEPHEN
Don't wave at us, Butters! [to Linda] Judges hate when they wave. He needs to not do that.
DRESSAGE INSTRUCTOR
Okay, Staci Mae, nice trot. Here comes the jump. [the horse successfully makes the jump] Good! Very nice. Okay, next. [next one makes the jump as well] Good, Heather. That's good control of Sunshine. Good. Okay, Butters. Come on, you're next.
STEPHEN
Come on, Butters. Come on! [Butters' horse barely makes the jump and pole clunks slightly] Oh! He clunked it! It's okay... It's okay. Good job, Butters. Good job. Fuck! [to Linda] We should just pull Butters out of dressage. He sucks at this.
LINDA
Oh, we can't pull him out. He loves it.
STEPHEN
Don't you understand, Linda? I'm scared. The big competition is this weekend. Butters will be going up against the Russians. [Linda looks in worry]
LINDA
Oh, look, here comes the Russian now. [A Russian kid comes out of the horse stables]
STEPHEN AND LINDA
Boo!
STEPHEN
Boo, Russia! Boooo! [Linda pulls out a poster of Vladimir Putin's face crossed out]
MAN
Hey, what are you booing a little kid for?
STEPHEN
Don't you know who that is? That's Dan Solokov's kid! Dan Solokov? Who works at the Ace Hardware over in Meeker? Even the kid's pony is a Russian Etruscan! [turns to Solokov's kid] You piece-a-shit communist! You won't take our freedoms away! Boo, Russia!
[Mr. Mackey's office. He is sitting back in his office chair as he listens to music. He seems to be immersed in the song.]
MUSIC
Games without frontiers...
MR.MACKEY
[singing along] "War without tears... Jeux sans frontiers..." [a knock is heard] Yeah?
[The door opens. PC Principal is seen outside of the office, holding papers in his hands.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Mr. Mackey, I'd like to have a word with you.
MR. MACKEY
Oh, yeah, yes, of course, PC Principal. [he turns down the volume of his radio]
PC PRINCIPAL
I see that you've, uh, called for another nuclear emergency drill this afternoon?
MR. MACKEY
Yes, that's right. We are going to be prepared.
PC PRINCIPAL
Well, Mr. Mackey, this is the seventh drill that we've done in two days. And I see that you also put in the budget for a bomb shelter and 20 VHS copies of "Red Dawn".
MR. MACKEY
VHS is still really the best format when you think about it.
PC PRINCIPAL
Mr. Mackey, I'm starting to worry that this is sort of... nostalgic for you, like you're kind of enjoying this.
MR. MACKEY
[looking angry] Enjoying it? My job is to have this school ready. Kids need to know what Russia is capable of. Оставь меня в покое (Leave me alone).
PC PRINCIPAL
[raising an eyebrow] You speak Russian?
MR. MACKEY
No, but I've watched Hunt For Red October like 200 times.
PC PRINCIPAL
Mr. Mackey, I am not asking you. I'm telling you – stop with all the drills and stop putting ideas into our students' heads.
MR. MACKEY
No, you – you're right, of course. I'm – I'm over-reacting.
PC PRINCIPAL
Okay.
MR. MACKEY
M'kay...
[PC Principal leaves and mysterious music begins to play. Mr. Mackey checks to see if the coast is clear and makes his way out of his office. He passes by Mr. Adler and quickly enters PC Principal's office. Once he is inside, Mr. Mackey rummages through the office, hoping to find intel on PC Principal. He opens a file cabinet and snaps pictures of various files.]
[Park County Equestrian Facility. Another day of practice is under way. Butters and his parents walk in with Melancholy.]
STEPHEN
Alright, Butters, you've just got two more days before the dressage competition.
BUTTERS
I'll do my best, Dad!
STEPHEN
You're gonna have to do better than that, Butters. You see that little Russian kid over there? [he points at Solokov's kid] That kid doesn't give a shit about you. He just wants to win and take what little patriotism our country has left.
BUTTERS
That kid?
STEPHEN
You didn't live through the Cold War, Butters, but we did. This tournament is going to be turned into a political spectacle, and we have to win. Otherwise, I'm afraid we'll have to give your pony away to communists who slaughter ponies and donkeys to make skin cream. That's mostly the Chinese, but a commie's a commie.
LINDA
Better dead than red, Butters.
BUTTERS
Oh, Jesus! Not Melancholy!
STEPHEN
Now, that little prick is trying to intimidate you. I want you to go in there and show him how an American rides!
BUTTERS
[he clicks his tongue] Come on, boy! [Melancholy stops and begins pooping on the floor]
STEPHEN
Butters! Butters, what the hell are you doing?!
BUTTERS
Well, I dunno!
STEPHEN
You have to learn to control!
BUTTERS
[tongue clicking] Come on, Melancholy, come on! [A slide whistle is heard and Melancholy gets a boner]
GIRLS
Ewwww!
STEPHEN
Butters, what the hell is that?!
BUTTERS
What is what? [he looks down] Oh, geez! Put that thing away, Melancholy!
STEPHEN
[softly] Jesus, Linda, what are we gonna do?
[Mr Mackey's office. Mr. Mackey is looking through images of PC Principal in the hopes to find something that could deem suspicious. He takes notes as he does so.]
MR. MACKEY
What are you up to, you piece of shit?
[Moments later, Butters comes inside his office, looking down a bit sadly.]
BUTTERS
Hello, sir. I just needed to talk to somebody. I've been having some problems at home.
MR. MACKEY
[disinterested] Uh-huh, m'kay, that's nice. That's good to hear. Why don't you just, uh, sit there and tell me about it?
BUTTERS
Well, it's just my parents. You see, a few months ago, I saw this little girl riding a pony and I said, "Whoa! I wanna do that!"
MR. MACKEY
Uh huh...
BUTTERS
So we found a stable and a trainer, and I started to learn dressage. And I got to lease a pony, and his name is Melancholy.
MR. MACKEY
Yeah. Yeah, that must be tough. I'm sorry to hear that, m'kay.
BUTTERS
Well, I love to ride Melancholy. But now I'm feeling all this pressure to win. My parents said I have to win because it's against the Russians.
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, we – the what? [menacing music plays]
BUTTERS
It's the Russians. I mean, I guess they're just really good at dressage, but now my dad says it's a matter of national security.
MR. MACKEY
M'kay. Butters. Don't move your head.
BUTTERS
Don't move my head? I –
MR. MACKEY
Uh, uh! They're probably watching us, so keep acting like you're asking me for help.
BUTTERS
Well, o-okay, but I kind of am asking you for help, ya know, because I'm feeling really lost and miserable.
MR. MACKEY
That's good. Now listen carefully. What did your parents tell you?
BUTTERS
Well, they said if I don't do well at dressage, it could mean the end of all of our freedoms.
MR. MACKEY
Jesus Christ... M'kay! Well, Butters, you know sometimes troubles at home can be bad, m'kay. [he kneels next to Butters and whispers to him] I need you to tell me everything you know about dressage.
[Park County Equestrian Facility, the next day. Butters walks with Melancholy on the track.]
BUTTERS
We need to have a serious talk, Melancholy, and I need you to listen. [he stops walking and turns to look at Melancholy] There's a time to poop, and there's a time to work. And the best thing is to poop when your work is done. I-It's like when I'm in the classroom, sometimes I have to poop, but I have to wait until lunch break. If I really have to go, I can raise my hand and ask politely. But if you start to poop while we're competin', the judges are gonna deduct points. And then the Russians will beat us, and then you're gonna get turned into Chinese skin cream! [he approaches Melancholy to pet him] We have to do this, Melancholy. You and me have to focus like never before. Now, let's go show them what we can do! [he gets on the horse saddle with a look of determination on his face] Let's go! [he clicks his tongue]
[Uplifting music begins to play as Butters rides through the track. He smiles.]
BUTTERS
That's it! You got it, boy!
[Abruptly, the music ends and Melancholy stops to poop on the floor.]
BUTTERS
Nope! Nope! Melancholy! Over the jump, boy! [he attempts to make Melancholy go forward, but no luck] Come on, Melancholy! [Melancholy begins to trot away] What? W-Where are you going? [Butters tries to gain control of Melancholy] Melancholy, back to the jump! Whoa, Melancholy, Whoa!! W-What are you doing now?
[Melancholy approaches another horse, and a blow whistle sound is heard again. Melancholy jumps on the horse, and...]
BUTTERS
Now I'm not sure what's going on here. [the girl on the other horse screams as this continues on] No! No! No! Melancholy! Bad pony! I'm sorry, ma'am! Melancholy, to the jump!
[A shot of icy mountains, the camera pans to the Solokov's house while Russia's National Anthem plays. The montage shows scenes of Davey practicing dressage in his backyard, as well as him and his parents eating, until Mr. Mackey shows up in the window.]
[Россия - священная наша держава,
Rossiya - svyashchennaya nasha derzhava,

Россия - любимая наша страна.
Rossiya - lyubimaya nasha strana.

Могучая воля, великая слава -
Moguchaya volya, velikaya slava -

Твое достоянье на все времена!
Tvoye dostoyan'ye na vse vremena!

Славься, Отечество наше свободное,
Slav'sya, Otechestvo nashe svobodnoye,

Братских народов союз вековой,
Bratskikh narodov soyuz vekovoy,

Предками данная мудрость народная!
Predkami dannaya mudrost' narodnaya!]
[80's music plays, Mr. Mackey stealthily walks towards the stable where Davey's horse is. Someone points a gun at the back of his head.]
STEPHEN
What are you doing here?
MR. MACKEY
Don't shoot... I-I'm just the school counselor...[he turns around and sees] Mr. Stotch?
STEPHEN
Mr. Mackey? What the hell are you doing here?!
MR. MACKEY
What the hell are you doing here?
STEPHEN
I'll ask the questions, I've got the gun!
LINDA
[Linda walks out from behind the hay] We were just... having a look around...we weren't going to mess with the Russian pony. I-I promise.
STEPHEN
Shut up, Linda!
MR. MACKEY
Mr. and Mrs. Stotch, you know—your son has been having some problems on the playground at school.
STEPHEN
What kind of problems?
MR. MACKEY
Well, you know...bullies, and, uh, pressure for marihuana, you know, with—[Mr. Mackey takes the gun from Stephen] Don't fucking move!
STEPHEN AND LINDA
[raise their hands] Aaah!
MR. MACKEY
Now, I want some Goddamn answers!
STEPHEN
So, you want them to win, huh? You're a traitor!
MR. MACKEY
I'm not the traitor!
STEPHEN
Yeah, right...since when do you care about dressage?!
MR. MACKEY
Since I found out the principal is a Russian spy.
LINDA
A what?!
MR. MACKEY
There's something very big going on here, and I think it involves your son.
STEPHEN
Mr. Mackey... we were just here to try and give that pony diarrhea by feeding it Erewhon.
LINDA
It's the truth! [Linda shows a paper bag that reads Erewhon]
STEPHEN
We're on your side.
MR. MACKEY
[Mr. Mackey lowers the gun] I think I understand what's going on now... The Communists are gonna use the pony show as justification... to fire the missiles.
[Park County Equestrian Facility.]
DRESSAGE ANNOUNCER
Welcome, everyone, to the 10 and under pony dressage finals. We want to thank everyone for coming out today to support these little riders.
BUTTERS
This is it, Melancholy. We have to do this. We have to be classy. We're not gonna poop, we're not gonna get a boner, and we're certainly not gonna have unwarranted sex with the ladies. Please, boy... we have got to get this right.
[Mr. Mackey's childhood home.]
MR. MACKEY
Hi, mom.
MR. MACKEY'S MOM
Well, hi, junior! What a surprise, m'kay!
MR. MACKEY
Mom, I need to use something in my old room.
MR. MACKEY'S MOM
Well, sure, come on in!
[House's second floor.]
MR. MACKEY'S MOM
Everything is still just as you left it, son.
[Mackey enters his room, 80's music starts playing. We get to see all the different 80's paraphernalia that Mackey has.]
MR. MACKEY
Mom, I think World War 3 is about to start. I'm gonna do what I can to protect our country!
MR. MACKEY'S MOM
Oh, uh, m'kay, honey, I'll make you a snack.
[Mackey turns on his ancient computer, who says, "hello, Mr. Mackey". Mackey turns on the dial up and initializes the modem.]
[Norad Colorado Springs. Inside, the screens turn off. Mackey sends a message in saying, "the Russians are nuking us."]
NORAD DIRECTOR
What the hell was that?
NORAD MAN 1
Someone from the outside is logged into the missile defense system!
NORAD DIRECTOR
Well, kick them out! Shut off the Wi-Fi!
NORAD MAN 2
It's not coming in on Wi-Fi! It's some old, archaic technology!
MR. MACKEY
[says what he types] X equals "The Russians are nuking us." Print X, goto 10. Run.
NORAD EMPLOYEES
Wooah!
NORAD DIRECTOR
What are they trying to do?!
NORAD MAN 1
It's just repeating the same line over and over. How did they get it to do that?!
NORAD MAN 3
Sir! The computers are taking us to DEFCON 3!
NORAD DIRECTOR
[alarms start blaring, Butter's dressage competition shows on the screen] Jesus Christ... it's dressage.
[At the Kremlin in Moscow.]
KREMLIN MAN 1
Товарищ! Американцы взяли NORAD на DEFKON 3! (Comrade! The Americans have taken NORAD to DEFCON 3!)
SERGEI SHOIGU
DEFCON 3?!
KREMLIN MAN 1
Мы должны показать это президенту Путину! (We must show this to President Putin!)
SERGEI SHOIGU
Президент Путин нездоров. В последнее время он выглядит грустно-ностальгичным (President Putin is not well. He seems sadly nostalgic lately). [he knocks on the door] Президент Путин! (President Putin!) [he knocks on the door]
[They open the door, inside is Putin dancing to "Two Tribes" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.]
[When two tribes go to war
A point is all that you can score
(Score them all, score them all)
When two tribes go to war
a point is all that you can score
(Working for the black gas)]
[Butters' dressage competition, the song keeps playing in the background. Butters gets the first rail right, people cheer. Davey also gets it right and people don't react, except for Stephen, who gets pissed.]
[Cowboy number one
A born-again poor man's son
(Poor man's son)
On the air America
I modeled shirts by Van Heusen
(Working for the black gas))]
STEPHEN
[Butters misses one of the rails] Oooh, no! No!
[Yeah
You know]
[The kids get some snow cones, Melancholy poops on the field. Mr. Mackey is typing on his computer, streaming the dressage competition. In the Kremlin, they show the competition to Putin.]
[When two tribes go to war
A point is all you can score
(Storm them all, storm them all)
When two tribes go to war
A point is all you can score]
[Butters looks distraught at how better Davey is than him. The crowd also looks conflicted.]
[Working for the black gas
Switch off your shield
Switch off and feel]
MR. MACKEY
We're running out of time! Take missiles to DEFCON 2!
MR. MACKEY'S MOM
Here's your Sunny Delight and Steak-umms, honey.
MR. MACKEY
Get out of my room, mom! Gawd! Get outta my rewm!
MR. MACKEY'S MOM
Sweetheart...are you m'kay?
MR. MACKEY
[Mackey looks troubled] ‘Course I'm not m'kay! But you wouldn't understand, ‘cause you're a grown-up!
MR. MACKEY'S MOM
Honey...as your mother, I want you to know you can talk to me about whatever you want. Even if it's about being scared of gettin' old.
MR. MACKEY
Things used to be so much simpler, mama. There was a good guy and a-and a bad guy. And we all... sort of came together and loved our country...not like it is now.
MR. MACKEY'S MOM
[she reaches a stool and sits closer to Mackey] Ooh, junior. I know that gettin' old isn't so much fun, is it? We all wanna go back to a time when we were younger. You're getting to be around 55. Your pee-pee doesn't work so good, does it?
MR. MACKEY
How'd you know about that, mom?
MR. MACKEY'S MOM
Well, I'm your mom, honey. When a man gets to a point where his pee-pee doesn't work the way it used to, he starts to...well, sit in his room and play war games again, you know? But honey, those times weren't better. We were all scared. People died. That's not something to strive to get back to.
MR. MACKEY
You're right, mama...I've been bad.
MR. MACKEY'S MOM
Oh, you're not bad—
MR. MACKEY
No, I'm bad—
MR. MACKEY'S MOM
No, no, sweetheart. It-it just felt good ‘cause it was familiar. That's just sort of what us old people do.
[Park County Equestrian Facility.]
DRESSAGE ANNOUNCER
It all comes down to this. Number 8-2-3, Davey Solokov and his Russian Etruscan. If he completes this last rail, he will be the winner.
STEPHEN
We're all dead, Linda.
DRESSAGE ANNOUNCER
Rider...please demonstrate your trot.
BUTTERS
It's ok, Melancholy...we did our best...[Melancholy starts moving erratically] Whoa! Where you goin', Melancholy?
DRESSAGE ANNOUNCER
And here is the rail. Wait a minute—we have another pony in the ring!
[Melancholy runs into the ring and jumps on Davey's horse. Everyone gasps.]
LINDA
What's he doing?
STEPHEN
What's he doing?! He's fighting for democracy! Go, Butters!
CROWD
[chanting] Butters! Butters!
BUTTERS
Melancholy! Bad!
DAVEY SOLOKOV
Waagh! [Davey falls on the floor]
REFEREE
10! 9! 8!
STEPHEN
He's got 'em!
REFEREE
3! 2! [Butters tries to go and help but the referee stops him] 1! You're out!
[Everyone starts cheering, they run towards the ring, they grab Butters and raise him up in the air.]
BUTTERS
Waaaghhaaagh!
[They envelop Butters with an American flag. Putin back in the Kremlin looks at his two advisors and frowns.]
MR. MACKEY
Let me—let me through! Let me through!
STEPHEN
Mackey, we did it!
MR. MACKEY
I know! It's amazing! [Mackey grabs the flag from Butters and puts it on his shoulders] This is all a dream come true! [Mackey goes to someone holding a microphone and speaks into it] You know...the past few days, I've been re-living the past. But during this tournament, I started to change. And I just wanna say to the Russians—that if I can change, then yous can change! I know how it is when you're gettin' old, you know, and you're gettin' aggressive because your dick doesn't work the way it used to.
PUTIN
Da... da...
MR. MACKEY
But just because our dicks don't work doesn't mean we should go back to the way things were. In the immortal words of Sting—we all share the same biology. Regardless of ideology.
[Everyone starts clapping, a mocked version of "Russians" by Sting plays.
I wonder if Russians
Get diarrhea from Erewhon too]
End of Back To The Cold War


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The boys find out that the joys of playing Airsoft come with the challenges of dealing with teenagers.

script:Help, My Teenager Hates Me!

[Broflovski residence, Gerald's office, daytime. Gerald is seen sitting down as he types on his computer, presumably doing work. All of a sudden, Kyle comes rushing into the office as he begins to talk fast and pace around the room excitedly.]
KYLE
Dad! Dad, there's this new place and you can actually go and shoot each other, only it's soft BBs and they're biodegradable, and the guns are, like, totally real except you don't actually get hurt, and it's like paintball except for there's no mess, and the stuff all looks totally real, and it's called Airsoft and can I get one?
GERALD
[confused] Wha– Wha– What?
KYLE
There's an airsoft field where everybody plays on teams, and I promise I'll take good care of the equipment, and if you think about it, it's a really great hobby for team building and learning communication and –
GERALD
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
KYLE
I was just thinking if you could come to the Airsoft store with me – [clasps his hands together] please, please, please, all my friends already bought their stuff, and it's totally a way for us to play outside like you always say – [rushes out to the door] come on, please only we can't tell mom cuz she won't understand, but it's totally safe cuz you wear eye protection.
GERALD
[gets up from his chair] Okay, okay, Kyle, breathe.
[A few moments later, they both arrive outside of South Park Airsoft Armory. Kyle gets out of the car, clearly excited to enter the shop.]
KYLE
Here it is! Isn't this cool?!
GERALD
"Airsoft Armory"?
KYLE
Come on, dad! You gotta check it out!
[Inside the shop. Kyle opens the doors and rushes inside to check everything it has to offer. Gerald walks inside too, looking rather surprised to the amount of fake artillery they sell.]
GERALD
My God! Is this stuff real?!
KYLE
No, dad! It's Airsoft. It's like paintball, only it's way cooler and it just looks totally real.
GERALD
I-I really don't think your mom would approve, Kyle…
KYLE
Dad… please. I'm not a baby anymore. The other guys – they already got their stuff. We're playing today! Can I please just get, like, an AK-47 and maybe a glock?
GERALD
This stuff is expensive! Is this really how you want to spend your allowance?
KYLE
[excitedly] Yeah, yeah! It really is! [he walks away to check out other merchandise]
GERALD
These are all, like, legal, right?
AIRSOFT ARMORY SALESMAN
Uh, yes, sir. You see, you load these soft BBs into the guns and they just kinda sting. And you can put the soft BBs into grenades, rocket launchers, all kinds of stuff.
GERALD
So it's all totally safe?
AIRSOFT ARMORY SALESMAN
Well, I wouldn't particularly say that…I mean – all the stuff is safe, the guns and grenades and things… but – but not necessarily the people who mostly play Airsoft…
GERALD
What people mostly play Airsoft?
AIRSOFT ARMORY SALESMAN
Teenagers. [the music intensifies]
[Blinky's Airsoft. Teenagers are gathered around looking all bored and uninterested as they listen to the referee's instructions.]
AIRSOFT REFEREE
Alright, Airsofters, let's listen up. Before we let you onto the field, we need to run through our safety precautions.
TEENAGERS
[in unison] Bruhhh..
TEENAGER 1
We know all the safety stuff –
AIRSOFT REFEREE
First, your Airsoft guns must all have a red tip –
TEENAGER 2
Bruh, we know…
AIRSOFT REFEREE
Second, there is no full auto allowed on the field.
TEENAGER 3
Bruh…
AIRSOFT REFEREE
Third, there is a 500 fps limit for your BBs.
TEENAGER 1
Bruh, can we play now?
AIRSOFT REFEREE
If you're hit by a BB, raise your hand, say "hit", and go back to respawn.
TEENAGER 2
Yes, already, yes!
AIRSOFT REFEREE
Alright, you guys are Team Rogue Wolf. [he pulls out a clipboard] You guys will be playing against– where is Team Floppy Weiner?
CARTMAN
Right here!
[Kyle, Stan, Kenny and Cartman come into frame a few moments later with Airsoft guns and equipment in hand. The boys look excited to play some Airsoft.]
TEENAGER 3
What?!
TEENAGER 2
Bruh, no! We aren't playing with little kids!
TEENAGER 3
Yeah, it'll be too easy!
AIRSOFT REFEREE
Alright, fine! Then we'll split the kids up on two teams and each one will have a teenager partner.
TEENAGER 3
Bruh, seriously?
AIRSOFT REFEREE
Kid with the poof ball, that's your teenager–
TEENAGER 1
Bruh!
AIRSOFT REFEREE
Green hat kid, that's your teenager– Team B, those are your two teenagers.
CARTMAN
Alright, sweet! Me and Kenny and our teenagers are gonna smoke you guys!
[Airsoft battle area. Everyone begins to get into their positions as the game is set to begin.]
TEENAGER 4
Go! Go, go, go, go!
TEENAGER 1
Come on! This way! [BB bullets begin to go off]
CARTMAN
Yes! Yes! Yes!!
[Intense music begins playing as the boys and the teenagers play Airsoft intensely. The sound of BB bullets are heard all over the field as the teams try to eliminate each other.]
[Meanwhile, Kyle and Cartman get into a safe position in the field. Kyle shoots BBs at Cartman and successfully manages to hit him.]
KYLE
I got you, Cartman!
CARTMAN
You didn't get me!
KYLE
I totally got you! I heard it hit your jacket. Say hit and and go back to respawn.
CARTMAN
You didn't hit me, Kyle! The BBs bounced off a leaf or something, 'cause– [Kyle begins to fire off BBs and Cartman raises a hand in defeat] Agh, agh! Ok – ok, hit! You got me. That was sweet. [walks off]
STAN'S TEENAGER
I'm outta green gas, you got green gas?!
STAN
Yeah, I got some right here, partner! [he gets out an air tank and hands it to his partner]
KENNY'S TEENAGER
Bruh, keep shooting!
KENNY
(Yeah!! Woo-hoo!)
[In another area of the airsoft field. Kyle is wandering around aimlessly, looking for other targets. Cartman is behind him with a BB sniper rifle and begins to slowly aim toward Kyle.]
CARTMAN
[to himself] Oh, my God… this is the greatest day of my fucking life.
[Cartman slowly steadies his aim, and after a few seconds, he shoots a BB at Kyle's face.]
KYLE
Ow, oww! [he raises his hand and walks off] Hit!
CARTMAN
Yes! Yes!! That was so awesome!! You guys, Airsoft fucking rules! This is– [a BB goes off and hits him in the chest] Ow! Hit! Hit! This is sweet!
[Later in the day. The boys are walking back home from Blinky's Airsoft. On the way back, they express their excitement over today.]
KYLE
That was so cool!
CARTMAN
Best thing ever!
KENNY
(That was fucking great!)
STAN
Dude, I can't believe we tied! That was epic.
CARTMAN
Yeah, well, Team Floppy Weiner will get you guys next time!
KYLE
That was seriously the best time I've had in forever!
KENNY
(Me too!)
STAN
And you know what else is cool? We all have teenagers now!
KYLE
I know! My teenager said he's gonna come over and show me how to clean my gun! [he notices Cartman crying] Cartman? Are you ok?
CARTMAN
[sniffles] I'm just really happy, you guys… [his voice breaks a bit from crying] Airsoft is seriously, like, the greatest thing in the whole world. Well, here's my house. Thanks, you guys. For just a few, brief hours I forgot how much everything sucks. [he walks back home] Can we promise each other we'll do Airsoft, like, all the time?
STAN
Hell yeah, dude! We just gotta keep our teenagers happy and we can play Airsoft all the time!
CARTMAN
[softly] I love you guys. [he makes his way inside his hot dog house]
[Broflovski residence, the bathroom, nighttime. Kyle is standing on a stool as he applies makeup on his cheek to cover up his bruise from earlier today in Airsoft. Kyle has a smile on his face. Gerald walks in on him, looking confused at what Kyle is doing.]
GERALD
Hey, Kyle… Uh, how did the Airsoft go?
KYLE
I took a BB right to the face with a sniper rifle. It was so great, dad!
GERALD
Are you sure this isn't all a little too much for you, son?
KYLE
I'm not a baby anymore, dad! [the doorbell rings] Ooh! Oh, that's probably my teenager! See ya, dad! I love you! [he makes his way to go open the door]
GERALD
I love you too, Kyle.
KYLE
[the doorbell ring is being constantly rung] I got it!
SHEILA
Gerald… why is Kyle wearing my makeup on his face?
GERALD
He's just… experimenting.
[Downstairs in the living room. Kyle walks over to the front door to open it as the doorbell constantly rings. He opens the door to see his teenager and the mother.]
MOTHER
Are you Kyle?
KYLE
Yeah!
MOTHER
I'm here to drop off Trevor. He said he is your teenager now.
KYLE
Yeah, that's right!
MOTHER
Okay! Well, good luck.
TREVOR
What time are you picking me up?!
MOTHER
Just gimme a call– don't make it too soon, though, because I am going to relax.
TREVOR
Fine, go ahead, I'm glad! Go away, I don't wanna see your stupid fucking face!
[Trevor flips off his mother and enters inside. He makes himself comfortable on the living room couch as he grabs the TV remote and scrolls through channels.]
KYLE
Cool, dude, so, uh, you wanna, like, clean our Airsoft guns?
TREVOR
[angrily] I'm fucking starving to death! Can you make me some fucking food?!
KYLE
Well…Like, what kind of food do you want?
TREVOR
Fucking leave me alone!!
KYLE
Okay! Okay! Okay! [he walks away from Trevor]
[Tegridy Farms, Stan's room. He is cleaning his airsoft gun and his phone begins to ring. He picks up.]
STAN
Hello?
STAN'S TEENAGER
Bruh, how do I make ramen?
STAN
[pause] Excuse me?
STAN'S TEENAGER
I'm starving, and the instructions are all stupid.
STAN
Oh, is this my teenager? How's it going, dude?
STAN'S TEENAGER
It's not going! The ramen's all hard and I can't eat it like that!
STAN
Well, you have to put the noodles in boiling water.
STAN'S TEENAGER
Where do I get water?
STAN
You… Do you have a sink?
STAN'S TEENAGER
Bruh.
STAN
Bruh, what?
STAN'S TEENAGER
I'm sorry I'm not a five-star chef!!
STAN
Hey, man, it's cool! Lemme, uh– lemme slow it down for ya.
[Cartman's hot dog house. Cartman is watching Airsoft compilation videos on his phone.]
SWAMP SNIPER
That one right there! Take him out!
CARTMAN
Dude, Swamp Sniper rules.
[A few seconds later, Cartman's teenager walks inside without saying a word. He walks up to the refrigerator to look for food.]
CARTMAN
[confused] Hello? [his teenager says nothing] What– What are you doing, dude?
CARTMAN'S TEENAGER
I need a bathroom!
CARTMAN
You– You need to use my bathroom?
CARTMAN'S TEENAGER
I have to go to the bathroom– brah, what?! [he enters the bathroom and slams the door shut]
[McCormick Residence, living room. A knock is heard on the door and Kenny goes to open it. It's Kyle.]
KYLE
Dude, Kenny, the weirdest thing just happened. My teenager showed up at my house and he's acting really strange.
KENNY
(Yeah! Mine too.)
KYLE
Yours did too?
KENNY'S TEENAGER
Why do I have all these fucking zits on my face?!
KENNY
(Dude, I don't know, I'm trying to think!)
KENNY'S TEENAGER
You don't even fucking care! You don't care because you don't even fucking know me!! [he slams the bathroom door shut]
KYLE
What the hell are these things?
[Blinky's Airsoft arena, daytime. A match of Airsoft is taking place. Stan and Kenny are with their respective teams. Kenny runs for cover and begins to shoot BBs at the enemy team. Stan sneaks out to check if the coast is clear, but Kenny begins to shoot. He runs for cover with his teenager teammate.]
STAN
Dude, that's my friend Kenny, we gotta kill him!
STAN'S TEENAGER
I don't take orders from you!
STAN
Okay, okay, but if we kill Kenny we get a point, right? Come on!
[The match continues on, as Stan fires more BBs. They all hit Kenny as he tries to run away.]
KENNY
(Agh! Hit, hit, hit!) [he raises his hand]
AIRSOFT REFEREE
Hey, hey, hey! No shooting from less than 10 feet!
STAN'S TEENAGER
I wasn't less than 10 feet!
STAN
It's okay, it's fine. We're sorry.
STAN'S TEENAGER
I'm not gonna play anymore. This is stupid!
STAN
Dude, it's ok, it's just a gay rule. Come on, let's beat these guys!
[The match continues. More BBs begin to fire off and the game begins to intensify.]
TEENAGER 1
Hit!
STAN
[he takes his phone out and dials] Dude, Kyle, where are you? We started playing like 20 minutes ago.
[Inside of a supermarket. Kyle is seen walking an aisle.]
KYLE
Yeah, I know! My teenager asked me to take him shopping for hair gel.
STAN
Hair gel?! What the fuck, dude, we're getting killed out here!
KYLE
Just do your best, I'll be there as fast as I can! [hangs up the call] Okay, here it is. This is the health care aisle. Could you go a little faster?
[Trevor, Kyle's teenager, walks very slowly while pushing on a shopping cart. He is looking down angrily at the floor.]
KYLE
Okay, here's all the hair product stuff. Which one would you like to use?
TREVOR
I don't know.
KYLE
What?
TREVOR
[loudly] I don't know!
CARTMAN
[he walks up to Kyle] Kyle? What are you doing here?
KYLE
Ugh, nothing, I'm… I'm just shopping with my teenager.
TREVOR
Can we go now?
KYLE
Okay, but you asked me if I could buy you some hair gel.
TREVOR
Shut up…
CARTMAN
Well, at least I'm not the only one dealing with this crap.
[Cartman's teenager walks in. Similarly to Trevor, he pushes a shopping cart slowly while looking down on the floor.]
KYLE
Your guy wants hair gel, too?
CARTMAN
No, my teenager wants more lotion. [he takes Kyle to the side to talk with him privately] All this guy does is hang out in the bathroom and go through like two bottles of lotion a day. I swear I don't know how soft you could possibly want your hands to be.
KYLE
I just wanna get to the Airsoft field. Stan says your team is killing them.
CARTMAN
[excitedly] Damn right! Team Floppy Weiner will destroy you guys!
KYLE
Yeah, we'll see when I use my sniper rifle!
CARTMAN
You have to find me first!
CARTMAN'S TEENAGER
I gotta go to the bathroom.
CARTMAN
Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me! There's one over by the registers. No, you are not taking the lotion! [he grabs it from his teenager]
CARTMAN'S TEENAGER
I fucking hate you! [he walks away angrily]
CARTMAN
Okay, I'm sorry you hate me. Just wanna fucking play Airsoft, buddy.
[Tegridy Farms. Stan is sleeping very comfortably, until he gets a phone call.]
STAN
Oh, my God, you gotta be shitting me. [Stan answers the phone] Yeah—hello?
[In Stan's Teenager room.]
STAN'S TEENAGER
[the teenager is playing with a lighter] I'm not gay.
STAN
Whuh—what?
STAN'S TEENAGER
Why'd you call me gay?! Like, what the hell do you know?! You don't even fucking know me.
STAN
I-I didn't call you gay.
STAN'S TEENAGER
They said I couldn't shoot a BB within 10 feet, and I just had to say bang bang, and you got all Salty and said I was gay.
STAN
I was saying the rule was gay. I wasn't talking anything about sexual orientation.
STAN'S TEENAGER
Bruh.
STAN
You're right, I shouldn't have used that word! Look—I was one of the first people ever to say there was nothing wrong with being gay. I had a dog that was gay!
STAN'S TEENAGER
Oh, so I'm a fucking dog now?! I'll fucking kill you!
STAN
Okay, dude… what… do you want me to do?
STAN'S TEENAGER
I want you to just leave me alone!
STAN
Okay, but you called me… hello? Hello?
STAN'S TEENAGER
[stars screaming]
STAN
What are you doing?
STAN'S TEENAGER
I'm holding my hand over a lighter! It's burning the shit out of my hand
STAN
Okay, don't hold your hand over a lighter.
STAN'S TEENAGER
Bruh! Bruh, this hurts so bad! Oh dude, it's fucking black! Is that what a third degree burn looks like?!
STAN
Jesus fucking Christ.
STAN'S TEENAGER
Dood, I just so lit burned my hand. I need like—I need like emergency services. Bruh, that was stupid.
STAN
Yeah, that was kinda stupid.
STAN'S TEENAGER
I'm not fucking stupid!
[At Denny's.]
STAN
I seriously don't know what to do… I've tried being nice, I've tried being harsh… and I get nothing from my teenager. Nothing.
KENNY
(Yeah…)
KYLE
Well, you're lucky. At least your teenager doesn't threaten to kill you.
STAN
I'd love him to threaten to do anything. I'd love him to do. Anything.
CARTMAN
On the rare occasion that my teenager isn't in the bathroom, all he does is talk about his miserable life. I'm like—okay, dude, I've got problems too. But of course teenagers don't care about your problems. I'm like, "look, buddy, I live in a hot dog. Ok? Like, maybe let's stop bitching and just play Airsoft." But you can't say that because then they're just gonna—
BOYS
Want to kill themselves.
CARTMAN
Yes, yes.
KENNY
(So, what do we do? Do we give up Airsoft?)
STAN
No, we can't give up on Airsoft—I'm like four hundred dollars into this hobby.
KYLE
And we love it.
STAN
Except for the part about being around teenagers.
KYLE
Well, apparently a lot of people are in the same situation we're in.
STAN
What do you mean?
KYLE
I've been reading this book—"Help, My Teenager Hates Me".
STAN
Wow.
KYLE
Yeah…and… it has some interesting ideas. It says we're basically just dealing with an age difference and we need to try and connect with them.
KENNY
(How?)
KYLE
It says…we should take them camping.
CARTMAN
[side-eyes Kenny] Camping?
[At a camping spot. The boys are doing everything, while the teenagers sit around bored.]
KENNY'S TEENAGER
Bruh…
THE TEENAGERS
Bruh…
STAN
Alright, guys! We got the tents all set up.
KYLE
Yeah, check 'em out!
KENNY
(Yeah, it's really beautiful.)
KYLE
There's a lake over there where we can rent kayaks!
STAN
So, what do you guys wanna do?
STAN'S TEENAGER
Go home?
STAN
'Kay, yeah, we can do that later, but first maybe, um… let's bond a bit…
CARTMAN
[waiting outside the bathroom] Okay, looks like the tents are set up—can you come out now?
CARTMAN'S TEENAGER
[inside the bathroom] I'm going to the bathroom.
CARTMAN
Okay, well, you should probably finish up. I know you took the lotion in there. You really don't need soft hands for camping.
CARTMAN'S TEENAGER
[inside the bathroom] Leave me alone!
CARTMAN
[Cartman tries opening the door, but it's locked, so he knocks] Come on, dude. No shit in the world takes that long.
[At Kyle's house. Kyle is sitting on his bed, looking troubled at his airsoft gun.]
GERALD
[knocks on the door] Hey, buddy, what's up? I thought you were gonna go out and play Airsoft today?
KYLE
No… I don't think I'm gonna go…
GERALD
Oh. [Gerald sits besides Kyle on the bed] D-Did something happen?
KYLE
You wouldn't understand, Dad. I just can't deal with teenagers.
GERALD
Oh. Well, you know, they say that the… brain chemistry of a teenager is the same as that of a psychopath. The hormones and all that—it's been proven they're literally criminally insane.
KYLE
You know, I just [Kyle starts to get teary eyed]—I just wanted to have fun—and shoot my friends. [Kyle reaches closer to Gerald, crying] I-I just wanted to shoot my friends, dad.
GERALD
[Gerald hugs Kyle] Oh, buddy. Well, maybe you could ask the Airsoft field to let you play without the teenagers.
KYLE
We did! They said they hate the teenagers just as much as anybody, but they can't get rid of them. And we've got no one else to partner with.
GERALD
Well… did you guys ever consider your dads?
[South Park Airsoft Armory.]
GERALD
Come on in, boys.
RANDY
Jesus Christ…
STUART
How long has this store been here?
GERALD
[Gerald grabs one of the rifles and cocks it] What do you think? This one can shoot a thousand BBs in like five seconds.
RANDY
Seems pretty dangerous. What if the police thought that gun was real?
GERALD
No, it's safe. See? As long as your gun has a red tip and you're white, police won't shoot you.
RANDY
Oh, that's good.
AIRSOFT ARMORY SALESMAN
How can I, uh… help you gentlemen?
GERALD
We need some equipment. We're gonna try and take out some teenagers.
AIRSOFT ARMORY SALESMAN
Uh… I think that's a somewhat foolhardy plan. Have you seen the kind of weaponry the teenagers buy? It's some of the biggest, nastiest weapons we sell.
GERALD
Yeah, well, I've got something bigger. [Gerald pulls out a credit card] American Express Platinum. Give me one of everything you have.
AIRSOFT ARMORY SALESMAN
Yes, sir!
[Blinky's Airsoft.]
STAN
We… have completely had it up to here with you!
CARTMAN
Up to here!
STAN
Our friend Kyle just wanted to play Airsoft. And now he's quit because of your attitudes. What do you have to say for yourselves?
STAN'S TEENAGER
Bruh.
STAN
Yeah, bruh. Great, thank you. [Stan turns around pissed] I can't… I can't…
CARTMAN
Guys, things have to improve. They just have to. I've never seen anyone so disrespectful.
KENNY
(And completely insensitive! What's going to happen when you grow up?! You have to learn responsibility!)
CARTMAN
I've never seen Kenny like this, ever.
STAN'S TEENAGER
Fine, then just leave! Cuz we don't want you here.
STAN
And we don't want you here! We just wanna fucking play Airsoft without any of you on our team!
TEENAGER 1
Fine, then why don't you just be on your own team?
STAN
That sounds totally fine! Us against you, let's fucking go!
TEENAGER 2
Fine and if we win, you stay out of our lives forever!
STAN
Fine, and you too when we beat all of you!
TEENAGER 3
Yeah, you and what army?!
GERALD
This army!
STAN
[Gerald, Randy and Stuart walk into the place] Dad?
KENNY
(Dad?)
STUART
Any of you pussy teenagers wanna Airsoft against some drunk rednecks?
KYLE
We got new partners, guys!
CARTMAN
That's awesome. I wish I had a dad. And that I didn't live in a hot dog.
RANDY
Oh, we got you a partner too, Eric. You might remember Stan's Uncle Jimbo.
JIMBO
["My Name Is Ruin" by Gary Numan starts playing, Jimbo walks in fully equipped, holding an airsoft minigun] Did somebody say somethin' about Airsoft against teenagers?!
[The teenagers look scared, a montage starts. The two teams, the kids with the adults and the teenagers get on the Airsoft field and start shooting each other.]
TEENAGER 4
Ow! Hit! Ow! I said hit, you bitch!
STUART
That's it, son! Light 'em up!
KENNY
(Fuck yeah, Dad!)
TEENAGER 5
Hit!
TEENAGER 4
Hit!
TEENAGER 6
Bruh!
JIMBO
[Jimbo shoots the minigun at several teenagers] Yee-haw! [to Cartman] But there's one teenager I can't seem to find!
CARTMAN
I know where he is… [Cartman walks up to the bathrooms] I'm so sick of this crap… [he cocks his gon and kicks the door in]
CARTMAN'S TEENAGER
[busy in the bathroom] Bruh! What the hell are you doin'?!
CARTMAN
What you do to Jegens Lotion isn't right. [Cartman sets his rifle to full auto, and starts shooting the teenager]
CARTMAN'S TEENAGER
Ow! Ow! Ow! Bruh! Agh, bruh! Aah!
CARTMAN
[shooting the whole cartridge] Aaaagh!
CARTMAN'S TEENAGER
Ow, my dick! My dick! Aagh!
STAN
They're not coming out of cover! I don't see them!
RANDY
It's ok, I have an idea… [Randy takes out a jar of Tegridy Weed] Cover me! [Stan provides cover while Randy runs to the middle of the field and sets the opened jar on a box, then runs back to cover]
TEENAGER 7
[sniffs the weed] Bruh…
TEENAGER 1
[sniffs] Dood… that's weed. I smell weed.
TEENAGER 3
[in the meantime, Randy prepares a grenade of BBs, while the teenagers approach the weed in the middle of the field] That smells dope!
TEENAGER 4
Dood, it's a whole lit jar of weed!
TEENAGER 1
Dope! That is so dope, bruh! [Randy throws the BBs grenade to the middle of the teenagers]
TEENAGER 8
Bruh.
TEENAGERS
[the grenade explodes, the teenagers fall on the floor] Ow! Aaagh! Ow! Bruh! Bruh! Aaagh! Bruh!
STAN
Yeah!
[In the street, walking back home. The boys, their dads and Jimbo are cheering due to the teenagers' defeat.]
STAN
That was so epic!
GERALD
Did you see how those teenagers ran?
STAN
That was so sweet, you guys! I bet the teenagers will never go back to that place again!
STUART
Of course they won't! I saw half of 'em break their guns in frustration.
KYLE
[to the parents] Hey, thanks, you guys. We couldn't have gotten rid of the teenagers without you.
STAN
Yeah, thanks, Dad.
KENNY
(Thanks, Dad.)
GERALD
Hey, that's what we're here for, right? We're just glad you wanted to spend some time with us.
JIMBO
Well, I'm hungry, is there any place around here to get a hot dog?
CARTMAN
Yes… yes, I live in a hot dog! It's right over here! Come on, you guys, help me get it all ready!
STAN
Ok, let's go!
KYLE
Come on, guys!
RANDY
["My Name is Ruin" by Gary Numan plays again, Randy points his rifle at the boys running towards the hot dog] Should I take them out now?
GERALD
[Gerald makes Randy lower his gun] Not yet… we still have a few good years before they turn into monsters.
End of Help, My Teenager Hates Me!

synopsis:Butters is shocked to learn that people in South Park don’t understand what St. Patrick’s Day is really about.

script:Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special

[Tegridy Farms, kitchen, sunrise. Stan and Shelley are having breakfast, with Stan doing his homework at the same time. Sharon puts an egg for Shelley.]
SHARON
Eat your breakfast, Stan, you're gonna be late for school.
STAN
You told me to finish my homework!
SHARON
Do both, come on guys, we gotta get going. [suddenly, Randy comes in, with a fake red beard on the face and dressed with a green big hat, green coat and brown shorts]
RANDY
Hey whoa, whoa. What the fuck is going on?
SHARON
I'm about to take the kids to school, why?
RANDY
Hello?! It's St. Patrick's day.
STAN
I know. I'm wearing green. [he shows a green T-shirt under his jacket]
RANDY
You guys this is Tegridy Weed's biggest day of the year. I need help with the St. Patrick's Day Special.
SHARON
Sorry, Randy, the kids aren't missing school. Come on, guys, let's go. [she leaves with the children]
RANDY
Okay, yeah, great, don't worry about it, I'll do it all myself. Again. [he picks a box of Tegridy Weed] Top O' the mornin' to ya! [he kicks the backdoor open and heads outside]
[The camera cuts to the backyard, where Towelie, all green, is smoking with a pipe and sitting near a table with other three boxes of Tegridy Weed.]
RANDY
This is God damn ridiculous. Piece a shit family.
TOWELIE
How's it going, Randy?
RANDY
[he puts his box on the table] Ugh, I'm just so stressed out! We have to make a huge profit today or the whole year is fucked. How's the St. Patrick's Day Special?
TOWELIE
I think it's better than last year's.
RANDY
Lemme see... [he tries the pipe] Oh, wow... Wow... [he tapdances] This is gonna be our best special ever! Come on, let's get the truck loaded up!
[The frontyard. Randy and Towelie are carrying the weed to their booth.]
RANDY
Let's sell what we can from our drive up booth, and then later we can hit the Irish bar. What the fuck? [he sees Steve, dressed just like him, setting up his own booth and throws the box he was carrying down in anger] Hey! Excuse me!
STEVE
Oh, good morning, Randy.
RANDY
What do you think you're doing?
STEVE
Oh. We're, uh, doing a St. Patrick's Day Special.
RANDY
No, you're not.
STEVE
Uhh, yeah. We are.
RANDY
So first you steal my idea of selling weed and now you're stealing my idea of doing a St. Patrick's Day Special!
STEVE
Pretty sure St. Patrick's Day wasn't your idea.
RANDY
Is that right? Okay... Game on, motherfucker. [he heads back inside]
[Butters' house. In his bedroom, Butters checks his St. Patrick's Day's attire in the mirror.]
BUTTERS
[singing] Loo loo loo! It's St. Patrick's Day! Looo loo loo! De doot be do!
LINDA
[from downstairs] Come on Butters, time for school!
BUTTERS
Okay, mom! [he gets to the living room, where Stephen is reading a newspaper] Ohhh dad, are you wearin' green or are you gonna get a pinch?
STEPHEN
Ha ha... I've got a green tie on, you little rascal!
LINDA
[comes in] And I'm wearing a green scarf!
BUTTERS
Okay! Well someone's gettin a pinch today!
[South Park Elementary. A lot of students wearing green enter the building. Butters walks through the corridor, checking who's wearing green.]
BUTTERS
Hey, Clyde! You got your green on! Hey Jimmy! Nice green pants! Tee-hee! Te hee hee hee! [he walks to the boys, who also are wearing green] Happy St. Patrick's Day, fellas!
KYLE
Hey, Butters.
BUTTERS
You guys all look very festive!
CARTMAN
[unenthusiastically] Yeah, it's super fun. St. Patrick's Day rules.
BUTTERS
Oh, I hope they put green food coloring in our milk at lunchtime again like last year! [he notices a girl walking by him, who's apparently not wearing green] Uh-oh! Hey, Kelly-Ann! What's going on?
KELLY-ANN
What do you mean?
BUTTERS
Looks like someone forgot what day it was! Ha ha! Pi-i-i-i-nch! [he pinches her]
[The camera cuts to the outside, where two police cars are parked. Inside, two police officers cuff Butters, with another two and the students watching.]
BUTTERS
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do anything wrong, honest!
JOHNSON
Do you know what sexual assault is?
BUTTERS
I'm so sorry! Please! It's just... Well, she had it comin' on account of the way she was dressed!
EVERYONE
[groaning] Ohhh!
JOHNSON
Wow, kid, wow!
OFFICER
Alright. Take this shithead to the station and book him for sexual assault of a minor. [the two officers carry Butters outside]
BUTTERS
Oh, jeez, I didn't know Kelly-Ann was a minor! Well, she didn't have a mining helmet or a pick axe or anything!
[Park County Police Station. Butters is in a cell, shivering.]
YATES
[reading a file] Okay, looks like you assaulted a nine year old girl... No prior history... assault took place at an elementary school.
BUTTERS
But... But, sir, it's St. Patrick's Day.
YATES
Look, I know! It's St. Patrick's Day, right? If people don't wear green, they get pinched!
BUTTERS
Yes! Right!
YATES
Yeah... Only one problem. The little girl you pinched? Kelly-Ann Barlow? She was wearing green socks. [he shows a picture of Kelly-Ann with a green sock] You're a goddamn sexual predator. Don't let him jack off in here! These types always mess up my jail!
[Credigree Weed. The place is full of people buying Steve's special.]
STEVE
Welcome, everyone, welcome. Thank you for coming to Credigree Farms!
[Randy, who's hiding behind a bush, comes out and starts playing a flute. Everyone turns their eyes to him, and he hides back.]
STEVE
Randy, we all see you behind the bush. [Randy comes out, tries to play a little more and hides again] Everyone sees you. [Randy leaves the bush]
RANDY
[with a fake Irish accent] Oh. Uh... A very happy mornin', everybody! And a foine St. Patrick's Day to all of ye. I don't know if ya noohticed. But, uh, there's a farm across the street selling weed also... And the owner is actually 10 par-cent Irish!
STEVE
So, obviously, you're upset that you don't seem to have any customers.
RANDY
What I'm upset about is a wee little thing called "cultural appropriation". Ever heard of it? That's why we can't wear sombreros on Cinco de Mayo. Why we can't dress like Indians on Halloween.
STEVE
What's your point?
RANDY
I'm looking at my point, you racist son of a bitch. You have no right to wear that stuff. It is offensive. Come on, guys! St. Patrick's Day is the one day of the year we have left where we can actually celebrate being white. Any other day that we tried to be proud of our culture, we would get immediately cancelled by Twitter! And yet for some reason, you're all over here, buying your weed from someone who is fine mocking our customs and traditions.
STEVE
Maybe they're here because my St. Patrick's Day Special is better than yours. [Randy punches Steve and the two of them begin fighting]
[Sometime later, two police cars are parked in front of Credigree Weed. Two officers cuff Randy and carry him away.]
RANDY
Okay, yeah... Yeah, let's arrest the white leprechaun. Cuz, you know, can't have one day for a mostly white culture, right? Don't wanna get cancelled. I guess don't arrest him for cultural appropriations? Guess... Guess that only works one way, huh?
[Park County Police Station, interrogation room. Butters is cuffed to the table. Suddenly, a buzzer fires and a woman enters the room.]
PUBLIC DEFENDER
Leopold Stotch?
BUTTERS
Yes?
PUBLIC DEFENDER
I'm the public defender that's been assigned to your case.
BUTTERS
Ugh... Okay... Oh, God...
PUBLIC DEFENDER
Is there a problem?
BUTTERS
Wul, it's just... I mean... What you're wearing. You know, it's St. Patrick's Day, you're not wearing any... You don't have any green socks on, do you?
PUBLIC DEFENDER
No, I'm wearing yellow socks. [she shows her socks]
BUTTERS
Ohhhhh God... I wanna pinch you so bad...
PUBLIC DEFENDER
I'm here to help you, okay? Now, this woman that you're accused of groping, were you two in any kind of relationship?
BUTTERS
No, ma'am, could you... Maybe put on some green lipstick or something?
PUBLIC DEFENDER
Before you touched the victim, did she give you any kind of consent?
BUTTERS
Well, technically, yes! I mean, St. Patrick's Day is a wonderful day where we remember a British Roman man who went to Ireland and converted the whole country to Christianity! And he used a clover to represent the Holy Trinity, so we're supposed to celebrate that by wearing green and if you don't wear green you get a pinch!
PUBLIC DEFENDER
And who is this St. Patrick to you?
BUTTERS
See?! That's the problem! Nobody knows how great he really was.
PUBLIC DEFENDER
[angry] Okay... [she walks to Butters] Can you show me where on the body you touched the girl?
BUTTERS
Oh, God...
PUBLIC DEFENDER
Did you put your fingers inside her?
BUTTERS
I didn't finger nothin! I swear it was just a tiny little St. Patrick's Day pinch! It was... It was like this! [he pinches her hand, who slaps him in return] Ohhhg! [she slaps him again] Oh!
PUBLIC DEFENDER
I am not representing this fucking animal! [she gets her things and leaves the room, then comes back and slaps Butters again]
BUTTERS
Ohhgu!
[The work room. Two officers bring a man and a woman in custody.]
OFFICER
We got some more St. Patrick's Day offenders.
YATES
Well, it's 10 a.m. and you people are already wasted, huh?
MAN
Yeah, yeah, copper, you got me, big deal.
[The scene cuts to Butters, who's back in the cell along with six other people. One of them is peeing on the wall, and another one vomits on the floor.]
BUTTERS
[starts praying] Dear St. Patrick... If you're really up there... I've always done my best to honor you on this most holy day... You went to Ireland, and you got all those pagan worshippers to follow Christ. If there's any way... that you could help me now... just, like, send me a leprechaun or something... I will be forever your dark servant. Amen.
JOHNSON
[he opens the cell door] Alright, we got us another one! [an officer's shown carrying Randy]
OFFICER
Let's go, buddy.
RANDY
Yeah yeah, you don't have to push me, copper.
BUTTERS
Whoa...
YATES
When are you people gonna learn, huh? It's not even lunchtime, for Christ's sake. [the officer pushes Randy inside the cell and Johnson closes the door]
RANDY
I want my phone call.
BUTTERS
Wow wee, are you a real leprechaun?
RANDY
Yeah, I'm a real fucking leprechaun!
BUTTERS
Alright! Are we gonna bust outta here or what?
RANDY
Hell yeah we're gonna bust outta here, what do you have planned?
[A Jamaican style logo appears on screen. "The Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special". An announcer is also heard.]
ANNOUNCER
Awww, yeah... And now back to the Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special.
[The scene cuts to Credigree Weed, which's still crowded. Steve's selling his special to a customer.]
STEVE
Alright, there you go, happy St. Patrick's Day and thanks for buying Credigree! [the customer leaves and an old man approaches him]
FARTY O'COOL
Good afternoon, sir! Are you the creator of Credigree Weed?
STEVE
I am.
FARTY O'COOL
Well, I'm the owner of the Irish bar here in town. Farty O'Cools. We've got thousands of patrons today and I'm looking to score some weed.
STEVE
You need marijuana for the Irish bar.
FARTY O'COOL
Well, everyone's been drinkin' since 9 a.m. But now they need something to take the edge off until they start doing coke at 7:30.
STEVE
Well, I'm sure we can help you out. How much Credigree are you looking to buy?
FARTY O'COOL
Oh, I'd say we need about... Oh, two and a half tons of yer St. Patrick's Day Special.
STEVE
Two and a half tons...
FARTY O'COOL
Alright! Well, we'll see ya down at Farty O'Cools! [he leaves and Linda Black comes in]
LINDA BLACK
Are you crazy? How are we gonna get that much weed together in time?
STEVE
I don't know, babe, but this could really make our whole fiscal year!
LINDA BLACK
I just hope you're not overdoin' it again.
STEVE
Don't worry, we're gonna blow everyone's mind with our St. Patrick's Day Special!
[South Park Elementary, cafeteria, lunchtime. The boys are sitting with Jimmy and Tolkien and eating green hamburgers.]
CARTMAN
Awesome... green hamburgers... How clever...
STAN
[his phone rings and he answers] Hello?
RANDY
[an officer is watching him] Uh, yes, this is Randy Marsh, I've been incarcerated. I need to speak with my attorney.
STAN
Dad, it's me. You called the wrong person.
RANDY
Yes, I am aware of that. Listen to me carefully. The canary is in the cage.
STAN
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
RANDY
Oh, a confidential matter? Lawyer client privilege. Uh, you know, there's an officer standing right here, actually. [the officer rolls his eyes and leaves] Oh... Oh it's okay, he's stepping away. [whispering] Stan! They got me locked up, you're gonna have to help me break outta here. We have to stop them.
STAN
Stop who?
RANDY
Listen to me... is your friend Tolkien there?
STAN
Yeah, Tol-l-l-kien is sitting right here.
RANDY
Yeah, well, his piece a shit dad is trying to take over the St. Patrick's Day Special!
STAN
I don't care.
RANDY
You better care, because if we don't make money today you and sister are gonna starve. Do you understand? And I won't be able to pay the Wi-Fi bill.
STAN
Okay, what do you want me to do?
RANDY
I need you to leave school, go home, and get a jar of the St. Patrick's Day Special weed and sneak it into the police station.
STAN
Dad, it's St. Patrick's Day. We're gonna do a scavenger hunt at recess.
RANDY
I'm asking you to do one little thing. Ditch school, get weed, sneak into the police station. Do it or no more Wi-Fi, I mean it! [the officer comes back] Piece a shit lawyer! [he hangs up]
[A stained-glass window of Saint Patrick is shown.]
BUTTERS
[narrating] St. Patrick was not Irish. He was a Roman British man who was made a slave by Irish Barbarians. But St. Patrick heard the voice of God... and he used his situation for good, and God told him to be brave! [he's standing on the toilet, telling the story to the other detainees] And that is why... On this one day of the year, we must be like St. Patrick ourselves! [one of them farts] The police don't even care about St. Patrick's Day! Do you see any of them wearing green?! No! If we do St. Patrick's bidding, he will provide for us! [meanwhile, the officer from before brings Randy back to the cell]
OFFICER
Okay, back in you go. [he opens the door, pushes Randy in and closes it again]
BUTTERS
Pi-i-i-i-nch! [he pinches the officer's leg]
OFFICER
[screams in panic] Oh my God! Oh my God! [Johnson comes by] He just touched me and he didn't ask for consent or anything.
JOHNSON
Okay, okay, I'll take care of it... [he tases Butters, who passes out] Is that better?
OFFICER
I just need to take a shower and cry. Oh my God.
[The reception room. An officer is using his phone. The boys enter the station, with Cartman holding a cake.]
OFFICER
Can I help you?
CARTMAN
Hello, sir, we are with the Clover Club. We try to spread a little St. Patrick's Day cheer by donating baked goods to prison inmates who cannot celebrate this festive time. [the officer accompanies the boys to the cell room]
OFFICER
Alright, it's your lucky day, folks, some kids brought you some holiday cheer.
RANDY
Wha... Wha... What's happening?! What's happening?
STAN
Hey, there, we brought you a cake.
RANDY
I told you to bring me weed, not a cake!
STAN
[he pinches his nose, frustrated] God dammit. You... You should just enjoy the cake.
RANDY
You don't fucking listen to me, do you?! You're incapable of ever doing anything right because-- [he finally takes the hint] Oh, a cake. [he winks] Gooot it. Thank you very much. [the officer opens the cell door and Butters wakes up with the noise]
BUTTERS
Whu... Oh, hey, fellas.
CARTMAN
How's your St. Patrick's Day going, Butters?
BUTTERS
Pretty good.
CARTMAN
Awesome.
STAN
Well, see ya. [the boys leave and Randy takes a jar of his special from inside the cake]
BUTTERS
What are you gonna do?
RANDY
It's simple... There's always cops looking to make a score. You just gotta find the one willing to trade some drugs for a favor. [he makes a joint with the weed] And once they get a whiff of my St. Patrick's Day Special, they won't be able to resist. [he lights the joint and takes a drag] Oh... Oh, man, that is strong...
BUTTERS
I knew St. Patrick would perform a miracle to get us out of here! Just like when he was a slave, he will help us go free!
RANDY
White people were slaves in history? Nuh-uh. [he takes another drag] Gah, it's such a good special, it's just such a shame people are trying to ruin it. [he takes another drag, walks to Johnson, who's keeping guard, and blows the smoke on his face] Hey, my bruthuh. You got a second?
JOHNSON
What do you want?
RANDY
You don't wanna miss out on the only white holiday still allowed, do ya? How'd you like to be able to, uh, celebrate a little?
JOHNSON
Yeah, of course I would, but I can't.
OFFICER
Hey guys! How'd you like to be able to celebrate a little?! [he brings in a box of the Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special] Check it out! They're handing out free weed down at Farty O'Cools! It's the Credigree St. Patrick's Day Special! [the other officers join him and start smoking]
OFFICERS
Wow!
JOHNSON
Ooh, hey, I'm in. [he joins them too]
RANDY
No!
OFFICER
Ooh da lolly!
OFFICER
St. Patrick's Day! Wow, look at it!
OFFICER
I thought I wouldn't be able to get wasted till later!
RANDY
[he sits on the toilet, defeated] That's it. It's over. My plan is done.
BUTTERS
It is not over! What did St. Patrick say when he was taken from his homeland and turned into a slave?! St. Patrick didn't give up! And when the Christians slandered him while he was trying to convert the heathen Irish, did he give up then?! [Randy ignores him and rushes to the bars in anger]
OFFICER
Man, that is strong ass shit.
OFFICER
You can taste the Irishness. [Randy gets angrier]
OFFICER
This weed is amazing and it has so much cred.
OFFICER
You know, I've never really been a fan of the holiday Specials, but this one is really good. [Randy gets so angry that suddenly sparkles comes from him and he forces the cell door open]
BUTTERS
Yeah!
OFFICERS
[they notice Randy] Whoa!
BUTTERS
You see?! The power of St. Patrick compels you! [Randy fires rainbows from his hands, blasting the officers away]
OFFICERS
Oh! Whoa! Aah! Aah!
BUTTERS
Yes, now use your clover rays! [Randy fires his clover rays on another two officers, sending them spinning away]
OFFICERS
Oh! Ugugghghh! Whoa!
RANDY
Me golden coins of spite! [he tosses golden coins on the remaining officers, knocking them down]
OFFICERS
Oh! Oh! [with all the officers down, Randy and Butters exit the station]
[The Jamaican style logo shows up again. "The Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special". And again, the announcer is heard.]
ANNOUNCER
And now for the thrilling conclusion of the Credigree St. Patrick's Day Special.
[The scene cuts to the Farty O'Cool's Irish Pub, nighttime. Irish folk music is playing. There are a lot of people outside and inside, where Steve and Linda are selling their special.]
LINDA BLACK
My God! I never thought we'd sell this much weed!
STEVE
Keep it up, babe! We've still got a long way to go!
PATRON
Hey, everyone! Everyone! Everyone, quiet! Turn up the TV! [everyone stays quiet and Farty O' Cool turns up the TV's volume]
TOM
Once again the town of South Park is on high alert after a sexual predator escaped from custody. Everyone who's out at bars or restaurants for St. Patrick's Day need to be on the lookout for the sexual psychopath. [the scene cuts to Bill]
BILL
Tom, I'm standing outside the South Park Police Station, where just moments ago a sexual predator broke free. [footage of Randy and Butters escaping the jail is shown, with Butters being highlighted] Surveillance cameras inside the station captured the dramatic escape. [back to Bill] Police claim they tried to stop the felon from escaping, but they were just, "Way too high." Back to you, Tom.
[Tegridy Farms. Towelie's still by the booth, smoking with the pipe.]
TOWELIE
[singing] I've been a wild rover for many's the year, I've spent all me money on good weed and beer [suddenly, a police car stops by, and Randy and Butters come out of it]
RANDY
Towelie... where is all the St. Patrick's Day Special?
TOWELIE
Randy... I... I thought... you were in jail.
RANDY
The weed's all gone, does that mean you were able to sell it?
TOWELIE
Yeah I sort of... sold it... at half price... to Tolkien's dad across the street.
RANDY
What?!
TOWELIE
You were gone! Tolkien's dad said he'd buy all the weed and I figured that's what we should do!
RANDY
So you mean that right now everyone down at the Irish bar is enjoying my special and they don't even know it?!
TOWELIE
Randy, I'm sorr-- [Randy grabs Towelie, crumbles him and throws him on the ground]
RANDY
Come on, let's go! [he and Butters go back to the car]
[The scene cuts again to the Farty O'Cool's Irish Pub, where the Blacks are still selling their special.]
STEVE
Thank you! Thank you! Thanks for choosing Credigree Weed!
RANDY
Stop right there, you piece a shit! [music and chatter stop] Is everyone enjoying the special?!
STEVE
Randy... I-I thought you were in jail.
RANDY
Oh, yes, so did a lot of people. But you see there's just one thing wrong. [he takes the jar from one of the patrons] This isn't Credigree Weed's special. [he rips off the Credigree Weed label from the jar, revealing his own underneath] It's moine. [everyone gasps]
LINDA BLACK
Babe! That's how you got so much weed?!
STEVE
I used both.
RANDY
You see?! This is what happens when you appropriate a culture! It's sort of your special and it's sort of not your special... And nobody knows whose special it is.
STEVE
I guess I just let the holiday go to my head. But I learned that--
RANDY
No! No no no no no! You don't get to say what you learned 'cause it's not your special! This holiday is about Tegridy.
WOMAN
Oh my God! It's him! It's the sexual predator! [Butters gets nervous]
STEVENS
[smoking weed] What, what, he's here?!
BUTTERS
Uh oh! [he flees]
STEVENS
[he draws his gun] Stop right there!
[Butters runs outside, screaming. Stevens runs after him and start shooting. Butters runs to the streets, but two police cars close on him and he runs to the opposite direction. Three officers exit from the car and point their guns at him.]
OFFICER
There he is, get him!
BUTTERS
Wahggh! [he notices other two cars, with Yates and other two officers pointing their guns at him]
YATES
[he cocks his gun] Freeze!
BUTTERS
Ahghggh! [he's now surrounded]
YATES
Don't move, Weinstein, you've got nowhere else to go! [suddenly, a green glows emerges from the sky]
SAINT PATRICK
[from above] Leave the child alone... [everyone looks at the glow descending on the street and taking the form of Saint Patrick]
EVERYONE
Ohh!
RANDY
Whoa-a-a!
BUTTERS
It's him! It's St. Patrick!
SAINT PATRICK
What... exactly is going on here. You've persecuted this little boy for grabbing people? Why, it's ridiculous! You've all besmirched a perfectly good white holiday. Where we all like to get drunk and assault each other! It's St. Patrick's Day! [he pinches a woman's butt] Remember the reason for the season! [he grabs another woman's breast and humps a third woman]
WOMAN
Oh, my God!
WOMAN
Ooh! Hey!
SAINT PATRICK
Who wants a pinch? [he grabs another woman's breast] Oh, yes, very nice!
MAN
Hey, you can't do that, man!
SAINT PATRICK
[he fills a cup with booze for himself] What do you mean I can't? Do you know what day it is?! [he approaches a woman wearing a blouse with "Kiss me I'm Irish" written on it] Ah, see, here we go. "Kiss me I'm Irish!" That's more like it! [he licks her butt, wriggling his tongue]
WOMAN
Oh, my God! [she runs off]
SAINT PATRICK
No, you bought the shirt, bitch! [he approaches two men] Come on, let's have a go! It's me day! Take your dick out. [he puts his hand on one of the men's crotch] Who wants him to take his dick out?
MAN
I will not!
SAINT PATRICK
What is this? Are you people all some kind of Scottish poofters?
MAN
Hey, that is a homophobic slur!
SAINT PATRICK
You're calling me homophobic? Because I will gladly fuck any man here. We celebrate St. Patrick's Day for four simple reasons. I. Love. To. Fuck.
MAN
Wow, St. Patrick, wow. You're a real jerk.
WOMAN
Yeah, what a creep. Come on girls, let's go. [they leave]
MAN
To hell with him and to hell with this Tegridy Weed St. Patrick's Day Special. [he tosses his Tegridy Weed jar on the ground and leaves, disgusted]
RANDY
[everyone else does the same] Aw... Aww!
SAINT PATRICK
Where is everybody going? This party fucking sucks! Doesn't anybody want a pinch?
[South Park, daytime. A street sweeper cleans all the mess left by the partying last night. It runs over an unconscious guy as well.]
TOM
[narrating] The party is over... A new day has come... [the scene cuts to him] And now... St. Patrick's Day, the only holiday left where white people could celebrate a culture... has been cancelled. And as for the mysterious, sexually charged being who groped and assaulted so many. He... is doing five years community service.
[The scene cuts to Butters, who's picking trash on the street as part of his community service. He doesn't look happy.]
BUTTERS
Once again... I shoulda never listened to what they told me in church.
End of Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special
