script:Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus

[South Park.]
ANNOUNCER 1
Since the last South Park, you've waited four long weeks to find out who the father of Eric Cartman is. Now, finally, the shocking truth about Cartman's lineage... will not be seen tonight, so that we can bring you the following special presentation.
[SPECIAL PRESENTATION
APRIL FOOLS
[A kazoo is heard.]']
ANNOUNCER 2
[Theme music plays.] Now, get ready for Canada's hottest action stars,
[Terrance and Phillip appear in turn.]
ANNOUNCER 2
Terrance and Phillip in HBC's Movie of the Week:
[The title comes into view and a heavy bass thump is heard.]
ANNOUNCER 2
Not Without My Anus. Based on a true story.
[Canadian Courthouse 10:18 A.M. Dramatic music plays as the camera zooms in on the courthouse.]
SCOTT THE DICK
Ladies and gentlemen, the case before you today is of a murderer. On the night in question, this monster entered the home of Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer and struck him repeatedly on the head with his hammer.
[He demonstrates this]
SCOTT
That monster is sitting right over there, and his name is Terrance!
[Suspenseful notes play. Terrance farts and both he and Phillip laugh about it.]
PHILLIP
Oh, Terrance, You farted in court.
TERRANCE
Yes, Phillip. I'm making a case for our defense. [They laugh again.]
SCOTT
[Approaching the displays.] All of these things link Terrance to the murder: hair fibers, blood samples, nail clippings, a piece of his shirt,
[A hole is seen on the left shoulder of Terrance's shirt. He quickly puts his right hand over it and looks around nervously.]
SCOTT
a watch with his initials on it, a day planner with the murder scheduled, a haiku called, Time to Kill Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer.
"Dr. O'Dwyer
Time to have your head smashed in
with my new hammer."
[Terrance is aghast at the mountain of evidence against him..]
SCOTT
Terrance, you may be a famous surgeon, but you're not God. J'accuse, Terrance.
TERRANCE
Would you like a monkey claw, Phillip?
PHILLIP
Yes, please.
[Terrance farts and has the jury laughing.]
TERRANCE
That's called the monkey claw because it feels like my colon is being ripped apart by a thousand monkeys.
PHILLIP
The monkey claw is smelly.
JUDGE
[Bangs his gavels twice.] Come on, get a move on. I ain't gettin' any younger up here.
PHILLIP
My sentiments exactly, Your Honor. I see from your actions that you're southern Canadian.
JUDGE
That is correct.
PHILLIP
Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is an innocent man. [Farts.]
TERRANCE
Oh, Phillip, now you farted during the closing argument.
PHILLIP
I have, haven't I, Terrance?
[He farts again. The jurors and Terrance laugh.]
SCOTT
Your Honor, the defense is trying to make a mockery of this court! They think that farts are funny, but they're not! [Thumps the table.]
JUDGE
[Gavels] Sustained.
PHILLIP
Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is no more a murderer than you or me. He loves puppies and hates mean things. Would a murderer go to the zoo and feed animals like this?
[Shows a picture of Terrance feeding a llama. The jury is silent.]
PHILLIP
Of course not. So in summation, find Terrance innocent. Or else he'll kill you.
[The jury gasps softly. Terrance and Phillip laugh.]
PHILLIP
Just kidding.
[Terrance is laughing so hard he thumps the table twice.]
PHILLIP
The defense rests.
[Phillip returns to his table, farting on Scott on the way over. The jurors and audience laugh.]
SCOTT
Goddammit! That isn't funny!
JUDGE
Madame Foreperson, have you reached a verdict so we can get the hell outta here?
MADAME FOREPERSON
We have, Your Honor. We have found Terrance, in the above entitled action of murder against Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer--
[Terrance farts, then laughs. Phillip joins in.]
JUDGE
You're gonna have to repeat that verdict because we have some flatulence issues.
MADAME FOREPERSON
I said, we find--
[Terrance farts.]
MADAME FOREPERSON
We find Terrance--
[Terrance and Phillip fart.]
MADAME FOREPERSON
Not guilty!!
PHILLIP
Did you hear that, Terrance? You're not guilty.
TERRANCE
Oh, Phillip, you saved me from the gas chamber.
[They look at each other for a moment, and laugh.]
[Outside the courthouse. Terrance and Phillip descend the steps, which are lined with news crews ready to interrogate anyone who wants to talk.]
TERRANCE
That sure was fun, Phillip. Let's go home and eat Kraft Dinner.
PHILLIP
Hear hear.
SCOTT
[Coming over.] Well, looks like you got away with it, Terrance and Phillip!
PHILLIP
Oh, hello, Scott. No hard feelings, right, old pal?
SCOTT
There are hard feelings! This isn't over. I'm going ta see to it that you both pay for what you've done. And do you know why?
PHILLIP
'Cause you're a dick?
SCOTT
No, Because I hate you. You think farting is so funny. Well, it isn't!! Fart jokes are the lowest form of comedy, and if I--
[Phillip farts; he and Terrance laugh.]
SCOTT
Ugh! I hate you both! I've hated you ever since I could remember! I hate you, and I wish you both had cancer.
[The laughter stops quick.]
PHILLIP
Cancer?
SCOTT
Yes. In the head.
TERRANCE
Head cancer?
SCOTT
This is not the end, Terrance and Phillip! You'll rue this day! [Leaves.]
TERRANCE
Wow, Scott really hates us, Phillip.
PHILLIP
Yes, perhaps he's homophobic.
TERRANCE
[Wondering.] But we're not gay, Phillip.
PHILLIP
We're not? [The news crews leave.]
TERRANCE
Well, let us board the subway and return home. There we can eat Kraft Dinner.
PHILLIP
Yes. It's been a long day, and only Kraft Dinner can calm my nerves.
[On the subway, Terrance and Phillip are alone. Phillip farts, and they both laugh.]
TERRANCE
Say, Phillip, why does Scott always try to convict me of murder? He does it every week.
PHILLIP
He sure does seem to hate us. I wonder what he'll try to do next.
TERRANCE
God only knows.
PHILLIP
The subway certainly is wonderful, Terrance.
TERRANCE
It sure is. Let's look for treasure.
PHILLIP
Yes, let's look for treasure.
[This is a luxurious subway. There are compartments between the seats into which one may put belongings and such. Terrance opens the compartment to his left, and Phillip the one to his right. Phillip then opens the one to his left and they both look in.]
[Scott's House 11:57 A.M. The phone rings and Scott answers.]
SCOTT
Hello?
VOICE
Hello, Is this Scott, from Canada?
SCOTT
Yess, yes it is.
VOICE
You're a Journalist, right?
SCOTT
Yes. I'm a television critic for a magazine.
VOICE
I understand that you hate Terrance and Phillip.
[The voice is in a dark room, seated in a high-backed chair, turned away from the camera.]
SCOTT
Yes! Yes I do! They think that fart jokes are a sophisticated form of comedy, but they're not!
VOICE
Well, what about I help you get rid of them once and for all?
SCOTT
Who is this?
VOICE
Let's just say that I'm someone who can help you, if you help me.
[The chair swivels 'round and a familiar face appears...]
VOICE
Just call me your old pal, Saddam Hussein.
SCOTT
[Surprised.] Saddam Hussein? The Iraqi dictator?
[A Republican Guard stands at either side of Saddam.]
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Eey, relax guy. I'm just your average Joe. Take a rest.
SCOTT
What do you want?
SADDAM
You want Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, I want you to bring me and my friends in to Canada. That sounds like a fair trade, doesn't it? Super! Let's get started.
SCOTT
I'm not sure I should trust you.
SADDAM
Eeeeeeyy, relax guy! Trust me!
[Saddam grins. Scott looks uncertain.]
[Terrance and Phillip reach home.]
TERRANCE
Well. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip.
[Someone approaches.]
PHILLIP
Oh. Hello, Ugly Bob.
UGLY BOB
Hello, Terrance. Hello, Phillip.
TERRANCE
My God, you're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob.
UGLY BOB
How can you guys say stuff like that?
TERRANCE
Because you're God-damned ugly, Bob.
UGLY BOB
I know, but--
PHILLIP
Ugly Bob, your face looks like somebody tried to put out a forest fire with a screwdriver.
UGLY BOB
I can't help how I look. Besides, it's not what on the outside that matters, it's what's on the inside.
TERRANCE
No it isn't. [They laugh.] Wanna see what's on the inside of me?
[Terrance farts. They laugh about it. Bob is unfazed.]
PHILLIP
Wait wait. I've got an idea. Why don't you put this paper bag over your head, Ugly Bob?
TERRANCE
Yes.
[Phillip slips the bag over Bob's head.]
TERRANCE
If people can't see your face, they won't know how wretchedly ugly you are.
UGLY BOB
Really? Hey, thanks, you guys. Maybe now I can score with chicks.
TERRANCE
Sure you can, Ugly Bob. If they can't see how horribly disfigured you are, they'll want to sleep with you.
UGLY BOB
Thanks, you guys.
[They part ways.]
[Terrance and Phillip's House 12:20 P.M.]
PHILLIP
Hello Barky. Hello Purry.
BARKY
Bark, bark.
PURRY
Purr, purr.
PHILLIP
Say Terrance, I was just aboot to make some Kraft Dinner. Would you like some?
TERRANCE
You know I never turn down Kraft Dinner, Phillip.
[Terrance farts. He and the animals laugh.]
TERRANCE
I'm going to put on a pirate costume.
[Terrance goes to his room. The door bell rings. Phillip opens the door.]
DELIVERY MAN
Special delivery for Terrance.
[He smokes a pipe. The delivery is a letter.]
PHILLIP
I'll take that.
DELIVERY MAN
Sign here, and here, and here, and here, and here. [Signs all the forms.] And here. [Signs the last one.]
PHILLIP
Ooh, Terrannce! [The delivery man leaves.] You got a letter!
TERRANCE
[Now dressed as a pirate.] Shiver me timbers, Phillip. At this rate I'll never get to my Kraft Dinner. [Reads the letter.] Oh my God!
PHILLIP
What is it, Terrance? Did you fart?
TERRANCE
No! It's Sally. She's being held captive in Iran.
PHILLIP
Not Sally! Dear God, no, Terrance! Why Sally? God, why? Say, Terrance, who's Sally?
TERRANCE
My daughter.
PHILLIP
I never know you had a daughter, Terrance.
TERRANCE
Oh, yes. Didn't I mention that, me hearty?
PHILLIP
No, you never did, Terrance.
TERRANCE
Oh. Well. It all began fifteen years ago.
[44 HOURS LATER...]
PHILLIP
My God, what a fascinating story, Terrance. Especially the part aboot Celine Dion.
TERRANCE
Yes, indeed. [Takes off the hat.] But now my little Sally is being held captive in Iran. [Takes off the eye patch.] And I will have to go and find her.
PHILLIP
Then I'll go with you, Terrance.
TERRANCE
You're such a good friend, Phillip.
PHILLIP
Well, you know what they say: A friend in need is a friend with Kroff Dinner.
TERRANCE
Avast there, mateys.
[Celine Dion's House 1:15 P.M. Terrance arrives and rings the doorbell.]
TERRANCE
Hello, Celine Dion.
CELINE DION
Terrance, this is quite a surprise.
TERRANCE
You're looking well.
CELINE DION
And you.
TERRANCE
Celine, where is our daughter, Sally?
CELINE DION
She's in the Middle East, studying anthropology. Why?
TERRANCE
Wrong. She's been taken hostage, and is now being held prisoner.
CELINE DION
What?!
TERRANCE
Phillip and I are going to Iran to find her, but we may never return.
CELINE DION
[Gasps.] Oh, Terrance. What happened to us?
TERRANCE
We just grew apart, Celine Dion. [He turns to leave.]
CELINE DION
Please, bring our daughter home safe, Terrance.
[He farts and they both laugh.]
[Canadian Airport 11:05 A.M. Terrance and Phillip are there to purchase tickets to Iran.]
PHILLIP
Hello, Ugly Bob.
UGLY BOB
Hi, guys.
TERRANCE
How's the paper bag working out?
UGLY BOB
People seem to really like it. I even have a date this Friday.
TERRANCE
Terrific! We need two tickets for Tehran, please.
UGLY BOB
Tehran is dangerous. You guys shouldn't go there!
PHILLIP
Dammit man! [Bangs on the counter.] Danger or no, I'm going to help my friend find his daughter!!
[Terrance laughs nervously.]
UGLY BOB
All right, then. There's a flight leaving today.
PHILLIP
Oh good. Well, I certainly am going to miss Canada, Terrance.
TERRANCE
In-deed, Phillip.
PHILLIP
Terrance, if I die whilst in Iran, please bring my body back to Canada, and bury me in a box with a side of Kroff Dinner.
TERRANCE
Same here, Phillip!
PHILLIP
O Ca-nada,
Our home and native land,
TERRANCE/PHILLIP
True patriot love,
In all thy sons' command,
SMALL GROUP
[Terrance, Phillip, Ugly Bob, and two others]
With glowing hearts we see thee rise,
MIDDLING GROUP
[Four more...]
The True North, strong and free
LARGER GROUP
[The folks at the kiosk join in.]
From far and wide, O Canada,
We stand on guard for thee,
CROWD
God keep our land...
[Scott peeks out from behind a corner, talking to Saddam on a cell phone.]
SCOTT
Scott to Red Dragon, come in, Red Dragon.
SADDAM
Go ahead, guy. This is Red Dragon.
SCOTT
The plan is working perfectly. Terrance and Phillip have taken the bait.
SADDAM
Excellent! My buddies and I are ready to come to Canada. Has everything been arranged?
SCOTT
Yes. Everything's proceeding according to plan. Now you promised that when Terrance and Phillip arrive they'll be ripped into pieces and shot several times.
SADDAM
Hey, relax, guy. I'm gonna keep my side of the bargain.
SCOTT
Roger, Red Dragon. Scott out.
[He puts the phone away.]
SCOTT
[To himself.] I've got you now, you fart-lovin' fart-lovers.
[On the flight to Tehran, Terrance and Phillip leave British Columbia, fly over the western and southwestern U.S., and over the Gulf of Mexico. Over the Yucatan Peninsula Terrance farts, they laugh, and the plane turns towards the Atlantic.]
TERRANCE
I Got Ya.
[They laugh again. Over the Pyrenees, Phillip farts, the plane moves towards North Africa, then turns again for Italy.]
PHILLIP
Burned your face.
[The plane heads for Egypt, where another fart forces it towards the Black Sea. Once they cross it, another fart forces the plane to cross the Black Sea again...]
TERRANCE
Ow, that's rancid. Hahahahaha.
[It then turns towards Iran when it is in southern Turkey. It lands in...]
[Tehran 2:30 P.M. Terrance and Phillip walk among the crowds in the city.]
TERRANCE
Oh, Phillip. How will we ever find my fugitive daughter in this daunting place? We don't speak the language, we are unwelcome strangers, and we have no idea where to begin.
PHILLIP
Oh, look. There she is.
[He points at a girl wearing a yellow dress and pink bow - not Arab dress in the least.]
TERRANCE
Oh, good.
[They make their way to her.]
SALLY
Goo. Where?
TERRANCE
I'm here, Sally. It's your father, Terrance.
[He picks her up in his arms.]
TERRANCE
I'm here to save you from your smelly Arabian captors.
SALLY
Pa-pa.
PHILLIP
Say, she looks a lot more like Celine Dion than you, Terrance.
[Sally farts.]
PHILLIP
Oh, now I see the resemblance!
TERRANCE
Well, enough of Iran, let's get home.
[On the flight home she farts again and Terrance and Phillip laugh.]
[Canadian Airport 3:45 P.M. The plane lands.]
TERRANCE
Well, now that I have my bastard daughter back, I feel like going to Celine Dion's house and asking her to marry me again.
PHILLIP
Oh, raspberries, looks like I'm losing a friend.
TERRANCE
No, you're gaining a pop vocalist.
[Phillip notices something.]
PHILLIP
Oh my God! [Terrance looks.] What is this?!
[There are pictures of Saddam Hussein plastered all over the city, and ominous music plays.]
PHILLIP
Is this Canada?
TERRANCE
It seems to have changed.
PHILLIP
This is madness!
TERRANCE
What's going on, Phillip? How can Canada have changed so much whilst we were gone?
PHILLIP
I don't know, Terrance. And who is that smelly person in all these pictures?
TERRANCE
I must take my bastard daughter back to Celine Dion and see what she has to say.
[Celine Dion's House 4:02 P.M. Terrance and Phillip arrive with Sally. Terrance knocks, and Celine opens the door.]
TERRANCE
Celine, I brought our daughter Sally back, and I want to tell you that--
CELINE DION
Terrance, ha, could you come back a little later?
TERRANCE
Why?!
CELINE DION
Ah, I'm just a little busy right now.
TERRANCE
You've got a man over, don't you, Celine Dion?
CELINE DION
Well, I...
[Ugly Bob comes out behind her.]
UGLY BOB
Hi guys.
PHILLIP
Oh my God, it's Ugly Bob!!
TERRANCE
What the hell are you doing here?!
UGLY BOB
I'm doing Celine Dion; what's it look like?
TERRANCE
Oh, Celine Dion, what have you done? I was going to make us a family again, but now you've slept with Ugly Bob!
CELINE DION
What do you mean? Why are you calling him "Ugly Bob"?
PHILLIP
Because that's his name, you stupid bitch!
[She turns to Ugly Bob.]
CELINE DION
You told me your name "Handsome Bob"!
TERRANCE
Look at him, Celine Dion.
[Terrance pulls the bag off.]
CELINE DION
Aaaaaaaaaaaagggggghhhhh!!!
PHILLIP
Behold his horrible face.
CELINE DION
Oh my God, he's hideously ugly! And I am pregnant with his child!
TERRANCE
What?! Nooooooooooooooooo!!
CELINE DION
I'm going to have a freak baby!!
PHILLIP
Ohh, the humanity!!
[Saddam Hussein's Canadian HQ. 4:03 P.M. Scott enters the cabin.]
SCOTT
Hey, Saddam. You helped me get rid of Terrance and Phillip, and I appreciate that, but why are framed pictures of you going up all over Canada?
SADDAM
Huh? Oh that? Don't worry, guy, you just need a rest.
SCOTT
...No I don't need a rest!! I want to know what this is all aboot.
SADDAM
Hey, relax, fella. I'm just making it so that Terrance and Phillip can never come back to Canada again. I just need a couple of days, and then I'm gonna head back to Iran.
SCOTT
I thought you were from Iraq.
SADDAM
Iran, Iraq, what the hell's the difference? Relax, guy!
[Downtown Canada 4:04 P.M. Saddam's troops are filing past the buildings as Terrance and Phillip look on. Terrance farts and the two laugh.]
TERRANCE
Phillip, I'm convinced that something very very not good is happening to Canada.
PHILLIP
Yes. I agree whole-fartedly.
[They laugh. Scott rushes up to them.]
SCOTT
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?
TERRANCE
Oh, hello, Scott.
SCOTT
You're not supposed to be here, you're supposed to be in Iran looking for your kidnapped--
[Puts left hand to mouth.]
SCOTT
Ah, I mean, how are you guys today?
PHILLIP
Wait, what were you saying?
SCOTT
Nothing, why?
TERRANCE
Hey, Scott. Guess what?
SCOTT
What?
[Terrance farts and they laugh.]
SCOTT
Aargh! I hate you more than ever, Terrance and Phillip! I absolutely abhor you both!
[He then puts his fists forth and concentrates mightily on them. They simply stand back.]
PHILLIP
What are you doing, Scott?
SCOTT
I'm wishing cancer upon you.
PHILLIP
Cancer?!
SCOTT
That's right. I'm trying to give you cancer with my mind.
TERRANCE
Ooh, stop that!
[He grabs Phillip as a shield, then pulls him back.]
PHILLIP
Hey, don't give me cancer!
[Scott advances.]
[Saddam Hussein's Canadian HQ. 4:05 P.M. Two U.S. Army Officials arrive.]
U.S. ARMY OFFICIAL
Mr. Hussein, the U.S. Government is becoming worried.
SADDAM
Worried? Aboot what? Take a load off, relax.
U.S. ARMY OFFICIAL
You seem to be... taking over Canada.
SADDAM
Taking over Canada? Me? Eeeyy, you need a rest, fella. I'm not hiding any bombs.
U.S. ARMY OFFICIAL
We didn't say anything about bombs.
SADDAM
Oh. You didn't? Hey, relax.
U.S. ARMY OFFICIAL
We're giving you just three years to clear your forces out of Canada, and after that, we're gonna bomb all of Iran.
SADDAM
I'm from Iraq.
U.S. ARMY OFFICIAL
Iran, Iraq, what's the difference?
[The officials leave.]
GUARD ON RIGHT
Euugh. I hate Americans. Please, let me kill them!
SADDAM
No, no. You need to relax, guy. Remember the plan: first we take over Canada, then we'll have to go after the female pop vocalist. After that, we'll take over the U.S., then Europe, then China, then Newfoundland, then the world!
[He laughs wickedly and rolls all over his desk.]
SCOTT
[Returning.] What's so funny!
SADDAM
Nothing! Relax, brother.
SCOTT
Saddam, Terrance and Phillip are back in Canada!
SADDAM
Oh, really?
SCOTT
You promised me they'd be gone for good! That was your part of the bargain!
SADDAM
[Thumps his desk.] I changed my mind. [Thumps his desk again.] Pray that I don't change it any further.
[The guard on the right cocks his machine gun and Scott is chagrined.]
SCOTT
This deal's getting worse all the time.
[Terrance and Phillip's House 4:06 P.M. They are at home eating Kroff Dinner on the sofa.]
PHILLIP
Hey, Terrance, let's watch American television.
TERRANCE
Yes. We can get satellite feed from the U.S. and watch all their stupid T.V. shows.
PHILLIP
Oh look. Here's a show. [Jerry Springer.]
WOMAN 1
...well fuck you.
WOMAN 2
Arrrggghh! [Lunges at woman 1.]
SPRINGER
And this is what life would be like...
TERRANCE
It's so stupid!
PHILLIP
Goddamn, their TV shows are lame!
[The next show they see is South Park.]
MEPHESTO
The father of Eric Cartman is indeed, someone in this room. The father is--
[Terrance and Phillip laugh over the line.]
PHILLIP
Look at their silly American heads.
TERRANCE
They look like groundhogs.
CARTMAN
He's my father?!
[Phillip clicks a new channel.]
ANCHOR
And in other news it appears that Saddam Hussein has finally signed an agreement to let the U.S. inspect his military operations. When asked if he would uphold his side of the agreement, Hussein replied, quote: "Hey, relax, fella. You need a rest, guy."
TERRANCE
Hey, Phillip. Isn't that the smelly gentleman we've seen in pictures all over town?
PHILLIP
Yes it is, Terrance. According to that newsie, he's some kind of Turkish dictator.
TERRANCE
Well, we just can't sit here and eat Kroff Dinner and let Canada be overrun by the Turks!
[The phone rings, and they laugh.]
PHILLIP
That fart sounded like a ringing phone, Terrance.
TERRANCE
It sure did, Phillip.
[The phone rings again, and Terrance looks.]
TERRANCE
Oh, wait. That is the phone.
[He sets his plate aside and gets up to answer it.]
TERRANCE
Hello?
SCOTT
Terrance, this is Scott.
TERRANCE
Oh. [To Phillip.] Hey, it's Scott.
[He covers the receiver while Phillip answers.]
PHILLIP
Tell him he's a smelly bastard.
TERRANCE
Phillip says hello, Scott.
SCOTT
Just shut up and listen. You've unleashed a monster onto Canada! And only you can get rid of him, even though I hate you, and I wish you had cancer.
TERRANCE
You are such a dick, Scott.
SCOTT
You're a dick.
TERRANCE
You're a dick.
SCOTT
You're a dick.
TERRANCE
You're a dick.
SCOTT
You're a dick.
TERRANCE
You're a dick.
SCOTT
[Pause.] You're a dick.
TERRANCE
You're a dick.
SCOTT
The two of you are the most annoying dicks in Canada. You give other Canadians a bad name. And if I had my hair-
TERRANCE
I'm sorry, Scott. Could you hold on a minute?
SCOTT
Sure.
[Terrance raises his left leg, places the receiver between his legs, and farts on it. He and Phillip laugh as he lowers his leg.]
TERRANCE
How do you like that, Scott?!
SCOTT
You son of a bitch! I'll get you if it's the last thin--
TERRANCE
Oh wait, I have another call on, Scott. Can you hold on?
SCOTT
Sure.
[Terrance raises his left leg, places the receiver between his legs, and farts on it. He lowers his leg and resumes talking.]
TERRANCE
Oh, that was Sir Smelly. He says 'hello.'
SCOTT
Goddammit!
TERRANCE
Oh, wait a second, Scott.
SCOTT
Sure.
[Terrance raises his left leg...]
SCOTT
I mean, no! You listen to me! If you want to save Canada, you'll meet me at Karl's Kroff Dinner Restaurant in half an hour. [Hangs up.]
[Celine Dion's House 4:07 P.M. Celine Dion and Ugly Bob are back in bed.]
CELINE DION
Oh, Ugly Bob, I'm so confused. I love your personality, but you are so wretchedly ugly.
[She puffs on a cigarette.]
UGLY BOB
Maybe the baby will have your face instead of mine.
CELINE DION
We can only hope. I suppose we'll be okay as long as you keep that bag on your head.
[Three Republican Guards burst through the bedroom door, and Saddam follows.]
CELINE DION
What's this?! [Gasps.]
SADDAM
He-yy there. I'm Saddam Hussein. I'm a big fan of Polo. I've been searching a long time for you, Celine Dion.
UGLY BOB
Oh no, you don't. She's my bitch.
SADDAM
Eh! Who are you?
UGLY BOB
I'm Bob. But my friends call me "Ugly Bob", because I have the features of a deformed burn victim.
SADDAM
Really? I thought all Canadians looked alike. Let me see.
[Bob takes off the bag and everybody in the room screams.]
SADDAM
Well, I'm sorry, guy. You know, I could cure that face of yours.
[Bob and Celine now look at him.]
UGLY BOB
You can?
SADDAM
Sure! I just need a favor. There is a Canadian football game tomorrow: the Ottawa Roughriders vs. the Vancouver Roughriders. It is at that game that I will officially turn the Canadian flag over to my Iranian one.
CELINE DION
What? Why?
SADDAM
Hey! Don't worry about that. Take a load off, don't worry about it. Look over here. All I need is for Celine Dion to sing our Iranian national anthem at the game - to finalize my hostile takeover of Canada. What do you say?
UGLY BOB
Did you say, "hostile takeover of Canada"?
SADDAM
No, no, relax there, fella!
[Celine takes another bag and places it over Bob's head.]
[Karl's Kroff Dinner Palace 4:36 P.M. Terrance and Phillip are there. So are some pictures of Saddam.]
TERRANCE
Well, Scott said to meet him here, but he's not showing up.
[Phillip farts and they laugh.]
PHILLIP
Well, while we're waiting, why don't we search for treasure?
TERRANCE
Oh. Good idea. Let's search for treasure.
[Phillip looks around, but Terrance ends up looking at his feet.]
SCOTT
[Arrives.] What are you idiots doing?
TERRANCE
We're looking for treasure!
SCOTT
Is that some kind of metaphor for a kind of search that can't be described?
PHILLIP
No, we're searching for treasure.
SCOTT
Listen. I have an inside scoop. There's an Iraqi dictator who is quietly and slowly taking over Canada.
TERRANCE
Yes. You mean Saddam Smelly. We saw him on the telly.
SCOTT
Well, what are you two gonna do aboat it?
PHILLIP
What do you mean?
SCOTT
It's your fault that he's here! You brought the Iraqis back with you on your plane when you rescued your kidnapped daughter! [they gasp.]
PHILLIP
You mean, we are to blame?!
SCOTT
That's right. And now you must make amends. Tomorrow, Saddam will try to finalize his takeover of Canada, at the Roughriders-Roughriders football game. It will be your only shot at wiping them all out. Here, take this.
[He hands him a box with a watch face on it.]
PHILLIP
What is this?
SCOTT
It's a bomb. You must strap it to yourselves, go to the game, and sacrifice your lives to take out Saddam's minions.
TERRANCE
That plan's scary!
SCOTT
Well, you must do it for Canada.
PHILLIP
For Canada, Terrance.
[A display of solidarity begins. He puts his arm behind Terrance.]
TERRANCE
For Canada, Phillip.
[Terrance puts his arm behind Phillip. Then they let go and leave.]
SCOTT
Yes, Terrance and Phillip. And when the dust is settled, Canada will be rid of both: the Iraqis and your immature fart humor.
[Terrance and Phillip's House 12:20 P.M.]
TERRANCE
Well. Phillip, I am very sad that we have to die for Canada.
PHILLIP
Yes. This bomb will blow us both to smithereens. But we really have no choice. Only our deaths can bring Canada life.
[Terrance farts, and they laugh.]
TERRANCE
That's funny!
PHILLIP
Hey! Wait a minute. That fart gives me pause.
TERRANCE
Why is that?
PHILLIP
That smelly Saddam Hussein. He uses germ and chemical warfare, does he not?
TERRANCE
Yes. Apparently, he does.
PHILLIP
Terrance! Get the phone book! We must call every Canadian we can!
TERRANCE
Oh, Phillip. It sounds like you have an idea.
PHILLIP
I do, Terrance.
[Phillip picks up the receiver and dials away... Barky comes up and farts, then leaves. Terrance and Phillip laugh.]
[Canada Stadium 11:32 A.M.]
ANNOUNCER
And the Roughriders are giving the Roughriders a run for their money! [Not if the score is valid: 28-7.] All else aside, I must say that the Roughriders [To his right.] are simply outmatched by these Roughriders [To his left. Red and blue Roughriders go after the football and time runs out. A horn blows and the referee blows his whistle.] And that's going to take us to halftime. Be sure to stick around for the halftime show: Saddam and the Electric Iraqis in a salute to hostile takeovers!
[A long platform is put together from two shorter ones, each one having half the Canadian flag. The flag is made whole when the platforms are put together. A band plays and walks across the field and the crowd cheers.]
TERRANCE
Well, I guess it's time, old friend.
PHILLIP
Yes. Prepare the alert!
[Saddam climbs onto the platform with some difficulty, then rights himself and takes the microphone.]
SADDAM
Hello to my Canadian friends. Everybody relax. Take a rest. Lift your feet up. Those Dogs Are Barking.
[He waits for a reaction, but none comes.]
SADDAM
You may have noticed some changes to your country. Don't worry about that, the changes will continue. I'm here to announce once and for all that Canada will now be known as "New Baghdad!" Qoloh Qalah!
[A Canadian flag is taken down from its pole and an Iraqi one put up in its place. An Iraqi one is placed over the Canadian one on the platform. The audience gasps.]
SADDAM
You will bow down to me as your ruler! You will obey my laws or you will be killed!!
[Celine Dion and Ugly Bob are standing by as Saddam laughs derisively.]
SADDAM
And now you will sing the Iraqi national anthem...
[A guard nudges Celine towards the microphone with the tip of his machine gun.]
SADDAM
Or you will be stabbed in the head!
CELINE DION
Shtud balaa shtud inca inca brusht...
TERRANCE
Now, Phlllip?
PHLLLIP
Now, Terrance.
[He puts on his gas-mask while Terrance brings out a bugle and sounds the alert. Everyone in the stadium then puts on masks.]
SADDAM
Hey!! What the hell is this?
[Celine puts on her mask.]
CELINE
Freh kashu kaliakaliakatchut...
[People all around the stadium turn around and start to drop trousers, and fart. One man stands on his hands, leaving his derriere high in the air with legs spread open. A brown cloud starts to form over the stadium and it descends into the gridiron. Saddam starts to gag.]
GUARD
They're using chemical warfare! How could they?!
[More brown clouds sweep across the field and seem to sweep Saddam along with them. He stumbles to the edge of the platform and the crowd cheers loudly. He finally falls and the clouds start to lift away. The Iraqi flag falls off the side of the platform as the people remove their masks and cheer some more.]
TERRANCE
We did it, Phillip! We destroyed the Turks!
PHILLIP
Oh, Glorious Day!
[Some people come down and start kicking Saddam around. Bob and Celine take off their masks while holding hands. She takes her hand away and quickly places a paper bag on Bob's head. A woman takes Saddam's left arm, a man takes his head. Terrance and Phillip come down from their seats and rush to the platform, and all stadium seats are now empty. Terrance and Celine hold hands.]
CELINE DION
Phillip, Terrance! You've saved Canada!
TERRANCE
Ooh, it was all Phillip's idea.
[They progress to full embrace.]
UGLY BOB
God bless you, Phillip. [Embraces him.]
PHILLIP
[Pulls away.] Don't touch me, Ugly Bob!
SCOTT
[Walking up.] Hey, What the hell happened? You were supposed to be blown up!
PHILLIP
We came up with a better plan. You see, Scott, after all your criticism, it was farting that saved Canada.
SCOTT
Oh! That is so juvenile!
[Terrance and Celine have let go of each other.]
TERRANCE
Hey, Scott, you like apples?
SCOTT
Of course!
TERRANCE
[Farts on him.] How do you like them apples? [Laughs heartily.]
SCOTT
I hate you, Terrance and Phillip!!! [Goes away.]
TERRANCE
Oh Celine Dion. You never finished that national anthem.
CELINE DION
You're right, Terrance. You're right.
[She walks forth and grabs the microphone]
CELINE DION
O Canada, our home and native land,
[Celine, Terrance, Bob, Phillip, and people on the field]
CROWD
True patriot love in all thy sons command
LARGE CROWD
With glowing hearts we see thee rise,
the True North, strong and free,
[A man uses Saddam's head like that of a dummy and provides a falsetto for it. The words scroll across the scoreboard.]
CROWD OUTSIDE
From far and wide, O Canada, we stand on guard for thee
God keep our land glorious and free
Oh, Canada we stand on guard for thee
[The camera pulls away from the stadium, and then from Canada, as if on a plane. More crowds are seen, followed by a group of Mounties, then some cabins, some mountains, and finally a moose.]
CROWD
Oh, Canada we stand on guard for thee
[The whole scene is now framed in a maple-leaf outline, with the moose in the center grazing. He looks up. When the anthem ends Terrance farts once more and laughs away. His laughter echoes.]
[End credits roll and theme music plays.]
ANNOUNCER 1
Who is Eric Cartman's father? Find out on an all new South Park, in just a few weeks.
End of Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The boys wait for Dr. Mephesto to regain consciousness and reveal the identity of Cartman's father. Meanwhile, an unexpected blizzard hits South Park.

script:Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut

[South Park.]
ANNOUNCER 2
Previously, on South Park: an air of sobriety fills the laboratory as the men of South Park gather to find out which one of them fathered this boy.
[A shot of Cartman chowing down on cookies and milk.]
ANNOUNCER 1
Who is Eric Cartman's father? At the end of this episode, you will know the answer.
[Opening warning and theme song. Much has been added. Then the episode resumes at the laboratory.]
MEPHESTO
And now, to continue, the father is indeed someone in this room.
CARTMAN
Man, this feels like the longest minute of my life.
[Kenny is restored to the story line. Kyle notices.]
STAN
Oooh- hey, Kenny.
MEPHESTO
Gentlemen, the father is...
[The lights go out.]
MR. GARRISON
Hey, what the hell's going on?
JIMBO
It's a power outage!
[Two gunshots, then a body is heard falling. The lights go back on and the men settle down.]
CHEF
Is everybody okay? That sounded like a gunshot!
OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh my God, look!
[Mephesto lies shot on the floor, his ass-headed cane next to him.]
KENNY
(Oh my God, they killed Mephesto!)
KYLE
You bastards!
MR. GARRISON
Mephesto's been shot.
[Everyone gathers around Mephesto.]
CHEF
Is he ...dead?
[Jimbo and Ned stand near a newly broken window.]
JIMBO
Hey! This window is shot out, too! That means the killer was not someone in this room!
MR. GARRISON
Then who was it?
ANNOUNCER 1
Who shot Mephesto? Was it the school counselor? Or was it Ms. Crabtree? Or was it--
CARTMAN
Ey! Wait a minute! I didn't find out who my father was!
ANNOUNCER 1
Or was it Sheila Broflovski?
CHEF
[Listening to Mephesto's chest.] Waait! [Getting up.] He's still breathin'! He's not dead.
CARTMAN
[Grabbing Mephesto's shirt.] Goddammit! Who's my father?
CHEF
[About to lift Mephesto.] We've got to get him to the hospital.
CARTMAN
You've got to be kidding me!
CHEF
Come on, children!
[Chef carries Mephesto out the door. Cartman follows.]
CARTMAN
Eeeehh..!
GERALD BROFLOVSKI
Oh, that poor kid. It must be hell for him going through all this.
[Ms. Cartman sighs deeply and moves away.]
JIMBO
There's a murderer free in South Park. We have to find out who it is before they kill again.
MR. GARRISON
Yeah. God only knows who they'll kill next.
ANNOUNCER 1
Who will they kill next? Will it be Jimbo? Barbrady? The Denver Broncos?
[Chef is driving up a hill with the kids and Mephesto.]
CARTMAN
Is he awake yet?
KYLE
[Checking.] He's bleeding pretty bad back here.
CHEF
Don't let him bleed on my Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel.
KYLE
What's a Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel?
CHEF
I actually was with Meredith Baxter-Birney in this very car. And afterwards we used that towel to... [Mad at himself.] Wait a minute. Why am I telling you this?
STAN
Could you pull over so I can get out?
CHEF
What? We have to get to the hospital.
STAN
I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.
CHEF
Sorry, Stan. We just gotta drop Mephesto off and then we can get outta there, alright?
KYLE
Man, it's really starting to snow.
[The scene outside is filled with snow falling as Chef drives by.]
KYLE
I hope they don't close the roads.
CARTMAN
They can't. Mephesto can't die.
KYLE
Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman.
CARTMAN
No way, dude! I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song, "Come Sail Away", by Styx. If I hear the first part of that song, I have to finish it.
KYLE
Really?
CARTMAN
Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done.
[Kyle looks at Stan, who looks back. Kyle begins.]
KYLE
I'm sailing away...
CARTMAN
No! Don't!
KYLE
Set an open course for the virgin sea...
[Cartman tries to resist, but the pull is just too strong.]
CARTMAN
Eh--
[Two short gasps follow, then Cartman races through...]
CARTMAN
For I've got to be free,
Free to face the life that's ahead of me,
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard,
We'll search for tomorrow, on every shore,
And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on,
Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay,
A gathering of angels appeared above my head,
They sang to us this song of hope,
And this is what they said,
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads,
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
[The car passes a sign for Hell's Pass Hospital.]
CARTMAN
I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise
We climbed about their starship and headed for the skies
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
[Cartman is out of breath, breathing heavily, Chef keeps driving.]
KYLE
Whoa, dude!
[City Hall, first night. Sheila, Officer Barbrady, Sharon, and Jimbo are assembled before the Mayor.]
JIMBO
What are we gonna do, Mayor? This killer is on the loose!
SHEILA
We can't even leave our homes for fear of our children's safety.
SHARON
Uh... Where are our children?
[They look around.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Officer Barbrady, let's pretend for one second that we had a competent law enforcer in this town: what would he do?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Hmmm... That's a good question, Mayor. Let me get right on that with thinking.
[A man and his boom mic operator rush in.]
MAN
Mayor! Mayor!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[Aside to an aide.] The press is here.
SID GREENFIELD
My name is Sid Greenfield. I'm the director from Los Angeles for America's Most Wanted.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[Amazed.] Youuu certainly made it up here quickly.
GREENFIELD
We're desperate for stories.
[The boom mic operator thumps him.]
GREENFIELD
A-and this one is so compelling.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[Aroused.] Really??
GREENFIELD
Sure. This story has everything. People. Furniture. Talking-ih it's a real American story.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Hey, I thought of something. [Close-up.] Uh... no, wait, that's subtraction.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Mr. Director person, what exactly do you want to do?
JIMBO
Mayor, shouldn't we be focusi--
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Shh.
GREENFIELD
We just want to do a recreation of the story for our show. Then we'll flash a number on the screen that people can call if they have any information regarding the identity or location of the shooter. That's it. You win, we win, America wins.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Are you sure this wouldn't make our little town look dangerous?
GREENFIELD
Don't worry, Mayor. America's Most Wanted is not about violence, it's about family.
CAMERAMAN
It is?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[Thoughtfully.] Weelll, in that case, I guess it's okay!
GREENFIELD
Great! We'll get started with auditions immediately. What part should we cast first?
ANNOUNCER 1
Who will the director cast first? Will it be Mr. Garrison? Officer Barbrady? Chef?
[At the Unplanned Parenthood Clinic, it is snowing.]
LIANE
I want to have... an abortion.
RECEPTIONIST
Uoh well, we can do that. This must be a very difficult time for you, Mrs...
LIANE
Cartman. Yesuh- it's such a hard decision, but I just don't feel I can raise a child in this screwy world.
RECEPTIONIST
Yes, Ms. Cartman. If you don't feel fit to raise a child, then abortion probably is the answer. Do you know the actual time of conception?
LIANE
About eight years ago.
RECEPTIONIST
[Processing.] ...I sseee, so the fetus is...
LIANE
Eight years old.
RECEPTIONIST
Ms. Cartman, uh- eight years old is a little late to be considering abortion.
LIANE
Really?
RECEPTIONIST
Yes, this is what we would refer to as the "fortieth trimester".
LIANE
But I just don't think I'm a fit mother.
RECEPTIONIST
Wuh... But we prefer to abort babies a little- ...earlier on; in fact, there's a law against abortions after the second trimester.
LIANE
Well, I think you need to keep your laws off of my body.
RECEPTIONIST
Hmmmmm. Tsk, I'm afraid I can't help you, Ms. Cartman. If you want to change the law, you'll have to speak with your congressman.
LIANE
[Rises from the chair.] Well, that's exactly what I intend to do. Good day!
[She leaves, meanwhile at the Hell's Pass Hospital, Chef and the children have arrived.]
CHEF
Come on, children! We've gotta find a doctor! [Kenny follows him in.]
STAN
[Stops.] Ugh. I can't do it, dude. [Kyle and Cartman pass him.]
KYLE
Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad.
CARTMAN
Yeah, stop being a wuss!
[Operating room. A patient lies on the table, and the doctor is being assisted by a female nurse with no arms below the elbow. Chef and the kids enter.]
CHEF
Doctor!
DR. DOCTOR
One moment, please. Nurse, I need 20 cc's of sodium pentathol, stat!
[She reaches for the syringe and grabs it with her mouth.]
KYLE
Whoa, dude! She doesn't have any arms!
DR. DOCTOR
We're an equal-opportunity employer here, son.
[She spits out the syringe, and he catches it along the cartridge end.]
CHEF
Doctor! We've got a shot cracker outside!
DR. DOCTOR
I'll be right with you, right after I inject this man with a long needle.
STAN
[Pained.] Oh man. [Grabs his stomach.] I'm gonna be sick.
DR. DOCTOR
There there, young man. Medical science is nothing to be afraid of.
[Squeezes out any air left in the syringe. A few drops escape, and he rams the needle into the man's side.]
STAN
Oogh.
[Scraping sounds are now heard.]
NURSE
Ooooo, I think you're hitting the bone.
STAN
Ooooogh.
[Dr. Doctor is still driving the syringe.]
DR. DOCTOR
Yes. I can hear the needle scraping against the bone inside.
[Blood starts bursting from the injection site.]
DR. DOCTOR
Oops, he's hemorrhaging.
[A burst lands next to Stan, who is wide-eyed at this point.]
STAN
Aghh!
DR. DOCTOR
[Plop.] Ooo! His head fell off.
STAN
I'm gotta get outta here!
KYLE
Stan!
DR. DOCTOR
Ugh, some people just have a weak stomach.
[America's Most Wanted temporary set.]
[Greenfield is accompanied by his assistant in the auditorium.]
MEPHESTO TRYOUT
And the father of Eric Cartman is... Bang! Oh, Jiminy! I've been shot! [Drops the cane.]
GREENFIELD
Oh, thank you very much. We'll get back to you. [The actor departs.] I think I've seen enough genetic engineers. Let's move on to the auditions for the part of Mister-uhh Garrison.
ASSISTANT
Call the Mr. Garrison auditions!
GARRISON 1
Boy, I sure hope I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.
MR. HAT 1
[Just a sock with two purple disks for eyes.] You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!
GREENFIELD
Alright, not bad. Let's keep him on the top pile. Next!
MR. GARRISON
I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.
MR. HAT
You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!
GREENFIELD
Thank you! Next!
MR. GARRISON
[Shocked.] What?
GREENFIELD
Next!
[Mr. Garrison leaves, dejected, as another actor enters.]
GARRISON 2
[An actor with a deep voice.] I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.
MR. HAT 2
[A fist with a face drawn on it.] You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.
GREENFIELD
Perfect! You got it! Let's move on to the Chefs!
[Mr. Garrison stands dumbstruck. Meanwhile Liane is in bed with her congressman.]
LIANE
...And so you see, Congressman O'Reilly, that's why I think abortion laws should be changed.
O'REILLY
Well, all I know is that third-trimester abortions are illegal. I don't really know anything about 40th.
LIANE
But the person at Unplanned Parenthood said you were who I had to talk to about changing the law.
O'REILLY
No- No, I think youah gotta talk to the governor about that stuff.
LIANE
Oh, dear.
[Back at the hospital, Mephest is still on the operating table, sedated.]
DR. DOCTOR
Well, this is about all I can do for him.
CARTMAN
Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is.
DR. DOCTOR
Sorry, son, it might be a while.
[Cartman bounds atop Mephesto and begins slapping him around.]
CARTMAN
Wake up, you son of a bitch!
CHEF
Whoa!
[Dr. Doctor lowers Cartman from atop Mephesto.]
DR. DOCTOR
Now, son, that's not's gonna do him any good. I'll let you know if there's a change in his condition.
CARTMAN
I can't wait anymore. What am I supposed to do?
KYLE
Hey, Cartman.
CARTMAN
What?
KYLE
I'm sailing ay...
CARTMAN
--way; Set an open course for the virgin sea
For I've got to be free, free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard...
STAN
Okay okay, let's get outta here now!
CARTMAN
...We'll search for tomorrow on every shore...
KYLE
[Looking out at the snow storm.] I don't know if that's gonna be too easy.
CARTMAN
...And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on...
DR. DOCTOR
My God, that's a hell of a storm.
CARTMAN
I look to the sea; Reflections--
--in the waves spark my memory...
STAN
Oh, weak.
[Kenny looks up towards the window.]
CARTMAN
...Some happy, some sad; I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had
We lived happily forever, so the--
[Back at the studio, auditions have ended, Greenfield is looking at the storm.]
GREENFIELD
God, I hate mountains. This better not push back our shooting schedule.
[The actors for Mephesto, Barbrady, and Chef are on the laboratory stage. Greenfield takes the megaphone.]
GREENFIELD
Okay, people, let's rehearse the reenactment from the top before we shoot it.
[Greenfield sees a new actor and turns to his assistant.]
GREENFIELD
Who's that?
ASSISTANT
Oh, that's TV's Eric Roberts. We were able to get him to play the part of the little monkey guy.
GREENFIELD
Whoa. Talk about "all washed-up", huh? Great to have you, Eric!
[Eric Roberts stops munching a doughnut long enough to wave and smile.]
GREENFIELD
Here we go, aaand action.
MEPHESTO ACTOR
I want to announce who the father is.
GREENFIELD
Bang!!
MEPHESTO ACTOR
Oh, I've been shot! [Falls over.]
BARBRADY ACTOR
Nobody move! I'm a law officer!
CHEF ACTOR
My God, I think he's gone into cardiac arrest!
MEPHESTO ACTOR
[As Chef Actor speaks] Whoaw..!
BARBRADY ACTOR
You seem somewhat unnerved by this, Chef.
CHEF ACTOR
Are you accusing me, Barbrady? Because if you are accusing me, don't hide behind your clever riddles!
BARBRADY ACTOR
Our differences must be set aside for now, Mr. Chef. I'm simply a man, a man trying to do my job.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Whoa, this is a good movie!
[Back at the hospital.]
CARTMAN
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me-hee
[The boys are in the emergency room with a bunch of patients bleeding, getting nauseous, etc.]
STAN
Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?
[The doctor bursts through the emergency doors with the nurse, a blonde is bleeding from a gash on her neck.]
BLONDE
Doctor, I can't focus!
DR. DOCTOR
We're doing the best we can, ma'am. They've closed the pass and none of the other doctors can get through. For now, it's just me, and Nurse Goodly.
[She tosses the stethoscope around for a better hold.]
CHEF
Wait a second. They've closed the pass??
DR. DOCTOR
Yes, I'm afraid we're critically understaffed. Unless we get help soon, all these people in here are completely fucked.
[Everyone turns to him and gasps. He quickly retracts.]
DR. DOCTOR
Metaphorically speaking, that is.
CARTMAN
What about Mephesto? Are you taking care of him?
DR. DOCTOR
He's on full life-support and breathing fine. He shouldn't need any help - so long as the power doesn't go out.
[Bzht. Everything goes black.]
DR. DOCTOR
Oof. Who didn't see that coming a mile away, huh?
[Show time! A siren rotates, there's a hold-up and a helicopter zooms in on a raid from above. There's also a ground shot of the arrest. Lady Justice appears. A suspect is thrown behind bars.]
VOICE-OVER
Tonight, on America's Most Wanted, a shooter is on the loose in Colorado, and its residents are up in arms! Here's your host, John Walsh.
JOHN WALSH
Good evening and welcome to America's Most Wanted. Tonight: terror invaded the small mountain community of South Park, Colorado, when Dr. Alphonse Mephesto [His picture appears.] was gunned down in his laboratory. America's Most Wanted has reconstructed this heinous crime [The South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch is seen.] in hopes that your calls could help solve the case.
[A reenactment plays.]
MEPHESTO ACTOR
[Pfff. The actors flinch and he throws away the cane] I've been shot!
GARRISON ACTOR
[Catches him.] My God, Mr. Hat! Get some help!
MR. HAT ACTOR
Right away, Mr. Garrison.
ERIC ROBERTS AS KEVIN
No, no! My lifetime partner and friend, gone, taken away in the wink of an eye. O, Fortune, why do you mock me?
GREENFIELD
What the--? Bu-eh. Eric Roberts is improvising lines again!
CHEF ACTOR
I'm going to get the man to a hospital. Who will help me?
ERIC ROBERTS
This is not a world I want to live in! Doesn't anyone want--
GREENFIELD
God-dammit!
[Outside, a pine tree falls on the studio's power lines. The lights dim and all action comes to a halt.]
GREENFIELD
What the hell is this?!
CAMERAMAN
We've lost the feed to L.A.
JOHN WALSH
Uuuhm... We-we seem to have lost our linkup to the South Park crew, sso I guess we'll be going to our featured movie, Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
ANNOUNCER 1
Who framed Roger Rabbit? Was it Jimbo? Mr. Garrison? Chef?
GREENFIELD
Somebody go see why we lost the hookup!
[The doors fly open and snow is swept in.]
JIMBO
Holy smokes, that blizzard is getting crazy!
[Back at the hospital. Lights can be seen in most of the rooms. Inside, the backup generator has come online and everyone is running around.]
NURSE GOODLY
Don't panic, anybody. The power lines are down, but the backup generator is running just fine.
DR. DOCTOR
[Opening the operating room doors wide.] Nurse, I could use some help in here!
GOODLY
Coming!
[Cartman stands in her way stopping her.]
CARTMAN
Lady-m? Is Mephesto gonna be okay?
GOODLY
Yes, for now. But I'm afraid the generator won't run for long. The batteries run out in half an hour. Time is very short.
DR. DOCTOR
Nurse, please! I need another pair of hands in here!
[She looks at him and glares.]
DR. DOCTOR
Oh, sorry.
[Liane at the Governor's mansion, in bed with him.]
LIANE
Don't you see, Governor? I should have a right to have an abortion if I want one.
GOVERNOR
[Smoking.] Mmaarr. I don't know-uh, I might need some more convincing, hm-hm-hm.
[He edges closer to her.]
LIANE
I mean, what right do I have bringing another child into this overpopulated world? Then again, I should've thought of that before having sex. then againuh-- Oh, I just don't know...
[Back at the hospital.]
DR. DOCTOR
Please, Mr. Chef. I've over 100 people to attend to an-and only myself and Nurse Goodly.
CHEF
What do you want me to do?
DR. DOCTOR
Do you know anything about surgery?
CHEF
I used to watch Quincy.
DR. DOCTOR
What?! Why the hell didn't you say so? Put on some scrubs! Boys, I'm making you all honorary doctors. You can help us save these people's lives.
STAN
No way, dude!
[America's Most Wanted studio, in the dark, Jimbo opens the door and a pile of snow pours in on him.]
JIMBO
Well, [Opens his right eye.] we're not going anywhere for a loong time.
GREENFIELD
We're snowed in?
MAYOR MCDANEILS
Yes. We're trapped!
MR. GARRISON
[Snuggling up to Greenfield.] Like sailors on a submarine.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
My God, this is the worst storm I've ever seen.
ASSISTANT
Oh I have to get out of here, I haven't eaten since breakfast.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Yeah, I'm gettin' hungry, too. [Rubs his belly.]
JIMBO
I hope you all realize what we might be facing here.
[Everyone is now focused on Jimbo.]
JIMBO
Our only option might be to... eat each other to stay alive.
[Gasps are heard all around.]
GREENFIELD
Uuuhh, it's only been like, four hours. Aren't you resorting to cannibalism a little quickly?
JIMBO
That's the law of land, Mr. Director. It ain't pretty, but if a few of us must die so the rest can stay alive, so be it.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Buut, how do we decide "who"?
JIMBO
Well, we draw straws.
GREENFIELD
Now, wait a minute. We all had a big breakfast: can't you people go without eating for a little while?
JIMBO
Calm down, soldier! We need every person here to keep his head! Barbrady, fetch some straws.
GREENFIELD
Well- who the hell made you the boss anyway?
ANNOUNCER 1
Who the hell made Jimbo boss? Was it Barbrady? Chef? Mr. Gar--
[Same night, the hospital. The doctor is operating with his motley crew. Stan and Kyle are on one side, Cartman and Kenny are on the other. Chef stands at one end of the table between Cartman and Kyle, and the doctor is at the other end.]
DR. DOCTOR
Miles' appendix has burst. I have no choice but to operate now with our limited power. I need you all to be strong for me. [Stan raises his brows.] Nurse Goodly will take care of the anesthesia. Chef, you act as her arms. [He withdraws.] Boys, you have to help with suction and bandages. Ready?
STAN
No.
DR. DOCTOR
Okay. First, I'll make an incision on the chest, over the heart.
STAN
[Queasily.] Oh boy.
[The doctor slices the flesh vertically over the X he has marked over the heart. It splits open and Stan removes his mask.]
STAN
Bleech!
[The vomit goes right into the open incision.]
KYLE
Duhuhude! You barfed into the incision!
CARTMAN
Sweet.
DR. DOCTOR
Suction!
[Kenny places the suction cup over the incision. The power begins to flicker, and he removes the cup.]
CARTMAN
Hey, who's screwing with the lights?
ANNOUNCER 1
Who is screwing with the lights? Is it Barbrady? Or Jimbo? Or the 1991 Denver Broncos?
CARTMAN
[To Kenny.] That is really starting to piss me off.
[America's Most Wanted studio, nighttime. Barbrady stands holding the straws.]
JIMBO
Alright. So far, everybody has a long piece of straw. We'll keep drawing. [Draws.] Whew.
MR. GARRISON
[Draws] Whew.
[Sees that his straw is short and throws it away, behind himself.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Wooo!
JIMBO
Wait a minute! Where the hell is the short one?
OFFICER BARBRADY
The short what?
JIMBO
Dammit, Barbrady! When you draw straws, you're supposed to have one of them short! That's how you decide who loses!
BARBRADY
That's not how I played it!
MR. GARRISON
Uuugh, could we hurry this up? My stomach is growling.
[Back at the hospital.]
DR. DOCTOR
I found a map that shows the location of a backup generator. Apparently, they built a large self-sustaining generator- for just this kind of emergency. But it's out and away from the hospital.
CHEF
So how do we get to it?
DR. DOCTOR
We must split up into two teams: Team A, and Team B. Team A will consist of myself, Stan, Kyle, Eric, Chef, and Nurse Goodly. Team B will consist of Kenny.
[Kenny is stunned. The doctor pats his head.]
DR. DOCTOR
Now, listen closely, Team B. Your goal will be to turn on the backup generator. To do this you must brave the storm outside and get into this sewage duct.
[Dr. Doctor points it out to him on the map.]
DR. DOCTOR
Meanwhile, Team A will go to the holding area, here [Points to it.] where there is a television, and some cocoa. We will drink the cocoa and watch family programming until Team B makes it through the sewage duct. By that time, Team B- remember, that's you, Kenny- should reach the outer core of the generator. It will be a cold and dangerous climb to the top, and there could be velociraptors- here.
[He points to an area between the holding area and the generator.]
DR. DOCTOR
Once you reach the top, you should be able to get a clear view from this windows of us drinking cocoa and watching television. Then, you could proceed down into the generator, and power it on. Are there any questions?
CARTMAN
Nnoh, that sounds pretty sweet to me.
DR. DOCTOR
Great, then, let's do it. Go, Team!
KENNY
(Huh?)
[The studio.]
MR. GARRISON
I... can't... go on... eh. So... hungry...
MAYOR MCDANIELS
We're all going to die in this horrible place. [She covers her eyes.]
JIMBO
We have to have the energy to make it through the night. We have to eat.
GREENFIELD
How can we? How could we live with ourselves?
JIMBO
There's only one answer: eat Eric Roberts. [He's shown squatting on the floor.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[Thoughtfully.] Yes, of course. Nobody gives a shit about Eric Roberts.
MR. GARRISON
[Madly] Eat Eric Roberts!
[The rest of the group goes mad, Ned gets up and everyone prepares to do him in.]
ERIC ROBERTS
No! No, please!
[Later. Eric's arms, legs, and head have been removed, and bees hover around the corpse.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Well, there's no going back now. [Ned and Jimbo keep eating.] We're cannibals. [Someone burps.] God save us.
JIMBO
God wants you to live, Mayor. Fight!
ASSISTANT
[Coolly.] Well I have to admit, Eric Roberts was much juicier than I expected.
GREENFIELD
[Miffed.] Aaww.
MR. GARRISON
This snow just isn't letting up. We're gonna die here, I know it.
JIMBO
What time is it, Barbrady?
BARBRADY
It's almost midnight.
MR. GARRISON
Oh! I can't... go on. [Drops to his side.]
JIMBO
We'll give the storm another hour. After that, we might have to eat again.
GREENFIELD
What? Christ, are you people diabetic or something?
[The hospital. Kenny has made it through the tunnel and exits the manhole. He's pretty soiled. He turns on his communicator.]
DR. DOCTOR
Team B? Come in, Team B.
KENNY
(This is Team B.)
DR. DOCTOR
Listen, Team B. We've found another path to the generator. There's actually a nice heated walkway to it, so you don't need to walk through all that sewage.
KENNY
(Are you fuckin' telling me that I could've fuckin' gone that way?!)
DR. DOCTOR
Oh... Well, forget I said that, then. Listen, Team B, you should be seeing a large drift of snow with some metal sticking out of it just to your left.
KENNY
(Yup! I see it in the drift.)
DR. DOCTOR
Good. Head towards it. Team A out.
CARTMAN
What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is?
[Kenny heads toward the generator and a dinosaur casts its shadow on both of them.]
[The studio. Ned, Jimbo and the Mayor are eating again. The camera shows that Greenfield and the assistant have joined Eric Roberts as casualties to cannibalism. Barbrady is seen working on a leg and some ribs.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
My God, what a harrowing tale of human drama this is. All of us doing what we must to survive.
JIMBO
It is amazing what people can do under stress. Just look at the pyramids. Nobody knows how they built those, or who.
ANNOUNCER 1
Who built the pyramids? Was it the Babylonians? Officer Barbrady? Samaritans?
[The generator. Kenny has opened the door and is ready for new orders.]
KENNY
(Okay, I've reached the generator)
DR. DOCTOR
Roger, Team B. [To Team A.] He's reached the backup generator. [To Kenny.] Team B, can you see the two copper nodes?
KENNY
(Roger.)
DR. DOCTOR
Good. Now, is there a wire connecting them?
KENNY
(Negative.)
DR. DOCTOR
Damn! The wire connecting the nodes is gone! We need to complete the circuit between them, or we're screwed.
KYLE
D'you have any wire here?
DR. DOCTOR
There's no time! Once these lights flicker out all the patients on life-support are going to die!
KENNY
(I'll stick 'em together)
DR. DOCTOR
No, Kenny, you can't. There must be some other way! He's going to make the connection himself, with his hands.
KYLE
No, he'll die!
CARTMAN
Go, Kenny!
DR. DOCTOR
Kenny! Nnnoooooo!
KENNY
(Goodbbyyyyee-ugh!)
STAN
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
KYLE
You bastard!
[The lights stabilize.]
CHEF
The power!
DR. DOCTOR
Quickly! Get the scanner running again!
[The scanner is brought in.]
DR. DOCTOR
We've got a chance now!
[The White House. Liane has bedded her way up to the President, and she's in bed with him now.]
PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON
Well, okay, Mrs. Cartman, I'll legalize 40th trimester abortions for you.
LIANE
[Relieved and joyful.] Oh, thank you, thank you.
CLINTON
We'll have the pregnancy terminated immediately. [Her eyes widen.]
LIANE
[Pulls back.] Terminated?
CLINTON
Why yes, that's what an abortion is.
LIANE
Oh no uh- I didn't mean that. I meant the other thing you can do-what's that other A word?
CLINTON
Adoption?
LIANE
Yess, that's what I mean. Adoption.
CLINTON
Well, that's- pretty different.
LIANE
Oh, I should tell my son the truth about everything myself. Good day, Mr. President.
[She quickly leaves the bed. Now to a Colorado sunrise.]
DR. DOCTOR
Well, we made it. The power is on, the snow is melting, and your friend Mephesto is doing fine.
MEPHESTO
[Coming to.] Where... where am I?
CHEF
You're at the hospital, Mr. Mephesto. You were shot. Now, we don't know who tried to shoot you, but--
MEPHESTO
Ohh. I'm sure it was my brother again. He tries to shoot me every month.
CHEF
Ooohhh.
DR. DOCTOR
Where's the little fat boy? He'll be delighted that Mephesto's awake.
CHEF
He went off looking for Mr. Kenny.
[Outside, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are at the generator. I guess the raptors have left.]
STAN
He was a good friend, and I'll miss him.
KYLE
He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.
CARTMAN
Yeah. And now he's a freezy-pop.
[Kenny is shown iced over, and the boys simply stare.]
STAN
[To Kyle.] Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?
KYLE
I don't know. Let's find out.
["Ave Maria" begins to play. Jimbo is the first to shovel his way out of the studio. Mr. Garrison follows, then Ned, then the Mayor, then...]
MR. GARRISON
Ohh. It's over! We're free!
OFFICER BARBRADY
Yes, but at what cost, Mr. Garrison? At what cost?
JIMBO
Listen, everybody. We did what we had to in there.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
But- hhhow will we live with ourselves now?
NED
Mm-one day at a time, Mayor. Mm-one day at a time.
SINGER
[A la Aaron Neville]
Ave Maria...
[The camera pulls back, and back...]
MR. GARRISON
Well, I'm bringing home some Eric Roberts in a doggie bag. Does anybody else want some?
[The hospital. Mephesto is recuperating, and Kevin is back at his side. All the possible fathers are present, including the Denver Broncos.]
MEPHESTO
I'm glad that you could all come. I can finally reveal who the father of Eric Cartman is. But first, I want to thank Kenny McCormick for sacrificing his life--
CARTMAN
Just tell us already!
MEPHESTO
Alright alright. The father of Eric Cartman is... Say, did anybody see that Terrance and Phillip special last month? Wasn't that just the funniest thing--
CARTMAN
[Boiling.] Dammit! Tell me who my father is already!
MEPHESTO
Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father is... Mrs. Cartman. [All gasp.]
CHEF
What???
LIANE
[Back with her cookies.] Yes, it's true.
MR. GARRISON
Noo, that doesn't make sense!
MEPHESTO
Yes. It took quite a while for me to understand as well. You see, Mrs. Cartman is a hermaphrodite. [She looks guilty.]
MR. GARRISON
Uh-meaning what?
MEPHESTO
Meaning that she has both male and female genitals.
LIANE
It's true.
CHEF
You mean, at the Drunken Barn Dance, when we all got together with her, she was a he?!
MEPHESTO
No no, not exactly. But she did have a penis.
[Ned, Barbrady, and Chef vomit. The rest just cup their mouths. Gerald is shocked.]
MEPHESTO
The fact of the matter is, hermaphrodites cannot bear children, so Mrs. Cartman's DNA match with Eric can only mean that she is his father, and she got another woman pregnant at the Drunken Barn Dance.
CARTMAN
Ugh. Man, this is fuckin' weak.
STAN
Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!
LIANE
I'm sorry I never told you, Eric.
[Eric and Stan look up at her.]
LIANE
I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you.
CARTMAN
Oh, wow, gee whiz, you think so, Mom?!
MEPHESTO
Well, that's that. Thank you all for playing.
CARTMAN
No no, wait a minute! If... if she's my dad, then... who's my mom?!
ANNOUNCER 1
Who is Eric Cartman's mother? Is it Mrs. Crabtree? Sheila Broflovski? The Mayor?
CARTMAN
Ooohhh, forget it!
End of Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut

synopsis:In order to catch the "Chickenlover", Officer Barbrady must learn how to read. Barbrady resigns and anarchy ensues, so the boys pitch in to help.

script:Chickenlover

[South Park Elementary, out front. Garrison and the class stand next to a colorful bus.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children. Each of you gets to choose two books from the Booktastic bus.
CARTMAN
[To Kyle.] Reading sucks ass.
MR. GARRISON
Eric, shut up! [Eric looks up.]
[Inside the bus. The kids mill around and start browsing.]
KYLE
Boring. Boring. Gay. Boring. Boring.
STAN
[At the next stack.] Hey you guys. Check out these books. [They come over.] Sabrina Unchained.
KYLE
Wow, these books look cool!
[Cartman smiles. They look at romance novels. Kyle takes "Seduction", Kenny takes "Bound to Love", Cartman takes "Body to Body".]
CARTMAN
Hey, there's a lot of big words in these books.
KENNY
(There's a lot of fuckin' vaginas and penises.)
BUS DRIVER
[Stops by.] Hello, kids. I see you're discovering the magic of reading.
[He is wearing a blue suit, with rainbow shirt and cape.]
KYLE
Who are you?
BUS DRIVER
I drive the Booktastic bus, where magic begins. You see, reading opens up whole new worlds to you. You can take a canoe down the Amazon or go back in time to Camelot or become a race car driver, all by just opening a book. Just like magic. The magic of reading.
CARTMAN
[Irritated.] God, shut up, dude.
BUS DRIVER
Go ahead and pick any books you like. Then give in. Give in to the magic. [He floats away.]
STAN
[To Kyle.] If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?
KYLE
Yeah, this is stupid! Books aren't magical.
[Kyle tosses his book away.]
CARTMAN
I don't know, I'm kinda getting a tingly feeling looking at these.
[A man and woman are kissing on the cover of his chosen book. Off in the distance a chicken clucks and a woman shrieks.]
KENNY
(Hey, what's that?)
STAN
I don't know. Let's go see.
[They drop their books and exit the bus. Cartman is glued to his.]
[Here's a show within a show: an episode of COPS shown in real time along with South Park.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, being an officer of the peace means a lot of things. It's a hard job, but then I'm a hard man. A lot of people think that in a small town there isn't a lot for the law to do. Well, they're wrong.
DISPATCHER 1
[Through intercom.] All units. All units. Report to 254 Avenue de los Mexicanos. Possible hostile situation.
[Officer Barbrady puts his siren light up on the dashboard.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
There, you see? This could be a bank robbery. Or possibly even a murder! This ain't no Podunk little town!
DISPATCHER
And, Barbrady, your wife called. She wants you to get some pizza on the way home.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Goddammit!
[A crowd has gathered at the site of the incident, across the street from the school. The boys are there, front and center. Officer Barbrady pulls up with the COPS film crew, and his siren light is now on the car roof.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Okay, people, move along. There's nothing to see here. [To the rancher.] What's the trouble? Where's the body?
RANCHER
Barbrady, I just caught some guy in here having sex with one of my chickens.
[Barbrady says nothing as the crew films him for a long pause.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Uhhhh... oh.
[The chicken doesn't seem traumatized one bit.]
WOMAN
My God, that's disgusting!
STAN
Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Uhh, boys, you move along. This isn't for young eyes to see. [To the rancher.] Did you get a good look at the suspect?
RANCHER
Naw, I didn't see anything. It just happened so fast.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Wellll uh, this is quite interesting, huh, guys?
CAMERAMAN
Uhh, we're gonna go grab some lunch and maybe get some shots of those turtles down at the pond.
[The crew leaves.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Haw, camel poo.
STAN
Hey, what's this?
[Stan picks up a sheet of paper.]
KYLE
It looks like a note.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Give me that! [Takes the note.] That's a clue, and you'll get your stinking DNA all over it!
RANCHER
[Coming over.] What does it say?
[The note reads: Another chicken gets it tomorrow!]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Uhh... It says, uuh, "Sorry I had sex with the chicken. I won't do it again. Bye-bye." Well, there you have it. Case closed.
RANCHER
Dammit, Barbrady, what the hell's wrong with you? Every time somethin' happens in this town, you say "Nothin' to see here", and "Case closed." But we want justice. We have to find this sicko!
OFFICER BARBRADY
I said, return to your homes before I start arresting people.
RANCHER
For what? Orderly conduct?
OFFICER BARBRADY
How about fishing without a license?
RANCHER
I'm not fishin'.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Whataya call this then?
[He pulls a fishing rod out from somewhere.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
If you do not comply, I'll be forced to execute each and every one of you... [Pulls out his gun.] by gunshot to the head.
[The crowd quickly disperses, the boys remain.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
That's right, return to your simple lives. [Puts his gun away] Just forget this ever happened. Forget.
[He moves off, leaving the boys with the chicken.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
For-get.
KYLE
Wow. Barbrady sure is acting weird.
STAN
Yeah, I wonder what's wrong.
[The patrol car. Barbrady gets in and looks at the note again. The letters become unintelligible symbols. He starts up the car and throws the note away. He stops at a stop sign, and its letters turn into Korean symbols. He drives on and ends up at Fran's.]
TELLER
Welcome to Fran's. Can I help you?
[The letters in the board above the speaker are jumbled as they are, but they start whirling around, and Barbrady is speechless.]
TELLER
Sir, can I help you?
[The letters A, C, K, R, and U stop whirling and start laughing at him.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Uhhh, just give me two cheeseburgers and some jalapeño poppers.
TELLER
Sure, there's just one problem.
OFFICER BARBRADY
What's that?
TELLER
We're a bank.
[The board is back to normal.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
I know that, smarty-pants! What do you think, I'm some kinda idiot?
TELLER
Yes.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Hmmm. [Drives away.] I can't go on living this lie!
[Channel 4 Breaking News.]
ANCHOR
With chicken after chicken being violated, the South Park police are under increasing pressure to solve the case of the Chickenfucker. We now go live to a press conference where Officer Barbrady and the Mayor are fielding questions.
REPORTER 1
Officer Barbrady, what would drive a man to such a disgusting act?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, nobody can say for sure; uh, no motive has yet been established.
REPORTER 2
Do the police have any leads?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, both 3D computer modeling and intensive seismology have not given us any leads as of yet.
REPORTER 3
But has Chickenfucker left any clues at the crime?
OFFICER BARBRADY
All right, all right! I can't read!
[The room falls silent and the reporter sits down.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
There, I said it! I can't read! Are you happy now? You pushed and you pushed, and now you all know my terrible secret! I'm illegitimate! I'm not fit to be a policeman! I retire!
[He removes his badge and leaves the room.]
PRESS COORDINATOR
Okay, thank you all for coming. There's uhh, coffee and brownies out front.
ANCHOR
And so Officer Barbrady has taken a leave of absence, and South Park would have to manage without any police force for a while--
[A note wrapped around a brick crashes onto the anchor desk and the anchor gets the note.]
ANCHOR
This just in! South Park is plunged into total anarchy!
[A camera pans across the rioting.]
ANCHOR
Exactly two seconds after the retirement of Officer Barbrady, looting and pillaging erupted in the quiet mountain town!
[A man comes and takes away the symbol in the inset. Another man takes the 4.]
[On the street, two men use a third as a battering ram and throw him into the electronics store through the big display window. He gets up and helps the other two take the big-screen TV away. Several people have looted beer and drink as fast as they can. A red car crashes into a yellow building. Here and there people are screaming.]
LOOTER 1
Whoopee, this is killer!
LOOTER 2
With no cops around, we can do whatever we want!
[The boys are at a corner when someone runs by with a boom box. Kenny is closest to the corner.]
KYLE
Whoa, dude, what's going on?
STAN
I don't know.
[Next to Kenny, two people are trying to turn car over, and...]
STAN
Oh my God, they've killed--
[Kenny opens the door and steps out, dusting himself off.]
STAN
Oh, never mind.
[The Mayor is watching all this from her office. Automatic weapons fire is heard as a woman screams, but the street before her window is clear of any commotion.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
I don't believe it. All this time, Barbrady actually did keep this town peaceful.
AIDE 1
Who knew? I always thought he was a complete idiot.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
He is.
[The press breaks in and rushes the Mayor's desk. More questions, but one stands out.]
REPORTER 3
What do you plan to do about the South Park riots?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
No reason for concern. I want to assure all of you that Officer Barbrady is still our active police force.
REPORTER 3
But he's illiterate. What do you plan to do?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Uhhhhh, plan? I don't actually uh--
AIDE 2
Reading classes, plain and simple. By the mayor's order, Officer Barbrady is on temporary leave of absence to learn to read, effective immediately.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Yes, that's right. It's back to school with Officer Barbrady!
[Cameras snap away to South Park Elementary. There's someone new...]
MR. GARRISON
Now, children, we have a new student joining us today. Please say 'hi' to Officer Barbrady.
[Silence. Officer Barbrady dwarfs the children as he sits among them.]
STAN
I can't see, dude!
MR. GARRISON
Okay now, since our focus has been on reading, let's review some of the basics.
[Officer Barbrady raises his hand.]
MR. GARRISON
E-yes, what is it?
OFFICER BARBRADY
I need to go poopies.
MR. GARRISON
[Pause.] Officer Barbrady, in school we go to the bathroom before and after class.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh, Christ. How do you kids do it?
MR. GARRISON
Now, does anyone have any suggestions where we should begin with Officer Barbrady?
KYLE
How about a brain transplant?
[Barbrady raises his eyebrows.]
MR. GARRISON
Now, Kyle, let's be supportive of our new student, give him the nurturing environment he needs to thrive. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence and I want us all to help Officer Barbrady read it.
[Stan struggles to see what Garrison is writing: Oprah Winfrey has huge knockers.]
MR. GARRISON
Give it a shot, Officer Barbrady.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Ahhh... O... O--
MR. GARRISON
Bzzzt! Wrong! Try again, dumbass! Hahahahahahaha [Slaps his thigh.] hahahaha! [Wipes his forehead.] Okay, okay. Maybe we should try something a little easier. We can work our way up to the hard ones.
[Mr. Garrison turns around and writes something more on the board: The hat is red.]
MR. GARRISON
Go ahead, Barbrady, don't be scared.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Ahhh... O...
MR. GARRISON
Bzzzt drrrrr! Did you hear that, Mr. Hat?
MR. HAT
I sure did, Mr. Garrison. What a retard!
[Mr. Garrison starts laughing uncontrollably.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
[To the children] Did you kids actually learn how to read this way?
STAN
No, we just fake it to shut him up.
MR. GARRISON
Okayheh, okay hi'm sohry. I'm sohry heh. Let's try again.
[Chicken coop. The chickens are clucking away when the door creaks open. A silhouette appear.]
INTRUDER
So, what are nice chickens like you doing in a coop like this?
[He grabs a chicken and...Cut to South Park Elementary, back in class.]
MR. GARRISON
Now, children, I hope you all had a good time reading your books and are prepared for your book reports.
[Cartman squirms in his seat and whispers.]
MR. GARRISON
Who should we have go first, Mr. Hat? Let's see...
CARTMAN
[In falsetto.] Oh, how about Stan? Or Kyle?
MR. GARRISON
Eric, why don't you go first?
CARTMAN
Oooaaagh.
MR. GARRISON
What's the matter, Eric? Are you not prepared again?
CARTMAN
I'm prepared!
[Cartman gets up and walks to the chalkboard, then faces the class.]
CARTMAN
For my book report, I read The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. It was very, very good. Have you read it, Mr. Garrison?
MR. GARRISON
No, I can't say that I have.
CARTMAN
Oh, good. In The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, a bunch of uh, hippies, walk around and paint stuff. They eat lunch, and then they find a magical... camel... which they have to eat to stay alive. And that's pretty much it; I give it a B-minus.
MR. GARRISON
And I give you an F, Eric. Now sit down!
CARTMAN
God-dammit!
[The kids start laughing at him.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Haa haa. Ha ha ha.
MR. GARRISON
Okay, Officer Barbrady, why don't you give us your book report?
[Officer Barbrady rises and goes to the board then faces the class.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
I've just finished reading the heartwarming novel, Go, Dog. Go!. I found it a compelling and disturbing look at the canine psyche. If I may read a passage: "Big... dog..., little... dog. [Turns the page.] A red dog... on a..." Well, anyway, I'm not one to give away the ending, but I will say that it spirals toward an incredible twist-turn that parallels my own life.
MR. GARRISON
Thank you, Officer Barbrady. That was a very good book report indeed. I'll give you an A.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Hooray!
CARTMAN
[Miffed.] Goody two-shoes.
[The Playground. The camera pans across the playground. It passes Craig holding a Blue Mega Man, Bebe and Clyde on the hobby elephants, the boys passing a ball among themselves, and stops at the swings. Barbrady swings between Kenny and Red.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Swingset, swingset, up and down I go
"Whoosh!" goes the willy-wind, flowing through my toes
[Kyle looks looks back at Barbrady.]
STAN
Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much.
KYLE
Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Swingset, swingset, up and down I go...
[Mayor McDaniels walks up with her aides.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Officer Barbrady, what are you doing?!
[He quickly gets off the swing, but in so doing he stresses the set and launches Kenny...]
KENNY
(Daaarrrggghh--)
[Kenny flies into the brick wall at the other end of the yard.]
KENNY
(-ooggghhh...)
STAN
Oh, my God! They've killed--
KENNY
(Hey.)
STAN
Oh, never mind. [Smiles.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Well, how's the reading coming along?
OFFICER BARBRADY
[Wringing his hands.] Oooh, pretty good.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Barbrady, we really need you to speed this up. The Chickenfucker struck again last night.
KYLE
Oh no!.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Ah, Mayor, please, when we're around children we prefer to call him the Chickenlover.
AIDE 2
This time he made love to Carla Weathers' prize chicken. She's catatonic.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Who? Carla Weathers or the chicken?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
The perpetrator left this clue at the crime scene.
[She hands it to Barbrady, who looks it over.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh, I can't read this. It has silent e's.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[Throttling him.] You have to learn to read faster, Barbrady!
OFFICER BARBRADY
I'm doing the best I can. I even got a A on my book report.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Listen, buddy! Either you learn to read quick, or else I'm gonna find a law officer to replace you forever!
[She leaves with her aides. Aide 1 takes the ball from the boys and pops it.]
AIDE 2
Hey, what'd you do that for?
AIDE 1
Uh, just dramatic effect, sorry. [They leave.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh boy, I'm in big trouble.
[The boys surround him.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
I'll never learn to read fast enough, and the town is in chaos.
STAN
It's cool, dude. We'll help you.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Hey, that's right. You can help me. Under article 39, section 2 of police code, I'm allowed to deputize citizens in a time of crisis.
CARTMAN
Really? I wanna be a cop.
OFFICER BARBRADY
You boys will be my deputies; you can help me restore order, catch the Chickenlover, and swing me on the swingset.
[This last idea he likes a lot.]
CARTMAN
Do I get a nightstick?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Sure, nightsticks for everybody!
[He hands his night stick to Cartman, who smiles.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
You keep a tab on crime in the city, and we'll try to solve the Chickenlover case.
CARTMAN
10-4, sergeant! [Walks off.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Now, what did that clue say again?
STAN
"If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft".
OFFICER BARBRADY
To the Booktastic bus, deputies! We haven't a moment to spare!
STAN, KYLE, KENNY
Hooray!
[Booktastic bus. Barbrady and his new deputies enter.]
BUS DRIVER
Good day, friends. Welcome to the magical world of reading.
OFFICER BARBRADY
We need a copy of Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft right away!
BUS DRIVER
Oohhh, that's a very magical book, full of wondrous--
OFFICER BARBRADY
Aw, just give us the damn book, fruitcake!
[The bus driver retrieves the book and hands it to Barbrady. He opens it.]
KYLE
What's it say?
OFFICER BARBRADY
It says, "Mmmuh mmmuuh..." Uh, what's this word? [Points out to Stan.]
STAN
I.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh, yeah. "I... mmuh mmuh--"
KYLE
Here, give me that. [Takes the book.] "I am Bumbly Wumbly. I live in the pond."
STAN
A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond.
OFFICER BARBRADY
That's quick thinking, deputy. Let's get to Stark's Pond immediately!
[Downtown South Park. The streets are desolate, and only the sound of squeaking pedals. Suddenly, Eric pops over a low hill on his Big Wheel tricycle and goes down Main Street. The bike has been souped up with a motorcycle windshield and signal lights. He's wearing aviator sunglasses. A car passes by him.]
CARTMAN
Ey!
[Cartman activates his siren, the driver sees him in the rear view mirror and pulls over. He gets off his trike, comes to the door, and taps the driver-side window with the night stick. The driver turns and lowers the window: it's Stan's father, Randy Marsh.]
RANDY
Uhh, yes, Officer?
CARTMAN
I clocked you at 40 miles an hour back there. Do you know what the speed limit is heawh?
RANDY
Well, according to that sign right there, it's 40 miles an hour.
CARTMAN
Step out of the car, please, sir.
RANDY
Wait a second. Aren't you Stan's little friend?
CARTMAN
[Slower.] Sir, step out of the car, please.
RANDY
[Steps out.] Yeah. You're the one who always plugs up the toilet at our house.
CARTMAN
Ey! I am a cop, and you will respect my authoritah!
RANDY
Yeah, right. You'd better get back to school, little boy.
[Cartman swings his nightstick at Randy's shins and connects.]
RANDY
Ow!
CARTMAN
Get your ass to jail!
[He continues to swat him on the legs with the baton.]
RANDY
Ow! Hey, what the hell are you doing? You can't do that! Ah-ow! Ah-ow! Ow!
CARTMAN
[Getting carried away.] Sweet.
RANDY
Ooww!
[Stark's Pond. A crowd is gathered at the crime scene. The chicken is fluttering about. Barbrady arrives with Stan and Kyle.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh, weak, dude! We're too late!
STAN
Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind.
FATHER MAXI
Well, this is terrible! Now, who would have sex with a chicken?
HALFY
[Mischievously.] I would. [Everyone looks at him.]
MR. GARRISON
Aw, you couldn't screw anything, Halfy. You don't have any legs!
HALFY
Oh... yeah. [He moves away on his fists.]
FATHER MAXI
Have some respect for people's feelings, would you, Halfy?!
OFFICER BARBRADY
Come on, dudes. We need to look for another clue.
[Kyle finds it and holds it up high in the air.]
KYLE
Here! Here, I found one!
STAN
What's it say? What's it say?
KYLE
It says, "Read Teetle the Timid Ta-- Taa-- The Taxi--" What's this word?
STAN
I dunno.
OFFICER BARBRADY
[Taking the note.] "Ta... ta... Taaguh-- Taxi-dermist." [Everybody cheers.] I read it! I read it all by myself! [Grins.]
HALFY
[Doing flips.] Hooray, yeah! Whoo!
[South Park at night. Cartman is doing a segment for COPS.]
DISPATCHER 2
Five George is en route to 496 Broad Wasteland...
CARTMAN
Yeah, I've been working this beat for about three days now. You definitely have to have pretty thick skin or else these people, they just walk all over you. [The camera checks out traffic.] Sometimes you have to go undercover to get the worst of them.
[Cartman is working a street, dressed in a hot-pink dress and fishnets. A car stops.]
DRIVER
[Winking.] Hi there, little lady.
CARTMAN
Well, hi there.
[Cartman lowers his shades and bats his eyelids.]
CARTMAN
Uh, wha-what are you doing tonight?
DRIVER
Well, hopefully spending some time with you, gorgeous. Is $20 enough?
CARTMAN
Sir, step out of the car, please.
DRIVER
[Stammers.] What? Oh-oh-uh, is this a bust?
CARTMAN
[Displays his badge.] Sir, step out of the car.
DRIVER
[Stepping out.] Hey, wait a minute. You're just a kid!
CARTMAN
[Pulls out his baton.] Maybe this'll teach you to listen to authoritah.
[Cartman starts beating him on the shins.]
DRIVER
Ow! Oo-uhow! Ow! Hey, man, what are you doing?! Ow, stop it!
CARTMAN
[Exhales.] Yeah... Sometimes upholding the law is messy. But you get by. One day at a time.
[Outside South Park Library. Three people walk by with looted stuff.]
LOOTER 3
I got a TV.
LOOTER 4
Shh. Come on!
[Inside, the camera zooms in on Barbrady.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
[Reading from the book.] "Tee-tle the timid taxidermist... loves..to..." Oh, goddamn, reading is lame!
[Stan and Kyle arrive.]
KYLE
How's it goin', dude?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Terrible! I give up! I'm not fit to be a cop! Booohoohoohoohoo, booohoohoohoohoo.
STAN
Come on, dude, it's not that hard!
OFFICER BARBRADY
It is, too!
KYLE
Just read the sentence.
OFFICER BARBRADY
"Teetle the timid taxidermist loves to go to the pet-pet--"
KYLE
Come on, dumbass, you can do it!
OFFICER BARBRADY
"Pet--" Wait a minute. [Recalls Garrison.]
MR. GARRISON
Conjugate the verb. Conjugate the verb.
MR. HAT
Yes, conjugate the verb.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Pet-ting. Petting zoo. He loved to go to the petting zoo! Boys, we're off!
[Downtown. In another segment of Cartman's for COPS...]
DISPATCHER 3
All units, all units. Five-twelve at 635 Avenue de los Mexicanos; request assistance.
[The siren goes on. Cut to Kenny's house. Cartman arrives and jumps off the bike, makes his way to the front door, and knocks. Stuart opens the door.]
CARTMAN
Sir, could you step out of the car, please?
STUART
We're fine, officer. [Sips his beer.]
CARTMAN
And-uhh who's, who's in here with you?
STUART
Just me and my wife and my brother. And my wife's cousin and his son and my brother's girlfriend and our two kids--
[Kenny and Kevin come to view.]
KENNY
(Hi, Cartman.)
STUART
--and my brother's girlfriend's mother, and this guy Bob, who I met last year.
CARTMAN
[To the camera.] Poor people tend to live in clusters.
STUART
[Takes a swig of beer.] What—What did you say?
CARTMAN
Nothing. Now, sir, is there some kind of a...
CAROL
I want him out of my house! He ain't worth a shit! He can't even hold a fuckin' job!
STUART
Shut up, bitch!
CARTMAN
Okay, okay, let's try to watch the language; there's children present heuh.
CAROL
You lazy-ass motherfucker!
STUART
Look what she did to my fuckin' eye.
CAROL
I'll do it again!
[She kicks him in the ass and continues hitting him. Kenny just laughs at the sight.]
KEVIN
Mom hit Dad again!
[Both then continue laughing at them.]
CARTMAN
Now, the first thing to do in domestic disturbance calls like this one is to just calm everybody down. Respect my authoritah!
[He jumps up and knocks Carol down, then Stuart. He then concentrates on Stuart. Kenny and Kevin keep laughing.]
STUART
Aagh!
DISPATCHER 1
All units. All units. We have a 5-20 on the suspect. Report to the South Park petting zoo immediately!
CARTMAN
[Stops, gasps.] Chickenlover!
[The petting zoo. The school kids mill among the animals.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Keep your eyes peeled, boys. Somebody's gonna make love to this chicken any minute.
[The chicken blushes.]
STAN
Maybe we were wrong about the clue.
KYLE
Yeah, maybe you read it wrong.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh, no!
[Rustling is heard.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Shhh!
[They turn around. A hand reaches down and plucks the bird away.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Keep your eyes peeled.
[They turn around.]
STAN
Look!
[Feathers are flying out from behind a bush as the bush moves around.]
KYLE
He's here!
OFFICER BARBRADY
Grab him!
[All three rush the bush, meanwhile in Downtown South Park, Cartman is racing towards the zoo.]
CARTMAN
Dammit! Can't this thing go any faster?!
[Reaches for a doughnut and bites into it.]
[The petting zoo. Barbrady is wrestling the Chickenlover as Kenny arrives. Barbrady finally gets his man. It seems to be the Booktastic bus driver, and he pulls out a pistol. As Barbrady takes it from him, it fires and hits Kenny.]
STAN
[Gasps.] Oh my God, they've killed--
KENNY
[Gets up.] (Oh, it was only my jacket.)
STAN
Goddammit!
OFFICER BARBRADY
I knew it was you all along, Richard Nixon!
STAN
Aw, I think that's a mask, dude.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh.
KYLE
Whoa, dude! It's the bookmobile driver!
OFFICER BARBRADY
Caught you red-handed!
BUS DRIVER
Indeed, you did. How did you know I would strike here?
OFFICER BARBRADY
By reading Teetle the Timid Taxidermist.
BUS DRIVER
You did?! Really?! Then it worked! My whole plan worked absolutely perfectly! [Pleased.]
STAN
What are you talking about, dude?!
BUS DRIVER
When I heard that Officer Barbrady couldn't read, I knew I had to motivate him somehow. So I formulated a plan to encourage him to learn the magic of reading!
KYLE
So you fucked a bunch of chickens?
BUS DRIVER
Yes! Yes, exactly! Don't you see? Only by fucking chickens could I get Officer Barbrady to become literate.
STAN
That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude.
BUS DRIVER
Oh, no? He who was blind can now see!
[No reaction from the kids.]
BUS DRIVER
I got Officer Brabrady to read. My plan worked perfectly.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, I guess I should say "Thanks?"
BUS DRIVER
You're welcome. And now, my reading friend, you've proven that you are ready for the big time. I give you this hardback copy of Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand.
CARTMAN
[Rushing up.] Freeze! Put your hands in the air!
KYLE
Cartman!
CARTMAN
I got reports that the suspect is in this area!
KYLE
Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens.
CARTMAN
A-ha!
[Cartman hits him with the baton.]
BUS DRIVER
Ow, that hurts!
KYLE
Whoa, dude!
STAN
Cartman!
[Officer Barbrady picks Cartman up and takes the baton from him.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
No, no, that's not how you uphold the law! [He puts him down.]
CARTMAN
Well, he is not listening to my authoritah!
BARBRADY
Oohhh, ohh, you've got it all wrong, my little friend. You do it like this: [Paf.]
BUS DRIVER
[Going down, squealing.] Heee--!
BARBRADY
You've gotta get 'em in the head; they go down quicker.
[Cartman looks at the driver and removes his shades.]
CARTMAN
Ooohhhh.
KYLE
I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?
BARBRADY
Well anyway, I'm relieving you of your duties. I've proved that I can read, and now I'm back on the job!
[He spins the cylinder on his pistol.]
STAN/KYLE
Hooray!
[Cartman watches as Barbrady leaves the petting zoo, Stan calls out to Barbrady.]
STAN
Hey! So what are you going to do now?
BARBRADY
Now? [Turns around.] Well, I-ee uh... I think I'll get in the bathtub, and then curl up with a good book.
[He displays the book for a moment, then holds up his right thumb for the camera to see. The end credits begin to roll, but only the executive producer is listed. The boys watch for a moment more, then walk off to the right. The chicken just walks around pecking at the straw. A bunny hops across the yard and Bebe chases after it.]
[Newscast.]
ANCHOR
And so today South Park held a parade to honor Officer Barbrady and his heroic work on the Chickenfucker case.
[Tape is shown of the parade. Confetti is flying everywhere. The South Park High School band is marching before Barbrady's car. He is in the car with Stan, Kyle, and Cartman.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Thank you, everybody. Thank you.
MAN 1
Speech! Speech!
OFFICER BARBRADY
[Lowers his arms.] What?
STAN
They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh. Okay, uh... Well, first of all I'd like to thank the town of South Park, the town that bore me and eventually will rob me of my life precious.
[The town cheers.]
MAN 2
Oh, yeah!
OFFICER BARBRADY
Second, I'd like to say to all those out there who think they can screw chickens just to teach people to read, your days are numbered! [More cheering.] And finally, I'd like to say that [Enunciating.] reading totally sucks ass!
STAN/KYLE
Hooray!
OFFICER BARBRADY
Yes, at first, I was happy to be learning how to read. It seemed exciting and magical. But then I read this: Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. I read every last word of this garbage, and because of this piece of sh-shit, I'm never reading again!
STAN, KYLE
Hooray for Barbrady!
[The crowd cheers again.]
KYLE
Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!
CARTMAN
Ey, that's what I've been saying all along, you guys.
STAN
I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back.
KYLE
It's poetic justice.
OFFICER BARBRADY
[Leaning forward.] Thanks, boys.
[The end credits roll again, this time normally. When the producer is listed, Kenny is shown in a clear area behind the crowd. A tree falls, flattening him.]
KENNY
(Ow!)
[Blood oozes from under the tree. End credits continue, showing more scenes from the parade.]
End of Chickenlover


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:When the boys find out what it means to be circumcised, they try to save Ike from his Bris. The school counselor Mr. Mackey is fired and experiments with drugs.

script:Ike's Wee Wee

[South Park Elementary, Garrison's classroom.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, let's take our seats. This morning we're going to have a special lecture by your school counselor, Mr. Mackey.
[Mr. Mackey passes in front of Garrison and gets ready to speak.]
STAN
[Imitating the counselor] Booooo!
MR. MACKEY
Nuh-now, who was that?
[No one speaks.]
MR. MACKEY
That is not appropriate behavior, m'kay?
STAN
[Mimicking] I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?
MR. MACKEY
Uh... That's okay, just don't let it happen again.
KYLE
[Following Stan's lead.] We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?
[The others laugh.]
MR. MACKEY
Uh, okay, okay, that's fine.
CARTMAN
M'kay?
MR. MACKEY
M'kay. [More laughs.] Now, uh, as your counselor, I'm here to tell you about drugs and alcohol and why they're bad, m'kay? Uh, so, first of all, uh, smokin's bad.
[Writes "smoking" on the board.]
MR. MACKEY
You shouldn't smoke. And-uh, alcohol is bad.
[Writes "alcohol" on the board.]
MR. MACKEY
You shouldn't drink alcohol. And-uh, as for drugs, well, drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. M'kay, that about wraps up my introduction, now uh, are there any questions?
[Stan's hand is up.]
MR. MACKEY
Yes, Stan?
STAN
Why do dogs have cold noses?
[Stan points to the center of his face, where his nose should be.]
MR. MACKEY
Uhhh, well, I'm not sure.
STAN
Oh.
MR. MACKEY
Now-uh, let's focus our discussion first on marijawana.
[Writes "marijuana" on the board.]
MR. MACKEY
Marijawana's bad, and it also has a very distinct smell, okay? I'm gonna pass around just a little tiny bit. Now, I want you all to take a smell,
[Pip takes the Petri dish with the marijuana leaf in it and just looks at it. The others look at him.]
MR. MACKEY
...so you know when someone is smoking marijawana near you. M'kay, just take a smell, pass it on,
[Pip sniffs at it, then passes it back to Bill.]
MR. MACKEY
...and when it gets back up to me,
[Bill sniffs at it.]
MR. MACKEY
...we'll finish talking about it. In the meantime, I want to get into alcohol a little, okay? Uh, alcohol is bad. Uh, if you drink alcohol you...
KYLE
Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?
STAN
Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?
KYLE
No, it's his bris.
CARTMAN
What the hell is a "bris"?
KYLE
I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band.
CARTMAN
Oh, kick ass! I wanna have a bris!
MR. MACKEY
...and so uh, that's why alcohol is bad. Uh, ha-has that marijawana made it back up here yet?
[No answer from the class.]
MR. MACKEY
No? O-okay. Let's talk about LSD.
[Mr. Mackey writes "LSD" on the board.]
MR. MACKEY
Uh, children, LSD i-is bad. It's a drug made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney...
STAN
Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?
KYLE
Uhhh... I'm not sure.
STAN
Well, dude, you better find out!
MR. MACKEY
Boys, are you paying attention?
STAN
Sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?
MR. MACKEY
Okay. Now, children, has that marijawana made it around yet?
[No response.]
MR. MACKEY
Uhh, who-who has the marijawana now?
[Stan blinks.]
MR. MACKEY
Ummm okay, whoe-whoever has the marijawana, just pass it up to the front row, m'kay?
[Not a thing.]
MR. MACKEY
Woh-oh.
[Principal Victoria's office.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I am very disappointed in you, young man. You should be ashamed of yourself. What could have possessed you to be so stupid? [Thumps the desk.]
MR. MACKEY
I'm sorry, Prinshipal Victoria.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
We-hell, "sorry" isn't going to cut the cheese this time, mister! I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend you from school.
MR. MACKEY
You mean I'm fired?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, I guess that's the grown-up way to put it, yes.
MR. MACKEY
But-but it was an honest error of judgment, m'kay? I-I really thought it was important for the kids to know the smell of marijawana--
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
It was an error of judgment, Mr. Mackey, but I'm afraid I have to let you go for it. We searched each one of those kids, but came up empty.
MR. MACKEY
But--
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
We had to let them go home, and one of them now has half a lid of Jamaican grass because of you!
MR. MACKEY
Huh, how am I going to make ends meet...m-[Sniff.]m'kay? Wha-what will I do for money??
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
There, there, now. Maybe this will all blow over someday and we can give you a job as a janitor cleaning up vomit with that pink sawdust stuff.
MR. MACKEY
[Sobbing.] No-uho-uho-uho! [Sniff.] Not o-uho-uhokay!
[Bus stop. The kids leave the bus and Mrs. Crabtree peels away screaming.]
MRS. CRABTREE
AHHHHHHH!!!!
STAN
Man! That sucked, getting searched.
[They walk off together.]
CARTMAN
Yeah, my ass is killing me.
KYLE
Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us.
CARTMAN
I wonder who took it.
[Mr. Garrison's house. He's looking drowsy watching Teletubbies']
ANNOUNCER
And now it's almost time for BoBo's.
[The Teletubbies move around whirring all the while. Garrison laughs softly.]
[The boys are walking home when Chef drives up to them.]
CHEF
Hello there, children.
BOYS
Hey, Chef.
KYLE
How's it going?
CHEF
Bad.
KYLE
Why bad?
CHEF
Children, I heard about what happened at school today. Now, none of you took that nasty marijuana, did you?
STAN
No, dude, we never even saw it!
CHEF
Okay. Because I just want to tell you that drugs are bad!
STAN
We know, we know, that's what everybody says.
CHEF
Right. But do you know why they're bad?
KYLE
Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits.
CHEF
And do you have any idea what that means?
KYLE
No.
CARTMAN
I know. Drugs are bad because if you do drugs, you're a hippie, and hippies suck.
CHEF
Look, children. This is all I'm goin' to say about drugs: stay away from them. There's a time and place for everything, and it's called college. Do you understand?
BOYS
Dude!
CHEF
Okay. [Starts to move.]
KYLE
Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend?
CHEF
[Stops.] Oh, hell no! I can't bear to see that!
STAN
What do ya mean?
CHEF
Don't you boys know what a bris is? They're going to circumcise him.
CARTMAN
Wo-what's that?
CHEF
Oh boy. Here we go again.
[The boys wait.]
CHEF
Children... Uhh... What's the one thing that's more sacred to a man than anything else in the world?
STAN
Ahhh, bicycles?
CARTMAN
Ham?
KYLE
No, not ham, you fat fuck!
CARTMAN
Screw you! It's ham, isn't it?
CHEF
No, no, no, children, I'm talkin' about the most important part of a man's body.
KYLE
Your heart?
STAN
Your eyes?
[Chef slaps his hand to his forehead in disbelief.]
KENNY
(Ooh, the penis!)
CHEF
That's right.
CARTMAN
Hey! My mom says you're not supposed to call it a penis, Kenny! You're supposed to call it a fireman.
CHEF
A "fireman"?
CARTMAN
That's the proper way to say it, or else you get a spanking.
CHEF
Dammit, children! Why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you?
[Chef starts up his car. The radio comes on.]
CHEF
Ask your parents for once!
KYLE
Hey, wait!
[Chef drives away.]
STAN
Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good.
[Mr. Mackey is walking the streets of South Park, quite depressed. A car pulls up and the driver honks twice. Mr. Mackey looks to see who it is.]
FEMALE PASSENGER
Hey, Mackey, you got any more pot? My four-year-old needs a fix! Yehahahahaha!
[They drive off. Bill Allen's father pulls up in a small truck.]
MR. ALLEN
Hey, Mackey! Now we see what you and Homer Simpson have in common, d'oh-pe! [Peels away.] Ha ha ha ha!
[Mr. Mackey resumes his sorrowful walk. A blue car pulls up.]
DRIVER 2
Heeey, Mackey!
DRIVER 3
Hey, Mackey! Why did the drug user cross the road?
DRIVER 3'S PASSENGER
Who do you think you are, you stupid drug-taking hippie?! You damn hippies are all alike!
DRIVER 4
Won't you leave the guy alone?
[Traffic is building up. Horns blow.]
DRIVER 5
Hey, hippie, are you gonna do some drugs?
MR. MACKEY
Uuuuuugh!
[Quickly drops into a bar and takes a seat.]
BARTENDER
Hey, I don't think I've seen you around here before.
MR. MACKEY
Naw, I just-- I had to get away, m-m'kay? I just lost my job.
BARTENDER
Oh that's weak, man. You know what you need? You need a good, stiff drink.
MR. MACKEY
Oh-uh-uh, I don't drink, m'kay?
BARTENDER
Trust me, man! It'll make you feel better.
[Places the mug before him.]
MR. MACKEY
Ughuh... [To himself.] Drinkin's bad.
DEVIL
[Poof.] Go ahead. Drink the beer. It'll calm you down.
ANGEL
[Poof.] Yeah, why the hell not? It's just a beer. Don't be such a pussy, m'kay?
[Mackey takes the beer and drinks most of it.]
[Poof. The angel and devil are gone.]
BARTENDER
So how do you feel?
MR. MACKEY
[Burp] Woah, about the same.
BARTENDER
Oh, you just need something a little stronger.
[Serves up some Scotch whiskey.]
[The boys minus Stan are at the curb working on an ice sculpture of South Park.]
STAN
[Rushing up.] Kyle! You have to stop them!
KYLE
Stop who?
STAN
Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!
KYLE
What?
STAN
They're gonna chop off his wee wee!
[Kyle's jaw drops. For a moment he's dumbstruck.]
KYLE
Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?!
STAN
Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!
CARTMAN
Dude! That is not cool! Choppin' off wee wees is not cool!
KYLE
That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that!
STAN
Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris.
CARTMAN
Dude, yuh-eh-you just don't...chop off somebody's fireman!
KYLE
I won't believe it! I won't! I have to ask my mom and dad!
[He leaves for home. The others follow.]
[Mr. Mackey is walking down the street, drunk, singing Pat Benatar's "Love is a Battlefield"]
MR MACKEY
We are young, m'kay?
Heartache to heartache we stand, m'kay?
No promises, no demands, m-m'kay..?
[Mr. Mackey approaches front door of his house; he places his key into the lock but fails to fit.]
MR. MACKEY
Whoa... Is this my house?
LANDLORD
[Smoking a cigar.] Your key ain't gonna work, Mackey! I changed the locks!
MR. MACKEY
Why, Mr. Freely?
MR. FREELY
I'm not rentin' to you anymore! I heard that you got fired from your job for selling drugs to children!
MR. MACKEY
No, no, no, m'kay? I-it wasn't like that.
MR. FREELY
Drugs are an illegal narcotic! And having never taken drugs, I can say that they have nothing to offer!
MR. MACKEY
But I've never taken drugs either.
MR. FREELY
I've never taken drugs, and look at me! I'm totally fine! Now get off my property before I lose control and kill you!
[Mr. Freely takes out his cigar and throws it away.]
MR. MACKEY
Huuhh?
[Freeley throws a rock at Mackey, which strikes him on the left side of the head, and Mackey falls.]
MR. MACKEY
Ow, m'kay?!
MR. FREELY
Drug user! Druuug user!
MR. MACKEY
[Struggles to get up.] Uh, uh--
[Mr. Mackey tries to dodge the rocks Freeley is chucking at him.]
MR. FREELY
Come back here, dammit!
MR. MACKEY
Whoa, wait!
[Mr. Mackey ends up running away, meanwhile at Kyle's home. Decorations for the bris are going up.]
SHEILA
Just a little higher.
[The boys arrive.]
KYLE
Mom! Dad!
SHEILA
Oh, hi, bubele. I'm glad you're here; you can help decorate for the party.
GERALD
Your mother's made gahekgafuga.
CARTMAN
What the hell is gahekgafuga?
KYLE
Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for?
SHEILA
To celebrate your little brother's [Ike claps.] passage into life.
KYLE
Meaning what?
GERALD
Meaning we're going to circumcise him. [Kyle gasps.]
CARTMAN
They are gonna cut off his fireman!
SHEILA
It's Jewish tradition, bubbe.
GERALD
Normally, we do it right after the baby is born, but we had to do it later for Ike because he's a--
KYLE
AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!
[Kyle rushes into his room. The boys stare at Kyle's parents agape with their jaws dropped for a moment.]
GERALD
Oh, now what's gotten into him? Stan, will you go talk to him?
[Stan is stiff. In his vision, the parents become dæmons with Gerald holding shears.]
SHEILA, GERALD
Let us cut off you pee pee, Stan!
STAN, CARTMAN
AAAAGGGGHHHH!!!! Aaagg-that's the sickest friggin' thing-run, ruuun!
[Kenny pulls his hood closed.]
KENNY
(Run, dude!)
[All three run into Kyle's room.]
SHEILA
Oy, what is the matter with them?
[Kyle's bedroom.]
KYLE
I can't believe my parents are cannibals!
STAN
What are you goin' to do, dude?
KYLE
I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!
[He jumps out the window.]
KYLE
Come on, Ike!
[Ike jumps off and into Kyle's arms.]
KYLE
Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back.
CARTMAN
No way, dude! We're not staying alone in your house with your wee-wee-choppin' parents!
KYLE
Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike!
[Cartman and Stan look at each other, scared.]
[A dark alley. Mr. Mackey is sleeping under some pages from a newspaper.]
MR. MACKEY
Hoh! I can't sleep; it's too cold, m'kay?
HOBO
Hey, you want somethin' to warm you up?
MR. MACKEY
[Startled.] Oh, I didn't know this dark alley was taken.
HOBO
[Holds out a joint.] Here, try this; it'll warm you up.
MR. MACKEY
Marijuwana's bad.
HOBO
What?
MR. MACKEY
Ma-marijuwana makes you feel depressed and low, m'kay?
HOBO
And you don't fell that way now?
MR. MACKEY
Oh, good point.
[Mr. Mackey takes the joint and inhales it deeply, then holds his breath a bit, then relaxes.]
MR. MACKEY
No, I don't feel any d-oooohh...
[Psychedelic music plays in the background.]
MR. MACKEY
Oh, baby, get down, m'kay?
HOBO
Uh-huh.
[The alley brightens up and takes on neon hues.]
MR. MACKEY
Man, this alley is cool! It's so alive and beautiful! [He drops the joint.]
HOBO
Ohh, boy.
[Meanwhile, at the South Park Train Station.]
KYLE
Come on, Ike, hurry up! [Ike babbles.] Where is the next train going?
CLERK
Lincoln, Nebraska; train leaves in five minutes.
KYLE
You wanna go to Nebraska, Ike?
IKE
No!
KYLE
I need one ticket for my little brother.
CLERK
That's a little brother? I thought it was a trash can or something. What's wrong with his head?
KYLE
Huh?
CLERK
I'm sorry, but we just can't throw Caucasian babies on an outbound train.
KYLE
But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong!
CLERK
What?! Why the hell would they do that?
KYLE
They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses.
CLERK
No can do, sonny.
KYLE
Dammit!
[Kyle walks away with Ike to the train and spots an open door from a freight car. The departing bells sound.]
KYLE
Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train.
[The train whistle blow and starts to pull away.]
KYLE
Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!
IKE
Don't kick the--
[Kyle kick him into the car.]
KYLE
Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!
IKE
Bye-bye.
[Some woods near the town, daytime. Mr. Mackey is dazed and confused. A Seinfeld-esque riff plays.]
MR. MACKEY
Oh, man, where am I?
TEEN 1
Hey, wow, it's that counselor from elementary school, Mr. Mackey.
TEEN 2
Wow, dude.
MR. MACKEY
Uh, hi, boys, how are you today?
TEEN 1
Pretty good, man. How are you?
MR. MACKEY
Oh, I've been better. I've been kicked out of town for doing drugs.
TEEN 1
Hey! Us, too!
TEEN 2
Yeah, remember? You caught us smoking weed in the bathroom and got us suspended.
MR. MACKEY
Oh. O Fortune, how you mock me?
TEEN 1
Oh, cheer up, bro; all you need is some clear liquid to get your head straight.
MR. MACKEY
Uh-uh, boys, LSD is bad. Hmmm...
[He opens the bottle and lets a drop go into his mouth. The boys watch. Mackey's voice becomes distorted.]
MR. MACKEY
Man, who put all this cotton in my mouth?
[Psychedelic music begins to play as his head inflates.]
MR. MACKEY
Yeah, baby... The world is so small.
[His head pops off his body and floats away.]
MR. MACKEY
I'm free... I'm free...
TEEN 2
Sweet dude, totally killer.
TEEN 1
That guy's totally trippin'.
[Mr. Mackey's head floats on, smiling.]
[Bus Stop. Kyle has met the boys there and is working on a doll.]
KYLE
There, what do you think?
CARTMAN
What the hell is that supposed to be?
KYLE
I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner.
STAN
Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike.
KYLE
Not when if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away.
[Sylvester runs up, having smelled the doll's contents.]
KYLE
No, go away! Bad dog!
STAN
Dude, what did you make that doll out of?
KYLE
I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.
CARTMAN
Is that why it stinks so bad?
[Mackey's head flies past.]
MR. MACKEY
Hi, boys.
BOYS
Hi, Mr. Mackey.
MR. MACKEY
Are you boys stayin' out of trouble?
BOYS
Yes.
MR. MACKEY
Okay, I-I'm just gonna go over here for a while.
[Mr. Mackey's head floats away.]
KYLE
Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.
[Sylvester returns, growling as he sniffs the doll.]
KYLE
Knock it off, asshole!
CARTMAN
No way! I'm never going back to your parents' house!
STAN
Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you.
[Stan, Kyle, and Kenny leave.]
CARTMAN
Eech.
[Starts to walk, but then stops.]
CARTMAN
Wait a minute! No, you wouldn't!
[Train Station. The train comes to a stop. A door opens, and Ike is booted out.]
IKE
Oh.
[Ike lands on his head, then flips upright.]
IKE
Oooh.
[A couple stops by.]
WOMAN
Oh, would you look at that, honey? Somebody dropped off a perfectly good trash can. [The couple leaves.]
IKE
Yeah. No more walbolching!
[Ike skips away into the corn fields nearby.]
[Kyle's house. The boys return from the bus stop.]
SHEILA
Bubbe, where have you been? Dinner's been ready for five minutes.
KYLE
Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky.
[Kyle rustles the doll a bit.]
SHEILA
How is my little jellybean?
KYLE
[Doing Ike.] Bye-bye seeme mama. [As himself.] Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up.
[Sylvester has found the house, and is seen looking from behind two pine trees.]
SHEILA
Okay, but first let Mommy give you a kiss.
[The boys flinch.]
KYLE
No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him.
[Sheila withdraws as Sylvester leaps in and eats the doll from Kyle's hands.]
SHEILA
Aaaaargh! Omigod, make him stop!
GERALD
AAAGGGHH!!!
KYLE
Put him down, you stupid dog!
SHEILA
My baby! Oh, God, the horror!
[Sylvester is chewing the doll's head to pieces.]
GERALD
Get out of here, you mutt! Let him go!
[He moves to chase Sylvester away. Sylvester bites into the doll and runs off with it. The boys can only stand with jaws dropped.]
SHEILA
[Frantically.] Ooooohhhhhhooh-ho! Oooh, my baby! Bubbeleh mine!
[All of them gather at the front porch. Sylvester is munching away on the doll in the middle of the street.]
SHEILA
Waagghh!!
[A truck driver is sleepily driving down the road, but he does see Sylvester.]
SHEILA
My baby!!
DRIVER
Huuh?
[Steps on the brakes, but hits the dog.]
GERALD, SHEILA
Aaaggghhh! Aaagh aaagghh!
[The gas tank behind the cab cracks open like an egg, then explodes, killing the driver and Sylvester.]
SHEILA
[Tearful.] Oh, he's dead, he's dead! My little bubbeleh's dead!
GERALD
There, there, Shei-hla. There's nothing we can do.
[Stan and Cartman look at Kyle, who puts his hands behind his back with a guilty expression. Cartman's mad at him.]
[Cemetery. Ike's casket is being lowered into the plot. Present at the funeral are the Marshes and the Broflovskis, Jimbo, Ned, Barbrady, a piper, and the priest, with a kippah on his head and a scarf on his shoulders.]
FATHER MAXI
"Yea, usher us unto the Lord", sayeth some Jewish guy once. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
[He throws some ashes into the grave. As the piper plays Hava Nagila, everyone covers their ears. They go their separate ways.]
KYLE
Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it?
[Headstone reads: "Ike Moisha Broflovski 1996-1998, Born a Canadian, died an American".]
SHEILA
Well, bubbe, there's something you have to know. Ike wasn't really your brother, he was adopted.
KYLE
What??
GERALD
He was not really a Broflovski, he was Canadian. But we loved him all the same. [He starts to sob]
KYLE
You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!
SHEILA
What are you talking about?
KYLE
Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska!
[The boys turn right and walk away.]
SHEILA
What-what-whaaat?!
STAN
Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!
CARTMAN
Fireman!
KYLE
Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility.
[Kenny falls into an open grave.]
KENNY
(Hey!)
[The spiked tombstone falls in.]
KENNY
(Hey, you guys! I'm dy--)
[The tombstone hits its mark. The grave is deep. Stan hears the impact and turns.]
STAN
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
KYLE
[Flatly] You bastards.
[Kyle keeps walking. The crowds reconvenes, this time for Kenny's funeral.]
FATHER MAXI
[Removes kippah and scarf.] "Yea, let us ponder the Lord's mercy. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."
[The piper plays Hava Nagila again.]
[Somewhere in South Park, after the funeral. Jimbo and Ned pass Mackey on the sidewalk. Mackey's eyes are bloodshot. Jimbo and Mackey bump shoulders.]
JIMBO
Get outta the way, you damn hippie!
MR. MACKEY
[Annoyed] I don't need to take you right-wing authoritative bullshit!
JIMBO
What?
MR. MACKEY
Aw, you're just like the government, man! Trying to prosecute outta one side of your mouth, m'kay, while supporting guns outta the other, m'kay?
JIMBO
Aw, why don't you go to a Grateful Dead concert? [He and Ned leave]
MR. MACKEY
I can't, man. Jerry Bear's dead, m'kay?
BLONDE
He-e-ey, man, I overheard what you said; that was coool!
MR. MACKEY
What? Oh, thanks, man.
BLONDE
Would you like to come over to my place and finger-paint?
MR. MACKEY
[Getting mellow.] Sure, man. Finger-paintin's cool, m'kay?
[They walk off together. Lincoln, Nebraska, train station. The Broflovskis get off the train, Kyle first.]
SHEILA
Now, where did you leave him, young man?
KYLE
Aw, how the hell should I know?
SHEILA
Gerald! Do something about your smart-ass son!
GERALD
Uhhh... Mind your... mother, smart-ass.
SHEILA
If we don't find him, so help me, you're gonna be grounded for a month!
[Gerald peeks into a trashcan.]
SHEILA
Ike, love?
KYLE
[Grousing.] All the time: "Look out for your little brother, Kyle!", "Take care of your little brother, Kyle", and he wasn't even really my little brother.
GERALD
Kyle, just because Ike is adopted doesn't make him any less your brother.
KYLE
Yeah, right.
[Sheila puts down a bench she was looking under as a clerk approaches.]
SHEILA
Excuse me, we're looking for a two-year-old Canadian boy.
CLERK
Two-year-old Canadian boy, two-year-old Canadian boy... Oh, I think they might have one of those down at Haps Bar.
SHEILA
[Gasps.] Come on!
[Haps Bar. The Broflovskis enter and scan the room, Ike is being used as a base at one table. The camera pans back to him. Sheila rushes over to him and throws the table top off to get him.]
SHEILA
Ike!
IKE
Mamatoedoe.
BARKEEP
Hey, lady, that's my table post! You can't have that!
[Mr. Mackey and the blonde are in bed admiring the finger-painting they have done all over the room, including the ceiling.]
MACKEY
Wow, man. You know, it's like… You go through life thinking that you're an individual, m'kay? And then you realize that you're more than that, m'kay. We're all just one big individual, m'kay?
BLONDE
Let's get married and have a honeymoon in India.
MACKEY
[Gives it some thought.] M'kay.
[Mr. Mackey removes his tie and his head deflates to a normal state.]
[Kyle's house.]
GERALD
Now you march to your room, and you think about what you've done!
SHEILA
But first, apologize to your brother!
KYLE
[Pointing at Ike.] He's not my brother!
GERALD
Apologize to him!
KYLE
[Angrily.] I'm sorry, Ike.
[Kyle turns around and walks off.]
IKE
Uh oh, stufid.
[Kyle goes into his room and closes the door. Ike is saddened.]
[Somewhere in India, Mackey and the blonde are hiking. Elephants bathe in the river below them.]
BLONDE
Wooow, this is sooo beautiful!
MACKEY
[A dove alights on his right arm.] I am one with the animals. And the trees.
BLONDE
And I am one with you. [They reach for each other.]
MR. MACKEY
At long last I have found
A true reason to be
Now I feel I can start anew--
[Mr. T flies onto him and pins him. Hannibal and Face come and pick him up, then all three rough him up.]
MR. MACKEY
Woo, whoa! Ow! Hey!
[They carry him away.]
MR. MACKEY
Uh oh hel-m. Hey!
BLONDE
[Subdued.] Whoa...
MACKEY
[As Mr. T tosses him into the A-Team van.] Yeah I got, m'kay?
[Inside the van. Jimbo is driving, with Ned sitting next to him. Mr. Mackey sits between Mr, T and Mr. Garrison.]
MR. MACKEY
Uh-- What the hell is going on?!
JIMBO
Tough love, Mr. Mackey. We're taking you to rehab.
MR. MACKEY
I don't want to go to rehab! I haven't even done drugs in weeks!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
We were wrong for shunning you, Mr. Mackey, and we apologize. We should have realized that you needed help.
MR. GARRISON
Yeah, and now we're gonna make sure you get the help you need.
MR. MACKEY
I don't want help!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
You'll thank us later.
[They drive off into the distance. Meanwhile at Kyle's House, the big day is here. Guests are arriving.]
SHEILA
Hello, Tom. Hello, Patty. Thanks for coming to Ike's bris.
IKE
Uh oh.
SHEILA
Look Ike, It's Uncle Murray!
UNCLE MURRAY
Hello, Ike! Say, where's little Kyle?
SHEILA
He's been sent to his room for being a bastard. He's decided that Ike isn't his brother, since he's adopted.
[Uncle Murray moves off.]
GUEST
Hi there!
SHEILA
Hello. Do I know you?
GUEST
Uh-no, but I never miss a bris. Here, I brought some dip. [Gives it to her.]
SHEILA
Ohhh, thanks.
[Kyle's room. The boys are gathered there.]
CARTMAN
Well, I guess the chopping is about to commence.
[Ike enters the room with a photo album.]
IKE
Oh deh family nrr.
KYLE
What do you want?!
IKE
I wumuh trecompr. Com. Tebruhnerr.
[He opens the album, which reveals pictures of Kyle and Ike. Tender music plays. Kyle looks. The first one has Kyle holding Ike, while the second one has Ike riding on Kyle's elephant.]
KYLE
Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian!
STAN
Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude.
KYLE
No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie.
[Ike pulls the album down a bit.]
IKE
Cookie Monster, [flips some pages] two, three, four, five.
[The third one: Kyle and Ike tossing a football. The fourth one: a family portrait. The fifth one: Kyle, with Ike in his walker. The sixth one: Kyle giving Ike a bath.]
KYLE
Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you!
IKE
[Now sporting one of Kyle's caps.] Baraterndr nfard fy. [Kyle looks. Pause.]
[Betty Ford Clinic. Inside...]
SOCIAL WORKER
You have to admit you have a problem before anyone can help you.
MR. MACKEY
But I don't think I really have a problem.
SOCIAL WORKER
Nonsense! You did drugs! I suppose you forgot all about your family.
MR. MACKEY
I don't really have a family.
SOCIAL WORKER
And you lost your job.
MR. MACKEY
No, I lost my job before that.
SOCIAL WORKER
Mr. Mackey, you're supposed to be an adult.
[Nearby, the two teens are on a sofa watching the Teletubbies.]
SOCIAL WORKER
The problem with drugs is that people forget to stop doing them. There's a time and a place for everything, Mr. Mackey, and it's called college! Now, I want you to repeat after me: Drugs are bad.
MR. MACKEY
Drugs are baad.
SOCIAL WORKER
Drugs are bad.
MR. MACKEY
Uhh... Dru-drugs are baad.
[More guests arrive for Ike's bris. Ding-dong.]
SHEILA
Hello, Dr. Schwartz! Thank you so much for coming all this way to perform Ike's bris.
DR. SCHWARTZ
Oh, my pleasure, Sheila. I brought the normal cutting device, but then I remembered that Ike was Canadian, so I brought the right one.
[The incisive hole is maple leaf-shaped.]
DR. SCHWARTZ
Where is the little rug rat?
SHEILA
Right over here.
[She takes him over to Ike.]
DR. SCHWARTZ
Come 'ere, you.
IKE
Oowwww!
[Ike skips away into Kyle's room.]
IKE
Oh deh faminrr.
[Ike hops over to Kyle. They look at each other as the doctor calls.]
DR. SCHWARTZ
Ike? Ike?
[Ike jumps up and hugs Kyle.]
IKE
Heh cohcoh mondefern menurr.
[Ike hugs him tighter, and Kyle is moved.]
DR. SCHWARTZ
There you are. Come on Ike, it's time.
[Kyle recovers and gets angry.]
KYLE
You stay away from my little brother!
DR. SCHWARTZ
[Stammers.] Bu-bu-but, son, I just--
KYLE
You aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo!
SHEILA
[Now in the room.] Kyle, what are you talking about?
KYLE
And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!
CARTMAN
[A bit solemnly.] Yes. The fireman is very magical. If you rub his helmet, he spits in your eye. [Stan draws a blank.]
DR. SCHWARTZ
Kyle... a-a circumcision is a very common thing for Ike to have. His father had it, his grandfather had it, and...
[Dr. Schwartz points at Kyle.]
DR. SCHWARTSZ
...his brother had it.
[Cartman and Stan gape.]
KYLE
No! No, it isn't true!
DR. SCHWARTZ
We're not going to cut it off! We're just goin' to snip it, so it looks bigger.
[Stan and Cartman wonder.]
STAN
Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!
CARTMAN
Heyeah, I want to get a circumstision, too. [Kyle looks up.]
[Betty Ford Clinic. Mr. Mackey and the social worker exit the main building.]
SOCIAL WORKER
Congratulations, Mr. Mackey. You are fully recovered.
MR. MACKEY
I can't thank you enough for everything, m'kay? I feel like my old self again.
SOCIAL WORKER
Just one more thing.
[She sets his tie in place, and his head inflates to its original state.]
SOCIAL WORKER
Remember that you can stay sober.
MR. MACKEY
I will, Ms. Social Worker. I will. [They embrace one last time.] M'kay?
[Kyle's house. Everyone is gathered for the bris.]
KYLE
It's okay, Ike. I'm here.
DR. SCHWARTZ
And-a one and-a two and-a... bris. [Snip.]
IKE
Ouch. Buh-buh-buh-buh.
[Cartman and Stan faint. The adults clap. He skips over to Kyle.]
IKE
Cookie Monster.
KYLE
[Gets up.] Ike, you're okay. [Cartman and Stan get up.]
STAN
Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad.
KYLE
Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about.
STAN
Yeah.
KYLE
And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family. [Tugs on Ike and moves away.] Except for Cartman.
STAN
[Follows.] Naturally.
CARTMAN
Eah, screw you guys! I don't wanna be in your penis-choppin' family anyway!
[Monday morning, Mr. Garrison's class.]
MR. GARRISON
And so now, children, your school counselor is back, to tell you firsthand about his nasty experience with drugs and alcohol.
[Mr. Garrison makes way for Mr. Mackey.]
MR. MACKEY
Okay, kids? Uh, you shouldn't do drugs, m'kay? Drugs are bad. You see, I was at the bottom of the barrel. I was a wreck; why, I didn't even care about money. I was-I was wasting my life...
[Mr. Garrison slowly shakes his head.]
CARTMAN
Hey, you guys wanna come to my bris tomorrow?
STAN
You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine.
CARTMAN
No way, I set up mine first, hippie!
MR. MACKEY
Now boys, you need to listen up, m'kay? Wha-what I'm talkin' about might save your life someday, m'kay?
STAN
[Mimicking.] Okay, Mr. Mackey, okay?
MR. MACKEY
M'kay.
KYLE
M'kay?
MR. MACKEY
M'kay.
CARTMAN
Okay?
MR. MACKEY
Okay.
[The camera slowly pulls away.]
MR. MACKEY
Now, as I was sayin, uh... drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. Eh, uh if you do them, you're bad. Because drugs are bad, m'kay? It's a bad thing to do drugs. So-uh so don't be bad, by doing drugs, unkay? That'd be bad, 'cause drugs are bad. M'kay?
End of Ike's Wee Wee

synopsis:South Park citizens declare a "Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week" to help the school nurse. The school's dodgeball team goes to the championships with Pip as their star player.

script:Conjoined Fetus Lady

[South Park Elementary Gym.]
CHEF
Okay, children, it's Friday, and you know what that means for PE class. We're gonna play dodgeball!
[The class groans.]
KYLE
We don't wanna play dodgeball. It hurts.
STAN
Yeah.
CHEF
So let's have half the children on this side [To his right.] and half the children on that side. [To his left]
[Team 1 walks to one side. The children groan.]
PIP
[Uncertain.] Uhh... Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. I don't believe I know how to play dodgeball.
CARTMAN
[With Clyde and Stan looking on.] What? Don't you have dodgeball in France?
PIP
Well, no. And actually, I'm not from France--
STAN
Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball.
PIP
Oh, dear.
STAN
If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins.
PIP
Oh, what jolly good fun!
KYLE
No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school.
[The teams are as follows:
Team 1: Kyle, Clyde, Kenny, Stan, Cartman, Pip, Annie, Butters, and Brimmy
Team 2: Bill, Fosse, Kevin, Bebe, Red, and Terrance.]
CHEF
[Blows his whistle.] Play ball!
[Kevin takes the ball and chucks it at Stan's team. It hits Clyde.]
CLYDE
Ow! Ahow-ow-ooooowww!
KYLE
Dammit, we lost one already!
CHEF
Aheeheh, you're out, Clyde! Heheheh.
STAN
Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup.
[Annie (Jordan) and Butters (Swanson) pull forward as told to. Kevin throws again, and it hits Annie, causing her to scream and be knocked out.]
STAN
We're losing men fast out here!
[He and Kyle jump out of the way as the ball sails towards Brimmy, who falls and lets out a grunt of pain. The ball returns to the opposing team.]
CHEF
[Giggling.] Concentrate on your ge-hame! Be the buhaw-hall!
[Kevin serves again, and Kyle looks away as it comes towards him, amazingly Kyle opens his eyes to find the ball is in his hands.]
KYLE
I caught it! I caught it!
CHEF
Great catch, Kyle! Now your team's on offense!
KYLE
Here, Pip, you throw.
[Kyle tosses the ball to Pip, who catches it.]
PIP
Ugh... Oh, no, I couldn't.
KYLE
Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pansy your whole life?
PIP
I'm not French--
KYLE
Throw the ball, you stupid frog!
[Pip sets up to throw.]
KYLE
Goddamn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants,
[Angered, Pip throws the ball at him.]
KYLE
you'd be able to-- Ow! [He falls.].
CHEF
Okay, that was pretty good, Pip, but you're supposed to hit the kids on the other team.
KYLE
Ow, my nose! You broke my nose!
CARTMAN
Damn, Pip. I didn't know you had it in you.
PIP
Ogh! I'm dreadfully sorry!
CHEF
That nose is bleeding pretty bad, Kyle. I think you might have to go to the nurse's office.
[Fear strikes the kids.]
KYLE
[Gasp.] No. No, it'll be okay!
CHEF
Sorry, son. You'll have to let the nurse look at it. Come on.
[Chef takes him by the hand, and leads him away to the nurse's office.]
KYLE
Oh-- Noooo!
CARTMAN
[Ominously.] Dude! He's going to the nurse's office.
CLYDE
I heard the school nurse is hideously deformed.
BEBE
I heard she has tentacles and eats children for lunch.
CARTMAN
Stan? Has anybody actually seen the nurse, and come back to tell about it?
STAN
[Somberly.] No, Cartman. Nobody ever has.
[Nurse's Office. Kyle's shadow is on the window. He waits with his hand on his nose. He sees a mouse nibble at some cheese and run away. He looks up, and a door opens. Kyle looks and shuts his eyes tight.]
NURSE GOLLUM
Are you Kyle Broflovski?
[She sounds friendly, but her shadow falls on him.]
KYLE
Ye-yes.
NURSE GOLLUM
I'm the school nurse. Did you hurt your nose?
KYLE
Ye-yes.
NURSE GOLLUM
Young man, Why do you have your eyes closed? I'm not gonna hurt you.
KYLE
I know.
NURSE GOLLUM
So open them.
[She walks to her left, Kyle resists, then opens them.]
KYLE
Oh! Phew.
NURSE GOLLUM
Now, what seems to be the problem?
KYLE
Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball.
NURSE GOLLUM
Oh. Well, I'll get you an ice pack.
[She turns to face him, and a withered fetus comes into view. It is joined to her left temple and upper cheek.]
KYLE
AAGGGGGHHHH!!
NURSE GOLLUM
What?
KYLE
OOOOOHHHHH MY GOD!!
NURSE GOLLUM
Oh, I see you've noticed my disorder. I have a stillborn fetus growth attached to my head.
KYLE
AAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!
[After school, at Kyle's house. The boys are there to listen to Kyle's story.]
KYLE
...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled.
BOYS
Eewwww!
CARTMAN
Did it talk? The little fetus, did it talk?
KYLE
No. No-it looked dead.
BOYS
Eewwww!
STAN
Wa-was it wearing clothes?
KYLE
Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?
STAN
Oh, yeah. Eeww.
BOYS
Eewwww!
KYLE
And then she walked over to--
SHEILA
Kyle! That is enough! I've been reading up on your poor nurse's condition, and it is nothing to be made fun of. It's called "conjoined twin myslexia".
CARTMAN
Who the hell cares what it's called? As long as she doesn't have to touch me...
SHEILA
Now, that's just the kind of unawareness that we need to fight against. Sit down, boys.
[They hop on the sofa. She sits in the middle and opens the book. Softly, she reads.]
SHEILA
You see boys, sometimes, when babies are born, they're born as twins. But sometimes the twins get hooked together, and they're born as Siamese twins.
[A picture of two adults attached by the side of the head is shown.]
THE BOYS
Gross!
SHEILA
But sometimes, after the Siamese twins are joined together, one of the twins dies before birth. The living baby is born with the dead baby still attached.
[Stan is frightened.]
SHEILA
Sometimes, this dead twin is inside the living person, so even you could have a dead twin inside you and not even know it!
[Now, Cartman is frightened. He and Stan rush out of there.]
STAN
AGGGGGGHHHHHH!
CARTMAN
AGGHHH! Let me live! AGGGHHH!
SHEILA
So now that you're educated about her disease, you won't need to make fun of her. Right, bubbe?
KYLE
Uhhhh... Yeah.
[She leaves, and Kyle's eyes follow her. Then he looks forward, then at Kenny. Kenny cracks up.]
[The dining room. Sheila serves dinner to Gerald as he reads the newspaper.]
SHEILA
Can you imagine that poor, poor woman?
GERALD
Mm-hmm.
SHEILA
Feeling like an outcast, being ridiculed every day...
GERALD
Mm-hmm.
[The phone rings and Sheila answers.]
SHEILA
Hello?
SHARON
Hello, Sheila? It's Sharon, Stan's mother.
[Stan is screaming and running around the house.]
SHEILA
Oh, yes. Hello, Sharon.
SHARON
Sheila, I was just wondering if you might know why my son is trying to split his head open with an ice pick?
[Randy chases him down.]
STAN
No! I have to get it out!
SHEILA
Well, Sharon, I was just trying to educate them about conjoined twin myslexia.
SHARON
So this is your fault.
STAN
ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!
RANDY
Dammit, stop.
[Stan slips from his grasp and he falls.]
RANDY
Oh!
[Gets up and chases him.]
RANDY
Dammit!
SHARON
Would you do me a favor? Next time you want to scare the hell out of my child, just go outside and sit in the road until a truck runs you over instead?
[Click. Stan runs by again, still screaming and pursued by Randy. Sheila is left with a dial tone.]
SHEILA
[Undaunted.] That does it! I must educate the entire town about this awful disease!
GERALD
Mm-hmm.
[South Park Elementary Gym.]
STAN
[To Cartman.] Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?
CARTMAN
Yeah. I thought we only played on Fridays.
CHEF
[Arriving with a letter.] Children! Great news! We've been asked to play in the State Finals for dodgeball!
ALL
Awww...
STAN
Aw, do we have to?
KYLE
Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?
CHEF
You-you don't understand, children. If we can win State, we can play in the Nationals in Washington, D.C.!
CARTMAN
Heyh! They have a zoo there!
CHEF
That's right! Now, come on! We have a lot of practicing to do!
[The class separates into teams.]
STAN
Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?
KYLE
Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?
PIP
I'd love to!
CARTMAN
Now, let's try not to send anyone to that monster nurse this time, Frenchy.
PIP
Hey! I get quite disturbed when you call me that! You shouldn't make fun of foreigners.
[He turns and walks away.]
PIP
And besides, I hate French people.
[Chef blows the whistle to begin play. Fosse throws, and Bebe is beaned. The foursome look at her, then laugh while Pip observes.]
[Principal Victoria's office. She's meeting with Mr. Mackey and Sheila.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, Mrs. Broflovski, it certainly is a thrill seeing your cheery face again. What seems to be pissing you off today?
SHEILA
Nothing is pissing me off! I just wanta start a movement.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
O-of course you do.
SHEILA
I want to talk to you all about your school nurse.
[Principal Victoria and Mackey are surprised.]
MR. MACKEY
Uh, Nurse Gollum is absolutely qualified to be a--
SHEILA
No, no no. I'm not upset about her. I want to make the public aware of her. Her disease should be brought to light so that it can be understood rather than made fun of.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh, and uh, what disease is that?
MR. MACKEY
Uh, Principal Victoria, Nurse Gollum has conjoined twin myslexia.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
What's that?
SHEILA
She has a dead fetus attached to her head.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[Gasp.] She does?
MR. MACKEY
Y-you never noticed that?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
No-o, I never did.
SHEILA
Well, that's exactly what I'm talking about. This poor woman is forced to live in the shadows because she feels like an outcast. It is up to us to make her feel comfortable and welcome in our town!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Did you say a fetus, sticking out from her head?
SHEILA
I want to invite your nurse to a dinner party at my house this evening. I'd appreciate it if both you and Mr. Mackey would attend.
MR. MACKEY
Do we have to eat kosher stuff?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, I'll talk to Nurse Gollum, but I'm sure she'll be delighted. Let's say around 8:00?
SHEILA
Wonderful!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Now, you did say she has a fetus on her head?
[A mountain road. The class is on its way to the State Finals.]
CHEF
[Rising.] Okay children. [Encouraging] Now, who's gonna win the State Finals?
[The kids just look at him.]
CLYDE
Denver?
CHEF
Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!
Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!
[The kids just look at him. He looks back, then turns to Ms. Crabtree.]
CHEF
I think we need to get off on this exit.
MRS. CRABTRE
SIT DOWN, KID!!
CHEF
But it's quicker to get to the Denver school that way!
MS. CRABTREE
DO YOU WANT AN OFFICE REFERRAL?!
CHEF
How many times do I have to explain this to you?! I'm not a student! You can't give me an office referral, and-!
MS. CRABTREE
I SAID SIT DOOWWN!!!
CHEF
[Sits down.] Yes, ma'am.
[The kids arrive at Denver Elementary.]
STAN
Whoa, dude, this is a school?
[The crowd is cheering. Cows fans are scattered among the crowd.]
BOB THOMAS
Hello, there. I'm Bob Thomas, the coach for the Denver Cougars.
[He slaps Chef on the back.]
CHEF
I'm Chef, coach of the South Park Cows.
BOB THOMAS
Well, I certainly want to thank you for bringing your team down. Apparently, nobody else would play us, because they knew we'd just beat 'em silly. So I told the school board to find me some hick school from the mountains, and here you are.
[Chef is pissed.]
BOB THOMAS
You're from South Park, yeah?
CHEF
[In a low tone.] Yeah.
BOB THOMAS
My G-hod, amazing where people can live nowadays. Well, we might as well get this over with; we've gotta start thinking about D.C. Promise we won't make it too painful.
[He slaps Chef on the back again and leaves. Chef wonders, then gets mad again as the whistle blows.]
REFEREE
Play ball!
[Dinner at the Broflovski house. Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, and Nurse Gollum are there, with her conjoined fetus out of view.]
SHEILA
So, uhh, where did you get your degree, Nurse Gollum?
NURSE GOLLUM
Colorado State.
SHEILA
Ahhh.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh.
[They resume eating in silence.]
GERALD
Sheila, could you pass me the dead fetus?
[Sheila looks at Nurse Gollum, then glares at Gerald.]
GERALD
I mean, gravy.
[Sheila kicks him on the shins.]
GERALD
Ow!
[Denver Elementary. The Cougars are serving. Player 1 throws the ball, and it hits Tolkien, who goes down.]
TOLKIEN BLACK
Ow!
[The Cougar fans cheer.]
CHEF
Dammit, come on!
[Clyde, Butters, and Kevin are already out.]
CHEF
Somebody catch the ball!
[Only Pip and the Boys remain.]
BOB THOMAS
All right, boys, just five more of the little bastards to go!
[Player 1 serves again, and the ball hits Cartman in the belly where it gets stuck.]
CARTMAN
I caught it, I caught it!
PLAYER 1
Oh, that's not fair! He's so fat, it stuck in his belly!
REFEREE 2
South Park on offense!
CHEF
Great job, children! Just stay focused now.
KYLE
Go for it, Pip.
[Kyle tosses the ball over to Pip.]
PIP
Oh, bother.
KYLE
Come on, you Frenchy little frog!
PIP
Gagghh!
[Pip hurls the ball at the other team and knocks down players 1 and 13.]
CHEF
Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Great shot, Pip!
[Back at Broflovski's.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Eh, sooo, I hear that the South Park Cows are playing for the State Finals in dodgeball tonight.
MR. MACKEY
Yeah, but you know, it-it doesn't matter though. The-the Denver team always wins, m'kay?
GERALD
Oh, I don't know. I think our boys might just have the dead fetus to win-- Heart!
SHEILA
Gerald!
[Sheila smacks him off his chair.]
SHEILA
Keep your damn mouth shut!
NURSE GOLLUM
I-it's okay, Ms. Broflovski. Really.
SHEILA
[Exhales.] Please forgive us. I-I'm terribly sorry, Nurse Gollum.
NURSE GOLLUM
No, I'm quite secure with it.
SHEILA
I have felt so bad ever since I heard the boys making fun of you--
NURSE GOLLUM
They're just young boys. Joking is a way for them to come to terms with what they don't understand.
MR. MACKEY
Could I get some more pork?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
So did you ever think of just, you know, having it cut off?
NURSE GOLLUM
Yes, Principal Victoria, the thought had occurred to me. Unfortunately, it would mean my death.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Ooohh, so I suppose that's out. Uh-how about a hat, then?
NURSE GOLLUM
No, really, I don't need a--
SHEILA
Yes, we could get you a few hats and wear a different one every day. No big whoop.
NURSE GOLLUM
I really appreciate what you're trying to do here, but it's not necessary. I'm a pretty happy person.
SHEILA
I've got it! We could set aside a whole week to make the public aware of folks just like you.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Ooohh, yeess, a Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week. You know, that has a nice ring.
NURSE GOLLUM
But I really don't think--
MR. MACKEY
Th-the school could put out pamphlets, m'kay? And we could have seminars to educate, m'kay?
SHEILA
Ooooh, this is so exciting! I'm gonna get the mayor on the phone right now!
[Sheila leaves with Mr. Mackey and Principal Victoria. Nurse Gollum and Gerald look at each other. Gerald winces.]
[Meanwhile at the Dodgeball State Finals.]
CHEF
You got just one more, Pip. You get this kid, and we are State Champions.
CARTMAN
Yeah, and if you don't, you're a big dumb-ass European hippie piece of crap.
[Pip gets pissed and winds up.]
KYLE
Get him, Frenchy!
PIP
Gaagghh!
[Pip hurls the ball across the court where it hits player 6 on the nose. The player goes down.]
REFEREE 2
South Park wins!
[Coach Thomas is in utter disbelief as the victory music plays.]
CHEF
We did it, children, we did it! We're going to Washington, D.C.!
PLAYER 6
Uh-hu-hu-hu-howieee!
[A group of parents looks on as an injured player on the opposing team writhes on the floor in pain.]
PLAYER 6
It hur-hurts! Owieee!
[Two clowns come out with a stretcher and place it next to him.]
PLAYER 6
Mommy, it huurts! I-it hur-hurts!
[The clowns do a little jig, and the parents laugh. The clowns place him on the other side of the stretcher, then pick up the stretcher and walk away. The boy is left on the floor. The parents applaud.]
CHEF
Oh, sorry about whoopin' your ass there, Coach!
Oooh, baby, come on
Just whooped Denver's ass
Gonna need some cream for your ass
It's all swollen and red
[Chef dances, and shows off his butt several times. He also turns to make sure Coach Thomas is watching.]
[Meanwhile, at the South Park Town Square.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a great week for South Park. Ms. Hermans has opened the east wing of the library, and our own South Park Cows Elementary School Dodgeball Team is going to the national finals...
[The crowd cheers wildly.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
...where they will undoubtedly be beaten senseless by the Washington team.
[The Broflovskis are not amused. The crowd quiets down.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
But most importantly, this week has brought to my attention a very serious and dreaded disease: conjoined twin myslexia. And so it is in honor of this that I declare this exciting week as Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week!
[The crowd cheer louder.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
And now, let's kick off our week long festivities with the first annual Grand Conjoined Parade!
[More cheering. There are people on rooftops all over the square cheering as well.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Let's hear it for these brave souls!
[The band starts playing festive music. The crowd cheers up and down as Nurse Gollum walks down the street, alone. She looks around and waves.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
What a glorious parade that was! Let's hear it for the parade coordinators!
[Nine men are shown, and they cheer back. Nurse Gollum is now next to Mayor McDaniels at the podium.]
NURSE GOLLUM
You know, Mayor, I really should be accompanying those kids to Washington in case they get hurt. That is my job.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[The mic is still on.] Nonsense. This is your week. You aren't going anywhere.
[Somewhere near Washington, D.C. The bus is going through a lovely meadow.]
CHEF
How much further is Washington, D.C.?
MRS. CRABTREE
SIT DOWN, KID!!
CHEF
I need to know how far it is, lady!
MRS. CRABTREE
I SAID SIT DOWN!!!
CHEF
[Grumbling.] Yeah, whatever, you old, dried-up, fat hog.
MRS. CRABTREE
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
CHEF
I said, "I've always wanted to visit Prague."
MRS. CRABTREE
Oh, me too.
[Clyde munches away.]
STAN
[To Kyle.] Okay, what have you got?
KYLE
Some hadka fish, some gafagga...
CARTMAN
[Quickly.] I got a jelly roll! I got a jelly roll!
[Kenny pulls out a bone.]
STAN
Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect!
[Stan takes one end of a short bungee cord while Cartman holds the other end.]
STAN
Places!
[Stan gives his end to Kyle and takes the jelly roll. He places the jelly roll in the makeshift slingshot, pulls back, and fires away. All three smile as the roll flies forward. It hits Mrs. Crabtree on the back of her head.]
MS. CRABTREE
ARRRRRRGGGGHHHH!!!
[She loses control of the bus as it careens down the road.]
KIDS
Whoa!
KENNY
(Sheesh!)
[A tourist sees the bus coming his way and tries to get out of the way, but the bus crashes into the Vietnam Memorial's right wall, and the engine bursts into flames. He was thrown to one side. The right wall drops down three feet, taking the front end of the bus with it and raising the back of the bus off the ground five feet. Both front doors fall off.]
[Ulysses Grant Elementary. Inside, the gym is filled with championship banners going back to 1987 hang from the rafters. Posters line the walls.]
CHEF
Damn, man. This is the big time, alright.
STAN
Chef, we're hungry.
CHEF
You can eat after the game. You children win this one, and you're National Champions! Then you can go on and play the Chinese.
CARTMAN
My mom says there's a lot of black people in China.
CHEF
What?
REFEREE
Are you Chef?
CHEF
Yeah.
REFEREE
The Washington team has forfeited the game. Congratulations, you're national champions.
CHEF
What? We did it! Children, we won!
KYLE
Wow, that was easy.
ANNOUNCER
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear a round of applause for the new national champions of dodgeball, the South Park Cows!
[Everyone boos as Kyle rushes over to the opposing team.]
KYLE
Hey, why did you guys forfeit?
PLAYER
You mean you don't know?
KYLE
Know what?
PLAYER
Last year's national champions were the Austin Pirates. They played China for the world championship. Only four of them came back alive. Chinese dodgeball players aren't like us.
[A temple scene comes up. A squad of Chinese kids are exercising as their master gives orders. Some of them are being acrobatic, others throw solid kettle-bells at each other.]
MASTER
Bush langli. Woon taun. Waya ching gia!
PLAYER
[Voice-over.] They do nothing but dodgeball, day in, and day out. They use steroids and advanced training equipment to make them, not kids, but animals.
[Each kid is handed a bowling ball, which he or she throws against a brick wall. The wall crumbles further with every throw. The scene fades, and the foursome are standing there, awed.]
PLAYER
Well, good luck. We've got our futures to think about.
[He hops off and leaves as Chef comes over.]
CHEF
Okay, children, back in the bus.
[South Park City Hall. Many people are seated at table waiting for the evening's events to unfold.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
And so, at this honorary dinner we take a look back at our beloved Nurse Gollum and the brave life she has lived. Roll the tape, please, Mr. Garrison.
[He starts up the player. He's in a nice tuxedo. Nurse Gollum is quite embarrassed as she sits with Sharon in the crowd.]
NURSE GOLLUM
Oh, no..!
SINGER
[The video begins.]
You've got the strength, you've got the courage
Even with a dead fetus on your head
You carry on
You fight for tomorrow
Dead fetus or no, you never let go
You're my conjoined-twin-dead-thing-hanging-off-your-head woman
[Scenes from the video:
She's painting her house orange, and annoyed that Garrison is filming it.
She looks out the window, and is annoyed that he is still there, filming.
She's in her office.
She's at the supermarket, annoyed, she's trying to cover the camera lens so Garrison would stop filming.
At the post office, she's trying to shoo him away, she's very angry that he's filming her.
She's on the toilet, and she clamps her legs shut, with hands before them for added security. She's outraged.]
[There are sobs here and there, a smattering of applause.]
BARBRADY
Oh, that was so touching.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[With envelope in hand.] And now, friends, it's time to present the Lifetime Conjoined Twin Achievement Award. This award goes to outstanding conjoined twins who have made a mark on society. And the winner is... [Reaches into the envelope.]
NURSE GOLLUM
[Derisively.] Nurse Gollum.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Nurse Gollum!!
[The room applauds and the spotlight moves from the Mayor to the nurse.]
NURSE GOLLUM
Oh, boy.
JIMBO
[Interrupting.] Excuse me, Mayor, but I just received some news that you might all be interested in.
[Jimbo takes the microphone.]
JIMBO
Our South Park Cows have just beaten the Washington dodgeball team, and are on their way to the world championship in China.
[The crowd erupts in applause, meanwhile somewhere near China. The bus is going down a slope.]
CHEF
Okay, children, now, we're almost to China. I want you all to try and focus on your game.
STAN
But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!
CHEF
Nonsense! If we win this one, we're world champions.
KYLE
But we could get killed!
CHEF
And just what price would you pay for eternal glory?
[Stan and Kyle fall silent.]
CHEF
Just imagine: a big yellow "Dodgeball Champions" banner hanging in the cafeteria! Imagine it!
STAN
Dude, Chef has lost it.
CHEF
You'll be in the news all over the world. South Park will finally have a sport that it's good at. Ohh, children, it'll be glorious!
CARTMAN
So, Captain Ahab has to get his whale, huh?
[Chef looks at him.]
KYLE
Dude, what does that mean?
CARTMAN
I dunno.
STAN
Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese?
[Kevin looks back.]
KYLE
Yeah, you're from China.
KEVIN STOLEY
No, I'm from America. My parents are Chinese.
STAN
Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball!
KEVIN
I have no idea, dude.
CARTMAN
Come on, rice picker!
CHEF
Hey, hey hey!
[Cartman hides his hands.]
CHEF
Children, that's not cool! You don't make fun of somebody because of their ethnicity.
STAN
You don't?
KYLE
But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people.
CHEF
No, no, no, no, no, that's different. I made fun of them because they are from China. You see, it's not okay to make fun of an American because they're black, brown, or whatever, but it is okay to make fun of foreigners because they are from another country.
STAN, KYLE
Ohhh.
CARTMAN
[At the same time.] Oooh, I get it.
KEVIN
[Vindicated.] Yeah.
[The bus has reached the temple. On the side is a banner that reads: Go Cows!]
MRS. CRABTREE
[Slamming on the brakes.] AAAGGGGHHHH!
CHINESE COMMENTATOR
Hiit ita wita great pride, that huwe huwelcome ourn American friend. Now let the...
[He thumps the table, and his partner's mic falls.]
CHINESE COMMENTATOR
...champion of dodgeball be deshide!
[His partner resets the mic, a muscular man bangs away on a kodo drum, and musicians next to him start playing. The crowd cheers, and dancers come up and unfurl streamers.]
STAN
Damn, dude. China's fucked up.
REFEREE
Take places!
CHEF
All right, let's go, Cows! Let's show 'em what we've got!
CHINESE COMMENTATOR
Okay, Tom, rooks rike A-mericans are getting ready to play. I don't suppose they'll have any problems seeing the ball with their big American eyes!
[They laugh.]
TOM
Yeah. Good thing they have those big eyes so that they don't have to rery on that amazing American interrect.
[He laughs.]
CHINESE COMMENTATOR
Oh, you say such things.
TOM
That's a zinger!
REFEREE
Praaayyy braal!
[The Chinese serve. The first one out is Clyde, who tumbles all the way to the wall.]
CHEF
Holy crap..!
[Kyle is hit, twice, before he goes down.]
CHEF
Goddamn...
CHINESE COMMENTATOR
Hey, hey, what do you call white American person with PhD in a physics and-a math?
TOM
Ah, I don't know. What?
CHINESE COMMENTATOR
Stupid American!
[He laughs.]
TOM
Aw, no way!!
[Tom starts laughing.]
[A Chinese player takes aim at Cartman, who turns and runs away squealing. The ball gets him anyway, and he tumbles away.]
CHINESE COMMENTATOR
Oooh, another American is down! It's numbuh-- uuhhh... Oh, I don't know. All American look alike!
[They laugh, as a Chinese player serves and hits Kenny with such force that the ball picks him up and splatters him against the wall, then bounces up and away. Paint falls away and cracks are left in the wall. Blood pours out quickly. The crowd jumps up and cheers.]
STAN
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
KYLE
[Laying on his side and out of breath.] You... bastards...
CHINESE COMMENTATOR
Oooh, my, I haven't seen an American die like that since Abraham Lincoln!
[He chuckles.]
TOM
Dude, that is-a not cool! You're gonna get us into trouble again.
[South Park Town Square. The town is assembled yet again.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Ladies and gentlemen, on this fourth day of Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week, all our prayers are with our little South Park Cows now playing their hearts out in China.
[The town cheers.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Now, join me in saluting our Cows and help make Nurse Gollum not feel like an outcast with our first official Conjoined Twin Myslexia hats!
[One of her aides passes out the hats as an organ plays. Nurse Gollum just watches.]
[Meanwhile, in China, at the Temple, Chef is tending to his injured players. Kyle is hooked up to an IV. The other players are bandaged up according to the severity of their injuries.]
CHINESE COMMENTATOR
And there is-a only a one South Park prayer left.
[Pip stands alone on the court, Kenny is still plastered to the wall behind him.]
CHINESE COMMENTATOR
Still all Chinese prayer. This should be over veerry shortly.
CHINESE KID
Come on! Throw ball!
TOM
Hey, you wanna hear my impersonation of American?
CHINESE COMMENTATOR
Yeah, yeah!
TOM
Ah, okay.
[Tom puts his hands to his eyelids and opens them wide to simulate American eyes, and talks in a deep voice.]
TOM
Hey, I really, really want that. That looks good.
[They have a good laugh.]
CHINESE COMMENTATOR
Hey, hey. Let me try, let me try.
[He sets up with a deep voice.]
CHINESE COMMENTATOR
I'll use my credit card.
[They laugh harder, and he resumes.]
CHINESE COMMENTATOR
Eh-eh-uh... Do you have any non-dairy creamer?
[They both laugh.]
TOM
Yes yes! [Laughs.] Y'all come a-back now, you hear?
[They laugh so hard they fall from their chairs.]
CHEF
[Crestfallen.] Oh, what have I done?
[Cartman comes over and sits next to him.]
CHEF
You know, Eric, I just realized something. I have been obsessed, and obsession isn't good.
[Cartman bites into a chocolate bar.]
CHEF
If we had won the world championship, what then?
[Kevin walks off.]
CHEF
It would only be a bigger letdown the next year if we didn't win! Our lives would have to revolve around dodgeball. Our lives were fine before.
[Cartman farts and tries to fan it away.]
CHEF
Oh, I'm sorry, children. I let it all go to my head. Can you ever forgive me?
[The kids are stunned at this sudden reversal of desire.]
CHEF
Come on, forget this stupid game. Let's go home.
CHINESE KID
Come on! Throw ball!
KEVIN
[Walking over to player 70.] Hey, if you wanna make him throw the ball, say this.
[Kevin hands him a note to read.]
PLAYER 70
Thanks, you American dumbass! [Reads it.] "You French piece of crap! Throw ball!"
[Pip gets angry.]
PLAYER 70
"What's the matter, Frenchy? You got crepes in your ears."
[The Chinese team laughs. Pip gets livid rather quickly.]
PIP
Arrggghhh!
[Pip starts spinning. The Chinese team watches as Pip picks up speed, and the players gasp. Pip releases the ball and it shoots all over the temple stadium, knocking out players left and right, until all of them are down. Pip slows down, and finally stops.]
CHINESE COMMENTATOR
And the winner is South Park Cows!
[Musicians play.]
PIP
Everyone! Everyone, look! I won the game! We're world champions! Mr. Chef, Mr. Chef. South Park is the world champion in dodgeball. Oh, glorious day!
[The South Park team is limping off the court, with Kyle taking his IV along.]
CHEF
Shut up, Pip.
STAN
Yeah, shut up, Pip. [To Chef.] Can we go home now?
PIP
Did you all see? I can't believe I threw such a ball with my own arm. It was--
KIDS, CHEF
Shut up, Pip!
[South Park Town Square. The mayor is on stage.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
As this year's Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week draws to a close, I would like to personally thank all of you for your enthusiastic cooperation.
[The crowd cheers.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Now, let's hear it one more time for our world champion South Park Cows!
[The team is standing behind a low wall with a trophy at one end, next to Chef. Kyle is dressed normally but still bandaged.]
KYLE
What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
And now, let's hear from the woman of the week! The incredible, courageous Nurse Gollum!
KYLE
Agghh!
STAN
Dude, it's the freak nurse!
CARTMAN
Holy crap!
SHEILA
Dammit, Kyle! We've been working all week against that kind of behavior!
KYLE
Well sorry, dude, we weren't here.
NURSE GOLLUM
Thank you, Mayor. I uhhh, wa-I... I don't know what to say; this has been quite a week.
SHEILA
[Wiping away a tear.] She's really touched.
NURSE GOLLUM
What I really wanna say is... well, -egh-- This may sound odd coming from a woman with a fetus sticking out of her head, but... you're all a bunch of freaks!
[The crowd is stunned, Mayor McDaniels takes the mic from Nurse Gollum.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Uhhh, freaks with big hearts! And now--
NURSE GOLLUM
Don't you realize that the last thing I ever wanted was to be singled out?
[Sheila and Father Maxi look betrayed.]
NURSE GOLLUM
I just wanted to do my job and live my life like any normal person, but instead you've made everybody focus on my handicap all week long.
[More people look at each other.]
NURSE GOLLUM
Look, I don't want to be treated different. I don't want to be treated special orh-or treated gingerly. I just want to be ridiculed, shouted at, and made fun of like all the rest of you do to each other.
[People are listening.]
NURSE GOLLUM
And take those stupid things off your heads!
[She turns and walks off the stage.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh, my, what an ungrateful bitch.
SHEILA
Yeah, the nerve of some people.
KYLE
Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool.
STAN
Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter.
CARTMAN
I love you guys.
[Stan and Kyle merely look at him and say nothing.]
CARTMAN
Ah, screw you guys!
End of Conjoined Fetus Lady

synopsis:Jimbo and Ned's efforts to drive up the ratings for their new hunting show threatens to edge out an old favorite, Jesus and Pals.

script:The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka

[A television is on, and a new show seems to be on the air.]
ANNOUNCER
And now back to Huntin' and Killin' with South Park's favorite hunters, Jimbo and Ned!
[Jimbo and Ned are on a studio based on a hunting lodge. Jimbo and Ned each have weapons, Ned's flamethrower is even lit, ready to go.]
JIMBO
Hi, I'm Jimbo Kern, and this here is Ned. Say hi, Ned.
NED
M-hi, Ned.
JIMBO
Arrgh-ha-ha-ha! Now, isn't that great?
[The cameraman give him a thumbs up.]
JIMBO
We have a terrific show for you today: we're gonna kill some elk, and we're gonna kill some mountain goats. Now, the new law passed by Colorado legislature, which Ned and I call "Pussy Law #4", states that we can no longer kill animals in defense.
"PUSSY LAW #4"
NO ANIMAL SHALL BE HARMED,
EVEN IN SELF DEFENSE, UNLESS
SPECIFIC LICENSE AND SEASON IS
IN ORDER. SELF DEFENSE CAN ONLY
BE JUSTIFIED BY EXTREME, PROVABLE
PERIL AND OR DOCUMENTED VISIBLE
BODILY HARM.
In other words, our old line of, "It's comin' right for us"--
NED
It's comin' right for us.
JIMBO
--no longer works. So now, we only kill animals to, quote, "thin out their numbers". If we don't hunt, then these animals will grow too big in number and they won't have enough food. So you see, we have to kill animals, or else they'll die.
[An awkward moment. Jimbo, Ned and the cameraman look at each other.]
JIMBO
Uhh... So roll the tape.
[A trill, and the tape shows a field into which Jimbo and Ned wander.]
JIMBO
Here we are at Schaefer's Crossing, lookin' for some animals.
JIMBO
Lookie, Ned, there's some deers!
[A group of deer looks up and stares at them.]
JIMBO
Quick, Ned! Thin out their numbers!
NED
Thin out their numbers!
[Walks up to the deer and fires up the flamethrower, producing a huge flame. The deer are incinerated where they stand, and their bones crumble.]
JIMBO
Good work, Ned. Now they won't starve.
JIMBO
That sure was a great hunting trip. We saved those deer from extinction.
NED
Mmm-we're environmentalists.
JIMBO
Comin' up next, we're gonna drop some napalm on an unsuspecting family of beavers. And also, try to thin out the numbers of some endangered species.
[South Park Elementary. Class is in session. Mr. Garrison writes "Vietnam" on the blackboard.]
CARTMAN
Mr. Garrison, what's Vietnam?
MR. GARRISON
"What's Vietnam?" A question a child might ask, but not a childish question. Heheheheheheheheheh. Children, for the next few days, we'll be learning all about Vietnam. Chances are that somebody in your own lives was affected by this incredible war.
MR. HAT
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The Vietnam War was sticky and icky.
[Kyle raises his hand.]
KYLE
Mr. Garrison, were you in Vietnam?
[Mr. Garrison frowns as he seems to recall an incident in that war. An injured man is dragged to a helicopter as fresh troops wait to replace him.]
INJURED MAN
Aaawwwgh... Aaawwwgh...
LEADER
Come on, men! Let's go! Jump out of the chopper!
[The class is waiting. Now Mr. Garrison is smiling as the next scene begins. A group of men is seen disrobed and bathing. At the end of it, he laughs to himself.]
MAN 1
Who's next to take a shower?
MAN 2
Me-ee!
MAN 3
I am.
MAN 1
You just took one last week, silly.
MAN 2
Oh, where can I hide this big pipe?
MR. GARRISON
No, I wasn't in Vietnam, but sometimes, I like to pretend I was. Anyway, children, I'm going to assign you all a paper.
CLASS
Awww..!
CARTMAN
Son of a bitch.
MR. GARRISON
I want you all to find somebody in your own life who was in Vietnam and interview them about it.
CLYDE
What if we don't know anybody who was in Vietnam?
MR. GARRISON
Then you get an F, fail the third grade, and have to get a job cleaning septic tanks to support your drug habit.
CLYDE
Oh.
STAN
Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam.
KYLE
Hey, yeah! He and Ned do that stupid TV show.
[Back to Huntin' and Killin, in a special segment...]
JIMBO
And now, time for Jimbo's Mysteries of the Unexplained.
[The letters are wavy and uneven. The boys come to see the taping.]
JIMBO
One of our loyal viewers from South Park sent us some 8mm film of what he claims to be the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Now, as you all know, the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka can supposedly kill you with one horrid gaze. If a person even so much as looks into the frog's eyes, they can be paralyzed, or even die. And this film proves that that frog may very well exist.
[The film plays. Shown is a snowy field, with the camera looking from behind some blades of grass.]
JIMBO
Now watch carefully, you're gonna see the Mexican staring frog.
[Nothing seems to be happening.]
JIMBO
There! There, did you see it? Roll that back again!
[The film is replayed.]
JIMBO
Now, freeze it!
[The film is paused, and there is a very blurry object flying through the air.]
JIMBO
Well, I'd like to know what all you skeptics have to say now! What do you think, Ned?
NED
M-whoa, I'm scared.
JIMBO
Well, be sure to join us next time. Until then...
We're so glad you spent your time with us
While we slaughtered our way through nature's guts
Come again and stay a while
We'll kill a lot more living things to make them bleed
NED
Mm-good night.
CAMERAMAN
A-and we're cut. Great show, guys.
JIMBO
Oh, lookie who's here. My little nephew Stanley.
[The boys approach him.]
JIMBO
So, you're interested in your Uncle Jimbo's big TV show, huh?
STAN
No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there.
JIMBO
Oh. Yeah, we sure were.
CARTMAN
Was it fun?
KYLE
Cartman! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun!
JIMBO
Well, sure, Vietnam was fun. But not like goin-to-the-circus fun, or fly-fishin-in-Montana fun. No, Vietnam was more like shovin' shards of broken glass up your ass and then sittin' in a tub of Tabasco sauce fun.
STAN
Whoa!
JIMBO
Yepper, that's where me and Ned met.
[Flashback to circa 1975, to a beach. A man write something on a notebook as helicopters take turns landing on a helipad below. An amusement park is just to the right, with a carousel and a log ride. A log comes into view with screaming riders. "Time of the Season" by The Zombies, plays.]
JIMBO
I remember I had just gotten off the Ferris wheel.
JIMBO
Oh, boy, what a gorgeous day!
[A bird alights on his upper arm and sings to him. He whistles back.]
SERGEANT
Kern, get over here! The new privates are here. I'm assigning one of them to you as a trainee. Ned Gerblansky.
[The crowd parts to reveal him.]
NED
Ned Gerblansky reporting, sir.
SERGEANT
Thanks, Ned. Now, the bad guys have been spotted about ten klicks north of here. I know that you and Kern are best suited to take them out. Are you up for it?
JIMBO, NED
Sir, yes, sir!
[Actual footage of a helicopter flying off is shown.]
JIMBO
Soon it was all on just me and Ned to win the war for America.
JIMBO
Pass me some more cocoa, will you, Ned?
NED
Certainly. And would you like another muffin as well?
JIMBO
Why the hell not? We're at war.
[Ned hands them over, then sits back, pulls out a cigarette and lighter, and lights the cigarette.]
JIMBO
Hey, you know those things are bad for your throat.
NED
No, that's all lies. I'll be fine. Charlies at 2 o'clock!
[Jimbo studies the troop movements on the ground.]
JIMBO
I see 'em! Drop the bomb!
[Ned pulls the trigger, but nothing happens.]
NED
The bomb's not releasing!
JIMBO
Oh, no!
NED
It won't budge.
JIMBO
Then we only have one option.
[Jimbo forces the plane down.]
NED
What are you doing, man?!
JIMBO
We have to take 'em out, Ned! At all costs! Die, you red commie bastards!
[Comes in for a crash landing, and enemy troops are running out of their way. Jimbo and Ned come out and shoot everyone they can. The enemy soldiers die on the spot. Ned pulls out a grenade to activate and throw at other enemy troops, but it goes off prematurely and takes off his right arm.]
NED
[His arm flies away.] Yaaarrrggghhh!!!
JIMBO
[Firing away.] Aaarrrggghh-- Oh no! Out of ammo!
[Jimbo reaches behind himself and pulls out a sword. A horse with golden mane and tail trots in. Ned fights off the enemy troops with his good arm and martial arts skill, and Jimbo flies onto the horse. He sallies forth and decapitates every soldier he comes across. When the enemy soldiers are all dead, Jimbo puts the sword away, and they look at the corpses around them.]
JIMBO
We did it, Ned! We killed the entire Vietcong Army!
NED
Whoopie.
[Ned brings out a cigarette and lights it with his good hand.]
JIMBO
Let's get back to base camp. We can ride the log ride before it closes!
[Ned flies onto the horse behind Jimbo, and horse and riders leap gracefully away, as we return to the present.]
JIMBO
And that's the way it happened, boys.
STAN
Wow!
CARTMAN
Man, Vietnam was sweet!
CAMERAMAN
[Reading a magazine.] Great news, guys. Your TV show ratings have doubled!
JIMBO
Wow!
CAMERAMAN
They've gone from six people to twelve.
JIMBO
Holy smokes! We could get an Emmy!
[South Park Public Access. The set of Jesus and Pals.]
PRODUCER
We've got to do it, J. Your ratings are being killed by the Jimbo and Ned Hunting Show.
JESUS
But I don't really care about that.
PRODUCER
Wuhell, you'd better care, Mr. Smarty Pants. No ratings means no show. If you want to keep reaching out to people, you have to keep up with the times.
JESUS
[Reluctantly.] Ohh, alright.
CAMERAMAN
Alright, we're ten second to air, guys.
PRODUCER
Remember, big, big, big!.
[She holds up her hands and moves them apart with each 'big.' Then she walks off.]
CAMERAMAN
And five, four, three...
[Spotlight beams dance around the studio.]
ANNOUNCER
[Applause] It's your hour of power on midday Mountain Cable Access. Put your hands together and welcome the only man in town who always has a fully-stocked wine cellar, Jeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-sus Christ!
[Jesus is caught off guard as a spotlight jumps to him.]
JESUS
Uhhh... Hi.
[His producer signals him to build up his intro.]
JESUS
Uh, yeh-yeah, okay. Beginning today, we're taking the show in a new direction.
[A stage hand guides him through with the cue cards.]
JESUS
We've got some very interesting people coming on the show this week for you, our viewers. Today's guest is: TV's Gilligan, Mr. Bob Denver.
[Applause, as the curtains open.]
ANNOUNCER
Here's Booooobbb Denver.
[He makes his way to Jesus. They shake hands and sit down.]
JESUS
Hi, Bob Denver.
BOB
Hi, Jesus. Great to be here.
[His tongue is exposed. There is a pause as they look at each other.]
JESUS
So. Bob. So, yu-you just get in town?
BOB
Yup. Just got in.
JESUS
[Pause.] So... Um... Su-so, wwhat have you been up to?
BOB
Nn-nothing. Nothing really at all.
[The producer cues the studio and to play.]
DISCIPLES VOCALIST
'Nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
You gotta have something
JESUS
[Cynically.] Oh boy.
[South Park Elementary. Stan is presenting his group's report, reading from his notes.]
STAN
"...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp."
[Mr. Garrison is behind Clyde.]
STAN
"Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster."
[Mr. Garrison gets a reaction.]
STAN
"...and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride."
[Mr. Garrison is suspicious.]
STAN
"So was the horror of Vietnam." The end.
THE BOYS
The end.
KYLE
Are there any questions?
[Mr. Garrison raises his hand.]
KYLE
Yes, Mr. Garrison?
MR. GARRISON
Yes. [Suddenly angry.] Where the fuck did you hear this ridiculous load of bullshit?
[The boys' grins vanish.]
STAN
From Vietnam veterans.
MR. GARRISON
Well, boys, it's obvious to me that you didn't do your work, and that you stayed up all night thinking up some ridiculous lie.
STAN
No, no, we didn't--
MR. GARRISON
You all receive an F...minus.
KYLE
F-minus? Can he do that?
STAN
Bu-but we're not making it up, it was--
MR. GARRISON
Stanley, the Vietnam War was war! There weren't galloping steeds or singing birds or log rides.
KYLE
How do you know? You weren't even there.
MR. GARRISON
Well, that's it! All of you have detention for the rest of the week!
BOYS
Aawwww!
[South Park Elementary, cafeteria. Mr. Mackey is supervising detention.]
CARTMAN
Sweet.
MR. MACKEY
Welcome to detention, m'kay? Mr. Garrison told me about your little joke. It's important for you all to know why you're in detention for you to obtain the full benefits from it.
CARTMAN
You're dead, Stan.
STAN
For what, dude?
KENNY
(Just face it, dude, your uncle's stupid!)
MR. MACKEY
[While the boys talk softly.] You're here because you are inferior, m'kay? You are here because you are awkward, m'kay?
CARTMAN
Well, Stan, thanks a lot for having such a cool uncle that got us all detention for a week.
KYLE
Yeah, dude, your Uncle Jimbo sucks ass!
MR. MACKEY
Shh! M'kay?
STAN
Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?
CARTMAN
Well, let's see... Maybe 'cause he's an old, drunk hillbilly dick!
MR. MACKEY
Shh! M'kay?
KYLE
[Pounds the table.] We've got to get him back, dude.
CARTMAN
Totally.
STAN
How?
KYLE
Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing.
STAN
Well, what do you mean?
KYLE
Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy... [Indistinct whisper.]
CARTMAN
[As Kyle whispers his plot.] Sweet. Oh, yeah, sweet. That's super sweet. Ah-yes!
[Jimbo and Ned back on the set.]
ANNOUNCER
And now back to Huntin' and Killin' with South Park's favorite hunters, Jimbo and Ned!
JIMBO
Welcome, hunters. Boy, have we got a show for you today! We have just received a tape from another viewer who filmed the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka right here in South Park.
NED
Aggghhh!
JIMBO
Yes, now we're about to roll the film, but remember: if you look the Mexican staring frog in the eyes, you could go catatonic. We don't know if this applies to pictures of the frog or not, but who wants to take chances? So when we roll this film, be sure to look away.
[Jimbo looks away and shields his eyes with his arm. Ned does the same.]
JIMBO
Okay, roll the film, Tom.
[Tom starts the film and looks away. The footage is that of a fake frog sitting on a doorstep motionless.]
JIMBO
Is it over? Okay, it's over.
[They lower their arms and sit up.]
JIMBO
Well, there you have it. Undeniable proof that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka exists.
[Cartman residence. The boys are watching the show.]
JIMBO
And you saw it here, on The Jimbo and Ned Show.
KYLE
Dude, I can't believe they fell for it!
STAN
Yeah, what a couple of dumb-asses.
KENNY
(Yeah, it's like killing a dead pig and a turkey.)
[They all laugh.]
STAN
Yeah.
KYLE
Come on! We've gotta make another one!
[The boys get off the couch and leave.]
CARTMAN
Lying kicks ass!
[South Park Public Access. Meanwhile...]
PRODUCER
Jesus!
JESUS
Yeah?
PRODUCER
We're in trouble. The Jimbo and Ned Show made up some ridiculous staring frog story and jumped another two points in the ratings!
JESUS
Uh-oh, sssooo what are we supposed to do?
PRODUCER
I don't know. We'll have to continue with the changes we've made, and then go even further.
STAGE HAND
And we're back in five, four, three...
PRODUCER
Remember, big, big, big!
[Jesus and Pals has a new opening sequence, with Jesus walking backwards into view and throwing his jacket over his shoulder. Meanwhile, 'Jesus and Pals' scrolls along the bottom as both his logo drops down from above. His signature blinks here and there. A montage follows with Jesus talking to a monkey in one screen and Jesus waiting for calls in another. The last thing you see is J&P.]
JESUS
If you're just joining us, we've been listening to Michelle's incredible story of survival. Go on, Michelle.
MICHELLE
[Tearfully.] Well, as I was saying, I tried and tried, but my overturned car just won't budge. My husband was trapped for twelve hours.
JESUS
And yet, somehow, he managed to survive.
MICHELLE
That's right. He's a very brave man, and I love him very much.
HUSBAND
[In a wheelchair, head bandaged.] I love you, too.
JESUS
W-well, let's see if the audience has any questions.
[A large woman raises her hand.]
JESUS
Yes, uhh, you over there.
[Jesus walks down to her.]
LARGE WOMAN
I think she needs to kick him to the curb, baby!
[The audience applauds.]
JESUS
Kick who to the curb?
LARGE WOMAN
Her no-good husband! She's got to lose that zero and get herself a hero!
[The audience applauds.]
JESUS
But--
RED-HAIRED WOMAN
He wants to have his cake and eat it, too. He's got to dump that trash girlfriend.
[She grabs the mic.]
RED-HAIRED WOMAN
It's all about respect. You've gotta have respect for yourself.
[The audience applauds. Michelle is shocked, and her husband drools a little blood.]
JESUS
Uuh-I think we've somewhat missed the point here. Let's go to somebody else.
[Jesus backs up to an African American.]
JESUS
Yes, your comments.
MICHAEL JACKSON FAN
Montel, I think we're forgetting something very important in all of this. Okay, sure, he touched some children, but the man is a great singer and he has entertained us for so many years.
JESUS
Wha-what are you talking about?
MICHAEL JACKSON FAN
Michael Jackson. All this baad-mouthin' and puttin' the man down. Maybe he did touch some children now and then, but come on! It's Michael Jackson! Michael Jackson!
[The audience applauds.]
JESUS
Uhh, we'll be back right after these messages.
[In the woods, the boys set up for another staring frog video. Cartman is behind some bushes and Kyle is in front of them. Stan and Kenny face them.]
STAN
Ready, you guys?
KYLE/CARTMAN
Ready.
[Cartman is hiding behind the bush.]
STAN
Okay. Action!
[The camera rolls, and the frog is dangling from a fishing pole, jumping around. Cartman, holding the pole, speaks in a spooky voice.]
CARTMAN
Blululululululuh. I am the deadly Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. I am very scary... And dangerous!
STAN
Cut! Cartman!
CARTMAN
[Popping up.] What?
STAN
It's supposed to be a frog!
CARTMAN
I know that!
STAN
Since when do frogs talk, Cartman?
CARTMAN
[Thinks.] It's a Sri Lanka frog!
KYLE
[Holding the camera.] Der, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Der yourself, hippie!
KYLE
Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk! [Resumes filming.]
STAN
Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?
CARTMAN
[Pops up.] I'm ready, Steven Spielberg! [Drops.]
STAN
Action!
CARTMAN
[Moves the frog around.] Blulululuh. Screw you guys.
[Downtown. The boys have Cartman wearing a grey wig, a pink dress, and black high heels.]
CARTMAN
Well, why do I have to dress up like an old lady?
KYLE
'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!
CARTMAN
Ee-goddammit!
STAN
Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you.
CARTMAN
They better not!
STAN
Okay, when I yell "action", you start to walk this way, then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared.
CARTMAN
Scared of a plastic frog?
STAN
It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready?
CARTMAN
Man, this is stupid.
STAN
Good. A-and action!
[Kenny walks in front of the camera with the frog, as Cartman screams and falls on his back.]
CARTMAN
Eee-ee-ee-ee!
[Jimbo and Ned back on the set.]
JIMBO
Well, it appears as though a lot of you "skeptics" thought that the film we showed of the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka was a fake. That you say it didn't harm anybody. Well, it just so happens that we just received another film from another anonymous viewer. [Looks away.] Roll it!
[The two scenes have been spliced together, except that Cartman falls on his left side, and Kenny added his own touch by mooning the camera.]
JIMBO
There you go! Proof that not only is this frog real, but it is doing harm to the people of South Park as we speak!
NED
Mmmm-damn that frog.
JIMBO
Well, that does it! All this week, Ned and I will be--
[South Park Public Access. His producer is watching Huntin' and Killin'.]
JIMBO
--risking life and limb as we go on location to hunt the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Join us, won't ya?
PRODUCER
Ooh, no, no, no, no!
[Jesus walks up behind her.]
PRODUCER
This is the biggest publicity stunt I've ever seen! Damn, those hunters are clever!
JESUS
Uhhh, clever?
PRODUCER
It's genius, it really is. Hell, I even want to watch them hunt the Mexican staring frog. Unless...
JESUS
Unless what?
PRODUCER
Unless we can prove to the City world that the whole thing is a sham. If we prove that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka is just something..made up by Jimbo and Ned, we can have them taken off the air. Perhaps even killed!
JESUS
Look, why don't we just stick to our own show? People will watch again.
PRODUCER
[Wearily.] Oh, J. You are so omnipotent, and yet so naive. We'll launch a full investigation, and in the meantime, we can cash in on the video tapes.
JESUS
What video tapes?
[A commercial begins.]
JESUS
Yea, children. I am the way and the light...
ANNOUNCER
You've seen Jesus and Pals. Now you've got to get the video!
[Jesus and Pals: Too Hot for TV!
A man pours some whipped cream on the chest of a topless bikini-clad woman wearing a cowboy hat.]
ANNOUNCER
Things get a little out of control!
[Another guest yells obscenities at another guest, but his mouth is censored.]
ANNOUNCER
You won't believe your eyes!
[Jesus is flanked by two Klansmen as he interviews them.]
ANNOUNCER
Order now, only $19.95!
[Jesus is Lord!!! Visa, MC, and AmEx accepted.]
ANNOUNCER
Remember, this is stuff you can't see on TV!
[Two other women in bikinis take off their tops and dance around. Their breasts are censored with bars saying "TOO HOT!!!"]
[Next day. Jimbo and Ned with cameraman Tom and producer drive through the town.]
JIMBO
Anonymous tip?
TOM
Yeah, it was left on our answering machine. All it said was that they saw the Mexican staring frog just south of Stark's Pond this morning.
JIMBO
Hey, Ned. Remember that time when we got the anonymous tip back in 'Nam?
TOM
You were in 'Nam? Where were you stationed?
NED
Mmm-Da Nang.
CAMERAMAN
With the log ride?
JIMBO
Yep.
TOM
Man, I was in Tet. We had a bad-ass roller coaster, but... all we ever wanted was a log ride. We waited and we waited, but... they never built us one. I think..Danforth wanted the log ride more than anybody, but he... he had to settle with that lame dinosaur water adventure ride.
JIMBO
That war was hell on everybody.
[Tom starts sobbing.]
PRODUCER
Good. Okay. Okay, bye! Good news, everybody. This week's ratings are through the roof! We're up to twenty people!
JIMBO
Wow! Do we got more money?
PRODUCER
No, but I do. We're now the highest-rated show on Mountain Cable Access! God bless the Mexican staring frog!
[The boys are back in the woods, and their frog is on a small boulder.]
KYLE
Dude, they're gonna look so stupid.
CARTMAN
Dude, totally.
STAN
They deserve it for lying to us, dude.
CARTMAN
[Relishing the moment.] Revenge is so very, very sweet.
STAN
They're here! Hurry and hide!
[They run for cover in a patch of shrubs. Jimbo stops his hummer and the men get out.]
JIMBO
Let's hunt!
PRODUCER
We'll start with a two-shot of you and Ned getting your equipment together and--
NED
Mm-Jimbo, look!
JIMBO
Hit the deck!
[They hide behind a snow drift.]
PRODUCER
What is it?
JIMBO
It's him! The Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. He's right over there on that rock.
PRODUCER
He is?
JIMBO
Dumb-ass! You've got to keep your eyes away from him!
[The producer tries to sneak a peek, but Jimbo forces him down again.]
JIMBO
Stay down. Ned, you take flight position; I'll try and keep it turned away from you.
NED
Mm-roger that.
[Ned leaves the drift, as Jimbo stands, facing the camera.]
JIMBO
Hello, fellow hunters. Have we got a show for you today.
[Ned moves behind the cameraman and begins his assault.]
JIMBO
The Mexican staring frog is sunning itself on a rock directly behind us.
[Ned jumps from behind one tree to behind another.]
JIMBO
We've got to take the frog by surprise. I'm gonna create a diversion using this incendiary device, while Ned will ambush him from the rear.
[Jimbo pulls the pin out and throws the grenade behind him. It hits the rock, but the plastic frog simply went about face.]
JIMBO
Now, Ned! He's not looking!
[Ned advances quickly.]
JIMBO
Quick, Ned, hit him with the shotgun! Now, Ned!
[Silence.]
JIMBO
Ned. Ne-ed?
[He turns around and draws closer to the rock. He sees Ned, now catatonic, looking at the frog.]
JIMBO
Oh, no!
[Close-up. Ned's hair stands on end.]
JIMBO
Come on, Ned, buddy, snap out of it!
[Ned's gun drops from his good arm.]
JIMBO
Come back to me, buddy.
PRODUCER
You getting all this?
[The cameraman smiles and gives a thumbs up.]
JIMBO
Hold onto your butts.
[Jimbo fires away at the frog with his shotgun.]
JIMBO
Take that, you demon frog!
[Jimbo rushes up to Ned.]
JIMBO
Ned, Ned? Can you hear me?
[He turns to his crew.]
JIMBO
Quick! Somebody, call an ambulance! This man is catatonic!
PRODUCER
Get the Flight for Life helicopter!
[The boys rise out of the shrubs.]
STAN
Holy crap, dude.
[Hells Pass Hospital. Jimbo is at Ned's bedside reading to him.]
JIMBO
..."but Ponyboy was beat up pretty bad. He kept saying, 'stay gold.'"
[Jimbo closes the book and watches Ned.]
JIMBO
Aw, Ned. If you can hear me, y-you've got to snap out of it, 'cause if you don't, uh-I'll never forgive myself.
[The boys enter the room.]
JIMBO
Aw, Stanley, he's gone! My only friend in the world is gone!
STAN
Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!
KYLE
Look!
[Kyle holds up the plastic frog, which puts Jimbo on guard.]
JIMBO
Aghh! What the hell are you doing? I almost looked right at it!
STAN
Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out!
[Jimbo drops his guard and inspects the frog.]
JIMBO
What..?
STAN
We shot all those videos and sent them in.
KYLE
Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke! [Grins.]
JIMBO
You sent in those videos?!
PRODUCER
[On the phone.] Oh, this is not good.
JIMBO
My best friend is a vegetable, and I'm gonna be the laughingstock of South Park!
KYLE
Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of plastic!
STAN
Yeah. Come on, Ned. Quit fakin'.
[No response from Ned.]
JIMBO
You boys don't understand. Ned was so freaked out by the idea of the Mexican staring frog that he must have sent himself into a deep coma.
[Jesus' producer is suddenly at the doorway with a satellite listening device.]
JESUS' PRODUCER
It's a psychosomatic response. [Entering.] I couldn't help overhearing your conversation just now.
KYLE
Who are you?
JESUS' PRODUCER
I produce a little TV show called Jesus and Pals, you might have heard of it. Your story is amazing; full of jealousy, duplicity, backstabbing and bitterness.
JIMBO
Uhhhh... Thanks?
JESUS' PRODUCER
How would you like to share your remarkable story with us on tomorrow's show?
[Jesus and Pals, after a commercial break. Today's topic: Tots in Trouble.]
JESUS
We're back with Jimbo and his nephew, Stan. These kids can't stop lying, can't they?
JIMBO
That's right, Jesus. No respect for their elders. As some of you may know, I host a local show on hunting.
[A woman claps.]
JIMBO
Thanks. We've been hunting the Mexican staring frog for a week based on some video footage we received from a viewer. Well, it turns out that these kids faked the footage!
JESUS
Is that true, Stan?
STAN
It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody.
[Jesus looks over to see his producer signaling him to call for a break.]
JESUS
Uhh, we'll find out more about this debauchery when we return.
CAMERAMAN
A-and we're out.
[Jesus walks off the stage, as the producer walks on.]
PRODUCER
You're corpses out here! We need a lot more action from everybody!
JIMBO
Like what?
PRODUCER
Like, go ahead and tell how your nephew Stan takes drugs and worships Satan.
JIMBO
Satan. Got it.
STAN
Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying!
JIMBO
Give you a taste of your own medicine, you little fibber!
PRODUCER
And you kids! I didn't bring you on this show to be boring. Somebody get pissed off and throw a chair at Ned here.
[Cartman raises his hand.]
CARTMAN
Dibs!
PRODUCER
Remember, you all start to fight after the chair is thrown. That's your cue.
JIMBO
Roger.
[The theme music plays again and the crowd applauds for the next segment. Action.]
JESUS
Welcome back to Jesus and Pals. Jimbo, why do you think little Stanley lies?
JIMBO
I'll tell you why. Because he's on drugs and worships the devil!
[The audience and Stan gasp.]
AUDIENCE
Jeesus! Jeesus! Jeesus!
JESUS
Wow. Now, Stanley, it sound like your uncle is really worried about you.
STAN
Well, I only..did it 'cause... he..molested me.
[Jesus' jaw drops. The audience boos, and the sound man and the director high-five each other.]
JIMBO
Why, you little piece of crap!
STAN
You big piece of crap!
CARTMAN
That's it! Now I'm all pissed off!
[Cartman takes his chair and throws it at Ned.]
CARTMAN
Take that, hippie!
[The chair hits Ned, who continues to just sit there.]
JIMBO
Hey!
AUDIENCE
Jeesus! Jeesus!
[Jimbo picks up his chair and throws it at Cartman. The chair hits a woman in the right side of her head in the audience and she gets up angry. She heads for the stage.]
[Jesus tries to calm things down.]
JESUS
O-okay, okay, that's enough.
WOMAN
[Slugs Jimbo.] Take that, you asshole!
[Jimbo falls. She jumps on him and strikes again.]
WOMAN
What the fuck was that?
JESUS
Uh, let's watch the language, people.
JIMBO
Bring it on, you bitch!
[She hits him again.]
CARTMAN
Ey, get off of him, you fuckin' nutsack!
AUDIENCE
Jeesus! Jeesus! Jeesus!
[A blond man pushes Jesus out of the way as he heads for the stage. The rest of the audience follow suit, and soon everyone is fighting.]
JESUS
Let's all just..make our way back to our seats.
[Kenny is being pulled apart by two men.]
KENNY
(Nononono-yikes!)
[A man in a green shirt hits Kenny in the face with a chair.]
[Kenny is ripped in half.]
MAN IN GREEN SHIRT PULLING KENNY
Yeah, yeah, yeh... [Gasps.]
MAN IN BLUE SHIRT PULLING KENNY
Yeah, yeah, yeh-oh?
MAN WITH CHAIR HITTING KENNY
Oh, Oh! Aah! AAAAGGHH!!! [Gasps.] Ooh.. Ew [Shrieks.]
[Kenny begins crying.]
KENNY
[Sobbing.] (OW! OW! DUDE, PLEASE STOP!! OH, FUCK! YIKES!!!!!)
[The 3 men, Stan, & Kyle gasp in horror to see what happened.]
STAN
Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny!
KYLE
You bastards!
[Cartman comes flying across the stage.]
CARTMAN
Ey, you guys!
[Two men just sitting in the audience start to fight for no reason.]
JESUS
Let's all just..make our way back to our seats.
WOMAN
Oh, my God!
[A man walks by with a chainsaw.]
JESUS
Shut the fuck up!
[The audience members stop and gasp at him. Cartman was biting at the leg of a man onstage.]
JESUS
Jesus, what is wrong with you people?! Look around you, Stanley. Look at all the pain and suffering your lie has caused.
[The audience members slowly return to their seats.]
STAN
W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble.
[A couple of rats come by and drag Kenny's upper half away.]
JIMBO
Hey, now. Everything I told you boys about the war actually happened.
STAN
Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself.
JESUS
The entire Vietcong Army?
JIMBO
I uh... Well, okay, I might have embellished the truth a little, but that's different.
JESUS
Is it?
JIMBO
Well, sure. I mean, eh... [Pinned.] Well, no uh, I guess not.
JESUS
And as for you, Stan uh, I think you need to kick your drug habit and--
STAN
Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie!
JESUS
Wait. Jimbo made that up?
STAN
No, your producer did.
[This gets the producer's attention.]
STAN
She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs.
JESUS
What?
STAN
During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie!
JIMBO
It's true, she did. Hu-I'm such a tool.
JESUS
Oh, really?
[The producer is now trying to hide behind a potted plant.]
KYLE
Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned!
CARTMAN
Yeah. I didn't wanna do it, Jesus. They made me do that.
MAN IN BROWN SHIRT
Screw this show. I thought this was all real.
[The audience members begin to leave.]
JESUS
W-wait, everybody. Come back.
MICHAEL JACKSON FAN
[Pats Jesus on the shoulder.] Don't feel too bad, Montel. We all want to touch children sometimes; it's only natural.
[South Park Public Access, outside. Later...]
JIMBO
I'm sorry, Stan. I was just trying to tell a good story. I never meant for you boys to get in trouble.
STAN
W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world.
KYLE
Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.
JIMBO
Aw, he'll be fine. I'll just take him home and show him some good hard-core porn, he'll snap right out of it. Won't you, Ned?
[Jimbo slaps him on the shoulder, and Ned falls like a statue. A door opens.]
JESUS
I want to apologize to all of you for what happened in there. In our competition for ratings we lost sight of why we got into show business in the first place.
JIMBO
Yeah. Titties and beer.
JESUS
Actually, I was referring more to the pursuit of truth, but—Well, anyway, I can't wait to get back to my old show without all the glitz and the ratings and producers and--
KYLE
Wait a sec. Where is your producer?
JESUS
[Upset.] I sent her away.
CARTMAN
Sent her away where?
[Hell. She enters Satan's lair with phone in hand. Pitchforks rise and begin poking her.]
PRODUCER
What is this? What's happening?!
SATAN
Welcome to my dominion.
PRODUCER
[Retreating.] Oooooohhhh!
SADDAM HUSSEIN
[Comes up behind Satan and stands next to him.] Hey. Take a load off. Put your feet up. Me and Satan were just aboot to go shopping for furniture. Come on, Satan.
SATAN
Okay, honey.
[They turn around and walk away, the camera enters her mouth as she screams.]
PRODUCER
Noooooo!
[End of The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka.
War is hell
My brother's a dirty mess
In war, war is hell
It's hell for you and me]
End of The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:A freak accident leaves the South Park Elementary school bus teetering precariously on the edge of a cliff. To cope, the boys reminisce the good old days.

script:City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)

[A mountain pass. Ms. Crabtree is driving the kids somewhere going uphill. The kids are having a grand time running around and tossing paper airplanes. Cartman has an entire two-tiered chocolate cake in his lap.]
MS. CRABTREE
BE QUIET BACK THERRE! THESE ROADS ARE SLIICK!
STAN
Hey, Cartman!
CARTMAN
What?
STAN
Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?
CARTMAN
[Finishes a bite.] Hmmm, let me see. No!
KYLE
Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!
CARTMAN
Mmm. It's chocolaty and delightful.
STAN
Give us some, Cartman!
MS. CRABTREE
[Turns around.] BE QUIET BACK THERRE!
KYLE
Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there.
STAN
Dude, the road is always snowy.
KYLE
I know, but, it's really snowy today.
CARTMAN
[Now baiting.] Mmm. I can't possibly finish this whole cake. Oh, yes I can. [Resumes eating.]
STAN
Shut up, Cartman!
[Ms. Crabtree slams on the brakes, opens a box, and pulls out a bunny.]
MS. CRABTREE
Okay, that does it! Y'all be quiet or the cute little bunny dies!
[She now points a gun at its head. The class gasps and look at her for a while. Sure that she has made her point, she puts the bunny back in the box and resumes driving.]
STAN
Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would.
KYLE
Oh, she would, dude. She would.
[The bus comes to a halt at a road block.]
MS. CRABTREE
GOODD!
[The sign reads: Road Closed due to Avalanche. Detour at your own risk.]
MS. CRABTREE
OH, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!
[She starts up the bus and takes the detour.]
STAN
Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now.
CARTMAN
[Exhausted.] I can not possibly eat one more bite of its chocolaty goodness. Oh, but but but, but I'll try.
KYLE
Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck!
MS. CRABTREE
[Spins around.] WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
[She turns back around just to see the bus head for a road shoulder where the road starts to turn.]
MS. CRABTREE
Whoa oh.
[She slams the brakes on, but the bus goes over the shoulder and tumbles down the side of the hill.]
MS. CRABTREE
Hold oonn! Aaaaa!
[The kids tumble all over the place and scream, but Cartman just munches away on the cake, quite undisturbed. The bus bounces on the bottom of the hill and lands on a river upright, floating on down.]
KIDS
Aaaah!
KYLE
I'm scared!
MS. CRABTREE
BE QUIET, KID!
[The kids look back at where they were as the bus continues down the river - and over a waterfall, straight down.]
ALL
Aaaah!
[Near the river, a guide is taking a couple bird-watching.]
GUIDE
...Aand right up here you can see a red-bellied chickadee. They're indigenous to this area.
[The guide walks forward. The husband takes a picture of the chickadee. In the background, the bus falls past them.]
THE KIDS
Aaaah!
WIFE
What was that?
GUIDE
[Turns.] What was what?
[At the foot of the waterfall. The bus plunges into the water and bobs up facing backwards.]
ALL
Aaaah-
[It is carried further down until the river bends. Then the bus is washed up onto the river bank, on the other side of which is a cliff. The bus teeters on the precipice.]
CARTMAN
All done!
MS. CRABTREE
SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!
[Cartman takes his seat, but leaves the cake tin on the floor. The rest of the kids moan and groan, and they are strewn all over the bus.]
MS. CRABTREE
I SAID 'QUIET,' OR ELSE I KILL THE BUNNY!
[The bunny and gun are out again, and the kids shut up.]
STAN
Where are we?
MS. CRABTREE
I have no idea.
STAN
I don't think we're in a very safe spot.
KYLE
Yeah, what are we supposed to do?
MS. CRABTREE
Just keep your trap shut. I'll consult the manual.
[She reaches for it and leafs through until she gets to it. She tosses the book away and reaches for the videotape drawer.]
CARTMAN
Ms. Crabtree?
MS. CRABTREE
SHUT UP, KIID! I HAVE TO WATCH A TRAINING VIDEO!
TRAINER
[The video starts.] Welcome to tape 7 of the bus driver's video guidebook. What to do if you become stranded. By now you've calmed down the children and kept order by using the 'keep quiet or I'll kill the bunny' technique. Now, it's time to get help. The most important thing to remember is that the children will be safe as long as they stay on the bus. So do not, under any circumstances, let any children off the bus. The best way to achieve this is to tell them something like, 'A big scary monster will eat you if you step off the bus.'
MS. CRABTREE
KIIDS, DO NOT GET OFF THIS BUS. IF YOU DO A BIG SCARY MONSTER WILL EAT YOU!
TRAINER
That's right. With the children properly subdued, you can leave the bus and go out looking for assistance. And remember your bus driver's code: 'Sit down. And shut up!'
MS. CRABTREE
I'm goin' for help. Ah'll be back as soon as I can. Remember. Don't get off this bus, or a big scary monster WILL EAT YOU!
[She gets off the bus and walks down the river bank. The bus teeters a bit.]
BOY IN THE RED SHIRT
Hey, why doesn't the scary monster eat her?
KYLE
'Cause, dumbass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!
MS. CRABTREE
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
KYLE
I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.'
MS. CRABTREE
Oh.
STAN
Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on.
[A roadside. Ms. Crabtree has found a vertical path leading down to the road and climbs down some large boulders.]
MS. CRABTREE
Had to happen to me, didn't it?
[Reaches the curb and puts out a thumb.]
TRUCK DRIVER
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too-
[The truck driver sees Ms. Crabtree, then lowers the mirror and sets his hair.]
TRUCK DRIVER
Whoa uhih, it's supper time. Come to poppa.
[He stops his rig and lowers the passenger window.]
TRUCK DRIVER
Whoa uh heh hello, little lady-yeh. Goin' my way?
MS. CRABTREE
SHUT UP AND HELP ME INTO THIS THIING!
TRUCK DRIVER
Whoa. Hehum huh.
MS. CRABTREE
[Grunts.] Yeah! [Now seated.] COME ON! I HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY!
TRUCK DRIVER
Uh huh. Alright, sure, of course.
[He checks out her legs and grins.]
MS. CRABTREE
TAKE ME TO THE NEAREST TOWN AND MAKE IT SNAPPY, YOU FREAK-ASS CRACKPOT!
TRUCK DRIVER
Uuuh, yeh, yes ma'am. Righta right away, ma'am.}
[He starts up the truck.]
TRUCK DRIVER
So uh... Uhwhat's a- fragile little doe like yourself doin' out on a, on a night like this?
MS. CRABTREE
LOOK, MISTER, I GOT A BUSLOAD OF KIDS TRAPPED UP ON THAT PASS! I NEED A CRANE, HELICOPTERS, ALL THAT CRAP! HERE, LET ME HAVE SOME O' YOUR ASPIRIN!
[She takes a couple.]
TRUCK DRIVER
Uh uh- ma'am, those are actually roofies.
MS. CRABTREE
ROOFIES, ASPIRIN, RIGHT NOW I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS!
[The driver is quite happy right now.]
MS. CRABTREE
HOW FAR TO THE NEAREST TOOWWN?!
TRUCK DRIVER
Mm-... mm-it's a ways.
[Next day, and the bus is still there.]
CARTMAN
You guys. What if Ms. Crabtree doesn't come back, and we're all trapped here forever.
KIDS
[Gasp, then individually.] What? Huh?
KYLE
We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days.
[The others gasp.]
STAN
Dude!
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
I don't wanna die on this- bus with you assholes! [Panics.] You guys suck!
STAN
Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.
KYLE
Worse than this?
STAN
Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary.
[Stan's Tale: from Cartman Gets An Anal Probe, but with a twist. The boys and Wendy, are in the forest waiting for the visitors, using Cartman, who is tied to a tree by his foot, as bait.]
[Cartman tugs at his foot, testing the rope.]
CARTMAN
Oh, man, this sucks.
KYLE
How come the visitors aren't coming for him.
STAN
I think we have to signal them somehow.
CARTMAN
[Farts fire.] Ow!
WENDY
Hey, he's like Rudolph.
KYLE
Yeah. [Shouting] All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!
CARTMAN
Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.
KYLE
Sure you do!
STAN
Come on Cartman, fart!
CARTMAN
I don't wanna.
STAN
[To Kyle and Wendy] He can't hold it in forever.
KYLE
Fart, damn you!
CARTMAN
Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!
[Cartman farts, and an anal probe comes out of his butt.]
KYLE
Whoa, look at that.
CARTMAN
It's completely immature!
[The probe is starting to resemble a truck.]
STAN
Hey, it's happening again.
[The assembly is done, and a clerk stands ready to serve ice cream.]
STAN
It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman?
CARTMAN
You guys can't scare me!
STAN
Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass.
[The mother ship and three daughter ships come down, and visitors appear. They walk over to the truck.]
KYLE
Hey, look. The aliens are getting ice cream.
STAN
Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay.
[He walks over to Wendy and kisses her good.]
WENDY
Mmmm.
[Back to the bus.]
STAN
Now, that was what I call a sticky situation.
[The kids laugh.]
KYLE
You can say that again.
CARTMAN
Was that how it happened?
[In the Trucker's Cab.]
MS. CRABTREE
STOOPP! LET ME OFF, YOU TURD!
TRUCK DRIVER
Hey. Uh I wanna help you. Uh, I care a lot about that bus full of uuh- what was it again?
MS. CRABTREE
Children.
TRUCK DRIVER
Yeah right. Leh, let me come with you.
[They get out of the truck and head over to Pauly Shore's Funny Pit.]
MS. CRABTREE
WHO- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAAP?!
CARROT ASS
[On stage.] I hate flyin'. Talk about somethin' I hate, it's flyin'.
TRUCK DRIVER
[Nudging Ms. Crabtree.] Say uuhh, are those roofies kickin' in yet?
MS. CRABTREE
WELL, I DON'T THINK SO!
TRUCK DRIVER
Damn!
CARROT ASS
D'you guys like impressions?
PATRON
No!
CARROT ASS
Here's my impression of Robert De Niro.
[Carrot Ass turns around, makes adjustments, and turns again.]
CARROT ASS
Hey, youse. Youse guys. Shut up, youse!
MS. CRABTREE
YOU SUUCK!!
[The audience roars with laughter.]
CARROT ASS
Youse guys, shut up!
MS. CRABTREE
SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!!
[More laughter.]
CARROT ASS
[As Barney, the dinosaur.] Come on, lady. Iii love you. You love me.
MS. CRABTREE
I SAAIID, SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!!
[More laughter. A man falls down from laughing so hard. Carrot Ass pees in his pants and walks off stage. A talent scout walks up to Ms. Crabtree.]
TALENT SCOUT
Baby, you're wonderful! You're a natural! You're the funniest comic I've seen in yeauhs!
MS. CRABTREE
WHY DON'T YOU JUST SHUT THE HELL UP. I'VE GOT TO GET SOME ASSISTANCE FOR MY BROKEN-DOWN BUUSS!!
TALENT SCOUT
Broken-down bus! That's great! Great angle!
[Night time at the precipice.]
STAN
Do you see 'er dude?
KYLE
Nope.
CARTMAN
God-dammit, how long is this goin' to take?
BOY IN THE RED SHIRT
She's never coming back. Don't you get it? She left us here to die like pigs.
KYLE
Calm down, dude. You're upsetting Kenny.
KENNY
[Miffed at Kyle.] (Huh?)
BOY IN THE RED SHIRT
I can't take it anymore! I have to get out of here! [He begins to hyperventilate.]
STAN
No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said: there's a big black scary monster out there!
BOY IN THE RED SHIRT
Ehah! Well, I'm not gonna sit here and wait to die with the rest of you! If I can make it back, ah-I'll send help.
KYLE
Don't do it, kid.
[The kid in the red shirt kid hops off the bus and the rest of the class goes over to the left side of the bus to see him off.]
STAN
Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster.
[The boy turns around and smiles. The bushes behind him rustle. The kids look stunned as the monster comes out of the trees and snatches him up.]
BOY IN THE RED SHIRT
Nooooo-agh!
[The monster picks him up and swallows him whole.]
KYLE
Holy crap, dude!
[The monster turns and scurries away. The precipice is quiet for a while before the boy's skeleton is tossed back. It lands on one of the bus windows and slowly slides down, leaving some blood. The kids jump back and run around confused.]
BEBE
Gross!
[The kids take their seats.]
STAN
Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus.
[South Park, the next day. Liane Cartman prepares some Cookie Dings dough for baking, and the phone rings, and she answers it.]
LIANE
Hello?
SHARON
Oh, hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother.
LIANE
Oh yes, Sharon. How are you?
SHARON
Ms. Cartman, is your son at home?
LIANE
Hu-old on, dear, let me check.
[Liane lowers the phone.]
LIANE
Hon, I made beefy logs.
[Silence.]
LIANE
I made Cookie Dings.
[Silence.]
LIANE
No, he's not here.
SHARON
Well, now I am worried. I've tried all the houses and nobody knows where they are.
LIANE
Oh, dear!
[Denver.]
TALENT SCOUT
I'm telling you, Marty, this woman is a natural! I haven't seen a funnier person since Maury Povich.
MARTY
What's her angle?
TALENT SCOUT
I can't even explain it. You have to see it.
MARTY
Alright. Well, this better be good.
[The talent scout turns around and goes to the door.]
TALENT SCOUT
Come on in, come on in.
MS. CRABTREE
WHUAT THE HELL DID YOU BRING ME TO DENVER FOR, YOU BRAIN-DEPRAVED FECOPHILIAC?!
TALENT SCOUT
Mr. Jonus, this is Mrs. Crabtree.
MARTY
Pleasure to meet you.
MS. CRABTREE
YOU LOOK LIKE A LUMP OF DOGSHIT JUST GOT HIT BY A CAR!!
TALENT SCOUT
What did I tell you?
MARTY
She's fantastic. How would you like to make a million dollars, baby?
MS. CRABTREE
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SUCK MY ASS?!
MARTY
Let's get started right away.
TRUCK DRIVER
Are you gonna be all right?
MS. CRABTREE
DON'T TOUCH ME!
TRUCK DRIVER
Uh ah-I'm sorry. Do you need anything?
MS. CRABTREE
No. I just...
TRUCK DRIVER
What?
MS. CRABTREE
I can't help but feel that I've forgotten somethin'.
[Another night at the precipice.]
STAN
What time is it?
KENNY
(Almost 7:30.)
KYLE
On Wednesday or Thursday?
STAN
Dude, I think it's Saturday now.
CARTMAN
What?! I'm missing the new Fantasy Island.
[Kyle turns around and stares out the back window.]
KYLE
Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus.
STAN
Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us.
CARTMAN
What do you think it is?
STAN
I don't know, it's- a big scary monster.
[Kyle turns to listen.]
KYLE
Hey. Maybe it's that thing, Scuzzlebutt. [He sits back down.]
STAN
What?
KYLE
Don't you remember? That time we were out hunting with your uncle Jimbo and Ned.
[Kyle's Tale: from Volcano, with a twist. Jimbo, Ned, and the boys are running from the flowing lava.]
BOYS
Aaaaaa!
JIMBO
The lava's comin' right for us!
CARTMAN
Heellp!
[The lava is charging down the hill, and the boys, Jimbo, and Ned have reached the trench. Scuzzlebutt appears, and they stare in awe.]
JIMBO
Jimminy Hope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt!
CARTMAN
What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
KYLE
Oh my God! Look at his leg!
BRENT MUSBERGER
Hi kids, I'm TV's Brent Musberger.
KYLE
Dude! He got Brent Musberger for a leg!
ALL
Aaaa!
JIMBO
Quick Ned, shoot it!
[Ned tries to cock the gun but nothing is happening.]
NED
Mmm. Oh no, out of ammo.
STAN
Hey, look!
SCUZZLEBUTT
Grrrr.
[Scuzzlebutt has fashioned some ice cream cones out of thin air.]
KYLE
Dude! He's making ice cream.
[Scuzzlebutt offers the cones to the boys, Cartman takes the chocolate one.]
CARTMAN
Scuzzlebutt kicks ass!
KYLE
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation.
[The kids laugh.]
STAN
Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice.
CARTMAN
Hey. Maybe it's our teacher, Mr. Garrison.
KYLE
Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us!
CARTMAN
Oh no? Don't you remember the time he went crazy, and tried to kill Kathie Lee Gifford?
[Cartman's Tale: from Weight Gain 4000. Mr. Garrison is in the book depository waiting for Kathie Lee to pass by.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[Excitedly.] Here she comes!
[The band marches down the street, followed by Kathie Lee Gifford's car and entourage. She's in her bubble waving to the crowds.]
MR. GARRISON
Come on you little bitch.
[He takes aim, but the view is fuzzy as he focuses in on her.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[On stage.] It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.
[The crowd cheers. Kathie Lee's security force throw her, bubble and all, on stage.]
KATHIE LEE
Thank you.
[Mr. Garrison has his target, but Stan and Wendy rush in.]
STAN
Mr. Garrison, stop!
MR. GARRISON
[He turns to face them.] Leave us. We must finish what we have begun.
WENDY
But Mr. Garrison!
MR. GARRISON
[Faces them again.] She's not really Kathie Lee Gifford. She's some kinda alien.
KATHIE LEE
Thank you. And I love you all.
[A shot pierces the bubble and enters Kathie Lee's head. The crowd gasps as she holds her head. She rips it open to reveal a vicious little green alien.]
ALIEN
Naawwr!
[The alien jumps out of the bubble. Mr. Garrison follows it in his sights and shoots it dead.]
MR. GARRISON
[Facing Stan and Wendy.] See, I told ya.
[Stan and Wendy shrug and lock lips.]
WENDY
Mmmm.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[Sheepishly giddy.] Wow, this is gonna put a damper on the day. [Into the mic.] Let's have ice cream, everyone! [The crowd cheers.]
[Cartman is on stage, totally ripped, he flexes with a vanilla ice cream cone in his left hand.]
CARTMAN
Beefcaake!
CARTMAN
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation.
[The kids laugh.]
STAN
But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun.
CARTMAN
Oh, yeah.
[Burbank, NBC Studios, 11:35 p.m.]
ANNOUNCER
Live from Burbank, it's The Tonight Show, with Jay Leno. Tonight, Jay's special guests include: Washed-up Actress from a sitcom. And the comedy of Mrs. Crabtree. And now, here's your host, Jay Leno.
[He comes out with a very long chin, down to his knees. He turns and waves at the audience.]
TALENT SCOUT
Just relax, sweetheart, you're gonna kill out there.
MS. CRABTREE
KILL WHO?!
TALENT SCOUT
Huh that's great. Use that. [Holds up his thumbs.]
TRUCK DRIVER
Honey du-, do you need anything?
MS. CRABTREE
JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE OF THEM ROOFIES.
TRUCK DRIVER
[Rushing up.] Sure.
[He offers it, and she takes it and swallows.]
[Mr. Mackey's office. A crowd of people is gathered in there with Mr. Mackey.]
MR. MACKEY
Oh oh okay? Let's try to calm down, n'kay? This type of thing happens all the time.
SHARON
What do ya mean?! How often does an entire third-grade class go missing?!
MR. MACKEY
Well, 99% of the time, when a child is missing, it's because they've run away. M'kay?
[The parents gasp.]
SHARON
Run away?
SHEILA
[Fretfully.] Oy, I knew I shouldn't have made Kyle eat that gefukahukah.
RANDY
How do we get our runaway children back?
MR. MACKEY
Well, we just need to make some posters, nkay? Hand out brochures, onkay? That way, the public can know what the chldren look like and can call in if thry're spotted, m'kay?
SHARON
Let's get started right away! They could be halfway to L. A. by now.
SHEILA
It's only a matter of time before they're selling their bodies and buying smack.
[About town. An insistent tune plays. Posters of the missing kids are going up everywhere. Gerald pins a picture of Kyle on a tree, and Randy tapes one of Stan on a light post.]
MAN 1
Come on, everybody!
MAN 2
We've got to find those kids!
MAN 1
If we all put our heads together, we can find them!
MAN 2
We can do it!
[Liane is in a bikini passing out pictures of Eric. This draws men, young and old, from all around.]
MAN 3
Hi.
[On a wall are pictures of, from left to right, Bebe, Clyde, Stan, Kyle, Macaulay Culkin, Pip,...]
[Midnight on the precipice. The bus rocks slowly and with a loud thud.]
STAN
What was that?
KYLE
What was what?
STAN
Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus!
KYLE
What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against.
KENNY
(Hey you guys. Remember when Terrance and Phillip was off the air?)
KYLE
Hey yeah, I remember that.
KENNY
(All I know is that it was a loong time ago, and Death was chasing us on a bicycle down the street.)
[Kenny's Tale: from Death. The boys are running down the street, Death pursues them, and Grandpa Marsh pursues Death.]
THE BOYS
Aaaah! Aaaah! Aaaah!
[Death is following the kids on a tricycle, while Grandpa Marsh is trying to keep up with Death on his electric wheelchair.]
GRANDPA MARSH
Come back here you pompousy son of a pansy!
THE BOYS
Aaaah!
KYLE
[Sees Death close to Kenny.] Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
GRANDPA
Come over here you son of a whore!
[Everyone passes the electronics store without stopping to see Terrance and Phillip. Death is about to touch Kenny when Kenny decides to defend his life.]
KENNY
(Take... that!)
[Kenny flips Death off the trike and starts jumping on him. Death starts coming apart.]
KENNY
(You dick! That is for me, and that, that and that, that and that, that, that, that!)
[Kyle and Stan return to watch.]
STAN
Oh my God! Kenny- killed... death!
KYLE
You... bastard?
[Kenny reaches into Death's corpse, pulls out a strawberry ice cream cone, and starts licking.]
KENNY
(Heheheh. Now that's what I-he call a sticky situation!)
[The kids laugh.]
STAN
Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you.
KENNY
(Oh, yeah.)
KYLE
Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right?
[The roof rips open and the scary monster reaches in and gropes for someone. Butters jumps for the front window, and Pip and Craig try to open their windows.]
KIDS
AAAAH!
KID
MOMMY!
[The monster's claw settles on Kenny and pulls him out.]
KENNY
[Gasps.] (Uh oh. Hey uh, you guys! Help me doooowwwwnnnn! Heeyy, you guuuuyyyyys!)
[The monster scurries away, holding Kenny tight.]
STAN
Oh my God, it's killing Kenny!
KYLE
You bastard!
[Stan watches as Kenny and the monster disappear.]
STAN
Hoh boy, we're in big trouble.
[Cartman looks out through the gaping hole in the roof.]
CARTMAN
Hey you guys. Can we order a pizza?
[Back at The Tonight Show, Ms. Crabtree's segment has just started.]
MS. CRABTREE
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU ALL STARIN' AT?!
[The audience laughs.]
MS. CRABTREE
STOP LAUGHING, YOU WHORES!!
[More laughs.]
MS. CRABTREE
I SAID, SHUT UP!!
[The audience is hushed, then roars with laughter again. She stays quiet and walks off stage.]
JAY LENO
Let's hear it for Ms. Crabtree. What an up-and-comer!
TRUCK DRIVER
Well. That was great, ma'am.
MS. CRABTREE
Was it? Does it even matter?
TRUCK DRIVER
Wwhat do ya mean?
MS. CRABTREE
Success is hollow, Mitch, hollow like a dead tree. I think it's time for me to give it up.
TRUCK DRIVER
Are you sure?
MS. CRABTREE
Ah-I'm sure. Let's get a cup of coffee.
[They walk off. Meanwhile it's daytime, and the sun is shining into the bus through the roof.]
CARTMAN
I wonder when the monster is gonna come back to feed again?
[The kids shiver.]
KYLE
We've just gotta stick together.
STAN
Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this.
CARTMAN
Hay, wait a minute.
STAN
What?
CARTMAN
Remember the time when Fonzie jumped over the buses with his motorcycle?
[Happy Days' Tale: Arnold's at night. Every kid of driving age shows up to see Fonzie jump the buses. Two of his many admiring girls get him ready for the jump, then walk away. The Fonz revs up the bike.]
JOANIE CUNNINGHAM
Go, Fonzie!
FONZIE
Eeeeyyyy!
[The Fonz strikes a pose and gives a thumbs up.]
CARTMAN
You can do it, Fonzie.
STAN
We believe in you, Fonz.
FONZIE
Eeeeyyyy!
[The Fonz revs up his motorcycle and heads for the ramp. He passes it and turns around, does a wheelie, and goes for the jump. He sails over the buses and lands. He gets close to the crowd and loses control. Everybody but Kenny gets out of the way.]
KENNY
(Hey, that freakin' bike-!)
[Fonzie's bike smashes him into the brick wall and bounces off, and Fonzie sails over the wall. After a moment, Kenny drops, and Fonzie gets up behind the wall.]
FONZIE
[Triumphantly.] Eeyy!
[He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a chocolate ice cream cone, then starts licking.]
STAN
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
KYLE
You bastards!
CARTMAN
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. Uheheheh, heh.
STAN
You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened!
KYLE
Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too?
CARTMAN
[Thinks.] Oh yeah, I guess that doesn't make sense.
[As he turns around, the bus lurches again.]
STAN
Oh no!
[The bus teeters.]
KIDS
Aaaah!
KYLE
What are we gonna do?
KIDS
[Running around.] Aaaah!
[Nighttime arrives, and Kyle looks out the back window as the kids move around. Clyde and Red run to the front, and Craig runs from the front door to the seat behind the driver.]
STAN
Now we need more weight in the back.
[Red and Clyde run back, and the third kid runs back to the door.]
STAN
No, that's too much!
[Clyde and Red run to the front, but stop halfway. The front of the bus drops back to the ground.]
KYLE
There. [Drops into his seat.] I think we got it.
STAN
I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude.
KYLE
Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does.
CARTMAN
It does?
KYLE
Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own?
[The Ensign's Tale: Two nights ago. The kid in the red shirt decides not to wait for help to come, but to go and look for help himself.]
BOY IN THE RED SHIRT
Ehah! Well, I'm not gonna sit here and wait to die with the rest of you! If I can make it back, ah-I'll send help.
KYLE
Don't do it, kid.
[The kid hops off the bus and the rest of the class goes over to the left side of the bus to see him off.]
STAN
Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster.
[The boy turns around and smiles. The bushes behind him rustle. The kids look stunned as the monster comes out of the trees and traps the boy.]
BOY IN THE RED SHIRT
Nooooo-agh!
[The monster picks him up and swallows him whole.]
KYLE
Holy crap, dude!
[The monster pulls out a spoon and some ice cream to enjoy with his meal.]
KYLE
Hey look! He's got ice cream!
[Kyle and Stan smile.]
KIDS
Hooray! Yea!
[The roof opens up.]
KIDS
Aaah!
[Cartman smiles, and ice cream cones start dropping in for the kids to catch.]
KIDS
Yea! Ha ha.
[The kids enjoy the treats.]
KYLE
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation.
[The kids laugh.]
[A marsh. Ms. Crabtree and the truck driver are enjoying a quiet moment.]
MS. CRABTREE
Wow, this is gorgeous. I don't think I've ever seen anything so beautiful.
TRUCK DRIVER
From a distance, this place looks like a cold, damp marsh. But once you get inside it...
[They look at each other.]
TRUCK DRIVER
...you realize that it has an inner beauty, far surpassing others.
[He hugs her a little tighter.]
TRUCK DRIVER
Thank you for sharing your time with me, Ms. Crabtree.
MS. CRABTREE
Please. Call me Muffin.
TRUCK DRIVER
I'm having a nice time, Muffin.
MS. CRABTREE
Me too, Marcus. I've forgotten all about my cares in the world.
[The precipice. All her cares are still waiting for someone to rescue them.]
CARTMAN
Aw damn, man. Now I'm missing the new Barnaby Jones.
KYLE
Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on it.
STAN
Hey yeah!
[Cartman hops down, goes to the driver's seat, and turns on the TV. After a second or two, News 4 pops up.]
TOM
...And all over America, kids are turning to the streets and running away. Tonight, a very special message from the parents of some runaway children, in hopes that their young will hear their cries.
RANDY
Hello, Stanley. It's me, Poppa.
[Stan looks glum.]
RANDY
Gosh, your mother and I miss ya. And I hope that... wherever you may be, you'll hear this message.
[Music begins, and Randy sings passionately.]
RANDY
Little lamb, you're lost in the great big world
Runaway, findin' streets so cold
KYLE
[Pointing at Stan.] Du-hude! Your dad's a retard!
[Stan looks embarrassed. On TV, Gerald steps up to the mic.]
GERALD
Please come home, Kyle.
[Now Kyle looks glum.]
GERALD
You left home lookin' for somethin' new.
[Kyle is really embarrassed.]
GERALD
But all you need is right here waitin' for you
[The kids laugh at Kyle.]
THE PARENTS
Runaway, come home. We love you just as you are.
Runaway, come home. We're sorry things went this far.
[There are twelve adults present: The Marshes, the Broflovskis, the McCormicks, Liane Cartman, Mr. Garrison, Kevin's mother, and three unidentified adults.]
STAN
Dude, did it ever occur to them to just look for us?
CLYDE
I hope my dad doesn't sing.
CARTMAN
Hey! Do you guys remember the time I found out who my father was?
STAN
Boy, do I!
[Cartman's Tale: from Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut. All the men are gathered at Mephesto's room in Hell's Pass Hospital. The boys and Liane are also there.]
MEPHESTO
Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father is... John Elway.
[All gasp. Congratulatory music plays.]
CARTMAN
Sweeeeeett! [Smiles big.]
JOHN ELWAY
Uh oh.
CARTMAN
This kicks ass, you guys! John Elway is my father!
[He starts a little cheer.]
CARTMAN
My father is John Elway,
My father is John Elway
Deedun, Deedun.
[John Elway comes over to Cartman.]
JOHN ELWAY
Come on, son. I'll buy you some ice cream.
[Cartman looks up lovingly at his purported father, and they walk away. Curiously, Liane Cartman is left behind.]
CARTMAN
Now, that's what I call a sti-
KYLE
Wait a minute. I though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis.
CARTMAN
What?! Eeyy, you son of a bitch! I'll kick you in the nuts!
[He hops off his seat, and the bus moves a little, then Cartman's weight heaves the bus. He makes his way to the back.]
STAN
Cartman, no!
[The bus slowly starts to teeter.]
KIDS
Aaaaaa!
STAN
The bus is going over!
KYLE
Oh no!
KIDS
[All hurrying to the front.] Aaaaa. Aaaaaaa.
[Craig tries to hang on to a seat, but loses his grip and falls through the back window screaming. With the help of Kevin, Stan pulls Kyle to safety from the back of the bus. The bus snaps in two halves, and the front end comes down along with the other half. A second later, both parts of the bus slip into the steep canyon.]
KIDS
Aaaaa!
[The scene is shown again, but this time the bus falls into a colossal tub of Super Chocolaty Chunky Funk Chip Surprise Ice Cream. The kids are strewn all over the place once again.]
STAN
[He and Kyle get up and look out the window] Hey! We've landed in ice cream!
KIDS
Hooray!
CARTMAN
Wait, wait wait wait. This doesn't make sense. This whole thing doesn't make any sense. I must be-
[Cartman's bedroom. Cartman snaps out of a vivid dream and sits up.]
CARTMAN
Deah, eh eh. [Sweats.] Oh man, what a weird dream!
[Liane appears at his door with milk and a bowl.]
LIANE
Ah-are you okay, hon?
CARTMAN
Ma? I just dreamt that me and Stan and Kyle and Kenny were trapped on our bus, and we were talking about everything that happened to us, except that it was all wrong and everything ended with us eating ice cream.
LIANE
Oh. Well. Would you like some beetles for breakfast?
[Beetles start crawling out of the bowl.]
CARTMAN
Yes, please.
[Liane snaps up the first beetle the leaves the bowl and eats it.]
LIANE
Mmmm.
CARTMAN
Mmmm. [Munch munch gobble.] Mmmm.
LIANE
Mmmm. Beetles are good with ice cream.
[Stan's bedroom. Stan is asleep.]
STAN
GAAA-uh.
[Stan is now wide awake, as he sits up.]
STAN
Ugh. Oh, dude. What a nightmare.
[He reaches for the phone and dials a number.]
KYLE
[Already up, reaches for the phone.] Hello?
STAN
Dude, I just had the weirdest dream.
KYLE
Really?
STAN
Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles.
KYLE
Dude. That's a pretty fucked up dream.
STAN
Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems.
KYLE
Hey. Me and Cartman and Kenny are going down to Happy Burger. Do you wanna come?
STAN
Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later.
[He hangs up, hops off the bed and leaves.]
[The marsh. Cartman's dream has a life of its own and is self-aware, like a holodeck program gone awry. A frog croaks.]
MS. CRABTREE
I want to thank you for making me feel alive again, Marcus.
TRUCK DRIVER
Ms. Crabtree?
MS. CRABTREE
What is it? What's wrong?
TRUCK DRIVER
You realize I can't stay. None of this is real: it's... it's all been a little eight-year old's dream.
MS. CRABTREE
Oh I know. I know, Marcus. But let me just pretend as long as I can.
TRUCK DRIVER
Sure.
[He hugs her a bit tighter, and they stare off into the horizon, at a very red sunset.]
["Runaway, Come Home" plays.]
End of City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The entire town is gearing up for the annual 4th of July celebration when a ban on fireworks is imposed. They attempt to create something better.

script:Summer Sucks

[South Park Elementary. In the final hour of the school year...]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, now I know that today is the last day of school, and that the last day of school involves pranks, but this is going too far! What have you done with Mr. Hat?
[The kids stay silent.]
MR. GARRISON
Children! I want Mr. Hat back, right now!
[Mr. Garrison pounds his desk in frustration.]
MR. GARRISON
The prank is over!
[He pounds his desk again. The kids sit still.]
MR. GARRISON
You think I can't get along without Mr. Hat, don't you? You think I can't live without him? Well, I can! He's just a puppet. I don't need him. You see? Watch.
[He starts waiting. Soon he grimaces, then he taps his thumbs together, then taps them faster.]
MR. GARRISON
GODDAMMIT, WHERE THE FUCK DID YOU PUT MR. HAT?!
[He pounds his desk hard and the apple bounces away. The dismissal bell rings.]
KIDS
Yea--
MR. GARRISON
Oh no, you don't! The school year is over, but summer vacation doesn't start for you little bastards until Mr. Hat is back on my desk!
KIDS
Awww..!
MR. GARRISON
Now, I'm going to turn around, and when I turn back, I expect to see Mr. Hat lying right here!
[Mr. Garrison turns to face the board.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay. I'm going to turn around now.
[Mr. Garrison turns back toward the classroom, to find that all the kids except for Pip have left.]
MR. GARRISON
SHIT!
PIP
Where did everybody go?
[Outside. The kids bolt through the school's front door.]
KIDS
Yea!/Hooray!/Summer!
[The snow melts away, and a mound of it reveals a boy whose missing person's poster was in the back of the class. He gets up, and his parents rush up to meet him.]
MOTHER
Oh golly, Kevin, honey.
FATHER
Good to see you again, son.
[The boys walk past a house where a man inhales in the warm breeze.]
MAN
Looks like winter's right around the corner. Better get some firewood ready.
[He uses a chainsaw on the tree in front of the house. Trees all over the area are coming down.]
[A park, and kids are at play already. The boys walk through and meet Pip along the way.]
PIP
Oh, happy summer, gentlemen!
STAN
Shut up, Pip.
PIP
Right-o. Uh... Enjoy some of this summer for me, would you?
KYLE
What do you mean?
PIP
Well, I have to spend my summer in summer school, because I can't be left alone. You see, my parents are dead.
CARTMAN
Your parents are dead? Goddamn, you suck, Pip!
[The boys laugh at him and walk away.]
[The boys walk past a sign reading "Stu's Fireworks" with an arrow pointing right.]
STAN
Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks.
KYLE
I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.
STAN
I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt.
KYLE
Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.
CARTMAN
Eeyy! If you so much as touch Kitty's ass, I'll put firecrackers in your nutsack and blow your balls all over your pants!
STAN
Jesus, Cartman!
CARTMAN
[Mumbles.] Well, I'm just saying na, don't mess with Kitty na.
[Stu's Firework Shack.]
STU
Hi, fellas.
BOYS
Hi, Stu.
STU
What can I do for you?
KYLE
We wanna buy M-80s.
STAN
The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.
CARTMAN
Okay, that's it!
[Kenny laughs.]
CARTMAN
Screw you guys! I'm going home.
[Cartman walks off.]
KYLE
What a baby.
STAN
So, we'll have ten M-80s, please.
STU
I'm sorry, fellas. Haven't you heard?
STAN
Heard what?
STU
All fireworks have been banned in Colorado.
KYLE
What do ya mean?
STU
It was in the paper this morning.
[Headline: "North Park Kid Loses Hands in Firecracker Accident". The picture shows the armless boy with scars on his cheeks and a dismembered hand on the floor.]
KYLE
Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?
STU
Right.
STAN
How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?
KYLE
Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives.
[Flashback. Kyle remembers their days as toddlers. All four stand in a hallway holding lit firecrackers. Kyle tosses one up in the air and it pops. Kenny holds on to his, to his peril. It pops, and Kenny's head flies off his torso. The rest of the body falls over.]
STAN
Oh gosh, killed Kenny!
KYLE
Oo bastards!
[Rats pile on the corpse and nibble away.]
STAN
A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass.
KYLE
Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?
[Stu pulls out a fireworks box and takes something out.]
STU
I can still sell snakes.
[Stu lights one up, sets it down, and watches it grow.]
STAN/KYLE/ KENNY
Awww..!
[Meanwhile, over at City Hall, Mayor McDaniels is on the phone with someone.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
This is absurd! We need fireworks for our Fourth of July celebration at the lake. [Listens.] I don't care that some twerp blew his hands off! We've got to have fireworks for our picnic! Hold on, I've got another call. [Switch.] Hello? No, I don't know where Mr. Hat is! Jesus, Garrison. I've got bigger problems! [Switch.] Hello, yes? Now what am I supposed to do about our Fourth of July show at the lake? No, I don't want snakes! This is an outrage! Get me the Mayor! I know that, smart-ass, I was being ironic..! [Hangs up.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
[Emerging from under her desk.] I'm sorry, Mayor, but I couldn't find the little man in the boat.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Well, keep looking. [Pushes him down.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
This is ridiculous. We can't have a celebration without fireworks. Whoever heard of a Fourth of July picnic with snakes?
OFFICER BARBRADY
[From under the desk.] Oh, I like snakes. You light 'em and they grow and grow.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Wait a minute. That's it! I got it! This Fourth of July, South Park will make history by having the largest snake in the world! The press will love it. I'll be on the front pa-- [Swoons.] Oooooogh...
OFFICER BARBRADY
I found him.
[Bus Stop. The boys (still wearing coats) stand still, completely oblivious.]
STAN
Man, it's hot out here.
CARTMAN
What do you guys want to do? We've got the whole summer to play!
KYLE
Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks.
STAN
I know! Let's go sledding!
KYLE
Yeah!
[Top of a hill. The boys have brought their sled, and Cartman is left to go on.]
STAN
Come on, Cartman, get on.
CARTMAN
Stan?
KYLE
Let's go, dude. We're ready.
STAN
What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?
CARTMAN
Guys? Don't you notice anything wrong with this picture?
KYLE
Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!
CARTMAN
Ugh... Whatever.
[He hops on. The sled goes down just a bit, then stops.]
STAN
What the hell is going on?
[Jimbo and Ned drive by in their Hummer.]
JIMBO
Hey there, boys!
STAN
Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
JIMBO
How come you're not blowin' things up? It's summer.
KYLE
Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands.
JIMBO
What?!
STAN
Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year.
JIMBO
Oh my God! [Revs up.] Well, don't worry boys, Uncle Jimbo is on the case. [Drives off.] Buckle your seat belt, Ned.
NED
Mmmm-where are we going?
JIMBO
México, my amigo.
NED
Mmmm-why are we going to México?
JIMBO
To buy fireworks. Just 'cause some kid blew off his hands doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer, now, does it?
NED
Are fireworks legal in Mexico?
JIMBO
Hell, everything's legal in México. It's the American way.
[Jimbo drives through mountains in the distance.]
[Back at City Hall, the Mayor is holding a meeting. A man is shown with an easel and a large notebook.]
CHARLIE
At the Dyno Might Firework Company, we have a commitment to excellence. Our focus is on safety while--
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake!
CHARLIE
Oh, o-kay. [To himself.] Let's see...
[He turns the pages up and over. Page 1: Dyno Might Safe and Spicy; Section 1: Introduction; Section 2: Safety Features; Section 3: We Value the Customer... Now to design specifications.]
CHARLIE
Now, the disk that we are making is approximately 5,000 times bigger than the average snake.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Ooooh!
CHARLIE
We'll have to fly it in with three Comanche helicopters and lower it onto the ground at the lake.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[Writes notes.] Comanche helicopters...
CHARLIE
[Flips page.] Then we'll need 57 flamethrowers, all set up around the perimeter of the disk, that are all triggered to fire at the same time.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
...flamethrowers, triggered at the same time...
[Charlie flips the page. A giant smiling snake is shown rising out of the disk.]
CHARLIE
Once lit, the snake will grow.
[He turns the page and vaudevillian Abe Vigoda is shown.]
CHARLIE
And good times will be had by all.
[The Mayor and her aides clap.]
AIDE 1
Wonderful.
AIDE 2
Spectacular.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Well, you see? Fireworks at the lake will not only go on, but perhaps be the best ever. Wait a minute! We're gonna need an orchestra to play The Stars and Stripes!
AIDE 1
Hey! How about the elementary school orchestra? They had a great version of Mary Had a Little Lamb at their last concert.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Yes! Get the school principal on the phone! And we need somebody to dress up like Uncle Remus!
AIDE 2
Uh, Mayor, I think you mean Uncle Sam?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Of course I do, you fuckin' asshole!
[On the side of a road. The boys are building a snowman, but out of mud. A mudman.]
KYLE
[Singing.]
Dusty the dirtball...
STAN
Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?
KYLE
Hey, look, it's Mr. Garrison.
MR. GARRISON
Hello, children. How is your summer going?
STAN
Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison.
KYLE
Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?
MR. GARRISON
Oh, that old thing? Why, I almost forgot he was gone. I don't need Mr. Hat.
STAN
That's good.
[Long pause.]
MR. GARRISON
Mr. Hat is just a puppet.
KYLE
Yup.
[Long pause.]
MR. GARRISON
Mr. Hat isn't real.
STAN
Right.
[Long pause. Mr. Garrison walks away.]
CARTMAN
Hey, you guys, my mom signed me up for swimming lessons at the community pool. You wanna come?
[Kenny, Stan and Kyle laugh at him.]
STAN
Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard.
CARTMAN
It is not!
STAN
Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.
KYLE
Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee.
CARTMAN
[angry] I am not swimming around in pee!
STAN
Whatever, dude.
CARTMAN
My mom says that if I take swimming lessons, I could be in the Olympics someday.
KYLE
[Grins with Stan.] Yeah, the Fat Ass Olympics.
CARTMAN
I'm trying to make the best out of a bad situation! I don't need to hear crap from a bunch of hippie freaks living in denial! Screw you guys! I'm going home.
STAN
But Cartman, we're trying to--
CARTMAN
No, screw you guys. Home. [Leaves.]
STAN
What does he mean, "living in denial"?
KYLE
Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always.
[Stan hops up to put a carrot on the mudman as a nose.]
STAN
There, how does that look?
KYLE
Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.
STAN
Uh, crap..!
[Community Pool. Kids are swimming and diving, and a lifeguard looks over the scene. Cartman, however dips his toes into the water and shudders.]
CARTMAN
Eh-eh-eh-eh...
[He backs away as the instructor blows her whistle.]
INSTRUCTOR
Okay kids, everyone in the pool!
[The kids jump in.]
INSTRUCTOR
Come on, Eric, we're gonna start now.
CARTMAN
Nuh-uh.
INSTRUCTOR
Just jump in.
CARTMAN
I don't wanna.
INSTRUCTOR
It's not gonna hurt ya, hon. Just do it.
[Cartman holds his breath, covers his nose and jumps in.]
CARTMAN
Egh--
[He comes up and treads water. Cartman splutters.]
INSTRUCTOR
There you go! Now just let the first graders swim by you, and then head towards us.
CARTMAN
Huh? First graders?
[The first graders swim by, but stop to look at him. Yellow pools of pee appear in front of them. They swim away.]
CARTMAN
Awww! Weak! Weak! Oh, these sons of bitches!
[South Park. Stark's Pond. Bleachers are being set up for the Fourth of July picnic, and a chili and doughnut stand goes up.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Where the hell is our firework? We only have 24 hours!
AIDE 2
I'm sure it'll be here any second.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Shut up!
AIDE 2
Copy that.
[Meanwhile, at a stage where the children of South Park Elementary are practicing The Stars and Stripes...]
MR. ROMERO
Okay, children, I'm sure we're a little rusty. Where is Eric Cartman?
STAN
He's taking swimming lessons.
MR. ROMERO
Oh, dear. How are we supposed to sound good without our French horn section? Oh, let's try some scales first. C scale first. And...
[They start playing the scale (F# first), but everyone is playing out of key, creating a god-awful mix of noises.]
MR. ROMERO
Okay, that was pretty good. Let's play Mozart's Symphony No. 5.
[They try, but it is yet another god-awful mix of noises.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Oh, we're doomed. Our Fourth of July celebration is going to have no fireworks and a bunch of tone-deaf little shits playing.
[She see something.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Wait a minute... It's the snake!
[The snake appears over the mountain transported by the three Comanche helicopters. Everyone stops to watch.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Let's move along, people. If you've seen one giant snake-thingy firework, you've seen them all.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Call everybody! The show's back on! Come on, we've only got one day to prepare!
[Mexico. Jimbo and Ned pass by a store that sells cohetes. They stop and walk back to it.]
JIMBO
Buenos dias, mi amigo. Yo soy un Americano espectacularrr. (Good morning, my friend. I am a spectacular American.)
PROPRIETOR
¿Qué? (What?)
JIMBO
Yo necesito el fireworko spectacularrrr. (I need the spectacular firework.)
PROPRIETOR
¿Necesita usted un cohete grande? (Do you need a large rocket?)
NED
Nnnn-no moleste el gato spectacularrrr. (Do not disturb the spectacular cat.)
[The proprietor pulls out a large box and places it on the counter.]
JIMBO
Would you look at that, Ned? That's a Tijuana bottle rocket! These babies have enough power to blast a fiery hole right through the ozone.
NED
Mmmm-they're spectacularrrr.
JIMBO
Ned, it's our job to get these to children all over America for the Fourth of July.
[He and Ned take a rocket each.]
JIMBO
We'll be like Santa Claus on Christmas morning.
NED
Hmmm-bueyno.
[Mr. Garrison's house. Garrison is on his chair, looking at the TV tensely. Then the telephone rings...]
MR. GARRISON
Hello?
CALLER (MR. MACKEY)
Hello, is Mr. Hat there?
MR. GARRISON
Is this some kind of joke?
CALLER (MR. MACKEY)
[snickers] Yes.
MR. GARRISON
You go to hell! You go to hell and you die! I'm gonna find out who you are!
CALLER (MR. MACKEY)
I don't think you can, m'kay.
[Mr. Garrison hangs up.]
MR. GARRISON
Goddammit..!
[He turns on the TV to PBS, when Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop are on.]
SHARI LEWIS
So, Lamb Chop, what would you like to do today?
LAMB CHOP
Well, I'd like to sing you a song.
SHARI
Hey, let's sing one to-gether!
LAMB CHOP
As long as we're together,
we can do anything
We can take on the whole darn world
We're happy as clams,
with plenty of pearls
Through thick and thin,
we've always been to-geth-er...
[Mr. Garrison descends into madness as the song progresses, until he imagines himself going to her studio.]
SHARI
Whoa-aagghh! Aagghh! Aggh!
[Mr. Garrison approaches, and with a small ax, chops off Lamb Chop from Shari's hand and tosses it onto a lit barbecue grill. Flames rise up and engulf Lamb Chop.]
SHARI
No! Lamb Chop, no!
LAMB CHOP
Shari, help me... It burns! It burns..!
[Mr. Garrison is shown smiling away on his armchair, having dreamed out his anger.]
[Meanwhile, over at the Community Pool. The swimming instructor has five swimmers in front of her at the deep end, and Cartman stands alone at the shallow end.]
INSTRUCTOR
Eric, you have to get in the deep end sooner or later.
CARTMAN
Later's fine.
INSTRUCTOR
Just do your side stroke.
CARTMAN
I only know how to do it doggie style.
INSTRUCTOR
That's doggie-paddle, Eric. Now come over here!
CARTMAN
Can I do it doggie style?
INSTRUCTOR
Okay.
[Cartman starts paddling towards her.]
INSTRUCTOR
That's it! That's it, you can do it!
CARTMAN
Sweet..!
[Three first graders swim by, leaving yellow trails. That stops him.]
CARTMAN
Awww, dammit! Aw, not again!
INSTRUCTOR
Come on, Eric!
CARTMAN
No way! Those sons of bitches! I'm going home.
[News 4. Our top story tonight...]
ANCHOR
Fourth of July is finally here, and with the state-wide ban on fireworks, people from all over Colorado are flocking to South Park. Here with a special report is a normal-looking guy with a funny name.
CREAMY GOODNESS
Thanks, Tom. It looks like the firework ban won't be putting a damper on one town's festivities tonight. I'm here at Stark's Pond in South Park, where the crowd of residents and scores of tourists anxiously await the lighting of the largest snake in human history.
[Some of the folks have picnic blankets set out and many are mugging for the camera.]
CREAMY GOODNESS
Now, as most of you will probably remember, snakes are these little round disks that you light, and they spew out a little snake of black ash. Well, the South Park snake is over half a mile in diameter, and twenty stories high. I'm told that this event won't begin until the sun goes down and night is upon us.
[So it is said, so it is done.]
CREAMY GOODNESS
Alrighty then, looks like we're ready.
[Orchestra stage. Everyone is present and ready to play.]
STAN
How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman?
CARTMAN
Fine.
KYLE
I heard you won't even get in the deep end.
CARTMAN
Well, you heard wrong, hippie!
[A wide view of Stark's Pond and everyone in the area around it. Then, the mayor is on the main stage with her aides about to address the crowd.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Ladies and gentlemen, good citizens of Colorado. It's my pleasure to be the first person to wish you all a happy Fourth of July! Let's start with our school band playing The Stars and Stripes!
MR. ROMERO
This is it. And a-one and a-two and a...
[The kids begin to play, and the result is as bad as in practice. The audience members are covering their ears.]
AUDIENCE
Ooohhhh..!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
What is fuck is that?!
AIDE 2
I think it's The Stars and Stripes.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Oh, hell. Light the snake!
[Everyone cheers. About 57 people with flamethrowers step forward and fire up the snake.]
AUDIENCE
Ooooooh!
[The snake begins to bulge.]
AUDIENCE
Ahhhhh!
[The Mayor is pleased with success.]
[Mexico; night. Jimbo and Ned are almost close to the border.]
JIMBO:
Alright, Ned. Now we're coming up to the American border. They can't know that we have fireworks in the trunk. Just let me do the talking.
[Ned says nothing. Jimbo laughs.]
JIMBO
I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it?
[Jimbo laughs some more. They arrive at the Border. Jimbo and Ned drive up. The border guard greets them.]
GUARD
Good evening, gentlemen.
JIMBO
Hello there, fellow American. We're just anxious to get back to our homeland.
GUARD
Alright, I just need to ask you a few questions.
JIMBO
Fire away, we have nothing to hide.
GUARD
Is anyone other than the two of you traveling in this vehicle?
JIMBO
No, sir.
GUARD
Do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?
JIMBO
Yes. [Ned recoils.] I mean, no! No!
[The gurad brings out his flashlight and turns it on.]
GUARD
Open your trunk, please, sir.
[He moves toward the trunk.]
JIMBO
Damn! Damn! I always get that question wrong!
[Stark's Pond. The crowds are still cheering and the band is still playing, and the snake is still growing. Cartman intently turns a page at his sheet music.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
My God, it's beautiful. It never fails to amaze me how I manage to overcome adversity.
[The snake is still growing, and the Mayor frowns.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Say uh, Charlie, when does that thing die out?
CHARLIE
Die out?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Yes, you know, expire, end.
[Long pause. Charlie looks up and back.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Hello? I'm asking you when it stops?
CHARLIE
Uhhh, I'm not sure; I never made one this big.
[The snake keeps growing.]
CHARLIE
I guess we didn't quite think this through, did we?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
What?!
KYLE
[Looking up.] Dude! That thing is huge!
STAN
Yeah, they need to shut it off.
CARTMAN
[Distracted.] Hey! You guys are screwin' up the song!
[The crowd becomes nervous as well as awed.]
MAN 1
Somebody stop it!
MAN 2
It's out of control!
[Everyone runs away screaming as the snake starts to bend, then part of the snake falls off.]
STAN/KYLE/ CARTMAN
Aarrgghh!!
[All the children jump off the stage. Kenny, however...]
KYLE
Kenny! Watch out!
[The piece of the snake hits the stage.]
KENNY
(Waarrggh!!)
[Kenny jumps clear and lands under the bleachers.]
KENNY
(Dude! You guys, I really, really don't have time to tell you that-- Argghh..!)
[The snake mows down the bleachers, crushing Kenny.]
STAN
Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
KYLE
You bastard!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[Horrified.] Oh my God! [Grabs Charlie.] You tell me, how much longer this thing is gonna last?!
CHARLIE
Let's see. A normal-size snake lasts three minutes... [Mutters indistinctly.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
So when does it run out?!
CHARLIE
November. Of next year.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Oh, hell..!
[People are running and screaming away from the snake. Kyle picks up a violin and starts playing a dirge. Stan returns and looks at him, then takes up his own violin. Cartman, Bill, Fosse, and Tolkien join in and take up their instruments; and they all start playing "Nearer My God To Thee" in tune.]
[July 5th, 6 a.m., Stark's Pond. News 4 coverage resumes.]
CREAMY GOODNESS
Well, we're coming up on nine hours, and the giant snake of South Park shows no signs of stopping. Residents have tried everything from fire-hoses to yelling at it to make the snake stop, but nothing seems to work.
TOM
Thanks, Creamy. Police are advising all citizens to stay indoors, not breathe the ashen air, and not ever light any giant snakes in the near future.
[The snake is now some thirty feet wide and moving down South Park's main thoroughfare, incinerating everything in its path.]
STAN
Man, this sucks.
KYLE
What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!
STAN
We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.
CARTMAN
Where is Chef?
[Somewhere, in the Caribbean, Chef is singing to three waitresses, one of them holding a phone.]
CHEF
[Slowly.]
Baby, you know you're the girl for me-ee
And all that I want to be-ee-ee is...
[Quickly.]
You and me
And her; simultaneous
You and me, and you and you
Simultaneous lovin', baby
Two or three; simultaneous
Ooh, that's right...
[The phone rings and Chef answers it.] Hello? What? Oh, hello, children. It's a what?... A giant snake?... Killing everybody?!... Growing bigger?!... Children, you know I rarely say this but... Well, fudge ya. [He hangs up and resumes singing.]
Simultaneous, you and me
And you and you
Simultaneous lovin', baby
Two or three...
[South Park. The smoke is heavy in the air. Stan hangs up the phone.]
KYLE
What'd he say?
STAN
Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves.
CARTMAN
Wow.
KYLE
How is that gonna help?
[National News, on the U.S. map behind the anchor, the snake is shown having separated into four snakes. The first has gone through the Northwest and backtracked into Canada. The second has gone into the Great Plains and is headed for the East Coast. The third has gone down into Texas and the South, and the fourth has gone through the Southwest and is now in Northern Mexico.]
ANCHOR
All over America, the effects of the giant ash snake of South Park can be seen.
[Utah, Mormons are gathered for a baptism at a river.]
PREACHER
Yea, let the spirit of Heavenly Father be blessed upon you.
[The preacher dunks the catechumen into the river.]
ASSISTANT
From this day on, all will be well.
[The new member pops up.]
NEW MORMON
I already feel like things are getting better.
[Snake One comes and engulfs them all.]
[New York.]
MR. GARRISON
And I can't sleep or think...
[Inside a psychiatrist's office, Mr. Garrison lies on a couch.]
MR. GARRISON
Where would he have gone? Why would he leave?
DR. KATZ
Well um, let me ask you this. Why? Wher-where do you think... Mr. Hat... went?
MR. GARRISON
How the fuck should I know? If I knew that, I wouldn't be seein' a fuckin' psychiatrist, would I?
DR. KATZ
Well… I guess, I-I see what you're saying. Yeah.
MR. GARRISON
At first I was sure one of the children took him, but then I remembered that Mr. Hat and I actually had a fight that morning.
DR. KATZ
Um... Ahem...
[Long pause.]
DR. KATZ
Are you gay?
MR. GARRISON
What?!
DR. KATZ
[Stammers.] It-it's j-just-- It's just a question.
MR. GARRISON
Are you propositioning me?
DR. KATZ
No.
MR. GARRISON
Well, I can tell that that I am 100% not gay!
DR. KATZ
Well, I believe you, I... absolutely believe you.
MR. GARRISON
Mr. Hat, on the other hand...
DR. KATZ
Mr. Hat was gay?
MR. GARRISON
Sometimes he fantasizes about same-sex relations.
DR. KATZ
I see.
MR. GARRISON
Sometimes Mr. Hat liked to pretend he was in a sauna with Brett Favre, and a bottle of Thousand Island dressing.
DR. KATZ
That I did not need to know.
MR. GARRISON
Well, I'm just sayin'.
MR. KATZ
Mr. Garrison, I think that Mr. Hat was actually your gay side trying to come out. You see, it's-it's you that's gay, but, but you're in denial, so...you act out your gay persona with a homosexual puppet.
[Mr. Garrison doesn't say anything.]
DR. KATZ
What do you think about that?
MR. GARRISON
I think you're the loony one in this room.
[Snake Two bounds over several buildings, knocking them off their foundations. It smashes through the window and burns Dr. Katz to the bone.]
MR. GARRISON
Serves you right, you gay-bashing homo.
[Meanwhile, inside a Texas prison, Jimbo and Ned share a cell.]
JIMBO
Well, Ned, looks like we missed Fourth of July again.
NED
Mmmmmmm-yup.
JIMBO
Dammit! Those poor kids must have been so disappointed to have nothin' but them stupid wussy snakes to light.
NED
Mmm-well better luck next year.
JIMBO
Yeah, you're right. Okay, let's try again.
NED
[Reads cue card.] Mmmm-is anyone other than the two of you riding in this vehicle?
JIMBO
No.
NED
Mmmm-do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?
JIMBO
[Hesitantly.] Yes?
[Ned shakes his head.]
JIMBO
Dammit! I got it wrong again! What's the answer again?
[Snake Three makes its way to the prison and smashes through the wall of their cell. Jimbo is startled.]
JIMBO
Holy smokes! What the hell is that?
NED
Mmm-it looks like my ex-wife!
JIMBO
Quick, Ned! This is our chance! The Hummer's outside!
[Green Bay, Wisconsin. Sports Spa. Brett Favre enters and removes his shirt, but keeps his towel on. Mr. Hat is already seated on the lower bench.]
BRETT FAVRE
Hi. I hasn't seen you in here before.
[Mr. Hat blinks and looks at him.]
[City Hall. The coverage continues.]
REPORTER
As more and more cities are affected by the growing ash and the death toll rises to 3,000...
[A tree inexplicably falls over.]
REPORTER
...people from all over the country are looking to the Mayor of South Park for answers.
[The hall doors open and the Mayor's aides step forward.]
REPORTER
...And it appears as if the Mayor is going to explain matters now.
AIDE 1
Uh, ladies and gentlemen, the Mayor of South Park regrets that she cannot be here herself, but she is... sick.
REPORTER 2
"Sick"?! What kind of lame excuse is that?
PRINT REPORTER
You gotta be kidding me!
REPORTER 3
Oh, this is ridiculous!
REPORTER 4
Come on, we want answers.
AIDE 2
Sh-she's having her period.
[The reporters fall silent. Reporter 3 gasps quietly.]
REPORTER 4
[Softly.] Oh.
AIDE 1
We do, however, have an official statement for all the concerned cities about the matter with the giant snake that we can't seem to put out.
[Aide 2 pulls out a statement and reads it.]
AIDE 2
"We're sorry. Our bad."
AIDE 1
Thank you, that is all.
[They turn around and go back into City Hall. The reporters are left grousing.]
[Meanwhile at the Community Pool. Notice reads:
POOL CLOSED
Due to Hazardous
SNAKE FIREWORK
Cartman is all alone in the swimming pool.]
CARTMAN
Okay. No first graders around. I can swim to the deep end.
[He starts swimming to the deep end.]
CARTMAN
Yeah... I can do it. I can do it. I can-- I'm gonna make it.
[From his view. The diving board is getting closer and closer.]
[Meanwhile, in outer space, the snakes can be seen growing longer and longer across the face of the nation.]
[Back at Stark's Pond, the disk is still producing the snake. Stan and Kyle sit under a tree with nothing to do, and next to them a man rests on a poster with a message: "Repent - The end is here".]
STAN
How many days left in summer?
KYLE
A lot, I think.
STAN
Dammit! I just want it to snow again!
KYLE
I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon.
[Jimbo and Ned arrive.]
JIMBO
Buenos gracias, boys.
STAN
Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
JIMBO
Oh, now, why the long faces?
KYLE
We're bored.
STAN
There's nothin' to do.
JIMBO
Well, I don't think those are problems...
[Jimbo]
JIMBO
...that some Tijuana bottle rockets can't solve!
STAN/KYLE
Hooray!
JIMBO
Careful with those, now, those are dangerous.
[Stan and Kyle set up the rockets and Jimbo lights them. The rockets are as big as the boys.]
JIMBO
Point 'em away from your eyes, now.
KYLE
Wow! These are huge!
JIMBO
Aw, look at 'em, Ned. Look how much happiness a little firepower can bring to a child.
[The rockets are launched and they head for the snake. Upon impact, the snake falls apart, and the base of it loses its fire. Ash now rains down upon everyone.]
STAN
Hey, look! We blew up the snake!
[Everyone cheers.]
CITIZEN
All the ash from the snake is putting the flame out.
JIMBO
Well, how do you like that? Bottle rockets saved the Fourth of July!
STAN/KYLE
Hooray!
[A crowd begins to gather, meanwhile, back at the community pool, Cartman has almost reached his goal.]
CARTMAN
I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it to the deep end.
[He touches the wall at the 9½ foot mark.]
CARTMAN
I did it! I did it! I made it to the deep end! Hooray for me!
INSTRUCTOR
[Off-screen.] The snake's been destroyed. [Removes notice.] The pool's open!
CARTMAN
Huh?
[All the first graders jump into the pool, the water turns yellow in a matter of seconds.]
CARTMAN
Oh, no, you sons of bitches! Aww, sons of bitches..!
[He makes his way out along the edge of the pool.]
[Stark's Pond.]
CITIZEN 2
Look! They put out the snake!
[Everyone cheers.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Yes! Apparently, my plan to-o blow up the snake worked perfectly.
[Ned, Jimbo, Stan and Kyle look at her.]
KYLE
Hey, look! It's snowing!
[The others, and the crowd, look and ponder.]
JIMBO
Well, it's snowing black ash, but what the hell.
[Clyde, Annie, Red, and Tolkien, cheer, and dance around in the ash.]
[The mountains are now capped in ash. Stan and Kyle work on an ash man, and Pip is singing with his family once again. (His parents are not dead.) Clyde and another kid take a sled down an ash drift.]
STAN
Winter's back!
[Mr. Garrison walks up with Mr. Twig, his new puppet which is a stick with a little purple shirt with a pink triangle on it.]
MR. GARRISON
Wow, it's a black blizzard!
KYLE
Mr. Garrison, where's Mr. Hat?
MR. GARRISON
Oh, I'm through with Mr. Hat. He's a two-timin' whore. From now on, children, you're all gonna be learning from Mr. Twig.
MR. TWIG
That's right, children. I'll see you in the fall.
STAN
Well, I can hardly wait.
[South Park, a few days later, Chef drives up and steps out of his car.]
CHEF
Hey, children, everybody! I'm back! I'm back from Aruba! What the..?
[Before him, some kids play on ash-covered ground. They are pretty much in blackface. Cartman has joined Stan and Kyle in working on the ashman.]
STAN
Hey, Chef!
CARTMAN
How's it going?
[Chef looks left. A couple is clearing out ash from the main street.]
MAN
Howdy, Chef. How was your summer vacation?
[Long pause.]
CHEF
Okay! E-verbody get in a line, so I can whoop all your asses!
[End Credits. "Simultaneous Lovin'" plays.]
End of Summer Sucks


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:South Park's first film festival attracts crowds of tofu-eating movie lovers to the quiet town, badly affecting Mr. Hankey. Chef makes some money by selling his chocolate salty balls.

script:Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls

[Sundance Film Festival. A small Western town. Bustling sounds are heard as the camera slowly pans down. A crowd streams by in the background behind a sports car and limo, and front and center are Robert Redford and a woman.]
ROBERT REDFORD
Why do we hold the Sundance Film Festival here, Phyllis? It's so painfully crowded.
PHYLLIS
Because. People from L.A. love to come to a quaint little mountain town for a few days, and this gives them an excuse.
ROBERT REDFORD
No, this used to be a quaint little mountain town. Now look at it. Sushi restaurants, upscale clothes stores, $25 parking, Liam Neeson... I tell you, Phyllis, I think we've tapped this town's resources out. We must move the festival to another small mountain town and begin again.
PHYLLIS
That's not a bad idea. But where?
[South Park. Winter is indeed back. A man hums as he arrives at the town flag pole with a purple flag and runs it up to the top. It unfurls, revealing: 1st Annual South Park Film Festival. A crowd instantly pours in and mills about.]
MAN IN BACKGROUND
Ching ching cha-ching.
MAN IN FOREGROUND
Whoa.
[South Park Elementary.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children. I have some very exciting news for you... Oo-why don't you tell them, Mr. Twig?
MR. TWIG
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The First Annual South Park Film Festival begins today.
WENDY
Wow! Cool!
KYLE
They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they?
MR. GARRISON
Nono, Kyle. These are independent films.
STAN
Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too.
CARTMAN
No, dude, independent films are those black and white hippie movies. They're always about gay cowboys eating pudding.
WENDY
No they're not! Independent films are produced outside the Hollywood system. They're movies about all the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.
CARTMAN
Byeh, sure. Well, you show me one independent film that isn't about gay cowboys eating pudding!
WENDY
Once again, you have no idea what you're talking about, fatass!
CARTMAN
I'm not fat! I just haven't grown into my body yet, skinny bitch!
WENDY
(Gasp)!
MR. GARRISON
Eric, if you call Wendy a bitch one more time, I'm sending you to the principal's office!
[Cartman looks around for a second.]
CARTMAN
...bitch.
MR. GARRISON
That's it Eric, you-!
CARTMAN
I'm going!
[He hops off his chair and walks out, closing the door behind him.]
MR. GARRISON
Anyway, children, I want you all to see at least one independent film at the festival and then write a paper about it.
[The class groans.]
MR. GARRISON
The first film showing is called Witness To Denial, and it's a sexual exploration piece about two women in love.
STAN
Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer.
[There's certainly a lot of people now. Two of them are talking on cell phones.]
DIRECTOR 1
Norma, I want to shoot the script next month with Demi Moore instead.
DIRECTOR 2
[In shorts!] Well you can tell Spielberg he can kiss my ass!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[Walking about with one of her aides.] Wow, look at this, Johnson. Traffic jams at every intersection, hoards of people pushing their way through the crowd. It's almost like we're a real city.
[After school and the kids are out in the town.]
CARTMAN
I can't believe I got sent to the principal's office because of your stupid girlfriend!
STAN
She's not my girlfriend.
KENNY
(Yeah, not when you vomit on her all the time like that.)
[Cartman and Kyle laugh.]
KYLE
Sick, Kenny.
STAN
Damn, dude. Look at all these people.
DIRECTOR 3
[Rushing by with a cell phone.] I'm late for a screening, I'll call you from the theater.
KYLE
All this for a bunch of stupid movies?
[They come upon a stand that says
CHEF'S
SOUL FOOD]
CHEF
Hello there, children!
THE BOYS
Hey, Chef.
STAN
Whatcha doin'?
CHEF
Children, this whole film festival thing has quite lucrative monetary possibilities. Now I'm gonna sell some of my famous cookies, to these Hollywood types, and make a mint!
CARTMAN
What kind of cookies?
STAN
Calm down, tubby.
CHEF
They're little cookies, with fudge in the middle. And I call them, "Fudge 'Ems".
[Chef pulls out a box with that name on them.]
CARTMAN
I wanna Fudge 'Em.
CHEF
I can just see the commercial now. "Wife got you down? Boss makin' you angry? Kids yellin' atcha? Well, Fudge 'Ems."
KYLE
Cool!
CHEF
And I've also got my double chocolate cookies, "Fudge This."
DIRECTOR 3
[Passing by with his date.] Oh look, one of the natives is selling local food wares... how quaint.
WOMAN
This is why I come to these things, to get away from L.A. and become one with the more simple culture.
CHEF
Well, perhaps you'd like to try my low-calorie cookies, "Go Fudge Yourself," or my all-natural, "I Don't Really Give A Flying Fudge."
WOMAN
Ooh, do you have any tofu or steamed celery?
CHEF
Huh?
DIRECTOR 3
I would kill for some cous cous right now.
CHEF
Whose goose?
WOMAN
Uuuuh, never mind. We brought some food from the Natural Market in L.A.
DIRECTOR 3
Cute sign, though.
[The couple leaves, and Chef looks confused. Wendy walks up.]
WENDY
Stan, I have two tickets for the opening film of the festival. Would you like to come with me?
CARTMAN
[Taunting.] Stan, nunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh hunh. Tunh tunh tunh tunh tinh teenh?
STAN
Shut up, Cartman! [To Wendy.] Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway. [They walk away.]
CARTMAN
She'll be the death of him, Kyle. Mark my words: she'll be the death of him.
KYLE
If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over.
CHEF
Get 'em while they're hot! My all new cookies! "I Just Went And Fudged Your Momma!"
CARTMAN
[To Kyle.] Jesus, he sure ran that one into the ground.
[At the Bijou, South Park's movie theater. Now playing: Witness To Denial. Stan sits in the front row with Wendy.]
STAN
When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.
WENDY
Stan, film festival movies usually don't have previews before them.
STAN
They what?!
[The projectionist starts the film. Only the right half of a woman is shown in close-up. The sound is overmodulated.]
CANDICE
Who are you to judge my womanly soul?
[Her girlfriend appears far in the background.]
CANDICE
The Goddess flames that burn in my memory aren't dark. Dare you call them dark!
[They switch places. The girlfriend's left side appears in close-up.]
CANDICE
Here lies the Goddess truth of my body.
STAN
[With soda and popcorn.] Oh, brother.
CANDICE
The Goddess that cries, "Freedom!"
[Her hands cover her mouth.]
CANDICE
Here is the Goddess truth of my womanly being
[Stan puts his left hand on the arm rest. Wendy reaches for his soda and takes a sip. In a new scene, Candice is talking to her lover, who wears a Lilith Fare shirt.]
CANDICE
You are my blossom, my flame. When we make love, it's like the sun is right outside the door.
CANDICE'S GIRLFRIEND
Then make love to me, right now
[The two of them embrace and drop out of view.]
STAN
Dude!
WENDY
Sshh!
STAN
Dude!
[Kyle's house. He's in the restroom crapping away.]
KYLE
I can see clearly now, the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way-
SHEILA
[From the master bedroom.] Bubbeleh you need to get to bed! It's late!
KYLE
I'm poopies, ma!
SHEILA
Well, hurry up!
KYLE
Gone are the dark clouds that had me-
MR. HANKEY
[Voice only, slowly, with echo.] Ky-yle! Ky-yle!
[Kyle looks down into the toilet.]
KYLE
Could it be?
MR. HANKEY
[In his shrill voice.] Hooowwwdy ho!
[Kyle hops off and looks into the toilet. No poo is seen.]
KYLE
Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello?
[Day two of the South Park Film Festival.]
TOM
I'm here live in South Park, Colorado, where citizens from Los Angeles are arriving in droves for the town's first annual film festival. This is just a small quiet mountain community where nothing out of the ordinary ever really happens, [Softly.] except for the occasional complete destruction of the entire town [Normally.] and so the excitement level is naturally very high. Right now, the townspeople are anxiously awaiting the arrival of some of Hollywood's top celebrities.
[At the Bijou, the boys are watching "The Body Decayeth".]
KYLE
It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey!
CARTMAN
Wait, I thought Mr. Hankey only came at Christmastime.
KYLE
Well, I'm sure it was him.
MAN
Look, look! Here comes somebody!
[People come closer as a limousine pulls up. Someone steps out.]
A WOMAN
Move aside, I can't see.
TOM
Ladies and gentlemen, TV's Fred Savage.
[Fred Savage steps out of the limo wearing a shirt that says, 'I'm Fred Savage'.]
CROWD
[In disappointment.] AAWWWW!
[Fred's head drops as the limo and crowd scurries away.]
TOM
Well, I'm sure a real person will show up soon.
KYLE
So how was that movie last night, dude?
STAN
Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know!
CARTMAN
It had a bunch of gay cowboys eating pudding, huh?
STAN
Yeah, pretty much.
CARTMAN
Yeah!
STAN
The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen.
KYLE
Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass.
[Stan and Kenny laugh.]
CARTMAN
Ay!
STAN
Yeah, but that'd be like IMAX.
[Kyle and Kenny laugh.]
CARTMAN
Okay, that's enough fat-ass jokes for this week.
KENNY
(Cartman's ass is so fuckin' huge that they could probably show six stupid films on it and still have some room, heheheheheh.)
[Stan and Kyle laugh.]
CARTMAN
Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm going home.
[Cartman looks around, but doesn't go anywhere.]
KYLE
Well?
CARTMAN
I'm gonna, just give me a minute.
ROBERT REDFORD
This is perfect. Why didn't we think of it sooner? This town still has some charm left, not the mess we turned Park City into.
PHYLLIS
Forgive me for being observant, but, won't we just end up doing the same thing to this town?
ROBERT REDFORD
Yes. And the town after, and the town after that. Like termites, we will move this film festival from town to town until we have used it up. And then move on, until every quiet mountain town is like Los Angeles.
PHYLLIS
Why? Why would we do such a thing?
ROBERT REDFORD
Because we have to live in L.A. And if we can't live in quiet, simple, peaceful mountain towns, then nobody will!
[He laughs maniacally.]
ROBERT REDFORD
Waitwaitwait. Zoom in to a close-up of my face when I do that. Ready? Then NOBODY will!
[The camera moves in as he laughs maniacally again.]
ROBERT REDFORD
That's it.
[The kids pass by Chef's booth. Cartman is still with them. Now the booth says "Chef's Salty Balls"]
CHEF
Children! I'm glad you're here! I want you to check out my new confectioneries. I think they're going to sell right through the roof! I call them, "Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls."
[He brings out the cookie tray to show them. The boys say nothing.]
STAN
Are they good?
CHEF
Try 'em.
STAN
Hey, dude, these are good!
CARTMAN
Yeah, I love these Salty Chocolate Balls, Chef.
[Kenny laughs at Cartman's unintended double entendre.]
MR. HANKEY
[From under the runoff grate.] Ky-yle!
KYLE
There it is again!
[Stan and Kyle have traded places.]
STAN
There is what again?
[Kyle looks left.]
MR. HANKEY
[Moaning.] Ky-yle!
KYLE
It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble.
[Mr. Hankey's theme song begins to play.]
STAN
Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?
KYLE
Where does that grill go?
STAN
To the sewer, dude.
KYLE
Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!
[He walks off, but stops when no one follows.]
KYLE
Come on!
[The boys have left, Chef starts to sing.]
CHEF
Hey, everybody,
have you seen my balls?
They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick-me-up,
just stick my balls in your mouth
Ooooo, suck on my cho-colate salty balls
put 'em in your mouth
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em and suck 'em...
[The boys are now in the sewer with flashlights in hand. A rat clamors up a pipe and out of view. Spiderwebs are everywhere.]
CARTMAN
Aw, man, smells like ass down here.
KYLE
Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer!
[A sound is heard and the boys quickly turn to look.]
STAN
What was that?
[The beam of his flashlight lands on a rat.]
CARTMAN
Aw, man, let's get out of here!
KYLE
We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey.
[They look ahead, only to see something making splashes in the water.]
THE BOYS
Aaaaah!
KENNY
(Wait!)
[The figure rises and turns, only to reveal itself as a snorkeling human, Mr. Garrison, with him is Mr. Twig.]
KYLE
What the hell?
[Mr. Garrison removes his mouthpiece.]
STAN
Mr. Garrison?
MR. GARRISON
Oh uh- hello, children.
CARTMAN
What are you doing down in the sewer with a bunch of snorkel stuff on?
MR. GARRISON
Oh I- I was just-uh hangin' out.
KYLE
In a sewer?
MR. GARRISON
Children, do you know how to file a police report?
THE BOYS
No.
MR. GARRISON
Good. See you in school.
[He puts his mouthpiece back on and drops into the water. The boys are stunned, but walk forward.]
CARTMAN
This is ridiculous! What the hell are we, the Goonies?
KYLE
Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?
CARTMAN
Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm home.
MR. HANKEY
Hooowwwdy ho!
[The boys turn to see Mr. Hankey rowing in a paper fries tray.]
KYLE
Mr. Hankey!
MR. HANKEY
Howdy-ho, boys.
KYLE
I told you guys he'd be here!
MR. HANKEY
Gosh, look at yuh. You're all growin' up sho fasht.
CARTMAN
[Displeased.] Hi, Mr. Hankey. Nice to see yuh.
MR. HANKEY
Have you all been brushing behind your teeth?
THE BOYS
Yes.
MR. HANKEY
And usin' dental floss?
THE BOYS
Yes.
MR. HANKEY
And washin' behind your ears?
THE BOYS
Yes.
CARTMAN
No.
[Mr. Hankey coughs.]
KYLE
What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?
MR. HANKEY
Oh, I just got a little cold is all. All these new people in South Park are stressful on my home.
STAN
What do you mean?
MR. HANKEY
Well, you see, boys, the sewer is a fragile ecosystem.
CARTMAN
[Incredulous.] Oh my God.
MR. HANKEY
These new folks in town eat nothin' but cous cous, tofu, and raw vegetables, and it's destroying my environment.
KYLE
And that's why you got a cold?
MR. HANKEY
That's why, Kyle. That's why.
STAN
Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?
MR. HANKEY
There's only one time of year I can come to the surface, and that's Christmastime. That's why I need you boys to go for me.
[He coughs some more.]
KYLE
Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys.
[The boys move off.]
MR. HANKEY
Don't forget to change your sheets once a week!
[Mr. Hankey rows away. Meanwhile, back at the festival... Playing at the Bijou: "A Bunch Of Gay Cowboys Eating Pudding." Score another one for Cartman. Inside, the festival host stands before the movie audience.]
HOST
So without further ado we will begin this amazing film. It's a work of blood, sweat, and tears.
KYLE
[Rushing in.] Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please?
DIRECTOR 4
Is that Leonardo DiCaprio?
[The audience buzzes and cameras flash everywhere, Kyle shields his eyes.]
KYLE
Aaahh!
DIRECTOR 4
Ohuh no, wait, that's not him.
[The audience groans.]
KYLE
Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food.
FEMALE DIRECTOR
Excuse me, little boy, what's a "Mr. Hankey"?
KYLE
He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide world, and I don't want him to die.
[No reaction from the audience.]
DIRECTOR 3
What a great story-it has everything!
FEMALE DIRECTOR
This could be the next Free Willy.
DIRECTOR 5
Great pic, son. How much do you want for it?
KYLE
Huh??
DIRECTOR 6
Does it-uh have to be a talking piece of poo?
[The boys just stare.]
DIRECTOR 7
It could be a crime-fighting rabbit. Or a lovable turtle.
DIRECTOR 4
This could be a great summer movie.
FEMALE DIRECTOR 2
[Rising in the back.] Can we put a mon-key in it?
DIRECTOR 8
"The Mr. Hankey Stor-" uh is Harrison Ford available for a fall pic?
DIRECTOR 9
Keanu Reeves.
DIRECTOR 10
Matt Damon!
FRED SAVAGE
Fred Savage!
[The other audience members laugh at the thought, and Fred is miffed.]
DIRECTOR 7
I'd pay a million for this story!
DIRECTOR 10
I'll pay two.
[The rest of the audience descends into conversation.]
KYLE
Dude, no one even listened to me.
STAN
Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie.
[One of the directors has pulled Cartman aside.]
DIRECTOR 3
Mmuh I take it you're part owner of this whole Mr. Hooey story, right?
CARTMAN
Huh? Uhuh, yeah, I guess.
DIRECTOR 3
I want you to do a big-money deal with me.
CARTMAN
All of us?
DIRECTOR 3
Mm-we-hell, I can see that you're the real brains of the group. You don't really need those guys, do you?
CARTMAN
Ye-ah, screw those guys. I don't even like them.
DIRECTOR 3
Hm-that's great, kid. Let's make a deal.
[They walk off. Meanwhile, in front of the library. Robert Redford and Phyllis have something to announce. Of course, the Mayor and her aides are there.]
ROBERT REDFORD
Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you all for making the First Annual South Park Film Festival a success. We've barely even started and already the festival has seen more attendance than last year's Sundance festival.
[The crowd cheers.]
SOMEONE IN THE CROWD
Fantastic!
ROBERT REDFORD
And I'm very pleased to announce that in honor of the South Park people who have welcomed us, we are going to build a Hollywood Planet restaurant, right here where this library used to stand.
[A wrecking ball appears and knocks the building down with one fell swoop.]
CROWD
[Gasping.] Ooohhh!
AIDE 2
Can they do that?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
They're Hollywood! They can do anything!
[Kyle is in the sewer all alone, looking to tell Mr. Hankey the bad news. An organ is heard.]
KYLE
Mr. Hankey!
[Kyle looks all around and walks.]
KYLE
Mr. Hankey?!
[Kyle is surprised to see an organ before him, and Mr. Hankey playing vigorously.]
KYLE
Mr. Hankey?
MR. HANKEY
[Turns around.] Oh, Kyle. Howdy-ho.
[Mr. Hankey starts coughing again.]
MR. HANKEY
Well, how did it go? Is everyone gonna stop poopin' in my environment?
KYLE
They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.
MR. HANKEY
[Droops.] Oh. I, I see. Welluh shucks, Kyle, I can't thank you enough for tryin'.
[He turns back and starts playing the organ again.]
KYLE
[Determined.] We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface.
MR. HANKEY
Aw I can't. The sun'll dry me out.
KYLE
It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.
MR. HANKEY
But I won't last long up above.
KYLE
Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!
MR. HANKEY
All right, just let me get my toothbrush.
[The Bijou. Wendy and Stan are heading for the ticket booth.]
WENDY
Come on, Stan, we're gonna be late for the screening!
[They look up to see "Tom Hanks in: Me & Mr. Hankey".]
STAN
Jeez, they made that into a movie already?
[Inside, they sit in the first row, middle two seats. On the screen, Tom Hanks is in a hospital with a fever, hand to forehead.]
TOM HANKS
Mr. Hankey, I can't go on anymore. I've lost the fight.
MR. HANKEY
[A talking monkey hanging from the curtain.] No, I'm not leaving without you.
[The monkey drops down and goes to Tom Hanks' bedside.]
MR. HANKEY
We started this together, we're gonna finish it together.
[The monkey holds his hand.]
TOM HANKS
I always thought death was something glorious, but now I know that it's not.
[Stan reaches out for Wendy's hand. Wendy cries, blows her nose into a napkin, and hands it to Stan, who just looks at it.]
DIRECTOR 3
[Sitting in the back with Cartman.] It's going over really well. People are gonna be knocking my door down to get you.
CARTMAN
Who the hell cast Tom Hanks in this?! Tom Hanks can't act his way out of a nutsack!
TOM HANKS
[Onscreen.] I'll always love you, Mr. Hankey.
CARTMAN
[Mocking.] I'll momaymumyeu, Meemuhmammy.
[Kenny waits outside for Stan and Wendy, so he's passing the time with a yo-yo. The doors open and the patrons flood out, crushing Kenny.]
MAN 1
Oh my God, I found a penny! [Picks it up.]
MAN 2
You bastard!
[The street. A manhole cover pops up and Kyle comes out with Mr. Hankey.]
KYLE
Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'?
MR. HANKEY
[Looking more frozen than dry.] It sure is -dry up here. [Coughs]
KYLE
Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on!
[Construction is under way at the Hollywood Planet, South Park's "Death Star".]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Excuse me, Mr. Film Commissioner, could I have a word with you?
ROBERT REDFORD
[Arms crossed.] Make it quick.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Well, the people of my town are a little upset. I don't think we realized what an impact this festival would have on our town.
ROBERT REDFORD
Uh-huh.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Right. So, we were actually wondering if we could call this whole thing off?
ROBERT REDFORD
We have contracts. [He pulls some out.] You try to pull out now, we'll sue your little town for every penny it's got. But thanks so much for the hard work.
CARTMAN
[With director 3.] Eh but, but this doesn't make sense to me, Marty! Okay, you told me the movie made a lot of money!
MARTY
Mmp right. Two million, minus your agent's fee, minus your lawyer's fee, minus my fee, and the publicity and taxes taken out, you get three dollars! That's more than most people in your position make, trust me!
STAN
[Happening upon the scene.] Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout!
CARTMAN
I'm not a sellout! What's a sellout?
STAN
If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!
CHEF
[Stopping by.] It's all gone to hell, children. And we're all to blame. Even me!
[His booth is shown.]
CHEF
I was sellin' out my town, too! And now look at it.
[The town looks just like Sundance at the beginning of the episode.]
STAN
So what do we do now?
CHEF
There's nothin' we can do. Just sit here and suck on my balls.
[Kyle arrives with Mr. Hankey in a shoebox.]
KYLE
You guys, we have to hurry!
STAN
Why?
KYLE
Come on! Everything's gonna be okay!
[They walk over to Robert Redford.]
KYLE
Sir! Sir!
ROBERT REDFORD
Not now!
KYLE
I have to show you something.
[Kyle presents the box containing Mr. Hankey to Robert Redford.]
KYLE
I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.
A DIRECTOR
What's this?
[Others have started to gather around.]
KYLE
I want you guys to all meet my friend.
[Kyle removes the lid to the box and rattles the box a bit. When nothing happens, he turns the box over and Mr. Hankey drops out, dry as a bone. The boys gasp.]
ROBERT REDFORD
That's great, kid. A dried-out lump of shit; very compelling. [To the crowd] Okay, folks, let's move! We've gotta have that sign down in time for the opening tonight!
KYLE
You can't die, Mr. Hankey. You can't.
[Mr. Hankey starts coughing and is barely audible, only his right eye opens.]
MR. HANKEY
Kyle. Be-fore I go there's something I must tell you. Come clo-ser.
[Kyle draws closer.]
MR. HANKEY
Clo-ser.
[Kyle moves in further.]
KYLE
Well-. Huwhat is it, Mr. Hankey?
MR. HANKEY
There is a-nother Sky-walk-er.
[Mr. Hankey dies.]
KYLE
Nooohohohohohoho-
MR. HANKEY
Wake up.
KYLE
What is it, Mr. Hankey?
MR. HANKEY
Come clo-ser.
[Kyle moves in closer.]
KYLE
What is it?
MR. HANKEY
Clo-ser.
[Kyle moves even further in.]
KYLE
Yes?
MR. HANKEY
Closer!
[Kyle is very close.]
MR. HANKEY
One time, when you were sleeping, I put myself in your mouth and had my friend take a picture.
[He dies.]
KYLE
Nooo!
[Flashbacks of Mr. Hankey flood Kyle's mind, including one of the monkey who played Mr. Hankey in the movie.]
VOICE OVER
[Singing slowly, mournfully.]
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
He loved me, I loved you.
Therefore vicariously he loved you-
KYLE
Nooo!
HAZMAT OFFICIAL
I'm sorry, son. Let's get him to ICU.
[The HazMat official scoops Mr. Hankey's corpse into a small white body bag.]
KYLE
[Weeping.] Noo! No!
STAN
[Concerned.] Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you.
WENDY
[Arriving.] Hi, Stan. Ready to go see another movie? [Damn.]
STAN
Okay!
[Stan releases Kyle, who falls to the ground.]
KYLE
Uuf.
[Over at the Bijou, now showing: "BOW DOWN TO HOLLYWOOD, SOUTH PARK" A Film by TOM M. POONER. But inside, it's "A Bunch Of Gay Cowboys Eating Pudding", in color. Stan reaches for Wendy's hand. She notices, then looks at him. He pulls his hand back and looks at the screen.]
COWBOY
Say, Tom. Do you have any pudding left?
TOM
I ate all mine up, silly.
COWBOY
Well then, now what do we do?
[Stan tries again, and again pulls back. This time, Wendy takes his left hand in her right one and smiles at him. He smiles back at her. A few blinks from her eyes and a gentle squeeze from her hand and he vomits - at a man sitting in front of her.]
MAN
AAWWWW!
WENDY
Eeewww!
MAN
[Facing Stan.] Hey!
STAN
Sorry.
COWBOY
Well, why don't we just explore our sexuality?
TOM
Ooh, good idea. Let's.
[They hug, and the cowboy drops to work on Tom's pants.]
STAN
Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this!
[Wendy is alarmed, Stan jumps up and.]
STAN
Blaach!
[He vomits on the man in front of him again.]
MAN
Aaww! [Turns around to face Stan.] Is there a problem, young man?
STAN
No problem, dude.
[Hell's Pass Hospital. Chef and Kyle are at the ICU. The window above Mr. Hankey's bed is sealed so no sunlight gets in. The whole room is sealed in. Mr. Hankey has several wires streaming into him.]
KYLE
I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan.
CHEF
Come on, Kyle. It's time to go.
KYLE
Chef, does poo go to heaven?
CHEF
[Chef ponders a moment.] Well, uh-I kinda hope not.
[Kyle starts weeping.]
CHEF
I mean, sure it does.
[Kyle quiets down.]
CHEF
Here. I'll give him one of my Salty Balls to take with him to poo heaven.
[Chef removes the face tubes and drops a ball into Mr. Hankey's mouth, then puts the tubes back.]
CHEF
Come on, let's go.
[They start to walk away.]
MR. HANKEY
[Weakly.] Kyle.
KYLE
[Rushes back.] Mr. Hankey?
MR. HANKEY
Howdy-ho.
KYLE
He's back! He's back! [Chef returns.]
MR. HANKEY
That was delicious.
CHEF
My Salty Chocolate Balls must have re-juvenated him!
KYLE
You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef.
CHEF
You're daaamn right.
[Hollywood Planet is finished and awaiting its unveiling. But first, over at Cartman's booth,]
CARTMAN
Step on up, get them here! Mr. Hankey & Me T-shirts! Get them while they last, folks. for only $14.95!
WOMAN
I'll take two.
MAN
I'd like to pay for one.
CARTMAN
Selling T-shirts kicks ass!
[Robert Redford is at the podium.]
ROBERT REDFORD
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm pleased to announce on this Gala Opening of Hollywood Planet South Park, that the festival will be back next year!
[Mr. Mackey, Mr. Garrison, and Jimbo are dismayed, along with the rest of the town.]
ROBERT REDFORD
And the year after that, and the year after that, and so on! And now, release the curtain!
[The curtain drops to reveal Hollywood Planet in all its glory. Kliegl lights move their beams around and palm tress line the restaurant front.]
ROBERT REDFORD
I give you, "Hollywood in South Park!"
[He laughs sinisterly. The crowd gasps at the size of the thing.]
KYLE
Wait!
[The crowd turns to see who it is.]
KYLE
I brought him! I brought him to show you!
[Cartman is with Stan and Kyle.]
ROBERT REDFORD
[Put off.] Oh, not this again!
KYLE
Behold! Mr. Hankey!
[Mr. Hankey jumps out of the box.]
MR. HANKEY
Hoooooowwwdy-ho!
[The crowd looks at him blankly, then turns back to face the commissioner. Hollywood folks are hard to impress.]
ROBERT REDFORD
Anyway, this new Hollywood Planet will be the official meeting place for all-
MR. HANKEY
Howdy-ho, folks. I'm afraid my buddy Kyle was right. There's not enough room in South Park to accommodate a festival.
SHORT MAN
Mr. Poo, if you wouldn't mind, we can't hear our chairman. If you could just turn yourself down. You're at about 7 right now, we need you at about, 3, okay?
[Mr. Hankey's hands drop and he hops over to the podium. Robert steps aside.]
MR. HANKEY
Uh, folks, please. Little towns like this simply aren't made for friggin' films. We love havin' visitors, but golly, too many of you is hurtin' our ecosystem. Be-sides, folks, film festivals shouldn't be about what celebrities are comin' or what film is gonna get sold. It should be about people gettin' together, and watchin' movies, and about people who could never get their movies seen havin' a chance to have it watched, if only once. A good film festival should be something where we all say, "Gaw, let's forget about lawyers and managers and studios and celebrities. Let's forget all those things for just a while, and just watch some new art."
[The crowd ponders the speech. Kyle smiles, and so does Mr. Hankey.]
ROBERT REDFORD
[Grabs Mr. Hankey and pulls back.] I have had enough of you! [He tosses him away.]
MR. HANKEY
[Flying through the air.] Nyyaarrrr!
KYLE
No!
[Mr. Hankey hits a wall and slides down.]
ROBERT REDFORD
Now, as I was saying, this shall usher in a whole new decade of film festivals.
[Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Chef gather 'round Mr. Hankey.]
KYLE
[Crying.] O-hoho he's dead. Mr. Hankey's dead.
CHEF
Well, it worked once before.
[Chef drops six balls into Mr. Hankey's mouth.]
MR. HANKEY
[Recovering.] Hi, Chef. Your big chocolate balls are just the trick!
[He rubs his belly and hops off. As he does, syncopated music plays, and he switches to a sorcerer's cap. He's pissed.]
STAN
What the hell is he doing?
KYLE
I don't know.
[Mr. Hankey hops up to Hollywood Planet and jumps onto the top of the globe. He is now fully dressed as a sorcerer's apprentice. He starts to do his magic, waving his hands as clouds gather and poo jumps out of manholes and grills throughout the town.]
CARTMAN
Whoa!
[Robert Redford is awed. Mr. Hankey continues wielding his power, and three poo men rise up out of the poo that now covers the street. They start to dance.]
AN AGENT
Oh my God!
[Mr. Hankey continues. Poo pours forth from the Porta Potties nearby and builds into a giant wave.]
CROWD MEMBERS
[Fleeing.] Aaaaahh!
[The poo squelches them and sweeps them away. People clear out of the Hollywood Planet area. Robert Redford and Phyllis get out as well. Mr. Hankey is brewing something up and releases it.]
MAN
Oh, my God, it's crap!
MAN 2
Ohh! Noo!
[The poo traps a car and pushes it into the air as the poo turns into a twister.]
MAN 3
Whoa, it smells, it smells!
[Robert Redford and Phyllis reach their car.]
PHYLLIS
[Now inside.] Come on, let's go! It's coming!
ROBERT REDFORD
[With key in the ignition.] I'm trying, damn it!
[Mr. Hankey directs the twister back and forth as it picks up stuff and people. He then has it engulf Hollywood Planet. The poo seeps into Robert Redford's car and fills it up.]
ROBERT REDFORD
Aww. Aww. Glup.
[The poo drowns them and pours out the car windows.]
MAN
Let's get out of this town!
[Whatever people are left get into their cars and drive out quickly. Mr. Hankey lets up and relaxes, and the clouds clear away. The town is covered in poo. So are the townspeople.]
MR. HANKEY
[Gazing at the scene.] Gosh. I guess I don't know my own strength.
[He takes his cap off and lifts it high in a flourish, smiling.]
KYLE
You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people!
TOWNSFOLK
Hooray!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Ooh, yeaah. Now all we have is a town covered in shit! This is much better!
MR. HANKEY
I couldn't have done it without you, Kyle.
[He jumps down to Kyle.]
MR. HANKEY
Kisses.
[He kisses Kyle, and Kyle hugs him. Chef hugs both Stan and Kyle.]
WENDY
[Stopping by.] Stan, I'm sorry I dragged you to all those independent films.
STAN
Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you.
WENDY
Sometimes I forget that even though a few independent films are great, most of them suck ass.
CARTMAN
Yes. And I've learned something, too.
[The others turn, Stan and Wendy hold hands.]
CARTMAN
Being a sellout is sweet. Because you make a lot of money. And when you have money, you don't have to hang out with any poor-ass losers- like you guys. Screw you guys, I'ma goin' home.
[End of Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls. The song of the same name plays.]
End of Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The parents only have their children's best interests at heart when they arrange for Stan, Kyle and Cartman to be exposed to Kenny's chickenpox virus.

script:Chickenpox

[Hell's Pass Hospital. Sharon and Dr. Doctor stand before Shelly's bed.]
DR. DOCTOR
It's a good thing we got her to the hospital in time.
SHARON
But what's wrong with her?
DR. DOCTOR
It's chickenpox. There seems to be a small epidemic going around. Your daughter never had the chickenpox as a little child, I take it?
SHARON
No, no, she's been perfectly healthy.
DR. DOCTOR
Well, that's the problem. You see, chickenpox is a pretty normal thing for young children, but as you get older it becomes a more and more ferocious disease.
[The door opens and Stan enters.]
SHARON
[Sweetly.] Shelly, look who's come to visit you; your little brother, Stan.
SHELLY
[In disgust.] Oh, whoo-peee!
DR. DOCTOR
You know, most people don't realize that chickenpox is actually a form of herpes.
STAN
Dude, you've got herpes on your face!
SHELLY
Shut up, brat!
SHARON
[With some urgency.] Will my daughter be okay?
DR. DOCTOR
She'll be fine.
SHELLY
[Stan scratches her cheek.] Stop it!
DR. DOCTOR
We just want to be cautious and monitor her here.
[A crash is heard, and Sharon and Dr. Doctor look on in surprise.]
STAN
Ow!
[Shelly has knocked Stan to the floor.]
SHARON
Come on, Stanley. Give your sister a kiss and then we have to go.
[The Broflovski house. Sharon, Sheila, and Liane are seated at the dining room table. Ike is playing in his high chair.]
SHARON
...and then the doctor said that it's much worse as you get older. My daughter is in pretty bad shape now, but if she were in her twenties, she could die.
SHEILA
My God, I never knew chickenpox was such a dangerous illness.
LIANE
I guess it's much better to get it when you're young.
SHARON
So tell me if I'm crazy, but I started thinking that we should intentionally have our boys play with a child who has the chickenpox. Let them get it now, while they're young.
SHEILA
That's not crazy at all, Sharon. Mothers do it all the time.
LIANE
Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chickenpox, just so I would get it.
SHARON
So it's not such a crazy idea after all?
SHEILA
Noo, no. And I'm pretty sure that strange little boy Kenny has the chickenpox right now.
[Kyle, Stan, and Cartman walk up to the table.]
KYLE
Are you guys having a meeting or something?
SHEILA
How would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend Kenny's house tonight?
CARTMAN
No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; they live in the ghetto.
KYLE
Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.
SHARON
Boys, you're going to sleep over at Kenny's, and that's final.
CARTMAN
Oh weak!
[The boys have gone home to gather their things. Now they meet up and walk to Kenny's house.]
KYLE
I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.
STAN
Yeah, it's pretty weird.
[The boys cross some railroad tracks.]
KYLE
Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo.
[They come upon a house with an orange cat and a small gray dog milling around. Strewn about the yard are a motor, a sofa, a refrigerator, a pack of beer bottles...]
KYLE
Well, here's Kenny's house.
CARTMAN
In the ghetto
On a cold and gray Chicago morn
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto... In the ghetto
[Stan knocks on the door and Stuart McCormick answers, beer in hand.]
STUART
Yeah?
STAN
We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.
STUART
What? Don't you know Kenny's sick with--?
CAROL
[Intruding.] That's the whole point, remember? Their moms want them to catch it while they're young.
STUART
Oh yeah.
STAN
Catch what?
CAROL
Nothin'. Uhco-uh, come on in, I was jus' makin' dinner.
[The boys follow the parents in. Shag carpeting, another sofa, an engine block doubling as a coffee table, a beer sign...]
CARTMAN
And his momma cried
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
Is another little hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto In the ghetto
[Stuart sits in his armchair.]
STAN
Sshh! Cartman!
CARTMAN
What?
CAROL
[Setting the table.] Kenny, your little friends are here! Come play with them!
KENNY
(No, Mom, I'm seriously sick!)
CAROL
I know you're sick! Now get your buns out here!
KYLE
Heheheh, buns.
KENNY
[Walks up to the other boys.] (Hey you guys, what's goin' on?)
STAN
Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!
CARTMAN
[Scanning the room.] Where is the Nintendo?
STUART
We don't have a Nintendo. We got a ColecoVision hooked up to the black-and-white TV.
[Rats scurry near the TV.]
KYLE
Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.
CAROL
[Now finished setting table.] Throw your sleeping bags in Kenny's room and then come grab some dinner.
CARTMAN
Oh, good. I'm starving.
[The boys are seated, as are Kenny's parents. Kenny's older brother comes to table. All there is to eat is a plate of 5 or 6 frozen waffles and a toaster to toast them in. The boys can only wonder.]
CAROL
Let's say grace.
[The boys put their hands together.]
STUART
Lord, we thank you for this staggering payload of frozen waffles you have bestowed upon us. And since we have been faithful to you, we know that you will send us some good fortune one of these days, even though you sure as hell seem to be taking your sweet time. Amen.
ALL
Amen.
CARTMAN
Pfff..!
CAROL
Okay, let's dig in.
[She drops a waffle into the toaster.]
KEVIN
That one's mine, that one's mine!
CARTMAN
[Coolly.] What kind of side dishes will we be enjoying this evening with our frozen waffles?
[Everyone stops and waits.]
CARTMAN
Am I to understand there will be no side dishes?
STUART
So, Kyle, your dad's still bringing home those big, fat lawyer paychecks?
KYLE
I don't know.
CAROL
Stuart, don't even get started!
[She points at him.]
STUART
[To his wife.] What? I'm just askin' a question. [To Kyle.] You know, your dad and I used to be best friends when we were teenagers. We would work together at Pizza Shack. But he got promoted and went off to community college and I didn't. And you know why? 'Cause your dad's Jewish!
CARTMAN
Puh! I heard that.
CAROL
That ain't why, Stuart! [Sadness creeps into her voice.] It's because you are an alcoholic retard and he had dreams of not eating frozen waffles for dinner every night!
STUART
Hey, is it my fault you don't know how to cook?!
CAROL
What am I supposed to do with frozen waffles, clamhead?! You put 'em in the toaster and you cook 'em!
STUART
You just don't know how to use spices and stuff.
KEVIN
[Gleefully.] My waffle's d-hun, my waffle's d-hu-hun!
CAROL
Now Kevin, we ain't got enough for everybody. You have to split that with your brother.
CARTMAN
Oh, Jesus, are you fucking kidding me?
STUART
Hey! We don't say "fuck" at the table, you little asshole!
CARTMAN
[Hushed.] Heh, we apparently don't say 'side dishes' at the table, either.
KENNY
(Aa-choo!)
CAROL
Kenny, honey, if you're going to sneeze, sneeze on them.
STAN
Huh?
KENNY
[Turning towards Cartman.] (Waa-choo!)
CARTMAN
[Recoiling.] Ey!
[Cartman closes both his eyes, but then opens the right one. Later, in Kenny's room. Kenny has two posters of bikini-clad women and one of a 4X4 monster truck. His curtains are tatters and his dresser drawer is a battered suitcase. His bed has no frame to rest on.]
CARTMAN
Man, your family sucks ass, Kenny. Whoever heard of frozen waffles for dinner?
KYLE
Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.
[The boys go to their respective sleeping bags while Kenny goes to his bed. The boys roll down their bags and Stan and Kyle have Terrance and Phillip sleeping bags, Cartman however...]
KYLE
Cartman, what the hell is that?
CARTMAN
It's my Urkel sleeping bag. Isn't it coool?
KYLE
No, it's not cool!
STAN
Dude, I think I just saw a rat!
CARTMAN
Argh! You have rats in your house, too, Kenny?!
KENNY
(Uh-huh.)
CARTMAN
Dude, seriously, you'd better stop being so poor, or else I'm gonna start huckin' rocks atcha.
STAN
I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.
KENNY
(Well, there's gonna be a bunch of rats until they put the freakin' ceiling in.)
STAN
Oh.
[The boys settle into their sleeping blankets, and Kenny claps twice, making the lights go out.]
KENNY
(Aa-choo!)
[The next day. The boys have gone back home. First up: Stan's house. Stan has a thermometer in his mouth and his skin is starting to break out.]
SHARON
Okay, lemme see.
[She withdraws the thermometer, and reads it.]
SHARON
Oh, goody! You've got a fever!
STAN
[Mad.] Goody? What do you mean, "goody"?!
SHARON
Yyup, it looks like you've got chickenpox alright.
STAN
Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night.
SHARON
Oh, gee, I guess you did.
STAN
Well, you sure seem happy about it!
SHARON
All right, it's off to bed with you, young man.
[Cartman's house. Cartman is on the sofa scratching at his skin.]
LIANE
Don't scratch it, hon.
CARTMAN
[Whining.] But mom, seriously, it itches. I can't stand it!
LIANE
No, hon.
CARTMAN
[Whining.] Mom, seriously, it itches. It itches!
LIANE
Here, I got you some calamine lotion.
[She hands the bottle to him.]
CARTMAN
I don't wanna.
LIANE
It'll make your itches go away.
[She opens the bottle and rubs some lotion on his face.]
CARTMAN
Ugh. Uunnh.
[She stops.]
CARTMAN
Ey, give me that!
[He takes the bottle and rubs some more lotion on his face.]
CARTMAN
Ahhhh...
LIANE
Not too much, hon. It says on the bottle that too much can be bad.
CARTMAN
More calamine lotion!
[Kyle's house. His parents look him over.]
SHEILA
I don't understand it. He's perfectly healthy.
KYLE
Yeah. I feel great!
SHEILA
Are you sure you stayed over at Kenny's house?
KYLE
Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast.
SHEILA
Did you sleep in the same room?
KYLE
Yes. Why?
SHEILA
Bubbe, how would you like to spend the night at your friend Kenny's house again?
KYLE
No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!
SHEILA
Well I think you need to spend more time with your friends.
KYLE
Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him.
SHEILA
I'm gonna give Mrs. McCormick a call.
KYLE
Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?
GERALD
Who? Stuart? Yeah, yeah, I guess we were.
KYLE
Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?
GERALD
Well, because Kenny's family doesn't have as much money as we do.
KYLE
But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?
GERALD
Ha ha ha ha ha! Ooh-ho boy, have you got a lot to learn! Sit down, son.
[Gerald sits and motions for Kyle to sit on his lap.]
GERALD
You see, Kyle, we humans work as a society, and in order for a society to thrive, we need gods, and clods.
KYLE
Gods and clods?
GERALD
Yes. You see, I spent a lot of time going to law school, and I was able to go because I have a slightly higher intellect than others. But I still need people to pump my gas, and make my French fries, and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down.
KYLE
Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods!
GERALD
That's right. So Kenny's family is happy just the way they are, and we're all a functioning part of America.
[Stan's house, night time. Stan is in bed, motionless.]
SHARON
[Enters.] Stanley, can I get you anything else?
[She draws closer and feels his forehead.]
SHARON
Stanley? Oh my God! Randy?! Randy, hurry, he's burning up!
[Next day, Hell's Pass Hospital. Stan now lies next to Shelly. Their parents are also present.]
SHARON
Don't you worry, Stanley, you're going to be okay.
DR. DOCTOR
[Entering.] Can I talk to you outside?
SHARON
Kids, Daddy and I are gonna be right back, okay?
STAN
Okay.
SHELLY
[Now that they're alone.] Serves you right, you little brat!
STAN
Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
SHELLY
If I die from this, I'm taking you with me!
TV VOICE
["Passion Cramps"] Will Carol find out she's a fa...
STAN
I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!
SHELLY
[Threatening] We're watching this!
STAN
Well I've got the remote, bitch! Hahaha. [Click.]
PHILLIP
Say, Terrance? Will you check my ass for abnormalities?
[Phillip raises his leg high.]
TERRANCE
Sure thing, Phillip.
[Terrance sticks his head in there, and Phillip farts on him.]
TERRANCE
Ah ha ha ha, you got me again!
[Stan laughs.]
PHILLIP
That's tomfoolery.
[Stan laughs, as do Terrance and Phillip.]
SHELLY
Give me the remote!
STAN
No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day--
[She reaches over to his bed, presses a switch, and his bed folds in on him.]
STAN
Ey! Get me out of here!
[Shelly takes the remote and switches channels.]
TV VOICE
["Passion Cramps"] She was...
[Meanwhile, outside the room.]
DR. DOCTOR
He'll be okay, but it's a good idea for us to monitor him for a while.
SHARON
[Anxious.] Oh God, what have we done?
DR. DOCTOR
There there now, it's not your fault.
RANDY
Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early.
DR. DOCTOR
Oh, wow, you did? Wow. You guys suck.
[Kenny's house. Kyle and his mom are visiting. She's talking with Mrs. McCormick in the dining room. Kenny and Kyle enter.]
KYLE
Could we go home now, Ma?
SHEILA
No, bubbeleh. You play with Kenny some more.
KYLE
But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.
SHEILA
I've got a great game for you. It's called "ookie mouth".
KYLE
What's "ookie mouth"?
SHEILA
First, you let Kenny spit in your mouth. Then you try to swallow his spit and say "ookie mouth" at the same time.
KYLE
Sick, dude!
SHEILA
No, no, bubbe, it's loads of fun. Try it.
[Kenny and Kyle look at each other and walk away.]
SHEILA
That ought to take care of it.
CAROL
You want some more hot water?
SHEILA
Oh, no thank you. It's terrific though, it's-- You don't have any tea bags or coffee grounds to go in the hot water, do you?
CAROL
Naw, we don't go for that hoity-toity rich folk stuff.
SHEILA
I see. Well, you certainly have aab- humble home, Mrs. McCormick.
CAROL
Yehah, well, unfortunately my husband is a washed-up hunk of shit!
SHEILA
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
KYLE
Ookie mouth! [Kenny spits in.] Gross! I can't do it, Ma!
SHEILA
Try again, bubbe!
[Kenny spits in Kyle's mouth again.]
KYLE
Argh!
SHEILA
You know, your husband and mine used to work together as teenagers.
CAROL
Oh they wuz best friends; you couldn't separate 'em.
SHEILA
Really? I met Gerald in college, so I didn't know. What happened to them?
CAROL
Oh they jus' grew apart, I guess. I think Stuart's a little jealous that your husband got out of makin' pizzas and went on to make somethin' of hisself.
SHEILA
Well that's too bad. I'm sure your husband's a fine man.
CAROL
Oh, hell no! He's a nugget o' deer turd.
SHEILA
But if they were such good friends it seems silly that they don't even talk anymore. Let's get them together!
CAROL
Uh-I don't know.
SHEILA
We'll just arrange a little fishing trip for them or something.
[Kyle returns with Kenny.]
KYLE
I can't say "ookie mouth" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible.
[Kyle's face and hat are covered in spit.]
SHEILA
Practice makes perfect, bubbe.
[Cartman's house. Cartman's on the sofa watching TV, scratching his face.]
CARTMAN
Dammit, where's that calamine lotion?!
TERRANCE
[With clipboard.] Phillip, I've got good news, and bad news.
PHILLIP
Give it to me straight, Terrance.
TERRANCE
The good news is, you have a clean bill of health.
PHILLIP
Oh, what a relief!
TERRANCE
The bad news is, you have cancer.
[Cartman is shocked.]
PHILLIP
Cancer?
TERRANCE
Yes. I'm afraid your ass is collapsing.
PHILLIP
My ass is collapsing?
TERRANCE
Yes. See this X-ray? [Turns it on.] That's your ass. See this line? [Points to it.] That's your ass collapsing. Your ass is collapsing.
PHILLIP
Will this mean that I won't be able to fart anymore?
TERRANCE
No, it means that you won't be able to live anymore.
[They both laugh.]
CARTMAN
[Somber.] Oh, no. [The itching returns.] Damnit!
[Mr. Kitty strolls by.]
CARTMAN
No, Kitty! That's a-- Wait a minute. Come 'ere, Kitty!
[Kitty jumps up and Cartman uses him as a scrubber.]
CARTMAN
Uh. Yes. Uh...
LIANE
[Closing a door.] I'm back, hon. I got some more calamine lotion.
CARTMAN
[Releases Mr. Kitty.] It's about friggin' time! Give me that!
[He grabs the bag and hurries up the stairs.]
LIANE
Just use a little bit of that stuff, hon. It has to last a while.
[Cartman reaches the bathroom and closes the door. Then he opens the bag and pulls out six bottles of the lotion and pours them into the tub. Then he undresses and jumps into the tub.]
CARTMAN
Uugh! Yeessss. [His voice trails off.] Ooohhh yyou guys, seriiously, it calms yer ass. Ahhhh...
[He sinks into the water blissfully as bubbles pop around him. Meanwhile, Gerald and Stuart are driving to the river for a fishing trip.]
STUART
I didn't know you like to fish, Gerry.
GERALD
Oh, yeah, love it! I haven't done it for a while, though. I had to go out and buy a few things, you know a-. A rod and a reel and an uh, uuh...
STUART
Tackle box?
GERALD
Yeah, tackle box. [Stretches.] Man, smell that mountain air. What a great Saturday morning; aren't weekends just the best?
STUART
When you're uh-unemployed, weekends are meaningless.
GERALD
Right. Right-right.
[Monday afternoon, South Park Elementary. The dismissal bell rings.]
MR. GARRISON
And so, children, that's how you tell a prostitute from a policeman. Now, are there any questions?
[Kyle raises his hand.]
MR. GARRISON
Yes, Kyle?
KYLE
What the hell does that have to do with American history?
MR. GARRISON
Uh, that's a good question, Kyle. Are there any other questions?
KYLE
Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes.
MR. GARRISON
Right, right. Uhh... Well, class, I'm going to assign you all a paper. The theme of the paper will be, "How I would make America better."
KYLE
What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?
MR. GARRISON
Uh, don't worry, Kyle. I'm sending homework to all the children who are out sick. They'll have to turn in a paper, too.
[Hell's Pass Hospital.]
STAN
Homework?! But I'm in the hospital!
SHARON
Well, your teacher sent this stuff over for you to do while you're sick.
STAN
That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?
SHARON
Now, Stanley, I know at your age teachers can seem cold and heartless, but later, you'll understand that he did this for your own good.
STAN
Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo.
RANDY
Yeah, it's-it's true, he is.
SHARON
Oh. Well, anyway, here's a pencil and some paper.
STAN
Wait! Where are you going?
RANDY
We're going down to-uhh Happy Burger for some milkshakes.
STAN
Milkshakes?!
SHARON
Yeah, and then we're going to the movies.
RANDY
See ya, son. [They leave.]
STAN
Weak!
[Kyle's house. Kyle is on the sofa working on his paper.]
KYLE
"So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea."
[Kyle puts down the pen and paper and walks over to the kitchen.]
SHEILA
No I don't understand it, Dr. Schwartz, he's perfectly healthy.
[Sheila is on the phone, Kyle is over by the microwave.]
SHEILA
He's been over at Kenny's house three days in a row and still hasn't caught the chickenpox.
KYLE
[Softly.] What?
SHEILA
I don't know what else to do. We sent the other boys over and they all got sick, but I can't get my little Kyle to catch it.
KYLE
[Frightened.] Oh my God!
SHEILA
[Turns.] Kyle, what are you doing there, honey?
KYLE
[Angry.] You!
SHEILA
[Subdued.] I'll call you back, Dr. Schwartz.
[She hangs up.]
KYLE
You!
SHEILA
[Walks over.] What, bubbeleh, what is it?
KYLE
You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!
SHEILA
Oy. It was for your own good, Kyle. I wanted you to get chickenpox while you were young.
KYLE
Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!
SHEILA
Now, Kyle, come here.
KYLE
You get away from me, you crazy woman!
[He runs off.]
SHEILA
Hoh boy.
[Down by the riverside. Stuart and Gerald are fishing.]
STUART
Beer?
GERALD
Huh? Oh, uh, no thanks, I brought my own. Microbrew sampler from Aspen. Has six different beers from local breweries.
[Stuart is expressionless.]
GERALD
Sahay, remember that time we built the fort in your mom's back yard?
STUART
Hu hu hu hu heh yeah. It took us damn near two years to finish it.
GERALD
Hahah. Whatever happened to that old hunk o' junk? Haha--
STUART
[Soberly.] That's where I live now.
GERALD
Oh, right.
[Hell's Pass Hospital. Stan is working on his paper.]
STAN
And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.
KYLE
[Rushing in.] Stan! Stan!
STAN
[Pointing to Shelly.] Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.
KYLE
[Softly.] Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox?
STAN
Yeah.
KYLE
Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick!
STAN
What are you talking about?
KYLE
They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway.
STAN
They did?
KYLE
Yeah. And I think I figured out why.
STAN
Why?
KYLE
Because they're a bunch of assholes.
STAN
[Long gasp.] Of course!
KYLE
Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good!
[They rush out of the room, meanwhile, back at Cartman's house. Cartman is back in the tub, now working on his paper. Calamine lotion bottles line the tub and litter the floor outside.]
CARTMAN
"I hope that one day America could be more like Endor, where the Ewoks live. Endor is very cool."
[The doorbell rings.]
CARTMAN
Mom, answer that! "They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America. It's cool."
[Kyle and Stan rush into the bathroom.]
KYLE
Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?
CARTMAN
I remember frozen waffles with no side dishes.
STAN
Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!
KYLE
Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face.
CARTMAN
She what?!
STAN
It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.
CARTMAN
That bitch! I'm gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts!
KYLE
No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back.
[Down by the riverside...]
GERALD
Well, I'm sure you'll find another job soon. Something'll come along.
STUART
Not that easy. You were lucky.
GERALD
Now, now-I, I wasn't lucky.
STUART
You had rich parents. You got to go to that expensive community college.
GERALD
Hey! I worked my ass off to get to where I am today! [Rising.] I wanted to be somebody!
STUART
[Rising.] I wanted to be somebody, too! I just wasn't born with a silver enema up my ass!
GERALD
You're just jealous. You're a bitter old drunk, just like your father!
[Stuart punches him down.]
GERALD
Ow!! [Gets up.]
STUART
Now don't make me do that again!
[Stuard hits him again.]
GERALD
Ow! You son of a bitch!
[Gerald chokes Stuart. They start tugging at each other.]
STUART
Uh!
GERALD
Ow!
STUART
Oh!
GERALD
Ow!
[Gerald ends up on the ground again.]
STUART
Eeaagghh!
[Stuart jumps and does an elbow drop on Gerald.]
GERALD
[In pain.] Huuuh!
[Hell's Pass Hospital. Stan's parents are visiting.]
RANDY
Doctor?
DR. DOCTOR
Yes?
RANDY
Wh-where's Stan?
DR. DOCTOR
Stan?
RANDY
Stan, our son?
DR. DOCTOR
Oh, yes. Where is Stan?
SHARON
You mean Stanley's missing?
DR. DOCTOR
No, no. He's not missing. We just... can't seem to find him at this moment.
SHARON
[To Randy.] Oh my God! Our son ran away!
RANDY
Will he be okay out of the hospital?
DR. DOCTOR
Oh sure, sure. But we have to get him back soon. If he doesn't get his antibiotic shot today, he could die.
SHARON
Die?
DR. DOCTOR
Yes, die. It won't be any easy death, either. The chickenpox will slowly move down his trachea into his lungs.
RANDY
Okay, well well, let's go look--
DR. DOCTOR
As he chokes for breath, the pox will move through his inner ear into his brain, making him think he's David Duchovny.
SHARON
Oh God, no!
RANDY
I'm-I'm sure he couldn't have gone far.
DR. DOCTOR
Now moving on all fours and wheezing uncontrollably, his cellular structure will regress into a gelatinous mass of--
[Kyle's house. Sheila looks after Ike, who plays with a toy truck. Gerald enters. His entire outfit is torn, he has a black eye and his fishing line is all mangled.]
SHEILA
So how was it? Did you boys have a good time fishing?
GERALD
That son of a bitch ripped my parka!
SHEILA
Catch anything?
GERALD
I just don't get it.
[He drops the pole.]
GERALD
Why would he invite me fishing and then turn into a complete bastard?
SHEILA
Well, darling, I have to tell you something. He didn't invite you. I set the whole thing up.
GERALD
What? Now why the hell would you knowingly deceive me like that?
SHEILA
I thought it would be good for you.
GERALD
Just like you deceived our son into going to Kenny's; and that didn't work either!
SHEILA
[Exasperated, she leaves.] I'm doing the best I can!
[Gerald picks up Kyle's paper on the sofa and looks over it.]
["My Final Solution by Kyle Broflovski."
"My dad is the smartest guy in the whole wide world. He has taught me that all poor people are actually things called clods. I wanna live in a world of only gods, so my idea to make America better is put all the poor people into camps."]
GERALD
What?!
["If we get rid of them, there will be nothing but rich people. And there won't be any hunger, poverty, or homeless people. 'Cause they'll all be dead. The end."]
GERALD
Oh, God, what have I done?
[Chef's house. He's watching Terrance and Phillip. Terrance and Phillip are both on operating tables with only their heads and asses exposed.]
PHILLIP
What's happening here, Terrance?
TERRANCE
We're doing an anal transplant. It's our only hope.
PHILLIP
Who's the donor?
TERRANCE
I am, Phillip. I am.
PHILLIP
Terrance, you're giving up your ass for me?
TERRANCE
Just half my ass. Can you believe it, Phillip? Best friends, and now we're going to share the same ass.
[Someone is knocking on Chef's door.]
CHEF
Oh, damn it, not now!
[Chef goes to answer the door. Stan, Kyle and Cartman wait.]
CHEF
Damn it! Children, what are you doing here? Terrance and Phillip are about to go into surgery!
KYLE
Chef, we wanna know about herpes.
CHEF
What makes you think I would know anything about that?
KYLE
Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.
STAN
How does someone get herpes?
CHEF
Well you get it by sharin' relations with somebody who already has it. You have to be very careful around someone who has herpes.
KYLE
Do you know anybody with herpes?
CHEF
Well, there's old Frida down on Main Street. She has a mouthful of herpes. You need to stay away from her.
STAN
But what if we want to give somebody herpes?
CHEF
Oh, then, Frida's the right person to go to.
KYLE
Cool! Thanks, Chef!
CHEF
O-kay!
[He closes the door and goes back to his armchair. The boys leave.]
CHEF
Wait a minute. What the hell did I just do?
[Main Street. Randy and Sharon drive around looking for Stan.]
SHARON
Stanley?
RANDY
Stan?
SHARON
[Softly.] Oh, Stanley, where are you..?
RANDY
Stan?
SHARON
Stanley!
[The car makes a right two blocks down, and the kids appear a block closer. They walk up the block and see an old redhead smoking a cigarette.]
KYLE
Are you old Frida?
FRIDA
[Raspily.] Who wants to know?
KYLE
Someone who wants a favor.
FRIDA
Ten dollars a lay, five dollars a b-- [Snorts.]
KYLE
[To Stan, throws his hands up.] Huh?
CARTMAN
We want you to give our parents herpes.
FRIDA
[Puffs out.] Five dollars.
STAN
My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. [Coughs.]
KYLE
Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital.
STAN
And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do.
[The Monkee's "I'm a Believer" plays. The boys hire Frida, and take her to each of their houses. First stop, Stan's house. She goes into the bathroom and uses Randy's and Sharon's toothbrushes. Stan and Kyle smile, then Stan gives a thumbs up in approval. In the kitchen, Frida chugs away at a jar of milk, then sends the milk right back into the jar. Next stop, Kyle's house. She goes into the master bedroom and uses Sheila's lipsticks. Then she goes to the kitchen and soils the silverware by putting each and every utensil under her armpits. Stan and Kyle jump for joy and high-five each other. Last stop, Cartman's house. She goes into Liane's room and pulls out some panties, then rubs them all over her face. Cartman jumps for joy. They all return to Stan's house, and she licks away at some wine glasses and the phone receiver. Stan and Kyle high-five each other again. Finally, they pay her and she leaves.]
STAN
Thanks a lot, Frida!
FRIDA
[Hacks.] Don't mention it.
[She hacks again, pockets the money, and walks away.]
KYLE
D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!
BOYS
Hooray!
[Stan coughs and the adults burst into the room. Fear strikes the boys.]
RANDY
Stanley, where the hell have you been?
SHARON
Damn it, Stanley, you had us worried sick! You have to get back to the hospital for a shot!
STAN
[Hiding behind Kyle.] I don't wanna go back there.
RANDY
[Coming for him.] Come on, we're taking you back to the hospital.
[Randy drags him off.]
STAN
Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?
RANDY
What?
STAN
You know, freshen up your breath.
KYLE
Aw, man. [Tottering, eyes half shut.] I don't feel so good.
SHEILA
[Pleased.] Oh good, maybe you finally caught the chicken--
KYLE
Ugh...
[Kyle falls back, passing out.]
SHEILA
Kyle!!
[Hell's Pass Hospital. All four boys are now in recovery.]
DR. DOCTOR
Well, I hope you boys learned your lesson. Going out and playing around with chickenpox almost killed you all.
KYLE
We're sorry.
DR. DOCTOR
Well just be thankful we got you here in time. Your parents are here to see you, I'll send them in.
KYLE
This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman.
CARTMAN
Hell no, you guys get your own!
[The parents enter, they all have herpes sores on their faces, well except Liane for some reason...]
SHARON
Stanley, how are you feeling today, son?
STAN
Pretty good.
SHARON
[Cheerfully.] The doctor says that maybe you can go home tomorrow.
RANDY
Yeah. Isn't that great, Stanley?
STAN
Wow, coo-hul!
SHEILA
And how are you, Kyle?
GERALD
Are you doing okay?
KYLE
I'm better now.
[He and Stan start laughing.]
SHARON
What's so funny, you two?
KYLE
We gave you guys herpes.
SHEILA
What-what-whaaat?! You did this?!
STAN
We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.
RANDY
I can't believe you gave us herpes. You little rascals!
SHARON
[To Randy.] Well, I guess it serves us right. [To the boys.] Kids, we should have honest about wanting you to get chickenpox.
SHEILA
It's true. We were wrong for deceiving you about it.
[Liane walks over to Cartman.]
CARTMAN
Hey, how come you don't have sores on your lips, Ma?
LIANE
Ooh, I have them somewhere else, poopiekins.
CARTMAN
Hooray!
GERALD
And, uh Stuart, I think I owe you an apology. I realize that I shouldn't be so cold towards people that are less fortunate than me.
STUART
Aww hell, I'm sorry, too.
[Terrance and Phillip is on. The anal transplant surgery was a success.]
TERRANCE
Oh, Phillip, I'm so glad everything turned out for the better.
[He farts high and laughs.]
CARTMAN
Well, I know one thing for sure.
LIANE
What's that, Eric?
CARTMAN
We're all gonna need a lot more calamine lotion.
[All the boys start laughing, then the parents join in. The doctor stands by Kenny and doesn't laugh. Kenny laughs, but drops dead. The meter flatlines and a long, steady note is heard. All stop laughing.]
STAN
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
KYLE
You bastards!
[Stan laughs, then Kyle, then everyone else, including Kenny's parents. End of Chickenpox. "I'm A Believer" plays.]
End of Chickenpox


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Is the new planetarium a boring place to learn about the solar system, or the scene of a diabolical plot to control the minds of South Park's citizens?

script:Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods

[A television is on, near the end of an episode of Barnaby Jones.]
POLICE COMMISSIONER
Well, detective. It looks like ya fooled them again.
BARNABY JONES
[Now quite old.] All in a day's work, I guess. I just hope that next time, I won't have to run so much.
[The end credits roll and the TV is turned off. The camera backs up to reveal that the TV is in Mr. Garrison's class.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, what do you think Barnaby Jones meant when he said, "This is not a victimless crime"? Anybody? [The kids just stare at him.] Children, were you paying attention?!
KYLE
Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention.
MR. GARRISON
Oh, well excuse me, Kyle! Why don't you just forget what Barnaby Jones has to say?! Why don't you not pay attention to Barnaby Jones and then let's see how far you get in society?! Okay, Stanley, why don't you tell us how Barnaby Jones knew the poison was in the milk?
STAN
Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?
MR. GARRISON
Oh, and what do you consider normal?!
STAN
I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff.
THE CLASS
Yeah!
MR. GARRISON
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants, it just so happens we are going on a field trip tomorrow!
THE CLASS
Hooray!
KYLE
To where?
MR. GARRISON
To the planetarium.
THE CLASS
AAWWWW!
CARTMAN
Planetariums suck!
MR. GARRISON
Oh now, what's wrong with the planetarium?
STAN
It's boring.
KYLE
Yeah, all the constellations look alike.
MR. GARRISON
Well, too bad! You're all going to the planetarium tomorrow and you're all going to love it! In the meantime, we're going to watch episode #203, Barnaby Under Siege.
THE CLASS
[Softly.] Aawwww.
MR. GARRISON
Oh, sorry, I taped these at home, so there's more commercials.
[A Cheesy Poofs commercial begins to play. A blonde wearing a Cheesy Poofs shirt is shown hiding something off camera.]
ANNOUNCER
Hey kids, do you love Cheesy Poofs?
[She pulls out the box.]
THE CLASS
Yes.
ANNOUNCER
Well, Cheesy Poofs is looking for a kid to sing the happy Cheesy Poofs song. Watch for our talent van as it goes around the country.
CARTMAN
I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song!
ANNOUNCER
If you win, you could be picked to be in our next Cheesy Poofs commercial. So remember,
I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame.
[Cartman is singing along by the end of the first line.]
[The next day. Mr. Garrison and the class are headed away from South Park on Ms. Crabtree's bus. The kids are making a lot of noise and running around. Mr. Garrison stands at the front of the bus.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, let's quiet down so the nice bus driver can concentrate on the road.
MS. CRABTREE
THAT AIN'T HOW YOU DO IT! YOU DO IT LIKE THIS: SIDDOWN AND SHUT UP!!
[Mr. Garrison jumps back and the kids hurry to their seats.]
MR. GARRISON
[Rubbing the back of his head.] Ow! Jesus, lady!
[Tantalus V. Observatory. Ms. Crabtree hits the brakes so hard the bus bucks and sends kids flying out of their seats.]
MS. CRABTREE
THIS IS THE PLANETARIUM, WATCH YOUR STEP ON THE WAY DOWN SO AS NOT TO HURT YOURSEELF!
KID
[Voice quivering.] Ow.
[The kids have all exited the bus.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, now I'm going to remind you that this is a planetarium, not a Bangkok brothel. Let's behave ourselves.
ANNOUNCER
[Over a loudspeaker nearby.] Does your child have what it takes to be the next Cheesy Poofs anthem singer?
[The Cheesy Poofs talent van is in the observatory parking lot. It is a shaped like a rocket on wheels. A sound system with towering speakers is set up next to it.]
CARTMAN
Hey, there it is!
ANNOUNCER
We're going around the country to find the kid who can sing the Cheesy Poofs song better than anybody.
CARTMAN
I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song with both hands tied behind my back!
KYLE
You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!
MR. GARRISON
Come on, Eric. We're going to the planetarium.
CARTMAN
But I'll have to sing the Cheesy Poofs song for that talent va-a-an!
MR. GARRISON
No, you have to go in this building and see a bunch of stupid stars! Now, come on!
[The rest of the class moves away.]
CARTMAN
[Whining.] But I wanna sing the Cheesy Poofs song on the commercial!
[The class enters the observatory, and some of the students are awed by it all.]
A BOY
Wow, don't you...?
A GIRL
What is that?
DR. ADAMS
Hello, children. My name is Dr. Adams. Welcome to the plane'arium.
KYLE
I thought it was planetarium.
DR. ADAMS
Well, it is. But I have a bone disease which impedes my ability to pronounce the "t" in "plane'arium".
MR. GARRISON
That's a pretty weird bone disease.
DR. ADAMS
Yes. Perhaps someday I can get a bone-marrow transplant.
[Cartman has his hand up.]
DR. ADAMS
Yes, little boy?
CARTMAN
How long is that Cheesy Poofs van gonna be outside?
DR. ADAMS
Well I don't know. But anyway, boys and girls, soon you'll be witnessing the wonders of the universe. But first, I wanna show you how the plane'arium works.
CARTMAN
As if we care.
[Kyle notices a young brunette with a clipboard walking in.]
KYLE
Hey, who are you?
DR. ADAMS
Ughuh, little Missy here runs the big projector for us.
MISSY
I love my work.
STAN
Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?
MISSY
I love my work.
[Her eyes are glazed over. Stan and Kyle notice this and look at each other.]
DR. ADAMS
Come on. Let's get into the plane'arium, shall we?
[In the planetarium proper. The class sits in a small theater and Dr. Adams is in a small room behind the class. Another kid works some controls on a machine on the theater floor.]
DR. ADAMS
Good morning, children, and welcome to the plane'arium. We're going on a fascinating ride through the universe, so I want you to lean back in your chairs and get comfortable.
[All the seats lean back on their own, so they have no choice.]
STAN
This is stupid.
DR. ADAMS
And now I'm going to dim the lights and let the stars... eh-come out.
[The dome darkens and some faint stars appear.]
KYLE
[Not amused.] Whoopie.
DR. ADAMS
Here we see the constellation called, "The Big Dipper". If I project a drawing of a big dipper on top of it...[Very softly.] a-hah [The drawing appears, connecting the stars.] ...we see where this constellation gets its name. These stars over here form the constellation of Taurus, the Bull...
[The drawing of a bull appears.]
DR. ADAMS
...while these stars form the constellation, "Roger Ebert".
[An outline of Roger Ebert's face appears with a thumbs down.]
DR. ADAMS
And these two little stars over here form the constellation The Crusades.
[From the two stars comes an elaborate drawing of crusaders storming the city of Jerusalem. Stan looks over at the kid on the floor and notices the same glazed-eye look Missy has.]
DR. ADAMS
Now, stars are actually made of hot gas, which is exactly what comes out of...
CARTMAN
Aw man, screw this.
[Cartman gets up and leaves the room. Dr. Adams turns an "Intensity" dial to 9.]
DR. ADAMS
And now breathe deep as the stars sloowwly start to move in little circles.
[The kids are getting mesmerized by them.]
DR. ADAMS
I know you think plane'ariums are boring, but I'm gonna try to change the way you think about that.
[Meanwhile, outside, tryouts are underway. Cartman stands behind a boy currently singing for the talent van.]
BOY
...you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame.
ANNOUNCER
That was great, Tommy. Tommy Fritz from Torrey Pines! He could be our winner.
CARTMAN
Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass!
ANNOUNCER
Oh, and what's your name, little boy?
CARTMAN
Eric Cartman.
ANNOUNCER
Alright, here's Eric Cartman giving it a shot.
[The cameraman starts filming, Cartman shoves Tommy aside, who falls down.]
TOMMY
Aaah!
CARTMAN
[Clears his throat and affects a tenor]
I love Cheesy Poofs
you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs
we'd be lame.
I'm talkin' Night-Court-in-it's-fifth-season lame-aaaahh!
ANNOUNCER
[Slapping his palm to his head] Wow!
CARTMAN
Thaat's right, suck on that.
[The planetarium doors open and the class exits.]
MR. GARRISON
Well, kids, how did you like the planetarium?
KYLE
Oh, man, I don't feel so good.
STAN
Me neither, but... I loved the planetarium.
KYLE
Me too. It was sweet.
MR. GARRISON
Really? What did you like best about it?
STAN
I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.
MR. GARRISON
[Tallying.] Wait a minute. Where is Eric?
CARTMAN
[Happily popping by.] I did it! I did it!
KYLE
Did what?
CARTMAN
I got a call-back for the Cheesy Poofs song!
MR. GARRISON
You snuck off and sang that stupid song?!
CARTMAN
Yeah, dude, but I got in the finals for tomorrow!
DR. ADAMS
[Now at the door.] Goodbye, children. Thanks for visiting. Don't forget: we have Laser Rock shows at night here at the plane-'arium. This week it's Laser Kenny Loggins and Laser James Taylor.
[The class is on the bus going back to school.]
KYLE
My head still feels funny.
STAN
Yeah, mine too.
CARTMAN
Hey you guys, when I'm done with that- Cheesy Poofs commercial, I bet I get all the free Cheesy Poofs I want.
KYLE
Like you really need it, hippo-ass!
CARTMAN
[With some pity.] It's sad how jealous you are, Kyle. It really is.
[A boy pops out from the seat behind Cartman in front of Stan and Kyle.]
BOY
Waaaah!
STAN, KYLE
AAAAAH!
KYLE
Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?!
BOY
[Haltingly.] My... name... is... vvan... G-gelder.
STAN
Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!
MR. GARRISON
Oh, great! Well I guess we have to go back!
VAN GELDER
[In a state of panic.] Nnno! Nn-don't go back! Nnno!
CARTMAN
Hey, be careful, asshole!
VAN GELDER
Eegh! Don't take me back there!
[He drops down, then comes back up.]
VAN GELDER
I can't... can't...
STAN
Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez!
VAN GELDER
Aaaagghh.
[Van Gelder passes out and falls to the floor.]
MR. GARRISON
[Quickly at his side.] We've better get him to the nurse's office, stat!
[The nurse's office. Van Gelder has been strapped down. Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, and Nurse Gollum are present.]
VAN GELDER
[Very agitated.] Aagh! The planetarium! Haah!
NURSE GOLLUM
I'll give him a pain killer. That should calm him down.
VAN GELDER
Nno! Nnno pain killer! I'll be okay!
MR. MACKEY
Okay uh van Gelder-
VAN GELDER
Nnnaaaah!
MR. MACKEY
-okay uh I'm Counselor Mackey. Have you been smokin' marijawana? Marijawana's bad, mkay?
VAN GELDER
Eh must... tell... the machine. The machine is... e-e-e-ghe gheh-
[Van Gelder collapses.]
MR. MACKEY
Well, I've never seen anything like this. What do you think, principal?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, whatever happened to him happened at the planetarium.
VAN GELDER
Haah! Planetarium!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I think tonight the planetarium is doing Laser Loggins. I might have to check it out.
VAN GELDER
Nnaaah!
[Later that night, at the planetarium, Laser Loggins is underway. "Footloose" plays and Laser displays of feet dance around the ceiling.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh, man, this is boring!
MAN
Yeah, who the heck finds this stuff interesting?
[The camera pans to two teen boys, who look like stoners, sitting in the next section by themselves.]
TEEN 1
Dude, this is totally killer.
TEEN 2
I hope this goes on for like, seven months, man.
[In the booth, Dr. Adams goes to his controls and turns the intensity dial to 8.5, "Footloose" fades, and the lasers close into a narrow beam.]
DR. ADAMS
You will not remember what happened here. To remember it will cause incredible pain.
[He turns the dial to 9.]
DR. ADAMS
Incredible pain!
[He turns the dial even further.]
DR. ADAMS
Incredible icky paaiin!
TEEN 1
Dude, I'm totally tripping.
TEEN 2
This is totally killer.
[South Park Elementary, the next day. The school bell rings.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, today we're going to learn all about Japanese poems called haiku. A haiku is just like a normal American poem, except that it doesn't rhyme, and it's totally stupid. For example- Uh, where is Eric Cartman?
STAN
That's a haiku?
MR. GARRISON
No, I'm asking why Eric Cartman isn't at school.
STAN
Oh.
MR. GARRISON
Was he on the school bus this morning?
STAN
No.
KYLE
[counting off the syllables]
Fatass Cartman was
not on the school bus today.
What a big, fat turd.
MR. GARRISON
Hoh, very good haiku, Kyle. Yes- haikus have five syllables, then seven, then five. Kenny, can you give us another example?
KENNY
(When you rub your dick,
you might find a discharge that
winds up on the floor.)
[The class roars with laughter.]
STAN
Yeah. What's a discharge?
KYLE
Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?
STAN
Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too.
MR. GARRISON
But you were just there! Why do you wanna go again so soon?
STAN
[Stumped, then to Kyle.] Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?
KYLE
I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.
MR. GARRISON
Well, I guess we could go again, since it's just down the street.
[Cartman enters the classroom, a rolled up paper in his hand, full of himself.]
CARTMAN
Well, hello, it's all my little friends with all their little dreams.
MR. GARRISON
Eric, where have you been?
CARTMAN
Let's see, where have I been, where have I been?
STAN
Where have you been, Cartman?
CARTMAN
Wweell, I might have been over at the Cheesy Poofs call-back, winning regional championship!
[He unfurls the paper.]
THE CLASS
Whoa!
[The paper reads, "Cheesy Poof Anthem Regional Champion"]
CARTMAN
This is my regional championship certificate! Do you like it? [Now taunting.] Hey, where is your regional championship 'tificate, Clyde? Oh, you don't have one?
[Clyde looks crestfallen.]
CARTMAN
Hmmm. Do you have a regional certificate, Wendy? Nno?
[Wendy scrunches her face.]
CARTMAN
Apparently, only I do.
KYLE
Ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a Jello mold.
Mouth is flapping, too.
CARTMAN
Your haiku insults have no effect on me, Kyle. I'm regional champion.
STAN
Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?
CARTMAN
It's between me and four other kids. I'm on my way now with my mom to the finals.
KYLE
I bet you don't win.
They don't let big fat asses
perform on TV.
MR. GARRISON
Very good, Kyle.
CARTMAN
Shut your God-damned mouth
or else I'm... gonna... kick you
square in the balls... ass-hole
Aw, damn it!
[Over in Nurse Gollum's office, Van Gelder is still strapped down. Mr. Mackey stops by.]
MR. MACKEY
Um. How's he doing, nurse?
NURSE GOLLUM
He's stable, but I still can't get any information out of him. I'm gonna sedate him now.
VAN GELDER
Nno! No drugs.
MR. MACKEY
Drugs are good, mkay?
VAN GELDER
Nno! Don't let them g-go... planetarium!
NURSE GOLLUM
But why, van Gelder?
VAN GELDER
The machine. The machine is aaaah.
[He stiffens, then collapses.]
MR. MACKEY
The machine is aaaah? Uh that's probably bad.
NURSE GOLLUM
He's been talking about "the machine" for hours. That and Daisy Fuentes.
VAN GELDER
Wha- why in America's Funniest Home Videos? Why?
MR. MACKEY
Uh, there's only one way to get any sense out of him. We're gonna have to try a mind meld, mkay?
NURSE GOLLUM
A what?
MR. MACKEY
Well, it's an ancient technique handed down from school counselor to school counselor. I don't like to use it, but it may be our only hope.
NURSE GOLLUM
Well, what will you need?
MR. MACKEY
Just time to prepare, nurse. Just time. [Oh, the tension!] Mkay?
[Tantalus V. Obsevatory. The class is back.]
DR. ADAMS
Well, children, I'm so glad you came back to learn more.
MR. GARRISON
They just begged to come back; I couldn't get them to shut up about it.
DR. ADAMS
Well, I'm sure we're going to have a marvelous time. Won't we, children?
THE CLASS
Yes.
[The two stoner teens appear, now dressed as employees and with their eyes glazed over.]
TEEN 1
This way, please.
TEEN 2
Enjoy your visit.
[Stan and Kyle look at each other. Moments later, the class is in the theater, looking at the laser show.]
DR. ADAMS
Billions of stars and billions of galaxies make up our universe. Here you see Polaris, the dog star.
[Mr. Garrison gets up and walks by Dr. Adams in the control booth.]
MR. GARRISON
I'm just gonna step outside and go weewee.
DR. ADAMS
Certainly, Mr. Garrison.
[Dr. Adams watches him leave, then quickly turns intensity dial up to 9. The stars brighten and dance rapidly.]
DR. ADAMS
You love the planetarium! To be without the planetarium causes you horrible pain! All you want to do is help the planetarium thrive! To not do so makes your stomach ache with needlelike stab-
[He quickly turns down the intensity upon seeing Mr. Garrison enter the theater. He gestures at his next item.]
DR. ADAMS
...and right over here we see the constellation Orion.
[Mr. Garrison gives him a thumbs up and Dr. Adams waves at him weakly.]
DR. ADAMS
Orion's belt is made up of three stars, one of which is actually a pulsar...
STAN
Dude, what just happened?
KYLE
What do you mean?
STAN
Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens.
[Cheesy Poofs Call Backs Today! Cartman and his mom wait with the other finalists and their parents on sofas in the front office. Cartman is picking at his nose.]
LIANE
Don't pick your nose, hon.
CARTMAN
I wasn't picking it-I had an itch, for cryin' out loud!
LIANE
Don't be nervous. I'm sure you'll win.
CARTMAN
I don't know. There's a lot of competition here.
COSETTE
Do you think I might win, Mommy?
COSETTE'S MOTHER
I hope so, honey. Then perhaps we can eat for a little while.
[Cartman thinks for a second then gets up on the sofa and points out the window.]
CARTMAN
Hey, look! They're giving away bread outside!
COSETTE
[Gasps.] Did you hear that, Mommy?
COSETTE'S MOTHER
Come on! Perhaps we can get some food in our stomachs!
[They rush outside. Cartman follows them to the door and closes it behind them.]
CARTMAN
Sike!
[Back at the planetarium, Stan and Kyle are standing outside, the doors open and the rest of the class straggles out.]
MR. GARRISON
[Noticing them.] What the hell are you boys doing? You're supposed to be in there.
STAN
Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-
KYLE
Sshh!
[Dr. Adams appears at the door.]
DR. ADAMS
Goodbye, children. Thanks for coming.
CLYDE
[Insistently.] I wanna go again. I wanna go again!
MR. GARRISON
Oh, for Pete's sake, Clyde. You just went!
DR. ADAMS
Well, Clyde, if you like the plane'arium so much, perhaps you'd like to do some volunteer work here.
CLYDE
Yes. Yes, please!
SEVERAL KIDS
Me too! And me!
A GIRL
Me too! I wanna do it! I'd love to work here.
ANOTHER GIRL
I'd like to tape the show!
WENDY
Yeah, me too! Me too!
FOSSE
Yeah, me tohohoo. Plahanehetaharium's gahahay!
[The rest of the class chimes in.]
DR. ADAMS
Mr. Garrison?
MR. GARRISON
Well, I guess I could give them extra credit for it.
DR. ADAMS
Excellent! Why don't we step over here and I'll show all you children how to volunteer.
THE CLASS
Hooray!
[All the kids but Stan, Kyle, and Kenny follow Dr. Adams.]
STAN
Dude, this isn't right.
KYLE
Why?
STAN
We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything.
KYLE
Oh, yeah.
STAN
Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there.
[Stan, Kyle, and Kenny go back inside and enter the control booth.]
KYLE
Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.
STAN
Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see.
[Kenny leaves the booth and goes and sits in a seat.]
KENNY
(Okay. Got to have some huggin'.)
STAN
He hits this switch-
[Stan moves the intensity dial to 1 and the power comes on. The lights go down.]
KENNY
(I don't see anything.)
KYLE
You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars.
STAN
Yeah, I guess so.
[Stan moves the intensity to 4. The stars start to revolve.]
KENNY
(Whoa, dude.)
KYLE
What does that do?
STAN
I don't know.
[Stan moves intensity to 7.5, Kenny shakes audibly.]
KYLE
Kenny! What's it doing?
[Kenny can't answer. He just shakes more and more violently.]
STAN
This says "maximum."
[Stan moves Intensity to 10. Kenny shakes more violently, and finally explodes. Stan and Kyle look.]
STAN
Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!
KYLE
We're bastards!
[Stan turns off the power and races with Kyle to Kenny's remains.]
STAN
Dude, I told you something was up with this place!
[Rats start to work on the corpse.]
KYLE
We've gotta go tell somebody, quick!
[Back at the casting office, the finalists are showing their best.]

[He finishes with a flourish and a bow.]
CENTER JUDGE
[Applauds.] Thank you... uh, Peter. We'll let you know very soon.
[Peter leaves the room.]
CENTER JUDGE
Next will be uuh, Eric Theodore Cartman.
[Liane enters with Cartman and a boom box.]
LIANE
Hello, everybody. [To Cartman.] Now, just do it like we rehearsed, hon.
CARTMAN
I know, I know!
[Liane goes to a sofa and plays a tape while Cartman goes before the judges and clears his throat.]
CARTMAN
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right.
[He rips off his jacket and reveals a sky blue sequined vest and bowtie - and his belly button. The judges are surprised.]
CARTMAN
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right.
[He moonwalks, then faces the judges again. End of performance.]
CENTER JUDGE
[Long pause.] Well, Eric Cartman, that certainly was... insane.
CARTMAN
Thank you.
CENTER JUDGE
We'll let you know.
LIANE
Thank you.
[She and Cartman reach the door. Cartman is covering his nose.]
LIANE
Don't pick your nose, hon.
CARTMAN
I'm not pickin' it ma! God damn it, I have an itch!
[They leave and close the door behind them.]
CENTER JUDGE
Jesus, where do we find these people?!
[South Park Elementary. In the nurse's office, Mr. Mackey is mind-melding with Van Gelder.]
MR. MACKEY
Our minds are one. Mkay? Our thoughts are one. Mkay?
NURSE GOLLUM
This is the strangest thing I've ever seen!
MR. MACKEY
Please, nurse, for a woman with a dead fetus on your head, you're not being very open-minded.
[He goes back to concentrating.]
MR. MACKEY
Open your mind to your counselor. Open your mind.
VAN GELDER
[Responding to the mind-meld.] Dr. Adams.
MR. MACKEY
Yes.
NURSE GOLLUM
He owns the planetarium. What about him?
VAN GELDER & MR. MACKEY SIMULTANEOUSLY
He uses the machine. The star machine.
MR. MACKEY
Mkay?
VAN GELDER & MR. MACKEY SIMULTANEOUSLY
He uses it to erase minds.
NURSE GOLLUM
But why?
VAN GELDER & MR. MACKEY SIMULTANEOUSLY
Planetarium, about to go out of business. Adams had to create slaves to survive.
NURSE GOLLUM
My God! This is amazing!
MR. MACKEY
Abuh. Please, nurse, you're throwin' off my chi! Mkay?
[Casting Office. The results are in.]
CENTER JUDGE
Well, we'd certainly like to thank all our finalists. Only one of our finalists can win the grand prize and... unfortunately, that finalist is Eric Cartman.
CARTMAN
[Triumphantly.] Yes! I'm the best!
CENTER JUDGE
You were actually our last choice. Uh the other children have unexpectedly taken jobs as volunteers at the planetarium.
BLONDE JUDGE
That's odd.
CARTMAN
[Joyfully.] Sweeet!
[News 4 Special Report.]
TOM
It appears that more and more South Park residents are discovering the wonder and joy of the planetarium. Here with a special report is a 34-year old Asian man who looks strikingly similar to Ricardo Montalban.
ASIAN REPORTER
Thanks, Tom. Yes, indeed, the planetarium has become very popular as word spreads that it really isn't as lame and stupid as one suspected. I'm here with the planetarium operator, Dr. Adams.
DR. ADAMS
Thank you. I'd like to open an invitation to all South Park residents to come see a special free show this evening. I guarantee, it will change the way you think about the plane'ah-arium.
ASIAN REPORTER
So, bring the whole family to the plane-*tarium* for a night of excitement and wonder.
[South Park Police Department. Stan and Kyle are inside talking to Officer Barbrady.]
STAN
...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis.
OFFICER BARBRADY
That's a pretty far-fetched story, boys.
KYLE
But it's true, dude!
OFFICER BARBRADY
Are you boys sure you're not just making this all up?
STAN
Yeah, pretty sure.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, just as soon as I handle all the other crime in South Park, I'm gonna go with you to the planetarium so I can prove that nothing's wrong.
STAN
What other crime in South Park?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh, yeah. Let's go.
[Time for Cartman's big debut.]
DIRECTOR
Okay. Let's shoot the commercial. Where's our Cheesy Poof talent?
CARTMAN
I'm over here.
[Cartman is dressed as a Cheesy Poof.]
LIANE
Oohh, you look great, hon. Mommy's fat little piggy.
CARTMAN
Aay!
[A stagehand escorts Cartman to the Cheesy Poof backdrop before the camera.]
CARTMAN
Let's hurry. This costume is hot.
DIRECTOR
Okay, roll camera, aaand action.
CARTMAN
I love Cheesy Poofs, you-
LIANE
Oh wait, wait.
[She runs in with a handkerchief.]
LIANE
You've got a little eye booger, hon.
CARTMAN
Oh, Mom, for Pete's sake!
[She wipes it off.]
LIANE
Got it.
[She moves off the stage.]
DIRECTOR
Aaand action.
CARTMAN
I love Cheesy Poofs-
DIRECTOR
Hold it! Cut! Could we get some more light on that backdrop?
STAGEHAND
Sure thing.
[He adjusts the lighting.]
CARTMAN
Oh, man, c'mon!
STAGEHAND
Got it.
DIRECTOR
Okay. Here we go, aaand action.
CARTMAN
I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Chee-
DIRECTOR
Cut!
CARTMAN
What?!
DIRECTOR
I'm not liking the shoes. Could we change the shoes?
CARTMAN
Oh, God damnit!
[Officer Barbrady, Stan, and Kyle show up at the planetarium. Officer Barbrady knocks and the door opens.]
DR. ADAMS
Oh. Hello, officer of the law.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Hello, Mr. Planetarium Operator.
DR. ADAMS
What brings you out here?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, these boys seem to think you're some kind of sick weirdo that's got a master plan to screw with the minds of everyone in town.
[Officer Barbrady starts laughing.]
DR. ADAMS
Oh, really?
[Dr. Adams leans forward menacingly. The boys huddle close to Barbrady.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Yeah. I just thought I'd come show them around so they'd know there's nothing to be scared of.
[Officer Barbrady advances, but Dr. Adams blocks the door.]
DR. ADAMS
Actually, this is a pretty inopportune time.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Okay, I'll be quick, then.
DR. ADAMS
Of course, officer. Come on in.
[Officer Barbrady and the boys enter. What they see inside is something else. Kids, Bebe among them, are sweeping and cleaning the exhibits. Chef is helping out, too. All of them are wearing gray planetarium suits.]
CHEF
[In a low monotone.] Hello, children.
STAN
Oh, no! They got Chef, too!
CHEF
Welcome to the planetarium.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, it's nice to see you finally got a real job, Chef.
CHEF
[Slowly, mechanically.] I love my work.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh I know what you mean. I've always loved the planetarium, too.
DR. ADAMS
Would you like to see the stars, officer?
STAN, KYLE
No!
OFFICER BARBRADY
That would be super-duper!
[He walks into the theater with Dr. Adams.]
KYLE
Don't do it, Officer Barbrady!
[Cartman's house. He's calling everyone he knows...]
ELDERLY WOMAN
[On the phone.] Hello?
CARTMAN
Hi, Grandma. It's me, Eric.
GRANDMA
Oh, hello, Eric. Grandma sure has missed you.
CARTMAN
I just wanted to remind you that I'm gonna be on television tonight, so be sure to watch.
GRANDMA
Oh, I will, Eric. You know, I remember when I was a little girl and had my first talent show audition for-
CARTMAN
Okay, bye.
[He dials the next number.]
THE MARSHES' ANSWERING MACHINE
Hello? The-uh Marshes aren't in right now. Please leave a message.
CARTMAN
Stan? I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Be sure to watch.
[He dials another number.]
THE BROFLOVSKIS' ANSWERING MACHINE
Hello, you've reached the Broflovskis. Please, leave a message.
CARTMAN
Where the hell is everybody?! I'm gonna be on TV tonight. You guys better not miss it!
[Back at the planetarium...]
DR. ADAMS
And this is the constellation called Cassiopeia.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh, neato!
DR. ADAMS
[Turning intensity up to 8.5] And now, officer, from this moment on, you will think that you are Elvis Presley.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Who?
DR. ADAMS
To not be Elvis will cause you great pain.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Pain.
DR. ADAMS
You see, children? There's no stopping me. Even your highly intelligent policemen are no match for me.
KYLE
He's not highly intelligent.
STAN
Why are you doing this, dude?
DR. ADAMS
Why? Because nowadays kids have computers, surround-sound television. They've forgotten all about plane'ariums. But I'll make them remember, starting with the two of you!
[Cartman's house. He's watching the TV for his commercial.]
VOICE-OVER
Terrance and Phillip will be right back after these announcements.
CARTMAN
Oh, dude, here it comes!
CHEESY POOFS COMMERCIAL
Packed full of ingredients, Cheesy Poofs can really give you that quick pick-me-up. So remember, [A dancing Cheesy Poofs box appears.]
I love Cheesy Poofs,
you love Cheesy Poofs
[The box opens and Cheesy Poof pour out.]
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs,
we'd be-
[The Cheesy Poofs rain down on a pile of Cheesy Poof in which children swim.]
CHEESY POOF CARTMAN
Lame.
VOICE-OVER
And now back to Terrance and Phillip.
CARTMAN
Yes! Yes, that was me! I was on television!
[Mr. Mackey and Nurse Gollum burst through the planetarium doors. Mr. Mackey is pissed. Facing them are Dr. Adams, Officer Barbrady, Stan, Kyle, and the two stoner teens.]
MR. MACKEY
Aha! Caught you red-handed! Mkay!
STAN
Mr. Mackey!
MR. MACKEY
Officer Barbrady, uh, this man is using some kind of mind control.
OFFICER BARBRADY
[Doing a twisted Elvis Presley.] Wuzzariah? Ulduhooyah? Guh. Ahoohooyuh?
NURSE GOLLUM
What's wrong with him?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Ah-yeah, babe, yeah, babe
uhyeah hwah yeah hwah wayah ahowowowowayah.
MR. MACKEY
Oh no, apparently, he thinks he's Charlton Heston.
DR. ADAMS
No, you idiot! He thinks he's Elvis. [To Barbrady.] Elvis, escort our guests to the plane'arium.
OFFICER BARBRADY
[Snapping into a sharp Elvis.] Holdjit
[He pulls out his gun and shoves it into Mackey's nose.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
If you wouldn't mind, uugh. Could you please follow me?
MR. MACKEY
Uh oh.
OFFICER BARBRADY
[Voice skipping up the scales.] Odle-oh who whoo?
[The planetarium, that night. Nurse Gollum, Mr. Mackey, Stan, and Kyle are strapped into their seats in the theater.]
DR ADAMS
Well, let's begin, shall we?
[He starts up the laser show controls.]
DR. ADAMS
And now you'll remember nothing, except that the planet'arium is the best thing you've ever known!
[Cartman enters, oblivious to the star machine.]
CARTMAN
Well, well well! You guys can now kiss my ass, because I was on television!
[The other four are entranced now.]
CARTMAN
Ey! Didn't you guys see it?! I was on television!
[He sees that the others aren't responding.]
CARTMAN
You missed it! You missed it because of this stupid planetarium!
[He walks up to the star machine and kicks it. It falls down and breaks into pieces.]
CARTMAN
Planetariums suck ass!
[The star machine's beams come at Dr. Adams at full force and go right into his eyes.]
DR. ADAMS
Aaah. Aaah. Aaah.
KYLE
[Coming out of the trance.] Cartman! You saved us!
[The others come out of it too.]
CARTMAN
What the hell are you talking about?
STAN
Get over here and untie us!
[Cartman rushes over and starts untying them, Mr. Mackey first.]
MR. MACKEY
Eric, you really saved the day. Mkay?
OFFICER BARBRADY
[Rushing in.] Not so fast there, tubby. Uh I'm just takin' care of business.
[Cartman stops.]
MR. MACKEY
Think hard, Elvis. You're not really the king of rock and roll. You're a fat, stupid, worthless policeman in a small town. Mkay?
OFFICER BARBRADY
[Snapping out of it.] Oh, thank you from a fate worse than death, counselor.
[Stan notices the destruction of the star machine, and the fate of Dr. Adams.]
STAN
Oh my God! Dr. Adams!
[Everyone rushes to the control room window to see what's happened. Dr. Adams is seated inside against a wall, slumped on his right side.]
KYLE
He got a full dose of the stars.
STAN
Yeah. With nobody around to say anything.
KYLE
Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing.
CARTMAN
Wow. What a day this has been. I was on TV, and, I'm a hero.
[Cartman scratches his nose.]
LIANE
[Looking in.] Don't pick your nose, hon.
CARTMAN
God damnit, Mom, I wasn't pickin' it! I have an itch!
[End of Roger Ebert Should Lay Off The Fatty Foods. The Cheesy Poofs anthem plays.]
End of Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Stan and Kyle are psyched to have Wendy and Bebe visit their clubhouse for a game of Truth or Dare, but first they have to build one.

script:Clubhouses

[Episode starts in the playground. Bill plays catch with a blue-hatted boy in a red shirt, a brown-haired girl, Annie, and Tolkien are on swings, and Pip and Red are on the hobby elephants. Stan is hiding behind a tree, using his gloved hand as a gun.]
STAN
Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.
[Cartman is patrolling the invisible boundary.]
STAN
Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.
[Stan waits for Cartman, who is wielding a stick, shaped vaguely like a pistol, to pass, then rushes past him.]
STAN
American base is only a few feet away.
[Cartman turns and notices Stan.]
CARTMAN
What is this? Halt!
[They "fire" away at each other. From behind a nearby bush Kyle and Kenny pop up and "fire" at Cartman.]
CARTMAN
It will take more than your weak American weapons to destroy me!
STAN
Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass!
KYLE
Yeah! You're dead!
CARTMAN
I have Class 4 armor on, that, uh, ih-ih--
STAN
No, you don't!
CARTMAN
--special armor, that's impenetrable to American bullets.
KYLE
Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!
STAN
Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself!
[Stan and Kyle leave.]
CARTMAN
That's fine! I'd like playing with myself! I'll play with myself all day long!
[Kenny laughs and Cartman looks at him.]
CARTMAN
What?
[Stan and Kyle have walked off away from Cartman and Kenny.]
KYLE
Well? Now what are we going to do?
STAN
Huh-I dunno.
[Wendy walks up, with Bebe closely following behind her.]
WENDY
Hi, Stan.
STAN
Hi, Wendy.
WENDY
Kyle, doesn't Bebe look pretty today?
[Bebe comes out from behind Wendy, looking hopeful.]
KYLE
I dunno.
WENDY
She does. She looks very pretty.
KYLE
Okay.
WENDY
Stan, can I talk to you for a second?
[Wendy takes his hand and pulls him aside. Bebe and Kyle are left to look at each other. Bebe smiles at Kyle, and he looks around and put his hands behind him. The two remain silent. She's still smiling. Wendy and Stan walk out of earshot from them.]
WENDY
Stan, wouldn't it be fun if we fixed Kyle up with Bebe?
STAN
No.
WENDY
If Bebe and Kyle were a couple, then we can invite them over to your clubhouse for dinner and play parlor games and have meaningful conversations and sip cognac by the fireplace.
STAN
We could?
WENDY
Yeah, Stan.
STAN
But dude, I don't have a clubhouse.
WENDY
You don't?? I thought all guys had clubhouses.
STAN
Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?
[Back near the tree, Cartman is sitting on Kenny who is struggling to escape.]
CARTMAN
Herr Kommandant Cartman has ways of making you talk!
[Kenny is too weak to escape and Cartman farts on him.]
KENNY
(Heellp!!)
WENDY
Stan, you have to build a clubhouse! Then all four of us can sit in it and play Truth or Dare!
STAN
[Intrigued.] Truth or Dare? Wow.
[Stan walks back over to Kyle.]
STAN
Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do.
KYLE
We do?
STAN
We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help.
[They walk off. Bebe's eyes follow them out, and Wendy rejoins her.]
BEBE
[To Wendy.] Did it work?
WENDY
I think it did, Bebe. If all goes as planned, Kyle will be your new boyfriend.
BEBE
I hope so Wendy. He's got such a hot ass.
[The Marsh house. Randy turns on the TV and ends up on Terrance and Phillip, who are in a church.]
TERRANCE
Hey, Phillip, pull my finger.
PHILLIP
All right, Terrance.
[Phillip pulls Terrance's finger.]
TERRANCE
Hurgh. Oh, wait wait wait. Pull harder.
PHILLIP
Well, all right.
[Phillip tugs harder.]
TERRANCE
Hurgh, urgh.
[Randy laughs.]
TERRANCE
Damnit! Pull really hard, Phillip!
PHILLIP
Okay.
TERRANCE
Hurgh-rrh. Waiwait, wait wait. Hrhrhrhrh. Aha! Hr-rhrh. Oh my! Yeee-aaa!
[Terrance takes a deep breath to try to push out a fart.]
TERRANCE
Hurh. Uhwaiwait. Ye-aauraah-
[A weak, high pitched fart finally escapes, and the two laugh.]
TERRANCE
Caught you there!
RANDY
Uh oh!
[Randy laughs, as Stan and Kyle approach.]
PHILLIP
God. Oh, you got me, Terrance!
TERRANCE
Yes, I sure did!
[Randy laughs some more.]
KYLE
Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip.
RANDY
No, I was just uh flipping through the channels.
[He starts changing the channels.]
STAN
Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse.
RANDY
Okay.
STAN
How do we do it?
RANDY
Uh, you just get a hammer and some wood. What? Uh some girls wanna play Truth or Dare or something?
STAN
Yeah, dude! How'd you know?
[Stan and Kyle are stunned.]
RANDY
How do you think I met your mother?
SHARON
[Walks in.] Randy, my wedding ring! I lost it down the garbage disposal!
RANDY
Oh, brother.
[Terrance and Phillip are heard laughing, and Sharon looks at the TV. Phillip, right leg high, farts on Terrance, and they both continue laughing.]
SHARON
Stanley, I thought I told you not to watch this horrible cartoon!
RANDY
Yeah, Stanley, you should know better.
STAN
Dude!
[Sharon takes the remote from Randy and presses a few buttons.]
SHARON
Here, Stanley, You watch nice cartoons like Fat Abbot.
SHARON
Randy, will you please come get my wedding ring out of the sink?
RANDY
[Resisting.] Okay, okay.
[Randy follows her off into the kitchen as the boys watch Fat Abbot.]
FAT ABBOT
Hey hey hey. What's goin' on, Rudy?
RUDY
Man, Fat Abbot, you need to lose weight.
FAT ABBOT
I'll lose weight when I feel like it, bitch! Shut yo bitchass mouth, ho!
RUDY
Bitch, I'll kick yo ass!
KYLE
Whoa, dude!
STAN
Sweet!
FAT ABBOT
You think you're slick, you punkass blasphemous dope-fiend bitch! I had my jimmy whacked seven times last week! I'll bust a cap in yo n***a ass, shithead!
KYLE
Wow, cartoons are getting really dirty!
[Over in the kitchen, Randy is under the sink.]
SHARON
Did you find it?
RANDY
Give me a second, would you?
SHARON
Don't snap at me!
RANDY
I didn't snap at you.
SHARON
You snapped at me!
RANDY
Whatever.
SHARON
What ever?! In fifteen years you've never said, "whatever," to me!
RANDY
I-I don't wanna fight, I'm sorry.
SHARON
I'm sorry, too.
RANDY
Uh I think I found it.
[He comes out from under the sink with an alarm clock.]
SHARON
That's not it, you idiot!
RANDY
Hey, back off, bitch!
SHARON
[Gasps.] You just said the C-word!
RANDY
Did I?
[Stan and Kyle are outside working on their clubhouse. The steps, supports, and floor are in place, and they start work on the railing.]
STAN
This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.
KYLE
Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?
STAN
Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play.
KYLE
Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass.
STAN
Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?
KYLE
What? Why?
STAN
Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs.
KYLE
Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives!
[Cartman and Kenny stop by.]
CARTMAN
What are you guys doing?
STAN
We're building a clubhouse.
CARTMAN
[Laughs heartily.] A clubhouse? Heheh, that's the lamest thing I've ever heard!
KYLE
It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!
CARTMAN
[Thinks it over.] Wwwhy??
KYLE
Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday?
STAN
Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!
CARTMAN
That's fine. We'll build our own clubhouse!
KYLE
Fine!
CARTMAN
Fine! And then we'll get girls to play Truth or Dare, too!
STAN
Fine!
CARTMAN
Fine!
KYLE
Fine!
KENNY
(Fine!)
KYLE
Fine!
CARTMAN
Fine! That's fine.
[Cartman turns and walks away with Kenny.]
STAN
Fine!
CARTMAN
Fine!
[Cartman's house. Cartman and Kenny are looking over the clubhouse kit Cartman has apparently ordered: The Ewok Village 2000 Deluxe Club House Kit w/Elevator. It has a two-story design. Cartman is wearing a yellow hard hat, and Kenny is trying to get a better look at the blueprints.]
CARTMAN
No, Kenny, you can't look, I'm the foreman!
KENNY
(Well, why the fuck do I have to do everything while you stand around in the snow lookin--)
[Kenny inches the blueprints closer to himself.]
CARTMAN
Because, Kenny, your family's poor. You have to be the worker.
KENNY
[Still trying.] (Uh--)
CARTMAN
No, Kenny.
LIANE
[Stopping by.] How's the treehouse coming along, hon?
CARTMAN
Mom, it's not a treehouse, it's a clubhouse!
LIANE
Sorry, hon.
CARTMAN
Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room?
LIANE
Well, I don't know, Eric. If you did that, then the floors would be bare.
CARTMAN
[Sliding into a whine.] But Mmmom, the blueprint says we need carpeting in the clubhouse!
LIANE
Well, all right.
CARTMAN
Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now.
KENNY
(You suck ass and you suck dick!)
[Kenny walks off to get the carpeting.]
CARTMAN
And stop your bitchin'!
[Stan's House, Stan enters the kitchen and reaches for a jar as his mom washes dishes. She's upset.]
SHARON
What are you doing, sweetheart?
STAN
Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--
SHARON
You men are all alike. First you get a cookie and then you criticize the way I dress and then it's the way I cook! I suppose next you'll be telling me that you need your space and that I'm sabotaging your creativity. Go ahead, Stanley, get your God-damned cookie!
[She walks off in a huff.]
STAN
'Kay.
[South Park Elementary. Class is now in session. Mr. Twig is still there.]
MR. GARRISON
And so, children, today we're gonna focus on American history, right Mr. Twig?
MR. TWIG
Uh- that's right, Mr. Garrison. American history is very important--
KYLE
When is Mr. Hat coming back?
MR. GARRISON
What did you say?!
KYLE
When is Mr. Hat coming back?
MR. GARRISON
I told you to never mention that name in my classroom again! Mr. Hat is a two-timin' whore, and now we all learn from Mr. Twig!
STAN
But Mr. Twig sucks.
CLASS
Yeah.
MR. GARRISON
That is enough! Mr. Hat is gone, and he isn't coming back, and I don't wanna hear it! Anyway, children, lets turn our history textbooks to page 105, which should be right after page 104...
CARTMAN
So, how's your lame-ass clubhouse, Stan?
STAN
Better than yours, fat boy.
CARTMAN
We'll see about that. [To Kenny.] Don't forget you need to cut school early and wait for the hot tub, Kenny.
KENNY
[Gruffly.] (Yes, sir..!)
WENDY
Is the clubhouse ready?
STAN
Almost.
MR. GARRISON
Stan? Are you paying attention?
STAN
Yes, Mr. Garrison.
MR. GARRISON
Well, then, Stanley. What did I just say?
STAN
Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings.
MR. GARRISON
...Well, okay. I suppose you were paying attention.
[Mr. Garrison turns to write on the blackboard.]
MR. GARRISON
Anyway, children, the Love Boat did go on for about eight years. They tried to bring it back recently, but it didn't work. Probably 'cause Robert Urich had to weigh...
[While he's explaining the mediocrity of The Love Boat: The Next Wave, the following takes place.]
KYLE
Good guess, dude!
STAN
Phew.
[Bebe writes a note and then hands it to Butters.]
BEBE
Pssst! Pass this up.
[Butters hands along the note to Kevin.]
BUTTERS
Pass this up.
[Kevin hands along the note to Fosse.]
KEVIN
Pass this up.
[Fosse hands along the note to Stan.]
FOSSE
P-huh pass this h-up.
[Stan gets the note and reads it.]
MR. GARRISON
Stanley, are you passing notes to Kyle?!
STAN
No, I just--
MR. GARRISON
Don't lie, Stan. Lying makes you sterile.
STAN
I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--
MR. GARRISON
Stanley, if you think it's so important to keep interrupting my class, then why don't you come up to the front and read your note to Kyle for everyone to hear!
STAN
But I didn't write the note!
CARTMAN
Mr. Garrison, Stan's behavior is having an adverse effect on my education.
STAN
Shut up, Cartman!
MR. GARRISON
Stanley Marsh, you come up here right now and read your note!
STAN
Oh, man.
[Bebe is worried, as Stan goes up to the front of the class to read the note.]
STAN
Dear Kyle.
You have got such a great ass.
I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you.
 I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity.
[The entire class stares at Stan in shock.]
STAN
Whoa, dude!
[Mr. Mackey's office. Stan and Mr. Mackey are talking.]
MR. MACKEY
Now, young man, uh- school is a time for learning, m'kay? Not for immature skylarkings.
STAN
What's 'skylarkings'?
MR. MACKEY
You know, like tomfooleries.
STAN
Who?
[Someone knocks on Mr. Mackey's door.]
MR. MACKEY
Oh, your parents are here.
STAN
Oh, no.
[They enter and stand behind Stan.]
MR. MACKEY
Thank you for coming on such short notice. I was just disciplining your son for his skylarkings.
RANDY
Stanley, I... Skylarkings?
MR. MACKEY
Yeahm'kay?
RANDY
Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.
SHARON
Randy, let me handle this. Now Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.
STAN
It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's.
MR. MACKEY
Okay. Stanley, we're all here to get to the root of your behavior disorder.
SHARON
You really should know better, Stanley.
RANDY
You need to shape up, mister.
SHARON
[To Randy.] Don't interrupt me! You always interrupt me when I talk! Can't you see that I--?
RANDY
[A bit testily.] I don't interrupt you.
SHARON
There, you did it again! [To Mr. Mackey.] He interrupted me again.
MR. MACKEY
Okay, uh-- Perhaps you should let your wife finish talking, Mr. Marsh. Now, Stan, I want to you to be--
RANDY
Okay, I'm sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation!
MR. MACKEY
Uh. U-uh, taking over any conversation's bad.
SHARON
[To Randy.] Like you're one to talk! When's the last time you really listened to what I had to say?!
MR. MACKEY
[Slowly.] Uuuhh. Mmm mkay.
RANDY
When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap!
MR. MACKEY
Okay uh uh uh-apparently we have a bit of a communication problem here. Uh, Mr. Marsh, tell me how you're feeling.
RANDY
Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say.
MR. MACKEY
Mkay. That's valid. Now, uh, Mrs. Marsh--
STAN
Excuse me.
MR. MACKEY
-how do you feel?
SHARON
Like I'm a ghost. Like he sees right through me.
RANDY
Oh, please!
STAN
Hello?
SHARON
Oh, please yourself!
MR. MACKEY
Who tries to control the marriage? And by that I mean, who's dominating the aspects of the relationship?
SHARON
He is.
[At this point everyone has completely forgotten about Stan, who gets off the chair.]
RANDY
No, she is.
[Stan walks to the door and opens it.]
SHARON
Oh, I'm sorry! I guess I'm wrong again!
[Stan is gone.]
MR. MACKEY
Mmkay.
[Cartman's house. Foreman Cartman is back at the blueprint.]
CARTMAN
Look at it, Kenny. It is the greatest clubhouse ever built.
[A shot of their "clubhouse". It looks shoddy and horrible.]
CARTMAN
Oh, man!
KENNY
(Uh huh)
CARTMAN
And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny.
KENNY
(Yeah!)
CARTMAN
All right. You go find chicks, Kenny.
KENNY
(Well, why do I have to be the one to go and find chicks?)
CARTMAN
Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'!
[Kenny walks off and Cartman watches him leave. As soon as he's gone, Cartman throws off his hat and runs into the house.]
CARTMAN
Mom, can I watch American Gladiators?
[Stan's Backyard, Kyle is on the clubhouse floor, waiting as Stan climbs up the steps. A tire swing hangs from the foundation.]
KYLE
Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.
STAN
I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.
KYLE
To me??
STAN
I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow!
[They start hammering a board onto the floor, but...]
KYLE
We should use nails, dude.
STAN
My mom won't let us.
[Wendy and Bebe arrive in backyard.]
WENDY
Hi, guys. How's the clubhouse coming?
STAN
Pretty good. We're almost done.
WENDY
Well, hurry! We wanna play Truth or Dare!
STAN
We're going as fast as we can!
BEBE
Kyle, could you turn around for a second?
[Kyle and Stan look at each other. Kyle turns around, then looks back with Stan at the girls.]
BEBE
Thank you.
[The girls walk away, and the boys resume hammering.]
STAN
Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster.
KYLE
Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?
STAN
No.
KYLE
Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?
STAN
I didn't even think about that.
[Later, at Chef's house. Candles line his dining room wall, and he and Stan are sitting at his table.]
CHEF
And then, they'll ask, "Truth or Dare?'
STAN
And I say, "Dare!"
CHEF
No no! You say, "Truth."
STAN
"Truth?" But that's boring! I want to get "Dare" to kiss her.
CHEF
You have to say "Truth" the first few times. Or else, you seem too eager.
STAN
Oooh.
CHEF
You can't seem too eager. You've got to play it cool, like you don't even care what happens.
STAN
Yeah.
CHEF
Then, after a few "Truth"s, you finally answer, "Dare."
STAN
"Dare!"
CHEF
But not like that, son. Like this: "Daaare".
[Chef speaks in a low, senusal voice, as he moves his hand through the air in unison, for effect.]
STAN
Oooh.
CHEF
And then her little friend will dare you to kiss Wendy.
STAN
You really think so?
CHEF
Of course she will. They're women. They've had this whole thing planned out months ahead of time.
STAN
Wow!
[Meanwhile, over at Cartman's house. Cartman is watching TV, munching Cheesy Poofs.]
FAT ABBOT
Heeyy hey hey. What's goin' down, y'all?
RUDY
Man, Fat Abbot. What are you doin' on this side of the 'hood?
FAT ABBOT
You know somethin', Rudy? You're like school in summertime.
RUDY
School in summertime?
FAT ABBOT
Yeah, bitch, school in summertime!
[Fat Abbot grabs Rudy by the collar and lifts him up high.]
FAT ABBOT
Open yo' fuckin' ears and shit, ho, or I'll pop your bitch ass.
DONALD
I'llba poppa yourba bitcha assa tooba, bitcha.
CARTMAN
What the hell is goin' on in this cartoon?
[Cartman's doorbell rings, and he gets up to answer.]
CARTMAN
Oh. Hey, Kenny, did you find any chicks to come to the clubhouse?
KENNY
[Proudly, with thumbs up.] (Uh-huh)
[Kenny has found two teenage girls.]
RUNAWAY GIRL 1
Hi. We ran away from home.
RUNAWAY GIRL 2
Well like, this kid told us we might be able to crash at your clubhouse for a couple of days.
CARTMAN
[Amazed.] Holy crap!
[He leads the three of them to the backyard.]
CARTMAN
Behold! The Ewok Village 2000!
RUNAWAY GIRL 1
Oh well, I guess it beats living at home.
CARTMAN
[Enunciating properly.] Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack? [Rubs his stomach.]
[Meanwhile, over at Stan's house, Stan's phone starts ringing.]
STAN
Hello?
CARTMAN
How's the clubhouse coming, Stan?
STAN
We're working on it.
CARTMAN
Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over.
STAN
No, you don't!
[Female giggles are heard through the phone, and Stan pulls the receiver from his ear.]
STAN
Dude!
CARTMAN
It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole.
STAN
Aw, that hunk of fat-- [Sharon walks in.] Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?
SHARON
Stanley, I think you should know that your father has moved out.
STAN
What?! Why?
SHARON
Because, we're divorced, Stanley.
STAN
Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?
SHARON
Yeah, kind of.
STAN
...Dude, you're not supposed to say that!
SHARON
But I would like you to meet your new stepfather, Roy.
ROY
Hello, son.
STAN
What?!
SHARON
I'll leave you two alone to get acquainted.
[Sharon leaves.]
ROY
Hello, Stanley. I know this must be a very difficult period for you right now, and the adjustment is going to take some time. But I'd like to be your friend. So when you're ready, I want you to feel free to come to me with anything you might need, whether it's advice, or- just someone to play catch with. You can count on me.
STAN
This is happening way too fast.
ROY
Oh, Jesus! When are you gonna cut me some slack, huh?! I have taken you under my wing and done my best, and all you ever do is whine and moan about it! Now, for the last time, go cut some firewood!
[Roy walks off. Stan stares after him blankly. Meanwhile, back at Cartman's house.]
RUNAWAY GIRL 1
So, I'm on my way out the door, and she goes, "Make sure you're home before midnight!"
CARTMAN
Ahaw, that's weak.
RUNAWAY GIRL 1
And I go, "Listen, bitch! I don't need my mother giving me no curfew!"
CARTMAN
That's killer.
RUNAWAY GIRL 1
And she goes, "Yeah, well, if you're not home before midnight, don't bother coming home at all!"
CARTMAN
That's totally weak!
RUNAWAY GIRL 1
So I go, "Fine! I won't come home!"
CARTMAN
Sweet.
RUNAWAY GIRL 1
And then she goes, "Fine! Don't come home!", getting all up in my face and crap and acting all tough and crap.
CARTMAN
Killer weak, sweet!
RUNAWAY GIRL 1
I'm sixteen. I should be able to do what I want when I want.
[Cartman listens intently.]
RUNAWAY GIRL 1
I don't need her breathing down my neck every two seconds telling me what I can and cannot do!
CARTMAN
I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, "Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gonna fingerpaint!"
[The girls just look at him. Back at Stan's house, Stan and Kyle are putting the finishing touches on their clubhouse.]
STAN
Okay. We're done.
KYLE
[Wiggling the railing.] Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy.
[A piece of it comes off in his hand and falls to the ground, where it breaks.]
STAN
It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls.
[Stan climbs down.]
KYLE
Okay.
[Stan is humming as he is going away, but his is stopped by a pair of legs, he looks up.]
STAN
G'oh?
SHARON
Stanley, it's time to go!
STAN
Go where?
SHARON
Your bastard father has visitation rights, and this is his time with you.
STAN
But no! I have to get the girls to come-
SHARON
Come on, Stanley!
[She takes him away by the hand.]
STAN
Weak!
[A car is heard pulling up. It's Randy, in a red Corvette.]
STAN
Dad?
RANDY
Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in.
[Stan gets in, and they peel off.]
RANDY
Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up.
STAN
But I don't understand why we have to--
[Randy pulls up and stops next to a pink Jeep.]
RANDY
Well, hello, ladies.
RUNAWAY GIRL 1 PASSENGER
Hi, handsome. We're gonna be at Larry's Bar tonight.
RANDY
[Suavely.] I'm already there.
[She winks at him and the ladies peel off. Randy turns to Stan.]
RANDY
What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more.
STAN
Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?
RANDY
Well, no, because you're a family. You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what.
STAN
But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?
[Randy is stumped.]
STAN
You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.
RANDY
Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it.
[Randy pulls back up at Stan's house.]
RANDY
Well, anyway, have a nice day.
STAN
What? That's it?
RANDY
Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out.
[Stan gets out of the car.]
RANDY
You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan?
STAN
I guess, but--
[Before Stan can finish, Randy drives off, Stan just watches, speechless. Moments later, he is inside his clubhouse with Kyle, they are looking out the window in anticipation of Wendy and Bebe coming over.]
STAN
Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute.
KYLE
Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls.
STAN
No way, dude! Don't be silly.
BEBE
[Off screen.] Come on, Wendy.
STAN
We have to say "Truth" a couple of times before we say "Dare," right?
KYLE
Right. Why?
STAN
Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager.
KYLE
Too eager to what?
STAN
To say "Dare," dumbass! Jeez.
WENDY
[Entering the clubhouse.] Hi, guys.
[The boys are startled, but turn around.]
STAN
Oh, hi Wendy. What's up?
BEBE
Don't you guys still wanna play "Truth or Dare"?
STAN
Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever.
BEBE
Then come on!
[They all sit, Wendy across from Stan, Bebe across from Kyle.]
STAN
[To Kyle, softly.] Remember, "Truth" the first couple of times.
KYLE
Okay.
BEBE
Who wants to go first?
WENDY
I will. Kyle?
KYLE
Yeah?
WENDY
Truth or Dare?
KYLE
Umm. Dare?
[Stan looks at him angrily, then punches him on the arm.]
STAN
Dude!
KYLE
What?
WENDY
[Whispers.] How about we give him Bebe?
BEBE
[Whispers.] Okay.
WENDY
[Whispers.] Okay.
BEBE
[Whispers.] Okay.
WENDY
Kiss Bebe on the lips!
KYLE
What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl!
WENDY
What's the matter, Kyle?
KYLE
It's just wrong, that's all.
STAN
Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes.
KYLE
What the hell have you gotten me into?!
STAN
Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?
[Kyle thinks for a moment then looks at Bebe.]
KYLE
Hoh boy.
[Kyle puckers up, Bebe comes and gives him a peck on the lips.]
KYLE
Sick!
[He gets up and rushes to the entrance.]
KYLE
Aggghhh! Fucking sickening!
[Kyle shimmies on down.]
BEBE
[Staring at him as he leaves.] Wow, look at that ass! Shake it, baby!
WENDY
Your turn, Bebe.
BEBE
[Seated back by Wendy.] Okay, Stan. Truth or Dare?
[Stan takes a moment to look at Wendy, then at her lips.]
BEBE
Stan, Truth or Dare?
STAN
[Sensually.] Dare.
[Before Bebe can respond and bring Stan to Wendy's sweet lips, Roy pops in, ruining everything.]
ROY
Son, could you please help me with the firewood?
STAN
...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!
ROY
When will you let me in? Let me love you?! Now, get your ass out here and help me.
WENDY
Bye, Stan. Hopefully we can play Truth or Dare tomorrow.
STAN
Crap!
[Over at Cartman's clubhouse.]
RUNAWAY GIRL 1
I think you should be able to move out legally when you're fourteen.
RUNAWAY GIRL 2
[Pulls out a cigarette.] Our moms won't even let us smoke.
RUNAWAY GIRL 1
Yeah, it's my body. My mom always gives me shit for smoking, but it's my body. I should be able to do whatever I want with it.
CARTMAN
Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts!
[Just then, Liane calls up to him and he freezes.]
LIANE
Eric, snookums! it's time for Mommy to tuck you into your snuggleboat for night-night.
[He's clearly alarmed now.]
LIANE
Eric, are you out there in your clubhouse?
CARTMAN
[Voice shaking.] Coming, Mom. [To the girls.] Okay, we have to play Truth or Dare, quick!
GUY IN LEATHER JACKET
Hey, girls.
GUY WITH LONG HAIR
What's up.
RUNAWAY GIRL 1
Oh hey, Scott.
CARTMAN
Who the hell are you?!
RUNAWAY GIRL 2
Uh- we invited some people over. Hope you don't mind.
CARTMAN
How many people?
[The bus stop, next day. Kyle is alone, and Bebe walks up.]
BEBE
Kyle, can I talk to you?
KYLE
Okay.
BEBE
Kyle, this is very difficult for me. I think we need time apart.
KYLE
Huh?
BEBE
I'm just feeling really trapped. I can't go on with this codependency.
KYLE
Okay, that's fine.
[Bebe covers Kyle's mouth with her mitten.]
BEBE
No, no. Don't speak. Just try and understand. It has to be this way.
KYLE
[Muffled.] But I don't care.
BEBE
Please. Just remember the good times we had. I'll never forget you. Never.
[She walks over to love interest.]
BEBE
Okay, Clyde, we can go now.
CLYDE
Bitchin'.
[Clyde walks off after her. Back at Stan's house, Roy is watching a home decorating show. Stan comes in.]
HOST
These are café curtains that require no sewing, and I know you all love that!
[A smattering of applause. Not many audience members.]
STAN
Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.
ROY
Nnuuhunuuhh.
STAN
What?
ROY
Chores. Do chores.
STAN
My dad lets me watch cartoons.
ROY
Well I'm not your dad. Okay? I'm not your dad! You- you can't just go around playing games with my emotions.
[Roy starts weeping and walks away as Sharon approaches.]
SHARON
[Arms on her hips.] Stanley, what did you do to Roy?
STAN
Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!
SHARON
[Sighs.] Stanley, you know you're the most important thing to me, right?
STAN
If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me!
SHARON
Now Stanley, you have to understand how divorce works. When I say, "you're the most important thing to me," what I mean is, you're the most important thing after me and my happiness and my new romances.
STAN
Oh.
SHARON
Bye now. Roy!
[Sharon goes after him.]
STAN
Divorce is stupid.
[Stan clicks on the TV, and "Fat Abbot" comes on.]
FAT ABBOT
Heeyy heeyy heeyy! Hey Yolanda. Why is your eye all black and blue and shit?
YOLANDA
Maaan, Fat Abbot. My stepdad popped me in my eye.
FAT ABBOT
Stepdad? You gotta off his ass!
YOLANDA
Really?
FAT ABBOT
Yeah, bitch! Snatch his ass in a bear trap! Leave that motherfucker swingin' from a tree so high nobody finds him for days! Glock-glock, you know what I'm sayin'? Dumbassed motherfucker pullin' shit! Damn!
YOLANDA
You're right, Fat Abbot. Thanks!
FAT ABBOT
No problem, ho. Maybe later you can suck my dick, bitch-ho! Shit!
BILL
Well, Fat Abbot and the gang sure done learned somethin' today. If you have a stepdad ridin' your ass, just snatch his ass in a bear trap. Grine! No more stepdad. See ya next time eatin' the pudding.
STAN
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy.
[Stan grabs paper and pencil and starts writing. That night, over at Cartman's clubhouse, the place is jumping, music is blaring, and a small crowd mills around. The long-haired teenager stands next to the radio for a moment, then passes out. Cartman brings a tray holding a box and bowl of Cheesy Poofs.]
OLDER KID
Hey, kid, give me some of those!
[Holding a beer bottle, he grabs some Cheesy Poofs and swallows them.]
[Cartman fights through the crowd to the teenage girls Kenny found.]
CARTMAN
Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare?
RUNAWAY GIRL 1
What? That game's for kids.
CARTMAN
This is bullcrap!
[Cartman throws up the tray and lets it fly everywhere, Randy, who is also at Cartman's clubhouse party is hanging out near a girl dancing in overalls.]
RANDY
Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party.
CARTMAN
This sucks, Kenny! I wish we'd never built a clubhouse!
[The music begins to build.]
PUNK
Mosh pit!
[Kenny stands alone in an open space in the crowd.]
KENNY
(Huh?)
[The crowd rushes to fill it in and stomps all over him, then disperses, revealing rats feasting on his corpse. The lyrics appropriately say, "Why don't you just pull a piece of me? Why catch some piece of me? Why does everybody want a piece of me?"]
CARTMAN
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
[Outside on the street in front of Cartman's house, Kyle happens to be passing by.]
KYLE
You bastard!
[Over at Stan's house. Sharon shouts for Stan to hear if he is home.]
SHARON
Stanley?! Your father is coming over for visitation! Stan?
[She sees the note he has written, which reads: Meet me in the clubhouse. She tosses the note onto the sofa and walks out. Roy enters the living room after she has left.]
ROY
Sharon? Sharon, have you seen my copy of Harper's?
[Roy sees the note and reads it aloud.]
ROY
Meet me at the clubhouse.
[Out inside Stan's clubhouse, Randy is sitting alone, Sharon climbs up and parts the curtain behind him.]
SHARON
Oh, Randy. What are you doing here?
[She climbs in and sits near him.]
RANDY
I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse.
SHARON
Oh I thought that note was for me.
RANDY
Oh, maybe it was.
[Sharon looks around, surveying Stan and Kyle's handiwork.]
SHARON
Well, it looks like our little Stanley has built himself quite a clubhouse here.
RANDY
I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse.
[A moment of awkward silence, then Sharon gets up and goes to leave.]
SHARON
Goodnight.
RANDY
Sharon?
SHARON
Yes?
[She turns back to face him.]
RANDY
Truth or Dare?
SHARON
It's too late for games.
[She comes back in and sits down.]
RANDY
No, I'm serious, please. Truth or Dare?
SHARON
Truth.
RANDY
Do you still love me?
SHARON
Oh, Randy, I do love you, but- now I'm so confused-uh. I'm living with Roy and-, I don't know how to break it off with him.
[Roy exits the house looking for Sharon.]
ROY
Sharon--
[Roy springs a trap.]
ROY
Guh-ow! Uh. Ey! Uh.
RANDY
Well, you never know. Maybe--
ROY
He-
RANDY
--thing will work out.
ROY
Hello?
SHARON
Maybe. I guess it's my turn. Truth or Dare?
ROY
Sharon?
RANDY
[Sensually.] Dare.
SHARON
Do me. Right here in the clubhouse.
[Randy pounces on her and they go at it.]
ROY
Hello? Hel-lo? Could- could somebody get me d-? Hello?
[Stan is holding the rope to the trap.]
STAN
Wow. Clubhouses are magical.
[The next day back at the clubhouse, Stan, Wendy, Bebe, and Clyde are there.]
BEBE
Okay. It's my turn. Stan? Truth or Dare?
[Stan is nervous, sweating, but willing. He looks at Wendy then at her lips.]
STAN
Dare.
[Wendy and Bebe whisper.]
BEBE
Take this stick and jam it up your peehole.
STAN
...What?!
WENDY
Wow, that sucks! Do you think it'll hurt?
[End of Clubhouses, Roy is still dangling from the tree outside.]
ROY
Hello? I sure am hungry. Anybody? It certainly does suck right here. Hello? Shuh- Sharon? Sharon, hello?
End of Clubhouses

synopsis:South Park's 14th Annual Cow Days rodeo and carnival is here, and the boys are determined to win Terrance and Phillip dolls. Meanwhile, the town's cows begin to worship a statue.

script:Cow Days

[A game show. The audience is applauding a couple onstage. The host and his assistant stand near the contestants.]
HOST
Well, Tom and Mary, you've made it to the final round. Are you ready to play for the grand prize?
TOM AND MARY
We're ready, Bob!
BOB
Any particular prize you're hoping for?
MARY
Well, Hawaii's nice, but Tahiti would be fun, too!
TOM
Oh, anywhere'd be great!
BOB
Polynesian diggities. I wish you luck. Here we go. What is the thin flap of skin that runs from the base of the penis to the scrotum?
[A 9 second count-down begins.]
TOM
Oh. Oh wait wait, I know this.
[Tom grips his head with both hands as time runs out.]
MARY
The upper vascular hood.
BOB
I'm sorry, but YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!
[Tom and Mary are overjoyed.]
BOB
Fred tell 'em what they've won.
FRED THE ANNOUNCER
Tom and Mary, put on your cowboy hats, because you're going to beautiful South Park, Colorado!
[A woman dressed as a cowgirl shows off a picture of the town. The audience oohs and aahs.]
MARY
Where?
FRED THE ANNOUNCER
That's right, just in time for Cows Days, the world's 45th biggest rodeo and carnival.
[A poster of Cow Days appears, then rotates to one of South Park. Scenes of the announcer's descriptions appear.]
FRED THE ANNOUNCER
Every fall, South Park celebrates Cow Days, and you're gonna be a part of it. You'll stay at the fabulous Super 7 hotel on Bernhardt Road, and enjoy festivities, including prizes, rides, and of course, the world-famous Running of the Cows!
[The audience Awww's as a group of cows is shown.]
FRED THE ANNOUNCER
Congratulations, Tom and Mary.
BOB
Well, Tom, Mary, you must be very excited.
TOM
What was second prize again?
BOB
That's all for now. See you tomorrow on...
[The audience joins him in saying.]
BOB AND AUDIENCE
Ooo, What The Hell Is That!
[The theme music plays before they cut to commercial.]
MARY
Ah shit!
[South Park rodeo. A rider falls from his horse as it jumps some barrels, nearby on the carnival stage, Mayor McDaniels and her aides are standing.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to kick off the 14th Annual South Park Cow Days!
[Cheers go up. Mayor McDaniels and her aides wear Cow Days buttons. Others wear Cow Days shirts and wave little flags with cow designs on them.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
As most of you know, Cow Days is when we all get together to celebrate and thank the noble, gentle cow.
[The crowd cheers wildly.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
And now, the chairman of Cow Days, Jimbo Kern!
[Jimbo walks up to the mic.]
JIMBO
This year is a very special Cow Days because we are revealing our all-new Cow Memorial!
[A giant curtain covers a large object.]
JIMBO
Which will live forever in South Park from this day forward. Release the curtain!
[The curtain comes down and a large statue of a cow is revealed. It's wooden, buddhaesque, in appearance, a dark gold color, with a large clock encased in its belly. The clock shows 1 p.m. The statue moos and the crowd cheers. Ned is at the front of the crowd, as are Tom and Mary.]
MARY
This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen!
TOM
Now, Mary, this is our only vacation for years. We have to make the best of it.
MARY
Oh you're right. I'm sorry, honey. We just need to stay positive.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Now get out to the carnival and enjoy the amazing rides and the wonderful games!
[The carnival gets underway. People mill around, the boys approach a booth that says "3 for $5".]
TOSS-A-BALL OPERATOR
Hey, come on over here, kids. Win fabulous prizes.
KYLE
Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
[A fanfare plays as a close-up of the dolls are shown.]
STAN
Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
KYLE
Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs.
OPERATOR
Sure they're real. They're even made in Canada.
STAN
Really?
OPERATOR
Yeah, look. They're even signed by Terrance and Phillip themselves.
[The operator shows the boys the tag, which reads
"TEЯENSE AND PHILLUP"]
CARTMAN
Wwow!
KYLE
Dude, that kicks ass!
CARTMAN
[Breathlessly.] Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play?
OPERATOR
Five dollars for three balls.
CARTMAN
Five dollars?! Jesus Christ!
OPERATOR
Don't worry, kid, it's easy. You just gotta put one ball through Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth.
[A wooden board featuring a photo of Jennifer Love Hewitt's face is shown, a gaping hole where her mouth should be.]
CARTMAN
That's easy!
OPERATOR
Okay, we've got a player!
CARTMAN
Ay! Check it out!
[He tosses a ball and misses, just to the right of the mouth.]
CARTMAN
Damn it!
OPERATOR
It's okay, son, you've still got two balls to try and get through her yapper.
CARTMAN
Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt!
[He chucks another ball at her, and misses.]
KYLE
You suck, Cartman!
CARTMAN
I'd like to see you do better!
KYLE
Give me that!
[Kyle takes the final ball from Cartman, and throws it. Direct hit, it goes into the mouth, but falls out and away.]
KYLE
Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!
OPERATOR
It's gotta go through her mouth.
KYLE
But ih-
OPERATOR
Sorry, kid, try again. Just five more dollars.
KYLE
Here, give me some money, Cartman!
[Cartman looks at him and starts laughing.]
KYLE
Lend me money, fat boy!
CARTMAN
I only have three dollars left, asshole!
KYLE
Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom.
[The boys walk off.]
JIMBO
[Still onstage.] Okay, everybody! It's time for the Running of the Cows!
[The crowd cheers. Kyle has found his parents.]
KYLE
Mom, give me some money!
SHEILA
Kyle, what are you doing here?! This is very dangerous!
KYLE
I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
SHEILA
Kyle, get back into the carnival this instant! You can't be out on the streets!
KYLE
I will if you give me money!
SHEILA
Okay, here!
[She hands him some bills, and he walks off.]
CARTMAN
Sweet.
[Back on stage, Jimbo gives more instructions to the crowd, which is still cheering.]
JIMBO
Okay, everybody, okay. Settle down. Now I know you're all anxious to get to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let me remind you: those brave souls who have decided to run against the cows through town do so at their own risk. I don't think I have to remind you that three people died in last year's Running of the Cows.
[The crowd pays no heed and keeps cheering.]
JIMBO
With that said, let's rock and roll!
[The crowd strains at the starting line. Halfy is there, too.]
JIMBO
Everybody ready to run? Release the cows!
[The corral doors open, but not a cow moves. The crowd rushes forth.]
JIMBO
They're loose!
[Jimbo leaves the stage, the cows look bewildered at the townsfolk.]
COWS
Mooooo?!
[The townsfolk scream wildly, while the cows remain in the corral and moo some more. Ned runs directly into a telephone pole and falls.]
NED
Ow.
[One cow timidly leaves the corral. A townsman looks back as he runs, and finds himself impaled on the lower half of a shattered phone pole.]
JIMBO
[Running by.] Yeehaw!
[A red heifer chews on some grass just outside the corral. A man comes and tries to provoke a grazing cow, but the cow ignores him. The man shakes his ass at the cow, then runs away screaming.]
[Back at the carnival, a ride named "Chamber of Farts" stands near a Ferris wheel. Its entrance consists of a huge lavender ass with doors through which the cars enter.]
KYLE
Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.
CARTMAN
I only need one, dude. I only need one.
OPERATOR
Come one, come all. Get in line now, for the Chamber of Farts.
STAN
What's that?
OPERATOR
Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
CARTMAN
How much is it?
OPERATOR
Just three tickets, boys.
CHAMBER OF FARTS RIDE
Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
KYLE
Is it like a- haunted house or something?
OPERATOR
Sure. It's veery scary.
CARTMAN
Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five.
KYLE
No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
CARTMAN
Oh come on, you guys. We'll still have plenty of money left over.
KYLE
You'd better be right, dude.
CARTMAN
I'm right!
[The boys step up to the ride and car 15 comes to them. They get in.]
OPERATOR
Keep your hands inside at all times.
KYLE
Okay.
[They go in. They pass through a cemetery with asses everywhere. A man has his pants down just enough for his ass to poke through, a dog next to him has its tail up, there are flying asses about, and some volcanoes poke through the ground. All are farting. The car stops.]
CHAMBER OF FARTS RIDE
So, the Chamber of Farts has another victim, eh? Don't be afraid. There aren't any ghouls here, only FARTS!
[The car starts up again, and Cartman gets a dose of farts from an ass jet.]
CARTMAN
Eh! God-damnit!
[As they enter the Hall of Farts, a wailing fart is heard from two figures hanging from spider webs.]
STAN
What the hell was that?
CHAMBER OF FARTS RIDE
Perhaps you need some MORE FARTS!
[The car heads for a woman stretched out in torture. A weak fart escapes from her. The car leaves the Gas Caverns.]
OPERATOR
All right, boys. Ride's over.
KYLE
That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!
STAN
Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
CARTMAN
[As they step down.] I don't know what you guys are talking about! That scared the crap out of me!
KYLE
That was a waste of money, Cartman!
OPERATOR
Hey, if you guys want a great ride, get in this line. It's only seven tickets.
KYLE
We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.
CARTMAN
Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money.
[Cartman is down to $11.00, as he goes to get in line for the ride.]
CARTMAN
Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet!
[The Cow Memorial, 12:59 p.m. A cow comes to look at the statue, and the clock strikes 1 p.m. The statue moos. The cow looks around, then moos. Two more cows arrive. In the other area of the carnival, the boys are nearing the end of the line for the ride.]
KYLE
This ride better be good!
STAN
Yeah, this line is way too long!
CARTMAN
I think we're almost to the end.
KYLE
We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!
STAN
Here we go.
[The boys pass under a banner that reads
"LINE RIDE"]
KYLE
Finally!
LINE RIDE OPERATOR
Did ya enjoy the ride?
STAN
What ride?
KYLE
Yeah.
LINE RIDE OPERATOR
This was the Line Ride, a real live simulator of a long line.
KYLE
Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me!
LINE RIDE OPERATOR
That's five tickets, thank you very much.
[The boys leave with $6.00 remaining.]
LINE RIDE OPERATOR
Come see us again soon.
STAN
My ass we will!
KYLE
Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!
STAN
Yeah, let's not ride that ride again.
PHOTO SELLER
Would you like to buy a photo of you boys enjoying the Line Ride?
[They are shown the picture.]
CARTMAN
How much?
PHOTO SELLER
Just three dollars.
CARTMAN
Hunh that's, that's pretty sweet.
[They are now left with $3.00.]
KYLE
You dumbass, Cartman!
CARTMAN
What? This is cool.
KYLE
No, it's not cool!
CARTMAN
It is, too!
[They head back over to the Toss-A-Ball.]
OPERATOR
Can I help you boys.
STAN
We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.
OPERATOR
O-kay, five dollars for three balls.
KYLE
How much do we have left, Cartman?
[Cartman leafs through the bills, but doesn't answer.]
KYLE
How much do we have left, Cartman?!
CARTMAN
Aah, three dollars.
KYLE
What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Yeah, but I didn't take into account the fact that I suck at math.
KYLE
You son of a bitch! Aaargh!
[Kyle lunges at Cartman, and they fall to the ground, wrestling.]
CARTMAN
Ey! Seriously!
[A view of the carnival. After a while the boys calm down and stand up again.]
KYLE
Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
CARTMAN
Well, I'm sorry!
KYLE
Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?
CARTMAN
[Thinks a moment.] Hey! I bet Kenny has some food stamps on him!
KENNY
[Pulls some out.] (What? These?)
STAN
Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?
OPERATOR
Sure, as long as they're good.
KYLE
Give him your food stamps, Kenny!
KENNY
(Nuh uh.)
KYLE
Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!
KENNY
(Dude, these are my fucking food stamps! How am I going to eat without all these food stamps?)
CARTMAN
Damn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp hog! Share with the rest of your friends!
[Kenny hands them to the operator, and Kyle receives the balls.]
KYLE
Okay. Here we go.
[Kyle chucks the first ball directly into Jennifer's mouth, but it bounces away.]
KYLE
Hey! That was right on target.
OPERATOR
Sorry, kid. Try again.
[Kyle throws the next ball in, again directly on target, but it too bounces away.]
KYLE
That does it! Shenanigans!
[He points an accusing finger at the operator, then turns around.]
KYLE
SHENANIGANS!
OPERATOR
Uhwhat are you doing?
KYLE
I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!
OPERATOR
Shenanigans?
OFFICER BARBRADY
What's all the hoo-ha?
KYLE
Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Why?
KYLE
This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!
OFFICER BARBRADY
If that is true, then your declaration of Shenanigans is just.
[Barbrady raises his baton and points it at the operator.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
What do you have to say, carnival operator?
OPERATOR
Look, the kid was really close. He still has another ball left. Leh let's try again, son.
[The operator reaches inside the counter and switches balls to give Kyle a smaller one.]
OPERATOR
Here you go.
[Kyle tosses it, and it soars through the mouth.]
OPERATOR
There, you see? We have a winner!
KYLE
It worked!
OFFICER BARBRADY
Young man, you can't just go declaring Shenanigans on innocent people! That's how wars get started!
STAN
Sorry, Officer Buttbaby.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Barbrady!
STAN
Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say?
OFFICER BARBRADY
You said Buttbaby.
[The boys start laughing after a few seconds.]
CARTMAN
Sweet.
OPERATOR
Okay, kid, you won. You get to pick between the Barbie Pocket Mirror and the Bon Jovi Toothpick.
KYLE
No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.
OPERATOR
Oh, nonono, you gotta win seven times to earn those.
KYLE
What?!
OPERATOR
You win seven Bon Jovi toothpicks, then you can trade 'em in for the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
KYLE
You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-
OPERATOR
[Ignoring them, speaking to the crowd] Step on up, just five dollars to play!
KYLE
Damnit, I have to have those dolls!
[He walks off pissed. The others follow.]
STAN
This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.
KYLE
[Something stops him.] Wait a minute! I've got it! The bull-riding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5,000.
[The boys look at him.]
KYLE
Think about it, dude: $5,000. That's 1,000 set of balls. That's 3,000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!
CARTMAN
What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull?
KYLE
[Grabbing Cartman by the collar.] Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fucking head open!
CARTMAN
O-kay, I'll get on the bull.
KYLE
All right! Now, come on! We have to practice!
[Kyle walks away. The others watch him.]
STAN
[To Cartman.] He really wants those dolls.
CARTMAN
I guess, damn!
[Tom and Mary have just exited the Chamber of Farts on car 11.]
MARY
That ride wasn't very good.
TOM
Now, Mary, you promised me we'd try to have a good time.
MARY
You're right. I'm sorry, honey, I'll try and have a good time.
[The Cow Memorial. The clock now reads 1:59 p.m., and seven cows stand before the memorial. Two o'clock strikes, and the statue moos twice. The cows answer with two moos of their own. More cows arrive. Meanwhile, at a nearby bar.]
STAN
Alright, this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman.
CARTMAN
Hey, this is sweet.
KYLE
You gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?
CARTMAN
I'll try. Ten seconds is a long time.
STAN
We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go.
[Kenny presses the switch, and the mechanical bull starts to move.]
CARTMAN
Ye-gah!
[The bull throws him off, and he lands in a Zoomin' Pinball machine, face up.]
CARTMAN
Ow!
[Cartman shattered the glass, which scatters all around.]
CARTMAN
Son of a bitch!
STAN
How long was that?
KYLE
That wasn't quite ten seconds.
STAN
Damn it!
[They all walk over to Cartman.]
STAN
That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that.
CARTMAN
[Whispering.] You guys, eh seriously, my back!
KYLE
Get back on, fat-ass! You have to practice!
CARTMAN
[Whispering.] Seriously. Help.
[None of the boys step forth to help him.]
CARTMAN
Screw you guys. Hate you guys.
KYLE
What'd you say, Cartman??
CARTMAN
[Whispering.] I hate you guys!
KYLE
I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.
CARTMAN
[Whispering.] Hate you guys.
[The cows are now pushing the memorial across open fields. It now reads 3 p.m.]
[Elsewhere, the boys stand next to a rancher who has offered his bull for Cartman to practice on.]
RANCHER
Be careful with old Bob here. He ain't much for a-ridin' anymore, but he's all I got.
KYLE
Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull.
RANCHER
Well, have fun, boys.
KYLE
Okay, Cartman. You ready?
CARTMAN
[Hesitantly.] Nnoo.
KYLE
Open the gate!
[Kenny opens it. The bull stands there, then walks out slowly and turns left.]
CARTMAN
All right, get down. This is my kind of bull-ride.
KYLE
[Whispers to Stan.] That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!
CARTMAN
Yeah, this is sweet!
STAN
What are you going to do?
KYLE
Hit the bull in the balls with a snowball.
STAN
Oh, yeah. That's a good idea.
[Kyle chucks a snowball at the bull's testicles and gets a direct hit. The bull starts bucking, pissed off.]
CARTMAN
Eeyy!
KYLE
That's better.
STAN
Hold on, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Ey! Seriously, you guys! Do something! Dude, stop this crazy thing!
[The bull throws him off.]
CARTMAN
Mother f-
[Before he can finish, he is thrust into the snow in front of them.]
KYLE
Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough!
[No response.]
STAN
Come on, Cartman.
[No response.]
KENNY
(Oh my God, they've killed Cartman!)
KYLE
No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!
[Kyle kicks Cartman.]
KYLE
Get up!
[Kyle waits a moment, then kicks him again.]
KYLE
Get UP!
[Cartman stirs, then stands up. He's pale.]
STAN
You okay, dude?
[Cartman says nothing, he sees everything undulate and hears Stan's voice echo.]
STAN
Cartman, hello? Hel-lo?
KYLE
Dude, I think we broke him.
[Later, at Hell's Pass Hospital, in the waiting area.]
DR. DOCTOR
Boys, I'm afraid your fat little friend has suffered head trauma.
STAN
What's the matter with him.
DR. DOCTOR
Well, apparently, he thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute named Ming Li.
KYLE
..Oh.
STAN
But can he still ride a bull?
DR. DOCTOR
What?
KYLE
We need him to win a bull-riding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?
DR. DOCTOR
No, boys! You need to take him home and let him get plenty of sleep.
[Dr. Doctor turns and walks away.]
KYLE
Damn it!
[Now in Cartman's room.]
STAN
Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me?
CARTMAN
Bân xưa, Lee bân xưa!
(rough translation: Old friends, Lee old friends!)
STAN
What?!
CARTMAN
Boyongture taur lur mahrter.
STAN
Oh, he's fine, dude.
KYLE
You think?
CARTMAN
Shunkarah puntaur lah-turi.
STAN
Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo.
[Back at the festivities, the Running of the Cows has ended, and Jimbo is onstage.]
JIMBO
All right, damn it! We're not going to stand for this! Now, whoever stole our golden cow memorial, we're gonna find you and kill you!
[The crowd stands silent.]
JIMBO
Aall right, uhow about this? Whoever took the sacred cow, just please return 'im, and there'll be no questions asked.
[Nothing. Jimbo now looks around.]
JIMBO
Wait a minute. You folks from out of town. You're the only ones with a reason to take our beloved cow memorial!
[People in the crowd start buzzing, as Officer Barbrady approaches Tom and Mary from behind.]
MARY
Where are we going to put a 60-foot tall statue of a cow?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh, I think maybe you'll answer that downtown, tourists.
[Officer Barbrady cuffs them both and takes them away.]
MARY
Oh my God!
[At the carnival, the boys have returned with Cartman.]
STAN
How's he doing?
KYLE
He still thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute.
CARTMAN
Pooinshower. Madalen shine debaur. Huelar she mashartah me shur har.
STAN
Do you think he can ride the bull?
KYLE
Yeah, I think so.
STAN
Cool.
[The boys pass by a man in uniform, and his wife.]
CARTMAN
Hello. Hello, polie. Hello, polie hurrah you soldier boy. Hey, soldier boy!
SOLDIER
Huh?
CARTMAN
Hello? Soldier boy. Me so horny. Me love you long time.
SOLDIER
Go away, kid. You're grossing me out.
CARTMAN
Hello, puhree! Puhree hello! Hello, sucky-sucky! Hello, puhree!
SOLDIER
Beat it, kid! Come on, honey.
[They walk away, an announcement over the loudspeaker gets the attention of carnival-goers.]
CHAMBER OF FARTS OPERATOR
Come one, come all! The Chamber of Farts has been fixed and is reopen!
[A crowd rushes to it, and Cartman is lost among the mass of people.]
STAN
Jesus, dude!
KYLE
Hey, where's Cartman?
STAN
Oh, hell!
KENNY
(I don't know where he went!)
STAN
Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride.
KENNY
(Okay.)
[South Park Police Dept. Tom and Mary are still in jail, shivering and seemingly forgotten.]
TOM
Hoh, it's so cold here.
MARY
Where is that sheriff?! We need water!
TOM
Oh well, let's try to make the best of it, Mary.
MARY
You're right. We're not being positive. At least we get some time alone.
TOM
Yeah, and at least we've got our health.
[A rat runs by.]
[Over at a ranch, two ranchers get out of a truck and walk into a field.]
GREY HAT
I tell you, Mitchell, I ain't never seen nothin' like it.
MITCHELL
Where are they again?
GREY HAT
Just right up over this ridge.
[The ranchers reach the top of the ridge and look out over a large field full of cows gathered around the Cow Memorial, mooing. It is almost 9 a.m.]
GREY HAT
That's what they've been doin' all morning, just sittin' there and mooin'. And more cows come all the time.
MITCHELL
Well, I ain't never seen this before, neither. But I know one thing, when cows start gettin' together, it can't be good. They might start formin' a cult!
GREY HAT
[Ponders] Hmm. Cow cult.
[Back at the carnival, rodeo riders test their skill. One of them loses when his horse throws him off.]
ANNOUNCER
The grand-daddy of 'em all, the South Park Cow Days Rodeo! Let's begin the bull-riding event. Grand prize: $5000!
STAN
Kenny, where the hell is Cartman?!
KENNY
(I don't know, can't find him.)
KYLE
He's up in, like, twenty minutes!
KENNY
(I know, I know!)
CARTMAN
[Off-camera.] Hello, prease! Hello!
STAN
[Points to him.] There he is!
[Cartman emerges from the crowd, now wearing a hot-pink two piece outfit, orange blush, and an oriental wig.]
CARTMAN
Fucky-sucky, five dorrah.
[Back at the police station, Tom and Mary still sit and wait.]
[Back on the hill, Jimbo and Ned have joined the two ranchers.]
GREY HAT
Here they are, just like we told you.
[Jimbo has had enough of the Cows' shenanigans.]
JIMBO
Okay, that's enough-a that! You cows need to dis-perse! All right, bad cows! Do you hear me? Bad cows!
[The cows are unphased.]
JIMBO
All right, Ned. You're gonna have to bust out the whip!
[Ned lashes out his whip which makes a loud crack.]
NED
Mmmm-gahyah! Git along, little doggies!
[He lashes out again and makes contact with a cow, this causes the herd to move in on him.]
NED
Bad cows stay! Stay!
[The cows are pissed. They rush in and trample him into the ground.]
NED
AAAAAH!
JIMBO
Holy crow! Play dead, Ned!
GREY HAT
[Still on the ridge, casually.] I reckon we should get some help.
MITCHELL
I reckon.
[Back at the rodeo, the boys have Cartman on the bull, ready to ride.]
KYLE
Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake.
STAN
Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!
CARTMAN
Fucky-sucky five dollah.
ANNOUNCER
Up first, No. 24, Jack McMack!
[The crowd cheers, and he removes his hat in appreciation.]
ANNOUNCER
Three, two, one.
[The the gate opens and Jack goes forth.]
JACK
Yeehaw! Yehoo! Yeehaw!
[The bull finally throws him off. The crowd is silent and watches him sail through the air.]
JACK
Aaaaaaaa!
[He lands, gored by another bull's horns, and dies.]
ANNOUNCER
Oooh, that's gonna cost him a point deduction. Up next, number 14, Ming Li!
CARTMAN
Ten dollar? Eight dollar? You give me eight dollar, soldier boy!
ANNOUNCER
Here we go!
STAN
Dude, I'm having second thoughts about this.
KYLE
What do you mean?
STAN
I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull.
ANNOUNCER
Let her go!
[The gate thrusts open, and "Ming Li" goes forth.]
CARTMAN
Eey! Freline furton! Sucky-sucky!
KYLE
Hang on, Cartman!
ANNOUNCER
Wow, and this Vietnamese prostitute can really ride a bull!
[Frank Hammond, his, partner, looks bored.]
ANNOUNCER
I guess she's had a lot of practice, if you know what I mean.
[Frank Hammond simply blinks.]
CARTMAN
Aaah! Ten dorrah!
[Still riding the bull, the crowd cheers on.]
CARTMAN
Ten dollah, soldier boy!
ANNOUNCER
She's setting a new world record!
[The crowd jumping up and down begin to chant.]
CROWD
Ming Li! Ming Li! Ming Li!
[The bull finally bucks Cartman off.]
CARTMAN
Gaaah!
[He ends up in the snow, where the bull comes and kicks him like a football.]
CARTMAN
Heeee!
STAN
Dude, that bull's gonna kill him.
KYLE
Go help him, Kenny!
[Kenny starts to climb over the fencing into the ring but has second thoughts.]
KENNY
(Huh-uh, I ain't gonna get inside that ring! Aaah!)
[The bull runs through the fence and away, taking Kenny with him. Stan and Kyle watch Kenny disappear.]
STAN
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
KYLE
You bastards!
[A rodeo clown picks Cartman up and carries him off.]
ANNOUNCER
And this brave little whore from the East has really put on a show for us today!
[His partner, rather disgusted, taps his mic until it falls.]
ANNOUNCER
The winner of the bull-riding contest, Ming Li!
[The rodeo clown places Cartman in a barrel.]
CARTMAN
Hey, sucky-sucky? Only ten dollar.
STAN
We did it, dude, we did it!
[Kyle smiles. Elsewhere, the cows are gathered again before the Memorial, about 3 p.m. Behind some large rocks, FBI agents pop up and take aim at the cows.]
AGENT
Freeze, cows!
[The cows look up, startled.]
AGENT
The game is over! You will now return to your respective towns!
[Jimbo stands next to the agent. The cows ignore them.]
JIMBO
You hear that, cows? You're surrounded! There's no way out!
AGENT
You will now all march in an orderly fashion into this trailer!
[Ned opens the back door to the trailer.]
AGENT
Move!
[The cows just look at them, then one of them walks forward and turns left, walking away.]
JIMBO
Hey. Where's she going? That's the wrong way, you stupid cow!
[The cow walks to the edge of a cliff and looks back at them.]
AGENT
Oh, dear Jesus, no!
[The cow walks off the cliff, where it falls to its death.]
COW
Mooooo!
JIMBO
Nnoo!
[The other cows reach the cliff and walk off, one by one.]
JIMBO
They're killing themselves! Stop! Please! Can't we do anything?! Oh, God, the humanity, Ned! The humanity!
[Jimbo weeps into his hands.]
AGENT
This is the first mass cow suicide I've seen in- at least eight months.
[South Park Police Station, Tom and Mary still wait in jail. Back at the carnival, the boys walk over to the Toss-A-Ball.]
TOSS-A-BALL OPERATOR
Oh, you boys are back again, huh?
STAN
Yeah. And we have $5000 this time.
KYLE
How many ball does that get us?
CARTMAN
[Still Ming Li.] Odline daur shunba shunba?
TOSS-A-BALL OPERATOR
Aw I ah- I tell you what, boys. Uh, I'm gonna be really nice and just- trade you the 5000 for the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
KYLE
You will?
STAN
Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden?
[The operator starts tossing down the dolls.]
KYLE
We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
CARTMAN
Ten dollah? Sucky-sucky?
KYLE
What are we gonna do with them?
[Stan begins to answer but before he can, the head of the Terrance doll which he is holding simply falls off.]
STAN
We should-
[He looks down with Kyle at the head on the ground, horrified.]
KYLE
..What the-?
STAN
Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs!
[One of the Phillip doll's legs falls off.]
KYLE
After all that?! Shenanigans! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS!
[Officer Barbrady, Mr. Garrison, and a small crowd show up.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
What's all this?
KYLE
Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!
MR. GARRISON
You know, uh, excuse me, but I agree. These rides are really stupid! Chamber of Farts isn't scary at all!
FATHER MAXI
Yeah, and the food is terrible!
CHAMBER OF FARTS OPERATOR
Hey, it's just a stupid rodeo! What do you expect?
[Everyone starts arguing all at once, except Barbrady and the boys.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Ho-kay okay, let's calm down. People of South Park, do you declare Shenanigans on the carnival people?
TOWNSPEOPLE
Yeah!
OFFICER BARBRADY
Okay, carnival people, do you accept this decree of Shenanigans?
LINE RIDE OPERATOR
..What the hell are you talking about?! This whole town is screwy!
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, that settles it! Everybody grab a broom, it's Shenanigans!
[The town cheers, and some of the folks have brooms already. They gang up on the carnival people and beat them all for a long time. Stan and Kyle just watch.]
[One in the afternoon. Jimbo, Ned, and some townsfolk are pushing the Cow Memorial back into the carnival area.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
You found it! You found the memorial!
JIMBO
Yeah.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
And the cows? Are they all back, too?
JIMBO
They're dead, mayor. They're all dead. [Sobs.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
What?!
JIMBO
Oho, it was awful! [Weeps.] Cow after cow taking its own life, and we could do nothing to stop them! Oh, God!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Well, perhaps, one day, cows will learn that cults are never a good thing.
JIMBO
[Still sad.] I hope so, Mayor. I hope so. God I need a cold beer and a burger.
[Jimbo hears the commotion from the nearby crowd and perks up.]
JIMBO
What's all the ruckus over there?
[He sees the townsfolk beating on the carnival people.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Sounds like somebody declared Shenanigans!
JIMBO
Oh, hell, I have to run home and get my broom!
[Back at the police station.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
All right, you damned carnival people. Into jail with- [Voice wavering.] Oooooh?
[Officer Barbrady notices the remains of Tom and Mary, who are no more. They've died of starvation and the rats have begun eating parts of them.]
JIMBO
Hey, aren't those the people we at first thought took the wooden cow?
OFFICER BARBRADY
[Nervously.] Yeah.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Didn't we ever release them?
JIMBO
Aw, I forgot all about 'em.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Uh me, too.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Oh my God! Officer Barbrady, ugh, you never had Tom and Mary in this cell.
OFFICER BARBRADY
I didn't?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
No, no. In fact, they never came to South Park. We've never heard of them.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Ooh, phew, I feel a lot better, then, although I could've swore that I had heard of them and they starved to death in my prison.
[The bus stop. Stan and Kyle are swimming in Terrance and Phillip dolls.]
STAN
[With a Terrance doll.] Say, Terrance, let's look for treasuh.
KYLE
[With a Phillip doll.] Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh.
CARTMAN
[Arrives, back to normal.] What are you guys doing?
STAN
Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling?
CARTMAN
Oh, pretty good, except I had the weirdest dream last night.
KYLE
Really? What about?
CARTMAN
Well, I dreamt that I was a poor Vietnamese girl, and then you guys made me ride a big, scary bull, and then Leonardo DiCaprio gave me a spankin' for several hours.
[He notices the Terrance and Phillip dolls.]
CARTMAN
Hey, where did you guys win all those Terrance and Phillip dolls?
STAN
Oh-h. Nowhere.
[Stan and Kyle start giggling.]
CARTMAN
Wait a minute! You guys did make me ride that bull!
KYLE
No! Cartman, that was just a dream!
[A limousine pulls up and Leonardo DiCaprio is at the window.]
LEONARDO DICAPRIO
Bye, Ming Li. Thanks again.
[Stan and Kyle laugh even harder, as the limo drives off.]
CARTMAN
Oh! Son of a bitch!
End of Cow Days


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:After a huge loss in court, Chef is left penniless. The boys gather some very famous and talented people in the music industry who want to help their old friend.

script:Chef Aid

[South Park Elementary Cafeteria. While the boys wait in line for their lunches.]
CARTMAN
[Singing.]
Stinky britches,
you got stinky britches
Stinky, stinky britches,
you got stinky--
KYLE
What the hell are you singing, Cartman?
CARTMAN
This new song by Alanis Morissette. I can’t get it out of my head.
Stinky britches,
you got stinky britches
MR. GARRISON
[Passes by.] Hello, children. Ready for lunch?
CARTMAN
Stinky britches,
you got stinky,
stinky--
MR. GARRISON
Eric, is there a problem?
CARTMAN
Yeah, I can’t get this stupid song out of my head.
MR. GARRISON
"Stinky Britches" by Alanis Morissette?
CARTMAN
Yeah.
Stinky,
stinky britches
MR. GARRISON
Children, did you say hi to Mr. Twig?
MR. TWIG
Hi, boys. How are you?
KYLE
When is Mr. Hat coming back?
MR. GARRISON
[Pause.] I told you never say his name in my presence.
STAN
But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.
KID
Yeah.
CARTMAN
[Quietly to himself.]
Stinky britches,
you got stinky--
MR. GARRISON
It just so happens that Mr. Twig is far more stable than Mr. Hat could ever be, so he's the better puppet now--
KYLE
He'd be better used as a coat rack.
[Students begin laughing at a dismayed, offended Garrison.]
MR. GARRISON
[Livid.] How dare you! Come on, Mr. Twig.
[Mr. Garrison walks off as the boys enter the kitchen.]
CHEF
Hello there, children.
BOYS
Hey, Chef.
CARTMAN
You got stinky britches,
stinky--
CHEF
What did you say?
KYLE
He singing some new hit song.
CHEF
Eric, where did you hear that song?
CARTMAN
It’s all over the place. On the radio, MTV, everywhere.
CHEF
[Softly.] Well, I'll be sodomized on Christmas.
STAN
What, dude?
CHEF
Children, I wrote that song 20 years ago.
CARTMAN
You wrote it?
CHEF
Yeah. Back when I used to be in the rock business. And now it looks like some big record company has published one of my songs.
KYLE
Wow, then you should get money for it!
CHEF
Aww, I don't want any money. I just like to see my name on the credits, that's all.
KYLE
Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time.
CHEF
Well, all right. Maybe I will go. I’ll play them my version of the song.
[Capitalist Records, California. Chef is playing his song for the record producer.]
CHEF (RECORDING)
Stinky britches,
you got those stinky britches.
CHEF
So you see, Mr. Big record producer, "Stinky Britches" was something I wrote several years ago.
MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
Hmm… I really so no resemblance between that song and "Stinky Britches" by our artist, Alanis Morissette.
CHEF
Huh?
KYLE
It’s the same goddamn song!
CHEF
Now, look, I’m trying to be cool about this, but you just can't rip people's music off! It's against the law!
MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
I am above the law!
[His hair falls forward, and he quickly puts it back into place with Spooge hair gel.]
MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
Mr. Chef, I’m afraid you leave me no alternative. We’re going to sue you.
CHEF
Sue me?! You stole one of my songs, and you’re gonna sue me?
MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
Yes. I suggest you get a real good lawyer. We’ll have the best in the business.
KYLE
We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer!
CARTMAN
Yeah, and he’s Jewish.
[Mr. Garrison's house, Garrison is watching Alanis Morissette's Stinky Britches music video.]
ALANIS MORISSETTE
Stinky,
stinky britches,
stinky britches
[A clattering noise is heard.]
MR. GARRISON
Mr. Twig, is that you?
[Mr. Garrison turns off the TV and goes to the kitchen.]
MR. GARRISON
Mis-Mr. Twig?
[He sees a pot of boiling water and approaches it, then lifts the lid. Mr. Twig is floating around, charred.]
MR. GARRISON
Aagghh!! Mr. Twig! No!
[He throws the pot to the floor.]
MR. GARRISON
Who did this to you, Mr. Twig?! Who?!
[Courthouse, Gerald Broflovski is representing the defense, Chef.]
GERALD
Now, just let me do all the talking, Chef. We’re gonna bring these bastards down.
CHEF
Right.
[Judge Moses bangs his gavel.]
JUDGE MOSES
This court is now in session. Who's representing the defense?
GERALD
I am, Your Honor. Gerald Broflovski.
JUDGE MOSES
And representing the prosecution?
PROSECUTOR
I am, Your Honor.
[The Prosecutor is none other that Johnnie Cochran, the spectators gasp at this turn of events.]
GERALD
Uh-oh.
CHEF
Why "uh-oh"?
GERALD
Chef, that's Johnnie Cochran. He's the guy who knocked O.J. off.
CHEF
Uh-oh.
[Meanwhile at Hell's Pass Hospital, Mr. Garrison bursts through the doors of the ER holding Mr. Twig in a blanket.]
MR. GARRISON
I need some help over here! Please help! I think he's got third-degree burns!
[Dr. Doctor and his team turn to him, then rush over. The patient sits up and looks.]
DR. DOCTOR
Give the child to me.
[Dr. Doctor takes the bundle and unfurls the blanket. The doctors draw close to look at Mr. Twig.]
MR. GARRISON
[Panicked.] Is he going to be all right, doctor?
DR. DOCTOR
Uhhh...
MR. GARRISON
Is he going to live?
DR. DOCTOR
[Slowly.] It's a stick.
MR. GARRISON
...Dammit, don't give me that medical jargon! Just tell me straight, is he going to be okay?!
[Over at Cartman's house, the boys are watching the trial on television.]
REPORTER
And so on this 15th day of what is considered to be the most important trial of the...day, Johnnie Cochran has appeared to defend Capitalist Records. The question now is, will Cochran use his famous "Chewbacca defense"?
CARTMAN
What's a "Chewbacca defense"?
KYLE
I don't know.
STAN
That's what Cochran used in the O.J. Simpson trial.
CARTMAN
Goddamn, I hate that Cochran guy! If he was in front of me, I'd be like, "Hey! You stupid son of a bitch! You-- How... How'd you like me to kick you in the nuts?!"
KYLE
I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman.
[In the courtroom.]
GERALD
...And so, in summation, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the version of my client's song recorded over twenty years ago. You've heard the exact same song produced by those cheats in the past month. I'd say it's pretty much an open-and-shut case. Make the right decision. Thank you.
[One person claps. Gerald goes back to his table.]
GERALD
[To Chef] We've got 'em.
[Chef grins and gives him a thumbs-up. Judge Moses bangs his gavel.]
JUDGE MOSES
Mr. Johnnie Cochran, your closing arguments.
JOHNNIE COCHRAN
Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, Chef's attorney would certainly want you to believe that his client wrote "Stinky Britches" ten years ago, and they make a good case... hell, I almost felt pity myself. But, ladies and gentlemen, of this supposed jury, I have one, final thing I want you to consider.
[Johnnie Cochran walks to a display stand and pulls down the screen.]
JOHNNIE COCHRAN
Ladies and gentleman, this is Chewbacca. Chewbacca is a Wookie from the planet Kashyyyk. But Chewbacca lives on the planet Endor. Now think about that. That does not make sense.
GERALD
Dammit..!
CHEF
What?
GERALD
He’s using the Chewbacca defense.
JOHNNIE COCHRAN
Why would a Wookiee, an 8-foot-tall Wookiee, want to live on Endor with a bunch of 2-foot-tall Ewoks? That does not make sense! But more important, you have to ask yourself: "What does this have to do with this case?" Nothing.
[Gerald buries his head in his hands, defeated.]
JOHNNIE COCHRAN
Ladies and gentlemen, it has nothing to do with this case! It does not make sense! Look at me, I'm a lawyer defending a major record company, and I'm talkin' about Chewbacca. Does that make sense? Ladies and gentlemen, I am not making any sense! None of this makes sense! And so you have to remember, when you're in that jury room deliberating and conjugating the Emancipation Proclamation... does it make sense? No! Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, it does not make sense! If Chewbacca lives on Endor, you must acquit! The defense rests.
JUDGE MOSES
[After a long pause.] O-kay, then.
[Back at Cartman's house where the boys are watching.]
CARTMAN
Wow, he’s good.
REPORTER
In a teary-eyed courtroom, Johnnie Cochran has just finished his closing arguments, and, as anticipated, he did use the Chewbacca defense.
[Courtroom sketches show an angry Chef staring at Gerald, Judge Moses holding his gavel, and Cochran in clown-like attire pointing left.]
REPORTER
Whether or it worked... is up to the jury to decide.
[Back in the courtroom.]
JUDGE MOSES
How find you the jury?
FOREMAN
We find the defendant, Jerome "Chef" McElroy... guilty as charged.
[The spectators gasp again.]
GERALD
Whoops.
CHEF
Whoops?!
JUDGE MOSES
Mr. Chef, you have been found guilty of harassing a major company label. The full fee of two million dollars will be handed over within 24 hours.
CHEF
Do I look like I have two million?
JUDGE MOSES
Well, you have 24 hours to find it, or else you have to go to jail. For eight million years.
[Chef is shocked. The bailiff whispers into the Judge's ear.]
BAILIFF
Uh, it's actually for four years.
JUDGE MOSES
Oh, sorry. You'll got to jail for four years.
CHEF
This can't be happening..!
[Cartman's house. All four boys are shocked at the verdict.]
STAN
Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail.
[Chef's residence. Everything is being repossessed. Chef is leafing through a "Memories" photo album. Mr. Big record producer enters.]
MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
And that chair, too. I want that chair.
CHEF
Hey, that's my favorite chair!
MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
You heard the judge. Since you lost the case, I can seize whatever I want to pay my legal fees. Yeah, take that water cooler, too.
STAN
Hello there, Chef.
CHEF
Hey, children.
KYLE
What's going on?
CHEF
Children, that record company guy is takin' all my belongings. And if I don't come up with two million, I'm going to jail.
STAN
Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up.
KYLE
Yeah. Ready, Cartman?
CARTMAN
Ready.
[Cartman removes his jacket and steps forward, in lederhosen. Oompa music plays.]
CARTMAN
I will do the German dance for you
It's fun and gay and tra-la-la
I hope my will enjoy my dance
Fiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ay
Would you like some sauerkraut,
German boy,
German boy?
Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut--
CHEF
Okay, okay, children, thank you very much. I feel much better.
STAN
You do?
CHEF
Sure. Just please stop.
CARTMAN
[Putting his coat back on.] See? I told you guys it would work.
KYLE
What's that, dude?
CHEF
This? This is my photo album of all my times in the rock business.
KYLE
Did you ever know any famous people?
CHEF
Did I? Janis Joplin, The Beatles, Elton John... I got to travel all around the world, hanging out with bands, going to lavish parties, lovin' many, many women.
[One photograph shows Chef laying shirtless on a bed of hay in a lucrative position, with a goat standing next to him. The caption under it reads, "Germany".]
CARTMAN
What's that?
CHEF
Nothing.
[Chef quickly turns the page.]
CHEF
Anyway--
MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
Take this, too.
[Mr. Big record producer takes Chef's photo album.]
CHEF
Hey! That has no monetary value! What the hell are you taking that for?!
MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
I can take whatever I want.
CHEF
But I have 24 hours to come up with your money! That's the law!
MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
I am above the law!
[Mr. Big record producer's hair falls in his face again. He smears it back up with more Spooge.]
MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
I told you not to mess with me.
CHEF
That does it. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna raise that two million, but I'm not going to use it to pay you back. I'm going to use it to hire Johnnie Cochran myself and sue you!
MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
[Gasps.] You wouldn’t.
CHEF
Watch me. Now get the fudge out of my house!
[Mr. Garrison's house. Mr. Twig lies in bed, a portrait of Leonardo DiCaprio on the wall.]
MR. GARRISON
I brought you some more juice, Mr. Twig. Are you feeling any better? [Sighs.] I don't know who would want to hurt you like this, but I promise nobody will ever hurt you again, ever. [Senses something wrong.] Mist-Mr. Twig... are you okay? Mist-Mr. Twig..?
[Mr. Garrison pulls the covers back.]
MR. GARRISON
Aaaggghhh!!
[Mr. Twig is broken in half!]
MR. GARRISON
Who did this?!
[Mr. Garrison shouts outside through the bedroom window.]
MR. GARRISON
You won't get away with this, you bastards!
[Chef's house, Chef is on the phone.]
CHEF
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Cochran. [Hangs up.] Well, Johnnie Cochran will take my case if I can pay his legal fee, $2 million.
STAN
Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich.
CHEF
Oh, they wouldn't remember me. All I did was cook for them.
KYLE
You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you.
[Chef starts searching his closet for a coat.]
CHEF
I appreciate that, children, but raising $2 million is not an easy thing to do.
[Chef finds the coat he's looking for.]
CHEF
My only hope is to whore myself to every woman in town.
[The boys Chef as he goes to the front door.]
CHEF
Wish me luck, children.
[He leaves, closing the door.]
STAN
We've gotta help him, dude.
KYLE
Yeah, b-but how?
STAN
Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!
[Live-action footage show an American Airlines plane taking off.]
[Somewhere in England. The boys, with Cartman carrying a box of candy, are approaching a mansion.]
KYLE
Whoa, dude, this house is huge.
STAN
Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass.
CARTMAN
No, it isn't, you guys.
[They ring the doorbell.]
BUTLER
Can I help you?
CARTMAN
We're trying to raise money for our friend, Chef.
[Cartman rifles through the box of candy.]
CARTMAN
Would you like a Moon Crunchie or a Snacky Cake?
KYLE
Are you Elton John?
BULTER
No, I’m one of his butlers.
KYLE
Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys.
[They go inside and find him in his closet, dressed in a 1970's concert outfit, with star shaped glasses.]
KYLE
Hi, are you Elton John?
ELTON JOHN
Sir Elton John. I was knighted, you know.
KYLE
We're trying to raise money for our school chef.
CARTMAN
We have Chocolate Nuggies and S'more Crunchies...
ELTON JOHN
I'm sorry, but I'm not a big candy bar fan.
CARTMAN
What?!
STAN
Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really--
ELTON JOHN
Chef? You mean Chef-Chef?
KYLE
Yeah, dude.
STAN
Wow, you remember him?
ELTON JOHN
Of course. I haven't seen him for so long. I remember when I first met him. It was about 25 years ago.
[Flashback, 1973, "The Small Bar".]
ELTON JOHN
I was a struggling musician who couldn't get a break.
ELTON JOHN
Oh, oh, you're my cheddar cheese girl
You're soft but firm,
and you go well with wine.
Oh oh, cheddar cheese girl
Cheddar, cheddar cheese girl
MAN
Boo!
[The audience starts throwing food and bottles at him, he goes backstage.]
CHEF
Hey, Elton, don't feel so down, baby. Have some of my Scottish haggis. It'll cheer you up.
ELTON JOHN
Thanks, Chef. I just don't understand what my music is missing.
CHEF
Look, Elton, you are a great singer, but a retarded monkey could write better lyrics.
ELTON JOHN
I really thought I had it this time with "Cheddar Cheese Girl".
CHEF
What you need is a guy to write really good lyrics for you. I know a guy named Bernie Taupin who's working at Moth Burger right now. I'll give him a call.
ELTON JOHN
That's a great idea!
CHEF
And, Elton, why don't you get yourself some new threads? You know, some slick glasses and shit.
[Back in the present.]
ELTON JOHN
And so I got Bernie to write my lyrics. And if it wasn't for Chef, I would never have had a career in music.
STAN
So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?
ELTON JOHN
Yes, of course. I'll buy three Crispy Yum Yums.
CARTMAN
Three Crispy Yum Yums.
STAN
Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?
ELTON JOHN
Sure, kid. But I would retain exclusive worldwide rights, [Rushing.] including-but-not-limited-to-Asian-territories, with-a-twenty-percent-commission-from-all-domestic-sales, and-sole-ownership-of-any-and-all-publishing.
STAN
[Unsure.] 'Kay.
ELTON JOHN
Tell Chef I said hi.
STAN
Thanks, dude.
KYLE
Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time!
[Kyle's house, Chef is in bed with Sheila who is having a post-coitus cigarette.]
SHEILA
Oy..! Thank you, Chef.
CHEF
No problem, Ms. Broflovski. Uhh, now, about that hundred bucks?
SHEILA
Oh, of course!
[She reaches into a drawer and hands him the money.]
SHEILA
Here you go.
[Chef gets up to go.]
SHEILA
Leaving so soon?
CHEF
I have a loooooong way to go to raise the kind of money I need.
[Chef leaves.]
SHEILA
Well, best of luck to you, then.
[Gerald walks in excited.]
GERALD
How was it, honey?
SHEILA
Pretty much what I expected.
[The boys stand before another house, and Kyle knocks. The boys now pull a red cart with a large cardboard thermometer demonstrating how much they've raised. The door opens.]
STAN
Hello, are you Meat Loaf?
MEAT LOAF
Yeah. What the hell do you want?
CARTMAN
Mr. Loaf, we are selling candy bars for our dying friend.
KYLE
He’s not dying, Cartman!
CARTMAN
[Whispers.] Shut your goddamn mouth. [To Meat Loaf.] We have Nilla Crunchies, Berry Bars--
MEAT LOAF
What's this for?
STAN
Our friend, Chef.
MEAT LOAF
Chef's in trouble?
KYLE
Yeah. Do you know him?
MEAT LOAF
Do I?
[Flashback, The Pit. "Now Performing: Cous-Cous".]
COUS-COUS
Nobody came again.
CHEF
There, there, Cous-Cous. It'll be all right. Maybe you just need to change your image.
COUS-COUS
What do you mean?
CHEF
Nobody wants to see a guy named Cous-Cous. You need a big, strong beefy name.
COUS-COUS
Beefy? Like, uhh… Tri-tip!
CHEF
That's not bad. Here, have some meat loaf.
[Back to present day.]
MEAT LOAF
I owe everything to Chef.
STAN
Wow! So you'll help him?
MEAT LOAF
You bet. Give me a box of Nilla Yum Yums and a couple of Berry Bars.
BOYS
Cool!
[Crabtree residence. Chef is in bed with Veronica Crabtree.]
VERONICA CRABTREE
All right, let's get this show on the road! Come here, baby!
CHEF
Uh-uh, hold on a second, Veronica Crabtree. How would you like to use some... sex toys?
VERONICA CRABTREE
Sex toys? Like what?
CHEF
Like this very special device.
[Chef brings out a brown paper sack.]
CHEF
I call it "Chef’s pleasure bag".
VERONICA CRABTREE
How does it work?
CHEF
Now, all you do is put this paper bag over your head, and it increases your sexual pleasure.
VERONICA CRABTREE
Really? Well, hell, let's give it a shot.
[She drops a bit, and Chef places the bag on her head.]
CHEF
Ahh, yeah. That's much better.
[Meanwhile, when the boys meet Rick James at his residence.]
RICK JAMES
Sure. I'll do anything for Chef. Give me a box of those Choco-Numbers.
KYLE
Gosh, thanks, Rick James.
STAN
Yeah, thanks. [To Kyle as they walk away.] That’s $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef!
[[City Hall. Chef and Mayor McDaniels are in her bed.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Ohh, that was wonderful, Chef. Good show.
CHEF
[Exhausted.] I can't keep doing this. It's killing me.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Oh, come on, buck up, little fella.
CHEF
I'm serious! I'm not gonna make it.
MAYOR
Sure you are, Chef. I'll give a hundred more for another romp.
[Chef collapses to the floor.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Aw, hell!
[Mr. Garrison's house, Officer Barbrady enters.]
MR. GARRISON
Thank you for coming, Officer Barbrady.
OFFICER BARBRADY
What's this all about?
MR. GARRISON
These pictures just arrived. [Opens envelope.] I set up a camera, and caught Mr. Twig's assailant red-handed. [Pulls out the pictures.] Now, go arrest him!
[Officer Barbrady looks at them, then at Garrison. Garrison looks at them, then softly.]
MR. GARRISON
What?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Can I go now?
MR. GARRISON
Yes—Yes, I’m sorry.
OFFICER BARBRADY
[Leaves.] Weirdo.
MR. GARRISON
[Examining the pictures] It can't be. These can't be right.
[Mr. Garrison walks to the guest closet and opens the door. He looks inside, and gasps loudly.]
MR. GARRISON
Mr. Hat!
[Chef's house. With three police cars already there, the boys arrive just in time. Inside, Chef is being cuffed by two police officers.]
STAN
Wait! Wait! What are you doing?
CHEF
It's over, children. I couldn't raise the $2 million to hire Johnnie Cochran. Now I have to go to jail.
STAN
No, you don't!
CHEF
Huh?
KYLE
We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed.
CHEF
Did what?! Wow! How much did you make?
KYLE
Cartman?
[Cartman is standing by the wagon with the cardboard thermometer of their earnings.]
CARTMAN
Well, you can see here that we raised approximately $95, falling well short of our $2 million goal illustrated hyeeah.
CHEF
[Dejected.] Oh.
KYLE
But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make?
CHEF
I made about $410,300, but--
MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
That doesn't matter, because that money belongs to me!
STAN
You can't take Chef's money! It's illeg--!
MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
I am above the law!
[His hair falls into his face again, which he quickly fixes.]
OFFICER
All right, you, it's time to go.
CHEF
Goodbye, children. Thanks for all your help.
OFFICER
Let's go.
[The officer hits Chef with a baton.]
CHEF
Ow! What the hell did you do that for?!
OFFICER
I don't tell you how to do your job, don't tell me how to do mine.
[The officers lead him out, continuing to hit him.]
CHEF
Ow! Ow!
KYLE
Dude... Chef is gone.
STAN
No more Chef.
CARTMAN
[Voice breaking.] No more Salisbury steak and... pecan pie. [He starts sobbing.]
STAN
We can't let him down, you guys.
STAN
Dude, it's over. He's gone.
STAN
No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?
CARTMAN
Four.
KYLE
But what are we gonna do?
STAN
It's easy, dude. Chef Aid.
KYLE
Chef Aid?
STAN
Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets.
KYLE
Hey, that's a great idea!
CARTMAN
Yeah!
[Mr. Garrison's house. He paces back and forth in front of Mr. Hat. Mr. Garrison is in his underwear, Mr. Hat is seated in the armchair.]
MR. GARRISON
Did you think I would just take you back? Like you can just, walk out and then, come back like nothing happened? Oh, don't look at me like that, Mr. Hat. Remember, you're the one that left.
[Mr. Garrison grabs him.]
MR. GARRISON
I'm not going to take you back.
[He takes Mr. Hat to his front door and throws him into the street.]
MR. GARRISON
You can just go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
[He walks out into the street.]
MR. GARRISON
You are a lying bowl of turd, Mr. Hat!
[Mr. Garrison's neighbors begin to congregate.]
MR. GARRISON
...I hope you starve, you lousy son of a bitch!
[Mr. Garrison notices the crowd watching him. Officer Barbrady walks up to him.]
MR. GARRISON
What are you all looking at? This is just between me and Mr. Hat.
DR. DOCTOR
It's over, Mr. Garrison. This is it. We had enough.
MR. GARRISON
What do you mean?
BARBRADY
I'm afraid it's the big house for you, fruitcake.
MR. GARRISON
What? Jail?
[The boys have set up a very small stage upon which a banner reads, "Chef Aid". Cartman is back to his song and dance.]
CARTMAN
I will do the German dance for you
It's fun and gay and tra-la-la
[A couple approaches the stand, bewildered.]
CARTMAN
I hope my will enjoy my dance,
[The couple leave.]
CARTMAN
Fiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ay
KYLE
Hmm... This isn't going over so well.
STAN
[To Kyle.] Cartman just needs to put more into it. [To Cartman] Dance better, Cartman!
CARTMAN
[Faster.]
Would you like sauerkraut,
German boy,
German boy?
Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut,
Fräulein Setski.
[A white limousine pulls up.]
ELTON JOHN
Howdy ho, boys.
STAN
Elton John! What are you doing here?
ELTON JOHN
It occurred to me that you might need some more help raising money for Chef.
STAN
Boy, do we!
ELTON JOHN
So I called a few friends, and we all decided to come over.
[More limos quickly arrive.]
KYLE
Wow, cool!
ELTON JOHN
I see you've got a stage all set up for us.
STAN
Yeah, dude, it's all yours.
ELTON JOHN
Then, let’s rock and roll! Or something similar.
CARTMAN AND KENNY
Hooray!
[South Park Police Dept. Chef and Garrison now share the same cell.]
MR. GARRISON
...And Mr. Twig is at home, he has no idea Mr. Hat is even back. I mean, I care a lot about Mr. Twig, but Mr. Hat and I have so much history.
CHEF
You finally snapped, huh, Garrison?
MR. GARRISON
What?
CHEF
Don't you get it, Garrison? It's all you! You're Mr. Hat and Mr. Twig! You've got split personality schizophrenic jeebies.
MR. GARRISON
[Pause.] I warn you, Chef, don't even think of taking advantage of me in this prison cell.
CHEF
What?!
[Chef Aid. The stage is now larger, and has a PA system, drums, floodlights, and spotlights.]
TEEN MC
Okay, thanks for coming to Chef Aid, everybody! Are you ready to rock 'n' roll?!
[Five people in the audience stand around, motionless.]
TEEN MC
Whoo!
[No response.]
TEEN MC
All right, let's get things going with... Rancid! [Moves offstage and squeaks.] Ran-cid!
[Rancid takes the stage.]
RANCID
California sun has sunk
[The five people in the audience immediately jump up and down very rapidly.]
RANCID
Behind the Anaheim Hills,
here it comes tonight
[Lots of people start purchasing tickets.]
RANCID
I was hiiiiiigh on junk--
[South Park Police Dept. A short while later.]
MR. GARRISON
[Emotionless.] You're still aren't entertaining ideas of raping me in this prison cell, are you, Chef?
CHEF
No, Garrison! Shut the hell up!
MR. GARRISON
That's good.
[Something pulls the cell wall apart, and the window falls, leaving a large opening.]
CHEF
What the?
MR. GARRISON
Oh, boy, we're free!
[Mr. Garrison and Chef walk out to a truck.]
MR. GARRISON
Wow, what a daring rescue.
[He opens the driver's door.]
MR. GARRISON
Mr. Hat! Mr. Hat saved us, Chef!
[Chef is confused.]
MR. GARRISON
Come on, let's get in the truck! I'll drive from here, Mr. Hat.
CHEF
How the hell did he reach the gas pedal?
[Chef Aid. Rick James has just ended a song. The group is now a large, cheering crowd.]
RICK JAMES
[Vocalizing]
Mmmmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mmmm
TEEN MC
Rick James, ladies and gentlemen!
RICK JAMES
God bless you, Chef!
TEEN MC
And now here's your favorite band, Primus! Whoo!
[Primus is on stage in large duck outfits.]
LES CLAYPOOL
We're damned proud to be here to support our good buddy, Chef. It was Chef who told us in the early days, to keep trying and to keep pursuing our dreams, no matter how much we sucked. I love that man.
[Primus begins to play. Someone holds up a poster saying, "We Love Chef". Mr. Mackey is being crowd surfing atop the crowd.]
MR. MACKEY
Whooaa..!
[Mr. Big record producer walks up to the boys.]
MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
What are you bastards doing?
KYLE
We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you!
CARTMAN
Yeah! Now get out of here before I kick you in the nuts!
MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
Oh, yeah? We’ll just see about this!
TEEN MC
And now, here’s Joe Strummer! Whoo!
JOE STRUMMER
You know, when The Clash were on tour and we lost the beat, Chef would be like at the side of the stage going, "Don't forget, pump your loins, children." You know, that was like his motto or something.
TEEN MC
Whoo!
JOE STRUMMER
Well, it's a rockin' world
Make no mistake about it
[Mr. Garrison and Chef pull up.]
JOE STRUMMER
It's a shocking world
[Chef exits, surprised.]
JOE STRUMMER
Could be what's so great about it
It's a rockin' world...
CHEF
What the hell is this?
[The music stops, and the crowd turns to face him.]
EVERYONE
Welcome to Chef Aid, Chef!
STAN
Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?
CHEF
Mr. Hat busted me out. Children, did you do this?
KYLE
Well, we helped.
STAN
We’re gonna raise your money, Chef.
CHEF
I don’t believe it!
[Mr. Big record producer crawls under the stage with a saw.]
MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
We’ll just see how long this Chef Aid thing lasts. (snickers)
[He starts sawing at one of the stage supports.]
TEEN MC
And now, here he is TV's Ozzy Osbourne!
OZZY OSBOURNE
We're all here to help our good friend, Chef, who has touched our lives in the past.
[Johnnie Cochran is now in the crowd listening.]
OZZY OSBOURNE
I remember when I was just starting out, Chef suggested I buy a pompadour hat. I thought he said, "Bite the head off a bat", so I did. And the rest, oh, it's just history. Now, let's go crazyyy!
[Music starts and crowd roars.]
OZZY OSBOURNE
Ain't nowhere to run!
[Mr. Big record producer is still sawing.]
OZZY OSBOURNE
Ain't nowhere to hide!
[Ozzy picks up Kenny and bites into his head.]
OZZY OSBOURNE
Aarrggghhh!!!
KENNY
(All right dude, let me go now!)
[Ozzy looks up with a bloody mouth, and Kenny's head is missing. The music dies down.]
STAN
Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny’s head off!
KYLE
You bastard!
TEEN MC
And now here’s Ween!
[The crowd cheers. The band members, Dean and Gene are wearing "I'm in Ween" tees.]
DEAN WEEN
We're thrilled to be part of Chef Aid.
GENE WEEN
Chef was the guy who told us to do a country album.
DEAN WEEN
No, dude, that was Steve's idea.
GENE WEEN
Oh. Then who's Chef?
DEAN WEEN
I don't know, dude. I thought you knew him.
GENE WEEN
Oh, well. Anyways, here's our song!
WEEN
Many colors in the homo rainbow
Don't be afraid to let your colors shine shiiiiiiiiiiine
[Out in the crowd, Mr. Garrison has both Mr. Hat, and Mr. Twig.]
MR. GARRISON
Don't worry, Mr. Twig. Even though Mr. Hat rescued me from prison, I'm still going to stick with you.
MR. TWIG
[In a French accent.] Did you love him?
MR. GARRISON
It doesn't matter. He left me.
MR. TWIG
Did you love him?
MR. GARRISON
Yes.
MR. TWIG
Then run to him.
MR. GARRISON
But I feel like I'm making the wrong decision.
MR. TWIG
Love isn't a decision, it’s a feeling. If we could decide who we love, it would be much simpler, but much less magical.
MR. GARRISON
I'll never forget you, Mr. Twig. Thank you.
[Mr. Garrison tosses Mr. Twig away, and pulls out Mr. Hat, and smiles.]
TEEN MC
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John! Whoo!
[The crowd cheers.]
ELTON JOHN
Thank you all for coming to help Chef. This is a song written by a very special little boy. I have no idea what his name is, but who the hell cares? Anyway, he wrote it for his girlfriend.
[He starts playing as the crowd cheers.]
ELTON JOHN
Wake up, Wendy!
[Wendy smiles and looks over at Stan, who smiles back.]
ELTON JOHN
Smell the coffee...
KYLE
Hey, that's your song for Wendy!
CARTMAN
Ha-ha, you're a wuss.
[Stan punches Cartman. Mr. Big record producer is still sawing, finally getting through and the stage tilts slightly, with Elton John still playing. The lights short out and the audience is stunned.]
PRODUCER
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I win! You lose! Chef Aid is over, and you didn't raise near enough money to pay Cochran's legal fees. Ha-ha-ha-ha, I win!
NARRATOR
And what happened then? Well, in South Park they say...
[A little x-ray panel comes up and shows Cochran's heart.]
NARRATOR
Johnnie Cochran's heart grew three sizes that day.
[His heart grows in size and bursts through the panel, which then disappears.]
JOHNNIE COCHRAN
Wait! [Walks to Chef.] Mr. Chef, this music has really touched me. I like to take up your case, free of charge!
CHEF
You will?
JOHNNIE COCHRAN
I will.
[Everyone cheers.]
PRODUCER
No!
JOHNNIE COCHRAN
We'll see you in court, Mr. Record Producer.
PRODUCER
[Dropping to his knees.] Noooooooo!
[Courthouse. Cochran now represents Chef, and the record producer has a new lawyer. The boys are now among the spectators.]
JOHNNIE COCHRAN
Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, you must now decide whether or not to reverse the decision for my client, Chef. I know he seems guilty, but ladies and gentlemen, this...
[He pulls down his display.]
JOHNNIE COCHRAN
...is Chewbacca. Now think about that for one minute. That does not make sense. Why am I talkin' about Chewbacca when a man's life is on the line? Why? I tell you why. I don't know. It doesn't make sense. If Chewbacca does not make sense, you must acquit!
[Johnnie Cochran now holds up a monkey.]
JOHNNIE COCHRAN
Here, look at the monkey. Look at the silly monkey.
[A juror chokes a bit, then his head explodes.]
[Outside. The courthouse entrance opens, and Chef emerges with Stan, Kyle, and Cartman behind him. Reporters gather around him.]
REPORTER
Chef, how does it feel to be a free man and finally have your name credited on the song, "Stinky Britches"?
CHEF
It feels great! I just can't find the words to thank all the artists who put on Chef Aid. And most of all, I want to thank the children.
REPORTER
So, what are you gonna do now?
CHEF
Get back to what's important. It's Tuesday. And means tomorrow is tuna casserole day.
STAN KYLE AND CARTMAN
Hooray!
[End of Chef Aid. Chef's version of "Stinky Britches" plays through closing credits.]
End of Chef Aid

synopsis:When Sharon Marsh's Aunt Flo makes a monthly visit, she brings a mysterious pet fish for Stan. Cartman suddenly has a beard and is very nice.

script:Spookyfish

ANNOUNCER
The following program is brought to you in spooky vision. Be warned: all scenes will be accompanied by pictures of Barbra Streisand.
[A scream is heard and the Halloween/"Pinkeye" opening sequence is shown.]
[Outer Space. A alien ship descends, and then turns towards Earth, headed for the western U.S. As it enters the atmosphere it begins to burn. It slows down and hovers over a road, then lands gently. A door opens like a camera lens, and an alien drops down. As soon as he moves, a tire crushes him. Judging by the size of the tire, the alien was 18 to 24 inches tall. The tire is that of the South Park Elementary school bus, which stops to let the boys off. Then it pulls away.]
STAN
I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.
KYLE
He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.
CARTMAN
Hey guys. How's it going?
[Cartman now has a full goatee. Kyle and Stan laugh.]
KYLE
Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?
STAN
Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?
KYLE
Did you eat too many pork rinds last night?
[Kyle and Stan laugh again.]
CARTMAN
You guys, you're so funny. No matter how I'm feeling, I can always count on you guys to lighten me up.
STAN
What?
CARTMAN
I had to stay home because my mother wasn't feeling well. She has the flu, and I wanted to take care of the house so she could stay in bed
[Stan and Kyle stand there shocked.]
CARTMAN
I just wanted to catch you guys to see if we were assigned any homework tonight.
KYLE
What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!
STAN
Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.
CARTMAN
[Excited.] Oooh, then we can enter the carving contest! I'll run home and get money from Mother. Do you guys need some, too?
[Cartman and the boys look at each other.]
STAN
Dude, this is creepy.
[Stan's house. Stan walks in to find Sharon and someone new.]
SHARON
Stanley? Look who's here. Aunt Flo.
[An elderly woman with glasses who has two gifts wrapped up next to her.]
AUNT FLO
Hello, Stanley. Remember me?
STANLEY
[Flatly] Hi, Aunt Flo.
[Stan hesitates to enter, Aunt Flo begins to tremble.]
SHARON
Now, Stanley! Aunt Flo only visits once a month. Be nice.
AUNT FLO
Hey, Stanley. I brought you and Shelly presents.
STAN
Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo!
[He rushes in, Shelly turning up as well.]
AUNT FLO
Okay, Shelly. This one's for you.
[Shelly opens up the larger box and it expands out into.]
AUNT FLO
It's a television/CD player/surround sound home theater.
STAN
Wow!
SHARON
What do you say, Shelly?
SHELLY
Thank you, Aunt Flo.
SHARON
Okay, Stanley. Your turn.
[Stan opens up his box and reaches in.]
AUNT FLO
Your very own fish.
SHARON
What do you say, Stanley?
STAN
I don't know.
[Stan and the fish look at each other. Stan shows some fear.]
AUNT FLO
[Softly.] I think he likes you. [Normal.] Come on Shelly. Let's hook up your home theater.
SHELLY
Okay.
[Shelly follows her aunt out.]
SHARON
How do you like your fish, Stanley?
STAN
I don't like it. It's spooky.
SHARON
Oh, now, what's spooky about a cute, little goldfish? Go put him in your room.
STAN
Do I have to?
SHARON
Yes, you do!
STAN
Damn it!
[Stan walks off with the goldfish.]
SHARON
Language!
[A different Barbra picture zooms out from the center of the screen. Next: the bus stop. Kyle is already there.]
KYLE
Where have you been, dude?
STAN
Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor.
KYLE
Aunt Flo?
STAN
Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
KYLE
Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.
STAN
Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice.
KYLE
Here he comes.
STAN
Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?
CARTMAN
[clean-shaven] Heh! Yeah, right! You guys could kiss my black ass!
KYLE
You said you could get us money, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Man, you guys are hella stupid! If I had money, I wouldn't give it to you assholes!
KYLE
Well, at least he's back to normal.
STAN
Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!
KYLE
It's okay. Kenny said he'd get one.
CARTMAN
Oh, how's Kenny gonna get one?! He's hella poor!
STAN
Why do you keep saying "hella", fatass?!
CARTMAN
'Cause I'm hella cool, that's why.
KYLE
That's not cool!
CARTMAN
You guys are just hella jealous.
[Night time, storm. Stan's house. Randy is about to turn off the light in Stan's room.]
RANDY
Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning.
STAN
Can you leave the light on, Dad?
RANDY
Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity.
STAN
I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
RANDY
Yeah, me too. But she only visits your mom for five days or so. I'll be out sleeping on the couch. [turns the light off and closes the door].
[In the darkness, Stan pulls the covers close and looks at the fish. They stare at each other, and the fish blows a bubble. Stan turns away, then looks back. The fish just looks at him. Stan then turns towards the window and begins to fall asleep, until lightning startles him upright. He looks at the tank. The fish is gone!]
STAN
Where did it go? [he lifts the covers and looks under the bed, then sits back. The fish swims back into view.] Huhhh. [he gets out, picks up his shirt, and throws it over the tank. He goes back to bed and looks at the tank again.]
[Kenny's house. Rain is dripping in all over the ceiling as pails collect the water. Kenny, Kevin and Mom share a blanket on the sofa while Stuart sits in the armchair.]
KENNY
(Give me that-!) [pulls the blanket off Kevin]
CAROL
Kenny [paf]
KENNY
(Ow, mom!)
CAROL
You share that blanket with your brother! [knock knock knock]
STUART
Who the hell could that be? [the front door opens and the family looks to see who it is].
CARTMAN
[with mustache and beard, and dressed in raingear] Hi there, folks! This is a heck of a storm out now! Thought maybe you could use some provisions. [a box of SUPPLIES is next to him. The parents look at each other] There's some candles and food in there. It ain't much, but it should get you through the night. Take care, folks. I've got other houses to get to. [walks off].
STUART
[suspicious] Kenny, wasn't that your fat, racist, foul-mouthed friend, Eric Cartman?
KENNY
(Uh huh.)
[Stan's house. He gets up once again to look at the tank, but the shirt is not on it anymore.]
STAN
Hey. Where did the shirt go? [hops off and approaches the fish] I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?! [the fish blinks, then looks down and to the right. Stan's eyes follow, and he sees the shirt.] AAAaAaAaAa [runs back to his bed and pulls the covers up, then drops them a bit. He looks at the fish] I'm not gonna look. [shuts his eyes, then opens them again. The fish tank, and the dresser it's on, are closer to the bed] It's not closer. I'm just seeing things. [shuts his eyes again, then opens them. The tank and dresser are at the foot of his bed] GAAAH! [shuts his eyes tight, and opens them one more time. The fish tank is now on the bed, between his feet] AAAAAAAH!! [he jumps off, runs to his door, and rushes into the hallway] MOM! Mom! [comes back to the room with her in tow]
SHARON
Stanley, settle down!
STAN
Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom!
AUNT FLO
[at the door] Is there a problem? [walks to Sharon]
SHARON
Uh, no problem, Aunt Flo.
AUNT FLO
Do you not like your goldfish?
STAN
No!
AUNT FLO
I'm sorry. I'm a bad aunt. [buries her face in her hand and begins to sob.]
SHARON
There, there, Aunt Flo. Stanley loves his goldfish. [he merely looks up at them]
[1:25 a.m. Stan is under the covers looking at the spooky fish. After a long while, the fish turns around and starts writing something on the tank wall with his tail. Stan gets out of bed for a closer look. The fish finishes writing and turns to blow on the wall. A gray area appears and the word "KILL" appears within it.]
STAN
AAAAAAAAH! [runs back to bed]
SHARON
[enters his room and turns on the lights] Stanley, what are you doing?!
STAN
[pointing] The fish! [nothing is left of the writing on the tank wall] But-
SHARON
Stanley, I'm in no mood for this! Not when your Aunt Flo is in town! Oh, look, you woke your sister up. [Shelly stands in front of Sharon, then approaches Stan and slaps him, then leaves the room] Go to sleep, Stanley! [turns off the light and closes the door behind her.]
[Stan gets back into bed and pulls the covers up. Another flash of lighting gets Stan to sit up again. He looks at the tank again, then gets out of bed for a closer look, failing to notice the growing pool of blood next to him. The fish again looks down and to the right, and Stan's eyes follow.]
STAN
[gasps. A man lies dead between the tank and the bed] WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm!
SHARON
All right, Stanley. I have had enough o- [freezes when she sees the body, then, quivering] Oh, Stanley, what have you done, baby? What have you done?? [rushes to comfort him]
STAN
Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-
SHARON
[covers his mouth with her arm, then quietly] Sshhh. It's okay, honey. It's okay. I've got such a good boy, Mommy's little angel. [kisses him and gets up] Now, don't worry, Stanley. Mommy's going to hide the body. [starts to drag it away] Nobody's going to take my baby away. I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy. [she drags the body out of the room and out into the storm. Stan just looks at her]
STAN
[turns to the fish] You're not gonna get away with this! [the fish writes again, blows, and the message is: "Yes I Will."]
[Stan walks over to the window and sees his mom digging a grave next to the body. She then places the body in the grave and covers it up. She returns with the shovel to the kitchen and closes the door behind her.]
AUNT FLO
[her silhouette appears] Sharon!
SHARON
D'uh! Aunt Flo, what are you doing up?!
AUNT FLO
Look at you, with your little shovel. Just like when you were twelve.
STAN
[sees Sharon pass by] Mom, what are you doing?
SHARON
Sshh. It's going to be okay, Stanley.
STAN
Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next!
[The fish blinks and blows a bubble.]
SHARON
[enters the room] Now get some sleep, baby. Mommy's taken care of everything.
STAN
But MOM!
SHARON
[Cradles Stan] Sshh.
Hush little baby, don't say a word.
Momma's gonna buy you a mockin' bird.
If that mockin' bird don't sing, Momma's gonna bury it in the backyard
[8 a.m., next day. A rooster crows and Stan's clock farts. Stan wakes up and looks at the tank. The fish is still there. Stan hops off the bed and walks to the tank, but is stopped by another body.]
STAN
MMOOMM!
SHARON
[frantic] What is it, honey? [gasp!] My baby's killed again!
STAN
[points at the body, then holds up his hands] No, mom!
SHARON
[holds him tight] What are we gonna do, baby? What are we gonna do?? [the fish looks on. Sharon drags the body out] I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy.
[Stan then stands at the window. As he looks out, a reflection of Sharon burying the body is seen on the window pane.]
[Almost 8 p.m., Kyle's house. Kyle and Cartman are at table when Kenny comes in]
KYLE
It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?
KENNY
(Uh huh!)
CARTMAN
Well, where is it? [Kenny brings out a squash and sets it on the table] What the hell is that?!
KENNY
(It's the only thing I could afford.)
CARTMAN
It's all you could afford?! Whoever heard of a squash-o-lantern, Kenny?! That's hella stupid!
KYLE
Stop saying "hella," Cartman! [to Kenny] How are we gonna win the contest with a squash? [as Kyle says this Stan enters the room] Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good.
STAN
[squeezes into Kyle's chair so both fit. Cartman walks to Kenny's chair] I haven't been sleeping so well.
CARTMAN
[cuts the top off the squash and taps at the bottom to clear it out. Sigh] God, I hate you, Kenny. [works on the squash some more] I have to get another knife; this one's hella dull! [goes into the kitchen for another one]
KYLE
God, will you shut up?!
STAN
Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?
KYLE
Yeah.
STAN
Do you think animals can be murderers, too?
KYLE
I don't know. [the bearded Cartman comes in with a huge knife] Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again.
CARTMAN
[gives Kenny a hand] No, Kenny. You should cut with the blade facing away from you. You're gonna hurt yourself. Seriously, dude. Isn't this fun, you guys? Carving pumpkins for Halloween?

You guys are my best friends
Through thick and thin, we've always been together
We're four of a kind, havin' fun all day
Pallin' around and laughin' away
Just best friends, best friends are we.
I love you guys. [throughout the song, Kyle and Stan look on with awe]
[Next day. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are at the bus stop. A picture of Barbra in curls is now on all four corners.]
KYLE
You seem tired, Stan.
STAN
I haven't been sleeping well.
KYLE
Why?
STAN
My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.
KYLE
Hoh, that sucks, dude.
CARTMAN
Hey, dudes. Man, it's hella cold out here.
KYLE
Cartman?
CARTMAN
Who'd you expect? Maury Povich? Golly, you're hella lame!
STAN
What are you doing?!
CARTMAN
What do you mean, what am I doing?! I'm just standing here. Jesus, mellow out, you guys.
KYLE
You can't be standing there, Cartman.
CARTMAN
Why the hell not?!
KYLE
Because you're standing over there!
[Kenny looks at the bearded Cartman.]
CARTMAN
[seeing his parallel for the first time] Aaah! Son of a bitch!
EVIL CARTMAN
[Cartman walks to him] Wow, you don't see this every day.
CARTMAN
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
EVIL CARTMAN
It's like I'm looking in a mirror.
CARTMAN
Dude, this is hella weird.
[Sunrise, Stan's house. Officer Barbrady approaches the front door, humming. [He rings the bell]']
SHARON
[answering] Oh. Uh-Officer Barbrady, Woo, wh-what a surprise. What can I do for you?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, there's been a report of a few missing people.
SHARON
Is that so?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Yeah. No biggie, but I was wondering if you had seen any of them. [show her some pictures of the missing men]
SHARON
I'd never seen any of those men, Officer Barbrady.
OFFICER BARBRADY
No, I didn't think so. Mind if I look around the back yard, though?
SHARON
[somewhat alarmed] Why would you wanna do that?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, I'm checking everyone's back yards. Missing people usually turn up hiding in someone's bushes. May I? [Sharon moves aside and Barbrady enters. They head for the back yard, where five fresh graves await around the clubhouse, and Sparky is pulling a leg out of one of them. Sparky pulls it free and walks away with it] Well, this all looks in- [clunk] oh? Tennis anyone? [falls to the floor unconscious. Sharon had hit him with a pan]
[The fourth image of Barbra zooms out and back with a scream, and Sharon is now in the basement.]
SHARON
Nobody's going to take my baby away from me! Nobody!
OFFICER BARBRADY
[missing his pants and shoes, his wrists are tied to posts] Okay, Mrs. Marsh, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you a few questions.
[South Park Elementary, lunch time. The boys are in the kitchen for their food.]
CHEF
[excited] Hello there, children! [he is dressed as an African chieftain, complete with reebock skull]
THE BOYS
Hey, Chef.
CHEF
All ready for our Halloween lunch? Today I've got spooooooky spaghetti, with freeeeeaky French fries.
KYLE
Uh, Chef?
CHEF
Or haaauuunted hash browns.
KYLE
Chef.
CHEF
And a creeeeeepy cookie, and moooooonstrous milk!
KYLE
Chef.
CHEF
And a teeeeerrifying napkin!
KYLE
Chef!
CHEF
What?!
KYLE
We have problems!
CHEF
Well, what's the first problem?
STAN
Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people.
CHEF
Oh. Well, uh, don't worry, Stan. I'm sure it'll work out. Now, what's the other problem? [Kyle points to Cartman, but now there are two of him. They blink together.] Oh, nohoho. [rubs his eyes] Oh, DEAR GOD, NO!
[Cafeteria dining area. The five boys and Chef are sitting at a table.]
CARTMAN
...and them I saw them all at the bus stop, and this son of a bitch is standing there!
EVIL CARTMAN
I'm sorry I caused so much trouble. This is all very strange to me, too.
CHEF
Exactly what do you remember?
EVIL CARTMAN
Well, I was just standing around, and Stan and Kyle were being really mean, as usual, and Kenny had just bought a new car.
CHEF
Of course! That's it!
STAN
What?
CHEF
Don't you see, children? This Cartman is from an evil, parallel universe where everything exists as its opposite!
CARTMAN
He's my evil twin? But he doesn't even look that much like me; he's all fat and stuff. He's hella lying.
KYLE
Will you stop saying that word?!
STAN
Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!
CHEF
Children, somewhere in South Park, something has created a door to the evil, parallel universe!
EVIL CARTMAN
This is amazing! I can't believe how nice you are, Chef.
CHEF
How do you mean?
EVIL CARTMAN
In my world, you're a skinny, white insurance salesman.
[Chef's jaw drops.]
[Stan's house, daytime. The boys enter the living room and Stan places his fish on a small desk next to the sofa. Aunt Flo greets them.]
AUNT FLO
[shaking] Ooh, hello, boys. I'm Stan's Aunt Flo.
KYLE
Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?
STAN
[taps Kyle, then softly] Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease.
CARTMAN
Ey, sweet! [hops on her lap] Sweeeeeet! Check it out, guys; you don't even have to put a quarter in her.
STAN
Cartman!
CARTMAN
Dude, this is hella cool.
STAN
Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?
AUNT FLO
Nn-oh. [Cartman hops off and rejoins the boys] I got it from the pet store, Stanley.
STAN
Do you remember what pet store?
AUNT FLO
Let's see. I believe it was called "The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store," just outside of town.
STAN
Where?
AUNT FLO
I know I have the address written down somewhere. [Stan turns and takes Kyle aside] Let me look.
STAN
That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.
CARTMAN
Who's "we"? You got a turd in your pocket? I'm goin' home. I'm hella hungry!
EVIL CARTMAN
I'll help you, Stan.
CARTMAN
Shut your god-damned mouth, fatass!
KYLE
Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.
STAN
Just help me take it back. Come on! [walks to Aunt Flo, who's now dead on the floor] Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!
SHARON
[rushing in] Oh, Stanley, no! Not Aunt Flo! [holds her hands to her face]
STAN
It was the fish! [points to it]
SHARON
[dragging Aunt Flo, mutters] Oh, what a good baby. What a good son I have. [the fish swims around]
STAN
Now we'll never know where that pet store is!
KYLE
There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude. [the fish jumps out and somehow pulls Kenny into the tank head first.]
STAN
Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver. [Kenny starts to gargle as the fish gives him the blender treatment. The water turns blood red as Kenny spins in the tank]
KYLE
Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book.
EVIL CARTMAN
Can do!
CARTMAN
Screw you! [the fish spits Kenny's corpse out of the tank and jumps back in. Kenny's left eye is gone and the water is clear]
SHARON
[returning] It's all taken care of, Stanley- G'oh! [sees Kenny's corpse and reacts frantically. Rats rush in to munch on it] I've got such a good boy, such a handsome boy! [drags Kenny away. The fish looks on]
STAN
[to Kyle] Come on, we're running out of time. [both walk by Randy trying to open a door]
RANDY
[turns around] Hey, why is the basement door locked? [turns back and keeps trying]
[The Marsh basement. Officer Barbrady is still tied up.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
-crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
My master's gone away
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
[Cartman's house. Both Cartmans are seated on the sofa. Evil Cartman has the phone book, Cartman has a pot pie.]
EVIL CARTMAN
I don't see any pet stores called "Indian Burial Ground."
CARTMAN
Shut up, dude! I'm trying to watch TV!
ANNOUNCER
And now, back to the Terrance and Phillip Halloween Special.
TERRANCE
[both are dressed as ghosts] (Fart)
PHILLIP
[long pause] That fart was absolutely ghoulish, Terrance. [both pull out little daggers and stab each other as they laugh. Small spurts of blood ensue.]
CARTMAN
Uh-ho-ho, man, that's hella funny! [slaps his thigh]
EVIL CARTMAN
[looks up] What's so funny about that?
KITTY
Meow.
CARTMAN
No, Kitty, this is my pot pie!
MR. KITTY
Meow.
CARTMAN
No, Kitty, this is my pot pie, Kitty!
EVIL CARTMAN
[picks up Kitty] Who's my kitty? Who's my little kitty? My fluffy little cat. Yeah, that's good, yeah, that's my nice little kitty, yeah. [Kitty is purring loudly, happily now. Cartman is not amused.]
CARTMAN
NO KITTY, BAD KITTY!!! [Evil Cartman is startled as Kitty jumps away.] Hahaha, you-hoo suck, dude.
[Night time, the Marsh house. Stan and Kyle are on the sofa. Sharon enters with another woman.]
SHARON
Stanley. Kenny's mother is here. She's wondering if you've seen Kenny.
CAROL
[approaches him] You saw him, didn't you? [Sharon mouths and waves "no" to Stan] You saw my boy. [sits down on the sofa between the boys]
STAN
Yeah, my goldfish-.
SHARON
Yeah. Stan just got a new goldfish and he wanted to show it to Kenny but, Kenny never came over.
CAROL
[cradling Stan, distraught] My Kenny used to laugh and play. He was eight years old, just like you, my Kenny was.
STAN
I know.
CAROL
You've gotta tell me what happened to him! [holds Stan up and throttles him] You have to know something!
SHARON
[intervening] Mrs. McCormick, I'm going to have to ask you to leave! You've been drinking!
CAROL
That's right, I'm a little drunk. [Sharon escorts her to the door] You'd be drunk, too, if you'd lost your boy. [Evil Cartman enters as the women reach the door] My Kenny used to sing and dance, eh.
EVIL CARTMAN
[at the sofa] You guys, I found the pet store!
STAN
Come on, let's go! [takes the fish with him and stops before Sharon] Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!
SHARON
I believe you, sweetheart. [Stan goes outside, and she addresses Kyle and Evil Cartman] Run from him, boys. Run and don't stop!
[A stormy night, at the pet store. The remains of a covered wagon are next to it. The three boys enter.]
CLERK
Can I help you boys?
STAN
I wanna return a fish.
CLERK
[pounds the counter with both fists] Damn it!
KYLE
What?
CLERK
That's the ninth return I've had this week! What's wrong with it? [holds his palms out] Ap! Let me guess. It killed a bunch of people, right?
STAN
Yeah, dude.
CLERK
Damn it! [pounds with the right fist] Just like all the other returns! [the camera pulls back to show them. They all groan and have red, evil eyes. One bird blinks, and its eyes glow]
KYLE
Dude, why is your store called "The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?"
CLERK
Well, there was an Indian burial ground here before I bought it.
STAN
So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?
CLERK
Oh, hell no! First I dug up all the bodies, pissed on 'em, then buried them again upside down.
STAN
Why?
CLERK
Why? I don't know. I was drunk.
STAN
We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.
CLERK
Well, that certainly would explain a lot.
KYLE
Like what?
CLERK
Well, like this. [opens a door marked, "Employees Only." A bright, flashing portal appears] I've been wondering what the hell this was.
[Stan's house. Randy finally opened the door to the basement and brings down some items.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Hello, Mr. Marsh. Top of the evening to you. [Randy turns to see Officer Barbrady, then rushes up the stairs] Okay, bye, then.
[The kitchen. Sharon is preparing cookie dough. Randy enters.]
RANDY
Sharon?
SHARON
Yes, hon?
RANDY
There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.
SHARON
[rolling the dough] Yes, hon. I had to restrain him so he wouldn't find the bodies in the back yard and take our baby away. [begins cutting out cookies in star shapes.]
RANDY
[ponders] Why'd you take his pants off? [long pause. Sharon makes more cookies] Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off?
SHARON
[sobs. Randy comes over] Oh, Randy, I just don't know what to do anymore.
RANDY
What is it?
SHARON
I just ughhhh, I can't believe that Aunt Flo is gone, that she won't be visiting me ever again.
RANDY
Oh. Uh, well, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick?
[Back at the pet store.]
STAN
Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish.
CLERK
I can't give you your money back.
STAN
I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!
CLERK
No! I won't take it back!
EVIL CARTMAN
Listen, friend. You can't sell people pets like this. You have to have a sign that says, "Warning: these fish are from an evil, parallel universe." Now, it's not our fault you disrespected the bodies of this land's native people, but by golly [pounds his right hand with his left fist], you're gonna take this fish back.
CLERK
All right, you win.
STAN
Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman! [the clerk takes the fish from Stan]
EVIL CARTMAN
[turns to face the clerk again] And sir, can I make a suggestion? [the clerk looks at him] Move your store, and let these great people of the Wampanoag rest in peace.
KYLE
You kick ass, evil Cartman!
STAN
Yeah!
KYLE
You know what I like best about you? You don't say, "hella," like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him! [the boys exit the store, and the skies are clear]
EVIL CARTMAN
No, Kyle. Murder is never an answer. [the clerk puts the fish up on a shelf and the employee door opens, the doorway glowing brightly]
CLERK
[recoils] What the-? [two figures appear: Evil Stan and Evil Kyle]
EVIL STAN
He was here! Cartman was just here!
CLERK
Who are you?
EVIL KYLE
We're looking for Cartman. The trail ended here. Where is he?
CLERK
I don't know who you mean?
EVIL KYLE
[pulls out a big bat] Maybe this will jog your memory! [starts releasing the evil returns by bashing in the cages]
CLERK
No! Stop! You don't know what you're doing! Those pets are evil!
[Several identical images of Barbra flash through space, one of them towards the camera, and the boys are walking down Main Street.]
STAN
I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.
EVIL CARTMAN
Hey, you guys. We still have time to enter the pumpkin-carving contest.
KYLE
Hey, yeah! I almost forgot.
EVIL CARTMAN
Come on! I bet that together we can make the best pumpkin ever!
STAN
You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman.
KYLE
Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say "hella."
EVIL CARTMAN
Yuh, thanks, you guys. I certainly like you a lot more than in my evil, parallel universe. [the boys turn to see a man attacked by two dogs, a cat, two ducks, and a vulture]
[The boys resume walking.]
KYLE
Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?
EVIL CARTMAN
Let's use Kenny's squash.
STAN
Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.
[Cartman's house. Cartman is watching TV in the dark. Onscreen, Phillip is in a cemetery standing next to a tombstone that might be Terrance's, and has three roses in his hand.]
TERRANCE
[as a ghost, walks up to Phillip] Boo!
PHILLIP
[jumps up] Aaaaagh!
CARTMAN
Aw, man, this movie is hella scary. [click. The front door flies open and Evil Stan and Evil Kyle burst in]
EVIL STAN
Aha! There you are, Cartman!
CARTMAN
P'h. Nice costume, you guys. You spent about a buck fifty on those?
EVIL KYLE
We're here to take you back, Goody Two-Shoes!
CARTMAN
Oh? I've got a better idea. Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?
EVIL STAN
[he and Evil Kyle look at each other, then] Hey! What's wrong with you, Cartman?
CARTMAN
What's wrong with me? Let's see. Uum. [checks them off] I hate you guys. You're hella stupid.
EVIL KYLE
[he and Evil Stan go over to grab him] Come on, Mr. Wholesome! We're taking you back to our universe!
CARTMAN
Don't touch me! [punches Evil Stan, who releases him]
EVIL STAN
What the hell's goin' on?! Cartman never hits us!
EVIL KYLE
Hall right! Just stand there, Cartman! This gingerification gun will send you back to our universe!
CARTMAN
Oh, right! You guys are from the evil, parallel universe?!
EVIL STAN
Yes!
CARTMAN
Oh, it's about freakin' time you showed up! You don't want me, you want that impostor Cartman! Come on, I'll show you. [leads them out the door]
[At the Pumpkin Carving Contest. Mayor McDaniels is dressed as a Puritan woman. Johnson holds a ball on a platter. They are on stage, which is adorned with two spiderwebs and a bat in each one.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
And the winner is: Squash-O-Lantern, by Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and the evil Eric Cartman from the parallel universe! "The Winning Entry! Squash in cobweb, amid a tiny graveyard and flanked by four tiny bats"
STAN
[the crowd cheers] We won, dude!
EVIL CARTMAN
Hooray!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
You boys win the Halloween Chocolate Ball!
EVIL CARTMAN
Oh, no! [spots Cartman, Evil Stan and Evil Kyle] Stan and Kyle have come to take my back to my world, and I don't wanna go back!
STAN
Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us! [the two groups face each other]
CARTMAN
[to Evil Kyle] Now, zap his hella ass back to your- hella universe!
KYLE
Stop saying "hella," Cartman!
EVIL STAN
[to Evil Cartman] Thought you could get away from us, huh, Cartman?!
EVIL CARTMAN
[pleading] Please!
KYLE
Leave him alone, butthole!
EVIL KYLE
Shut your trap, kid!
STAN
Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.
CARTMAN
Ey, you backstabbin' sellout!
EVIL STAN
It's time, Cartman! Prepare for gingerification! [sets the gun]
EVIL CARTMAN
Well, good-bye, you guys. It's been fun. [Stan and Kyle look down. The evil pets return to South Park and start attacking the townsfolk. They scream as they are being attacked.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Oh, what now?!
KYLE
It's the evil pets [the attack continues, and a vulture knocks the gingerification gun out of Evil Stan's hands.]
EVIL STAN
The gingerification gun!
STAN
[picks it up] Get to the stage! [Stan, Kyle, and Evil Cartman rush up. Stan's spooky fish attacks a man and kills him]
SHARON
[seeing what just happened] Oh, dear. It really was Stan's fish that killed those people!
EVIL STAN
[all six boys are on stage] Give me that gun, kid!
STAN
Up yours, evil twin! [zaps him back to the evil, parallel universe.]
EVIL STAN
[shrinks as Evil Kyle watches] Noooooo! [vanishes]
EVIL KYLE
[zapped, he shrinks too] Noooooo! [vanishes]
CARTMAN
All right, now you can try to send this Bozo through and the whole mess'll be over with!
STAN
Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya. [takes aim]
CARTMAN
What?!
KYLE
We can't deal with you saying "hella" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe! [Cartman takes on Evil Cartman, and both wrestle. Cartman rips off Evil Cartman's mustache and beard, and kicks him. Both of them then stand up, indistinguishable. Stan pulls the gingerification gun back]
KYLE
Which one is the good Cartman?
BOTH CARTMANS
I am!
STAN
Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!
KYLE
Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!
BOTH CARTMANS
[pointing to the other one] He is!
CARTMAN ON LEFT
Time is running out. You'll have to destroy us both.
CARTMAN ON RIGHT
What?!
CARTMAN ON LEFT
It's the only way you can be sure. We have to both go, for the good of the world.
CARTMAN ON RIGHT
[Stan zaps him] Noooo! Screw you guys! [disappears]
CARTMAN ON LEFT
How did you guys know?
STAN
Our Cartman would never say anything like that.
CARTMAN
Haaa hahaha! You guys are hella stupid! I knew you would fall for that!
KYLE
Oh no, dude!
STAN
You tricked us, Cartman!
CARTMAN
That's right, I did!
You guys are hella stupid
You guys are hella lame
You guys are hella dumb
Hella hella hella!
KYLE
Damn it!
[On the street, Randy walks with Officer Barbrady. The evil pets are still attacking the townsfolk.]
RANDY
I'm sorry my wife held you captive, officer. She's been upset 'cause her Aunt Flo isn't gonna visit her anymore.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh, I understand. I remember when my wife stopped getting her monthly visitor.
RANDY
Uuuh, do you want your pants back?
OFFICER BARBRADY
No. Just leave me with my dignity. [turns around and walks into the crowd] Okay, people, move along. Nothing to see here.

synopsis:Dinner with Cartman's family takes a bizarre twist when Uncle Howard shows up after breaking out of prison with his cellmate Charlie Manson.

script:Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!

[The Marsh house. The family is in the living room.]
SHARON
The answer is "no", Stanley!
STAN
But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend!
SHARON
I'm sorry, Stanley, I can't let you go all the way to Nebraska by yourself. It's the holidays.
STAN
But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I?
SHARON
I'll leave it up to your father.
RANDY
[shrugs] Eh, it's fine with me.
SHARON
[ignoring him] The answer is no, Stanley! Now go wash up for supper!
STAN
I don't want your lame-ass supper!
SHELLY
Ew! You're gonna get it now.
SHARON
[pointing to her right] Go to your room, Stanley! Right now! [Randy's angry now. Stan walks to his room and shuts the door]
STAN
[retrieving a backpack from his closet] Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old! [goes to his window, opens it, and stands on the sill] I don't need this stupid family anyway! [drops to the ground outside and leaves]
[Outside the Cartman house. Liane is packing the boys' gear into her station wagon. Kyle's parents and Kenny's parents are seeing them off.]
SHEILA
It's so nice of you to take all the boys with you.
LIANE
Oh, it's my pleasure. Eric loves his little friends.
CARTMAN
[to Kyle] Every time I go to my Grandma's house, she gives me a present. You watch: as soon as I walk in the door she'll hand me a big present, for no reason, except that I'm cool.
KYLE
That's nice, Cartman.
STUART
[on bended knee, to Kenny] Now, remember, if they have left-over turkey, put some in a bag and bring it home, okay?
KENNY
(Okay.)
STAN
[walking up] Okay, let's go!
CARTMAN
Oh, I didn't think you were coming, Stan.
STAN
'Course I'm coming! Come on, let's hurry!
SHEILA
[Kyle walks away] Goodbye, bubbe! Be careful!
STUART
[waving to Kenny] See you in a couple of days, son.
CARTMAN
[rushing past Kyle, who joins Stan on the back seat] Shotgun! It's my car, I call it first: shotgun! [opens the door, only to find Kenny already there. They look at each other] Kenny, I called it shotgun! [Kenny stares back] Dammit, Kenny, get in the back! [Kenny moves not. Cartman points to the right] Hey, Kenny, there's a sale on orange jackets over there. [no movement. Cartman points to the road] Look, Kenny, there's an elephant parade! [Kenny is not moved. Cartman reaches into his pocket and pulls out a dollar] Ken-ny. Kenny, look. Look! Go get it! [throws the bill away], Go get it! [Kenny hops out and Cartman jumps in] ha ha ha, you poor piece of crap. [Kenny gets the bill and hops into the back seat. Lo and behold, there is an elephant parade, with clowns and jugglers and... Liane drives off]
STAN
So, how far is it to Nebraska?
LIANE
Around six hours.
KYLE
Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours?
LIANE
Well, I've got an idea. We could sing.
STAN
Yeah. Or, we could not.
CARTMAN
Let's sing that one Grandma song, Ma. How does it go?
LIANE
Over the meadow and through the woods
LIANE AND CARTMAN
To Grandmother's house we go
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh
Through white and drifted snow...
[4 HOURS LATER.]
LIANE AND CARTMAN
Over the meadow and through the woods
To Grandmother's house we go
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh
KYLE
Please stop.
LIANE AND CARTMAN
Through white and drifted snow
KYLE
[insistent] Please stop!
LIANE AND CARTMAN
Over the meadow and through the woods,
To Grandmother's house we go
CARTMAN
[Kyle angrily kicks him into the dashboard] Argh!
LIANE
Ooo, careful hon. These roads are bumpy.
CARTMAN
[rubbing his nose] I guess, damn! [some traffic is seen]
LIANE
Here we go, kids. We're crossing the state line into Nebraska. [Stan and Kyle go to Kenny's window to check it out. The first sign they see says, "Now leaving Colorful Colorado," on a mountain background with rainbow. The scenery changes abruptly from snow-covered mountains to fields of wheat. Once they pass the state line they see "You are now in NEBRASKA. ...Sorry." Nothing is seen on the horizon]
STAN
This is Nebraska?
KYLE
What's all that stuff?
LIANE
Wheat. The building block of your favorite foods, and, Nebraska's principal source of economic productivity. You see, when Nebraska first became--
CARTMAN
We don't care, Mom.
KYLE
Hey, look! [enunciating a billboard] See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! We have to go, dude!
STAN
[now seated] Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?
KYLE
[now seated] I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous.
CARTMAN
Oh, so now everybody wants to meet Mr. Hankey! He's a piece of crap.
KYLE
It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet me!
LIANE
That shouldn't be a problem. Eric's Grandma is right near the mall.
KYLE
Cool!
CARTMAN
How much further is it to Grandma's house? I wanna see what kind of present she got me.
LIANE
About another hour, hon.
CARTMAN
Why does Grandma have to live so far away? Why don't we just stick her in a nursing home closer to us so [angrily] I don't have to drive six hours to get a god-damned present?!
LIANE
Now, Eric, let's try to get out of that grumpy mood before we get to Grandma's.
LIANE AND CARTMAN
Over the meadow and through the woods
LIANE AND CARTMAN
To Grandmother's house we go
KYLE
Oh, God! [Stan is dejected]
LIANE AND CARTMAN
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh
Through white and drifted snow...
[Later... Cartman's Grandma's house. Cartman's singing is heard approaching.]
CARTMAN
Over the meadow and through the woods...
LIANE
[stops the car] Here we are. [the boys pour out]
KYLE
Jesus Christ, finally!
CARTMAN
[runs to the front door] Grandmagrandmagrandmagrandma! [knocks, rubs his hands together, and an elderly man opens the door. The boys come up behind Cartman]
MAN
Oh, it's little Eric!
CARTMAN
Hi, Grandpa!
GRANDPA
Look at how big you've gotten!
GRANDMA
Hi, Eric. Grandma got you a present.
CARTMAN
Sweet. What is it?
GRANDMA
It's inside.
CARTMAN
Yes! Move it! [shoves Grandma off the porch. She screams on the way down]
LIANE
[now inside with the boys] Hello everyone. Happy Holidays!
EVERYONE
[seven people] Hello!
LIANE
These are Eric's friends: Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. Boys, let me introduce you to the Cartman family. This is Uncle Stinky.
UNCLE STINKY
[brown curly hair, goatee, Fu Manchu mustache] Nice to have you heuh.
LIANE
Aunt Lisa, Cousin Fred, Cousin Alexandra [not shown], Fat Bob, Jimmy [bulldog], and great-grandma Florence. [with walker]
FLORENCE
[Kyle recoils as she approaches the boys] Come here, Eric. Give your great-grandma some huggies. [grabs Kyle and lifts him up]
KYLE
Agghh!
LIANE
No, no, Florence, that's not Eric.
FLORENCE
[releases Kyle] Oh, which one is he, then?
STAN
[pointing] He's the fat one.
GRANDMA
He's not fat, he's big-boned.
CARTMAN
[in sync] I'm not fat, I'm big-boned. Ech.
KYLE
[to Stan] That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee.
STAN
Sick, dude.
CARTMAN
Al-righty then. Let's get to my presents, shall we?
GRANDMA
Here you go, Eric. Hap-py Holidays! [He gleefully rips it open]
CARTMAN
[not pleased] Wait a minute. This isn't a present, it's a shirt! [lifts it out]
GRANDMA
Yes. I thought that would look really good on you.
CARTMAN
[really upset] Are you telling me that I drove nine hours through butt-fucking nowhere to get a god-damned shirt?! Mom, Grandma's gone senile! It's time to stick her in a home!
[The dining room. The thirteen are seated around it. The TV is at the foot of the table, on its own chair.]
GRANDPA
Well, this is what the holidays are about. Family.
STAN
[dissenting] Yeah, right!
GRANDPA
Well, what does your family do for the holidays, Stan?
STAN
My family's dead! [Uncle Stinky, a baby, and Aunt Lisa gasp.]
LIANE
[turns to him, hand to lips] Ooh, I'm sorry to hear that, Stanley.
KYLE
Dude, your family died?
STAN
They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.
KYLE
What?!
CARTMAN
I can't believe I got a stupid shirt! [he didn't have to wear it...] The holidays are bullcrap!
LIANE
Here, Kyle. Will you hold Great-Grandma's catheter bag during dinner? [places it in front of him]
KYLE
What is this??
LIANE
[in his ear] Great-grandma has a bladder problem. This helps her out.
KYLE
[eyes shut] Sick, dude!
LIANE
[now seated] Eric, did you say 'hi' to your little cousin Elvin?
CARTMAN
[flatly] Hi, cousin Elvin.
ELVIN
[the baby, sucking on a Fudgecicle] Sweet.
GRANDPA
[tapping knife on wine glass] Well, it certainly is nice we could all gather heuh for the holidays. Even Uncle Howard has joined us live via satellite from the state penitentiary. [the TV screen shows Uncle Howard at his own table, with a small meal]
KYLE
Whoa, dude! [Stan is surprised]
GRANDMA
You look good, Howard.
HOWARD
No I don't!
LIANE
Hi, Howard.
STAN
[to Cartman] Dude, is he here every year like this?
CARTMAN
Yup!
ELVIN
[tosses his Fudgecicle at the TV, and it slides down the screen] Sweet.
KYLE
[Great-Grandma urinates into the bag. He grimaces] Aaww!
HOWARD
Come on, let's eat already! They gave me extra bread and water!
GRANDMA
Where's your manners, Howard? We haven't even said grace yet. Mom, will you do the honors of saying grace?
FLORENCE
God-damn it, why the hell do I always have to say grace? If one more person asks me to say grace, I'll be like, "Eh! I'm not saying grace! And if you ask me again, I'll kick you square [jabs the fork in the air] in the nuts!"
CARTMAN
Amen. [his feelings exactly]
ALL
Ah-men. [all dig into the food. Bits and pieces being to fly everywhere]
KYLE
[watching the mess] Jesus, dude! [Kenny stuffs his food into a paper bag, and Jimmy growls longingly]
GRANDPA
No, Jimmy, this is my pot pie! [Jimmy growls] No, Jimmy! That's a bad Jimmy!
CARTMAN
Bad Jimmy!
GRANDMA
No, Jimmy, that's Grandpa's pot pie! [Stan and Kyle stare in awe. Jimmy growls, and a hail of "No, Jimmy! That's a bad Jimmy!"s descends on him]
STAN
Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here.
KYLE
I know what you mean. [Kenny packs the last of his meal away]
[Night time. The boys are asleep in the basement.]
KYLE
[jumps up] Arrggh! [Stan wakes up]
STAN
What, dude? [Cartman wakes up]
KYLE
Dude, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with Cartmans!
STAN
Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans.
KYLE
Oh. Arrggh! [thump. Kenny's awake. More sounds, of breaking glass.]
STAN
What was that?
KYLE
I heard it, too.
CARTMAN
Whatever it is, it's getting closer. [Stan pinches him] Ow! What the hell was that for!
STAN
I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming. [Kyle walks behind Stan and punches Cartman]
CARTMAN
Ow!
KYLE
[moving back to his sleeping bag] I wanted to make sure, too.
CARTMAN
Yuhwell, you're not dreaming! [Kenny flies at him with a punch] Ey! Cut the crap!
KYLE
Dude, it's coming through the window! [the window flies open and light streams in. A fat figure jumps in and the kids scream. Cartman goes for the light switch and the light goes on. A surprised prison escapee is what he sees]
CARTMAN
Uncle Howard!
UNCLE HOWARD
Oh. Hey, Eric. I didn't think anybody'd be down here.
CARTMAN
Uncle Howard, what are you doing here?!
STAN
We thought you were in jail.
HOWARD
Yeah, well I'b I busted out. [shows off the broken cuff chain]
CARTMAN
Wow, cool!
HOWARD
Sshhhh! You can't let the rest of the family know I'm here.
CARTMAN
Okay.
HOWARD
If it's okay, we're just gonna hang out here for a couple of days with you kids.
CARTMAN
Who's we? You got a turd in your pocket? Hahahaha.
HOWARD
[turning to the window] Come on up, it's okay. [another man pops up and makes his was in] Another inmate busted out with me. Don't worry, he's a good guy.
INMATE
[turns around] Oh, hi boys. I'm Charlie. Charlie Manson. [the boys express some shock, but then fall silent]
[The next day. Manson looks out the window.]
MANSON
I can't wait to get out among the pigs [turns to Howard] and raise some hell.
HOWARD
All right, Chuck, but we gotta lay low for a while.
MANSON
When I stand up on the mountain and say, "Do it!", it gets done! And it it don't get done, then I'll move on it! And that's the last thing in the world you want me to do.
HOWARD
All right, Chuck. Let's watch some TV or something. [Manson sits before the TV and turns it on.]
ANNOUNCER
Now back to, "It's A Wonderful Life".
GEORGE BAILEY
You-oo you just can't buy people, Mr. Potter, wuh. Why, you know what you are? You're a little bitch. [Potter looks up] That's right, you're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?
STAN
[snaps his fingers] Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall.
CARTMAN
[waking] What?
KYLE
We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman.
CARTMAN
[putting his coat on over his BEEFCAKE muscle shirt] All right, keeps your pants on.
HOWARD
Hey, bring us down some food, all right?
CARTMAN
[follows the boys up the stairs] Okay. [puts on his cap]
[The living room. Football is on.]
STINKY
[eating popcorn] Come on, Team!
CARTMAN
Can somebody drive us to the mall?
ANNOUNCER
Touchdown!
THE ADULTS
Yeah!
CARTMAN
[insistent] Hello, Mr. Hankey is appearing at the mall. Can somebody please take us?
ANNOUNCER
And these Cornhuskers have the ball on the 50-yard line!
CARTMAN
[pops up in front of Stinky] Uncle Stinky, can you drive us to the mall?
STINKY
Not now, Eric. [notices a play] Hold him! He has him! Where's the flag?!
CARTMAN
Uncle Stinky, my stupid friends want to see Mr. Hankey! You have to take us!
STINKY
I said "no," and I mean "no!" Respect my authorituh!
CARTMAN
[leaves grumbling] Damn his Goddamned authorituh!

[SPECIAL REPORT.]
REPORTER
We interrupt this broadcast for a news bulletin.
STINKY
What?!
REPORTER
["NEBRASKA NEWS"] Mass murderer and extremely nasty person Charles Manson has escaped from prison! Manson was the man responsible for seven murders in the late '60's. Manson has never shown any signs of remorse for his crimes. If you see Manson, please kick his ass and smash his fucking face in for me, and then call the police. And now back to the game.
ANNOUNCER
And they've done it! They've scored 16 unanswered points in 15 seconds! [NEB 23, ARK 16]
THE ADULTS
Oh, weak!
GRANDMA
[the boys walk past her] Eric, I need you to take care of your cousin Elvin for a while.
CARTMAN
I don't wanna take care of Cousin Elvin!
GRANDMA
Won't yo do it for Grandma?
CARTMAN
All right. Give me $10. [she reaches into her purse and gives it to him]
ELVIN
[licking another Fudgecicle] Kick ass!
[The basement. Manson is still watching the TV.]
GEORGE BAILEY
Oh, Mary. Mary, you're real!
HOWARD
Chuck, can you turn that thing down?
GEORGE BAILEY
Hello, movie house! ["Gone With The Wind" is playing there] Hello, burger parlor!
MANSON
You know what the spirit of Christmas is? It's another lie, from the lyin' pigs that consider me the witness-!
HOWARD
Okay, Chuck! Thank you very much!
CARTMAN
[coming down the stairs with his friends and Elvin] My family sucks ass!
KYLE
Yeah, they do!
STAN
All families suck ass!
CARTMAN
Here. We got you some sticky cinnamon buns. [hands the bag to Howard]
HOWARD
[digging in] Wow, sweet!
MANSON
Heyyy!
KYLE
Dude, we have to get to the mall!!
ELVIN
You guys, seriously!
HOWARD
What's the matter?
CARTMAN
My stupid friends want to go to the mall to visit Mr. Hankey, but nobody would drive us.
HOWARD
Oh, bummer.
MANSON
I'll take you! [a heavy note sounds]
HOWARD
Uh, that's okay, Chuck. You just keep watching Christmas specials.
MANSON
Hey, I didn't bust out of prison to be locked up in somebody's basement! I want some action!
KYLE
Good for you, Charlie!
MANSON
[to Cartman] Come on! I'll hot-wire your Grandpa's car!
STAN
Do you really think we should go with this guy?
CARTMAN
Stan, don't be such a dumbass. You have to trust people. [walks away]
[Outside. The boys, Manson, and Elvin head for the station wagon.]
MANSON
All right, boys, keep your heads down! [they get into the wagon, Manson hot-wires it, and steps on the gas] We're goin' to the mall!
BOYS
Hooray!
[South Park, the Marsh house.]
SHARON
I just can't believe he would go without our permission!
RANDY
Now, Sharon, don't overreact. Maybe Stan didn't go to Cartman's Grandmother's. Maybe he just ran away or got kidnapped or something.
SHARON
Well, I hope for his sake you're right. [calls Liane]
LIANE
Hello?
SHARON
Hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother. Did Stanley go up there to Nebraska with you?
LIANE
Oh, why yes he did. I thought you were dead, Sharon.
SHARON
Wwhat?!
LIANE
Stanley told me you had passed on. I'm glad to see that you're better.
SHARON
[irate. Shelly is now present] Get the car, Randy! We're going to Nebraska!
SHELLY
Ooooo, Stan's in trouble!
[Mall of Nebraska.]
KYLE
[jumping up and down to get a better look] Do you see him?
STAN
Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go.
KYLE
I can't wait to see him! [a kid looks back] He's gonna be so glad we came!
KID
I drove all the way from Montana to see Mr. Hankey.
KYLE
That's nice, kid. I knew Mr. Hankey before he was even famous.
CARTMAN
How the hell did Mr. Hankey get so popular? Look at all this Mr. Hankey stuff. [a display is seen of Mr. Hankey caps, T-shirts, cups, figurines, and posters]
ELVIN
Mr. Hankey kicks ass!
CARTMAN
And another thing: it says that Mr. Hankey is also appearing at the Crossroads Mall!
KYLE
So?!
CARTMAN
So, how can Mr. Hankey be here, and in another mall at the same time?
KYLE
Dude, Mr. Hankey has magic powers. He can do whatever he wants. [Charlie Manson and Kenny stare at each other. The line moves up]
MANSON
[to Kenny] How would you like to come with me to a more secluded part of the mall?
KENNY
(Okay) [they walk off]
STAN
I really like that guy.
CARTMAN
Oh, it looks like you finished your Fudgecicle, Elvin. [Elvin looks at his hands and sees nothing to lick, then begins to cry] God damnit, be quiet, Elvin! Shut up, Elvin! [grabs a stick and whacks him on the back of the head. Elvin is now catatonic, but manages a blink] No, Elvin, bad Elvin! [seeing that Elvin is not responding, he looks around]
[Sweet Box, your music box headquarters. Manson and Kenny are looking around.]
MANSON
[explaining things to Kenny] Folks need to understand that I am terror! I am fear! I am-! Oh, hey look, another holiday special.
VOICE-OVER
And now, back to "The Grinchy Poo" [a shot of Grinchy Poo stealing a decorated tree]
NARRATOR
Grinchy Poo went up the chimney and stuffed the tree up
But then he heard a coo, like the cry of a dove
It was little Cindy Lou Poo, who was no more than two
"Mr. Hankey, why? Why are you taking our Christmas tree, why?"
And Old Grinchy Poo thought of a line, and he thought it up quick...
[Lollyland. a mall worker dressed as a Hankey elf, covered in Hankey kisses, approaches the boys.]
HANKEY ELF
All right, boys, you're up next. Welcome to Mr. Hankey's Happy Lollyland! [voice dripping with bitterness]
KYLE
[elated] Hoh, boy. Here we go!
MALL HANKEY
Howdy ho, boys.
STAN
[after a pause] Mr. Hankey? [his elves lift the boys onto Hankey's lap]
MALL HANKEY
Gosh, you boys smell like flowers.
KYLE
You're not the real Mr. Hankey.
MALL HANKEY
Sure I am! Howdy ho!
STAN
You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you.
MALL HANKEY
Well, Mr. Hankey has to grow too, you know. Howdy ho!
HANKEY ELF
You boys want your picture with Mr. Hankey?
KYLE
This is not Mr. Hankey! [a picture is taken] This is a fake! [gasps from other kids and adults. A boy cries]
MALL HANKEY
It's okay, kids. I'm real. Hoowwdy ho!
KIDS
[a crowd now, they wave back] Hoowwdy ho!
KYLE
Why are you people doing this? Why would you lie like this? To children?
MALL HANKEY
[softly] Look, kid. There's Mr. Hankeys like me in every shopping mall. There is no real Mr. Hankey.
KYLE
[insulted] What?! What did you say?!
STAN
Oh, boy. You've done it now.
MALL HANKEY
Huh??
KYLE
[stands and rips off the mall Hankey's helmet] Behold! Here's your false prophet!
KIDS
[gasp] Boo! [throw plastic Hankey's at the mall Hankey]
MALL HANKEY
Ow!
KIDS
Die!
MALL HANKEY
Ow!
KID 1
Get out! [the kids rush the chair and attack Hankey and his elves]
KIDS
[background] You son of a bitch! Rip it down! Get out!
GIRL
You lied to me, Mother. You said it was the real Mr. Hankey.
MOTHER
Uh, well, yes, but-
GIRL
I will not forget this, Mother. I will not forget this, ever. [turns and walks away]
KID
This is revolution! [more rioting. Two kids prepare a Molotov cocktail. The blond kid lights it, the one in yellow-trimmed blue cap chucks it at the Lollyland setup. It goes up in flames]
MALL HANKEY
[getting out of the way] Wah-hahow!
SECURITY GUARD 1
Uh oh, they're rioting again. [the other guard raises an eyebrow. Three kids smash a bench into an electronics store window. Two of them take a TV and the third goes further inside]
[Back at the Sweet Box...]
NARRATOR
And all the poos down in Pooville joined hands and they sang
They sang all the same
And he himself, the Grinchy Poo, carved the roast poo.
MANSON
[pleased with the special] Wow, man. That's beautiful. He was evil, but now he's good. [Kenny looks at him]
[At what was Lollyland. A battering ram comes through a wall and everyone scatters. Police in riot gear pour in behind it.]
OFFICER 1
What's happening?
OFFICER 2
Some kid must have said it wasn't the real Mr. Hankey again. [the kids and the officers race at each other and do battle. Brimmy leaves this graffiti on the wall: "No more lies!" and runs away. Am officer gives chase. Another officer pumps a tear gas canister into the crowd and the kids fall from the resulting gas]
CARTMAN
[the boys regroup] I told you guys. The holiday season is nothing but lies and bullcrap!
MANSON
[arriving] Well, how was it?
KYLE
It was a fake!
MANSON
Oh, I'm sorry.
KYLE
Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots!
STAN
Where did you go, Uncle Charlie?
MANSON
Uh, I went to a beauty parlor and had my tattoo redone. [a happy face replaced the swastika] Look!
CARTMAN
Oh, uh that's pretty cool.
STAN
Hey. Where's Kenny?
MANSON
Oh. He's... around.
KENNY
[arriving] (Hey guys, what's up?)
STAN
Oh, hey Kenny.
MANSON
Come on, I'll buy you kids an orange Smoothie.
THE BOYS
Ooooo!
OFFICER
Hey, there he is! That's Charlie Manson! [the officer rush towards him]
MANSON
Run for your lives, boys! [no time for a Smoothie. All head for the mall doors and rush out to the station wagon]
CARTMAN
[outside, falling behind with Elvin] Ugh! Wait! You guys. Seriously. [the officers follow]
OFFICER
Come back here, God damnit! [Manson and the boys get in the station wagon and Manson backs up all the way to the highway, jumping the curb] He's getting away! [the officers get into their cars and pursue Manson]
MANSON
Keep your heads down, kids! [an officer fires into the wagon and the back window breaks]
CARTMAN
Ey! What the hell is wrong with you people?!
KYLE
I can't believe they would put a fake Mr. Hankey in a mall! If Mr. Hankey ever found out, he'd be so pissed!
[Grandma's house. A news bulletin is heard.]
ANNOUNCER
We interrupt this program for a breaking news story.
REPORTER
A high speed car chase is happening right now on interstate 3. We go now to our live sky-fi helicopter.
SKY-FI REPORTER
Ron, it looks as though the chase is proceeding west down the interstate.
GRANDMA
Oh, that looks a lot like your car, Harold.
SKY-FI REPORTER
We understand that Charles Manson is inside the car with several hostages, all of whom are children [Manson sideswipes another car, which loses control and stops. The police drive around it] My God, what is this world coming to? Well, we'd like to take a moment to tell you that this car chase is being brought to you by Snacky S'mores [a beaver roasting one appears], the creamy bonbon s'mores in a delightful cookie crunch.
[The highway. More shots taken at the wagon.]
MANSON
They're gaining on us! [more shots, and Elvin tosses his Fudgecicle out]
OFFICER
Fudgecicle! [swerves to avoid it. Two other patrol cars jump over his and burst into flame upon landing]
ELVIN
Kickass! [other cars take up the pursuit and fire at Manson]
KYLE
God, I hate the holiday season! [more shots]
[Manson pulls into Grandma's driveway. Grandma stands outside.]
GRANDMA
[the kids rush past her] Oh, hello kids. Having fun-?
MANSON
Get in the house!
GRANDMA
Alrighty, then. [walks in as the cops pull up]
CARTMAN
Lock the door! [Terrance and Phillip are on]
BIG BLONDE
Oh my God, it's Charlie Manson! Whoa!
HAROLD
What's going on?
STAN
There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us!
STINKY
Quiet down, we're watching television. [Terrance and Phillip laugh]
TERRANCE
Oh, Phillip, what a precious gift! [opens it]
PHILLIP
That's right, Terrance. This is the season for sharing. [farts on the gift, and both laugh]
HOWARD
[appears with rifle in hand] The cops are here!
GRANDMA
Howard!
HAROLD
How did you get out, son?
[Outside. The officers have hunkered down.]
POLICE CHIEF
[on the bullhorn] All right, Manson, we know you're in there! Come out peacefully, and we'll shoot you!
OFFICER
[whispers into the chief's ear] Tell him we won't shoot him, Boss.
POLICE CHIEF
[whispers back] Oh, yeah. That's a good idea. [on the bullhorn] Come out peacefully, and we won't shoot you! [Howard and Grandma peek out]
GRANDMA
Oh, look. Police Chief Stevens got a new haircut.
HOWARD
[points the rifle at her] Get down, Ma!
MANSON
Hey, man, don't point a gun at your own mother!
HOWARD
What the hell is wrong with you, Manson? You're acting all funny! Everybody just sit down and shut up! We're not going back to the big house!
HAROLD
Well, Howard, you've done it again! You've ruined Christmas!
[Outside Grandma's house. The press shows up.]
FIELD REPORTER
This is Robert Pooner reporting live from Nebraska, where escaped convict Charlie Manson has walled himself up in a house. [the camera zooms in on Grandma's house] We understand that there are hostages, and that the situation is critical, [zoom out], so we would like to remind you all that this live hostage crisis is being brought to you by Palmoral Sun Block [SPF 200]. Remember, if it isn't Palmoral, you're gonna get cancer.
[Off camera, the Marshes drive up and get out. Sharon approaches the police.]
SHARON
What's going on here?!
CHIEF STEVENS
We've got a critical situation, ma'am. Charlie Manson is holding everybody inside hostage.
SHARON
Is this the Cartman residence?
CHIEF STEVENS
Yes, ma'am.
SHARON
Give me that! [grabs the bullhorn and] Stanley! This is your mother!
[Inside]
STAN
Oh ooh.
KYLE
What's your mom doing here, dude?
SHARON
[outside] Young man, I have had it! You have disobeyed me for the last time! [Grandma, Howard and Manson look out the window. They turn to face Stan.]
HOWARD
Wow, she's really pissed.
MANSON
[pointing] I'm glad I'm not you right now, kid.
[Outside.]
SHARON
What do you have to say for yourself, Stanley?!
STAN
[from inside the house] ...Sorry.
ROBERT POONER
Still more developments in the Manson hostage crisis. Uh, it appears now that eight-year-old Stan Marsh [picture shown] is in BIG, big trouble. He apparently disobeyed his parents, left home without telling them, and uh, Tom, his- his mother is very disappointed with him.
HOWARD
Damn it! What are we gonna do?
FLORENCE
Sshhhh! We're watching television.
[Terrance and Phillip are teasing a reindeer with a red nose - Rudolph. Terrance runs up and farts on its face, and the deer flinches. Terrance runs back as both men laugh.]
PHILLIP
[running up] Waitwaitwaitwait. [farts on Rudolph's rear and runs back laughing]
TERRANCE
[running up] Check out this one. [farts on Rudolph's face and runs back laughing]
PHILLIP
[running up] Hold on, hold on. Over here, over here. [farts on Rudolph's rear and runs back laughing]
TERRANCE
[running up] Okay, here I come, okay. [farts on Rudolph's face and runs back laughing]
PHILLIP
[running up] Okay, waitwait waitwait. [farts on Rudolph's rear and runs back laughing]
[The living room.]
CHIEF STEVENS
[outside, with bullhorn] Come out with your hands up!
HOWARD
Damnit, Dad, why didn't you put a back door on this house?!
HAROLD
Well, there's that old window in the bathroom; you could probably squeeze through there.
HOWARD
That's it! We're going out the bathroom window! Come on, Manson!
MANSON
But I gotta see what happens.
HOWARD
Come on, damn it! [Manson hurries, panting] Well, it's good seeing you all. Don't move until we're gone or I'll shoot you dead. Happy holidays.
THE ADULTS
Happy holidays. [Uncle Howard and Manson leave]
STAN
[walks to the window, looks out, sees his parents, then turns to Kyle] Dude, they're gonna kill me.
CHIEF STEVENS
[outside] All right, Manson, this is it! We're coming in after you! There's gonna be a lot of bloodshed, and a lot of innocent people are gonna die! You've got until 100-Marshmallow to come out!
OFFICER
1-Marshmallow, 2-Marshmallow,...
[The bathroom. Howard works on the window.]
HOWARD
["3, Marshmallow," The window opens] All right, it's open! Let's go!
STAN
[walking in] 'Scuse me. I wanna go with you.
MANSON
Huh?!
STAN
Please, I don't wanna go back with them.
MANSON
But Stan, your mother and father are out there!
STAN
I know! They've come to punish me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the first place.
HOWARD
All right, kid, you can come. Now, let's go. [starts going through the window. Stan steps on the toilet seat, but Manson stops him.]
MANSON
Stan, I wanna talk to you about family. [Uncle Howard is out.]
STAN
What?!
HOWARD
[popping up] What?!
MANSON
You see, I had a family once. At least, I called them my family. Really, they were nothin' but a gang of people I thought were my friends. Ah after we killed a bunch of people together, I realized that my real family was who took care of me, and who took the time to care about what I did.
STAN
But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me.
MANSON
If they don't care about you, would they have driven nine hours to Nebraska?
STAN
[pondering] I guess you're right, Uncle Charlie. Thanks. [they hug]
HOWARD
Now can we go??
MANSON
No, Howard. You go ahead. I've got something to say. [walks out the bathroom door]
HOWARD
Oh, weak!
[The living room. Manson walks in.]
MANSON
Folks, I apologize for this whole mess. I'm going to surrender. Somebody show the police a white flag.
[Outside. The countdown continues.]
OFFICER
[on the bullhorn] 90-Marshmallow, 91-Marshmallow [to Police Chief Stevens] This is making me hungry for marshmallows [on the bullhorn] 92-Marshmallow [the front door opens and the police get into positions. The flag appears, followed by Kenny, carrying it]
CHIEF STEVENS
Look out, he's got a white flag! [his officers fire away, killing Kenny and breaking the flagpole in half]
MANSON
[peering out] Oh my God, they killed the little orange-coat kid!
KYLE
[peering out] You bastards! [the police don't react. Everyone now pours out of the house]
CHIEF STEVENS
[surprised] They're surrendering!
COPS
[run up and handcuff the pair] Okay, grab a hold of him. You're under arrest, buddy. [two of them beat on Kenny's corpse]
BLOND COP
All right you, spread 'em! [puts the cuffs on Kenny]
CHIEF STEVENS
[helping in Manson's arrest] You're going back to prison to rot, Manson!
MANSON
Good! I deserve to!
CHIEF STEVENS
What??
MANSON
[hands behind his back] I can never make it up to the families that I destroyed, but at least I'll make an example for anyone else thinking that crime [softly] is an answer.
CHIEF STEVENS
Stop that. [the officer releases Manson]
MANSON
You see, I get it now! I finally understand what the holidays are all about. Boys, don't you see? You can't let things get you down during the holidays, because being happy is what the holidays are all about!
KYLE
Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some fake Mr. Hankey spoil my holidays.
MANSON
I've been such a bastard all these years, and I finally understand. And it it it feels great! If I feel like- I feel like I'm in my own Christmas special. You see...
Holidays are that special time
When we laugh and sing and feel warm and cozy
Forget about being angry for a day [picks Elvin up]
Remember how it felt to be a child
Opening presents on Christmas mornin'
That's the way that we should all feel now
So I say Happy happy happy happy holy happy happy happy
Holidays
EVERYONE ELSE
Happy happy happy happy holy happy happy happy
Holidays
MANSON
Happy Kwanzaa, too
From me to you
Happy Holidays, you guys.
CHIEF STEVENS
Happy Holidays, Bob.
OFFICER BOB
Happy Holidays, Chief.
CHIEF STEVENS
Come on, Manson. You belong in jail. [finally cuffs him]
MANSON
You're darn right I do.
HOWARD
[being cuffed] Well, I guess I'll be going, Mom and Dad. I hope you can forgive me.
GRANDMA
Oh, of course we forgive you, son. It was nice of you to pop in for the holidays.
GRANDPA
Yes. Now, watch that ass in prison, son.
HOWARD
I always do. See ya, Eric. Thanks for all your help.
CARTMAN
See ya, Uncle Howard. [mad] Thanks for being such a great role model for me. [very softly] Piece of crap.
STAN
I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom.
SHARON
Oh, Stanley. Let's just forget the whole thing and have a nice holiday back home.
STAN
Really?
RANDY
Sure. We'll punish you after the holidays.
STAN
Hooray! Uh, I mean, wait. What?
ROBERT POONER
[wrap up] And so, Manson is hauled off to jail to rot in his cell. Everything is back to normal, and I guess the only thing left to say is, God bless us, everyone.
[Nebraska State Penitentiary.]
MANSON
[in a cell with three other mates, reading from his latest book] "And I guess that's what I've learned. I'm sorry for what I did, but that doesn't make up for it. I deserve to be in jail. All I hope is that I don't make mankind lose faith in itself. Yes, there's murderers in the world. There's rapists and thieves. But those are the vast minority. The majority of mankind is made up of caring people, who try every day to do what they think is right. And that's the spirit of the season." What do you think, guys?
INMATE
It sucks, just like all your other books. [Manson puts his book next to the others and walks off: "AH, MILAN," "OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FOREST," "Are You There God? It's Me. Manson"]
MANSON
Well, Guh Good night, you guys. Happy Holidays.
INMATE
Shut up! [Manson turns off the lights. Soon, noise is heard outside the cell]
MANSON
What was that? [turns off the lights] What the?! [surprised to see the Cartmans and the boys inside the cell]
CARTMANS/BOYS
Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson!
[Grandma bears a cake. Manson melts, smiling. End credits soon roll]
"Hark," the herald angels sin,
"Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth, and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled"
[Manson joins them] Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
"Hark," the herald angels sing
STAN
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
End of Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!

synopsis:The boys are assigned to write a report with Tweek, a very nervous and highly caffeinated boy who insists gnomes are stealing his underpants.

script:Gnomes

[South Park Elementary. The class bell rings and the children are rowdy.]
MR. GARRISON
[entering] Settle down, children. I have some difficult news. This is going to make you all very sad. [the class is now seated] The school board is considering firing me as your teacher. There's a possibility that I will be let go and never allowed to teach you again. [Stan raises his hand] Yes, Stanley?
STAN
That's okay with us.
KYLE
Yeah.
KID
Yeah, we don't care.
CARTMAN
Yeah, that's fine.
MR. GARRISON
No it isn't, it makes you very sad! Now, apparently, the school board thinks that I don't teach you anything about current events, so tomorrow they're going to have you do presentations for the whole board.
CLASS
Aawwww! [heads drop]
MR. GARRISON
[writes on the board] "Current Events in South Park". Now, I want you all to read a newspaper, or better yet, watch television, and come up with something current in South Park to do a report on.
CLASS
Aawwww! [heads drop. Cartman is certainly vocal about it.]
MR. GARRISON
Now, this'll be a group project, so I'm going to place you all into groups of five. Let's see, uh. Wendy, Bebe, Clyde, Pip, and Tolkien, you'll be Group 1, and Group 2 will be Stan, Kyle, Eric, Kenny, a-and, and Tweek.
TWEEK
[disheveled and really tweaked] AAAghah heheh.
STAN
[laments] Oh, not Tweek.
KYLE
We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.
MR. GARRISON
There's nothing wrong with Tweek. I bet he'll do a great job in your group.
TWEEK TWEAK
I can't take that kind of pressure. No, Sweet Jesus, ple-hehease!
STAN
Dude, we can't work with this kid.
TWEEK
Yuh-ugh!
MR. GARRISON
That's what Chad Everett thought when the new female intern joined the cast of Medical Center. He thought, "Who is this woman with her gazungas and high heels? What does she know about medicine?" Well, that intern soon saved Chad Everett's brother with a kidney transplant. So, you see? [silence]
STAN
No.
MR. GARRISON
Well, let me put it another way. You have to give your oral report to the entire South Park Town Committee tomorrow. And if it doesn't kick ass, and you make me look bad, Mr. Hat is gonna smack you bitches up!
TWEEK
Wagh!
[South Park, downtown. Off to the right of Tom's Rhinoplasty is a coffee store: Tweek Bros. A businessman walks in with briefcase.]
RICHARD TWEAK
Hello there, customer.
CUSTOMER
Hello. How are you today?
RICHARD
Great. What can I get for you? Large coffee, small coffee? [motions to the menu]
CUSTOMER
I'm actually interested in something else. I'm John Postum from the Harbucks Coffee Corporation...
RICHARD
Oh, you're that corporate guy who's been calling.
POSTUM
That's right. How come you don't call me back? All we wanna do is buy out your coffee shop here.
RICHARD
Oh, forget it, my store is not for sale.
POSTUM
My company's prepared to make you a veerry generous offer. [lifts the briefcase and opens it. It's empty, but he elaborates] This is a Cramsonite briefcase. All leather, it has four compartments and a keyless lock. Interested?
RICHARD
Uh, I don't think so. My coffee shop is worth a lot to me.
POSTUM
Well, all right. [closes the briefcase and lifts up two money bag] How about $500,000?
RICHARD
The answer is still no, Mr. Postum. You see, when my father opened this store 30 years ago, he cared about only one thing: making a great cup of coffee. [moves to his left, towards a backdrop containing lovely rolling hills and a rainbow. A soothing acoustic tune comes up] Sure, we may take a little longer to brew a cup, and we may not call it fancy names, but I guess we just care a little more. [a cart of beans rolls up to him] And that's why Tweek Coffee is still home-brewed from the finest beans we can muster. Yes, Tweek Coffee is a simpler cup, for a simpler America.
POSTUM
Well, that's too bad. We're just gonna have to open our Harbucks right next door to you.
RICHARD
[protesting] But that could put me out of business.
POSTUM
Hey, this is a capitalist country, pal! Get used to it!
[Postum leaves. Officer Barbrady enters.]
BARBRADY
[sees Postum leaving] Hello, Mr. Tweek.
RICHARD
Hi, Officer Barbrady.
BARBRADY
Who was that?
RICHARD
Oh, just some dong. What can I get for you.
OFFICER BARBRADY
The usual.
[Richard pulls out a brown cat from behind the counter and slaps him with it.]
[Barbrady leaves as he closes the door.]
RICHARD
Bye-bye.
[South Park Elementary. The class is now in groups of five. Tweek is still wired.]
STAN
Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--
TWEEK
[twitching and closing his right eye] AAAaaagh. Ugh, ugh, huh, aarrrnnn. Aaarrrhaharn.
STAN
Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about.
[Shots of Kyle, Kenny, then Cartman.]
CARTMAN
How about we do it on that Raymond guy on TV, you know, Everybody Loves Raymond.
KYLE
[angry] No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?
[Stan gets alarmed.]
TWEEK
Uuurrnnn, too much pressure!
STAN
Great. A lot of help you are, kid.
TWEEK
The gnomes!
STAN
What?
TWEEK
[gritting his teeth] We can do our report on the gnomes.
STAN
What gnomes?
TWEEK
The underpants gnomes. The little guys that, that come into your room late, late at night and steal your underpants.
[Shots of Kyle, Stan, then Cartman looking at Tweek.]
CARTMAN
Oh, so that's where all my underpants go.
KYLE
Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
STAN
Yeah, I've never seen any underpants gnomes.
TWEEK
They come out at 3:30 in the morning. Most people aren't up then, but I am. I can't sleep. Ever.
KYLE
Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up.
TWEEK
No!! Sleep at my house tonight; I'll prove it to you.
[The Tweak house that night. Richard Tweak and his wife are in the kitchen. They have three coffeemakers going on at once. Coffee mugs are everywhere.]
RICHARD
They want me to sell the store, and it's so much money.
MRS. TWEAK
Some things are more important than money. [turns around] The people of South Park count on you to give them that first cup of coffee every day.
RICHARD
I know, but if they open a Harbucks right next door, we might go out of business. They really have my balls in a vice grip.
[Tweek and the boys enter.]
MRS. TWEAK
Oh, hello, son. How was your day?
TWEEK
UUuuUunh!
MRS. TWEEK
That's good. Who are your little friends?
TWEEK
What do you mean?!
KYLE
We're his oral report buddies.
STAN
Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it.
MRS. TWEAK
Well, have some coffee boys. I'll brew up another pot for later.
[The boys each take a cup.]
KYLE
Coffee? I don't think I like coffee.
MRS. TWEAK
Hoh, you'll like this coffee. It's fresh.
RICHARD
[waxing prosaic] Country fresh, like the morning after a rainstorm.
STAN
'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.
RICHARD
Oh. I've got one for you. How about doing a report on how large corporations take over little family-owned businesses?
MRS. TWEAK
Richard!
RICHARD
No, I'm- serious, hon. These boys should learn how the corporate machine is ruining America. You see, I own a coffee shop and now a great, big, multi-million dollar company is going to move in and try to take all my business, which means I may have to shut down and sell my son Tweek into slavery.
TWEEK
Mwaaah! Slavery?
RICHARD
Yes, slavery.
STAN
[to Tweek] Wow, that sucks, dude.
RICHARD
They really have my balls in a salad shooter.
KYLE
We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.
STAN
Yeah.
MRS. TWEAK
Now, Tweek, how many times do we have to tell you? Your underpants are missing because you lose them, not because of underpants gnomes.
TWEEK
Uunnnnhh!
KYLE
Come on, you guys! We better get to work!
[Tweek and the boys leave the kitchen.]
RICHARD
Wuh-okay, but corporate takeovers is a much more fertile subject.
MRS. TWEAK
Honestly, Richard. I don't see why you have to preach to some eight-year olds.
RICHARD
Actually, honey, I think those little tykes are just what we need. I've got an idea.
[Later that night, in Tweek's room, the boys sip their coffee.]
KYLE
Man, this stuff is strong.
STAN
Kind of bitter.
TWEEK
[in a corner of the room, scared] What if my parents go out of business? Uh what'll I do?
KYLE
[going to him] Don't worry about it.
TWEEK
But we'll starve and die like dogs.
CARTMAN
Tweek, Tweek, you can always go on welfare. Look at Kenny's family: they're perfectly happy being poor and on welfare. Right, Kenny?
KENNY
(Fuck you!)
CARTMAN
Heheh, you suck, Kenny.
KYLE
Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up.
[Still later: 10:08p.m.. The boys are hyperactive.]
STAN
Aooooo!
KYLE
Woohoo!
KENNY
(Let me try! Let me try!)
STAN
Yeess, this stuff rocks!
KYLE
Totally, dudes! I feel awesome!
STAN
[running] Whoopee!
[Kenny jumps high enough to knock down the bedside lamp. The shade goes to the floor. 10:09 p.m.]
CARTMAN
[running around the rim of a throw rug like an Olympian] You guys! You guys! Seriously! I'm a sorcerer! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that.
KYLE
Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?
TWEEK
I just have grounds.
KYLE
Killer!! [goes for it and eats it raw]
CARTMAN
[rushing up] Ey, let me have some grounds. [take some, swallows, and throws up]
KYLE
Gross, Cartman. Whoopee!
[10:15 p.m. gives way to 3:26 a.m., which finds the boys sitting against the bed. Tweek is on it, and Cartman is passed out next to the toys, surrounded by pools of vomit. Kenny looks sleepy.]
KYLE
Hogh, my stomach hurts.
STAN
Yeah, mine too. I wonder why.
KYLE
[peeved] Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek.
TWEEK
Urgh. Uh maybe, maybe it was all in my head. Maybe I'm going insane! Oh no I'm going insane!
STAN
[cross] Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!
RICHARD
[checking] How's the report going, boys?
STAN
Bad!
RICHARD
Oh, do you need some more coffee?
BOYS
Eugh.
CARTMAN
No...more...coffee. Blech. [the vomit falls back on him and on the ground]
RICHARD
Well, boys, uh. I don't mean to pry, but, if you want it, I wrote your report for you.
ALL
[suddenly bright] You did?!
RICHARD
Yes, it's all about corporate takeovers. Of course, you don't have to use it.
STAN
[goes with Kyle to get it] No, we'll use it.
RICHARD
Alright. [Kyle takes it] And it can be our little secret about who wrote it, right?
[Tweek begins to hear some elfin music: "Time to go to work,"]
KYLE
Sure. ["work all night"]
RICHARD
Now, when you give the report, [Tweek gasps and points] just make sure that you read this part first, okay? [the gnomes open the door and enter:
"Search for underpants, hey
We won't stop until we have underpants
Yum tum yummy tum day"]
TWEEK
There they are!
RICHARD
[A gnome goes for Tweek's bottom drawer, opens it, and takes out some underpants.
"Time to go to work, work all night
Search for underpants, hey
We won't stop until we have underpants
Yum tum yummy tum day"]
And when you come up to do it a second time, really, really clear it up, I mean, um, really, really play the sympathy angle. They'll like that. They'll be calling you, and you'll get a passing grade for it.
TWEEK
["Time to go to work, work all night
Search for underpants, hey!"]
You guys, look! Look! You're missing it!
[the gnomes take off with two pairs of underpants:
"We won't stop until we have underpants
Yum tum yummy tum day!"]
TWEEK
Arrgghh! They took them again!
KYLE
[to Richard] Thanks, dude.
RICHARD
My pleasure. G'night, boys.
STAN
Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks!
TWEEK
Why do they torture me like this?! Why can't they leave me alone?!
KYLE
Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!
TWEEK
They took my underpants again! Soon they'll want my blood! Blood! Euuggh!
[South Park Elementary, the next day. The five-member South Park committee listens as Tweek's group speaks.]
KYLE
[haltingly] "And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America...
CARTMAN
[steps forward] What will become of the endeavoring American family?"
MR. GARRISON
[off to one side, notices the lack of fluency] I don't think they wrote this, Mr. Hat.
STAN
Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.
TWEEK
[throbs] Uurrgh!
KYLE
And that's our report, I guess.
MR. GARRISON
Well, boys, it's obvious you didn't even--
LADY MEMBER
Great job!
MR. GARRISON
[falling in] Yes, great job.
LADY MEMBER
Boys, you have really opened our eyes. We didn't even know this was happening.
CARTMAN
Neither did we.
LADY MEMBER
Well, Mr. Garrison, it looks like we were wrong about you. You really are teaching these kids something.
MR. GARRISON
Yeah, well, I don't want to sound like a dickhole, but I told you so.
LADY MEMBER
Aw, I am really moved. I say we follow these boys's cause. Let's join them in the fight against corporate takeovers! [the members stand] Lead the way, boys!
STAN
Huh??
TWEEK
Uunh, it's too much pressure!
[Harbucks is going up.]
POSTUM
[directing] Good! Good! Now, make sure that sign is really bright and flashy now.
MRS. TWEAK
My goodness. That's going to be a huge coffee house, honey.
RICHARD
Yes, it is. [places his hand over his groin] They really have my balls in a juice maker. [removes it as the boys stop by] Oh, hello, son, uh. How did your report go?
TWEEK
Waagh!
KYLE
I think it went really good. Those people really got into it.
RICHARD
Really?? Well, son, you might have just saved the family business. What do you have to say about that?
TWEEK
I need coffee.
RICHARD
I know how you boys feel. [walks to a cup on a stump] Sometimes a hot cup of French Roast Amaretto is just what a man needs to get him through the day. That smooth aroma and mild taste is what make Tweek coffee... [picks up the cup and places his left foot on the stump, right hand on his hip] uh very special. Special, like an Arizona sunrise or a juniper wet with dew. A light rain in the middle of a dusty afternoon or a hug from your dear old aunt-- [a chorus is heard].
TWEEK
Dad!
RICHARD
What?
TWEEK
The metaphors, man!
RICHARD
Oh, sorry. Here you go. [hands him the cup]
KYLE
Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee?
MRS. TWEAK
Liike, how do you mean?
KYLE
Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous.
TWEEK
Agghh!
MRS. TWEAK
[holding a bag of Tweekers BLEND] Oh, that. He has ADD, attention deficit disorder. That's why he's so jittery all the time.
[The town commitee arrives.]
LADY MEMBER
Mr. Tweek, we've only just heard.
RICHARD
Oh, hello committee members. What a surprise.
LADY MEMBER
So, this is the corporate bulldozer trying to push you off the map. [Harbucks, with four tables on the roof]
RICHARD
Yes. How did you hear?
LADY MEMBER 2
These boys did an excellent report for us this morning. They're so upset by this whole thing.
KYLE
My butt hurts.
LADY MEMBER
Don't worry, Mr. Tweek. This committee is not going to let you be run out of business by these bastards! Do you hear that? You're not gonna get away with this, you whore!
POSTUM
Excuse me?!
LADY MEMBER 2
Boys, we've talked it over, and we want you to take your case to the mayor!
STAN
Our case?
TWEEK
Uuhhh, no way, man! That is way too much pressure!
RICHARD
[dismissing his son's apprehension] Oh, you'll do fine, son.
LADY MEMBER 2
Come on, boys! Let's go!
CARTMAN
[pissed] Aw, man, this sucks!
[The boys begin to walk with the town committee.]
TWEEK
[fretting] Aaarrrnnn!
[City Hall. Mr. Garrison is present with the boys and the town committee.]
LADY MEMBER
...And we would have never even known that this was happening if not for these boys' excellent report.
MAYOR
You're telling me that students from Mr. Garrison's class actually did something that had some kind of relevance to the world?
LADY MEMBER
That's right.
[Garrison is shown.]
MAYOR
Mr. Garrison, the guy with the puppet?
LADY MEMBER
Yes!
MAYOR
Well, I must say, Garrison, perhaps you're not as stupid and crazy as I always tell people you are.
MR. GARRISON
Thank you, Mayor. I don't wanna sound like a dickhole, but I-
LADY MEMBER
Mayor, these boys want that Harbucks coffee shut down right now!
MALE MEMBER
Yeah!
LADY MEMBER 2
Yeah!
MAYOR
Well, I can't just shut them down, this is a free country.
LADY MEMBER
But they're ruining our city!
MAYOR
Look, the best I can do is create a proposition. We'll call it Prop. 10. The town can vote on it, and if it passes, we'll see what we can do.
BLOND MEMBER
Hooray!
THE OTHER MEMBERS
Hooray!
LADY MEMBER
[ecstatic] What do you say, boys? We're gonna pass a law!
STAN
Uh... Hooray.
MAYOR
So I guess you wanna do some campaigning. [Tweek hears the gnomes coming] You can do commercials and things like that, and then we'll have a vote in the middle of town. And obviously, if more than 50% of the people even show up...
["Time to go to work, work all night
Search for underpants, hey!
We won't stop until we have underpants
Yum tum yummy tum day
Time to go to work, work all night" The gnomes go up to Johnson and pull his underpants out]
TWEEK
Wagh!
MAYOR
["Search for underpants, hey
We won't stop until we have..." A gnome tosses the underpants to two others, who carry it away over their heads. They all leave]
...and care enough to want Harbucks out, then, they're out. So, good luck to you. [the town committee leaves]
TWEEK
Didn't you see them!?
MAYOR
Alright, what's next.
TED
Next is issue 37D, missing underpants. [hands the issue to her]
JOHNSON
Is it cold in here?
MR. GARRISON
Uh, boys, can I have a quick this and that with you? Boys, I don't know who wrote that report, but now that you've convinced everybody, you'd better stick with it. 'Cause if these people find out you didn't really write that paper, and I actually do get fired, then Mr. Hat is gonna do horrible things to you. [pretends Mr. Hat is saying something to him] Oh, not that, Mr. Hat! That's really horrible! Anyway, good luck passing your new law, boys.
TWEEK
Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna do, huh?!
[South Park Town Hall Meeting.]
HOST
Live, it's the South Park Town Hall Meeting on Public Access. Tonight's topic: Prop. 10.
[The audience claps.]
MEDIATOR
Should Harbucks be allowed to open a store in South Park? That's tonight's topic. On my left, five innocent, starry-eyed boys from Middle America. [shot of the boys] On my right, a big, fat, smelly corporate guy from New York.
AUDIENCE
Boo!
POSTUM
Hey, I'm not fat or smelly!
MEDIATOR
All right, Mr. Douchebag.
POSTUM
Postum!
MEDIATOR
Oh. Pardon me, Mr. Assface. Anyway, let's hear your side of the argument.
AUDIENCE
Boo!
POSTUM
My argument is simple. This country's founded on free enterprise. Harbucks is an organization that-
AUDIENCE
Hhssssssss!
POSTUM
An organization that prides itself on great coffee! We simply want tuh-- Oh, to hell with you!
MEDIATOR
[the hissing stops] Okay, ucka-fay. Now for the other side of the argument we turn to our young, handsome lads. [the boys stay silent] Boys, your thoughts. [Tweek twitches] Come on, boys, don't be shy. What's your principal argument?
[Nothing. A stern Mr. Garrison crosses his arms.]
KYLE
Uh...
STAN
Uh...
CARTMAN
This guy sucks ass!
AUDIENCE
Yeah! Yeah! Woo!
MEDIATOR
Great argument! You win, boys!
POSTUM
What?!
MR. GARRISON
[softly, relieved] That was close, Mr. Hat.
[The boys' first commercial, beginning with an American flag waving, filling the screen.]
VOICE-OVER
What is the future of America? Is it the money we make? [a $1 bill] The quests we conquer? [the Moon shot] No, it's children. [head shots of Tweek and the boys] So what do children have to say about Prop. 10?
KYLE
[screen right to screen left] I don't like big corporations.
STAN
[rising from the bottom] I like small businesses.
CARTMAN
[screen left to screen right] I believe in the family-owned enterprise.
KENNY
[dropping from the top] (In my family, it's a silly enterprise.)
TWEEK
[screen right to screen left] Aarrgghh!
VOICE-OVER
It's time to stop large corporations. Prop. 10 is about children. Vote Yes on Prop. 10, or else, you hate children. You don't hate... children... do you? Remember, keep American business small, or else. [the kids' heads combust and only their skulls are left in flames, with charred caps.] Paid for by Citizens for a Fair and Equal way to get Harbucks Coffee kicked out of town forever.
[The TV clicks off, and everyone is in the studio.]
LADY MEMBER
Well, what do you think?
RICHARD
Wow, it it's great!
LADY MEMBER
[confidently] Yes, it is. We'll put it on the air immediately.
RICHARD
What do you think, hon? [she crosses her arms and moves away him. He follows] Hon? What's the matter?
[Mrs. Tweak turns to him.]
MRS. TWEAK
I have a big problem with this.
RICHARD
What do you mean?
MRS. TWEAK
We are just using those boys for our benefit. They have no idea what they're saying.
RICHARD
But, kids are great to get people on our side.
MRS. TWEAK
You don't just throw a child in a political commercial to sell your beliefs. I won't be a part of this anymore. [walks out the door]
RICHARD
Honey, all's fair in love and war. [softly] And coffee. Hon? Hu-hon?
[Harbucks' grand opening. Protesters arrive.]
LADY PROTESTER
Take your corporate coffee and go back to New York City!
CROWD
Yeah!!
BLONDE PROTESTER
It's people like you who are ruining Main Street, USA!
[Postum looks out through the window.]
CROWD
That's right! Yeah!
LADY PROTESTER
How many Native Americans did you slaughter to make that coffee, huh?!
CROWD
[after a pause] Yeah!!
POSTUM
[inside] Damn, these people aren't buying any coffee! I'll have to try and appeal to the younger crowd.
[Later. The crowd now marches in front of Harbucks. To the right, Harbucks' mascot, wearing a fez, holds a tray of coffee cups topped with whipped cream before a boy.]
POSTUM
[the man in the camel] Hey, kids. I'm Camel Joe and I love a fresh cup of coffee. It's yum diddly-icious, and it makes you feel super! [a small boy is listening] I have a surprise for you: the new Kiddicino from Harbucks; more sugar and all the other goodies kids like with all the caffeine of a normal double latte.
[The kid reaches for one.]
KID'S MOM
[rushing up] No Billy, no coffee for you. [to Camel Joe] You should be ashamed of yourself, using cartoons to push caffeine on children!
POSTUM
[rips off the helmet] Why don't you go back to the hole you crawled out from, lady?!
RICHARD
[intervening] Uh, Mr. Postum, I'm afraid you've got a lot to learn about making coffee.
POSTUM
Oh, and you don't? Your coffee tastes like three-day-old moldy diarrhea!
RICHARD
Uh, I'm sorry to inform you that this town is having a vote tomorrow, and if the law passes, you're gonna be thrown out of town.
POSTUM
What?!
RICHARD
At five o'clock, the best coffee wins. Either your coffee, or a fresh, warm cup of... Tweek's coffee. [brings out a bag of Tweekers BLEND, then hugs it] Like an old sweater that keeps getting warmer with age, you can count on Tweek's coffee to start your day. [turns and walks away]
MAYOR
[arriving with her aides] Tomorrow, for the Prop. 10 vote, we'll set up ballot booths... here. [between the two coffee shops] All right, men, we'll throw up the stage here. Before the vote we'll get a band everyone likes, like uhhhh, like...
JOHNSON
Toto.
MAYOR
Like Toto. And then the Harbucks guy will have five minutes to speak and the boys will have five minutes to speak, and then the town votes.
MR. GARRISON
[standing with the boys in front of Tweek Bros.] Uh, boys, you better get your asses to work.
CARTMAN
What now?
MR. GARRISON
They're expecting you to give a big speech on corporate takeovers, and this time it has to last five minutes.
KYLE
Oh, God, when is this gonna end?
STAN
Your dad really screwed us, Tweek!
TWEEK
Jesus, dude! I'm to blame for all this! I'm to blame for everything!
[Tweek's house that night, Tweek's room. Tweek is on the floor and the others are on his bed.]
KYLE
So what are we gonna say?
CARTMAN
Why can't we just read the paper we wrote last time?
STAN
'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!
KYLE
Does anybody know anything about corporations? [the gnomes return, and Tweek gasps. The door opens and the gnomes enter, singing their theme:
"Time to go to work, work all night
Search for underpants, hey"]
TWEEK
["We won't stop"] Waagh!
CARTMAN
["until we have underpants"] I think my mom is a corporation.
STAN
["Yum tum yummy tum day!"] Yeah, that makes sense.
TWEEK
You guys! Sshhhh! ["Time to go to work"]
KYLE
Well, how about we just say, "corporates should be stopped"?
["work all night
Search for underpants, hey"]
STAN
How do we stretch that into five minutes?
TWEEK
They're taking my underpants!
["We won't stop until we have underpants
Yum tum yummy tum day"]
KYLE
[looking down] Will you stop with the underpants gnomes, Tweek?! We have to work here! ["Time to go to work"]
TWEEK
[points at the gnomes] Aaaggghhh! ["work all night
Search for underpants, hey"
They open the bottom drawer and go for the underpants]
STAN
What the hell? ["We won't stop"]
CARTMAN
["until we have underpants"] Well, I'll be damned.
TWEEK
["Yum tum yummy tum day!"] That's my last pair of underpants!
["Time to go to work, work all night
Search for underpants, hey..." The gnomes go for the door, and the boys hop off the bed to follow. One gnome stops and faces the boys]
KYLE
Sshh, don't scare him.
STAN
Hey there, little guy.
CARTMAN
Bad! [whacks the gnome with a stick]
KYLE
Cartman!
CARTMAN
What?!
KYLE
Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?!
CARTMAN
Well, look at him. He's all, you know, uh l-look at him. [whacks him again]
GNOME
Is that all you've got, pussy?
CARTMAN
What?! [advances]
STAN
Hey, he talks!
CARTMAN
Yeah, he called me a pussy! I'm not a pussy, you're a pussy!
GNOME
You're a pussy, pussy!
CARTMAN
Ey!
STAN
Dude, why are you taking Tweek's underpants?
KYLE
Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid.
TWEEK
Waggh.
GNOME
Stealing underpants big business.
STAN
Business? Wait, do you know anything about business?
GNOME
Sure, that's what gnomes do.
KYLE
Show us.
GNOME
O-kay. Follow me. [goes for the door]
CARTMAN
[muttering] Little pussy gnome. Don't call me a pussy, pussy gnome.
[The woods. The gnome leads them on to his cave.]
GNOME
Not much longer now.
CARTMAN
Oh, are you gonna take us to your little pussy house?
GNOME
No, pussy, I'm taking you to my village.
CARTMAN
Oh, your pussy village?
STAN
Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us?
GNOME
[reaches a tree, knocks on its base and a door opens] Follow me.
CARTMAN
[the boys look at him] I hope we're not wasting our time with this little pecker.
[Starbucks, early morn. Workers put on the finishing touches to the coffee store.]
POSTUM
Well, it looks like Harbucks will never make it in this town. [turns around] All right, boys, that's it. Pack it up, we're movin' out of town.
WORKER 1
Aw, but we just finished.
POSTUM
I know, but these folks obviously don't want us here.
WORKER 2
But what will become of us?
POSTUM
Oh, quit being so melodramatic, Sanchez. Jesus Christ!
[Underground. The boys are still following the gnome.]
STAN
Damn, dude, this place is huge!
[Before them is a pile of underpants as tall as a man. Some of them are colored.]
KYLE
Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass.
CARTMAN
[exhales] No it isn't, you guys!
GNOME
This is where all our work is done.
CARTMAN
So what are you gonna do with all these underpants that you steal?
GNOME
Collecting underpants is just phase 1. Phase 1: collect underpants.
KYLE
Sooo, what's phase 2?
GNOME
[has no response. Looks around, then calls out to the other gnomes on the underpants mound] Hey, what's phase 2?
GNOME 2
Phase 1: we collect underpants.
GNOME
Yeah yeah yeah, but, what about phase 2?
GNOME 2
[says nothing, then] Well, phase 3 is profit. Get it?
STAN
I don't get it.
GNOME 2
[walks up to a large chart] You see,
Phase 1: collect underpants. Phase 2: ... Phase 3: Profit.
CARTMAN
Oh, I get it.
STAN
No you don't, fatass!
KYLE
Do you guys know anything about corporations?
GNOME
You bet we do!
GNOME 2
Us gnomes are geniuses at corporations.
GNOMES
[three of them move a cart up a track]
Time to go to work, work all night
Se--
CENTER GNOME
[the cart falls off the track and on down] Jesus Christ, look out!
[The cart lands on Kenny.]
STAN
Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
KYLE
You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers.
GNOME
Holy shit! We've killed your friend!
STAN
Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed.
GNOME 2
Christ, we squished him like a bug!
STAN
Do you know anything about corporate takeovers?
GNOME
Well, we can explain that to you easily.
GNOME 2
Yes, for a price.
KYLE
What?
GNOME
You know.
STAN
Underpants?
GNOMES
Underpants!
[Harbucks, daytime. Prop. 10 supporters are out in force and Toto is performing.]
LADY MEMBER
[taking the stage] Toto, ladies and gentlemen!
[The band leaves.]
PROP. 10 SUPPORTER
Yeah, Toto! Whoo, Toto! Woo!
LADY MEMBER
All right. And now, before we all vote yes on Prop. 10, here to remind us why are the lovable, innocent children.
STAN
Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations.
SUPPORTER
Underpants gnomes?
KYLE
Big corporations are good!
SUPPORTER
What?
SUPPORTER 2
What's this?
SUPPORTER 3
Good? [the Lady Member is cross]
KYLE
Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup.
STAN
Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay!
[The crowd is stunned.]
TOWNSMAN
Ogh.
LADY MEMBER
That's not what you said last time.
KYLE
Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time.
[Gasps from the crowd.]
MR. GARRISON
You little turds!! You've ruined my life for the last time!!
[Officer Barbrady and another man haul him off. Mrs. Tweek claps for the boys and goes onstage.]
MRS. TWEAK
These boys are absolutely right. We've been using these poor kids to pull at your heartstrings for our cause, and it's wrong. We're as low and despicable as Rob Reiner. You keep protesting and complaining, but did any of you ever even bother to taste Harbucks coffee? [shot of the town committee. The crowd blinks] Harbucks coffee got to where it is by being the best. Don't you think you should at least try it?
[The crowd parts as Postum exits Harbucks with a tray of his coffee, then closes in to get the coffee. Some people taste it.]
TOWNSMAN
Hey, this is pretty damn good.
TOWNSMAN 2
Yeah, it doesn't have that bland, raw, sewage taste that Tweek's coffee has.
RICHARD
[comes over for a taste] Hey. Hey, that is good.
POSTUM
It's a French roast.
RICHARD
It's subtle and mild. Mild, like that first splash of sun on an April morning. This coffee is coffee the way it should be.
POSTUM
Hehey, no hard feelings, Tweek. You know, we still need someone to run this Harbucks coffeehouse. I'm sure it will make a lot of money.
RICHARD
Thank you, Mr. Postum, but I think we'll be happy with the money we make selling our son into slavery.
TWEEK
Aggghhh!
RICHARD
Just kidding, son.
[Everyone laughs. The gnomes come and remove the pants from a townsman behind Tweek's right shoulder.]
CARTMAN
I love you guys. [more laughter]
['[End of Gnomes. And what do the gnomes sing?
Time to go to work, work all night
Search for underpants, hey!
We won't stop until we have underpants
Yum tum yummy tum day!]']
End of Gnomes

synopsis:Kyle and Stan's friendship is strained after they discover a man frozen in an ice cave and argue about what is best for their "discovery".

script:Prehistoric Ice Man

[Cartman's house. A television is heard. The screen shows an Australian crocodile hunter narrating his adventures as a woman pilots his boat down a river.]
AUSSIE
As we steer our boat down [the boys are on the sofa looking at TV], looking for these dangerous predators... Boy, there's a king croc right here. [it slips into the water] He must be four meters; 12, 13 feet long at least. [it looks up at him] This croc has enough power in its jaws to rip my head right off.
KENNY
(Oh, no!) [tightens his hood up]
AUSSIE
I've got to be careful. So, what I'm gonna do is sneak up on it and jam my thumb in its butthole.
STAN
Holy crap. dude!
AUSSIE
If I get bit out here, I'm 200 kilometers from the nearest hospital: I'd better be real careful jamming my thumb in its butthole. [jumps in and grabs the crocodile] Oh, boy, it's pissed off now.
KYLE
Go, dude, go! [excited, the boys jump on the sofa]
AUSSIE
I'm gonna jam my thumb in its butthole now! This should really piss it off! [reaches down with his left thumb to do it. The croc jumps up in pain and drops] Oh, yeah, that pissed it off, all right! [the boys cheer] I've gotta be careful!
STAN
This guy rules!
KENNY
(He actually killed it!)
CARTMAN
I told you guys.
AUSSIE
[with left arm now bandaged and in a sling] Well! That was quite an angry croc! But I managed to escape with only a few bruises and a shattered left testicle. Next week we'll look for more of these beautiful creatures, so we can learn more about them by pissing them off immensely. Thanks for watching.
KYLE
[to Stan] Dude! Let's go look for crocodiles!
STAN
Yeah!
[The four of them hop to the floor and walk out the front door.]
[The woods. Cartman leads the boys up a hill. All are armed with water guns.]
CARTMAN
[with Aussie accent] There's bound to be some crocs up here. I'll use my croc call and try to bring 'em out. Brigeghus, brigeghus! Brig-!
KYLE
That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!
CARTMAN
[advancing towards Kyle] Ogh! Now I'm gonna kick my friend Kyle in the beanbag and see what happens, by crikey!
KYLE
Get away from me, Cartman! [backs away]
CARTMAN
Come 'ere, crocky.
KYLE
[trips over a rock and tumbles down the slope] AAAAAAAAAA!
[The boys follow him to a hole.]
STAN
Dude!
KYLE
[from the bottom of a dark shaft. His figure disappears] HELP! [thud]
STAN
Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle!
KENNY
(You bastard!)
CARTMAN
Well, he shouldn't have called me fat. [backs up]
STAN
Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!
CARTMAN
Well, screw him, he's dead! Let's go look for crocodiles! [turns around and walks off]
KYLE
You guuuys!
STAN
[to Cartman] Hey, he's still alive. [looks down and calls] Kyle, you okay? [Cartman returns and looks down]
KYLE
I think so. Is Cartman up there?
CARTMAN
I'm right here, Kyle.
KYLE
Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat.
CARTMAN
Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Say that to my face, pussy!
STAN
Can you climb back up, dude?
KYLE
I don't think so.
STAN
Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him.
CARTMAN
[moves away] Nah. Come on, guys. Let's go look for crocodi-iles.
[Inside a cave at the bottom of the shaft, Kyle awaits his rescue. Stan descends, spinning slowly as Cartman huffs outside.]
STAN
Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach! [his vomit goes everywhere] Bluchluchluchluch.
KYLE
Sick, dude! [wipes some off his cap]
STAN
Sorry. [Cartman slips a bit] What the hell are you doing, fat boy?! [drops to the cave ground and stands up]
CARTMAN
Screw you, hippie!
KYLE
Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here.
STAN
All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this?
[He walks to an ice pillar nearby. Kyle follows. Stan rubs some frost away from the pillar, revealing a frozen man.]
BOTH
AAAAAAAAAAAAA!
KYLE
Dude, it's a dude!
[Stan takes a closer look.]
STAN
He's like, some frozen guy.
CARTMAN
Come on, you guys, it's getting cold up here!
STAN
Shut up, Cartman! [to Kyle] Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends.
KYLE
Wow. Cool.
STAN
[to Cartman and Kenny] You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!
CARTMAN
Really? [to Kenny] Hey, there's a frozen guy down there.
STAN
[to Kyle] Help me chip some of the ice away.
CARTMAN
Hey you guys. This is just like that one movie, um, John Travolta and that, French chick were doing it, all summer long and went back to school and sang songs about "Greased Lightning." [no response] You know, that movie where Sandra Dee thinks she's all prissy, and then they try and try to get an abortion, but she doesn't have all the-
STAN AND KYLE
[frustrated by Cartman's talkativeness] CARTMAN, WILL YOU SHUT THE HELL UP AND GET SOME MORE ROPE?!
CARTMAN
Aww, screw you guys anyway!
STAN
Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?
KYLE
Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy!
BOTH
Hooray!
CARTMAN
For what?
[On the road towards town. Cartman pulls the frozen man on a sled while the other three push from behind.]
STAN
Where shall we bring it?
KYLE
I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it.
STAN
I think I'm going to name it Gorak.
KYLE
No, dude! We have to name it Steve.
STAN
[stops] Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve? [Cartman pulls, but isn't going anywhere]
KYLE
It's my name, and I found him.
STAN
You didn't find him, I found him.
KYLE
What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!
STAN
You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.
KYLE
Kenny, who found the ice man?
KENNY
(Well, I think you guys should name it Steve.)
CARTMAN
I think we're almost there, you guys.
[City Hall front lawn. The mayor is at the podium and a crowd of townspeople is watching.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Aalll right, people. The next order of business is a very serious matter. We need to vote on whether South Park should reinstate the death penalty or not. All those in favor, say "yippee."
SOME PEOPLE
Yippee.
TARDY MAN
Wait, what was that? I missed the question. Yippee! [raises both hands]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
All those opposed, say "nay."
OTHER PEOPLE
Nay.
TARDY MAN
Screw you! [punches the guy to his right]
MAN
Ey! Screw you! [hits the tardy man, and everyone starts fighting. The boys show up with the ice man]
STAN
Huh, excuse me?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Not now, kids. The town is having a very important debate on capital punishment. [quite vigorously, too]
KYLE
But we found a frozen ice man from the past! [all stop]
STAN
I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
KYLE
No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
What the hell is going on here?
KYLE
We came for our reward.
CARTMAN
Yeah, like the kid with the wallet.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[annoyed] Reward? What reward?
DR. MEPHESTO
[arriving] Mayor, I think the boys may have stumbled onto something here. You see, Mayor, frozen links are often found: dinosaur eggs, woolly mammoths. This specimen could be a missing link [close-up] in our evolution. If I can unfreeze the body, and perform an autopsy, I could learn much about this creature's people and its time.
MAYOR
Sure sure sure, be my guest, knock your socks off.
DR. MEPHESTO
Thank you, Mayor. Oh, and boys, I, I can't give you a reward for finding this creature, but if you'd like, I'll let you name him.
STAN
Really.
KYLE
Sweet. How about Steve?
DR. MEPHESTO
Steve it is.
STAN
Wait a minute! His name is Gorak!
DR. MEPHESTO
Come on, Steve. We've got work to do. [pushes Larry away with Kevin. Stan is not happy at Kyle's sleight of word] Unfreezing this body will be quite delicate work. We'll have to use the most advanced methods available.
[The South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch. Inside, Dr. Mephesto and Kevin use blow dryers on the ice man. Quite an advanced method.]
DR. MEPHESTO
This is very exciting. He could be a Neanderthal. Or an Australopithecus from the Paleolithic era. [turns off the blow dryer and picks up a flashlight to inspect the man] Do you see that, Kevin? These clothes are from Eddie Bauer. I haven't seen anybody wear clothes from Eddie Bauer since... 1996! [Kevin expresses shock] This is incredible! Think of all we can learn from this body! All that it can teach us! Let's just hope the press doesn't get wind of this right away.
[The lab door flies open and cameras flash all around. Officer Barbrady tries to hold the press back by barring entrance through the door.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Stand back, people. There's nothing to see here.
REPORTER
What about the prehistoric ice man?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh, yeah. There is that. [lowers his arms, and the press rushes in.]
REPORTER
Dr. Mephesto, could you please tell us what's going on?
DR. MEPHESTO
Ladies and gentlemen, we still have a lot of work to do. [the press mills around, taking pictures] But it is my opinion that this man has been frozen in time for over 32 months! [some reporters gasp] Yes, it's true, although at this early stage we know very little about this man or the time from which he comes.
[News 4 Special Report. The caption has a silhouette of a caveman stamped with a question mark.]
REPORTER
Fascinating news tonight from South Park. An ancient discovery of a prehistoric man actually frozen in ice. A team of scientists continues to try and unfreeze the body so that it can be autopsied, and studied. The caveman was discovered by Kyle Broflovski, who had this to say:
KYLE
[Stan and Kenny in the background] Well, I fell down this ice cavern, [Stan interrupts him with "la"s] and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope- [Kenny looks at Stan, and Kyle glances back]
REPORTER
The prehistoric ice man is thought to be from the late neo-post-Jurassic era, where he was probably part of a hunting and gathering tribe that lived on Waterston Street.
[The genetic engineering ranch.]
DR. MEPHESTO
That's it, Kevin. Now we can begin the autopsy.
LARRY
[stirs] Uuuurrr.
DR. MEPHESTO
Ugh? What's this?
LARRY
[stirs more] Mmmmm.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Holy crap! He's alive??
DR. MEPHESTO
That's impossible! [to Kevin] Do an EKG on him!
[Kevin hits Larry on the head with the hammer.]
LARRY
Uugh! [Raises his right arm to his head to soothe the pain]
DR. MEPHESTO
My God, he really is alive. The ice must have preserved him!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[alarmed] Well, quick, do something!
DR. MEPHESTO
No no, we've got to think this through. [takes the mayor aside] Mayor, this man has not been conscious for almost three years. He won't understand what he sees! He'll be frightened and confused!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Well, you just can't let him die.
DR. MEPHESTO
Perhaps death is better than the shock he will take trying to adapt to our time.
LARRY
Uh, ughn.
DR. MEPHESTO
[moves towards him] Oh my God. It looks as if he's about to speak!
LARRY
[eyes open] Where... where am I?
REPORTER 1
What?
REPORTER 2
What's he saying?
REPORTER 3
Is that English?
DR. MEPHESTO
What? You're, you're hungry?
LARRY
Where am I?
DR. MEPHESTO
You're, you're hungry?
LARRY
What's goin' on?
DR. MEPHESTO
Me friend. Friieend. Me friend. Ma-phes-to. Mah-phehs-to.
LARRY
Huh?
DR. MEPHESTO
Hawgh! If we could understand what he's saying, then maybe we could get some answers. [Kevin hits Larry a couple more times, and Larry soothes his head again] If only there was someone who could communicate with him on a level as primitive as his own, a mind like... a child.
[The boys walk along the curb on their was home.]
STAN
Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak.
KYLE
Gorak's a gay name.
STAN
No, it isn't!
KYLE
Why are you being such a dick?
STAN
I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!
KYLE
Nuh-uh!
OFFICER BARBRADY
[rushing up] Hello, children. Dr. Mephesto needs one of you to help him out in his lab with the prehistoric ice man.
KYLE
I'll go.
STAN
No, I'll go! I found him!
CARTMAN
Damn, I've never seen you guys fight like this!
OFFICER BARBRADY
All right, there's only one fair way to do this. Everyone stick out their potatoes. [thumbs come out] My mother and your mother were out hanging clothes. My mother punched your mother in the nose. What color blood came out? [Lands on Kenny]
KENNY
(Blue.)
OFFICER BARBRADY
B L O O uh oh-O spells "blue" and that means that you will go to the lab and help out Mephesto and then we can all go home and watch Murphy Brown. [The boys look confused]
[The genetic engineering ranch. Larry is now sitting up.]
DR. MEPHESTO
Steve. You-
LARRY
Where am I?
DR. MEPHESTO
Steeve. Steeeve. Steeeve. [the door opens, and the boys rush in] Oh good, you're here.
STAN
Oh my God, they revived Gorak.
KYLE
You bastards!
DR. MEPHESTO
Yes, and I need you to communicate with him. See if you can understand what he's saying.
[He takes Stan to Larry.]
STAN
Uh, hi.
LARRY
Hi.
DR. MEPHESTO
[rushing] What'd he say?
STAN
He said, "hi."
DR. MEPHESTO
Very interesting.
LARRY
Where am I?
DR. MEPHESTO
What??
STAN
He wants to know where he is.
DR. MEPHESTO
Tell him, tell him he's... home.
STAN
You're... home.
[Larry scratches his head.]
DR. MEPHESTO
In the year 1999.
LARRY
It's 1999??
DR. MEPHESTO
He's been frozen for the last 32 months.
STAN
Dude, you've been frozen 32 months.
DR. MEPHESTO
And we found you-
LARRY
What? Thirty-two months?!
DR. MEPHESTO
All right, all right, all-
LARRY
Aaaa! [throws over a tray]
DR. MEPHESTO
All right, all right, calm down.
LARRY
[panics] AAAAAAA!
DR. MEPHESTO
I think that's enough for today. [sedates him]
LARRY
Whoa, oh.
KYLE
Good job, dude! You freaked him out!
STAN
Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him.
[They face each other. Cartman looks on, between them.]
KYLE
Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!
CARTMAN
Sweet.
STAN
Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!
CARTMAN
Killer.
KYLE
Fine! [turns and walks away]
STAN
Fine! [turns and walks away]
CARTMAN
Fine.
[The genetic engineering ranch. A car is stationed outside. A finger presses the butt-shaped doorbell.]
AGENT
[one of three] Are you Alphonse Mephesto?
DR. MEPHESTO
The same.
AGENT
We understand that you are currently in possession of the prehistoric ice man from 1996.
DR. MEPHESTO
That's right.
AGENT
We would like to... [notices Kevin and stares] we would like to offer our services in your experiments.
DR. MEPHESTO
Oh? Where are you gents from?
AGENT 2
We are from the University, of... America.
DR. MEPHESTO
Well, there's not a lot to see, but... Come in. [opens the door and makes way for them] He's still not responding much to us; the shock is still settling in, [as he leads them, familiar animals can be seen in display cages: four-assed monkey, four-assed mongoose, four-assed ostrich] but we've made great progress now that he's in the habitat.
AGENT
Habitat?
DR. MEPHESTO
[they turn the corner into a darkened area] Yes. Kevin and I designed a habitat for Steve to live in that is completely like his own world. Everything is 1996-oriented.
[He turns on the light, and Ace of Base's "All That She Wants" blares from a stereo.]
AGENT
Amazing. He looks so much like us.
[Larry sits on a "Hunchback of Notre Dame" bed, with posters of "Fargo" and "Independence Day" on the back wall.]
DR. MEPHESTO
Yes, well, Kevin has done a lot of work in figuring out just how related to us Steve really is. He came up with this drawing:
[He holds up evolution of man drawing with "Steve" right before the modern man.]
AGENT
Dr. Mephesto, we realize that scientific study is expensive. We want to help you make this project more... lucrative.
DR. MEPHESTO
How would we do that?
AGENT
It's easy.
[Dr. Mephesto has opened up his ranch to the public. Viewers move down a moving sidewalk looking at the habitat and listening to Ace of Base's "The Sign". One viewer snaps a picture. Mephesto stands at a podium.]
DR. MEPHESTO
As you can see, the ice man is listening to Ace of Base, which was a very popular group during his era, and primitive drumming soothed his people's tempers.
[The boys appear on the sidewalk.]
STAN
He doesn't look very happy in there.
KYLE
No, he sure doesn't.
STAN
I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!
KYLE
Well, I was talking to Cartman, too!
CARTMAN
Damn, I'm pretty freakin' cool all of a sudden.
DR. MEPHESTO
Ah! Here we see the ice man trying to gain Internet access on the computer. The Internet was still not very big in his time, so the Web frightens and confuses him. [Larry throws the mouse away, then overturns the computer in a fit of rage. The viewers are alarmed as he moves towards the window] It's okay, he can't hurt you. [they chuckle in relief] It's one-way glass: he can't even see us. [Larry goes to the back wall] And now the ice man watches television.
[Click. The Aussie hunter is on TV. A grizzly bear is man-handling him.]
AUSSIE
This grizzly bear has the strength of over ten Morgan Freemans. I'm really pissing him off right now.
DR. MEPHESTO
[to the Agents] Wait. This could be dangerous.
AGENT
How so?
DR. MEPEHSTO
He's changing the channel. Something on the television could frighten and confuse him.
SPORTS REPORTER
And they've done it! The Atlanta Falcons are going to the Super Bowl!
LARRY
What?!! Rrrowrrr!
[He throws the TV off the cabinet and the crowd recoils. He senses the crowd, as he turns towards the glass and growls.]
STAN
[approaches with Kyle and Cartman] You guys aren't being very nice to my creature.
KYLE
He's my creature!
DR. MEPHESTO
He's fine, boys. And we're learning so much from him.
STAN
Let him out, dude. He's scared.
AGENT
He would be more scared on the outside. Do you think this stuff freaks him out? How do you think he'd react to what's happening in the government right now?
KYLE
But it isn't right!
AGENT 2
Little boy, sometimes, what's right isn't as important as what's profitable.
[Stan turns and walks to the window. He looks at "Steve" in empathy. More people come by to look at the ice man.]
KENNY
[notices the end of the sidewalk] (Uh oh. Ow!)
[He slips down between the sidewalk and the landing, and is flattened to death. His remains reappear at the other end.]
STAN
[gasps] Oh my God, they killed Kenny! [looks at Kyle]
KYLE
What?! I'm not talking to you! [walks away]
[Later that night.]
STAN
[a voice in the night] Gorak! [he rushes to the habitat, then heads to the access door] Gorak! Gorak! Are you there?
LARRY
Oh hi. What are you doing here? Viewing hours are 10 to 6.
STAN
I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out.
LARRY
Wow. That's really nice of you, kid. Thanks!
[A door opens off-screen, and Stan turns to see who it is. Kyle appears.]
STAN
What are you doing here?
KYLE
[reaches the access door] I'm here to bust out Steve.
STAN
What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.
KYLE
His name is Steve!
STAN
His name is Gorak!
LARRY
My name is Larry.
KYLE
Steve!
STAN
Gorak!
KYLE
Steve!
STAN
What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?!
KYLE
Because, he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man.
STAN
[looks up at Larry, who looks back] No he doesn't!!
KYLE
Does so!
LARRY
Uh. Hey, kids, could you just open the door so I can get back to my family?
STAN
I found him, I'm rescuing him!
[Kyle just opens the door.]
LARRY
[to Kyle] Thanks. [leaves]
STAN
You're a dick!
KYLE
You're a dick!
STAN
You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!
KYLE
You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!
STAN
Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock!
KYLE
Well, why don't we make 3 o'clock?
STAN
[hushed] Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3.
KYLE
[hushed] Oh yeah. [loudly] Fine, I'll kick your ass tomorrow, dick! [walks away]
STAN
I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean. [turns his head aside] Wait. [walks off in the opposite direction]
[The town, next day. Larry walks around and comes across "TELE'S," which shows a large-screen TV flanked by towers three TV's tall on each side. Marilyn Manson is on screen.]
MARILYN MANSON
I just smelled your britches and they're stinky
Stinky Britches
Stinky Britches
LARRY
Arrrggh!
[He crashes through the window, takes the large-screen TV and smashes it to the ground, then walks away.]
[The genetic engineering ranch.]
DR. MEPHESTO
He's gone! The ice man has broken out!
AGENT
No, that's impossible! How could he have?
DR. MEPHESTO
He must have used this... door.
[A door to the outside is open next to him.]
AGENT
Damn it, Damn it!
DR. MEPHESTO
We have to find him! He won't survive long out in the world!
AGENT
Yes, and if he isn't found, we won't be able to use him for our military war-
AGENT 2
Sshhhh!
AGENT
Right.
MEPHESTO
What?
AGENT 2
What?
AGENT
Nothing.
DR. MEPHESTO
No, what did you say? Uh, use him for what?
AGENT
[shrilly] Butlutlutlutlup!
[Mephesto just stares at him.]
AGENT 2
Dr. Mephesto, where could the creature have gone?
DR. MEPHESTO
I have no idea!
AGENT
We'll never track him down on our own. This calls for some special assistance.
[Larry knocks at a door at 1299 Waterston St. A woman opens the door.]
WOMAN
Can I help you?
LARRY
Leslie. It's me, Larry. [she stares back, blankly] Your husband?
LESLIE
Husband? You're not my husband.
LARRY
Think hard, Leslie. We used to be together, for over eight years?
WOMAN
I seem to remember a husband, but I think he was lost and never found on Kenosha Pass.
LARRY
That was me!
LESLIE
[a bit stunned] Oh.
BIG MAN
[appears behind her] Who is it, lover?
LESLIE
It's my former husband, who I had forgotten all about.
BIG MAN
Ooooo. [he and Larry check each other out] Well, sir, let me shake your hand. I'm proud to meet the man whose wife I'm currently sticking it to every night. [walks away]
LARRY
So you... remarried.
LESLIE
Yes, Lorry.
LARRY
Larry!
LESLIE
Uh, larry. Larry-y, you disap-peared. I waited for you to come home for over three days! I. I remember how cold and lonely the nights got. By the fourth day I knew: I had to move on.
LARRY
Didn't anybody send out a search party?
LESLIE
We did, Larry. We looked all afternoon. But we found nothing, no trace.
LARRY
Please, Leslie, I don't know where else to go. I'm confused.
LESLIE
Leslie, I'm with Buck now. [must be the big dude shown earlier]
LARRY
You're Leslie.
LESLIE
Right. I'm with Buck now. We have children together. [they appear] Calvin is eight, and little Buck is 13. I just can't up and leave them. I'm sorry.
LARRY
I'm sorry, too. I'll leave you alone. [walks away. She closes the door, and he stops] Eight and thirteen? [wrong family?]
[Stan's house. He and Cartman are out in the backyard. Cartman is dressed as an outback hunter.]
CARTMAN
Well, I don't see any crocs out here.
STAN
Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!
CARTMAN
[walks over to a cat nearby] Or, in other words, I'll let this jagu-ar bop me in the face and see if it hurts. Come on, jagu-ar, let's see what you've got! [the cat leaps up and scratches his face] Aaah! Ow, son of a bitch!
[He feels the two scratches on his left cheek.]
STAN
You suck as a best friend, Cartman!
CARTMAN
You son of a bitch cat!
STAN
[walks to Larry, bathing in a tub out in the open with the garden hose, and looks at him for a while] What are you doing, Gorak!
LARRY
[turns to see him] I can't live in your time. I'm freezing myself again.
STAN
Wow, that sucks, dude.
LARRY
Tell me about it. I've been doing this for over three and a half hours now, and only my toes are starting to ice over.
KYLE
[rushing in with a travel guide] Steve, wait!
STAN
What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!
KYLE
I've got something to show Steve, dick!
STAN
Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick!
KYLE
Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look!
LARRY
What is that? [drops the hose]
KYLE
It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see? [opens the guide to show Des Moines's assets] Everybody looks like you do. [flips the page] Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you.
[He hands him the guide to look over.]
SORRY
[closes it with affection] Home.
KYLE
Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!
STAN
Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!
KYLE
No you don't, butthole!
[A helicopter is heard over the neighborhood, and Larry sees it. Dogs begin barking.]
LARRY
They're coming for me!
STAN
Come on! [the three run away]
CARTMAN
Yeah, you jagu-ars can be real mean. I'm gonna have to smack it in the face.
[Mephesto and his agents arrive.]
DR. MEPHESTO
Was the ice man here?
CARTMAN
He might have been, by crikey.
AGENT
We have to get him back. Well, can you do it?
AUSSIE
[!] Sure I can! I can hunt down anything!
CARTMAN
Wow! Kick ass!
[South Park Train Station. People are waiting to depart, and a train is pulling in.]
STAN
We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please.
CLERK
Des Moines? What the hell for?
KYLE
We have to get our friend, Steve-
STAN
My friend, Gorak!
KYLE
-to Des Moines, or else he's gonna melt away.
STAN
No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!
KYLE
Frosty, Steve, whatever.
CLERK
Well, okay. Uh, I'll find him a seat.
[He sets to writing the ticket. The boys soon look at the clock on the wall.]
STAN
Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock.
KYLE
Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now.
LARRY
Okay, boys. Thanks.
[The boys walk off, then stop. Stan turns around.]
KYLE
Okay. First one to die, loses.
STAN
'K.
KYLE
Okay. [neither one moves]
STAN
O-okay.
KYLE
So, here we go. [puts up his fists]
STAN
'K [puts up his fists]
KYLE
Go. [they lock fists and start fighting]
[The woods. The Aussie leads Mephesto, Agents, Barbrady, and other cops, in a hunt. He runs across a set of tracks.]
AUSSIE
Wait a second. [bends down, picks up some snow and sniffs at it. Cartman imitates] I think he came through here recently.
CARTMAN
Yeah, I think the same thing.
AGENT
Well, where the hell is he? We've got to get him back to the lab.
DR. MEPHESTO
He can't function out here in our time!
AUSSIE
[rising] Calm down, calm down.
CARTMAN
Yeah, calm down, calm down, you sons of bitches.
AUSSIE
Wait! Look!
DR. MEPHESTO
Is it him?
AUSSIE
No! It's a Rocky Mountain rattle snake. [curled up on a stump, it hisses] This is the most poisonous snake in this entire region. [quietly] Now, what I'm gonna do, is carefully sneak up on him, and jam my thumb up his butthole. Crikey! [leaps on the snake] Oh, this snake is really pissed!! I'm gonna jam my thumb in his butthole now! [his thumb sticks high in the air, then drops] Awww, yeah, that pissed it off all right!
DR. MEPHESTO
Does he always do this?
AGENT
[now cross, in a low voice] Yeah.
CARTMAN
I'm gonna go jam my thumb in some'in's butthole now.
[The train station. Stan and Kyle are still fighting.]
STAN
[punched by Kyle] Ow!
KYLE
[punched in return] Ow! [he throws Stan down]
STAN
Watch my coat, dude.
KYLE
Oh.
LARRY
[walks up] I got my ticket.
STAN
Huh? [both look at Larry]
LARRY
I have to go to Platform B.
KYLE
[blinks, then] Oh. Okay, it's over this way.
[He leads him there with Stan. Larry takes a seat on a bench, and Stan and Kyle resume fighting.]
AUSSIE
[shows up at the ticket booth with the hunting party] The trail ends here.
AGENT
The train station? Then he's trying to go somewhere.
DR. MEPHESTO
[to the clerk] Have you seen a man who looks similar to us, but with a thicker brow and an apish nose?
CLERK
What the hell are you talking about?
DR. MEPHESTO
An ice man, a man from the past. We must find him. Now, where is he?!
[Platform B. Larry has gotten on the train, and the boys see him off. They get back to fighting.]
LARRY
Well, this is it. I'm going back to my time. Thanks again, boys.
STAN
[panting] No problem, Gorak.
KYLE
Later.
LARRY
You boys have really shown me the true meaning of friendship. You didn't care about anything but my happiness. You put me in front of yourselves, and that's what real friendship is all about.
STAN
Yup.
KYLE
Uh huh.
LARRY
After being frozen, I've learned that all a person has in life is family. And friends. If you lose those, you have nothing. So friends are to be treasured, more than anything in the world!
STAN
[panting] Right on.
KYLE
Cool.
LARRY
Goodbye, boys. Goodbye, friends!
[The train pulls away. The boys watch it leave, then resume fighting.]
DR. MEPHESTO
[rushing up] Where is he? Where is Steve?!
[Kyle and Stan butt heads and remain eye-to-eye.]
STAN
His... name... is... Gorak!
KYLE
His name... is Steve!
AGENT
The train! [it passes the water tower]
DR. MEPHESTO
We've got to stop it!
AUSSIE
No worries. [cocks his rifle and goes after Larry]
AGENT
Let's get him! [the party gives chase]
STAN AND KYLE
No! [they stay behind, for a moment]
[The hunting party is now on the tracks chasing the train.]
AGENT
We've gotta stop that train!
AUSSIE
Come back here, you! [jumps onto the caboose landing]
KYLE
Steve! Steve, look out!
STAN
They're after you!
[Larry looks out his window.]
AUSSIE
Oh, he's a wily one!
[He looks over the railing and sees Larry, then shows him his thumb and smiles.]
LARRY
Oh, poo!
KYLE
Steve, look out!
[Mephesto and the Agents have reached the engine.]
AUSSIE
[meeting Larry in his car] Notice the dilated pupils of this prehistoric man. A sure sign the prey is frightened. As well as he should be, as I will now jam my thumb up his butthole.
LARRY
Huh? [the Aussie pounces on him] Whah?!
AGENT
[reaches for the conductor's door] Stop the train!
CONDUCTOR
Hey, who are you?
AGENT
I said, stop that train!
CONDUCTOR
Yes, hello. I see you.
CARTMAN
They're all movin' pretty fast, but I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey.
[Atop the train, Larry and the Aussie wrestle.]
LARRY
[pins the Aussie] I've got you pinned. I win.
AUSSIE
[reverses the pin] Now I've got you pinned. I win!
[On the tracks, Stan and Kyle try to keep up.]
CONDUCTOR
[ducking gunshots from the Agent] Whoa!
AGENT
[a helicopter comes into view and descends] Hey, it's okay! The helicopter is here! [into a communicator] Go get him, boys! [the pilot acknowledges] Cut him off!
LARRY
[pinned on his stomach, his butt in the air] Nooo!
AUSSIE
Now for the coup de gras. I'll just... get my... thumb up... here.
LARRY
[lets out a long, painful] Oohh!
[The helicopter lands in front of the train, but the train rolls on.]
PILOT
Aah, the train's not stopping. [it gets closer...] It's not stopping! [...and closer...] AAAAAAAA!
[Impact, but the train's the one that gets ruined.]
AUSSIE
[thrown towards the helicopter] Holy bum-!
[The blades chop him up.]
STAN
[catching up] Where's Gorak??
PILOT

[The cow sits on Cartman, forcing his gun to the ground, then stands up with Cartman stuck up its ass.]
CARTMAN
