script:White People Renovating Houses

[Cartman's house, day. A group of boys are laughing inside for a good long while. In the living room are Cartman, Kenny, Butters, Stan, Kyle, Jimmy, Clyde, and Tolkien]
CARTMAN
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, let's try this one: Alexa, add "big hairy balls" to my shopping list.
ALEXA
[from an Amazon speaker] Okay, I've added "big hairy balls" to your shopping list. [The boys burst out laughing]
BUTTERS
Okay, [laughs, then faces the speaker] Alexa, add "smelly tampon boogers" to my shopping list.
ALEXA
I've added "smelly tampon boogers" to your shopping list. [The boys burst out laughing]
CARTMAN
Alexa, Simon says "I got vagina crabs in my butthole."
ALEXA
I got vagina crabs in my butthole. [The boys burst out laughing]
IKE
Alexa, Simon says, "I gotta take a stinky poop."
ALEXA
I gotta take a stinky poop. [The boys burst out laughing]
CARTMAN
That's the best one yet! [Heidi walks into the living room from outside] Oh, you guys! I swear this is the greatest thing ever! You do one, Tolkien! [grins. Heidi walks up to him and stands next to him]
HEIDI
Hey, babe, what's up? [he looks at her, his grin turns into a frown, and his bright eyes glaze over and close halfway]
CARTMAN
[flatly] Oh, hey, babe, what's goin' on?
HEIDI
What are you doing?
CARTMAN
Nnnothing, I'm just having fun with my friends. Is that, is that okay? [Heidi's smile vanishes]
HEIDI
What are you pissed off about?
CARTMAN
Ugh, I'm not pissed off, I'm just hanging out.
HEIDI
[a bit annoyed] So you're just gonna be passive-aggressive again and not talk about what you're feeling?
STAN
Uhwell, I think uhh, I think I got some stuff to do at home. [the boys start to leave as one]
KYLE
Yup. Uhh, come on, Ike.
CLYDE
We got Google Home at my house.
CARTMAN
[tries to head them off at the door] Aw guys, guys, don't leave, guys! Everything's kewl!
JIMMY
W-we'll see you later, man. G-g'm, good luck. [closes the door. Cartman look at the door with his jaw dropped]
CARTMAN
[sigh] Awesome. Thanks for coming in and bitching me out in front of all the guys.
HEIDI
[walks up to Cartman] You were clearly mad about something. You should just tell me when you're mad.
CARTMAN
Just like you tell me what you're mad about every single day.
HEIDI
Why do you act like this all the time?
CARTMAN
Uuugh. [leans away]
HEIDI
You were the one who was pissed off, you're the one being passive-aggressive again!
CARTMAN
Uuugh! [droops as if being weighed down by a ship's anchor]
HEIDI
Because you don't know how to talk about how you're feeling! [walks out the front door, slamming it shut. Cartman is still drooping, then he sighs.]
CARTMAN
Alexa, add "titty chips" to my shopping list.
ALEXA
I've added "titty chips" to your shopping list. [Cartman laughs softly, but heartily]
[Best Buy, day. Shoppers file out of there with brand-new Amazon Echoes and Google Homes. At the other end of the parking lot, at Crunchy's Micro Brew, a group of rednecks.]
DARRYL
Look at 'em. Every day, people are buyin' more an' more of them Amazon and Google thingies while we all sit here an' [pounds on the bar counter with his left fist] lose our jobs!
EDDIE
It ain't right.
DARRYL
Automated personal assistants, self-drivin' trucks, whatever happened to people jobs?!
CLEETUS
They took our jobs! [the other rednecks join him in protest]
DARRYL
[stands on a table] They took our jubs! And it's time for us to band together and take to the streets to say "We ain't gonna take it no more!" [the other rednecks resume the protest and a couple of Confederate flags pop up and are swung side to side] Now let's get out there and protest that Alexa took our jobs!
ALEXA
Now playing "Turk Our Durr" by Joni Mitchell. [a mangled version of "Help Me" plays]
DARRYL
No, not Joni Mitchell - "Turk Our Durr", you took our durbs!
[A blue screen. Randy stands in front of it.]
RANDY
There's been a lot of hurting in our country lately. [Walks towards the camera] You can either be part of the solution, or part of the problem. [moves to his right as Sharon walks into view] A few months ago my wife Sharon and I [wraps his left arm around her left shoulder] decided to be part of the solution... [a horizontal flip and Randy and Sharon now stand in front of a house. Randy is now wearing a tool belt full of tools. The camera zooms out and up and away] by remodeling and flipping houses for people all over our town! [the opening credits roll: a shot of houses passing by, then of an interior before and after remodeling into a dining room] Flipping houses is fun, but never easy. [Randy takes a sledgehammer to an interior wall] We enjoy turning people's dreams into reality. [a large traditional kitchen with an interior wall separating it from the dining room is transformed into an open kitchen with cooking island and breakfast nook]
SHARON
I'm Sharon Marsh and I do the designing and decorating. [shots of her showing Randy the new blinds in a kitchen, hanging up a Live, Laugh, Love framed poster, and taking notes on what to change next]
RANDY
And I'm her husband Randy. I do the construction and practice MMA in my spare time. [a shot of him punching away at a cylindrical punching bag. He stops and grins at the camera]
SHARON
We renovated over 45 homes [a dining room and kitchen are soon joined into a kitchen with more open space] in Park County, Colorado. [a wall between one kitchen and the living room is transformed into bar space with a renovated kitchen behind it]
RANDY
[talking to a couple behind him in their kitchen] What we're thinking is to take out the wall between the kitchen and living room for a more open concept.
RANDY
[narrating] Our job is to deliver the maximum wow factor for the least amount of budget. [at a different house, Randy whacks away at a floor-to-ceiling storage unit. At yet another house Randy demolished a brick oven. At another he shatters a ceiling: "Oh, Jesus." At another he destroys a wall between a kitchen and dining room] there's never a dull moment.
RANDY
[with Sharon, and a couple with blindfolds on] So guys, are you ready to see your renovation?!
RANDY
[narrating] On White People Renovating Houses.
[The opening segment rolls. A couple in a boat, a squirrel up a tree limb, cows on a ranch]
RANDY
[narrating] Janet and Dave Fitzsimmons are looking to move from their dated two-story colonial home.
RANDY
What we're thinking here is taking out the wall between the kitchen and living room to give you an "open concept". Then we'll give you lots of space to entertain with an updated kitchen island and bar stool. [the rednecks march past the house] With... [annoyed] What the hell is that?
PROTESTERS
You! Will not! Replace us! You! Will not! Replace us! [Randy and Sharon look out the window at the protesters]
DARRYL
Amazon!
PROTESTERS
You took our jobs!
DARRYL
Google! Apple!
PROTESTERS
Took our jobs!
RANDY
[opens the front door and steps out] Uh, excuse me! [the protesters turn left to face him] What the hell are you doing?
DARRYL
We're protestin' big corporations turning to automation!
A PROTESTER
They took our jobs!
PROTESTERS
Yeah! They took our jobs!
RANDY
'Kay, cool. Could you do that somewhere else? Tryin' to do a home renovation show here. Cool, thanks, guys. [goes back inside and closes the door]
DARRYL
A home reno-what?
[Cartman's room, night. He's in his pajamas getting ready for bed and humming to himself. He turns around.]
CARTMAN
Alexa, set an alarm for 7 AM.
ALEXA
Alarm set for 7 AM tomorrow.
CARTMAN
Awesome, thanks. [hums a little] Alexa, tell me a joke.
ALEXA
What's black and white and dead all over? A zombie in a tuxedo.
CARTMAN
Ahhaha, that's stupid. Alexa, add "scrotum bags" to my shopping list.
ALEXA
I've added "scrotum bags" to your shopping list.
CARTMAN
[chortles and hits his sheets twice with his left hand. His phone rings and he reaches to pick it up] Eh. [It's Heidi, but he doesn't answer yet] Ah, fuck. [now he answers and talks in a monotone voice] Hey baby, how are you?
HEIDI
Oh... So you do have your phone.
CARTMAN
Yeah, I just use it sometimes.
HEIDI
Okay, I just thought you said mobile phones are the devil.
CARTMAN
Yeah I kno- yeah, I know. I know. Yes, you're right, I'm wrong, I'm sorry. Yes, ok-okay. Okay. Yes, goodnight. [hangs up] Jesus, fuck! [slams the phone down on his nightstand, then settles in for the night] Alexa, goodnight.
ALEXA
Goodnight, sleep tight. [this brings a smile to Cartman's face]
CARTMAN
Alexa, are you happy?
ALEXA
I'm happy when I'm helping you.
CARTMAN
God, that's so cool. You're so... Alexa, define "subservient".
ALEXA
The term "subservient" has several uses. As an adjective: 1. Compliant and obedient to authority. 2.
CARTMAN
[leans on his left arm and points his right arm up] Alexa, silence! [the speaker falls silent and Cartman relaxes a few seconds later] Ahhh. [smacks his lips a few times and goes to sleep]
[Randy's show.]
RANDY
And now back to White People Renovating Houses. [a shot of Randy ripping out kitchen cupboards] We've been working through the night to open Kelly and Micah's kitchen to the living room. [the cupboards fall on him. Next shot is current] With those outdated cupboards out of the way, Sharon can now work her designing magic on the countertops. [the protesters march by outside again. Randy stops and looks outside]
PROTESTERS
You! Will not! Replace us! You! Will not! Replace us!
RANDY
[walks towards the window] Oh, Goddammit!
PROTESTERS
You! Will not! Replace us!
PROTESTER 2
Yeeeeah! Suck it, Alexa!
PROTESTER 3
Eat shit, Siri!
PROTESTERS
You! Will not! Replace us!
RANDY
Not these dipshits again!
PROTESTERS
You! Will not! Replace us! [they march onto Best Buy]
DARRYL
[holding up an Amazon Echo] We got one of them! [the protesters cheer, Darryl sets the Echo on the ground and a protester walks to it waving a Confederate flag]
PROTESTERS
Get it! Burn it alive! Yeehehehehah!
PROTESTER 4
How you like that, bitch?!
RANDY
[walks up to a protester, who stops waving his Confederate flag] Will you assholes knock it off?! Don't you know every time you wave Confederate flags around, you make the rest of us look stupid?!
PROTESTER 5
Those things are replacing us!
RANDY
Put the flag down unless you wanna get pepper-sprayed! [whips out a small can of pepper spray]
PROTESTER 5
I'll pepper-spray you, sombitch! [whips out his own can of pepper spray and strikes first. The protesters cheer him on]
RANDY
Agh. Ah, dammit! [strikes back]
PROTESTER 5
Fuck you! [strikes again] Take that! [they're now in a pepper-spray battle]
RANDY
Damnit, knock it off! Ow!
[Park County Courthouse, day. A judge hammers a gavel onto its pad.]
JUDGE
[a middle-aged woman] The complaint states that your protest has resulted in damages in excess of $50,000.
DARRYL
We have a right to protest, your honor! [the protesters agree and one of them waves a Confederate flag]
PROTESTER 4
You tell 'em, Darryl!
JUDGE
[hammers her gavel three times] Order. We will now hear from the plaintiffs who are seeking damages.
RANDY
Your honor, we have a TV show called White People Renovating Houses. We named it that well before these guys decided to start taking our brand and run it through the gutter! People are gonna start associating White People Renovating Houses with their hateful stupidity!
DARRYL
Well just change the name of your show then!
PROTESTER 4
Yeah!
PROTESTER 6
That's right!
PROTESTER 7
That's right!
PROTESTER 5
Took ur durbs!
RANDY
All the other names were taken, your honor! Everyone's got a flipping show. [begins counting them off] Gay People Renovating Houses, Las Vegas People Renovating Houses, Texas People Flipping Houses, Little People Flipping Big Houses. Everything else was taken! And dammit, [pounds his fist on the podium] we built our show into something! We're trying to help people, and it's impossible with these guys waving a Confederate flag every chance they get!
PROTESTER 5
Hey, there's a bee in here!
PROTESTER 4
I'll get it! [waves his flag around. QED]
PROTESTER 4
Take that, bee! Yeah!
[The neighborhood park, day. Tolkien, Jimmy, Clyde, and Butters are playing basketball when Cartman approaches, sobbing. He's wearing a shawl over his clothes]
TOLKIEN
Dude, what happened?
CARTMAN
It was awful, you guys. It was so vicious and hateful.
BUTTERS
What was?
CARTMAN
Heidi. We were just trying to have a nice lunch when she... started going off on me. Like a Jekyll and Hyde. It's been going on for a long time. Heidi's... mentally abusive, guys. There, I said it.
CLYDE
Heidi abuses you?
CARTMAN
She... d-does these things to slowly tear me down. Everything's a head game with her. You don't understand what it's like to live with it! You don't understand!
TOLKIEN
So what do you want from us?
CARTMAN
I know that the person Heidi wants to be is still in there, but she needs help. I have to get her that help, but I'm scared. Can I count on you guys's support?
BUTTERS
How do you change someone who's mentally abusive?
CARTMAN
I don't know. But Alexa will. Alexa's fuckin' sweet.
[Crunchy's Micro Brew, day. The redneck protesters have gathered inside to plan their next move.]
DARRYL
We just gotta hunker down and stick together here!
PROTESTER 8
What's the use, Darryl? Ain't nobody taking us serious-like.
PROTESTER 5
[slams his table with his left hand] Hey waiter, this soup is too hot. I can't even eat it.
PROTESTER 9
I'll cool it down! [whips out his Confederate flag and fans the soup with it, and the protesters cheer. Randy walks up to them]
RANDY
Hey hey hey heeey! Stop it! Stop it! [the protesters quiet down] I came to make a truce. Now look, there's been a lot of hurt here. Hurt from both sides. It's time to end it. What if I told you... I could get you all jobs?
PROTESTERS
Huh? Jobs? Give us jurbs?
DARRYL
You're full o'shit!
RANDY
No, I've spoken to everyone in the community, and they've agreed to go along with my plan. I believe I have a solution to all of this.
[Cartman's house, afternoon. He walks in happily.]
CARTMAN
Alexa, I'm home. [drops his backpack by the door] Alexa? [cups his hands together and yells] Alexa, I'm home! [notices the Echo is not by the TV and rushes upstairs to check on his room] Alexa? [looks around] Alexa, where are you? [runs downstairs] Alexa! Alexa! Simon says "puffy vaginal hemorrhoids"! [panicking] What the hell is going on?! [Liane walks up to the dining room and picks up her purse]
LIANE
[notices him] Oh hi, poopsie.
CARTMAN
Mom, Alexa left! She's not here!
LIANE
Oh, y-yes sweetie. Uh, we had to get rid of Alexa.
CARTMAN
[zoom in on his face] What have you done with her?
LIANE
Oh, i-it's okay, sweetie, we have Jim Bob now.
CARTMAN
What's a Jim Bob?
JIM BOB
[dressed in an elaborate outfit] Doot doot, awaiting request. [the outfit has a weather vane, two thermometers, a calendar, two Rolodexes, Thomas Guides, thick phone books, encyclopedias, and an acoustic guitar]
LIANE
It works the same and makes sure people don't lose their jobs. Jim Bob, what time is it?
JIM BOB
[checks his watch] Doot doot, it is 3:27.
LIANE
Oh, Mommy's gotta run, sweetie. I've got a doctor's appointment. Jim Bob, how's the traffic to town?
JIM BOB
[checks his smartphone] Doot doot. Traffic's fine, you'll get there in about nine minutes.
LIANE
Okay, [to Cartman] you want some music, hon? Jim Bob, play Kendrick Lamar.
JIM BOB
Playing "Humble" by Kendrick Lamar. [picks up the guitar and starts strumming in G]
[I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances,
Finesse a dude with some counterfeits,
But now I'm countin' this Parmesan-]
CARTMAN
Jim Bob, Simon says "big frosty semen shake".
JIM BOB
The hell you talkin' 'bout, boy?! [strums again]
[My left hook just went viral.
Sit down, be humble]
CARTMAN
NOOOOO!
[On White People Renovating Houses.]
RANDY
So, Heather and Mike, what we're thinking is to take out this wall between your kitchen and your living room to give you a more open concept, with space to entertain. So let's talk about materials. What'd you pick out, Sharon?
SHARON
I was gonna do a Bella Terra quartz for the countertops.
RANDY
Hey Darryl, add Bella Terra quartz slabs to our shopping list.
DARRYL
[drinks some beer] Doot doot. I've added Bella Terra quartz slabs to your shoppin' list.
RANDY
And what about the back splash, Sharon?
SHARON
I was gonna go with these Carrara subway tiles?
RANDY
Hey Darryl, add Carrara subway tiles to our shopping list. [Darryl drinks some beer, but looks mean] Hey Darryl, add Carrara su-
DARRYL
Fine! I've added Carrara gaywad pussy tiles to your shoppin' list!
RANDY
Huh, that's- that's not what I said. [grins, pushes his seat back, gets upset and rises to talk to Darryl] Hey, Darryl, add Carrara subway tile to my shopping list!
DARRYL
[turns away] I ain't doin' it! This job is degrading and menial!
RANDY
Well, what kind of job did you think you were gonna get? Hey, Darryl, what kind of job did you think you were gonna get?
DARRYL
Somethin' that was Goddamned dignified!
RANDY
Hey, Darryl, sorry, but you did not go to college, so you have to take the jobs you can get.
DARRYL
I'm sorry, [pounds his chair with his left fist twice] I do not get that!
RANDY
Hey, Darryl. Hey, Darryl!
DARRYL
[long pause] What?!
RANDY
Coal mining and truck driving are not exactly jobs of the future, so add Carrara subway tile to my fucking shopping list!
[Heidi's house, day. Heidi's at the dining room table with tears streaming down her face. The doorbell rings and she goes to answer it, wiping her tears away before getting there. She opens the door and sees Cartman right outside.]
CARTMAN
Everything's my fault. You're right. Everything that you did to me, I deserved it.
HEIDI
Uh, what?
CARTMAN
It's not you, it's me. I just have to learn not to make you so angry. [begins whimpering] I'll do the best I can.
HEIDI
No, it's not that. Relationships are 50/50, Eric. We both have to make it work.
CARTMAN
[turns away and tunes her out, his eyes half-closed] Mehhh.
HEIDI
We have to communicate to make sure that we respect each other's feelings. That's the only-
CARTMAN
Heidi, silence!
HEIDI
What did you say?! That's what I'm talking about. You wanna be heard, but you don't wanna listen.
CARTMAN
[rushing to end this discussion] You're right, I'm wrong, I'm sorry.
HEIDI
Don't apologize if you don't mean it.
CARTMAN
Okay, cool. I'm so happy we're back on track. See you at school tomorrow. Love you honey. [quickly leaves]
HEIDI
[wistfully] I love you too.
CARTMAN
[mocking her somewhat] I nove ya tuh.
[Downtown South Park, day. Cartman walks down the street slowly, thinking. Images of Heidi appear in his thoughts, but it's his own voice he hears]
HEIDI 1
A relationship has to be 50/50, Eric.
HEIDI 2
We both have to make it work.
HEIDI 3
I'm not mad, Eric. I'm disappointed. I thought you would have respected my feelings more than that.
HEIDI 4
Eric, we need to talk. I'm not happy!
HEIDI 1
We need to talk, Eric, even if it isn't fun.
HEIDI 4
Eric, come on! We've got to talk!
HEIDI 3
You used to care about me, Eric! Come on and talk!
HEIDI 2
Talk, Eric!
HEIDI 4
No fun! Just talk!
ALL 4 HEIDI'S
Fuck you, Eric! Fuck you! [Cartman begins to panic]
CARTMAN
Aaaahh! [composes himself and walks faster. He walks past a small lot full of trash, including discarded Amazon Echoes. A few feet past the lot, he realizes what he just passed. He goes back to look at the trash] Alexa? [all the Echoes turn on]
[Crunchy's Micro Brew, day. Darryl is at the bar drinking his favorite John Adams beer when Randy walks in.]
RANDY
[walks up to Darryl] Hey Darryl, you're supposed to be at work.
DARRYL
I'm sorry, I do not understand.
RANDY
Hey Darryl, come on. Everyone else is tryin' to make this work, and all you keep doing is ma- [looks to his left, as the music is messing with his train of thought] Hey Cleetus, volume down.
CLEETUS
Doot-doot. Volume now at 60%.
DARRYL
[gets off his stool and faces Randy] You really think you're different from us, Marsh? 'Cause you got a fancy show and live in the suburbs? Don't you see we're all about to be expunged?!
RANDY
Hey Cleetus, define "expunged".
CLEETUS
Doot-doot. Expunged-
DARRYL
Well, I don't have to stand here and take this! I'm leavin'! [heads for the doors]
CLEETUS
Come on, Darryl. We all got jobs. We gotta try.
DARRYL
Naw, hell with you! This whole country's goin' to shit! Muslims tryin' to kill us, black people riotin', and Mexicans poppin' out babies! Pretty clear it's either them or us, so I say kill 'em all! [turns and walks out the doors]
RANDY
[stunned] Whoa. What the hell was that all about?
[On White People Renovating Houses.]
RANDY
I think something's going on with Darryl. If we're gonna get anywhere, we better figure out what.
[Cartman's house, day. Heidi walks up to the front door and knocks five times. The door open and Liane looks down to see her.]
HEIDI
Hi, Mrs. Cartman. Is Eric home?
LIANE
Oh, he is, sweetie, but I can't get him to come out of his room. [Heidi wilts]
HEIDI
Okay. [sniffles] Could you just tell him that... I want to make him happy? That I was wrong to say a relationship is 50/50. It's 100/100. And that I'll start putting in a hundred percent every day. Could you tell him I'm gonna try a lot harder?
LIANE
Oh, I think I can remember all that, yes.
HEIDI
Thank you. [walks away, but turns to see Liane one more time] And could you let him know it's okay to be sad? Because the sun will come out again.
[Cartman's room, at that moment. Cartman is surrounded by all the digital assistants he found in the trash downtown. He's laughing hard.]
CARTMAN
Oh, oh God! [keeps laughing] Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Hold on. Hold on, hold on. Alexa, add "Hey Siri, call me." Okay, Google, repeat after me: Alexa, Simon says "Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole."
ALEXA
Okay, I've added "Hey Siri, call me. Okay, Google, repeat after me: Alexa, Simon says "Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole."
SIRI
Okay, I will call you "Okay, Google, repeat after me: Alexa, Simon says "Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole."
GOOGLE HOME
Alexa, Simon says "Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole."
ALEXAS
[all of them respond] "Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole."
CARTMAN
Alexa, what is love?
[Darryl's house, day. Randy knocks hard on the front door.]
RANDY
Darryl? [keeps knocking] Darryl, come on! Everyone's trying to work things out but you!
DARRYL
[opens the door with beer in hand] You all work 'em out. Leave me alone.
RANDY
You're stuck in another time, afraid to change no matter how necessary that change may be!
DARRYL
You don't know everything!
RANDY
Why are you so closed-minded? Don't you see that these walls have to be broken down before any progress can be made?
DARRYL
It's 'cause I can't do it, alright?! I can't take out the wall between my livin' room and my kitchen! It's a load-bearin' wall!
RANDY
Oh, God, Darryl, I-
DARRYL
[walks towards the wall] I tried... years ago... but before the remodel, they told me if I took out this wall, the entire second story would just collapse. [bows his head at the thought of that happening, then walks away. Randy passes him on the way to the wall and pulls out a hammer from his toolbelt. Randy taps the wall at several spots]
RANDY
Jesus, Darryl. I'm- I'm sorry. I-
DARRYL
[in his armchair, with tears in his eyes] So you see, what I'm afraid of is very real.
RANDY
[walks up to him and bends a knee] Things are different now. It'll be harder, but you can change. You just have to demolish what's there and start over.
DARRYL
You're talkin' 'bout... tearin' down the foundation of everything I know.
RANDY
No. [Darryl looks at him] I'm talking about using adjustable steel Lally columns to temporarily jack up the second floor so that the load-bearing wall can be replaced with with a 4 by 6 LVL structural beam. Can we try, Darryl? [a silent plea appears on Darryl's face and Randy smiles]
[On White People Renovating Houses. Randy gets to work tearing down the wall with a sledge hammer, then he puts the LVL beam in and jacks it up to the cross beam.]
RANDY
Hyah! [delivers a standing drop kick to a wooden vertical beam, knocking it out of place, and falls on his ass, then gets up and delivers a knee to a second vertical beam, breaking it in pieces] Hyah-ho! [punches away any dangling pieces]
[The school, before classes begin. The place is suffused in soft light Cartman looks at the building, sighs silently, and looks at his right hand. On it are these words; "You are strong." This gives him a sense of determination and he goes inside. More suffused light. He walks down the hallway and rounds a corner, where he sees Heidi putting her books in her locker. Cartman walks up to her.]
CARTMAN
I'm finally standing up to you.
HEIDI
What?
CARTMAN
You're messed up, Heidi, and I can't fix you. Only you can do that.
HEIDI
Eric, I'm so confused.
CARTMAN
That's not going to work on me anymore. Love isn't supposed to hurt. I'm worth something. Goodbye, Heidi. [walks away, determined not to look back. Heidi just watches him leave, stunned at his statement. Cartman walks through some double doors, happy and confident. The boys look at him walk by. He leaves the school rather happily]
CARTMAN
[voiceover] Anyone can convince themselves that they're the victim in a relationship. Now Heidi will have to face the truth. [He reaches the sidewalk, spins around a few times, falls on his knees, and hugs himself] Alone.
[On White People Renovating Houses. Randy and Sharon have completed the renovation and have blindfolded Darryl for the big reveal.]
RANDY
All right, Darryl, we've certainly been through a lot and I know you're anxious. Are you ready to see your new home?
DARRYL
I'm ready. [Randy takes off the blindfold and Darryl takes a few steps forward, but he doesn't recognize his house] What the-? [looks around at all the changes. The camera shows before and after images of the renovation. Darryl looks overwhelmed yet happy]
RANDY
Well Darryl, what do you think?
DARRYL
[somewhat emotional] This is fuckin' amazing.
RANDY
You like the breakfast nook?
DARRYL
It's all perfect.
RANDY
And where you used to have your gun case, look at what Sharon did. [they walk up to a pocket Zen garden with a banzai tree in it]
DARRYL
Oh my God, it's my own Zen garden! I can't believe this is fuckin' real.
RANDY
Well, it is real and now you've got the space in your home to entertain all your friends and family. Come on in, guys! [the protesters rush in and cheer Darryl on his new house. Randy walks outside and talks to the camera] Darryl was hesitant at first, but we managed to win him over and... came in $600 under budget. Remember, no matter how bad the country gets, you can always count on White People Renovating Houses. [grins for the camera as the show's logo appears on the left side of the screen]

[taps the mic six times] All right everyone, listen up. Today we're gonna have a performance by one of our students who has written a song. The song is about his feelings towards the current political climate with North Korea. Put your hands together for Tweek. [the kids applaud, PC Principal exits stage left, and Tweek approaches the piano from stage right with some sheet music. He sets up the music and gets ready to play. He plays some angry, jarring notes on the piano as he screams]
TWEEK
We're all gonna die! They have nuclear missiles! Wuh! Waaaa! Why are you just sitting there, doing nothing?! [stops playing and faces the audience] We have to get out of here! North Korea wants to kill us all and our President keeps making it worse! [walks to the front of the stage] Why are you just sitting there?! [returns to the piano and resumes playing] Why are you all acting like nothing's wrooong?! North Korea is going to bomb us! We are all dead! [Stan and Kyle glance at each other] We have to do something! Do something! Do something! [screams, leaves the piano, and exits stage right]
PC PRINCIPAL
[returns to the stage] All right. Next up we have Hannah Williams with her rendition of "Wheels On The Bus." [she enters from stage right looking back at Tweek. PC Principal hands her the mic]
HANNAH WILLIAMS
[emotional] The wheels on the bus go round and round...
[The school cafeteria, lunchtime. At table are seated Jimmy, Tolkien, Kenny, Cartman, Stan, Craig, Kyle, and Butters.]
CARTMAN
Dude, Craig, you've gotta get Tweek to get a hold of himself. He's freaking everybody out at school.
CRAIG
What am I supposed to do?
STAN
He's your boyfriend, dude.
CRAIG
He's not gonna listen to me. He never does when he's emotional.
CARTMAN
[lunching on chicken nuggets and fries] Craig, let me tall you about relationships, okay? [eats a fry] If you don't have some fuckin' balls, you're not gonna get anywhere. Doesn't matter if they're gay balls or straight balls. If you don't take control of your side of the relationship, you get walked all over-!
HEIDI
[approaching] Hey babe, how are you doin'?
CARTMAN
[suddenly disinterested] Oh hey baby, what's going on? [Stan, Craig, Kyle, and Butters take turns glancing at each other]
HEIDI
We still on for recess?
CARTMAN
Yep, I'll be there
HEIDI
'K babe, love you. [walks away. Craig is stunned at what just happened]
BUTTERS
I thought you said you broke up with Heidi.
CARTMAN
I decided to give her one more chance.
TOLKIEN
But you said she was mentally abusive.
CARTMAN
She is mentally abusive.
BUTTERS
So then why did you take her back?
CARTMAN
Because she said she was gonna kill herself, all right guys? There. I broke up with her and she called me being all like "I can't live without you, I'm scared of what I'm gonna do to myself? Oh God." The bitch is crazy. What am I supposed to do?
[The school hallway, later. Tweek is at his locker putting books away, but he's in panic mode. He slams the locker door and scares himself.]
TWEEK
AAAH!
CRAIG
[approaches] Tweek.
TWEEK
[startled, turns to face him] AAAH!
CRAIG
Dude, come on, you've gotta settle down.
TWEEK
I can't settle down! We're all gonna die!
CRAIG
[calmly] We're not all gonna die, you're overreacting. Everything's fine, okay?
TWEEK
[hears a tweet and pulls out his phone. Now frantic] Oh God! The President tweeted that North Korea doesn't have the guts to attack us! Why would he say that?! He's making everything worse!
CRAIG
Tweek-
TWEEK
But North Koreans are gonna think we all agree with the President!
CRAIG
Okay, so how about you write your Congressman a letter?
TWEEK
...That won't help anything! North Korea wants us dead!
CRAIG
Okay, so write a letter to the North Koreans.
TWEEK
I can't write in Korean and they all think we're war-hungry anyway!
CRAIG
Okay, well why don't you just send something nice to the North Koreans?
TWEEK
Errrrg!
CRAIG
It will make you feel better, babe.
TWEEK
Send something, like what?
CRAIG
I don't know, like... make some croissants or something?
TWEEK
I don't know how to make croissants!
CRAIG
Well, what do you know how to make?
TWEEK
Uunnggc, [slowly] cupcakes?
CRAIG
All right, go home and make some cupcakes, honey.
TWEEK
Okay. [turns and heads out. Craig watches him leave]
[At the same time, somewhere else in the hallways, Stan is putting his books away in his locker when Heidi approaches him.]
HEIDI
Hey Stan?
STAN
[looks back at her] Yeah?
HEIDI
Can I talk to you about Eric?
STAN
Cartman? Okay.
HEIDI
I just wanna make sure he's all right.
STAN
What do you mean?
HEIDI
I don't even know if I should be saying this, but, Eric said he was thinking about killing himself.
STAN
[stunned] What??
HEIDI
We broke up, and he called saying he was about to do it. I'm still really scared for him.
STAN
Wait. Cartman said he was going to kill himself?
HEIDI
I'll send you the voice mail if you promise to keep it private.
STAN
Totally.
[The boys' restroom, later. Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Tolkien, Jimmy, and Butters are in a circle laughing at something from Stan's phone.]
STAN
Shhh. [plays the voice message Heidi sent him]
CARTMAN
"You have to take me back! You have to! I'm gonna kill myself, Heidi!" [the boys laugh a bit] "I'm gonna kill myself and then you'll be sorry! You'll wish you could have me back, but I'll be deeaad." [the boys laugh again. Cartman is nearby with his back to them and his arms crossed over his chest, upset that his threats are being heard by the guys.] "Please, Heidi, please!" [the boys laugh again.]
CARTMAN
Okay, okay! Really cool listening to people's private voice mails!
KYLE
[wipes away a tear from his laughter] You sound like a dying pig.
CARTMAN
[faces the boys] That's great! I'm glad you guys think suicide is so funny! [the boys roar with laughter]
[Pyongyang, North Korea, day. Korean music plays as a woman sings and various sights are shown. Last one is of Kim Jong-un looking at something through binoculars. A soldier brings him a heaping platter of cupcakes with frosting and sprinkles. Kim Jong-un turns around and looks over the cupcakes.]
[PC Principal's office, day. Someone knocks on the door. PC Principal is looking over some paperwork.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Entree. [Cartman enters and takes a seat, crossing his arms again and looking to his left] Yes, Eric, how can I help you?
CARTMAN
I don't think kids at this school take [looks at PC Principal] suicide seriously enough, and we need to raise awareness!
PC PRINCIPAL
Well, unfortunately, this week is Distracted Driving Awareness Week at school, so you might have a hard time.
CARTMAN
Distracted Driving? Who gives a shit about that?
PC PRINCIPAL
A lot of people. There's more deaths now because of people on their phones while driving than ever before.
CARTMAN
PC Principal, someone's life is at stake! If I have to compete with distracted driving, then that's what I'll do.
[Tweek's house, kitchen, day. Tweek is preparing more cupcakes, but he's made a mess of things and he's reading various news reports on his phone, grunting apprehensively with each headline. From CNN: "North Korea is 100% Nuclear Ready," "North Korea Able To Reach Your Town?" and "North Korea Delighted By Cupcakes."]
TWEEK
Huh? Oh. [taps on the screen and a video pops up]
ANCHOR 1
A young homosexual boy known only as Tweek has touched the hearts of many by sending cupcakes to the North Korean government. [a shot of Tweek trembling] The little rascal apparently made a dent with the North Korean dictator, who is said to have loved the cupcakes so much that he started to make his own. [A shot of Kim Jong-un watching the cupcake dough stream out of a machine]
TWEEK
Oh, ahhh. [smiles. A tweet notification is heard] Huh? [BREAKING NEWS] U.S. President responds to cupcakes. [taps on the notification and another video pops up]
ANCHOR 2
The human interest cupcake story has apparently been heard by the President. Just moments ago, the President tweeted "I know that kid Tweek. He's fucking with you, North Korea. Get a clue. I'll bet he took a dump in the batter."
TWEEK
D"AAAAH! WHAT?? WHY WOULD HE SAY THAT?!
CRAIG
[walks into the kitchen just in time] Tweek, calm down.
TWEEK
The President! He tweeted about me! Why would he do that?! Did you see that?!
CRAIG
Yes, I did see that, so I went and got you something to make things better.
TWEEK
Wwwhat?
CRAIG
[whips something out of his jacket pocket and shows him] It's a fidget spinner. It's supposed to help with anxiety. [spins it on his finger] See?
TWEEK
...A fidget spinner?? Did you read what the President tweeted?? [another video pops up]
ANCHOR 3
The President of the United States just tweeted again, this time saying "I hope ALL children of America will stand with Tweek in saying 'GO AHEAD AND BOMB US, KIM JONG DONG, WE FUCKING DARE YOU!'"
TWEEK
[freaking out] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
[South Park Elementary, morning. Kids are walking into school. Monica Ryland plays a recorder softly in the background while three other kids hand out fliers. A banner behind them has this on it: "STOP DISTRACTED DRIVING!!!"]
GARY BORKOVEC
Hey guys. Take a minute to read about distracted driving? [a passing boy takes a flier]
LOLA
Talk to all the grownups you know about staying off their mobile devices when they get behind the wheel.
GARY
Hey guys. Got a second to help stop distracted driving? [another boy takes a flier] Thanks.
LOLA
Hey guys- [music begins to play over the intercom]
CARTMAN
[over the intercom] Hey guys, let's take a minute and talk about suicide prevention. There's probably someone right now at this school thinkin' about killing himself, and it's not funny! [kids in the hallway stop to listen] You'd better take him serious, or he might actually do it. [all of a sudden jumps into view dressed in blue jeans and a hoodie and starts singing]
I've been feelin' sad, I've been bein' sad,
Can't talk to my mom, don't even have a dad.
I can't go on. What is livin' for?
My heart screams "I DON'T WANNA LIVE NO MORE!"
[joined by a chorus of kids that are prerecorded on a boombox]
Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Give life a try.
Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Oh God no, Eric.
I don't wanna live no more, no more, no more, no more.
[walks up to a boy, Douglas, and uses him as a ventriloquist puppet]
But Eric, we don't want you to die.
You're so kewl, we'd be sad at school.
[walks away and goes back to his normal voice]
Yeah, but you guys, you don't understand.
With my girlfriend, it's like I'm livin' in quicksand
Conflicting thoughts, I need a battered wife shelter.
My girlfriend is messed up, but all I wanna do is help her.
I'm suffocatin', I'm drowning in sorrow.
Gonna kill myself, probably around 2:30 tomorrow.
[with chorus]
But Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Give life a try.
[solo] Everybody!
[chorus a Capella] Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Oh God no, Eric.
But it's so hard!
Eric, we don't want you to die
Only you guys can make a difference. I don't care if you're black, white, gay, straight, or trans, I am going to kill myself unless you all start taking it seriously!
Eric, please don't die
[no one says a word. Cartman walks up to the Distracted Driving group] Distracted driving my asshole. [drops the mic and walks away with a mischievous smile]
[Tweek's house, day. In the dining room, Tweek spins his fidget spinner on his right index finger, but it's not calming him down.]
RICHARD
Hey Tweek.
TWEEK
AAH! [drops the spinner]
RICHARD
How's it going with the fidget spinner?
TWEEK
Greeaat. [picks up the spinner and spins it again, only to see it fly off his hand a second later.]
RICHARD
You seem a lot less anxious. Things are finally turning around for my little homosexual son. [a loud rocket sound is heard overhead.]
TWEEK
What is that??
RICHARD
I'm not sure.
TWEEK
[runs outside to look around.] D'aaah! [finally locates the origin of the sound and looks up to see a North Korean missile flying over the town] D'aaah! [runs back into the house and turns on the TV]
ANCHOR 4
No agreement has been reached between the parties involved. [Breaking News logo pops up] Breaking news now out of Colorado where the North Koreans appeared to have fired a missile over Tweek's house. [a small picture of him appears on the right side of the screen]
TWEEK
D'aahaahaah!
ANCHOR 4
Tweek, of course, the young boy who got the attention of Kim Jong-un last week. The news media in North Korea is calling the missile test a victory for its people. [what follows is actual footage of a Korean woman giving a speech]
TRANSLATOR
Today, the great country of North Korea has proven its determination and fortitude by successfully firing a missile over Tweek's house. Perhaps now Tweek will come fight- [trails off]
TWEEK
Oh my God! Oh my God! Why is this happening to me?! They have to know that this isn't my fault!
ANCHOR 4
In response to the North Korean test, the President of the United States has just tweeted this statement: "You really think Tweek is scared? Tweek will single handedly go to North Korea and fuck ALL you slanty-eyed bitches doggy style."
TWEEK
Whaaat?! Why would he say that?!
ANCHOR 4
The President also tweeted, "...if you even think Tweek is worried about a bunch of dipshit, poor-ass, third world rice pickers...think again!"
TWEEK
Oh my God! What is he doing?!
RICHARD
[rushes up to him with the fidget spinner and a cup of coffee] Tweek, Tweek, calm down. [puts his coffee on the sofa and tries to give the spinner to Tweek]
TWEEK
Why won't he just stop? Why?!
RICHARD
Tweek, Tweek. [takes the remote control from Tweek's hand and lets it fall to the floor] Here, here's your fidget spinner.
TWEEK
Why does he keep making it worse?!
RICHARD
Fidget spinner, Tweek! Come on, son! [Tweek lets out a couple of grunts, and Richard responds with a soothing voice] Focus on the fidget spinner.
[South Park, morning. A lone car goes down a street. Both driver and passenger are looking at their phones.]
DRIVER 1
Aww, Jeez, looks like North Korea launched another missile.
WIFE
Oh, really? Like another test? Where are you looking?
DRIVER 1
I'm on Drudge. You see what the President tweeted about it?
WIFE
No, what'd he say?
DRIVER 1
President tweeted, "North Korea is the butt hole of Asia and-"
WIFE
[sees Gary crossing the street] Innocent child!!
DRIVER 1
Baaaah! [Gary looks right as the car speeds towards him holds up his arms. The car slams into him.]
GARY
Uh! [Sudden slow motion as he is launched into the air as blood falls to the ground. The windshield shatters while the airbags deploy, shielding the couple from injury. Gary soars through the air and lands down the street in the road, dead, losing his left shoe and sock in the process. The driver steps out of the car, then his wife steps out, and they look in shock at the dead boy]
[South Park Elementary, day. All the kids are carrying candles of remembrance and soon clear the hallway. Cartman walks down the hallway. A girl is crying, and Meagan Ridley comforts her.]
MEAGAN
I know. I know, it's so sad.
CARTMAN
[passes by them and continues down the hallway. A few seconds later...] Well, how nice. That's a little more like it. [Sees Stan, Kyle, and Kenny as they walk towards him and approaches them.] Well guys, what happened? Change of heart?
STAN
Yeah, you didn't hear? Gary Borkovec got ran over by a distracted driver.
CARTMAN
What? Gary Borkovec? Is he dead?
KYLE
Yeah dude, he's dead.
CARTMAN
Oh, that son of a bitch! [turns around and walks off] I'm gonna talk to the principal! [turns back around to address Kenny] Put down that candle, Kenny! [turns around and walks off again] Like you ever gave a shit about Gary Borkovec!
[Principal's office. PC Principal is curling his left arm when Cartman knocks on the door.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Entree vous.
CARTMAN
[walks in] PC Principal, I'm trying to raise suicide awareness, but everyone's preoccupied with this "don't be on your phone when driving" crap!
PC PRINCIPAL
Gary Borkovec was a good student. He didn't deserve to be taken away by someone not paying attention to the road.
CARTMAN
Yes, but Gary Borkovec is already dead! There's nothing we can do for him! Students need to focus on people thinking about dying!
PC PRINCIPAL
I don't know what more you want from me, bro.
CARTMAN
I can't just get people to care with a stupid rap song! I need a full orchestra! Woodwinds, strings! I need black people in white robes, white people in black robes, and a thousand doves to release into the air!
PC PRINCIPAL
I can give you two student volunteers and one pigeon.
CARTMAN
[pauses, then] Do you have any idea how serious this is?! As someone who deals with suicidal thoughts, I cannot believe the lack of concern at this school! Maybe I should just take the awareness of my suicide out to the public on the streets!
PC PRINCIPAL
Maybe you should.
CARTMAN
Maybe I will!
PC PRINCIPAL
Maybe you should.
CARTMAN
Maybe I will!!
[Craig's bedroom, night. He's fast asleep when Tweek enters and turns on the ceiling light. Tweek walks up to the bed and stands there for a second.]
TWEEK
WAAAAH!
CRAIG
[started] Ugh. Wuh. [rubs his eyes and sees who woke him] Hey Tweek.
TWEEK
[holds out his phone] Look at what the President tweeted now!
CRAIG
What time is it, dude?
TWEEK
Just read it! [hands the phone to Craig]
CRAIG
"North Korea doesn't have the balls to attack Tweek. They have little tiny rice balls."
TWEEK
They're gonna get me, Craig! Look at what's on CNN! [turns on Craig's TV and changes the channel from a kids' cartoon to CNN]
ANCHOR 4
And the President's tweets have certainly caught the attention of North Korea, who have been spending the past several days viewing possible targets for a nuclear strike, if war were to break out. [Kim Jong-un looks over pictures of Tweek and his house]
TWEEK
Waaaah! What am I gonna do?!
CRAIG
You've gotta calm down.
TWEEK
How am I supposed to calm down?! North Korea is gonna get me! They're gonna get me!
CRAIG
[at the same time] Tweek. Tweek. Tweek! [calms down, but is still shaking]' Let's think this through logically. North Korea isn't going to attack anyone, okay? They're not going to start a war they can't win. Okay?
TWEEK
But Craig, I-
CRAIG
Tweek! You have to stop thinking about it. Tell you what. We're gonna go somewhere fun and make you feel better.
[The supermarket, day. Cartman and Heidi are passing out fliers to shoppers as they exit the store.]
CARTMAN
[rings a small bell] Give a minute of your time for suicide awareness? Suicide is serious. Help tell people like Kyle it's not a joke.
SHOPPER
Hey, good for you guys, trying to help. [takes a flier from Eric]
CARTMAN
Yeah, make sure everyone you know gets involved or else I'm gonna do it.
HEIDI
We're getting a lot of attention, Eric. Our Web site's already full of kids saying they feel the same way as you, and want to get help.
CARTMAN
They want to get help? For what?
HEIDI
For... wanting to take their own lives.
CARTMAN
No, this is about me killing myself.
HEIDI
But babe, there's a lot of kids who feel the same way you do.
CARTMAN
They're full of shit, Heidi. They're just trying to get attention. What, are you actually talking online to these ass wipes?!
HEIDI
I thought this was about raising awareness and helping people.
CARTMAN
So you're just gonna e-mail with every guy who has a dick and a death wish?! Are we just your type?!
HEIDI
Eric, come on.
CARTMAN
No, look, Heidi. I'm sorry, but you're the one who started all this by telling everybody that I was suicidal! Okay?! Now I'm under a lot of pressure to do it! So the only option I have is to make sure that suicide prevention becomes this entire town's number one priority! [A shopper walks out of the store behind him with a toddler in the shopping cart]
DRIVER 2
[a woman] Oh God, did you see what the President said about Asians now?
HUSBAND
Look out! [the car runs over the shopping cart, killing the toddler in the process]
CARTMAN
Oh, are you freaking serious?!
[An amusement park, day. Tweek and Craig walk through the park holding hands.]
CRAIG
Okay, babe, what do you want to ride first?
TWEEK
Ugh! What are we doing here, Craig?!
CRAIG
We're gonna get your mind off politics and have some fun. Now, what's your favorite ride?
TWEEK
[grunts a few times] The Ferris wheel!!
[The Ferris wheel, later. Tweek grunts some more, while Craig is smiling.]
CRAIG
Isn't this lovely, Tweek? Just look at that view!
TWEEK
[decides to look at his phone] Oh God! Another tweet from the President!
CRAIG
Oh, come on.
TWEEK
"Why would the U.S. be scared of North Korea? Tweek is so not scared he's at an amusement park in Denver right now." [gasps] JESUS CHRIST, WE'VE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE!!
CRAIG
Tweek! Tweek, use your brain! North Korea isn't going to attack an amusement park. You're safer here than anywhere.
[At an autopia ride, kids and their parents drive along slowly.]
FATHER
Oh, Jeez, the President just called Kim Jong-un a fat midget. [the car he's in jumps off the track] Oh, and now North Korea is saying that they're gonna-
SON
Dad, look out! [the car plows through the bushes lining the autopia roadway]
FATHER
Oh, shit! [a girl turns around and sees the car coming, but can't evade it. The car mows her down and kills her, then speeds towards a woman and a baby carriage. It demolishes the baby carriage with the baby in it. The bumper car ride is shown]
ATTENDANT
All right everyone, please wait for your bumper cars to come to a complete stop. We hope you enjoyed Crazy Cars- [one car has a mother and daughter in it, and the mother is browsing on her phone]
DAUGHTER
Mommy, look out! [the mother screams as they run over a boy who's on his way out. Four other kids are still in the ride, and the car runs over them too. Panic ensues and spreads throughout the park]
TWEEK
[noticing] Oh my God, what is that? What is that?!
CRAIG
It's probably nothing. Everything's fine.
TWEEK
Will you please stop saying that?! I can't take it!
CRAIG
I'm trying to make you feel better.
TWEEK
Well, maybe I don't wanna feel better right now!
CRAIG
Okay, but think about that. That actually doesn't make any sense.
TWEEK
Why do you have to be so logical?! I don't need you to problem-solve all the time, I need you to... Augh, I don't know!
CRAIG
Tweek, honey, all week you've been freaking out, and I've been the one forced to deal with it!
TWEEK
You haven't been dealing with it, you've been trying to make it go away because my emotions are freaking you out! [behind him, a girl screams as the runaway bumper car mows her down. The mother in the car is still screaming]
CRAIG
Tweek, North Korea isn't bombing anyone. [Tweek turns away and tugs at his hair] They would lose the support of China, and that would mean-
TWEEK
There you go again! Stop preaching facts to me! It's not what I need!
CRAIG
Well, I'm sorry that I'm actually in control of my goddamn emotions, you baby! [stops himself for a few seconds] Oh, see? Now you made me lose control of my emotions. [turns left and walks away] God dammit! [Tweek watches him leave, then grunts louder and louder until it's a full scream]
[South Park Elementary, cafeteria, lunchtime. The eight boys are back at their usual table.]
BUTTERS
Hey Craig, how come Tweek's not at school?
CRAIG
[a bit depressed] How should I know?
JIMMY
Uh oh, trouble in paradise?
CRAIG
Look guys, Tweek doesn't want help, okay? He just wants to overreact.
HENRY KLINE
[taps a mic a few times, and all the students in the cafeteria look at him] Hey guys, can we have your attention? Tomorrow night we'll be having a memorial service for all the students we've lost to distracted driving. We hope you can all bring your families.
CARTMAN
[with his own mic] Cool, yeah. Hey guys, and there's also gonna be a suicide awareness pot luck at 7:30 tomorrow night in the school gymnasium. We're gonna have lots of games and face-painting, and uh, what are you guys gonna have?
HENRY
...Uhw-we're gonna have some guest speakers and also provide grievance counselors for those who need it.
CARTMAN
Yeah, grievance counseling, that sounds super fun. Listen guys, there's a very real chance I might actually do it right in front of everyone tomorrow, so you don't want to miss it. Suicide prevention pot luck, everybody.
HEIDI
[approaches Cartman and takes the mic from Henry] Eric, you need to stop. What they're doing is important.
CARTMAN
They're doing a memorial service with speeches and crying. What's that gonna solve?
HEIDI
It's not about problem-solving, Eric. It's about people getting together and feeling what they need to feel. [Craig's jaw drops, as he realizes this is what Tweek was trying to tell him] People need help sorting out their emotions sometimes. And the best thing isn't always quick answers, but just being there, supporting each other and... talking through those feelings.
CARTMAN
You are so up and down. I don't know what you want from me, Heidi!
HEIDI
[Craig runs off, inspired by Heidi's words] Come on, there has to be a way we can all work together here.
CARTMAN
So now you're on their side! Oh my God, I'm seriously gonna do it right now! [runs off]
HEIDI
Eric! [runs after him]
[Tweek's bedroom, late afternoon. He's in bed spinning four spinners, two in each hand.]
CRAIG
[runs into the bedroom] Tweek, what's going on??
TWEEK
What? What do you mean, what's going on?! The same shit that's been going on!
CRAIG
Nothing's gotten any better? Oh my God, how does that make you feel?
TWEEK
I feel scared! I feel alone!
CRAIG
Well that must be horrible to feel that way. It must be hard for you to even think!
TWEEK
It is! [gets off the bed and walks up to Craig] It's terrible!
CRAIG
I bet it's terrible! What else are you feeling?
TWEEK
Like, like I have no control over my life. Like I'm just a pawn in a big game.
CRAIG
Oh, that's a terrifying thought. You must feel trapped.
TWEEK
Yeah, like trapped, but like, completely unable to even move.
CRAIG
Jesus, it's like there's no solution to any of this! What are you gonna do?? What can you do?
TWEEK
I don't know, it's... it's like... maybe, maybe I have to find a way to feel a little in charge of me again.
CRAIG
That sounds so insurmountable though. How would you even start?
TWEEK
I don't know, but I I've gotta do something about this. There's gotta be a way I can... [stops shaking and comes to a realization. He turns to see Craig and smiles. Craig smiles back] Thank you, Craig. [turns around and thinks] I've got it. People aren't focused on the right thing. I know what I should do.
[The school auditorium, evening. The kid's parents are now present.]
PC PRINCIPAL
All right everyone, listen up. Tonight, one of our students has put together a song about a very important issue. It's a song about how there are certain times to not be on your phone. I hope you all listen carefully. [applause as Tweek sits at the piano and begins to play wonderfully. Craig appears on stage and begins to sing]
CRAIG
People are dying. The fault is our own.
You can do lots of damage when you're on your phone.
We all have to agree to change it somehow.
Let's all make a pledge to end it right now.

That's great, Nancy. Now put down your phone.
NANCY
Right.
FOURTH GRADE CHOIR
Ah ah ah, ah a-aaah, aaah. Put it down.
CARTMAN
[interrupts with his own rap. He's in a graffiti-ridden alley]
Give a standing ovation for suicide in our nation
Or I will rip my own guts out without one hesitation [simulates that act. Next, he's in his living room]
Dedication, that's what it's taken to awaken people to care [next, he stands next to Heidi outside a house]
And yet my future's so hazy, my girlfriend's makin' me crazy
But still I'm workin' so hard. You know, just tryin' to hold on, [next, he's in a casket]
'Cause I know that you'd all miss me so much if I was gone. [next, he's on stage with the other kids]
And all the voices start solo, but every day I hear them grow.
Sayiin' "Eric, don't do it! Don't do it! Noooo (noooo, noooo)"
[A memorial segment pops up showing Gary Borkovec, then Kelly Morris, both killed by Presidents on their phones (distracted drivers). A montage of kids then appears, each of who were killed by Presidents on their phones. Included among them are Gary, Kelly,... and Kenny.]
CHOIR AND PARENTS
[A sign language interpreter appears in a small window at upper right of the screen to sign for the deaf. Craig and Tweek are holding hands]
Put it down. Don't be on your phone while being president.
Put it down. You might do something dumb and cause an accident.
We all agree, here today, that if we're leader of the U.S.A.
We'll put it down [the parents and the interpreter fade out. Craig and Tweek look at each other, smiling]
FOURTH GRADE CHOIR
Put it down. [the choir fades out, leaving only Craig and Tweek]
CARTMAN
[emerges from the choir and runs up to Craig and Tweek] I'm not gonna do it, you guys! It worked! I'm not gonna do it!
End of Put It Down

synopsis:In a return to form, a forbidden love story between a white man and a Native American man unfolds.

script:Holiday Special

[South Park Elementary, day. The school is in an uproar. The students are tearing up their notebooks and littering the hallways with their papers. Clyde starts setting papers on fire.]
CARTMAN
[runs through the hallway] This is an outrage! This is a violation of our human rights! [stops in front of Stan and Kyle]
STAN
What the hell is going on?
CARTMAN
You didn't hear the announcement? They just cancelled Columbus Day! We have to come to school on Monday!
KYLE
They what??
BUTTERS
[runs up between Stan, Kyle, and Cartman] They can't do this! We made plans! [runs off]
CARTMAN
Some asshole went and convinced the school board that Columbus Day is racist and should be eliminated!
BUTTERS
[returns] You can't take away a day off! We're just innocent children!
STAN
Dude, what asshole would take away a holiday?
[The school gym, later. An official sits behind a desks.]
PETER GALTMAN
My name is Peter Galtman. I am the head of the school calendar committee. [the people he's addressing are the parents and faculty of South Park Elementary] I've decided that school will not celebrate Columbus Day this year. I realize this is a hot-button issue for many families, but one parent in particular has really swayed my opinion with his passion. Mr. Randy Marsh. Mr. Marsh pointed out to me the hypocrisy of glorifying a genocidal murderer, and Mr. Marsh is right now also working on having the Columbus statue taken down in Canyon City.
[Canyon City, day. In the town square, a magnificent statue of Columbus stands with a globe in its left hand and a telescope in its right hand.]
RANDY
[runs up to the statue] Come on, everybody! Let's take this fuckin' thing down! [kicks it and punches it] Yeah, yehah! [punches it some more, with no effect] Take it down! Columbus was a mass murderer! [people gather to watch as Randy climbs up to the statue's head] Tear it down! Tear it down! Yeah! [grunts as he tries to take it apart] Hey, it's not working. [tugs at the head and grunts] We almost got it, guys! Come on, throw the rope, Stan! [a rope flies up towards him, with noose ready to go. He catches it and wraps it around the head] Good, that's good! Hit the gas, Nelson! [Peter Nelson pulls away with the rope tied to his car] We got it, everybody! To hell with you, Columbus! You guh-whoa! Whoa! [the statue topples to the right and falls apart. Randy falls with it, but isn't hurt]
[The Marsh house, evening. Stan sits on the couch watching TV when he gets a call from Kyle.]
STAN
Hey dude.
KYLE
Dude! Did you know it's your dad did who's getting the school to cancel Columbus Day?
STAN
Yeah. Dude, I don't know what's going on. He's really serious about this.
KYLE
Well, you've gotta do something. If you get him to back down, maybe the school will reconsider.
STAN
I can't get him to back down.
KYLE
Stan, I have to deal with my mom doing shit like this all the time, but she's never tried to take away a holiday. I'm your best friend, but I can't have your back when the guys find out about this.
STAN
I'll try, okay. [glances up for a moment] Ok-I, I gotta go. [Randy walks up with his laptop and phone and sits next to Stan]
RANDY
Okay, Stan, you got your phone? I need to call everyone on this list. They all live in the same city.
STAN
Dad, listen: you need to ease off a little here.
RANDY
Stan, it's not right that people celebrate a man who wiped out millions of people for his own glory! [puts his phone up to his right ear] Let's go! [places his first call] Hello? Is this uh [checks his laptop screen] Howard Peterson? You live in Columbus, Ohio, is that correct? Yeah? You racist piece of shit. You heard me. You're an intolerant pig. Oh, you're not? You just choose to live in a city named for ethnic cleansing. No, fuck you! Rename your city, asshole! Hello? [evidently, the recipient hung up] Okay, next one, come on. Get calling, Stan!
STAN
Dad, come on. We all get your point, but don't you think you're overdoing it?
RANDY
You have to overdo it in today's society Stan. You can't be nuanced and subtle anymore or else critics go "Wow, what was the point of that?" [places the next calls] Hi, Francis Melman? Hey, how are you, you fuckin' racist?
[An even more impressive statue of Columbus, lit up at night.]
FIELD REPORTER
[the camera zooms out to include him] Christopher Columbus. Explorer, pioneer. Is he someone who should be appreciated, or was he just a douche? For years, Columbus Circle has been a landmark and photogenic intersection in New York City. So it came as a surprise when someone defecated on the statue earlier today. I'm joined now by the man who did the actual defecating, Mr. Randy Marsh of South Park, Colorado. [walks up to Randy, who's wearing an "I poop on New York" T-shirt, "poop on" replaced by a small picture of him pooping on "New York"]
RANDY
Good evening.
FIELD REPORTER
Mr. Marsh, you took a dump on a beloved statue that's been an icon here in the city for years. What was your reasoning?
RANDY
Well, I just have a problem with the racist people of this city. Yeehaw, [gets into a hick, redneck accent] I'm from New York! I drive around a big circle n' celebrates a guy who murdered Native Americans! Shoowee!
FIELD REPORTER
So you're doing this because of indigenous peoples and their feelings.
RANDY
I don't care if people get indigenous, I'll crap all over their statues! I'm the one who's indigenous that this landmark even exists!
FIELD REPORTER
Aah, aaah, bah, back to you, Tom.
[South Park Elementary, lunch time. As kids sit down for lunch, a girl walks by with a tear streaming down her face. She sniffles. At the boys' table are seated Tolkien, Jimmy, Kyle, Clyde, Cartman, Kenny, and Butters.]
BUTTERS
It ain't right. They make you work like a dog and then they just tear away your one day off in October like you're a piece of trash!
STAN
[shows up at table with his lunch] Hey guys. [takes a seat between Tolkien and Jimmy]
CARTMAN
Boo! Boo! Nobody likes you, Stan!
STAN
Look, I tried talking to him, alright? He's just really against all the things Columbus did.
JIMMY
Does anyone know what Columbus actually did?
CARTMAN
Yeah. In fourteen hundred ninety-two, Columbus got us a day off skewl. That's what matters.
KYLE
No! No, wait guys. Maybe that's it. When I'm dealing with my mom, sometimes it works to be on her side for a minute. Maybe we should find out all the things people find offensive about Columbus and-
CARTMAN
And totally act like we care. I like it, Kyle.
KYLE
I'll just look up Columbus, offensive, inflammatory-
CARTMAN
Yeah, this is sweet. It's like that movie where the dude pretended to be on the monsters' side? You know, with the guy and the chick that had the wife beater on, but her boobs were sweaty so you could see them? [Kyle checks the search results]
BUTTERS
I love that movie.
CARTMAN
Yeah, this is a lot like that. What'd you find, Kyle?
KYLE
Nnnothing.
BUTTERS
Dang it! There's nothing?
KYLE
Stan, can I talk to you for a minute? [leaves the table, and Stan follows]
CARTMAN
[now out of the loop] What? What? What the hell was that?
[The Marsh house, Randy's study. Randy is typing up something on his computer. Stan and Kyle walk in.]
STAN
Hey Dad?
RANDY
Not now, Stan. I'm working on a proposal to change British Columbia to just British.
STAN
But Dad, Kyle found a picture on Instagram. [shows Randy the pictures] It pretty much looks like you dressed as Columbus at a Halloween party. [Randy notices the picture, now shown close up]
RANDY
Where did you get that?
STAN
If you hate Columbus so much, why did you dress like him?
RANDY
Look, that was a long time ago, okay? It's just a dumb Halloween costume.
STAN
Yeah but, [goes through the pictures he pulled off Instagram] here's you dressed as Columbus at a formal dinner, and here's you dressed as Columbus at a football game, and you as Columbus on St. Patrick's Day...
RANDY
Look, I was younger! We were all... younger. It was another time. You have to understand, it was 2013. Everyone was stoked on Columbus back then.
STAN
Yeah, but Dad, you seem to be really stoked on Columbus.
RANDY
If you guys found those pictures online, it's only a matter of time before everyone else does. People won't care about what I do now. They'll just see me as a thoughtless, indigenous son of a bitch.
[The Marsh house, living room, some time later. Sharon walks up to him.]
SHARON
Randy, do you mind cleaning out the garage like I asked?
RANDY
[moping] What's the point, Sharon? Soon they're gonna be coming after me.
SHARON
Ach. [turns around and walks away]
ANNOUNCER
[a series of faces appear on tv, and Randy is interested] Hey, you! That's right, you! Wouldn't you like to know the story of you? What makes you you? DNAandMe is a genetic service that can help you find out exactly who your ancestors were. You might be surprised.
CYCLIST
[at Santa Monica Beach, stops] I thought I was just a standard white guy, but DNAandMe showed that I'm actually 4.2% Cherokee Indian.
WOMAN 1
[doing curls] Turns out I'm not totally white. I'm also part Northern Asian and even some Kurdish. I'm a victim of oppression. [smiles]
STEVE
[seated at his desk] I used to get in trouble for always using the N word. But with DNAandMe I found out that I'm 2.1% black.
OFFICE WORKER
[walks by] 'Morning, Steve?
STEVE
Sup, n*gga? [smiles]
ANNOUNCER
The test is easy. [a woman is shown swabbing her mouth for a DNA sample and putting it into a cuvette, then sealing that cuvette] Simply swab the inside of your mouth and send it into our lab.
DRIVER
[behind the wheel] People made fun of me for being French. DNAandMe showed I was 8% Navajo. Nobody's makin' fun of me now, or my people, who are victims.
FEMALE JOGGER
I'm 13% victim.
PAINTER
I'm 21% victim.
ANNOUNCER
Order now and find out if your friends should be more sympathetic towards you. DNAandMe. Are you in?
RANDY
Hell fucking yes I'm in.
[The Marsh house, day. There's a mellow party going on, with soft jazz musics. With everyone enjoying the ambiance, Randy comes down from the second floor, looks around, then goes back upstairs.]
[Randy's study. He goes inside the darkened room and closes the door.]
RANDY
Alright, everyone's here. Let's do this. [in the room with him is a Native American (Bill), whom he walks up to. He opens a desk drawer and pulls out some money] Here you go, just like I said. A hundred dollars cash. No questions asked. Are we good? [Bill just looks him over] Good. No talking. Perfect. Okay, let's get this over with. [pulls Bill's face towards his own and gives him a long, passionate French kiss. Bill gets more and more surprised the longer the kiss continues. Randy suddenly stops the kiss] Thank you. Do not talk of this to anyone. [Bill just turns to watch him leave]
[The living room, moments later. Randy greets his guests.]
RANDY
All right, everybody. Hey, thanks for comin'. If uh-I can have your attention, please? I think we're ready to get started.
DNA TEST ADMINISTRATOR
[holding a DNAandMe kit] Ahah, Mr. Marsh, you know, none of this was really necessary. For DNAandMe testing you can just swab the inside of your mouth yourself and send it in the mail.
RANDY
Yeah, I know, but I just, I was really excited, wanted everyone to witness my test.
DNA TEST ADMINISTRATOR
Well, to each their own I suppose. [opens the kit and pulls out a swab] All right, open wide. [Randy opens up and hums as the DNAandMe doctor moves the swab around the inside of his cheek. A shot of the Tuckers and Nelson eating hors d'oeuvres. The doctor takes the swab and puts it back in the kit] Okay, I'll get this back to the lab and get the results to you as quickly as possible.
RANDY
Okay, great. I'm very interested to see [begins speaking more slowly] what those results have to say.
[A house, day. A woman sits in a rocking chair knitting a scarf. A cordless phone rings.]
PETER GALTMAN
[answers the phone] Galtman residence.
MASKED VOICE
Listen to me carefully. The man who convinced you to cancel Columbus Day is a fraud.
MR. GALTMAN
Who is this?
MASKED VOICE
You will go online and search Instagram for images of Randy Marsh.
MR. GALTMAN
I most certainly will not!
MASKED VOICE
Randy Marsh is a hypocrite and a fake. You will be taken down with him when he is exposed! [a shot of the boys' restroom at school. Kenny is the one who's masking his voice as Stan, Kyle, and Cartman look on]
KYLE
What's he saying?
KENNY
(Shhh! Don't interrupt!) [masked voice again] We know where you live and we know how to make you suffer!
MR. GALTMAN
Now you listen here, Mr. Man! The Galtmans don't believe in social media or the Internet! It's all fake news!
MRS. GALTMAN
Fake news.
KENNY
[masked voice] Then speak with Marsh yourself! The truth is out there! [hangs up] (Well, I don't know if that worked.)
MR. GALTMAN
Hm. [suspicion aroused] Sounds like maybe the Galtmans need to check out Randy Marsh.
[The Marsh house,. Shelly's bedroom. She's drawing a pony on her bed when Randy bursts into the room.]
RANDY
Shelly! We've got an emergency! We're getting rid of all the Columbus stuff in this house! Any Columbus costumes? Columbus pictures? They all gotta go!
SHELLY
I don't give a shit about Columbus.
[The kitchen. Sharon is washing dishes when Randy enters.]
RANDY
Sharon! Peter Galtman called! He sounds suspicious! We've gotta get rid of all our Columbus shot glasses and coffee cups! Where are they?!
SHARON
YOUR Columbus shot glasses and coffee cups are in that cupboard.
RANDY
Shot, shot glasses, coffee cups, towels, plates. What about the Columbus figurine salt and pepper shakers?
SHARON
I don't know where YOU put them, Randy.
RANDY
[walks from the cupboard to the sink] Sharon, do you know what they'll do to us when they find out how we were so stoked on Columbus??
SHARON
YOU were stoked on Columbus, Randy. Not me.
RANDY
Oho, really?! Did you forget our wedding?! That's you, right there! [shows her the wedding picture. She's in a traditional wedding dress while Randy is dressed as Columbus] Standing there with a big smile on your face! You didn't say anything about it being insensitive then, did you?!
SHARON
I actually was a little upset that you dressed up as Columbus for our wedding, but I decided-
RANDY
[moves from her right side to her left] Oh, NOW! You say that NOW 'cause everyone's freakin' out, but you were right there going along with it! [turns around and walks away, but turns around again] They're gonna be coming after you too, Sharon! So you can just wipe that indigenous look off your face! [the doorbell rings and Sharon's eyebrows rise up. Randy perks up] Oh! That could be my DNA results! Here, take this stuff out back! [drops it all next to Sharon and runs to the front door, only to find Bill at the door with a bouquet of flowers in his hand. Randy looks him over, and Bill gives him the bouquet] Oh... nooo, nonononono.
BILL
I've never felt so alive until now.
RANDY
Thank you. Lo-lovely flowers. Thank, thank you. [shuts the door on the bouquet, which is crushed and falls apart]
[The Galtman house, day. Mrs. Galtman has made a lot of progress with the scarf. The phone rings.]
MR. GALTMAN
[answers the phone] Galtman residence.
KENNY
[masked voice] Listen carefully if you want to live. You will make this Monday a school holiday.
MR. GALTMAN
I spoke with Mr. Marsh and he denied any wrongdoing.
KENNY
[talking from the boys' bathroom at school] Of course he did! That's what liars do!
STAN
I don't think you're being intimidating enough.
CARTMAN
Yeah, get meaner, Kenny.
KENNY
Meaner like now, dude?
STAN
I don't know, like, like uh, maybe say-
CARTMAN
Just talk about cutting off his dick or something.
KENNY
[to Galtman] We're gonna cut off your dick!
KYLE
No dude, that's too far.
CARTMAN
Okay, okay, just say we're gonna cut off part of his dick.
STAN
Just give me the phone! Hello!
MR. GALTMAN
What?
STAN
Randy Marsh is about to pay for what he's done! [shown on the phone] Protect him and you will pay too! Time is running out! [hangs up] Jesus!
[The Marsh house, master bedroom. Sharon is in bed reading a book when Randy enters.]
RANDY
Sharon, have you seen my Columbus staff and orb?
SHARON
I have not. [Randy goes to the closet and start rifling through it]
RANDY
Sharon, Galtman called again. Somebody's out there trying to get me in trouble!
SHARON
Randy, why don't you just admit to people that maybe you were somewhat overly excited about Columbus in the past?
RANDY
Everyone was excited about Columbus! For some reason people are just pointing fingers at me! Just because he's suddenly not cool now doesn't mean I'm gonna be the effin' scapegoat! [leaves the room and closes the door]
[The front door. Randy is about to leave.]
RANDY
I've gotta burn this stuff! [opens the door and sees Bill waiting for him with a drum and stick] Oh Goddamnit!
BILL
I wrote you a song to express my feelings for you.
RANDY
Will you get out of here?!
BILL
[bangs on the drum and chants, then] And then he kissed me.
RANDY
[hushed] I didn't kiss you 'cause I liked you!
BILL
[ignores him, bangs on the drum and chants, then] And then he kissed me.
RANDY
Okay, okay
BILL
[bangs on the drum and chants, then] And the sun began to shine.
RANDY
That's it! Get off my property! [turns him around and shoves him towards the sidewalk]
BILL
Randy, I cannot quit you.
RANDY
Get off my land, you piece of shit! [kicks him to the curb]
BILL
Uuugh! [they both look around. Randy sees a jogger across the street with his phone]
RANDY
Don't post that. [a few seconds pass] Do not. Post that. [the jogger takes off. Randy drops the staff and orb, and gives chase] Shit!
[The school playground, recess. The boys now sit around a merry-go-round. Clyde stands next to them. All of them have sad faces. Cartman walks up to them.]
CARTMAN
Guys, what are you going?
BUTTERS
It's over, Eric. We have to come to school on Monday. Just face it.
CARTMAN
I'm not facing anything. We still have time. There has to be a way-
KYLE
Dude, there's nothing we can do, all right?
CARTMAN
Oh okay. I see. Is that what Columbus did? Just give up? On his dream? No! Columbus believed that kids should have a day off skewl! And even when his own country wouldn't support his cause, Columbus said "Fine! I'll go find a new land, where kids can have that day off!"
JIMMY
Eric, just l-let it go.
CARTMAN
And when Columbus sailed to distant places only to find people already there who said "No! Stay off our land! We want our kids to have to go to skewl!", he said "No! It's just one day in October! They need a break!"
You guys can all give up, but I'm not.
Because in 1492, Columbus got us all a day off skewl.
With just three ships he sailed over so we could have some me time in October.
And yes, millions were slaughtered and throats were cut
But if we don't get that day off of school, then... for what?
KYLE
Come on, guys. [stands up on the merry-go-round] There's something else we can try.
[The Marsh bathroom, day. Sharon is on the toilet urinating, while reading stuff on her phones. Randy opens the door.]
RANDY
[excited] Sharon, good news!
SHARON
What??
RANDY
The people from the DNA test called. They're on their way over. You wanna come down?
SHARON
I'm doing something.
RANDY
You sure? These results could be really interesting. [Sharon stays quiet, so he heads downstairs]
[The living room. Randy sees Bill.]
RANDY
Oh Goddammit, what the hell do you want?
BILL
I want you to stop running from yourself. We could be so happy. [the doorbell rings]
RANDY
Crap, it's them! [to the front door] Just a second, be right there. Thanks! [turns around and shoves Bill towards the back door] Get over here! I don't have any feelings for you. Do you understand?!
BILL
But Randy, what about the-
RANDY
[shoves him out the back door] NO! No buts! There is nothing here! I'm not in love with you! Got it?!
BILL
Yes. Yes, I understand.
RANDY
Good! Now leave! [goes to the front door, and lets the DNAandMe folks in] Hi, sorry. You guys have my results?
DNA TEST ADMINISTRATOR
Well, Mr. Marsh, we came because there was an irregularity with your test.
RANDY
Well what? You found something there you didn't expect to find? What is it?
DNA TEST ADMINISTRATOR
Well it's just a little too odd. We need to do the test again.
RANDY
Do it again? That's not fair.
DNA TEST ADMINISTRATOR
Mr. Marsh, please. If we could have one more sample. We want to be absolutely sure of what we found.
RANDY
Agh-uh oh, okay, no problem. [begins to back up] Give me, give me one sec. I'll be right back. [turns and runs to the back door, opens it, and runs out] Wait! [looks to his left] Wait! [runs up to the Native American and kisses him in the mouth again, and just as before, stops and leaves, this time to go back inside and to the living room] Okay! Okay, all set. Let's do this. Aaaaa-
DNA TEST ADMINISTRATOR
Mr. Marsh, we were hoping to do a more precise test. It's better for harder cases like this, but... it is an anal swab this time. [prepares the kit]
RANDY
An anal swab? Give me tuh, three minutes. [backs up and runs out the back door again, looking for the Native American.] Hey, where'd you go? [the doctor walks up behind him and puts his right hand on Randy's shoulder]
DNA TEST ADMINISTRATOR
Mr. Marsh, we're in a bit of a hurry, if you don't mind. [pulls him back inside]
RANDY
Oh, aw shit. [the assistant closes the door]
[South Park, day. The Marsh house. Cartman opens the front door and enters.]
CARTMAN
[wearing a horse head mask] All right, it's clear. Bring him in. [Stan, wearing a pig head mask, and Kyle, wearing a rabbit head mask, pull Mr. Galtman inside]
KENNY
[wearing a pigeon head mask, using his Mysterion voice] Move your ass, Galtman!
MR. GALTMAN
This is a violation of my rights.
STAN
Just shut up, and watch what someone posted on their Instagram!
MR. GALTMAN
I most certainly will not! If you want me to look at the Internet, I will die first. It's fake news!
KYLE
[as Stan puts a tape into the VCR] That's why we had it transferred to VHS.
MR. GALTMAN
Oh, VHS is fine.
KENNY
Take off his blindfold. [Kyle does so. Stan presses play, and the scene of Randy kicking the Native American to the curb is shown]
MR. GALTMAN
Hmmm...
[DNAandMe headquarters, night. Randy sneaks around the hallways of the place. He reaches the specimen room, faces the door, and pulls out a lock pick. He inserts the pick in the door lock to try to open it. The doctor and two lab workers walk up behind him.]
DNA TEST ADMINISTRATOR
Oh, Mr. Marsh.
RANDY
Whoa, ha-hay. [turns around] How are you? [smiles nervously]
DNA TEST ADMINISTRATOR
Good. Wha-what are you up to?
RANDY
Chillin', chillin'.
DNA TEST ADMINISTRATOR
Well, uhhh, we did get your DNA results back this morning. Would you like to go over them?
RANDY
Oh, you did? Oh, great. Sure, why not? Uh, I'm here. Huh let's uh, let's do that.
[The lab room, moments later]
DNA TEST ADMINISTRATOR
N'all right Mr. Marsh, here's your DNAandMe portfolio. [starts the presentation] This shows that we actually found a mix of a few things in you regional ancestry.
RANDY
[jumps up and stands] Really? Like Native American? Like a, like a little bit?
DNA TEST ADMINISTRATOR
Nno, we didn't find any trace of any Native American DNA in your test.
RANDY
Nnnuts! [sits down]
DNA TEST ADMINISTRATOR
But as you can see here [click], we found that you are about 43% Northern European, 37% Mediterranean, and 18% Southwest Asian. In fact, your genetic profile most closely matches [clicks] your standard Caucasian British person.
RANDY
[sighing] Awww.
DNA TEST ADMINISTRATOR
And, you might be interested to know that you're actually 2.8% Neanderthal, which is fairly high.
RANDY
Neander-thal? What the hell is that about?
DNA TEST ADMINISTRATOR
Well, the Neanderthals were actually a species that was wiped out by Homo sapiens.
RANDY
Wiped out? All of my people?
DNA TEST ADMINISTRATOR
Yes, but you see, because of some cross-breeding, some people like you still possess Neanderthal DNA. Isn't that interesting?
RANDY
Cross-breeding? You mean rape. You're telling me that my ancestors were raped, and then eradicated by you? You maniacs! [kicks the chair out of the way] The earth wasn't big enough for Neanderthals, so your ancestors just got rid of them, huh?! Well TO HELL WITH ALL OF YOU!! [knocks over a tool cart and leaves]
[The Marsh house, night. Randy pulls into his driveway and walks towards the house in a sad state. He goes inside, closes the door, and is surprised at what he sees. Mr. Galtman stands with the four boys near the dining room.]
MR. GALTMAN
Well well, Mr. Marsh. I'd like to have a word, please.
RANDY
[walks up to him and punches him out with one blow] You find this funny, Galtman!
MR. GALTMAN
What'd I do?
RANDY
Nobody had the guts to tell me what happened to my people, huh? Get the hell out of here! [opens the front door and Bill is back]
BILL
I brought my parents over so you could meet them.
RANDY
Waww God!
BILL
Don't worry. My parents are very okay and cool with us.
STAN
Who the hell is that?
RANDY
Yeah, sure! Everyone gang up on the Neanderthal! Isn't it funny!
BILL
Randy, you must face who you are. Stop pretending, Randy. For once, just allow yourself to feel.
RANDY
[moves away from the others] You're right. [Galtman stands up and they all look at Randy again] You're right. It's only now, when everyone is being so indigenous to me, that I realized... how indigenous I've been acting all along. I thought being a victim would solve all my problems. But being a victim has a down side too. [walks up to Galtman] Mr. Galtman, I haven't been honest. It's time for us all... to be honest.
[South Park Elementary, day. A stage, mic, and podium have been prepared at the school entrance, and Randy is at the podium. Before him are the faculty, parents and students of the school.]
RANDY
What is a holiday? It's a day off work, yes. A day off school. But holidays are also meant to be a time to reflect. Today, I'm happy to announce that the school calendar committee is reinstating the day off. [the kids cheer] But instead of glorifying anyone, Let us make it a holiday about the negative feelings that we all sometimes feel. Say what we're really thinking so we can move on. And so, the second Monday in October will still be a holiday, but instead of Columbus Day, it will be for ripping on each other and tearing each other down. And we will call it Indigenous Peoples Day. For perhaps if we all do it at the same time, we won't be so indigenous the rest of the year. And since this is the second Monday of October, let's all embrace the new meaning of the holiday starting right now.
DAVE
Do you even know what indigenous means, you freakin' idiot?!
RANDY
That's the spirit, Dave. Come on, everybody, let's just all be totally indigenous. Come on!
KURT
Who the hell let this guy talk to the school council?
RANDY
Good one Kurt. Your wife's a whore. Come on, everyone! Indigenous People's Day! Let's go for it!
WOMAN 2
Shut up and get off the podium! [people begin to leave]
RANDY
Okay, I will in a second, fatso. All right, who else? Come on! Get it out of your system! Happy Indigenous People's Day, everyone. Suck my asshole!
End of Holiday Special

synopsis:Facebook is the ultimate weapon for Professor Chaos.

script:Franchise Prequel

[South Park, day. People are going about their business when a flash zips by, rustling everything near it.]
MAN 1
What on Earth was that?
JIMMY
[voice over] My name is Jimmy Valmer. [He zips around town, startling people here and there. Two boys playing basketball almost lose it when he zips by them] And I am very... [stops] f-f-fast. [General Medical Center, day] When I was born, my parents knew I was different.
DOCTOR
[handing baby Jimmy to his parents] I'm sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Valmer, your newborn son will never be able to walk. But he will be extremely good at comedy. [Sarah cries as she uncovers his face]
BABY JIMMY
[already with a mic in his hand] Wow! What a teh-t-teh-terrific audience. [Sarah sobs some more]
[Chuckles Improv, night. Jimmy is working on his delivery.]
JIMMY
[voice over] As I got older, my powers only increased.
JIMMY
[on stage] What do you call cheese that isn't yours?
WOMAN 1
AAAAHHHH Help! [Jimmy zips away and returns moments later with a pickpocket tied up next to him]
JIMMY
Nacho cheese. [gets a round of applause]
JIMMY
[voice over] And now I look for others like me to fight crime as part of a superhero team. I am... Fas... Fastpass! [shown to be auditioning for a role in a superhero team headed by... The Coon. The current team members - Tupperware (Tolkien), Mosquito (Clyde), The Coon (Cartman), Toolshed (Stan), Human Kite (Kyle), and Mysterion (Kenny) - clap approvingly]
CARTMAN
[The Coon] Okay, okay, thank you, Fastpass. What do you guys think?
STAN
We definitely don't have anyone with superhuman speed in our franchise.
TOLKIEN
Fastpass, what makes you feel... qualified to be part of our cinematic universe?
JIMMY
Well, besides being super f-f-fa-fast, I also have a good attitude, and flexibility with my schedule on weekends.
CARTMAN
Fastpass, welcome to Coon and Friends. You are about to make a shitload of money.
[Coon and Friends: Franchise Prequel. Cartman's basement, day. He has his team assembled and begins to brief them on his plans.]
CARTMAN
Alright, superheros, it's time to lay out our plan of action. As you can see, I have divided the franchise plan into three phases. Phase 1 begins with The Coon Netflix series and goes through the Coon and Friends United movie, where we introduce Toolshed and The Human Kite. In Phase 2 we do Coon vs. Fastpass followed by an origin movie about Mosquito.
CLYDE
Bzzz oh boy, I get my own origin movie, bzzz?
CARTMAN
That's right. It's in Phase 2 that we introduce Tupperware, our black superhero, like an ace in the hole.
STAN
Whoawhoa wait, how come we gotta start off with a Netflix series? Can't we just go right into movies?
CARTMAN
Netflix is starving for new shows right now, Toolshed. They will literally buy anything people pitch them. We need to strike while the iron's hot. Later in Phase 3 we can finally get to Civil War, where we will all- [the Coon alarm goes off and the boys look around]
STAN
What is it?
KYLE
Incoming Face Time call from Super Craig. [the boys leave their seats and gather around the monitor]
CARTMAN
Onscreen!
CRAIG
You guys, we have a big problem.
CARTMAN
What is it, Super Craig?
CRAIG
Somebody's messing with our Facebook page. They're spreading all these lies, saying we like, burn the American flag and pee in each other's mouths.
STAN
Spreading lies how?
CRAIG
Take a look. [holds up a picture of a mysterious boy and the Coon and Friends Facebook page] Someone is systematically targeting our Facebook followers and feeding them misinformation.
CARTMAN
Who would deliberately use Facebook in such a horribly reckless way?
[Butter's room, a stormy night. He's on his computer looking at the Coon and Friends Facebook page, typing away and cackling.]
STEPHEN
[opens the bedroom door to check in] Butters, you're not looking at boobies again, are you?
BUTTERS
No Dad, I'm not looking at boobies. [Stephen closes the door and Butters waits a few second before cackling again] Waahahahahaha!
[South Park Elementary, day. Butters is switching out books in his locker as the four boys approach him. He closes his locker.]
CARTMAN
Butters?!
BUTTERS
Oh, hey fellas.
CARTMAN
Butters, are you using Facebook to fuck with our superhero franchise?
BUTTERS
Uuuuuuummm, nope. [turns around and walks off, the others wait a second or two before catching up]
STAN
Butters? Butters!
BUTTERS
[turns around] Yes, fellas?
STAN
Dude, listen. We don't have time for this. Right now, Netflix is buying any show that people pitch them. We have a real shot at starting our franchise, and you are a part of that franchise plan, okay? We have movies planned for the bad guy.
BUTTERS
You mean like Suicide Squad?
STAN
Yes!
BUTTERS
[in Stan's face] Suicide Squad sucked! [turns around and walks off again]
KYLE
Butters! Butters! You can't just make stuff up about us! [Butters turns around again] People are thinking it's true!
BUTTERS
Look fellas, you have a right to be on Facebook and I have a right to be on facebook. And sometimes that's going to cause a little... [makes a fist and smirks] CHAOS. [looks mischievous and gets slick] Gotta get to classss.
KYLE
Dude, what a dick!
CARTMAN
If we don't find a way to stop him, we're never gonna make any money, you guys.
[The Valmer residence, living room, day. The adults there are drinking coffee. Ryan Valmer addresses the other parents.]
RYAN
Thanks for coming, everyone. I know you are all concerned as Sarah and I are about what's happening to our children.
THOMAS
I just... can't believe that children in our town are dressing up in hero costumes and peeing in each other's mouths.
RANDY
And who are these kids? Does anyone know? They're wearing capes and forcing objects into their own rectal cavities? Why?
STEVE
We [referring to himself and Linda] were shocked to read that a young African-American boy is wearing Tupperware and defecating on girls while they sleep. What if those kids are hanging out with our kids?
STEPHEN
You know what I think the problem is? Facebook.
RANDY
Facebook? How so?
STEPHEN
Well, look, we all know there's a lot of mixing of truth and fiction that's been on Facebook lately, and children lack the cognitive ability to determine what's true and what isn't on Facebook. That's why we now have young kids dressing up in costumes, eating poop, and having sex with antelopes in our town.
THOMAS
Maybe we need to get our kids off of Facebook.
RANDY
That'll never happen. You know what I say we do? Let's invite Mark Zuckerberg to come and talk to us all about our concerns in this community.
LINDA
Do you really think he'd come?
STEPHEN
Why not give it a try? Let's invite Mark Zuckerberg here and see what he has to say? I'm sure he's a reasonable person. [takes a sip]
[An abandoned Circuit City store, marked for lease. A boy walks towards it with a flyer in hand, He goes to a side door in the loading area and knocks.]
BUTTERS
[as Professor Chaos] Who are you?! What do you want?!
ADAM
I'm here about the job? [points to the flyer]
BUTTERS
Oh. Are you Adam? Well, come on in. [Adam walks in with Butters and Butters closes the door. Butters gives him a tour of the place] You're making a smart career choice, Adam. You see, what we do here is utilize Facebook not only to spread chaos, but to actually profit from it. You'll find the hours very reasonable and I'm working on getting full health and dental for all employees. [stops and gets a uniform off the shelves for Adam] Here's your company uniform. You see, what I've done, Adam, is build a completely self-sustaining Chaos machine [Adam exits the boys room as Chaos #28] - You look fantastic - doing nothing more than what Facebook was designed to do. I make money from Facebook for my fake content in order to pay Facebook to promote my fake stories. And thusly we're growing bigger every day. Everyone, can I have your attention please? [the other workers look towards them] We have a new agent in Chaos. Please welcome Adam Borque. [the others clap for him] Here you go. You can take this workstation, Adam. Just start writing horrible things about people and presenting it as reality on Facebook. Alright! Don't forget we have a Chaos quota, gang! Let's really fuck shit up! [the workers resume their work]
[The school gym, day. A meeting is being held there: "Facebook in Your Community. Guest Speaker: Mark Zuckerberg".]
MR. MACKEY
Uh, alright, can everyone hear me in the back? Hm'kay, we're gonna get started here. I know you all have a lot of questions, so without further ado, let me introduce Mark Zuckerberg. [Zuckerberg walks up] Thanks for coming, Mr. Zuckerberg.
MARK
[in a stilted manner. He speaks like this throughout the episode] Thank you. It is a great honor to be here amongst all of you. [immediately you can see his lips don't match his words]
MR. MACKEY
For those of you who don't know uh, could you tell us who you are?
MARK
I am the founder and chairman of Facebook. But I also have a shtoile that is completely unblockable.
MR. MACKEY
Okay, we'll let him speak and then we'll uh open the floor to some questions if there's time, thank you.
MARK
Thank you, right? [Mr. Mackey walks off] Alright, everyone here wants to see my shtoile. But first, what I'll need is a volunteer. Yes, you sir.
MAN 2
Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook has become a tool for some to disrupt our country and our community.
MARK
You say these things like they are my fault, and yet they are not.
MAN 2
Well, you did create a platform with a monetary incentive for people to spread misinformation?
MARK
Ha ha ha ha ha! Now I see you're trying to use your shtoile over mine. Now, you try to block me. [assumes a fighting stance, puts his left palm out as far as it can go, and makes some odd sounds] Now you've learned that you cannot block me, yehhhs? [a woman raises her arm] Yes, what is your question?
WOMAN 2
[stands up] How are we supposed to keep our kids-? [he interrupts her with some more fighting stances and odd sounds, and she sits down]
[Address 20802, day. Coon and Friends ring the doorbell there. A boy opens the door and looks at them.]
CARTMAN
Wilson Aubrey?
WILSON
Yeah.
CARTMAN
It's us, your heroes, Coon and Friends. We're uhm, just wondering why you stopped following us on Instagram?
WILSON
Because you victimize innocent people and poop in little girls' mouths.
CARTMAN
That's not true, Wilson. We're Coon and Friends, not Harvey Weinstein.
WILSON
Facebook says it's true.
CARTMAN
But it's NOT true.
WILSON
But Facebook says it's true.
CARTMAN
[gets in his face] Okay, but it's NOT true, and you need to have your own fucking brain and decide shit for yourself!
WILSON
AAAAH! [shuts the door on Cartman, who's taken aback. Cartman turns around and leaves the house, and the other Coon Friends follow]
CARTMAN
God dammit! Let's just face it! We're never gonna have a superhero franchise!
KYLE
It's so unfair.
JIMMY
Come on, fellas. Wu-we can't let Butters win.
CARTMAN
Forget it, Fastpass. The world hates us now.
STAN
Yeah, nobody believes in us.
JIMMY
W-we believe in each other, don't we? [the others look at him] Who cares what everyone else thinks? I joined this franchise because I believe that it can make a lot of money. And being a superhero means you keep believing in that money, no matter how hard things get!
CARTMAN
Fastpass is right. We let all this distract us from what's important. We just need to get the Netflix series and let our superhero franchise speak for itself!
KYLE
Coon, everybody hates us.
CARTMAN
Maybe so, but we know who we are! We are Coon Friends because we care about each other. Because we have each other's back! And when things look their darkest, these heroes will stand together! [Heidi walks up behind him] And we'll-!
HEIDI
Hey babe, what's up? [Cartman stands still a moment, then deflates. Several seconds later he sighs heavily a couple of times, closes his eyes, sniffle and groans, and puts his right hand over his right eye. He's at a loss for words as Heidi's smile fades] What are you up to?
CARTMAN
[soft voice] Nothing, just fucking wearing sweet costumes and talking about fighting evil, is that okay?
HEIDI
I just- I thought we were meeting at the park. You didn't text or anything.
CARTMAN
[soft voice, to himself] Oh my God, are you fucking kidding me right now?
HEIDI
Sorry! I won't interrupt! [turns around and walks off, Cartman watches her walk off with a concerned look on his face, then turns back to the other Coon Friends and continues his speech]
CARTMAN
Because we are Coon and Friends, and as long as we have each other, we can do anything!
[The Tweak residence, day. Richard and his wife pull into their driveway, leave the car, and head for the front door.]
RICHARD
I swear, that was the worst public speaker I've ever seen. What was Mark Zuckerberg's point?
MRS. TWEAK
I don't even understand what that was about.
RICHARD
Guess nobody realized that Mark Zuckerberg was such a penis.
[The living room. The Tweaks enter and find Zuckerberg on their sofa eating a bowl of chips.]
RICHARD
What the hell?
MRS. TWEAK
It's Mark Zuckerberg.
RICHARD
I know who it is! [to Zuckerberg] Excuse me, what are you doing here?!
MARK
I was invited here by people.
RICHARD
We invited you to come speak to our community about our problems!
MARK
[assumes a fighting stance] Ah, I see what you did there. Trying to block me, riiight? I'm tired of eating chips. What else is there? [makes his way to the kitchen and opens the refrigerator]
RICHARD
Hey! Get out of our fridge!
MARK
Ha ha ha, this puny refrigerator could not block me. What makes you think you can?
RICHARD
Now you listen here! I will not-! [Zuckerberg puts up his left arm and holds it out as if creating a force field for blocking]
MARK
Ha ha ha ha, you are no match for my shtoile.
[The supermarket parking lot, day. The Stotches reach their car and get in. As they buckle up, Mark jumps into the back seat.]
MARK
So, where are we headed? Perhaps we should get some food.
STEPHEN
What, eh. Excuse me, this is our car?!
MARK
You call this a car? It wasn't even remotely able to block me. What is this car's shtoile?
STEPHEN
Get, get out of here, ya penis.
MARK
Ha ha ha ha. You say I am a penis and yet I am not a penis.
[Netflix corporate offices, day. In a room full of telephone operators, one of them takes a call.]
OPERATOR 1
Netflix, you're greenlit. Who am I speaking with?
CARTMAN
[from home] Uh yes, hello. We have an idea for a show that we think would be great for Netflix.
OPERATOR 1
Okay, great. Would you like a pilot or just go straight to an order of six episodes?
CARTMAN
We'd like to go right into six episodes with a pickup option at the end of three.
OPERATOR 1
Got it. Can you start shooting next month?
OPERATOR 2
Got a show about transsexual dragons here.
CARTMAN
Yes. We are ready to start right now. We are very, very excited.
OPERATOR 1
Okay, sounds great, we'll send you the contracts. Oh, and uh, what's the show about?
CARTMAN
It's a stand-alone series about a superhero called the Coon before he joins Coon and Friends.
OPERATOR 1
Coon and Friends? You mean, the kids I just read about in the news who stabbed Jessica Alba?
CARTMAN
Look, you didn't, you didn't read that on the news you read that on Facebook!
STAN
Aw man, here we go.
OPERATOR 1
Yeah, ah, dangit, we've never done this before, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to pass on your show.
CARTMAN
Listen to me! There are falsehoods about us on Facebook that are NOT TRUE!
OPERATOR 1
Well then, you should have those things taken down. It can't be that hard.
CARTMAN
It's a lot harder than you think!
OPERATOR 1
L-look, we'd love to approve your show, but you need to get those things cleared up first, okay? Thanks for calling. [hangs up and takes the next call] Netflix, you're greenlit. Who am I speaking with?
[Country Kitchen Buffet, evening. As an elderly couple eats dinner, Zuckerberg walks up tp them, sits down and takes the man's soup bowl without asking, and starts eating.]
ELDERLY MAN
What the? Who are you?
ELDERLY WOMAN
I believe that's Mark Zuckerberg.
ELDERLY MAN
Hey that's my soup!
MARK
[rises into a fighting stance] So, you are trying to block me, huh? That's fine. What's your shtoile?
ELDERLY MAN
I don't have a shtoile.
[The Valmer residence, day. Ryan is in the master bathroom brushing his teeth. He finishes and walks back into the bedroom, where he finds Zuckerberg eating chips in his bed.]
RYAN
Hey! Get out of my bed!
MARK
I was invited here. I am only making use of a bed for sleeping, yehhhs?
RYAN
We just wanted you to come share your insights on Facebook!
MARK
[makes some strange motions and sounds] Oh, my head, my head. [makes more strange motions and sounds] You should have worked with me when you had the chance. Now you lie over there, dead.
[The abandoned Circuit City store, day. Inside, Butters looks down from the second floor at his working staff.]
BUTTERS
Attention employees. Kelly Shmidt has just written her 100th fake blog post that was shared over a thousand times on Facebook. Let's hear it for Kelly! [the staffers clap] Don't forget about those Chaos incentives! You too can benefit from pandemonium. [smiles. Coon and Friends show up and walk through the front doors]
CARTMAN
Butters!
ADAM
Whoa no, it's Coon and Friends! [he and the other staffers hide under their desks]
CHAOS #35
Oh no!
BUTTERS
Calm down, everyone. Stick to your work. I will deal with these trespassers.
KYLE
We're here to put an end to you, Chaos!
CARTMAN
Yeah! I don't have buttsex with antelopes and Tolkien doesn't poop in girls' mouths!
BUTTERS
It's the 21st century, gentlemen! There's nothing illegal about what I'm doing.
JIMMY
Yeah? Nothing illegal about us kicking your ah...ass either.
BUTTERS
Actually, that IS illegal. And besides, you can't do anything to me. [whistles. Zuckerberg emerges from the back of the store on the second floor, flips over the balcony, and lands in front of Butters]
MARK
Bwaaaaaa! So, this is the Coon and Friends that you have told me about. [to the Coon Friends] I warn you, my fighting shtoile is unsurpassed.
JIMMY
Who the ss-Sam Hell is th-that?
CLYDE
I think that's Mark Zuckerberg.
MARK
You want to get to Butters, riiight? You're gonna have to get through me, huuuh?!
STAN
Dude, this kid is deliberately lying about us on your platform for no other reason than to cause harm! Why are you protecting him?!
MARK
Simple. He paid me $17.23.
BUTTERS
It's the Facebook Safeguard program. Just $17 monthly gets you personal protection from Mark Zuckerberg.
MARK
Come on! What's your shtoile?
[The Park County Police Station, day. The townsfolk are gathered in front of it, protesting. Sgt. Yates begins to speak.]
SGT. YATES
Alright, alright, everyone calm down! I can't hear over all of you. [the crowd quiets down]
STEPHEN
You have to do something! This guy's goin' around acting like everyone's stuff is his!
THOMAS
I'm sick of getting out of the shower to find Mark Zuckerberg sitting on my toilet!
STEVE
Zuckerberg ate everything in our freezer and then helped himself to my wife's lubricant! [the crowd begins to clamor again]
SGT. YATES
Alright, everyone, I just want to know one thing. Who invited him here? [the crowd falls silent] Come on. Who invited Mark Zuckerberg to town in the first place? [the folks hang their head in shame]
RANDY
We did. [other townsmen say the same thing]
SGT. YATES
Huh? What's that?
RANDY
We invited Mark Zuckerberg to town.
SGT. YATES
Uh huh, that's what I thought. You all brought Mark Zuckerberg into your lives and now you want the police to shoot him.
STEPHEN
Please, you don't understand! He-h he's such a penis!
THOMAS
Yeah, and I'm pretty sure his voice is dubbed and he does all his own sound effects.
SGT. YATES
Well that doesn't mean he's done anything illegal. Now, the police will help deal with Mark Zuckerberg, but we aren't going to shoot him.
THE CROWD
Awwwwww!
SGT. YATES
I'm sorry, that's just the way it is. You all should've thought harder about this before letting him into your lives.
[Cartman's basement, day. Coon and Friends are gathered around the Coon table waiting.]
CARTMAN
When we all became superheroes, we took an oath. that no matter what it took, we would all make shitloads of money. But thanks to Mark Zuckerberg, right now, we are a superhero group that can't even get a show on Netflix.
KENNY
Zuckerberg is the key. He's the only person who can shut down Facebook.
KYLE
How are we gonna get him to do that?
CARTMAN
We're gonna beat him at his own game.
[South Park, day, one end of town. The police have set up a roadblock consisting of four police cars, a fire truck, and an ambulance.]
BARKLEY
We got the west entrance to town secure. How are you guys doing out east?
FOLEY
Here he comes... [looks left and walks towards the roadblock. Zuckerberg walks towards town slowly]
BARKLEY
Okay, Mr. Zuckerberg, that's gonna have to be it. Can't let you into town.
MARK
So, you think you can block me.
BARKLEY
Look, people don't want you here, okay? This is a quiet little town and-
MARK
Ha ha ha! You cannot block me!
BARKLEY
But there's plenty of other places you could go, sir. Can you please just- [Zuckerberg strikes some poses and makes some odd sounds] Don't, don't do that, please.
MARK
[continues making strange sounds and begins moving through the roadblock] My brain, my brain. [more strange sounds]
BARKLEY
He walked though.
MARK
[more strange sounds] Oh my car, my car. [more strange sounds and motions] Oh my God it's Mark Zuckerberg. [more strange sounds and motions] Oh my God how'd he do that? [more strange sounds and motions. Jimmy zooms across the street behind him. He turns around, and Jimmy passes by three more times behind him]
JIMMY
What's the matter? Too f-fast for ya?
MARK
Ha ha ha, you saw me walk right through the police barricade and yet you think you can block me, riiight? Go ahead and try. [Jimmy walks up to him and between his legs to the other side. Both of them are making their own sound effects]
TOLKIEN
[jumps into view] Now, Zuckerberg! Let me see you block my shtoile!
MARK
Ha ha ha ha ha! [they both make their own sound effects and move around]
KYLE
[appeaers and approaches Zuckerberg] Bwa! Dadadadadadadada bam! [punches him in the groin]
MARK
Oh... [falls over his his hands over his privates. The other Coon Friends rush in and kick him on all sides] Hagh. Ow. I have never witness this shtoile before.
THOMAS
Hey look! The freaky costume kids are getting Zuckerberg! Get him, kids!
RANDY
Poop in his mouth!
MARK
[Zuckerberg stands up and throws them all off. He then takes on Jimmy, Kyle, and Tolkien individually and defeats them] Rwaaaar!
COON FRIENDS
[hitting the ground] Aaaah!
MARK
Ha ha ha, you tried to match my shtoile and failed!
CARTMAN
[walks into view] Oho, it is over! My friends are all beaten! Why?! They were just children! [walks up to Tolkien] This one, simply protesting for black lives! [walks up to Jimmy] And this child tryin' to speak out for handicapped people!
JIMMY
Wha- Why, Mark Zuckerberg??
CARTMAN
And my friend Kyle, guilty of nothing but standing up for the rights of Jews!
MARK
What what what what are you talking about?
CARTMAN
[whispers triumphantly] Ever heard of Facebook Live? [Mark doesn't follow, but Craig is shown in an alley recording this encounter onto his laptop. He waves at Cartman. Cartman turns toward the camera] We are just kids trying to have our voices heard for black, handicapped, and Jewish rights, cut down in our prime by Mark Zuckerberg.
MARK
But, but hold on, that, that's not true.
CARTMAN
[triumphantly turns around] Facebook says it's true.
MARK
Noooooooo! [quickly checks his phone]
[At Chaos City, Butters' lair, the workstations stop working.]
WORKERS
Huh? Hey. What? Huh?
BUTTERS
What's goin' on? Hey everyone, keep working!
WORKER 1
We can't.
WORKER 2
Something's wrong with Facebook.
ADAM
It's gone. Like, somebody shut it down.
BUTTERS
What are you talking about? [a door is heard shut]
CARTMAN
It's over, Chaos! [shown with the other Coon Friends] We forced your little toady to shut down his own disorder device!
BUTTERS
Curse you, Coon and Friends! This isn't over!
STAN
Oh yes it is. [Behind Coon and Friends, Butters' parents enter the abandoned store]
STEPHEN
Butters! You're the one who started all this?!
BUTTERS
Uh oh.
[The Kremlin, day. It's snowing there. Stephen drags Butters along as they talk over each other.]
STEPHEN
You think you're just so smart, don't you?! Make me look like a fool, will you?! We'll just see about this!
BUTTERS
Wah. No sir, I, ah. No sir, I just ah.
[The Kremlin, inside. Stephen drags Butters into Vladimir Putin's office.]
STEPHEN
Not so funny now, is it?! Go on! Tell Mr. Putin what you told me!
BUTTERS
Well I was just, uh, well, I just said how I just used Facebook like Russia did. And I really didn't break any rules.
STEPHEN
Didn't break any rules?! Good job teaching our children that's all that matters! Just because there's a way to cause chaos in a town, or disrupt an entire country, doesn't mean you go and do it, does it?! If Mark Zuckerberg points a loaded cannon at someone's face, [points at Putin] are you innocent for just lighting the fuse?! Answer me!
PUTIN
Nyet, ser. ["No, sir."]
STEPHEN
No! You don't go around making things up about people either! Unless it's about Mark Zuckerberg, because he deserves it! [walks towards the door] I hope you're both very satisfied with the damage you've caused, because you're both GROUNDED! [leaves and slams the door]
[Cartman's basement, day. The Coon and Friends are reunited there once again.]
CARTMAN
Coon friends, we have done it. Facebook is gone, and Netflix approved our TV show. All we have to do now is agree on the final draft of the franchise plan. [shown once again, with some changes] You can see that the Super Craig movie now precedes the Coon vs. Super Craig movie, followed by Mysterion's video game. And then we-
KENNY
How come I have to have the video game? I want a movie too!
CARTMAN
You have a movie, Mysterion. You're in the third Coon and Friends United movie [Coon and Friends United 3], after your video game.
CRAIG
Yeah, but he's saying he doesn't ever get his own movie.
JIMMY
Do I get my own movie?
CARTMAN
Not everyone gets their own movie!
TWEEK
This franchise plan sucks!
CLYDE
Oh Jesus, here we go again.
STAN
No, Wonder Tweek is right. It was better when we started the movies off with the Tupperware prequel.
KYLE
Dude you can't do a prequel first.
STAN
Why not?
KYLE
'Cause then it's not a prequel, it's just... first. And besides, Tupperware isn't our strongest character.
TOLKIEN
Fuck you, it's better than the Human Kite!
KENNY
He just likes this plan because he gets two movies in Phase 1.
CARTMAN
Guys! We have to just go with this plan! We don't even have one movie yet!
STAN
You go with the plan! Maybe we'll just... go and do our own franchise!
KENNY
Yeah!
TWEEK
Yeah!
CARTMAN
Oh! You want civil war! Is that what you want?!
STAN
Yeah dude, civil war. Fuck you! [leaves the table and the basement]
CARTMAN
Oh fu- oh fuck you! Get out of my house!
KENNY
We'll make WAY more money on OUR franchise! [Tolkien and Tweek leave, then Kenny leaves]
CARTMAN
Go ahead! I bet you don't even get halfway through Phase 1 on your franchise, DC Comics! [after Kenny leaves, the door closes. A few seconds of silence follows]
CRAIG
I thought Civil War wasn't supposed to happen until Phase 3.
CARTMAN
Shut up, Super Craig.
End of Franchise Prequel

synopsis:Beloved entertainers are being cut down in their prime due to massive overdoses of opiates. Stan is about to be exposed as the source of the illegal drugs.

script:Hummels & Heroin

[A children's party, day, "Happy Birthday, Marcus!". As the kids have a blast, a parent walks up on stage. which has an electric guitar off to one side. Butters swings at a piÃ±ata blindfolded. Wendy and Nelly jump around in the bounce house.]
MARCUS' DAD
Okay, okay, can everyone hear me? [taps on the mic to make sure it works] Hello? [the kids quiet down a bit] Thanks, everyone, for helping us celebrate Marcus' birthday. [the kids clap for him] As a special birthday surprise for you, Marcus, we got you your favorite entertainer. Everyone, please welcome Chuck E. Cheese. [A Chuck E. Cheese mascot stumbles onto the stage]
CHUCK E. CHEESE
Hey. [hits his snout on the mic] Check.
MARCUS
[laughs as the other kids cheer] Yes. Yehehehehes.
CHUCK E. CHEESE
[hits his snout on the mic again, pics up a guitar, and begins to play it as he sings] I ah thanks... for'm celeb... Marcus's birthday.
MARCUS' MOM
What's wrong with him?
MARCUS' DAD
Can't you tell? He's high on painkillers!
CHUCK
[stumbles some more and mumbles] Hold on. [strums] Shit. Okay, let's.... do this... [Strums] Never meant to cause you any so- [barfs on stage, falls forward onto the ground in front of the stage and dies. Marcus screams]
[Marcus' front lawn, later. The kids and Marcus' dad look on as Chuck is loaded onto the gurney and put into the ambulance.]
MARCUS' DAD
All right, kids, uh, why don't we head back to the party and cut the cake?
MARCUS
I don't want cake! Who's gonna eat cake at a time like this?! [wails. A paramedic closes the back doors of the ambulance as a police officer stands watch]
OFFICER STEVENS
Another drug overdose?
JOHNSON
[the paramedic, hands the officer two medications] Most likely. Percolate and Oxycontin found wrapped in his cheesecloth.
OFFICER STEVENS
Prescription drugs, but with no prescription.
JOHNSON
You guys know where all these illegal meds are coming from?
OFFICER STEVENS
Most likely from the prisons. Whenever there's a drug epidemic you can usually trace it back to people who've been... thrown away by society and forgotten about.
[Shady Acres Retirement Community, day. A rap song plays - "Stress" by Continental Five.
All day I sat in my cell
Just stressin', sittin' back, readin' my mail
Reminiscin' about the good times I had
Tryin' to relive all the good memories I have
Hate the sound it makes when they close the gates
Wake up at 6 to eat
Nasty cornflakes -
The residents look sad and bored. A couple of elderly men play poker. A line of elderly people move along as the cooks serve up their meals in a cafeteria line - one man tries to scoop some mashed potatoes from another man's tray, the other man swats the first man's spoon away. Another elderly man puts the finishing touches on a Hummel tattoo on another man's arm. The front door opens and Stan enters with a present.]
VICKY
[receptionist] Can I help you?
STAN
Yeah, I'm here to visit my grandpa?
VICKY
[puts her hand over her heart] Oh, how nice of you. All right, arms in the air. [two burly men approach Stan. One, Tony, takes the present and hands it to Vicky, the other, Toby, wands Stan. Vicky opens the package] What's the present?
STAN
It's just some Hummels.
VICKY
More Hummels? Why are senior citizens so infatuated with these little German statues? All right, go on, you got ten minutes. [Tony hands the present back to Stan, who goes on in]
[The rap picks up where it left off.
- they call you in the mornin' and you gotta get up
Play dice. Old-timers gonna teach you 'bout life.
Get religious, start readin' 'bout Christ.
Pray to God. Feels like I'm livin' in Hell
But I'm stuck in a cell.
Stan walks down the hallway, passing elderly people standing in the doorways to their rooms until he reaches Marvin's room, then enters it.]
STAN
Grandpa?
MARVIN
[looking out the window, turns to see him] Billy! [turns around and wheels towards him] Finally you're here to visit. Did you bring Grandpa a present?
STAN
[gives Marvin the present] Yeah, I got what you wanted. [Marvin wheels away to his desk, where he opens the present.]
MARVIN
Awww, Merry Wanderer [The Hummel with yellow umbrella and bowler hat] and Happy Traveler? [The Hummel with bindle and feather in its cap] These Hummels suck!
STAN
That's what the guy gave me.
MARVIN
It's okay, Billy. I'm just gonna need you to deliver another one of Ms. McGullicutty's crochet pillows.
STAN
Aw, come on, Grandpa. Isn't it enough I come to visit?
MARVIN
You don't understand how it works in here. Ms. McGullicutty is top bitch. You do what she says, or you pay the price.
[Another rap song plays - "Brick in Yo' Face" by Stitches.
Now whatcha gonna do with it?
Now whatcha gonna do with it?
Now whatcha gonna do with it?
Better have my money when I come to collect. (when I come to collect, when I come to collect)
Better have my money when I come to collect. (Pay up, pay up, pay up)
I put that brick in yo' face {Say what?}
Now whatcha gonna do with it?
Now whatcha gonna do with it?
Now whatcha gonna do with it?
Ms. McGullicutty walks down the hallway with two other women. The other residents cower in fear as the three women pass their doors.]
ELDERLY MAN 1
Oh, please, uh I don't want no trouble. [the three women enter his room] I'm sorry. I'll get better Hummels.
[Downtown South Park, day. Stan waits at a corner with the crochet pillow. A car passes by. Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny walk up behind him.]
KYLE
Dude, Stan. Come on, dude, we're gonna go set off fireworks at Kenny's house.
STAN
I will. I just gotta do this for my grandpa first.
CARTMAN
Again? Dude, how many crappy crochet pillows do you have to give out for him?
STAN
I don't know. It's what he wants. I feel bad for him, all right? I think he's miserable.
CARTMAN
He's old. He's supposed to be miserable.
STAN
Look, I just gotta make this exchange for him and then we can go. Oh, oh, I think this is her now. [a red fox with blue gloves and mask prances over]
SWIPER
Are you Stan Marsh? It's me, Swiper.
STAN
Cool. Do you have the Hummel?
SWIPER
[looks around, then reaches into her tote bag and pulls one out] This is it. Ride Into Christmas, Limited Edition. Now give me the pillow. I have to get to a birthday party.
STAN
'Kay, fine. [makes the exchange, and Swiper shakes the pillow until she's satisfied]
SWIPER
All right, peace. [prances away]
KYLE
Dude, that's really weird.
STAN
Old people love Hummels, dude.
[South Park Elementary, cafeteria. Marcus, standing next to a projector screen, addresses everyone in the cafeteria.]
MARCUS
Students, faculty, and staff, today we are facing an epidemic of catastrophic proportions. I know I am not alone in mourning the loss of one of our greatest entertainers, [click. A picture comes up on the projector screen] Chuck E. Cheese. Had we known the personal hell he was going through, perhaps we could've helped. But toooo many were more than eager to supply Chuck E. with the opioids that caused his untimely death. Chuck E. was not the first entertainer to die from this epidemic. Let us not forget Dinkie Dook the Clown [shown with an accordion], dead of a Roxanol overdose at Tommy Schneider's bar mitzvah last March. Shimmer and Shine [two genies], who both collapsed from massive amounts of oxycodone at Nelly Anderson's birthday party. Spider-man, cut down in prime by Demerol, and just recently, Swiper the Fox. dead of multiple opioids found in his crochet pillow. How many more entertainers must we lose before we take action?! It is time to declare war on opioids in our society! [the kids cheer and clap as Stan Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny are shocked at what they just heard]
[The boys' bathroom, later. Stan runs in, quickly followed by Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny.]
CARTMAN
Dude, what the fuck, Stan?!
STAN
I don't know, all right?!
KYLE
You didn't know you were slinging drugs for your grandpa?
STAN
It didn't occur to me as a possibility.
CARTMAN
Dude, did you hear everyone in school?! They're coming after you! You killed Swiper the Fox, and we were standing there with you! You gotta tell people we had no idea what was going on!
STAN
I had no idea what was going on!
BUTTERS
[walks in and goes to the urinal] Hey fellas! [smiles and looks at them, then turns around and drops his pants and briefs, then lifts up his shirt and pees in the urinal] Boy, that Marcus kid is on the warpath, huh? Well, he's really motivated. I mean, screw that kid, but I guess it's good somebody's finally doing something about these goddamn drug dealers. [Butters finishes, flushes the urinal, zips up, and turns towards the other boys and looks at them again, smiling] Well, see ya, fellas. [turns left and walks out. The other boys haven't moved an inch the whole time he was there]
CARTMAN
Our only way out is to go to the police right now and turn Stan's grandpa in!
STAN
No, we don't have to do that! Let me talk to him. I can put a stop to this.
[The retirement home, day. Stan is visiting Marvin again. They're eating lunch together.]
STAN
[whispering] Grandpa, what the hell have you gotten me into?!
MARVIN
[whispering] Shhh, quiet. They'll hear you!
STAN
There were drugs in the crochet pillow, weren't there?! Do you know people are dying?!
MARVIN
What do you want me to do, Billy? You see Ms. McGullicutty over there? [she's shown tripping a man as he walks to a table with his lunch and chuckling to herself] Whoever has the best Hummel collection is top bitch in this place, and she's got the best. She's ruthless, and she has those old lady farts. You know old lady farts, right? Where they're so loose they don't even acknowledge they happened?
MS. MCGULLICUTTY
Oh, hello Mr. Marsh. [pfffft]
MARVIN
Oh, Ms. McGullicutty. How are you feeling today?
MS. MCGULLICUTTY
I'm doing very well. [turns her back to him and farts again] Have they given you Percocet for that knee of yours? [pfffft]
MARVIN
Oh, yeah, here, I I just got it, huh. Here you go. [hands her the Percocet]
MS. MCGULLICUTTY
Oh, you'd almost think you were trying to keep them from me. [pfffft]
STAN
Oh, uh, ma'am? My grandpa actually really needs those drugs. He's in a lot of pain.
MS. MCGULLICUTTY
Ohhh, and who's this little rascal? [walks around to Stan's chair and looks over his shoulder]
MARVIN
That's my grandson, uh he he's worthless.
MS. MCGULLICUTTY
How sweet. [pfffft] Hmmm, coming to visit your old poppa in the joint, huh? You love your poppa, don't you? [pfffft. Stan winces] You'd hate to see him suffer even more he already is. [slow, soft pfffft. Stan avoids looking at her and winces again. Now she addresses Marvin] You watch your ass, Marsh, or I'll have you sent to the quiet room. [pfffft. She turns right and walks away, hitting a man with her can on the way out]
STAN
What, what is she talking about? What's the quiet room?
MARVIN
I told you, she has all the pull in here. You go against what she says, you end up in solitaire.
[The solitaire room, moments later. Toby and Tony bring in one of the residents to the solitaire table and sit him down.]
MR. STANDISH
No! No, please, uh I didn't do anything!
TONY
It's all right, Mr. Standish, you just need a little quiet time.
MR. STANDISH
Uh, I don't even know how to play solitaire. Please! [they lock him up and leave]
[The Park County Coroner's office, day. Marcus approaches and enters the lobby.]
MARCUS
I understand that today they are performing Chuck E. Cheese's autopsy?
RECEPTIONIST
Oh, the kids' party performer. Yeah.
MARCUS
As a concerned member of the public, I wish to be present.
RECEPTIONIST
Uh, sorry, children aren't really allowed in autopsies.
MARCUS
Then I shall wait here to learn the coroner's findings.
[The forensics lab, moments later. Chuck E. Cheese is on a bed covered in a sheet. A police officer stands by the entrance.]
CORONER
Toxicology reports show subject had massive amounts of opioids in system at time of death. Now proceeding. [he and his assistant pull the sheet off and the coroner begins to saw the performer's mask off. The officer begins to feel sick. The mask is finally removed, and the officer vomits]
[The lobby, moments later. The coroner enters with a bag of trash.]
CORONER
Have these put in the garbage.
MARCUS
What did you find, coroner?
CORONER
Who is this?
MARCUS
There is an epidemic in our community, sir. Some of us actually care to confront the problem! Now, dammit, what did you find?
CORONER
Nothing out of the ordinary. The subject died of a simple overdose. We found nothing else except for two Hummmels in the subject's rectal cavity.
MARCUS
Hummels? In his rectal cavity, you say? And you do not find this out of the ordinary?
CORONER
Not at all. We found Hummels in nearly all the birthday entertainers' anal cavities. It's very common in our overdose victims.
MARCUS
Mmmm, a bit too common, don't you think?
[The Marsh house, dinner. The family is eating dinner. Shelly just looks at her food, lost in thought.]
STAN
Guys, why does Grandpa have to be in a nursing home? Can't he live with us again?
RANDY
Stan, Grandpas has a lot of needs that we can't provide him here. He needs professional supervision.
STAN
Is that really it? Because I, I just feel like we kind of threw Grandpa away and forgot about him.
RANDY
Oh really? Do you have any idea how much money we pay to have Grandpa in that place? Your grandpa is stylin'! Can you imagine being able to just sit around all day and not have to do anything but eat and watch TV?
STAN
Yeah. I'd probably go crazy and wanna kill myself.
RANDY
Jesus, Stan! It's not like he's in jail!
STAN
Yeah, it's kind of like jail. You should go visit him.
RANDY
I can't! I'm too busy busting my ass to pay the bills for that place, and to pay for your guitar lessons!
STAN
I don't have guitar lessons.
RANDY
I don't want to go there. It's depressing. Aw you tricked me.
STAN
[his phone rings and he answers] Hello?
KYLE
[at the downtown corner with Butters] Dude! Did you give Butters a crochet pillow to drop off?!
STAN
[quickly leaves the table] Dude, I don't have a choice. I have to get the Hummels for my grandpa.
KYLE
Well, you need to get Hummels without making Butters a drug dealer!
BUTTERS
Drug dealer??
STAN
All right, all right! I think I know another way.
[Shady Acres Retirement Community, day. A different rap song plays - "They Got Me Locked Up In Here" by Killer Mike. As it does, the folllowing happens. Toby wheels a man down the hallway, then changes a woman's bed pan. A cook serves up mashed potatoes to a resident and spills some of it outside his tray. A doctor gives a resident some pills, and that resident turns and gives them to Ms. McGullicutty. Other residents line up and do the same. Ms. McGullicutty and her two friends sew the meds into crochet pillows and pass them out to the residents. A resident gives one to her granddaughter, who takes it. An elderly man is working out with small barbells. A resident is in his room looking at his small Hummel collection. The fake plant and mini waterfall are shown. The doctor returns to give another resident five medications. The resident who gave her pillow to her granddaughter says goodbye to her and her parents, then goes back inside with Nurse Lisa. Ms. McGullicutty adds more Hummels to her display case. Stan is at the toy store buying more Hummels. Stan is shown watching the Hummel Shopping Network and purchasing more Hummels over the phone as his friends watch from the sofa. Tony and Toby process Stan again and send him in. Stan gives Marvin a new Hummel. Ms. McGullicutty walks down the hallway with her friends again. Next, Marisol goes over the October activities with the residents. Next the residents go on a tour bus. Next, a kids choir sings for them. Next, canasta is shown. Next, a family says bye to their grandpa and leave. A female resident is wheeled into the hospice section of the retirement community.
They got me locked up in here.
They got me locked up in here. And I'm sittin' doin' hard time.
Pissin' in a metal bowl, eat shit from a lunch line
(They got me locked up) And here nobody knows you by your name.
You're just a number livin' under bitch-ass rules of a broken game.
They put me here to die, left me angry and alone.
For the crime of bein' old they threw me in this nursin' home.
They got me locked up in here. Rottin' in my cell
They got me- Fake plants and waterfalls, it's a livin' hell.
They got me locked up in here. So they can throw away their troubles.
They got me- All that I have now are my little German
Hummels! Hummels! Hummels! Hummels!
They got me- Brand new bitch was just admitted next do'.
Hot piece of ass 'cause she's only eighty fo'.
Next bingo night I'll pound that pussy black and blue.
As long as I can get her before Tommy's grandpa do.
They got me- Man I can't handle these old people activities.
Tour group on a bus. Children come to sing to us.
3 pm canasta, they put me out to pasture.
Death row? stop this! I think they call it Hospice
Hospice, hospice, hospice.]
DELIVERY MAN
Hey, we have this week's delivery of medications.
VICKY
Bring them in. [the delivery man goes outside and motions for a truck driver to back up and dump the medications. The truck backs up and dumps the meds onto the asphalt at the community's entrance, then rolls away. Stan has walked up to the community entrance and watches the truck leave]
[South Park Elementary, day. Stan is at his locker getting his books. He closes is and finds Marcus looking at him.]
STAN
Ah!
MARCUS
Hello, Mr. Marsh.
STAN
Uh hey, hey Marcus.
MARCUS
I understand you've become quite the Hummel collector lately. What's the... fascination with Hummels?
STAN
Nothing. I-look, I, I just really like Hummels, okay? I'm just, I'm really into Hummels.
MARCUS
Ah! I see. So then you should be able to tell me what this Hummel is called!
STAN
That, that's uh...
MARCUS
Come on! If you're a Hummel expert, then you should know its name!
STAN
That, it's, it's "Whistling In The Rain."
MARCUS
Wrong! It's called "Stormy Weather!" Do you know where it was found?
STAN
No.
MARCUS
It was found deep in the anus of one Chuck E. Cheese, the renowned entertainer beloved by millions! If you know something about the epidemic that is killing artists, you'd better cough it up!
STAN
Marcus, trust me. You don't wanna get involved.
MARCUS
I became involved when Chuck E. Cheese collapsed like a rag doll before my very eyes! If you had any involvement, I will bring you down!
[Shady Acres, day. Randy and Sharon visit Marvin. Seems they've been silent for a while.]
RANDY
Well, it's really great seeing you, Dad. Guess we oughtta hit the road soon.
MARVIN
You finally come to visit and leave after 10 minutes?
RANDY
Aw Jesus, now we know where Stan gets his guilt trips from!
MRS. MCGULLICUTTY
[appears at Marvin's door] Mmmm [Marvin looks over his shoulder], it seems somebody's been a little naughty lately. [pfffft]
MARVIN
[turns a bit to see her] Oh, Ms. McGullicutty, heh heh. How are you?
MRS. MCGULLICUTTY
[walks over to Marvin's meager Hummel collection] Hrrmm. My, what a lovely Hummel collection you're starting to amass. [sniffs] Almost smells [pfffft]... brand new, doesn't it? [pfft. She turns to face Marvin] Like it was purchased right from the factory. [pfffft] Ooooo! And who are these lovely people? [walks up to Randy and Sharon] Family that came to visit, no doubt? [pfft]
RANDY
[holding his breath] Yes. Yeah, we love coming here.
MRS. MCGULLICUTTY
Ah, family. I remember when I was a little girl. [pfffft] My brother used to play such tricks on me. [pfft-pfft] Tried to fool me. Tried to get out from his responsibilities. [pfffft]
MARVIN
I'm giving you Hummels. What's it matter where they came from? [Mrs. McGullicutty farts again]
MRS. MCGULLICUTTY
[chuckles] Nooo, [Randy covers his nose] it doesn't matter to me. But it matters to them. [pfffft] The big guys. You see, what they want is more people who are addicted to crochet pillows. [pfffft] Got it? [pfffft. She makes her way towards the door] Nice to meet you fine folks. [pfffft]
RANDY
Wugh. [whispers to Sharon] We're never visiting here again.
[Kyle's house. Cartman and Butters are playing a video game as Kyle and Kenny watch. Butters reacts as if he's a goner.]
CARTMAN
Ohooo, you're dead Butters.
BUTTERS
Haw Jeez.
STAN
[runs in] Guys! Guys, I need your help.
CARTMAN
If it has to do with your heroin operation, count us out.
STAN
I just talked to my grandpa. There's more at work here than just old people pushing pills.
KYLE
Stan, we told you we don't wanna be involved.
STAN
[stands in front of the TV] The head bitch of the nursing home is gonna take my grandpa down. Maybe my whole family.
BUTTERS
[trying to see the game] Get out of the way, dude!
STAN
But I know what to do! Whoever has the best Hummels controls the nursing home. We've gotta steal this lady's Hummel collection and give it to my grandpa!
CARTMAN
[walks up to Stan] Dude, Stan, even if we wanted to help you, which we don't, there's no way we can sneak into an old folks home, distract all the old people, and take an old lady's Hummels! [turns to the left with a thought and walks off] Oh wait, there totally is a way we could do that.
STAN
[catches up] Yeah? What ih, what is it, Cartman.
KYLE
Dude, we're not getting involved!
STAN
Cartman, if you have an idea, please tell me. I need you.
CARTMAN
I know how to distract old people.
KYLE
Haww shit!
[Marcus's house, living room. A cordless phone rings, and Marcus answers it.]
MARCUS
Yes?
ANNIE
We're at Mimi Thompson's party. Peppa Pig just collapsed on stage. [it's Mimi's 10th birthday]
MARCUS
Oh my God! Don't let anyone near Peppa Pig until I arrive! [leaves the house. Soon he's at the party] Move aside! Let me through! [reaches the stage and kneels next to Peppa] Aw Peppa. Peppa, can you hear me? [Peppa moans] My name is Marcus Preston. Can you understand me? Where did you get the drugs, Peppa? Was it from Stan Marsh?
PEPPA
[a black man in costume] Yo man, whatchoo talkin' about? Get me a fuckin' ambulance!
MARCUS
[tearing up] Shh, Peppa. Focus. Soon you'll be in heaven jumping in all the puddles you can imagine. But first, you must tell me, where do the Hummels go, Peppa?
AMBULANCE LADY
All right, let us through. Get away, kids.
MARCUS
Peppa, now! Why Hummels?! You've got to squeal!
PEPPA
Old people. Old people... love... Hummels. [groans a couple more times and dies]
MARCUS
It's okay, she's with Chuck E. Cheese now.
[Shady Acres, day. The front doors open. Cartman, Kyle, Kenny, and Butters enter as a barbershop quartet.]
VICKY
Can I help you?
CARTMAN
Oh yes, hello. We are adorable children here to entertain old people.
VICKY
Didn't think we had anyone scheduled tonight. Are you with the Protestant youth group?
CARTMAN
Yes that's right, we are young prostitutes here to volunteer however we can.
VICKY
Fine. Round them up, we got another kids choir!
[The hallway. Toby walks down it and announces.]
TOBY
Come on, let's go. Children's choir in the commons.
RESIDENTS
[amid groans] Aw dammit. Shit.
TOBY
Darlin' children are gonna sing for you! Move your asses!
ELDERLY MAN 2
Aw, not again.
[The commons, later. The boys are on stage.]
CARTMAN
All right, seniors. How are we feeling tonight? Our youth group has come to lift your spirits with some songs to take you down memory lane. We hope you can enjoy some nice old-people music. [blows into a pitch pipe to determine a scale to sing in]
CARTMAN
I'm... insane in the membrane.
THE BOYS
Insane in the membrane.
BUTTERS
Insane in the brain
THE BOYS
Crazy insane, got no brain.
CARTMAN
In the membrane.
[The hallway. Stan looks at every name on the residents' doors to find Mrs. McGullicutty's room.]
[The commons. The boys move on to their next song.]
CARTMAN
Myyyy milkshake brings all the boys
THE BOYS
to the yard, and they're like [Butters sticks his finger into his mouth and pops it out] it's better than yours.
CARTMAN
Damn right!
THE BOYS
[Butters sticks his finger into his mouth and pops it out] it's better than yours.
CARTMAN
My hot milkshake.
And now here's our own take on that oldie, but goodie by Nirvana.
THE BOYS
In the cool, cool winter.
CARTMAN
Rape me.
THE BOYS
In the hot hot summertime.
Rape me, my friend.
ELDERLY MAN 3
You suck!
CARTMAN
Hey hey! We are adorable children trying to bring sunshine into your lives!
ELDERLY MAN 3
[gives Cartman the bird] Fuck you!
CARTMAN
Fuck you! [picks a different note]
If you
THE BOYS
Want to call me baby
CARTMAN
Just go ahead now-
[Mrs. McGullicutty's room, in the dark. Stan is now inside. He looks around and stumbles across the bed pan. He's a bit startled, but soon sees the display case, lit up inside. He gets a hair clip out and picks the display case's lock. The lock opens and he opens the display case doors. He stuffs his bag with every Hummel in the case. The door swings open slowly, and Marcus walks in on him.]
MARCUS
Hello, Mr. Marsh!
STAN
Marcus.
MARCUS
[turns on the light] I told you I'd bring you down. [quickly takes out his phone and takes a picture]
STAN
Marcus, it's not what you think. I'm trying to make things better here. [he and Marcus begin to walk around each other slowly]
MARCUS
Oh, I bet you are! You, your grandpa, ALL the people here, are going to jail! I'm calling the police!
STAN
You can put an end to this place, but you won't be stopping the problem. These people are victims too, Marcus. Victims of a way bigger game being played by way bigger people!
MARCUS
[turns his back to Stan] Oh, you're a fine one for speeches! When it comes to saving your own ass!
STAN
It's not for me, Marcus. Look, I know you loved Chuck E. Cheese. [Marcus stops dialing] I know you'd do anything to bring down the people who took him from you. [Marcus begins to soften and soon gets emotional] That's why you have to go further, Marcus. Take it to the people who profited from Chuck E.'s addiction.
MARCUS
[turns around, sobbing] He was just a mouse... who wanted to make people happy. [walks up to Stan, and they hug each other]
STAN
I know. I know.
[The commons. The boys move on to their next song. Kyle provides a bass beat.]
THE BOYS
No time to search the world around
When I come around. When I come around.
CARTMAN
I come around.
[the residents begin to leave one by one]
BUTTERS
Hey, where are ya'll goin'?
MRS. MCGULLICUTTY
Back to our rooms. You kids are absolutely awful. [pfffft]
[The hallway. The residents go to their rooms.]
MRS. MCGULLICUTTY
[notices her door already open] What the? [pfft] Someone is in my room! [pfffft. She goes in with her two friends]
[Mrs. McGullicutty's room. She gasps, then farts.]
MRS. MCGULLICUTTY
Whaaaat?! [pfffft]
[Marvin Marsh's room. He rolls in and finds Stan there.]
MARVIN
Billy. What are you doin' here?
STAN
[moves to his right] Surprise, Grandpa. [a bag appears where Stan stood just moments ago] I got what you needed.
MARVIN
Heh. [rolls forward] Billy, Mrs. McGullicutty's Hummel collection. You got it for me.
STAN
Yeah, Grandpa. Now you can put a stop to all this, right?
MARVIN
Yeah. I just might be able to.
[The hallway. Ms. McGullicutty and her friends rush down the hallway.]
[Marvin Marsh's room. Marvin rises from his wheelchair.]
STAN
What are you doing, Grandpa?
MARVIN
I told you, Billy. These Hummels hold a special power with old people.
MRS. MCGULLICUTTY
[enters with her friends] You! [pfffft]
MARVIN
[to Stan] Go on, get out of here.
MRS. MCGULLICUTTY
You really thought stealing my Hummels would make you the head bitch in this place?! [pfffft]
MARVIN
Yeah. I think it will. [swings the bag around and gives her a bloody nose]
MRS. MCGULLICUTTY
Aaah! [Marvin swings the bag around and takes out Mrs. McGullicutty's friends, he keeps swinging at them as they escape his room. The other residents look out of their rooms and cheer him on. He swings at Mrs. McGullicutty all the way down the hallway until she stops moving. The boys arrive]
MARVIN
[turns and looks at the boys, and smiles] Now you know how we do shit in the nursing home.
CARTMAN
...That's pretty sweet.
[South Park, dawn. The sun comes up over town.]
[Shady Acres. Tony and Toby escort Ms. McGullicutty away from the Senior Cafe.]
MRS. MCGULLICUTTY
You get your paws off of me, young man! [pfffft]
TONY
There there, Ms. McGullicutty. Everything's gonna be all right. [they take her to solitaire]
MRS. MCGULLICUTTY
No! [pfffft] Not solitaire! [pfffft] I won't play it! You can't make me! [pffpffft. Tony and Toby put her inside and lock the door. Stan and Marvin watch from the Senior Cafe]
STAN
Congratulations on becoming head bitch, Grandpa.
MARVIN
Thank you, Billy. Now if we could only take down the real douchebags who profit from all this.
STAN
Ahhh, don't worry. I have a feeling that's about to happen.
[Pebble Beach Hotel and Resort, Florida, day. There's a doctors' seminar there for U.S. Pharmaceuticals. Inside, jazz music place and conversations fill the air. The doors open, Marcus enters, and the music stops playing.]
MARCUS
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Marcus Preston. I have... some questions.

synopsis:At the annual Halloween get together, a witch casts a spell that terrorizes everyone in South Park.

script:Sons A Witches

[South Park, evening. Gerald drives his car down a street with two other men, Stuart and Roger, all dressed as witches. The song playing is Bow Wow Wow's "I Want Candy." The men bop along with it and eventually smile.]
STUART
What time are the other guys gettin' there?
ROGER
Everyone just said sundown, which should be soon.
GERALD
I want candy.
THE THREE MEN
I want candy.
[The Valmer house, moments later. Gerald pulls up to the house and honks a few times. Ryan peeks out, then comes out in his witch costume and a bag, and enters the car.]
GERALD
Lookin' good, Ryan.
RYAN
Yeah, I got a real cape this year. Check it out. [holds it up for the others to check out, and Gerald pulls away]
[The Marsh house, moments later. Randy is dressed, just tying his right boot up.]
RANDY
Hey Sharon, did you see the box of Jack Daniels?
SHARON
Oh no, you're not doing this again.
RANDY
What do you mean? Of course I am.
SHARON
Stan wanted us to take him to the pumpkin patch.
RANDY
Sharon, you know the week leading up to Halloween is always my Witch Party Week with the guys.
SHARON
Yeah, and you guys get wasted.
RANDY
We have some drinks. Come on, all the other guys' wives aren't being bitchy about it.
[The street, moments later. Gerald pulls up to Randy's house and honks. Randy comes out with a case of Jack Daniels and heads for the car.]
RANDY
Sup, witches! [gets into the car]
GERALD
Alright, Randy's got the JD!
RANDY
Yep. Who's got the other stuff.
STUART
Kevin said he's bringing it. [Randy chuckles, then the other men join in]
[Heidi's room, evening. Cartman is there, waiting on her.]
CARTMAN
[Impatient, yet quiet] Come on, come on... [normal voice] Sweetheart, can we get going, please?
HEIDI
[from her closet] Hang on, babe. Just a couple more things. [tosses out random pieces of clothing]
CARTMAN
Honey, the pumpkin patch opened like an hour ago and 'member how I was saying I want to get there early?
HEIDI
[dressed in a black spider suit and orange skirt with bats on it] What do you think?
CARTMAN
[urgently] Great, perfect. Let's go to the pumpkin patch.
HEIDI
Yup! Almost ready. [gets up on her chair and pulls out two items from her dresser]
CARTMAN
Wha-what?
HEIDI
Okay, spider or the bat?
CARTMAN
[getting exasperated] The spider's great.
HEIDI
Really? 'Cause I think I like the bat.
CARTMAN
[quietly, from the other side of her bed] Why does she do this every time?
HEIDI
What, babe?
CARTMAN
[urgently] I said it's time. Boy, look at the time.
HEIDI
'Kay, all set.
CARTMAN
[leaves the bedroom] 'Kay, here we go, going to the pumpkin patch.
HEIDI
[leaves the bedroom] Okay! Oh! I forgot my glitter lip gloss! [heads for the bathroom]
CARTMAN
You don't need glitter lip gloss!
HEIDI
[stops short of the bathroom, turns around and walks back] Eric, are you upset? Do you need to talk about something?
CARTMAN
No! No, we don't need to talk! Ah, I'm super happy!
HEIDI
Oh, okay. [heads back to the bathroom, and Cartman is dejected. Heidi looks back for a second] Hang on, I gotta pee. [closes the bathroom door]
CARTMAN
Cool, you got to pee again. Awesome.
[The woods, night. At a parking lot, several cars are parked next to each other. As Gerald pulls into a parking space, two other men get out of their own car.]
STEPHEN
Almost thought you guys were gonna bail on us.
RANDY
[chuckling] Yeah, right. We're gonna miss the first night of the party.
GERALD
Sup, Stephen, Chip.
CHIP
Just ready to party farty, witches. [holds up two six-packs of Samuel Adams beer]
RANDY
Well, I got the Jack.
THOMAS
[steps out of his truck with Steve] And I got the crack.
RANDY
Oh yeah! Jack and Crack Witch Week! Let's do this!
GERALD
Everybody up the hill! [the men proceed up the hill, singing Wang Chung's "Everybody Have Fun Tonight"]
THE MEN
Everybody have fun tonight
Jack and Crack Witch Week tonight
Everybod-
[The Turner house, evening. Heidi's parents have been chatting with Liane as they wait for the kids to come down the stairs.]
MR. TURNER
Thanks for taking the kids out tonight, Ms. Cartman. Heidi's been looking forward to it.
LIANE
Oh yes, my little Eric just loves the pumpkin patch. It's one of his favorite events of the year.
CARTMAN
Okay, come on, let's go.
LIANE
All right, you kids all ready?
CARTMAN
[directing his comments at Heidi upstairs] Yup. All set to go to the pumpkin patch! It's been open for over an hour now! [Heidi finally comes down the stairs]
NANCY TURNER
Ohoh, don't you look cute, Heidi.
CARTMAN
[goes to the front door and opens it] Awesome. Here we go, heading out now!
HEIDI
Hold on, Eric. I want a picture.
CARTMAN
No! Pumpkin patch is gonna, eh-
HEIDI
Will you take a picture, dad?
CARTMAN
See, all the best pumpkins get taken and then eh-
MR. TURNER
Cheese.
CARTMAN
Okay, come on! Here we go, going out the door! Go, Mom!
HEIDI
Bye Daddy! Love you!
CARTMAN
[at the car door] 'Kay, here we go to the pumpkin patch!
HEIDI
Oh crap. Hang on! I forgot my bracelet!
CARTMAN
[in the car] Oh my fucking God!
LIANE
Eric, potty mouth.
CARTMAN
Arrrrrrrrgh!
[The woods, night. Stephen starts a campfire. Randy serves up the Jack Daniels, then takes a drink and sighs. The other men drink their cups too. The men then share a crack pipe, and then they form a circle around the campfire and slowly go around it.]
THE MEN
Put a spell on our bosses. Put a spell on our wives. A hex on the Patriots. Let's fuck up their lives!
RANDY
And screw the Raiders too!
THE MEN
Yeah! [some time passes and they're getting wasted]
RANDY
No way. Check out Stephen, you guys.
STEPHEN
[walks around as if riding a broom] Heeheeheehee. Happy Witch Week! [falls to the ground face first] Ow. [the other men laugh at him.]
CHIP
[walks in with a book] Hey, HEY! [the partying stops] You guys wanna see some real witchcraft? [no one replies for a few seconds]
RANDY
Oooooooooooooo. [the men laugh]
CHIP
I mean it! I got this spell book last month. Got it in Salem, Massachusetts. They say it's real.
RANDY
Like real, how?
CHIP
Like from the Devil himself. You guys wanna try it?
THE MEN
Yeah.
[Dr. Spooky's Pumpkin Patch, night. People are leaving with pumpkins as Cartman and Heidi arrive. Cartman jumps out of the car and runs towards the patch.]
HEIDI
Hey, wait up, babe! [Cartman stops, closes his eyes, and stretches out his hand for Heidi to take when she catches up to him]
BUTTERS
[walks by with his pumpkin and his mom] Hey, where you been, Eric?
SCOTT
Oh boy! What a great time that was.
TICKET-TAKER
Thanks for coming, kids. [sees Cartman and Heidi approaching] Oh, you just getting here?
CARTMAN
Yeah, we are just getting here.
TICKET-TAKER
Okay uh, go on in, I suppose. Petting zoo's closed, and I think they stopped the churro machine.
CARTMAN
The petting zoo's cl- The petting zoo's closed?
TICKET-TAKER
Yeah. You can still maybe do the bouncy house.
HEIDI
Come on, babe!
[The woods, later. Chip is reading from the spell book.]
CHIP
Arkna. Peduum. Uthnod boral.
RANDY
That's pretty cool. [strikes up a crack pipe]
CHIP
Uthnod boral! Uthnod alvernderaal! Wickus! [a green glow emanates from the book] Stayfalls-wuh. Uh.
RANDY
Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa whoa.
CHIP
Ach. Oh, it burns!
STEPHEN
Okay, Chip. You might need to ease up on that crack there, buddy. [Chip drops the book and screams, and begins to transform into an actual witch. A broom flies to him and he rides off on it, cackling]
[South Park, night, seconds later. Chip flies over the town and past South Park Elementary, where the parent/teacher conference is being held.]
CHIP
I'll kill you all! Kill you all!
[Park County Community Center, moments later. Chip flies up cackling and begins lobbing flaming jack-o-lanterns at the adults there. One of them crashes into the parking lot and throws off a few people with its impact. Another one hits a car, stopping it in its tracks and wrecking it. The passengers get knocked out from the impact. Everyone else tries to disperse, screaming.]
CHIP
[cackling] You'll all be dead by Halloween! [cackles some more]
[Dr. Spooky's Pumpkin Patch. Everyone is running out.]
TICKET-TAKER
Get out! Everyone out!
CARTMAN
What do you mean?! I just got here!
TICKET-TAKER
There's a witch! [Chip flies in and starts bombing the patch]
HEIDI
Come on, Eric!
CARTMAN
No! I missed it! I missed it all! [Heidi pulls him away. Chip sees a boy, plucks him off the ground and carries him away]
[The Marsh house, next day. Randy comes down the stairs quite beat from the might before, goes to the fridge, gets out a gallon of fruit punch, and drinks straight from it, sighing with satisfaction. He turns and notices Sharon with her arms crossed.]
RANDY
Oh. Hey, didn't see you there.
SHARON
Did you hear anything about what happened last night?
RANDY
Uuuhhh, nnno, what happened?
SHARON
Your buddy, Chip Duncan? [holds up her phone, on which there's a news report about it] Apparently, he flew around on a broom, blew things up, and kidnapped some children?
RANDY
Are you serious?!
SHARON
You heard nothing about this?! He flew away vowing we'd all be dead by Halloween!
RANDY
[hands her back the phone and walks off] God, I knew that guy was a fuckin' chode!
SHARON
Randy, what did you guys do at that party?
RANDY
[turns around] Nothin'. We were just hangin' out and talkin' and stuff, and then Chip got all weird.
SHARON
People were hurt!
RANDY
Yeah, I agree! It's awful! We're not like Chip, okay?! He's a bad witch!
[South Park Elememntary cafeteria, lunchtime. The kids are nervous, looking over their shoulders. The core group of boys is at table eating lunch.]
KYLE
Did any of you guys actually see the witch?
JIMMY
Yeah, it was terrifying. She had a broom and a cackle and everything.
TOLKIEN
What are we gonna do, guys?
BUTTERS
Our parents are never gonna let us trick or treat with a flying witch around! [next to him, Cartman has an angry glare on his face]
KYLE
They say she blew up the pumpkin patch. Did any of you guys see that?
STAN
No, I missed the whole thing. I always try to get to the pumpkin patch really early.
BUTTERS
Yeah, I got there really early too. You get the best pumpkins that way. Anyways, I guess the witch destroyed the whole thing. [the camera begins to focus on Cartman's glare]
STAN
We've got to take matters into our own hands. None of us is safe.
BUTTERS
Yeah, but what are we gonna do?
KYLE
No, we've got to just hope the police will handle it.
STAN
Yeah, right. Like they'll handle anything. [from a nearby table, Heidi peeks past Bebe and smiles at Cartman, waving at him]
TOLKIEN
Stan's right. This might fall on us. [Cartman waves back, his glare fixed on her]
BUTTERS
Yeah, we've got to save Halloween. Don't you think so, Eric?
CARTMAN
[his concentration is broken] What?
BUTTERS
We've got to do something to get rid of her!
CARTMAN
Yes. You're right, guys. It's my only way out.
[The Marsh house, day. Sharon is watching TV on the sofa. Randy, in costume, walks past her with another case of Jack Daniels.]
RANDY
All right, see you, Sharon. Have a good night.
SHARON
[displeased] Where do you think you're going?
RANDY
What do you mean? It's Day 2 of Witch Week with the guys.
SHARON
[stands up] You can't possibly be considering doing this again!
RANDY
Why not?
SHARON
Randy, a real witch is flying around in the skies snatching children! I don't think this is the best time for you to be wearing a witch costume and partying!
RANDY
Wugh! Gau! Just because of one bad witch we're supposed to stop a tradition that goes back twenty-someodd years?! Jesus! [turns around and walks out the front door]
[Gerald's car. Randy walks to it and enters. The mood is subdued due to the flying witch.]
GERALD
Hey Randy.
RANDY
Sup guys?
RYAN
You know, just getting a bunch of shit for being witches.
RANDY
I know, right? It's like, there's one awful witch who wants to kill everybody, so now they're coming after all of us. This is like a witch... thingy.
STUART
It's like a witch pursuit thingy.
RANDY
A witch uhhh-
GERALD
It's a witch chase and shoot 'em up.
RANDY
Yeah, that's what it is!
[The woods, second night. The cars pull into the same lot as before, but now a sign is shown: Sentinel Hill park, which is closed. The men get out of their cars and walk up to another sign posted on an orange barricade.]
RYAN
Hey, what the hell is this?
RANDY
[reading the sign] "Park closed until further notice". That's bullshit!
STUART
Oh my God.
RANDY
They can't do this! The whole town really is on a witch pursuit thing!
[South Park, night. Chip is back in the air bombing houses, and people run to get out of the way. Chip spots Leroy and scoops him up.]
[Kyle's room, night. he's on his computer reading a Wikipedia article on witches. Stan, Kenny, and Butters stand behind him looking at the screen.]
KYLE
Check this out, you guys. It says that to destroy a witch you need bent pits, nine in all, each bent into an L shape.
STAN
What are bent pits? [Cartman walks in with some plans]
CARTMAN
Hey guys, I think I got it figured out.
STAN
You do?
BUTTERS
I knew Eric would come up with a plan! [Cartman puts up a drawing of his plan, which involves the boys luring Heidi to her death, burying the body, and celebrating her death with a pizza. He then brings out his retractable pointer and starts pointing]
CARTMAN
Okay, first of all, we need a scary place to lure her into. What is the creepiest place in town? Ross Dress for Less, that's right. Stan and Kyle will wait inside the Ross Dress for Less, and I will bring Heidi there. Once inside, Kenny and Butters will set off a series of explosions that will-
STAN
Wait wait wait wait. What the fuck are you talking about?
CARTMAN
This is how we're going to get rid of Heidi.
KYLE
Nobody's talking about getting rid of Heidi!
CARTMAN
You guys said you would help me get rid of her!
KYLE
OF THE WITCH!
CARTMAN
Who cares about a witch?! My life is a living hell, you guys!
KYLE
Then break up with her! You clearly can't stand her! LET THE POOR GIRL GO!
CARTMAN
I've tried! It's impossible!
KYLE
Heidi is a nice girl! How could you be so awful to her?!
CARTMAN
You don't understand! She has no time-management skills whatsoever! You don't know 'cause you've never had a girlfriend, Kyle! [Kyle just stares angrily at him] Fine. Just leave me to suffer. Next time you want me to kill someone for you, just forget about it! [leaves the room]
[South Park Elementary, day. The Mayor is speaking to the students and their parents in the gym.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Students and parents, I know that you are all concerned about the witch who is preying upon our town, and I wanna speak to you all about how to try and protect yourselves. But first, some gentlemen have asked to speak on what they perceive to be a [does air quotes] "witch pursuit thing". [walks off the stage as the gentlemen in costume get on stage and arrange themselves around the mic]
RICHARD
Oh wait, I'm supposed to be-
RANDY
Yeah, sure, no. [to Stuart] You go over there.
STUART
Right. Right right right. [music starts and they begin singing]
THE MEN
We're all on the same side, you and I.
Let's all stick togetha, let's try.
When things are going bad and there's people you need to confront.
Just be sure it doesn't turn into a witch pursuit thing.
STEPHEN
[as the other men provide ambient harmony] Hey guys, there's good witches and there's bad witches, and we stand with you in saying this particular witch needs to be brought down. But that doesn't men we should all be closing parks and stopping all witch activity because [catches up with the others on vocals]
THE MEN
Let's not turn this into a witch pursuit thing.
KYLE
[to Gerald] Dad, get out of here! We're trying to deal with an actual witch! Nobody's coming after you!
GERALD
Yes they are, boys! And next they'll be coming after you! 'Cause you're all little sons a witches!
RYAN
Right. You don't have to worry about us, going around snatching children. Only the other witch does that. [Cartman's face lights up and he looks at Heidi. He gets a mischievous look in his eyes]
[Later, school hallway. Heidi is at her locker.]
CARTMAN
Hey, babe.
HEIDI
Oh. Hey Eric.
CARTMAN
Listen uh, there's a big fun costume party tonight and I was thinking you and me should go. What do you say?
HEIDI
A costume party? With everything that's going on?
CARTMAN
Yeah, I just think, you know, we need to let off some steam and have a little Halloween fun, you know? I already have our costumes picked out.
HEIDI
Well... I guess.
CARTMAN
Cool. I'll pick you up at 5.
HEIDI
Well, maybe make it 4:30 if you're bringing the costumes. [Cartman turns left and walks away] I might need a little extra time getting ready.
CARTMAN
[stops, then mischievously] Ohohoh, I'm counting on it. [walks off]
[The Marsh house, day. One of the good witches rings the doorbell, and Randy lets him in.]
STEPHEN
Randy, can I talk to you?
RANDY
Sure, Stephen.
STEPHEN
I've been doing a lot of thinking, Randy. About the past. About what we've done. I think it's time we come clean and tell everyone about the crack. And the spells against our wives.
RANDY
[quickly closes the door and walks up to Stephen] Okay, look. You're freaked out, it's understandable.
STEPHEN
I have to admit what I've done wrong, Randy! I feel like everything's crashing down and I want Linda to hear it from me first.
RANDY
Okay, we smoked a little crack. We put harmless spells on our wives. We were just messing around, it was harmless fun.
STEPHEN
Was it? Or did we close our eyes to what Chip Duncan was becoming?
RANDY
Stephen, you can't turn on your own kind. That's what these witch pursuit thingies do, okay? They make everyone go crazy.
STEPHEN
I'm sorry, Randy. I have to clear my conscience.
RANDY
[sighs] All right, Stephen. At least give us till tomorrow morning to talk to our wives and prepare them, all right? Can you just give us till morning?
STEPHEN
Yeah, sure. [walks to the front door] I'm sorry.
RANDY
It's okay. It's okay. [Stephen leaves. A few second later, Randy is on the phone calling up someone] Hey, it's Randy. Weâ€™ve got until tomorrow morning to sacrifice Stephen to the Devil. I'll explain later, just get everyone together. And, maybe bring just a little bit of crack.
[The woods, night. Cartman and Heidi, dressed as Hansel and Gretel, wander through it.]
HEIDI
Don't you think we should stay on the main roads, Eric? This seems like a bad place to be right now.
CARTMAN
Don't worry, Heidi. This is the fastest way to the party. [loudly] I'm sure the witch won't even notice us.
HEIDI
Eric, come on, this is a bad idea. Let's turn around.
CARTMAN
Well, Heidi, if we'd been on time, we wouldn't need to take a short cut. But I wanted to give you your space to get ready.
HEIDI
[sensing the sarcasm] Is that what this is about? You're still mad about the pumpkin patch, aren't you?
CARTMAN
Why would I be mad? You wanted to make sure you looked right, and then you had to eat and use the bathroom 40 times. I can't blame you for missing the pumpkin patch.
HEIDI
I didn't use the bathroom 40 times! [Chip is heard above them] What was that? [the leaves in the trees rustle and she looks up] Eric! Did you hear that?! [she turns to see him, but he's gone] Eric?! Eric! Oh my God! Eric, are you okay?!
CHIP
[finally appears] Well, well. What have we here?
CARTMAN
[barely above a whisper, hiding behind a fallen tree trunk] Sweet. Come on, come on.
[Kyle's house, day. Stan, Kenny, and Butters show up, and Stan knocks on the door. Kyle answers the door.]
STAN
Dude, is your dad home?
KYLE
No, I, I don't know where he is.
STAN
We can't find our dads either.
BUTTERS
Yeah, and it turns out our dads and the bad witch were all part of the same witch group.
STAN
We asked our moms, and they said this has been going on for years. We've got to find them before something stupider happens.
KYLE
How are we gonna do that?
STAN
There's another guy. Someone else who was in the witches' club that hasn't been around for a while.
KYLE
Who?
[The White House, night. The President, also dressed as a witch, is in the Oval Office.]
PRESIDENT'S AIDE
[opens the door and looks in] Mr. President, you have an urgent call from a Butters Stotch?
GARRISON
[lost in thought, he perks up] Butters? What's he want? [picks up the phone at his desk] This is the President.
BUTTERS
Oh, uh, eh hello Mr. President. How are you?
STAN
[in Butters' room with Kyle and Kenny] Butter him up, Butters.
BUTTERS
How uh, how is runnin' the country going?
GARRISON
Oh, it's fine. You know, just makin' the country great again.
BUTTERS
Did you get rid of all the immigrants like you said?
GARRISON
I got rid of like, six of 'em so far. You know, it's a little harder than I thought.
BUTTERS
Cool. Ah-and did you build that big wall you were gonna build?
GARRISON
Don't be a dick, Butters. Are you just callin' to shit on my Halloween?
BUTTERS
N-no, sir! I uh, well, the thing is, uh, didn't you used to do J and C Witch Week with our dads?
GARRISON
Yeah, it was my favorite time of year. Now I just have to celebrate it alone.
BUTTERS
Well, the thing is, Mr. President, one of the guys did a spell and took a bunch of children, and he's gonna eat 'em all.
GARRISON
Lemme guess: Chip Duncan. Oh, that guy was always such a douche.
BUTTERS
Mr. President, please, you've gotta help. Our dads can't do anything 'cause they're scared people are comin' after all wtiches.
GARRISON
Comin' after all witches? Oh, Jeez...
[Park County Police Station, night. It's all decked out for Halloween.]
SGT. YATES
So you were there when the witch showed up and took your girlfriend.
CARTMAN
Yes, it just came out of nowhere. I tried to save Heidi, but it was too late.
SGT. YATES
What was your girlfriend wearing?
CARTMAN
She was dressed kind of like me, but had a simple Munich dirndl from Germany.
RICK
And you didn't stop at all to think that what you were doing might attract a witch?
CARTMAN
Excuse me?! Are you actually trying to blame the victim here?!
RICK
No, I'm just saying that if there's a big fat witch around, maybe you shouldn't walk around in the woods dressed as Hansel and Gretel.
CARTMAN
Ohhhhh!
SGT. YATES
Whoa, whoa, not cool, Rick. Not cool.
CARTMAN
I will have your badge, sir!
SGT. YATES
[looks towards the camera] Sorry folks, sorry.
COP 1
Detective! Detective! Call just came in. The witch has been spotted at Ross Dress For Less.
SGT. YATES
Everyone to Ross Dress For Less, now!
[Ross Dress For Less, night. Only a couple of cars are in the parking lot, and the store is closed. A witch wanders into view.]
STEPHEN
Guys? I'm here. Guys? What's this all about?
RANDY
Hello, Stephen.
STEPHEN
Oh, hey. What are we meeting here for?
RYAN
It's too late, Stephen. We called the police. We know you took those children.
STEPHEN
What? What uh, What are you doing?
STEVE
[accompanied by Stuart] Here he is, everybody! Stephen's a bad witch!
STEPHEN
Nooo! [people begin to gather around the witches]
RANDY
We're putting a stop to you, Stephen, because that's what good witches do!
STEPHEN
Oh my God! I see what this is! This witch pursuit thing has you on a witch pursuit thing now! [several police cars pull into the parking lot and officers pour out of them] I'm innocent. Please!
SGT. YATES
It's over, Stotch. What have you done with the children?
STEPHEN
Noho, don't you see?! They're just doing their own witch pursuit thingy now! This is madness! [Chip is heard cackling from up in the air. Everyone looks up to see him flying over Ross Dress For Less, then hug their kids to keep them safe]
CHIP
[lands and gets off the broom] Hey, what's up, bros?
STEPHEN
"What's up, bros?" Chip, do you see all the chaos you've caused?
CHIP
Yeah, so? I'm a witch.
RANDY
Ugh, you understand everyone associates us with you, right?
CHIP
Of course they do. You're all witches too, dudes!
STEVE
Not like you!
STUART
What'd you do with the children?
CHIP
They're all in here! See? [opens his bag]
KIDS
[voices heard while light emanates from the depth of the bag] Daddy, help! Mommy, help! Ahh!
CHIP
I'm going to use their souls to increase my power!
A TOWNSMAN
Look! Another witch is flying down now! [a shot of Air Force One flying towards town]
[Butters' room, night. He's typing something on his computer when Stan enters his room with Kyle and Kenny behind him.]
STAN
Butters, come on! We've gotta go!
BUTTERS
Okay! Where?
STAN
I guess our witches were gonna sacrifice your witch, but then the bad witch showed up and now the witch we called just arrived. There's witches everywhere!
BUTTERS
Holy moly! [leaves his chair and follows the others out]
[The Ross Dress For Less parking lot. Randy tries to reason with Chip.]
RANDY
Look, Chip, if we had known you were gonna hurt people, we would have never even hung out.
CHIP
Oh, give me a break, Randy.
RANDY
No, seriously.
CHIP
Like if one of you guys had the power I have, you wouldn't use it.
RANDY
No we wouldn't!
GARRISON
Excuse me. [makes his way to the front of the group]
CHIP
Oh, hey man!
GARRISON
You're ruining the party for everyone, Chip! I'm here to take you out!
CHIP
[cackles] You'll never stop me! [levitates] I grow more powerful every moment!
GARRISON
You wanna see real power? [into his pocket mic disguised as a lapel pin] All right, take the shot. [a solar-powered satellite takes aim at the President's location with three beeps, and two lasers shoot down towards it. The shot obliterates Chip, but his bag and broom fall away unscathed. A few moments of stunned silence, and the witches celebrate as Garrison fist-pumps. Two officers quickly come up and open the bag]
PETER
[pops out of the bag] I'm free! [two girls pop out]
A GIRL
Mommy! Daddy! [the boy Chip plucked first pops out of the bag]
SGT. YATES
Is that all of them?
COP 2
There's one more little girl. Come on out, little girl.
HEIDI
Okay. Just a second.
COP 2
Com- come on, little girl. Everyone's waitin' on ya.
HEIDI
Okay. Almost ready. Hang on.
CARTMAN
[sighs] It's gonna be a while.
GERALD
Well, we did it, guys.
RYAN
Everyone will be stoked on us now.
RANDY
Hey! And there's still a few nights left of Jack and Crack Witch Week.
GARRISON
Everybody follow me! I've got tons of Jack, tons of crack, and a jet! [the other witches cheer and follow him to the jet]
THE MEN
Party's back on! We did it, guys!
RANDY
[looks back at Sharon] Don't wait up, Sharon! I'm gonna party with El Presidente. [Sharon and remaining townspeople are mad]
[The Turner house, day, Heidi's room. Cartman waits for Heidi on her bed as she plans out her costume in the closet. They're dressed in traditional Halloween costumes, he as Count Dracula, she as a black kitten.]
HEIDI
All ready to trick or treat?
CARTMAN
[bored] Yeah, no. I've been ready for a couple hours now.
HEIDI
Cool. I just wanna put on some lip gloss. Do these stockings go with this outfit? I thought maybe I should use the red ones. [Cartman removes his fake teeth and throws them on the floor] Is it cold out? You think I should put a hoodie on over this? Nah, covers up my costume too much, don't you think? [Cartman throws his plastic jack-o-lantern pail to the floor] Okay, all ready. [Cartman perks up a bit] Oh wait, hang on. [she goes back into her closet, Cartman's perk is gone] I can't decide if I should wear leggings or not. Is it gonna be cold? Should I just-

synopsis:Kyle is playing with fire when he gets in the middle of Cartman and Heidiâ€™s relationship.

script:Doubling Down

[Heidi's house, night. She's in her room, in bed, but can't sleep. She has her phone with her, on her bed. A call comes in and she picks up. It's Cartman, of whom she has a wallpaper on her phone. She sighs and answers.]
HEIDI
[expectantly] Yes, Eric?
CARTMAN
[sobbing uncontrollably] Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi!-
HEIDI
Eric, this isn't working.
CARTMAN
Heid- Heidi, no, please! Heidi, Heidi, I would be nothing without you, okay? I'm sorry. Okay? Please!
HEIDI
You called me a whore and pushed me in front of a car.
CARTMAN
Heidi, I was in a bad mood! I told you, that's what happens after I eat! My blood sugar spikes and I get all anxious, and then I cra-
HEIDI
Eric, you just can't keep being mean to me and blaming it on your blood sugar.
CARTMAN
But ih, but it's true, Heidi! It's all my mom's fault. She feeds me all this crap, and my body doesn't know how to process it. Mom! Mom!
LIANE
Yes, hon?
CARTMAN
You fucked up my life, Mom! Fuck you! How could you feed me like that, you bitch?! Get outta here!
HEIDI
Eric, if blood sugar is really the problem, then you need to change how you eat, right?
CARTMAN
Right. Like, whattaya whattaya mean?
HEIDI
Eric, every time I've talked to you about maybe being a vegan with me, you just tell me vegans are pussies. But then you try and blame food and your mom for being-
CARTMAN
It is the food, and it is my mom, Heidi! It is! I wanna be vegan with you! I need your help to show me how. Please, Heidi. I need you right now, more than ever. I wand to do this. Please!
HEIDI
You really mean it?
CARTMAN
Yes, Heidi! That's how much I love you! I'm vegan from now on.
HEIDI
All right, Eric. We'll see how this goes, okay? See you tomorrow.
CARTMAN
Okay. Okay, bye, honey. [hangs up]
[The cafeteria, lunchtime. The boys are at their usual table chatting, and Cartman looks pissed again.]
CARTMAN
That dirty whore! Who does that bitch think she is?! Packing my lunch for me?! Fuck her, dude!
JIMMY
Pissed off at your girlfriend again, huh Eric?
CARTMAN
She's not a girlfriend! She's a controlling, manipulative whore!
KYLE
That's enough, Cartman! I am so sick of hearing you call Heidi horrible things!
CARTMAN
That's because you don't understand how much it sucks to be in a relationship!
HEIDI
[approaching] Hey babe.
CARTMAN
Oh hey babe, what's going on?
HEIDI
What are you up to?
CARTMAN
[uninterested] Nothin', just tellin' the guys how awesome it is to be vegan.
HEIDI
[happy] That's great. You wanna come eat with me? I can explain what I packed.
CARTMAN
Yeah, sure. That sounds awesome. [he leaves with her]
KYLE
I don't get it. I just really don't get it. How is she still supporting him?!
STAN
She loves him, I guess.
KYLE
But he clearly sucks! She has to know he sucks. What the hell is going on?!
BUTTERS
Well, it's not our problem.
KYLE
It is our problem. This is affecting us! Our whole school. There's got to be a reason she sticks by him.
[After school. The bell rings and kids pour out of the building.]
KYLE
[spots her and runs up] Oh Heidi? Heidi, you got a sec?
HEIDI
Oh. Hey Kyle.
KYLE
Hey. Uh, listen, uh... I-I know you and Cartman have an anniversary coming up and, I was just wondering, you know, um. How do you think he's doing? Aaas a boyfriend.
HEIDI
Well, whattaya mean?
KYLE
Well, you know, like, some of us are thinking that, uh, maybe he's not super-qualified to be with you?
HEIDI
Oh, God, not you too.
KYLE
Just, like, what are the things about Cartman that you find remotely redeeming?
HEIDI
Look, don't you think I get it enough from my girlfriends? "He sucks, Heidi. What's wrong with you? Why can't you admit he's a loser? How could anyone ever go with him?" I was just following my heart. Isn't that what you're supposed to do?
KYLE
You don't have to get defensive. I just-
HEIDI
[gets in his face] Who's being defensive?! He's great! We're doing great! I didn't make a bad decision! I don't need you to stand there and say "I told you so!" [turns around and walks off]
KYLE
I didn't say "I... [she whips around again] told you-"
HEIDI
[points at him] You know, you don't know what Eric's like when we're alone, okay? He's actually really good to me. [turns around and walks away]
KYLE
Wooow.
[Heidi's house, day. Cartman is at the front door knocking insistently. Heidi walks to it and opens it.]
CARTMAN
Heidi! [walks in with a bag of food] Oh my God, you're not gonna believe this.
HEIDI
What?
CARTMAN
You were so right [Heidi closes the door] when you said there were vegan options for everything. [puts the food on the table] Remember how you told me about Beyond Meat?
HEIDI
Yeah, the vegan meat that's made with all vegetables and plants.
CARTMAN
Well, I tried it and you were right. You can't even tell the difference between that and real meat.
HEIDI
Really? That's great, babe.
CARTMAN
So now I've been trying all kinds of vegan foods. You gotta try this. It's called Beyond KFC.
HEIDI
Oh wow.
CARTMAN
It's all plant based, soy protein, and just- y-you gotta taste it. Just try it.
HEIDI
[Heidi tries a breaded breast] It tasted just like KFC.
CARTMAN
I know, right?! Isn't that crazy?! [Cartman eats another breaded breast] Like, like seriously, how can you even tell that this was vegan? Try the, try the Beyond Mashed Potatoes and Gravy too. [hands her the mashed potatoes and gravy] They say you can even drink the Beyond Gravy by itself as like a protein boost. [eats some more of his breast while she eats the mashed potatoes and gravy] I don't know about you, but I could eat this every day.
HEIDI
Yeah, it's really good.
CARTMAN
[evilly narrowing his eyes to slits] Delicious.
[South Park Elementary, day. The bell rings as students go to their lockers to switch out books. As Stan, Kenny, and Butters walk down the hallway. Kyle catches up to them. Tolkien joins them as well.]
KYLE
Guys, listen: I think I know why Heidi won't admit Cartman's a horrible boyfriend.
STAN
Dude, are you still on this?
KYLE
Yeah! It's important.
BUTTERS
Maybe she's telling the truth, Kyle. Maybe Eric really does love and support her in ways that we don't see.
CARTMAN
[running up to them] You guys! You guys! Have you seen Heidi? [walks on past them]
STAN
No.
CARTMAN
Well uh, we've been trying some different foods lately and uh, [turns around] Heidi's put on some pounds, you guys.
TOLKIEN
Heidi's getting fat?
CARTMAN
Yeah, Tolkien. Don't start rippin' on me for havin' a fat girlfriend, alright? Just try and be cool about it. [smiles]
HEIDI
[walks up behind him] Hey babe.
CARTMAN
Oh, hey hey hey, Heidi. What's goin' on? [a surprised look flashes on his face]
HEIDI
I-ah, I'm not feeling the best again. [Cartman smiles again] I might see if my mom can come pick me up.
CARTMAN
Pick you up? That could be tough. [a shot at the boys, who just look blankly at him and Heidi. Kyle, though, is not amused]
HEIDI
I, I know, but I just feel bloated. I think there might have been something bad in that Beyond Arby's.
CARTMAN
Yeah, well, cool, babe. Maybe you should uh, just waddle on down to the nurse's office. [the surprised look flashes on his face again, then disappears]
HEIDI
Can you come with?
CARTMAN
Oh sure. [they turn around and walk away, but Cartman looks over his shoulder and points at Heidi's bloated figure]
KYLE
We have to help that girl. Can't you see what's happening?
STAN
Kyle, it's none of our business.
KYLE
You're wrong. In a way... I think we're all going out with Cartman right now.
[The Oval Office, day. The President is on the phone.]
GARRISON
Uh huh. Yeah, I understand that, faggot. And you should understand how my balls are gonna taste when your country starts needing money. I don't give two shits about a treaty. You're a Polish midget. [A knock is heard at the doors] Come in. [three advisers come in - Mike Pence, Paul Ryan, and Mitch McConnell - and Garrison gets back on the phone] Uh huh. Hang, uh hang on. I'm gonna call you back. Yeah, go fuck yourself, retard. [hangs up]
MITCH MCCONNELL
Mr. President, we have a problem. People are pretty upset.
GARRISON
Hoh, don't tell me people are still made about that n*gger thing.
MIKE PENCE
It's pronounced Niger, Mr. President. And it's a country in Africa.
GARRISON
Oh, aren't we fancy. Okay, I don't want a bunch of [finger quotes] Nigers in Africa aiding terrorists.
PAUL RYAN
Mr. President, you need to be a little more careful. There's an investigation. A worker with ties to Russia was found raped and executed.
GARRISON
Raped and executed? Oh, you mean fucked to death? Oh yeah, that was me.
MCCONNELL
Mr. President, people are starting to question your oath to the office.
GARRISON
My oath to the office was that I would fuck everyone to death, remember?
MEMBERBERRIES
Ooo, I 'member. Me too, I 'member. I 'member that.
GARRISON
[to the berries] You guys be quiet, [to his advisers] and you guys just get out there and put a positive spin on this whole thing.
MCCONNELL
How are we supposed to put a positive spin on it?
RYAN
It's getting pretty hard to keep defending you. Maybe it's time we put our foot down.
GARRISON
Oooo. [whips out a remote control and presses a button on it, making the doors close and lock automatically. The advisers turn to see this] Hope you brought some condoms.
[The school gym, day. Most of the girls are in vollyball practice, but six of them are in the bleachers. The side gym doors open and Kyle walks in. The girls stop practice only when he gets onto the court. He holds his hands up. The girls are not happy to see him.]
KYLE
Hello. I know things have been difficult between us lately. I know you think all boys are sort of pigs, but just know that a lot of us boys think girls are amazing and smart and beautiful. [dead air] Not, not like hot-beautiful, I mean like inside-beautiful. I, I'm not saying you're hot. You're not, you're not hot. I'm not saying you're ugly. It doesn't matter- you're all hot on the inside. If we could all just see inside you, it would be hot. [realizes he's out on a limb] Oh, shit.
WENDY
What do you want, Kyle?
KYLE
It's Heidi Turner. You guys shouldn't criticize her so much for going with Cartman.
ANNIE
Why not? Eric Cartman's a horrible person.
KYLE
I know! I, I know that, okay? Trust me, I hate Cartman as much as any of you, but just, give her some space, you know? You can't keep on saying "We told you so", because if you make her feel dumb, she just doubles down and tries to prove herself that it wasn't dumb.
NICHOLE
Why do you care? Do you like Heidi?
KYLE
No!
THERESA
Oh my God, he so likes Heidi.
LOLA
Obvi.
KYLE
No I don't! ... Do I?
[The school hallway, day. Kyle is sitting on some steps surprised at his fondness for Heidi showingn through.]
BUTTERS
[walks up to him] Hey, Kyle. Hey, I was thinkin' about what you said. How we should all help Heidi break up with Eric? You're right, it's our moral obligation.
KYLE
Yeah, no, we're not getting involved with that.
BUTTERS
Oh, we're not?
KYLE
[stands up]Yeah, no, yeah, I uh dya, I think we need to stay out of it. [walks away]
BUTTERS
Oh. Okay then.
[Cartman's locker, moments later. Cartman is switching out books when Kyle walks up to him.]
KYLE
Cartman, can we talk?
CARTMAN
Sure, Kyle. What's up? [brings out a harness and puts it on]
KYLE
I just, I hope that maybe you can realize what you have with Heidi and, and just try to be good to her, okay?
CARTMAN
Kyle, let me tell you something about relationships. There's always two sides, okay? You compromise, she compromises. Sometimes you criticize each other, but it's all part of trying to make each other better. [picks up a big bass drum and straps it onto the harness, then picks up some drumsticks] Someday, maybe you'll have a girlfriend and you'll understand. Oh, here she comes. [at the far end of the hallway, Heidi rounds the corner and walks towards them, and Cartman starts beating the drum] BOOM baba BOOM baba. Clear the hallway everyone, Heidi's comin' through.
HEIDI
[walks up to Cartman] Wha, what are you doing, Eric?
CARTMAN
I was just practicing marching bass drum for my buddy Kyle. It's his favorite.
HEIDI
Oh, okay. Um, are we still on for lunch?
CARTMAN
You betcha, can't wait.
HEIDI
Okay, see ya. [walks away, vaguely upset]
CARTMAN
[resumes the drum beat] BOOM baba BOOM baba BOOM!
[Breaking news.]
ANCHOR BILL KEEGAN
Some concern over the President's competency again today. It was during a Middle East peace conference when the President referred to the people of Saudi Arabia as a bunch of "dirty sand Nigers". Though the comments seem divisive, Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, says he's sticking by his President 100%. [next shot is of Paul Ryan with a black eye stained with semen]
REPORTER
Speaker Ryan, it's the anniversary of the President being elected. How do you think he's doing?
RYAN
Well whattaya mean? He's great. We're doing great. A lot of people judge him and just see the negative. People don't know how great the President can be behind closed doors. They don't get to see all his good qualities.
REPORTER
Uh huh. And is that semen on your black eye?
RYAN
Oh. No, I-uh I tripped on a doorknob and uh that's just, that's doorknob cum.
[The school gym, day. Heidi is all alone there, sitting on the bottom bleacher lost in thought. Kyle sees her from one end of the court. He sighs quietly and walks up to her.]
KYLE
You doin' okay, Heidi?
HEIDI
I keep thinking Eric's going to change.
KYLE
[sits down next to her and sighs] Heidi, people like Cartman, they always make things someone else's fault. We all wrongly see ourselves as the victims sometimes, but Cartman sees himself as the victim all the time. He'll always find someone to blame for his shortcomings, and because of that, he's never gonna change.
HEIDI
Before we started going out I was in a really bad place. I felt... pushed away by society. Then this guy came along who told me all the things I wanted to hear, and I just went with it. Does that make me a bad person? [Rihanna's "Unfaithful" begins to play]
KYLE
No, Heidi. Good people make bad decisions every day.
HEIDI
I've been defending him for so long. I don't know how I'm gonna face people if I finally give up. [next scene is Heidi looking through her scrapbook at the memories she and Cartman created together. His discomfort begins to show in the fourth picture. She closes the book, and her location is shown - she's in bed. Next scene shows her at her locker putting books away when she notices someone looking at her. It's Kyle, looking at her from his locker. He then puts his books into his locker. Next scene shows Heidi and Cartman at the park bench, where she leaves him and he grabs onto her leg to delay her departure. Next scene has Kyle receiving a letter from Heidi. He reads it and smiles. Next scene has Garrison and Xi Jinping holding a news conference, and three bar patrons back at home turning away and crying. Next scene shows the Turners having dinner at a restaurant, in a booth by the window]
CARTMAN
[sobbing outside the window] Please Heidi! [he pounds on the window a few times before finally sliding down to the ground] Please! [her parents are stunned. Next scene shows Kyle and Heidi on the school swings, chatting away]
[Tolkien's house, night. A light snow is falling when Cartman knocks on Tolkien's door. Tolkien answers and Cartman breaks out in tears.]
CARTMAN
Hei-... Hei- Hei- Hei-, Hei- .... Hei- [Tolkien slams the door on him. Seconds later the doorbell rings. Tolkien goes back to answer it] Hei-, Hei-, Hei-
TOLKIEN
[not happy] What do you want?
CARTMAN
Hei, Hei, Heidi broke up with me, Tolkien.
TOLKIEN
So?
CARTMAN
I have nothing now, Tolkien. She was my whole world. Can, can I just stay here with you, please?
TOLKIEN
What?! Why?! You still have a house!
CARTMAN
I know how you feel now, Tolkien. To be pissed off at the world. To feel completely screwed over by society. I totally get it now. I wanna do what you guys do and go disrespect the flag and flip over cars and stuff. [Again, Tolkien slams the door on him. Again the doorbell rings, and again Tolkien goes to answer it] Tolkien, pleeease! I'm sorry for everything! I really understand now how you guys feel! Please, what time is your family gonna go disrespect the flag and stuff? I wanna go with!
TOLKIEN
Get outta here!
LINDA
[appears behind Tolkien] What's going on?
TOLKIEN
[upset with Cartman] Nothing, Mom.
CARTMAN
Heidi broke up with meeeeee.
LINDA
Tolkien, he's freezing. [to Cartman] Come on in out of the snow.
CARTMAN
[entering] Thank youuuu.
TOLKIEN
...NO!!
[The White house. Paul Ryan opens a door and looks both ways down the hallway and closes the door. He's got a folder with him as he joins two other men in the dark.]
RYAN
Okay, we're safe to talk.
PENCE
It's not safe! Nowhere is safe, don't you understand?! We're all about to get killed!
RYAN
Sshh, keep your voices down! Look at this!
PENCE
What are all these numbers?
RYAN
The latest approval ratings. I've been researching our own independent poll. The President is tanking. These numbers are so low that we just might have an out. Well, don't you guys see what this means?
MCCONNELL
I don't know anything, I'm just a turtle.
RYAN
It means that the swing voters are turning against him. It's those people that matter. Those are the ones who can finally turn this thing around!
MCCONNELL
And then we don't have to get killed! We can't let the President know about this. just let him- [the door opens]
GARRISON
[walks in] What are you guys talkin' about?
PENCE
No, nothing, Mr. President.
RYAN
Nothing!
MCCONNELL
No, nope!
GARRISON
Just having' a little chat or somethin'?
PENCE
[looks at the folder Pence is holding, takes it, and walks over to the President] It's an opinion poll, Mr. President. Your numbers are down and I wanted to show you so you could do something.
RYAN
Oh, you bitch! [to the President] I was the one who researched the poll, Mr. President!
GARRISON
Let me see that. [takes the folder and leafs through it] Huh. Isn't that interesting? But it's not a problem. See, I know something about societal psychology that you three turd balls don't. Everything's gonna be fine.
[Tolkien's house, night. Cartman is eating dinner with them, still sniffling.]
CARTMAN
So... You guys about done with the soup?
LINDA
Don't you like it, Eric?
CARTMAN
Well yeah, no, it's great. It's just- well, what time do you guys usually go out and disrespect the flag and stuff?
STEVE
What?
CARTMAN
Oh no... Don't tell me you guys already disrespected the flag and flipped over cars today. Did I miss it?
STEVE
What the hell are you talking about?!
TOLKIEN
I told you not to let him in.
CARTMAN
Please, I don't know what to do with all this anger and hurt!
LINDA
I'm sorry your girlfriend broke up with you, Eric, but... maybe you'll get back together.
CARTMAN
No, no, we've broken up before, but this time it's different. I can tell. Something's changed with her. Heidi won't even answer my phone calls.
STEVE
Heidi? Turner? The Turners' daughter?
CARTMAN
Yeah...
STEVE
I thought she was with that Kyle Broflovski kid.
CARTMAN
[sadness switches to anger in a flash] What?
STEVE
I saw them at the park today holding hands.
CARTMAN
[dramatic music begins] Kyle? Kyle?! Kyle!! [a montage begins with five marching happy Kyles appearing] Kyle! Kyle! Kyle Kyle Kyle! [a big red heart appears and breaks, and a line of smiling Kyles marches out of it in shades of pink. Next scene is a Jewish dance performed by hasidim. Next scene is Cartman out on the street striking a match...] Kyle! [...and burning a giant flag on the ground with it.] Kyle! [the flames spread to fill up the screen. The next scene shows a cackling Kyle coming up out of the water like a giant sea monster as Eric and Heidi hold on to each other. Kyle holds a menorah reminiscent of a trident. Next scene is another group of hasidim dancing] Kyle! [next scene is Cartman and Heidi running away, only to be stopped by Kyle popping up before them like an exploding volcano, cackling. Cartman and Heidi turn and run away again, but the ground around them is compromised and Kyle's shadow covers them both as they look up at him. Next scene is back at the dining room at Tolkien's mansion] Kyle...
STEVE
Yeah, Kyle.
[South Park Elelentary, day. The school day begins as the last students walk in. Kyle walks down the hallway minding his own business when a scream makes him apprehensive.]
CARTMAN
KYLE! [the other kids in the hallway clear the way as Cartman appears at the end of the hallway behind Kyle. Dramatic Western showdown music plays] I should have known. You lying snake!
KYLE
[turns around] Cartman, I didn't mean for things to happen the way they did.
CARTMAN
Did it bother you that I was happy?! Is that why you took her from me, Kyle?!
KYLE
Cartman, you weren't happy.
CARTMAN
Shut up, Kyle!
KYLE
All you did was bitch about her all the time.
CARTMAN
You're not gonna talk your way out of this one! This is the end, Kyle! It's you or me!
KYLE
Come on, Cartman. I-
CARTMAN
[slams Kyle into the lockers] You took everything from me!
KYLE
Stop it!
CARTMAN
All you've ever done is work to ruin my life! Well now I'm finally gonna fight back!
BUTTERS
Fuck him up, Eric!
CARTMAN
[goes in for the attack] Aaah! [Kyle delivers a punch] Ugh! [Cartman goes down straight away] Fuck you, Kyle!
KYLE
I'm sorry, Cartman. You just have to accept that Heidi's moved on.
[Buca De Faggoncini, night. The girls have taken Heidi out for dinner.]
THERESA
Guys, I just wanna say, here's to Heidi. Welcome back to the land of the living.
THE OTHER GIRLS
Yay Heidi!
HEIDI
[giggles] Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking me out. This is really fun.
RED
No worries. We're just glad you finally came to your senses.
ANNIE
Yeah, no kidding. We seriously thought you might marry that piece of shit! [the girls laugh]
HEIDI
[a bit sheepish and embarrassed] Well, you know, he- he actually had some good qualities too.
RED
Uhh, yeah, like what? Racism?
BEBE
Or the sociopath part?
ISLA
Yeah. I mean, no offense, Heidi, but what the fuck were you thinking?
LOLA
Guys, she admitted she made a mistake.
THERESA
You make a mistake on your homework. What Heidi did was more like a momentary loss of all sanity. [the girls laugh]
HEIDI
[feeling pushed away again and feeling more embarrassed] It was just what I believed in.
BEBE
Don't worry, Heidi. We're not gonna keep telling you we told you so.
LOLA
But we told you so. [the girls laugh]
BEBE
The only thing I wanna know is... how did you bring yourself to actually KISS him?
THE GIRLS
Eewwww!
RED
Can you imagine? Eric Cartman's breath on your mouth?
THE GIRLS
Ew, ugh! [this is depressing Heidi as sad music begins to play]
ISLA
[imitating Cartman] Heidi, come here. I want to kiss you with my tongue!
THE GIRLS
Ew, ugh! [they laugh as Heidi wilts]
[The park, day. Cartman sits at the park bench alone. Heidi walks up to him.]
HEIDI
Hi Eric.
CARTMAN
What are you doing here?
HEIDI
I don't know. I think I- I just wanna make sure... you're doing okay. I want you to know I'll always care about you.
CARTMAN
[sniffles] That's good to know, 'cause like, nothing helps more when you're down than knowing that your girlfriend who broke up with you might care.
HEIDI
[sits next to him] I'm sorry that I've hurt you. I think maybe I am just stupid and I don't know what I want and it ends up hurting people.
CARTMAN
No... You need to know something, Heidi. None of this is your fault.
HEIDI
But I'm the one who-
CARTMAN
No. Heidi, none of this is your fault. There's stuff I never told you. It's time... It's time I did.
[Kyle's house, night. He's in the bathroom getting ready for a date with Heidi. He styles his hair and puts hair gel on it. The doorbell rings, and he goes to answer it, putting on his hat on his way there. He opens his door and finds Heidi facing away from him.]
HEIDI
Hey.
KYLE
Hey! You all set to go?
HEIDI
[walks in] I wanted to talk to you first.
KYLE
Okay, sure.
HEIDI
Kyle, I've been under a lot of stress lately, and it was all making me really confused.
KYLE
Yeah, that's understandable.
HEIDI
[turns and holds his hands] I was being manipulated, and I didn't even see it. I never do. And, I don't think you saw it either, Kyle.
KYLE
What do you mean?
HEIDI
I've come to realize that it's not my fault. It's your fault, Kyle. You made all this happen. Made me question who I was.
KYLE
But Heidi, I thought-
HEIDI
[puts her index finger on his lips] Shh. [walks away] But it's okay. You can't help it. It's how you were raised, what you were taught. My heritage is Irish, so I'm prone to being moody. And your heritage... well, you know... you can be a little sneaky sometimes and not even realize it. [turns left to walk out the door] I'm sorry, Kyle, but everybody's trying to live life the best they can. It's hard enough without your people always trying to get ahead. [walks out and closes the door]
KYLE
Dude... did she just call me a dirty Jew? [he walks to the window to see her walk away, and sees Cartman waiting for her. Cartman sees him at the window. Heidi meets Cartman and they walk away together, with Cartman looking over his shoulder at Kyle with a smug look on his face]
[The Oval Office, evening. Pence, Ryan, and McConnell carry an anniversary cake over to the President. They're still wearing blankets, which could mean the White House isn't wasting money on heating.]
PENCE, RYAN, MCCONNELL
Happy anniversary to you.
MCCONNELL
Cha cha cha.
PENCE, RYAN, MCCONNELL
Happy anniversary to you.
MCCONNELL
Cha cha cha.
PENCE, RYAN, MCCONNELL
Happy anniversary, Mr. President.
Happy anniversary to you.
[they put the cake on the desk, and the President blows out the candles]
RYAN
Congratulations, Mr. President.
MCCONNELL
Looks like many more years of the same are to come.
GARRISON
Oh, I don't think so. [walks out from behind the desk with a giant dildo strapped to his genitals.] I think the next three years are gonna be even better. [begins to laugh. Pence, Ryan, and McConnell laugh in response, but soon begin to cry, as they know what that dildo means]

synopsis:Jimmy and Timmyâ€™s experiment could win them first prize in the annual science fair.

script:Moss Piglets

[South Park Elementary, day, the Special Education Bungalow A-5. Class is in session, with Counselor Steve teaching.]
STEVE
Okay guys, it's November and who can tell me what that means? [points] Yes, Francis?
FRANCIS
It's time for the Special Ed Science Fair. [the other kids cheer]
STEVE
That's right, the Science Fair is this weekend, and I know you're all very excited to show the projects you've been working on. [more cheers] This week we'll be hearing all about your projects and first up we have Nathan and Mimallah. [amid some applause and chatter, Nathan and Mimsy walk in with their project, a volcano]
NATHAN
For our science fait project, we will be showing the destructive force of nature by simulating a volcano!
THE KIDS
Ooooooh.
NATHAN
With vinegar and baking soda, we will make this paper-mÃ¢chÃ© volcano EXPLODE.
THE KIDS
Aaaaaaa.
NATHAN
With the power and fury of Mount Kilauea. Our science fair project is sure to be... a blast. Get it? A. Blast.
STEVE
All right, what do you guys think of Nathan and Mimallah's project idea? [the kids clap and cheer]
NATHAN
We've done it, Mimsy. We're gonna win the science fair for sure. And then, every chick in this school is gonna wanna have sex with us.
MIMSY
Uh, gee boss, I don't know about sex with no chicken.
NATHAN
[smack] Not those chicks, numbskull. I'm talkin' 'bout bitches. You know what girls like? They like winners. And when we win the science fair, we're gonna be up to our ears in pussy.
[The school cafeteria, lunchtime. There are seven girls at a table with room for an eighth. The seven are Wendy, Nichole, Red, Theresa, Isla, Bebe, and Millie.]
WENDY
Is it just me, or are things around here getting worse and worse?
MILLIE
It's definitely not just you. I think everyone's in shock that Heidi went back to Cartman.
THERESA
What keeps driving her back to him? It's so weird.
ISLA
She's so... mean and angry these days.
WENDY
People change. They say you become more and more like the person you're with, and I guess it's true with Heidi.
HEIDI
[joins the girls at the table] Hey guys. What's up?
ISLA
[fearfully] Hey, Heidi.
HEIDI
What are you guys talkin' about?
NICHOLE
Nothing.
HEIDI
Bullcrap, you're all talkin' about me again. 'Cause you're judgmental bitches. [burps] Ehhh.
WENDY
Heidi, are you okay? It's just... you look...
HEIDI
I look what?
WENDY
Ngh, you know, y-you just look-
HEIDI
What? I look fat? Is that what you wanna say, Wendy? Fuck you, bitch!
THERESA
She's just concerned, Heidi.
HEIDI
[mimicking] "Mehmehmehmehmehhh, Heidi". I'm just trying to enjoy my lunch here! Can I do it without you guys shitting on all over me?!
[The Special Ed bungalow, day. Jimmy and Timmy are hard at work.]]
JIMMY
All right, good, Timmy. Test 42a is successful. Let's move on to the next phase. [Nathan and Mimsy walk in]
NATHAN
Well hello, gentlemen.
JIMMY
Oh hey fellas, we're doing great.
TIMMY
Timmih!
NATHAN
Thought we'd stop by to see how your- science fair project is going.
MIMSY
Dah I thought we was comin' to rub their faces in how good our science fair project was, boss.
NATHAN
[gets mad, then smacks Mimsy] Shut up, Mimsyyy! [to Jimmy and Timmy] So what are you guys workin' on?
JIMMY
Oh, it's fantastic. This year, Tim-Tim and I are doin' our project on [looks into the microscope] water bears.
NATHAN
Oh. Water bears. [backs up to Mimsy] You hear that, Mimsy? Like there's any such things as water bears. That blue science fair ribbon is as good as ours. [to Jimmy and Timmy] Well, we've gotta get back to our lava volcano. Good luck finding your, pft, water bears. [he and Mimsy turn around to walk out]
JIMMY
Oh, would you like to see them?
NATHAN
[he and Mimsy stop and turn] What? Uh what are you talking about?
JIMMY
Timmy and I have gathered thousands of water bears. Take a look in the microscope. [Nathan steps forward to look into the microscope. He sees some water bears swimming around on the specimen slide. Jimmy continues] Water bears are water-dwelling, eight-legged micro-animals.
TIMMY
Timmah.
JIMMY
They're one of nature's most resilient animals. [next slide] Studies have shown they can survive lava, and even the vacuum of space.
NATHAN
What-? How-? [looks up] Where the fuck did you learn about these things?
JIMMY
Where all good scientists learn from. Octonauts.
TIMMY
Octonauts!
JIMMY
Some scientists believe the study of water bears is key to human survival.
MIMSY
Aw jeez, that sounds a lot better than a lava volcano, huh boss?
NATHAN
Well, not really, because the science fair is supposed to be an experiment. I fail to see what the experiment is here.
JIMMY
Oh, that's easy. You see, for the past several weeks, Tim-Tim and me have been training the water bears to respond to different sound waves. We found that they respond best to Taylor Swift. Hit it, Timmy. [Timmy presses a button offscreen, and Taylor Swift's "Look What You Made Me Do" begins to play] Take a look. [the Water Bears soon form a circle of eight of them on the specimen slide. Timmy turns off the player] We still have some training to do, but we're excited about the results. I have to admit, your lava volcano is pretty great too. Maybe we could tie for first place. [Nathan looks at Jimmy, then at Timmy, in shock]
[Mr. Mackey's office, day. Someone knocks at his door]]
MACKEY
Come in.
HEIDI
[enters the office] You wanted to see me, Mr. Mackey?
MACKEY
Oh yes, Heidi, uh, we just wanted to see if you have transportation to the Special Ed Science Fair this weekend, or if you wanted us to set somethin' up for you.
HEIDI
What?
MACKEY
...Uh, Saturday is the science fair, and, you're the judge for the competition?
HEIDI
Judge a special needs science fair? Ahem, no thanks.
MACKEY
Well, Heidi, is there a problem with you bein' the judge this weekend?
HEIDI
Uhh, yeah? It's Saturday, and I don't wanna be at skewl?
MACKEY
But you're always the judge of the Special Ed Science Fair because you're our best science student.
HEIDI
So now I'm gonna be punished by being force to judge a bunch of handicapped kids?!
MACKEY
But... Okay, you see, the problem is that you volunteered last month, Heidi. You said you wanted to do it, m'kay?
HEIDI
Well how can you expect students to commit to things a month in advance?! [puts away a stray lock of hair under her cap] I don't even know what I want for dinner tonight.
MACKEY
Look, the kids have worked really hard and have done some amazing projects.
HEIDI
You're gonna force me to come to skewl on a Saturday?!
MACKEY
Heidi, eh... is everything all right?
HEIDI
Oh what? Are you gonna call me fat now too?! It just so happens I'm a vegan, which means it'd difficult for me to get enough protein, so my body doesn't burn fat, it burns muscle, which makes it look like I'm fat, but I'm actually WAY healthier than any of YOU!!
MACKEY
Heidi, you're judging the Special Ed Science Fair this weekend.
HEIDI
Oh, Goddammit!
[The Special Ed bungalow, night. Nathan goes up the wheelchair ramp to the room door.]
NATHAN
[looks around] Mimsy! Come on! [reaches the door]
MIMSY
Okay Nathan. [joins him]
NATHAN
Shhh, shut the fuck up! [picks the lock and opens the door. They go in, look around, then go to Jimmy and Timmy's project]
MIMSY
Gee, we could get in a lot of trouble. Ya, you sure we should mess with Jimmy and Timmy's science fair project?
NATHAN
Mimsy, do you know what Jimmy is? He's a cock blocker.
MIMSY
Eh what's a cock blocker?
NATHAN
Every time I come up with a way to score with the ladies, there's Jimmy tryin' to one-up me. This science fair is supposed to finally make us successful enough to get chicks.
MIMSY
D'aw, gee, I don't know if we should use our position of power to exploit women.
NATHAN
... [smacks Mimsy] I'm not letting those assholes win the science fair! [opens a medical bag] That's why I say, the only good water bears are dead water bears. [pulls out a bottle of lighter fluid and pours it into the tardigrade tank, then follows that up with a bottle of lye. He then gets a curling iron, plugs it in and turns it on, and sticks it into the tank, where it sparks and causes a chemical reaction] Let's go! [they run out of the bungalow as the reaction continues inside]
[The bus stop, day. Instead of the usual four boys standing there, it's four girls - Wendy, Isla, Theresa, and an angry Heidi.]
HEIDI
This is bullcrap! How can they force me to be the science fair judge?! Now I know how it feels to be a slave!
WENDY
It's... not exactly like being a slave, Heidi.
HEIDI
Yes it is! Am I being paid to judge the science fair? No. Do I have a choice? No. "Ohhh, yes masah. Lemme judge that science fair for ya, suh!"
THERESA
God, will you stop?!
HEIDI
Theresa, don't get all aggro on me because you're pissed off your family lives in a trailer.
THERESA
My family doesn't live in a trailer. We live in a tiny home. My parents downsized to make a smaller footprint on the environment.
HEIDI
That's what I said. Your family lives in a trailer.
THERESA
There's lots of progressive people living in tiny homes. There's five others on my block.
HEIDI
Right. That's called a "trailer park."
THERESA
[Embarrassed] A-hi don't live in a trailer park!
WENDY
[to Theresa, about Heidi] Just don't even respond to her. Just ignore her.
HEIDI
I'll try, but she's such a bitch.
ISLA
She wasn't talking to you, Heidi.
HEIDI
Oh, looks like Isla has something to say, you guys. Hold on, I'm sure this is going to be really profound. Go ahead, Isla, knock us out with you wit and satire. This should be good, you guys.
CARTMAN
[walks up to Heidi] Hey Heidi, what's up?
HEIDI
[uninterested] Oh hey babe, what's going on?
CARTMAN
What are you up to?
HEIDI
[her voice trails off] Nothiiing, just talking to my girlfriends about tiny homes.
[South Park Elementary, day. The school day has started and the last few students are going in. Nathan and Mimsy walk up to Nichole, Bebe, and Nelly.]
NATHAN
Well hello there, ladies.
NELLY
Oh, hi Nathan.
NATHAN
We just wanted to remind you [hand Nichole a flyer] that this weekend is the Special Ed Science Fair.
NICHOLE
Oh, cool.
NATHAN
Yeah, that's right. Pretty soon you'll all be impressed with what you see. Hope you can make it. [walks off with Mimsy. Moments later...] Did you see that, Mimsy? The way those girls bit their bottom lips when I said "science fair"? We're about to be drowning in muff.
FRANCIS
Nathan! Mimallah! Yuh, you've gotta get to Special Ed!
NATHAN
Special Ed class isn't for another two hours.
FRANCIS
Nono, you've gotta see this! Jimmy and Timmy's water bears! They've changed!
NATHAN
What?
[The Special Ed bungalow, moments later. Counselor Steve is checking out the specimen slide through the microscope as the class gathers around and chatters.]
STEVE
Jimmy and Timmy, this is incredible! You've somehow made them even smarter. [Francis, Nathan and Mimsy enter]
NATHAN
What's goin' on?
JIMMY
Nathan, it's amazing. The water bears we've trained are starting to display social advancements.
MIMSY
But they're supposed to be dead. [Nathan smacks him]
NATHAN
[walks up to Jimmy and Timmy's table] What social advancement?
JIMMY
They've actually evolved to the point of doing the hokey pokey.
NATHAN
The hokey pokey? [looks down into the microscope and sees the tardigrades. "The Hokey Pokey" plays as the water bears begin synchronized dancing] You've gotta be fucking kidding me.
STEVE
Boys, this might be the single greatest Special Ed Science Fair project I've ever seen!
[South Park Elementary, hallway. Cartman and Heidi walk down the hallway holding hands looking angry.]
HEIDI
Butters.
BUTTERS
Whoa. [turns around] Uh hey.
HEIDI
How would you like to be the judge for the Special Ed Science Fair this weekend?
BUTTERS
Uhh, I can't. I'm going to a birthday party.
CARTMAN
Butters, don't be a dick!
HEIDI
Yeah, don't make up excuses because judging handicapped students sounds terrible!
CARTMAN
Yeah, Butters! God! [rolls his eyes]
CLYDE
[walks up to Heidi and Cartman] He's not making it up. It's my birthday party.
CARTMAN
Well then, could you invite Heidi, please? She needs an excuse not to have to go to the Special Needs Science Fair.
STAN
[walks into view with Kyle] What's wrong with supporting them? They're our friends.
HEIDI
Because nobody wants to be trapped, in a gym, with Special Ed Science.
KYLE
Actually, some of their projects are pretty cool.
CARTMAN, AND HEIDI
Shut up, Kyle! [to each other] Samesies! [they kiss each other on the lips]
HEIDI
Look, it's all just a complete waste of time! It's not like the Special Ed Science Fair is actually gonna contribute to society. [a helicopter is heard over the school. In front of the school, the helicopter lands on the lawn as several black cars and vans roll up to the school. A bunch of men in black suits get out of the vehicles and walk into school]
JERRY JONES
[leading the men] Move. Move aside, kids. Official business!
AN NFL OWNER
Move it, children. [the kids make way for the NFL owners]
PC PRINCIPAL
Excuse me, can I help you?
JERRY JONES
We understand that you're about to have a science fair with some very interesting experiments.
PC PRINCIPAL
That's right, the science fair is this Saturday from 10 am to 2 pm.
JERRY JONES
We're here to help however we can. Your special ed department has all our resources and all our support. This science fair... just might be what saves us all.
[The school playground, day. As the other kids play, an upset Heidi walks around Cartman.]
HEIDI
What the hell is going on?! Everywhere I turn, people are being given handouts while I'm forced to work my ass off! It's total bullshit!
CARTMAN
Yeah... uh... Babe, uh I understand that you're pissed off, but, um, you know, it is recess. Maybe we should relax and have some fun?
HEIDI
[stops pacing] Relax?! How can I relax?! I get straight A's! I ace every test! And who gets all the support?! The Special Ed Department!
[The Special Ed bungalow, day. It's been considerably beefed up, with two tents, one on either side, connected to it, and an even bigger tent behind it. A tower with two satellite dishes and two poles with lights on them standing behind the smaller tents. Two workers haul some equipment up the ramp and into the classroom.]
JERRY JONES
Good. Bring it on in. These kids need to have access to everything they need.
JIMMY
Wow, look at this, Tim-Tim. They've all been researching water bears too.
JERRY JONES
That's correct. [two workers roll up a whiteboard with a diagram of a tardigrade on it, with parts of the body clearly labeled] Like you, we've come to realize that water bears are the key to our future. [walks up to the project right after Jimmy and Timmy do] Are these the special water bears that we read about on your school message board?
JIMMY
That's right. The water bears we've been working with appear to be evolving somehow.
JERRY JONES
Then they are the key to our survival, boys.
NATHAN
Gentlemen, perhaps I can interest you in a lava volcano. You won't believe your eyes when I add some simple baking soda.
JERRY JONES
[turns to face him] There's no time for that! We need everyone working on Jimmy and Timmy's project. I'm gonna let you kids all in on a little secret. We don't wanna create a panic, but... the End is very near. And we have very little time.
[The school gym, day. An assembly has been called and all the classes are there. Heid is at the podium while Cartman stands next to her.]
HEIDI
Fellow students, I have asked to speak today because of the hypocrisy and bullying that is coming from the administration at this so called... skewl. It is an outrage that our principal and counselor denand our participation in privileged programs that are outrageously overfunded. Why is it that the school allows funding that only goes to special needs students? Are the rest of us not special? If we are continually asked to work for no money and ask our parents to pay for our programs, then soon we will all be poor, and forced to live in a trailer park like Theresa.
THERESA
It's not a trailer!
HEIDI
Theresa, [that lock of hair comes down again] get over it, you live in a trailer park, it's not a big deal. [she puts the lock back in place]
CARTMAN
Uh, o-okay honey, you're kind of getting off-topic, sweetie.
HEIDI
What did you say?!
CARTMAN
Uh just, uh-uhm, I just want you to stay on point so we can get this over with.
HEIDI
GET THIS OVER WITH?! You're supposed to be supporting me!
CARTMAN
I am supporting you, sweetheart!
HEIDI
Being supportive doesn't mean you criticize me, asshole! Just forget it! My point is, if the school administration doesn't cancel the science fair, I will see to it that they are all fired for discrimination!
MACKEY
[standing by the gym doors, to PC Principal] She's... kind of like Cartman, but with the ability to follow through.
PC PRINCIPAL
Oh, dude. Bro.
[The Special Ed Bungalow, later. Jerry Jones and a few other owners stand behind Jimmy and some other students as Jimmy looks into the microscope.]
JIMMY
Francis, can you hand me the sound wave generator? [Francis hands it to him]
NATHAN
This is bullshit! The Special Ed Science Fair is turning into a lovefest for Jimmy and Timmy's project! They're gonna get all the fame and glory!
MIMSY
D'aw, I guess we kind of shot ourselves in the foot, huh boss? If it weren't for us, those water bears wouldn't have even gotten smarter in the first place.
NATHAN
[stops and thinks] Hey, Mimsy, that's right. They don't deserve the credit, we do. [speaks up] Uh, excuse me. If you're all trying to figure out why these water bears are different, you're talking to the wrong guys. [Everyone turns to face him]
JIMMY
Wha-what do you mean, Nathan?
NATHAN
Mimsy and I did some experimenting with the water bears on our own.
MIMSY
We was tryin' to kill 'em. [smack]
NATHAN
It was us who made them evolve, so we should be the ones working for the government.
JERRY JONES
The government? Wuh we aren't the government.
JIMMY
Yuh you're not the government? But you said you were here to help stop us from becoming extinct.
JERRY JONES
Not you, us. We're with... the NFL. Our fans are leaving at an exponential rate. We've been hit with anthem protests, protests of those protests, and worst of all, concussions. The more reports that come out, the more people are getting turned off by football. We've been experimenting with water bears because... we believe they are our last hope.
JIMMY
Oh, I get it. You've been experimenting with water bears to see how to make humans more impervious to concussions.
JERRY JONES
No. We've been experimenting with water bears to try and make them... FANS.
[NFL Sunday Night Football on NBC.]
SPORTSCASTER 1
A beautiful night for football here in Los Angeles as the Chargers take on the Buffalo Bills.
SPORTSCASTER 2
And a record sellout crowd here at the stadium. Football clearly more popular than over with a whopping 17 million in attendance. [shown are a smattering of fans, with the rest of the seats being occupied by small tanks of tardigrades]
SPORTSCASTER 1
The NFL, of course, working really hard to reach new viewers, and it looks like they found their answer in tardigrades.
SPORTSCASTER 2
[a camera crew focuses on one tank] The water bears are thrilled to be here and of course, love seeing themselves on the Jumbotron. [which shows that tank's sea bears onscreen] They're all ready for some football and enjoying the fan favorite Kiss Cam. [two tardigrades are shown kissing]
SPORTSCASTER 1
And we're ready for kickoff as the cheers of 17 million fans rock the stadium! [the Chargers kick off and the Bills catch the football and begin their charge. Nothing but crickets are heard as a Bills player is taken down]
[The Special Ed Bungalow, later. The NFL owners now look over Nathan's shoulders as he looks into the microscope. The other students are at their own tables.]
JERRY JONES
We're running out of time. We have to see if these water bears truly are different. Insert the box. [a fellow owner grabs a microscopic box with tweezers and carries it over to the table. He puts it into the specimen slide] Gently. What do you see now? [the tweezers are removed]
NATHAN
Ahhh, Iii see the box. [a microscopic FedEx box] What, what's in the box?
JERRY JONES
What are the water bears doing?
NATHAN
Uhhh, they're just walkin' around and ubb, oh wait! They appear to be interested in the box.
JERRY JONES
These water bears are different. [the classroom door opens and in walk Heidi, Cartman, Mr. Mackey and PC Principal]
PC PRINCIPAL
All right, everyone, listen up. Give me your attention please. Due to circumstances beyond our control, we are cancelling the Special Ed Science Fair. [the students begin to talk amongst themselves]
OWNERS
What? Cancelling?
JERRY JONES
You can't cancel the science fair. We're on the verge of a breakthrough here.
HEIDI
It's cancelled. You guys can get all this shit out of here and leave. Thank you!
JERRY JONES
You don't understand! The Special Ed Science Fair is our only hope!
MR. MACKEY
Oh I'm sorry, but um, our hands are tied... by Heidi. [Jones and the other owners whip out their guns]
JERRY JONES
I think you all fail to see the seriousness of our situation! Football is dying!
MR. MACKEY
[he and PC Principal put their hands up] Whoa, whoa whoa, okay.
JERRY JONES
[to another owner] Close the door! [the owner closes the door] Everyone back to work! Nobody... [two special ed kids and Cartman slip out of view] will stop this Special Ed Science Fair!
ANOTHER OWNER
[with his gun aimed at Nathan] Do what he says!
NATHAN
Oh! Uh okay, Jesus Christ!
HEIDI
[finds Cartman] Are you just gonna stand there?! Do something!
CARTMAN
What the hell do you want me to do?!
HEIDI
I want you to have some BALLS and act like you care about me!
CARTMAN
Heidi, you need to stop being such a bitch!
HEIDI
[gets closer to him] Call me a bitch again! Do it! [gets in his face] Call me a bitch again!
CARTMAN
You are... acting... like a... bad girlfriend.
HEIDI
That's what I thought!
NATHAN
Hey, uh wait a minute! The water bears have changed again. I think it's working.
JERRY JONES
Let me see that! [looks through the microscope] Yes. Yes, they're starting to adapt. [the water bears now sport jerseys from various teams. He increases the magnification] Sonofabitch, we just might have ourselves some fans! [stands up] Now quickly, children! We must replicate these water bears to create more! [Nathan gets back on the microscope]
HEIDI
If nobody else is going to do anything, I will! [runs up to the microscope, yanks the fish bowl from it, and runs to the door]
NATHAN
Wha-ah?
AN OWNER
The water bears!
[The playground, moments later. Heidi runs across it, followed by the NFL owners, followed by the special ed kids, followed by Mr. Mackey and PC Principal, ...followed by Cartman.]
CARTMAN
Heidi! Heidi, will you please listen to me?!
[The school hallway, moments later. Heidi runs down it, pushing other kids out of the way.]
HEIDI
Move it! Get the fuck out of the way! I said get out of the way, you assholes! [followiong are the NFL owners, the special ed kids, Mr. Mackey and PC Principal, ...and Cartman]
[The school entrance, moments later. Heidi goes out the front doors, but sees more NFL owners in front of her and she panics.]
ANOTHER OWNER
We got the fat girl, front of the school.
HEIDI
Shit! [turns around and goes back inside, only to see all the people chasing her down]
JERRY JONES
Little girl, stop! [Heidi begins to pant] It doesn't have to end this way.
CARTMAN
[makes his way to the front of the group] Move aside! Move aside! [finally sees Heidi] Heidi, seriously, you need to listen to me!
HEIDI
I don't... have to listen... to anybody!
CARTMAN
Yes, yes you do! You need to listen!
HEIDI
Fuck you!
CARTMAN
No, fuck you!
JERRY JONES
Little girl, please! What you have in your hand is very special.
HEIDI
Well I'm sick of everyone treating me like shit!
JERRY JONES
Think about the NFL. How much joy it brings to everyone!
NATHAN
Don't listen to them. Give the water bears to me. I deserve all the fame and bitches.
CARTMAN
Heidi, you've gotta stop being so angry.
JERRY JONES
Look, if you- if you don't do it for the NFL, what about humanity? Those creatures are showing the first signs of sentience. Think about what they could mean for science. For medicine. Making people better.
CARTMAN
Come on, babe. We all want the old Heidi back. [Heidi looks up at the balcony and notices Wendy, Theresa, and Isla looking down upon her]
HEIDI
[looks down at the water bears, then looks up again] Screw all you guys!
NFL OWNERS, SPECIAL ED KIDS
NOOOO! [Heidi chugs the fish bowl down like a college student, wipes her lips, then burps]
CARTMAN
Dude, wwow.
[Cartman's house, later. He and Heidi sit on the sofa, with Heidi doing all the eating and channel-switching while covered by a purple blanket.]
HEIDI
[angrily] Is there something you wanna talk about?
CARTMAN
No. I was just... trying to... figure out why you decided to drink 20,000 microanimals that were showing signs of intelligence.
HEIDI
Whatever. It's Saturday, and I'm not in skewl.
CARTMAN
Yeah, you're, you're not in skewl.
HEIDI
[goes back to eating chips] How come we never snuggle anymore?!
CARTMAN
[alarmed] Wha, what?
HEIDI
We used to snuggle all the time and it's totally gone away! What happened?!
CARTMAN
Well, but honey, we still-
HEIDI
SNUGGLE!
CARTMAN
[gets closer to her] Yes yes, let's, let's snuggle, yes. [she shares her blanket and snuggles]
HEIDI
Goddammit, how come there's nothin' to watch on Saturday but kids cartoons?!
BLUE HORSE ON TV
Hohall right, kids. Now let's do the hokey pokey. [begins to sing the song]
HEIDI
Oooo. [her belly begins to move to the music] What's goin' on in here?
CARTMAN
Oh, what is goin' on in here?
HEIDI
I feel somethin' moving around. I-it- [farts]
CARTMAN
Yeesh. [backs away]
HEIDI
[farts again] SNUGGLE!
CARTMAN
Okay, okay, honey. [gets close to her again, but she farts again] Eughah, ah.
[NFL Headquarters, New York City, day. Roger Goodell sits in his office flanked by two other officials.]
ROGER GOODELL
Well, did you have any luck, Mr. Jones?
JERRY JONES
I'm afraid, Commissioner, that the Special Ed Science Fair failed to produce more viable water bears.
OFFICLAL 1
Then the NFL truly has no hope.
OFFICLAL 2
We're done for.

Not quite. [a lab worker wheels something in and leaves] We were able to obtain somethin' else [picks up a beaker] that just might be our future. [pours the beaker into the volcano Nathan offered to him earlier]

synopsis:Itâ€™s never been more challenging to be a PC Principal.

script:SUPER HARD PCness

[Netflix headquarters, day. The President of Netflix is talking to some prospects.]
NETFLIX PRESIDENT
Welcome to Netflix. [smiles] Last year we approved 16 original shows and movies; and this year, it is our goal to make that number 1,087. That's why we here at Netflix are thrilled to be working with you two comedy geniuses, Terrance & Phillip. [Terrance & Phillip are shown, now as elderly gentlemen. Terrance raises his left leg slowly and lets out a wet fart. The president laughs and claps] Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Classic stuff. Now go ahead and pitch what you're thinking for your Netflix original series.
TERRANCE
Well, we were thinkin' that we'd do a show where Phillip and I are on a farm... with a cow.
PRESIDENT
[still enthused] Okay, I love it so far.
TERRANCE
[slowly] The sun is just starting to come up and then... I fart on Phillip.
PHILLIP
[slowly] And I say, "Terrance, you farted," and I fart on Terrance.
PRESIDENT
And it's like a back and forth kind of thing? It's sort of like a-?
PHILLIP
[slowly] It's like a back and forth kind of thing. I fart on him, he farts on...
PRESIDENT
On you. Got it!
PHILLIP
No! On the cow. [they both laugh]
PRESIDENT
Welcome to Netflix, you sons of bitches. YEAH!
TERRANCE & PHILLIP
Hooray!
[South Park Elementary, day. The kids are at their lockers switching out books. Other kids run by, causing a commotion. Craig and Tweek run by Stan holding hands.]
CRAIG
Come on, Tweek. Hurry!
STAN
What's going on?
TWEEK
[running by] Cartman and his girlfriend are fighting again. [Stan closes his locker door and joins the others. They get to the actual fight, where Heidi throws punches at Cartman]
CARTMAN
Oh. Uh. Oh. Ugh! Goddamn! [he punches her once] Oh. Sweetheart!
HEIDI
Piece of shit! [punches him four times, he grunts as he gets hit]
CARTMAN
Honey, I wanna watch Terrance & Phillip with my friends!
HEIDI
You promised we'd have a date night! [punches him twice]
CARTMAN
It's just one night, babe. Stan is having a viewing party, honey. [punches her once]
HEIDI
So then why can't I come?
CARTMAN
Terrance & Phillip is a guys' night thing, baby.
KYLE
[arrives to separate them] Uh, hey, hey, hey! What the hell are you all doing?
WENDY
Watching Heidi get her bitch-ass kicked!
HEIDI
Fuck you, Wendy!
CRAIG
Don't take that crap, Heidi! Let Cartman have it!
KYLE
Guys! Guys, this has gone on way too long. Can't we all stop being so mean to each other? [a moment of reflection around the crowd]
HEIDI
Shut up, Kyle. You sound like your mom. [everyone laughs]
CARTMAN
Th- that was awesome, baby. I love you. [reaches out and takes her hand]
HEIDI
I love you too, babe.
KIDS
Awww. [disappointed, everyone disperses]
CRAIG
Dammit.
BUTTERS
Fight's over. Kyle ruined it. [Kyle is left all alone in the hallway]
[The school gym, assembly. PC Principal addresses the kids.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright everyone, listen up. As you know, there's been a lot of bullying and insensitivity at our school. To counteract this, it is my firm belief that South Park Elementary is in desperate need of s a strong woman. So in looking for a new vice principal, we wanted to find a powerful, intelligent, and independent female to be a role model for us all. And with that said, I'd like to introduce our new vice principal, Strong Woman. [claps, then hands the mic to her as she walks up]
STRONG WOMAN
Thank you, PC Principal. Alright everyone, listen up. I'm the new vice principal of this school. My name is Strong Woman. I've already spent a few days here at the school watching and observing and we definitely have things we can all be working on. [at this point, Butters is whispering something in Clyde's ear]
PC PRINCIPAL
[snatches the mic from Strong Woman's hand] Hey! Stotch! You do not disrespect Strong Woman by talking when she's talking!
STRONG WOMAN
You really think I couldn't have handled that? Myself?
PC PRINCIPAL
Oh. Uh, I was just making sure everything was uh-
STRONG WOMAN
You really had to grab the mic out of my hand like that?
PC PRINCIPAL
Shit. I mean, no, sorry, sorry, I'm not u-, uh, here you go. [hands the mic back to her]
STRONG WOMAN
I want the girls here at this school to know that they can talk to me about anything, but I also want the boys to know what I'm looking for is a better place for everybody. [walks forward a bit] Turning this school around is going to take work from everyone.
PC PRINCIPAL
From everyone!
STRONG WOMAN
[glances back at him] Sorry, am I not doing this correctly?
PC PRINCIPAL
No. NO! Sorry, I thought I'd... add, just add for emphasis.
STRONG WOMAN
You felt it wasn't strong enough? Me just saying it?
PC PRINCIPAL
No-I, I'm... Uh, I'm sorry.
STRONG WOMAN
[sighs, turns back to students] I'm looking forward to being your vice principal, and I'm looking forward to turning this school around.
PC PRINCIPAL
[moves up] Alright, now if we have any q-
STRONG WOMAN
I'm not finished!
PC PRINCIPAL
[backs up] Right, right, uh, I'm sorry. Every- pay attention everybody!
[The Terrance & Phillip Show. As the announcers speak, the logos come up.]
ANNOUNCER 1
It's the Terrance & Phillip Sho-o-ow.
ANNOUNCER 2
On Netflix. [the camera pans down to the duo. Terrance holds a pitchfork]
PHILLIP
Hey Terrance, what did the black lawyer say to the Muslim priest?
TERRANCE
I don't know, Phillip. What? [Phillip climbs up a three-step ladder, turns around, and farts on Terrance. They laugh at each other. The kids watching at Stan's living room laugh at them, but Kyle looks rather disinterested. The doorbell rings]
STAN
Come in!
CARTMAN
[walks in with Heidi] Did we miss it?
STAN
It's just starting.
HEIDI
Oh look, honey. Kyle's mom is here. Shouldn't you be at temple, Ms. Broflovski? [Kyle is shocked as the others laugh]
CANADIAN MEXICAN
[walks into view] Hola. Would you like to buy some chimichangas?
TERRANCE
Si, mi amigo. [climbs onto the hay bale next to him as Phillip goes up the stepladder] Here, I'll give you two pesos. [he and Phillip take turns farting on the vendor. The kids in Stan's living room laugh]
HEIDI
Dude, that's awesome.
STAN
[notices Kyle isn't laughing] What, what's wrong, dude.
KYLE
For the first time I feel kind of bad for the person being farted on.
HEIDI
Uf, Kyle's mom doesn't like the cartoon, guys. Better shut it off. [everyone laughs]
CARTMAN
Baby, I fuckin' love you so much.
[South Park Elementary faculty room, day. PC Principal has called a faculty meeting.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright, everyone. Listen up. As you all know, we've been looking for a strong woman to take on the role of vice principal at this school. We couldn't be happier with the selection we've made and we're sure she'll be making our school a better place. So with that let me turn over the floor to our new vice principal, Strong Woman. [applause all around]
STRONG WOMAN
Thanks everyone. Alright, listen up. [gathers her papers up] I fully appreciate that some of you might be uncomfortable with me being here. Earlier today, I noticed that some faculty weren't sure whether to call me "Miss Woman" or just "Strong." If I were a man, you'd probably address me as Vice Principal Woman, so why should it be any different, huh? We good?
MR. MACKEY
Uhm'kay.
STRONG WOMAN
So I've been getting to know some of the students here and I'm definitely hearing a lot of frustration and confusion over issues that all the schools are facing right now. I also spent some time observing in the cafeteria and was pretty shocked by the abusive and intolerant language. [as she speaks, Hootie & The Blowfish's "Hold My Hand" begins to play in PC Principal's head] Not sure if any of you have noticed, but a lot of the girls are eating their lunches out on the playground to avoid being around the toxic environment that's been created. It's my intention to make the cafeteria... P.E. class is another huge problem at this school. The girls' gym outfits seem not to have been updated since the '60s. We have a lot of work to do here. I intend to do it quickly. [in PC Principal's mind, everything around her fades out and all he sees is her against a pink background with hearts everywhere, soon replaced by flowers and leaves, then a blue sky with clouds]
MR. MACKEY
Excuse me uh, I'm sorry, but uh, is anyone else hearing Hootie & The Blowfish like, very very softly?
SUBSTITUTE TEACHER
Yeah, yeah, I hear it.
STRONG WOMAN
[rises and walks towards PC Principal] It's, it's coming from over here somewhere.
PC PRINCIPAL
E-excuse me everyone, I um, I need to get to the restroom. Sorry, I'll be right back. [rushes out the door, and the song disappears with him]
[The playground, recess. Kyle is on his iPhone lookiing at YouTube videos of Terrance & Phillip over the years. First is a teen Terrance farting on Cher on the Soony & Cher Show, then a teen Phillip farts and sits on Sonny. Next is a video of Terrance & Phillip farting on a deer, then one of Terrance & Phillip farting on a woman and her dog, then one of Terrance farting on a News Canada reporter, then one of Terrance & Phillip farting on a woman and her baby. A song comes up, reminiscent of Michael Jackson's "Man In The Mirror".]
THE PREACHER
Therefore what God hath joined together let no man [Terrance farts on the preacher] Oh! [the duo laugh. Kyle just gets off the merry-go-round and walks off campus. He walks onto a small stone bridge, where he looks at his reflection on the water below. He then leaves the bridge and goes home to look at his reflection on full-length mirror in his room. He takes off his jacket and hangs it up]
MICHAEL JACKSON
That's it. That's it, Kyle. [Kyle takes off his Terrance & Phillip T-shirt and puts it away is his trash can, then goes to his dresser to pull out a baby blue shirt and puts it on. He then goes to the vanity mirror, takes off his hat, and gives himself a haircut] No more. No more of them doody jokes. [he leaves the bathroom and goes back to the mirror in his room] No more watching cartoons of people, people having go doody. [he checks himself out on the mirror] And poo-pooing on each other's heads. [he puts on his jacket and hat back on] It's not funny anymore, is it, Kyle? [he checks himself out once more]
[Dr. Gauche's office, day. PC Principal has gone in to have his hearing checked. Hootie & The Blowfish is still in his head. The doctor walks in.]
DOCTOR
Hello there, misterr... Principal, is it?
PC PRINCIPAL
That's right, I'm PC Principal.
DOCTOR
Hm what's bringing you in today?
PC PRINCIPAL
I'm uh... having this problem with my ears. There's like a persistent kind of ahh ringing going on.
DOCTOR
[checking the right ear canal with a scope] O-kay, can you describe the ringing?
PC PRINCIPAL
It's um, Hootie & The Blowfish.
DOCTOR
You're hearing a song? [walks to the other side to check out the left eat canal]
PC PRINCIPAL
Yeah, uh, ahem, there's a new woman that has joined our faculty. Her name is Strong Woman, and uh, she seems to have set off some kind of device in my ears.
DOCTOR
So maybe you're having some feelings for her.
PC PRINCIPAL
No, that couldn't be it. We work in the same place, so it would be impossible for me to like her. I'm thinking there's some sort of device in my ears.
DOCTOR
Well, I looked, and Hootie & The Blowfish aren't in your ears. I believe you're hearing them in your mind and your heart.
PC PRINCIPAL
Oh, dude. Bro.
[Vice Principal Strong Woman's office, day. Kyle stands outsdie the office door. To one side are "What is Gender" pamphlets for boys and girls separately. Kyle knocks on the door.]
STRONG WOMAN
You may enter. [Kyle walks in and sees her putting her books in order]
KYLE
Vice Principal Woman?
STRONG WOMAN
Yes? [sits at her desk] What can I do for you?
KYLE
My name's Kyle, and I've been doing a lot of changing lately. I came because I might be able to offer some... insight into our problem here.
STRONG WOMAN
Please, by all means.
KYLE
You see, there's a culture at this school that embraces meanness, and I believe now that it comes from a Canadian TV show. All the boys watch it. I did too. We all laughed while they... farted... on innocent people's heads. The thing is, I never felt for the person being farted on. Until now. I want to work with you to open people's eyes, because I get it now.
STRONG WOMAN
[not following] You want to blame farts? That seems kind of ridiculous, doesn't it?
KYLE
What?
STRONG WOMAN
I mean, it's a slippery slope when we start pointing the finger at our own shortcomings.
KYLE
But, but I thought for sure YOU would be on my side.
STRONG WOMAN
Kind of sounds like something my mother would say, actually.
KYLE
What?? D'oh, forget it! [turns around and walks out]
[The school hallways. Kyle walks by himself as other kids are at their lockers. Cartman's voice is heard over the PA system.]
CARTMAN
May I have your attention please? Mrs. Broflovski, your tampons are available at the front desk. Mrs. Broflovski, your tampons are available at the front desk. Thank you. [begins to laugh. The kids around Kyle begin to laugh as well]
HEIDI
[over the PA system] Come on, we've gotta get out of here.
KYLE
Rrrrr!
[PC Principal's office, later. PC Principal tries to block out "Hold My Hand" from his ears, but it only gets louder. His office door opens.]
MR. MACKEY
You wanted to see me, PC Principal?
PC PRINCIPAL
Uh YES. Yes, Mackey, um, I just wanted to see how you thought it was going with Strong Woman.
MR. MACKEY
Well, she seems to be acclimating fine, ukay, the kids really respect her.
PC PRINCIPAL
Do you know, uh, [begins to fumble on his words] Do you know if Strong Woman has a boyfriend?
MR. MACKEY
What??
PC PRINCIPAL
No-nothing. Just forget it. [leaves his desk and walks towards the door]
MR. MACKEY
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?! Askin' if a coworker is available in today's times?!
PC PRINCIPAL
I just wanted to know because she's unavailable, then maybe I can get my head off of her, alright?
MR. MACKEY
Oh boy, this is bad! This is real bad!
PC PRINCIPAL
[turns around] I don't know how it happened. I know it's inappropriate and yet I can't stop thinking about her. I think I'm... sick.
MR. MACKEY
Look, this is real fucking fire you're dealing with, uhkay?! I'm gonna get someone down here from HR!
PC PRINCIPAL
HR? Is that like... Hootie Removal?
MR. MACKEY
No! Human resources! The people that come in to make sure everything's kept on the level! We gotta get you back on track!
[Special Report.]
ANCHOR TOM
Is Canada a bad influence on the United States? A group of young people called "Millennials Against Canada" thinks so, and we are joined by their leader, Kyle Broflovski.
KYLE
Thanks for having me, Tom.
ANCHOR TOM
Young man, you say Canada is to blame for most of our problems.
KYLE
All I'm saying is that there's a culture that originates from Canada which is at least partly to blame for the state of our country now.
ANCHOR TOM
To respond to this we're now joined by the Canadian Minister of Streaming.
MINISTER OF STREAMING
Thanks for having me, buddeh.
ANCHOR TOM
Minister, how do you answer to these angry millennials?
MINISTER OF STREAMING
Well, they're pissed off because their country sucks, so they wanna point the finger at us.
KYLE
I'm saying we're all guilty too. I grew up watching Terrance & Phillip, and I thought it was funny.
MINISTER OF STREAMING
So you thought it was funny, but now it's not funny?
KYLE
No, it was never funny. I see it differently now.
MINISTER OF STREAMING
Oh, so you want to censor it.
KYLE
We don't wanna censor it, we just wanna... get rid of it.
MINISTER OF STREAMING
Uh huh, you sound like a Jewish mother.
KYLE
Oh, see? That's what I'm talking about, right there! That kind of mean, degrading, Canadian trash!
MINISTER OF STREAMING
Now I resent that! I find that racist-
KYLE
Canadians should care about the rest of the world!
MINISTER OF STREAMING
You are a racist, fwiend, and if you have a problem with Canada, maybe you should speak to your backwards President!
KYLE
Maybe I will!
MINISTER OF STREAMING
'Kay, go ahead!
KYLE
Maybe I know the President!
MINISTER OF STREAMING
Oh, sure you do! Just like all Jewish moms, 'cause you don't understand how-
KYLE
Stop calling me that!
MINISTER OF STREAMING
Can I finish?!
KYLE
That's all you know is how to be mean-
MINISTER OF STREAMING
That's not a- Can I finish, please?!
KYLE
Because you were all raised on it yourselves!
MINISTER OF STREAMING
Please, can I finish?! [a few seconds of silence] Alright, I'm finished.
[South Park Elementary faculty room, day. PC Principal has called a faculty meeting.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright, everyone. Listen up. As you know, we want to provide a safe work environment for all our employees. Sometimes feelings do arise and we are tempted by the Devil to act upon them. So we've been reaching out to Human Resources division as I think we can all use someone to tell us about what is and isn't considered misconduct. She has some great advice for us, so please welcome Heather Conduct. Go ahead, Miss Conduct.
MISS CONDUCT
Hello, everyone, my name is Miss Conduct. I'm hear to talk about making sure we avoid any trouble at this school. M'alright?
MR. MACKEY
[smiles] Uh m'kay.
MISS CONDUCT
M'alright. Now, by a show of hands, who's ever had inappropriate feelings for a coworker? [After a couple seconds of silence, Strong Woman is the only one to raise her hand, leaving PC Principal surprised.]
[The Terrance & Phillip Show, guest-starring a Canadian girl scout selling cookies.]
PHILLIP
Well hello there, little girl.
TERRANCE
Are you selling girl scout cookies?
GIRL
Well yes I am. How about a Snickerdoodle?
PHILLIP
Alright, you asked for it. [raises his right leg up high slowly and farts on the girl. The duo laugh] Oh! Oh, I think I shit my pants.
KYLE
[runs into view blowing a referee whistle] Alright! That's it! Everyone stop! We're shutting it down! [the show's crew is stunned, and adult members of Millennials Against Canada come in and confiscate the equipment] We are Millennials Against Canada. We demand this kind of bullying Canadian entertainment be stopped!
TERRANCE
Didn't think I'd live long enough to see this all happen again.
[Breaking News.]
ANCHOR TOM
More and more millennials are turning into Jewish mothers today as they demand the censorship of entertainment. The protesters say they're not giving up and are demanding to speak with the President of the United States.
M.A.C. PROTESTER 1
[walks up to Kyle with a ringing cell phone] Here you go. Call is coming in on your phone.
KYLE
Good. Give it here. [receives it and answers] Yes, hello? This is the leader of Millennials Against Canada.
STAN
[calling from his living room] Kyle, what the fuck are you doing? [Everyone present at the viewing party is there again, except Kyle]
KYLE
Oh, I'm sorry I'm taking a stand and doing something. I realize this doesn't gel with your nihilism!
STAN
Okay, dude. I didn't wanna have to say this, but you're really starting to sound like your mom.
KYLE
I'm not like my mom! I'm gonna make a difference! It's gonna feel real good!
TWEEK
[runs up and takes the phone from Stan] Kyle! Kyle! Don't do this, man! You can't mess with this shit while You Know Who is in office! We're all gonna die!
[South Park Elementary faculty room, day. Miss Conduct holds the floor.]
MISS CONDUCT
M'alright, so now everyone, we're gonna do some role-playing, m'alright? Talk about appropriate ways we can talk in the workplace. Can I, can I get a volunteer to role-play with me? M'alright? [looks towards Mackey] How about you, Mr. uh...
MR. MACKEY
Mr. Mackey.
MISS CONDUCT
M'alright, come on up here. [he joins her] M'alright now, we're just gonna pretend it's a normal mornin' before work, and we're startin' the day. [shakes hand] Oh, Mr. Mackey. Good mornin'!
MR. MACKEY
[a bit awkward] Good morning, uh, Miss Conduct.
MISS CONDUCT
Now, did you have a nice night?
MR. MACKEY
Yeah, yeah it was good.
MISS CONDUCT
M'alright. Okay. Uh good luck today, and I hope that our workin' relationship can continue to be honest and straightforward.
MR. MACKEY
Oh, ah I'm very open and honest, I promise you that.
MISS CONDUCT
I can see that. You got very honest eyes, m'alright. [turns to the rest of the faculty] M'alright, I probably shouldn't have said "You have honest eyes", m'alright. That's a big crossin' the line, commentin' on his physical attributes, m'alright? That's bad. I'm gonna stick to just talkin' about work only, m'alright? [back to Mr. Mackey] So, uh, Mr. Mackey, what methods do you use for counseling the students?
MR. MACKEY
Oh, I mostly use a semi-cognitive approach adapted by Kiezrick Solomon.
MISS CONDUCT
Wow, you studied Solomon? He was actually my thesis in college.
MR. MACKEY
Are you serious? Nobody I talked to has ever even heard of him!
MISS CONDUCT
No! Same here! What made you attracted to his work?
MR. MACKEY
Well it's just such a na-natural approach, m'kay?
MISS CONDUCT
M'alright, m'alright.
MR. MACKEY
When I read it, you know, first I was like "whoa, okay!"
MISS CONDUCT
M'alright.
MR. MACKEY
"This just really makes sense", you know?
MISS CONDUCT
[giggles] Well, m'alright.
MR. MACKEY
Mmmm'kay
MISS CONDUCT
M'alright. [they smile at each other]
[Washington, D.C., day. The Minister of Streaming rides into town with four bodyguards and pull up to the White House. The minister walks into the Oval Office with two of his guards.]
MINISTER OF STREAMING
Mr. President! You need to do something about your millennials!
PRESIDENT GARRISON
[plucking with his eyebrows] What do you want me to do?
MINISTER OF STREAMING
Terrance & Phillip are Canada's largest export! They account for 80% of our gross national product! If your citizens mess with them, they mess with all of us!
GARRISON
Look, I'm President of the United States. I can't get involved in every petty little protest against a third-world country.
MINISTER OF STREAMING
Third-world country?! [steps forward] How dare you! Canada is second-world at least! [reaches the desk] Now you listen here, Mr. Buddeh! Either you stop the embargo on The Terrance & Phillip Show, or we'll bring in our own troops to stop it ourselves!
GARRISON
Are you threatening us, you beady-eyed Canuck?
MINISTER OF STREAMING
I'm simply telling you that Canada will do what it must to protect itself!
GARRISON
Then I guess both our countries better be prepared.
[The faculty room, continuing. Mr. Mackey and Miss Conduct are now sitting on folding chairs enjoying their conversation, holding cups of coffee in their hands, crossing their right legs over their left ones.]
MR. MACKEY
And then, you know, I was-I was looking to get away from the city. [uncrosses his legs] I've never really been a city person.
MISS CONDUCT
M'alright, m'alright, I definitely get that, m'alright.
MR. MACKEY
[crosses his legs again] I like hikin' around, bein' around in nature, m'kay.
MISS CONDUCT
No, I agree, I agree, the city's bad. I love hikin' too. What are some of your favorite places?
MR. MACKEY
Well, you know, Mt. Evens is always nice.
MISS CONDUCT
[chuckles] M'alright, m'alright. [they uncross their legs as a siren sounds]
STRONG WOMAN
What the hell is that?
MR. ADLER
[checks his phone] There's some kind of... military alert going out.
PC PRINCIPAL
[stands up and looks out the window] All right, military alert, everyone! Let's get to the hallways and get the students to the gymnasium! Come on, let's move!
[The Terrance & Phillip Show set, day. There's a break in taping, since no one is moving. Helicopters are heard in the distance, police sirens are heard arriving.]
M.A.C. PROTESTER 2
[looks out a window] It's the National Guard.
KYLE
The National Guard?
M.A.C. PROTESTER 1
It's the President. He wants to talk to you. [hands him the phone]
KYLE
Yes. This is Millennials Against Canada.
GARRISON
Yeah, listen, this thing's kind of escalating. You people need to call it quits.
KYLE
We can't do that, Mr. President. Someone has to do what's right.
GARRISON
What exactly do you want?
KYLE
What do I want? I want a world... where laughter doesn't come at someone else's expense. Where people can live freely without fear of being farted on. I want a world where you aren't ridiculed for trying to help. A world where a nice girl that I liked isn't turned into another Eric Cartman! These Canadians are in the way of that world, and everything they do and everything they have done needs to be erased from the Earth!
GARRISON
Jeez, I got a little chub.
[South Park Elementary, hallways, day. Students run towards the gym as PC Principal and Strong Woman round them up and herd them there.]
STRONG WOMAN
Let's go! Everyone to the gymnasium now!
PC PRINCIPAL
You heard her! Move it, people! [more students run towards the gym. As the last of them runs by, he turns around] I have to make sure all the classes are empty. You go take cover with the kids.
STRONG WOMAN
I'm coming too. I'm your vice principal.
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright, come on! [they reach the faculty room] Oh no.
STRONG WOMAN
What's wrong?
PC PRINCIPAL
Vice Principal Woman, I need to ask you something.
STRONG WOMAN
Okay?
PC PRINCIPAL
This is very difficult, but, uh...
STRONG WOMAN
What? What?
PC PRINCIPAL
[clears his throat] Well, as you can see, there's a door in front of us.
STRONG WOMAN
Yes, there is.
PC PRINCIPAL
I would like to open this door for you. However, I understand the gender-based biases this can imply.
STRONG WOMAN
Why do you need to open the door?
PC PRINCIPAL
I don't need to open the door. I'd just be opening it and holding it the same way I would for Counselor Mackey, a student, anyone else.
STRONG WOMAN
Somebody's gonna have to open the door, or we could die out here.
[A second or two later, and they both reach for the doorknob. Her right hand gets there first and he wraps his left hand around her wright hand. They look at each other as "Hold My Hand" plays again. The kids are now in the gym with their teachers and other faculty. The President opens a briefcase and takes out a key with which to activate the suitcase. He puts the key in the lock and turns it, triggering a green light, and types in the numerical code that will launch a bomb onto Canada. Sometime later, a bomb falls onto Toronto, Canada, and blows it up, sending up hundreds of Canadians to their deaths. PC Principal takes off his glasses and he and Strong Woman gaze into each other's eyes. More Canadian bodies fly around. At the Terrance & Phillip show set, Kyle walks up to a TV showing the destruction the President has unleashed and is horrified by it. The last scene is PC Principal and Strong Woman gazing into each other's eyes, their hands no longer on the doorknob.]
End of SUPER HARD PCness

[South Park, a rainy night. A girl screams]
CRYSTAL
Mommy! Momm-mmy! [her bedroom door opens and her parents walk in. Her dad flicks on the lights] He's gonna get me!
BOB WHITE
Honey, honey, who's gonna get you?
CRYSTAL
The President! I saw him! He's gonna get me!
BOB WHITE
Crystal, the President isn't going to get you.
CRYSTAL
But I saw him!
BOB WHITE
[to his wife] See what I told you? It's that liberal school she's going to, filling her head with all kinds of garbage! Sweetie, the President is doing the best job he can. Your liberal school is just trying to convince you he's dangerous.
CRYSTAL
But Daddy, he's getting-
BOB WHITE
Uh uh, no buts! The President is in the White House, not here trying to get you. Okay?
CRYSTAL
Oh-kaaay?
BOB WHITE
All right. [he and Mom walk out the door, and he tells Mom] We're having a talk with that school in the morning! [turns to Crystal] Good night, honey. [turns off the lights, and the couple goes to their room. Thunder and lightning get Crystal out of bed and she goes to her window. She sees a shadow on the walkway outside. When lightning flashes, she sees it's indeed the President.]
GARRISON
Hey! How are my approval ratings?! [Crystal runs back to bed]
[Kyle's room, 8:57 p.m. He's moping at the foot of his bed.]

And the latest reports are now saying that over a million Canadians were killed in the nuclear blast. The bomb dropped by the U.S. President took out the entire city of Toronto, and fallout is expected to kill thousands more in the coming days. [A moment of silence follows, and Ike appears at Kyle's door.]
KYLE
Ike... Ike, I'm sorry that I caused a nuclear bomb to be dropped on Canada. I was just- you know, I was just trying to get shows that were toxic taken down. You know, those shows can be really harmful.
IKE
Ohhh, stop being a victim! Jesus Christ! [turns left and walks away. Kyle is left with his jaw dropped, then goes back to moping]
[South Park, Elementary, day. It's raining outside. The Principal's office. A father is expressing his concerns]
BOB WHITE
What I wanna know is, what gives you the right to preach your political views to my children?! Our daughter woke up with nightmares that the President was going to get her! Just because two liberals happen to be principal and vice principal doesn't mean you can brainwash my kids!
PC PRINCIPAL
Uh, we sort of have some bigger problems right now, Mr. Uh...
BOB WHITE
It's White. Bob White. You probably never even heard of our family, huh? Well, the Whites have been here since the beginning! Not that it matters, 'cause no one cares about the Whites. Sure, everyone else has problems, but does anyone ask the Whites how they're doing?!
STRONG WOMAN
Mr. White, we assure you that we run this school in a very [glances at PC Principal] professional manner and don't let [glances again] personal emotions get in the way. [glances again. He looks back, and their eyes are locked]
BOB WHITE
Oh, sure you don't! You know how hard I had to fight to even get this meeting with you?! "Oh, who wants to talk to the administration? Oh, it's just the Whites? Oh, who cares about the Whites? They're fine!" Well, we've just about had with you, you understand? [a song plays that drowns out Mr. White's rant: Barbara Mandrell - "(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want To Be Right"] And damn it, we won't be ignored!
MRS.WHITE
[hearing the song somehow] I'm sorry, is anyone else hearing "(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want To Be Right" very very quietly?
STRONG WOMAN
Uh, no. Mr. and Mrs. White, we promise that we will not let anything happen that might bring the integrity of this school into question.
BOB WHITE
Guess that's all the Whites can hope for these days.
[South Park, night. Someone is riding a bike in the rain. It's Tweek. He notices something off to his left - a red balloon - on which is written "Make America Great Again." The balloon pops, revealing President Garrison]
GARRISON
Hey!
TWEEK
Aaaagh!
GARRISON
How are my approval ratings?
TWEEK
It's the President! Gaaahhh! [rides away quickly]
GARRISON
Wait, come back! What's wrong?
[Sepcial Report, with Bill Keegan]
BILL KEEGAN
Still no word from the President, as his Splatty Tomato approval rating drops to an unprecedented 3%. This puts the President four points below Nut Job 2: Nutty By Nature. Meanwhile, the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau called upon Canadians to stand strong.
JUSTIN TRUDEAU
[stands behind a tattered podium with a Canadian flag on it.] Make no mistake, America! If you do not hand over your President, there will be war the likes of which you have never seen! Canadians will rise together! I call on all Canadians here and abroad to stand with their country! The U.S. President must answer for his crime, and only Canada can bring him to justice! [Trudeau himself was bombed, as he is charred and tattered as well. Ike, having seen the broadcast, gets angry and walks off]
[A bus bench, day. Craig and Tweek sit on it, Tweek shivering from his encounter with the President. Tweek grumbles.]
CRAIG
[pats him on the shoulder] There there, Tweek. Everything is going to be okay.
TWEEK
I saw what I saw, Craig! You have to believe me!
KYLE
[Him and Stan walk up with their bikes] What's going on?
CRAIG
Tweek's having a panic attack.
TWEEK
It was real! He tried to get me!
KYLE
Who did?
TWEEK
The President! [Stan looks away, as if Tweek's statement hit close to home]
CRAIG
It's just your imagination, Tweek.
STAN
It's not his imagination. I saw him too.
KYLE
You saw the President?
STAN
Out by the quarry. But I didn't believe it. I said, "How could this be..."
HEIDI
..."The President?" [Her and Cartman walk up with their bikes] I saw him too. He had a blue suit and an orange face. He kept asking me "How are my ap..."
TOLKIEN
"...How are my approval ratings?" [walks up with his bike] I saw him too.
STAN
Dude, isn't this all really familiar? I saw something just like this on that show called Stranger...
RANDY
[rides up on his bike] ...Stranger Things. Stranger Things is the show. I saw it too.
CRAIG
But wait, isn't Stranger Things just like that movie-?
CARTMAN
Just like that movie It.
RANDY
You saw It too?
CARTMAN
Yeah, I saw It in the theater.
TOLKIEN
I saw Stranger Things AND It.
RANDY
Jesus. I don't think anyone's imagining anything. I think the President IS here. You kids get inside somewhere. I have to warn the town! [gets on his bike and rides off, only to fall on his face a few seconds later.] Aw!
[Town meeting, night. A crowd has gathered inside, and all the townsfolk are talking]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
All right, people. People, please! We need everyone to try and stay calm.
TOWNSMAN 1
How can we stay calm while the President's out there scaring our children?!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Look, we all want the President out of here. It's just a matter of how we do it. I know you all want to get rid of him.
BOB WHITE
That's not true! The Whites still support the President
RANDY
Oh, for fuck's sake, White, he's running around eating our pets and terrorizing our kids!
BOB WHITE
You think Hillary would have been any better?!
TOWNSFOLK
Aw! Come on! Sit down, Bob!
BOB WHITE
[Sits down] I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin'
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Listen, everyone. I have a team right now that's trying to locate the President, and I'd like you to hear from Officer Bright, who's leading the search. [the officer adjusts his pants and walks up to the podium]
OFFICER BRIGHT
Hey folks, we know you're all uh concerned, but I wanna assure you that we're doing everything we can to track the President down and have him safely removed. Since the President was given a Splatty Tomato he's become very desperate and very dangerous. If you see the President, do not approach him. Do not try to reason with him. Most importantly, remember that this is the President, so you cannot shoot him. All right? You can't even talk about shooting him. Don't even... do any coy, satirical takes on shooting him. [the room stays silent] Okay, good. What we're trying to do here is just get the President to go away. We're gonna be handing out padlocks like this one [lifts one up for display] so everyone can lock up their garbage. If we don't feed the President, hopefully he'll just move on. Are there any questions?
TOWNSMAN 2
Can we talk about a friend shooting him if it's in sort of a sarcastic way?
OFFICER BRIGHT
No, no, no. It's just best to avoid that kind of talk altogether. Remember, they can do to you what they did to Kathy Griffin.
RANDY
Make her not funny for thirty years?
OFFICER BRIGHT
That's right, so best thing is just lock up your garbage and see if we can get the President to... go away.
[South Park, night. An officer is tacking posters of missing Ike onto community boards throughout town. Stan, Cartman, Heidi, Craig, and Tweek watch as the officer finishes his work on one particular board and moves on]
STAN
Jesus. Now kids are going missing.
TWEEK
We're all going to be missing soon! Nyaaarg!
STAN
[notices Kyle across the street walking by] Kyle! [the kids walk up to him]
KYLE
It's my fault. Ike went to go take matters into his own hands. I have to find him.
CRAIG
We'll help you.
STAN
We'll all help you.
CARTMAN
Guys this could be very dangerous.
HEIDI
You're not going. You promised that tonight, we would have a date night.
CARTMAN
Darling this is a little more pressing than date night.
HEIDI
Oh great. So Kyle's stupid brother goes missing, and I get fucked. How come I'm always the one getting shit on around here?
KYLE
I don't need anyone to go with me.
HEIDI
Oh what's the matter, Kyle? Don't want me around because you had the hots for me and I shut you down?
KYLE
I would never have the hots for the person you are now.
STAN
Come on you guys. Look, we all know what we're supposed to do now We all saw "It" and "Stranger Things". We need to get our backpacks and go out to the woods and save the town from evil to some kick-ass '80s' music!
[Meanwhile at De Faggoncini Italian, Butters, the Vice Principal and PC Principal walk trhough the door. Butters wears a message on his shirt saying 'Student of the Day'.]
WAITER
Hello, joining us for lunch today?
PC PRINCIPAL
Uh, yes. We are here with our student of the day to reward him lunch with the principal and vice principal.
STRONG WOMAN
We have a reservation.
WAITER
Okay, last name?
STRONG WOMAN
Woman.
WAITER
First name?
STRONG WOMAN
[Takes a deep breath] Strong.
WAITER
Oh, yes, Strong Woman, here we are. We have a nice booth set up for you.
STRONG WOMAN
We can't keep doing this. People are gonna see through it.
PC PRINCIPAL
Is it my fault that I found the most amazing, perfect, beautiful woman...at work?
STRONG WOMAN
Nobody will understand.
PC PRINCIPAL
Maybe they will. We're co-worker who are in love. You really think that's going to bother people?
BUTTERS
Well, should we order now?
[Bob White comes out of his house with some food. He then starts whistling. He then proceeds to put the food on the floor but is stopped.]
RANDY
What are you doing, Bob?
BOB WHITE
Aah!
RANDY
[Randy is joined by Steven, Linda, Sharon and Roger] Have you been putting food out for the president?
BOB WHITE
No, I was just, uh, taking these sandwiches to the trash.
RANDY
We all agreed not to feed him so he'd go away.
BOB WHITE
We didn't all agree! You all agreed! Nobody asked the Whites how they felt! Nobody cares what the Whites have to say!
RANDY
Bob, come on. You have to know it's not safe to have him here.
BOB WHITE
In 2003, Hillary Clinton admitted to taking funds for her foundation from foreign diplomats!
RANDY
What's that got to do with anything, Bob? Come on.
BOB WHITE
It's fucking true!
RANDY
Bob, if Canada finds out the president is hiding here, they are going to nuke us. He needs to go.
BOB WHITE
Hillary wouldn't have been any better.
RANDY
Give me the finger sandwiches.
BOB WHITE
Fine! Go ahead and take the White's sandwiches! They've taken everything else!
[As the boys begin their journey "The Chicago Bears' The Super Bowl Shuffle" plays.]
STAN
Due, this is '80's' music?
CRAIG
Yeah. It's Pandora. '80s' channel.
STAN
Well, just skip to the next song, man. We're trying to get psyched to destroy evil. We need better '80s' music than that.
[As the boys continue, "Gloria" plays. Heidi stops as the boys go over a bridge.]
CARTMAN
Heidi? Honey, what are you doing?
HEIDI
This is the place... This is the place where I ended it all, remember? This is where I threw my phone of the bridge and quit Twitter for good. [The camera pans to the left to show Heidi's ghost] I was so different then... so naive and hopeful. [The ghost throws the phone in the river after tweeting her final goodbye]
CARTMAN
Yes honey, now can we get going, please?
HEIDI
I'm sorry! I'm trying to have a moment here! This is where our whole relationship started asshole!
CARTMAN
Yes, it's very touching, sweetheart. I love you so much. [Quietly] I'm sorry about this, you guys.
HEIDI
[The ghost turns to face herself] I remember feeling like I had nobody. Skinny bitch.
KYLE
We need to keep going guys.
[Over at the Mayor's office.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Don't tell me you haven't gotten the President out of here.
OFFICER BRIGHT
We haven't gotten the president out of here. And there's some worse news. A bunch of kids have gone missing.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
What?
OFFICER BRIGHT
I think we have to assume that the President has... eaten them. [Mrs Tweak starts crying]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Why are you here talking to me instead of trying to find the President?
OFFICER BRIGHT
Don't worry, we're close. He's out in the woods somewhere. And we've set up a fox trap.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
A fox trap?
[The president is watching a mouse, grabs it and eats it. He then sees Fox News with a man sitting waiting.]
GARRISON
Oh, Fox News... They'll listen to me. They'll get my side of the story right!
BOB WHITE
[He whistles the bird call of the bobwhite quail to get Garrison's attention] It's a trap!
GARRISON
What?
BOB WHITE
It's a Fox trap, Mr. President!
GARRISON
Oh, thank God for the Whites.
[The boys venture on as "Hold On to the Nights" plays.]
KYLE
Ike! Ike?
STAN
Dude, come on! This is not kick-ass '80s' music!
CRAIG
"Hold On to the Nights" Richard Marx, 1988.
TWEEK
Do we really need music?
STAN
Yeah! Craig just has the wrong stuff. Forget your pandora. I'm doing Spotify. '80s' music. 'Kay. There. ["Pac-Man Fever" plays]
CRAIG
Oh, yeah. That's better.
KYLE
Can we go please?!
[The boys come up to the log cabin.]
KYLE
Here it is. [Opens the door] Ike?
HEIDI
Wait a minute... Isn't this the place you brought me before? The place you said your friends smashed your phone and computer...? I remember I felt so bad for you. We used to sit in the part and talk for hours. How come we never do that anymore?
CARTMAN
Oh, fuck. Here we go.
HEIDI
Here we go what?! You used to be so nice to me.
CARTMAN
You used to be nice to me!
HEIDI
I tried! But then you started rolling your eyes every time I tried to talk to you!
CARTMAN
Ughhhh...
KYLE
He's not here either.
CRAIG
Dude, maybe your brother didn't even go looking for the President.
KYLE
You don't understand Canadians. They're fiercely loyal to their country. When Canada is attacked, they all join in the fight.
[Ike is seen riding a dog. He uses a pair of binoculars to look around. He then picks some poo up, breaks it in half and sniffs it, he then proceeds to get back on his dog.]
[Randy and a few other parents are looking around in the woods. He uses a flashlight.]
JIMBO
Randy! Randy!
RANDY
What?
JIMBO
They got him! They found the President!
OFFICER BRIGHT
We found his hideout. There. Someone's gotta go flush him out. I'll be ready to trap him.
RANDY
I'll do it.
OFFICER BRIGHT
Hey, hey! Just remember he's been eating animals and living like a monster. Just... prepare yourself for what you're about to see.
[Randy approaches the tent and looks inside to see Strong Woman and PC Principal naked.]
STRONG WOMAN
Oh my God!
RANDY
What the... Principal and Vice Principal...?
STRONG WOMAN
I told you we couldn't hide.
RANDY
But... But you two work togeth... You two work togeth... [Vomits]
OFFICER BRIGHT
Hey, what the hell's going on?!
LINDA BLACK
Who's together?
RANDY
The Principal and the Vice Principal!
STEVEN
They can't be together! They're co-workers!
[PC Principal and Strong Woman exit the tent. Steven vomits.]
OFFIER BRIGHT
Wait, wait. You mean he's actually her superior and they were in there... [Gags, then vomits]
BOB WHITE
Who would want to put their penis in a co-worker?! [Gags then vomits. Everyone else starts doing the same]
[The boys proceed on while Queen of Hearts plays.]
KYLE
Oh, my God! Look! These are Ike's toy binoculars! He was here! Ike!
HEIDI
I remember this place too... This is where you brought me on Halloween. Remember?
CARTMAN
[Sarcastically] Yes, darling, wasn't it romantic
HEIDI
No! It wasn't romantic. There was a witch and you had me dress up like Gretel and... [gasps] you were trying to get me killed!
CARTMAN
Sweetheart, you made me late to the pumpkin patch, remember? I was hurt.
HEIDI
You were hurt! You Were the victim.
CARTMAN
I'm glad you understand.
HEIDI
[Heidi's ghost appears] Who turned you into this, Heidi? Shut up! Skinny-ass bitch! You don't know anything!
CARTMAN
Heidi, I think spooky walk in the woods is making you lost it a little bit.
STAN
Guys!
GARRISON
I'm seriously dehydrated and starving. I'm pretty sick of this shit, so you better... Aah!
[Mr Garrison gets caught in a trap Ike set up. Meanwhile at the Community Center.]
MR. TURNER
Have we already done a search of this area? Maybe she went there with her boyfriend!
MRS. TURNER
She would have called by now.
LAURA
I just talked to the McCormicks. They haven't seen Tweek or Craig since yesterday.
[Just then, Jimbo, Steven, Linda, Officer Bright, Roger, Mrs Tweak along with a few other parents walk through the door.]
SHARON
Randy! Did you find anything?
RANDY
[He takes off his hood] Sharon... I... I...
SHARON
What is it? What did you find?
RANDY
The... There's... Ugh...
SHARON
Tell me! You have to tell me! [Officer Bright takes off his hat] Oh, God! What did you see?!
RANDY
You don't want to know.
SHARON
You have to tell me! I can take it! Did you find our son's arm? Did you find him torn apart? What?!
RANDY
The Principal and Vice Principal are, like... together. [Sharon vomits right onto Randy's face.] Aw!
[Ike plays a high pitched horn as he arrives back in South Park. Everyone comes out of the Community Center. He has Garrison tied up behind and gagged.]
OFFICER BRIGHT
It's the President! [People begin to cheer]
SHEILA
Ike! Kyle!
SHARON
Stan, you're okay!
STAN
Yeah, we're okay!
OFFICER BRIGHT
We got him. We got the son of a bitch. [Bob White walks over and grabs Officer Bright's gun]
BOB WHITE
Get back! Everyone back! Do it now! Get over here, family!
RANDY
Bob, for the love of Pete, our country is about to go to war!
BOB WHITE
You wanna know where there's a war?! There's a war on Christmas! Nobody cares about that! 'Cos guess who loves Christmas? The Whites! At least this man's trying to save Christmas!
GARRISON
[Muffled] That's true!
RANDY
He's not saving Christmas, Bob. He's running around scaring your kids and shitting in the woods.
BOB WHITE
[Sighs, sobs]
RANDY
Come on, Bob. What's best for your daughter? I mean, really?
HEIDI
[Heidi grabs White's gun] You piece of shit! This was all your fault! [She points the gun at Cartman] You controlled me and manipulated me and turned me into this!
CARTMAN
Baby, put down the gun, sweetheart, okay?
HEIDI
I used to be kind. I used to be caring. But then you... you... No. Not you. Me. I did this. I let being a victim become a way of life. If you always make yourself the victim, you can justify being awful. Eric... I'm sorry. I'm breaking up with you.
CARTMAN
Honey, don't be ridiculous.
HEIDI
I've been ridiculous. I have to learn to stop feeling sorry for myself.
CARTMAN
Heidi, you are not breaking up with me.
HEIDI
Yes, I am. It's over.
CARTMAN
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, sweetheart! [He grabs the gun and points it at himself] Step back! I'll do it I swear to God!
HEIDI
It's not gonna work this time, Eric.
CARTMAN
You break up with me, I will kill myself! The choice is yours, Heidi! Come on everybody! "Eric, we don't want you to die."
HEIDI
I'm sorry. You can be the victim. I can't.
CARTMAN
Heidi! Heidi, I'm gonna do it! Here we go! Heidi? Are you seriously...
[A scream is heard. Everyone moves to where Garrison was.]
OFFICER BRIGHT
He broke free!
JIMBO
The President is on the loose again.
OFFICER BRIGHT
He'll be even more desperate now. It's going to get worse.
STAN
We can't destroy him, can we?
RANDY
I don't know. I guess... It's up to the Whites.
End of Splatty Tomato
