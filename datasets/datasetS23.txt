synopsis:In the pilot episode of the new hit series, Tegridy Farms, Randy battles home-grown weed and comes to terms with the fact that he might be a towel. Meanwhile, Kyle goes to camp.

script:Mexican Joker

[The South Park theme song is replaced by one for the new series, Tegridy Farms, starring Randy Marsh:
Goin' down to Tegridy Farms, gonna have myself a time. Friendly faces everywhere, humble folks without temptation, Goin' down to Tegridy Farms, gonna leave my woes behind. There's ample parking day or night, people spouting, 'Howdy, neighbor!' I'm headin' on up to Tegridy Farms, gonna see if I can't unwind… Towelie: I got ...some weed and I don't know what's goin' on Come on down to Tegridy Farms and meet some friends of mine…
As the song plays, this happens: a flyover shot of the valley Tegridy Farms is in. A jar of Tegridy Weed floats by. Randy is shown driving his tractor. The camera zooms on on a house on which roof "Tegridy Farms" is painted. Shelley and Stan are reaping weed as Randy looks on, toking. Towelie enters the house. Randy shows off his greenhouse. Sharon vacuums hanging harvested weed. Randy walks out of the barn covered in weed. Randy and Towelie each smoke a joint on the couch. Randy tries baking brownies and burns them. Smoke comes out of the oven while he holds a tray of them. Randy poses with the family and with Towelie as the song ends. Only Randy and Towelie smile.]
[The camera pans up from the weed patch and aims at the house. Bunches of weed hang from clotheslines as a fan softly dries them]
RANDY
[voice-over] Some people like their weed made the old-fashioned way. [several laborers are in the field harvesting weed] Here at Tegridy, we believe weed is about people. [Randy is shown leading a group of people on a tour of his operation.] Over the past few months, Tegridy has expanded from the simple farmhouse you see behind me to actually owning the entire 420 Valley. And I think you'll see on this tour that even though our business has grown, we just kept our weed simple. [Randy continues the tour on a tram] It takes over a thousand plants to make just one box of Tegridy Weed. [points to his left] There's Juan Carlos over there; he's one of our newest employees. [calls out to him] 'Mornin' Juan Carlos! [Juan Carlos looks up and meekly waves back. Passengers take pictures of him. The next scene has Randy and the group on a moving sidewalk] What happens when you combine science... with Tegridy? A lot of magic. Here you can see our latest growing methods along with our science center. [Towelie is shown sampling the weed. Next stop, the tasting room. Randy and the group ride up in a small riverboat, the S.S. Tegridy.] And of course, it wouldn't be Colorado weed without our Rocky Mountain High tasting room. Feel free to come back here later and try all our... Tegridy products. [the tour ends, and Randy leads the group out] Well, folks, we hope you enjoyed your tour. There's a lot to buy here in the gift shop and, please, do remember, your tour guides work on tips. Let's give me a big hand. [the grop claps]
[Tegridy Farms house, living room. Stan tallies the day's receipts on the laptop and Cartman chills on the sofa.]
CARTMAN
This sucks balls. Ever since you guys moved, everything just keeps changing. I mean, how are all us kids supposed to have any hope anymore? All I think about is all the problems our generation is inheriting: climate change, overfishing, Kyle. I mean, how are we supposed to get happy about anything? [Randy comes in] Hey there, Stan. You input all the weed orders?
STAN
Yeah, it's all right here.
RANDY
Ah, hahah-uhl, oh. [scratches the back of his neck] Looks like our orders are actually... down. You sure you did that right?
STAN
Yeah, I went through it twice. People aren't ordering as much as last month.
RANDY
Not ordering as much? Why... what the hell is going on?
[South Park, day. Randy drives up to the Stotch house, goes to the front door and rings the bell. Stephen answers]
STEPHEN
Oh, hey, Randy.
RANDY
[with a box of Tegridy Weed, tips his hat to him] Howdy, Stephen. How've you been gettin' on?
STEPHEN
Good. How's life in the Valley been treatin' ya?
RANDY
Oh, it's early mornin's and lots of hard work, but, gotta do what's best for my young 'uns. I've noticed you haven't supplied up in a while, Stephen, so I thought I'd deliver your weed to you personally.
STEPHEN
Oh... yeah, no [scratches the back of his neck], I... actually... hadn't ordered any in a while.
RANDY
Why not? You're not gettin' all sober on us, are ya?
STEPHEN
No. Well... here, let me show you. [takes Randy to the back yard shows him what he's been up to] What do you think? [before them is Stephen's starter weed garden] I started growing my own plants a couple of weeks ago. I totally get it. It's a really fun hobby. That's Diego, my gardener.
RANDY
Ohhh he, haha, hey... fuck you.
STEPHEN
What?
RANDY
My weed not good enough for ya? Something wrong with Tegridy?
STEPHEN
No, I just started kinda getting into it. I just enjoy the whole-
RANDY
You're stealing my idea Stephen!
STEPHEN
Come on, growing marijuana is not your idea.
RANDY
Yeah-huh! While you assholes were all screwing around, I went out and made a living! When you grow your own pot, you're taking weed out of my children's mouths!
MR. MACKEY
[enters the back yard through the sliding door] Oh hey, guys. Sorry, the front door was open, so I just walked on in. Seein' if I could still get those seeds from ya, Stephen?
RANDY
[glares at Stephen] What seeds?!
MR. MACKEY
Oh, I was gonna try my hand at growin' some weed and Stephen said he'd give me some seeds to get started.
RANDY
[sticks up both middle fingers to Stephen and Mr. Mackey] FUUUCK YOU GUYS! [turns to Stephen] I'll get you for this, Stephen! You mess with my Tegridy, and I'm gonna mess with you! [leaves the yard. Moments later, he returns for the weed he was going to leave to Stephen, looks at Mr. Mackey, and walks out]
[Kum & Go liquor store. A depressed Cartman walks up to a soda fountain with a Mega Gulp cup and serves himself a bunch of sodas, then goes to the coffee machine and serves himself some decaf coffee in the same cup. He then walks up to the counter and pays up]
CLERK 1
You alright there, partner?
CARTMAN
Kids are being handed a world that's broken and sick. We aren't the ones who messed this planet up, but we're the ones who will pay the price.
CLERK 1
Okay, you have a nice day. [Cartman takes his change and receipt, and walks out.]
[Outide the liquor store. As Cartman leaves the store, a Department of Homeland Security car zooms by, followed by a black van. Cartman just looks on and takes a sip of his soda.]
[The Stotch house. ICE agents are at the house hauling Diego out. Stephen chases after them.]
DIEGO
¡Por favor no! ¡Por favor! Nomás quiero trabajar! ["Please no! please! I just want to work!"]
STEPHEN
This is inhumane! Diego is my gardener!
CARTMAN
[walks up and looks at an agent while taking a sip of his drink] What's going on?
AGENT 1
This is an ICE raid, son. You need to keep back.
AGENT 2
Put him in my car. [a third agent takes Diego away]
CARTMAN
What did that guy do?
AGENT 1
Somebody called in an anonymous tip that he might be here illegally.
ESPOSA
¡No! ¡No te lo puedes llevar! ¡Es mi esposo! ¡Mi esposo! ["No! You can't take him away! He's my husband! My husband!"] [A female agent in a hoodie takes her away]
GIRL
Papa! Papa, no! Papa!
AGENT 3
Wife goes in the van, kids can go with Donovan. [A male agent grabs the kids and carries them offscreen]
STEPHEN
Who called you people?! It was Randy Marsh, wasn't it?!
AGENT 1
We're just doin' our job, sir. If the family checks out, we'll release them from their detention centers.
CARTMAN
Detention centers? [perks up] Well, this is nice! When did we start doing this?
AGENT 4
[the female agent] Kids go to LS22.
CARTMAN
So anyone can make an anonymous tip and you can round up families and send them away? Nobody told me about this! I thought everything sucked now! Do you have a card?
[The Broflovski house, day. Ike is playing with blocks on the floor. Kyle is watching TV and eating cereal on the sofa as the phone rings. He picks up after seeing who's calling]
KYLE
What do you want?
[Cartman residence, Eric's bedroom. Cartman is reclining back with his legs up on his desk, looking at his nails while acting rather smug.]
CARTMAN
Do you remember last week you called me a butthole in front of Suzie Tobler?
KYLE
Yeah, 'cause you were gonna snap her bra.
CARTMAN
I want you to apologize for every time you've been a dick to me, Kyle.
KYLE
Fuck you.
CARTMAN
Oh! Are you sure you don't want to take that back? Uh-okay Kyle. Just remember, I gave you a chance. [the doorbell rings, and Ike goes to the door]
KYLE
Are you done now? Can I hang up? [as Ike opens the door, ICE agents burst in and fan out]
AGENT 2
220. We've breached the front door.
KYLE
Hello?
IKE
Mommy! Mommy!
GERALD
[coming in from the kitchen] Excuse me, what is going on? [more agents come in through the back door behind him. The female puts Gerald against a wall and frisks him.]
AGENT 5
640. On the first floor. [Agent 3 brings Sheila down the stairs]
SHEILA
Who are you people?
AGENT 3
We're ICE, ma'am.
GERALD
We're American citizens!
AGENT 5
Just doin' our job, sir. If you check out, you'll be released from the detention centers.
GERALD
Get the fuck out of my house! [the agents haul the Broflovskis out the door.]
KYLE
Mom! Dad!
GERALD
This is ridiculous! You can't take our children away from us!
CARTMAN
[looking on through binoculars from his bedroom window and chuckles while snacking on chips.] That's so sweet.
AGENT 2
You guys take the parents, we'll take the kids. [Ike runs to Sheila and holds on to her]
AGENT 1
[grabs ahold of him] Come on, you! [grunts as he struggles to pull Ike off Sheila]
SHEILA
NO! You will not take my children from me!
CARTMAN
Ha ha. No way. [grabs a handful of chips and eats them]
GERALD
I-I'm telling you, I just don't know where our passports are!
AGENT 3
Then we have to detain you. If you're legal, you can sort it all out on Monday.
SHEILA
Monday?! [agent 2 pulls Ike off Sheila. Kyle is pushed into the back of a black sedan. He looks up from the backseat and sees Cartman smiling and waving to him.]
KYLE
Goddamit, Cartman!
SHEILA
Ike! [to the agents] YOU CAN'T DO THIS! [Ike is put in the back of agent 2's car. The agents pull away from the house in their cruisers]
[City Hall, day. Stan speaks to the city council. Randy and Towelie sit in the otherwise empty audience section, and Randy interjects from time to time.]
STAN
[reading from 3x5 index cards] What happened to our country? People are being wronged by a broken system, and we must say "NO MORE." No more homegrown marijuana.
RANDY
[voicing several fake witnesses] Yeah, that's right! Yeah, that's right. Me too. Yeah, that's right!
STAN
As the son of a proud American farmer, I am concerned about what homegrown can lead to. People can grow weed wrong and poison themselves. What?
RANDY
Yeah, that's right. Yeah! Come on!
STAN
Unscrupulous growers could use cheap irrigation and drown babies. Oh, come on.
RANDY
That's right. Drown babies, yeah. Drown babies, that's right. Drown babies.
STAN
The fact is simple. Marijuana must be grown with Tegridy.
RANDY
Tegridy.
STAN
[mimicking Randy] Tegridy.
[South Park, on the drive home. Randy, Stan, and Towelie are quiet]
RANDY
[Angrily takes a hit from his joint] Stupid government! How can they sit there and look a child in the face and it's fine for people to grow their own weed?!
TOWELIE
[starts to roll a joint] Oh, why does it matter?
RANDY
Why does it? Ugh! Am I the only person here who understands what this will do to us?!
STAN
Yeah, but Dad, you're gonna piss off everybody in South Park.
RANDY
You know what? Fuck South Park!
TOWELIE
Fuck South Park?
RANDY
Yeah, I'm sick it! I'm just- I'm done! I don't give two shits about South Park! All that matters is Tegridy Farms now!
TOWELIE
... I don't know if you wanna say "Fuck South Park."
[A detention center in Texas, day. An ICE bus pulls up and drops off its group of kids. Kyle is among them]
JEFF
Good day, children. My name is Jeff.
DAVID
Buenos días, niños. Me llamo Jefe. ["Good morning, kids. My name is Heff-e"]
JEFF
We know you've been separated from your families.
DAVID
Tu familia no está aquí, Es triste. Tu kri. Tu kri. ["Your family is not here. So sad. You cry. You cry."]
JEFF
But we want you to get a little excited about the fun we have in store for you.
DAVID
Aquí es mervilosa! Divértida! ["It's marvelous here! Fun!"] [the two agents lead the kids inside]
[The detention center, inside]
JEFF
Everyone, please take your own piece of aluminum foil.
DAVID
Papél de aluminió, por favor. ["Please take a sheet of aluminium"] [each kid takes an aluminum sheet and goes into a large space to be used for sleeping]
RODGERS
All new kids, el nombre ["Name"]. Line up and announce when your name is read. Martinez!
MARTINEZ
Aquí. ["Here"]
RODGERS
Aguilar?
AGUILAR
Aquí. ["Here"]
RODGERS
Broflovski?
KYLE
Here! [the agent is shocked and looks around, then looks at David, approaching]
DAVID
Broflovski - is, is that an El Salvadorean name?
KYLE
No, I'm Jewish. [Jeff and the other two agents are alarmed.]
JEFF
What?! How did a Jew get in here?
KYLE
I'm just here because some fat intolerant asshole didn't want me around!
BOY
Yeah, that's why I'm here too.
GIRL
Yeah, me too.
JEFF
Oh boy, we've gotta get this kid out of here. [voice softens to a whisper] People might think we're racist.
[The Marsh house, day. A car pulls up and two corporate bigwigs step out of it and walk to the front door. Randy comes out to greet his guests.]
RANDY
Ah, sorry, tours at 11 and 2, and 4:20.
BIGWIG 1
Oh, we're not here for a tour, we represent a billion-dollar marijuana company.
RANDY
Ohh, I told you rich, big-city folk before: You can't buy Tegridy!
BIGWIG 1
You seem to be fighting the same fight we are. We just wanna help you. [pulls out a joint and lights it up with a lighter, then takes a toke before handing it to Randy.] Ever heard of Med Men?
RANDY
Yeah, I think so. [takes a toke and hands it back] What do you want with me?
BIGWIG 1
Well, we have a common problem. [takes a toke] Homegrown weed.
BIGWIG 2
[takes the joint from his partner] We're just worried about safety, you know? [takes a toke] Babies drowning in irrigation and such.
RANDY
[takes the joint from Bigwig 2] Yeah, I hate watching babies drown. [takes a toke] Seems like a waste of a good baby. [hands the joint to Bigwig 1]
BIGWIG 1
We're glad you agree. [takes a toke] Now what-? [Randy tokes several times]
RANDY
So you guys wanna team up and piggyback on the goodwill of the legalization movement for some good old-fashioned crony capitalism? I'm totally in. [exhales and a bunch of smoke drifts out]
[Detention center, Texas, day. Jeff, Kyle, and another agent site in Jeff's office. Behind Kyle is a waiting room with a one-way window]
JEFF
Sorry for our little mistake. We're goin' to get you on your way home as soon as we can.
KYLE
What about all the other kids? When do they get to go home?
JEFF
Hey. When it's raining, you gotta roll up the windows. We understand these things are hard for your people.
KYLE
My people? Aren't you worried about what you're creating here?!
JEFF
What do you mean?
KYLE
You're pulling children away from their parents and isolating them behind bars.
JEFF
Yes.
KYLE
You're traumatizing them and teaching them to fear the U.S. government.
JEFF
Correct.
KYLE
Okay, let me try to put this in terms you people will understand. You know superhero movies, right?
DAVID
[gets excited and looks up from his phone] Yeah!
KYLE
Okay. You remember how they always create the villain? Some random person who, when they were a child, got taken from their parents and locked away? And the kid was just left to sit and plot revenge? What you're doing here is creating a Mexican Joker! [The agents get alarmed again] And what's a Mexican Joker gonna do? He's gonna grow up and have memories of being wronged by you, and he will grow and wait, and then finally [makes a fist with his right hand and pounds it into his left hand] fight back with a passion unlike anything you've ever seen!
JEFF
Which one of them do you think is Mexican Joker?
KYLE
No, it could be any of them! That's the point! You don't know which kid in there is gonna snap from being separated and locked down like this!
DAVID
But... Doesn't Mexican Joker understand that we're just doing our job and making America great?
KYLE
Mexican Joker doesn't care! When that kid grows up, all that will matter is getting back at all of you!
DAVID
Well, what would Mexican Joker-
JEFF
Hey David, can I talk to you alone, please. Excuse us, kid. [Jeff puts Kyle in a waiting room just outside the office. Jeff and David begin to argue, but the office is soundproof, so we hear nothing. The camera switches to inside the office] Now then, the most important thing is that we've got to keep this quiet! We can't let Mexican Joker know that we're onto him.
DAVID
I don't wanna be part of a bad guy flashback scene. Maybe we should get kids out of here.
JEFF
Now, listen: that's just what he wants us to do.
DAVID
What are you saying?
JEFF
Im saying, what if he's on Mexican Joker's side? [the both look at Kyle through the window]
[The Marsh living room, evening. Randy has taken to adding up the tally himself on the laptop. Towelie enters the room]
TOWELIE
[upset] Hey Randy, did you go make a deal with another weed company?
RANDY
Yes, Towelie. I'm working on a merger with Med Men.
TOWELIE
Med Men? But, those guys are posers.
RANDY
We have a deal in the works to help each other put a stop to home-growers once and for all.
TOWELIE
Jesus... You know, I knew a guy who thought weed should be for everybody. A guy who believed in integrity. I don't understand who you even are anymore.
RANDY
That's because I'm the president of the company, and YOU are a TOWEL!
TOWELIE
YOU're a towel!
RANDY
What is wrong with trying to protect our business? [Towelie walks towards the front door]
TOWELIE
[stops and turns around] Because weed isn't supposed to be some money-grubbin' business model! It's a gift from God! And not something to exploited by some stupid towel! [opens the door and steps out]
RANDY
I AM NOT A TOWEL!
TOWELIE
[turns around] Yeah. Yeah, sure thing, Randy. You are not a towel. [leaves, and Randy sighs with a mix of relief and anger]
[The Texas detention center, day. Jeff puts on a puppet show with David on the bullhorn and another agent at the spinet piano. Jeff provides the voices.]
PRINCESS STAR
My name is Princess Star, for I shine like all the stars in the night sky.
JEFF
Kids, let's all say hi to Princess Star!
DAVID
Hi, Princess Star.
MEXICAN JOKER
Ha ha ha haa! It's me, Mexican Jokerrrrr!
JEFF
Oh no! Everyone boo Mexican Joker, kids! Boooo!
DAVID
Boooo!
MEXICAN JOKER
I'm filled with anger and rage for what happened to me as a child! So now I will kill and rape you all!
PRINCESS STAR
But Mexican Joker, you forget the magic word: Forgiveness. [a ding prompts the screen behind Jeff to come on and show "FORGIVENESS/EL PARDON"]
MEXICAN JOKER
I don't care about forgiveness!
PRINCESS STAR
But you are a migrant from another country. We had to protect our borders and secure our jobs.
MEXICAN JOKER
I don't care! I'm going to rape you now! [Jeff has Mexican Joker rape Princess Star]
PRINCESS STAR
Oh no, no, what about forgiveness?
MEXICAN JOKER
No forgiveness! [the kids' jaws drop as they see this simulated rape]
JEFF
Boo! That's enough, Mexican Joker! Your rage and your anger have made you a bad person in the eyes of Christ. I know your life was hard as a kid, but everyone has hard times. [a bell rings and the show stops]
AGENT 6
Another busload comin' in.
JEFF
[weary] Another busload? Oh, criminy!
[Texas detention center, outside. The ICE bus pulls up again and drops off its load of kids. This time, Cartman is among the kids. Kyle goes to the window to see the new kids.]
JEFF
Welcome, children. My name is Jeff.
DAVID
Hola niños, me llamo Jefe... ["Hello, kids. My name is Heff-e..."] [the kids are processed as before, but don't receive aluminum blankets. They go to the sleeping area. Cartman walks up to Kyle, who glares at him]
CARTMAN
Oh, hey Kyle.
KYLE
What the fuck are you doing here?!
CARTMAN
So weak. Jimmy pissed me off 'cause he told the teacher I was texting in class, so I told Jimmy I'd have him sent off to a migrant detention center. He didn't believe me, so I said "Oh, I already did it to Kyle." Stan heard that, so he got pissed off and had me sent off to a migrant detention center.
KYLE
I haven't seen my parents in *two weeks*! Nobody even knows where my little brother is!
CARTMAN
I know. I know it sucks. But we're stuck in here together. Come on, buys. All we have to do is try to make the most of it. [smiles, then sings while bouncing around]
It's a hard knock life for us.
It's a hard knock life for us.
[South Park, day. Randy wanders through Downtown and stops at CottonCraft Linen & Towels, where he stares at the window display of towels.]
CLERK 2
Hey, are you gonna buy a towel or just stare at them?
RANDY
I'm not a towel!
CLERK 2
Go on! Get out of here! [Randy turns and walks away. As he walks down the sidewalk, he starts to groan as memories of recent days come flooding into his mind, accompanies by a range of emotions. The imaginary heads of Mr. Mackey, Stephen and Jimbo start to float around Randy]
MR. MACKEY
Yeah, you know, I think I'll just grow my own weed.
STEPHEN
Oh yeah, I'm growin' my own weed.
JIMBO
I enjoy growin' my own weed now.
STEPHEN
I'll grow my own weed.
JIMBO
My own weed.
MR. MACKEY
My own weed. I'll grow my own weed.
JIMBO
I enjoy growin' my own weed.
STEPHEN
Hey, I think I'll just grow my own weed. [Randy finds himself inside CottonCraft and angrily stares at the towels on display again.]
CLERK 2
[throws him out] I said get out of here if you aren't buying towels! [Randy walks on getting filled with rage as he hears the voices again.]
STEPHEN
I'll grow my own weed.
JIMBO
My own weed.
STEPHEN
My own weed. I'll grow my own weed.
JIMBO
I'll grow my own weed.
STEPHEN
I'll grow my own weed.
RANDY
[falling into despair thinking of himself as a towel] Aaaaaaaaaaah! [roars as he falls onto his knees in the middle of the street] Ah. Augh! Aaaaawwww!!
[Texas detention center clinic. A boy is strapped down to a table and wearing an electrified headband. He has a gag in his mouth. An agent zaps electricity through the boy from the headband]
JEFF
Hey. Hey! What the hell are you guys doin'?!
DAVID
Oh, hey Jeff. Rodgers read an article about how electroshock therapy can help people who've gone through traumatic experiences. We figured some treatments could help Mexican Joker deal with his trauma.
JEFF
Are you guys completely stupid?! We can't perform shock therapy on every child that comes in here! Think of the budgetary restraints!
DAVID
To hell with the costs, Jeff! If Mexican Joker doesn't have flashbacks, then he doesn't grow up to be a monster!
JEFF
What if this IS the flashback?! We might be IN the flashback, Dave! Maybe you're shocking the child that grows up to be Mexican Joker! [Rodgers takes over and zaps the boy]
DAVID
[distraught] Oh God! I don't know which way is up anymore!
JEFF
We can't fight this guy alone, Dave. It's time to alert the military.
[Texas detention center clinic. The lights are out and most of the kids are asleep. Kyle and Cartman sleep back to back, but Cartman stands up and sings, and Kyle gets annoyed.]
CARTMAN
Don't it feel like the wind is always howlin'? Don't it seem like there's never any light? Santa never comes for me. Santa Claus no está aquí. ["Santa Claus is not here"] [Kyle takes his aluminum sheet, goes to a wall and wraps himself up in the sheet, then rests against that wall. Cartman follows him] Aw, come on, Kyle. I know it's no fun to be in here, but you can't think about yourself. Think about the greater good. [thinks a moment] Now, when you don't like people, you can have then taken from their families and put into camps. Why does that make you [gasps in realization] Ohhh my God. Ohhh Jesus, Kyle. I've totally forgotten you're a... Of course, you're extra sensitive to this stuff. Oh, dude, I'm so sorry. [Kyle takes his sheet and leaves the wall.] Oh, my God, Kyle. I didn't even make the connection, you know? I was just like, Oh, I'm gonna have Kyle thrown into a detention camp. That'll be sweet," and I didn't stop to think that... for you guys... it's not that sweet. Man, if I had just thought it through for like, two more minutes, I would have got you back some other way. I feel terrible, Kyle.
KYLE
Wait. I have an idea how to get everyone out of here. Get everyone's aluminum foil and some scissors.
CARTMAN
Why, Kyle? What are you gonna do with-
KYLE
Just do it before I kill you!
CARTMAN
Aluminum foil and some scissors. [walks off to collect them]
[A couple washing dishes in their own kitchen.]
HUSBAND
That was a great dinner, honey.
WIFE
What do you wanna do for dessert?
HUSBAND
Hey! How about I cut us down some of our homegrown weed and we get baked?
WIFE
I'm in. [the husband walks out to the backyard for some weed and hears some noise. In the shadows, Randy sneaks away]
HUSBAND
Is someone there? [no other sound is heard] Huh. [walks to his weed and pulls out a knife to cut some down]
WIFE
Jack? Everything alright?
JACK
Yeah. You want a normal size, or a big fatty? [the weed explodes and rips him to bits] Aa-
WIFE
JAACK! [a series of explosions follow throughout the neighborhood]
[Breaking News]
NEWS ANCHOR
A brutal act of terror in an American town. Tonight, innocent people were attacked at their homes, in their yards, and the FBI believes they know who is responsible. The probable suspect? [A portrait sketch of a Mexican male with a thin mustache, wearing a sombrero appears at the corner of the screen.] Mexican Joker. [shows a look of dread, as the sound of people screaming is heard] Uhuh. Yeah, that's right. Joining me now is Commander Miller of National Defense.
CMDR MILLER
We've only recently learned of Mexican Joker's existence.
NEWS ANCHOR
Waa huhaugh.
CMDR MILLER
He has no reason. He has no compassion.
NEWS ANCHOR
Aaagh.
CMDR MILLER
Mexican Joker simply wants to invoke fear.
NEWS ANCHOR
Oohh!
CMDR MILLER
We are advising people to stay inside!
NEWS ANCHOR
Uh, look. Captain, uh... Captain, what made Mexican Joker this way? Why is Mexican Joker so... filled with hate?
CMDR MILLER
Well, it's most likely something that happened to him as a child. Whatever bent Mexican Joker's mind this way, it clearly happened a... long... a long time ago. [the news break dissolves into the Texas detention center, and Jeff is at his desk]
JEFF
Oh shit, it's the flashback!
DAVID
This is the flashback?!
JEFF
It's the flashback! Come on! Something must be happening with the kids! [the agents rush to the sleeping area and see a gathering] Oh Christ, look!
KYLE
Shema Israel Adonai Eloheinu, Adonai ehad. ["Hear, Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One."]
JEFF
He's converting them all to Judaism!
KIDS
Shema Israel Adonai Eloheinu, Adonai ehad. ["Hear, Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One."]
JEFF
Oh Jesus, they're all Jews with their little aluminum foil yarmulkes!
DAVID
Jeff, you know what this means? Now we'll have to let them all go! This is how Mexican Joker breaks free!
JEFF
Hey, that's right. It is. [takes out a pistol and shoots both David and Rodgers in the head, then shoots another agent inside the sleeping area. All three agents die]
CARTMAN
Whoa!
JEFF
[pulls our his key ring and fumbles for the right key] Mexican Joker, I just want you to remember that I helped you. Jeff Corrigan. Remember, Jeff was your buddy. Now, come on! Let's go, Mexican Joker! [unlocks the gate]
KYLE
Goddamnit, nobody here is Mexican Joker! That's not what I meant! The future is not set! We make decisions now that affect our future!
JEFF
Nobody here is Mexican Joker?
KYLE
NO!!
JEFF
Oh, then I'm in the wrong flashback. [runs off and out of the center, kills a couple of more guards, hops into a car and drives away. The kids listen to the whole thing]
[Tegridy Farms, dawn. Inside, the family is having breakfast. Randy paces around the table and takes a seat between Sharon and Stan]
RANDY
Well, gang. Looks like Tegridy Farms are turning big profits again. We're on our way to becoming the biggest weed brand in the country. I'm not getting pushed around now, you got it? So go on. Anybody here wants to call me a towel, just go ahead and do it! Go on, Sharon. Call me a towel.
SHARON
Fine. You're a towel. [gets up and walks away]
RANDY
Best towel you ever had, bitch!
End of Mexican Joker

synopsis:Randy sees an opportunity for TEGRIDY in China. Randy lands himself in big trouble on a visit to China. Meanwhile, Stan starts a band to work out his frustration over having to move away from South Park.

script:Band in China

[The Marsh house, day. Stan plays an acoustic guitar in his room and hums softly, writing down lyrics from time to time]
RANDY
[pops in for a moment] Stan! Family meeting! Get downstairs! [leaves]
STAN
I'm writing a song, Dad.
RANDY
[returns] Nobody cares about that! Come on! I've got big news! [runs down the hallway and downstairs, laughing, and enters the dining room. Shelley is at the table reading her phone, Sharon is at the sink] Sharon! Shelly! Hurry! I've got it! [runs out to the living room. The others follow him there. Stan has his guitar and sits on the sofa]
SHARON
What is it, Randy?
RANDY
You guys, I've just had the greatest idea ever!
STAN
We're gonna move back to our old house?
RANDY
No! I've been trying to figure out how to make more money selling weed. And last night, it came to me. We could grow the family business by selling Tegridy... to the Chinese. [an epiphany plays] I did a little research. Turns out there's a lot of people in China. If we can get like 2% of that market to buy our weed, we'd make millions and millions of dollars! I'm flying to China tomorrow. I've got to get in on this before anyone else thinks of it. [walks towards the kitchen]
SHARON
Tomorrow? Ugh! [cuts him off and pulls him aside] Randy, are you forgetting about this Saturday?
RANDY
What's this Saturday?
SHARON
Autumnfest? Stan's concert? He and his little friends have been rehearsing all week. A lot of people in town are coming out to support him. Everyone but you?
RANDY
Everyone? [turns to Stan and whips out a Tegridy Farms shirt] Stan, you need to wear your Tegridy T-shirt at the performance.
STAN
Aw, come on, Dad!
RANDY
Stan, they're available on Amazon starting Friday, so you could really help promote the family business while I'm gone! [walks up to Stan] But, then again, I guess family doesn't mean all that much to you. [tosses the shirt onto Stan and walks away]
[Autumn Fest, day. A crowd mills around the festival as more people arrive. A horseshoe lands around a pole and Mr. Tweak is shown rejoicing as Mrs. Tweak and Tweek look on. The Blacks walk away from a food stand. Steve carries a burger while Tolkien holds a cotton candy cone. A couple sings onstage. She plays the banjo while he plays the fiddle.]
KATE & EARL
Tumbleweeds and squirrels, my darlin'.
Tumbleweeds and squirrels.
[the crowd claps for them]
KATE
Yeah.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Okay, that was the South Park Soundaroos! Thanks again to Kate and Earl! Alright, up next we have four of our local South Park fourth graders who have formed a band. Let's hear it for Stan Marsh and Crimson Dawn. [applause swells]
SHARON
Hi, Stanley! [waves to him as she holds up her phone to record him. Shelley stands next to her, and Grandpa sits behind them. Behind them is the McCormick family. Crimson Dawn gets onstage, with Stan on vocals, Butters on guitar, Kenny on bass, and Jimmy on drums.]
STEPHEN
Hoh, there's our Butters.
LINDA
[swooning] Oh, Butters! Oh, aren't they cute?
STAN
[nervously] Um, hi. We're Crimson Dawn, and um, this is a song I wrote about living out in the country, on a farm.
JIMMY
Alright, f-f-f-fellas, just like we rehearsed it. And-a 1, and-a 2, and -a [death metal music plays.]
STAN
[growls]
Fate is over!
Open your eyes!
BUTTERS
Get me off this farm!
STAN
There is no hope, no second chance!
All the elders saw the fall of the sky!
Pride and glory!
To touch the sky, we've burned the earth!
Built our own infirmity!
[A jet airplane, day. Passengers enter the cabin. Randy soon appears and takes a seat next to a passenger who's reading his phone, sets down his satchel, and buckles up.]
RANDY
First time goin' to China?
PASSENGER 1
Uhn, no, not really.
RANDY
[cheerfully] It's my first time. I'm goin' out to try and drum up a little "business." What are you headin' out for?
PASSENGER 1
Uh, I work for a clothing company. We're trying to break into the market and get the Chinese people as customers.
RANDY
Ohhh, huhuh, heeeyy. Fuck you.
PASSENGER 1
Huh?
RANDY
I, I had that idea like three days ago.
PASSENGER 1
So what?
RANDY
So when did you come up with it? [two other passengers appear two rows behind them.]
PASSENGER 2
Hehey, Mitchell, you're on this flight?
MITCHELL
Yeah, that's so funny! I'm working for Google now, overseeing the expansions into the Chinese user base.
PASSENGER 2
Heh, yeah, I'm still with the NBA doing some press with the players to try to... get more Chinese viewers.
RANDY
[looks around and sees three NBA players come in and put their carry-on luggage in overhead bins] Oh, for Christ's sake! You have a good idea and everyone wants to copy you! Fine! I can handle some healthy competition! Who else wants to go to China and get some of their money?! [a bunch of Disney characters stream in from the front of the cabin] Oh, for cryin' out loud! [Thor sits next to Randy] Let me guess. You work for a company trying to get Chinese people as customers. "Wow, where'd you get that idea?" [a First Order Stormtrooper sits to Thor's right, Snow White to the Passenger 1's left.] It's okay, it's okay. I'm sure there's plenty of Chinese people for all of us.
[Tegridy Farms, day. Stan's band is practicing in the barn]
STAN (BUTTERS)
[growling]
Searching, wandering
Looking for the perfect specimen.
Still pure. (Hate this farm!)
Immature. (I hate this farm!)
Acknowledged sickness
concealed, swaggering!
Unseen (Hate this farm!)
Wandering (I hate this farm!)
Looking for the perfect specimen.
[a man appears in the barn doorway and snaps his fingers to the song. Stan notices and stops the music] Okay, okay. Wait uh, hang on, guys. [Stan, Butters and Jimmy look back at the man, Kenny looks at Stan.]
PRODUCER
[claps at them] Very good, boys! [stops clapping] I hear you guys play at Autumnfest. I really like your sound.
BUTTERS
Who are you?
PRODUCER
Well I'm a producer. I manage all the big rock bands in South Park. PC Babies... All of them!.
JIMMY
You manage the PC Babies? Holy smokes, fellas, they're huge!
STAN
You wanna sign us so we can make a record and I can move away from here?
PRODUCER
Records? What, are you, kids, from the '90s!? There's no money in albums or singles or even tours anymore. What we need to focus on... is your biopic.
STAN
Biopic? You want to make the Crimson Dawn Biopic?
PRODUCER
PC Babies' biopic came out last week. Made over $100 million!
BUTTERS
Wow wee!
KENNY
(What do ya think, Stan?)
PRODUCER
Well I'll just let you guys think on it, but don't take too long, huh?
[International Airport in China, day. Chinese music plays as Randy walks through the airport and other passengers pick up their luggage. He walks up to customs. Two inspectors check the luggage of two passengers; the female inspector sends them on their way.]
FEMALE INSPECTOR
谢谢。下一位。["Thank you. Next."]
RANDY
[puts his suitcase on the scanner] Hello. Howdy. [hands his passport to the male inspector as the female inspector checks out the suitcase.] I'm a small business owner from the United States. You guys know any money people here? [the female inspector unzips the suitcase] Can I give you guys my card? I'm just starting to grow my business here in China. [the female inspector opens the suitcase to reveal the marijuana. The inspectors are shocked.]
MALE INSPECTOR
等一下，你看看这个。["Wait a minute, look at this"]
FEMALE INSPECTOR
What is this, sir?
RANDY
Oh that? That's weed. Marijuana. You know. [simulates a smoke and then the smoke drifting away, then smiles. The female calls security over as Randy checks his Chinese translation app.]
FEMALE INSPECTOR
保安，保安！赶紧过来！["Security, security! Get over here!"]
RANDY
Ah, here. Here we go. Jay shi daamaa Tegridy Weed. [an officer just comes up and handcuffs him.] Whoa! Oh hey! Everything alright? What's going on? [the officer takes him away] Uh hey, don-don't forget my suitcase! C-could you grab my suitcase? All my weed is in there! Excuse me! Jay shi daamaa!
[Spinny Mountain Records, day. The record producer lays out his plan for the boys. He stands next to a whiteboard with three-act listed on it. The acts haven't been filled in yet.]
PRODUCER
What makes a band truly great? It's the desire to be heard, and a commitment to a three-act structure that has a 20-minute setup, about an hour and a half of conflict, and a big, triumphant resolution. SO, let's start at the beginning, gang. When did your band first form?
STAN
Uuummm, it was about two weeks ago.
BUTTERS
Yeah. As a matter of fact, two and a half, three weeks ago, I'd say.
STAN
I hah, I hah, I hadn't seen my friend Kyle, and I hate living on a farm, so I started writing songs.
PRODUCER
That's good, that's good. [writes under Act I] "Lost a close friend. Put loneliness into lyrics."
BUTTERS
Yeah, and then Stan came to me, and then I said "Well I can play the drums."
JIMMY
But he already asked me to play the drums
BUTTERS
Well, so yeah, I, okay, I'll play guitar.
PRODUCER
[writes under Act 2] "Inner conflict over direction of band." Good.
STAN
Oh. And then Kenny learned to play bass watching YouTube videos of John Lennon with the Dalai Lama.
PRODUCER
Oh no oh OH oh yeah, no no, we don't wanna go there. Talking about the Dalai Lama doesn't go over well with the Chinese.
JIMMY
The the the what?
PRODUCER
Look, for this movie to really make money, we need to make sure it clears the Chinese censors, you know. We want those Chinese viewers..
STAN
[somewhat upset] Aw, seriously?
PRODUCER
Oh it's okay, there's plenty of other things to talk about with your story. How about, uh, what kind of things were you into when you were younger?
BUTTERS
Well, I always liked Winnie the Pooh.
PRODUCER
Okay-oh no. Nonono, that's definitely off-limits. Winnie the Pooh is illegal in China because some Chinese students said that he looked like the Chinese president,
STAN
Oh, come on. That's ridiculous!
PRODUCER
Hey, you wanna move away from your family, right? You wanna be successful on your own, right?
STAN
[a bit defeated] Yeah.
PRODUCER
All right. Well, you know what they say you gotta lower your ideals of freedom if you wanna suck on the warm teat of China.
[A Chinese prison, rainy day. A group of prisoners is sent across a yard, Randy struggles to keep up. A soldier strikes a prisoner on the left cheek with the butt of a rifle. Next scene is the prisoners assembling toy robots in a dimly lit room. Next scene is the rainy yard again. Randy stands in the middle of it alone as soldiers stand far away from him. One of the soldiers approaches and gives him a card to read, then shocks him to get him to speak.]
RANDY
Aaaugh. I am a proud member of the Communist Party, The Party is more important than the individual. [next scene has the prisoners assembling dolls in a brightly lit room. Someone is moaning outside, and he goes to the window to see who it is.]
PRISONER 1
不要！求求你放过我吧！不要，不要，求求你... [A prisoner is on his knees begging for his life. A soldier walks up and just shoots him, and he falls over. Randy is unnerved by this. Randy is then taken to a cell full of prisoners and thrown in. Nearby, a prisoner poops into a hole in the ground. Randy is alarmed]
A FAMILIAR VOICE
Oh, hello there.
RANDY
[a bit spooked] Who, who's there?
WINNIE THE POOH
Nobody. Just a bear. [steps into the light. Piglet shows up next to him] I was wondering since you're new if you might have... some honey?
RANDY
No, I don't have any honey. Are you prisoners here?
PIGLET
Some people said Pooh looked like the Chinese p-p-p-president, so we're illegal in China now.
RANDY
Jesus. What kind of madhouse is this?
[Tribunal, day. Two guards flank a prisoner as he pleads his case. The judge responds and the prisoner gets down on his knees. The guards soon carry him off. The judge asks for the next case, and Randy is brought up]
PRISONER 2
我求你原谅我。我是个很烂的人。我再也不会取笑共产党了。["Please forgive me, I beg you. I'm just a useless person. I won't make fun of the Communist Party anymore."]
PRESIDING JUDGE
你为你的国家和家人为耻。再补上十年！["You have brought shame to your country and your family. Another ten years for you!"]
PRISONER 2
不要！我求你不要！我不能再回去了，我不能再回去！["No! Please don't! I can't go back, I can't go back!"]
PRESIDING JUDGE
快把下一位带进来！["Bring in the next one!"]
RANDY
Your Honors, I'm just a simple farmer, from a simpler time. Now, I've never been to China before, but I hate to say I'm a little disappointed in all of you. From what I've seen, you seem to treat your people like dirt. You don't believe in any individual freedoms. I mean, you got Winnie the Pooh and Piglet in jail! Now, come on, China! You know, a country ain't nothin' unless it's got decency and in-tegrity! And I think I speak for Pooh and Piglet and all of Disney when I say you could use some 'tegrity, China! [brightens up] Now, it just so happens that I own a Tegridy farm. And I think I might be able to work out a deal for all you nice folk.
[South Park Elementary, day. Stan, Jimmy, Kenny, and Butters walk down the hallway.]
STAN
This is so awesome, you guys. Our band is gonna be huge.
BUTTERS
Yeah. And, we're gonna be rich.
KENNY
(They're the same thing.)
JIMMY
[annoyed] Yeah. Isn't this just great?
STAN
Hey. What's wrong, Jimmy?
JIMMY
Fella, I need to tell you something. I think I'm homosexual. And also, I'm addicted to cocaine.
BUTTERS
Oh, that's okay, Jimmy.
STAN
Yeah, we can get you a liver transplant.
PRODUCER
Cut! Cut! Listen, guys, we uh just got word back from the Chinese censors. They don't want us mentioning organ transplants.
STAN
How come?
PRODUCER
Well, they've been accused of harvesting from the-look look, it doesn't matter. They, they just said "no" to the organ stuff. Oh, and uhh, no homosexuality either.
STAN
No homosexuality?! We're trying to do a band biopic!
BUTTERS
Yeah! And what's wrong with homosexuality anyway?!
PRODUCER
Nothing. Unless you wanna make money in China. Now come on! Everyone back to one!
[A convention, somewhere. Disney, Marvel, and Star Wars characters from Pirates of the Caribbean, Beauty and the Beast, The Avengers, Frozen, Snow White, Winnie the Pooh, Aladdin, and others stand around chatting with each other.]
MICKEY MOUSE
[opens the door and enters the hall] All right?! Who's the asshole?! Which one of you decided to go and start badmouthing the Chinese government?! Haha. Who here thought they had permission to say anything critical of Chinese politics?!
THOR
Well, it is true, sir. The Chinese seem to exploit their own people in forced labor cam-
MICKEY
SHUT THE FUCK UP, THOR! You're here to flex and not speak, you fucking bitch!
POOH
Please, Mr. Marsh was only standing up for me and Piglet because we were political prisoners.
MICKEY
YOU are a fat diabetic bear, and if the Chinese don't want you, then I don't either! Now, who the fuck is Mr. Marsh?!
RANDY
Uhhh, that's me. Randy Marsh
MICKEY
Who is this?! I don't know you?! Are you from Pixar?!
RANDY
No, I'm from South Park.
MICKEY
What's South Park? Do I own that?!
OFF-SCREEN ASSISTANT
No, not yet sir.
MICKEY
You're telling me, haha, that I'm losing Chinese customers because of some shithead that's not even from MY company?!
RANDY
Hey, hold on a minute! Do you really think this business should be run through intimidation and fear?! Whatever happened to old-time values?! You already have business with the Chinese. You have all the connections money can buy! But there's one thing you don't have. That's Tegridy. Now, it just so happens-
[Mr. Mackey's office, day.]
MR. MACKEY
Boys, I understand you have a band at the school?
STAN
Yeah. what's wrong with that?
MR. MACKEY
Well, boys, it seems to me like your music is kind of... angry. M'kay? I mean, it's really loud, m'kay, and it's a little angry.
STAN
Yeah, because I hate living on a farm 30 miles out of town!
JIMMY
Yeah, tell him, Stan!
STAN
I can't stand my dad anymore, and if I want to do death metal, I can! It's a free country!
PRODUCER
Cut! Cut! Cut, cut. [flanked by two Chinese officials] Ah kids, let's not say anything about this being a free country.
STAN
Aw, come on!
PRODUCER
Hey! These guys were nice enough to come all the way from China to help us with our standards. We can at least listen to their notes. [One of the two men whispers into his ear.] Oh. Oka-okay. Okay. [to the boys] Actually gang, we need to rewrite the whole second act.
STAN
But that will take forever!
PRODUCER
Come on, guys! Everyone else is fine with China approving our entertainment. Even the PC Babies don't seem to mind, and PC Babies cry about everything. [approaches Stan] They just gotta rewrite the script before we continue shooting. Go back to your room and just write your story. It has to come from your heart.
[The Chinese tribunal, day. Mickey is making his case. He now tries to sell the Chinese on Randy's business proposal, and just like in South Park, the proposal was rejected. Mickey and Randy sit on a bench smoking weed. Mickey is pissed off.]
MICKEY
It's like, it's like they didn't even wanna listen.
RANDY
They didn't listen at all? But I... wuh-why not?
MICKEY
It's the bear. They're still pissed off about the bear.
RANDY
But for what?
MICKEY
'Cause some Chinese people on the Internet starting posting pictures of their President as Winnie the Pooh. It's a real thing. Look it up. [on Tegridy] Man, this is really good shit.
RANDY
What if we took their side, then? What if we showed China that we understand how they feel to be made fun of on the Internet?
[Tegridy Farms, night. Stan is in his room working on the second act. He hears the producer's words in his mind: "Remember: write your story. The script has to come from your heart." He begins to write, then picks up speed and smiles. He's found his groove. A Chinese censor walks up behind him and looks over his work. The censor walks some more, then turns and scribbles over the script. Stan looks up, surprised, but starts over. The censor paces behind him and stops again to scribble the script out. Stan sighs. Annoyed, Stan shields his paper and starts writing again. When he's finished, he hands the script to the censor, who finds it funny, but he reaches a part he doesn't find funny.]
CENSOR
嗯？这是什么？！你给中国人丢脸啊！["Huh? What is this? This is a disgrace to the Chinese people!"] [The censor rips the script apart. Stan sighs again and tosses the pencil aside, pulls out his laptop, and start writing the script there. The Censor looks on, then intervenes, and rewrites the script. They go back and forth working on the script. After yet another edit, Stan rests his head on his left hand.]
STAN
Now I know how all the writers in Hollywood feel. [the censor laughs, then complains.]
CENSOR
嗯？这是什么？！["Huh? What is this?"]
[Beihing, day. In a Chinese bazaar, Pooh and Piglet wander freely.]
PIGLET
My Goodness, Pooh. China sure is a big p-p-p-p-place.
POOH
Yes, Piglet. It is. Too big, I think, to find what I need. [turns left into a shop] Excuse me.
MERCHANT
Huh?
POOH
Would you happen to have... some honey?
MERCHANT
啊！我不要麻烦！我不要麻烦！走！["Ah! Don't bother me, don't bother me! Leave!"]
POOH
Oh bother. This just doesn't seem to be the place... for a bear.
PIGLET
[looks right] Wait. Pooh. Loo-l-l-look, look. [Winnie looks. In the middle of an alley is a table with a jar of honey on it.]
POOH
Ooo, Piglet! What wonderful luck! [rushes to the table and starts gobbling up the honey.] What delicious honey! Mmm. I would like to share, Piglet. Perhaps... I will share. In just a few more slurps, I can. [Randy pounces up behind him and chokes him with a cable, then takes him down to the pavement]
PIGLET
[looks on in horror] W-W-What are you do--Wha--No! Ohh! [Pooh continues to struggle, as blood begins to come out his neck. It takes a while, but Randy gets it done. Pooh is dead. Randy's face is covered in Pooh's blood.]
[South Park, day. The boys sit on the sidewalk curb]
STAN
I can't do it anymore, you guys. I can't even think with the Chinese government censoring everything I write.
BUTTERS
So there's not gonna be a biopic movie for us?
STAN
It's so wrong. You know, I mean, we live in a time when the only movies us American kids go see are ones that are approved by China.
JIMMY
Yeah. It' like China is the new MPAA.
BUTTERS
Stinks to say goodbye to all that biopic money and glory.
STAN
We just gotta face it. A death metal band is never gonna make real money anymore. The only band that would get approved by China would be all vanilla and cheesy. [gets emotional] I'm gonna have to live on that fucking farm forever. [lowers his head and sobs quietly. Butters comforts him. The ICE bus pulls up and drops off Kyle and Cartman.]
STAN
[looks up] Kyle! Dude, you're back! [rushed up to meet him. The other boys follow.]
CARTMAN
Yeah, the migrant detention camp was kewl, but it kinda rubs Kyle the wrong way. [puts up his right hand and points to it with his left]
KYLE
Anything happen while we were gone?
STAN
Not really. We just almost had a biopic made for our band, but ...wait a minute... [his eyes dart around as he thinks] Wait, vanilla and cheesy! I've got it. I've got it!
[Broncs, Live Aid, 1984, at Invesco Field. This is a fabrication, as the boys weren't alive back then, or they'd be men now. Jimmy walks up to the drums and starts drumming. Butters walks in playing electric guitar and wails away. Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny walk in dressed in their Fingerbang outfits]
FINGERBANG
Fingerbang-bang!
Bang bang.
Fingerbang-bang!
Bangbangbang.
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright.
'Cause I'm the king of fingerbang; let's not fight
I'm goin' tuh fingerbang-bang-
STAN
Cut. Cut, cut! [the special effects disappear and the green screen in the gym is shown] This is all wrong.
PRODUCER
No, it's good, kids! They're loving it!
STAN
Yeah, but I can't sell my soul like this. I want to get away from that farm, more than anything, but it's not worth living in a world where China controls my country's art. [one of the censor's protests] I don't care how many people you have! I've got something in me that just won't let me be a part of all this.
BUTTERS
Yeah! Whatever it is, I got it too!
THE OTHERS
Yeah!
STAN
I wanna be proud of who we are, guys! And anybody who would betray their ideals just to make money in China isn't worth a lick of spit!
[a Chinese video, similar to the gentrification commercials of Season 19. An acoustic guitar slowly plays over live-action footage of the 2015 China Victory Day Parade as well as people smoking, prisoners marching and clashes between protesters and riot police.]
NARRATOR
Us Chinese people have always liked things the old fashioned way. We like things a little simpler, a little quieter. And now, there's a new weed that goes along with China's beating heart. Because after a hard day of forced labor, or getting beaten for criticizing the government, we all could use a little time with some good ol'... It's the soul of the American West, right here in mother China. All hail the Communist Party, and all hail Tegridy weed.
[Tegridy Farms, day. A tractor backs up with a load of cash and dumps it onto the entrance. then drives off. Inside, the Marshes are eating dinner. Randy is back home but covered in Pooh's blood. He takes a hit from his joint.]
RANDY
Well, gang, looks like the family business is starting to really turn the corner. I don't know about you, but I, for one, think the world is gonna be a better, and safer, place, now that China finally has Tegridy.[takes another hit]
STAN
[notices his dad's appearance] Dad, why are you covered in honey and blood? [Randy just looks over his appearance] Dad? Did you kill Winnie the Pooh?
RANDY
Winnie the Pooh, Winnie the Pooh- Oh, yeah, I did kill Winnie the Pooh. [Stan just gets up and leaves.] Where are ya goin', Stan?
STAN
I'm going to go write another song about you.
RANDY
Ooo, about me? Make sure it talks about me bringing Tegridy to China!
End of Band in China


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The show’s creators celebrate the THIRD episode of Tegridy Farms. This week, Randy revels in a Tegridy Farms milestone. Meanwhile, Cartman stands his ground and refuses to get a shot.

script:Shots

[Tegridy Farms, evening. A cake with "300" in candle form is shown. Randy is carrying the plate it's on]
RANDY
Happy 300 to us.
Happy 300 to us.
Happy 300, Tegridy Farms.
SHARON, STAN, SHELLEY
[looking away in disgust] Ugh!
RANDY
Happy 300 thousand dollars.
Can you believe it, gang? We've broken $300,000 selling weed. [gets a cold reception] Not to be a dick, but I remember when you, Sharon, and you, Shelley, said buying a pot farm was a [air quotes] "stupid" idea. Now we're living the dream.
SHELLEY
You're living the dream. This is your dream!
RANDY
[waits a few seconds] You know, [scoffs] is it me, or are people starting to not be that stoked on Tegridy Farms? [silence] Are you guys still pissed off about the China thing? [silence] You may not like that I do business with China [picks up the knife on the table], but personally, I think you guys having a problem with China is racist. Now come on! Let's celebrate 300! [starts to slice the cake] Who wants shots?!
SHARON
Shots?!
[A clinic, day. Cartman sits on the exam bed in his briefs]
CARTMAN
No shots! No shots!
LIANE
Eric, you have to be a big boy.
DOCTOR
[starts to fill up a syringe] Big boys get a toy from the toy chest.
CARTMAN
[voice rising as the doctor draws closer] No! No! No! No! No! [screeches]
DOCTOR
[stops] Eric, it's just a little prick.
CARTMAN
[laughs, and the doctor gets even closer] No! No! No! Noooooo!
LIANE
Good boy, Eric! [Cartman panics and jumps all over the place, knocking over bottles and breaking glass everywhere before just running around evading capture]
[South Park Elementary, day. PC Principal is talking to Liane and Eric in his office.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Our school now has a very strict policy when it comes to immunizations. Everyone has to follow the protocol, or it puts everyone at risk.
LIANE
I'm sorry, PC Principal. It's just that my little Eric really doesn't like shots.
PC PRINCIPAL
Well, Eric, nobody likes shots. They're just a fact of life.
LIANE
No no, you don't understand. I-I've taken him to the doctor every Friday for the past four years. They try to give him his shot, but he gets scared and runs around. and he squeals like a little pig. The doctors try to catch him, but Eric greases himself up so they can't.
PC PRINCIPAL
I'm sorry, but my hands are tied here. If Eric isn't immunized, then he cannot go to this school.
LIANE
[sobbing] Please! I've tried everything! You have to let Eric go to school! I work all day, and without school, he'll just... he'll just have nothing!
PC PRINCIPAL
What do you think's gonna be different next time you try?
LIANE
Ih- if you could offer Eric something. Uhm, sometimes when Eric behaves this way, I think of a gift or a treat of some kind.
CARTMAN
Oh, that's a good idea.
PC PRINCIPAL
Like, what are you thinking?
LIANE
I don't know.
CARTMAN
Like, maybe, exclusive use of the tetherball court at recess for the next two months?
LIANE
Oh, w-would that be possible?
PC PRINCIPAL
What I care most about is the safety of the students, so if you take your shots, then I'll agree..
CARTMAN
Sweet.
LIANE
Eric, you really have to do it this time, okay? When we're at the doctor's you can't change your mind.
CARTMAN
[smiles] I won't change my mind.
[Clinic waiting room, Friday morning. It's calm at the clinic until a pig's squeal is heard, along with the sound of things crashing and glass breaking. The doctor's office door opens and Cartman runs out naked on all fours squealing like a pig down the hallway, The doctor gives chase.]
LIANE
[steps out of the office with Eric's clothes, trying to stay calm] Eric, it's okay! [the doctor tackles him and holds him for a while, but Cartman breaks free and runs into the receptionist's office, startling her. Papers fly up in the air and more glass breaks.]
DOCTOR
[gives up and walks back to Liane] I'm sorry, but I have a lot of other patients to see. We'll just have to try again next week. [goes back into his office and closes the door]
LIANE
Come on, Eric, we're going home!
CARTMAN
[peeks out over the counter] We're going home? You promise?
LIANE
[frustrated] Let's go! Get in the car! [Cartman hops over the counter and follows Liane]
CARTMAN
Wait, can I get a toy from the toy chest?
LIANE
[off-screen] One toy, Eric!
CARTMAN
Cool! [reaches into the chest and grabs a toy, then goes out the door. He didn't bother putting his clothes back on.]
[Downtown South Park, day. People are milling around as normal. Two motorcycle cops slowly drive by with their sirens chirping, and a float is heard approaching with marching band fanfare. The float appears - it's Randy standing at the top of the float celebrating his $300,000 achievement.]
RANDY
[speaking over a loudspeaker] Yeah! 300! Tegridy Farms! Hello, South Park! Thanks for making Tegridy the most profitable farm in South park! We couldn't have done it without you, so here! [randomly tosses beads at people] Here are some beads! ["China" by Red Rocker begins to plays] Here you go! Beads for everybody! I've got $300,000!
China, China!
Da da, ya ya, history
It was la lal la, China!
China, China!
[The townspeople don't know what to do as the beads continue to fly. Randy then drops his pants and starts to swing his penis around. Two motorcycle cops follow him out, chirping their sirens, and a janitor sweeps up after them] Alright, China!
[South Park Elementary cafeteria, lunchtime. The boys and Craig's gang are having lunch together.]
BUTTERS
So then I guess the school said Eric can't come here no more, and so he's been, like, kicked out.
KYLE
Cartman can't come to this school anymore?
BUTTERS
Yeah, and he was actually kind of upset about it, because he said on the phone that he has to do homeschooling with this really mean teacher.
KYLE
Oh my God. [smiles] I don't know how long this will last, but I'm gonna savor every minute.
CARTMAN
[runs to the table] Hey guys! I'm back in school! I'm allowed back, and it's all good.
STAN
You got your shots?
CARTMAN
No. I don't have to get my shots, ever! [pushes Kyle and Kenny to wedge himself inbetween them and sits down] And they can't do anything about it, because I'm a "consciousness objector."
TOLKIEN
A conscientious objector?
CARTMAN
Yeah I told the school, I said "Look, you guys, I happen to have 'religious, moral, or philosophical convictions'." And so- and I said "I believe that 'health and disease should not be controlled by vaccination'." Those are my beliefs! And besides, I don't want to risk immunizations making me artistic. [sniffles]
STAN
Dude, Cartman, don't you know that if you don't get immunized, you actually put people at risk who-
CARTMAN
[turns to Kenny] One second, one second. [gets ready to sneeze on Kenny] Sorry. One second, gotta sneeze. [nothing comes] Oh, never mind, never mind. [turns back to the others] I'm sorry. What were you saying?
STAN
I'm saying that we all had to get shots, and actually, if just one person doesn't- [Cartman sneezes and gets mucus all over his hands.]
CARTMAN
Oh! Snot web. I'll be right back, you guys. [leaves the table and walks around] Can somebody get me a paper towel? I got a snot web here. [leaves the cafeteria] Consciousness objector coming through!
[South Park Elementary, night. There's a parent-teacher meeting at the school gym. The parents are all discussing the situation]
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright everyone, listen up. [the crowd quiets down] I understand your frustration, but a government organization like a school cannot impose its will on a conscientious objector..
STEPHEN
It's not safe for our kids to be in this school! You do understand that up to 5% of kids with vaccines can still be at risk! Everyone has to do it, or it doesn't matter!
THOMAS
Yeah. I don't quite see how it's fair that all the rest of our community agrees to this. Why does one family get to have a problem with it?
LIANE
I'm sorry. It's just my strong, personal belief that [gets out a sheet of paper and reads] "among other things, vaccines contain harmful ingredients formaldehyde, aluminum, and even mercury."
STEPHEN
Aw, come on, Mrs. Cartman! All major medical organizations state that vaccines are safe! The CDC, the FDA, UNICEF, and the US Department of Health!
LIANE
Yes, yes, I know, but... [reads from her sheet] "We can't even risk a 0.1% chance of vaccinations making our children artistic."
JIMBO
Well, that's true. There are enough artists in the world.
SHEILA
Look, I don't know what kind of mother wouldn't vaccinate their child, but it's putting everyone in danger, and that's why-
LIANE
[her frustration come through and she moves towards Sheila] Then you try to catch him! [stabs her index finger towards Sheila] You try it! Don't you people criticize me until you've taken Eric to the doctor and you've tried to hold him down! I'm a good mother! Don't you dare question if I care about my child!
STUART
Oh, shit.
STEPHEN
Of, of course you care. Nobody likes seeing their child in pain. Maybe... maybe you should just let us take care of getting Eric his shots.
LIANE
[shaking with frustration] You don't understand how hard it is!
STEPHEN
We'll find a way to make it completely painless for him, okay?
[Cartman's room, night. He's sound asleep in his bed. Liane looks in on him, then moves on to her own room, where she turns the light on and off a few times. Downstairs, the living room door opens and Stephen enters quietly, followed by Linda, then by Gerald and Sheila. They all sneak across the living room to the stairs, then stop]
STEPHEN
Alright, alright. Bring him in. [Richard and Mrs. Tweek enter with the doctor] The little boy's room is upstairs.
LIANE
[coming down the stairs] Oh, I don't know if I can go through with this. My little Eric is going to be so mad at me!
STEPHEN
Look, by the time he knows what's happened it'll already be over.
LIANE
Did you bring his boo-boo present?
STEPHEN
Yes, yes. Come on, Thomas and Laura! [the Tuckers bring in a Hot Wheels racing game, with Linda Williams bringing in a sign saying "You Did It, ERIC"] Okay, see? We got the present, everything's gonna be fine. [leads the group upstairs and into Cartman's room. He makes room for the doctor, who puts his medicine kit on the bed, prepares a vaccine, and draws it close to Cartman]
CARTMAN
[sensing someone nearby, wakes up] Hey, what's going on? [instictively, he bolts from bed runs around in a panic] No, no. Nooooo! [jumps off the bed]
DOCTOR 2
It'll just be for a second!
STEPHEN
[tries to catch him] Oh, Jesus! [the others crowd in, but can't catch him]
LIANE
Eric, there's a big treat for you if you stay still!
LINDA STOTCH
Catch him! [Cartman leaves his room and runs down the stairs, taking his clothes off on the way down]
STEPHEN
Thomas! Linda! Yo-you gotta get him! [Cartman sees them and turns tail, running into the kitchen. He gets a jar of lard and scoops out lard to spread on himself. The doctor finds him and gives chase again. Cartman runs back into the living room, runs around, and Thomas tackles him for a moment. Cartman breaks free and runs out the front door. The others follow him out]
LIANE
Eric! Oh! [goes to look for him]
GERALD
Well, what do we do now?
STEPHEN
I think the only way we're goin' to get Eric immunized is by bringing in an expert.
[An awards shelf, day. Western music plays as all the awards given to Mesquite Murph are shown. The phone rings]
MURPH
[shown] This is Big Mesquite Murph. How can I help you? You say you got yourself a conscientious objector? Well, you just sit tight. There aren't never no hog that Big Mesquite Murph couldn't catch.
[Tegridy Farms, day. Randy has a new commercial for Tegridy Weed]
RANDY
[jumps into the scene] How many thousand dollars has Tegridy Farms made selling weed? $300,000! [the numbers cover the screen and blink] It's a 300-palooza! [makes snow angels on a pile of $1 bills] Come on down and see what we've got! [drives his tractor]
DEEP VOICES
WHAT WE'VE GOT.
RANDY
We've got $300,000, just selling [echo comes up] all this weed! [aerial shot of the weed lot. Next, he holds a joint] And this month we're celebrating all our new customers in China! [dances in the barn to reggae music with a Chinese flag and various Chinese take-out foods behind him] We're celebrating with new T-shirts! [they say] "Tegridy Farms made $300,000 and all I got was high." Get yours for just ten bucks! '[the shirt is shown with "$10" blinking and throbbing over it] We couldn't have done it without you! Remember, that's $300,000! [Randy has his feet up on a table in the barn. Randy turns the TV off with the remote control] Well? What'd you think, guys?
SHARON
How much did you spend making that commercial?
RANDY
Who cares, Sharon? Business is up.
SHARON
Nobody cares about your stupid $300,000! We've become the kind of business that we moved out here to get away from! You know why the Chinese buy our weed?! It's to plant on their student protesters so they can put them in jail!
RANDY
Yeah. We make money either way.
SHARON
You don't care how anyone else feels! We bought this farm together, Randy! Or did you forget that?! [leaves]
SHELLEY
I hate marijuana! [follows her mom out]
RANDY
[gasps] Shelley!
STAN
I hate marijuana too! [follows them out]
RANDY
[gasps] Stan!
[The Cartman residence. Liane comes in through the back door from shopping and finds Cartman sitting at the breakfast table seething quietly]
LIANE
Oh, Eric. I... wasn't sure if you'd be up yet. [drops the groceries on the kitchen counter, giggles, and walks over to Cartman] Eric, you know I only want what's best for my snookums.
CARTMAN
You read me a bedtime story. You tucked me in. And then you let half the town into my room to try and give me a shot against my will.
LIANE
It was supposed to make it easier on you, a-and they didn't catch you anyway.
CARTMAN
[points at her] This is goodbye, Mom! I can't live with you anymore! [sulks into the living room. Liane follows]
LIANE
Eric, please! You don't know how hard it is to be a parent! Sometimes we don't know the right thing to do!
CARTMAN
So you go along with society and and try to force immunizations on me, even knowing the health risks! What if immunizations made my friend Timmy the way he is?! What if they made Jimmy the way he is?! What if they made Tolkien the way he is?
LIANE
Eric, when I was at the store, I bought you some Little Debbie creme pies and-
CARTMAN
That isn't gonna work this time, Mom! I don't want to be around you anymore! [marches over to the front door and opens it] So I don't know where you're gonna stay, but you'll just have to figure it out! I've already packed your things. [a suitcase and duffle bag await her]
LIANE
Sweetie, you can't live on your own.
CARTMAN
You should have thought of that before you made this house a nightmare for me. Goodbye, Mother! [looks out into the street, then points the way out to her. She grabs the suitcase and duffle bag and walks out the door. He turns to walk back to the kitchen, but is confronted with Mig Mesquite Murph.]
MURPH
[puts on his grappling gloves] Alright, young'un. We can do this the easy way, or we can do it hard. [prepares the injection, and Cartman knows what's coming. He begins to run around]
CARTMAN
Weeaak! No, no! [runs around]
MURPH
Yeeee-haaww! [tries to lasso him, but knocks down the lamp instead] Suuuweee! [tries again, but Cartman slips away and runs upstairs.]
[Skeeter's Wine Bar, afternoon. Murph gets a shot of whiskey from Skeeter - his fourth one. He downs it in one gulp. Stephen approaches him with the others who went to Cartman's room]
STEPHEN
Well, what happened?
MURPH
I ain't never seen no hog like that. It's like it could in two places at once.
STEPHEN
You said you could catch him!
MURPH
Well I did catch him! Got him locked up in a pen! It's just every time I bring out that needle, he becomes like a hog tornado! But I'll get 'im!
RICHARD
Yeah. Or maybe you just believe a little bit that vaccinations shouldn't be mandated for school attendance due to possible still-unknown side effects.
MURPH
[narrows his eyes] Don't you question me. If anyone believes the most common side effect of vaccines, anaprophylaxis, occurs in only 1 per several hundred thousand to one per million vaccinations, it's Big Mesquite Murph! Now this hog you got here, he's contained, but now I need help getting him his shots. The only way we're gonna get him, is we gotta build a big enclosed pen, about a hundred feet in diameter. I'm also gonna need the best wranglers flown in from Wichita. And I'm gonna need some loud music, and some barbecue.
STEPHEN
Barbecue?
[Tegridy Farms, a cloudy day. A purple minivan is parked at the entrance. Liane rings the doorbell, and Randy answers]
RANDY
Mrs. Cartman?
LIANE
Hello, Randy. I'm... sorry to trouble you, but... I don't know where to turn. I was hoping maybe... I could buy some gumdrops.
RANDY
Whoa whoa! What's goin' on?
LIANE
My son.. hates me. The whole town... hates me. Nobody thinks I'm a good mom, [gets emotional] and I don't know if I am anymore!
RANDY
Okay, okay. Come on. Let's get you inside and get you some weed. [shows her in and takes her to the backyard, where there is another wooden swing. They sit in it]
LIANE
It all happened gradually, you know? [smokes a joint] I don't know why everyone's against me. Even my own son. [hands the joint to Randy]
RANDY
Believe me, I know how that feels. [smokes the joint] You try to do what's best for your family and all you do is get shit on. [hands the joint to Liane]
LIANE
I know immunizations are probably for the best, [smokes the joint] but then you read some of this stuff on the Internet [hands the joint to Randy] and, I don't know, it's scary.
RANDY
That's just it. [smokes the joint] When it comes to families, we have to do what we think is best.
LIANE
It doesn't matter. They're having an all-county mandated immunization roundup tonight. Any child not immunized is about to be.
RANDY
All-county immunization roundup? What's that?
[The immunization roundup, night.]
ANNOUNCER
Good evenin' everybody, and welcome to the CDC Child Immunization Challenge. This here special event is sponsored by Voices for Vaccines and also by Chevy. So with all that out the way, let's get to some action! [the crowd cheers. The gate opens and a blond boy steps forth and looks around.] First up, we have Danny Ray Johnson out of Bailey, Colorado. He has not been immunized since kindergarten. He says he just don't like needles. [a doctor comes out of the adjacent gate the vaccine ready]
DANNY
No! Nooo- [shrieks and runs away. The doctor gives chase]
ANNOUNCER
And there they go! [they run around the barrels and the crowd cheers them on]
DANNY
No! Nooo- [shrieks and runs away when he sees Murph jump off the gate and join the chase. Two rodeo clowns join the chase soon after, but none of them can catch him. Cartman gets restless behind his gate. A wrangler takes Danny down]
CARTMAN
Ah, AAAH! [the wrangler hog-ties Danny and sets him down for the doctor to deliver the vaccine in the butt through the pants, then takes his hat and waves it around to applause.]
ANNOUNCER
He stuck him in the left buttocks; that is an 8.7 score right there. [more cheering. Cartman gets more restless] Alright, let's hear it for little Danny Ray, folks. [a clown unties him and he walks off smarting from the shot] He's a little worse for wear, but now he can pick himself up a nice little toy from the toy chest. [Danny does just that. Cartman is really worked up now]
CARTMAN
[snorts] I've gotta get out of here!
[Tegridy Farms, a clear, starry night. The clouds have cleared and Liane and Randy are still talking, sitting on bales of hay. Randy's the one bawling now.]
RANDY
It's just... it's like, can't people see us trying to do what's best for my family? I'm trying to provide for them by running a business. I'm sorry if I make mistakes.
LIANE
I know, Randy. Other parents expect me to deal with Eric-
RANDY
And I get it from both sides, because my family's pissed off at me too.
LIANE
...I understand.
RANDY
No, you don't!
LIANE
Yes, I do.
RANDY
[garbled] No, you don't! Nobody understands.
LIANE
Randy, we both tried to do the best for our family. [gets up and walks away] And sometimes, when we're afraid of being judged, we can push our family away.
RANDY
Yeah, like, everybody's doing business with China. It's like "get over it."
LIANE
You should just feel lucky that you have a partner in doing what's right for your family.
RANDY
I am. I'm afraid I haven't been very kind to that partner lately. I think maybe it's time for an apology.
LIANE
Thanks for the talk, Randy. And for the weed. [turns and goes to the barn entrance.]
RANDY
Where are you going?
LIANE
[turns to look at him] I'm going to do the only thing I know how to do: be a mom. [turns around and heads out]
[The CDC Child Immunization Challenge, later. This time, a girl has been lassoed and shot]
ANNOUNCER
All right, and that is Dr. Chet Mowlins that just gave that girl her DTaP booster [the wrangler unties the girl and she goes for her toy] and her HPV vaccination. That is for genital warts. Way to go, Chet. Hey, folks, let's hear it for all these wranglers tonight. They're working extra-hard to bring immunity to your community. [cheers go up] Alright, folks, we are now ready for the main event. This young man has never had a single immunization. [Cartman is in the pen still trying to break free] He says he's an orthodox Jew and a conscientious objector. [Cartman stops and takes his clothes off] Everyone put your hands together now for little Eric "The South Park Piggy" Cartman. [the gate flies open, and a nude Cartman backs into a corner. Murph shows up.]
MURPH
[jumps into the pen from the top of it] Suuuuwieee! [Cartman runs into the ring. The wranglers begin their chase]
ANNOUNCER
There he goes, folks. Dear Lord, he's a slippery one.
[A lookout point over town, night. Randy drives up with Towelie and parks]
RANDY
Do you remember we used to come here and look over the town lights together?
TOWELIE
...Yeah, so what?! Then you turned into an asshole!
RANDY
I brought you here to apologize, Towelie. I let the money go to my head. I... I got greedy and I started acting like a towel. I need you back. I need Tegridy back, the way it used to be.
TOWELIE
No more harassin' homegrowers?
RANDY
No more harassing homegrowers.
TOWELIE
No more dealin' with those Med Men assholes?
RANDY
No more Med Men.
TOWELIE
No more kissin' China's ass?
RANDY
China's actually a free and loving country that-
TOWELIE
I'm out. [gets out of the car and leaves]
RANDY
[gets out of the car and chases after him] Wait, wait, Towelie, come on! I need you!
TOWELIE
[stops and turns around] I'm never workin' for a company that's regulated by a communist government!
RANDY
Okay, okay. No more selling to the Chinese.
TOWELIE
Then say it! Say "Fuck the Chinese government!"
RANDY
[softly] Fuck the Chinese government.
TOWELIE
I didn't hear you!
RANDY
Fuck the Chinese government! There!
TOWELIE
...Well... you just got your partner back. [they run into each other's arms and hug]
RANDY
Hahaha! This is it. This is the moment that Tegridy Farms got back on track.
[The CDC Child Immunization Challenge, later. Cartman is still evading capture]
ANNOUNCER
Dear Lord, we are going on 16 minutes here and ain't nobody caught this young'un. This might very well be a world record you're seeing here, folks.
LIANE
[rushing through the crowd] Get out of my way! Move it!
STEPHEN
Whoa whoa, Mrs. Cartman. Everything is fine here. [she punches him out of the way and climbs a barrier]
SHEILA
[grabs onto Liane's ankle] It's okay, Liane. They know what they're doing. [Liane kicks her away. Liane then tackles the rodeo clown and punches him]
ANNOUNCER
Oh, looks like we got a concerned parent in there trying to take issue with their child's well-being. [Liane goes after the lead wrangler and punches him out, then punches out the wrangler behind him]
CARTMAN
Mom! [Murph has wrangled him and is hog-tying him]
LIANE
Leave my son a [slow motion takes over here] lone! [she jumps to shield Cartman, a doctor jumps to vaccinate him. She reaches Cartman first, causing the vaccine to enter her butt instead] AHHHH!
CROWD
OHHHH! [the arena is quiet. Liane removed the rope from Cartman and he hugs her. They walk off together]
LIANE
[stops to address the crowd] I know I'm not the greatest mom in the world. I do the best I can. Whatever happens now is going to be done my way. Come on, Eric. [remove the syringe from her butt and throws it away, then they move on]
CARTMAN
[stops] Wait, Mom? [points to the toy chest]
LIANE
[turns around, now furious] No, Eric! No shots, no toy!
CARTMAN
What?? [she takes him by the hand and pulls him away]
[Family Medical Clinic, day. Cartman and Liane are there again, but this time, Cartman is in the lobby. His doctor comes out of the office and walks up to him]
CARTMAN
Okay, doctor. I'm ready for my shot.
DOCTOR
Eric, I've been speaking with your mother. I'm afraid there's some bad news.
CARTMAN
Bad news? What are you talking about? Mom?
DOCTOR
Your mother received a heavy dose of vaccine that wasn't meant for an adult. I'm afraid there have been... side effects.
CARTMAN
[panics] What side effects? MOM? [runs to the office] MOM! [opens the door] Mom, are you here, Mo- [gasps loudly as his jaw drops. Liane is painting a still life]
LIANE
[softly] Eric...
CARTMAN
Noooooooo... Noooooooo...
End of Shots


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Cartman has a heart attack. The citizens of South Park are moving toward a completely plant-based diet. Cartman is pretty sure the new food in the cafeteria gave him a heart attack.

script:Let Them Eat Goo

[Tegridy Farms, day. The Marshes sit at table and Randy comes in with laptop and coffee]
RANDY
Good morning, everyone. 'morning. So, listen guys. We are not in good shape. The whole "doing business in China" thing has sort of bitten us in the ass, [the projector screen comes on.] and now we aren't selling enough weed to keep up with our costs. [turns to look at a growth chart projected on a portable screen behind him.] You see this? This right here? That's us plateauing. We no longer get any of that sweet Chinese money, and now, all the money we do make doesn't even cover our expenses. [the same chart is on the laptop he was looking at earlier] So, [turns back to the table] how do we sell more weed? Stan.
STAN
[after several seconds] I don't know... Do like a sale. Like, a Fall sale?
RANDY
Not good enough! Shelly?!
SHELLY
I hate marijuana.
RANDY
Nice attitude! How do we sell more weed? Sharon?
SHARON
If you don't make commercials or do more parades for the town, we'd have more money.
RANDY
Right. Cut out all our marketing. That's Sharon's great idea, everyone. Towelie?
TOWELIE
You know what the problem is? It's the schwag. All those stands and seeds, they just go to waste, man.
RANDY
Go on.
TOWELIE
It's like, we sell all the good parts of the weed, but we throw away, like, tons and tons of all the leftover shit. You can sell that crap as mulch to a hardware company.
RANDY
Mulch. [looks at the graph] Use our discarded product to recover costs. [to the table] Everyone, great job. You just got powned by a towel.
[The school cafeteria, lunchtime. The students stand in line to get their lunches in the kitchen.]
CARTMAN
'[singing]' It's Sloppy Joe day!
CARTMAN AND BUTTERS
'[singing]' It's Sloppy Joe day!
CARTMAN
I seriously think that Sloppy Joe day is my favorite day at school.
BUTTERS
Yeah, it's the best.
CARTMAN AND BUTTERS
'[singing]' Sloppy Joe day! It's Sloppy Joe day!
A NEW COOK
Come on, keep the line moving, kids! [in view are Butters, Cartman , and Scott. Cartman notices that what he sees on his plate doesn't look like sloppy Joe.]
CARTMAN
What is this?
COOK
That's today's lunch. It's "feesh."
CARTMAN
Feesh?
BUTTERS
But, but this is Sloppy Joe day.
COOK
Yeah? Well, the menu's been changed. We had kids complainin' our food wasn't healthy or sustainable enough, so don't you start bitchin' about it now.
CARTMAN
What kids were complaining about health and sustainability?! What kids would care at all that- [gasps] the girls!
BUTTERS
The girls?
CARTMAN
The fucking girls! [the three boys walk over to the girls' table] Excuse me?! Can someone explain to us why this [holds forth his lunch] is on our lunch trays?!
BUTTERS
Yeah, it's supposed to be sloppy Joe day!
WENDY
We asked for healthier options and to sometimes have food for those of us who don't eat red meat.
CARTMAN
Oh my God. I'm about to lose my mind. [gets excited] You think you can just mess with a man's lunch?!
BUTTERS
It's okay, Eric. I-
CARTMAN
You think that your ideas about health and nutrition should be somehow interfering with mine?!
BUTTERS
Eric, Eric!
CARTMAN
You dictate what foods I can eat?! [convulses] Urgh [the tray falls to the floor. He stiffens up and tries to reach for anything]
BUTTERS
Eric, Eric?
CARTMAN
I can't, I can't. Butters, I can't. [falls back, smacking Butters' tray on the way down. Butters' meal lands on him]
[South Park Elementary, front lawn. An ambulance waits as Cartman is being loaded up into it. The rest of the school stands around looking at this incident. Two paramedics treat him. The brunette, Smith, puts some defibrillators on and gets ready to deliver a jolt]
PARAMEDIC 1
Clear! [the brunette delivers the jolt, then they both look at the EKG]
SMITH
We got him back!
CARTMAN
Agh. Fuck you, Wendy.
[As Cartman is being taken to Hell's Pass Hospital, Randy drives into town with a huge load of Tegridy weed; he and Towelie share a joint. Cypress Hill plays during this segment.]
RANDY
How much do you think we'll get for our mulch?
TOWELIE
Even if we only get 10 cents a pound, we have like a million pounds of it.
RANDY
This is gonna save our business. I'm really hungry all of a sudden. You want some Burger King?
TOWELIE
Yeah, I'll take some onion rings. [Randy pulls into a parking spot and goes inside.]
[Burger King, inside. Randy steps forward to place his order]
CLERK
Welcome to Burger King. Can I take your order?
RANDY
Uh, hi, can I get, um, large onion rings... the big Coke Zero and, um... What's an Impossible Burger?
CLERK
It's a plant-based burger, sir.
RANDY
Plant-based? You mean, it's not like a cow?
CLERK
No, sir. It's completely vegan, but it's engineered to replicate the taste and texture of beef.
RANDY
Hoh. Okay, I'll try it. [hands his debit card over. The clerk turns the card through the reader and hand it back. He also hands Randy the receipt and the burger. Randy takes a bite of the burger and savors it] Hey. This tastes like shit. You guys make money off of this?
CLERK
They're very popular, sir. A lot of people care about the environment and sustainability.
RANDY
Aw that, that's amazing. I mean, this seriously tastes like dog shit, and you get people to buy it? [gets an idea] Wait a minute... Plant-based... Plant... based... Plant-based. Oh my God.
[South Park Elementary, day. The kids are in the hallways. Cartman is in a wheelchair; Butters drives him around]
BUTTERS
Comin' through! Make way! [the stop by Tolkien, Jimmy, and Craig]
CARTMAN
Hey guys. How's it goin'?
CRAIG
You're out of the hospital?
CARTMAN
Yes. The girls tried to kill me, but they did not succeed. However, we cannot let the girls' protest ruin our lunch ever again!
NICHOLE
Oh, give me a break! [arrives from her locker] It's not just girls who wanna change the menu, it's boys too!
BOY
Yeah. I want vegan food.
MILLIE
A lot of students are protesting!
CARTMAN
Well, their protesting is ruining my lunch!
BOY
We have a right to free speech.
CARTMAN
Yes, we do all have freedom of speech! But at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others and you're ONLY THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF!
MR. MACKEY
[arriving] Whoawhoawhoawhoa, what's goin' on, kids?
BUTTERS
The protesters are tryin' to kill Eric again, Mr. Mackey.
MR. MACKEY
Okay, kids, we don't want another incident here, okay?
CARTMAN
They're trying to take people's lunch! They don't realize it harms people financially, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. [begins to choke]
MR. MACKEY
Eric, it's okay. We aren't going to change the school menu, okay? Everything's fine.
BOY
That's not fair!
NICHOLE
Doesn't it matter we're being silenced?!
CARTMAN
Agagagh, my lunch!
MR. MACKEY
Girls, I'm sorry, but the health of our students has to come first.
[Tegridy Farms, day. Gerald shows up at the front door and knocks. Randy answers the door]
RANDY
Gerald, thanks for coming! You're not gonna believe this!
GERALD
Believe what? Your text said that-
RANDY
Come on come on come on. [pulls him in. Next scene is in the kitchen. They go to the table, on which sit two burgers] I think I've perfected it, Gerald. I made a sustainable, healthy alternative to meat. I want you to try it. [hands a burger to Gerald]
GERALD
It's a hamburger?
RANDY
It's a Tegridy burger. Go ahead, try it. [Gerald takes a bite and chews it for a few seconds] Well?
GERALD
This tastes like shit.
RANDY
Yeah. It's plant-based. But keep eating it, though.
GERALD
[through the chewing] I just- I just don't think it's very good.
RANDY
Wait for it. Wait for it...
GERALD
[gets a small epiphany] Oh. [starts to giggle, then Randy joins in]
RANDY
Yeah ha ha?
GERALD
Yeah, it's good.
RANDY
Yeah, right?
GERALD
[takes another bite and chews on it] Whoa. It's really fucking good, man! This is like the best burger I've ever had!
RANDY
And you can eat a lot of them and not feel bloated. Towelie's had like 12. [points to Towelie, who's reclining against a cabinet eating a Tegridy burger.]
TOWELIE
Best burgers I ever had.
[The school cafeteria, lunch. Cartman is back a table with the other boys, and they're all eating barbecue ribs with corn on the cob and cole slaw. Cartman is still in his hospital gown, which means his back side is exposed. He's also wearing the hospital bracelet]
CARTMAN
[savoring them ribs] Ohm... oh my God. School cafeteria ribs. After all that yogurt and crap they gave me at the hospital? OHM.
BUTTERS
I looove barbecue rib day.
CARTMAN
Yeah. I think maybe I like rib day even more than sloppy Joe day. It's a difficult choice.
WENDY
Everyone? Everyone, can I have your attention, please? [the students all stop eating and look at her] Look, guys. We're supposed to be the young generation, right? We're the ones upset about the world our parents left us.
NICHOLE
Yeah, but eating this kind of food makes us all just as guilty.
WENDY
The millions and millions of cows and pigs and chickens that we harvest every year [Cartman begins to tremble in anger] are a huge reason for climate change.
NICHOLE
It is up to us, as students, to protest for change.
BOY
Young voices matter!
WENDY
Without sustainable and ethical food choices now, we're proving to be no d-
CARTMAN
[leaves the table] AAAH! GAAAH! [in the middle of the cafeteria, to Wendy] CAN I PLEASE JUST ENJOY MY LUNCH FOR FIVE GODDAMNED MINUTES?!
BUTTERS
You gotta calm down, Eric. Remember your condition, Eric.
CARTMAN
We all have freedom of speech, but stop talking about climate change DURING LUNCH TIME!
BUTTERS
Okay. that's it, Eric.
CARTMAN
Some of us can just enjoy some simple goddamned barbecue ribs! And I- Daah! [stiffens up as anger overtakes him] Oh God, they did it again to me, Butters.
BUTTERS
Eric!
CARTMAN
I think this is the Big One! Don't let me die.
BUTTERS
Somebody help!
CARTMAN
Don't let me die. Don't let me die, Butters. [drops on his back.]
[South Park Elementary, front lawn. An ambulance waits as Cartman is being loaded up into it. The rest of the school stands around looking at this incident. Two paramedics treat him. The brunette, Smith, puts some defibrillators on and gets ready to deliver a jolt]
PARAMEDIC 1
Clear! [the brunette delivers the jolt, then they both look at the EKG]
SMITH
We got him back!
CARTMAN
Agh. Fuck you, Wendy.
[Burger King, day, inside. A mother and son are at the counter]
CLERK
So that's one Whopper, one order of chicken strings, and a medium beverage. Is there any-? [stops when he hears someone outside]
RANDY
[outside] Burgers! Get your burgers here!
CLERK
Uh okay, that'll be fift-
RANDY
Plant-based burgers for sale!
CLERK
Excuse me one moment. [leaves the counter]
[Burger King, day, outside. Randy has his burger stand up, selling $5 burgers that are all natural, plant based, and locally made]
RANDY
Get your hamburgers here! [a crowd begins to form] Plant-based burgers for sale!
CLERK
[now outside] Hey, what are you doing?
RANDY
I'm sellin' hamburgers. All-natural, completely plant-based. [a customer pays up and gets his burger] Thank you, sir.
CLERK
You can't sell hamburgers here! This is a Burger King!
TOWELIE
You sell hamburgers here.
RANDY
Yeah, you sell hamburgers here.
CUSTOMER
This is seriously as good or better than a real hamburger. Can I get a couple more to take to work?
CLERK
Hey! Now look, buddy! I'm not gonna lose customers because of YOU! [walks onto the parking lot] We have plant-based burgers inside as well! Come try our Impossible Burger.
RANDY
Tegridy Burger. Made locally right here in South Park. Tegridy Burger.
CLERK
STOP that!
[The school gym, day. PC Principal holds a student assembly]
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright everyone, listen up! As you know, there are several students protesting the school menu. But there are other students who are voicing their concerns against changes. Eric Cartman is still recovering in the hospital, we all wish him well. [clears his throat] Now, the school has been looking into several options to deal with the problem, and I do believe we have found a compromise. We have found a new company in the plant-based fast-food industry who would like to be the supplier for our cafeteria. And so please welcome the founder of Incredible Meat. [steps aside and claps for the founder, who steps in]
INCREDIBLE MEAT FOUNDER
Hello, children. I want to thank you and I want to thank your fine principal for hearing me out. I take plants, and I process them into goo. I'm a goo man. I have factories all over the country. I have trucks right now loaded with goo that can be here within the week. The goo I speak of can be made into anything. It can be made into tacos. It can be made into hot dogs. And I promise you that none of you students will know the difference. I would very much like to be the plant-based meat vendor for your school. I would like to be the plant-based meat vendor for your town. I'm a simple family man and a vegetarian. I would like the opportunity to make you all vegetarians as well, and I thank you.
[Park County Community Center, day. Randy stands at the podium reading from index cards]
RANDY
Eating meat doesn't just hurt animals. It hurts people. It takes 13 pounds of grain to produce just one pound of animal meat. All that plant food could be used much more efficiently if-m, if people just ate it directly. Meat is also not environmentally friendly. Meat production is wasteful and causes enormous amounts of pollution. And the meat industry is one of the biggest... [after a few seconds, the camera finds him drifting away from the podium, Tegridy Burger in one hand, index cards in the other] ...Huh? Oh, I was just saying... [turns and walks back to the podium] that adopting a vegan diet is way more effective than switching to a greener car in the fight against climate change. For your health, for our planet, for the animals and for each other, we have to switch to plant-based foods. Now, it just so happens-
[Burger King, day. The clerk is all alone now, having lost all his business to... He hears music outside and walks towards it]
CLERK
You gotta be kidding me!
[...Tegridy Burger. Randy's hamburger stand is now a full-fledged fast-food restaurant]
RANDY
[through the PA system] It's our Grand Opening! Come and visit your town's only plant-based burger joint!
CLERK
It's not the town's only plant-based burger joint! [goes back to Burger King. Tegridy Burger is humming with activity]
RANDY
Celebrate our Grand Opening! Tegridy Burger! Cheeba cheeba. Cheeba cheeba.
[The school cafeteria, day. Tolkien is at the entrance on the lookout]
TOLKIEN
Here he comes. [two seconds later, Cartman enters the cafeteria using a walker. He's in his hospital gown. He sees all the other students staring at him. He turns right and goes to the kitchen]
CARTMAN
[walks past Mr. Mackey] Mr. Mackey.
MR. MACKEY
[nervously] Wuhuhuhu... hello, Eric.
CARTMAN
[stands in line behind Butters] What's goin' on, Butters? It's taco Tuesday. [the line moves forward]
BUTTERS
[weakly] It's taco Tuesday... [turns and walks forward. He gets his lunch, looks back at Eric, and heads for the boys table]
CARTMAN
These tacos look different. What kind are they?
COOK
They're... Incredible Beef... tacos.
CARTMAN
Oh, Incredible Beef tacos. That sounds nice. [takes his tray and heads back to the cafeteria, where he again sees the students stare at him. He joins the other boys at the table. He looks around and the other students turn back to their meals. Nobody is talking. Cartman bites a taco and his friends look on. After 25 seconds...] Did you guys see that new Joker movie?
MR. MACKEY
Whoa, uh, thank God it worked.
[City Wok, day. The goo man stands outside the restaurant and looks it over, then goes inside.]
MR. KIM
Welcome City Wok. I take a order prease.
GOO MAN
Are you the owner of this restaurant?
MR. KIM
Yes. I take a order prease.
GOO MAN
I'd like to do business with you. Your establishment here is perfect for my plant-based meats. You see, I am a goo man. If you carry my product, Incredible Meats, we can put the word Incredible before all of your dishes.
MR. KIM
You mean instead of City Chicken I could have Incredibre City Chicken?
GOO MAN
That is correct.
MR. KIM
You mean instead of City Mongorian Beef I could have Inrcedibry City Mongorian Beef?
GOO MAN
That's right.
MR. KIM
You're saying now I could have scallops with Incredibry City XO sauce?! Okay, sign me up!
GOO MAN
That is most excellent. [gets out a pad and pen] Now, how many customers, on avarage, do you have per day?
MR. KIM
Including my wife? Uh, 0 to 1 per day.
GOO MAN
[stunned] That's it?
MR. KIM
Yeah, I got no customers now that Tegridy Burger opened up. Everyone want plant-based food now. That why I'm ready you sign me up.
GOO MAN
What is Tegridy Burger?
MR. KIM
Yeah, here you look. Down the brock. [they walk to a window and look out] Most popular prace in town. [they look at the place for a few seconds]
GOO MAN
Is that so?! [makes his way to the entrance and leaves]
MR. KIM
Hey! [follows him out] Hey, what about my incredibry City chicken?
[Tegridy Farms, day. A farmer knocks on Randy's door. Randy answers it]
RANCHER
What'r you doin' you sonofabitch?
RANDY
Excuse me?
RANCHER
I'm the biggest cattle rancher in South Park. I made ma livin' 62-odd years before you fancy plant growers done showed up and put me out of a job!
RANDY
Well I'm sorry, Mr. Cow Killer, but this is called "evolution."
RANCHER
I got 300 cows that the world suddenly decided they got no use fer! What am I supposed to do with them?! Put them in a zoo?! What they gonna do now? Go start some cow circus?! Go make some cow TV show?! You are single-handedly making cows extinct! You got a plan for 'em all? Fine! [turns to whistles to his cattle] Come on! [cows emerge from the field and gather outside the front door.] Come on! Yeah, come on! Mr. Plant-based Burgers here is gonna take care of you now! [makes his way through the herd in order to leave] Yeah, don't worry. He cares about the environment, so he could figure out what to do with you.
RANDY
Uh ho, hehey, fuck you!
RANCHER
No, fuck you, sumbitch! They're your problem now!
[South Park Elementary, 4th Grade. The students are in their seats, but Mrs. Nelson is seated, hunched over a Tegridy Burger, unable to take another bite but making an effort to.]
BUTTERS
...Teacher? [she lifts up a finger and mumbles a bit. The lunch bell rings]
CARTMAN
Lunchtime! [nothing was taught this morning]
[The school cafeteria, lunch. The students stream in as Mr. Mackey keeps watch]
MR. MACKEY
Walk, don't run, m'kay?
CARTMAN
Hey Butters! [Butters stops, a bit unnerved] Wait up, dude. You know what today is, right? It's Salisbury Steak day! Salisbury Steak day!
BOTH
It's Salis-
BUTTERS
[flatly] -bury Steak day! [looks dejected]
CARTMAN
Butters, is something going on? Your lunch dances aren't the same.
BUTTERS
Eric, I. I just hate lying to you. I mean, you've been in the hospital. Twice. I feel guilty.
CARTMAN
Guilty... about what?
BUTTERS
It's our lunches, Eric. It's... Incredible Meat.
CARTMAN
Yes, I think it's pretty good.
BUTTERS
No, Eric. See, there was this guy. He's a goo man.
CARTMAN
The fuck is a goo man?
[Tegridy Farms, day. The cows are still milling around eating the weed. Some of them poop as they walk. Randy is in his tractor driving around.]
RANDY
[comes across a cow] Go on! shoo! Hey! Goddamnit! [some time later, he's talking to Towelie] I don't know what we're gonna do. These cows are eating all our weed and they're shitting everywhere. They're gonna put us completely out of business!
TOWELIE
Did you find anyone else to take 'em?
RANDY
Nobody wants cows anymore! They're bad for climate change! [takes a quick look around] We gotta kill 'em.
TOWELIE
What?!
RANDY
They're ruining our burger business! We gotta kill all these cows!
TOWELIE
How are we gonna do that?
RANDY
Look, it's not gonna be easy. It's not something anyone wants to do but... we're just gonna have to get really, really high.
[Tegridy Farms, sunset. Randy and Towelie cook some Tegridy burgers on a grill in the barn and then eat them, becoming high. , to the tune of "Pass The Dutchie" by Musical Youth. At nightfall, they approach the cattle with shotguns and begin shooting them each directly in the head.]
RANDY
Yeeheeyeah! [From a distance, silhouetted in the night, Randy and Towelie continue to shoot the cattle in the head. They then constume more tegridy burgers, surrounded by wrappers all across the ground. Randy is then seen using a bat to savagely beat one of the cows to the ground.]
TOWELIE
Yeee-haw! [Rides a cow while holding a pistol, then shoots it in the head as both the cow and Towelie fall to the ground.]
[Burger King, night. The room is dimly lit. The Goo Man is sitting at a booth speaking to someone, with a lantern on the desk next to him.]
GOO MAN
I've been in your town a little while now. What I see is a community that is ready for change. You see, I am a goo man. [across from him are Cartman and Butters. Butters looks between Cartman and the Goo Man nervously, pounding his fists.] What I serve in your school cafeteria is a synthetically-modulated plant protein. I have taken over nearly all the fast food restaurants here in town and teamed up with the fine people in your community. [The clerk is now standing next to him.] This my new regional manager, H.W.
CLERK
It's Rick.
GOO MAN
[annoyed.] Shut up, H.W. [narrows his eyes again.] You see, I'm trying to reach all the school cafeterias, all the stadiums, fast food restaurants, all the places that serve shitty food and serve shitty goo. [We see the Incredible Meats factory where his goo is made.] The goo for these kind of places is made in a factory. [A scientist is seen working in a laboratory, wearing a hair net and a mask, surrounded by microscopes, beakers and more.] It's made in a lab. [Factory workers mi together the goo in enormous vats.x] It's just down-market goo. [A worker pulls a level and green go comes down a slide out of a machine. The green go then goes down huge conveyor belts.] But I can tell people it's healthy and earth friendly, [Construction workers build a long pipe in the mountains, lowering the last piece into place.] and I can send my goo through a network of pipes running all the way to the ocean. [Back to the Burger King as he finishes his monologue.] So, that it can be eaten by people who eat crappy food anyway -- from coast to coast.
CARTMAN
[looking at Butters.] And that's what we have for school lunch now? That's what all the kids decided while I wasn't there?
GOO MAN
But you see, it doesn't work unless I own all the crappy food places. Mr. Rancher? [the Rancher walks in from the left side of the frame.]
RANCER
Y-Yes sir. Mr. Goo Man?
GOO MAN
Have you done what I've asked you to do?
RANCHER
It's all done, sir. You'll have everything you need.
GOO MAN
[tips his hat.] Well if you don't mind boys, I have work to tend to.
CARTMAN
Me too. I need to have a word with the students at my school. [gets up to leave.]
BUTTERS
[concerned, following him away.] Oh, God, Eric! What are you gonna do?!
[A news show]
NEWS ANCHOR
It has become the most popular burger in Colorado. The plant-based Tegridy Burger is changing the way people think about food. [Main Street. Twelve townspeople are eating Tegridy Burger and appear lethargic, with one man laying on the ground. A car moves slowly across the street, the occupant stopping then eating again twice.] All over the state, people are turning vegan and eating more ethical sustainable meat.
BLL KEEGAN
[standing next to Randy in front of the crowded Tegridy Burger store, dozens of customers present.] I'm standing now with Randy Marsh, the owner of Tegridy Burger, and, Mr. Marsh, you must be pretty excited. [customers cheer and applaud Randy as he looks back at them.]
RANDY
Yeah, you know, we're all just -- We're all just bein' healthy and ethical over here!
BLL KEEGAN
Uh-huh, and, Mr. Marsh, what about [abruptly shifts tone, staring into camera and moving in front of Randy.] the student protests coming out against your burger right now?!
RANDY
[caught by surprise.] Huh?
BLL KEEGAN
Students are coming forward, saying that Tegridy Farms is unethical and hypocritical.
RICK
[joins the reporter, wearing a blond ewig and a blue college Cows jacket.] That's right! Tegridy Burger is a fraud! We caught their farm on camera. Just take a look!
BLL KEEGAN
We warn you, the following footage is graphic. [footage plays of Randy and Towelie killing cattle the other night; Randy kicking a cow that is already dead as it groans; and Randy pulling down his pants and exposing himself next to a cow.]
RANDY
Huhuhuh! [shooting a final cow in the footage as mooing can be heard]
BLL KEEGAN
Mr. Marsh, what do you have to say about these images? [customers are already booing and beginning to throw burgers at him.]
RANDY
Oh, hey. Fuck you! Oh, they were -- They were just -- We didn't eat 'em!
[The school cafeteria, lunchtime. The students are all enjoying lunch in the cafeteria when Cartman walks through the double doors, still in his hospital gown..]
CARTMAN
Hey, guys, looks like I almost missed lunch.
BUTTERS
[Sitting with Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Craig, Clyde and Scott] Oh, God. Someone's gonna die.
CARTMAN
I found out about what we're eating here at the school. I found out what it's made of and where!
MR. MACKEY
[Approaching Cartman cautiously] N-Now, Eric, stay calm, mm-kay! We're sorry. We were just trying to find a compromise! Now just be calm.
CARTMAN
What are you sorry about? It's me who owes all you guys an apology. [The students all look deeply confused.] I thought you guys were all trying to force me to eat healthy, but I've learned that a lot of this stuff is made in a factory and processed with tons of salt just like all my favorite foods! SpaghettiOs, Rice-A-Roni... Here I was thinking what you wanted was stuff from a farmers market. I just didn't want my food to change. School cafeteria meat is just processed crap that comes in a box, and this is... just processed crap that comes in a box. [Wendy, Bebe and Monica Ryland seem dismayed as they look at their food now.] I don't have a problem with it. All I wanted was to be able to eat the same garbage I always have, and this is definitely garbage. And hey, if it happens to be more ethical and sustainable, well, I guess I'm fine with that, too. So, you see, guys? There was actually no reason to protest! We were actually all on the same page all the time! At least we learned that freedom of speech truly doesn't matter! Come on, let's eat!

synopsis:It's Halloween and Randy is dealing with his daughter's marijuana problem. Butters gets an unexpected surprise when he visits the Egyptian Artifact exhibit at the Denver Museum.

script:Tegridy Farms Halloween Special

[Tegridy Farms, day. The farm is decked out for Halloween. In the living room, Randy brings out more Halloween decorations. Sharon is working on her laptop, Stan is busy on his phone]
RANDY
[dances in with a Jack O'Lantern] It's the most wonderful time of the year. [puts it on the table] Well? You all excited, gang?
STAN
For Halloween? I guess so.
RANDY
Ugh, this isn't any Halloween, because this week, Tegridy Weed is doing a Halloween special. It's big promotional thing. Everyone's gonna love it. Hey, wuh-where's Shelly?
SHARON
Shelly hasn't come out of her room in two days.
RANDY
Why?
SHARON
[angrily] You know why, Randy.
RANDY
[Sighs] Yeah. Yeah. [Sharon glances at him]
[Shelly's room, later. Her door is open, and Randy walks in]
RANDY
Hey, Shelly? Can I talk to you for a minute?
SHELLY
What do you want?
RANDY
Come on, kiddo. [sits on her bed and motions for her to sit next to him] Come talk with your old man, huh? Come on now. [Shelly leaves her desk to sit on the bed] Shelly, we need to talk about your marijuana problem. You know, what's your problem with it?
SHELLY
I hate marijuana!
RANDY
Yes, we all know, but ugh, why?
SHELLY
It stinks, and it makes everyone in this town dumber than they already are!
RANDY
Shelly, the truth is, some of the most important people in the world smoke weed. Did you know that Snoop Dogg smokes weed?
SHELLY
Yes, everyone knows Snoop Dogg is a stupid pothead!
RANDY
Ugh, way more people enjoy marijuana than you think, okay? Okay, who's your idol? Who do you most look up to in the whole world?
SHELLY
Serena Williams
RANDY
Total stoner. High as a kite. Every tennis match.
SHELLY
No she's not!
RANDY
You don't know that, Shelly! Now you're just making assumptions!
SHELLY
Everyone in this country is getting dumber, and I wish Marijuana was illegal again!
RANDY
[gasps and stands up] Shelly! [begins to pace the room] Okay, loook. The thing is, this problem you're having with marijuana? It's just got to stop, okay? We're working on out Tegridy Farms Halloween Special, okay?? Nobody wants a giant bummer ruining it! I love you! [leaves and closes the door]
[The Egyptian Artifact exhibit at the Denver Museum, day. A shadow appears, followed by the person casting it: Butters]
BUTTERS
[looks around] Whoa. Very impressive. [strokes his chin] Indeed. [walks up to a plaque and reads it with a loupe]
STEPHEN
[lookin gon with Linda] Find anything good, Butters/
BUTTERS
One minute, Dad! Archeologist Butters just needs to get his stamp and sticker for his autograph book. [gets a sticker of Baster and a stamp] Aha! another rare find!
STEPHEN
Well, did you all enjoy the museum, gang?
BUTTERS
Well wait wait, we can't leave yet! I got all the stickers and tamps except for one!
STEPHEN
Well I'm pretty sure we saw the whole exhibit.
BUTTERS
Can I just check around one last time?
STEPHEN
Alright, Archeologist Butters, but then meet us back right here.
BUTTERS
Well o-kay!
[An Egyptian funeral ship. A guide is explaining its varioys aspects]
GUIDE
What you're seeing here are original knots which were joined in the main pieces of the Khufu boat. The cedar timbers of the boat's hull were lashed together with hemp rope, a technique used until-
RANDY
Whoa! Whoa! Wait just one second! Are you actually saying that hemp, a classification of cannabis [Shelly looks at him], was actually used by he ancient Egyptians? [strikes a pondering pose]
GUIDE
Well yes. In fact, it's been found that cannabis was used by Egyptians for its medical properties as well.
RANDY
Hold the freaking phone! You're telling us that marijuana has been used throughout the centuries-?
SHELLY
Is this why you brought me here?
RANDY
No, I d-, I'm just, I'm surprised that-
SHELLY
You said you wanted a special day with just your daughter. You said a father-daughter day at the museum could help us connect.
RANDY
And, and it is, Shelly. We're havin' a great time!
SHELLY
I don't care if Egyptians used stupid pot! [runs off in anger]
RANDY
[noticing the stares, stands up] She has a marijuana problem. Shelly! [runs after her]
[The Egyptian Artifact exhibit, at the same time. Butters retraces his steps]
BUTTERS
Been there... Saw that... Where's that stupid last sticker stamp? [sees a hallway he missed earlier] What's this? [he sees something ahead of him that excites him and runs to it. The sarcophagus of Took-tan Ra]
BUTTERS
Whoa... [gets to the exhibit and reads through his loupe] "Sarcophagus and mummified remains of Egyptian royalty." This is it! My last sticker! [gets ready to stamp his sticker book...]
JUD
[interrupting] That's the mummy of Took-tan Ra. You don't wanna put that stamp in your sticker book. Nobody puts that stamp in their sticker book.
BUTTERS
But this is my last one!
JUD
It's got a curse on it. Ancient love cure not fit for any child. You can look at the mummy all you like, but... you don't want that stamp... in your sticker book.
BUTTERS
[looks at his sticker book] Haha, that's okay. I'm no ordinary child. I am Archeologist Butters! [stamps his sticker book and runs off happily. He doesn't notice the brief glow the stamp gives off] Happy Halloween, Mister!
JUD
[watching him go] For some of us, maybe.
[Tegridy Farms, day. In the barn, Randy paces back and forth while talking to Towelie.]
RANDY
It's just so hard being a parent sometimes, you know? I've tried everything to get through to my daughter. I took her to a laser show, I played her all of Dark Side Of The Moon, but... it's like... it's like there's something in her head that just doesn't get it!
TOWELIE
That's awful, Randy. I'm sorry.
RANDY
It's just- I have to live my life, you know? I can't let her problems with marijuana drag me down anymore.
TOWELIE
No, you're right You're totally right.
RANDY
So, anyway, hey. How's the Halloween Special comin' along?
TOWELIE
The Halloween Special? Oh it's ready.
RANDY
It's ready?
TOWELIE
Yeah, it's right over here. [shows Randy the way to the new plants]
RANDY
O-ho wow! The Halloween Special! I'm so excited to try it.
TOWELIE
Yeah, it's basically a hybrid of our Tegridy Gold and Colorado Kush. Turned out really great, I think.
RANDY
[inhales the aroma] Oh, wow, that is nice! I'd like to see anyone compete with this Halloween Special.
[Butters' house, night. He's asleep in his bedroom, on his right side. He flips over to his left side, and the stamp begins to glow. Something goes thump and Butters sits up, wide awake. He hears a knock]
BUTTERS
M-Mon? [two knocks] ...Dad? [the door bursts open and a mummy walks in. Butters screams as the mummy trashes the room. The mummy then grabs Butters... and hugs him. Butters calms down] A little... Why. Oh. Okay. Oh. Okay. Okay. Oh that's okay. [softly] That's okay. There you go. [the mummy lets go and sits on the bed next to him, presenting him with a gift] Form, for me? Oh, thank you. [takes the gift and opens it] Oh wow! A Fitbit! [the mummy murmurs something] Why thank you. Thank you. I... actually already have a Fitbit, but I could-
MUMMY
Huh?!
BUTTERS
I could give this one to a friend. [the mummy growls and stands up angrily] I just... I have one, so... [the mummy goes into a rage and finishes trashing the room, then just turns around and leaves]
[Tegridy Farms, kitchen, night. Shelly is cooking up a strange brew on a hot plate in her room.]
SHELLY
Furniture polish, paint thinner and bleach.
Ammonia and antifreeze. One tablespoon each.
I hate everybody, I just like to read.
Everyone's stupid. They smoke too much weed.
So with this eldritch potion and these ancient words
I make my revenge upon all the turds.
[she adds a lot more bleach and continues to stir]
[Butters' house, day. He's eating Frankenberry cereal breakfast in the kitchen when he hears two knocks and gets alarmed. He leaves the kitchen to go to the front door. He opens the door and two officers stand outside]
OFFICER BROWN
Butters Stotch?
BUTTERS
Yes sir?
OFFICER BROWN
We want to ask you some questions about what happened in town last night.
BUTTERS
what... happened in town?
OFFICER
People were attacked by an ancient Egyptian mummy. It killed five people and destroyed everything it could.
BUTTERS
[nervous] Oh, uh, a mummy, huh? That's, that's weird.
OFFICER BROWN
Oh, you just think that's weird? Because the mummy said you two got in some kind of altercation last night.
BUTTERS
What?? The mummy talked to you??
OFFICER
Is it true, sir, that you and the mummy [reads his report] "got into an argument over a gift you didn't seem to appreciate"?
BUTTERS
There was no argument. I just said I already had it and I'd give it to a friend.
OFFICER BROWN
A present that the mummy got for you?
BUTTERS
I, I just goh-
OFFICER BROWN
You can see how that could be pretty hurtful.
OFFICER
Did you throw the mummy out of your house?
BUTTERS
No! I didn't throw the mummy out of the house! The mummy got all pissed off at me and left! [the officers look at each other, and Brown whips out his own notepad and starts writing]
OFFICER BROWN
You're gonna have to share in the damages here, son.
BUTTERS
But I didn't do anything wrong! Okay, look officers, I think [cups his hands together nervously] I'm under some kind of curse.
OFFICER
Well that's what the mummy told us about you.
OFFICER BROWN
You got a summons to appear in court. Until then I just suggest you and the mummy stay away from each other. [rips out the ticket citation and plants it on Butters' forehead]
[Tegridy Farms, barn, day. Randy and Towelie are sampling their newest hybrid.]
RANDY
Oh, man, I really like it.
TOWELIE
Yeah, it's smooth.
RANDY
It's really smooth. This is so good that we shold stop smoking it right now. We don't want to ruin our Halloween experience, you know? [Shelly walks in with her eldritch potion, unseen] This is seriously gonna be the best Halloween ever. [she chucks the potion all over the Halloween Special, causing Randy and Towelie to turn to see what happened. Many of the plants suffer chemical burns. Randy gets alarmed] AAAAAAA! Shelly!
SHELLY
That's what I think of your stupid special! [walks away and Randy races for the plants]
RANDY
No! Nooo!!
[South Park Elementary gymnasium, day. Mr. Mackey has another assembly, this time over appropriate halloween costumes.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright everyone, listen up. Halloween has almost arrived and I wanna make sure that we are all aware of certain guidelines when it comes to Halloween costumes at school. Now, I don't wanna see any FUCKING SOMBREROS! Alright, if I see any fucking Mexican sombreros, or anyone fucking dressed like a fucking Native American, I'm gonna lose my fuckin' shit! There will be no hobos, or bums, anything depicting people from low-income households.
CARTMAN
Ahp, no Halloween for you, Kenny.
PC PRINCIPAL
And lastly, heed my fuckin' words. If I see any of you girls dressed as fucking Moana, I'm gonna lose my fucking mind! Alright now, the student book fair is coming up next week. We encourage all students to be able to- [crasing sounds herald the mummy's arrival. It crashes through the double doors and stomps across the floor. The students flee in all directions. The mummy grabs students at random and throws them all over the place]
[South Park Elementary, Counselor's Office, moments later. Butters faces Mr. Mackey.]
BUTTERS
...and that's all that happened. I put that stamp in the sticker book, and now this mummy is destroying everything around me. I need help.
MR. MACKEY
Okay. An-and do you feel like maybe the mummy is trying to, you know, get you to react?
BUTTERS
Wuh-what, what do you mean?
MR. MACKEY
Well, you know, Butters, the mummy feels like you get to do whatever you want, but it doesn't get to do whatever it wants.
BUTTERS
Wait. The mummy talked to you, too?
MR. MACKEY
Yeah, yeah, we had a good talk, yeah.
BUTTERS
Why is it talking to everyone?!
MR. MACKEY
I think the mummy is very insightful and cares about you a lot.
BUTTERS
No it doesn't! This is crazy!
MR. MACKEY
Look, the mummy's just sad because you get to go to school and have fun, and what does the mummy get to do? You know, it just sits around being a mummy. You know, that's not fair.
BUTTERS
First of all, I don't have fun at school! And secondly... the mummy can do whatever it wants; I don't care!
MR. MACKEY
Right, but you do care, Butters, because you're sitting in my office talking all about the bad things that the mummy does.
[Tegridy Farms, day. Randy sits in his wooden swing and looks at one of the tickets he had made for his Halloween Special weed. He sighs.]
TOWELIE
[appears in the yard behind him] Randy, quick! You gotta come see!
RANDY
I just need some time, okay, Towelie?
TOWELIE
Look! You don't understand! The special! Well, it's a miracle! [leaves. Randy gets up to follow him] Come on! You're not gonna believe it! [they head for the barn]
[The barn. They step inside]
RANDY
Alright, Towelie, what is this ab-? Whoa! [the Halloween Special has overgrown and taken root all over the barn] The Halloween Special!
TOWELIE
Whatever your daughter threw on this shit made it more powerful than ever!
RANDY
[jumps for joy] Yeah! We're back!
TOWELIE
Yeah!
RANDY
Yeah! Yeah!
[A restaurant, day. Butters is enjoying drinks with the main four and Tolkien.]
BUTTERS
I have to end this curse, fellas. It's getting worse every day. Last night the mummy attacked my parents, and it said I was being narcissistic. It has no reason. No logic! One minute it's destroying everything, and the next it's sending me selfies like nothing ever happened. Look! [sure enough, there are several selfies of the mummy - in a park, in bed, working out - on his phone] This whole thing is so crazy it's starting to make me think I'm crazy!
STAN
Well, it is a little crazy how much you talk about the mummy.
BUTTERS
[jaw drops, then] It's a freaking mummy! Wouldn't you talk about it?!
KYLE
We're just saying, Butters, that sometimes it all seems a little codependent.
CARTMAN
Yeah, like you and the mummy need to do your own things sometimes.
BUTTERS
I would love that, but I don't have a choice! I swear, you guys. Mummies can smell fun! Whenever I'm somewhere, and I actually start havin' a good time, I get a call or a text from the mummy sayin' "Hey, what are you doin'?" Like it knows.
TOLKIEN
Well, you're kinda havin' fun now, aren't you?
BUTTERS
Yeah. It is fun to get away and just talk to you guys. [the mummy pops up outside their window and throws its arms at it three times. The boys are spooked for a bit, then calm down] Oh, gosh darnit. [leaves the table] Hang on a second, fellas. [the mummy's eyes follow him]
[Tegridy Farms, day. Randy is putting new labels on jars of Tegridy Weed and humming, then placing them on a table by the front door]
RANDY
Okay, that should be enough Halloween Special for the first few people [there are some 84 jars on the table] Now, I think we should put the open bar in this area [screen left] and the hot tub maybe right here [screen right. Shelly walks in wearing a backpack].
TOWELIE
Yeah, that'll work well.
SHELLY
Dad, you have to drive me to the book fair.
RANDY
What what? [chuckles]
SHELLY
Mom said you have to drive me because she's taking Stan trick-or-treating.
RANDY
[skeptical] You're going to a book fair?
SHELLY
Yes.
RANDY
On fucking Halloweed?
SHELLY
Yes!
RANDY
[squeezes his face] I don't even know how to deal with you anymore. [gets in her face] You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?!
SHELLY
[moves to the front door] You're my dad, drive me to the book fair!
RANDY
I will not! I have things to get ready, and nobody cares about books on Halloween, Shelly!
SHELLY
The last thing people in this town need is more marijuana! [kicks the legs out from under the table, and the jats crash onto the floor, shattering. She leaves]
RANDY
OH MY GOD! [kneels next to his ruined product]
[Park County Police Station. Randy is talking to Det. Harris, with Shelly beside him]
RANDY
[sobbing] It's a nightmare! It's a personal hell! I've done everything I can, as a father, to help he with her problem, but she just ignores everything I say! I can't do this!
SHELLY
You're such a piece of shit, Dad!
RANDY
Oh, Shelly, I love you!
DET. HARRIS
What does her mother have to say about this?
RANDY
Her mother doesn't say anything anymore! Whenever I bring up our daughter's marijuana problem, my wife says "I'm gonna lose my mind if you bring this up again." It's destroying all of us! I just think, maybe a night in jail is the wakeup call that she needs. I'm barely gonna have fun at the Halloween Special now! It's gonna be really hard for me to rage knowing you're in here, Shelly. It's gonna be really hard for me to rage! [an officer takes Shelly to a jail cell nearby, then opens it for her]
OFFICER BROWN
Alright, there you go. [Shelly goes in and turns around] When you have a problem with drugs and alcohol, you hurt everyone around you. Happy Halloween. [slides the door shut]
BUTTERS
What are you in for? I'm in here because *apparently* I'm a passive-aggressive controlling and manipulative psychopath whose narcissitic behavior drives other people crazy.
[Tegridy Farms, night. The Halloween special is undreway. Klieg lights shine their beams into the sky. MC Hammer's "Turn This Mutha Out" pumps through the loudspeakers. The living room is filing with people]
GUEST 1
Hey, trick or treat. We're here for the Halloween Special?
TOWELIE
All right, here you go, guys. [hands him a jar of Halloween Special] That's a promotional gift from Tegridy Farms.
RANDY
Hey, come on in, guys! There's candy and hot dogs!
GUEST 2
Alright. [Towelie hands him a jar as well]
RANDY
Samplers of the special are there on the table, guys. Feel free to light up!
TOWELIE
Wow, we're almost out, Randy. I gotta go to the barn and get some more.
RANDY
Okay, I'll hold down the fort. [Towelie leaves]
[Tegridy Farms, outside. Towelie walks through the field to the barn]
TOWELIE
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care. Jimmy crack- [stops] Uh, what? [a bright light shines through all the windows on the barn as the Halloween Special has spread to the exterior walls of the barn]
[Park County Police Station, night]
BUTTERS
So I said, "Okay, fine. You don't ever do anything wrong! It's all me! You've got no problems, only I have problems! Alright, uh I'll lock my own ass up! Then we'll see who's got issues!"
SHELLY
Will you SHUT UP?
BUTTERS
I'll be in here, and something will go horribly wrong tonight, and then the monster will have to accept what it is, and finally work on changing, right?
SHELLY
Probably not.
[Tegridy Farms, the Halloween Special event. Randy is talking to one of the guests in the hot tub]
RANDY
Naw, you see, fluvial geomorphology deals with the way rivers change over time. It's geology shit. It's why I got out of it, really.
GUEST 2
Hey man, what's in this weed? [guests around him are clutching their bellies]
RANDY
Oh! That's a company secret, my friend!
GUEST 1
No, I meant I- I don't feel so good. [begins to gargle and growl]
RANDY
Hey, are you alright there, buddy? [marijuana seems to sprout on the guest's body and turned him into a zombie. He turns around and growls at Randy] Whoa, dude, did you see that?! [looks over at his guest, who now, too, looks zombified. Randy jumps out of the hot tub when he notices all his guests looking like zombies, puts on a towel and runs outside]
[The marijuana field. Randy and Towelie run into each other]
BOTH
AAAAA!
RANDY
Towelie! There's something wrong with thte special!
TOWELIE
There's somethin' in the barn! The thing you killed! It wants revenge! [they head for the barn, and Randy sees it glowing like Towelie did before]
RANDY
Oh Jesus! What happened?! [goes inside while Towelie waits outside]
TOWELIE
It's dead because o'you! And now it wants your soul!
RANDY
[faces him] What?! What's dead because o'me?! [a shadow rises up and Randy notices: it's Winnie the Pooh clutching his intestines]
POOH
[cocks his head to one side] Oh, hello there. Would you like to die?
RANDY
[runs out] Ooooohh! Winnie the Pooh! Winnie the Pooh!
[Park County Police Station, night. An officer runs in]
OFFICER BROWN
Detective Harris! Something's going down at the Marsh farm!
OFFICER
Calm down, sir! I can't understand you!
DET. HARRIS
Put him on speaker. [the officer switches from earpiece to speaker]
RANDY
There's monsters everywhere! It's some kind of curse! Unspeakable evil!
BUTTERS
[listening from his cell] The mummy! I told you!
RANDY
All different kindds of monsters! Zombies and plant people and bears! Oh my God! What's that?! Oh my God, it's Harvey Weinstein! He's got me! You've got to-argh! He's inside me! Harvey Weinstein is inside me! You've gotta send help! People are dying everywhere! No! Harvey, I said no! Please, somebody co- [the connection is cut]
DET. HARRIS
This is it, everyone! Let's move! All hands on deck! We've gotta take these monsters down! [all the officers rush out. Yakes returns]/i> Bring the kid who manipulates the mummy with his passive-aggressive serlfishness! [an officer opens the jail cell, and Butters and Shelly walk out]
[Tegridy Farms, night. The Special event is still in full swing as the police pull up to the entrance. The officers leave their cruisers and jump into position with their rifles. An officer brings out a bazooka]
DET. HARRIS
Alright, men, let's take thee monsters out!
SHELLY
[intervenes] No, just hold on a second! I'll take care of this. [walks to the house. Meanwhile, out back, Randy and Towelie are still running, but are stopped by the cose they slaughtered in "Let Them Eat Goo."]
RANDY
Oh God, it's the cows we killed!
POOH
Oh. I'm really going to enjoy eating your brains. [leaps up to Randy's head and starts gnawing on it.]
RANDY
Get 'im off of me! Get 'im off of me! Oh my God! Get 'im off of me! [In her bedroom, Shelly is cooking up an antidote. She hears Randy and Towelie screaming and goes to look out the window] Waugh! Get 'im off of me!
BOTH
Help! Somebody help us! Get them off of me! Waugh! [she sees them flailing about, but with no cows, bears, or other monsters around them. They are hallucinating]
BOTH
Somebody help us!
TOWELIE
Somebody help us!
RANDY
Get 'im off of me! Augh! We gotta fight them, Towelie!
TOWELIE
Help! somebody help us!
RANDY
Waugh!
TOWELIE
I wanna live! Get them of of me! Help! sombody help us!
RANDY
We're going to live! We're going to live! [Shelly goes back to her pot and continues brewing] Help! Waugh, get him off of me! Get him off of me! You monsters! Go back to hell! [they begin to babble, and Randy punches the air] There's too many of 'em! [looks off to his left] Oh! What is, What is that?! [a blurry Shelly runs up to him with her pot] Oh! No! [she drenches him with her potion and he goes limp. He murmurs a fewwwww syllables and falls over]
[Tebridy Farms, entrance.]
DET. HARRIS
Alright, that's it everyone! Nothin' to see here. Just some people who are really, really high.
OFFICERS
[let down] Aawwwwwwww.
OFFICER STEVENS
I can't shoot anyone?
DET. HARRIS
[walks up to Butters] You were so convinced the mummy was to blame for everything, weren't you? So convinced you made us all believe it too.
BUTTERS
I'm... [cups his hands together] I'm sorry?
DET. HARRIS
Yeah, well it's not us ...you really need to be sorry to. [looks over Butters' head at something. Butters follows his gaze amd sees tje mummy standing at the farm's entrance.] Let's see if you even have a shred of decency to apologize when something is clearly your fault. [Butters walks to the mummy]
BUTTERS
I'm so sorry. You're right. I can be selfish and narcissistic. Ah I'm gonna work on myself and... and try to make this curse work somehow. [the mummy rreaches into a back pocket and gives Butters a parting present, sighs, and walks over to a red car, opens the trunk, packs his suitcase, closes the trunk, gets into the driver's seat, puts on some sunglasses, and drives away. Butters open the present and reads the letter inside, which is just Egyptian hieroglyphics]
OFFICER BROWN
[looks over Butters' shoulder] It says, "I hope you can get the help you need. I can't fix you"
[Tegridy Farms, day. All the decorations are thrown away and lots of trash bins wait for pickup. Inside, Randy comes down the stairs looking quite beat up. The rest of the family is eating toast and cereal.]
RANDY
Hey, guess I slept in late, huh? What time is it? [serves himself some coffee]
SHARON
It's 8:15 am. November 3rd.
RANDY
Ooof, wow. That was some strong-ass Halloween Special, y'all. I mean... I saw rapists in the hot tub, zombie cows. I thought I was gonna die, and then, this fat, bitchy angel came and put me to bed. [Shelly shoots a look at him for a few seconds, then looks at her food] Did everyone enjoy the Halloween Special?
SHARON
No, Randy. Only you did.
RANDY
Oh. Well, that was pretty much my target audience anyway. [walks away from the table with his coffee, back to the stairs] Hey, at least I really didn't have butt sex with Harvey Weinstein, huh? [sees something on the floor] Oh [it's a used confom. He picks it up and shows it to the family] Or did I? [twirls it around a few times] Woo! Happy Halloween, everybody! [lets go, and the condom lands on a wall, releasing its contents.]
End of Tegridy Farms Halloween Special


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The Mayor has evidence that Randy blew up his neighbor’s yards in protest over homegrown weed and then blamed it on a Mexican Joker. Now the citizens of South Park have had enough of Randy and Tegridy Farms and they just want to lock him up.

script:Season Finale

RANDY
Hey, good morning, everybody. Welcome to Tegridy Breakfast, the show where we talk about everything Tegridy Farms. I'm Randy Marsh.
TOWELIE
Hehehey, folks. I'm Towelie.
RANDY
Today we're gonna talk about what's been growing on the farm, especially our new Tegridy Thanksgiving Special. [displays the new strain in a mason jar]
TOWELIE
I'll tell you what. I-I, I smoked that out of a four-foot bong, and it just about destroyed my fro-
AGENT
[coming in with another agent and two police officers] Alright, wrap it up! Shut this down! Come on, Marsh, Let's go.
RANDY
Guh, uh go where?
AGENT
Everyone's had enough, Mr. Marsh. I'm gonna need you to come with us. [an officer steps forth to arrest him]
RANDY
[stands, to be arrested] What the hell are you do-? [remembers his show] Sorry, everybody. We'll be right back.
OFFICER 1
Let's go!
[Tegridy Farms, day, outside]
RANDY
What do you think you're-? My show! My Tegridy Farms show!
[City Hall, later. The City Council is in session. The officer brings Randy in, handcuffed]
RANDY
Hello, Mayor. Mr. and Mrs. Tweek, ... Mackey.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Mr. Marsh, do you remember a few weeks ago when homes in South Park were attacked by a terrorist called Mexican Joker?
RANDY
Yah, Mexican Joker. That was terrible.
MAYOR
Right. Except there was no Mexican Joker. It was you who blew up people's yards because they were home-growing their own marijuana.
RANDY
[bites his lip, then chuckles] Well, that's ridiculous.
MAYOR
The Tweeks have come forward with some footage caught on their security camera.
RANDY
Guys, I have nothing against homegrowers.
MAYOR
Run the footage, please! [her aide starts up the video. Randy is shown creeping up to a homegrown operation and pissing into it.]
RANDY
Hm... [the footage shown him getting deeper into the small garden and pooping in it] Hmmm... [then it shows him burying an explosive and walking away. Two seconds later there's an explosion and the camera footage is interrupted.]
MAYOR
People are fed up, Marsh. The past few weeks you've held parades for yourself, needlessly slaughtered a thousand cows, made deals with the Chinese, and nearly poisoned everyone with your Halloween Special. Everyone's had enough of Tegridy Farms.
RANDY
Enough of Tegridy Farms? South Park is NOTHING without Tegridy Farms!
MAYOR
You'll be taken to county jail to await your trial. Get him out of here. [an attending officer comes in to do the job]
RANDY
I didn't do anything wrong! [the officer pulls Randy up to his feet and walks him away] You people are just jealous! Jealous that I took over South Park and I'm successful! [the officer takes Randy out of the office]
MAYOR
Well. At least now South Park can start getting back to normal.
[The neighborhood park, day. Two teams of six players each oppose each other in a game of football. Kenny has the ball and Cartman is set to receive it.]
CARTMAN
Titty farts! Titty farts dog wiener. [backs away] Dog wiener, dog wiener! [gets back into position] Pubic mound. Pubic mound.
KYLE
Just hike the stupid ball, Cartman.
CARTMAN
Pubic mound titty farts hike! [receives the ball from Kenny. Kyle counts down 15 seconds before Cartman throws the ball.]
KYLE
Mississippi one Mississippi two Mississippi three Mississippi four Mississippi five Mississippi six Mississippi seven Mississippi eight Mississippi nine Mississippi ten Mississippi eleven Mississippi twelve Mississippi thirteen Mississippi fourteen Mississippi.
JASON
[while Kyle counts] Dude, I'm open!
CARTMAN
[while Kyle counts] You can't catch!
JASON
[while Kyle counts] Dude, I'm wide open! [Cartman releases the ball, and it goes high. Jason goes into the street to catch it, but is struck down by a police car and killed. The officer doesn't stop. The ball comes down next to Jason two seconds later. Most of the boys are aghast]
CARTMAN
That totally would have been a touchdown.
[The Church, day. Funeral music plays. Mrs. White is heard crying. Jason's casket and picture are shown]
FR. MAXI
Little Jason White was a happy child. A playful child. And ultimately it was his playfulness in sports that got him killed in a freak hit-and-run accident. The father would like to now say a few words. [leaves the podium and gives Bob a quick hug as Bob takes the podium.]
BOB
I'm Robert White, Jason's father, and I can tell you that as a White, Jason lived a challenged life. When I look out on this congregation, I can't help but think, "There's not a whole lot of people here." Doesn't seem like a big deal. Nobody's outraged. 'Cause it was our family. Nobody cares when a White gets killed by the police. There should be protests and marches, but NO. The police killed a White! That's not protest-worthy! Everybody's busy trying to lock up Randy Marsh! Now my wife and I have a dead child and we can't even get any weed to make us feel better! Yeah, don't listen to me. I'm just a White. [leaves the podium. His wife is still crying.]
[Tegridy Farms, day. Sharon is at the dinner table addressing her kids]
SHARON
Kids, I have something to tell you, but I don't want you to be scared, okay? Daddy is... in police custody until there's a hearing. He could be in jail for a long time.
SHELLY
Do you promise?
STAN
Like, how long is "a long time"? Could it be years?
SHARON
It could be, sweetheart. We don't know.
STAN
YES!
SHELLY
Is it possible he could get out of it?
SHARON
Of course it's possible, honey
SHELLY
Egh! [looks away angrily]
STAN
But if he doesn't get out of it, then what happens to us?
SHARON
We probably have to sell the farm and move, back to town, and, sort of, live our lives without the marijuana business and without daddy. [a smile keeps breaking through as she explains things] Juts... try to stay hopeful, kids.
STAN
We will, Mom. You too.
SHARON
Okay, you too, Shelly.
SHELLY
Okay, Mom. You too.
[The White House, day. President Garrison is in the Oval Office cracking nuts and eating them. The phone rings and he picks up.]
GARRISON
What? ...Who? ...Oh okay, sure, put him through. This is the President.
RANDY
Hi, Mr. Ga- Mr. President, Uh, I'm really sorry to bother you. Look, uh... I'm in a bit of trouble.
GARRISON
Huho, tell me about it.
RANDY
Yeah, they uh, someone got some supposed evidence on me doing something... "illegal" and uh.
GARRISON
Well, did you tell everyone you didn't do anything wrong?
RANDY
Y-yeah, of course.
GARRISON
Well, did you then go on the attack and swap the accusations to make yourself a victim?
RANDY
Did I what?
GARRISON
Oh Jeez, DARVO, Randy. Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. Alright, let's role-play. You be your accusers and I be you. Okay, go.
RANDY
Uh, uhm, "Hey, you! You blew up people's yards who were growing their own marijuana!"
GARRISON
"No I didn't! Are you joking, you psychopath?! Now you're blowin' up my yard!" Go ahead, try another one.
RANDY
"You, you illegally damaged property and made your business-"
GARRISON
"You damage property to make your business more profitable, you lying sack of shit! I'm not gonna be bullied by you!" See? [looks at footage of himself speaking on several screens] It's really not that hard, just takes a little chin wiggle.
RANDY
Jeez, you're really good at that. Look, what I really need from you is some personnel. Do you know any good lawyers?
GARRISON
Do I know any good lawyers? No, but I do know Rudy Giuliani. [at this point Rudy peaks out from under the desk.]
GIULIANI
Hehey hey, fuck you!
GARRISON
The fuck you, Rudy. Are you finished cleaning up those pistachio nuts yet?
GIULIANI
Yeah, that's all of them, Mr. President.
GARRISON
Listen, Randy, I'm gonna throw you a bone. You just sit tight and I'll have him take care of this.
[Tegridy farms, day. The Broflovskis ring the front door bell]
SHARON
Sheila, Gerald, hi.
SHEILA
Hi, Sharon. We just know you're going through a really hard time right now. We wanted to bring you guys some lasagna.
SHARON
Oh that's so sweet, thank you. Other families have brought some stuff too. Come on in. [Gerald and Sheila go in and find something of a party going on. Shelly is dancing on the sofa] Hey guys. We got lasagna. [Stan, Butters, and Cartman show up and run around her]
SHELLY
I love lasagnaaa.
SHARON
No running in the house, you little turkeys. [the boys run off, and Gerald and Sheila join her]
SHEILA
Oh, look at that, Sharon. You took down all the pictures of marijuana.
SHARON
Oh, yeah. You know, just too painful. You know, they remind me of Randy. That's why I took Randy's pictures as well, because, you know, they remind me of Randy.
LINDA BLACK
Look, I'm sorry if you don't want to talk about it, but have you thought of what you guys might do if Randy gets put away?
SHARON
Yeah, I've kind of made a list of all the things I might do. It's kind of a long list.
BOB
Oh, isn't this lovely? [The music scratches to a stop. He, his wife and their daughter are just inside] The whole town, turning out to support the Marsh family in their time of need. [looks of shock great them] Our son was killed by the police.
MRS. WHITE
[sobbing] Why?
BOB
Would have been nice if somebody had brought us some lasagna. You know, if I'm not mistaken, it almost seems like you people are happy that Tegridy Farms is being indicted. It's almost like you're reveling in it. My wife and I were both Tegridy Plus members! We always believed in Randy Marsh. We believed... in Tegridy. And now there's less Whites. Now there's less Whites. [they turn and leave]
BUTTERS
Oh Jeez. We should have never played football that close to the road.
CARTMAN
Yeah, this isn't right.
BUTTERS
Wu-where are you going, Eric?
CARTMAN
I think I might be able to help them. [follows the Whites out]
[Tegridy Farms, outside. The Whites are close to the entrance when Eric calls out to them]
CARTMAN
Mr. and Mrs. White! [The Whites stop and he catches up to them] I'm sorry about what happened. I knew Jason pretty well. He was a shitty receiver, but he would have wanted his parents to... move on. And help a new child.
MRS. WHITE
What? What do you mean?
CARTMAN
A few weeks ago, I was sent somewhere. It was a place where people like you could find a way to fill that empty hole.
[Texas detention center, day. An ICE bus pulls up and unloads its passengers, all parents seeking children to adopt]
JEFF
Welcome, everyone. My name is Jeff. We're thrilled you've come to help out and adopt. The parents of the children inside have all been deported, but the kids are legal citizens, since they were born in the United States. [he leads the group inside and down some hallways lined with kennels] Mr. and Mrs. White?
BOB
Yes?
JEFF
We've all heard about your tragic loss. I'd love to help out however I can. Is there something specific you're looking for?
MRS. WHITE
We... don't really know.
JEFF
Well, we've got all kinds here, depending on your preferences. [points out the various kinds of kids he has as they move down the hallway] Here's a little Panamanian. They're very clean. This is a Colombian shorthair. Oh, and this is a good one. This is a Baja shepherd.
BAJA SHEPHERD
Quiero a mi papá. Quiero a mi mamá. ["I want my dad. I want my mom."]
JEFF
Bien, gracias. ¿Y tú? ["Fine, thanks. And you?"]
BOB
Oh, honey. Look at the Peruvian hairless.
JEFF
Yes, they're pretty silly-looking. Great with kids though.
BOB
Hey, what's this little guy?
JEFF
Oh, why, this is a purebred Mexican. He's had all his shots; parents were deported two weeks ago. Here, we can let him run around a little bit. [opens the kennel to let the boy out]
MEXICAN
[steps out] Mi familia. ¿Dónde está? ["My family. Where is it?"]
JEFF
Bien, gracias. ¿Y tú? ["Fine, thanks. And you?"]
MRS. WHITE
Oh Bob, he's kind of perfect.
BOB
Hello, little fellow. How would you like to be a White? [the boy is dumbfounded]
[County Jail Infirmary at South Park, day. It has 8 beds, six of which are filled. Randy is in the one at far right. A doctor is checking out his ears]
RANDY
Look, doctor. You have to give me something. I'm really sick.
DOCTOR
What exactly are your symptoms?
RANDY
I'm like, starting to question things that I've done. Like, starting to question the person I've become. And I can't sleep at night I, I just lay in my cell wondering if I've been a bad father lately, and a bad husband, and... please, it really hurts. I need some marijuana.
DOCTOR
Sounds like you haven't had access to marijuana for a while, now reality is setting in.
RANDY
I just need a little medicinal weed and these symptoms will all go away.
DOCTOR
Well maybe they shouldn't go away. Maybe this is your wake-up call that you've been abusing drugs, and need to face all your wrongdoings, try to turn your life around.
RANDY
You need to turn your life around! Clearly you have the addiction problem and I'm just your whipping boy!
DOCTOR
That's not going to work, Mr. Marsh. You're not the President of the United States.
RANDY
Ahh, poop!
[The White house, evening. The Whites and their newly-adopted son are enjoying TV dinners in the living room. The boy studies them]
MRS. WHITE
Well Alejandro, how are you enjoying being a White so far?
ALEJANDRO
Mi familia. ¿Dónde está? ["My family. Where is it?"]
MRS. WHITE
Bien, gracias. ¿Y tú? ["Fine, thanks. And you?"]
BOB
Yes, it's good us Whites have each other, Alejandro, because... I need to tell you something. You see, now that you're a White, life isn't gonna be so easy. You're gonna find that a lot of people in this world just don't care about the Whites.
MRS. WHITE
You'll hear about how others in the world are mistreated, but nobody will care when you are.
CRYSTAL
Being a White is the hardest thing ever.
BOB
That's my little White. [the boy is using a phone all of a sudden. Bob notices something onscreen] Oh, turn it up, honey.
ANCHOR
And the President of the United States today called the allegations against Randy Marsh "total, buttfucking bullshit," and claims the neighbors who came forward with the evidence video are "tampon-faced, 69ing whistleblowers." When asked for clarification, the President's lawyer and treasonous pig Rudy Giuliani, had this to say.
GIULIANI
Ohhh, this is just a conspiracy. It's conspiracy! And we need everyone out there who, who don't think their voices are heard, to make their voices louder!
BOB
Uh, he's absolutely right. Starting tomorrow, the Whites are gonna start actively trying to stop all this trial nonsense.
MRS. WHITE
Bob, Alejandro's on your phone and it's past phone use time.
BOB
Hey! [snatches the phone from him.] Why, he's trying to call Mexico! Alejandro, the Whites do not use mobile devices after 7 pm.
MRS. WHITE
Why would he try to call long distance to Mexico? Does he just assume that the Whites have all the money in the world?
BOB
The Whites don't call long distance! [bops Alejandro on the head with the remote control]
MRS. WHITE
Jason never tried to use mobile devices after the cutoff time. Jason never tried to call long distance. [begins to cry and leaves the living room]
BOB
Well good job, Alejandro! Now you've upset your mother!
ALEJANDRO
¡Esa no es mi madre! ["That's not my mother!"]
BOB
Bien, gracias. ¿Y tú? ["Fine, thanks. And you?", Alejandro looks at him quizzically]
[County Prison Therapy Room. Two guards keep watch over eight inmates in this room. A Relationship graph is drawn on a whiteboard under the room's sign]
RANDY
I've had a lot of time to just sit in here and think. I'm starting to realize I have this pattern of behavior where I... always want more. More weed, more drinks, more deals with the Chinese. It's never enough. See, I've always had my flaws, but at the end of the day, I cared about people. You know what the President said? He said just deny everything and make yourself the victim. Yeah, well... maybe he's part of how I got here. Maybe the President has brought down my moral meter. I don't mean to cast blame - I'm to blame - but... ever since he was elected, I've compared my morals to his. And no matter how awful I am, I'm never as bad a the President, so I'm... okay.
[The Whites are in front of a market. Alejandro and Crystal carry bells in their hands, Bob has a clipboard, and his wife carries a sign: "STOP THIS RIDICULOUS PERSECUTION!"]
BOB
Help support Tegridy Farms and Randy Marsh! Randy Marsh has done nothing wrong! Stop the ridiculous persecution! [Alejandro is mad, so he doesn't ring his bell]
MRS. WHITE
Exonerate Tegridy Farms? [a woman walks into the store without stopping to contribute.] Oh yeah! Just ignore us! The Whites are used to it!
BOB
Good one, honey.
CRYSTAL
Daddy! Alejandro isn't ringing his bell!
BOB
Alejandro! There's few enough of us as it is! We're not gonna stop this trial unless all the Whites chip in! [takes the bell from Alejandro and rings it] Now ring your bell! [bops him on the head with it, rings it, and gives it back to him.]
ALEJANDRO
[throws his bell away] ¡No quiero estar aquí! ["I don't want to be here!"]
MRS. WHITE
It's like he doesn't appreciate us, Bob.
BOB
Oh, I know.
MRS. WHITE
I mean, we give him a place to live, food, we take care of him.
BOB
It just... [soft gasp] he just doesn't seem happy. Maybe if we got him a little thing to take care of and feed he'd understand how much responsibility it is.
[Texas detention center, day. The Whites are back at the detention center with Alejandro]
JEFF
We're so glad you came back, Mr. and Mrs. White. We have even more kids now whose parents have been deported.
BOB
See one you like, Alejandro? Now that you're a White, you can pick anyone you want.
JEFF
Oh, here's a good one. Four years old, parents just deported yesterday. He's a Panamanian podengo pequeño.
BOB
Do you like him, Alejandro?
JEFF
We could see how he gets along with the kids. [opens the kennel door and the boy walks out]
PANAMANIAN
Quiero a mi mamá. ["I want my mom."]
ALEJANDRO
Nunca la vas a ver. ["You won't see her again".]
MRS. WHITE
Oh look. I think he likes him.
BOB
Alright, Alejandro, but you have to take care of him and clean up after him.
MRS. WHITE
This is a great addition to our family.
BOB
Yeah. [in her ear] Now there will be more Whites to stop those needless hearings.
[South Park County Prison, Cell 13. Randy sits alone in this cell looking at a picture of his family.]
OFFICER PETERSON
Hey Marsh, you got a visitor.
RANDY
I do?
OFFICER PETERSON
[taking Randy to the visiting room] Fifteen minutes. That's all you get. [Randy goes in]
GIULIANI
Hello Mr. Marsh? My name is Mr. Giuliani. I've been sent to try and help you.
RANDY
Oh. Thanks, but I think I'm just gonna plead guilty.
GIULIANI
Oh, that sounds like someone who's a little down in the puss. The President said you would be, and he thought you might need a little something special. [proceeds to take down his pants and briefs] Ssshhhhhh. [reaches into his ass and pulls out a joint, then lights it] Would this make you feel better?
RANDY
Oh. Ohhh.
GIULIANI
[waves the joint around] Is this just what the doctor ordered?
RANDY
Yeahhh. [jumps forward and takes a long drag]
[Breaking News]
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing outside the government building where Randy Marsh is about to be arraigned. Protesters from both sides have gathered here. Some of them who are for the proceedings...
CROWD
Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
FIELD REPORTER
...and also those in support of ending the investigation.
THE WHITES
Let him go! Let him go!
MRS. WHITE
These hearings are a waste of the taxpayers' money!
BOB
Nothing in these hearings will change the Whites' minds one bit!
CRYSTAL
Daddy!
BOB
What?
CRYSTAL
Alejandro isn't putting on his sunscreen! [he's holding on to a bottle of it, though]
BOB
Alejandro, what have we told you?! All Whites wear sunscreen! Put it on right now! [takes the sunscreen and bops it on his head]
ALEJANDRO
¡Ahhh! ¡No necesito protector solar! ¡Necesito a mi madre y a mi padre! ["Ahhh. I don't need sunscreen! I need my mom and my dad!"]
BOB
¡BIEN, GRACIAS! ¡¿Y TÚ?! ["FINE, THANKS! AND YOU?!"] Now put it on! [opens the sunscreen and rubs it all over Alejandro's face, giving him the whiteface of a clown.]
ALEJANDRO
¡Alto! ¡Aah! ¡Alto! ¡Te odio! ¡Te odio! ["Stop! Aah! Stop! I hate you! I hate you!" He runs away]
[City Hall, day. The Mayor. The City Council of 13 is seated. Mr. Mackey isn't present, as he was protesting outside. The President and Mr. Giuliani are present, flanking Randy. A small crowd of people is witness to the arraignment]
MAYOR
In the South Park vs. Tegridy Farms matter, we are now ready to proceed with the arraignment. Before doing so, Mr. Marsh, do you have any words?
RANDY
Yeah, I have some words to say!
GIULIANI
Go get 'em! Go, go get 'em!
RANDY
I can't believe I'm being attacked here! You people are monsters! The evidence shows me in a yard taking a dump! Yes! Because I was setting a trap for Mexican Joker! [skeptical cries erupt from the crowd] That's right! And Mexican Joker attacked seconds later! I was trying to protect you people from terrorists! And what do I get for it?! I get a- a bunch of- [the President and Giuliani cheer him on silently] A bunch of... No... No, I can't do this. You wanna know what really happened? The President... sent me his lawyer, and his lawyer told me what to say to get off and gave me a joint in prison.
CROWD
[swelling] What??
RANDY
And then I smoked that joint! And you know what I thought?! I thought "this is some shitty-ass weed." It wasn't Tegridy. It barely even changed my mental state. The reason I got into the marijuana business was to make quality, simple weed that came from the heart. Weed that was strong, and pure. Somewhere on that journey I lost my way. Tegridy weed is about community. It's a sunrise. It's the smile on a baby. But most of all [reaches a chair and puts a foot up on it], Tegridy weed is about family. I had forgotten I have a loving wife, and son [Sharon, Stan, and Shelly are shown, Shelly with arms crossed], and I'm not gonna forget them anymore. [Shelly uncrosses her arms and puts her palms up] So I'm not gonna fight this. I'll do my time and... maybe someday I'll be back. Making marijuana that's simple. Marijuana that's Tegridy. Because, when you do the right thing, good things happen. [explosions are heard outside, and the people in chambers go to the windows to see what's going on. Sure enough, buildings are exploding all around town. Alejandro is vandalizing police cars with a bat]
MAN WITH ORANGE SHIRT
It's him! Oh god, it's him!
TOWNSWOMAN
Oh, Jesus, save us!
OFFICER 2
G-give it up, Mexican Joker. You don't wanna do this. [Alejandro smashes the cruiser some more, then brings out a Molotov cocktail.]
BOB
Alejandro! Get down from there this minute!
ALEJANDRO
¡Abajo con Estados Unidos! ["Down with the United States!" An officer fires a shot and injures Alejandro. Other cops fire away and cause a cloud of smoke to rise up and hide Alejandro. Alejandro seizes the opportunity to make his escape.]
[South Park City Hall, day. Randy and Rudy exit the double doors and approach the podium set up for a press conference]
REPORTERS
Mr. Marsh. Mr. Marsh. Mr. Marsh Marsh Marsh. Over here.
REPORTER
Mr. Marsh, how does it feel to be exonerated? [as soon as they reach the podium, Giuliani starts massaging Randy's shoulders]
RANDY
Thank you. It feels really good to have these charges dropped. Now we can all get back to the business of trying to heal. I'd like to... [notice Giuliani massaging his shoulders] Would you please get the fuck away from me? [Giuliani lets go, adjusts his dentures, and puts his thumbs up in approval] I'd like to take this opportunity to thank those who have always been by my side, supporting me from the very beginning, the people who stood by me since day one and gave me hope. The Whites. [he and Giuliani clap. The Whites look surprised, then they put their hands to their chests.] Thanks for having my back, Mr. and Mrs. White. And now, everybody, if you don't mind, I've got a farm to tend to. [waves to everybody as he leaves]
[Tegridy Farms, day. Winter has come, and snow is falling everywhere. The marijuana plants have been harvested and cut back. Inside, Randy brings a box containing six jars of Tegridy weed to the table. Shelly is suffering a personal hell being around marijuana, so she has buried her face in her arms]
RANDY
Well gang, I guess that's about it, huh? It's been a really good run, but, looks like the season is over.
SHELLY
[perks up] The season is over?
RANDY
Well sure, the first snow is falling, crops are pretty much dead. Well what'd you all think, huh? I think the season was a little better than anyone expected. I really wanna thank you guys for a great run. [walks to a camera off to his left] And hey, we hope you all enjoyed the season too. It had a little bit of everything, didn't it? And hopefully, the season finale really brought it all home. Of course, if you haven't had a chance to try the season finale yet, it is available now for a special price. This limited-edition weed made from the very last crop of the season is pricey, but worth it. [cuts to the live-action shot of a guy's hand putting the jar of Season Finale next to the five other jars of episode-titled weed.]
ANNOUNCER
Now taking pre-orders for Season 2.
End of Season Finale

synopsis:The Annual Strong Woman Competition pushes everyone to their limits. An even stronger woman causes big problems for PC Principal. Cartman, Stan, and the rest of the boys meet their match when some of the girls join their board gamers club.

script:Board Girls

[This episode starts with the PC Babies Theme Song
PC Babies, they're coming to your town!
PC Babies, the wokest kids around.
When there's something problematic, they're sure to let you know.
Making things fun and gender-neutral everywhere they go!
They're everybody's fave-sies!
They're PC Babies, yeah!]
PC GIRL
Now back to PC Babies.
PC BOY
Waaa! [giggles]
[The Principal House, basement, day. Strong Woman is using a heavy Everblast punching bag with PC Principal holding it in place.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Yeah! Who's strong?
STRONG WOMAN
I'm strong!
PC PRINCIPAL
Who's Strong Woman?
STRONG WOMAN
I'm Strong Woman! [they switch to dumbbells]
PC PRINCIPAL
You're gonna smoke the competition!
STRONG WOMAN
I'm gonna smoke the competition! [the babies begin to cry] Oh no. It's the babies.
[The living room, moments later. PC Principal and Strong Woman reach the living room and find the kids upset. Two of the kids sit on the sofa, the other three on the floor.]
PC PRINCIPAL
Kids, kids. Okay, what the matter?
STRONG WOMAN
Oh, no! I left Disney+ on and it went to Mulan.
PC PRINCIPAL
They don't like Mulan?
STRONG WOMAN
No, because Mulan is a female that identifies as male and yet the movie doesn't take the time to address real trans issues.
PC PRINCIPAL
Okay, okay, we know! [takes the remote and turns the TV off] Mulan is outdated in creating straw dog characters to talk about trans issues! Daddy's turning it off! [switches to another channel]
ANDERSON COOPER
-But just how many advocates have yet to be seen? [the kids sit up and smile.]
[South Park Elementary Gym, day. PC Principal holds another assembly. Mr. Mackey, Strong Woman, and Mr. Adler sit far behind him]
PC PRINCIPAL
Alright everybody, listen up! As you know, this school is a place where everyone should feel included. Our challenge is to motivate ourselves and others to create an inviting, non-negative and HEY STOTCH, YOU GOT A FUCKING PROBLEM?! [Butters is caught whispering something to Scott]
BUTTERS
[quickly sits correctly] No sir!
PC PRINCIPAL
Now I think that what we all need are leaders who motivate by example, and so I would like to inform you all that your vice-principal [points to Strong Woman; she's somewhat surprised] is competing in the Strong Woman Competition in Morrison this weekend. Let's hear it for her. [the kids applaud as she takes the mic]
STRONG WOMAN
Well, thank you PC Principal. Um, listen, guys. I just hope I can make you proud, and more importantly, I hope you can see that no matter who you are, you can do anything. We've really come a long way breaking down gender-binary bigotry, and I hope I can especially inspire some of my girl students here.
PC PRINCIPAL
Or those who identify as girls.
STRONG WOMAN
Yes, or those who identify as girls. Get out there and get involved in school sports and clubs. If there's something you love, don't ever let anything hold you back.
[Five boys are in the room: Clyde, Butters, Cartman, Scott, and Stan. They're playing Dungeons and Dragons]
CARTMAN
The first bugbear lashes out at Stan with its broadsword. [rolls the dice] And it hits with a 17.
STAN
How much damage is that?
CARTMAN
4 + 2 slashing
BUTTERS
Okay. I jump up to the bugbear! And I yell "FOR WATERDEEP!" and I kick it in the balls!
CARTMAN
I don't think bugbears have balls.
CLYDE
Then how do they make baby bugbears? [the door opens and Mr. Mackey brings in two girls]
MR. MACKEY
Oh hi, boys. Uh we got some new students who want to be part of the gaming club. You know Tammy and Nichole.
CARTMAN
Ah huh, ah, heh heh neh no.
MR. MACKEY
This is a school club, boys. All clubs are inclusive. Have fun, girls. [the girls take their seats in the two remaining chairs and bring out their pieces.]
NICHOLE
Hey guys. [the other boys look at Cartman, who raises an eyebrow]
SCOTT
[whispers] What the fuck do we do?
CARTMAN
Um, guys, we play lots of games here at Dice Studz, but today [puts his hand on the cardboard sheet] we're playing D&D. You don't just show up and start playing, you have to generate characters and-
TAMMY
Yeah, we created some this morning. I'm a human paladin and Nichole is a Tiefling warlock. [another long silence]
CLYDE
[whispers] Do something, Eric!
CARTMAN
Eheh, ha, guys, um, they're fighting a bunch of bugbears now that are led by a 12th level druid...
NICHOLE
Okay, I cast Vampiric Touch on the druid. [rolls her dice] Crit. [the boys look at Cartman]
[The 6th Annual Strong Woman Competition]
DAVID
A beautiful morning in Morrison, Colorado as we get ready for the 6th Annual Strong Woman Competition, a two-day long competition of tests built to push athletes to their very limits. [crowd reactions are shown. Lots of clapping and cheers] Joining me now is the current champion of the Strong Woman Competition, Strong Woman. [edges up to her] Ms. Woman, do you feel ready?
STRONG WOMAN
Oh yeah. I'm ready, David. There are just so many amazing women athletes out here today it makes me so proud.
DAVID
Now, this is the first year that a trans woman is in the competition. How do you feel about that?
STRONG WOMAN
Amazing. I feel honored to be a part of history. I have a lot of incredible trans friends who are athletes, and so we're all inspired this woman is competing.
DAVID
Uh huh, and uh have you ever actually met Heather Swanson?
STRONG WOMAN
Uh, no, I've never competed against her before, no.
DAVID
She's not exactly your average trans athlete.
STRONG WOMAN
Well, what is an "average trans athlete"? Honestly, I find that kind of bigoted, David.
DAVID
Okay, Heather Swanson is actually joining us now. Ms. Swanson, how does it feel to be competing today? [Strong Woman looks up at Heather with awe]
HEATHER
[joins the duo on camera] I can't tell you how free I feel now that I've started identifying as a woman. [adjusts her glasses] Now that I can compete as female, I'm ready to smash the other girls.
DAVID
And is it correct you just started identifying as female two weeks ago?
HEATHER
I'm not here to talk about my transition! I'm here to kick some fuckin' ass! Let me tell you something, dingleberry!
DAVID
David Perry!
HEATHER
I'm gonna roll up the other women here, and I'm gonna smoke 'em! I am the strongest woman this state has ever seen! [starts posing]
DAVID
Any words for the challenger, Ms. Woman?
STRONG WOMAN
Uh, good luck, Heather.
HEATHER
Huh huh, luck is for dudes. [walks off]
DAVID
Well, with that let's get right to the action.
[Scenes of athletes working out and crowd reactions are shown. Strong Woman does a clean and jerk of some 550 lbs. PC Principal and the babies cheer her on. Heather steps up and does a clean and jerk of 850 lbs. Next, Strong Woman defeats a challenger in boxing, then competes in the shot put with Heather and another woman, then defeats another challenger in arm wrestling. Heather defeats her challenger in the same event. In tire-flipping, Heather defeats her challengers easily. PC Principal and the babies are dismayed at the beating Strong Woman is taking. Strong Woman defeats her challenger in wrestling. Heather defeats her challenger in boxing. At the Dice Studz Gamers Club, Tammy and Nichole are beating the boys at the samurai game, Rising Sun. Another shot of PC Principal and the babies being dismayed. Strong Woman and Heather compete with each other in a tug of war, and Heather defeats her soundly. at the awards podium, Strong Woman poses and shames the runners-up. This song plays throughout.
Rising to the top, push it to the edge,
Give it all you got. Barely break a sweat. Strong Woman. Strong Woman. Go!
Yeah, she's got speed, she's got the moves,
She's got the muscle and a whole lot to prove, Strong Woman. Strong Woman.
Hey you! Go, Strong Woman, Go!
Hey you! Your time is now, what'cha gonna do?
Pedal to the metal, find another gear.
She takes what she wants, nothing left to fear, Strong Woman. Strong Woman.
Now hey, girl! You're the best in the world!
And hey, hon! Don't look now, but you've just won.
Strong Woman. Strong Woman. Strong Woman. Strong Woman. Strong Woman. Strong Woman. Strong Woman.]
HEATHER
[during the shot put] Arrrgh-yeahhhh! [at the awards podium] Hell yeah! I won! I'm a strong woman! Look at it! It's mine! I'm the best! I'm the strongest!
[On the ride home, Strong Woman looks beat. No one says a word until...]
PC PRINCIPAL
So, second place. That's pretty damn good.
STRONG WOMAN
Yeah...
PC PRINCIPAL
I guess she... just started identifying as a woman a few weeks ago. Doesn't really seem.., fair...
STRONG WOMAN
Just don't! You'll upset the PC babies.
[The Counselor's Office. Mr. Mackey listens half-heartedly as Cartman lays out his complaints.]
CARTMAN
[flanked by Butters and Scott] It is unfair, it is tyrannous, and it is wrong! Ever since these girls were allowed to join Dice Studz Gamers Club, it has been a train wreck! Every single game, they like, figure out all the rules, and they, use the rules, to like, make us look stupid!
BUTTERS
In D&D they killed the dungeon master. [points to Cartman] Well we didn't even think it was possible to kill the dungeon master.
CARTMAN
Shut up, Butters. It's not possible. It's just that we play board games for the themes. We want to be pirates, or Vikings. You know what the girls think about? They think about red cubes versus blue cubes, and how much of this equals how many victory points. They're just doing math.
MR. MACKEY
So they're smarter than you and beating you at all the board games.
SCOTT
Yeth.
CARTMAN
NO!
SCOTT
[frightened] NO!
CARTMAN
It's it's just, different. [starts tearing up] Look, we started Dice Studz with a dream. A dream that we could actually do something interesting at school, just for like 60 minutes. [Mr. Mackey galls asleep]
[The school cafeteria, day. The boys are eating tacos together]
CARTMAN
"Nothing we can do," he said. "Hands are tied," he said. We're gonna have to deal with this ourselves, you guys.
STAN
I think Nichole and Tammy are cool to play with.
CARTMAN
Well you won't think they're cool when the rest of us leave Dice Studz and you're left to play only solo board games!
STAN
You mean like Nemo's War? Nemo's War is sweet.
CLYDE
Look, maybe we just gotta play harder stuff, you know? Stuff the girls can't keep up with.
BUTTERS
Hey, that's not a bad idea. We've been taking it easy on the girls. Time to show 'em what real board gamers play.
SCOTT
What do real board gamers play?
STAN
Well if you want something hard, then you need a really crunchy Euro game, something like a Vital Lacerda's Escape Plan or a Uwe Rosenburg Euro.
CARTMAN
Do they involve math?
STAN
Well all Euros are pretty mathy.
CARTMAN
Nope, no good. We need something with lots of, like WAR and DICE and THEMATIC shit.
STAN
So then you want a war miniatures game. Something skirmish-style, like Legion or Blood and Plunder.
KYLE
Dude, you're really into board games.
CARTMAN
Alright, that's it, you guys. Dice Studz Gamers Club is about to go [fans his arms out over his lunch tray] tabletop miniatures.
[PC Principal's kitchen, day. He's at the stove while Strong Woman fives the PC babies.]
STRONG WOMAN
Emory, stop playing with your food. [the doorbell rings]
PC PRINCIPAL
I'll get it. [opens to front door and sees Heather]
HEATHER
Hey, what's going on? Is your girlfriend home?
PC PRINCIPAL
Uh, she's sort of busy right now, Ms. Swanson.
HEATHER
Just wanna tell her no hard feelings about me winning the Strong Woman competition. [holds up the trophy]
PC PRINCIPAL
Yeah, you already told her that at the competition.
HEATHER
You got a problem with me? 'Cause it's starting to seem like you have a problem with me!
STRONG WOMAN
What's going on-? Oh, hi Heather.
HEATHER
I was just stopping by to make sure you're not too beat up.
STRONG WOMAN
Oh, that's... really cool. I'm sorry, but I have all the kids right now, and they're-
HEATHER
Oh, where are the little kiddos? [enters the house] I'd love to meet 'em. [enters the kitchen] Oho hey kids. Whoa, there's a lot of you. Your mom must be a strong woman to take care of all o'you. Of course, I have the Strong Woman trophy though. Heheheheh. Just kidding, right?
PC PRINCIPAL
Look, why don't you just get out of here?!
HEATHER
Oh! Sounds like someone here is a transphobe.
PC PRINCIPAL
Don't you dare! I'm trans people's biggest supporter! What I think you are is a terrible sport!
HEATHER
Transphobe.
PC PRINCIPAL
You'd better knock it off!
STRONG WOMAN
Just don't. You're gonna upset the PC babies.
PC PRINCIPAL
And if you dare call me transphobe again, I'm gonna-
HEATHER
You're gonna what? Beat me up? You're gonna beat me up, transphobe? [PC Principal stands down] Yeah, I didn't think so. [to the babies]See you later, kids. Come on over and see old Auntie Heather if you want to see what a REAL strong woman is like. [leaves and goes out the front door. Strong Woman moves up next to PC Principal]
PC PRINCIPAL
Are you feeling what I'm feeling?
STRONG WOMAN
What do you mean?
PC PRINCIPAL
I don't know what it is, but... something about that woman just doesn't seem right.
[School Club Room, day. Tammy and Nichole bring a third girl with them]
EMORY
Now back to PC Babies.
NICHOLE
Hey guys. Hope it's cool we brought Kelly. She wants to be in the club too.
CARTMAN
[sarcastically] Oho yes! that's very cool, girls! We're just setting up today's game. It's a pirate miniatures game called Blood & Plunder. [the other boys smile]
NICHOLE
Yeah, we saw it on the schedule.
TAMMY
We love Blood And Plunder. Are we gonna play like a four-on-four skirmish with two different factions? [the boys' smiles vanish]
STAN
Whoa, you painted your miniatures?
TAMMY
Yeah. Who wants unpainted miniatures, right? [Cartman studies his unpainted miniature]
STAN
Where'd you learn to do that?
NICHOLE
We watch YouTube tutorials. You can find a much on BGG.
STAN
I love BGG.
KELLY
Oh cool. Do you watch Game Night?
CARTMAN
Excuse me! [pulls Blood & Plunder off the table and replaces it with a new game] We're going to play the six-hour long, very thematic Nemesis!
NICHOLE
Oh cool. We just watched the tutorial for that on Dice Tower. [the boys look at Cartman for his next move]
[A splash screen for Women In Sports appears on TV]
ANNOUNCER
And now, back to Women In Sports, with Janet Spears.
JANET
Our next guest has been really lighting it up in women's competitions. Since she's identified as female two weeks ago, she's won every female sport she's entered. Please welcome Heather Swanson. [Heather has brought every trophy she's won with her]
HEATHER
Well thank you, Janet. It's a great pleasure to be here. I know that I'm an inspiration to all women and trans athletes everywhere.
JANET
[dryly] Yes, we are all truly inspired.
HEATHER
Now there are some women out there who just want to run and hide. [stands up menacingly] I'm talkin' to you, Strong Woman! [A shot of the Principal family watching TV] You still dare call yourself that?! Your name is a joke, because ol' Heather Swanson here will beat you anywhere, anytime, at anything! [Strong Woman leaves the sofa and goes to the kitchen]
[The kitchen, moments later. Strong Woman is washing dishes when PC Principal enters]
PC PRINCIPAL
Hey, don't let her get to you, Strong.
STRONG WOMAN
She's not getting to me.
PC PRINCIPAL
I, I-I don't know why she has such a grudge against you, and I-
STRONG WOMAN
Because I know her.
PC PRINCIPAL
[jaw drops] What do you mean?
STRONG WOMAN
It's Blade Jaggart. He - she - is my ex-boyfriend.
PC PRINCIPAL
... What?
STRONG WOMAN
Back when we were together he was such an asshole. When I finally broke up with him, he said one day he was going to get me back. And now he's got us both by the balls.
PC PRINCIPAL
But then... she doesn't really care about trans people? Or women?
STRONG WOMAN
He hates wome- she, hates women. When I left him, he felt he got beat by a girl, and nothing makes Blade Jaggart more crazy than getting beat by a girl.
PC PRINCIPAL
I didn't even know people like that existed.
[The Colorado General Assembly, day. Cartman speaks to the Assembly and is joined by Butters and Scott, as before]
CARTMAN
[reading a prepared speech] It is unfair. It is tyrannous, and it is wrong. Dice Studz is a board game group that brings thrills and laughter to dozens of boys at our school. But that laughter is being turned into screams as girls constantly invade with their unfairness.
BUTTERS
[steps forward, interrupting] The girls found Eric on the first round of Fury of Dracula! [smiles. Cartman glares at him and he wilts and backs away.]
CARTMAN
[gets back to his speech] Yes, inclusion is wonderful, but we have to admit that boys and girls are simply different in some ways that can sometimes make competitions unfair. Have you ever seen how girls do their homework? They do it... that night, meticulously going over every detail and often finishing before they absolutely have to. This is how girls are with board game rule books. Before we even start playing, they've already strategized a way to win, leaving others in the dust.[puts away his speech] And now I'd like for you to hear from my friend Scott, who has diabetes.
SCOTT
[begins his own speech] My name is Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes.
CARTMAN
[whispers] Terminal diabetes.
SCOTT
[corrects himself] I have terminal diabetes. Board games are the only thing that give me relief from the physical and mental anguish I experience every day.
BUTTERS
Wow, Scott. I didn't know it was that bad.
SCOTT
Neither did I. [back to his speech] Dice Studz is my only shot at happiness. Please don't let outdated school policies destroy it. [steps aside]
CARTMAN
[claps and returns to the mic] Wow, thank you, Scott. Diabetes, everyone. [closing statement] We hope that our presentation has helped to change your minds about school clubs in our country. If not, we will be back, every single day. Please, let Dice Studz be for studs.
[An MMA sports show. Heather Swanson is one of the guests on it]
MMA HOST
Womens' MMA fighting is growing in popularity, and no other female fighter is as explosive as Heather Swanson.
HEATHER
Eee-yeahhh!
MMA HOST
Heather, your story is an inspiration to sports fans everywhere. Congratulation on your "shocking" success.
HEATHER
I just hope I can motivate little girls out there. Motivate them to understand that I will beat them at any sport they try. Motivate them to run away like that chicken shit Strong Woman did because I-
PC PRINCIPAL
[interrupts the interview] Alright. Alright, that's enough. You uh, you made your point, Heather. We get it, okay?
HEATHER
Oh hey, transphobe. This is a nice surprise.
STRONG WOMAN
Oh God, what is he doing?
PC PRINCIPAL
Look, everyone, I know we're all a little... afraid to have any opinions on this stuff, but um, there can be situations where it's... not so easy... to... what I mean is, I...
HEATHER
I didn't count on being the best since identifying as a woman.
PC PRINCIPAL
Yeah, no shit, 'cause you went through puberty as a male, so your body's completely different! [crowd reactions are shown, including one man motioning PC Principal to stop talking]
HEATHER
And that's exactly what a transphobe would say!
PC PRINCIPAL
I told you not to call me a transphobe! All I want is to have a discussion.
HEATHER
Transphobe! [PC Principal pushes Heather back, and Heather staggers back to a table of refreshments, throws herself on the table, and crushes it with her weight. She screams and sobs]
PC PRINCIPAL
Aw, shit.
[Dice Studz Gamers Club, day. The boys are back in the room. Only Cartman is content]
CARTMAN
Ahhh, isn't this nice, you guys? Clean, fresh air, soothing sounds, just us boys and Star Trek: Ascendancy."
BUTTERS
[rushing in] Uh hey, fellas! Come quick! You gotta see!
CLYDE
See what?
BUTTERS
Well, it's the girls! They started their own board game club at the school! [runs out. The other boys look at each other]
[The school cafeteria, day. The boys reach the new club's location. "Board Girls Gaming Club".]
CARTMAN
"Board Girls"? How lame is that? [opens the cafeteria door and is in shock]
[The scene shows the cafeteria full of girls playing different board games are shown. Allie, Monica, and another female 4th grader paint mini-figures. Some of the girls are also seen playing Lords of Waterdeep and Flick 'em Up!]
CARTMAN
The fuck is this?
STAN
Wow!
BUTTERS
[he and the other boys enter the cafeteria] Well this is like what you said Dice Studz would be, Eric.
NICHOLE
[walks in front of the boys] Oh, hey guys, welcome to Board Girls. Want to have a look around? [cuts to her leading a tour of the club] So over [points right of the screen] here we have our co-op games. I think they’re doing “Sub Terra” right now. [points right of the screen again] And there we do our deck and engine builders. Have you tried “Inuit”? It’s really cool. [stops walking] We have miniatures painting over there [points towards the screen] and most of our miniatures gaming happens in [points left of the screen] that area.
CLYDE
Hey, those girls are playing “Crisis Protocol”. That’s not even out yet.
NICHOLE
Yeah, we get advanced copies of games because our club reviews them for our gaming channel. [two girls discuss Abomination on camera]
MR. MACKEY
Hey boys, you need to get out, okay? No boys in the girls' school clubs. Come on, let's go.
STAN
What? Who says?
MR. MACKEY
New school policy came down from the top. Now get your asses outta there.
STAN
Well, who made up that stupid rule?
CARTMAN
... Yeah, who made up that stupid rule?
[The neighborhood park, day.]
EMORY
We now return to PC Babies.
[PC Principal sits on a park bench, alone. He looks at his phone's screen and sees a news article about his troubles with the trans community, then lowers his phone. Strong Woman finds him on the bench.]
STRONG WOMAN
Are you just... not gonna come home?
PETE
How am I gonna look my kids in the eyes, Strong? Since they were born, we've taught them to accept and fight for those who are marginalized. That there's no gray area when it comes to inclusion and acceptance. When I go back, all they're gonna see is a big, fat hypocrite. And now I've just used a word to shame people with weight issues. [buries his face in his hands]
STRONG WOMAN
P, you can't just shut down because you're afraid of how the babies are gonna react.
PETE
I didn't shove him - her - for being trans. I shoved her because she's your ex-boyfriend and she's being a dick. Do you think the PC babies will see the nuance?/But they're right, Strong. I shoved a trans person. No matter what, I have no right to judge her. Do you think- Could you try to explain it to the babies?
STRONG WOMAN
You know how they are. They're babies. Their minds are made up before anyone says anything.
PETE
Then I've really got only one thing I can do. I have to try and make things right with Heather Swanson.
[School gymnasium, day. PC Principal - Pete - holds another student assembly with Strong Woman]
STRONG WOMAN
Uh, hey students. As you know, we've had some issues here at the school that we're working very hard to correct. So today we are... honored... to have a motivational speaker. She is the current Strong Woman competition, and also the champion in women's MMA fighting, and in women's wrestling. Please welcome the inspiring Heather Swanson.
HEATHER SWANSON
[Bursts through a curtain] Yeeaahhhh! Fuck yeeaahhhh! [she dances to a K-pop song, "I Am the Best". She then proceeds to rip off her pants and show off her muscular body. She freezes in a pose when the song ends with "Oh my God." Butters is the only kid who claps]
HEATHER
Hello, boys and girls. I'm here to talk to you because apparently your school leaders have failed you. I'm gonna tell you something, kids. There's only one thing that matters in this world, and that's being the best. Your vice-principal teaches you girls to be strong, but she comes in second. [walks up to Pete and puts her left arm around him] You got anything to say about that, PC Principal?
PETE
No, Ms. Swanson.
HEATHER
"No, Ms. Swanson." [releases the hug and stands in front of them] You see, people don't look up to losers. They look up to champions! Every time I beat another woman, I feel better
CARTMAN
Dude, I really like this person.
HEATHER
And that's why I'm the best. Because Heather Swanson doesn't get beat. I work to be the best at everything. And Heather Swanson will beat any other woman any time, anywhere!
TAMMY
Bet you can't beat Nichole at Blood Rage.
HEATHER
What? Wha-what did you say, transphobe?
NICHOLE
Yeah, but I bet you can't beat Tammy at War of the Ring.
HEATHER
You don't disrespect a champion, little girls! You think Heather Swanson doesn't know board games?! I was playing board games before your mom even crapped you out of her vagina!
NICHOLE
Okay, so then let's do it, bitch!
HEATHER
Oh it's onnn!
[Board Girls Gaming Club, day. The girls compete against Heather and defeat her soundly. First up: Blood Rage. Heather makes her move; Nichole looks on passively and blows a gum bubble until it pops, then knocks off one of Heather's pieces. Heather is stunned. Next game is War of the Ring. Heather is frowning, but makes her move; Tammy is chatting away on the phone as she rolls the die and knocks off some of Heather's miniatures. Tammy sits back and smiles as the kids cheer her on. Next is Twilight Struggle. Nichole places her cards all over the map as Heather looks on in awe. After she places her last card, she rejoices in victory. Heather lifts her hands in gripping rage. Heather then participates in Board Girls Gaming Club, with Kelly tutoring her. Heather and Kelly then face each other and play. Next game is Concordia. Tammy again faces Heather and waits for Heather to finish her move. Then Tammy pulls off a series of card moves and defeats Heather. This song plays throughout the montage:
Tabletop bloodbath, nothing left to say.
Your moment is here, time to make 'em pay, Strong Woman. Strong Woman. Strong! Woman!
Smoke the competition, show 'em what you got.
All your painted miniatures are really paying off, Strong Woman. Strong Woman. Strong! Woman!
Hey wow! Who's the Strong woman now?
And hey you! Thought you were the best, but you're about to lose
To the Board Girls. They got the moves.
They pummeled you at Alchemists and kicked your ass in Carcasonne
Board Girls, they know all the rules.
They watch Rodney Smith, Tom Vasel, and Becca Scott.
Hey, cool. They made you look a fool
And hey, sweet, Take a step down; you just got beat
By the Board Girls!]
HEATHER
Do you think that's fair?! You only won 'cause you dumb girls memorized the rule books! When I play games, I just wanna be a pirate or a spaceman! [Cartman joins her]
CARTMAN
That's right! You and your stupid rules!
HEATHER
I may identify as a woman now, but I grew up a boy, so you have an unfair advantage over me!
CARTMAN
Yeah, an unfair advantage, stupid girls! Come on, Ms. Swanson. We can go make our own club. [they turn and walk out together. Once they're gone, the girls erupt in cheers]
[The Principal - er, Charles - house, day. Pete and Strong Woman get home and go inside.]
STRONG WOMAN
[before entering.] You sure you're ready for this?
PETE
I just wanna get it over with. [they enter, and the babies are happy to see them]
BABIES
Mommy! Yay!
STRONG WOMAN
Yes, kids, and look who else is here.
BABIES
[they look at him for a few seconds] Daddy! Yeah Daddy! Dada!
EMORY
Dada. I love you.
PETE
I... I don't understand.
STRONG WOMAN
They don't care. They must see the nuance to this whole situation.
PETE
You're right! They realize that raising a gender-based issue of strength doesn't necessarily make one a bigot or a bully. All this time we were worried what the PC babies would think.
STRONG WOMAN
And we didn't realize that our little babies are growing up. [they laugh and start to play with the babies.]
End of Board Girls


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Kyle and Ike are desperate to keep a lid on their mom’s medical condition. Kyle’s mom looks so good after her fecal transplant that everyone wants to get their hands on her goods. Cartman and the boys jump into the quest for the best microbiome.

script:Turd Burglars

[Park County Community Center, day. Inside, a meeting is being held featuring all the women of the town. On stage are Sharon Marsh, Strong Woman, Mayor McDaniels, Linda Stotch, Mrs. Testaburger, and a female police officer. Sheila is speaking at the podium.]
SHEILA
When I look out across this room, I see the backbone of our community. The women of this town need to stand together. [applause from the gathered women.] We're here, and we're proud, and it is time to let everyone know that the women of South Park should be treated the same as the men! [farts and begins to groan] Oh God! [farts and groans. Sharon, Strong Woman and the mayor cover their noses] Oh God! [she's helped off the stage by Mrs. Testaburger] Ohh, sorry. [vomits as she reaches the end of the table, getting some of it on Mrs. Testaburger's shirt]
MRS. TESTABURGER
Ohoho-kay. [they head for the entrance]
SHEILA
I'm alright. Oh... [starts having diarrhea, leaving a mess on her skirt and in the aisle. The audience is shocked and cover their noses]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Kyle is in the waiting room with Ike as their mom gets checked up.]
DR. GAUCHE
Hello boys. Your mommy has a bacterial infection called C. diff. It's very contagious.
KYLE
A bacterial infection? In her stomach?
DR. GAUCHE
[sits down and shows Kyle his tablet.] All of us have trillions of microscopic critters that grow on and inside our bodies. Just like your mom. [a 3D x-ray of an adult female appears on the tablet's screen] There's tiny creatures that live in your mom's skin, on her eyelashes, in her vagina. But the good bacteria in mommy's tummy are being overrun by bad bacteria. [a 3D rendering of the intestinal tract with both good and bad bacteria floating around]. We can't use antibiotics, because that will kill all the good bacteria too. [a line wipes down on the 3D rendering, showing all the bacteria has now disappeared]
KYLE
So what can you do for her?
DR. GAUCHE
We need to take a healthy person's microbiome and start to grow it inside your mother. [A 3D X-Ray is shown again, now with an image of poop in the corner] We do this with a fecal transplant. We'll get a donor's feces, mix it with water, and put it up your mom's anus. [the poop from the x-ray is shown moving up into the figure's rectum]
KYLE, IKE
Eeewww!
DR. GAUCHE
Your mom is tough, kids. We're gonna do the very best we can, kids. Try not to worry. [walks away]
KYLE
Ike, if Mom lives, we can't let anyone ever know about this.
[Food 4 Little, day. Upbeat music begins to play. Inside, Sheila is shopping with Ike. She grabs a bag of chips and puts it in the basket. She is dressed in workout clothing and begins to sing out loud]
SHEILA
I am shopping.
I'm grocery shopping.
I'm buying food for the people I love!
LAURA
Sheila?
SHEILA
[turns around] Oh, hi Laura.
LAURA
My goodness, look at you. Ah, I thought you were sick.
SHEILA
I was! But I had an amazing procedure.
IKE
[tugging on Sheila's sleeve] No no no no no no, Mommy, no no no no no no!
SHEILA
I had a fecal transplant.
IKE
Oh, god damnit! [buries his face in his hands]
MRS. BIGGLE
You had a what?
SHEILA
A fecal transplant. It's when they take the feces of a healthy donor and place it in your anus. I feel like a million dollars!
LINDA S.
[arrives] Sheila, is that you? I thought you were sick.
SHEILA
I was! But I had a fecal transplant.
IKE
[in despair] Aaaaah!
SHEILA
I'm telling you girls, it's solved every problem I've ever had. I've lost weight, I have more energy, I even think my arthritis is clearing up. [Ike takes the bag of chips and dumps it on the shopping store floor, then puts the bag over his head.]
LAURA
Well, that certainly is... interesting.
JANICE
You're looking great, Sheila!
SHEILA
Thanks, Janice. Fecal transplant!
[The Broflovski house, living room, day. Kyle enters with a package. When he gets to the sofa he opens it up and takes out its contents. Inside is a DVD titled "So Your Mom Had a Fecal Transplant". He pops it into the DVD player and turns on the TV. He sees a hummingbird pollinating a flower]
NARRATOR
If you're watching this video, then your mom probably had a fecal transplant. [a close up of a young boy's eyes looking into the camera] And the one question on your mind is most likely "How do I keep my friends from ripping on me?" [the quote is then shown on screen]
KYLE
Yes!
NARRATOR
People make fun of what they don't understand. [a colorful clown is shown dancing onstage] So let's learn why your mom had a fecal transplant. It was to replace her [the screen freezes on the clown dancing and the word "microbiome" appears on screen] microbiome. Germs, bugs. [close up shots of these organisms are quickly shown] Thousands of organisms are all around you, all the time. That remote control you're holding. [Kyle looks at it] It's teeming with life. Bacteria and other organisms.
KYLE
Yuch. [tosses it away, then wipes his hands clean on his jacket.]
NARRATOR
They also live on your clothes.
KYLE
Yeesh.
NARRATOR
Small organisms are everywhere. Now, scratch your balls. [Kyle gets a puzzled look] Go on. [Kyle looks around] If you don't have balls, scratch whatever else might be down there. [Kyle puts his hands down his crotch and scratches] Now, smell your fingers. [Kyle smells his fingers] That smell is millions of living organisms that you just scraped from your crotch and are now going up into your nostrils. [Kyle grimaces, shows shock, and then shakes his head trying to get the image out of it] Your microbiome.
KYLE
Eewww!
NARRATOR
Creatures live in your teeth. They live on your eyelashes. On your skin. And trillions and trillions live inside your body. [Kyle looks alarmed. A 3D rendered chart of a human body is shown covered in colorful dots.] In fact, of all the cells in your body, only half are human cells [half of the dots move to the left of the screen and form a square]. The other half are all microscopic organisms. [the remaining dots move to the right, showing the figure as a skeleton]
KYLE
Aaagh! [runs off]
[Café Monet, day. Sheila, Linda S., Laura, and Mrs. Biggle are seated at a table inside.]
LAURA
How was your salmon, Sheila?
SHEILA
Oh it's amazing. You know I could never eat like this before. My allergy to shellfish has literally gone away.
LINDA S.
Oh my gosh, that's so wonderful.
MRS. BIGGLE
Oh. [giggles and clears her throat] That, that reminds me, so, Sheila, um, the girls and I were talking. Well, you seem so... great, and we thought how nice it would be for us to have a little bit of your poop.
SHEILA
... Um, what?
LAURA
Well, thing is, we asked our doctors about getting fecal transplants too, and they said they only do them for "medical reasons," so we have to do them on our own.
SHEILA
Oh heh, well, you know girls, if the doctor doesn't think it's safe, you probably shouldn't be doing DIY transplants.
MRS. BIGGLE
No, that's very true, isn't it? We were just thinking that your microbiome is so healthy now [Laura nods], and it would be nice to share a little.
SHEILA
Yeah. [stammers] I mean, i-it's not that I don't want to share everything with my friends, it's just uh, you know, uh, I'm sorry, it's uh, it just doesn't seem right.
MRS. BIGGLE
And that is totally fine.
LAURA
If it doesn't feel right, then it probably isn't right. [giggles]
SHEILA
[feels her phone vibrate] Oh, this is Kyle. Sorry, girls, let me take this. [leaves the table]
THE OTHER LADIES
Okay.
MRS. BIGGLE
[moments later, when Sheila is out of earshot] That cunt! I told you she'd say no!
LAURA
How much of a bitch can you be? Won't share your feces? Talk about anal-retentive!
LINDA S.
[pounds her fist on the table] Fuck her! Fuck her!
[The Broflovski house, Kyle's bedroom, night. Kyle tosses and turns in his sleep.]
KYLE (VOICE-OVER)
Half the cells in my body. Half...[a close up of multiple cells splitting] They're inside me right now. Alive. [multiple organisms floating] All over me. [a black bookcase is shown in a living room] The bookcase.
KYLE
[wakes up and sits upright] Aaah!
[The boys' favorite eatery, day. The main four sit and eat burgers and fries.]
KYLE
Do you guys have any idea what I'm saying?! Half the cells in our bodies aren't human! Right now there are alive creatures in your eyelashes and in your teeth!
CARTMAN
So?
KYLE
So?! Right now, that straw has a bunch of little bugs and they're going in your mouth and mixing with trillions of other little bugs that are alive inside you! You aren't even totally you!
STAN
Dude, Kyle, why are you talking about all this?
KYLE
Okay, guys, listen. My mom had a fecal transplant.
CARTMAN
[spits his soda out and laughs at him] Fecal transplant!
MRS. BIGGLE
Hi Kyle. I'm Harriet, Henrietta and Bradley's mommy. I've been looking all over town for you.
KYLE
Why?
HARRIET
Well, I went to the video game store and I bought this. [reaches into her purse and pulls out a game] Jedi: Fallen Order. It's getting great reviews. Thought you might want it.
CARTMAN
Whaaat?
STAN
Yeah, he wants it.
HARRIET
Great. Could you do just one little thing for me, Kyle?
KENNY
(Yeah. He'll do anything.) [Kyle did not appreciate that]
HARRIET
When you get back home, could you find a way to get a little of your mom's poop, and put it in this jar? [pulls out an empty mason jar]
KYLE
What?! Eww! No!
CARTMAN
Yes!
HARRIET
I don't need much. I'm sure you can find a way to sneak it from her. You do that and the game is all yours.
KYLE
That is disgusting. Absolutely not!
CARTMAN
Kyle!
HARRIET
Oh well, think about it. The offer stands. I heard you can customize your own lightsaber. [slides away]
CARTMAN
What is your problem?!
KYLE
What is MY problem?! I'm not gonna go steal my mom's shit!
STAN
Dude, you realize we won't get that game 'till Christmas. We could be playing it tomorrow.
KENNY
(TO-MORROW!)
KYLE
I said "no", and that's final!
[The Broflovski house, night. Sheila goes into the bathroom to take a dump. Down in the basement, Stan, Cartman, and Kenny are messing with the plumbing. Stan peeks out through a grill, Cartman works on the drain removing the cleanout, and Kenny waits by an empty bucket]
STAN
She's in. Kyle's mom just squatted in the toilet. [gets off his perch and walks over to Cartman]
CARTMAN
Okay, we've got contact. Are you ready with the bucket, Kenny?
KENNY
Got it. [brings it over]
CARTMAN
Place it directly under this pipe. [Kenny puts the bucket under the pipe, and Cartman adjusts its position] Alright. That should just about do it. [steps back] Now we just wait. For the flush.
KENNY
[a few seconds later] She's not flushing.
CARTMAN
That's good she's not flushing yet. That means she's got more serious business, and serious business is just what we're after.
STAN
You think she'll poop a big enough log? [Kyle appears on the steps behind them.]
CARTMAN
You see how fat Kyle's mom is? That bitch must poop at least two-pounders.
KYLE
The fuck are you doing?! [the others turn around]
CARTMAN
Oh, hey Kyle, What's going on?
KYLE
You are NOT stealing my mom's shit!
CARTMAN
Kyle, this is the world we're living in, okay? People are finding new and exciting ways to get healthy, and who are we to stand in their way? [behind him, two pieces of poop drop into the bucket]
[Hell's Pass Hospital. Dr. Gauche talks to Kyle.]
KYLE
It just freaks me out, Doc. [the doctor listens to Kyle breathing and heartbeat] We all have these... things... living inside our bodies, and everyone just seems fine with it. It's like, as soon as people learn they have microbiomes, the first thing they want to do is start swapping them.
DR. GAUCHE
[puts his stethoscope around his neck and goes to wash his hands] Well, young man, the truth is we still don't know a lot about the microbiome, but you shouldn't let it "freak you out."
KYLE
But where does it stop?! Then, are people just gonna start wanting skinny people's microbiomes to be skinny? Or an athlete's microbiome to feel athletic and young again?
DR. GAUCHE
Yes, it's possible, but we don't know enough. There is no superfeces which can make you athletic and young. [turns the faucet off and dries his hands]
KYLE
Well like, what about Tom Brady's poop?
DR. GAUCHE
[turns around and faces Kyle. "The spice. He knows about the spice."]
KYLE
I'm just saying that Tom Brady seems to work really hard on his diet and stuff. His shit must be pretty good.
DR. GAUCHE
[thinking, "More than pretty good. The spice mélange."]
KYLE
[uncomfortable from the hard stare] What?
DR. GAUCHE
Nothing. [thinking, "It's unobtainable. The spice. But could he be the one to bring it here?"]
["One For The Ladies" resumes]
ANNOUNCER
And now back to "One For The Ladies."
[Linda S. and Laura walk down Main Street]
LINDA S.
Have you been in that store at all?
LAURA
No. I think it's new, isn't it?
LINDA S.
It used to be that watch store.
LAURA
Oh my God. Harriet?
HARRIET
[dressed in a tennis outfit, turns around] Oh, hi girls. What's new?
LINDA S.
My goodness, look at you!
LAURA
You look great! What happened?
HARRIET
Fecal transplant. It's true what they say: I feel 20 years younger. [swings her tennis racket around]
A DRIVER
[pulls up in his red sports car] Looking good, Mrs. B.
HARRIET
Fecal transplant, Damon. Keep your eyes in the road!
SHEILA
Harriet?
HARRIET
Oh. Hey, Sheila. [smiles]
SHEILA
You're looking chipper today.
HARRIET
Yeah, I had a little procedure done. Fecal transplant.
SHEILA
I though the doctor wouldn't give you a fecal transplant, Harriet.
HARRIET
No, I... did it myself. With a turkey baster.
SHEILA
Where did you get the feces?
HARRIET
Well, it's really none of your business, Sheila. It's a private matter, a fecal transplant. I'd really rather not talk about it. See you girls! [walks off]
THE OTHER LADIES
Bye, Harriet! [smile. But those smiles soon vanish.]
LAURA
Two-faced bitch! You know what she said about you at lunch?
SHEILA
What?
LINDA S.
She called you the C-word!
SHEILA
You're joking!
LAURA
Oh no! Clearly she couldn't stand that you were the only one whose shit didn't stink.
LINDA S.
Fuck her! Fuck her!
[The counselor's office, day. Mr. Mackey has Kenny, Stan, and Cartman in for questioning.]
MR. MACKEY
Boys, I brought you in here because some rumors are floatin' around the school, m'kay? These rumors are that you three somehow stole feces from Kyle's mom, m'kay, and gave it to Mrs. Biggle in return for "Jedi: Fallen Order."
CARTMAN
That is 100% untrue.
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, well someone in this school is a little turd burglar, and I want some answers!
STAN
How can answer that to which we have no knowledge?
CARTMAN
Very nice, very nice.
MR. MACKEY
It must be hard, having to take turns playing "Jedi: Fallen Order." It's a single-player game, I believe.
CARTMAN
Wouldn't know.
MR. MACKEY
Oh. Because... I could get you each your own copy. That would be a lot of fun, wouldn't it? You guys stole the poop. Could you do it again?
STAN
You want us to steal some of Kyle's mom's poop for you?
MR. MACKEY
Not Kyle's mom's. Someone else's.
CARTMAN
Whose?
MR. MACKEY
[thinking, "The spice. I must have it. The spice mélange."]
[A New England Patriots press conference. Tom Brady comes out to speak to the cameras.]
TOM
Alright. Alright, I'm... proud of our team today. It was uh... You know, I thought our defense did a great job keepin' us in the game, and again, I think the offense has a lot of room for improvement and all that... starts with me. Questions? Yeah.
REPORTER 1
Can we have your poop?
TOM
No. Guys, I'm not gonna take any requests for my microbiome. I just wanna focus on the team. We're 10-1 now, you know, but, we can't let up. Yeah?
SPORTWRITER
Please, can we have your poop?
TOM
Okay, I'm not, I'm not gonna stay our here, you guys. It's just- Does anyone have a real question?
REPORTER 2
Tom, after you leave here, are you gonna go eat somewhere or go right home and have a-
TOM
Nono, no. See, I'm not gonna tell you where I'm going, because you're all gonna try and follow me into the bathroom. You're not taking my feces, so unless you have a football question, we're done here.
REPORTER 1
Can we buy your poop?
[Kyle's bedroom, night. He's sleeping with the covers off. "Microbiome... inside me. They are inside me. Are they apart of me? When I eat, they eat. When I die, they consume me and continue to live. Am I just an Airbnb in Santa Clarita?" He wakes up, eyes glowing "They're not a part of me. They ARE me." He sits up and looks at his hands. They're teeming with microorganisms. "The bookcase. THE BOOKCASE.]
[Kenny, Cartman and Stan are sitting in Tom Brady's publicist's office. Kenny is in a wheelchair with an IV attached to him, wearing Patriots sports gear and holding a football in his lap. His hair is shown, but his eyes are shielded by the sports cap]
PUBLICIST
You have to understand. A lot of people want things from Tom Brady. He has to be a little protective.
STAN
Yes, we do understand. We just... well, since you're his publicist. we thought that... you could give Mr. Brady our message. [begins crying]
CARTMAN
[pats Stan on the shoulder] It's all right, Stan. Don't cry. You see, ma'am, our little friend Kenny here is dying, and he's... he's just the biggest Patriots fan.
PUBLICIST
You know, I can call him, but he's very busy right now with the season.
STAN
Well if Mr. Brady could just, you know, have Kenny stay over at his house for a night.
CARTMAN
Kind of, like a Michael Jackson kind of thing. [Kenny mumbles something] Oh gosh, we're losin' him! We need to make this happen quickly, ma'am.
PUBLICIST
[thinking, "They want the spice, just like the rest. Perhaps they are the ones."]
CARTMAN
Uh, ma'am?
PUBLICIST
[thinking, A chance, perhaps... they could actually obtain the spice mélange."] Let me... see what I can do.
[Café Monet. The ladies have gathered there for lunch again]
SHEILA
Girls, can I just say... you both look fantastic.
LAURA
[chuckles] Oh, thanks, girlfriend. We've been working out and dieting, you know. Not cheating like that bitch Harriet.
SHEILA
Well, it's great you guys are doing it the natural way. amd we don't have to deal with Harriet anymore. [the doors fly open and Harriet enters, having thrown up on herself.]
HARRIET
There you are, you Goddamned bitch! I will take you to court, fat whore!
SHEILA
Harriet, I do not like your tone.
HARRIET
You knew I was gonna steal your poo, and so you tainted it, didn't you?!
SHEILA
What are you talking about?
HARRIET
I have been shitting and throwing up all day! It has to be from your feces!
SHEILA
So you DID take my poo, huh, Harriet?!
HARRIET
That's besides the point now!
SHEILA
Oh, IS it? 'Cause the girls told me you called me the C-word the other day.
HARRIET
Oh, you're all backstabbing bitches now?!
LINDA S.
Fuck you, Harriet!
MALE DINER
Oho. Okay ladies, come on.
HARRIET
Just admit it! I can't stop puking and shitting because of what you did to me!
LAURA
Oh. Gaw! [throws up, then shits herself]
HARRIET
What the fuck?!
LINDA S.
You thought you were such hot shit, Harriet! We took the leftover feces from your house and put it up our asses with a turkey baster! Oh! Oh God! [moves away from the table and projectile-vomits, then almost falls over as she projective-poops on other diners, then vomits on another table. Soon, Linda S. is also shitting and pooping on patrons.]
["One For The Ladies" resumes]
ANNOUNCER
And now back to "One For The Ladies."
[An alien landscape is shown. A monster with five jaws rises from it, roars, and goes back down into it, burrowing a hole. The camera zooms out and the landscape is just a piece of poo in a toilet somewhere. A man looks in the toilet before flushing it - it's Tom Brady. His doorbell rings and he turns to get it. Downstairs, the housekeeper answers the door and sees the three boys outside.]
CARTMAN
Hello, ma'am. We are the darling children whose dying friend is all set to meet Tom Brady.
MABEL
[gravelly voice] I am Mabel Gonzales, the housekeeper. [thinking, "They're here for the spice. I can sense it."]
CARTMAN
[thinking, "I wonder why everyone keeps taking really long pauses after they talk."]
STAN
[thinking, "People just keep looking at me like I'm supposed to say something."]
KENNY
[thinking, "Why did I agree to this? I don't even have a machine to play Fallen Order on."]
MABEL
Come on in. Mr. Brady is just using the bathroom. [thinking, "Music to your ears, I suppose."]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. The parking lot is filled with ambulances bringing in sick men and women from everywhere.]
DR. GAUCHE
We've got more sick incoming! Try and make some more room! [Moves over to Det. Yates] We have a major epidemic here, Detective. C. diff. has spread to half the town. We don't have enough staff or enough to supplies to keep up with it.
YATES
How does this happen?
DR. GAUCHE
Apparently, the outbreak started at a restaurant when some women got sick on everybody. The women contracted C. diff. by giving themselves DIY fecal transplants.
YATES
So they got sick from another woman's feces?
DR. GAUCHE
No, they got sick from using this, [holds up a turkey baster] A common household turkey baster. It's a thing most people use just once a year, around Thanksgiving. The rest of the year it just sits in a drawer collecting bacteria, and then the ladies went and stuck it up their asses.
YATES
Oh, those ladies!
DR. GAUCHE
It gets worse. We're completely out of healthy donor feces. Even if we found a donor at this point, it wouldn't be enough to give everyone transplants.
YATES
So what happens next?
DR. GAUCHE
With how contagious C. diff. is and how deadly, half of South Park is going to die.
YATES
[walks off] Jesus. What have those rascally ladies done?
[Tom Brady's living room, day. The boys wait in the living room with a family and a sportswriter]
STAN
So, you're all here to meet Tom Brady too?
SPORTSWRITER
Yeah, I'm a sportswriter, getting a little interview. [thinking, "A little interview, and hopefully more."]
MOM
Yes, and we're here with our little girl who's dying, just like your friend.
THERESA
I'm dying, mommy?
MOM
Shut up, Theresa! [thinking, "The spice mélange. It is here in this house."]
MABEL
Everyone, the honorable Thomas Brady.
TOM
Hey, everybody. [moves to the middle of the room, in front of a bookcase]
SPORTSWRITER
[jumps up with a knife to keep the others away from Tom] The rest of you, stand back! They all deceived you, Mr. Brady! They only want to get the spice mélange.
TOM
Oh God, not again. Alright, everybody out. Come on, let's go.
CARTMAN
Mr. Brady, can we just see your basement really fast?
TOM
Nope, nope, that's all. If you people want a healthy microbiome, then proper diet and healthy choices, alright? That's it! You are all being ridiculous! [the doors open and Kyle enters, stepping down into the living room. His eyes are still glowing blue.]
STAN
Kyle, dude, what are you doing here? [Kyle moves forward]
CARTMAN
You don't get to be part of Turd Burglars now, Kyle! [Kyle continues forward and stops at the bookcase]
KYLE
The bookcase. [presses a button on the panel in front of him and the bookcase recedes and opens up, revealing a vault full of Tom Brady's poop in mason jars.]
ALL
Whoa!
TOM
Okay, look. I got sick of people going to my basement and screwing with my plumbing
SPORTSWRITER
The spice! So much of it!
MABEL
Enough for everyone! Enough to bring peace to all!
TOM
I stopped flushing them because people kept breaking my pipes to get them.
PUBLICIST
Never did I think so much of it could be obtained.
MOM
This is enough for all the universe!
TOM
I mean, you'd all do the same thing if people were always trying to steal your shit. [Kyle's glowing eyes check out every bit of the poo cellar, which also serves as the wine cellar]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Dr. Gauche takes a jar of poop and drops it into a blender, adds some water, and starts the blender up. He then takes a sterile syringe and fills it with the fecal juice and injects it into Mrs. Testaburger's anus.]
DR. GAUCHE
That's good. Stay still. Almost there.
HARRIET
Oh, Sheila, I'm so sorry for stealing your feces.
LINDA S.
And we're sorry for stealing it from you, Harriet.
SHEILA
Girls, this was all my fault. I think I got a little carried away bragging about my fecal transplant.
LAURA
I hope we can all be besties again.
DR. GAUCHE
[stopping by to visit.] You ladies are pretty lucky. If it hadn't been for these little turd burglars here, you'd be dead. And also responsible for the deaths of countless others.
SHEILA
Kyle, how did you do it? I mean, how did you even know what was going on?
KYLE
I didn't know. My microbiome did. All along they were trying to tell me something. I really learned that I'm not just me. I'm also all the creatures inside of me. From now on, I'm gonna trust my gut a little more. [pats his belly]
DR. GAUCHE
Well, I think we've all learned something. One for the ladies is one too many for the ladies. [everyone laughs.]
End of Turd Burglars


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Scott Malkinson's future with the new girl in his class depends on him getting the latest and greatest streaming platform. Scott’s dad works for the local cable company and refuses to move beyond basic cable.

script:Basic Cable

[The episode begins with a new opener for "The Scott Malkinson Show," which shows Scott as something of a secret agent mixed with Captain Diabetes. He fights sugar cubes which could be death to him,
Scott's house, day. He's asleep in his room and it's almost 8 am. His alarm goes off at 8 and he wakes up. He stretches and then reaches for his glucose meter and checks his blood sugar. 90. He takes a shower and brushes his teeth.]
SCOTT
[looks into the mirror] Dad? Dad, I love you. I love you so much, Dad. [finishes brushing his teeth, then grabs some syringes from his drawer to take with him for the day. He goes downstairs and reaches the table just in time to get breakfast from his mom. His dad, in work clothes, is already at the table eating.]
SCOTT'S MOM
What is it, Scott?
SCOTT
Ninety, Mom.
SCOTT'S MOM
Okay, great. [turns and goes back to the kitchen]
SCOTT
[turns to his dad] Dad, I love you.
SCOTT'S DAD
What?
SCOTT
I love you so much, Dad. Please, can we get Disney+?
SCOTT'S DAD
Goddamnit, not this shit again! No! [Scott lowers his head] We don't need Disney Fucking Plus, Scott! We got cable, and that's enough! [pounds the table] All this talk about Disney+ and CBS Max and shit on a fucking extreme prime! Where's it gonna end?! Straight to fucking hell, that's where! I'm going to work! [gets up and leaves his meal half-eaten.]
SCOTT
[hyperventilates a bit, then checks his blood sugar again. 165.] Shit! [reaches for an insulin syringe and gives himself a shot in the belly] Asshole!
[The school bus, day. Scott is on his way to school with a bunch of other students. In front of the school, he checks his blood sugar again. In class, he sits quietly as the other students talk amongst themselves]
MR. MACKEY
Okay, kids, if we can all be quiet, please? Today is a very special day, because we have a new student who just moved to town and will be starting her schoolastic adventures here in South Park. I know you're gonna be very kind, and make her feel at home.
CARTMAN
[scoffs] Hehyeah.
MR. MACKEY
Please say hi to Sophie Gray.
SOPHIE GRAY
[walks into view] Hey, guys. Um, well, I moved here from Arizona, I really like soccer, and I love The Mandalorian, and, um, I guess one thing about me that might be kind of different is that I have diabetes.
SCOTT
Say what??
SOPHIE
I have a thing called diabetes. It's a condition that affects the way my body processes sugar. It just means that I have to check my blood sugar once in a while, and sometimes I have to... [voice trails off as Scott falls in love] ...part of who I am. Oh, and I also have a pony.
[Cafeteria, lunchtime. The boys are seated at a table]
SCOTT
Holy shit, guys! What am I gonna do?!
STAN
About what?
SCOTT
About Sophie Gray! She's my boo! I love her! What am I supposed to say to her.
CARTMAN
Scott, you can't be with Sophie Gray. She has diabetes.
SCOTT
I know! That's why she's perfect!
CARTMAN
No, Scott, if you and Sophie have a baby, it'll have super diabetes. I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure that causes a crater on the Earth.
JIMMY
That girl is pretty fly. As soon as she said she watches Mandalorian, it gave me a little boner. If you wanna be with a new girl, you're gonna have some stiff competition. Get it? Stiff? C-, c-, c-, c-, competition.
SCOTT
But she has diabetes. You guys always rip on me for having diabetes.
CARTMAN
[mimicking Scott] You guys always rip on me for havin' diabetes. I'm Scott Malkinson. [the others laugh]
SCOTT
No! Not this time! You guys aren't ruining Scott Malkinson's life again! I'm taking control! Do you understand?! [leaves the table]
CARTMAN
[mimicking Scott] I'm taking control do you understand I'm Scott Malkinson I have diabetes. [the others laugh]
[The neighborhood, day. Scott's father sits in his truck listening to Thomas Dolby when an incoming call awakens him]
DISPATCHER
Hey Clark. Clark, are you there?
SCOTT'S DAD
[picks up the radio] This is Clark. Go ahead.
DISPATCHER
Yeah hey, I think we actually have a job. The Stotches need their cable box looked at.
CLARK
Alright, I'm on it!
DISPATCHER
Uh, listen, Clark, part of why we're losing customers is 'cause people say our service is slow.
CLARK
Don't worry, I'll be there as fast as I can!
[Clark starts up his van and peels away. He drives down on E street and makes a hard right onto another. Something catches his eye and he pulls into an M Burgers drive-through.]
CASHIER
Welcome to McDonald's. Can I take your order?
CLARK
Number 3 value meal, no pickle.
[Clark gets his meal and pulls away, going to eat at Stark's Pond. Once done, he goes back to town and does some grocery shopping. He gets some Thin snacks to go with his other purchases. He goes bowling and picks up nine pins. Finally, he shows up at the Stotch house.]
STEPHEN
Oh. Well, finally! The cable company gave us a window from noon to 5 for you to show up, It's 5:15.
CLARK
[gets out] Well I'm only 15 minutes late.
STEPHEN
This is why we should quit cable and just go to streaming services.
CLARK
Oh, you want quantity over quality?! Streaming services are destroying our town! People don't watch and bond over the same shows anymore! Everyone watches somethin' different! 'Cause you got assholes in Hollywood making little niche programs for everybody! That's what you want?!
STEPHEN
[coolly] Yeah, I think I do.
[South Park Elementary, hallway. Sophie puts her books away in her locker.]
A BOY
Uhh, hi. [she looks back to see whom it is] You're the new girl, right? i>[the boys is Pete] Just wanted to say, you know, welcome to the school.
SOPHIE
Oh thanks. That's really nice of you.
PETE
I was wondering if maybe sometime, well I could show around if you need it.
SOPHIE
Wow, that'd be great. A couple of the other guys offered too.
PETE
[eyebrows knit] Yeah, a lot of the guys here are posers though. You gotta be careful.
SOPHIE
That's funny. Another one of the guys said that. He was the tall kid that kinda dresses like you. [Scott appears from around a corner and is instantly alarmed when he sees Sophie talking with Pete]
PETE
Oh yeah, he's a total poser. [Scott goes back around the corner, where he can't be seen]
SCOTT
[whispers] God damnit! Fucking asshole. [whips out his glucose meter to measure his sugar and peaks around the corner. 172. He gets out some insulin and gives himself a shot. Sophie and Pete are still chatting]
SOPHIE
...yeah, and so my dad actually still lives in Scottsdale.
PETE
Scottsdale. Love it there.
SCOTT
[bumps Pete off] Hi Sophie. Hoe's it going?
PETE
Ow! Watch it, dork!
SCOTT
I have something really important to tell you, Sophie. It can't wait.
SOPHIE
Oh, okay. [to Pete] I'll see you around, huh?
PETE
Yeah, sure thing. [keeps an eye on Scott while leaving.]
SCOTT
So, uh, you have diabetes, right?
SOPHIE
Yeah.
SCOTT
[sighs] I... have diabetes. [grins.]
SOPHIE
Oh. [silence]
SCOTT
So... what do you wanna do now? [grins.]
[The playground. While the other kids play, Scott and Sophie sit on the merry-go-round watching them]
SCOTT
So... what's your favorite food... that you can't eat? Mine's waffles.
SOPHIE
Um, I haven't really thought about it.
SCOTT
Oh...
SOPHIE
Do you watch The Mandalorian on Disney+?
SCOTT
Oh... Ughuh, yeah, of course. I love The Mandalorian.
SOPHIE
Right? It's the best Star Wars thing since Empire. Makes all the new movies look like dog shit.
SCOTT
Yeah, like, super dog shit.
CLYDE
[walks up] Hey, you're the new girl, right?
SCOTT
She's busy! [Clyde is surprised; leaves]
SOPHIE
Hey, are you gonna watch the new episode on Friday? We could watch it together if you want.
SCOTT
Oh my God. I would love that.
SOPHIE
Okay. I'll be over right when it starts streaming.
SCOTT
Oh. Well, uh, the thing is, I, I mean uh...
TIMMY
[rolls up] Timmih!
SCOTT
[gets off the merry-go-round] She's busy, and she's watching Mandalorian at my house!
TIMMY
Timmih... [reverses direction and rolls away]
[Malkinson Residence. His parents sit in their armchairs to watch TV. Scott has his own beanbag chair between them, but he's not home yet]
CLARK
Look at that. Look. Two hundred and forty channels of anything we wanna watch. No accounts! No fucking passwords! Just pure, simple, basic cable.
SCOTT
[opens the front door and enters the house] Mom! Dad! Guess what?! [closes the door]
CLARK
Not now, Scott. Your mom and I are enjoying watching whatever we want [switches channels] and not signing up for anything.
SCOTT
But Dad, there's this new girl in school, and she has... diabetes!
MRS. MALKINSON
Oh, that's wonderful, Scott.
SCOTT
Yeah. And guess what? She wants to come over to our house! So we HAVE to get Disney+!
CLARK
Oh, not this shit again! The answer is no! [gets up and heads for the kitchen]
SCOTT
Dad, please! This is my life!
CLARK
Streaming services are destroying our culture, Scott! People got a thousand shows at their fingertips 24/7, so Hollywood has to make shows within their shows to make more shows!
SCOTT
But Dad, what's wrong with people watching what they wanna watch when they wanna watch it?
CLARK
[mimicking] "What's wrong with people watching what they wanna watch when they wanna watch it? I'm Scott Malkinson. I have diabetes." [goes into the kitchen]
SCOTT
Unbelievable!! [turns left and walks away.]
CLARK
[gets his phone and places a call] Yeah, it's me. It's time we took down all these streaming services down. Tell all the guys we're meeting ASAP, in a window between 10 am and 2 pm Thursday.
[The Scott Malkinson show returns.]
CLARK
Goddamnit, where are they?! We're gonna run out of time! [two more men arrive in their work van.] Where the hell have you guys been?!
REPAIRMAN 1 (BILL)
You gave us a window of 10 am to 2 pm. It's 1:50.
CLARK
"Between 10 and 2 doesn't mean you wait until 1-fucking-50!"
REPAIRMAN 2 (KURT)
Wow. What's wrong with you??
CLARK
What's wrong is that we;'re losin' our asses to these sons of bitches! I don't know about you buys, but I haven't worked a full day in weeks! [pounds his left fist into his right palm]
REPAIRMAN 2
Hey, that's right.
CLARK
These streaming services all still need the Internet to stream, right? And who laid all that cable those companies are streamin' on?!
THE OTHER WORKERS
We did.
CLARK
That's right. We fucking did. We're cable repairmen! We control what goes into people's houses! Us! It's time that we work together and show people how much they still need us!
REPAIRMAN 3 (MICHAEL)
Yeah! Let's uncouple the stranded conductor!
REPAIRMAN 2
Let's tear the insulation off the retractile cables.
CLARK
Bill and Dave, you get supplies from the electronics store! Kurt, you help Michael with the hardware we're gonna need! Let's meet at the breaker between 4 and 7 pm!
THE OTHER WORKERS
Yeah! [the repairmen get into their vans and race across town. Michael stops by a Walgreens to get his cholesterol checked. Bill and Dave head for a Royal Cinemas theater to watch a movie. Bill buys tickets and sends Dave off to buy snacks. Kurt goes into a tanning salon and gets an artificial tan.]
[Canada Ploos appears onscreen]
ANNOUNCER
You're watching Canada Ploos. Your source for all Canadian entertainment.
CARTMAN
[checking out this streaming service] Oh, that's pretty cool.
ANNOUNCER
Which Canadian program would you like to watch? [Cartman reviews the choices] Terrance & Philip. The Queef Sisters. Terrance & Philip. The Queef Sisters. Terrance &-. The Queef Sis-. [the channels pings, and The Queef Sisters appears onscreen. Catherine is sunbathing on a beach]
KATIE
Katherine, I have some bad news.
KATHERINE
What is it, Katie? [Katie squats down on her face and queefs on it, then gets off and the sisters laugh]
CARTMAN
Agh, goddamnit. [pauses the stream and goes to the front door. He opens it, and Scott is on the landing]
SCOTT
You gotta help me!
CARTMAN
With what?
SCOTT
With my baby girl! [enters the house] She's everything to me, bro, but to impress her, I have to get Disney+. How can I get it without my parents' credit card?
CARTMAN
You don't wanna go around messin' with that.
SCOTT
[turns around to face Cartman] You once had a girlfriend, Eric. You and Heidi were together a long time. You know how important this is.
CARTMAN
[walks off] You want my advice? You're better off, Scott. Let some other fool have his life ruined.
SCOTT
What are you talking about, Eric? It-
CARTMAN
[turns around] Do you know what love is, Scott? I'll tell you one thing: it's not the happy ending that Disney movies promised us. There's just frustration, and anger, and pain. Relationships is diabetes times ten.
SCOTT
I can handle diabetes. I can handle a relationship.
CARTMAN
Fine. I'll tell you how to get Disney+. But when you feel like killing yourself in two years, don't do it in front of me.
[At a barbershop]
CLARK
Alright, let's do this! [reclines so his hare can be soaked in water, then sits up for his haircut. He reads Firearms Quarterly, then checks out some aftershave lotion, makes some purchases, and leaves] Dave? Dave, you got everything from the electronics store?
DAVE
Not yet. Still workin' on it.
CLARK
Well what the fuck are you doing?!
DAVE
You gave me a window from noon to 3 to get it all; it's only 2:45.
CLARK
God-fucking-damnit, can we get the show on the road here, guys?! Kurt, you got the cable splitters?
KURT
[long pause] ...Huh?
CLARK
Goddamnit, get the cable splitters!
[Downtown South Park. Scott walks down Main Street looking for someone. He stops when he sees Nathan in the distance: "streaming accounts", then checks the insulin supplies in his tote bag. He goes on to meet Nathan]
NATHAN
Steaming accounts and passwords! Steaming accounts! Passwords!
SCOTT
Ah, hey.
NATHAN
Hey. What's going on?
SCOTT
Uuhh, Eric Cartman told me you have access to streaming accounts.
NATHAN
Maybe I do, and maybe I don't. Are you a cop?
SCOTT
No, I'm Scott Malkinson. I go to your school.
NATHAN
Never heard of you.
SCOTT
Haven't you ever heard the other kids say, "I'm Scott Malkinson. I have diabetes"? Uh I'm Scott Malkinson.
NATHAN
Oh, yeah. Well, in that case, [opens his jacket to reveal his wares] Hulu? Netflix? HBO Max? I got all the accounts and passwords you need.
SCOTT
No, I need a Disney+ account.
NATHAN
Oh, you want the good stuff. That's pricey. Hard to find. What uh-are you lookin' to trade?
SCOTT
I have two 16-needle boxes of insulin. [takes out a box. Nathan takes a needle from the box and injects himself with it. A few seconds later he begins to shake.]
NATHAN
Oh. Oh God. Oh! Ohhhhhhh! [the shaking subsides] Yeah, that's pretty good shit. [takes the box and sets it aside] Alright, here you go. [gives him a keygov] Disney+ account and password.
[The sewer under the neighborhood, evening. Below the manhole cover, the repairmen get to work.]
CLARK
Alright, I got the static coupler conected to the RF switch. You got the BT router undone, dave?
DAVE
Yeah. Yeah, I think that's got it.
CLARK
Okay. Let's throw the pulse cable! [Dave stands up and pulls the switch, and the short travels around the tunnel, shutting down the electricity.] Yeah, I think that's good.
[Scott's house, evening. Scott prepares a romantic dinner for himself and Sophie, and his sorting the chip bowl just right. The doorbell rings and he pants.]
SCOTT
Oh God. [goes to answer the door]
SOPHIE
Hey!
SCOTT
Hi, Sophie.
SOPHIE
[runs in] The show starts streaming in two minutes! [sits in Clark's armchair] I have to watch right when it starts streaming. I hate spoilers.
SCOTT
Me too!
SOPHIE
This'll be a great place to watch it. [her phone beeps and she checks it out] Uh oh. Hey, do you have some juice or something? My blood sugar is a little low.
SCOTT
Oh my God, I love you so much.
SOPHIE
Huh?
SCOTT
[reaches over into a pail of chilled juices and hands her some fruit punch] Uh, uhhh, here you go. I have lots of juices standing by.
SOPHIE
Great! [takes the bottle and drinks from it through its straw. Scott grins] Mm, okay, it's time. Put it on.
SCOTT
O-kay! [turns the TV on and sees the Disney+ screen. He navigates to The Mandalorian] and clicks on it.
SOPHIE
Ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod! Yesyesyesyes! [This makes Scott very happy. A baby Yoda appears onscreen lifting a cup, and the signal is lost] Hey, uh, what's going on?
SCOTT
I, uh I don't know. [begins changing channels and gets the J&G Shopping Network's "Jewelry Bonanza with Dean".]
DEAN
This is item number 45-78111.
SOPHIE
Can you change it back?
SCOTT
It, ih-it's not... working.
DEAN
Look at these stunning ear- [keeps shanging channels and gets static on Netflix, Amazon PrimeVideo, etc] I don't know what's going on!
SOPHIE
It's gonna be okay. That Jimmy kid invited me to watch at his house. Come on! [leaves the house]
SCOTT
[follows her out] Oh no, not Jimmy! Bae? Bae, come back!
[PC Babies appears onscreen]
EMORY
Now back to PC Babies.
STAN
PC Babies? What the hell is this? [The four are at Jimmy's house with Clyde]
KYLE
Put it back to Mandalorian, Jimmy! Nobody likes PC Babies.
JIMMY
[tries getting back to the show, but keeps getting basic shows] I'm trying, but... something's wrong with the TV.
DEAN
-teen karat gold-
CARTMAN
This is bullcrap! Give me that thing!
ANNOUNCER
You're watching Canada Ploos. [a shot of Katherine queefing on Katie]
CARTMAN
Goddamnit! [the doorbell rings and Jimmy goes to answer it. He opens the door and Sophie appears with Scott.]
JIMMY
Oh. Hey, Sophie.
SCOTT
[miffed that he wasn't acknowledged] And Scott.
SOPHIE
Hay! Hope it's still okay to come over?
JIMMY
Sure. Come on in. [leads them to the sofa] Hey, look who's here, fellas. It's Sophie.
SCOTT
And Scott!
THE BOYS
Hey, Sophie.
SOPHIE
Oh no, your streaming services are messing up too?
STAN
What do you mean? This isn't just happening here?
SOPHIE
No. We were just at Scott's house and it was the same thing. This is terrible!
CARTMAN
[leaves the sofa and walks over to Sophie] Hey, don't worry, Sophie. We can go watch it together at Tolkien's house. His family has the best AV equipment.
SCOTT
Oh, what happened to "girls are just like diabetes"?!
STAN
Let's just hurry and get to Tolkien's house!
KYLE
Yeah! Come on, Sophie!
SCOTT
And Scott!
[A Hulu screen appears first, then a new show...]
STEVE BLACK
[Tolkien's family is shown] We're the Blacks, a hip family just trying to get by. The problem is, our neighbors.
BOB WHITE
We're the Whites. Nobody cares if bad things ever happen to us anymore. And things are getting worse. [a shot of the families facing off over a hedge row]
BOTH MEN
Because in this town, it's The Whites And The Blacks, on Amazon Prime.
LINDA S.
[pounds on the TV and gets different basic cable channels] What the? What is wrong with this stupid thing?!
STEPHEN
Aha, I don't even know who to call, uh. Here, let me try something. [presses buttons on his phone]
CLARK
[his phone rings] Here it comes. Here it comes. [shushes the other repairmen and picks up] Park County Cable. Oh, your streaming isn't working. Huh. Gee, I'm sorry, that's really not our problem. [puts a thumb up, and another call tries to get through] Uh, ohuh sir, can you hang on? I got another call. [presses a button] Clark County Cable. None of your streaming services are working either? Don't worry. You and everyone else in this town can count on your local cable company. We'll come fix the problem. [hangs up] Alright guys, let's be the heroes this town needs!
THE REPAIRMEN
Yeah!!
[JBO Max appears onscreen, followed by "Crab People"]
ANNOUNCER
You're watching Crab People on HBO Max.
SHERIFF
[talking to a woman at her house] So you say that these mutant crab people came up from under the ground and started eating children?
WOMAN
Nonono, Crab People was the show that came on TV when I was trying to watch Stranger Things on Netflix.
SHERIFF
Oh. [goes to the screen and stands next to it. The screen does have Crab People on it. He pounds on the TV a few times, but gets the same results everyone else has gotten. The front door opens and Sophie comes in with the group of boys]
SOPHIE
Mom, I can't watch Mandalorian anywhere. [looks at her TV] oh no, it's happening here too?
SOPHIE'S MOM
Who are all these boys, Sophie?
CARTMAN
Hello ma'am. I'm Eric Cartman. How are you?
JIMMY
Uh hi, Muh my name is Jimmy.
STAN
Uh, my name's Stan Marsh. [Kyle and Kenny introduce themselves]
CLYDE
...Clyde Donovan.
CARTMAN
Yeah yeah, nobody cares, Clyde. [Scott feels left out, so he looks into the kitchen and moves towards it. He begins to move stealthily. He reaches the refrigerator and opens it, looking for something sweet to eat. Not satisfied with anything in the fridge, he looks elsewhere and finds a blueberry pie on the kitchen table. He climbs up onto a stool and starts eating the pie, getting more voracious with every bite]
STAN
Well, it looks like nobody's streaming shows tonight. Sorry, Sophie.
CARTMAN
Not as sorry as I am, Sophie.
JIMMY
I-I'm the most sorriest, So-Sophie.
SCOTT
[comes back to the living room in a rage and dressed a bit like Wolverine.] Yyeeaahh! [the other kids back up] You assholes, stop talking to her!
STAN
Scott?
SCOTT
I am done having you all ruin my life! You hear me?! Done! You've taken my dignity for all these years, but you are not taking my girlfriend!
SOPHIE
What are you talking about, Scott? I'm not your girlfriend.
SCOTT
[turns around] Eh. You're not?
CARTMAN
Uh oh, looks like you got some pie on your face, Scott.
SOPHIE
I'm not anyone's girlfriend! I just fucking moved here, you guys. Can I have some time to unpack the shit in my room?
SCOTT
But Sophie, you're totally my type! Type I diabetes!
SOPHIE
Scott, I'm more than just my diabetes.
SCOTT
[his hopes are dashed] ...Well I'm not. I'm Scott Malkinson. [turns around and walks out of the house with his head low]
["One For The Ladies" appears on-screen. Scott sits alone on the school's merry-go-round. He gets out his glucose meter and measures his sugar. 40. A very low level, as indicated by the broken heart on the monitor. He sighs and continues sitting there.]
SOPHIE
Need a candy bar? [he looks to his left and sees her there] You're low, right? [she sits next to him] Here. [gives him a bar, which he eats] It stinks having diabetes sometimes, huh?
SCOTT
You seem to do alright.
SOPHIE
Still sucks. Kids don't know how much extra you have to do every day just to be okay.
SCOTT
Yeah.
SOPHIE
I'm glad there's a kid at my new school who I can talk about diabetes with.
SCOTT
You don't think I'm weird and gross?
SOPHIE
You know what? I don't think you're any weirder and grosser than any of the other boys in this town.
SCOTT
Wow. That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. I'm sorry you missed your show, Sophie. I don't know what happened, but somehow I feel like it's my fault.
SOPHIE
That's okay. I had an interesting night. I think I kind of like the Scott Malkinson Show.
[End of Basic Cable. "The Scott Malkinson Show" appears one last time, with a phone number to call for streaming right if anyone's interested: (719)838-4002. The cable repairmen run into view]
CLARK
Okay, we're here! Let's geh-aaah, shit! [they resume their walk, but slowly and out of view]
End of Basic Cable

synopsis:It’s a bleak Christmas Season in South Park this year and it’s all Santa’s fault. He is single handedly stealing the joy from the holiday. The town just wants their Christmas Spirit back but that will take a Christmas miracle.

script:Christmas Snow

[The season ends with a regular introduction. Then comes the first scene, A Christmas gathering at the town square. A stage is set up with a Christmas tree behind it. Mr. Mackey sings and plays piano while the Mayor waits her turn to speak..Families are present, but there are stands for wine, beer, and cocktails. Mr. Mackey sings "Happy Holidays" as the townsfolk enjoy their drinks.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Alright, everyone! Are we enjoying the festivities?! [the crowd cheers] Well, it's time for a very special guest now. Here he is, SANTA! [steps to her left as Santa approaches the podium.]
THE BOYS
Santa!
SANTA
[approahes with his arms up in the air.] Merry Christmas, everyone! This is the season for joy and giving. But let's also not forget that unfortunately, it's the season for accidents caused by drunk driving. [The cheering stops] Did you know that the holidays are when the most DUIs and drinking-related accidents occur?
TOWNSMAN 1
This is like that little Greta girl with the global warming. [cups his lips] BUZZ KILL! [boos begin to rise from the audience.]
SANTA
Please, be sure to celebrate the holiday season responsibly, because last holiday season [the boos get louder and louder] The-, the most drunk-driving accidents than ever bef-
TOWNSMAN 2
We're trying to have fun here, Santa!
SANTA
Okay, okay, Come on. All Santa is saying is that drinking and driving during the holidays-
MAYOR
[steps in and moves him to one side] Okay, thank you, Santa! That was wonderful and informative. Thank you for coming [Santa turns and walks offstage], everyone. We hope your and your loved ones enjoy all your favorite holiday traditions.
STEPHEN
Yeah! Let's drive! [everyone gets in their cars and drives off. Reckless driving everywhere to the tune of "Kay Thompson's Jingle Bells".]
[One couple fishtails it down the road, narrowly missing a head-on crash. The two drivers wave at each other. Two other cars almost crash at an intersection, but the red car stops and lets the other one by. The drivers wave at each other. The Valmers are driving home, each with a drink in hand, with Jimmy in the back seat. A driver in a green car rams into a fire hydrant, causing a geyser to rise up out of the ground. Another couple fishtails down the road. Five cars meet at an intersection and all narrowly miss each other. A driver in a purple car rams into a tree and is ejected from the car, dying instantly. One car with a mother and two kids stops in the middle of the street for no reason, and another car runs into it, causing collision damage. Five kids are on a hill waiting to slide down in snow tubes. A boy goes down and is run over by a car. and his snow tube is destroyed. A dog crosses the street and is shredded to bits by another car. The Stotches re driving home, with Butters in the back seat. Nothing happens there. Two other cars have a head-on collision in a residential street]
[Food 4 Little, next day. Shopping goes on as usual]
STEPHEN
[greeting two other shoopers] Mornin', Jim. Mornin', Kate.
JIM
Mornin', Stotch.
STEPHEN
You really tied one one last night, huh? Happy holidays.
[The liquor aisle. Jimbo, Liane, and the Whites look down the aidle, which is blocked off by a chain and a sign.]
JIMBO
What the hell's goin' on?
BOB
Uh we c-, we don't know.
STEPHEN
[walks up] Hey guys. [notices the chain and sign] The fuck is this?
JIMBO
There's like a... chain blocking the liquor aisle.
BOB
Maybe we can just go around to the other side. Come on! [they all go around the blockage to the other end, where they see the Blacks, the Tweeks, and Mr. Mackey.]
JIMBO
What the hell?
MR. MACKEY
I don't know. There's some sort of blockage in front of the booth section.
STEPHEN
But this is ridiculous. [tries to enter the aisle, but the chain stops him. He reaches to his left, then to his right, but can't reach the bottles.] Manager? Manager!
JASON, THE MANAGER
[arrives] Can I help you?
STEPHEN
Manager, there's a chain and sign blocking our way into the liquor aisle.
JASON
Yes. We can't sell liquor during the holidays. Somebody got a new county ordinance passed.
STEPHEN
What? Who has that kind of power?
JIMBO
It's Christmas, damnit! What are we supposed to drink?
JASON
You gotta just drink what ya have at your house.
STEPHEN
We drank it all before driving to the tree-lighting ceremony!
ALL
Yeah!
[South Park Village Liquor, moments later. The proprietor rolls down his security doog and locks up]
STEPHEN
Hey, woah woah woah, wait! Hold on!
PROPRIETOR
Sorry, everyone. I've been shut down until the New Year.
JIMBO
No! Not you too??
LIANE
You must have something you can give us.
PROPRIETOR
All I've got is this little bottle of peppermint schnapps, but it's barely enough form my drive home.
STEPHEN
[grabs the proprietor by the collar] I've got family coming over, from out of town! You can't expect me to be sober!
[Skeeter's Wine Bar, moments later. He's wiping down wine glasses at the corner when the other rush into the bar]
STEPHEN
Skeeter! Thank God you're still open. I've me a Cabernet, huh? And a couple of bottles to take home.
SKEETER
I've got lemonade, soft drinks, and tea. That's all I can sell until January 2nd.
RICHARD
Son of a bitch!
LIANE
This can't be happening.
JIMBO
Hey, come on, guys. It's still Christmas, and we have to make the best of it. How about we all drive around a little?
STEPHEN
Oh what's the point, Jimbo? What's the point in driving now?
[South Park, a day or two later. A children choir sings "Silent Night." The streets are barren - no one is driving or shopping. City Hall is shown in the background through a line of other buildings, with the Mayor and an aide looking out a window.]
MAYOR
Nobody's out shopping. The town is dead. Our economy depends on the holidays.
JANSON
We don't know who passed the ordinance, Mayor, but... well, the people feel left out.
MAYOR
There's only one thing we can do. We're going to have to ask an old friend for help... and hope that he somehow forgives us.
[Tegridy Farms, day. The snow is thick there now. A couple of city SUVs drive up. The drives one, Stephen drives the other. Everybody gets out and walks up to Randy's door. The Mayor knocks. The door opens and everyone is a bit shocked. Randy has let his beard grow out, and it's gray and white.]
RANDY
Hello, Mayor,... everybody. What are you doing here?
MAYOR
Mr. Marsh, South Park needs you.
RANDY
For what?
MAYOR
Everyone's down in the dumps. Nobody's buying presents or going to holiday events.
RICHARD
People... they need some holiday spirit.
MAYOR
We think that... a little weed might put everyone in a better mood.
RANDY
Guys, my season is over. Tegridy Farms' season ended weeks ago.
MAYOR
We understand, but couldn't you do like a limited-edition run just to get people through the holidays?
RANDY
...You want me to do a... Christmas special?
MAYOR
Yes. South Park needs Tegridy Farms.
STEPHEN
We all do, Randy.
RANDY
But guys, look behind you. [points at the barren fields; they turn and look] The crops are dead. How am I supposed to sell weed to people now?
MAYOR
I'll tell you how. [they turn back around] Because you're Randy Marsh, and there's one thing you have that nobody else does. Tegridy.
RANDY
Tegridy.
STEPHEN
You a-you're not gonna let a little cold weather stand in your way. Tegridy Farms is about community.
MRS. TWEEK
And community is what matters. That's Tegridy. That's Tegridy Weed.
RANDY
Well, you're right about that. Let me call my marijuana science specialist and.... I'll see what I can do.
MAYOR
Thank you, Marsh. May God bless Tegridy Farms.
[The barn at Tegridy Farms, night. The barn is ablaze in light. Towelie and Randy are in the barn. Randy paces back and forth while Towelie sits on a hay bale.]
TOWELIE
Look, I'm sorry, Randy, but marijuana just doesn't grow in the cold.
RANDY
So we use the greenhouse. There's gotta be a way to make a Christmas special. It's what everyone wants.
TOWELIE
[gets off the hay bale] Wwwait a minute. [walks off a bit] How about we repackage some of the surplus? [stands before three shelves of surplus, one for Mexican Joker, one for Halloween Special, and one for Season Finale. None of them are to be touched] I have lots of left-over Mexican Joker.
RANDY
That's 'cause people really didn't like Mexican Joker. I'm not gonna just repackage it. That's not special.
TOWELIE
Okay, so how about we combine- what's left of the Mexican Joker with some of the Season Finale?
RANDY
Nagh.
TOWELIE
What's wrong?
RANDY
[walks off] It's just... it needs [turns around] something else. Just mixing old product together and naming it something new? That's not special. [turns around, but immiediately turns back] And it's not Tegridy! [walks to the barn entrance and leans on it] It's just not Tegridy. [looks up at the stars and focuses on a pulsar] It's gonna be your birthday soon, Jesus. I wanna make something as special as you are. [gets pensive and pumps his fist.] I just need the right idea. [the wind picks up and he looks up again. A cloud comes up and blocks the star, and snow begins to fall. Randy raises his hands palms up, not knowing how to react]
[South Park Winter Rink. Kids ice-skate to "Blue Christmas" as the parents look on from outside the rink]
STEPHEN
I hate the holidays.
LINDA B.
Come on, Tolkien! Let!s wrap it up and get out of here! [the kid gather in front of the Christmas tree]
CRAIG
Dude, our parents seem really bummed out.
JIMMY
Yeah. It's like someone came and took all their Christmas ssssspirit.
CARTMAN
[skates into view.] This isn't good, you guys. You know what it means when our parents have no Christmas spirit? Shitty presents. We're screwed, you guys.
BUTTERS
Well they just gotta get their Christmas spirits back. They just gotta.
KENNY
[after a few seconds] (What's that?!) [a snow mobile is heard in the distance and it gets louder]
LIANE
[turns around] Look. [the other adults turn around. Randy pulls up in the snow mobiile pulling a sled full of the Christmas special, and honks his horn. Towelie comes down from the top of the load as Randy steps off the mobile]
RANDY
Well howdy there, folks.
GERALD
Randy?
RANDY
Heard you were all a little down and might need a boost. [bends his arms at the elbows and swings them], so I thought I'd bring you some [removes the tarp] Christmas Snow. [the camera pans across the cargo, showing jars of Tegridy weed covered in white powder. The crowd marvels at it and gathers around] Whoa whoa, there's enough for everybody. [the adults start taking jars of the stuff and paying Towelie for it]
STEPHEN
[opens his jar and sniffs] Oh wow, this smells great!
THOMAS
Hey, what's this white stuff on the top?
RANDY
Just a little somethin' extra for a special kick.
STEPHEN
Well, what are we waiting for, everyone? Let's do some driving! [the adults promptly get in their cars and start driving recklessly]
[Tegridy Farms, day.]
ANNOUNCER
Now, back to the Tegridy Farms Christmas Special.
[The Mayor bangs on Randy's door. Janson is with her. Randy answers the door and looks out]
RANDY
Oh, hi Mayor.
MAYOR
We need to talk, Marsh! [they head inside]
RANDY
What's going on? Are people not liking the Christmas special so far?
MAYOR
[eyes the weed carefully] Oh, people loooove the Christmas special. [picks up a jar] So, Marsh [turns around], what exactly is in this Christmas snow?
RANDY
Okay, okay, look, you busted us. It's a mix of different strains of marijuana we had left over from last season. I know, it's wrong...
MAYOR
Nonono, what is the white stuff on the marijuana?
RANDY
Oh that? That's cocaine.
MAYOR
WHAT???
RANDY
Yeah, I got the idea praying to Christ. You know, powder, snow, it's what gives Christmas Snow its kick. [gives Janson and the Mayor a tour of his small operation] Getting enough cocaine was the tricky part, so we started growing our own. Turns out the coca plant is even hardier than the marijuana plant. It can grow even when we're out of season.
MAYOR
What is wrong with you?! [Janson's jaw drops] We can't have you selling this stuff in town! COCAINE IS ILLEGAL!
RANDY
It is?? [he and Towelie look at each other and shrug]
MAYOR
Jesus Christ, you can't just give people coke without them knowing! We could all go to prison!
RANDY
Hey hey, it's not a big deal. I've been through this before. [being walking away] Hang on, I'll handle it. Don't go anywhere.
[Randy pulls away from the farm and goes to town. He stands outside a store collecting signatures to legalize cocaine. He walks around waving a "MAKE MEDICINAL COCAINE LEGAL NOW!" sign]
RANDY
Legalize it! Legalize it!
[He speaks before Congress, wish signs for cocaine for the terminally ill and for Alzheimers patients on either side. He opens a medicinal cocaine store and gets some news coverate. He returns to the store that started it all, with two clipboards and a sign now urging "Cocaine is for EVERYONE, not just sick people." He speaks at Coachella with a sign behind him: "THE DRUG WAR IS RACIST" He then leads a protest march. Then he returns home, where the Mayor and Janson are still waiting, and goes inside]
RANDY
Okay, cocaine's totally legal now.
MAYOR
It- it is? [reads the new law]
RANDY
Yeah, legal in seven states including this one, and other states are soon to follow. I told you. It's 2019, dawg.
[Santa's Workshop in South Park. A line of kids and their parents wait for Santa to show up. Next, Santa takes requests from Butters]
BUTTERS
I'm sorry, Santa, I just can't think of anything I want this year. Well I guess maybe now I'm losing my Christmas Spirit.
SANTA
Well, how about a little baby Yoda doll?
BUTTERS
Neah. Mandalorian was great the first few episodes, but it's really fallin' apart lately. [a car screeches off-screen, a woman screams, and a crash occurs, followed by shattering glass. Santa sets Butters down, gets up and walks forward a bit]
SANTA
What on earth?? [his arms spread out upon closer inspection]
DRIVER
[stumbles out of his car, slurring] Me-herry Christmas.
SANTA
What the-? How are people still drinking and driving??
WOMAN
[speaking a little quickly] Oh, they aren't drunk, Santa. Everyone's just enjoying this. [holds up a jar of Christmas Snow] Tegridy Farms Christmas Snow. It's organic, locally grown, and available now. [hands the jar to Santa]
TOWNSMAN (VOICE)
It's great, Santa.
MR. TESTABURGER
Oh, you gotta try it, Santa. It's really good.
TOWNSMAN 3
Yeah, try it. You gotta try it. It's amazing, Santa.
SANTA
Marijuana? This isn't what Santa meant! I got rid of liquor and now you assholes are all just getting high?! God-fucking-damnit! [smashes the jar into the ground, shattering it] Santa will just see about this! [storms off]
[Tegridy Farms, day. Randy and Towelie are busy packaging more Christmas Snow in the living room]
RANDY
Our Christmas special is so amazing, I don't know how we're gonna keep up with all the demand.
TOWELIE
I know. I know. I can't print labels fast enough.
RANDY
We need more help. We're never gonna get enough done in time. Hey Shelley! Hey Shelley! Hey Shelley!
SHELLEY
[walks into view] What?!
RANDY
Hey Shelley, can you help us make more labels for our Christmas special?
SHELLEY
No! I'm not helping you with your stupid blow. [walks out of view]
RANDY
Oh great. My daughter had a marijuana problem and now she has a problem with cocaine. [hears someone hammering at his front door] Ah. Must be more customers. [opens the door to see a man hammering a chain and sign across the entrance, same as the chain and sign at Foor 4 Little] What the hell is this?
WORKER
New ordinance's been passed by the county. No marijuana sales till after the holidays.
RANDY
Heheey, fuck you. Who has that kind of power?
WORKER
Look, I just do what I'm told, man. Happy holidays. [turns and walks down the steps and away] Hey, but eh, you can't do this. [closes the door and tells Towelie] They just dshut down our business.
TOWELIE
What are you talking about?
RANDY
We can't sell marijuana during the holidays.
TOWELIE
What are we gonna do?
RANDY
[walks off a bit] We can't give up on the Christmas special. People need it. I think I know a way around this.
[Tegridy Weed commercial, winter holiday version]
ANNOUNCER 2
[shots of Tegridy Farms in winter] There's somethin' 'bout the holiday season. [Towelie sits on the Tegridy Farms sign holding a candy cane with a bow on it, and waves at the camera.] Folks seem a little nicer. The days, a little more special. [a shot of a small gathering for a meal] And sometimes we all need a little pick-me-up without any added ingredients. [a shot of marijuana-free Christmas Snow] Introducing marijuana-free Christmas Snow from Tegridy Farms. [Randy pours out the blow in two lines on the dining table] All the festive snow you love, without that pesky marijuana. [Randy looks out over his fields and rests on a fence post] Because there's nothin' like a warm fire, holiday presents, [Randy is out in the field, grinning and licking his teeth.] and a little Rocky Mountain cocaine. [a couple of shots of couples sharing gifts] During Christmas, don't you want your cocaine to be organic, pure, and locally-grown? [four women throw confetti in the air, followed by a shot of someone snorting coke, then someone cutting it to their desired amount] Cocaine that's grown locally has never been smuggled, so the only ass it's gonna be up is yours. [another couple trades gifts, then the montage ends with a jar of Christmas Snow] Marijuana-free Christmas Snow, now available from Tegridy Farms. It's cocaine that's farm to nostril.
[A shot of driving habits under this drug. Then, a shot of the boys sitting on the steps in front of City Hall watching it all]
CARTMAN
Boy, people sure have the holiday spirit now.
KYLE
Yeah, what the hell happened?
JIMMY
It's weird, though. My parents have a lot of holiday spirit, but they sleep until three in the afternoon every day.
CRAIG
Yeah. Last night, my mom had a ton of holiday spirit and then passed out. She hasn't gone to buy me any presents.
CARTMAN
Butters, your mom has so much holiday spirit that she's riding an ATV with her tits out. [Butters' jaw drops as he sees his mom approaching the boys doing that that.]
LINDA STOTCH
Christmas. Woo-oo-ooo.
BUTTERS
Yeah, that's a little too much holiday spirit, if you ask me.
[Town Square, day. Randy has a booth set up, ""Tegridy Farms Marijuana-Free Christmas Snow. He and Towelie are taking orders from two lines of people]
RANDY
There you are, ma'am. There you are, sir. This is amazing, Towelie. Tegridy Farms is finally gonna make all the money I ever dreamed of.
SANTA
[showing up] What the Sam Hell is going on here?! [the clients begin answering. Santa takes a jar from one of them] Marijuana-free Christmas Snow? Do you realize that tomorrow is Christmas Eve?!
STEPHEN
And it's gonna be the best Christmas ever! [the sound of wheels screeching is heard, and all turn to see what it is. A woman is heard screaming, then the impact, then shattering glass. Then cheers as two wrecked cars are shown, the drivers clearly under the influence]
FEMALE DRIVER
Happy holidays! Woo!
[The rooftops, night. Santa slinks from house to house, going down chimneys and confiscating the jars of Christmas Snow. The first house he visits has a table with a jar of coke, six lines of coke, two razor blades, a straw made from a dollar bill, and a small mound of coke on it. He takes it all and swipes it into his sack. Next he visits the Stotch house, into the master bedroom, looks in Linda's nightstand and removes two tiny packets of coke, then takes a jar from the Christmas tree and another jar from the medicine cabinet in the bathroom. He goes to Mackey's bed and takes the jar from Mackey's hands while Mackey sleeps. Mackey has some coke on his nostrils, but Santa leaves that alone. Santa then goes to the Broflovski house and takes the jars from the tree. He notices Ike looking on, gives him some milk, and sends him back upstairs. He sweeps a bunch of coke in baggies off a table, takes a jar from another tree, then reaches Tegridy Farms itself. He goes to the ban and puts every jar he sees into his sack. He throws the sack onto his sleigh and urges the reindeer to get moving.]
SANTA
Santa to base, come in.
ELF
This is base. Go ahead, Santa.
SANTA
Sleigh is too loaded down to fly. Gonna have to take the roads until I can find a place to dump all this blow. [hears Randy honking behind him and turns to make sure]
RANDY
[coming up fast on his snowmobile] Hold on tight, Towelie! We have to save Christmas! [Santa faces forward and brings down the whip on the reindeer a few times. The race is on. Santa looks over his shoulder, then notices something ahead]
SANTA
Oh shit! [runs through a guard rail and over a cliff.] Ho ho ho!
RANDY
O-ho! [follows Santa over the cliff] Ohhhhh!
[South Park, day. Stephen looks around for his Christmas Snow in the bathroom]
STEPHEN
The hell is...? Did you do all my marijuana-free Christmas snow?
LINDA
[appears at the bathroom door] I was just gonna ask you the same thing.
STEPHEN
What are you talking about?
LINDA
Mine's all gone. You had another bander last night, didn't you?
STEPHEN
No! [points at her] Clearly you did!
[The Tucker house. Thomas hears some pounding at his door and goes to answer it and sees Stephen and Linda.]
STEPHEN
Thomas, we were just wondering if we could borrow a little Christmas Snow.
THOMAS
You can't find yours either?? My wife's been searching all morning. [in the kitchen, Laura dumps the trash onto the floor and starts looking through it]
LAURA
The trash. We must have thrown it in the trash. It has to be here somewhere.
[Eventually, all the residents gather in the street and chat about the missing Snow]
BOB
Alright listen. Somebody obviously took everyone else's snow and it's not cool! Come on. it's Christmas!
STEVE
Somebody has to have a little. I feel like total shit.
MR. MACKEY
It's gone, okay?! Just face it, it's all gone!
[The cliff bottom, day. Santa looks through the wreckage that was his sleigh.]
SANTA
[to the head elf] This is Santa. The sleigh still isn't functional. Got some of it repaired, but I don't think I'm gonna make it back in time for Christmas. [Randy appears behind him and walks up]
RANDY
Hey Santa. We need to talk.
SANTA
Stay back, mutherfucker!
RANDY
Santa, you don't understand.
SANTA
Oh, Santa understands plenty! You assholes drink and drive and you think marijuana is somehow different, go driving around on that, and then you go and make this shit!
RANDY
Santa, that's not just cocaine. It's Tegridy cocaine.
SANTA
Oh, don't give Santa that! Coke is coke! [turns away]
RANDY
That's not true! This cocaine is grown locally. By local people. Please, just try it!
SANTA
Santa's done coke before. Santa knows what-
RANDY
Please! [Santa pauses, takes a dash of coke, and sniffs t]
SANTA
It's, it's cocaine. Just like every other cocaine Santa's ever tried. You people really think that the holidays are- Okay, yeah, that's pretty good. But it doesn't matter! Because Christmas is a- Wow, that is really clean.
RANDY
Right?
SANTA
It's like not speedy at all. It's really mellow. [walks to a log and sits down] Honestly, I didn't think cocaine could be this pure, wow.
RANDY
[joins him] Because it's grown here. On a farm. It's not cut with any nasty chemicals or harmful impurities. [hands Santa a metal sheet and a thin pipe]
SANTA
No, you can tell. It's really clean. Santa likey. [sniffs up some more coke] Maybe I have been a little too old-fashioned in my thinking.
JESUS
I can't believe what I'm hearing! [they look up and see Jesus approaching]
SANTA
Oh Jesus.
JESUS
I have heard your prayers, Marsh! And I've been watching. You want people to think that home-grown cocaine is the same as legalizing marijuana?
SANTA
Jesus, you really gotta try it.
JESUS
No!
SANTA
You cut out the middle man, nobody dies in South America, nobody dies from impurities [sniff].
RANDY
Please, Jesus.
JESUS
[Takes a tray and straw, and sniffs the coke.] Okay, I get it. It's really clean. It's... yeah. It's a good high.
SANTA
It's fucking pure.
RANDY
It's Tegridy.
JESUS
Well, maybe we all do need a little Tegridy at Christmas time. [walks up to the sleigh]
SANTA
What are you doing, Jesus?
JESUS
I think it's time for a little Christmas miracle. [lifts out three sacks of Christmas Snow and disperses the snow all over town. Adults begin noticing the blow and tasting it.]
TOWNSMAN 4
[tastes the blow settling on his hand] Hey. Hey. Hey, everybody!
MR. MACKEY
[in the town square] Try to catch some on your tongue. It's fun.
CARTMAN
Does this mean you all have the Christmas spirit again?
STEPHEN
You're darn tootin' we do!
RANDY
Hey guys, I'm so happy my Christmas Special turned out okay.
SANTA
It's more than okay. Tegridy cocaine is smooth and has a great finish.
JESUS
I'll bet when coke becomes legal soon, everyone will want Tegridy Cocaine!
STEPHEN
Well, only one thing left to do, gang. Let's go driving!
ALL
Yeah! [they get into their cars and start driving recklessly again]
ANNOUNCER 2

End of Christmas Snow
