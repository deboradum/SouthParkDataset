script:Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina

[Trinidad Medical Center, day. A very modern, futuristic-looking building is seen behind the sign. Inside, a doctor approaches a patient]
DOCTOR
Hello, Mr. Garrison, I'm Dr. Biber. I'll be performing your surgery today.
MR. GARRISON
[on the hospital bed, his legs in stirrups] God bless you, Doctor. I know you'll make me well again.
DR. BIBER
Now, you're absolutely sure you want a vaginoplasty?
MR. GARRISON
My whole life I've been a woman trapped in a man's body. A sex-change operation is my last chance at happiness.
DR. BIBER
All right, then let's begin. [POV changes to Mr. Garrison looking down past his groin. A nurse hands Dr. Biber a scalpel] Just relax, Mr. Garrison. I think if more people could just see a sex-change operation, they would know how perfectly natural it is. The first thing I'm going to do is slice your balls. [bends down to slice open Mr. Garrison's nutsack - a live slice is shown]
MR. GARRISON
Ough, ergh. Eww. [his eyes remain shut for the duration of the operation]
DR. BIBER
With the scrotum open, I can now discard of your testicles.
MR. GARRISON
So long, balls. [the vas deferens is shown being cut in two, severing the testicle from the rest of the body. A nurse dabs Dr. Biber's forehead with a towel to remove any sweat there]
DR. BIBER
Now, I'll just continue the incision up the shaft of the penis. [real-life footage is shown]
MR. GARRISON
Oh, that stings.
DR. BIBER
Now, I'll just... turn your... penis inside out.
MR. GARRISON
OH! Oh jeez.
DR. BIBER
All we need to do now is ...stuff the ...unskinned penis inside your... pelvis... And now I'll use the skin from your penis to make vaginal lips.
MR. GARRISON
Do I look like a woman?
DR. BIBER
[reviewing the results, then holds up his left thumb] Pretty much.
[Denver Convention Center, day. All-State Basketball Tryouts are being held there. TODAY! Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny show up courtside through entrance 51A. Kyle, #4, is in South Park Elementary's basketball uniform.]
STAN
Dude, don't be nervous.
KYLE
How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years.
STAN
You're the best player at our school, dude. You'll make the team for sure.
CARTMAN
This is ridiculous. Jews can't play basketball.
KYLE
[points right at Cartman] I beat out YOUR fat ass, Cartman! [a referee's whistle is heard]
LEAD REFEREE
All students trying out for the All-State team to center court! [Kyle heads for center court]
STAN
Good luck. [Kyle reaches center court and is flanked by tall black players on either side. He looks around, seeing how much taller these players are than he. Two of them have basketballs; Kyle has his own ball]
COACH
All right boys, now you're all here because you're the best of the best. [the camera pans from left to right, showing all the players - and Kyle's head from the nose up] I know that you've all worked really hard to make it this far, so let's get out there and [throws a basketball at someone] SHOW ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT! [play begins, and the taller players keep the ball away from Kyle, then drive toward one of the baskets. Number 32 slams the ball through the hoop. They drive to the opposite basket. Kyle has the ball and shoots, but his shot is rejected. The players head back to the first basket] Uh, uh excuse me, Brof-Broflovski, is it?
KYLE
Yeah?
COACH
Can we talk to you for a minute? [Kyle leaves the court and reaches the coach] You uh... You're the best player in your school, are ya?
KYLE
Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day.
COACH
Yeah. Uh, look, kid, you've got great skills and a great attitude. But you're just not physically ...built for the game.
KYLE
Oo whataya mean?
COACH
Well, it's just that... Jew's can't play basketball. [blows his whistle and returns to the other players] Awright, kids, we've gotta work on that shooting! Come on!
[Kyle heads out through 56A but puts his head against a wall, deeply saddened. Kenny, Stan and Cartman enter 56A from the concession stands and head towards Kyle]
STAN
Dude, you were awesome, Kyle. [no response. Stan looks at Kenny, then looks back at Kyle] Look, y-you gave it your best shot, right? That's all you could do. [looks at Kenny, shrugs, and walks away. Kenny walks over, puts his hand on Kyle's shoulder for consolation, then walks away. Cartman looks a bit concerned, walks over to Kyle... and taunts him!]
CARTMAN
Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! You-hoo-hoo-hoo loh-ost! Hahahahahaaahaaa! [No response. Cartman can't get a rise out of Kyle] Kyle, I'm totally ripping on you at a totally inappropriate time.
KYLE
I know. I deserve it.
CARTMAN
Yeah, you know why? Because Jews can't play basketball!
KYLE
You're right. [this disarms Cartman completely, and he walks away]
CARTMAN
Jesus, that's no fun.
[Henry's Supermarket, day. A normal shopping day until...]
MAN
[bursts through the main entrance] Hey everybody, you're not gonna believe it!
RANDY
Believe what?
MAN
It's Mr. Garrison! Only it ISN'T Mr. Garrison! He- He's a woman now! [the doors open again and Mr. Garrison struts in with a new womanly body and purse. He strikes a pose to show off his womanly ass. From here on, he's Mrs. Garrison]
MRS. GARRISON
Hello everybody! [everyone is shocked. She goes further into the store and approaches two female shoppers] Can you believe it, ladies? I'm one of YOU now! [hugs them, then heads to the Feminine Hygiene aisle] Wow, just look at all these tampons! Regular, heavy flow- Oh boy, I can't wait till I get my first period! [trots off.]
[The ladies' restroom, moments later. Mrs. Garrison enters humming and takes an empty spot along the sinks.]
MRS. GARRISON
Hi gals! [opens her purse and begins putting on makeup] Oh boy, can you believe the sales they're havin' out there? Well, I'm about to pee out my vagina for the first time. [hugs them] Give us a hug. Girls' Club! [lets them go and goes into a stall, closes the door, drops her pants and sits down. She urinates. The two ladies at the sink look at one another, then towards the stall] Oh wow! This is great! Look at that, I'm peeing sittin' down like a dainty dignified little woman! [begins to fart and poop. The women's jaws drop] Sany, any of you ladies wanna go see a sad movie together? [The women present leave the restroom one by one: the blonde first, then the one with light brown hair, then the one exiting the stall left of Mrs. Garrison holding her nose, then the one exiting the stall right of Mrs. Garrison holding her nose. The farting and pooping is just too much] You guys try those new wings tampons? Do those work well?
[South Park, day. A South Park Charter Transit bus stops and lets Stan and his friends off. Kyle walks ahead of them in gloomy silence]
STAN
Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you aren't built right for basketball.
KYLE
But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do. [Mrs. Garrison appears before them]
MRS. GARRISON
Hello, boys! It's me, your teacher! Mrs. Garrison! [her fingers are fanned out and she strikes that pose again. The boys are stunned]
CARTMAN
You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties.
MRS. GARRISON
[moving her hands over her body as if shedding a layer of skin] I had a sex-change operation. My penis is now a vagina and I'm experiencing womanhood for the first time in my life! See ya in class! [saunters off]
[Kyle's house, dinner time. The family is at the table eating]
KYLE
Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation?
GERALD
[taken aback] What? Th'um, nuh-nothing. I- I'll explain it to you when you're a little older.
KYLE
But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come?
IKE
Penis!
GERALD
Your teacher had a sex change?? Oh my God! [buries his face in his hands]
IKE
Vagina!
GERALD
That does it! I'm taking you boys OUT OF THAT SCHOOL! [sweeps his left arm across the table]
SHEILA
Gerald, that is very closed-minded of you! You shouldn't judge people who want to change.
GERALD
He's a teacher! How are we supposed to explain this to our children?!
SHEILA
[walks over and stands behind Kyle] It's very simple. [addresses Kyle] You see, Kyle, sometimes a person' outside doesn't reflect who they are on the inside.
KYLE
Yeah. That's right.
SHEILA
They feel like they're somebody trapped in another person's body. And so, they can have a surgery [Kyle smiles and passes his hands over parts of his body he'd change] that makes them more into the person they see themselves as. Do you understand?
KYLE
Totally! I totally understand!
SHEILA
There. You see, Gerald? He totally understands.
[Trinidad Medical Center, day. Dr. Biber sits behind his desk]
DR. BIBER
So, I hear you're interested in reconstructive surgery.
KYLE
Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one.
DR. BIBER
Oh yes, Mr. Garrison. Uh yes, he had a vaginoplasty. Mhm.
KYLE
Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?
DR. BIBER
Sure. You see sometimes a woman wants to be a man. That procedure is called a peniplasty.
KYLE
No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black.
DR. BIBER
...You what?
KYLE
I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man.
DR. BIBER
[tries to make sense of this in his mind, then] Ohhhhh! You want a negroplasty!
KYLE
Yeah! [big grin]
STAN
Wha-a-a negroplasty??
DR. BIBER
It's a fairly common procedure, really, just the reverse of a caucasioplasty just like Michael Jackson had. Let's take a look here. [Kyle follows Dr. Biber. Stan tails along. Dr. Biber stops and bends down towards Kyle, taking off his hat] What we do is slice your face and peel it back so we can insert now pigment producing cells inside. [draws a line along Kyle's forehead and left temple. Stan can't believe what he's seeing] We break the arm bones in several places and put braces to make them longer. [draws lines around the wrists] Now, the knees we need to snap off and fill with small round objects that can cause better movement. [draws two circles around the kneecaps] And we finish it off with a nice peniplasty to enhance the genitalia. [draws a circle around the crotch of Kyle's briefs] Negroplasty takes about seven hours and costs roughly three thousand dollars.
STAN
Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea?
DR. BIBER
Well, it's a good idea if you wanna be tall and black. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.
[Mrs. Garrison's house, night. Mrs. Garrison enters the kitchen carrying groceries. Mr. Slave is at the breakfast table moping]
MRS. GARRISON
Hello, Mr. Slave. [sets them down on the counter] Boy have I been busy. A woman's work is never done. [begins taking the groceries out of the bags] I got some tampons. I should be getting my period really soon. I hope I don't get too emotional and drive you crazy with my PMS. [walks over to Mr. Slave hiding something behind her back, and says seductively] Mr. Slave, I got something for us, too. [brings forth a red negligéйe] Would you like to take this beautiful woman to bed?
MR. SLAVE
No thanks.
MRS. GARRISON
[taken aback] Nu- no thanks? Come on, Mr. Slave, I wanna try out my new snootch.
MR. SLAVE
I can't believe you just went ahead and had that surgery without even asking me what I thought.
MRS. GARRISON
Well, I ASSUMED you supported me. It's still me; I just have a vagina instead of a penis.
MR. SLAVE
But I'm gay! I don't like vaginas!
MRS. GARRISON
Don't you even care that I was suffering? I wasn't happy the way I was!
MR. SLAVE
It's great that you feel better, but you never stopped to think about how other people around you would feel!
MRS. GARRISON
Look, we can still be together. All you have to do is stop being gay!
MR. SLAVE
How can you say that?! You're gay too!
MRS. GARRISON
I'm not gay! I'm a woman!
MR. SLAVE
Oh, Jesus Christ! [turns around and heads for the front door]
MRS. GARRISON
Oh, so is that it?! [Mr. Slave opens the front door and walks out, leaving it open] You're just gonna walk out?! You men are all alike! Go ahead and find somebody who doesn't have a vagina, you fag! [slams his door shut]
[Kyle's house, morning. Kyle runs into the living room with a paper in hand and faces his parents, who are sitting on the sofa. They're both reading the newspaper.]
KYLE
Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black. [they look up. On Gerald's T-shirt is a picture of two dolphins jumping in the air]
SHEILA
What??
KYLE
Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery. [shows the paper, which is a picture of ]
GERALD
Oh, just great! You see, Sheila?! This is what your transgender progressive thinking gets you! Now your son wants to be transracial!
KYLE
[quite excited] Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??
SHEILA
Absolutely not, Kyle!
KYLE
[let down] But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.
SHEILA
Yes, but Kyle-
KYLE
Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside.
SHEILA
Kyle, you have to accept your body the way it is.
KYLE
Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it?
SHEILA
The answer is NO, Kyle! You're NOT going to have negroplasty!
KYLE
But Jews can't play basketball! [this sets Gerald off and making him furious]
GERALD
KYLE, YOU'D BETTER STOP BEING ANTI-SEMITIC RIGHT NOW, MISTER!!
KYLE
[leaves the room and goes up the stairs, stopping halfway] I'm never speaking to either of you ever again! [continues up the stairs and goes to his room. His door is heard being shut. Gerald looks on as all this happens]
GERALD
[rises and leaves the sofa] Oh, that does it!
SHEILA
Where are you going?!
GERALD
[stops by the coat rack next to the front door, grabs his coat and puts it on] That Dr. Biber is about to get his ass bitten off! [goes out the front door and slams it shut]
[Trinidad Medical Center, day. Gerald approaches it with a file in hand. He enters Dr. Biber's office and closes the door. The doctor is setting behind his desk]
GERALD
Who the hell do you think you are?!
DR. BIBER
Dr. Biber.
GERALD
What kind of nutjob would agree to surgically alter my son into a tall African-American?!
DR. BIBER
[leaves his chair and approaches Gerald] Oh, you're Kyle's father.
GERALD
Huh that's right! And I also happen to be a lawyer! And I'm gonna have you sued for malpractice, and your clinic shut down!!
DR. BIBER
What is that on your shirt?
GERALD
What th- Look, they're- They're dolphins! Why?
DR. BIBER
Ahhh you like dolphins, hm? [puts his hands together in an affectionate way]
GERALD
A b--uh I love dolphins, Ever since I was a child I dreamt of... Huh b-b-b- But that has hardly any bearing on what I'm hear to-
DR. BIBER
I can make you one.
GERALD
...What?
DR. BIBER
Invert the back, move the esophagus to the top of the head. Yes, a full dolphinoplasty could be achieved relatively simply...
GERALD
[steps aside a little] Make me a... dolphin? [begins to daydream about life as a dolphin.]
SINGER
If I could swim with the dolphins, the soft and gentle dolphins...Why can't I swim with the dolphins?
GERALD
...No. [heads for the door] No, no, it's crazy.
DR. BIBER
There's nothing crazy about a person wanting to look on the outside the way they feel on the inside.
[Girls Gone Wild commercial. In the background is a crowd of men, in the foreground, willing women]
ANNOUNCER
It's Girls Gone Wild! [two women stand there looking at the camera, then lift their blouses all of a sudden and giggle. The words "Real Girls!" flash over their breasts] These girls will do anything! [another woman looks around, then flashes her breasts. The word "Wild!!" flashes over them. Two other women flash their boos. "Out of Control!" flashes over one woman, "Real Girls!" over the other. Mrs. Garrison sees an opportunity and comes forward to stand next to the women]
MRS. GARRISON
Oh jeez, should I do it?! Should I do it?! Oh what the hell! [flashes her boobs, which are not bleeped. They're set rather far apart. The other women look at the breasts and leave in disgust] Wooo! Huhuh, wooo!
MEN
Awww!
MRS. GARRISON
Look, I'll giggle and make them bounce up and down! [jumps up and down] Heeheeheeheehee, heeheeheeheeheeheehee.
[Later, at a bar after the video shoot...]
MRS. GARRISON
[walks up to the bar, which has three women seated at it. One of them is a redhead with short, wavy hair] Oh boy, men will do just about anything to get a look at our tits, won't they? Men are all the same. My boyfriend walked out on me! Turns out he was a fag. But I've been livin' it up ever since, havin' sex with all kinds of different guys! Girl power! [approaches the redhead] You know, the strange thing is, I haven't gotten my period yet. Is there a reason a woman might miss her period?
REDHEAD
Well, normally, if a woman misses her period, it means she's pregnant.
MRS. GARRISON
...Pregnant? [turns away and walks a bit] Oh my God. Of course. [the women at the bar glance back at him] I haven't gotten to experience a period because... one of those truckers I slept with got me knocked up. [turns around and shouts] I'm pregnant, everybody! Hoh boy, now I can have an abortion! [leaves the bar]
[Kyle's house, night. Gerald returns home with a walker and a highly altered appearance. He now makes dolphin sounds and has a blowhole and dorsal fin on his back, and his legs have been joined together to make a flipper. His hands have been altered to look like ventral fins. He walks in the front door. His eyes are black from the alterations and his nose has been elongated.]
SHEILA
[seeing the new Gerald] Gerald! What happened to you?!
GERALD
That doctor is a miracle worker, Sheila. Iiii'm the happiest I've ever been. [approaches Ike] Look, Ike! You're daddy's a dolphin! [Ike just looks at him]
SHEILA
A dolphin?!?!
GERALD
[turns around slowly to face her] Sheila, ih-it was wrong of us to be so judgmental of Kyle. If he isn't happy with who he is, then who are we to deny hm surgery that will make him feel better about himself? [his left eye twitches twice, each time accompanied by dolphin calls]
SHEILA
[distraught] Gerald, this is crazy!
GERALD
I used to think I was crazy. But Dr, Biber told me that there are a lot of other people out there who are transspecies. All I did is change my appearance to look the way I felt... [places his right ventral fin to his heart] here. And I'm telling you now that if we don't let Kyle do the same, he may never be happy. Ever! We owe him more than that, Sheila. We owe him understanding! [his blowhole goes off]
[The school bus stop, day. Stan, Kenny, and Cartman work on building a snowman. Butters runs up...]
BUTTERS
Fellas! Hey fellas, you gotta come see!
STAN
What?
BUTTERS
Uhh, it's Kyle! Huh, he's a Negro! [runs off. The others follow.]
[Kyle's house, later. Kyle, now tall and black, stands in the front lawn. Around him are Kevin, Clyde, Jason, Tweek, and Craig]
JASON
Wow.
CRAIG
Can't believe it.
CLYDE
Did it hurt?
KYLE
Yeah, but it was totally worth it. [Butters arrives with the other boys]
STAN
Jesus Christ, dude!
KYLE
Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!
GERALD
[at the front door] Come on, Kyle, we should get going!
KYLE
Alright, Dad! [trots off]
STAN
Dude, is Kyle's- dad a- dolphin?
CARTMAN
He's a Jewish dolphin. A Jewphin.
[Planned Parenthood, day. In the reception area Mrs. Garrison reads magazines, but sees a woman seated near her.]
MRS. GARRISON
You here for an abortion too? [she blinks] Yeah, I discovered a few days ago I wasn't bleedin' out my coo, so I guess I'm knocked up. Is this doctor any good?
NURSE
Mrs... Garrison?
MRS. GARRISON
Oh, that's me. [rises and follows the nurse in]
[Planned Parenthood OR.]
MRS. GARRISON
Hello doctor, looks like I need an abortion. [sits on the chair and puts his feet on the stirrups]
DOCTOR
...an abortion?
MRS. GARRISON
Yeah, I've got one growing inside me. Now, are you gonna scramble its brains or just vacuum it out? [a nurse arrives and her jaw drops] ...If you want you can just scramble it and I'll queef it out myself.
DOCTOR
Mmister Garrison-
MRS. GARRISON
[correcting him] Mrs. Garrison.
DOCTOR
Mmrs. Garrison, you can't have an abortion.
MRS. GARRISON
Don't you tell me what I can and can't do with my body! [gets up, goes to the nurse, and hugs her] A woman has a right to choose!
DOCTOR
No, I mean you're physically unable to have an abortion, because you can't get pregnant.
MRS. GARRISON
But I missed my period.
DOCTOR
You can't have periods either. [Mrs. Garrison looks surprised] You had a sex change, Mr. Garrison, but you don't have ovaries or a womb. You don't produce eggs.
MRS. GARRISON
[sits down] You mean, I'll never know what it feels like to have a baby growing inside me and then scramble its brains and vacuum it out?
DOCTOR
N-that's right.
MRS. GARRISON
But I paid five thousand dollars to be a woman. This would mean I I'm not really a woman. Ih, I'm just a... a I'm just a guy with a mutilated penis!
DOCTOR
Basically, yes.
MRS. GARRISON
...Oh boy, do I feel like a jackass.
[Trinidad Medical Center, day. Mrs. Garrison enters the OR as Dr. Biber operates on a woman]
MRS. GARRISON
Hey asshole!
DR. BIBER
Excuse me, I'm performing an operation here!
MRS. GARRISON
You told me you were going to make me into a woman!
DR. BIBER
I gave you a sex change.
MRS. GARRISON
Yeah?! Well what kind of woman can't have abortions and bleed out her snatch once a month?! You made me into a FREAK is what you did! And I want you to change me back!
PATIENT
Am I a man yet?
DR. BIBER
Mr. Garrison, I can't reattach your organs.
MRS. GARRISON
Why the hell not?!
DR. BIBER
Because I've already used your testicles to fashion new knees for a little boy who wanted to be tall and black.
MRS. GARRISON
You WHAT?!
DR. BIBER
And your scrotum has been made into a dorsal fin for a man who wanted to look more like a dolphin.
MRS. GARRISON
Oh you! You're comin' with me right now to find my balls and scrotum right now, Mr. Man! [pulls him out the door by the ear]
[Denver Convention Center, night. "All-State Playoffs. Colorado vs. Wyoming" People crowd into the center. Inside, the two teams are practicing their shots on the court]
ANNOUNCER
Welcome to the All-State Basketball Playoffs between the best fourth-grade players from Colorado and the best fourth-grade players from Wyoming. [cheers go up and Kyle arrives just in time]
KYLE
[panting] Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play.
COACH
Who are you?
KYLE
Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now?
COACH
Well, you're tall and black enough. All right, Broflovski, suit up!
KYLE
All right! [turns around and looks up the bleachers] Dad, I can play! [Gerald is on the steps with his walker]
GERALD
Alright Kyle! [tries to find a place to sit. An usher walks by] Excuse me, where do you have special seating for dolphins?
[The school bus stop, day. Stan, Cartman and Kenny are almost finished with their snow man. A car pulls up. Mrs. Garrison and Dr. Biber jump out of the car.]
MRS. GARRISON
Boys, have you seen Kyle?! He's not at home.
STAN
[points down the road] Kyle went down to play in the basketball game, Mrs. Garrison.
DR. BIBER
He's going to play basketball? Oh my God.
MRS. GARRISON
What?
DR. BIBER
Well, ah I only made him look like he could play basketball. If he actually does it, the testicle in his knees will explode! [Mrs. Garrison realizes instantly where her former testicles are]
STAN
What?! But you made him into a basketball player.
DR. BIBER
No, I just made him look more like one. We have to stop him from playing! Those testicles in his knees are ticking time balls!
MRS. GARRISON
Oh Jesus! Come on, boys! We've gotta get to my balls before Kyle hurts himself! [everyone gets into the car, and the car peels off]
[Denver Convention Center, night. The Star-Spangled Banner is being sung]
SINGER
...and the home of the... brave! [the lights come up and everyone cheers. The teams take the floor for the jump ball. The referee tosses the ball up and Colorado #32 taps the ball to his team]
COACH
Broflovski, be ready to take over for Owens.
KYLE
I'm a hundred percent ready, coach! [The stitches along his upper chest, arms, and cheeks are seen. The camera pans down to show the bandages on his elbows and knees and the stitches along his legs]
[Denver Convention Center, by the restrooms in the hall. An usher stands nearby]
GERALD
Eh excuse me, where, where is the bathroom for dolphins?
USHER
We don't... have one.
GERALD
Well where the hell am I supposed to go to the bathroom? I I need a large tank with salt water.
USHER
Ahhh- Too bad?
GERALD
Damnit you people have to make special arrangements for transspecies people like me! I may be a dolphin, but I'm also a lawyer!
USHER
You're a lawphin?
[Denver Convention Center, outside, by the entrance. Mrs. Garrison, Dr. Biber and the boys approach the doors]
USHER
Tickets please.
MRS. GARRISON
We don't have tickets!
SECURITY GUARD
[appearing next to the usher] Sorry ma'am, no tickets, no entry.
MRS. GARRISON
Look, there's a boy with my balls in his knees and he's in serious danger!
USHER
What?
MRS. GARRISON
[looks past the men and points] My scrotum! [he sees Gerald talking to the usher by the restrooms] That dolphin has my scrotum! Now let us in!
SECURITY GUARD
You can't go in, ma'am! [Mrs. Garrison delivers a right hook to the guard and the guard goes down. Mrs. Garrison and the others rush in. The guard gets up and calls for help on his walkie-talkie] We have unauthorized entry on level one!
[Denver Convention Center, courtside. The Colorado team drives to the opposite basket. The coach addresses Kyle]
COACH
All right. Broflovski, you're going in next possession.
KYLE
All right! [stands and feels pain in his knees. He soothes them] Ow. Hm. [goes to the locker room]
[Denver Convention Center, by the restrooms. Mrs. Garrison and the others approach Gerald]
MRS. GARRISON
Gerald, where's Kyle?!
GERALD
What? Why??
MRS. GARRISON
My balls are in his knees. If he jumps with them they'll explode!
GERALD
Oh my God! [Security guards swarm nearby]
SECURITY GUARD
There they are, next to that dolphin!
DR. BIBER
Come on, we've gotta get to those balls! [The group rushes into the arena; the guards chase them and open fire]
SECURITY GUARD
[the one who tried to stop them at the door] Stop them! They didn't pay the two-dollar entry fee!
[Denver Convention Center, courtside. Kyle has suited up and now enters the game.]
ANNOUNCER
Now substituting for Colorado, number 4, Kyle Broflovski. [Kyle goes in for #11, Owens. Stan and the others run down the steps towards the court, pursued by the guards.]
STAN
Oh Jesus, he's about to play! [Three of the guards get into position at the top of the stariway aisle and start shooting at them. Down by the court Dr. Biber takes a steel trash can and bashes one guard with it]
GERALD
[wrestles another guard over his walker] Mrs. Garrison, grab Kyle!
MRS. GARRISON
Which one is he?? [camera zooms out to show Colorado taking the ball and driving to the other basket. Kyle isn't seen in the shot. At the other end, Mrs. Garrison tackles a Wyoming player. The crowd gasps]
WYOMING COACH
Hey, what the hell?!
GERALD
Stop the game! [jumps high into the air and mows down a bunch of player upon landing. More gasps from the crowd. The loose ball ends up in Kyle's hands]
KYLE
I got it! I got the ball. [runs to his basket]
STAN
Kyle, NO! [Kyle dribbles and then jumps up towards the basket]
ANNOUNCER
Broflovski goes for the dunk!
MRS. GARRISON
NO! [the dunk is shown in smooth slow-motion, as is his next statement] My baaaallllssss. [the ball goes in, Kyle lands back on the floor, his knees bulge, then blow out, spraying testicles matter everywhere. His legs split in two at the knee and he falls backwards. Players on both teams and some of the spectators are hit by bits of testicle. Kyle is unconscious and the Colorado coach screams and runs off]
[Denver Convention Center, outside. The police and paramedics have arrived and Kyle is sitting up on the gurney]
OFFICER
So let me get this straight. That woman over there was trying to get to her balls which were in the knees of a black child whose father is a dolphin.
STAN
Yeah, that's basically it.
OFFICER
Sounds like an open and shut case. All right, let's head 'em out! [the police leave]
DR. BIBER
I'm sorry, Kyle, I should have told you the surgery was cosmetic only.
GERALD
So, does this mean I'm not really a dolphin?
DR. BIBER
Let's get you two up to the clinic and I'll change you back, for a nominal fee.
KYLE
But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back.
MRS. GARRISON
[thinks about that for a long moment] You know what? I'm okay. Even though I'm not truly a woman, I think I still like the new me. I'd rather be a woman who can't have periods than a fag. [newly confident] Hey guys! This girl is staying a woman! Who wants to pound my vadge! Girl power!
End of Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina

synopsis:When hippie drum circles start popping up in people's attics and backyards the citizens of South Park have no choice but to turn to Eric Cartman for help.

script:Die Hippie, Die

[An elderly woman's home. Cartman rings her doorbell, and she answers it. Cartman is dressed in an orange hazmat suit and is carrying a tank of something on his back]
CARTMAN
Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up the neighborhood from parasites. Do you mind if I take a quick look around your house? I'm afraid you may have hippies.
ELDERLY WOMAN
Hippies?
CARTMAN
[walks in and begins to rap the walls with his fist] Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over the neighborhood lately. Ms. Nelson next door had seven hippies in her basement; they usually live in colonies. [raps on the wall and the pitch changes] Hm, I don't like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic?
[The attic. He opens the door and looks in. He gets out a flashlight, turns it on, and looks around again. He stops after a few seconds.]
CARTMAN
Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am. [she climbs up until her eyes are level with his] See that? Hippies. [five hippies are sitting in a clearing in the attic, smoking and laughing.]
ELDERLY WOMAN
Oh my.
CARTMAN
These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard.
[The backyard. The elderly lady opens the door and Cartman walks out onto the back porch]
CARTMAN
Yep, that's what I thought. See that? You've got a drum circle in your backyard. [eight hippies are seen seated around a small campfire drumming away. Logs are scattered around them]
ELDERLY WOMAN
Oh, well they showed up a few days ago, but I didn't think they were hurting anything.
CARTMAN
Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson County. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony.
ELDERLY WOMAN
Oh dear.
[back inside the house]
ELDERLY WOMAN
Oh, well, so, so what do I do?
CARTMAN
[goes back to rapping the walls, then stops] Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymarethane. The drum circle we're gonna have to gas. [raps again. The wall begins to crack and he steps aside. A hippie breaks through and falls to the floor. Cartman says under his breath] God dammit! [pulls out a fire extinguisher from his backpack]
HIPPIE 1
[dazed and confused, coughing] Whoa, how did I get here? Man, I'm so high.
CARTMAN
God damn hippie! [opens fire. Foam spews out from the extinguisher]
HIPPIE 1
Whoa, dude!
CARTMAN
Get out of here!
HIPPIE 1
Not cool! [stands up and looks at Cartman] What's up?! [runs off]
CARTMAN
Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-circle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse!
ELDERLY WOMAN
Ooooo...what's that?
CARTMAN
The college know-it-all hippies.
[The neighborhood, day. A red car pulls up to the curb. On the back window is a decal which says "University of Colorado at Boulder" Three men and three women step out of the car]
DRIVER
[wearing green jacket] Wow, my friend Brittany was right. This is a really laid-back place.
WOMAN 1
[wearing tan jacket] Yeah, this will be a great place to spend spring break. [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny approach them]
KYLE
Hey, let's ask them. [the boys are wearing shoulder totes with magazines peeking out from them.]
STAN
All right. [the two parties meet] 'Scuse me. [holds out a clipboard] Hello, we are selling magazine subscriptions for our community youth program. Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice?
DRIVER
Oh wow, you guys shouldn't be doing that. Don't you know what you're doing to the world?
KYLE
Wha- whataya mean?
MAN 1
[wearing a guitar over his back] You're playing into the corporate game! See, the corporations are trying to turn you into little Eichmann's so that they can make money. [the other man is busily eating chips]
STAN
Who are the corporations?
WOMAN 2
[a blonde with a psychedelic fish on her shirt] The corporations run the entire world. And now they fooled you into working for them.
STAN
Are you serious? We never heard that.
DRIVER
We just spent our first semester at college. Our professors opened our eyes. The government is using its corporate ties to make you sell magazines so they can get rich.
KYLE
Ugh! Those dirty liars!
KENNY
(Sonofabitch!) [throws down his shoulder tote]
MAN 2
[has finished his chips] This is a really nice town you have here. That's why the corporations are trying to use you to take it down.
STAN
Well... Well what do we do?
DRIVER
Just hang with us for a bit. We'll fill you in on everything you haven't been told. [Man 2 resumes eating chips]
[Cartman's basement. He's gathered a bunch of hippies in there and one of them pounds the door to get out]
HIPPIE 2
[wearing a headband] It is time to let us out! I'm sending your names! Open this door right now!
CARTMAN
[opens the door real quick and tosses another hippie down the stairs] All right, in you go.
HIPPIE 2
What are you doing, man?!
HIPPIE 3
[wearing a V-neck sweater] Let us out! [the throng advances up the stairs]
CARTMAN
Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced! [the throng backs down]
HIPPIE 2
What's up, man?! You can't keep us down here like this!
HIPPIE 4
[with straight long hair] What's wrong with you?!
CARTMAN
What's wrong is that there's more of you showing up every day and I need to find out why!
HIPPIE 5
[wearing a thin headband] What makes you think you could tell us where to live?!
HIPPIE 6
This is a free country, man!
CARTMAN
Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it.
HIPPIE 3
Just go with it? We've been down here for days!
CARTMAN
And you're gonna be here a little longer, brah, all right? Here, here's some joints [tosses a bunch of joints down to the hippies], and a guitar! [tosses that down as well and shuts the door. He then locks it and sets a large beam across the door, then walks away. The hippies are left there, coughing. One of them takes the guitar and sings]
SINGER
What's goin' on in this world o'mine?There's a whole lot of killin' in this world o'mine. Somebody's gotta help this world o'mine...
[Stan's house, at about the same time. He's sitting at the edge of the porch playing a guitar quietly. On his cap he wears a peace sign]
STAN
Sign, sign everywhere. SignDone something to my mind.
SHARON
[peeks out through the sliding doors] Stan, sweetie, we're gonna go to the mall. Do you wanna come?
STAN
Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate fat cats to imprison you into a life of servitude. I've got some stuff you should read.
SHARON
Okay, sweetie.
[City Hall, City Council meeting. Mayor McDaniels is seated at the head of a boardroom table, with leading citizens of the town sitting on either side.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
All right, people, we can move onto issue number 14B.
CHEF
[Secretary of Public Safety] Mayor, we have got to do somethin' about all these potholes on our roads!
LINDA STOTCH
[City Clerk and Treasurer] We don't have it in the budget to fix them right now.
GERALD
[City Attorney] We'll wish we spent the money when we have a lawsuit on our hands.
CHEF
We- [a struggle is heard in the hall and the council members turn to see what it is. The door opens and Cartman rushes in, roughed up]
GUARD
You can't go in there!
CARTMAN
Please, I have to talk to you all right now!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Kid, we're have a city council meeting.
CARTMAN
Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over!
RANDY
[Secretary of Parks and Public Grounds] What are you talking about?
CARTMAN
I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it. [some surprise is seen among the council members] For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town. [puts a laptop on the table and turns it on] At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence. [pulls a projector towards the laptop] Then I saw this... [connects the projector to the laptop, and the projector turns on. Everyone then looks at the screen. Cartman goes to it and points a few things out] Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They're thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... hippie music festival.
LINDA
A what?
CARTMAN
It's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that lasts for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen. [the adults don't get it, Cartman sighs heavily]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Kid, what the hell are you talking about?
CARTMAN
I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast!
MR. MACKEY
Uh, Eric, we're, we're talkin' about potholes right now, m'kay.
CARTMAN
It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads. I know what these people are capable of.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Johnson, get him out of here. [Johnson rises and goes for Cartman]
CARTMAN
What are you doing?! [Johnson hauls him away] You have to listen to me! You can't sweep this problem under the rug! [he disappears from view, but peeks in one last time] The town is in serious danger! [Johnson returns to close the door]
[A park in town. The college hippies sit at a table... and on it]
DRIVER
You see, the corporations take their profits and invest it in the war machine while keeping everyone blind.
STAN
Right, so how do we get back at them?
KYLE
Yeah, we're pissed off.
DRIVER
Well, so my idea was this: Let's have, like, a week long music festival, draw everyone here, and then together, we can tear it all down. [foam appears out of nowhere and covers the hippie driver] Whoa, what the hell?! [Cartman appears]
CARTMAN
I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to my basement!
KYLE
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
CARTMAN
[stops and thinks through what he just heard, then turns around] Oh Jesus, not you guys? [approaches Stan and checks him out] What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?!
STAN
[alarmed] NO!
CARTMAN
Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been compromised, I'll have no problem taking you out! I'd expect the same from you. [the hippie that wore the guitar over his shoulder approaches the boys]
MAN 1
What is your problem? Get lost, little Eichmann. [Cartman sprays mace on him and he cries out in pain]
WOMAN 2
Oh my God!
MAN 2
What the hell are you doing?! [a police car pulls up in the background and Officer Barbrady steps out of the car. He comes for Eric]
CARTMAN
Everybody get in a single-file line!
OFFICER BARBRADY
There you are!
CARTMAN
Ah, Officer Barbrady, you're just in time. These college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Eric Cartman, you are under arrest.
CARTMAN
What?
OFFICER BARBRADY
I was just over at your house and freed sixty-three people you had locked in your basement.
CARTMAN
You let them out?! Jesus, we have to find them!
OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh no, you're coming downtown! [hauls Cartman away to the police cruiser]
CARTMAN
No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay! [Barbrady puts him in the passenger seat, then gets into the driver's seat and peels away]
DRIVER
Who was that?
[South Park Police Dept. Cartman is in jail, confused]
CARTMAN
What did I do?!
OFFICER BARBRADY
You can't kidnap people and lock them in your basement.
CARTMAN
They're not people, they're HIPPIES!
MAYOR MCDANIELS.
Is this problem under control?
OFFICER BARBRADY
I handled it, Mayor. Gee whiz.
CARTMAN
[walks to his cell door] Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
I know. I signed the permit.
CARTMAN
[steps back, stunned] You... You what?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
I signed a permit allowing them to have their concert here. Their little "festival" should pump some money into our economy.
CARTMAN
They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! Does the city council know about this?!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
They don't have to know. I can sign whatever permit I want!
CARTMAN
You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN! [Cartman snaps]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
That kid really needs some psychiatric help.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Yeah.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
All right, let's go.
CARTMAN
[quickly composes himself] How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people's lives it is all worth?! God damned hippies!
[Breaking News]
ANNOUNCER
This is a South Park News special report! [a crowd scene is shown beside the anchorman]
ANCHORMAN
Thousands of people have descended on South Park for a hippie music jam festival. The event is said to be the largest such gathering in the history of man. [the crowd scene fills the screen and the MC comes up to the main mic. The stage is set up solidly, with speakers ]
MC
All right, welcome to Hippie Jam Fest 2005! [the crowd raises a cheer] Sooo great to see sooo many people turn out to make an impact on on the world! [more cheering follows]
STAN
Yeah!
KYLE
You said it!
MC
For too long, the corporations have bled the world of its love and resources! It is time for us to get to work and make the world a better place! And we're gonna start right now. [launches into a jam with his band. The crowd cheers; the college hippies are seen in the audience]
MAN 1
[coughs] Oh man, I can't wait to see the look on those little Eichmann's faces when they hear this crunchy groove. [goes back to smoking pot]
[The Marsh house. Sharon and Randy run into each other in the kitchen]
RANDY
Sharon, have, have you seen Stan?
SHARON
He went with his friends to that music festival.
RANDY
Oh, Jesus, what has gotten into that kid?!
SHARON
Now, Randy, we were the same way once, too. Don't forget that we were both considered hippies back in the '60s.
RANDY
Yeah, but when we did it we actually stood for something. I mean, remember Woodstock, Sharon? We actually did something there.
[Flash back to Woodstock, 1969, a crowd scene quite similar to the current one. Randy jumps into view and yells like a barbarian. Sharon jumps into view and they both dance around. Sharon turns and bares her tits and Randy dances so hard he gets dizzy and throws up.]
SHARON
You ate too much acid, man! [she resumes dancing and slips onto the vomit, face up. Randy pounces on her and starts banging her, sort of. They still have their clothes on.]
[Flash forward to the present. They consider how such activity would be seen these days...]
SHARON
...Oh my God. Our son is with those people.
RANDY
[panics] S-stan. STAAAN!
[Breaking News]
ANNOUNCER
This is South Park News!
ANCHORMAN
Fear and horror in South Park today as the music festival continues to grow. [live footage is shown] They're arriving in droves and apparently no end is in sight.
REPORTER
Tom, the crowd just keeps getting bigger and the town is literally bursting at the seams. We don't know where this music festival came from, but, it's very close to consuming us all.
[Butters' house. Linda and Steven hug each other before the TV as they watch the news brief.]
LINDA
Steven, what do we do?
[Kyle's house. Music is heard outside. Gerald opens the door and looks out to see hippies milling on his front lawn, and screams. A view from a long distance shows just how big the crowd has gotten, then another shot shows the heart of the festival. Randy is seen looking for his son]
RANDY
[frantic] Stan?! Stan?! I need to get through, please! [Jimbo approaches him]
JIMBO
[restrains Randy] Randy! Randy, you've got to get out of here! If they just trample this park, we'll be trapped! It's too dangerous!
RANDY
My son is in there! Duh-uh! [breaks away from Jimbo and disappears among the hippies. He reaches a clearing] Stan?! [the marijuana smoke is too much for him. He coughs harshly] Stan! Stan!
MALE HIPPIE
Hey, chill man. It's all good.
FEMALE HIPPIE
Have some water laced with acid.
RANDY
Sta-ogh. Ugh! [he falls to the ground gagging, then gets into a fetal position and passes out]
[City Hall. The Mayor looks at the festival from her office window.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
What have I done?
MC
Yeah, South Park is now hippie capital of the world! [a loud cheer rises from the crowd. The Mayor raises her right arm. In her hand is gun. She points it at her temple. the camera moves to the right, the gun goes off, and bits of brain, skull, and blood hit the wall to the right. Her body is heard dropping to the floor]
[South Park Police Department. Cartman relaxes in his cell, having nothing to do. He senses he's not alone and looks towards the cell door. The town's adults are on the other side.]
MR. MACKEY
Uh huh hi Eric, uh, how's it goin'?
CARTMAN
[gets off his bed] Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it.
RANDY
Eric, you were right. About the hippies. Could you... get rid of them for us now?
CARTMAN
[angered] Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival.
SHEILA
We we need you to take care of them, Eric! They're out of control!
CARTMAN
[a bit resentful] Forget it. [turns his back on them and walks back to his bed]
RANDY
Please. Some of our kids are in there. We should have listened to you earlier.
CHEF
Yeah. We apologize.
JIMBO
Please. Don't let them ruin our town.
CARTMAN
It's too late! Even if I did agree to help, there's too many of them now!
MR. MACKEY
We know you can do it, Eric. You're smart. Wha- why you're the smartest kid in school, m'kay?
RANDY
We're just asking you to try. The whole town even got together and, and baked you a cake. [Sheila presents a cake, and Randy helps out. The cake says Eric on it]
CARTMAN
[turns away again] Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer.
RANDY
[thinks a moment] It's yours.
CARTMAN
I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school parking lot.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Fine.
JIMBO
Anything else?
CARTMAN
Yes. [turns around] Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous!
SHEILA
Well, we can promise not to buy one for Kyle, but we-we can't make him watch you play th- [Randy nudges her hard] Oh yes! Fine! We'll force Kyle to watch you.
CARTMAN
All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I'm gonna need every resource this town has! And even if I don't succeed, and it's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and be super-jealous because he doesn't have one! Are we clear?! [The adults just look back at him]
[The music festival, day 6. The crowd has grown so big the camera has to pull back a long way to get it all into view. The boys are again present with the college hippies. The band is playing reggae music.]
DRIVER
Wow, this band is so crunchy. Dude, I need more weed.
STAN
So it seems like we have enough people now. When do we start taking down the corporations?
MAN 1
[take a deep drag from his joint] Yeah man, the corporations. Right now they're raping the world for money!
KYLE
Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em.
MAN 2
Right now we're proving we don't need corporations. We don't need money. This can become a commune where everyone just helps each other.
MAN 1
Yeah, we'll have one guy who like, who like, makes bread. A-and one guy who like, l-looks out for other people's safety.
STAN
You mean like a baker and a cop?
MAN 2
No no, can't you imagine a place where people live together and like, provide services for each other in exchange for their services?
KYLE
Yeah, it's called a town.
DRIVER
You kids just haven't been to college yet. But just you wait, this thing is about to get HUGE.
[Park County Community Center, night. Cartman and the adults are meeting there. Cartman stands next to an easel with various pictures on a tabloid-size book]
CARTMAN
All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick.
RANDY
[closes his eyes] My God...
CARTMAN
In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. Our only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here. [points to the stage] If we can reach the stage, we can upload this Slayer CD into their music system. [shows off a CD-R of Slayer music] Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all.
JIMBO
Nice plan, kid, except there's one giant flaw. That hippie crowd is massive! How the hell are we supposed to get through it and reach the stage?
CARTMAN
We drill. [flips the page and a blueprint appears.] I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd. The pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside.
STEVEN
You're... actually suggesting that somebody drives right into the heart of that mob? It's a suicide mission!
CARTMAN
Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along with me I'm gonna need a scientist, an engineer, and of course, a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.
RANDY
I'm the... only scientist in town.
LINDA
I'm your engineer.
STEVEN
Honey, no!
LINDA
I have to do it, Steven.
CARTMAN
All right, then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong. [he looks around, panning by Chef once] Lessee, anyone would do, anyone who meets the qualifications, let's see... [his gaze passes Chef again] Oh, I know. How about- [his gaze falls upon Chef and stays there]
CHEF
Yeah, yeah! I get it! Fine!
STEVEN
I I can't believe we're actually listening to this. This is a crazy plan!
RANDY
You got a better idea, Steven?! Dammit, my son is in there!
CARTMAN
There's no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days! Look, it's a long shot! But it's also the only shot we- [his face is distorted. Moments later he sneezes and his face is normal again.] got.
[The music festival, day 6. The camera pans across the site and stops where the townsfolk stand around the vehicle]
[New report]
REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where a desperate attempt to save the town is underway. Some call it a suicide mission, but the heroic men and women of the hippie digger may be our only hope of survival. [Cartman's team enters through the doors of Bay 2]
RANDY
Well I... guess this is it, Sharon.
SHARON
Please, save our boy, Randy.
LINDA
Butters, if anything happens to Mommy, I, I want you to be a good boy.
BUTTERS
Ah I will, Mom.
CHEF
[with two ladies crying on his shoulders] Now, now, don't cry, ladies. Everything's gonna be fine.
CARTMAN
I... don't want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog. [his plush toy sits on a chair] Hey! You're the best stuffed animal I've ever had. [smiles, wipes a tear from his eye, and joins the rest of the crew into the hippie digger. They turn to wave at the townsfolk, who cheer and wave back. Some people take pictures]
SHEILA
Look out for yourselves!
MRS. GARRISON
Godspeed! [the crew finally enters the digger and closes the door]
[Inside the digger]
CARTMAN
Primary engine running?
RANDY
Check.
CARTMAN
Navigation systems?
LINDA
Online
CARTMAN
Let's punch this baby. [the digger rolls off its platform] We're coming up on the outer perimeter of the hippies. Hang on. [the digger lunges into the crowd, tossing hippies left and right, maybe killing a few in the process. Inside, the crew is jostled about] Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status?
RANDY
Vehicle shell holding! [the digger continues clearing a path towards the stage]
[A command center nearby. Townsfolk mill around inside]
JIMBO
They're in!
TOWNSFOLK
All right! All right, yeah! We did it!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[appears with a bandage around her head] All right, people, let's save it! [blood stains are seen on the bandage over both temples. The suicide attempt failed] They still have a long way to go!
[The music festival. The boys are in front of the stage sitting on throw rugs. They're bored.]
STAN
Alright, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage!
KYLE
You're doing what?
GUARD
[an old hippie] Hey, you can't go up there. Hoohoo, woo! [smokes his joint. The digger lurches on. A long shot shows the path the digger is taking]
[Inside the digger]
CARTMAN
Switching to secondary fuel line. [warning lights begin to flash and warning sounds are heard] What's that?
RANDY
The drill is getting too hot from all the hippies. [the digger stalls and dies]
[The command center nearby. Townsfolk mill around inside]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
What's happened?
MR. MACKEY
They, they s- they stopped. Something's wrong.
STEVEN
Jesus... they're dead in the water. [no motion from the digger.]
[The music festival. The digger is dead. As the crowd cheers, Stan approaches the mic]
STAN
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing? [the crowd quiets down] It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something?
A HIPPIE
We're using the power of rock and roll to change the world! Woo! [the crowd cheers]
STAN
Maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish, we should look at ourselves. I mean, is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long?
SINGER
He's right. It's time for all of us to focus our energy and get this hippie jam into full swing. [the band starts up again. They missed his point entirely. Stan just turns right and walks away]
[Inside the digger, the crew tries to start it up again.]
CARTMAN
Come on, come on!
LINDA
It's useless. The main power line has been shut down.
RANDY
Somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters.
CARTMAN
No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out there!
CHEF
...I didn't volunteer!
CARTMAN
...All right, fine Chef, go!
CHEF
...Aw dammit! [rises from his seat and opens the digger door, facing an atmosphere think with marijuana smoke. He climbs down, coughing pretty hard]
[The command center nearby. The Mayor takes command]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
That's it. We're going to Plan B. Nuke the crowd!
STEVEN
God dammit, no! Y-you have to give them more time!
[The music festival. Chef makes his way through the crowd to the booster switch and turns it on. The digger revs up and zooms towards the stage. Kyle seems to be saying something about how he got a stain on his clothes.]
STAN
Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here.
KYLE
We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us.
STAN
What? You mean, we're stuck here listening to this crap? [the stage is shown. All of a sudden the digger smashes into it, stopping the festival in its tracks. The crowd looks towards the stage]
MAN 2
Hey, what happened to the tunes, man?
MAN 1
More tunes. More tunes! [the digger's door opens and the crew steps out]
LINDA
We made it!
CARTMAN
Hit the PA system NOW! [the crew goes over to it] Put me in the main line! [Randy turns and shoves an unconscious man at the controls off and gathers some cords]
RANDY
Which cord is it?
CARTMAN
You're the scientist, jackass!
RANDY
I'm a geologist!
LINDA
We don't have time to argue! They're gonna nuke us!
RANDY
Nyugh!
CARTMAN
Put them in my laptop! [Randy connects one of the cords to the laptop. Cartman selects a song from the Slayer CD he put in the CD-ROM drive: "Raining Blood" He clicks "Play" and the song blasts forth from the stage speakers. The crowd listens for a while, then begins to disperse.]
A HIPPIE
Oh man, not cool.
HIPPIE 3
[covers his hears and walks off] This music is so angry.
MAN 2
This is killing my buzz.
MAN 1
Let's bail on this whole angry scene. [the college hippies move off]
RANDY
It's working!
LINDA
What?
RANDY
It's, it's working!
[The command center.]
MRS. GARRISON
We did it! We did it! [the townsfolk cheer and hug each other]
[The music festival. Stan sees his father]
STAN
Dad!
RANDY
Stan! [they run up to each other and hug. Nearby, Chef comes to and sits up]
CHEF
I'm alive! [Kyle walks around aimlessly, but Cartman spots him]
CARTMAN
Hold it right there, Kyle! [Cartman has a small dagger in its sheath. He pulls it out]
KYLE
Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us.
CARTMAN
Kill you? Oh no. I have much bigger plans for you, Kyle.
[South Park Elementary's parking lot. Kyle sits on the curb watching Cartman play with his Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer. Cartman has the scoop haul some rocks from one pile to another]
CARTMAN
Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee! [offers the remote control] Oh here, Kyle, you wanna play with it a little while. [Kyle rises and takes a few steps, but Cartman withdraws the offer] Oh, sorry! You don't get to! Hehe. Oh, check it out! Cooool!
End of Die Hippie, Die

synopsis:The boys set up a talent agency and pool all their resources and impress their first client only to have another agency steal him away.

script:Wing

[South Park Elementary, day. Class is in session. The kids are chattering when Mrs. Garrison gets their attention.]
MRS. GARRISON
Children, children, we have a very special announcement. [shown with Tolkien at her side] Your classmate, Tolkien, has just returned from winning the Colorado Child Star Contest with his incredible singing! Well let's give him a hand! [She claps, and Butters, Annie, and Bebe join him]
STAN
Token sings?
CARTMAN
Of course he sings. He's black.
MRS. GARRISON
Tolkien is going to sing in front of a huge audience at the Miss Colorado Pageant in Denver. And for doing it he's gonna be paid two hundred dollars.
CLASS
Whoa!
CARTMAN
Two hundred dollars.
MRS. GARRISON
Now of course, as a woman, I'm a bit against those chauvinistic pageants, but I hope that you children take a moment today to congratulate Tolkien for being so special.
[South Park Elementary, lunchtime. Stan and friends sit at a table just outside the school kitchen. They're deep in thought]
STAN
Wow, two hundred dollars. Can you imagine?
KYLE
How come we never get opportunities like that?
CARTMAN
You wanna know what it is, guys?
KYLE
We're not talented?
CARTMAN
That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.
STAN
Yeah. We're too smart to be talented.
CARTMAN
[leaves the table] Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Tolkien is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.
KYLE
Probably.
CARTMAN
So, why shouldn't we get some of that money? We can be Tolkien's agents. That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!
STAN
Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does.
CARTMAN
We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Tolkien think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all. [strokes his chin]
[Montage: Cartman tries out his suit in front of a full-length mirror in his room. Stan and Kyle try out suits in Kyle's room. Next, the boys are in a department store purchasing cell phones at Bull's Eye. Next, Stan and Kyle carry an executive desk into the new office. Next, Cartman and Kenny steal a fountain from somebody's backyard. Next, flyers for the new agency, Super Awesome Talent Agency, are printed out. Next, the boys are at a copy center to get some business cards. Next, Cartman and Kyle set up signs around town. Next, the finished office is shown... in Cartman's basement. The four boys congratulate each other for a job well done.]
[South Park, day. Tolkien walks by one of the signs the boys drew up. He notices it and stops to read it. The boys hide around the corner. Stan peaks around the corner.]
STAN
He's looking at the sign.
CARTMAN
Perfect! All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Tolkien there.
STAN
All right.
CARTMAN
Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Tolkien back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.
KYLE
Why?
CARTMAN
Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Tolkien sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.
STAN
It's genius.
CARTMAN
[motioning them away] Okay, go go, here he comes. [they leave, and he walks into Tolkien's field of view talking into his cell phone] Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested. [stops just before they collide] Oh hey, Tolkien! Buddy, my man, what is up?!
TOLKIEN
Nothin'
CARTMAN
[puts his phone away] Hey, you know, I heard you were doing something down in Denver tomorrow night.
TOLKIEN
Yeah.
CARTMAN
Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Tolkien? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you.
TOLKIEN
I'm supposed to be home by 3:30.
CARTMAN
This will only take a second.
[Cartman's basement - er, Super Awesome Talent Agency. Cartman takes Tolkien down the stairs and onto the agency floor]
CARTMAN
Welcome to our offices, Tolkien. As you can see, we are quite a successful company. Did you notice the fountain? Pretty nice, hm? [they look at the fountains for a few moments, then Cartman turns Tolkien around] Come on over this way, Tolkien. [the other boys come to greet Tolkien] Guys, you remember Tolkien. He's thinking about becoming a client.
STAN
[sitting Tolkien down on the sofa] Ohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man.
CARTMAN
Now, Tolkien, I I know what you're saying to yourself: You're saying, "Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent?" Right?
TOLKIEN
[Stan and Kyle walk off...] ...Yeah?
CARTMAN
[...and reappear on either side of him] Tolkien, the truth is that without representation, you're in danger of being taken advantage of. [his phone rings] Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Tolkien. [takes the "call"] Super Awesome Talent Agency. Oh yes, hello! How are you, Abraham Lincoln? [Tolkien just looks on. Kyle is stunned that Cartman would mention Lincoln, then gets cross about it] Yeah, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now.
KYLE
Can I talk to you?! [grabs Cartman's shoulder]
CARTMAN
I'll I'll call you back, Abe. [hangs up. Kyle pulls him behind the partition]
KYLE
What the hell are you doing?!
CARTMAN
I'm making it look like important people call us.
KYLE
Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!
CARTMAN
[thinks for a moment] ...well Tolkien doesn't know that.
KYLE
Yes he does!
CARTMAN
How?!
KYLE
Tolkien actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!
CARTMAN
Jew! [Stan comes around the corner]
STAN
You guys, we're gonna lose our client. [the boys come into view again]
CARTMAN
Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that. [goes to his desk and clears his throat. Stan and Kyle flank him again] Ah, now, where were we?
TOLKIEN
We were at why I should give you ten percent.
STAN
Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can.
KYLE
Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you.
STAN
This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token. With our support, you can have the whole pie.
TOLKIEN
[thinks a moment] Well, I guess that makes sense. All right. [the boys are a bit stunned at how brief and easy this was]
CARTMAN
Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here? [slides the contract towards Tolkien, and Tolkien signs it]
KYLE
Welcome to the team, Tolkien.
STAN
Ah Kenny, Token just signed with us!
KENNY
(Hey, terrific!)
CARTMAN
From now on, we are an entertainment team, Tolkien. You just do all the singing, all the performing and all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us.
[Denver Convention Center, night. The Miss Colorado Pageant is underway]
MC
And there are your finalists, the sixteen most beautiful women in Colorado. Here to sing for our sixteen lucky finalists, the winner of the Colorado Child Star Contest, Tolkien Black. [a soul beat comes up and Tolkien walks onto the stage. The crowd cheers him on, he hits his mark and begins to sing]
TOLKIEN
You'll never find...As long as you live...Someone who loves you...Tender like I do...
MAN
["You'll never find..."] Wow, he's really great. We should get him to sing at Tommy's bar mitzvah ["No matter where you search..."]
STAN
Oh, you're interested in hiring our client?
CARTMAN
We represent Tolkien. [hands the man a business card] Give us a call, we'll work out a deal.
TOLKIEN
Whoa, I'm not braggin' on myself, babyBut I'm the one who loves you and there's no one else! No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh one else.
MRS. GARRISON
Just between us girls, nothin' gets my vadge wetter than a black man singing.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[winces] Mr. Garrison, for the love of God.
TOLKIEN
... (you're gonna miss my lovin')I know you're gonna my lovin' (you're gonna miss my lovin')You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my lo-o-ove.
[Denver Convention Center, after the show, outside. The boys walk out with Tolkien, who's counting the cash he earned.]
STAN
You were awesome, Token!
KYLE
We knew you could do it!
CARTMAN
Two hundred dollars, Tolkien, that's great! And ten percent of two hundred is...
KYLE
Twenty dollars.
TOLKIEN
Here you go. [hands Cartman $20]
KENNY
(All right!)
CARTMAN
Sweet!
STAN
This is just the beginning. I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.
AGENT
[walks up to the boys] Hey there my man, that was a great performance.
TOLKIEN
Thanks.
AGENT
Don Heisman, Creative Arts Agency in Los Angeles. I think you've got real promise. How'd you like to sign with CAA?
TOLKIEN
Are you serious?
STAN
[interjecting] Uh excuse me, Token already has representation.
CARTMAN
You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency.
DON
Mm, no. Uh, look, Tolkien, there's some shows in LA we wanna book you on right away. If you come out to my limo we can talk everything through.
TOLKIEN
Oh my God! Okay!
CARTMAN
Tolkien, you signed with us!
TOLKIEN
Oh, come on, guys. You have to see what a huge opportunity this is for me.
CARTMAN
What?! Uh they're not so great! They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby!
DON
Actually, our fountain is two stories tall.
CARTMAN
...Oooo...
DON
Come on, Tolkien, we have a lot to talk about.
KYLE
Mister, you can't do this to us!
DON
Sorry kids, nature of the business, you know? [Tolkien goes into the limo and takes a seat. Don follows him in] Do you like steak, Tolkien? I know a great place for you locally. [the limo rolls off]
CARTMAN
...Goddamnit! [throws down the $20 bill]
[Super Awesome Talent Agency, day. The boys sit around a table trying to come up with other ways of attracting potential clients. Kenny relaxes on the sofa]
STAN
So unfair... so unfair.
KYLE
All that time and effort we spent helping Tolkien and this is the thanks we get?!
CARTMAN
This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off! I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on! [Tuong Li Kim comes into view, climbing down the stairs]
MR. KIM
Ahh hello, is this the Talent Agency
STAN
Huh?
MR. KIM
I see this sign on the street for a talent agency? I need a representation. [the boys all perk up and look at Lu Kim, then jump at the chance to get a new client] Hey, wowee, nice fountain.
STAN
You were looking for a talent agent?
MR. KIM
No, not me, my wife. [calls her down the stairs. She dutifully appears] This is Wing. She just come over from China. [puts his right hand on to the left side of his face so she doesn't hear] She over here uh irregarry. The Chinese Mafia help me out.
STAN
And what does she do?
MR. KIM
Ah, she sing. She very popular in China. Hey, you just sit and listen. You'll be very impressed. [he barks commands at her, then goes over to a tape player, puts a tape in, and waits for Wing to sing. The boys take seats at a row of chairs nearby. Wing begins a bad rendition of ABBA's Dancing Queen] Well? What you think?
STAN
Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off the ground would take too much work for us.
MR. KIM
Aww, that's too bad. She just got accepted to be on American Idol in Ros Angeres, but I can't take her 'cause I have to mind the restaurant. [the boys think, then blink]
CARTMAN
You've ...already done all the work?
MR. KIM
Yes. They say it pays a thousand dowar.
KYLE
Sir, we would love to sign your wife.
STAN
Yeah!
MR. KIM
Rearry?
CARTMAN
We'll go to LA with your wife. All she has to do is go on the show, do all the performing, make all the money, and leave the rest to us. [Wing continues singing]
[City Wok, night. The phone rings.]
MR. KIM
Shitty Wok, take your order prease.
[City Wok, night. The phone rings.]
STAN
Hi, Mr. Lu Kim? Uh hi, it's Wing's agents. Everything's fine, yeah, but we're supposed to arrive in Los Angeles in about four hours. Listen, does your wife ever eat? Or anything?
MR. KIM
Oh, don't worry about her. She a very dericate little flower. See, she don't need to eat much.
STAN
Uhh, all right. We'll call you after she goes on TV.
MR. KIM
Okay, bye. Oh oh wait! Can I talk to my wife, please?
STAN
Uh sure, here she is. [Stan puts the phone to Wing's ear, and Mr. Kim begins barking at her again] Okay, finarry everything rookin' up for me and my family. [outside there's a flash of light and three shadows pass through the doors] Welcome to Shitty Wok, take your order prease? [the men come into the light. They are three buff Chinese men] Aw crap, Chinese Mafia! [one of the men walks around behind the counter, grabs Mr. Kim's head with one hand and places a knife against his chin with the other] Aaaaahh! [the two men move around to the eating area and are met by four other Tong members]
TONG LEADER
Mr. Ru Kim, it appears we have a problem.
MR. KIM
Oh, a problem? Rearry?
TONG LEADER
We smuggled your wife into the United States for you. You were to pay us ten thousand dollars for that service. Yet, we have yet to be paid.
MR. KIM
We... we working on it! She, she got tarent agent! She's about to make a whole lotta money!
TONG LEADER
It's too late for that, Mr. Kim. Your wife is now our property. We taking her to Los Angeles, where she will work in massage parlor.until she works off the debt.
MR. KIM
No, she... she not here! Prease, just give me a little more time! [the leader punches him in the face] Agh!
TONG LEADER
Where is she?!
MR. KIM
She... she in Arabama.
TONG LEADER
You're lying. Turn him around!
MR. KIM
Yah, wah, aaaah!
TONG LEADER
You don't wanna tell us where she is? All right. Puh la! Ching ga wai pan! [one of the men begins to grab trays of food and dumps the first one over the counter]
MR. KIM
Ahhh! My shitty chicken! [the man grabs the next tray and dumps that over the counter] Nooo, the shitty beef! [the man grabs the next tray...] No! No wait! Prease! Stop! Prease! Not the shitty shrimp.
TONG LEADER
Tell us where to find her, Ru Kim! You have no choice.
MR. KIM
She... she go to Ros Angeres with her agents! She gonna be American Idol. [the leader snaps his fingers, the other men let him go, and they all leave. Mr. Kim collapses on the floor sobbing]
[Hollywood, day. A view of the Hollywood sign from a location above a main thoroughfare]
[A major studio. The boys walk among the various studios - Studio 21, Studio 22, Studio 23...]
STAN
There it is! American Idol contestants!
KYLE
Jesus, we made it just in time! [the boys attempt to talk to the attendants]
CARTMAN
Excuse us!
CONTESTANT
Hey kid, what do you think you're doing? [the boys turn to face him]
STAN
Ah our client has an audition to this show.
CONTESTANT
Yeah. So do we! [the camera pulls back to show the long line of contestants waiting for their auditions]
KYLE
Oh crap!
CARTMAN
Dude, how long is the wait?
CONTESTANT 2
It's been about seventeen days for me.
STAN
Oh no, no no no, come on! [the boys return to the attendants] Excuse me, ma'am.
ATTENDANT
Wait in line with everyone else. [turns away]
STAN
No, I don't think you understand. We're here with Wing. That's right, the Wing. [the woman]
KYLE
Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-
CARTMAN
Brrr brrr! Brrr brrr! Oh, excuse me, everyone. That's my cell phone. [clears his throat and whips out his phone] Hello? Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders! Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is.
KYLE
Aw, just forget it! [hauls Cartman away. The other boys follow, but Wing doesn't]
CARTMAN
Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders! You shouldn't give her any more chicken.
KYLE
Goddamnit! Goddamnit!
STAN
We can't wait in line! We have to be in school on Monday!
CARTMAN
Stupid assholes! [they pass an agent talking on a cell phone]
AGENT
What do you mean your client isn't coming?! We're taping the show tomorrow! Where am I goin' to find another contestant? Fine! Go screw yourself!
KYLE
Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show?
STAN
We have someone who's ready to go on TV right away!
AGENT
Really?
CARTMAN
Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well?
AGENT
Well yeah, winner gets a thousand dollars.
STAN
All right, our client will do it!
AGENT
Great! You kids just saved my ass! See you over at Stage 6. [moves off.]
KYLE
Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?
AGENT
Naw, this is better. It's called The Contender. [gets into a cart and drives off.]
STAN
What's "The Contender"?
[The Contender commercial]
ANNOUNCER
Tonight, two people will compete for glory. One will stay, one will go home, in the new hit show by Sylvester Stallone.
STALLONE
Hello.
ANNOUNCER
The Contender!
[The Contender taping]
ANNOUNCER
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Contender! Fighting out of the red corner, wearing blue and white trunks, the Destructor from Del Fuego, Mexico, Manuelo Furrrrnanda! [Furnanda dances and jabs at the air, then raises his arms. Mexican fans in the audience cheer him on]
STALLONE
[at ringside, slurred speech] Le's go! Le's see a good fight!
ANNOUNCER
And fighting out of the blue corner, wearing a gorgeous floral-pattern silk dress, Wing!
CARTMAN
Come on, Wing!
KYLE
Let's do it Wing!
STAN
Go Wing! [Kenny cheers on as well, but he's hard to understand. The bell rings. Wing's music comes up and she begins to sing "Fernando" as Fernanda sizes her up]
STALLONE
Aw yeah! [Fernanda begins to deliver blows to Wing and the boys wince]
THE BOYS
Awww! [Fernanda delivers more blows]
KYLE
Oh my God, dude!
CARTMAN
She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that. [Fernanda delivers more blows until Wing is knocked out and falls to the side]
THE BOYS
[wincing] Awww! [Kenny draws his hood string tight around his face]
CARTMAN
Gay.
[Stage 6, day. The boys stand outside the stage with cups in their hands]
STAN
Anyone? Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado?
CARTMAN
Your gift of hope is a great deduction. [no one stops to donate. Stallone and his producers come out and approach the boys]
STALLONE
Hey kid! [Stan and Cartman turn around and he mumbles at them]
PRODUCER
Mr. Stallone says he's sorry it couldn't go better for you back there.
STAN
Oh, thanks.
STALLONE
Yo kid. [mumbles some more]
PRODUCER
Mr. Stallone thinks your singer has a lot of talent. [Stallone mumbles some more] He really likes her voice. [Stallone mumbles some more] You know, the way she vocalizes the melody, [Stallone mumbles some more] it brings tears to his eyes.
CARTMAN
Thanks, Mr. Stallone. We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer. [Stallone mumbles some more]
PRODUCER
Uh, Mr. Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding.
STAN
You do? [Stallone mumbles some more]
PRODUCER
He'll pay her four thousand dollars.
CARTMAN
Four thousand dollars? [Stallone mumbles some more and hands his producer a card]
PRODUCER
[hands the card to Stan] Be at this address tomorrow 2 p.m. sharp. And don't be late.
STAN
We won't! [Stallone mumbles some more, then leaves with his men]
STAN, CARTMAN
Waaaaah! [they run over to Kyle and Kenny, who have their own cups]
STAN
You guys, you guys!
KYLE
What?
STAN
Sylvester Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow! He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!
KENNY
(What?!)
KYLE
Get out!
CARTMAN
That's four hundred for us! We did it! [tosses his cup away]
KYLE
Woohoo! Yeah!
STAN
Yeah!
CARTMAN
Who let the dogs out?
THE BOYS
[dancing in pairs] Who? Who? Who who?
CARTMAN
Who let the dogs out?
THE BOYS
Who? Who? Who who?
CARTMAN
Who let-?
STAN
Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ...where's Wing? [the joy leaves instantly]
KYLE
What do you mean? We thought she was with you.
CARTMAN
Naw, sh-she was with you!
STAN
...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again.
CARTMAN
[move forward] Wing? Wing?
KYLE
Wing?
CARTMAN
Wing? Here, Wing!
KYLE
Wing?
KENNY
(Wing?) [nearby, the Tong have arrived and abducted Wing]
TONG LEADER
You thought you could run from us, did you? [the boys look around, and Stan spots her]
STAN
Oh no! [he points towards Wing, who's now being put into a limousine. The boys race over] Hey! That's our client! [the driver gets into the limo and drives off]
KYLE
They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again!
CARTMAN
Not this time! They dropped their card. Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is! We're gonna march in there, and get our client back.
[A crisp clear night under a bright moon. The camera pans down and rests on a hilltop mansion]
TONG LEADER
[in one of the rooms] You see, Mrs. Kim, when you made a deal with us, you signed your life away. Yes, we help Chinese citizens sneak into the U.S., but when they get here, they become our slaves. It's an age-old business, and nobody has the guts to stop us. [guards outside the house arm themselves]
STAN
[walking up the driveway with his friends] Two four nine all right, this is the place.
KYLE
Damn, CAA is pretty impressive.
CARTMAN
Of course it's impressive! They steal everyone else's clients!
GUARD 1
[says something in Chinese. Translations follow] "It's just four little boys" [the second guard says something to the boys as they walk up the stairs and pass through the front doors]
CARTMAN
Yeah, whatever. You can suck our balls.
[The mansion, inside. The boys walk through a long, lavish hallway]
STAN
Hello? We want to talk to somebody right now!
CARTMAN
Oh my God, you guys. Look! [they face a two-story-tall fountain with a curving stairway on each side] They do have an amazing fountain. [four guards appear and run down one of the staircases, getting into positions]
KYLE
You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?!
STAN
You tell 'em, Kyle!
KYLE
You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW! [the four guards open fire. the boys look for a place to hide and find shelter behind a counter.]
STAN
Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!
TONG LEADER
[hears the commotion nearby] What the hell is that?! Go! Go! [sends the guards with him out]
KYLE
Dude, maybe we should give up!
STAN
No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!
CARTMAN
Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too! [leaves the counter]
KYLE
Cartman! [Cartman runs through the gunfire and makes it to a wall on which rest several guns. He takes one and cocks it. The four guards move down to the floor]
CARTMAN
Do you wanna play rough?! Okay! [comes out from behind the wall] Take this! [begins firing away. He has no control over the gun, so it fires everywhere. One of the guards is struck down, another one quickly goes up the stairs again]
STAN
We've gotta split up and find Wing! You and Kenny go that way! [Kyle and Kenny move away from the gunfire, Stan goes towards Cartman. Kyle and Kenny enter a blue room]
KYLE
Wing?
[Two guards fire away. Kyle and Kenny duck and cover themselves, and two guards coming up behind them are killed. Cartman and Stan go down a hallway, with Cartman firing at everything in sight. Two guards follow them and fire away. Kyle finds shelter behind a red sofa tattered from the gunfire, but Kenny isn't with him]
KYLE
[pulls out a yellow toy car] Stupid talent agents!
[Kyle looks up from behind the sofa and throws the car towards the gunmen. One of them slips on it and flies out a window, the other slips on it and falls back onto the mansion's fuse box. He gets electrocuted]
KYLE
[stirs] All right, Kenny, let's go! [stops when nothing happens, then looks] Kenny? [the camera pulls back to show Kenny, shot up and bleeding, dead on the floor] Kenny! [walks over to Kenny with his arms open] Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing. [hugs Kenny, sobbing] We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you!
[Kyle hugs Kenny again. Cartman and Stan enter the room where Wing is being held. Cartman again opens fire and three guards fire back. Kyle enters the room with his own gun and fires at the guards]
KYLE
They killed Kenny!
STAN
You bastards!
TONG LEADER
Enough! [comes into view with a gun to Wing's head] I have a lot of respect for you boys finding your way in here. But you come any closer and I'll blow her brains out.
CARTMAN
Don't give us that crap! She's no good to you dead and you know it!
STAN
Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money! We know because we're in the same business you are!
TONG LEADER
This woman has a contract with us! We own her!
KYLE
She had a contract with us first! We own her!
TONG LEADER
Her life belongs to us!
KYLE
Her life belongs to us!
STAN
[intervening] Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of.
KYLE
Yeah.
STAN
Wing doesn't belong to us or to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.
TONG LEADER
[releases his grip on Wing and lowers his gun] Perhaps... you're right. We spend all this time... mooching off the hopes and dreams of others, forgetting that they are human beings.
KYLE
Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling.
TONG LEADER
[sighs deeply and turns around] I am tired of this business. It is a very dirty and perverse business.
STAN
It's a lousy business. I quit.
KYLE
Me too.
CARTMAN
Aw aw guys, come on!
TONG LEADER
We quit too. [his guards lower their weapons] It's time for us to find another way to make money. From now on, all contracts we have on people are null and void.
STAN, KYLE
All right!
[Stallone's mansion, next day. He gets on stage to ...um, mumble]
PRODUCER
[interpreting] Mr. Stallone thanks all of you for coming to his son's wedding. And now as a special treat, it is his pleasure to give you the music of... Wing! [cheers and applause as she takes the stage to sing "Sing A Song"]
WING
Sing, sing a song, make it simple, to last your whole life long...
MR. KIM
[seated at a table with the Tong leader and the boys] Boys, thank you so much for eveything. You rearry helped us out.
TONG LEADER
Yes, you were right, kids. Her voice is so beautiful. ["Don't worry if it's not good enough..."] To think we would have made it so nobody would ever hear her sing. ["...for anyone else to hear."]
STAN
I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people. ["Just sing..." Tolkien appears in the background]
TOLKIEN
Send a cress in your plates, folks? ["Sing a song..."]
KYLE
[notices] Tolkien?
TOLKIEN
[notices] Oh... Hey guys. [walks up to the table] What, what are you doin' here?
CARTMAN
Tolkien, you're... waiting tables?
TOLKIEN
Yeah. Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you. ["Sing, sing a song"] I'm trying to work my way back home.
CARTMAN
Aw man, that's too bad, Tolkien. Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh? Oh and some more olive oil. Chop chop! ["make it simple, to last your whole life long." Tolkien walks off ]
TONG LEADER
My God, her voice is sooo beautiful! ["Don't worry if it's not good enough..."]
MR. KIM
Yeah, she's a very dericate rittle flower. ["for anyone else to hear." gets up and screams at her]
WING
Sing, sing a song.
End of Wing

synopsis:When Kenny meets with an unfortunate accident, Cartman lobbies to let Kenny die so he can can get what Kenny left to him in Kenny's will.

script:Best Friends Forever

[Early dawn over Cartman's house. Liane is still sleeping. Cartman runs into his mother's bedroom]
CARTMAN
Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go! [moves to the foot of the bed] MOM, GET UP!
LIANE
[sits up, feeling sleepy] Oh, Poopie-kins, it's very early.
CARTMAN
[goes to the other side of the bed and draws close to her face] Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game machines go on sale at seven a.m. today. I have to be the first to get one! [turns on her light] Come on! [goes back to the door]
LIANE
[still sleepy] Sweetie, can't we go after school?
CARTMAN
Everyone's moms are taking their kids after school! We're outsmarting everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! Let's go!
[Liane's car, some time later. She and Cartman drive along, Cartman bouncing happily in his seat]
CARTMAN
I can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when I show up to school with a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh PLEASE let Kyle cry! [they pull up to the curb and stop. Cartman gets out of the car] WHAT THE HELL?!
[Before them is a long line of people in front of Luau's Toys waiting for the PSP. The camera reaches the front of the line only to find Kenny right at the front door. He's the first one in line. Cartman approaches Kenny]
CARTMAN
Kenny, when did you get here?
KENNY
[looks at his watch](Friday)
CARTMAN
Friday?! Aw, Jesus! [he switches tactics] I'll just... sort of get in here- in here. [gets in line between Kenny and the Goth Kids]
TALL GOTH
Hey dickhole! What do you think you're doing?
CARTMAN
Uh, my friend Kenny was saving my place in line.
SIXTH GRADER
There's no saving place, fourthie! Get to the back or we'll beat your face in!
CARTMAN
Oh, Goddammit! [moves to the back of the line] They'd better not sell out!
[The bus stop, later in the day. Kenny is playing with his PSP as Stan and Kyle look on. Stan and Kyle weren't in line]
KYLE
That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it?
STAN
[answering for Kenny] It's a game called "Heaven versus Hell." Kenny commands the armies of heaven against the forces of Satan. [Cartman walks up to the other boys, but he's quite upset. He crosses his arms] Dude, you see what Kenny got?
CARTMAN
YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE! [Cartman folds his arms]
KYLE
Wuh what'd I do?
CARTMAN
JUST SHUT YOUR JEW MOUTH!!!
GAME VOICE
"Congratulations! You have reached ...level nine!"
KYLE
Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in "Heaven versus Hell."
STAN
Yeah, Kenny finally found something he's really good at.
[A montage follows. Kenny is seen in class playing on his PSP, then in the cafeteria, then in the playground, then in his bedroom at night. He reaches level 24. He's then seen at the amusement park with his family, still playing with his PSP, then in "The Mine Shaft" roller coaster, where he reaches level 45. He's seen on the bus playing on his PSP while the other students are having fun, then in Le Bijou playing while Stan and Kyle watch a movie, then on the sidewalk passing some hot babes - he doesn't look up to acknowledge them, then in his bed again at night. He reaches level 54.]
[Kenny's house, day, the kitchen. He's still playing on his PSP]
CAROL
Kenny? Kenny, are you still playin' with that thing? [Yep] Kenny, it's been two weeks and you've done nothin' else!
KENNY
(I could get to level sixty!)
CAROL
Who cares if you almost made it to level sixty?! You're wastin' your life, Kenny! If you died tomorrow, what would you have to show for it?! You're gonna end up wishin' you'd done more with your life, just like your dead-beat father!
STUART
[offscreen] Hey, I heard that, bitch!
CAROL
I wasn't talkin' to you, asshole!! [Kenny leaves, having tuned her out all the while]
STUART
[offscreen] How about I come in there and kick your teeth in!
CAROL
I'd like to see you try!
[Kenny leaves the house and goes to the sidewalk. His parents continue arguing inside.]
STUART
Goddamnit, do you have to smart off at me in my own house?!
CAROL
It's my house too, you no-good loser!
GAME VOICE
You have reached level sixty!
KENNY
[starts jumping around excited] (Yes! Woohoo! I did it! I reached level s-!) [an ice-cream truck runs over him. The driver misses this, as he's playing on his own PSP]
DRIVER
Oh yeah, level four, sweet!
[The street. Kenny's body lies on the road. Eventually his ghost rises out of his body]
KENNY
(Hey, that's odd.) [He rises up in the air.] (Hey, I'm floating. That can't be! Hey wait!) [he then speaks too fast to decipher, but he toes towards heaven.]
[He reaches heaven, right side up, and bounces once before landing. He walks towards a giant golden gate]
ANGEL 1
Open the gate!
ANGEL 2
Open the gate! [the gates open and an elderly man walks towards Kenny. Kenny shields his eyes from the bright rays.]
PETER
Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven, Kenny. I am Peter.
KENNY
(What the fuck is going on?)
PETER
There isn't much time, Kenny. You're dead, but, your death was no accident. Heaven needs you.
KENNY
(Me?)
PETER
Come! There is much to discuss. [they both enter and behold a gleaming city on a hill. Inside, the city has all the appearance of a super-basilica, built with gold and marble. Angels flit around doing stuff] Things are not good in Heaven, Kenny. Satan is planning a massive attack and he knows we are too few in number to stop him! God has changed the rules here. For ages, only Mormons were allowed into Heaven. [they pass the Mormons, who greet them] But knowing that Hell was becoming much larger, God decided to let more people cross over so that he could build an army as well, an army that YOU must command.
KENNY
(That I what?)
PETER
The Sony PSP was built by God, to determine who on Earth had the best skills to defeat the armies of Satan. You... are the best. YOU, are the only hope for the universe.
[In a great courtyard outside the super-basilica. An angel addresses the others]
ANGEL 3
Satan's army grows as we speak. The Dark Lord knows that our armies are few in number, and unorganized. So our only hope... is perfect strategy. [steps aside to show Kenny off]
ANGEL 4
A child? This is God's solution?
PETER
He beat Satan's army in over three thousand separate simulations.
ANGEL 4
Archangel Michael, what say you?
MICHAEL
[looks out into space, then turns around] The child did something none of us could: Reach level sixty on the PSP. Now I don't know if that's luck or perseverance, but it's Goddamned impressive. All right, Kenny, let me show you what we're up against. [two other angels roll a chalkboard to him, and he begins drawing up strategies.] This is the Kingdom of Heaven. Satan's armies will attack the gate ...here. They are... ten billion in number. Maybe more. [sniffs the fumes from the Sharpie] Our armies are here, here, and here. Just under... ten thousand strong. [sniffs again] We are outnumbered and in need of someone who can single handedly bring the whole Dark Empire down. Basically, Kenny, you... are Keanu Reeves. [Kenny just sits there.]
[Hell. Satan's armies mill about, the troops arm each other. Satan addresses them]
SATAN
My fellow damned souls! Now is the time for our assault! [with him is a small hooded figure] You know no fear! You will drink the blood of angels! We go now! Nothing can stop us!
ANGEL 5
Step aside! Step aside, I say! [stops when he sees Satan] Satan! God has mocked thee once again!
SATAN
My spy!
ANGEL 5
God has found a way to defeat your army.
SATAN
Impossible! How?!
ANGEL 5
A young man. Basically, he-he's like Keanu Reeves.
SATAN
[slumps down in his throne] Oh Jesus Christ.
HOODED FIGURE
My Lord. My Lord, we must attack, now!
SATAN
What's the point?! They have a Keanu Reeves now.
HOODED FIGURE
Do not fear, my Lord. Your army is great!
SATAN
Very well. [rises and addresses his army] Demon Army, begin your march on Heaven! [a loud roar comes up from the army]
[Michael and Kenny walk to one of the ramparts and look out over Heaven]
MICHAEL
Up here, you get the best tactical view to protect the fortress. It is from here, Kenny, that you shall command the armies of heaven.
KENNY
(All right. How am I supposed to do that?)
ANGEL 6
Simple. You will use... this. [bows towards a chair and backs off. A golden PSP descends onto the chair]
MICHAEL
[gets the PSP and shows it to Kenny] This golden PSP is king of all PSPs.
ANGELS
Hail the holy PSP.
MICHAEL
It works just like the ones we sent to Earth. All the commands you make will be sent to the troops down on the battlefield. All you have to do is play the game, Kenny. Only this time, It's for reals.
ANGEL 7
Gabriel returns with news!
GABRIEL
Hell's army is departing! They head now for the Gates of Heaven.
MICHAEL
Prepare the troops! [the angels take off] We must be ready for them! [walks up to Kenny] The time is at hand, Kenny. The stage is set and the final battle between Heaven and Hell is about to begin! The fate of the outcome is in your hands. [Kenny vanishes. The angels notice] Where'd he go?
[Hell's Pass Hospital. The paddles have been taken to Kenny and fired away.]
FEMALE NURSE
Doctor! Doctor, we have a pulse!
DOCTOR
Then that's it! We brought him back.
MALE NURSE
Amazing, doctor! You've revived somebody who's been legally dead for almost a day!
DOCTOR
Call the parents. They're going to be shocked to find out... their son is alive.
[Hell's Pass, later]
DOCTOR
It's the latest in electro-plastilical science. Your son's organs are all functioning again.
STUART
It's a miracle... Kenny, you're alive.
DOCTOR
I'm afraid he can't respond to you. You see, being dead for that long, most of Kenny's brain cells died from lack of oxygen. Your son is alive, but, in what we call a "persistent vegetative state."
CAROL
Will he ever recover?
DOCTOR
I'm afraid no. Brain cells cannot be repaired once dead. But his soul is still in here. [places his hand on Kenny's chest] Almost... trapped in here, if you will. Kenny is the same as he ever was. It's just that, now, he's more like ...a tomato.
STUART
He can't more on his own-ah how will he eat?
DOCTOR
A feeding tube. It pumps a nutrient paste directly into Kenny's stomach. With it we can actually keep Kenny the tomato alive for years.
[Back in Heaven, business goes on as usual]
MICHAEL
[reading a scroll] A feeding tube?!
GABRIEL
Yes. Apparently they're using machines to keep them alive.
MICHAEL
But... that's not natural. God intended Kenny to die! What are these people doing?!
ANGEL 3
The child's soul is now trapped inside his vegetative body. We have no one to command the troops with the PSP.
GABRIEL
And Satan's armies are approaching.
MICHAEL
Oh, Goddammit.
[A brick building. Inside, a lawyer sees the four boys.]
LAWYER
Boys I want to thank you for coming down to my office on such short notice. [the boys are shocked]
STAN
Are we in trouble or something?
LAWYER
No. Boys, I'm a lawyer. Your friend Kenny has passed away and I've called you here to read his will.
KYLE
Kenny had a will?
LAWYER
[clears his throat] "In the highly likely event of my death, I, Kenny McCormick, wish to leave all my belongings to my good friends, Stan and Kyle. Dudes, you were the friends a guy could have."
STAN
Oh wow...
KYLE
That's... really touching.
CARTMAN
(looking bored) Fags!
LAWYER
To Eric Cartman: "Eric, I never really liked you. But then, nobody does. You have no ability to feel, and you are going to die alone and miserable. It is only because I feel so sorry for you that I leave you my Sony PSP."
CARTMAN
[suddenly excited and cocky] Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who the man?
LAWYER
There is one more thing I would like to ask you all, as my friends. If I should ever be in a vegetative state and kept alive on life-support, please,... [Cartman is still dancing. The lawyer reaches the last page and... can't fine it]
STAN
Please what?
LAWYER
I don't know. I lost the last page.
CARTMAN
Who cares? Kenny's dead! [rushes up to the lawyer's desk] When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?
LAWYER
[pulls up a box from nowhere and puts it on his desk] It's right here, along with Kenny's other belongings. They're all yours.
CARTMAN
[salivating] Yes!
MAN
[enters the office] He's alive!
STAN
What?
MAN
Kenny McCormick! He's alive at the hospital! [leaves]
KYLE
Oh my God! [he and Stan rush out of there, leaving Cartman incredulous]
[Satan's armies continue their march to Heaven. Satan looks on through his crystal ball]
HOODED FIGURE
Your army nears the Kingdom of Heaven, my Lord.
SATAN
I don't know if we should continue without knowing more about this Keanu Reeves God has.
SPY ANGEL
Satan! I come bearing good news! The Keanu Reeves boy has been revived on Earth! His soul is no longer in Heaven.
SATAN
[whispers] Then God is helpless. [aloud] Full march, to the Gates of Heaven! Victory is ours!
[The boys reached Hell's Pass and enter Kenny's recovery room]
STAN
Kenny?
KYLE
Kenny! You're alive!
STAN
Dude, how'd you do that?
DOCTOR
He can't respond to you, boys. Being dead for that long caused severe damage to his brain.
CARTMAN
Well... well then he's NOT alive.
CAROL
He's alive. He-ee smiles when I talk to him. I think...
CARTMAN
That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire! Here, look. [climbs onto Kenny's bed and holds out a $1 bill] Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar?
STUART
I-I don't know if it's right to keep Kenny alive on that machine. I-I just... I don't know what he would want.
STAN
Yeah, the lawyer lost that page.
CARTMAN
Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube.
CAROL
He did? When?
CARTMAN
Um, it was um, this one time...
KYLE
He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!
CARTMAN
Stupid? PSP is stupid?! [steps forth] Did you all hear that? [steps back to his little group] Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this!
KYLE
He did not!
CARTMAN
Did so!
KYLE
Did not!
CARTMAN
Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin' Jew! [moves towards the door] I'm gonna get that feeding tube removed if I have to go all the way to the Supreme Court! [runs out]
[Heaven. The angels mill around inside the fortress]
PETER
Satan's army has crossed over the Plains of Limbo!
GABRIEL
Then they will be here on the morrow. Without Kenny's soul here there will be nobody who can use the holy PSP.
URIEL
No! There is another. A Japanese boy did make it to level fifty-nine.
MICHAEL
[thinks for a moment] Are you stupid, Uriel? Japanese people don't have souls!
ANGEL 9
Yeah
ANGEL 10
Yeah
ANGEL 11
Yeah
ANGEL 12
Yeah, Uriel!
URIEL
Oh, right right, I'm sorry
MICHAEL
Kenny remains our only hope! Here is what we must do. [walks up to the chalkboard and starts writing] Gabriel and Uriel, you go down to Earth and try to get that feeding tube removed. In the meantime [sniffs those Sharpie fumes] we will put all our troops at Heaven's Gate. We will try to keep Hell's Army from breaking through as long as possible. [sniffs those Sharpie fumes] Hopefully, it will be long enough to get our Keanu Reeves back.
[The Colorado Supreme Court, day.]
CARTMAN
You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right.
CHIEF JUSTICE
Well I'm sorry, young man, but the parents want their child kept alive. I don't believe you have any legal authority here.
CARTMAN
I do have legal authority, your honor. You see, I was Kenny's... BFF.
JUDGE 2
Best friends forever?
CARTMAN
That's right. Kenny and I have been BFFs since first grade. Here, look. [brings forth a necklace with the left half of a BFF heart medallion] Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace. I believe you all know what that means, and how serious this is.
[Hell's Pass hospital, Kenny's room. Kenny's parents keep vigil with Stan and Kyle.]
CAROL
Look, Kenny, your friends are here to visit you again.
DOCTOR
[entering with a policeman] But this just doesn't seem right.
STUART
Wha, what's the matter, doctor?
DOCTOR
I'm afraid I've been given a court order to remove Kenny's feeding tube.
CAROL
What?
CARTMAN
[comes in with the Chief Justice] He's right in here.
KYLE
Cartman!
CHIEF JUSTICE
Kenny's BFF says that Kenny didn't want to be kept alive artificially. The courts have determined we must obey his wish.
KYLE
Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF!
POLICE OFFICER
Sir, take a look at this. [has Kenny's necklace in hand and points to the other half of the BFF medallion. the justice walks over the officer puts the two halves together]
CHIEF JUSTICE
[steps back] That's all the verification we need. Pull the feeding tube, doctor.
CAROL
No doctor! You can't!
DOCTOR
I'm sorry. I have no choice. [pulls the tube and drops it on the floor]
[Hell's Pass hospital, outside. Uriel and Gabriel arrive]
GABRIEL
Here is the hospital
URIEL
[the blonde angel without a shirt] This is hopeless, Gabriel. We cannot interact with anything on Earth, how could we possibly get a feeding tube removed?
KYLE
[exiting the hospital with Stan] That dirty no-good sonofabitch!
STAN
Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding tube out, he's gonna die for sure! [they walk through the angels, then the angels turn around]
GABRIEL
The tube has been removed?
KYLE
How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate?
URIEL
Apparently, some blessed child has done our work for us.
GABRIEL
Good. Now all we must do is pray nobody interferes with the child's death a second time.
KYLE
Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in!
STAN
Yeah!
GABRIEL
No!
STAN
Let's go to the, uh, media. We'll make everyone in the country know that they're killing Kenny.
KYLE
Yeah, come on! [grabs Kyle and they go away]
URIEL
No! No, no boys! Aw Goddammit! [the angels follow]
[HBC World News. Splashy graphics.]
ANCHOR
This is HBC News. A right-to-die case debate is heating up in Colorado, [Kenny is shown] where Kenny McCormick's feeding tube has been removed by his BFF. [a choked-up Cartman shows his half of the BFF medallion] Two boys are bringing national attention to this story by protesting outside the hospital.
[Hell's Pass hospital, outside. The protest has begun]
STAN
Don't kill Kenny!
ALL
You bastards!
STAN
Don't kill Kenny!
ALL
You bastards!
URIEL
[drifting through the crowd] No! No, they're not killing him, they're letting him die!
SKEETER
You bureaucrats have no right to play God and take that tube out!
GABRIEL
Nono, see, they were playing God when they put the feeding tube IN!
ANCHOR
A woman was arrested for trying to bring food to the patient. [Two officers haul Mrs. Garrison out of the emergency room]
MRS. GARRISON
Get your man-hands off of me!
ANCHOR
However, a growing number of people are also standing behind Kenny's BFF, Eric Cartman.
MAN 1
[in a crowd of people wearing BFF chains] We must respect the wishes of people's BFFs. Otherwise, all our BFF necklaces would become meaningless
MAN 2
We all have BFFs, and we believe that a BFF is the highest legal authority.
CARTMAN
That's right. Respect our authoritah.
[Satan watches on his TV, which is much nicer than the one in his bedroom. The hooded figure stands nearby]
SATAN
What mockery is this?!
HOODED FIGURE
My Lord...
SATAN
The feeding tube has been pulled! If the child dies and his soul returns to Heaven, God will have his Keanu Reeves!
HOODED FIGURE
Perhaps the child won't die in time.
SATAN
Forget it! I'm calling the attack off!
HOODED FIGURE
No! Keep your army marching, my Lord. I will get that feeding tube put back in. [turns and walks off]
SATAN
How?
HOODED FIGURE
I will do what we always do: Use the Republicans.
[The White House, a press conference on the lawn. People carry signs saying "Kenny Is Alive" "Murder Is Not A Choice" and "Don't Kill Kenny"]
GEORGE BUSH
We Republicans are deeply saddened by the tragic events in Colorado. [the crowd cheers]
HOODED FIGURE
[appears and whispers into Bush's right ear] Removing the feeding tube is murder, hughughughughughugh...
GEORGE BUSH
Removing the feeding tube is murder!
HOODED FIGURE
[whispers into Bush's left ear] Who are we to decide if Kenny should live or die?
GEORGE BUSH
Who are we to decide if Kenny should live or die?
HOODED FIGURE
[whispers into Bush's right ear] It is God's will that he live!
GEORGE BUSH
It is God's will that he LIVE! [the hooded figure hisses into Bush's left ear] Haaghaghaghaghaghagha...
HOODED FIGURE
No no, you don't say that part. [hisses into Bush's right ear]
GEORGE BUSH
No no, you don't say that part, haghaghaghagha. [the crowd looks at him in stunned silence]

The biggest battle of all time is about to begin: the battle of the feeding tube! As people on both sides of the argument vie for media attention.
[Kenny's hospital room. Both sides of the controversy chatter away]
KYLE
We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain!
CARTMAN
I believe the people at home see he's NOT in pain because he's a tomato!
KYLE
You say tomato, but I say Kenny!
CARTMAN
You say Kenny, but I say tomato! [both sides yell at each other]
CARTMAN'S SIDE
Tomato!
KYLE'S SIDE
Kenny! Kenny!
CARTMAN'S SIDE
Tomato!
JUDGE
[The executioner of Kenny's will] Uuhh, excuse me. I uh, just found the last page of Kenny's will. [Everyone quiets down]
CARTMAN
What?
JUDGE
I found the page where Kenny specified his wishes about being on life support.
STAN
Well, what does it say?
JUDGE
[clears his throat] If I should ever be in a vegetative state and kept alive on life support, please... [flips to the last page] for the love of God, don't ever show me in that condition on national television. [not a word is uttered for a few seconds]
STAN
Oooo.
MAN
Oowhoops
KYLE
Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand. This issue is so complicated, but... m-maybe we sh-should just let Kenny go in peace.
STAN
You mean, Cartman's side is right?
KYLE
Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons.
BOTH SIDES
Yeah.
KYLE
Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone. [everyone walks out.]
[HBC World News.]

GABRIEL
Michael! Michael! [he and Uriel bring Kenny to Michael] The humans finally did the right thing!
MICHAEL
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Get him into the command station! Hurry! [Uriel and Gabriel sit Kenny down and strap him in] Satan's army charges! Tell our troops what to do, Kenny! [Kenny sets to work on the Golden PSP, manning the controls like a pro] So it begins. [Gabriel and Uriel leave Kenny to his task and fly off. The camera focuses on Michael] Now we shall see the final battle between Heaven and Hell play out! [Kenny continues playing, and Michael provides commentary] Yesss, good, Kenny! The angel spearmen are taking out their demon soul rippers! Oh, the cavalry angels are clashing with their Black Knights! Oh my God! My God, this battle is epic! Ohh, they're bringing in their demon dragons! Look at the size of them! My God, this is even bigger than the final battle in the Lord of the Rings movie! It's like, it's like TEN times bigger than that battle!
[Hell. Satan is watching the battle through his crystal ball]
SATAN
No! NO! How are we losing?! [the spy angel returns]
SPY ANGEL
The child's soul is in Heaven! God has his secret weapon!
SATAN
Full retreat!
HOODED FIGURE
Patience, my Lord!
SATAN
No, Kevin! [turns and glares at him] That's it! I'm breaking up with you! [one blast from his eyes and Kevin is dead]
[Heaven. Kenny's still at it]
MICHAEL
Yesss. Yes, Kenny! Satan's forces are retreating! This is TRULY a sight to behold! OH I wish I had a camcorder! [Kenny continues to play] We have done it! We have defeated the armies of Satan! [the angels in the battlefield look around and celebrate weakly. The angels then gather around Kenny, and Peter joins them.]
PETER
Kenny! Bless your soul! You've saved all of Heaven!
MICHAEL
Yes, Kenny! And to thank you for all you've done, we are going to give you a very special gift. For saving the entire universe from the forces of evil, we give you this. [two angels haul something into view] Keanu Reeves' statue. [a ten-foot statue of Keanu Reeves on a three-foot base] Congratulations. [everyone claps for him]

[the field]
KYLE

BUTTERS
I see a ladybug- Hello lady ladybug. [Stan simple stretches out his left arm and catches the ball, then pitches it to Alan. Alan swings and misses]
UMPIRE
Strike.
MR. VARCAS
That was no strike! What the hell is wrong with you, ref?
RANDY
Good call, ref! Good call!
MR. VARCAS
Come on, Allen! This pitcher throws like a girl!
RANDY
What'd you say?!
MR. VARCAS
You heard me, asshole!
RANDY
You want me to kick your ass right here?! [Mr. Barkas stands and looks at him]
SHARON
Randy, sit down.
MR. VARCAS
You want a piece of me?! 'Cause I'm pretty sick of your Goddamned mouth!
RANDY
[takes off his shirt and throws it aside and challengers] Whattaya wanna do, huh? Whattaya wanna do?
SHARON
Randy, don't!
MR. VARCAS
You'd better shut up, asshole!
RANDY
I'm standin' right here! How do you wanna handle it?
MR. VARCAS
I told you to SHUT UP! [throws his beer at Randy. Randy takes his beer and throws it at Mr. Barkas. They start fighting back and forth. Stan looks on from the pitcher's mound]
STAN
[turns away and hides his face in his right hand] Aw Jesus, not again.
KYLE
Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season! [Stan puts on his game face and throws the pitch. Alan swings and misses]
UMPIRE
Strike three! You're out!
STAN
Yes! It's over! It's over!
LOCAL ANNOUNCER 1
That's it. South Park wins the game 4 to 0.
CARTMAN
[runs to the mound] We're done! No more baseball!
KYLE
No more boring baseball until next year!
STAN
We can start having fun again! [falls to the ground and rolls around]
CARTMAN
All right, we did it! [the rest of the team shows up and celebrates]
STAN
We did it! We did it!
STEPHEN
[as the coach, arrives] Yeah, we did it, boys! We did it! We're going to the finals! Woohoo! [the boys stop cheering and look at him]
STAN
... What?
STEPHEN
Well we won! That means we've got the best record in the division! [the parents rush onto the field]
GERALD
Congratulations, boys! You're goin' on to the post-season. Woohoo!
CARTMAN
Post-season?
KYLE
Nobody said anything about a post-season.
TOM
[Craig's Dad] There's more little-league baseball for South Park! Yehheah! [the adults begin celebrating while the kids are dumb-struck]
STAN
No... NOOO!!
[Outside, after the game. Randy is hauled off to a waiting Conifer patrol car, drunk and tattered. His pants are down to his ankles]
RANDY
This is for what?! Arresting me for what?! I'm not allowed to stand up for myself?! I thought this was America! Huh?! Isn't this America?! I'm sorry, I thought this was America! [he's put into the back seat]
[Whistlin' Willy's, night. The boys are gathered there for a pizza dinner]
KYLE
I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing.
CARTMAN
Nobody told us if we win too many games we'd go on to the finals!
STAN
Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad.
CRAIG
Not all that bad? How could you say that?! You hate this game more than any of us!
STAN
I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over.
BUTTERS
Well yeah, but... we usually win.
CRAIG
All the other teams are worse than us.
JIMMY
Yeah. Let's face it, we're winners.
STAN
I know we can lose if we try.
KYLE
You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport.
BUTTERS
Yeah. My dad always said "It's Okay to lose, but if you don't try, wuh you're grounded, Mister."
THE OTHER BOYS
Yeah, uh huh.
STAN
Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team quietly that we're gonna let them win, and then we'll act like we're trying. Our parents will never know.
BUTTERS
We'd better hope they never know, or else there's gonna be heck to pay. Heck, I tell ya!
[At the entrance of Whistlin' Willy's, the adults are gathered, relaxing]
GERALD
Boy, that was great, wasn't it?!
ROGER
Yeah, our boys really stuck it to 'em! [the doors open and Randy walks in]
RANDY
Heeey!
MEN
Heeey!
STEPHEN
You're out. [hands Randy a beer]
GERALD
How much was bail this time? [hands Randy a beer]
STAN
Hundred bucks, no big whoop.
RICHARD
Boy, you really beat the crap out of that Conifer dad.
RANDY
Well somebody had to put that knucklehead in his place.
STEPHEN
Yeah, well, you'd better watch yourself in the playoffs.
RANDY
Wha-what do you mean?
STEPHEN
I mean, you always get in a fight with scrappy redneck dats up here in the mountains, but some of those Division Two dads are tough!
GERALD
Yeah, those dads get REALLY drunk and obnoxious.
RANDY
I can fight anybody. I just need to train. I just need to get in the best shape of my life.
[The master bedroom at the Marsh house. The alarm clock clicks 7:30 and the radio comes on]
DJ
...the Beatles in the White Album in Helter Skelter. Okay- [Randy clicks the radio off]
[Randy rises from the bed and sits up, leaves the bed and shrugs, and wipes his nose a bit. He enters the kitchen, gets a glass, then goes to the refrigerator. He gets three eggs, cracks them open on the rim of the glass, and pours them into the glass. He picks up the glass and moves off a bit, then pours the eggs into a hot pan and scrambles them. He then picks up a beer, drinks, burps, and farts]
[Fort Collins baseball field, night]
FC ANNOUNCER
We want to welcome all South Park parents to Fort Collins, and the Little League Division One Playoffs. [applause all around as the teams meet on the field]

FC ANNOUNCER

UMPIRE
¡Strrrrike tres!
PUEBLO TEAM
Bueno bueno! Bueno! Espectacular!
PUEBLO DAD

STAN
Oh no. No, no, no!
[Outside the restaurant, day. Randy stands by the curb looking into space. He has a black eye. The doors open and Stan walks out]
STAN
Dad? Dad, we need to talk.
RANDY
[doesn't move] Can you believe it, Stan? State Championship game. It's... the greatest thing ever.
STAN
[sighs] Goddamnit. [goes back into the restaurant]
RANDY
I've worked hard, believed in myself, and now I'm gonna be fighting in a State Championship game. [smiles] This is gonna be the biggest fight of my life.
[South Park News]
ANNOUNCER
This is News 4, at noon.
[Coors Field, in Denver]
ANCHOR TOM
The Colorado Little League State Championship is being played this week. Two teams of youngsters get to go head to head at the major-league stadium downtown.
REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing here with the little sluggers and some of their parents, and I can't tell you how excited they are.
STAN
I don't suppose you guys want to win this game.
DENVER PLAYER
Win? Why the hell would we want to win?
DENVER PLAYER 2
Yeah. Then we'd have to play this boring game all summer.
REPORTER
[draws closer to the teams] Little Stan Marsh is the pitcher for the South Park Little League team, and Stan, how does it feel to be playing for the State Championship?
STAN
Gay.
REPORTER
Mr. Marsh, you must be very proud of your son.
RANDY
They've worked really hard to get here, Chris, and, you know, I don't like to really "trash-talk," but, I don't think Denver has a chance.
REPORTER CHRIS
Oho, well, I'm sure some of the Denver kids' parents would disagree with you and your team-
BAT DAD
[blue headdress and cape, pops in] Oh yeah! Oh yeah! [leaps closer to the camera] South Park is goin' down! Feel it comin'! [humps back to Randy] You ain't got a chance, South Park! Here we go, Denver, here we go! Huh, huh!
SHEILA
Who's that?
A WOMAN
That's Tom Nelson, one of the Denver players' fathers. He goes to every game in that ridiculous outfit and usually drinks too much and gets into a fight.
TOM NELSON
There ain't no way some little mountain kids can beat Denver. Not with my son on second base!
REPORTER CHRIS
Oho, looks like we got some parental trash talking going on here. Mr. Marsh, any comments?
RANDY
Well I think that there's a uh...
TOM NELSON
Mr. Marsh? Who wants to hear from a Mr. Marsh?! Iii am the ultimate Little League trash-talking father! Iii am the Bat Dad!
DENVER COP
[one of two come to take him away] All right, Mr. Nelson, let's go, come on.
TOM NELSON
Bat Dad knows no fear! Bat Dad knows no pain! I want you, Marsh! I want you!!
REPORTER CHRIS
Well, tension is certainly high here, but I guess everything will be decided on the playing field.
RANDY
[realizing he could end up like that] Oh my God.
DENVER PLAYER 3
Good luck! You're gonna need it.
DENVER PLAYER 4
Yeah, you can't lose to us. We're terrible. [the Denver team leaves, as do all the adults]
KYLE
Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game.
CARTMAN
Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team.
CLYDE
Like that motorcycle kid in Bad News Bears.
CARTMAN
Exactly right, Clyde. So what we need... is to find somebody to join our team, who totally sucks ass.
STAN
Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win.
CRAIG
But who?
KYLE
I know who.
[The airport, day]
ANNOUNCER
Announcing the arrival of flight six seven three, from New York City. [among the people leaving the airport is Kyle's cousin, Kyle]
KYLE SCHWARTZ
I'm baaack!
KYLE
There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play. [the team goes up to greet him]
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Hello, cousin Kyle. Oh Jesus, that flight was terrible. They served a chicken dish with hot sauce and it gave me gas.
KYLE
Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team.
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Well, you said you needed my help to win the big game, so here I am. I'll need a wipe cloth if I'm gonna play, though. Sometimes I sweat from holding the bat for so long and then the heat steams up my glasses.
CRAIG
He's perfect.
STAN
Yeah, with him on our team, we don't stand a chance.
[Coors Field. No one is in there except Randy, who walks along the stands looking around. He sees a sign that sais "Colorado Little League State Championship." He moves along. Next, he's at a beach far from Colorado looking at the sunset. He sneaks back into his bedroom as Sharon sleeps, closes the door softly, and sits on the side of the bed.]
RANDY
[softly] ...I'm not gonna go. [Sharon's eyes opem, and she rises a bit]
SHARON
What?
RANDY
Stan's little league game, I'm... I'm not gonna go.
SHARON
Why?
RANDY
I just... don't think I can, all right?
SHARON
You don't think you can?! This is the biggest game of your son's life! Why wouldn't you go and support him? What-? [Randy rises and faces her]
RANDY
Because I'm scared, all right?! [Sharon stays quiet] You wanna break me down?! You wanna hear me say it?! I'm scared! I don't know if I believe in myself anymore. [turns away and bows his head] I don't know if I can take this guy, Sharon.
SHARON
So then, don't. You don't have to get in fights with other parents at Little League games! Just sit there and watch!
RANDY
Look, I get what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to realize that I have to fight him because it's who I am.
SHARON
No, I'm telling you you don't have to get thrown out of games and make an ass of yourself.
RANDY
I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, Sharon. But you have to take Stan to his Little League game alone. [walks off]
[Coors Field, day]
ANNOUNCER
Welcome to the Colorado Little League State Championship Game! [the crowd cheers] This must be pretty exciting for these youngsters. A chance to go to the national circuit. [the teams meet at the pitcher's mound]
DENVER PITCHER
You know what these guys look like to me? A bunch of winners!
DENVER CATCHER
Yeah! We're about to get our asses kicked!
CARTMAN
I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game!
DENVER PITCHER
You're the best!
KYLE
You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title!
DENVER PITCHER
Not a chance, 'cause we're gonna lose to you right now!
BAT DAD
Here we go, Denver! These South Park kids got nothin' on you! Let's go, Denver!
WOMAN
Chris, will you sit down?
ANNOUNCER
[in the Press Box] First up to bat for South Park, Kyle Schwartz. [Kyle 1 comes up to bat]
KYLE SCHWARTZ
[stands on home plate] Where do I stand?
UMPIRE
R-right over here. [Kyle 1 looks, then goes to one side of the plate with his back to the pitcher. The umpire positions him properly]
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Don't throw the ball too fast, because I might get startled and I have asthma. [The pitcher throws the ball. Kyle 1 pulls his bat back]
UMPIRE
Strike 1!
SP TEAM
Yeah! All right!
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Jesus, not so close! That was three feet from hitting me in the head!
SECOND BASEMAN
He's not gonna swing! Throw balls!
KYLE SCHWARTZ
[swings and misses] Oh Jesus!
UMPIRE
Strike 2!
SP TEAM
Yeah!
STAN
Wow, he IS great at sucking.
CARTMAN
[happily] We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose!
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Don't throw it so hard or so close next time! Is it cold out here? I think I need a jacket. [The pitcher squints and focuses on the bat, which says "Barry Bonds" on it. The pitcher throws the ball and hits the bat, which falls out of Kyle Schwartz's hands]
UMPIRE
It's a bunt!
ROGER
Run kid, run!
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Oh Jesus! [runs towards first base]
KYLE
Aw crap! [Stan drops. Kyle 1 goes towards second and no one is stopping him. He passes it]
KYLE SCHWARTZ
[out of breath] I can't, I can't keep running like this! I have corns in my feet!
STEPHEN
Keep running, kid! [one of the SP players has his face buried in his right hand]
BAT DAD
Throw the ball to third, you idiots! He's runnin' home! [Kyle 1 heads towards home and passes that]
UMPIRE
Safe! [the crowd cheers and the scoreboard displays him and "HOMERUN!!!!" underneath. Smaller screens on the board display fireworks]
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Oh Jesus, did you see that? I hit a homerun! High-five, everybody! [nobody high-fives him]
KYLE
Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat.
STAN
Dude, we had it all wrong. While we spent all our time trying to make our team suck, these guys practiced and got really good at sucking. [next pitch: the ball hits the bat again, and the SP runner has to go to first, as it's a bunt. Tolkien goes up. The pitch hits the bat at the top - another bunt]
TOLKIEN
No!
MR. WILLIAMS
Yeeaahh! Go Tolkien go!
[Denver is up to bat]
BAT DAD
All right, Denver! You're up to bat now! [Butters is waving his hand for some reason, and the Danver batter squints and focuses on Butters' glove. Stan pitches, the batter hits, and Butters catches the ball. He's dismayed to find it in his glove.]
UMPIRE
Out!
DENVER TEAM
Yaaay!
KYLE
Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out! [the scoreboard is updated in time-lapse: Denver doesn't have a run on there.] Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long.
BUTTERS
[frustrated, takes his cap off and throws it on the ground] Son of a biscuit!
[Coors field, later]
ANNOUNCER
It's the bottom of the last inning here at Coors Field; the score is South Park 23, Denver 0. [a tired Stan pitches right down the middle and the Denver player doesn't move]
UMPIRE
Strike 1!
BAT DAD
Come on, Denver! Get the lead out! Do not cross the Bat Daaad!
GERALD
Geez I really wish this guy would shut up.
BAT DAD
Why don't you just go home, South Park? You can't beat Denver!
A VOICE
Denver sucks ass! [Bat Dad looks over. Randy has arrived with a tray of five beers. He's ready to rumble. He sits three rows behind Bat Dad, next to Sharon] Come on, South Park! These kids can't play! In fact, these kids are terrible! [Stan pitches, the batter swings after Cartman catches the ball]
UMPIRE
Strike 2!
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Oh Jesus, we're gonna win! I I never won a sport before; this is so exciting.
RANDY
It's over, Denver! South Park whupped your ass!
BAT DAD
You'd better shut your mouth before I shut it for you!
RANDY
[stands up, takes off his shirt, and challenges] What do you wanna do, huh? [Bat Dad climbs over the seats and he and Randy begin to fight, taking it to the aisle]
STAN
[sees, turns away and hides his face in his right hand] This can't get any worse. [the two men continue fighting at the bottom of the level and towards the foul pole. Bat Dad picks Randy up and throws him over the railing. Randy bounces off a bench, breaking it in two.]
BAT DAD
[stands on the railing and spreads his cape wide open] Now for the finishing move! You're about to be Bat-Dadded! [jumps off, but misses Randy entirely. They end up in the bullpen.]
COMMENTATOR
It all comes down to this! South Park is just one pitch away from being State Champions. [Bat Dad delivers blow after blow and has Randy on the run] Oh geez, it looks like two parents are fighting. They'd better be careful. The Little League has a no-tolerance policy.
UMPIRE
[comes out of home plate towards the men] Stop! Stop, or you're gonna get your teams disqualified!
STAN
[comes off the mound and stands next to Kyle] Disqualified? [looks at Kyle for a few seconds] Fight! Keep fighting! [the fighting continues, and two more umpires enter the picture]
UMPIRE 2
Break it up! Break it up! [the fighting continues. Bat Dad delivers a blow, shown in slow motion. It connects, and Randy falls backwards to the ground] That's enough! The next person that fights is getting his team disqualified!
BAT DAD
He's done for anyway. [walks off. Randy rises, slowly]
STAN
Come on, Dad! Get up!
KYLE
Get up! You have to fight! [Randy is trying]
UMPIRE 2
All right, come on! Let's play ball!
SP TEAM

UMPIRE 2
Stop, stop right now! [Randy continues the assault] I'm warning you, sir! [Randy begins singing in falsetto, then knocks Bat Dad to the ground with one final blow.] That's it! That's it! South Park is disqualified!
SP TEAM
Yeah!
SP ADULTS
Aww!
COMMENTATOR
South Park has been disqualified from the game! Denver wins! [The South Park team goes over to Randy, take off their hats, and celebrate their defeat. The Denver players are dismayed at this turn of events and throw down their caps. Two Denver officers come in to get Randy]
KYLE SCHWARTZ
We... We lost?
RANDY
[now arrested and turned around] What? I thought this was a free country! [now being escorted out of the Field]
STAN
Dad! [the guards let go and Randy turns around] You're the greatest. [Randy leaps for joy!]
End of The Losing Edge

synopsis:Cartman is sure he's dead and Butters is sure that Eric Cartman's ghost is haunting him. Together they attempt to make amends to all the people Cartman has wronged over the years.

script:The Death of Eric Cartman

[Stan's house, night. The boys are in the kitchen sitting at the breakfast table anticipating something. Next to Kenny is a stack of plates]
STAN
[impatiently tapping the table] Dude, where is she? We can't wait.
KYLE
God, this is gonna be sooo yummy.
CARTMAN
Stan, you said your mom was bringing Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner! Now is she or isn't she?! [Sharon arrives]
SHARON
Hi boys.
STAN
Mom!
KYLE
She's here!
CARTMAN
She's got Colonel!
KYLE
I want some!
CARTMAN
Oh boy!
STAN
[twirling around] I want a breast!
CARTMAN
Some extra-crispy thighs, extra crispy?
SHARON
Uuh uh uh, not so fast. You boys can help bring in the other groceries in the car, then have your chicken.
THE BOYS
Awww!
STAN
But Mom, we've been waiting for hours!
SHARON
It won't take a minute.
CARTMAN
Come on guys. If we all help out, we can do it super-fast.
STAN
All right.
KYLE
[firmly] Let's go. Oh my God, that smells good. [Cartman stays behind and quickly sits back down. As the other boys head out of the kitchen, Cartman rips the skins off the chicken pieces and wolfs them down. Sharon and the other boys return with the groceries.]
STAN
Okay, this is everything, mom. [the boys return to their seats]
KYLE
All right, let's eat Colonel! [Cartman leaves as the others sit]
STAN
Oh, boy! [they see the denuded chicken pieces. Stan looks at Cartman in anger] Cartman, you ate the skin off of EVERY PIECE OF CHICKEN!
CARTMAN
[turns around] Well, I saved you all the chicken part. [quiet burp]
KYLE
The skin's the best part...
CARTMAN
[puts on his jacket] Well, I gotta go home, guys. I'm gonna sit on the toilet and read comic books. See you at the bus stop tomorrow. [he leaves the kitchen. The boys are puzzled as to what to do about it. Burying his head in his arms, Kenny sobs]
[The next morning the boys are waiting at the bus stop, still infuriated from last night. Cartman hasn't arrived]
STAN
I can't believe that fat asshole!
KYLE
You can't believe it?? He does this shit all the time!
STAN
Well this time he's gone too far!
KENNY
(Yeah, fuck him!)
STAN
Why do we even hang out with him, anyway?
KYLE
Hello?? I've been saying this for years!
STAN
Well it's not like we're nice to him. I mean, we rip on him all the time!
KYLE
Yes, but he thrives on that.
STAN
All right. Then let's just ignore him. From now on, let's not talk to him, let's not even acknowledge him.
KENNY
(Fuck yeah!)
KYLE
That sounds great!
CARTMAN
[arriving] Hey fags, what's going on? [no one says a word] Dude, I was on the toilet all night from that chicken. I thought I was gonna die. [silence]
KYLE
Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow?
STAN
I think I have extra.
CARTMAN
Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There's a new one. [Stan fishes around for some money in his pockets, walks over a bit, and gives it to Kyle] Yuh, you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes?
STAN
Here you go.
KYLE
Thanks. [Stan returns to his post next to Kenny]
CARTMAN
Dude, Stan, yuh you know why Jews have glassy eyes? Like Kyle? [neither of them says a thing] Eh. K-Kenny, you see that chick on the news that had her left titty cut off? [chuckles. Kenny scratches his right side a bit] Kenny? Kenny?? [the bus pulls up and opens the door. The boys head inside. Stan enters first] Stan? Stan, it's me, Eric! [Kenny enters next] Eh... Kenny. Kenny, you want fifty cents? [Kyle enters last] Dude, look at me, Kyle, I'm right here! [Seeing no reaction, Cartman is stunned. The door closes and the bus pulls away] Wha...? How did...? Like they couldn't see or hear me. It's almost as if I were... [close-up] dead. [dramatic music] No. No, I can't be dead. [runs off] I can't be dead!!
[The Cartman house, later. A plumber has come to visit, and he's in the living room talking to Mrs. Cartman. Two other plumbers are carrying away a box]
BLACK PLUMBER
All right, ma'am. We've got your new toilet installed and we'll haul away the old one away for ya.
LIANE
Oh, you've been so helpful, I uh, just don't know how to thank you.
BLACK PLUMBER
Hunh, I could think of a few ways, hunh.
LIANE
Ohoho, nhn.
[Cartman runs back home, but he stops in his tracks before he reaches the front door. He sees the two men carrying the box away and he fears the worst]
CARTMAN
No! No!!
FAT PLUMBER
What happened? Did they say?
THIN PLUMBER
Apparently there was so much chicken skin in the system it just ruptured the insides.
FAT PLUMBER
Aww, that's tragic.
CARTMAN
Oh my God, this can't be happening! [he then hears his mother wailing softly, then louder] Mom? Mom's crying? Oh God, it is true! [he gets closer to her window. Inside his mother's room, on her bed, the black plumber is pounding Liane from behind, but the bed's noise does not reach Cartman's ears. Cartman turns, wailing.] Oh, it's not fair! [falls to his knees and cries out] Why??? Why??? [cries some more. Liane cries out some more as well]
[The playground, recess]
JIMMY
Hey fellas, w-where is Cartman? [Kyle catches a football]
STAN
Cartman isn't our friend anymore. [throws the football back]
KYLE
We're ignoring him.
TOLKIEN
Ignoring him? How come?
KYLE
Because he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath!
TOLKIEN
Oh yeah.
CRAIG
Hey, I hate Cartman too. Can I ignore him with you?
BRADLEY
Yeah.
KEVIN
Me too.
OTHER BOYS
Yeah, screw him! Yeah.
CLYDE
I never realized ignoring him was an option.
CARTMAN
[arriving] Guys! Guys? [the two teams are seen: On screen left are Jimmy, Tolkien, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. On screen right are Timmy, Craig, Clyde, Kevin, and the blond boy. The teams toss the football at each other] Can anybody hear me? You guys?? [approaches Tolkien] Tolkien, Tolkien, I'm here! [leaves] Hello! Hello! Hello! [approaches Clyde] Clyde, can't you feel me? [moves him around, but no reaction from Clyde] Feel me, Clyde! [moves on to Jimmy] Jimmy! Jimmy, it's me, Eric! [blows on Jimmy] Jimmy! [puff] Can't you feel your hair move?! That's me! [turns away] They don't even know yet, that one of their best friends is dead. [begins to tear up] Dead and... still wandering the earth a lost soul.
[Downtown, later. He wanders the streets of the town crying, and no one turns to see what's wrong, until...]'']
WOMAN
What is that kid doing?
MAN
Ah I don't know, just ignore him.
[A blazing sunset over a bridge. Cartman's cries have gotten deeper, more emotional]
[Night time, under a full moon, Cartman walks past a farm house. Nearby are a scarecrow and a few pumpkins]
[Next day, Butter's house. He's shoveling snow off the sidewalk to the front door]
BUTTERS
Lu lu lu, I've got some apples. Lu lu lu, you've got some too-
CARTMAN
[walking by, lamenting his fate] What did I do to deserve this?! [Butters pays attention] How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?!
BUTTERS
Hey Eric! [goes back to shoveling snow. Cartman stops in his tracks]
CARTMAN
...What did you say?
BUTTERS
Huh I just said, "Hey Eric!"
CARTMAN
Butters... [runs back to Butters] Butters! You can see me??
BUTTERS
Well, sure I can see you.
CARTMAN
Oh my God, and you can hear me??
BUTTERS
[giggles] Well, jeez Eric, why wouldn't I be able to hear you?
CARTMAN
Because, Butters, I'm... dead. [a few moments of silence]
BUTTERS
[screams and drops his shovel and runs off, hiding behind the family car. Cartman follows him]
CARTMAN
Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you!
BUTTERS
You died?? How??
CARTMAN
I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides.
BUTTERS
But if you're d-dead, how come I can see you?
CARTMAN
I don't know, but you're the only one who can.
BUTTERS
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! [runs toward the front door, opens it and runs inside, slamming it shut]
CARTMAN
Butters! [tries to open the door, then pounds on it furiously] Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help!
[The Stotch kitchen. Linda is cleaning the sink and humming to herself. She reaches down below the sink and opens the doors. Butters is hiding there.]
LINDA
Butters, what on earth are you doing??
BUTTERS
Well I think... I'm like the kid in that movie! I-I'm seeing dead people!
LINDA
Dead people?
STEPHEN
Who's seeing dead people?
BUTTERS
Me! I saw a ghost!
STEPHEN
Now, Butters, there's no such thing as ghosts.
BUTTERS
But I saw him! Just as plain as I'm seein' you right now!
STEPHEN
Butters, these things happen all the time. You've got a very active little brain and your mind was just playing tricks on you.
BUTTERS
Ruh, really?
STEPHEN
Yeess.
BUTTERS
So... so it was just... it was... just my ima... magination then?
STEPHEN
That's right. There's no reason to be afraid of things that aren't real. There's plenty of real things to be scared of. Like super-AIDS.
BUTTERS
Huh s-s-super-AIDS?
STEPHEN
That's right. A new form of AIDS which is resistant to drugs. Just one teaspoon of super-AIDS in your butt and you're dead in three years.
BUTTERS
AAAH! [drops his flashlight] Oh Jesus.
STEPHEN
So now you feel better? Ghosts don't exist and there's nothing to be afraid of. Except the super-AIDS.
[Night time at Butters' house. The sky is clear, but lightning bolts come out of nowhere and just as quickly disappear. Butters is in his bed looking out at the stormy sky and can't get to sleep.]
BUTTERS
Nuh-nothing to be scared of. Jus, just some lightning and thunder. [closes his eyes, but a thunderclap opens his eyes wide] Gah! Wasn't nothin' neither. J-just a mouse. [he looks out the window again. Cartman is seen standing by the bedroom door]
CARTMAN
Butters...
BUTTERS
[points] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! [turns away and ducks under his covers]
CARTMAN
Butters, you have to help me!
BUTTERS
Go away! You aren't real!
CARTMAN
All right, Butters, you leave me no choice. [pulls out a chain, rattles it, and utters ghostly sounds]
BUTTERS
[panics, screaming] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! [Cartman leaves the bedside and hides. Butters' door opens and his parents walk in]
STEPHEN
Butters, what is going on?!
BUTTERS
Well I saw... [points to... nothing] Well he was... [sees there's nothing to prove] Nothin' I-I just had a nightmare.
STEPHEN
Well you'd better stop having nightmares or else you're gonna be grounded!
BUTTERS
Y yes, yes sir. [they leave, but Stephen takes one last quick look around, then closes the door. Butters mumbles a few things, then tries to sleep]
CARTMAN
[suddenly on the bed] Butters.
BUTTERS
AH- [quickly muffles his mouth so his parents don't hear]
CARTMAN
Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me!
BUTTERS
But I don't want to see you!
CARTMAN
Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven.
BUTTERS
Well... how do you know you're supposed to go to Heaven?
CARTMAN
What do you mean?
BUTTERS
Well... how do you know you're not supposed to go to... you know... Heck.
CARTMAN
I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?!
BUTTERS
Oh.
CARTMAN
Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you.
BUTTERS
I can't. Ahah, I have school tomorrow.
CARTMAN
This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life! [brings out the chain, rattles it, and makes ghostly noises with his voice]
BUTTERS
Helll- Uh all right. All right, I'll help you!
[Dawn at Cartman's Residence, the next day. Butters and Cartman approach Cartman's house. Liane is in the kitchen using a cookie cutter to cut out heart-shaped cookies. Butters and Cartman enter the kitchen. Cartman is sobbing into a small towel.]
BUTTERS
Mrs. Cartman?
LIANE
Yes? [turns around] Oh hi.
BUTTERS
This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something.
LIANE
Oh, what is it?
CARTMAN
[emotional] Tell her, tell her that I love her.
BUTTERS
He says, he love you. [Cartman sobs]
LIANE
[moved] Oh, that's so nice.
CARTMAN
[emotional] Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!
BUTTERS
He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.
CARTMAN
[emotional] It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted!
BUTTERS
He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted.
LIANE
Oh, that's so sweet. [teary-eyed] Oh, I love you too, poopiekins! [sobs. Cartman sobs too, and then Butters sobs in sympathy]
[The Broflovski house. Butters and Cartman approach it first and ring the bell. Kyle comes to answer it]
BUTTERS
Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew. [Cartman sobs. Kyle looks, then gets annoyed] He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times.
CARTMAN
Just the good times.
KYLE
There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!
CARTMAN
I can't! Don't you understand?!
BUTTERS
He can't! Don't you understand?!
CARTMAN
God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me!
BUTTERS
God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him!
CARTMAN
[whips out a notepad] All right, come on, Butters, we gotta go tell Tolkien I'm sorry for rippin' on him for bein' black. [turns around and walk off]
BUTTERS
Uhh alright then. [Butters turns to follow, and Kyle is left looking puzzled]
[Kyle's living room. Stan and Kenny are playing a board game on the living room floor. Kyle enters and approaches them]
STAN
Who was that?
KYLE
It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him.
STAN
Dude, he did that to me this morning.
KENNY
(Me too.)
KYLE
He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle.
KENNY
(That guy would try anything.)
STAN
Yeah, we know better than to think that.
[Butters and Cartman walk down a sidewalk, with Cartman checking off more names on his notepad.]
CARTMAN
Okay, that takes care of Tolkien, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That's everyone, I guess. [turns around] All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you.
BUTTERS
[shuffles his right foot out of modesty] Aww, that's okay, Eric.
CARTMAN
[puts away the notepad in his inside jacket pocket.] Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now.
BUTTERS
So I won't see you again?
CARTMAN
Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash.
BUTTERS
Wow.
CARTMAN
[backs up and waves his hands in front of him as if in a haze] G'bye Butters. I'm goin' to a better place. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime! Good-bye!! [Cartman steps back a bit more, then stops, then is annoyed]
BUTTERS
Yeh you're still here.
CARTMAN
Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on?
BUTTERS
Well, I guess saying goodbye wasn't enough.
CARTMAN
What else do I have to do?!
BUTTERS
Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did.
CARTMAN
Atone?
BUTTERS
Did you ever do anything really bad?
CARTMAN
[thinks] Not really...
[In Butters' bedroom, later]
CARTMAN
Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's fence and never told him about it.
BUTTERS
[writing] Broke fence...
CARTMAN
I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jews exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid.
BUTTERS
Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for.
CARTMAN
Really?
BUTTERS
Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this.
CARTMAN
I know how.
[Moments later Cartman's hands are shown placing fruits inside a basket, a pair of scissors cutting away at a thick transparent plastic sheet, then the whole basket sealed with a bow. He and Butters grin at the accomplishment. Behind them are some more baskets ready to go. The first basket goes to Principal Victoria. The second goes to Ms. Claridge. The third goes to the rabbi at the synagogue. The congregation there is surprised. The fourth goes to Scott Tenorman, who's sobbing at his parents' graves. Butters and Cartman walk to their next destination with another basket as Stan, Kyle, and Kenny look on from across the street. They deliver that basket to the abortion clinic. He records the song below, with Butters and a recording engineer in the booth. Next, he and Butters are repairing Mr. Anderson's fence. Cartman hammers the new boards in place as Butters removes the damaged boards. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny appear and watch. Kyle angrily rejects what he's seeing and they walk away. Cartman and Butters then go to the Special Olympics stadium and present a basket to the coordinators. They leave a basket at Sally Struthers' door. They're then back in Butters' bedroom and Butters marks off the last atonement.]
ERIC CARTMAN
I'm gonna make, make it right.
I'm gonna take a little time and set things right.
Make, make it right.
I'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels great.
It feels so good to be making up
For all the things I've done wrong.
I know now what the Good Lord in Heaven
Wanted from me all along.
All along, I'm gonna make, make it right.
Cause Jesus wants me to have a clean slate.
Not faking it, I'm making it right.
I'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels great.
Make, make it right!
Make, make it right!
Gonna make it right, girl, I've got to have your lovin' tonight!
CARTMAN
Well, there's everything, Butters. [stands up and walks off a bit] I've made everything right.
BUTTERS
Does this mean... you have to go now?
CARTMAN
Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave. [waves his hands around again as if in a haze] Goodbye Butters! Thanks for all your help! Be good and be safe. Goodbye... [his back hits the wall under the window, and he looks at his hands] Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right!
BUTTERS
Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason.
CARTMAN
I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?! [grabs Butters' bat and begins destroying his room with it. First to go is the lamp on top of the foot locker, then something else, then a picture of Butters sitting on a tree stump, then the television, then the television stand, ] Do you think this is funny?
BUTTERS
Eric! Calm down.
CARTMAN
[destroys the bookshelves, then the toy area] Stupid butthole God! [chucks the bat at Butters, who leans out of the way. The bat smashes his mirror apart. Cartman leaves. Butters surveys the damage, then his parents show up]
STEPHEN
Butters! What have you done?!
BUTTERS
I-I-it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!
LINDA
Oh, Stephen, I don't know if we should ground him or call a doctor.
STEPHEN
No, I think you'd better call a doctor. I'll ground him.
[Butters' house, later. Stephen holds Linda as the doctor on house call leaves Butters' bedroom]
LINDA
What do you think, Doctor?
DOCTOR
Your son is suffering from severe dementia. He claims that the ghost of a dead friend talks to him. This is usually a sign of schizophrenia brought on by some tragic event in the child's past. I think it's best that we take him to the mental center and do some tests.
LINDA
Oh no. [buries her face in Stephen's shoulder] NO!
[South Park Institute for Mental Health, day. In the operating room, Butters is wheeled into play on a gurney, face up]
DOCTOR
[in a booth with Butters' parents] All right, Butters, just try to relax. [two robot arms grab Butters along the sides of his torso and head, pick him up, and flip him over] Doin' just fine, Butters. [the arms reposition themselves and raise Butters a little higher. A big red anal probe closes in and begins to vibrate] Just stay perfectly still now, Butters.
BUTTERS
[nervous, tries to look back] Lu lu lu, lu lu lu [the anal probe enters and shakes him violently]
DOCTOR
Good. You're gonna feel a little pinch now, Butters. [the probe takes one last, deep jab. Then, to Stephen.] Don't worry, Mr. Stotch. Whatever traumatized your son in his past, we'll find it. [the robot arms now rock Butters back and forth as the probe does its stuff.]
[Butters' recovery room, later. The doctor and Butters' parents are at bedside]
DOCTOR
Well, after fourteen hours of testing, I can say Butters is definitely suffering from aggravated repressed memory syndrome. You see, Butters, when the brain wants to cover something up, it makes up images and sounds for you to hear.
BUTTERS
So... the ghost was in my head. The whole time.
STEPHEN
Now do you believe us, Butters?
BUTTERS
Yes! Uh yes sir! I believe you.
DOCTOR
Good. We're making a lot of headway. We'll do some more testing tomorrow. All right, folks. Let's let Butters get some rest. [they leave]
LINDA
[stays behind long enough to kiss Butters on the forehead] Goodnight, baby. [leaves. The lights go out]
BUTTERS
[relaxing and sleeps...] Ahhh. [...but Cartman appears at the foot of the bed]
CARTMAN
Butters.
BUTTERS
AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
CARTMAN
Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here.
BUTTERS
Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore.
CARTMAN
I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look! [shows Butters an ad for a psychic] Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do!
BUTTERS
Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event.
CARTMAN
She's gonna close soon! Come on! [pulls Butters out of bed and away]
BUTTERS
Wuh I hate my stupid psychotic brain!
[The psychic's house. The doorbell rings. She's watching television, but she gets up to answer the door. Cartman and Butters are there]
BUTTERS
[still with heavy eyelids] Hello, ma'am. May I talk to you?
PSYCHIC
Certainly. Come in. [Butters and Cartman follow her in] Have a seat and tell me what it is you seek.
BUTTERS
Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane.
PSYCHIC
Well, many times, the reason that the soul stays Earth-bound is because God is intending to use that soul for a divine purpose, to help prevent an impending tragic event.
CARTMAN
Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time!
PSYCHIC
But now, you shouldn't think you're crazy, young man. I see ghosts all the time.
BUTTERS
Really?
PSYCHIC
Yes. When's the last time you saw yours?
BUTTERS
Well, he's sittin' next to me right now.
PSYCHIC
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! [runs out of the room screaming. The TV turns on mysteriously behind the boys]
BUTTERS
Hey, I think she could see you too. You really are a ghost.
CARTMAN
I told you, Butters. [a breaking news item comes on]
ANNOUNCER
This is breaking news!
ANCHOR TOM
A tragic event is unfolding in South Park. Three convicted murderers have escaped from jail and are holding twelve people hostage at the Red Cross!
REPORTER CHRIS
Tom, the convicts were about to be arrested when they ran inside the Red Cross behind me, and threatened to kill all the workers inside. The violent men are demanding a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars cash.
CARTMAN
Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day!
[The Red Cross, later that night. A crowd has gathered and the police try to control the crowd]
OFFICER
Stay back, people!
MAN
Stay back?! Hell, my wife and child are in there!
DET. YATES
Stay calm in there. We don't want anybody getting hurt.
LEAD CONVICT
You get us a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars or these people start dyin', man!
[The Red Cross, outside. Butters and Cartman sneak past the police barricade]
CARTMAN
All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages.
BUTTERS
Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me.
CARTMAN
Don't worry. I have a plan. [movers towards an entrance]
BUTTERS
Eric. [Cartman turns around] Well, be careful, ghost pal.
CARTMAN
They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead. [Cartman moves towards the front door. The detective notices]
DET. YATES
What the hell is that kid doing?
[The Red Cross, inside. The convicts look out through the Venetian blinds]
BALD CONVICT
Somebody's comin' in!
CONVICT 2
It's just some little fat kid. [the door opens and Cartman walks in. He starts making haunting, ghostly noises and rattling desks]
BALD CONVICT
What the hell is going on?
CONVICT 2
I have no idea.
CARTMAN
Yes, it's working! [hops on a chair, picks up a book, waves it around, and flips the pages in the lead convict's face]
LEAD CONVICT
This is really weird. [Cartman walks over to a file cabinet, opens a drawer, and tosses out all sorts of papers. Butters enters the building, walking quietly as Cartman keeps the three convicts distracted]
[The Red Cross, outside.]
REPORTER CHRIS
An incredible development here, Tom. Two little boys have fearlessly gone inside the Red Cross. [footage of Cartman entering the building is shown]
[Stan's house. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny watch the news]
STAN
Cartman?
[The Red Cross, inside. Cartman swings two cowbells up and down. Butters has left the door open]
BALD CONVICT
[scratches his head] I'm so confused! [Butters goes over to the office, removes the chair blocking the door, and opens the door.]
BUTTERS
Hurry. Go, go! [the hostages leave quickly, quietly. They exit the Red Cross.]
OFFICER 2
The hostages are clear!
DET. YATES
[through the bull horn] All right, move in! [the officers move in. Cartman is dancing around shaking the bells and making ghostly noises]
CONVICT 2
The hostages are gone!
BALD CONVICT
What?! [the officers pour in and arrest the convicts] Son of a bitch.
REPORTER CHRIS
Tom, an incredible story of courage. Two little boys, armed only with the weapon of confusion, managed to go in and save the Red Cross. Nobody seems to know who the boys are or where they went off to, but they are heroes.
[The field across from the Red Cross. Cartman is about to take his leave for the third time]
CARTMAN
Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day.
BUTTERS
Boy, we sure did.
CARTMAN
My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends.
BUTTERS
Yeah. Uh I feel that way too.
CARTMAN
We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I'm gonna miss you.
BUTTERS
I'll miss you too, ghost pal.
CARTMAN
[backs up again, waving his hands before him] Goodbye Butters. I must be going now. I'll be looking down on you from time to time. Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters! Goodbye! [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny approach him from his right side, Clyde, Tolkien and Jimmy approach him from his left]
STAN
Hey Cartman, that was really cool what you did.
CLYDE
Yeah Eric, we're gonna stop ignoring you now. [both Cartman and Butters are stunned that everyone can suddenly see Cartman]
KYLE
We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have.
STAN
Well, anyway, we just wanna let you know. Talk to you tomorrow.
JIMMY
Yeah. S-see ya, Eric. [Butters looks down]
CARTMAN
[pissed off] You sonofabitch Butters!
BUTTERS
Huh?
CARTMAN
You told me I was a ghost!
BUTTERS
Huh but I thought you were one!
CARTMAN
How stupid are you?! So help me GOD Butters, I'm gonna get you back for this! I'm going to [points his finger at Butters] Get you back! [runs off. Butters just looks at him, baffled. His parents arrive with the doctor]
STEPHEN
[angered] Butters?!
BUTTERS
Oh hamburgers.
End of The Death of Eric Cartman


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The South Park Elementary School Talent Show is coming up and Jimmy can't wait to perform his comedy routine, but first he must find a way to gain control of his raging hormones.

script:Erection Day

[South Park Elementary, day. The school bell rings.]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, kids, as your counselor, I know it can sometimes be difficult to talk about subjects like drugs and sex and alcohol, m'kay? So, as you remember, last week I told you to write down any difficult questions you had and put them in this box anonymously so we could discuss those questions in class, m'kay? I got a lot o' responses, so let's read some aloud. [pulls out the first letter and reads] "Mr. Mackey is gay." [some of the kids laugh] Okay kids, that is not funny! M'kay?! This box is supposed to be used for serious questions! About, about serious issues! M'kay, let's, let's stop the tomfoolery. [puts it aside and reaches into the box for the next letter] M'kay, this looks like a real one here. [reads] "Dear Mr. Mackey, you are gay." [the class laughs] All right, all right. That's enough, kids. Let's quiet down and try to be mature, 'kay? [reaches in to read the next one] Uh here we go. Okay, "Mr. Mackey, sometimes my parents hit me, and you are gay." [the class laughs harder] Dammit, is there not one serious question in here?! [reads the next two letters] "Mr. Mackey is gay." "Mr. Mackey is gay." [gets the next letter] Okay, here. [reads] "I am a boy at South Park Elementary. Sometimes, when I'm sitting in class, my penis becomes hard for no reason. What should I do?" [Jimmy looks around nervously. Cartman cracks up, and the rest of the class, except Jimmy, follows] All right kids, all right kids, that's enough! [a small bell is heard and Jimmy looks down] If you all can't be serious about the question box, [turns and writes "drugs" on the board] then we'll just do drug identification exercises, unkay?!
CLASS
Awwwww!
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, uhh, Jimmy, why don't you come up here and write down the names of two narcotics?
JIMMY
Uh no, that-that's okay, Mr. Mackey.
MR. MACKEY
Jimmy, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you!
JIMMY
Uhhh, just uh ahh not right this second, Mr. Mackey.
MR. MACKEY
Well why the hell not?!
JIMMY
Uh... [waves him over. Mr. Mackey walks over and bends down to listen to Jimmy whisper in his ear]
MR. MACKEY
It's what... Oh, you do? R-right now, right now it is? M'kay, m'kay. Don't worry, Jimmy. [returns to the board] N'kay, uhhh, let's pick someone else. Um, Eric, why don't you come up here?
CARTMAN
Hey, that's bullcrap! How come Jimmy doesn't have to do it?!
MR. MACKEY
Well, because uh, Jimmy is pitching a tent right now. [Jimmy shows some alarm]
STAN
He's what?? [Kyle shrugs]
[South Park Elementary hallway. Kids milling around notice a poster on the pegboard among the lockers and talk amongst themselves.]
STAN
A hundred dollar gift certificate to South Park Mall? [the kids begin moving out of the way, leaving Stan, Kyle, and Kenny] Maybe we should do the talent show.
KYLE
Well, what's the point? Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy.
JIMMY
Hey fellas.
STAN
Dude, didja see, Jimmy? They're giving away a hundred-dollar first prize for the talent show.
JIMMY
Oh I sure have. I've been working on my ruh... ruh... routine all year long.
KYLE
I don't know how you do it, dude. How do you get up in front of that many people?
JIMMY
Well fellas, entertainment is my life. I love being in front of everyone. [his penis gets aroused] Aaah!
KYLE
Huh wuh, what's the matter?
JIMMY
I gotta guh, I gotta go! See ya fellas. [rushes away and down the hall] Eh, excuse me! Evuh evuh - excuh, cuh, cuse me! Excuse me, puh-please. [he grunts as he heads for the boys' room and enters, looking for an empty stall. He tries the first toilet stall]
CLYDE
It's occupied. [Jimmy tries the second stall]
CARTMAN
No room at the inn, Virgin Mary. [Jimmy heads back to the sinks and throws water on his face, then throws water on his pants' crotch]
BUTTERS
[enters and heads for the urinal] Hehey Jimmy! [arrives at the urinal, drops his trousers and lifts his shirt, and starts pissing] M'boy, did you see that first prize for the talent show? Why you must be excited! You'll probably win like always.
JIMMY
Yeah. Yeah, I'm real excited. REAL excited... for some reason... Oh, Jesus! What's wrong with me?
BUTTERS
[notices some heavy drops in the stalls] Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?! How about a courtesy flush?!
CARTMAN
Up yours, Butters.
[Jimmy's house, afternoon. Jimmy walks through the door and sighs. His parents are on the sofa. His mom reads a book, his dad a newspaper.]
SARAH
Hey Jimmy, how was school?
JIMMY
Fine, Mom.
RYAN
Jimmy, we understand you're getting erections in the classroom.
JIMMY
[stops in his tracks for a few seconds, then looks over his shoulder] What? Uh who told you that?
RYAN
Mr. Mackey, your counselor.
JIMMY
Aw J-j-j-j...j-Jesus!
RYAN
Now, Jimmy, it's nothing to be ashamed of. But we know it's something you might have a hard time talking about. Get it? A hard time. So, we took your counselor's advice 'nd called Doctor Pal to help us all talk about this.
JIMMY
Dz-n-Doctor Pal?
DOCTOR PAL
[springs up from behind the sofa and quite eager to start. He talks quickly] Hey Jimmy, I'm Doctor Pal. That's because I'm a doctor, but I'm also your pal. Are we cool?
JIMMY
Uh, sure?
DOCTOR PAL
A lot of times parents call me in because I can relate to younger kids. I'm, I'm down, I'm dope, you dig? Now, I understand you have some concerns about erections. [affects a joking manner] "Oops, can't say erection in front of the parents right. Oh God, I feel so weird" huh?
JIMMY
Well, a little, yes.
DOCTOR PAL
Jimmy, there's nothing weird about random erections. Almost every boy goes through a phase where his penis becomes hard... for no particular reason. It's just part of growing up. Growing up? Growing out is more like it. [laughs at his own cleverness]
JIMMY
But I have to make it stop! The talent show is this F-Friday.
DOCTOR PAL
Tell you what, Mom and Dad, why don't you skedaddle for a tick and let us hipsters talk in privo.
RYAN
A-all right, come on, honey. [they rise and leave the living room]
DOCTOR PAL
Jimmy, as you get older your body goes through a lot of changes. Certain hormones start to release as your whole reproductive system begins to awaken, and so, if you like, we can take off our shirts and kiss.
JIMMY
Ke...c-come again?
DOCTOR PAL
Oh, hey, nothin', you see? See, that set you off on a different tangent, got you thinkin' a different way. That's what Doctor Pal is here to do. [leans forward a little] Unless, of course, you think we should take off our shirts and kiss.
JIMMY
N-no, I do NOT want to take off my shirt and kiss!
DOCTOR PAL
Well then to hell with you, kid. You can just deal with your problems on your own. [walks out the door and closes it behind him]
[Jimmy's house, night. He's fast asleep, and we see his dream.]
ANNOUNCER
Next up for the talent show, put your hands together for the incredibly talented Jimmy Valmer! [he approaches the mic. On one side is a stool with a glass of water on it. The school audience is cheering]
JIMMY
Wow, what a what a great audience. So apparently Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you have you heard about this, have you seen this? She's very excited to get started on her new show, "Martha Stewart Living, with an electronic ankle bracelet." [the audience laughs heartily] So it looks like the Vatican has finally chosen a new Pope. Have you seen this, have you heard about this? [his penis is around and his erection begins to show] A-a-apparently they're going to call him New Pope, a-and refer to John Paul as P-Pope Classic. [the claps are few, his erection is bigger] Uh,.. so it so it looks like Michael Jackson is having back problem in court. [the kids begin to notice the erection and whisper to each other. Jimmy's beginning to falter] You know... huh... you uh you know what they say about b-b-b-b-back problems. [a girl screams and runs out of the gym. The other kids follow. Jimmy's penis has gotten so big it blocks his view of the audience. He moves it to his left so he can see everyone on his right] Uh, uh gee, what a terrific audience. [swings it to his right to see everyone on his left] What a fantastic audience.
MRS. GARRISON
Don't worry, Jimmy. We're not laughing with you, we're laughing AT you. [several shots of the audience laughing at Jimmy. Jimmy wakes up and sits up on his bed.]
JIMMY
Nuh uh! Wuh. Huh. Waaagh! Ungh! [punches his genitals with both his fists, then collapses from the resulting pain]
[Butters' house, day. He's practicing his favorite song in the garage with some help from his boom box. Jimmy approaches.]
BUTTERS
Lu Lu Lu, I've got some apples, Lu Lu Lu, you've got some too. Lu Lu Lu, let's get together, I know what we can do, Lu Lu.
JIMMY
Butters!
BUTTERS
Oh! Oh hey, Jimmy. [turns off the tape player] I'm just practicin' for the talent show.
JIMMY
Butters, ah I really need to talk to somebody, and I think maybe you're the only person who won't make f-f-fun of me.
BUTTERS
Oh gosh, I'd never make fun of somebody with a problem.
JIMMY
Butters, do you know what you're supposed to do when your penis gets hard?
BUTTERS
[thinks a moment] Well sure I do.
JIMMY
Really??
BUTTERS
Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should have a little talk. [they sit next to the boom box] You see, Jimmy, when a man's penis becomes hard, the man puts it into a lady. Into her "vagiiina." [fans his fingers out] Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside the lady's tummy, and after it's all done sneezin' milk, the penis stops bein' hard, and the man loses interest in the lady.
JIMMY
So, when your penis becomes hard, you're supposed to put it in a lady's vagina. And then it stops being hard?
BUTTERS
That's right, Jimmy.
JIMMY
But where am I going to find a lady to stick my penis in? The talent show is this Friday.
[South Park Elementary, day. The kids visit their lockers to change books.]
JESSIE
Talk to you, Bertha.
BERTHA
Okay, see you later, Jessie.
JIMMY
Hey Bertha.
BERTHA
Oh, hey Jimmy. What's goin' on?
JIMMY
Well Bertha, I was wondering if I could stick my penis in your vagina?
BERTHA
What?? No way! [Cartman walks into view, overhears, then stops to listen]
JIMMY
But the talent show is tomorrow! [Bertha slaps him] Ooo!
BERTHA
Jerk! [walks away, Cartman comes forward]
CARTMAN
Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man?
JIMMY
I'm trying to get laid. What's it look like?
CARTMAN
Dude, you don't just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some Italian food.
JIMMY
Wow, seems like you know a lot about this stuff, Eric. Have you gotten laid before?
CARTMAN
Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, like, five thousand times.
JIMMY
Well, wha-what do I do?
CARTMAN
I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her think you're a good listener.
JIMMY
Eric, I can't tell you why, but it's very important that I score to-night! Can you come on the date and help me? You're like a white... Hitch.
CARTMAN
Why sure, they do this all the time in movies and TV shows. You go on the date and wear an earpiece, and I'll be nearby, secretly telling you all the right things to say.
JIMMY
Wow! Thanks, Eric.
[A house, night. A woman is reading a book on her sofa. The doorbell rings.]
MOM
Shauna honey, I think your little date is here.
SHAUNA
[heads for the door] Okay, Mom. [opens it, and finds Jimmy waiting outside]
JIMMY
Hey Shauna.
SHAUNA
Hi Jimmy.
CARTMAN
[hiding in some bushes nearby] Okay Jimmy. First off, tell her how good she looks.
JIMMY
Wow, Shauna, you look f-fantastic.
SHAUNA
Thanks, Jimmy. Where are we going?
JIMMY
We're going to an authentic Italian restaurant, Buca de Fagghecini
[Buca de Fagghecini, dinnertime. Jimmy and Shauna wait for service at their table.]
WAITER
Welcome to Buca de Fagghecini for the authentico experience Italiano. My name is Roma. Can I start you out with some lotsa pasta macaroni minis?
JIMMY
Uh, I think we're gonna try your authentic pizzareli casserona poppers.
WAITER
Right away. [walks away]
SHAUNA
You know that girl Sally Rauman at our school? I can't stand her.
CARTMAN
[at a nearby booth] Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she's saying now isn't interesting at all, you say, "Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more."
JIMMY
Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.
SHAUNA
Really? Well, Kelligan bought the same purse and I was like, "No WAY do I want it now!" because who wants a purse that both their best friends have, right? And so-
CARTMAN
[Roma sets some plates of food on his table] All right, when she stops yappin' again, say "Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right."
SHAUNA
I guess that's why I figured, "Who needs friends like THAT?"
JIMMY
Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right.
SHAUNA
It's like I told Debbie: "If you're gonna go out with my friends-"
CARTMAN
All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with "Wow, how insightful."
SHAUNA
"And so if you're gonna be that way, I don't need to be your friend."
JIMMY
"If you're gonna be that way, I don't need to be your friend." Wow, how insightful.
SHAUNA
You know, Jimmy, you are a great listener.
JIMMY
Really?
SHAUNA
Yeah. I mean, no other boys really communicate like you do.
JIMMY
Oh, I'm so glad you think so, Shauna, because I really wanna stick my penis in your vagina.
CARTMAN
Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice.
SHAUNA
[stunned] ...What??? [crosses her arms and glares] I'm not doing that!
JIMMY
But the talent show is tomorrow night!
SHAUNA
Creep! [throws her glass of water at him and walks out. The water shorts out his headphones and Cartman takes his off from the feedback]
CARTMAN
Aaagh!
[South Park Elementary, next evening. The gym is set up for the talent show and the whole school is there. Well, most of the school...]
MRS. GARRISON
Welcome students and parents to the annual South Park Elementary Talent Show! [some applause] We have a lot of little talented performers to get through, so the quicker you shut up, the quicker this will be over! [everyone quiets down] Okay, first up we have Billy Turner, from the third grade, who will be doing an alto sax solo. [out comes Billy with his alto sax and he begins to play Frиre Jacques. His notes are tentative and wobbly]
[South Park Elementary, out on the front curb. Jimmy sits there sobbing. Officer Barbrady's police car rolls gently towards him and stops. The driver's door opens and Officer Barbrady comes into view.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Jimmy? Jimmy Valmer?
JIMMY
[looks up] Oh... Hi, Officer B b-b-buh b-b-buh b-Barbrady.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Jimmy, what are you doing here? The talent show is inside.
JIMMY
I'm... not gonna perform in the talent show. [sobs again]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Not perform? [sits down next to him] But Jimmy, you love talent shows. Everyone in town knows that.
JIMMY
I just c-can't risk getting up in front of everyone.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Why?
JIMMY
All right! I I keep getting an erection for no reason! Okay! But I can't get any of the girls here to let me... do it to them.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well of course not, Jimmy. Little girls don't wanna have sex.
JIMMY
Then why does God make it so that my penis gets hard if girls don't wanna have it in their vaginas? It's like a cruel joke.
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, Jimmy, the girls here are young and pure. They're not like the ladies down at Colfax Point.
JIMMY
...Colfax Point?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well yeah, those women will have sex with anybody.
JIMMY
Really? M-maybe I can catch the bus ...and get down there before the talent show ends. Th-thanks, Officer Barbrady! [heads off to the nearest bus station]
OFFICER BARBRADY
You're welcome, Jim. [happy at first, he begins to think over that last conversation] Wait...
[Colfax Point, in the red-light district of town, night. Cars roll by as obese prostitutes try to get customers. Shapely prostitutes try as well when the obese ones are denied. A black woman wearing knee-high boots walks down the street towards the camera. She has brilliant red hair, black vest and boots, and cheetah-print shorts]
VOICE-OVER
Colfax Point. Pimps and hos and tricks in rows. Women walk the street with corns on their feets. Broken dreams and no ice creams.
[A car stops in front of a woman built like a brick mansion]
HO
You lookin' for a date?
JIMMY
[entering this hellhole] Hello? Hello? I need to put my ...p-penis in a woman's vagina. Any takers? [before him, a ho dressed as a Red Cross nurse is left behind by a customer] Excuse me, ma'am. What's your name?
PROSTITUTE
They call me Nut Gobbler.
JIMMY
Well, Nut Gobbler, I need to get laid.
NUT GOBBLER
Huh??
JIMMY
I have a raging hard-on that just won't quit, and the talent show has already started.
NUT GOBBLER
You a cop?
JIMMY
No. Actually, I'm a stand-up comic.
NUT GOBBLER
You got money?
JIMMY
Sure do.
NUT GOBBLER
All right, you got a place to go?
JIMMY
Sure. I know the p-perfect place.
[Buca de Fagghecini, moments later. The waiter arrives.]
ROMA
Welcome to Buca de Fagghecini for the authentic experienso Italiano. My name is Roma, and uhhh [recognizes Jimmy] Oh, it's nice to see you again, Mr. Valmer.
JIMMY
[grabs Roma by the collar and talks to him in hushes tones] Hey, can it, jackass! I don't want her to know I was just here with a different girl.
ROMA
Oh right, pardone, segnore. I'll come back with some garlic bread mediterraneane. [walks off]
NUT GOBBLER
What are we doin' anyway?
JIMMY
This is authentic Italian food straight from S-Sicily. You should try the Lotsa Mozzarella Pizza Roll.
NUT GOBBLER
I can't eat too much, I've got an infected urinary tract. I've been pissin' blood for a week.
JIMMY
Oh, uh, wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.
NUT GOBBLER
Huh? [takes out a lighter and cigarette and lights the cigarette] Well, that's it, I just piss blood! So I have to stick a tampon up my peehole.
JIMMY
Wow. You know, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right. If you're pissing blood, you can shove a tampon up your peehole. You are very insightful. Please tell me more.
NUT GOBBLER
Look, kid, what are you doin'?! You wanna get laid or not?
JIMMY
Well of course I wanna get laid. That's why I'm taking you to this ...fancy place and pretending to be interested in what you have to say.
NUT GOBBLER
Kid, I'm a hooker. You don't have to take me to dinner OR be nice to me.
JIMMY
What? Fo-for real?
NUT GOBBLER
You paid me, so you get to do me. It's that simple.
JIMMY
Well jumpin' Jesus, what are we wasting our time here for then? The talent show is happening right now! Let's get to r-r-rammin'! [A black man angrily approaches the table]
PIMP
What are you doin', ho?! Havin' dinner?! You're supposed to be workin' for me!
NUT GOBBLER
It's where the trick wanted to go, you bastard!
PIMP
Trick?! I ain't stupid! Ain't no trick gonna take you out to dinner! [Roma arrives with some food, but quickly leaves when he sees what's happening] This PIMP is tryin' to steal you away from me! [to Jimmy] This is MY ho!
JIMMY
I beg to differ with you, sir. I paid for her and took her out to dinner. She's my ho!
NUT GOBBLER
Uh Jesus.
PIMP
You got a problem, bitch?!
JIMMY
Yes, I do have a problem, as a matter of fact! I've spent all my money on this ho, and she's now my only shot at getting laid, and the talent show is only a couple of hours from being over.
PIMP
[to Nut Gobbler] You're comin' home right now! [grabs her by the hair hard]
NUT GOBBLER
Agh! Let go of my hair, you son of a bitch!
JIMMY
Sir, sir, that is my ho!
PIMP
I'm gonna kick your ass, ho! [hauls her off]
JIMMY
[watching the pimp pull Nut Gobbler away] Sir, sir!
[South Park Elementary Talent Show, now in progress. A student sings Journey's "Open Arms" badly.]
BLONDE HAIRED GIRL
Lying beside you, here in the dark. Feeling your heartbeat with mine...
STAN
[bored, exchanges looks with Kyle] Woof.
[Buca de Fagghecini, outside. The pimp drives off with Nut Gobbler, and Jimmy just steps out the front doors]
JIMMY
Son of a ...b-bitch! [a taxicab rolls by, and Jimmy hails it] Taxi! [the cab stops, and Jimmy gets in] Follow that pimp and ho! [the driver does as told and peels away]
[The pimp's car.]
NUT GOBBLER
Where are you taking me?!
PIMP
I'm gonna kill you, ho!
NUT GOBBLER
No! Please! Q Money! I'm sorry!
Q MONEY
You're already dead, ho! [outside the driver's window, the cab has pulled up alongside. Jimmy rolls down his window]
JIMMY
Sir! I paid for that lady, and by taking her, you are no better than a common th-thief!
Q MONEY
Fuck you, punk! [turns his steering wheel left so his car rams the cab. The cab spins away, but recovers and comes up along the passenger side this time.]
JIMMY
Nut Gobbler, grab onto my crutch! [sticks it out for her to grab. She fails at grabbing it a few times, but finally succeeds. She begins to climb out of Q Money's car and has one leg out of the car]
Q MONEY
[grabs onto Nut Gobbler's other leg] Get your ass back in here, ho!
NUT GOBBLER
Aaaah! [she's basically doing the splits between the cars]
JIMMY
I got you, Nut Gobbler! [the two cars race down the streets with Nut Gobbler spread out between them like a Thanksgiving turkey]
[South Park Elementary Talent Show, now in progress. The Goth kids are now onstage. The Red Goth and Henrietta are on guitars, and the Kindergoth is on drums. The Tall Goth sings.]
TALL GOTH
No no nono no, I'm not gonna be in the talent show. Oh no nono no. I'll never be in your faggy talent show. [the song ends and they walk offstage. Some applause for them comes up from the audience]
MRS. GARRISON
Okay, that was the Goth kids with "Talent Shows Are For Fags"
TALL GOTH
That was killer. We showed them.
RED GOTH
Yeah, I hope we win.
[The streets of South Park, night. The two cars are still racing down the streets with Nut Gobbler splits between them. She's screaming from the pain]
JIMMY
Come on, ho! [the cars bump each other and pull apart, each male, Jimmy and Q Money, wanting Nut Gobbler with him. A motorcycle driver is coming towards them]
CABBIE
Look out!
MOTORCYCLIST
Daww?
NUT GOBBLER
Aah?? [the motorcyclist smacks into Nut Gobbler's groin and gets stuck there as his motorcycle continues without him and falls away] NO! [the motorcyclist is screaming, but his screams are muffled. Q Money takes out his gun and takes a few shots at Jimmy. One shot gets him in the right shoulder and he has to let go of Nut Gobbler. Both she and the motorcyclist fall into Q Money's car] '
JIMMY
Eugh! Stay on him! I'm not giving up! [the chase continues]
[South Park Elementary Talent Show, now in progress. A magic act ends as the assistant steps out of a box.]
CLARK
Tada! [some applause comes up from the audience.]
MRS. GARRISON
Okay, very nice, Clark and Laura. Very nice. [they carry off the box Laura was in] Our next act is Butters, who will be singing a song
STEPHEN
[takes a picture] There's our boy. [Linda claps with the audience. The piano begins]
BUTTERS
Lu lu lu, I've got some... [pauses as he forgets the words] Some... uh, some uh... some, uh... Uuuhhh... Oh no! [a puddle of urine forms under him] No no noho noo! [runs off the stage]
MRS. GARRISON
Okay, thank you Butters, very nice, short and sweet. [whips out a towel and wipes the stage clean of urine]
[The streets of South Park, night. The two cars are now bumping each other off.]
Q MONEY
Goddamn, this pimp just won't give up!
JIMMY
[to the cabbie] Get close to him! [the cabbie does so, and Jimmy jumps onto the roof of Q Money's car. Q Money does what he can to shake Jimmy off, but Jimmy stays on. When Q Money draws close to the cab, Jimmy looks at the cabbie] How much do I owe you?
CABBIE
[checks the meter] Six dollars and twenty-four cents.
JIMMY
[reaches into his pockets and pulls out a ten dollar bill] C-can I just get two back, please?
CABBIE
Oh, thank you very much. [smiles and gives Jimmy the two dollars] There you go. Have a good 'n.
JIMMY
Thank you. [the cabbie leaves the scene, his job complete. Q Money continues flying down the street and into Colfax Point. The other prostitutes watch in shock. Q Money slams the car into a light pole and Jimmy is catapulted through the air and lands in a trash heap. Q Money takes Nut Gobbler out of the car and pulls her away by the hair again]
Q MONEY
You're gonna pay for this, bitch!
NUT GOBBLER
No! Heelllp!! [The motorcyclist looks up dazed from the back seat of the crashed car. Jimmy makes his way out of the trash heap. Q Money drags Nut Gobbler up the stairs of a nearby building] Haaaaaaaaaa!!
JIMMY
[in hot pursuit now] Don't worry, Nut Gobbler! I'm coming! [his penis gets hard again and he freezes] Oh Jesus, not now. [he gathers his legs tight so the erection doesn't show as much] Oh boy, this is embarrassing. [he walks off gingerly]
[South Park Elementary Talent Show, still in progress.]
MRS. GARRISON
And now we have Eric Cartman, who will be doing select readings from the movie, Scarface. [leaves as the curtains open]
CARTMAN
[starts off with his back to the audience, then turns around] D'you know what you are? You're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches! You need people like me! You need people like me so you can point your fucking finger and say "That's the bad guy!" Well say goodnight to the bad guy!!
LIANE
That's my little boy. [smiles. Gerald and Sheila are stunned]
[Colfax Point, night. On the rooftop of the building, Q Money has Nut Gobbler on her knees and is ready to shoot her dead.]
NUT GOBBLER
Please, Q Money! Don't do this!
Q MONEY
I told you never to turn on me, ho!
JIMMY
[catches up with the pair] Hey, j-j-jackass! [he and Q Money face each other] I'm sorry I resorted to calling you jackass just now, but I'm very upset!
Q MONEY
And what are you gonna do, huh?! I've got four feet on you AND a gun! What do you have?!
JIMMY
What do I have? The weapon of comedy. So apparently the Chinese and the Japanese aren't getting along lately. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this?
Q MONEY
What?!
JIMMY
I'll tell you one thing: their food hasn't been getting along with my stomach for years.
Q MONEY
[laughs] That's pretty good.
JIMMY
Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this?
Q MONEY
[laughs] Oh yeah. That's right, she is. [behind him, Nut Gobbler grabs a pipe and approaches him silently]
JIMMY
She's apparently gotten real good with baking cakes with keys in them. [Q Money laughs heartily as Nut Gobbler reaches him. She knocks him out with one blow to the back of the head.]
NUT GOBBLER
Serves you right, you son of a bitch!
JIMMY
Nice teamwork, Nut Gobbler.
NUT GOBBLER
I can't believe you chased me all this way. You, you really care about me.
JIMMY
Not really. You're just a hooker, and I need to get laid. The talent show could be over any minute.
NUT GOBBLER
That's good enough for me. [takes off her coat and poses enticingly] Take me to bed. [Jimmy approaches her, reaches out, and she falls back and lands with a thud on his arms and crutches. He then hoists her up and carries her down the stairs to the bottom floor of the building. He carries her out the door, through the group of hookers gathered to marvel at the sight, and towards a Ho-Tel. One admiring prostitute wipes away a tear. Jimmy carries Nut Gobbler through the door and onto a bed nearby. The door closes and the light goes out. All the other hookers keep applauding]
[South Park Elementary Talent Show, still in progress. Ike is onstage singing "Yankee Doodle Boy".]
IKE
I have a Yankee Doodle sweetheart,
She's my Yankee Doodle girl.
[holds up some sparklers]
'Ankee Doodle came to London,
Just to ride the ponies,
[throws them off and gets inside a small cannon next to him. The barrel rises until it's in launch position]
I am da Yankee Doodle
I am da Yankee Doodle
I am da Yankee Doodle boy.
[The cannon shoots him out and he lands clear across the stage. Some applause greets the performance. As the props are taken away, Ike takes off his hat and bows low to everyone, then puts on his top hat and walks off]
MRS. GARRISON
Okay, very nice, Ike, thank you. All right, children, it looks like we have no more contestants, which means, the Talent Show is over! [the children cheer and Principal Victoria nudges a sleeping Mr. Mackey]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Mr. Mackey, it's over.
MR. MACKEY
Huh? [takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes] Oh oh oh, right.
MRS. GARRISON
Now we will tally up the judges' scores and find out which act they hated the least.
JIMMY
Hold everything! [Mrs. Garrison looks up. Jimmy has entered the gym and walks towards the stage. The audience watches him head up the steps] Mrs. Garrison, if you don't mind, I'll be taking that microphone..
MRS. GARRISON
Okay, let's put our hands together for Jimmy Valmer. [some applause heads his way]
JIMMY
Wow, what a terrific audience. So apparently it's been exactly two years since the fall of Baghdad. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Just as B-Bush predicted, Baghdad fell, Iraq fell, Saddam fell. The only thing that didn't fall was ...the price of gas. [everyone laughs] I just read in the paper that China's protesting Japan. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Yeah, I guess in China you don't get to- [his penis gets hard again and he's surprised] You've gotta be kidding me.
End of Erection Day


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:A Global Warming State is Emergency is declared in South Park as the world's largest beaver dam breaks and floods the adjacent town of Beaverton.

script:Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow

[Jefferson Lake Recreational Area, daytime. Stan and Cartman are in a very nice boat, playing around. Cartman stands up and shoots at imaginary opponents.]
STAN
Dude, you are right, Cartman. Your uncle Roy has a sweet boat.
CARTMAN
Yeah. Isn't this fun? Just you and me hangin' out, Stan. No stupid Kyle around.
STAN
Man, I wish I could really drive this thing.
CARTMAN
You know how?
STAN
Sure I do!
CARTMAN
Well here. [reaches down to grab something] Roy keeps the keys in the glove box.
STAN
Dude, I don't think your uncle'd want us driving it.
CARTMAN
Nobody's gonna know. We just drive it around the marina real quick. Look, if anything happens, I'll take full responsibility.
STAN
[reaches over and grabs the keys.] Okay, turn on the ignition,
CARTMAN
[puts on sunglasses as the engine purrs to life] Awesome.
STAN
Okay... [pulls on a handle]
CARTMAN
We're not moving.
STAN
[pulls harder. The motor creates a froth of water behind the boat, which is still in place]
CARTMAN
Maybe you have the parking brake on.
STAN
Boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass! They only have the... oh wait wait. Neutral button! [presses that and the boat lunges out of its landing, spinning around a few times as it jumps another dock nearby. The boat goes forward in a haphazard manner. Both boys scream]
CARTMAN
Other way! Other way!
STAN
[pushes the handle forward again, but it breaks in his hand. He can no longer control the boat, so he and Cartman scream again, then] Jesus Christ!!!
CARTMAN
Stan... beaver dam! [the boat approaches the dam quuickly] Very large beaver dam, Stan!! [the boat runs aground on the dam and the boys quickly jump out. The boat begins to smoke as the boys swim to the nearest shore. Stan, being lighter and faster, reaches shore first, then turns to wait for Cartman. The boat blows up and Stan shields his eyes. Cartman reaches the shore and walks up to Stan]
STAN
Oh dude! Oh Jesus!
CARTMAN
[turns around and sees] Dude! Stan! You are in serious trouble!
STAN
You said you'd take responsibility to your uncle Roy!
CARTMAN
I don't even have an uncle Roy! That was just some guy's boat I knew about.
STAN
What?
CARTMAN
Look, it's okay. We weren't here. This didn't happen, okay. We were both at my house all afternoon long playing Tea Party. Okay? Now come on, we gotta bail! [hustles up the beach]
STAN
Oh God, I hope I didn't hurt any beavers.
CARTMAN
[turns to look at Stan] Dude, come on! We've gotta get out of here! [Cartman turns back and continues up the beach. Stan turns and follows Cartman up]
[Splashy graphics appear as a program begins.]
ANNOUNCER
With an eye on America and all of today's events, it's South Park Evening News, with Tom Pusslicker
TOM
Herro, crisis and fear tonight, as what appears to be a massive flood has overtaken the town of Beaverton, Colorado, home of the world's largest beaver dam. [the Marshes are shown eating off small folding tables with dinners on them and looking at the TV] Earlier today, a break in the beaver dam which protected the town broke open, trapping people in their houses and destroying their lives. [a helicopter camera catches the flooding]
SHARON
Oh my gosh, those poor people.
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, I'm currently ten miles outside of Beaverton, unable to get inside the town proper. We do not have any reports of fatalities yet, but we believe that the death toll may be in the hundreds of millions. Beaverton has only a population of about eight thousand, Tom, so this would be quite devastating.
TOM
Any word on how the survivors in the town are doing, Mitch? [Stan has stopped eating. Sharon and Shelly continue.]
MITCH
W-we're not sure what exactly is going on inside the town of Beaverton, uh Tom, but we're reporting that there's looting, raping, and yes, even acts of cannibalism.
TOM
My God, you've, you've actually seen people looting, raping and eating each other?
MITCH
No, no, we haven't actually seen it Tom, we're just reporting it.
[The Marsh living room]
SHARON
[rises and begins to pick up the spent trays] You all done with your fishsticks, Stan?
RANDY
[rises and takes his own tray up] I'll help you, Sharon. [looks at the screen] Boy, that's just awful.
TOM
In the nearby town of South Park, the cause of the Beaverton flood is being investigated.
MAN 1
That's right! We know whose fault this is!
STAN
Huh oh. [puts his hands to his cheeks. Shelly gives him a funny look]
MAN 1
It's George Bush's fault!
MAN 2
Yeah! George Bush doesn't care about beavers!
CHET
George Bush didn't break that beaver dam! It was terrorists and Al Qaeda!
MAN 3
They've been secretly building beaver dam WMDs for years now! [a few other voices rise up to mention WMDs]
[The Marsh kitchen, later on. Randy is washing dishes, Sharon is drying them off. Stan appears at the kitchen entrance.]
STAN
Mom, Dad? [hesitating] The, they're gonna go help those people, right?
SHARON
I don't know. You know, to me, it seems like the mayor of Beaverton should've done something about that dam years ago.
RANDY
Don't blame the mayor, Sharon. What about FEMA? Think this whole thing is really their fault.
STAN
Ye-but, uh, s-somebody's gonna help the people off their, their rooftops, right?
RANDY
That's not important right now, son. What's important is figuring out whose fault this is. [nothing more is exchanged between Stan and his parents]
[South Park Elementary School, next day. The kids gather to enter the school.]
[The school hall. Cartman is putting a blue folder away in his locker. Stan approaches.]
STAN
Dude! Dude, did you see the news last night?
CARTMAN
Yeah.
STAN
You saw all those people trapped on their roofs?
CARTMAN
Shyeah, that was pretty funny.
STAN
Pretty funny?! Dude, we did that!! That was our fault!
CARTMAN
Hehey, no! We aren't the ones who built a town beneath a giant beaver dam, okay?! That's their fault!
STAN
But they're trapped now and nobody's helping them!
CARTMAN
Well they should've gotten out of there!
STAN
Maybe they couldn't get out!
CARTMAN
We did!
STAN
Dude, ah I just... [walks around in a fog of worry] ah I don't know what to do here.
CARTMAN
Ah ah ah, ah, I know what you're thinking, Stan. You're thinking, you're gonna go tell Kyle. Look, I know you think he's your best friend, but Kyle is a Jew rat! He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and he will Jew you out if you tell him about this!
KYLE
[walks up behind Stan] Hey dudes. [Stan stands to one side so he can see Kyle clearly]
CARTMAN
Oh hey, Kyle.
KYLE
Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do?
STAN
[looks at Cartman, then] Nothing.
CARTMAN
[smiling proudly] Hngh, totally.
BUTTERS
[appearing] Hey, everybody, they just found out what caused the flood in Beaverton! [the other kids present in the hall follow Butters away. Kyle goes as well.]
CARTMAN
[throws down his cap] Aw crap!
[The school cafeteria. Mr. Mackey stands next to a TV, and Principal Victoria goes up to join him. The kids are chatty.]
MR. MACKEY
Quiet, children, quiet! We need to hear.
TOM
At first, nobody knew what caused the dam to break, but now, shocking new evidence has indicated that the flood in Beaverton was caused by... global warming! [everyone gasps. A new graphic appears onscreen - a globe] It now appears that... all rumors of global warming were true. We were warned this would happen and ...we didn't listen! [buries his face in his hands in anguish] We didn't listen! [composes himself] All the top Colorado geologists have gathered at the governor's office for an emergency meeting.
[The Governor's office, day. Randy addresses his peers in a meeting room.]
RANDY
Ladies and Gentlemen, if Global Warming has in fact already caused the Beaverton flood, then this is only the beginning. The effects are going to spread. What we are looking at is a global warming catastrophe the likes of which we've never seen. [excited voices fill the room]
GEOLOGIST 1
Excuse me, sir, but, ...when? When is this going to happen?
RANDY
My colleagues in the scientific community are still running tests, but... we believe it may happen... the day after tomorrow. [excited voices fill the room again: "Peas and carrots! Peas and carrots! Peas and carrots!"]
GEOLOGIST 2
[an elderly gent] Excuse me, I'm sure we're all very impressed with your wild theories, Doctor uh, Marsh, but the fact is no statistical proof has ever been confirmed that global warming exists. Are you suggesting we shut down the economy?!
RANDY
With all due respect, cliché dissenting Republican, the economy isn't going to matter... the day after tomorrow. [excited voices fill the room again: "Peas and carrots! Peas and carrots! Peas and carrots!" The double doors open]
SCIENTIST 1
Listen! Listen! We've finished running the tests!
SCIENTIST 2
Global Warming is going to strike... two days before the day after tomorrow.
RANDY
[alarmed] Oh my God... That's today! [a few seconds of silence, then all the geologists begin to panic. Papers fly around the room as most of the geologists run outside.]
[Grocery Mart. The shoppers there begin to panic. News does spread fast.]
[The town. Everyone panics. Some shoppers run through town with shopping carts of food.]
[The school. Everyone clear out.]
MAN 5
[runs by in front of the school] We didn't listen!
RANDY
[pulls up in the family car, with everybody else already inside] Stan! Get in the car! We have to evacuate!
MAN 6
[runs by in front of the camera] We didn't listen! [Wendy and her father run by, Anne and her mother run by.]
[A highway, bumper to bumper traffic on the way out. A lot of drivers beep their horns hoping other drivers in front of them start moving.]
RANDY
[beeping his own horn] Come onnn, come on!
SHARON
It's useless. This traffic isn't moving!
STAN
Dad, isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming? I, I mean, the water was held back by a giant beaver dam, after all.
RANDY
No, Stan, I'm afraid us adults just let you children down. We didn't take care of our earth, and now you've inherited our problems.
DRIVER
We didn't listen!
RANDY
[hears this and rolls down his window] We, we didn't listen! [rolls up his window] Come on! Everyone grab what you can! We have to walk! [the Marshes get out the car, carrying what they can, and leave the highway. In town the looting continues. An elderly man carrying a TV comes into view...]
MAN 7
[drops the TV and points] Oh Jesus, here it comes!
MAN 8
Global warming! [everyone runs away from whatever the man was pointing to, and soon the street is empty.]
MAN 9
[in the middle of the crowd] It's coming! Here comes global warming!
MAN 10
We didn't listen! [a camera in the sky begins to act the part of Global Warming as it focuses on a man and zooms in on him. The man turns and freezes in his tracks. The POV changes to a camera on the sidewalk watching the man's reactions. The man turns over a few times and stops moving, but no other camera is seen]
RANDY
[moving along with his family] Come on, hurry! [the panicking crowd overtakes them]
MAN 11
It's right behind us! [the Marshes stop to let the crowd through, then start moving again. The crowd returns and passes them again in the opposite direction] It's coming the other way! [the Marshes stop, then run back the way they came]
RANDY
Go back, go back!!
[The Park County Community Center, day. Stephen Stotch stands at the entrance urging people inside.]
STEPHEN
Everyone into the community center! Hurry! Go!
RANDY
[arrives to lend a hand] Get inside! We have to close these doors! [everyone for miles around comes and fills up the center. Again, the Global Warming camera focuses on the entrance and floats its way towards it. The last two people around, Stephen and Randy, close the doors just before the camera gets there.]
[The Park County Community Center, inside. Randy has taken command of global warming preparations.]
RANDY
Come on, we've got to board up that last window! Seal off all the doorways! We must try to protect ourselves from the global warming.
SHEILA
Mr. Garrison, are you all right?
MRS. GARRISON
I'm in pretty bad shape. My... leg is broken and my... left boob is leaking
SHARON
[arrives with a blanket to wrap around Stan, who has a cot to sleep in, and is seated on it] Here you go, sweetheart.
STAN
Mom, you know, those people in Beaverton are still trapped in the flood.
SHARON
I know, but, I'm afraid it's too late for them, sweetie. We have to try and save ourselves now.
GERALD
Shh, shh! We've got the television working! [one of two TVs in front of the crowd comes to life]
ANNOUNCER
This is a FOX News update! Global Warming Disaster!
ANCHOR
Global warming appears to have struck as predicted in the Colorado Rockies! All around the country, panic and chaos are settling in!
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, I am standing just outside of Chicago, where the panic of global warming has already caused countless deaths. Already we're reporting that the death toll here in Chicago is over 600 billion people
OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh God.
STEPHEN
[turns around in anger] This is all your fault, Jimbo!
JIMBO
Me??
STEPHEN
Yeah! You drive that damn SUV around! You didn't even think about global warming, DIDJA?!
KYLE
[with a cup of water, approaches Stan] Can you believe it, Stan? I never thought global warming could happen so fast. I guess... I didn't listen.
STAN
Kyle, it... it isn't global warming.
KYLE
Huh?
STAN
[hops off his cot] Global warming isn't happening right now. It's, it's not what caused the Beaverton flood.
KYLE
How do you know that?
STAN
Because, I know what did cause the flood.
KYLE
George Bush?
STAN
No.
KYLE
Terrorists?
STAN
No.
KYLE
Communists?
STAN
No.
KYLE
Chinese radicals?
STAN
No.
KYLE
...Cartman?
STAN
...sort of.
KYLE
[throws down his cup] Cartman flooded Beaverton?!!
STAN
[pulls him aside to a more private area] Shh! Not, not exactly. We were messing around in this guy's new boat, and Cartman egged me on, and, and I crashed it into the Beaverton dam.
KYLE
[thinks a bit] Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now.
CARTMAN
[arrives] Hey Stan. [studies Stan and Kyle's faces] Oh Goddammit you told Kyle, didn't you?!
KYLE
Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside.
CARTMAN
Oh, here we go. See? I told you! If you're so caring, Kyle, why don't you share some of your Jew gold with the people caught in the flood?!
STAN
Look, maybe, maybe we can help those people in Beaverton ourselves.
KYLE
How?
CARTMAN
Why?
STAN
We can sneak out of here, get a boat, and go help them off their roofs. That way, I can do the right thing, but still lie about it.
RANDY
[addressing the crowd] Listen, listen everyone! Nobody can leave this building!
MRS. GARRISON
But... we need supplies, food, silicone.
RANDY
You go outside, and you'll die! By now, the global warming has... shifted the climate, [steps up to a laptop and presses a key. A rotating graph appears, with the graph line dipping low] bringing on a new ice age. Within the hour, the temperature outside will fall to over 70 million degrees below zero!
STEPHEN
Jesus.
RANDY
All we can do... is try to wait it out, as long as we can.
GERALD
And... the rest of the country?
RANDY
[sighs as he moves from the laptop to the blackboard and pulls out a marker] Everyone below this line [draws a line from the border of Colorado and New Mexico to West Virginia] will have to be evacuated to the south. Everyone above this line [draws a line from the border of Colorado and Montana to Lake Erie] is already dead. People like us in the middle states have to ride it out. [draws two lines connecting the two longer lines, around Indiana] The balmy southwestern states [draws an open circle around Arizona, most of New Mexico, California and Nevada] might have a chance but, New York [draws a short line around it] will have tidal waves that envelop all of the northeast. [the crowd looks at it for a long time, then a man puts his hand to his mouth and starts chuckling] What, Frank?! [Frank points at the inadvertent phallus Randy drew on the map. Randy looks and realizes what he did] Aw awww, Goddammit! [goes to scribble all over the map so the dong isn't so noticeable.]
[Beaverton, day. The flooded town is shown, and in the background, the shattered dam and empty lake.]
RESIDENT 1
Hello? Anybody? We'd like to be rescued, please. Any day now.
RESIDENT 2
Why haven't they come for us?
RESIDENT 1
I... I don't know.
RESIDENT 3
Wait, look! Here comes a boat!
RESIDENT 2
Really? Oh! It's about time!
WIFE
Oh Kevin, we're saved! [buries her face in his shoulder]
RESIDENT 3
It looks like... three little boys.
RESIDENT 1
Hey, we'll take it! [they all start waving their arms] Over here, yes! Thank you! Thank you! [the boys appear, going backwards and screaming. They head for Beaverton Oil, a refinery nearby, and crash into it. The boys fall out of the boat and into the water, then pop up right away. Oil begins to pour out of pipes the boat broke upon crashing, and fire follows the oil. The oil slick rushes past the flooded homes, with fire riding it, and a wall of flames rises up] Oh, thanks. Thanks. That's a LOT better.
[Beaverton Oil, inside. The boys turn to watch the boat burn.]
KYLE
We can't get out! The flames are too big!
CARTMAN
[turns around and heads towards Stan] Oh great! You see, Stan?! This is what you get for listening to Kyle! [Kyle turns and looks at him] "Oh, you've gotta help those people. It's your responsibility."
KYLE
[walks towards Stan] Stan, it's over. You have to admit what you did so our parents can help us! [Stan looks down, unsure what to do]
[The Park County Community Center, inside. Preparations are ongoing.]
RANDY
Stan?? Stan!!
GERALD
Randy! We've looked everywhere! Kyle's missing too!
SHARON
Oh my God! Where would they go?!
STEPHEN
[on the public phone] Randy, Randy! Your son's on the phone!
RANDY
[gets to the phone and takes the receiver from Stephen] Stan??
STAN
Uh, hey Dad.
RANDY
Stan, you're alive!
STAN
Dad, we're, we're trapped in Beaverton, We're, we were trying to save everyone!
RANDY
Stan, you must listen to me! You must stay indoors! Do not try to go out! Global warming has brought in a new ice age!
STAN
No, Dad, listen: I need to tell you something.
RANDY
What is it, son?
STAN
Nothing. Can you just come get us, please?
RANDY
You just stay put, son! I'm coming for you! Do you hear me?? I'm coming for you!! [hangs up the phone and struggles with his emotions, then grabs his coat and scarf and bundles up]
MR. MACKEY
Randy, wheh-where are you going?
RANDY
I'm going to Beaverton.
TOM
[Craig's father] You can't go out there! You'll freeze to death!
RANDY
My son is counting on me!
GERALD
I'm going with you.
RANDY
You can't go out there! You'll freeze to death!
GERALD
You can't do this alone!
STEPHEN
Let me go too.
MAN 12
You can't go out there. You'll freeze to death.
RANDY
All right, come on, both of you! We've gotta pull together every warm piece of clothing we can find.
[South Park, day. If there's an ice age now, it certainly doesn't show. Randy, Gerald and Stephen are much too warmly dressed. They walk through town chain-gang style. Randy leads the men forward and takes a deep breath. Stephen collapses at the back end of the chain. Gerald and Randy spin around.]
GERALD
Stephen! [Stephen mumbles but can't get up] Stephen, you have to keep moving!
STEPHEN
I can't go on! Feel so... hot.
RANDY
Feeling warmth is a symptom of the last stages of hypothermia!
GERALD
Oh Jesus... [looking woozy] I feel warm too!
RANDY
Yeah, me too. [walks around Gerald] Stephen, we've gotta keep moving! We're in deep hypothermia, all of us! We've gotta keep the blood flowing! [bends down to help Stephen up]
GERALD
Maybe we should... strip these jackets off, and warm our bodies next to each other!
RANDY
Don't be a fag! [turns around] Come on! We can make it! [the men move forward again] We have to try!
[The Pentagon, day.]
GENERAL
Come on, people, we're running out of time! We need all Army helicopters to the Southern states for evacuation NOW!
OFFICER
Sir! More people in Beaverton are calling. They say they're trapped in floods and fire now.
GENERAL
Tell them that the government can't help them, but that we're very sorry. You know the plan, people! We can only evacuate citizens below this line! [the very line Randy mentioned]
SCIENTIST
E-excuse me, General?
GENERAL
WHAT??
SCIENTIST
We've just compiled some new information. The er, the flood in Beaverton wasn't caused by global warming after all.
GENERAL
What??
SCIENTIST
We know the truth now. We know what caused it! [hands the general a photo. The general looks at it and his eyes grow big]
GENERAL
Oh my God. Quick! Radio the helicopters!
[Beaverton, day. The flooded town is shown, but now there is fire as well. Almost every building is in frames, as is the town sign.]
[Beaverton Gas. The boys wander around.]
CARTMAN
Help! Help! [a large drum falls from the ceiling in front of Kyle]
KYLE
Dude, this whole building is going to collapse!
STAN
We have to find a way out! [the boys start climbing the metal stairs]
[Beaverton, day. The army helicopters start showing up. The general leads the rescue effort.]
GENERAL
[through his bullhorn] Don't worry, everyone. The government is here to save you. [the helicopters hover above the homes and drop rope ladders down]
RESIDENT 1
Oh wow, thank you so much! What a swift and speedy rescue!
[Beaverton Gas. The boys climb up further.]
STAN
Come on! We've gotta get to the roof! [another drom falls near Kyle, shearing off the stairs they just climbed. Kyle falls on his ass and gets up]
KYLE
Oh Jesus, we have to hurry!
STAN
[stops before an opening in the wall, where he sees sky and...] It's- it's helicopters! They finally came to help everyone! [Kyle and Cartman are on a landing below. Kyle tries to catch up to Stan, but Cartman blocks his way]
CARTMAN
Not so fast, Kyle.
KYLE
What are you doing?
CARTMAN
Hand over the gold!
KYLE
What gold??
CARTMAN
You know what I'm talkng about!
KYLE
No, Cartman, I have no idea what you're talking about!
CARTMAN
All Jews carry gold in a little bag around their necks! Hand it over!
STAN
[drops down a few steps and calls] Guys, come on! [goes back up the stairs]
KYLE
Jews do NOT carry gold in a little bag around their necks.Cartman! Stop playing around!
CARTMAN
[pulls out a 9 mm handgun, hopefully fake.] I'm not playing around, Kyle! If we survive this, I don't intend to live in poverty! Give me your Jew gold now!
KYLE
Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die!
CARTMAN
Yes, but you can live if you give me your Jew gold! The decision is yours, Kyle!
KYLE
Goddamnit, you know I don't carry gold in a little bag around my neck, Cartman! Whattaya want from me?!
CARTMAN
I want... your Jew gold! [Kyle has run out of things to say and stands there. Cartman glowers at him, ready to fire the gun if he moves]
KYLE
...Okay, fine! Here! [opens his coat and pulls out a small black bag, and hands it to Cartman] Now let's go!
CARTMAN
[moves the bag around for heaviness] Do you think I'm stupid?! I know that all Jews carry fake bags of gold around their necks to keep the real bags of gold around their necks safe! Hand over the real Jew gold, Kyle!! [Kyle, angered at this delaying tactic, pulls out another small bag from under his coat and walks over to Cartman. Cartman laughs evilly as Kyle approaches. Kyle smiles an evil smile back and tosses the second bag over his shoulder and into the fire below. Cartman rushes over to grab it, but doesn't get there in time Kyle rushes up the stairs at the other end of the landing] No! Noooooo! [watches the fire]
[Beaverton Oil, roof. A helicopter hovers over a roof opening. Stan and Kyle climb out of the building and head towards the helicopter, and climb on. Cartman climbs out of the building as the helicopter takes off.]
CARTMAN
Hey! Wait up, you assholes! God! [runs up to the platform and jumps on. The helicopter flies off]
[The Park County Community Center, inside. Everyone sits and waits.]
MR. MACKEY
Hey, look everybody! Helicopters! [a few people move forward to catch a glimpse though a crack among the boards nailed against the entrance]
SHARON
They, they've got the boys!
TOM
Global warming must be over!
MAN 13
We made it! [the crowd cheers, "We made it! Yeah! Woohoo"]
[South Park, outside. Three helicopters touch down in the middle of South Park Av. and drop off the Beaverton residents as well as the boys. The mothers approach.]
SHARON
Stanley! [stands next to him and goes down on one knee.]
SHEILA
Kyle! [Randy, Gerald, and Stephen are still sprawled on the ground nearby.]
RANDY
[raises his head] Stan? [turns to the other two men] We've found Stan! Ugh. [faints again]
MR. MACKEY
So does, does this mean the storm is past. Global warming's over?
GENERAL
Global warming didn't cause the Beaverton flood. We know now whose fault it is. [The boys look up. Stan is a little worried.] It was... [pulls out the picture he was handed earlier, and it's a crab person] Crab people!
CROWD
Ohhhh.
THEME
Crab People, Crab People, Taste like-
STAN
[steps forward] Stop it! Stop it!! First it was terrorists, then George Bush and global warming and now you're all blaming crab people for something that's very simple! It's MY fault. I broke the dam. [the crowd falls silent for a few seconds]
CARTMAN
...Aw man.
SHARON
[steps forward] Stanley. You?
MAN 14
No. Don't you see what this child is saying? We can't spend all our energy placing blame when something bad happens. He's saying... we all broke the dam. '
STAN
No. I broke the dam.
WOMAN 1

End of Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Butters must fake his death, dress up as a girl and infiltrate a slumber party, in order to retrieve a future telling device Cartman is convinced the girls have.

script:Marjorine

[Cartman's basement, afternoon. The fourth grade boys are seated at a large conference table. Stan and Kyle come down the stairs and see the rest of the boys. At table are, counterclockwise, Clyde, Kevin, Tolkien, Craig, Bradley, Butters, a black-haired boy, Timmy, Francis, Tweek, and Kenny.]
KYLE
What are all you guys doing here?
CLYDE
I don't know. I got this emergency letter from Cartman that said to meet in his basement. [shows letter]
STAN
Yeah, us too.
CARTMAN
[closes the door and comes downstairs] Ah, gentlemen, thank you for coming. We don't have a lot of time, so I'll cut to the chase. The girls at our school have been hiding something from us, hiding something huge.
CRAIG
What?
CARTMAN
What if I were to tell you that the girls have a device, which allows them to see... into the future.
STAN
What?
BUTTERS
How do you know?
KYLE
The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded.
CLYDE
[in an English accent. Cartman looks on, startled] YOU, SIR, MOCKED CARTMAN BEFORE, YET YOU TWO SIT HERE DEMANDING ANSWERS! [bangs on the table twice with his fist] NOW DAMN YOU, LET HIM SPEAK!
CARTMAN
Thank you, Clyde. Uh, I'm afraid it's true. [pulls TV from the back] I secretly videotaped the girls in the playground yesterday using my Wellington Bear video camera [shows the camera]. I caught the following images on tape. I warn you, this images maybe be too shocking for young children.
BUTTERS
Okay. I'm not lookin'. [buries his face in his arms]
CARTMAN
Video playback initialized. [presses play on the remote control and the screen shows the girls playing]
[School yard, playing on the TV]
GIRLS
[laugh]
BEBE
Okay, okay. My turn, do me now!
ISLA
Okay Bebe. What do you want to know?
BEBE
I want to know if I'm gonna live in a big mansion in the future.
ISLA
Okay, let's find out. Ready? [pulls out a paper fortune teller] Pick a number.
BEBE
Four.
ISLA
One, two, three, four. Okay, pick a color.
BEBE
Blue.
ISLA
B-L-U-E. All right pick another color
BEBE
[off-screen] Red.
ISLA
'Kaaay. Okay, will Bebe live in a big mansion in the future? [opens an interior flap] Definitely yes!
BEBE
All right!
GIRLS
Woohoo! You rock, Bebe!
BOYS
Whoa! Wow!
RED
Do me next. I wanna know if I'm gonna marry somebody cute.
HEIDI
I'll do it! I'll do it! [takes the teller from the Isla] Pick a number.
RED
Three.
HEIDI
One, two, three. Now, pick a color.
CLYDE
Where did they get that thing? [Kyle shushes him]
HEIDI
G-R-E-E-N.
RED
Now blue!
HEIDI
The answer is no. [girls laugh at her]
RED
Aw dangit!
STAN
Oh my God, how does it know the answer?
CRAIG
I... don't believe it.
CARTMAN
Believe it. The girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer. Freeze image! [presses the pause button] Gentlemen, we have to get our hands on that device.
[Cartman's backyard. The boys set up a containment tent. Tolkien, Jason, and Kenny use pulleys to pull up the tent curtains. Craig and Bradley pull up a chalkboard with pictures of the girls. Someone rolls out the blueprints of the future telling device. The boy with the blue cap carries a box of equipment over to somewhere. The boys do other various tasks, Francis is at another computer.]
CARTMAN
[comes to Clyde and Kevin's table] How is the incubation shield coming Clyde?
CLYDE
It's all set. Once we have the device, it can be housed in here safely until we know what we're dealing with.
CARTMAN
Good man. [goes over to the computer Kyle, Stan, and Tolkien are working on] Any luck here?
KYLE
The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.
CARTMAN
Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it. [moves to the middle of the tent] All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete. All that's left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here.
CRAIG
Let's go take it!
CARTMAN
Don't be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over?
STAN
So what do you suggest?
CARTMAN
Heidi Turner [turns on a projector on which is shown her picture] is going to have a slumber party on Thursday night. There's no doubt in my mind the girls will be using the future-telling device there. If we... can get somebody invited to that slumber party, not only can we get a hold of the device, but find out how to use it.
STAN
Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party.
CARTMAN
No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town.
KEVIN
You mean like that movie, Juwanna Mann?
CARTMAN
No, not like Juwanna Mann, Kevin, okay? It's way cooler than that!
STAN
But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, the girls will wonder where that boy went.
CARTMAN
Which is why we have to fake that boy's death. It's simple spy stuff, my friends. Take your top man, fake his death, then send him in disguised as the enemy.
KYLE
That's a pretty solid idea. But who?
[The Stotch house, night. A police stops and two police officers arrive at the front door and knock the door]
OFFICER 1
Mr. and Mrs. Stotch?
STEPHEN
Yes? What is it, officer?
OFFICER 1
You'd better come quick.
OFFICER 2
Your son is at the Bowery Building threatening to kill himself.
LINDA
What?!
[The Bowery Building. Police and people are gathering on the grounds and two spotlights shine on Butters who's standing on the roof's edge, ready to fall]
OFFICER 2
Don't do it son! You have too much to live for! [a patrol car pulls up with Stephen and Linda]
LINDA
Oh my God, Butters!
BUTTERS
Oh uh, hi Mom.
CARTMAN
[behind Butters] Just keep stalling, Butters. We don't have the dead pig quite ready yet. [Clyde, Stan, and Craig dress the pig while Cartman makes a Butter mask for it]
STEPHEN
[grabs the bullhorn from the officer] Butters? Butters, whatever is troubling you, this isn't the answer. Look at all these people who've come out for you! Just come down, son, and... we promise we won't ground you for more than a couple of weeks.
BUTTERS
N'aw geez! Now I'm gonna get grounded, too.
CARTMAN
Okay, it's ready! Step down, Butters. [the pig is done, Butters steps down, and the pig is shoved into place]
LINDA
He, h-he's coming down! Oh thank God!
OFFICER 1
No, wait. What... what's he doing? [the Butters mask appears over the ledge]
CARTMAN
Okay. One! Two! [Craig, Clyde, and Stan push the dressed pig]
OFFICER 3
JESUS CHRIST! [Linda screams. The pig drops to the ground and explodes, splattering everyone around with blood and guts]
LINDA
OHHHH MY GOD!!
DOCTOR
[walks up to the body and rests his finger on a completely exposed blood vein]
He... didn't make it.
LINDA
NOOOOO!! NOOOOO!! My son is DEAD!! NOOOO!!
CARTMAN
Nice.
[South Park Cemetery]
PRIEST MAXI
And he shall be remembered as the peaceful little boy who warmed his parent's hearts. [Linda sobs uncontrollably] Lord, as we commit this child's body to the earth, may we ask it'd be the last child you strike down so mercilessly. We know this request to be futile, Lord, but just though we would ask. [the casket is lowered]''
LINDA
NOOOO! NOOOO! BUTTERS! [jumps on the casket and Stephen and another woman holds her] Don't put him down there! Don't put him down there!
[South Park elementary, Ms. Garrison enters]
MS. GARRISON
Okay children, let's take our seats. Now I know that we're all still in deep, deep mourning over the tragic death of our classmate, Butters.
RED
Who's Butters?
MS. GARRISON
But we all must try to move on. And so I'd like you to help me welcome a new student who was just moved here from Dallas. Children please say hello to... Marjorine. [Butters enters dressed as Marjorine, a blonde girl, with wig askew]
BUTTERS
Oh... Thank you. [curtsies]
CARTMAN
[whispers to Stan]Dude, I think it's totally working. The girls are totally buying it. [clears his throat]
MS. GARRISON
Why don't you tell the children a little bit about yourself, Marjorine?
BUTTERS
Well, I'm just a typical little girl. I like dancin' and ponies. a-and [squeezes his eyes shut] getting my snootch pounded on Friday night.
CLYDE
Nice.
MS. GARRISON
Now Marjorine, that's not very ladylike. Us Colorado girls love to get pounded in the snootch just like any woman, but we keep it to ourselves.
BUTTERS
Oh...
BEBE
That girl sure has a strange sense of fashion.
CARTMAN
[pretends like he's yawning] Dude, they totally think he's a girl. [coughs]
MS. GARRISON
All right, have a seat, Marjorine. I'm sure all the other girls will be happy to show you around the school. [the girls look cross] Won't you, girls?
RED
Where do you buy your clothes?
BUTTERS
Oh. Uhm, you know. Girl places.
CARTMAN
[pretends like he's yawning] Dude, they've bought it hook line and sinker. [coughs] This is going swimmingly. [coughs]
[Turner's house, basement. Heidi is stirring lemonade.]
MRS. TURNER
[enters the basement carrying a bowl] Heidi, sweetie, I'm just gonna set the snacks over here.
HEIDI
'Kay Mom.
MRS. TURNER
Oh, and Heidi, there's going to be one extra girl coming to your slumber party.
HEIDI
Who?
MRS. TURNER
The new girl in your class, Marjorine.
HEIDI
Mom, I didn't invite her!
MRS. TURNER
I know, sweetie, but I got a call from Marjorine's mother.
HEIDI
Her mother?
MRS. TURNER
She said Marjorine is having a really hard time being in a new school. Her mom asked me personally if we could have Marjorine over, and besides, her mother told me that she works as a state official and that I should [slows down a bit] respect her authoratay.
[Stotch house. Linda is crying in the bedroom.]
STEPHEN
Linda? Linda, please come downstairs.
LINDA
[through her tears] Why couldn't we help him? Why is our little boy dead? [continues crying. Stephen leaves her alone and walks downstairs]
STEPHEN
[sees Butters on a family portrait] Oh butter! Oh Butters, I miss you so much! [the doorbell rings and he opens the door]
AN OLD FARMER
Mr. Stotch. I know what you're thinkin'.
STEPHEN
Who are you?
AN OLD FARMER
[in a spooky accent] I came to talk you out of it. You need to... just accept that your son is dead, not try to bring him back.
STEPHEN
Bring him back? W-What are you talking about?
AN OLD FARMER
[comes in] I know you're thinkin' of puttin'; him up there, the Indian Burial Ground up that road. You're thinking if you bury his body there, he will come back alive. Sometimes, dead is better.
STEPHEN
Indian... Burial Ground?
AN OLD FARMER
It's been done before, what you're thinkin' of. The Nelson boy, back in '85.
STEPHEN
You're saying if I... dig up my son's body and rebury him at the... old Indian Burial Ground, that I-
AN OLD FARMER
Don't do it Stotch! What comes out of the ground ain't the thing you put in. The Indians knew that. That's why they stopped using it when the ground went sour. I'm just here to talk you out of it. [walks towards the front door, which is still open, then turns around] Don't bury your son's body at the Indian Burial Ground, Stotch! The one that's right up over there, behind Andersons' bar. Sometimes... dead is better. [walks out]
[Heidi's house. Across the street, the boys peek out from behind bushes]
STAN
All right, Butters, that's Heidi's house.
BUTTERS
[dressed as Marjorine] I can't do it, fellas. I can't go into a girls' slumber party! What if they find out I ain't a girl?
CLYDE
You're gonna be fine.
CARTMAN
Now Butters, we don't know exactly what is that girls do at their slumber parties. But if they start, you know, lezzing out, just roll with it.
BUTTERS
Lezzing out? What's lezzing out?
KYLE
Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there.
BUTTERS
Then I can go home and tell my mommy and daddy I'm not really dead?
STAN
Yeah dude, of course. Now go, the party's already started.
CLYDE
Good luck, man. [Kyle gives him a push, and Butters is off]
CARTMAN
Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out. [Kyle glares at him]
[Heidi's house, basement. Heidi's father enters the room with the build of a bodybuilder, and her mother.]
MR. TURNER
All right, now we all want you to have a good time. But as Heidi's parents, tonight it is our responsibility to look out for all of you. There's not gonna be any drinking, no pot, and most importantly, if I catch any boys anywhere near this party, they're gonna be in a world of hurt. [Butters mumbles and sighs a bit] All right, have a nice time, girls. [both parents leave]
HEIDI
So, what do you guys wanna do first?
BEBE
We could play "girl talk." [the other girls approve]
RED
I bought the new Justin Timberlake CD. We should dance to it. [the other girls approve again]
BUTTERS
How about we read each other's future?
WENDY
I know. Let's do "Light as a feather, stiff as a board." [the girls approve, then spread out. Isla and Emily light candles and place them on the rug. Bebe turns the lights off, and the girls gather, making a circle around the candles] Who wants to do it first?
RED
I will. [gets in the middle and lays down]
BUTTERS
Oh geez, are we gonna start lezzing out? [the girls look at Butters in astonishment for a moment, then they turn back to the center of the circle]
WENDY
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.
GIRLS
[getting louder as Red begins to float upwards] Light as a feather, stiff as a board! [Red is floating, making Butters scream]
[Outside, the boys are hearing Butters scream.]
KYLE
Jesus, what are they doing in there?
CARTMAN
God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it.
[Back to Heidi's house]
BUTTERS
AAAAAAAH NOO! Witches! You're all witches! [Red floats back down, Bebe turn on the lights, and Heidi faces Butters]
HEIDI
Marjorine, what is your problem?
BUTTERS
Huh? Oh nothin'. Hey, you guys wanna tell each other's futures now?
RED
Yeah. I can tell your future, Marjorine! You're going to live alone your entire life because you're a nerdy, dorky geek.
HEIDI
Yeah, and your hair is totally stupid. [Butters looks at his hair ashamed]
BEBE
Yeah, and you're flat! [Butters looks down at his chest]
RED
Marjorine, why don't you just leave? Nobody wants you here!
[South Park cemetery. Butters' tombstone is shown. Stephen approaches with a shovel, and kneels to the grave]
STEPHEN
Hello son. Don't you worry. Daddy's gonna make everything all right again. [begins shoveling dirt out of the way as the sky crackles with thunder and lightning. He finally reaches the coffin and opens it] There he is. There's my boy! Come on, Butters! [lifts the pig out of the coffin] Oh... Butters... you smell like... bacon [carries the carcass] Don't worry. We're gonna bring you back, son. We're gonna bring you back!
[Heidi's house, basement]
WENDY
I think we went too far with Marjorine.
BEBE
She's in the bathroom crying. [the girls move towards the bathroom]
HEIDI
[knocks on bathroom door] Marjorine.
BUTTERS
[sobbing inside] Nobody likes meee...
BEBE
Aw gee, she's really upset.
WENDY
I feel terrible, you guys. It can't be easy being the new girl in school.
HEIDI
Marjorine? Marjorine? Hey, we didn't mean it.
BUTTERS
You don't know how hard it is to be me. [continues sobbing]
BEBE
Marjorine, we were just teasing. We think you're great.
BUTTERS
You think I'm ugly-ehehee...
WENDY
You're not ugly, Marjorine.
BUTTERS
You said I'm ugly and flat.
HEIDI
Marjorine, you just have a different look, that's all. We just... we need to help you bring out your inner beauty.
WENDY
Yeah. How about we all give you a little makeover, Marjorine?
GIRLS
Yeah. Let's go!
BUTTERS
[opens the door] You mean it?
[Outside Turner's house, the boys keep watching.]
KYLE
Dude, it's been too long. Something's wrong. [Craig takes out binoculars to look]
STAN
Maybe they found him out.
CLYDE
Then, he's already dead.
STAN
Come on, we gotta go check on him. [Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny move towards the house, reaching the storm cellar.]
KYLE
Can you see anything? [the boys see Butters dancing with the other girls to Justin Timberlake's song "Rock Your Body"]
STAN
He's just dancing around.
CARTMAN
That son of a bitch!
MRS. TURNER
Marjorine, sweetie your mom's on the phone.
BUTTERS
[stops dancing] My mom? [goes upstairs to the kitchen to answer the phone] Hello?
CARTMAN
Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
BUTTERS
Well, I'm just having some fun with my girlfriends.
CARTMAN
You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device.
BUTTERS
Well, I'm workin' on it.
CARTMAN
Working on what?! Your dance moves?!
BUTTERS
Now look! I'm getting pretty sick of this! Well I put myself through a lot, and you can't talk to me like that! Uh... mom.
CARTMAN
Just do what you were sent to do, dickface! [hangs up]
[The Indian Burial Ground, Stephen gets in the middle and starts digging a hole in order to bury "Butters" again.]
[Heidi's house. Butters returns to the basement]
RED
He yMarjorine, you wanna know your future?
BUTTERS
Ah. Uhh, could I hold that?
HEIDI
Sure. [hands the future teller to Butters, but doesn't take it yet] Here, you do my future.
BUTTERS
How?
HEIDI
Well uh you know, it's easy. You just put your thumbs and index fingers in here...
[Upstairs, Mr. Turner checks with a binocular outdoors. He spots Craig, who senses this and lowers his binoculars]
MR. TURNER
Aha! I knew it! Boys in the slumber party!
[Downstairs, Butters gasps]
HEIDI
There's a boy here?
BUTTERS
[moves towards the stairs pointing the future device] Stand back! I had a... great time tonight, but I gotta do what I was sent here to do! [runs up the stairs and outside]
[Outside.]
CRAIG
He got it! He got the device! [the boys surround Butters]
CARTMAN
Tango tango tango! We've got it! Let's get it to the containment center! Go! [Clyde runs up, gets it, and runs off]
STAN
Come on, Butters.
BUTTERS
No! That darn device is nothin' but trouble! Ah I'm done, and I'm goin' home to tell my Mom and Dad I'm not dead! [takes off his make up and runs off]
HEIDI
[appears at the doorway with her mom and dad and the other girls] What the hell?
CARTMAN
aahahaha, we have the device now! The power belongs to us! [turns around and runs as the other boys run away]
HEIDI
...Anybody have a piece of notebook paper so I can make another one?
[Cartman's backyard]
JASON
Go! Go! Get in the containment field! [Clyde enters it and takes the future device attached to a stick, to the incubation shield. He places it inside. A glass covers it and seals it. Clyde then takes off his clothes and enters a decontamination shower]
[The Stotch house]
LINDA
Stephen, you did what??
STEPHEN
I had to, Linda. If there was even the slightest chance it would bring him back! I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing anymore!
LINDA
You dug up our son's body? Performed some kind of pagan ritual?
STEPHEN
Linda, I did it for you, you wanted him back so much! So did I!
LINDA
Not like this! [slows the voice down] Not like this. He wouldn't be our son, Stephen. He would be a walking abomination. An unholy demon spawn! [knocks are heard on the front door and they both gasp]
BUTTERS
Hello?
STEPHEN
It's him.
LINDA
Keep the door locked.
BUTTERS
Mom? Dad? Uh, it's me, Butters. I'm back. [his parents are horrified]
LINDA
Oh God... [Butters knocks again, then tries to turn the doorknob.] No! [Butters keeps trying to open the door, Linda hides her face on Stephen's shoulder. Silence. Linda begins to cry]
STEPHEN
[soothes her] It's gone, dear. It's gone. Forgive me.
BUTTERS
[enters through the back door] Hey Mom and Dad, I'm not- [Linda screams and hides behind the couch]
STEPHEN
Oh God, it's terrible. What have I done?!
BUTTERS
Uh, I guess you're probably a little surprised to see me.
LINDA
It isn't right! Make it go away!
[The containment center]
CARTMAN
Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of the boy, and mankind. In a few moments, we will know the future. [handles the future-telling device with black gloves]
STAN
Ho-Hold on on guys. We're not sure what this device is capable of. Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it.
CARTMAN
No, No! We don't have time for that, Stan. It's time to ask questions.
CLYDE
How come you get to use it first?
CARTMAN
Because I do, Clyde.
CRAIG
I wanna use it.
CARTMAN
I'm askin' the first question! Let's just start with something simple. Will Kyle die before he's twenty?
KYLE
Wait! I don't wanna know that!
CLYDE
Ask if the Broncos are gonna win on Sunday.
JASON
Nah dude, then it won't be fun to watch.
CARTMAN
Will you all shut up so I can do this!?
CRAIG
You shut up, asshole.
KYLE
I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass! [everyone starts arguing]
STAN
Guys, guys, guys, stop! [everyone goes silent] Look at what this thing is doing to us. Butters was trying to tell me something outside the house. That this device is nothing but trouble. I think I know what he meant now.
JASON
How could be nothing but trouble?
STAN
We risked everything to get it from the girls. How long before the girls attack us to get it back?
CLYDE
Yeah. Forget about the girls. What about if the CIA or, or the Russians know we have this? They'll come after us for sure.
CRAIG
Maybe we should take it so someplace safer.
STAN
And then what? Hide it forever from the government? From the... terrorists who want to use it for evil? Maybe... maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power.
BRADLEY
You mean destroy it?
CARTMAN
Are you guys nuts?! After everything we've gone through!?
STAN
We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are.
CARTMAN
Think of the power!
KYLE
It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed.
[In the woods. Kenny pours propane on the future device and walk back to the crowd of boys. He holds in his hand a detonator]
CARTMAN
Are we sure about this? We'll never know the future.
STAN
Nobody will. That's the way it's suppose to be. Hit it, Kenny. [Kenny presses the button, the device explodes, destroying the surrounding area; the explosion is seen from space. Cartman and Kenny get up covered in ashes]
CARTMAN
Damn, Ken.
[Stotch's house. Stephen takes Linda to the basement while consoling her]'']
STEPHEN
Here. Here, you see? It's going to be all right. Hello... son. [Butters is shown shackled by the neck with chains attached to the basement walls]
BUTTERS
Hi Dad.
LINDA
He was supposed to stay dead!
BUTTERS
Mom, Dad, can I come upstairs now?
STEPHEN
Sorry, son, but... you're a demon spawn now. You're an abomination.
BUTTERS
Can I have something to eat? Well, I'm pretty hungry.
LINDA
It's... hungry.
STEPHEN
Yes, it must feed.
[Upstairs. Stephen opens the front door]
RACHEL
Hello, I'm Rachel with Quality Curtains.
STEPHEN
[nervously] Oh yes, thank you for coming.
RACHEL
Which room are we looking at?
STEPHEN
Just follow me to the basement.
LINDA
Yes. The basement.
RACHEL
[Rachel enters the basement; she begins walking down the stairs] Oh my, it's pretty dark down here. You sure you need curtains? [sees Butters shackled up] Oh my God!
BUTTERS
Uh hello, I'm Butters.
RACHEL
Little boy, what are you doing here? [Stephen kills Rachel with one hit of a shovel]
BUTTERS
Huh?
STEPHEN
[shoves Rachel's corpse closer to Butters with the shovel] Here you go, son. Eat!
LINDA
What are we becoming?!
STEPHEN
Come on. Don't watch it eat. [they turn around and go up the stairs]
BUTTERS
Can I just have some Spaghetti-O's?

synopsis:In an effort to thwart her ex-lovers plans to get married, Mrs. Garrison leads the charge against gay marriage.

script:Follow That Egg!

[South Park Elementary, day. Mrs. Garrison arrives to start class. A carton of eggs sits on her desk.]
MRS. GARRISON
Okay, children, this week we are all going to learn about parenting. [writes the word on the board.] I'm going to pair all the boys and girls in class into couples, and give each couple... [opens the carton of eggs and holds an egg up for the class to see] an egg. You must care for and look after this egg just like a baby for one full week. If you break your egg, it means you have a dead baby, and if you kill your baby, you get an F. When I announce your names, please move and sit with the person you're paired with. [on a magnetic board she has the girls listed on a table and the boys listed outside the table. She pairs the boys up with the girls as he calls them.] Heidi, you'll be with Eric.
HEIDI
[dissatisfied] Awww!
MRS. GARRISON
Annie, you'll be a family with Timmy.
TIMMY
Timmiih!
MRS. GARRISON
Millie, your husband is Craig. Powder, you and Kenny are a loving couple now.
STAN
[worried] Oh no, dude, he's gonna put me with Wendy.
KENNY
(So?)
MRS. GARRISON
Aaand let's see who else we have here, uh...
STAN
So, I haven't even spoken to Wendy since we broke up.
MRS. GARRISON
And, Wendy? Wendy will be with Kyle.
STAN
Kyle??
MRS. GARRISON
Bebe, you're paired up with Stan. Lola and Tolkien, Red and Craig, and Esther and Bradley. [the kids begin to pair up. Mrs. Garrison begins to distribute the eggs] Now, I'm going to sign each of your eggs myself, so that we'll know it's the same one at the end of the week. That way if anybody cheats and tries to replace their eggs, we'll know, Eric. [gives him a stern look] All you have to do is make it to Friday with your egg unharmed to prove what great little parents you are. [Tolkien is somewhat shocked that he got a brown egg. Mrs. Garrison returns to the front of the class] Okay children, you can now take the rest of the school period to decorate your egg however you wish. Good luck, and remember, a dead baby means an F for the parents. [the kids begin decorating their eggs, and music begins to play]
[seated at his desk gazing at the students, daydreaming]
Just look at all these little families
Newfound couples in a happy home.
It takes me back to another time
When I had a love of my own. [holds in her hands a signed portrait of Mr. Slave]

[bolts up and starts singing aloud]
Love, love lost long ago, it was special then, it's over now.
[picking flowers in a meadow]
Love, so darn frail, you know? It shriveled and died. I don't know how.

[Stan wanders through the neighborhood with hands in his pockets and reaches Wendy's place. He looks through a window and sees Kyle and Wendy working on their assignment in the kitchen. Mr. Garrison appears next to him]
Love, love lost long ago, it was special then, it's over now.
[prances through town and stops at a bridal shop. She imagines himself as the bride]
Guess that I'll never know how it all went wrong. How how how?
[sits on her bed holding the portrait, then decides to drive to Mr. Slave's house.]
Well perhaps I should try and boldly go and rekindle that love lost long ago.
[steps out of his car, goes up to the doorbell, and rings it. Mr. Slave opens there, then expresses a muted surprise] Hello, Mr. Slave. [bats her eyes at him]
MR. SLAVE
Mr. Garrison! Ohoh, Jezuth!
MRS. GARRISON
[sweetly] Just let me say what I came here to say. I know we had a falling out and... things were said that... shouldn't have been said. I want to apologize for calling you a faggot.
MR. SLAVE
That's, that's wonderful, Mr. Garrison!
MRS. GARRISON
Well, wait, wait, it gets better. I've forgiven you for walking out on me after I had my sex change, and uh... [gushes] And I'm ready to take you back, Mr. Slave!
MR. SLAVE
Ooooo...
MRS. GARRISON
Well, give us a kiss!
BIG GAY AL
[appearing in the background] Say, honey, is that the pizza? [Mrs. Garrison is dismayed that it's Big Gay Al Mr. Slave is with]
MRS. GARRISON
[storms inside] What the hell is he doing here?!
MR. SLAVE
Mr. Garrison, Al and I have been living together for a few months.
MRS. GARRISON
Well, that didn't take you long, did it?!
BIG GAY AL
Slave, should I leave you two alone?
MRS. GARRISON
Yes!
MR. SLAVE
No! [walks over to Big Gay Al and stands next to him] Mr. Garrison, there's something you should know. Al and I are getting married.
MRS. GARRISON
Married?!
BIG GAY AL
[holds Mr. Slave's hand] Yes.
MRS. GARRISON
You can't get married! You're faggots!
MR. SLAVE
[puts his hand to his forehead] Oh, Jesus Christ.
MRS. GARRISON
Mr. Slave, I am legally a woman now! If you wanna get married, you have to marry ME!
BIG GAY AL
Oh that's not true! Colorado is about to pass a bill which allows same-sex marriage.
MR. SLAVE
We're getting married right after the bill passes on Saturday.
MRS. GARRISON
Oh, that's just great! They're gonna let queers and homos get married, huh?!
MR. SLAVE
Okay, that's enough. Out, Mr. Garrison.
MRS. GARRISON
We'll just see about this, you fudge-packin' fags!! I'll stop that gay-marriage law! [turns and leaves for the front door]
MR. SLAVE
Oh my God, you're just saying that because you're jealous.
MRS. GARRISON
[turns around] Jealous of what?! I'm doin' this out of principle! To protect the sanctity of marriage! [backs up towards the front door] Fags are gettin' married over MY DEAD BODY!! [slams the door shut. Mr. Slave and Al look at each other]
[Stan's house, living room. Stan sits at the coffee table steaming over the pairing of Wendy and Kyle. A cordless phone sits before him. He picks it up and dials it. It rings at a house, and Kyle goes over to answer it.]
KYLE
Hello? Oh, hey, dude.
STAN
So, what are you and Wendy doing?
KYLE
Oh, we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg. We figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an A.
STAN
Uh huh...
KYLE
I don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking. This whole assignment is stupid.
STAN
Yeah, well, so is your hat. [hangs up and sets the phone down. Kyle is puzzled, Stan is upset. The doorbell rings and Stan goes to answer it]
BEBE
[holding their egg] Stan, I need you to watch the egg for a while.
STAN
I can't. I'm busy.
BEBE
I've been looking after it all day. I have to go to the hair salon and the candy store!
STAN
...So take it with you!
BEBE
Stan, this is our egg. We're both supposed to take care of it.
STAN
[crosses his arms, turns around and goes inside] Well, maybe I didn't want to have an egg with you, okay, Bebe?!
BEBE
[follows him in] Well, whether you wanted to or not, doesn't really matter now! We're going to get graded together! It's your egg too! Own up to your responsibilities! [leaves the egg with him and walks out. Stan stands there with the egg for a few moments, then sits on the sofa and tosses the egg aside. He turns on the TV to catch an episode of "One Day At A Time"]
[South Park, in front of the library. Mrs. Garrison is speaking to a large crowd gathered there.]
MRS. GARRISON
These homosexuals think they can just step all over our traditions! Well I say: Marriage is a holy sacrament between a man and a woman! [the crowd applauds]
WOMAN
Who is that lady?
MAN
I don't know, but she is pissed.
MRS. GARRISON
They passed this law behind our back! We need to tell the governor and the world that gay marriage is not okay! That homosexuals cannot muddy our traditions! And there is only one way for us, all together, to make that message very clear! We need to round up three or four queers and beat the livin' hell out of them! [Everyone else falls silent. She steps out from behind the podium and crouches a bit] Come on, everybody! Let's get some queers, and some trucks, and have us a good old-fashioned fag drag!
MAN 2
Well uh, we were thinkin' we would, you know, just go appeal to the Governor.
MRS. GARRISON
Appeal to the Governor? Oh,come on! Where's your balls?! Fag drag!
MAN 3
We don't "hate" homosexuals, we, we we just don't want them to be able to marry.
MAN 4
Yeah, we were just thinkin' o' goin' and askin' the Governor to veto the bill.
MAN 5
Yeah.
MRS. GARRISON
[looking all alone now] Eh fah, fag drag?
[Governor's building, day. Mrs. Garrison stands with a crowd of supporters inside the Governor's office.]
MRS. GARRISON
Governor, we have collected over one thousand signatures requesting that you veto this gay-marriage bill!
BILL OWENS
[with emotion] Oh jeez, I knew this would happen. First the gay people come in here wanting equal rights, then this bill gets passed and now all the people against it want me to veto it. [slams his right fist on his desk] Why do I have to make this decision??
MRS. GARRISON
Because you're the governor?
BILL OWENS
I just wanted a big house and lots of respect. I didn't want this kind of responsibility. [rises form his desk and turns away, walking towards a window] I mean, I don't know anything about gay marriage. What argument can I use to deny them their right to a family?
MRS. GARRISON
Well, think of the children! If you allow gays to get married, then you're also givin' them full rights as parents to adopt. You think kids can be raised by queers??
BILL OWENS
I can't use that argument. There's never been a study done which proves that either way.
MRS. GARRISON
[gets an idea] But, if you had such a study, a scientific study which proved same-sex couples are incapable of raising a child...
BILL OWENS
Then I would have something to fall back on. So-something to take all the pressure off of me.
MRS. GARRISON
[confidently] Mr. Governor, I will get you that study.
[South Park Elementary, day. The kids trickle into class. Bebe approaches Wendy, each one holding an egg.]
BEBE
Hey Wendy, how's your egg doing?
WENDY
Oh great. It's a pretty easy project. Kyle's really good with the egg. [beams at Kyle. Stan looks on, miffed]
BEBE
Yeah. [gets angry] I wish I had a partner like Kyle! I went to go pick up the egg from Stan yesterday, and his dog had it in its mouth! Our egg isn't gonna last a week with Stan around!
MRS. GARRISON
[enters with four big books and drops them on her desk] Okay, students, change of plan! [walks over to the magnetic chalkboard] You've all been doing a great job taking care of your eggs, but now we're going to mix it up a little. Wendy and Kyle will no longer be together.
STAN
[points at Kyle] HA!
MRS. GARRISON
Let's see what happens when we put two same-sex couples together to take care of an egg, shall we?! Kyle, you are now with Stan! And Wendy is with Bebe! [Kyle and Wendy exchange glances]
KYLE
Why?
MRS. GARRISON
Come on, Bebe. We'll take your egg for you and Wendy to look after.
BEBE
Oh, goodie. [moves over to take a seat next to Wendy]
MRS. GARRISON
And we'll just take this egg for Stan and Kyle to look out for. [takes Wendy's egg...]
WENDY
No. No, that's my egg.
MRS. GARRISON
Wendy, we're doing an experiment. [...and gives her Bebe's egg...] Here you go, boys. [...and gives Wendy's egg to the boys]
WENDY
But I made that egg. Mr. Garrison, please. Youyou can't give my egg to Stan, he'll break it.
MRS. GARRISON
[ebullient] Hoh now, what makes you say that, Wendy? I'm sure two boys can handle an egg just fine... [goes towards the chalkboard, scheming] And if not, we'll certainly prove a point to that goddamned Governor, won't we?
KYLE
Who?
MRS. GARRISON
[shifty] Never mind, just carry on, children. Just carry on as two reckless little boys will.
[Kyle's house, day. He and Kyle are in the kitchen. Kyle is designing a container for their egg.]
KYLE
Okay, there. Now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked.
STAN
Alright, give it to me. I'll take it home tonight.
KYLE
Look, Stan, you want me to just take care of this egg?
STAN
[suspicious] Why do you say that?
KYLE
It's just that... I really need this A, Stan. And Bebe did say you almost broke your last egg.
STAN
That's because I was pissed off!
KYLE
At who? [the doorbell rings] Heh- hang on. [goes to answer the door and finds Wendy outside]
WENDY
[wistfully] I wanna see my egg.
KYLE
Huh?
WENDY
[enunciates] I want to see my egg.
KYLE
Wendy, it isn't your egg anymore!
WENDY
Yes it is. I made it, I decorated it.
KYLE
Well, you might have made it, but we're the ones who are taking care of it now. You have your own egg to look out for!
WENDY
...I just wanna hold my egg for a couple of minutes.
KYLE
[consoles her a bit, but turns her away] Wendy, I just wanna get an A, okay? Let's not make this any more confusing than it already is. <>[Stan peeks out from the kitchen and sees Kyle's arm around Wendy]
WENDY
Don't let anything happen to it, please. [Stan gets upset and disappears back into the kitchen]
KYLE
Wendy, nothing's gonna happen to the egg. You can have it when the week is over and I have my grade. [slams the door on her and returns to the kitchen, where an angry Stan is sitting in his chair with his arms crossed] Freakin' weirdos, man.
STAN
You think you're so great, don't you?! Well guess what?! Maybe I don't need your help! I'm taking the egg home tonight, and I'm gonna show everybody tomorrow that I'm every bit as good an egg-take-care-over as you! [hops off the chair and rushes out the side door]
KYLE
What the hell is wrong with everybody?
[South Park Elementary, day. Mrs. Garrison enters with more books.]
MRS. GARRISON
Okay, children, it's Wednesday! Time for an official egg check! Heidi and Eric?
HEIDI
Our egg is fine.
MRS. GARRISON
[writes OK on their row] Okay, Annie and Timmy?
TIMMY
TimmiIH!
MRS. GARRISON
[writes OK on their row] Good. Millie and Clyde, I saw yours before class. [writes OK on their row] Powder and Kenny?
KENNY
(Our egg is okay.)
MRS. GARRISON
[writes OK on their row] Now how about our gay couples? Stan and Kyle?
STAN
[determined, willful] Fine!
MRS. GARRISON
What?
STAN
No problems at all!
MRS. GARRISON
[turns around in anger] That's impossible! [snatches the egg from Stan's hand and looks it over carefully] Are you sure you didn't break it and switch eggs on me?! Where's my signature?!
STAN
It's right there, see? [leans towards Kyle in fear. Wendy looks down and away from the action]
MRS. GARRISON
Two boys can't possibly take care of an egg!
KYLE
Dude, it's totally fine.
MRS. GARRISON
It isn't fine! It has two daddies! You call that fine?! It may be fine on the outside, but inside it's confused and embarrassed! Look at the freak egg! It has two daddies! [taunts the egg directly] Two daddies! Two daddies! Come on, class, let's rip on the freak egg! Two daddies! Two daddies!
[Governor's building, day.]
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing outside the Governor's office, where in just two days, the Governor can either sign or veto the new bill allowing gay marriage. Same-sex couples from all over the state have shown up in support, [Mr. Slave and Big Gay Al are there] while dissenters have also converged. The governor is about to give a statement.
BILL OWENS
I believe that I might have come up with a compromise to this whole problem that will make everyone happy! People in the gay community want the same rights as married couples, but dissenters don't want the word "marriage" corrupted. So how about we let gay people get married, but call it something else? [everyone listens quietly] You homosexuals will have all exactly the same rights as married couples, but instead of referring to you as "married," you can be... butt buddies. [long silence] Instead of being "man and wife," you'll be... butt buddies. You won't be "betrothed," you'll be... butt buddies. Get it? Instead of a "bride and groom," you'd be... butt buddies.
MR. SLAVE
We wanna be treated equally!
BILL OWENS
Y-you are equal. It's just that instead of getting "engaged," you would be... butt buuuddies. And everyone is happy!
WOMAN
Well what about lesbians?!
BILL OWENS
Well like anyone cares about fuckin' dykes. [the crowd goes into an uproar] Oh, God, I was sure that would work.
[South Park Elementary, day. Mrs. Garrison is at her desk reviewing daily egg evaluations. He's reading Stan and Kyle's.]
MRS. GARRISON
Damnit, damnit! Stan and Kyle's egg is still doin' fine! Those little assholes are screwin' up my entire plan! [there's a knock on the classroom door] Yes, what?! [Cartman walks in with his shattered egg and sits on the chair next to the desk. He places the egg on the desk, crosses his arms and looks away. Mrs. Garrison looks at the egg and is dismayed] What the hell is this?!
CARTMAN
I broke the egg.
MRS. GARRISON
You broke your egg?? Uh but you're partnered with a girl.
CARTMAN
I tried to cover it up, tried to put it back together with modeling glue, tried to seal it with a soldering gun, but, I give up. I can't hide it, I broke the egg.
MRS. GARRISON
Did you tell anyone else about this?
CARTMAN
...No.
MRS. GARRISON
Did you tell your egg partner, Heidi?
CARTMAN
No. That's why I'm here. I think you should still give Heidi an A on the project. You see, I broke the egg, not her. And so, I should get an F, and she should get an A, which means that together the grade should average out to C minus for both of us.
MRS. GARRISON
I can't do that, Eric!
CARTMAN
Damnit! I knew you'd say that! You always have it out for me!
MRS. GARRISON
You have to get an A, Eric. Here: I'll sign this new egg for you. We'll pretend this never happened, all right? [goes about making a duplicate egg for Cartman] Just... put on the old hair, color in the same eyes... There we go, good as new. [places it near Cartman and puts the shattered one in his desk drawer] Go enjoy the rest of your recess.
CARTMAN
[thinks about what just happened] Mr. Garrison..., you've never been this cool to me before.
MRS. GARRISON
...Okay, well, you're welcome, Eric. Now, just run along. [continues grading papers]
CARTMAN
...Why are you doing this?
MRS. GARRISON
Because I'm a nice teacher, all right?
CARTMAN
What do you want from me?
MRS. GARRISON
Nothing! It's all okay! Just take your damn egg!
CARTMAN
...No.
MRS. GARRISON
[quickly grabs Cartman by the collar] Eric, you've never been anything but a problem for me! You're taking that egg! And if you break it again, I'll break both your legs, and burn down your house! Do you hear me?!
CARTMAN
[choking] Yes teacher.
MRS. GARRISON
[releases him] Get out of my face! [Eric gets his new egg and rushes out of the classroom] Urrgh, this scientific study isn't turning out the way I planned! Looks like I'm gonna have to... intervene.
[Akbar, night, a seedy side of town. Mrs. Garrison enters and looks around, sees her target and walks over. She sits opposite a rough-looking man.]
MRS. GARRISON
Are you Jakartha?
JAKARTHA
Who the hell are you?!
MRS. GARRISON
Mrs. Garrison. I spoke to your associates on the telephone.
JAKARTHA
Ahh yes, you are interested in my services.
MRS. GARRISON
I have a little... problem I need taken care of. I heard you're the best.
JAKARTHA
Who do you want me to kill? [Mrs. Garrison pulls out a photo from her purse and puts it face down on the table, then slides it towards Jakartha. Jakartha picks it up and looks at it. It's a picture of Stan and Kyle's egg] What is this?
MRS. GARRISON
It's an egg.
JAKARTHA
You want me to kill an egg?
MRS. GARRISON
I can pay two thousand now, three more when the job is finished.
JAKARTHA
What do you expect me to do with it?
MRS. GARRISON
I don't care. Scramble it, fry it, do what you will! It has to look like an accident.
JAKARTHA
I am a serious assassin! Get out of my face!
MRS. GARRISON
What's the matter? You... afraid you can't do it? Can't say that I blame ya. That egg has caused me nothin' but problems since day one! [rises and steps away from the table] I guess... you're not as good as they say you are...
JAKARTHA
[jabs a Bowie knife into the table and rises violently] I am the greatest killer the world has ever seen!!
MRS. GARRISON
Then why are you scared of one little egg?!
JAKARTHA
I will murder that egg! Then I will make it curse the day it was laid!
MRS. GARRISON
That's more like it!
[Stan's house, dawn. Stan packs his books into his backpack, then goes to the phone table to see his egg.]
STAN
Day five. I made it! [the phone rings, and he answers] Hello?
[Kyle's house, dawn. His family is eating breakfast in the kitchen.]
KYLE
Dude, did you hear what's happening?
STAN
What?
KYLE
Garrison is taking us all on a field trip today. He wants to do the final egg check in front of the Governor's office!
STAN
Governor's office?
KYLE
She's really taking this grade seriously, Stan. I'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together, all right?
STAN
Aah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?! I took care of this egg, Kyle, not you!
KYLE
Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?!
STAN
What's up?! Oh, nothing except that you've been trying to impress Wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole!
KYLE
Impress Wendy??
STAN
You've set it all up to look like you're this awesome prince and I'm just a loser!
KYLE
What the hell are you talking about?!
STAN
Well guess what?! I'm gonna take this egg to class myself! And I'm gonna hold it up in front of Wendy, and say "See?! I'm every bit as good as Kyle is." [a laser dot snakes its way up the egg. Stan notices this with some surprise, and the egg explodes in his hand. Some of it lands on his face and cap. Jakartha appears behind the bushes across the street and lowers his sniper rifle]
JAKARTHA
Almost too easy. [drops down and crawls away]
STAN
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
KYLE
Stan?
STAN
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
[Stan's house, day. He's in his room with his head down on his desk buried in his arms, with the shattered egg next to him. His door opens and Kyle steps in.]
KYLE
Stan? Stan, I think we should talk.
STAN
[softly crying, muffled] Dude, you should just go be with Wendy and be happy.
KYLE
Stan, I don't like Wendy. [Stan's raises his head and listens] All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project!
STAN
Yeah well, I blew it. Now we're gonna fail and Wendy thinks I'm a total loser.
KYLE
I thought you didn't care about Wendy anymore.
STAN
I don't. She's totally lame. [he drops his head into his arms again.]
KYLE
Stan, there was never anything between Wendy and I. [Stan's raises his head again] I wouldn't go out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend.
STAN
[hops off his chair and approaches Kyle, head down] I'm sorry I didn't trust you, Kyle. I'm obviously just a crappy best friend to have.
KYLE
Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either.
STAN
Huh?
KYLE
[turns away and walks a few paces] It was really important for me to get an A, Stan. And Bebe said you were so reckless with your egg, so I made a fake one for you [reaches into his jacket and pulls out an egg] and kept the original safe with me.
STAN
That... [walks up to Kyle and points at the egg] That's the real egg with Garrison's signature?
KYLE
Yeah dude. I'm sorry.
STAN
Then... then Wendy won't think I'm a total loser!
KYLE
Yeah. And I can still get my A!
STAN
Come on, buddy, let's go! [walks happily towards his door. Kyle steps forward, then stops]
KYLE
Stan... [Stan turns, then he turns away] Do you really think my hat is stupid?
STAN
[walks back and puts his left hand on Kyle's shoulder] As a matter of fact,... I think it is the nicest hat I've ever known. [Kyle smiles and Stan pats him twice on the back] Come on! [they head out]
[Governor's office, outside. The Governor is speaking.]
BILL OWENS
Today is a very big day in which I'm supposed to make a very big decision. As some of you know, my biggest issue with gay marriage regards child-rearing. And a new study has just been concluded which will give me the ability to take no personal responsibility in this decision.
BIG GAY AL
A new study?
BILL OWENS
Here with the results of that study is the lovely Mrs. Garrison. [steps aside and gives her the podium.]
MRS. GARRISON
[floats in like a diva] Thank you, Governor.
MR. SLAVE
[strokes his temple] Oh, Jesus Christ.
MRS. GARRISON
Ladies and Gentlemen, with the help of some adorable fourth-grade students, we've completed our scientific, non-biased study of fags having kids. Come on up, children. [the kids file into view and spread out before the podium. Jakartha shows up as well and stands next to the white chalkboard.] The parents were grouped together as male and female. As you can see...
AIDE
[rushes up with a phone] Uh, Mrs. Garrison. You have an emergency phone call.
MRS. GARRISON
[takes the phone and answers] Yes, what is it?! I'm a little busy!
KYLE
[in the back seat of a speeding cab with Stan] Mr. Garrison, it's Kyle! Our egg is okay! We'll be there in a couple of minutes!
MRS. GARRISON
[turns away from the mic] What?? Y-your... you're too late!
KYLE
Don't fail us! We'll be right there!
MRS. GARRISON
No you can'- Hello? Hello!! [hauls Jakartha into view by the lapel] You told me you killed that freak egg!!
JAKARTHA
I was sure I did!
MRS. GARRISON
Well it's here! You'd better make damn sure it doesn't reach these steps uncracked! [shoves him away and returns to the mic] Haha, anyhow, as I was saying, we put one egg into the hands of two male students. [far away from the podium the cab screeches to a stop and the left back door opens. Stan hops out]
KYLE
[pays the cabbie] Thanks dude! [hops out behind Stan]
STAN
There! Over there! [they run through the crowd, taking care the egg doesn't fall out and break] Excuse us! Excuse us please!
JAKARTHA
[runs alongside them, aiming at the egg] Yeeeeaah! [opens fire. People begin to fall away left and right]
STAN
Jesus Christ!
KYLE
Keep running! [other people hear the gunfire and look around]
MRS. GARRISON
The the egg that the two boys were given just-
KYLE
Hang on! Wait! [Jakartha bumps someone aside and starts detonating hidden bombs around the plaza. Groups of people are thrown off in all directions. The Governor begins to pay attention]
MRS. GARRISON
In conclusion, Governor, you can rest assured that-! [one last blast is especially deadly. The area fills with dark brown smoke. As the smoke clears, Stan and Kyle hobble towards the podium, tattered clothes and all]
STAN
[tired, voice breaking] Teacher, our egg is... okay. [falls onto his back and passes out, holding the egg high for all to see]
BILL OWENS
[kneels to inspect the egg] This egg is fine. [rises and steps forth] Gays can get married! [everyone cheers and gay couples hug each other in celebration.]
MRS. GARRISON
Noo! Noooo!!
KYLE
[still woozy] Gays can get married? What??
[Wedding of Big Gay Al and Mr. Slave, at a gazebo nearby. The guests are in place, the happy couple and the minister are on the gazebo floor.]
FR. MAXI
I now pronounce you man... and man. [both men, Al and Slave, are wearing wedding dresses. They turn to face each other and kiss on the lips. Everyone present cheers, and Mr. Slave and Al run down the aisle to their new life together. Stan and Kyle appear as the crowd disperses]
RANDY
[walks up and kneels next to Stan] Boys, I'm really proud of you. You've done an amazing thing for marriage rights. [rises and walks away. Wendy walks up]
KYLE
[still confused] What did we do?
WENDY
Stan, I'm sorry I doubted you. You really made a great dad.
STAN
[smugly] Like I give a crap about what you think, Wendy. [Wendy's face falls, then she turns and walks away sadly.]
MRS. GARRISON
Love, love lost long ago, it was special then, it's over now.
Guess that I'll never know how it all went wrong. How how how?
Well perhaps I should try and boldly go and rekindle that love lost long ago.
End of Follow That Egg!

synopsis:After the sudden on-set of the disease Gingervitis, Cartman rallies all other ginger kids to rise up and assume their role as the master race.

script:Ginger Kids

[South Park Elementary, day, Mrs. Garrison's classroom. Oral Report Day. Tolkien is at the front of the class with a picture of all the planets rising over the moon on the roll-up screen.]
TOLKIEN
Pluto is also the furthest planet from the sun, though scientists believe more planets lie beyond it. I hope you enjoyed my report on the Solar System. Thank you. [the projector turns off and Tolkien takes his seat as Timmy claps a little]
MRS. GARRISON
Okay, very nice, Tolkien. Thank you. 'K kids, looks like we only have time for one more speech today, so let's have uh Eric.
CARTMAN
[walks up to the front of the class and turns around, looking at his paper] Thank you, Mrs. Garrison. [reads] My speech is entitled "Ginger Kids: Children with red hair, light skin, and freckles." [Stan and Kyle glance at each other] We've all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. I'm talking of course about... ginger kids. [cues up his pics. A red-headed boy appears] Aww sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles. [next picture is of a girl licking her triple-scoop ice-cream cone] Aw, nasty! Yuck! [returns to his paper] This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls.
KYLE
[annoyed at Cartman's ignorance] What?!
CARTMAN
Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured. [another redheaded girls pops up] Ah sick! [another redhead] Gross! [another redhead] Yeck! [returns to his paper] Because their skin is so light, ginger kids must avoid the sun. Not unlike... [a picture of a vampire with a full moon and bats behind him pops up] vampires.
CLASS
Aaaah.
KYLE
That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun!
CARTMAN
I was getting to that, if you will let me. [returns to his paper] Some people have red hair, but not light skin and freckles. These people are called "daywalkers." [cues up a picture of Kyle, with "daywalkers" written underneath]
BUTTERS
Oh! Daywalkers!
KYLE
This is all a bunch of crap!
CARTMAN
Mrs. Garrison, I'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions.
MRS. GARRISON
Kyle, let Eric give his presentation.
KYLE
It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers!
CLYDE
[glances around] I am.
MRS. GARRISON
Kyle, if you wanna debate Eric, you can do so with your paper tomorrow!
KYLE
Fine, I will! [crosses his arms]
CARTMAN
Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth! [Kyle grits his teeth and growls, trying to contain himself] Let's see, where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse, [next picture: a boy with a few missing front teeth] and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one, [the last pic is that of Carrot Top] think again. [the bell rings and the kids file out of the classroom.]
KYLE
Stupid supremacist asswipe!
STAN
Dude, what's the big deal?
KYLE
What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?
STAN
[thinks a moment] What about the Foley family? I think they're all ginger.
[South Park, day. Stan and Kyle walk up to a house. The front door opens and three redheads greet them.]
THREE KIDS
Hello?
KYLE
Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions?
GIRL
[the middle child] Sure. Come on in. [waves them in. They enter]
BOY
[the oldest child] Mom, Dad, these boys wanna know about us.
FATHER
What? Heh, hello there, kids.
KYLE
We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles.
FATHER
[nervous throughout] Oho, gingers, yes. Our cute little red-haired rascals.
STAN
I'm sorry, but I don't understand. You both have dark hair and brown eyes.
FATHER
Yes, we've learned that the ginger gene is recessive in both our families' DNA. Actually, the odds of us having a red-haired freckled child were only one in four. And still it happened. Three times. What are the odds? [breaks down and sobs into his hands]
MOTHER
A lot of people carry the ginger gene and don't know. [her husband stops sobbing and raises his head] If your spouse is also a carrier, then your children can turn out like... them. [they both look at the kids, who smile and grin]
FATHER
Each one of them's a blessing.
MOTHER
Oh yes, each one of them's a blessing.
FATHER
Huh Blesse-blessing full of love.
THREE KIDS
[grinning] Thanks, Mom and Dad.
KYLE
But it's... it's not true they... have no souls. [somber music plays]
FATHER
No... no, I'm sure they do. [quickly rises and shows the boys to the door] Well it was nice meeting you boys. We've gotta get dinner started.
KYLE
I just had a couple more questions about-
FATHER
Look, boys, if you really don't wanna have ginger kids, marry an Asian woman. Asians don't carry the recessive gene. [looks right and left] I know a guy who's marrying a Japanese woman very soon for just that reason. [closes the door on them and they turn around]
[South Park Elementary, day, Mrs. Garrison's classroom. Second Oral Report Day. Kyle stands at the front of the class with an image of melanin's chemical structure.]
KYLE
And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul, [Cartman yawns] but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you. [turns off the projector and goes to his desk amid some applause]
MRS. GARRISON
Okay, very nice, Kyle. A little dry and science-y for my taste, but there you go. [the bell rings] All right, that's lunch, kids. We'll pick up with Clyde's speech about lesbian cheerleaders after recess.
BUTTERS
That was a very informative speech, Kyle.
KYLE
Thanks, Butters.
CARTMAN
Informative if you want to die. [hops off his seat and joins Butters and Kyle] Guys, don't forget. Kyle is a daywalker. Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves. Make no mistake: ginger kids are evil. You know who was ginger? Judas. And what did Judas do? Oh, he just got Jesus killed, that's all. [moves towards the door] Look, I'm just saying what everyone else already thinks: Gingers are creepy. And one night, when you're all sleepin' in your room, the gingers are gonna getcha. They're gonna GETCHA! [points at Clyde, who jumps back.]
[South Park Elementary hallway. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny walk towards the camera.]
STAN
You buying school lunch today?
KYLE
Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch.
CLYDE
[off screen] Right this way! [the camera shows four boys - Craig, Jimmy, Clyde and Tolkien - kicking a redhead out] You can't eat in the cafeteria! [Craig crosses his arms]
BOY
How come?
TOLKIEN
Ginger kids eat in the hallway!
JIMMY
Yeah. Go on, beat it, re... rr-retard! [the redhead walks off and the other four boys go back inside the cafeteria]
KYLE
There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!
STAN
That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger.
KYLE
[thinks] Hey. [snaps his fingers] That's a great idea!
KENNY
(What's a great idea?)
KYLE
Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?
STAN
Sure, for what?
KYLE
We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!
[Cartman's house, midnight. Cartman is snoring. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny pop up outside his window and open it. They climb in. Stan motions Kenny to Cartman's door, and Kenny walks over to close it. Stan quickly goes to Cartman's desk and takes out some makeup - skin bleach, hair color, henna kit - and some yellow latex gloves.]
STAN
Okay dude, knock him out. [Kyle takes out a small club and beats Cartman with it once. He looks at him angrily. His short temper got the best of him and starts beating him more. After five blows Stan rushes over to stop him] Dude, dude okay, he's out! [with the club gone, Kyle resorts to punching Cartman out] Kyle, that's good! [Kenny puts his ear to the door and listens for any activity in the hallway] All right, let's do it.
[Cartman's house, morning. Liane, in her night robe, walks over to Cartman's room and knocks on the door.]
LIANE
Eric honey, time to get up for school. [heads back to the kitchen downstairs. Cartman rolls over and wakes up, hops down and leaves his room]
CARTMAN
-ed a fine time to leave me, Lucille
Four hungry children and a-
LIANE
[hears him and drops the spatula] Poopsiekins! [rushes back to the restroom, leaving her eggs cooking. Cartman checks his face thoroughly, but continues to scream. Liane arrives and enters] Sweetie, what is the- [he turns around and she screams] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
CARTMAN
I'M GINGER!
LIANE
Oh my God! Eric!
CARTMAN
Help me! Hellp mee!
[A hospital room. A doctor gives Cartman a check-up.]
DOCTOR
Well, all his vital signs are still normal. From his outward appearance, I would say he has the standard skin pigment deficiency.
LIANE
You mean...
DOCTOR
Yes, I'm afraid that your son is suffering from gingervitus.
CARTMAN
And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn't born like this!
DOCTOR
Well, the red-haired and freckle gene is a recessive gene. It must've stayed dormant in your system until you hit adolescence.
CARTMAN
So I'm gonna stay like this forever?
DOCTOR
[puts a hand on Cartman's back] I'm sorry, son. [takes Liane aside] Ms. Cartman, could I have a word with you? [walks a few steps with Liane] Ms. Cartman, I know this must be... very difficult for you. I for one can't stand red-haired, freckled kids, but you need to understand, there is no cure. Your son will be ginger his whole life. You might want to just... put him down.
LIANE
Oh... [looks away. Cartman hops off the bed and walks up and stands between them.]
CARTMAN
Agh, excuse me, Doctor, but it just so happens my mom loves me, no matter what I look like! [crosses his arms] Right, Mom?! [a bit shocked when she doesn't answer right away] Mom?!
LIANE
Oh ye-yes, of course,sweetie.
DOCTOR
All right, but... you're gonna have to take certain precautions now. It's very important that you keep Eric out of the sun. The sun... is his worst enemy.
[The school bus stop, morning. Stan, Kyle and Kenny are waiting there, as usual. Cartman walks up with a blue umbrella open, shielding him from the sun.]
CARTMAN
Hey dudes, what's goin' on? [coughs to clear his throat] How is everything with you guys?
KYLE
Wow, Cartman. You look... different.
CARTMAN
Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency.
STAN
You mean,you're a ginger?
CARTMAN
Actually, gingervitus is the medical term.
KYLE
Is that an umbrella you're using?
CARTMAN
Yes, Kyle. [coughs] The sun's rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected when I'm outside. Well, I'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way, and now we can just go on with our lives as normal.
KYLE
[looks at Stan for a moment] ...Wow, that's a little ironic, isn't it?
CARTMAN
What do you mean, Kyle?
KYLE
Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one.
CARTMAN
[thinks] Hm. I don't really see the irony in that, Kyle. [the school bus pulls up and opens its doors. The kids climb in and find seats]
[The school bus. Cartman sits next to Butters, who's taken aback at Cartman's new appearance. A few moments later, Butters begins to laugh.]
CARTMAN
That's fine, just get it out of the way...
KYLE
Dude, this is going awesome.
STAN
Maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time. [Butters strokes his nose, then takes out a napkin to wipe away tears from the laughter, then sighs, only to resume laughing, harder. Cartman just folds his arms across his chest and looks away]
[The school cafeteria. The kids are eating, but there's not a redhead to be seen in there... except for.]
CARTMAN
[Walks up to an empty space between Clyde and Tolkien] Hey Clyde, Tolkien. Sup, Jim? [begins to eat]
TOLKIEN
What are you doing?
CARTMAN
I'm grubbin'. What's it look like?
CLYDE
You're not supposed to be in the cafeteria.
CARTMAN
Huh?
CRAIG
You know the rule. No ginger kids in the cafeteria.
CARTMAN
But... it's me.
CLYDE
Right. And you're a ginger. [at a nearby table, Stan is about to eat his burger, but Kyle softly jabs him]
KYLE
Dude, check it out. [Stan looks over]
CARTMAN
Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside. [the camera looks around at the other kids at the table, who remain silent]
CLYDE
Sorry. If we let one ginger kid in here, then the others are gonna start coming.
JIMMY
Yeah, beat it, j... jackass. [Cartman is stunned, but takes his tray and walks away. He walks past Kyle, Stan, and Kenny.]
KYLE
We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers.
[The South Park Elementary Library. Cartman did indeed think long and hard about this, so now he's holding this meeting.]
CARTMAN
I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and freckles, we're thought of as somehow less important, and it's bullcrap!
BOY
Yeah!
CARTMAN
Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us "genetically inferior." The world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are!
OLDER BOY
My dad says that each one of my freckles is a kiss from an angel.
CARTMAN
...Riiight, exactly! We can't let this go on any longer! We should be PROUD of who we are! Think about all the great people in history who were ginger. People like... [he can't think of any] Like uh... [looks up in thought, then softly] Liiike...
GIRL
Ron Howard?
CARTMAN
Right! Ron Howard! And uh... Aaaaand...
OLDER BOY
Ron Howard? [the other redheads look at him]
CARTMAN
Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It's time for us to take back our pride!
KIDS
Yeah!
[The playground, moments later. A girl chases a boy around. Stan, Kyle and Kenny play tetherball.]
CARTMAN
Red Power! [Stan stops the game and the boys look at the source of commotion. Cartman leads the gingers across the playground]
GINGERS
Red Power!
CARTMAN
Red Power!
GINGERS
Red Power!
CARTMAN
Red Power!
GINGERS
Red Power!
CARTMAN
Red Power!
GINGERS
Red Power!
CARTMAN
We gingers are proud people! We are the noble descendants of great Americans like Ron Howard, and ...others! We will not be discriminated against any longer, for we are a great race!
GINGERS
Yeah!
CARTMAN
[resumes the march] Red Power!
GINGERS
Red Power!
CARTMAN
Red Power!
GINGERS
Red Power!
KYLE
I don't believe it.
CARTMAN
Red Power!
STAN
Should we tell him the truth?
GINGERS
Red Power!
KYLE
Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer. [he and Stan return to their tetherball game]
CARTMAN
Red Power!
GINGERS
Red Power!
CARTMAN
Better red than dead!
GINGERS
Better red than dead!
CARTMAN
Better red than dead!
[New break. A field reporter stands outside a theater, with a crowd milling around behind him.]
CHRIS
Tom, I'm standing outside the Denver Center For The Performing Arts, where the new production of "Annie" has just premiered to cries of outrage. [a shot of gingers with Cartman front and center] A rapidly-growing organization called The Ginger Separatist Movement is furious that the lead role of Annie [shown, in character] is being played by a girl [shown in regular clothes and real hair] who isn't actually red-haired and freckled. Joining me now is the gingers' head spokesperson, Eric Cartman.
CARTMAN
That's right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers are furious that the role of Annie is being minimalized!
REPORTER
What harm do you believe this actress is doing to the true red-haired community?
CARTMAN
The bitch isn't ginger! She's just using makeup to look ginger! And pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do!
GINGERS
Yeah! That's right! [among other things]
[The center's doors open and Annie walks out to cheers and flash bulbs. She waves to everyone.]
CARTMAN
There she is! Get her! [the gingers rush her and start ganging up on her] Die, you stupid bitch!
REPORTER
This is getting pretty ugly, Tom. These gingers are really riled up! If you are a ginger and would like to join The Ginger Separatist Movement, you can attend their first meeting this Friday in the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.
[The Airport Hilton, day, the Sunset Room. One of the older boys in school is speaking.]
OLDER BOY
Okay, welcome, everyone. It's so great to see such a wonderful turnout at the first All-Ginger Pride Conference! [everyone cheers] Now it is my honor to introduce the man who has brought self-respect to gingers, Eric Cartman!
CARTMAN
[comes in pumped up like a televangelist to his own theme music] Thanks Jody! Gingers, how are we feelin'? [the redhead cheer] Can I get a Red Power?
GINGERS
Red Power!
CARTMAN
Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us. And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is!
GINGERS
Yeah!!
CARTMAN
Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are! [all the redheads cheer wildly]
GARY NELSON
Hello there! Gary Nelson with Hilton Guest Relations. Just making sure you guys have everything you need. [long silence]
CARTMAN
We're fine, thanks.
GARY NELSON
Need any buffet items restocked? Everyone okay on coffee?
CARTMAN
We're fine!
GARY NELSON
Great. Oh, and hey guys, just wanted to say thanks for choosing the Airport Hilton for your conference.
CARTMAN
You're welcome!! Now leave us alone!! [Gary closes the door] My fellow gingers! I envision a world in which there IS no hate! A world where everyone is ginger! And so, we must gather together every child who is NOT ginger, and exterminate them!
GINGER 1
Huh
GINGER 2
What
GINGER 3
Ex-terminate?
CARTMAN
Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in! Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are you with me?!
GINGERS
Huzzah! Huzzah!
[Night time. Kyle and Kenny knock on Stan's front door, and he answers. He rubs his eyes and remains half-asleep.]
KYLE
Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's and change him back into a non-ginger!
STAN
Huh? Why?
KYLE
Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger, it'll be hysterical!
KENNY
(Hehe, yeah. Hehe)
KYLE
Are you in?
STAN
... totally.
[The sidewalk. The three boys walk towards Cartman's house.]
STAN
You know, Cartman is an uncaring, bigoted intolerant asshole, but I have to admit, I had my own prejudice about gingers. I think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another, and we shouldn't be threatened by those differences. I mean, Cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night.
KENNY
(Hehe, yeah, heh) [Stan stops and gasps. The other two stop. Before them stand at least five redheads]
KYLE
Oh... hey there. [long silence]
STAN
You guys... need... anything? [long silence]
KYLE
Let's just... let's just walk this way. [starts to cross the street, Stan and Kenny follow him, but they all see more gingers crawl out of the bushes across the street]
STAN
More ginger kids. Um, meh-maybe we should just go home.
KYLE
Yeah, good idea. [the boys go back the way the came. Gingers converge upon them, and they begin to run]
STAN
The hell do they want? [A redhead comes in from the right side and snatches Kenny away]
KENNY
(AH!)
KYLE
Kenny!
STAN
Run, dude, run!!
[Clyde's room, night. Clyde is sleeping, but some noise wakes him up. Three raps are heard on the window and he sits up to see who it is.]
CLYDE
[gathers his covers around him] Uh... Gi... ginger kids! AAAAAH! [his parents leave their room]
MOM
Clyde? What is it, honey? [they go to his room and open his door, and are horrified. Before them is his window, wiiide open, and his empty bed. The wind howls outside]
[Another house, night. A boy goes to his bathroom to brush his teeth. He pulls the toothpaste out of the medicine cabinet and closes the door, only to find some smiling gingers waiting for him.]
BOY
Aaah! [turns around] Ginger kids! Nooo! [a ginger girl grabs a hold of him]
[Another house. A boy opens the front door and his little sister stands behind him.]
GINGER GIRL
Laaa la, laaa lala.
GIRL
What is it?
GINGER GIRL
laaa lala.
BOY
It's a... little ginger girl.
GINGER GIRL
laaa la.
GIRL
Shut the door!
GINGER GIRL
Laaa la, laaa lala, laaa la.
KIDS
AAAAAH! [they panic and run away. The boy runs into the banister and falls down. The girl trips over him]
BOY
Ow!
GINGER GIRL
[reaches the entrance] Laaa la, laaa lala.
[Another house. A boy is showering before he goes to bed. He rinses off, closes the faucet, opens the curtain, and screams. He cowers in the bathtub as gingers close in on him.]
[The sidewalk. Two kids are walking alone when more redheads appear and converge on them.]
[An abandoned barn.]
KYLE
In there! Let's go! [he and Stan run into it and close the doors. They run to a long log and lift it up] Get this jamb on the door! [they throw the jamb into place. Redheads try to wrestle the roads open but can't budge it. A window nearby breaks open and gingers start to crawl in through it. More windows break open, then the walls and doors start falling apart as the gingers barge in. Another ginger looks in from the roof and drops down to join the others. They grab Stan and Kyle, who scream one last time]
[The Airport Hilton, day, the Sunset Room. Stan, Kyle, and a few non-ginger kids are in a cage.]
STAN
Kyle. Kyle, wake up.
KYLE
[wakes up] Huh. Whaaa? [stands up] Where are we? [walks to the cage wall and looks out. The Sunset Room is dark and red from the glow of a lava cauldron. There are cages all over the place, even hanging from the ceiling. The ginger kids stand around the cauldron]
STAN
I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.
CARTMAN
My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us! [the gingers stomp and cheer]
STAN
Cartman?
KYLE
Oh Jesus, I should have known!
CARTMAN
What we begin here, we will take worldwide, until the blood of every non-ginger child has been spilled! [more stomping and cheering]
GARY NELSON
You guys got everything you need in here? Need more coffee, buffet items?
CARTMAN
No, we're fine! Thank you!
GARY NELSON
How about lava? You got enough lava?
CARTMAN
Yes! We're good!
GARY NELSON
Okay. Hey, thanks for choosin' the Airport Hilton, guys.
CARTMAN
You're welcome, now leave us alone!! [Gary leaves and closes the door] Now! Let the extermination begin! [more stomping and cheering] We will start... with the daywalker!
GINGERS
Daywalker! [The cage door opens and Kyle, handcuffed, is hauled out by two redheads and escorted to Cartman] Throw him in!
KYLE
Cartman! I need to tell you something!
CARTMAN
Go on then! Say your last words!
KYLE
Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!
CARTMAN
Okay fine, let him speak! [the redheads let Kyle go, and Kyle falls on his face] Then we kill every non-ginger here! [Kyle gets up, walks over to Cartman, and whispers in his ear. Cartman's anger vanishes, then surprise appears] You... you what? [Kyle repeats himself. Cartman looks around a bit fearfully, then touches his face all over and grits his teeth]
GINGER BOY
Come on, let's fulfill the plan! All non-gingers must die!
GINGERS
Yeah!
CARTMAN
[now hesitant] Right, the plan. Um... Oh. Oh, my God, you guys! Uh, I just realized something. [backpedals] We shouldn't be doing this. Ah I mean, look at us. [throws away his staff] What have we become?
GINGERS
Huh? What?
CARTMAN
D-don't you see? If we go and exterminate everyone who isn't ginger, then we're no better than they were for thinking less of us. Maybe we all have to learn to live... together.
GINGER BOY 2
But... you just said everyone who isn't ginger must die.
CARTMAN
Right, but... but I've learned that we can't judge people based on what they look like.
GINGER BOY 2
But you just said they should all die fifteen seconds ago.
CARTMAN
See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we've got to live and let live. [the gingers look at him, stunned]
GINGER BOY
[long beat, then] What did that kid in the green hat tell you?
CARTMAN
... Huh?
GINGER BOY
That kid right there. What did he just tell you?
CARTMAN
Ss. Who? Oh him? Oh. No, that was just... Tha-that was about something else, totally unrelated.
GINGER BOY
You wanted to kill everyone who wasn't ginger, then that kid in the green hat told you something, and now you don't wanna do it all of a sudden. What did he tell you?
CARTMAN
No, he was just telling me about something funny that happened at school yesterday. Um, oh, but anyway, ohhh! Oh wow, I can't believe how great it feels to finally love my fellow man, huh? Isn't this great you guys? We sure have been throgh a lot! But in the end, we all learned it's best to get along.
Hand in hand, we can live together. Ginger or not, we're all the same.
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause it's lame. Come on, guys!
Hand in hand, we can live together.
GINGERS
[unsure] Ginger or not, it's all the same.
CARTMAN
That's it! You've got it!
CARTMAN AND THE GINGERS
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame.

CARTMAN
The same, you and I!
GINGERS

Yes, but I'm not going to die. [steps forth] That's why we gotta get along, people!
GINGERS
Hand in hand, we can live together. We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.

synopsis:Scientologists converge on Stan's house after he is identified as the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. One A-lister locks himself in the closet and refuses to come out, after Stan criticizes his "talent."

script:Trapped in the Closet

[South Park, day, a mini-mall. Komik Factory is shown. The boys walk out the front doors.]
KYLE
Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer.
CARTMAN
Aw man, I got a crappy AJ Feeley again!
KYLE
How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan?
STAN
I can't spend any money. I'm saving up for that bike I want.
CARTMAN
HA! Saving money, duhhh! [turns left and walks. The others follow. Kenny moves the card in his left hand to his right hand]
KYLE
So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible.
CARTMAN
Hey, I know! Let's go play laser tag at FunPlex.
KENNY
(Hey yeah!)
STAN
[stops] No, I don't wanna spend any money, you guys. [the others stop and he catches up] Let's just do something fun that's free.
CARTMAN
Stan, don't you know the first law of physics? Anything that's fun costs at least eight dollars.
KYLE
Yeah dude, nothing fun is free.
STAN
Well I can't spend any money.
CARTMAN
Okay, be a Jew. We're gonna go play laser tag. [he, Kenny and Kyle walk off]
KYLE
Yeah. See ya. [Stan moves on down the sidewalk and passes a Scientology center. In front are a table with two people seated behind it, waiting for prospects]
WOMAN
Hello, would you like to take a personality test? It's fun and it's free.
STAN
[stops, thinks, and looks] Excuse me?
WOMAN
We're doing free personality tests today.
STAN
Uh what do I have to do?
WOMAN
Have you heard of Scientology? It's all based on the book, Dianetics. A lot of really cool people are Scientologists, like Tom Cruise and John Travolta. Why don't you come on in and we'll get your fun free personality test started. [leads him in and walks by one closed door after another] Let's just find an empty room here, lots of people getting free tests today. [finds an open door and looks in] Hey Brian.
BRIAN
[seated at his desk, rises and walks to the door] Hey Kelly. How's it going?
KELLY
Great! I want you to meet my new friend, Stan.
BRIAN
Hey there! How are you?
STAN
Fine.
KELLY
Brian's gonna give you your personality test and then let you know some things about Scientology.
BRIAN
Good times, good times!
STAN
L-look, is this a religion? Because my family is like, Catholic or something.
BRIAN
Ho, that's not a problem at all. Scientology is more like an alternative to psychology than a religion.
STAN
Then how come that sign says "Church of Scientology"?
BRIAN
Oho, that's just this thing: What's the Denver Broncos' record now? Six and two?
STAN
Seven and two.
BRIAN
Wow! That's great! All right, come on in and take a seat; we're gonna have some fun! [he and Stam enter the room and he changes the sign on his door so it says "Test In Progress." Inside, Brian and Stan take their seats] All right now, I'm just gonna ask you a few questions. Just answer these questions as truthfully as you can, alright? [picks up a notepad and starts noting Stan's answers] Okay. Number 1: Do you ever make remarks... which you later regret?
STAN
Uhhh, sh-sure?
BRIAN
Uh huh. Would you rather give orders... than take them?
STAN
Yeah?
BRIAN
Do you ever whistle... just for the fun of it. [The wall clock reads 11:35, then 12:20, and the camera pans down to Brian and Stan.] Okay, and finally, does life sometimes feel vague and confusing to you?
STAN
Yes.
BRIAN
Okay, Stan. Well, that's it. That's the end of the personality test.
STAN
So how did I do?
BRIAN
Well, I hate to tell you this, Stan, but... you are one messed-up kid.
STAN
...Huh??
BRIAN
Yeah, I'm afraid that you are completely miserable and totally depressed.
STAN
I am?? I didn't know that!
BRIAN
Well there's certainly no question that you are a perfect candidate for Scientology. I think it can really make you happy again.
STAN
What what do I do?
BRIAN
It's very simple. We just need two hundred and forty dollars.
[Stan's house, dinnertime. Grandpa is still around, at the head of the table. Randy and Shelly are seated to Grandpa's right, Stan and Sharon are seated to Grandpa's left. Stan rests his head on his left arm.]
SHARON
Stanley, you haven't touched your food. What's the matter with you?
STAN
I'm totally depressed.
SHARON
What? Why?
STAN
I don't know.
SHARON
Well how long have you been feeling this way?
STAN
I'm not sure. But... I need two hundred and forty dollars.
RANDY
Two hundred and forty dollars?! What'd you do, break something?!
STAN
No, I found a self-help program that can cure me.
RANDY
Oh Jesus, the answer is no, Stanley.
STAN
But I'm completely miserable and these people can help!
SHARON
Stanley, I didn't know you were miserable.
STAN
Neither did I!
RANDY
Stanley, do you have any concept of money at all? Money doesn't grow on trees, you know?
STAN
Don't you care that I'm depressed?! What if I become suicidal, or, or become an alcoholic like Grandpa??
MARVIN
Huh?
RANDY
Well, if you really think your life is so bad, Stan, why don't you take what you have out of your bicycle savings?!
STAN
[looking real sad] ...well but... but that's my money.
RANDY
Yeah, well just like the rest of us, you have to make choices with your money. Do you want a bike, or do you not want to be depressed?
[The Scientology Center, Sunday. Stan returns.]
KELLY
Michelle, our friend Stan wants to have auditing.
MICHELLE
Oho good, you're going to be so happy.
STAN
I hope so.
KELLY
It's the beginning of a whole new life for you, Stan. See ya afterwards.
MICHELLE
Great, so do you have the two hundred and forty dollars. [Stan pulls out the bills and hands them over to Michelle] Perfect! We're on our way! [puts the money in a secure drawer and escorts Stan...] Come on over here and I'll fill you in on how the Church of Scientology works. [...down a hallway] You see, Stan, Scientology was founded by a great man named L. Ron Hubbard. [a portrait of him is shown] Mr. Hubbard discovered that negative emotions are actually caused by things called "body thetans."
STAN
Really?
MICHELLE
Yes! And being the genius that he was, Mr. Hubbard invented a way to get rid of those bad thetans. [stops by a picture of a portable blue machine with two cylindrical grips plugged into the back] This is called an E-meter. It's the main tool of Scientology. You just grab a hold of these handles as I talk you through past experiences in your life. I'll be taking readings here, and we'll be able to determine your thetan levels.
STAN
Thetan levels...
MICHELLE
Come on in the auditing room and I'll show you how it works. [moments later they are in the auditing room. They walk by a row of booths, each with a tester and a testee] All these people are just like you, Stan, auditing with E-meters to get rid of their negative emotions. [she reaches an empty booth and sits behind the controls as Stan takes his seat] All right, Stan, I want you to just relax and take hold of the E-meter handles. [Stan grabs them and draws them close]
STAN
So, this is gonna make me happy?
MICHELLE
Just take a few deep breaths, and I'll just get a base reading of your thetan levels. [Stan takes a deep breath and exhales, not quite sure why, then Michelle turns on the machine to take the reading. It reaches a 9.15] Huh, that's, that's strange.
STAN
What?
MICHELLE
Somethin-, [soft giggle] something's wrong. Brian, could you come over here a second?
BRIAN
[appears next to her] Yep- Oh hey there, Greg!
STAN
Stan.
MICHELLE
Will you... look at his thetan levels?
BRIAN
Huh, well. We'll get another E-meter - this one's obviously broken. Sorry about this, Greg.
[The lobby. Mr. Mackey has entered to take his own personality test.]
RECRUITER
And so we just try to analyze your personality, and if it seems like you need some help, then you can have an audit counseling for a nominal fee.
MR. MACKEY
Well, that sounds pretty reasonable, m'kay. [Brian comes out of the auditing room nervously]
BRIAN
Mike, I need to talk to you!
MIKE
Excuse me, sir, I'll be right back. [he and Brian go into the hallway] Are you all right? You're sweating!
BRIAN
[shows him Stan's E-meter results] Take a look at this.
MIKE
[looks] What is it?
BRIAN
The E-meter results from the little boy in Room D
MIKE
[leafing through the results] This... this can't be right. [scans faster]
BRIAN
We ran the tests four times! We used four different E-meters!
MIKE
Fax these results to the head office in Los Angeles. The President has to see thus right away. Go! [slaps Brian across the back] Now! [Brian leaves]
[L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology Celebrity Center, day.]
WOMAN
The boy is from a small mountain town in Colorado, sir.
MAN
Sir, how can it be that a first timer scores that kind of thetan level?? He registered OT9! I'm only OT7 and I've been in the church all my life!
PRESIDENT
I've waited... forty-two years... for this day.
MAN
Sir?
PRESIDENT
Don't you all see what this means? There was only one person who EVER registered OT9 in the history of our church. [looks at something. The others gather to look with him. They look at a framed portrait of L. Ron Hubbard] L. Ron Hubbard said he had lived past lives. That when he died his thetan would show itself again. Our prophet has returned. [removes Stan's picture from the report and holds it up against the portrait.]
[The Marsh house, kitchen, night.]
SHARON
Uh, Stanley, take the garbage out before you go to bed.
STAN
I took out the garbage yesterday.
RANDY
Right now, Stan!
STAN
Aagh! [hauls the garbage bag out of the garbage can and drags it across the living room] Stupid dumb garbage! [opens the front door and steps out.]
[The Marsh house, outside, night.]
MAN 2
[offscreen] There he is! [Stan's anger changes to surprise]
MAN 3
Thank you for returning!
MAN 4
He's wonderful. [cries] He's wonderful.
RANDY
[the rest of the family joins Stan at the door] Stan! What the hell did you do?!
STAN
I don't know! [a Scientology helicopter lands on the lawn and some officials open the door for the church's president, who exits, walks over to Stan, and kneels down]
PRESIDENT
Hello young man. I'm the head of Scientology. It is... [with great emotion, bows his head] a great honor to meet you!
[The Marsh living room. The officials and the family have entered.]
RANDY
All right, what the hell is going on here?!
PRESIDENT
We've been looking for your son for a long time, Mr. Marsh. He is the reincarnation of our church's most famous prophet.
SHARON
Wwhat??
PRESIDENT
Scientologists the world over are simply rejoicing at his second coming.
RANDY
Look, we don't want our son to join your group, okay?
PRESIDENT
We're not asking him to join us, we're asking him... to lead us.
SHELLY
Oh my God, it's John Travolta! [Sharon and Randy go to investigate]
JOHN TRAVOLTA
[using an odd voice as he makes his way through the crowd] Is this where he lives? Is this where L. Ron Hubbard is? Oh my god!
PRESIDENT
Yes, John Travolta and Tom Cruise are big Scientologists. Do you believe me nooow? [kneels next to Stan] Young man, I know you don't remember it,but... your name was L. Ron Hubbard. You revealed the secret that began the whole Church of Scientology.
RANDY
Okay, Stan, it's late, go up to your room and get ready for bed! Let Mommy and Daddy handle this. [Stan walks up the stairs, not sure what's going on]
STAN
[enters his room] Jesus Christ...
CRUISE
[suddenly appears in his room] L. Ron? [runs up and kneels before Stan] L. Ron! It really is you! [puts his hands over his heart] Oh, this is the greatest day of my life!
STAN
Aw dude, I need to go to bed.
CRUISE
Don't you understand, L. Ron? It's me! Tom Cruise!
STAN
Yeah, I know who you are.
CRUISE
Ha-haven't I done well, L. Ron? Haven't you enjoyed my acting? Which film did you like best?
STAN
Well-h. I mean, you're not... you're not like as good as Leonardo DiCaprio, but you're okay, I guess.
CRUISE
...What?
STAN
I mean, you're not Gene Hackman or that guy who played Napoleon Dynamite, but you're okay.
CRUISE
[buries his face in his hands] I'm nothing. [lifts his head again] I'm a failure in the eyes of the Prophet! AAAH! [runs into Stan's closet and closes the door]
STAN
Hey! [walks over to the closet] Dude, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
CRUISE
Go away!
STAN
Dude, this is my room!
CRUISE
Go away, I said!
STAN
[walks out into the hall] Dad! Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet!
RANDY
What?!
STAN
Tom Cruise locked himself in my closet and he won't come out. [Randy enters the room and tries to open the closet door, then knocks. Stan looks on]
RANDY
Mr. Cruise? Mr. Cruise, come out of the closet.
CRUISE
No!
RANDY
Come on, Mr. Cruise, this is ridiculous.
CRUISE
I'm never coming out!
RANDY
[to Stan] What did you say to him?
STAN
I just told him I thought the Napoleon Dynamite guy is a better actor than he is.
RANDY
Oh boy. [knocks on the door again] Mr. Cruise, you can't just stay in the closet, alright? You need to come out.
SHARON
What's going on?
RANDY
Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.
SHARON
What??
CRUISE
Just leave me alone!
RANDY
Well, we CAN'T leave you alone because YOU won't come out of the closet!
[Channel 4 Network News - South Park Evening News.]
CHRIS
It's been four hours now, and Tom Cruise still will not come out of the closet. Hundreds of onlookers here have gathered here in hopes that the celebrity will finally give in.
SERGEANT
Tom Cruise, this is Park County police! Please come out of the closet. [the house is shown] Everybody here just wants you to come out of the closet, Tom. [someone takes a picture. The house is shown again] Nobody's gonna be mad, everything's gonna be all right. Just come out of the closet.
CHRIS
We're still not exactly sure why Tom Cruise is in the closet, but I'm being joined now by famous singer/songwriter R. Kelly.
R. KELLY
Well I was just standing here, and Tom Cruise locked himself in the closet I asked myself why won't Tom Cruise just come out the closet? Nobody has no answers, and so I pull out my gun! [The crowd screams and run] Tell me why Tom Cruise in the closet or else I am gonna shoot someone!
[Stan's house, kitchen. The church leaders talk to.]
PRESIDENT
Please, understand, we just want what is best for your son. The reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard must be taken care of. He had many enemies.
RANDY
Wasn't L. Ron Hubbard a science-fiction writer?
PRESIDENT
Yes. But he was also a prophet... who knew the secret truth about the nature of life.
SHARON
This is just too much.
PRESIDENT
We want to reveal to Stan the great secret of life behind our church. The safely-guarded Scientology doctrine. Please, your son deserves to be enlightened.
RANDY
Stan, do you want to hear the great secret doctrine of life behind Scientology?
STAN
Sure.
RANDY
All right, go ahead and tell him.
PRESIDENT
Would you excuse us, please? This is highly classified church information.
RANDY
Aw rats. [he and Sharon leave]
PRESIDENT
Usually, to hear the secret doctrine, you have to be in the church for several years, Stan. [leans in] Are you ready to hear the truth?
STAN
I, I guess.
PRESIDENT
You see, Stan, there is a reason for people feeling sad and depressed. [leans in] An alien reason. It all began 75 million years ago. Back then there was a galactinc federation of planets which was ruled over by the evil Lord Xenu.
XENU
Ho ho ho ho ho ho.
PRESIDENT
Xenu thought his galaxy was overpopulated, [Xenu gives his orders] and so he rounded up countless aliens from all different planets, [the roundup is shown] and then had those aliens frozen. [one by one, the aliens are frozen]
XENU
[laughing over his plan] Wa ha ha ha!
PRESIDENT
The frozen alien bodies were loaded onto Xenu's galactic cruisers, which looked like DC-8s, except with rocket engines. The cruisers then took the frozen alien bodies to our planet, to Earth, and dumped them into the volcanoes of Hawaii. [a shot of the frozen aliens encased in ice being dropped from the orange cruisers] The aliens were no longer frozen, they were dead. The souls of those aliens, however, lived on, and all floated up towards the sky. But the evil Lord Xenu had prepared for this.
XENU
Wa ha ha ha!
PRESIDENT
Xenu didn't want their souls to return! And so he built giant soul-catchers in the sky! [the soul-catchers are shown] The souls were taken to a huge soul brain-washing facility, which Xenu had ALSO built on Earth. [the souls are watching a movie screen with 3D glasses] There the souls were forced to watch days of brainwashing material [Egyptian gods, Jesus carrying the Cross, and a bronze Buddha statue are shown] which tricked them into believing a false reality. Xenu then released the alien souls, which roamed the earth aimlessly in a fog of confusion. At the dawn of man, the souls finally found bodies which they can grab onto. They attached themselves to all mankind, which still to this day causes all our fears, our confusions, and our problems. [Stan looks at the president, a bit awed] L. Ron Hubbard did an amazing thing telling the world this incredible truth. Now all we're asking you to do... [hands Stan a pen and some paper] is pick up where he left off.
STAN
But I don't know any of this stuff.
PRESIDENT
Neither did L. Ron when he started. He said he just closed his eyes, and wrote down whatever came to mind. You can do the same. Just let it flow.
STAN
Okay, I'll try. I just wish I could write in my room, but Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.
PRESIDENT
I know. We've sent Nicole Kidman up there to see if she can help.
[Stan's bedroom. The sergeant, a photographer, the Marshes, and a few other people wait by the bedroom door.]
NICOLE
[knocks on the closet door] Tom? Tom, It's Nicole.
CRUISE
Ah hi Nicole.
NICOLE
Tom, don't you think this has gone on long enough? It's time for you to come out of the closet.
CRUISE
...I'm not, I'm not in the closet.
NICOLE
Yes you are, Tom. And you need to just end this and come out. [silence] I'm not gonna think any differently of you. Katie's not gonna think any differently of you. You don't need to be in that closet anymore, Tom.
CRUISE
I'm not in here, though.
NICOLE
Yes, you are.
CRUISE
I'm not, ...I'm not in the closet.
NICOLE
Then how am I talking to you, Tom? [silence] Tom, you can't hide forever just because the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard doesn't like your acting. Come out of the closet, Tom. You're not fooling anyone.
CRUISE
I'm, I'm not, I'm not in here.
[Stan's house, kitchen. Stan is at the breakfast table writing and rewriting. Wads of paper litter the table.]
STAN
[gets an idea] Yeah, yeah!
KYLE
Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies.
STAN
I can't. I'm writing a new sacred doctrine for my church.
KYLE
Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into.
STAN
Cult? Scientology isn't a cult, Kyle. I've read all this stuff and it's based on fact.
KYLE
Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction writer. He lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times.
STAN
I did not! Those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret truth.
KYLE
What secret truth??
STAN
I can't tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling! All I know is that I was depressed before, and now I found meaning!
KYLE
I didn't know you were depressed.
STAN
Neither did I! But now, if you guys can't accept this great thing I belong to, then I suppose we're no longer friends! [Kyle and Kenny leave]
CARTMAN
Stan, I just want you to know that I still hate Kyle more than you. [leaves]
[Stan's house, later, outside shot. Upstairs, John Travolta has joined the effort to get Cruise out of the closet.]
TRAVOLTA
Tom! Hey Tom, it's John Travolta.
CRUISE
Oh hey John.
TRAVOLTA
Tom, you've gotta come out of the closet. Oh my God.
CRUISE
L. Ron Hubbard doesn't think I'm a great actor.
TRAVOLTA
Mm-maybe you took what he said out of context. Okay, 's like, if you don't come out, can I at least come in and talk to you?
CRUISE
Oh... Okay, but no tricks.
TRAVOLTA
No tricks. [gives the group standing out in the hall a thumbs-up. The door opens and John goes into the closet.] Hey, it's really nice n here.
CRUISE
Yeah, see?
TRAVOLTA
I feel really safe. Oh my god.
RANDY
[knocks] Hello? [tries to force the door open] Hey, come out of there!
[Stan's house, outside shot.]
CHRIS
Tom, it now appears that John Travolta is also in the closet, and he refuses to come out. Here with more details once again, is R. Kelly.
R. KELLY
I was just standing here. Tom Cruise locked himself in the closet Then John Travolta come and now, John Travolta in the closet too. Please Tom Cruise and John Travolta come out the closet! But then I calm myself down, and I pull out my gun! [The crowd screams again and runs away]
CHRIS
Oh geez, here we go with the gun again.
R. KELLY
[Grabs a lady and holds her at gunpoint] If Tom Cruise and John Travolta don't come out of the closet I'm gonna cap this bitch!
[Stan's house, kitchen. The president of the church is reviewing Stan's work.]
PRESIDENT
Yes... Yes, oh this is great, Stan!
STAN
I wrote that um, our followers shouldn't fly in DC-8s anymore because they're too much like Xenu's evil cruisers.
PRESIDENT
Yes, of course! So wonderful!
STAN
And I wrote that the evil Lord Xenu was recently broken out of galactic jail.
PRESIDENT
Yes, of course!
STAN
And best of all, I wrote that all the Scientologists should no longer have to pay money to belong.
PRESIDENT
[his joy disappears] What?
STAN
I I realize that to really be a church, we can't charge people for help.
PRESIDENT
[turns around] What are you, stupid?! Then how do we make money from those people?!
STAN
... Well, it's not about the money, it's about the message, right?
PRESIDENT
Wait a minute, whoa, whoa! You don't actually believe this crap, do you?? Dummy! Brainwashed alien souls?? E-meters and thetan levels?? Those people out there buy that crap and I thought YOU were smart enough to see what was really going on!
STAN
But you said that there were-
PRESIDENT
What's better than telling people a stupid story and having them believe you?! [Stan draws a blank] Having them PAY you for it, stupid!
STAN
But then, why me? Why do you need me to write something so badly?
PRESIDENT
Because if those people all think you're the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, then they'll all buy your new writings, and you and I together will make three million dollars!
STAN
Three million dollars?
PRESIDENT
That's how the scam works! But this is a scam on a global scale! Do you fucking get me now?! [leans in a bit]
STAN
Yeah. Yeah, I get you.
PRESIDENT
Then keep writing, L. Ron! Your people are waiting.
[Stan's house, outside. A news brief.]
CHRIS
Breaking news here in South Park. Tom Cruise and John Travolta still... will not come out of the closet. Park County police have decided to try a new method.
[Stan's room. R. Kelly is there awaiting instructions. The police signal him towards the closet.]
R. KELLY
Now I've been asked to come up here, get you both out of the closet Man, this is some crazy shit. Why won't you both just come out the closet? And they said...
CRUISE, TRAVOLTA
We're not comin' out the closet, so you can just go away.
R. KELLY
But everyone wants you out the closet.
CRUISE, TRAVOLTA
That doesn't matter 'cause we're gonna stay.
R. KELLY
Now I'm startin' to get angry, so I pull out my gun! [The group screams and runs away] I'm gonna give you count of three to open this closet door. One, I'm gonna shoot you both. Two, I'm gonna cap some bitch. Three... [Closet door opens. R. Kelly walks up to the closet door slowly. Then he goes inside, the closet door closes.] Now I'm in the closet. Now I'm in the closet too.
[Stan's house, the next day.]
PRESIDENT
My fellow Scientologists! Our prophet has finished his new doctrine, and will now read some passages before making it available to you all for a nominal fee. [the crowd cheers] I give you... the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard! [two officials bow and then spread roses before Stan's feet as he walks down a red carpet towards a marble stand with "SCIENTOLOGY" engraved along the front. Stan is dressed in toga and laurel. The crowd cheers wildly]
STAN
Uh, thanks. So, first of all, I've written that the brainwashed alien ghosts are actually from a galaxy called Nubanon.
CROWD
Ohhhh.
MAN
Nubanon.
STAN
And uh, oh, [hopeful faces look back at him] ...I ...I can't do this.
PRESIDENT
Huh, what?
STAN
Look, everybody, we're all looking for answer, you know. We all want to understand who we are and where we come from, but... sometimes we want to know the answers so badly that we... believe just about anything.
MAN 2
Huh?
WOMAN
What?
STAN
[takes off his laurel] I'm not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. And... Scientology is just a big fat global scam.
BRIAN
Oh! We are gonna sue you!
STAN
What??
PRESIDENT
Yeah, you think you can say our religion is a lie?! We'll sue you, buddy!
STAN
YOU told me it was a lie!
PRESIDENT
Ho, now you're puttin' words in MY mouth! You are so sued!
MAN 3
You can't make fun of Scientology, kid! We are gonna sue your ass AND your balls!
CROWD
Yeah, that's right!
PRESIDENT
How dare you mock our faith, you little punk?! You'll be hearing from our lawyers tomorrow!
CHRIS
We've just had an incredible development here, Mitch. Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and R. Kelly, have all come out of the closet! [The three of them come out the front door and Cruise releases R. Kelly, who moves off and out of view.]
CRUISE
[approaches Stan] So you're NOT the prophet, huh?! You made me look stupid! I'm gonna sue you too!
STAN
Well fine! Go ahead and sue me!
CRUISE
I will! I'll sue you in England!
PRESIDENT
You are so sued, kid!
STAN
Well go on, then! Sue me!
PRESIDENT
We're going to!
STAN
Okay, good! Do it! I'm not scared of you! Sue me!

And now, Jambu is going to going to give you all a big wave! [the whale rolls to the right and smacks one of its fins on the water, which splashes onto the audience. The crowd ooos and ahhs. A wave of water hits the boys, who are sitting in the front row.]
CARTMAN
I'm all wet! Sweet!
KYLE
Dude, Jambu is the best! [Jambu returns and takes a quick dive towards the bottom of its tank.]
BRIAN
Now get ready for Jambu's next trick. [Jambu leaps up into the air, performs a somersault, and strikes the water with its fluke, again sending water onto the boys]
CARTMAN
Haha! I'm totally wet! This is awesome!!
BRIAN
[shown as a brunet, with long sideburns] How about that, folks! A full body flip! And now, Kelly's gonna show us how she makes Jambu do his tricks. [a blonde woman in a wet suit steps forward, kneels down by the edge of the small dock she's on, and strikes the water three times with her hand] When Kelly slaps her hand three times, Jambu comes to her. Jambu will stay and wait until Kelly gives him a command. [she signals for him to go forward, and she dives in after him] Oh, what trick are we gonna see? Get those cameras ready! [Kelly dives and gets into position. Jambu circles the tank, then returns and pops up out of the water with Kelly on his nose. She then waves her arms signaling she's fine.] That's Kelly riding on Jambu's nose! [aside, to his partner Mike in the booth] I wish Kelly would ride on my nose. [they both laugh. Jambu drops a bit and Kelly dives off his nose. Jambu splashes the crown once more.]
CARTMAN
Yes! Yeehehehes! [Jambu returns with Kelly on his nose as if she were a hood ornament]
BRIAN
We hope you enjoyed Jambu's orca show, and enjoy the rest of your day at Denver's Sea Park! [clicks off his mic] You bunch of retards. [Mike laughs. Everyone begins to clear the small stadium]
STAN
[reading the park map] Okay, where to next?
CARTMAN
I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30.
KYLE
Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.
CARTMAN
Why?
KYLE
Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him.
CARTMAN
Kyle, the show is over! The whale isn't gonna splash us any more, so who cares?
STAN
Let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show.
CARTMAN
Killer. [the boys turn and leave]
KYLE
I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more.
CARTMAN
Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine. [turns to catch up with Stan and Kenny. Kyle walks around the tank]
KYLE
Jambu? Jambu? [taps the glass wall four times. Jambu dives and floats up facing Kyle] Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu.
JAMBU
Hello, little boy. [Kyle is awed that the whale could talk] Do you like my flippers?
KYLE
[a little scared, looks around] Who said that?
JAMBU
I did.
KYLE
No way!
JAMBU
This is very exciting! Usually when I talk, nobody can hear me. Where are you from?
KYLE
[timidly] South Park.
JAMBU
It sure is nice to have somebody to talk to. Can't we talk more? Please?
KYLE
What do you wanna talk about?
JAMBU
Let's talk about rocket ships.
KYLE
Rocket ships?
JAMBU
[it's actually Brian, still in his booth] Yeah. I love rockets, but I can't see them 'cause I'm stuck in this tank. [he and Mike both laugh, then he shushes Mike and returns to the mic]. You know, someday, I wish that I could go up in space in a rocket ship.
KYLE
Why? Aren't you happy here?
JAMBU
I try to be, but my wish is to one day blast off in a big rocket ship!
KYLE
This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this! [the two men in the booth are laughing their asses off]
JAMBU
Oh God, it's funny every single time. [Mike continues laughing]
[At another exhibit in the park.]
STINGRAY ANNOUNCER
And for those of you just joining us, this is the stingray tank. Stingrays are members of the shark family, but they're extremely peaceful creatures. We invite you to gently touch the top of them as they swim by.
CARTMAN
[slapping the water as a stingray approaches] Heh! Come on, stingray! [it speeds away. Another one approaches] Splash me! Ha! Hey, splash me! [it speeds away as well] Dude, these things are dumb. Let's go!
KYLE
[running up to the other boys] Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this!
STAN
What?
KYLE
Dude, he talks! The orca whale talks!
KENNY
(What the fuck are you talking about?)
KYLE
I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out! [runs back towards Jambu's exhibit, grinning]
[Jambu's exhibit, Orca Ocean.]
KYLE
Jambu! Jambu, I'm back! [hits the wall four times, and Jambu swims around, stopping in front of Kyle again] How are you feeling? [no reply. A few seconds later...] Huhm. Jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships? [Brian is playing a video game, Mike is reading a book - Mother Trucker.] Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here?
CARTMAN
Kyle, Kyle. Let it go, man.
KYLE
He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships!
MIKE
[noticing the commotion] Dude, he's back, he's back! [the two men get ready]
KYLE
Goddammit, say something!
CARTMAN
Come on, guys, let's leave Kyle with his stupid whale.
JAMBU
[Cartman stops in his tracks] Please don't call me stupid.
KYLE
Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before?
JAMBU
I'm sorry. Sometimes I can't talk. It's because I'm very very sick, you see.
KYLE
Sick?
STAN
I don't believe it.
JAMBU
Yes, because I'm not used to the earth atmosphere. You see, my name is actually Willzy-x, and I'm from the moon! [Brian clicks off his mic, Mike laughs, and they both crack up]
MIKE
The moon?
JAMBU
The... that's where all orca whales are from. If I don't get back to the moon, I'm going to die.
CARTMAN
You live on the moon?
JAMBU
I used to. I wish I could return and dance in the moon castle with my wife and three children again.
KYLE
Oh my God...
STAN
Why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park?
JAMBU
I can't tell them, because they're evil communists from the Horsehead Nebula. They want to kill all us zypods, so they keep us in these horrible tanks and make us perform.
KYLE
That's terrible!
MIKE
Dude, dude, the boss is coming!
JAMBU
Uh, uh, sorry boys, I can't talk anymore. I'm too sick. [coughs] Can't. Talk. Any. More. [coughs. The boys stand there, stunned]
[Kyle's house, basement.]
KYLE
Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon,
BUTTERS
Well okay! Let's do it!
KYLE
The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work.
CLYDE
...A whale. Talked to you.
STAN
It's true. The whale talked to all of us. In between shows at his orca tank.
CRAIG
Hey, that whale talked to me too. After everyone left the show I walked up to the glass and he started talking.
KYLE
Weh-well, why didn't you tell anybody?
CRAIG
Well I thought I was crazy. He said my dad was gonna sneak into my room naked one night and beat me up.
KYLE
Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home.
CRAIG
...So it's true.
KYLE
Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us?
TOLKIEN
...What do we do?
KYLE
Stan? [Stan rises and approaches the easel]
STAN
All right. In order to make our plan work, we're going to need the pool from Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards.
[Denver Sea Park, night. The boys arrive at the park. A security guard whistles as he patrols the grounds. Behind him a wheelchair is heard. He pulls out a flashlight and swings it around to highlight everywhere he looks. Timmy and the gang roll by quietly, the pool riding on the skateboards.]
TIMMY
[softly] Timmihhhhh... [The guard looks back just after they pass by, so he just missed them. The boys reach Jambu's tank]
STAN
Craig, Token, get the slings ready. [Cartman, Clyde, and a third boy position a ladder into place. Jambu swims over to see what's happening.]
KYLE
Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here.
[Denver Sea Park, morning. Brian and Mike arrive at work.]
BRIAN
Dude, did you see that episode of Trading Spouses last night? That was insane. Yeah, well ha- whoa. What the hell? [people mill around by Jambu's tank. Police officers move about. The park's owner talks to the guard]
OWNER
How could you not have seen anything?? It's a whale, for Christ's sake!
GUARD
It must have been taken while I was going to the bathroom.
OWNER
Were you in there for three hours?!
GUARD
[hurt, turns away and shields himself] Don't yell at me! [Brianand Mike arrive from the booth]
BRIAN
What happened?
KELLY
Somebody kidnapped Jambu, took him right out of the park.
MIKE
What? How?
GUARD
[raises his head up long enough to say] I DON'T KNOW!
SERGEANT
All right, people, it's obvious we're dealing with a highly intelligent animal-rights group. Those bastards have done stuff like this before.
NELSON
Sir! Sir, we've found a note!
OWNER
A note? Let me see that. [reads the note] We're taking Willzy-x home to the moon. Long live the zypods! [the duo instantly realize who stole Jambu] What the hell does that mean?
SERGEANT
Harris, run a fingerprint on that note! [hands the note to Harris] Nelson! Find out what kind of crayon it was written with. [Nelson leaves] We'll find out who was responsible for this! [the duo know the jig is up]
[The Orca Ocean booth. The duo are inside. Brian paces the floor.]
MIKE
We have to tell them! We know what those boys look like!
BRIAN
We can't tell them, then they're, they're gonna think this is all our fault
MIKE
It IS all our fault!
BRIAN
How were we supposed to know that they were gonna actually do it?!
MIKE
I shouldn't have laughed. All those times we've messed with those kids' heads, I shouldn't have just sat there and laughed.
BRIAN
[grabs him by the arms] Don't you say that! It was funny! It was really funny! We've just... [lets him go] we've just gotta make this right ourselves.
MIKE
How?
BRIAN
We've gotta track down those kids. Before the police do!
[Moscow, day, the Kremlin. Inside, Putin and members of his staff meet in a boardroom.]
PUTIN
Comrades, I'm afraid our situation is dire. The economy is stale and I... Very soon, Mother Russia... will no longer be a country.
AIDE
Sir! Sir, somebody is on telephone! Another rich American wants to fly into space! [silence, then everyone rushes into Putin's office]
PUTIN
Hello? Hello, this is Russian President.
KYLE
Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money.
PUTIN
Yes, we certainly do! [holds his left thumb up for the others to see] What were you looking for?
KYLE
I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away.
PUTIN
The moon. That is quite large trip, but I'm sure we can do it!
KYLE
You can? Awesome!
PUTIN
It sounds like we're in business! We will just need, say, twenty million dollars?
KYLE
[lowers the phone with some disbelief] Twenty... million? [raises the phone to his ear again] Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money.
PUTIN
...What?
KYLE
But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon.
PUTIN
Goddamnit it is prank call again! [his staff leaves] Kiss my ass, George Bush! This is not funny! [slams the phone onto the base]
STAN
What happened?
KYLE
They want twenty million dollars.
CARTMAN
Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon?
CRAIG
That was it? That was you guys' whole plan? Ask the Russians to take the whale to space?
STAN
They were going to do it for that 'N Sync guy.
TWEEK
Oh, Jesus, now what are we gonna do?!
KYLE
All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all.
CLYDE
Well we can't keep the whale out here anymore, people are gonna see it!
[Channel 4 News Break.]
ANCHOR TOM
A beloved performing orca whale has been stolen from the Denver Sea Park. A full investigation is underway, but tracking down the kidnappers is proving to be one WHALE of a problem.
FIELD REPORTER
Thanks, Tom, I'm here at the Denver Sea Park where, believe it or not, dozens of people have come to show support for whoever took the whale. [a crowd of protesters begin to chant]
ALF LEADER
That's right. We are members of the Animal Liberation Front! Whales do not belong in tanks, they belong in the ocean! We applaud whoever did this noble deed! Set the whales free!
PROTESTERS
Set the whales free!
FIELD REPORTER
One thing for certain: something is certainly FISHY here at the Sea Park. Tom?
ANCHOR TOM
Thank, Mitch. It seems that this problem is almost un-BEAR-able. [no one says a word] Let's hope that whale is found.
[Brian and Mike arrive in South Park in a truck with a tank-trailer.]
MIKE
This is so bad, man. How do we even know this is the right town to look in??
BRIAN
Will you relax? Those kids said they were from South Park. We've just gotta go door to door. Do you have the composite sketch we did?
MIKE
[holds up a sheet of paper] Yeah.
BRIAN
Let's go! [they exit the truck and face the houses on one side of the street]
MIKE
Maybe you should start with the houses on the left, a-and I'll take the-
BRIAN
[stops him] Wait a minute. Check that out! [before them is a big pool in a backyard. The fence, which normally blocks off the view from the street, is destroyed, and tracks go through the gap all the way to the pool] Come on! [they move towards the pool and walk up the steps. Brian grabs some crap floating on the surface and shows it to Mike] Oh my good, look!
MIKE
Whale poo.
BRIAN
We're close. We're really close!
MRS. DONOVAN
[the sliding door opens] Can I help you?
BRIAN
[drops the poo quickly and turns to face her] Oh... h-hello ma'am. We're just here to examine your pool.
MRS. DONOVAN
Oh.
MIKE
Have you noticed any whales in your pool at all?
MRS. DONOVAN
No, I don't believe so. But we've been out of town for a couple of days and came back to find the fence broken. Do you think somebody's been using it?
BRIAN
Ma'am, do you recognize any of these boys? [Mike hands her the sketch. She takes it and studies it]
MRS. DONOVAN
The fat one in the middle... kinda looks like Dakota Fanning. Excuse me, gentlemen, I have to get back to the oven. [hands the sketch back to the Mike]
MIKE
[turns around, getting exasperated] We're too late. They've moved on to another town!
BRIAN
We don't know that!
MIKE
If they've moved on, then we have no leads! This is fate, Brian! It's fate! For telling the kids their naked dads were gonna beat them up! For thinking that screwing with kids was funny!
BRIAN
[grabs his Mike and shakes him] It WAS funny!! It was funny, Bob! And it will be funny again, I swear to you! If those boys took the whale out of here, we would have seen them on the road! I'm telling you, we're close. It's going to be funny!
[Kyle's house, day. His parents are at his bedroom door with Ike.]
SHEILA
[knocks three times] Kyle bubbe, we're taking Ike to the new Harry Potter movie. Wanna join us?
KYLE
I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project.
SHEILA
All right. Well, there's pizza in the fridge if you and your friends get hungry. [Gerald goes down the stairs with Ike as she speaks, then she turns away and goes down the stairs]
KYLE
Okay ma, thanks! [behind him is Jambu, and the other boys are keeping him moist]
BUTTERS
Shouldn't we get him back in the water?
CLYDE
Whales are mammals; they don't need water to breathe, dumb-ass.
CARTMAN
Yeah, we just have to keep him wet.
KYLE
Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program? [waits for the answer] How much to take a whale into space? [waits for the answer] Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on. [puts Mr. Sugiyama on hold as he answers another call] Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy?
JIMMY
[with Timmy and Tweek] The Ch-Chinese will take someone to space for t-t-ten million dollars.
KYLE
Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want!
JIMMY
Yeah. We told them that, a-and they told us to go f-fruck ourselves.
KYLE
Damnit! [hangs up without returning to Mr. Sugiyama] Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??
CARTMAN
He hasn't said a word since we brought him here.
KYLE
Yeah... He must be really sick. [walks up to the whale and strokes him] Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico.
CLYDE
Mexico has a space program?
[Mexico. A view of the coast is first seen. Then, in a downtown area, a bus lets Stan and Craig out and leaves. Stan follows the directions on a map, and eventually end up in front of Jose's Ceramica Y Fuentes. A man is sitting by the entrance next to a fountain.]
STAN
Uh, excuse me, we're looking for the Mexican... [enunciates] Aeronautica y Spacia Administra-tio-n?
MAN
Allí. ("There") [points down the road]
STAN
Thanks. [they leave and arrive at MASA - Mexicana Aeronáuti'co y Spacia Administración]
[MASA - Mexicana Aeronáuti'co y Spacia Administración. Within the chain link fence, there are a few buildings, along with abandoned appliances, oil barrels and a gass pump and several men either standing or sitting around and relaxing. One man, Mannuel, is by the entrance and appears to be cleaning a rocket part as Stan and Craig appear.]
STAN
Is this the Mexican space program? [again, neglected beauty, and the place looks quite primitive for a space administration, straight out of the 1950s.]
MANNUEL
Space, sí ("Yes"). Fly [Gestures flying upward with his left hand].
STAN
Does the Mexican space programs have rockets that can go to the moon?
MANNUEL
Claro. Sígueme. ("Sure. Follow me") [sets down the part he was cleaning and goes inside the complex. The boys follow him]
[MASA - Mexicana Aeronáuti'co y Spacia Administración. Inner complex. Along with more garbage and abandoned cars, there are three rockets lined up to be launched. The rockets are near a boat dock.]
MANNUEL
De rocket lunar? ("The space rocket?")
STAN
This rocket will fly to the moon?
MANNUEL
Sí ("Yes"). Fly [Gestures flying upward with his left hand].
STAN
To the moon?
MANNUEL
Sí.
STAN
[enunciates] We want to take something to the moon. How much would that cost?
MAN 2
O-ah... Two hundred.
STAN
Two hundred? Million?
MAN 2
Two hundred... dollars.
STAN
[to Craig] Quick, call Kyle.
[The Broflovski house, day. Sheila is cleaning a lamp table next to the sofa when the doorbell rings. She goes to answer it.]
BRIAN
Eh hello ma'am, uh, the teacher at the school said she recognized this boy to be your son? [Sheila takes the composite sketch and looks at Kyle's image]
SHEILA
Oh yes, that's my bubbe. Kind of a bad drawing though.
BRIAN
Ma'am, we need to talk to your son, please! It's very urgent!
SHEILA
I'm sorry, he just left. He's on his way to Mexico.
BOTH MEN
Mexico??
SHEILA
Yehhs. As part of a school project, he's helping his class to move two donated grand pianos to needy school children in Tijuana. My little bubbe is very caring.
MIKE
Oh my God.
BRIAN
Which highway did they take??
[On the highway during the day, a truck zips along. Kenny, Clyde, Cartman, and Butters ride in the cab with the driver, Kyle is in the trailer with Willzy-x, keeping him moist with damp clothes.]
CARTMAN
Hurry it up, dude, we have a rocket to catch.
KYLE
Hang on, Willzy-x. Hang on, buddy.
[The highway, night. The truck keeps rolling.]
CARTMAN
We have to hurry!
DRIVER
I'm going as fast as I can.
KYLE
Hang on, Willzy-x. We'll in Mexico soon!.
BUTTERS
Oh hamburgers! What is that?? [The Denver Sea Park truck appears before them and blocks their way, so the driver stops. Brian steps out of the Sea Park truck. Mike joins him and they both stand before the Moovit truck until it stops, then they move to the driver's side door]
BRIAN
All right, out of the truck!
CARTMAN
Uh oh.
DRIVER
What the hell is goin' on?!
BRIAN
You're carrying a stolen whale!
DRIVER
Stolen? You kids told me you won that whale at Pizza Hut!
CLYDE
We're busted. [Brian and Mike roll up the trailer and Kyle looks]
KYLE
Huh?
BRIAN
Come on out, kid. [the four other boys walk around Brian and stop]
DRIVER
Look, I didn't know nothin' about this.
BRIAN
Just help us get the whale into our truck and we'll all keep quiet about this.
KYLE
You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you have to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it!
MIKE
Look, kid, we need to tell you a little secret. [a bright light comes on and a police siren sounds. They all turn to see who it is. Two motorcycle cops get off their bikes.]
COP 1
What's goin' on here??
BRIAN
Aw crap.
BUTTERS
Oh, now we're gonna get it.
COP 1
Hey... That's the stolen whale!
COP 2
Everyone down on the ground. Now!
KYLE
No! Please, we have to go!
COP 2
You're not goin' anywhere! You're in a lot of trouble! [the first cop starts making arrests]
KYLE
But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried.
COP 1
We said down on the ground, kid. Move it! [three gunshots come out of nowhere, and everyone turns to see whom it could be now.]
ALF LEADER
Leave those kids alone, you bastards! Animal Liberation Front! [the ALF members growl]
COP 1
Put down that weapon, now!
ALF LEADER
These boys are trying to get that whale home! You're not gonna stop them!
KYLE
All right!!
THE OTHER BOYS
Yes! Wow!
COP 2
That whale belongs to a sea park!
KYLE
It belongs with its family!
ALF MEMBER
That's right!
COP 1
I said drop the gun NOW!
ALF LEADER
Save the whale! [fires her gun and charges. The other ALF members charge and fire as well. Cop 2 is hit and falls. Cop 1 fires back. The boys hide behind the Moovit! truck]
MIKE
Jesus, Oh God! [he's soon riddled with bullet holes and falls over]
ALF MEMBER
Save the whales, motherfucker!
ALF LEADER
[fires a few more rounds over the boys' heads as she positions herself behind them] Where are you taking the whale?
KYLE
Tijuana, Mexico!
ALF LEADER
Of course. Brilliant! Release it in international waters. I'll drive the truck. [she and the boys get into the cab, Kyle stays in the trailer with the whale]
KYLE
You're going home, Willzy-x! [the truck drives away, and Brian crawls over to Mike]
BRIAN
Mike? Mike??
MIKE
[still has enough life in him to cough and say] It... wasn't... funny...
BRIAN
Don't say that, Mike. It was funny. It just wasn't that funny this time. [Mike's head drops] All the other times were still funny, Mike! They were still funny!!
COP 1
[crawls to his bike and grabs a radio] Forty-five to dispatch... Stolen whale... heading to Tijuana... Whaaale to Tijuana!! [falls]
[MASA, night. Workers get the rocket to the moon ready. They connect chains to the body.]
WORKER 1
Conecte la segunda cadena. ["Connect the second chain."]
WORKER 2
No sé si va a llegar. ["I don't know if it'll reach."]
STAN
They're on their way, Manuel. Is the rocket gonna be ready?
MANUEL
Sí ("Yes"). Fly [Gestures flying upward with his left hand].
[The highway, night. The Moovit! truck is now accompanied by an ALF van.]
BUTTERS
Look! The Mexican border!
CLYDE
Oh Jesus, they're here!
[U.S. Customs / Mexico Boarder Checkpoint. The sign reveals that they are in Arizona and about to enter into Mexico. The Park County cops are blocking the checkpoint and have their guns pointed.]
SERGEANT
Hold your positions! [a police helicopter comes down. The owner of the sea park and the orca trainers step down from it, along with the security guard]
OWNER
Aha! We've got them!
ALF LEADER
Hang on, boys.
OWNER
Mary Mother of God! [the Moovit! truck barrels through the helicopter and blockade. Everyone in the way jumps out of the way. The Moovit! truck is now in Mexico]
SERGEANT
[lying face down, points at the truck] Get them!
[MASA, later. The Moovit! truck rolls in.]
KYLE
Willzy-x, I think we're here.
STAN
[to the ALF leader] Back down the ramp! It's all rigged to go!
ALF LEADER
You got it, kid! [makes a quick right, then backs up left and towards the end of the dock]
OWNER
[arriving at MASA with the guard and trainers] Don't let them get that whale in the water! [Kyle rolls open the trailer door]
STAN
Kyle, it's all set to go! [the ALF van rolls in] Just get Willzy-x into the water! [some ALF officers emerge from the van.]
KYLE
Come on, guys! [Craig, Clyde, Kenny, Butters, and Cartman show up. Clyde and Kenny jump up and pull the ramp down]
OWNER
[starts to run in with the guard and trainers] Stop right now!
ALF LEADER
Hurry, boys! We'll take care of them! [The zoo personnel and the ALF face off, with the ALF landing the first blows. Kelly goes down like a statue. At the dock, the boys struggle to move Willzy-x into the water]
KYLE
Hang on. [looks around] Hold on a second. [steps down into the water and addresses Willzy-x] I gues... I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzy-x. [the whale opens his mouth. Kyle begins to tear up] I'm gonna miss you. [Butters and Clyde tear up and look at each other] Hey, don't forget me, okay? I won't forget you. [sniffs a bit, then pets the whale.]
CARTMAN
Oh crap! There's more of them! [police cruisers pour in and officers pour out of them]
KYLE
Get him in the water! [the boys pull Willzy-x once more, with a mighty pull] Goodbye, Willzy-x! [the whale takes to the water and the ALF cheers a job well done]
ALF LEADER
Swim, mighty whale! You're free!
STAN
Okay, Manuel, hit it. [Manuel presses the launch button]
OWNER
[advances with the guard and police] Stop! That is my whale!
ALF LEADER
I'm afraid you're too late! The whale's been set free.
OWNER
No!
ALF LEADER
Now you see that your ways of captivity and exploiting animals will never prevail. [behind her, a rocket rises into launch position] Not as long as there are children like these who still believe in the beauty and magic of freedom. [The park owner, guard, police, and now FBI gawk at her, or at the rocket behind her.] For it is children, with their innocence and their spirit, who know what is truly best for all the world.
[the rocket is now in position. The rocket powers up and now she hears it. She and the ALF turn to see the rocket rise out of its base. Behind it are the chains, attached to a sling below water holding Willzy-x. The chains tighten and lift Willzy-x up and away. The boys grin big.]
ALF LEADER
Oh my God!
KYLE
We did it!
[the boys cheer, congratulate each other, and dance. The Mexican launch crew does so as well. A mariachi band appears out of nowhere for the celebration and plays the Mexican anthem. On the US side of the border, Brian looks up to see the rocket rise into space with Willzy-x trailing along in the sling. He laughs weakly.]
[South Park, night. Manuel has driven the boys back to town in the Moovit! truck and lets them off in their neighborhood.]
STAN
Thanks for the ride, Manuel.
MANUEL
Sí, bye. [closes the door and drives off]
BUTTERS
Well, see ya, fellas. Uh I've gotta get home before my parents wake up.
CLYDE
Yeah, me too. [Craig goes off as well]
KYLE
All right. Thanks for your help, dudes. [the boys walk towards Kyle's house, but Kyle stops] Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing.
CARTMAN
Yeah, I feel pretty awesome right now. [Stan looks at the sky and steps forward. The other boys join him. Before them, up in the sky, is the full moon, bright and nicely detailed]
STAN
I wonder... if he'll ever come back and visit us.
KYLE
I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle.
[A shot of the moon, with the Earth in the distance. On the ground lies Willzy-x, motionless.]
JAMBU
(In mind while credits)I'm sorry. Sometimes I can't talk. It's because I'm very very sick, you see.
End of Free Willzyx

synopsis:Stan is embarrassed when his dad gets pulled over for drunk driving. Randy believes that only one thing can save him from his "disease," a bleeding statue of the Virgin Mary in the next town.

CARTMAN
Nah-uh, I don't raku disciprine!
INSTRUCTOR

KYLE
[to Stan] Dude, we've gotta hurry home! The final episode of Lost is on soon. [Cartman and Ike join them. Cartman is wearing a WWII-era Japanese flag as a head band]
CARTMAN
Yeah, let's go.
STAN
[looks around] Wait. Where's my Dad?
KYLE
He knew he had to take us all home, too, right?
STAN
Yeah.
[Outside Ichi Ban Karate. The boys are last out of the class.]
STAN
Dad? Where the hell could he have gone??
RANDY
[waddles in from Stan's right drunk, carrying two bottles of beer] Oh hey, sorry boys.
MALE VOICE
Later Randy.
RANDY
[turns to look at the source] Hey, see you Nelson.
STAN
Dad, weren't you watching?
RANDY
Well, I ran into Nelson from work. We were at the bar watching the game. Two-dollar margaritas! It was great. All right, come on, I'll drive you guys home. [waddles onto a parking space on his way to the driver door]
KYLE
Are you sure you're all right?
RANDY
Oh yeah, I'll be fine. I got some beers to keep my buzz going.
[On the road. Randy chugs more beer as he drives the boys back home. Ike, Cartman, and Kyle sit in the back seat. Stan watches as Randy finishes one bottle, tosses it to the floor, opens another one, and starts chugging.]
STAN
Dad, aren't you supposed to like, not drink and drive?
RANDY
I'm not drinking and driving, I'm driving while I'm drinking. Right, boys?
CARTMAN
Sure, whatever dude.
RANDY
...Oh I gotta pee. Hand me that empty bottle, Stan.
STAN
Why not just pull over?
RANDY
Stan, you need to learn some things about being a man! Now give me that bottle! [Stan picks up a bottle and hands it to him] There's a [Zip. Stan's jaw drops] reason why God made our penises like little hoses, boys. Hold the wheel, Stan. [Stan reaches over and holds it in place] When you boys start driving, you're gonna need to learn to do this too. Woahp! [swerves to avoid what turns out to be a police car]
STAN
Dad, we're gonna crash!
RANDY
Shh! Trying to concentrate! [the cruiser revs up, its lights turn on, and it begins to follow the car. Kyle looks to see what the cop will do] Just hold the damn wheel! [the sound of urine pouring into an empty bottle is heard]
KYLE
Dude, I think you're being followed. [turns around. Cartman then turns around to look]
RANDY
Oh yeah? [instinctively displays his middle finger] Get off my ass, dickhole!
CARTMAN
[turns around] No, dude, it's the police. [the sirens are heard]
RANDY
Aww crap! [pulls over. The cruiser does as well] Here, hold this! [gives Stan the warm bottle of urine, looks around, and zips up his fly.]
STAN
Aww, it's all warm!
RANDY
Everybody just stay calm! I can handle this, no problem. I know how to deal. [sticks some gum into his mouth and starts chewing. The cop taps on his window. Randy lowers the window.]
OFFICER
License and registration, please.
RANDY
What seems to be the officer, problem?
OFFICER
[studies the situation, then] ...Sir, why don't you step out of the car for me?
RANDY
Okay. [steps out of the car and straggles a few steps]
OFFICER
Sir, I'm going to give you a sobriety test.
RANDY
Okay, no problem. Easy.
OFFICER
Stand over here, please? [moves him a few steps] Right there. All right, now I want you to hold your arms out at your sides... [Randy stands there for a moment, then raises his arms out]
RANDY
Ooof. There! I did it, see?! No problem!
OFFICER
And now touch your finger to your nose.
RANDY
Do what??
OFFICER
Touch your finger to your nose.
RANDY
Wull come on, that's impossible!
OFFICER
Just bring one hand to your nose, like this. [demonstrates.]
RANDY
Okay... Okay, hang on... Okay... [begins to make the attempt and wobbles] Okay, hang, ha-, ...hang on... Hol-! Hold on. [turns around and his pants begin falling around his legs] Wa-hang on, hang on. [Cartman and Kyle are watching, Stan can't bear to look. Stan is embarrassed.]
CARTMAN
Dude, what the hell is he doing?
KYLE
I think his pants are falling down.
[moments later, Randy is arrested and placed in the back seat of the cruiser.]
RANDY
What? What did I do?! [the officer closes the door] What did I do?!
[South Park police station. Officers go about their business as Randy is brought in. Randy is now taking a breathalyzer test.]
OFFICER
Keep blowing. Keep blowing. Keep blowing. [Randy vomits onto the floor all of a sudden] Aw Jesus!
[South Park police station, waiting area.]
STAN
[still not looking] This is sooo embarrassing.
CARTMAN
You know, Stan, I'd say your dad racksa disciprine!
[South Park Elementary, next day, classroom. The kids are in class before the school bell rings, chatting.]
KYLE
You know, I didn't even get home until 2:30.
CARTMAN
Man, that was such a bummer.
STAN
Look, guys, about last night, can you just be quiet about it?
CARTMAN
Why?
STAN
Because, I don't want everyone knowing, okay? Could we please just keep this to ourselves?
CARTMAN
All right, Stan. Sure. [the school bell rings and Mrs. Garrison enters with her books, setting them on her desk]
MRS. GARRISON
Okay children, let's take our seats. [the kids take their seats] Today we will be continuing our study of economics. But first, we're going to hear from a motivational speaker. The state has sent over somebody to talk to you all about the dangers of drunk driving. Please welcome Stan's dad. [a sober Randy walks in slowly and looks down]
STAN
Oh Jesus. [puts his hands over his eyes out of embarrassment. Mrs. Garrison sits at her chair]
RANDY
Well uh, I'm, s'posed to tell you kids about how bad drinking is, um... I'd-did a little drinking and driving. As part of my punishment I'm... doing community service work at schools like these.
MRS. GARRISON
Oh that's very interesting, isn't it, kids? [the kids stay silent, Stan buries his face in his desk out of more embarrassment]
RANDY
Uh, you you shouldn't drink, because it leads to uh bad things. I was in jail for the night and well I guess I donno, I... Just don't drink but,... if you must drink, d-definitely don't drive. I've... definitely learned that firsthand, and uh, uuh, that's all, I guess.
MRS. GARRISON
...Well, I think we've all learned an important lesson, haven't we, class? If you don't make the right choices in life, you could end up being a big loser like Stan's dad. [the kids stay silent, Stan keeps his face buried] Drinking and driving is for idiots. Nobody wants to end up like Stan's dad, do they? [another shot of the class] I want you all to take a good look at Stan's dad and say, "Is that who I want to be in thirty years? Getting tickets and having to go to elementary school classrooms and talk about how pathetic I am?" Thank you Mr. Marsh, I think you made your point. [Randy turns away and walks out of the class]
[Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. A 12-step program is on the wall behind the speaker.]
AA SPEAKER
Hello again everyone, my name is Michael, and, I'm an alcoholic.
GROUP
[all wave] Hi, Michael.
MICHAEL
As most of you know I once lost my job and my family because of my drinking. But with the help of AA I've been sober for ten years now. [the group claps] Anyone have anything they wanna tell the groups, for starters?
MAN 1
[stands up] My name's Bill, and Im an alcoholic.
GROUP
Hi Bill.
RANDY
[subdued] Hi Bill.
BILL
I've been using the 12-step program for about two months now and, and I'm really turning my life around. No more blowing guys on Colfax Avenue for a pint of vodka for THIS cowboy! [the group claps. Bill sits down]
MICHAEL
That's great. And I understand this is somebody's first AA meeting, is that right? [Randy points to himself]</> Y-yes, you sir. Stand on up and introduce yourself.
RANDY
[rises] Um, my name's Randy, and... I just, really like beer.
MAN 2
You have to admit you're an alcoholic.
RANDY
[slowly] But, I don't know if I'm really an alcoholic.
BIG WOMAN
Then why are you here?
RANDY
Because I got a DUI and so I'm required to attend AA meetings for two weeks. I was stupid one night and drank too much and then drove a car. That was dumb and I'm not gonna do it again.
MICHAEL
Randy, you are powerless to make that decision. The only thing that works is the 12-step program. [points out the 12 steps] Step 1 is admitting that you are powerless to control your drinking. Only then can you move on to the other 12 steps, like, believing that only a higher power, God, makes you stop drinking. And then, turning your life over to that God and, humbly asking God to remove your weaknesses.
RANDY
What wait wait, hold on. I never knew that Alcoholics Anonymous was a religious thing.
MICHAEL
Well it's not religious. You just have to admit that there is some kind of god which has power over you and turn your life over to that god and ask him for forgiveness. That's the 12-step program, not religion.
RANDY
Look, I, I really just need to cut down on my drinking and never drive the car drunk again.
MICHAEL
[approaches Randy] You just can't cut down on your drinking, Randy. You need to know something. You have a disease.
RANDY
Uh... a disease?
MICHAEL
That's right. Alcoholism is a disease. You're sick, Randy. You're very very sick. And just like with most diseases, you can't cure it yourself. And it's deadly.
RANDY
[appalled by the "diagnosis"] Oh my God...
[Stan's house, later. Stan arrives and enters. As he hears the sofa, he sees his father wrapped in a blanket and bottles of beer on the coffee table before him. Another bottle is next to him on the couch. He's sipping more beer.]
STAN
Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
RANDY
[quivering] Hello, Stan.
STAN
Dad, it's the middle of the day! I thought you weren't going to drink as much anymore!
RANDY
No, Stan, you don't understand. I have a disease. Daddy's very sick.
STAN
What?? Did you go to your AA meeting?!
RANDY
Yes, they're the ones that told me. I thought I could just quite drinking on my own, but... it's an illness, son. I have to admit that I'm powerless to this terrible disease. [coughs, drinks, and burps.]
STAN
Dad, you've had enough! Just stop now!
RANDY
I can't! I'm sick! [begins to cry and walks off in his blanket. He goes to the bathroom and closes the door, then goes to the vanity and looks in the mirror] It's not fair! Why did you give me this disease?! [coughs as he cries, then takes some shears to his hair and shaves it off. Stan is about to pour milk into a glass downstairs] Stan! Stan! [Stan stops and sets the carton of milk down, then walks into the living room, where Randy is now seated in a wheelchair.] Stan.
STAN
Aww, Goddammit!
RANDY
Stan I... need your help.
STAN
Dad, what are you doing in Grandpa's extra wheelchair?!
RANDY
Gotta try to take it easy from now on, son. Get Daddy another beer, will ya?
STAN
No! You don't need another beer!
RANDY
[turns away and rolls off] I know that! But this disease is just eating me up! I hate my illness!
STAN
Dad, you just need to not drink so much. It's very simple.
RANDY
I wish it was that simple, son. But if I don't give myself up to a higher power, this disease is going to kill me dead. I'm afraid the only thing that will cure me... is a miracle.
[the nighttime sky. The camera pans down from the big, bright moon to a church with a grotto in front with a statue of the Virgin Mary with halo looking down benevolently. Somewhere on the statue a red dot appears. The dot grows into a patch and begins to bleed down the gown. The parish priest is walking away from the church when he notices the bleeding. He turns to get a better look, smears some of the liquid onto his finger, and analyzes it.]
PRIEST
[softly] Es un milagro. [loudly] Es un milagro! [immediately gets on his knees and crosses himself, then holds the bloodied finger upright]
[A news report in front of the church, day. A crowd begins to gather at the grotto.]
CHRIS
Tom, I'm standing in the garden of St. Peter's church in Bailey, where what some call a miracle is taking place. The statue of the Virgin Mary has started to bleed. Out its ass. [an establishing shot of the statue] The phenomenon was first seen by Father Harold Barnes, [standing with the Spanish-speaking priest in front of the statue's backside] who saw the blood coming from the Virgin Mary's ass late last night. [back to the reporter] People from all over the state have flocked here to the church to witness the apparent miracle firsthand.
WOMAN 1
Well, we just heard that this miracle was happening and we wanted to see it for ourselves and come and pray.
CHRIS
Why do you believe the Virgin Mary is dripping blood?
WOMAN 2
Well it may represent her sorrow over all the bad things going on in the world.
CHRIS
Why do you believe the Virgin Mary is dripping blood out her ass? [both women stay silent] As news of the miracle spreads, hundreds are expected to show up here at the church, hoping to witness the miracle, and even cure their diseases.
[The Marsh living room. Randy's watching the screen.]
RANDY
Cure... cure disease. STAN!!
[The next AA meeting.]
MAN 3
My name is Harry and I'm an alcoholic.
GROUP
Hi Harry.
HARRY
I've been sober now for five years and I I've learned that drinking ice tea and, and getting more involved with my relationship with God is, is, is way more fun than partying.
WOMAN 2
It it sure is.
HARRY
Once I accepted that I was powerless to control my drinking and my life, I I put it in God's hands and now, these meeting are the most fun thing I do.
MAN 4
Yeah. [Stan enters the meeting room and walks up towards the front]
STAN
Ah, excuse me, who's in charge here?
MICHAEL
None of us are in charge. We're all powerless.
GROUP
We sure are. That's right. Uh huh.
STAN
Uh, look, my dad was here yesterday and ...you all kind of messed him up by telling him he had a disease?
HARRY
Alcoholism is a disease.
STAN
No it, it's not. And, y-you can't just go around saying stuff like that to people like my dad. He He's kind of, a hypochondriac
MAN 2
It is a disease because it's a physical dependency. That makes it a disease.
STAN
No, cancer is a disease. My dad needs to drink less.
MICHAEL
He can't quit by himself. None of us could. He needs divine intervention. Spirituality.
STAN
No, he just needs a disciprine. But thanks to you people, my dad now thinks he has a disease that he can't cure himself.
MICHAEL
Young man, do you know anything about the 12-Step Program?
STAN
Yeah, and I also know a thing or two about cults. I was the leader of one for a while. [he is promptly kicked out] Goddammit! [walks off]
[Another news report.]
CHRIS
The crowd grows larger every hour, as the statue of the Virgin Mary continues to miraculously cry blood... out her ass. A Cardinal, Mallory, has been sent by the Vatican to determine whether this is a true miracle or not. [the cardinal and two assistants walk into the grotto]
FATHER BARNES
[showing the Cardinal where to go.] Right this way, Cardinal. [the cardinal, priests, and assistants go behind the statue] The blood always comes from the same area. Sometimes a little, sometimes a lot. [the Cardinal walks into position and begins to take a good look. He puts on his glasses and looks again. He looks even closer, and a stream of blood shoots at his eyes. His face and bust are full of blood as he moves from the back of the statue to the front. He wipes gobs of blood from his glasses and mouth and tosses them to the floor]
CARDINAL MALLORY
[Irish accent] It's a miracle! [the waiting crowd cheers]
[The street. Stan is still pissed off from his expulsion from the AA meeting, but he notices his father grunting. Randy is next to the car, still in the wheelchair. He opens the car door and climbs in.]
RANDY
[burps] Uh, kay, here we go. [gets into position]
STAN
[rushes up] Dad?! Dad, what are you doing?!
RANDY
I gotta drive to Bailey. [chugs another beer]
STAN
Dad, you're drunk! You're not driving a car!
RANDY
No, Stan, you don't understand. There's a church in Bailey. The statue of the Virgin Mary is bleeding out her ass.
STAN
[stays quiet, then] What??
RANDY
They say her divine ass blood has miraculous healing power. She can cure my alcoholism! I'll be back soon!
STAN
Dad, you can't drive! Your license is suspended, remember?! If you get pulled over again, you're gonna go to jail for ten years!
RANDY
[thinks] Alright... then you drive. [points to Stan]
STAN
... I'm eight!
RANDY
[makes a fist with his right hand] This is my only hope, Stan! Either you drive this car or I will!
[On the road. Randy sits in the passenger side chugging more beer.]
RANDY
I sure hope this works. No. No, it will work! I have to put my faith in a higher power. I HAVE to believe that this will work! [looks off to his left] There! There's the church! Stop right here, Stan!
STAN
Where? I can't see.
RANDY
Right here is good! Brake pedal! Left pedal! [Stan manages to pull into a spot] Alright, get my wheelchair out of the back. [takes another chug of beer]
[St. Peter's Church in Bailey, night. Stan wheels Randy up to the end of the line, but isn't happy to be doing this.]
RANDY
Is this the line? [Stan's eyes open wide. Before them is a long line leading up to the grotto] Oh God! [gets in line] Is this whole line people waiting to be cured?
MAN 5
Yeah. I was diagnosed with brain cancer two months ago. I feel like this is my only hope.
RANDY
I know exactly how you feel. I've got alcoholism.
STAN
[covers his eyes] Oh my God...
RANDY
Wait a minute. Stan, isn't that Josh Garrett up there? He's from South Park. Maybe he'll let us in line with him.
STAN
Dad, let's just wait our turn.
RANDY
I could die waiting in this line, Stan. Come on, let's go! [Stan wheels him up to Josh.] Heeey heh, Josh Garrett. How you doin'?
JOSH
Oh, hey Randy. What happened to you??
RANDY
I've got a disease: Alcoholism. It's pretty serious. You?
JOSH
Mm-my daughter has elephantitis [the camera pans down to a horribly deformed girl with a bad breathing condition and crutches.]
RANDY
We are the same, she and I.
MAN 6
Eey, what do you think you're doin', kid?
OLD WOMAN
[in her wheelchair]You're trying to cut in line!
STAN
I just, my dad was-
MAN 7
[walks around the old woman] You're a butter! You're a dirty line cutter! [the statue is shown, and another elderly lady walks up to it. Father Barnes takes some blood from the statue's ass and forms a cross with it on the woman's forehead]
OLD WOMAN 2
Praise Jesus. [walks away smiling. The crowd moves up on. Randy didn't return to the back of the line.]
RANDY
This is taking too long! I'm gonna run out of beer! Stan!
STAN
What?!
RANDY
[in hushed tones] You see that guy up there? I think he has a kidney disease. Every couple of minutes he gets out of line to go to the bathroom. When he leaves next, let's take his place.
STAN
No, Dad, people will see!
RANDY
The guy behind him is blind! There he goes! C'mon! C'mon! Go go go! [the line advances and Stan and Randy quickly move in and fill the space]
BLIND MAN
Hey. I smell a butter.
WOMAN 3
He did, that kid just cut in line!
MAN 8
Back o'the line, butter!
RANDY
I'm going to die!
STAN
[gets into position to move the wheelchair to the back of the line] Dad, we're going back!
OFFICER
What's goin' on here?
MAN 9
This kid's cutting in line!
RANDY
Please, officer, you have to understand. I need a miracle way more than these people. I'm an alcoholic, and I'm powerless over it.
OFFICER
...I understand. My, my brother's an alcoholic. Here, let me push you to the front of the line. [Stan looks on a bit stunned]
RANDY
Oh bless you, sir! Bless you! [the line parts as the officer moves him] 'Scuse me, out of the way, alcoholic coming through! [the officer moves him into position. Randy wheels himself closer] She's... beautiful. [the statue squirts a long stream of blood on him and he rejoices in it] Aaaah. AAAAAaaaaah! [opens his eyes, and the statue quickly squirts him one more time. He then wheels himself into view and struggles to get up from the wheelchair. He still has a bottle with him] I'm... not... going... to drink this. I'm not going to drink this! [throws the bottle off somewhere] It's a miracle! I'm cured! [begins to dance away. Stan is embarrassed and stewing] Yoohoohoo! Praise Jesus! Praise Mary the Blessed Virgin Mother! Thank you! Thank you God! [runs off]
[The Marsh house, morning at the breakfast table. Shelly is drinking some milk, Stan is reading a comic book, Sharon is making breakfast.]
RANDY
Good morning, family. The Lord has truly blessed us with another beautiful day. [reaches over and kisses Sharon, then goes to his seat at table] It's just amazing. I haven't had a drink in five days. Praise Christ. Praise him. [looks at his kids]
STAN
Praise Christ.
SHELLY
Praise Christ.
RANDY
I've got another AA meeting today and guess where it's gonna be, Stan. At Whistlin' Willy's Pizza, so you can come with me.
STAN
Naw, Dad, all the guys are going to Kyle's hosue to watch the Bronco game. Kenny and Kyle's Dads were hoping you'd come.
RANDY
Stan, those people drink. I have new friends now. My AA friends, who have faith in a higher power.
[Whistlin' Willy's Pizza Gulch, later.]
GROUP
Yeah, all right, woohoo! [Randy and Stan sit among Randy's new friends and their kids.]
RANDY
Boy this lemonade is great! Who knew how fun being sober could be?!
GROUP
Yeah! That's right! Right!
BOY
Your dad doesn't drink either?
STAN
No, my dad doesn't drink.
BOY
Does that mean we're friends? [Stan just looks over at him]
RANDY
'Scuse me, I-I'd like to address the group if I may.
MICHAEL
Sure Randy, go ahead.
RANDY
[rises] I'm Randy and I'm an alcoholic.
GROUP
Hi Randy.
RANDY
But I put my faith in a higher power and... I haven't had a drink for five days now! [the group cheers him on, but behind him another news report pops up]
[News Report from St. Peter's Church in Bailey.]
CHRIS
An update from the bleeding Virgin Mary statue!
RANDY
[turns around and reacts] Oh wait. Sh sh. Hold on a second, gang. [the group queits down]
CHRIS
Earlier today, the new pope, Pope Benedict the 16th himself, visited the statue here in Bailey to witness the miracle firsthand. [Footage of the pope walking through the crowd. People left and right kneel before him in reverence] It was an amazing sight to behold as Pope Benedict made his way through the throngs of people.
CARDINAL MALLORY
Right this way, Your Holiness.
CHRIS
The pope then examined the statue closely. [the pope draw closer... closer... blinks, gets closer... looks at the camera and raises his eyebrows quickly twice, turns back and gets closer, gets a stream of blood on his face, about as much as Randy got] After witnessing the phenomenon firsthand, the pope then cleaned himself off and then declared that the bleeding Virgin Mary statue is not a miracle!
RANDY
What?
CHRIS
Having investigated closely, the pope determined that the blood was not coming from the Virgin Mary's ass, but rather, from her vagina. And the pope said quote, "A chick bleeding out her vagina is no miracle. Chicks bleed out their vagina's all the time." [a graphic with those words appears on screen, along with an image of the pope and his name, Pope Benedict XVI] Back to you, Tom.
TOM
Thanks, Edward, that's a very shocking report...
RANDY
That means... I'm not cured. I still have the disease! [throws his mug of lemonade away and heads for the bar] Bartender! I need a drink! Three shots of McAllen, two small bottles of vodka, three bottles of beer and some Jell-O shooters! [getting frantic] Come ON! Let's GO!
MICHAEL
Randy, uh what are you doing?
RANDY
You heard what he said! [gathers his drinks and carries them] The higher power didn't cure me! I'm powerless again!
MAN 10
I'm, I'm, I'm powerless too!
MAN 11
Yeah me too!
MAN 10
Get me seven martinis!
MAN 12
Jack and Coke!
[Whistlin' Willy's, outside. Randy staggers out with his drinks.]
STAN
Dad, Dad, Stop!
RANDY
[turns around, dropping an empty bottle] I'm sorry, son! I'm off the wagon!
STAN
Dad, you don't have to do this! You have the power. You haven't drank since seeing the statue.
RANDY
But the statue wasn't a miracle!
STAN
Yeah. The statue wasn't a miracle, Dad. So that means you did it. That means you didn't have a drink for five days all on your own.
RANDY
You're right, Stan. If God didn't make me stop drinking then... I did. Maybe... Maybe I can force myself to never drink again. [throws off all his drinks, and they shatter on the pavement.]
STAN
No!
RANDY
No??
STAN
Dad, you like to drink. So have a drink once in a while. Have two. If you devote your whole life to completely avoiding something you like, then that thing still controls your life and, 'n you've never learned any discipline at all.
RANDY
But, maybe... I'm just the kind of person who needs to have it all or nothing.
STAN
Naw. All or nothing is easy. But learning to drink a little bit, responsibly, that'sa disciprine. Disciprine... come from within. [Randy looks at Stan for a moment, then walks up to his side and kneels next to him.]
RANDY
How did I manage to raise such a smart kid?
STAN
I've had a great teacher.
RANDY
Thanks son.
STAN
No not you, my karate teacher. He's really smart.
RANDY
Oh. Well, tell you what: let's leave the car here, walk home, and watch the game. Like to have another beer or two.
STAN
