synopsis:When one of the boys leaves the toilet seat up after he uses the bathroom, an unspeakable tragedy occurs.

script:Reverse Cowgirl

[The Donovan house. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny and Clyde are playing football in the backyard.]
STAN
Throw it here! Throw it here! [Clyde throws the ball.] Yeah! Nice one, Clyde! [Clyde's mom shouts through the window.]
BETSY
Clyde! Clyde! Clyde, get up here! Hurry! [Clyde runs in with panic. The boys follow him.]
[Betsy is waiting Clyde in the bathroom with an angry expression. Clyde comes in and the other boys wait him outside.]
BETSY
[points at the toilet] What is that?
CLYDE
A toilet?
BETSY
That's right. It's a toilet, Clyde. And where is the toilet seat? It's up, because you left it up, again! We've been through this countless times, Clyde.
CLYDE
Okay mom, just not in front of my friends okay?
BETSY
No, not okay. Because you aren't getting the message! What if I'd fallen in? Start listening to me! Put it down! Put it down! [Clyde hurriedly puts it down. Betsy walks to the door] Thank you. [Clyde stands alone, embarrassed.]
CARTMAN
[whistles] Dude, that sucks, Clyde. A mom shouldn't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that. Toilet-time is the last bastion of American freedom.
KYLE
Is your mom always like that dude?
CLYDE
Look, could you guys just not say anything about this in school, please?
CARTMAN
[puts his arm on Clyde] Of course, man. It's cool.
[South Park Elementary, day. The kids are in class.]
CARTMAN
[imitating Clyde's mom] Clyde, Clyde! What have I told you about pissing on the seat? And Clyde's all like "Ah, okay mom, fuck! Not in front of my friends! [He laughs, Butters joins him.]
KYLE
Cartman, it was actually really lame.
CARTMAM
I know, right. Women are just jealous 'cause they have to sit outwards to pee and crap.
BUTTERS
[laughs] Wait a minute! You're supposed to poop on the toilet facing out? [looks around] But I thought you sit on the toilet this way. [demonstrates by sitting backwards on his chair] So that you have that nice little shelf for your comics and chocolate milk? Well, because you got the flusher right here. No? [turns around] Oh jeez, that's embarrassing.
BETSY
[offscreen] Clyde! Clyde! [comes in wearing a nightgown, a coat and slippers] There you are!
CLYDE
Mom?
BETSY
Clyde Donovan, you come home this instant!
CLYDE
Why?
BETSY
What have I told you about putting the toilet seat down after you go to the bathroom?
CLYDE
Mom, I'm in class.
BETSY
How many times do I have to tell you Clyde? I was trying to get ready for work and the toilet seat was up, again.
ROGER
Betsy, come back home. It's just not that big a deal.
BETSY
No, Roger! It's a disgusting habit and I'm sick and tired of it. If I had sat down, I would have gotten toilet water all over my vagina.
BUTTERS
My grandma is from Virginia. [smiles]
BETSY
You're coming home right now, and you're putting the seat down where it belongs. Let's go.
CLYDE
[Looks down in embarrassment, leaves the classroom.]
[The Cartman house, night. Cartman is lying on his bed with his pajamas on and he is cutting his toenails and eating Thwizlers while talking on the phone.]
CARTMAN
Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die.
[The Broflovski house, night. Kyle is talking on the phone while his family is seen eating dinner behind.]
KYLE
I know, fatass. I was there.
CARTMAN
His mom... His mom goes: "Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay."
KYLE
That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.
CARTMAN
I know dude. The bathroom is the last bastion of American freedom.
KYLE
Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde?
CARTMAN
Nuh-uh.
KYLE
Well you should. The poor guy shouldn't be screamed for something that just isn't that big a deal at all. [police siren is heard offscreen.]
[The Donovan house, night. The police, firefighters, ambulance and a crowd of people has gathered around the house. A ladder is placed to reach the second floor window. The camera pans to Stan and Kenny with Kyle approaching them.]
KYLE
What's going on?
STAN
They are trying to save Clyde's mom.
KYLE
From what?
STAN
They're saying Clyde left the toilet seat up again.
[The Donovan's bathroom. Betsy is stuck in the toilet, moaning and desperately trying to get herself out. Three firemen, a paramedics figure and Clyde are standing beside her.]
FIREMAN 1
Hang it there. You're going to be fine okay? Stay with me now. [Another fireman approaches Roger.]
FIREMAN 2
I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do.
ROGER
What?!
FIREMAN 2
When she fell into the toilet, she also made it flush. It created a suction that's literally pulling out her insides.
ROGER
Can't we disconnect the toilet from the plumbing?
PARAMEDIC
Yes, we'll have to, but when we do that the change in pressure will rip out her organs.
CLYDE
But she's not gonna die, is she?
FIREMAN 2
Why did you leave the toilet seat up, son?
BETSY
Clyde! Clyde! [Clyde goes next to her.] Clyde, I want you to know I don't blame you for this. We should have been h-h-harder on you all those times you left the toilet seat up.
CLYDE
Mom, I'm sorry.
BETSY
Shhh! Sh! I.. don't... have a lot of time, Clyde. Just please put the toilet seat down from now on for your sister's sake, please. Oh, God, please let me go. Let me go. Do it! Do it! Do it! [The third fireman shuts off the plumbing. Betsy screams while her organs are pulled out, then stops, apparently dead.]
CLYDE
Mom?
[The church. It's the funeral of Betsy Donovan. A plain chant is heard. Stephen Stotch is giving his speech.]
STEPHEN
I'll always remember Betsy Donovan's kind nature, more than anything. She always treated people with dignity and respect. [The camera zooms out. Betsy's corpse in the coffin is seen with a heavy make-up and a pink dress, yet still stuck in the toilet.] What a tragedy she had to leave us so soon. But I'm sure Betsy is hoping that her death will help women everywhere, just take that extra second to look before they sit on a toilet. [Sharon and Sheila look at each other in disbelief.]
LINDA
I'd like to say on behalf of the departed, that it isn't a woman's responsibility to see that the seat is down. It's a man's responsibility to put it down. It's not that hard. [all the women start to applause]
WOMEN
Yeah, yes. That's right.
MAN WITH GREY HAIR
[reads from a paper] Putting the toilet seat down isn't that hard. So is it too much to ask women to just look and put it down before they go plopping their butts blindly to the toilet bowl?
WOMAN WITH BROWN HAIR
My God, people. This is a funeral! Please have some respect! There's a little boy here who has lost his mother! [Clyde is shown, looking down in sorrow] He'll never see her again, because he couldn't take that sixth-tenths of a second to put the toilet seat down when he was done peeing. [camera shows the woman again] And now little Clyde's mother is dead, and the blood is on his penis. [organ music is played]
[The Cartman house, day. Two men from the TSA ring on the door. Cartman is watching Terrance and Phillip while eating cereal.]
TERRANCE
Crap. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip.
PHILLIP
Oh, hello, Ugly Bob. [the doorbell rings again]
UGLY BOB
Hello Terrance. Hello Phillip.
CARTMAN
Mom, get the door! [Liane walks in to answer the door]
TERRANCE
You're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob.
UGLY BOB
How come you guys say stuff like that?
PHILLIP
Because you're goddamn ugly... [The sound from the TV fades away]
TSA AGENT 1
Hello ma'am, we're the Toilet Safety Administration.
LIANE
The what?
TSA AGENT 2
After the recent tragedy, new safety regulations require us to check every toilet for security. Can we come in?
LIANE
Oh sure. [The TSA employees come in and go upstairs to the bathroom.]
CARTMAN
Who are these buttholes?
LIANE
It's the Toilet Safety Administration, hun. They're gonna do something to the potty.
CARTMAN
My potty? What are they going to do to it? [runs upstairs]
[The hallway. The TSA employees enter the bathroom while Cartman runs after them.]
CARTMAN
Hey, hey! That's my bathroom! [Liane follows him]
[The bathroom.]
TSA AGENT 1
Oh yeah, we're gonna have to completely redo this ma'am.
LIANE
Oh.
TSA AGENT 1
You need to have this counter moved to a minimum of six inches, but we'll go ahead and install your safety belt.
LIANE
Safety belt?
TSA AGENT 2
Federal law requires all toilets to be fitted with a safety harness so that nobody can fall in.
CARTMAN
Dude, you can't make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump.
TSA AGENT 2
This is for your safety. A woman died, you know.
CARTMAN
Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine.
[Hoffman & Turk Law Office. Clyde, Kyle, Stan and Jimmy are talking to an attorney who is reading a case file.]
KYLE
Sir, we are really worried about our friend Clyde. Everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener.
ATTORNEY
Uh-uh, go on.
STAN
We keep trying to tell him maybe this all isn't his fault. Maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened.
KYLE
So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody.
ATTORNEY
You can always sue somebody.
KYLE
All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet.
ATTORNEY
You got it. [types on his computer] Here we go, the inventor of the toilet. [the camera shows the webpage he's reading, which turns out to be a Wickie page] Sir Thomas Harrington. In England, died in 1692.
KYLE
Aw, he's dead?
STAN
So then we can't sue him?
ATTORNEY
Why not? You can always sue somebody. It's just gonna take some special protocol. We would have to perform a sue-ance. [spooky music, lightning and thunder follow]
JIMMY
A...a...a...a sue-ance?
ATTORNEY
You bet. Here at Hoffman and Turk we specialize in suing the dead. If you hire us, we'll work hard, for you.
STAN
Wow, really?!
KYLE
[puts his arm around Clyde] You hear that Clyde?
ATTORNEY
Now look. I'll be asking all of you to have a very open mind and a willingness to face you fears. [draws a curtain] I warn you boys. A sue-ance can be very... expensive.
STAN
How expensive?
ATTORNEY
How much do you have?
KYLE
Clyde got $3000 from his mom's life insurance
ATTORNEY
Wow! That's exactly how much a sue-ance costs. [Dramatic music plays. The camera zooms to the man, then pans to the boys.]
JIMMY
Wow, that's weird.
[Randy is sitting on a toilet. He yawns, then farts. A ladder is put on the window, with a cop on it knocking on the window]
RANDY
Aw, damn it. [reaches the seatbelt. The cop knocks again, so he opens the window.] He, hey officer.
OFFICER
If you're stting on the toilet you need to wear your safety belt, sir.
RANDY
Yeah, I know, I had it on. I just took it off for a second to get the uh... to get to the uh...
OFFICER
The address here is 260 Avenue de los Mexicanos?
RANDY
Oh, come on, don't give me a ticket!
OFFICER
Gotta wear your safety belt or you could fall in.
RANDY
I'm not gonna fall in. I'm not a chick. [puts his belt on]
OFFICER
The law is the law sir. [hands over the ticket] You can pay this by mail or appear in court on that date. Have a good day, sir. [leaves]
RANDY
Yeah thanks. [under his breath] Asshole.
OFFICER
[comes up] You say something?
RANDY
No, I was talking to my asshole. C-C'mon, asshole. Let's get back to work. [the cop leaves]
[International House of Pancakes (IHOP), day. Cartman and Butters are in the long line for the bathroom. Butters looks impatient because of retaining his pee.]
CARTMAN
This is unbelievable. Stupid Toilet Safety Administration. You can't even take a crap at IHOP without a forty minute line!
R. BOOTH
Shoes off, belts off! Sharp objects go in the plastic tray!
MAN 1
This is inhumane.
R. BOOTH
Shut up! Sir.
[Two TSA agents are examining a woman for the toilet pass.]
R. WILEY
Taking a dump today, ma'am?
WOMAN 2
No, just need to pee.
R. WILEY
I'll just need to check inside your aaasshole. [Cartman comes in]
CARTMAN
Hey, how about you people speed it up in here? I'm about to crap my pants and I demand access to the toilet right now!
R. WILEY
All right, do you mind if I touch your balls, sir?
CARTMAN
What? Yes I'd mind! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls?
GERALD
[flushes and comes out the toilet cabin] Okay, I'm done.
R. WILEY
Alright, sir. I just need to check inside your aaasshole. [takes out a handkerchief and starts wiping his butt]
GERALD
I don't need you wiping my ass for me. I'm a grown man.
R. WILEY
Yes, you're a big boy, aren't you, sir?
GERALD
Yeah, I'm a big boy.
R. WILEY
That's a big boy, sir.
GERALD
I'm a big boy. I took a big boy poop.
R. WILEY
Yes.
[Stan, Kyle, Clyde, Jimmy and the attorney are sitting around a table in a dark room. The attorney lights two candles.]
ATTORNEY
Alright boys, sit down and clear your minds. The sue-ance is about to begin. Doors and windows are locked. You boys have your $500 in cash ready?
STAN
[holds the money] Yeah.
ATTORNEY
Alright. Then I've got this big bowl set here to catch all money we're about to make. Now. Let us start. [holds hands with Jimmy and Clyde, then closes his eyes, so does Jimmy] We call out to the land of the dead. Sir John Harrington. Your presence is requested. Appear to us, John Harrington. We have a subpoena.
JIMMY
Jeez, it's not working.
ATTORNEY
John Harrington. My client is due compensation for negligence. [a creepy music plays. The table starts to rock, much to the Stan and Kyle's surprise.] What is your name, spirit?
SPIRIT
[offscreen] Burns. Jimmy Burns. What's it to you? Who are you, mugs?
ATTORNEY
[under his breath] That's how people talked in the past. [to the spirit] We have a claim against a John Harrington. Do you know him, spirit?
BURNS
Well, maybe I do and maybe I don't. Might need a little something to jar my memory.
ATTORNEY
We gotta grease him. Put a hundred in the box. [Stan puts the money. The money disappears with a sparkling effect.]
BURNS
Oh yeah, Harrington. I know him. Always going round inventing things.
ATTORNEY
Yes, that's him. Is his personage amongst you?
BURNS
Well, maybe it is and maybe it isn't.
ATTORNEY
Give him another hundred. [Stan puts the money, it disappears like the previous one]
BURNS
Yeah, I've seen him around, alright. He was just down that way, bragging about some porcelain machine and whatever. [the table rocks]
SPIRIT 2
Nooo! Nooooo!
ATTORNEY
By the power of Christ, we sue you! [fireworks start to pop] By the power of Christ, we sue you!
SPIRIT 2
You can't sue me! [the drawers around the room move]
ATTORNEY
Quick, put the other $300 in the box! [Stan tosses the money. The attorney swings the box, gasping for breath.] This actually went really, really well. Always happens some bureaucrat tries to block the first sue-ance attempt, but this was good. We'll get him tomorrow.
CLYDE
So that's it?
ATTORNEY
Yeah, we're gonna need about 400 more dollars tomorrow. I know you're sad about your mom, Clyde, but don't worry. We're going to win this thing.
[The Marsh house, morning. Randy walks in the hallway to the toilet. He is in his morning gown, hold a coffee in his hand.]
[The toilet. The two TSA agents from IHOP are there. R. Wiley is sitting behind a plastic tray.]
R. WILEY
Put your coffee in the plastic tray please, sir.
R. BOOTH
Shoes off. Belts off.
RAND
[takes off his gown] Yeah yeah.
R. WEST
Got any metal in your pockets?
R. WILEY
I just need to check your asshole.
RANDY
[sighs, then turns around, lowering his pants] So ridiculous.
R. WILEY
[examines his ass with a flashlight] Asshole clear.
RANDY
[puts his pants on] Thanks.
R. WEST
Pick your coffee up, sir. [Randy picks his coffee, then heads to the toilet]
R. WILEY
Anyways, he says I'm getting nothing anyway, so then you can...
RANDY
[points away] Hey, what's that thing? [a camera]
R. WILEY
That's a camera. It's a security camera.
RANDY
Aw, you people have me on camera now?
R. WEST
It's okay, sir. There's just one person viewing the monitors in a discrete location.
[The TSA security camera monitoring room. There is one guy apparently masturbating over the view of hundreds of people in bathrooms.]
[South Park Community Center. Cartman is giving his speech]
CARTMAN
Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms.
PEOPLE
Yeah.
CARTMAN
Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in.
MR. GARRISON
Hey, yeah. If there's no toilet seats, the government can't make toilet seat laws. [the crowd cheers]
JIMBO
Alright, let's do it.
SHEILA
No, no, hold on. If the seat can't raise up the men will just pee all over it.
MAN 3
No, we won't.
WOMAN 3
Yeah, you will.
CARTMAN
Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right?
WOMAN 4
How about we agree to that, if men will agree that they will always sit down to urinate.
STEPHEN
Well, no, you can't make men sit down to pee. How could we play sink the boat?
RANDY
Yeah, how will Nelson and I make an X on sleepover nights?
MAN 4
What about us loggers? Hardworking man who like to stand up after they have taken a poo and then turn around and but the poo in half with their urine?
CARTMAN
Well, sorry, but if we don't want the government treating us like children, we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half.
MAN 4
But folks been logging round these parts for generations. My pappy taught me logging. And his pappy before him.
RANDY
Yeah, I think we've just gotta live with the TSA. [several men say 'Yeah' agreeing him]
[The dark room. Stan, Kyle, Clyde, Jimmy and the attorney are sitting around the same table. The attorney is holding hands with Jimmy and Clyde with his eyes closed.]
ATTORNEY
Oh, oohh! The spirits of the dead are looking over the subpoena. Motion for summary judgement on behalf of the plaintiff? Ah, aaaah!
JIMMY
What's happening now?
ATTORNEY
Our motion has been denied by the judge. [the drawers begin to move] Concentrate boys! [holds the box tight. The drawers stop, the attorney heaves a sigh of relief] This specter is like none I have ever encountered. I managed to avert liability within injunction against out claim.
STAN
So what does that mean?
ATTORNEY
We'll hit him with a class action lawsuit tomorrow. We'll need all your friends and family to sign a petition and kick in 50 bucks each.
KYLE
[frowning] What?
ATTORNEY
Hang in there, Clyde. This is all to make the world a safer place.
[The security camera monitoring room. Squishy sounds arise while the monitor guy masturbates. He clicks on the monitor's button a couple of times to change the channel, then stops at a woman reading book while taking a dump. He changes the channel some more, and then takes some bit of the moisturizing lotion on the table to put on his penis. He keeps on changing the channel until the view of Cartman standing with an angry face appears. He keeps looking at the monitor while rubbing his penis, though his motions get more interrupted. Cartman puts a gun on a stool, brings in a baby and R. Wiley, bound and gagged. He climbs up a small ladder and sprays the camera with black spray paint. The man's expression changes to a concerned look. He reaches to the microphone.]
MONITOR MAN
Security breeeach!
[The news.]
REPORTER
An embarrassing day for the toilet safety administration. Shocking outrage ensued after an unknown terrorist managed to get through TSA security with a gun and a baby. Leaving the toilet seat up. The head TSA chief of operations had this to say:
[R. West is shown sitting on an outside table in a park.]
R. WEST
Shiiiit!
REPORTER
Meanwhile, outraged civilians are claiming they're finally fed up with the overblown government bureaucracy.
[Park County Community Center, day. A huge crowd has gathered in front of the building. Cartman is standing in front of the crowd, and Randy is behind the pulpit]
RANDY
What good is the TSA if they aren't protecting us? Why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet?
WOMAN 5
And the toilet seat was up.
RANDY
We've all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity.
CARTMAN
That's right.
RANDY
Now it's time for us to take responsibility for ourselves.
CARTMAN
Yeah.
RANDY
It is time for us all to grow up.
CARTMAN
That's right.
RANDY
It is time for a sue-ance.
PEOPLE
Yeah.
CARTMAN
Wait, what? What the fuck is a sue-ance?
[Colorado State Courthouse. A news reporter is standing outside the building.]
REPORTER 2
Tom, I'm standing outside the South Park courthouse where experts have successfully summoned the ghost of toilet inventor Sir John Harrington. Now that the spirit has crossed over from the dead, lawyers are gonna try and sue him.
[The court. A trial is hold. The judge has a bored look on his face.]
ATTORNEY
Sir Thomas Harrington, your extreme negligence has cost tax payers millions.
SPIRIT
No! No!
ATTORNEY
You will be sued, spirit. Thy liability is without question. [the table before the attorney moves. Jimmy, Clyde, Cartman, Stan and Kyle are shown sitting there.] Appear before this court, Harrington.
SPIRIT
Never!
ATTORNEY
Quick, everyone, get our all your money. [the light goes out and the table rocks. A bright light appears above the judge accompanied by an echoed voice. It turns out to be Betsy's ghost.]
BETSY
Clyde? Clyde?
CLYDE
Mom?
BETSY
[points to the attorney] This lawyer is a fraud. He has been swindling you and your friends for your money.
ATTORNEY
Fuck me, it's a ghost.
BETSY
You can't sue the dead, Clyde. Putting the toilet seat down is a matter of simple etiquette. It's common sense, Clyde!
CARTMAN
Oh boy, here we go.
BETSY
Don't try and blame mommy's death on anything but your failure to something I have asked you time and time again to do. [camera pans to Clyde] It's your fault!
SPIRIT 2
[offscreen] Now hold on a second! It's not anyone's fault. [everyone turns to the root of the sound. A spirit enters the court] I am sick an tired of all this nonsense over my porcelain toilet machine.
P. SANCHEZ
There he is, Sir John Harrington.
MR. GARRISON
Quick, sue him!
SIR HARRINGTON
You can't sue me. [approaches to the toilet cabinet located in the court] You're all using my toilet invention the wrong way. [camera pans to the TSA agents who look at each other] When you have to sit and take a Sir Harrington, you're supposed to be facing this way. [sits on it backwards, just like the way Butters did] So you can use the little shelf for your books, and your quill and your ink.
BUTTERS
A-ha! I told you you should sit on it that way! I told you!
SIR HARRINGTON
Why would I design it so that when you're finished taking a Sir Harrington, you have to stand up, turn around and look down right at your Harrington to flush?! That's gross!
RANDY
Well, yeah, but... but if you sit on it that way, you have to take your pants all the way off.
SIR HARRINGTON
Of course! Why do you think I designed toilet rooms with a laundry hole? [points to the hole in the cabin]
RANDY
Oh, that's what that hole is for? Oh. [the people in the room join] Oops.
[The Cartman house, night. Cartman is lying on the bed in his pajamas while cutting his toenails, just like the beginning of the episode. He is talking on the phone.]
CARTMAN
So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like "Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole!" And Clyde is all like "Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please!" Dude, it was a riot.
[Clyde is reading a comic book on a shelf while holding the receiver on his ear.]
CLYDE
That's not what I said.
CARTMAN
Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?
[Clyde is sitting on the toilet... backwards, and peeing.]
CARTMAN
[his voice comes through the receiver] Clyde, you there? Hello? [Clyde comes off the toilet, flushing it. He waits for a few seconds, then angrily puts the seat up, and leaves the bathroom while flipping off his mother pointing upwards.]
End of Reverse Cowgirl


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Cartman launches his own gem shopping channel.

script:Cash For Gold

[Looming Sunset Assisted Living center, day. We can surmise from this that Grandpa Marsh was put in this home when Sharon and Randy divorced shortly after Stan's 10th birthday. The family stops by for a visit.]
RANDY
Well, Dad, it was really great seeing you. We'd love to stay for dinner, but the food here gives Sharon diarrhea.
SHARON
What?! Randy!
RANDY
[shushes her] Just trying to leave without being rude.
MARVIN
[rolls over to a small table next to the TV. There's a gift-wrapped box on it] Hold on, hold on just a second. I got a present for my grandson. [gets the box and wheels back to the family] Come here, Billy. [meets Stan in the middle of the room] You've grown up, Billy. It's time for you to have somethin' expensive and flashy [Stan smiles and glances back at his parents], to impress all the ladies [Stan takes the gift from him, then looks back at his parents].
SHARON
Go ahead and open it, Stan. [Stan opens the gift as Shelly and his parents surround him. Sharon kneels behind him and looks over his shoulder] Ohoho look at that! A bolo tie! Isn't that beautiful, Stan? [she puts it on him - gold base, turquoise center, diamonds surrounding it (12 small, 24 tiny)]
MARVIN
That's 14 karat gold, with turquoise and reeeal diamonds.
RANDY
[approaches Marvin] Grandpa, how much did you spend on that?
MARVIN
Six thousand dollars.
RANDY
Six thousand?!
MARVIN
It's worth fifty thousand. The Jewels and Gems Shopping Network said so.
RANDY
Dad, you shouldn't be spending your retirement money on frivolous things! You should be saving it for when you die. That's our money!
SHARON
It's gorgeous, Dad, thank you. Oh, and tomorrow's picture day at school! Stan can wear it for his photo!
MARVIN
Oh, that's wonderful! That'll make me feel reeeally good. Who's Stan?
[The bus stop, next day. It's picture day! Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny are waiting at the bus stop. Stan approaches, wearing the bolo tie, and stands next to the other boys. Cartman studies him at length]
CARTMAN
Nice bolo tie, Stan.
STAN
[looks away to avoid eye contact] Thanks. [Kyle takes notice]
CARTMAN
Bolo ties are... [quickly glances at Kyle] really in right now. Cool you have one.
STAN
[annoyed] Look, it was a gift from my grandpa, okay? And it cost a lot of money.
CARTMAN
No, dude, it's... badass.
STAN
[angered] It happens to be worth six thousand dollars!
KYLE
That... was six grand?
STAN
Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V.
CARTMAN
...Dude, it's fucking gay as fuck.
STAN
[finally breaks, facepalming] I know! [lowers his right arm] I really wish if my grandpa wanted to give me something, he'd just give me the money!
KYLE
Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says "Cash For Gold and Jewelry." There must be a lot of people doin' it.
[Downtown South Park, the jewelry district, day. Outside a Cash For Gold store a man spins a sign around with his hands. Inside, behind a bullet-proof partition, a clerk looks the bolo over with a jeweler's scope]
CLERK 1
You didn't steal this, did you?
STAN
No, my grandpa gave to me as a present. But it's worth so much I reel really bad accepting it, so I just want the cash.
CLERK 1
[does some calculations on his computer] It's 14-karat gold, diamond and turquoise. I'll give you fifteen dollars.
STAN
...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside.
CLERK 1
Yeah, I can't really make anything on the diamonds. I'd have to send it to a smelter, have it all smelted down for the gold, probably could make a ten-dollar profit.
STAN
Fifteen bucks?!
KYLE
Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else!
STAN
Yeah, I'm not gettin' taken advantage of! [takes back the bolo tie]
CARTMAN
You may suck our collective balls, sir! [they leave the store, turn right and walk]
KYLE
Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere.
STAN
Yeah! Here's one. [turns into the next store past the empty lot. The man outside is wearing a signboard]
[Inside the second store, a fat blonde woman looks the bolo tie over]
CLERK 2
These are real diamonds, right?
STAN
Yeah dude, you can test them.
CLERK 2
Okay. Eight dollars.
STAN
[stunned, then angry] This is the same bolo tie worn by King Henry V!
CLERK 2
[looks it over again] Nine dollars.
[Taco Bell, day. No go at the second store, so the boys come here. Outside, a man twirls a sign around which also points to Taco Bell as a cash for gold and jewelry store. The boys go in and get the bolo tie appraised]
CLERK 3
Welcome to Taco Bell. Would you like to try our Doritos Locos Tacos?
STAN
I wanna see how much you'll give me for this gold and turquoise diamond bolo. [hands the bolo to the clerk. The clerk looks it over, brings out his own pocket scope, and looks it over more closely]
CLERK 3
Fourteen-karat gold gets yaaa $14 a gram on the open market, got about... 4 grams here... [puts his scope away] It's not really worth my time. I guess I can give you a six-layer burrito for it.
STAN
A six-layer burrito?
KYLE
You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito!
CLERK 3
Alright, a seven-layer burrito! But that's as high as I'm going!
[Outside Taco Bell, sitting on a curb]
STAN
Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen?
[J&G Shopping Network, Jewelry Bonanza with DEAN, Channel 233. The show is already in progress. Dean, dressed in a white Western shirt, shows off his wares]
DEAN
Okay, folks, we are com-, half-way complete with today's broadcast. [scratches his nose] You wanna get in on these deals, call now. Next item is... This is item number 4 5 7 8 1 1 1. [switch to a close-up] Look at these stunning earrings. These are genuine faux sapphire earrings. Fourteen karat gold, 86 carat faux sapphire. Faux is a French word. Got an x in it, but you don't need to pronounce the x. How do you like that for prestigious? These earrings normally go for $6,000,000. We're gonna sell these today fer... [purses his lips together and exhales through them] $320!That's a steal. Now th-oh, there go the phones, they're lightin' up. I believe we have a sale? Do we have a sale? Yea- let's get her on the line. Hello? Who am I speakin' with?
VIVIAN
Hello... my name is... Vivian.
DEAN
Vivian, you just got a heck of a deal. What's your last name, sweetheart?
VIVIAN
Oh I... I can't remember.
DEAN
You can't remember. Well can you remember your credit card number?
VIVIAN
3 7 1 5-
DEAN
Hold on, Vivian, we'll get you on with a rep, take down that number. Thanks for shoppin' with us and congratulations on the lovely 14 karat gold sapphire earrings. At that price you practically stole them from us. Ouch. Okay-
[Cartman's house, day. The boys are looking at Jewelry Bonanza in the living room and have just seen an old woman get swindled out of her money]
KYLE
Dude, that's terrible!
CARTMAN
I told you guys. I've been watching all day.
STAN
But, how do they get away with that?
CARTMAN
This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend. [walks out]
STAN
What are you talking about?
CARTMAN
[standing next to a covered mobile whiteboard] For centuries alchemists have tried to come up with a formula to make gold. Whoever could do it would of course become rich, and now-! The chemical equation is right before our eyes. [unveils the equation]
KYLE
That's the chemical equation for gold?
CARTMAN
That's right. [goes through and denotes what each letter means] Guys with Cash For Gold Signs gets you People's Unwanted Crappy Jewelry, which when added to a Cable-Based Shopping Network divided by Demented Old people equals... Gold. [writes in an equal sign and "GOLD" at the end]
KYLE
...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?
KENNY
(Shut the fuck up, dude! You're a fuckin' asshole!)
CARTMAN
Oh, I'm an asshole for doin' math!
DEAN
Oh my gosh, can you believe this? Somebody's about to get this $20,000 topaz and copper ring for just four thousand bucks. [a close-up of the ring] We've got our buyer on the line. You buyin' this as a gift, sir?
CALLER
No, I'm buying it as a gift! For my grandson Billy!
STAN
Grandpa? [gets off the sofa and runs out the front door]
[Looming Sunset Assisted Living, night. Marvin is watching Jewely Bonanza. Onscreen is a necklace with a large emerald on it]
DEAN
How about that, folks? That is Brazilian emerald, finest emerald available. We're letting this oen go fer... fourteen ninety five [$1495.00 onscreen], EZ Pay. We call it that to save you time. EZ is an abbreviation of easy. Fourteen ninety five, EZ Pay an... What's that? Okay, alright, I just got word, we are droppin' the Z from EZ Pay. It's now just E Pay. [onscreen EZ Pay is erased, then E Pay appears] By usin' the word E Pay instead of takin' all that time to say EZ Pay, we're savin' you a second of time, and those seconds add up. Go ahead and try it: say E Pay five thousand times. That's five thousand seconds, nine hours... we just saved you here on J&G Shoppin' Network. [Grandpa's eyes begin to wander] Not wastin' your time here, you can't afford not to buy this one. You don't have a lot of time left. Literally. Pass this one down to your kids, your grandkids. [Stan appears at the doorway] Show 'em your life had meaning.
STAN
Grandpa.
MARVIN
[turns his head to the left to look at Stan] Well you see that, Billy? That's an emerald on 14 karat gold. Don't you think your sister would like that? [smiles]
STAN
She doesn't like jewelry, Grandpa.
MARVIN
Ha! Well she will one day. She'll appreciate it. She's, she's just a baby after all.
STAN
She's not a baby, Grandpa, she's thirteen.
MARVIN
Shelly's thirteen? Rihight. Right, boy... [faces the TV again, visibly shaken] Billy, did I ever tell you I used to have a border collie named Patches?
STAN
Yes, Grandpa.
MARVIN
[reminiscing with a smile] I loved that dog. She always made me so happy. When she died, I... I didn't let myself get too sad, 'cause I thought, thought I'd always have the memory of her slobberin' happy face. [the smile disappears] I can't remember what she looked like, Billy... Huh. Huohh. [gets a headache and rests his head on his left hand]
STAN
Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm gonna take care of this! [turns to his left and leaves with determination. Marvin is left looking distressed]
[South Park Elementary, playground, day. During recess, Butters twirls a sign around, while Cartman is decked out in all sorts of jewelry.]
CARTMAN
Hey Craig. Goin' on? Tolkien! Bet your mom has some old jewelry she wouldn't notice missing. Bebe! You got those rhinestones in your earrings, I'll have some walking cash! I can probably offer you a-
BUTTERS
[loses control of the sign] Whoops! [it lands face up on the snow]
CARTMAN
[quickly analyzing the situation] Butters, what the fuck?!
BUTTERS
[winces, then massages his right arm] Sorry. My arms hurt.
CARTMAN
"My arms hurt." Pick the fucking sign up, Butters! This is a business! [Butters picks the sign up and resumes twirling]
LEROY
Hey! How much will you give me for this? [shows him a ring with a huge rock on it]
CARTMAN
Oh ahhhh, three bucks.
LEROY
Okay. [gives the ring to Cartman, who transfers it to his left hand. Cartman reaches into his back pocket and give Leroy the three dollars. Leroy turns and walks away]
CARTMAN
We got crappy jewelry Butters. Now all we need are some old people.
[Jewelry Bonanza.]
DEAN
And that's it, we just sold this bracelet to Ms. Marcia Tubbs. Marcia, thank you so much for your call. You just got yourself a heck of a deal on this one. You there Marcia?
MARCIA
[over the phone] Yes. [a car honks at her] I'm lost. I'm lost walkin' on the freeway.
DEAN
Alright, you're lost walkin' on the freeway? Enjoy the Tiger's Eye Aquamarine bracelet. Alri- okay, what should we do next? Oh I see one. Here's a good'un. Lemme... [picks out a ring with a large yellow stone in the middle] Lemme... lemme set the stage for you here: you're goin' to that seniors' cocktail party? It's bingo night and you're lookin' for somethin' to wear? How about a 13 carat panzoto-panzanite ring. This is-oh! We got a caller already on this one! Hello sir, you must be a fan of panzoto-panzanite.
STAN
Yeah, hi. Um, you should kill yourself?
DEAN
...What's that?
STAN
I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself?
DEAN
Okay, we're gonna sell this ring for just thirty-seven ninety five. [$3,795.00 onscreen] How's that? [puts the ring onto a woman's right ring finger.]
STAN
I just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up Social Security checks? Kill yourself.
DEAN
Alright, well you shouldn't say things like that 'cause... some host of a jewelry channel sure might up and do it, and then you'd feel really bad.
STAN
No I wouldn't.
DEAN
Yes you would.
STAN
No, because I really want you to kill yourself.
DEAN
Alright, well how about this?! If a jewelry network host goes home tonight and blows the brains out, you might be liable. That's a lawsuit worth ...2.7 million dollars? How's that sound?
STAN
I don't care what happens to me, I care about my grandfather, you morally empty corrupted maggot!
DEAN
[long silence as the jewelry carousel goes around] Alright, I tell you what: I'll bring the lawsuit down to twenty-nine thirty-nine- [the $6,000,000 is erased and replaced by $2,939.00]
STAN
Nono, uh it doesn't matter what price you put on anything! Your only chance to right the wrongs you've done, and repay all the elderly people whose lives you've destroyed, is to kill yourself.
DEAN
[another long silence, then he clears his throat] Well, you think it's funny, but that's, that's callin' up and tellin' someone to kill themselves; that's not a joke.
STAN
I'm not joking. [pause] Do it.
[Eric Jewelry Cavalcade, with Eric. Now on the Old People's Shopping Network, founded by Eric Cartman. He's in his basement, behind a table with his own props and jewelry]
CARTMAN
Okay, next item? Next item we're gonna do is uh, 5 5 2 1 6 uh 7, 7 5, 5 [actually 55-26177] This is-oh my God, look at this you guys. [shows off the ring Leroy sold him earlier] This is 200 carat Brazilian emerald and plasticine ring. I'm gonna start bidding for this ring at, um, let's see, eight billion dollars. Eight billion dollars, opening bid. We've gotta sell this ring today. Tell you what, I'm gonna take it down a little. We're gonna drop that price down to... $75.95. At this price it's not gonna last for lo-oh, we got a caller already, Butters? Butters? Look like- Did we sell it? Yep, seventy-five ninety-five, that's what the ring just sold for. Do we have the buyer on the line? Hello?
CALLER
Hello?
CARTMAN
YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...?
MRS. APPLEBY
This is Mrs. Appleby on 24 Palmark Lane?
CARTMAN
Can I ask you something, Mrs. Appleby? Do you like fucking little boys?
MRS. APPLEBY
[long pause] I'm sorry?
CARTMAN
Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that's what you just did with this deal. You just got an $8,000,000,000 ring for seventy-five ninety-five. You fucked me good, Mrs. Appleby. Congratulations, ma'am.
MRS. APPLEBY
Thank you.
CARTMAN
Were you just flippin' through the channels and saw me selling this ring and thought "Hm, I'd like to fuck that kid!"
MRS. APPLEBY
...I thought it'd be a lovely gift for my granddaughter Jessica. She's captain of the debate team at Jefferson High School. see-
CARTMAN
Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth.
MRS. APPLEBY
Goodbye.
CARTMAN
Bye! Man that's good acting. I should get an award.
[A smelting plant. Shown is the Oscar for Best Actor: Sean Penn in Milk. The camera pulls back to reveal a pile of gold jewelry on which the Oscar sits. A shovel comes in and scoops it up with some other jewelry. The worker holding the shovel moves it to a vat of molten gold and dumps the jewelry into the vat. Escaping air makes a fart sound as the jewelry sinks into liquid gold, and then some bubbles popping follow]
STAN
Do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories?! No! Because you don't have someone in your life suffering from Alzheimer's! Well I do!
MANAGER
Look, kid, if you've got a beef with the system, you're talkin' to the wrong people. All we do is smelter down what we get from the cash for gold places.
STAN
Yeah?! Well there's an old Hindu saying: "Whoever smelt it, dealt it!"
KYLE
Yeah!
KENNY
(Fuck yeah!)
MANAGER
We aren't the ones who denied you what your jewelry was really worth. The Hindu saying is actually "Mayii nahii chahatapahnii"
KYLE
What does that mean?
MANAGER
"Whoever denied it, [lowers his voice] supplied it." [the boys are stunned]
[The neighborhood park, day. Stan is now on a crusade to stop this madness, but he hasn't found the right target. Kyle has his arms crossed]
STAN
YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions!
BUTTERS
[looks around at his fellow sign twirlers] We aren't makin' that much, fellas.
STAN
You're not?
TWIRLER 1
Who don't you yell at the people who melt the gold down? The old Hindu saying is "Whever smelt it dealt it" [other twirlers agree with him: "Yeah!" "That's right!"]
KYLE
[leans forward] Nuh uh! It's "Whoever denied it, supplied it!"
TWIRLER 2
You got it all wrong. The jewelry that those shopping networks sell don't even come from us! It's all made in India, where those Hindu rhymes come from!
TWIRLER 3
What are you saying, Gustav? My God, do you mean?
TWIRLER 4
That's right. Whoever made the rhyme did the crime.
[Gems Wholesale, day. Cartman walks by with a briefcase]
CARTMAN
Suck my balls, suck my balls... [enters the store] Hello!
CLERK 4
[An Asian woman] Ohhhh welcoooome! Welcome to discount jewelry stohhhhh! [her two assistants join her as Cartman takes a seat at the counter]
CARTMAN
[shoves his briefcase to one side] Yeah, listen, I'm running a resale business, but I can't get enough of people's unwanted crappy jewelry to keep up, so I'd like to buy some of yours.
CLERK 4

CARTMAN
And uh, maybe I'll that one for three hundred.

Oh, that's best one! You so clevohh! [claps quickly a few times] You take advantage o'my low pricess! [claps a few times]
CARTMAN
How about that panzanite bracelet for nine ninety five.
CLERK 4
You got good eye, [points to her brain] You so clehhvahh. I getting taken advantaaage! You rike to fuck an Asian lady?
CARTMAN
[long pause] What d'ja say?
CLERK 4

CARTMAN
Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff?

CARTMAN
Okay, quit the act! I'm not fucking you and you know it!
CLERK 4
Nono, you fucked me!
CARTMAN
Nono, you fucked me! Fuck you!
[India Manufacturing, Inc., a rainy day somewhere in India. A taxi pulls up to the plant, with Cartman and Butters inside.]
CARTMAN
My balls, my balls, suck 'em dry...[Butters opens his door and hops out, then opens Cartman's door. Cartman looks around and clears his throat to get Butters' attention.]
BUTTERS
Oh sorry, sorry. [looks back at his seat and pulls out the sign. then points it at Cartman. Cartman then hops out and proceeds to the plant, with Butters following]
[Inside the plant. All the workers here are children working in cubicles, assembling new jewelry. A supervisor walks by collecting newly finished jewelry in a metal box. The receptionist shows Cartman and Butters in while one boy is sealing packages in another room]
CARTMAN
[to the receptionist] You see, I'm looking to cut out the middle man. I want to buy my jewelry direct from you so that- [a disturbing sight stops him in his tracks] Motherfucker!
STAN
[railing at an older Indian boy] You should be ashamed of the people in America that you are exploiting! How dare you take advantage of those less fortunate?! [Kenny and Kyle are with him]
CARTMAN
[approaches the other boys] You dirty double-crossing assholes! You're trying to cut me out, huh?! You guys stole my formula, then tried to fuck me- Butters!
BUTTERS
Sorry! [catches up to him]
CARTMAN
-and then tried to fuck me out of your business!
KYLE
We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa!
CARTMAN
No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies!
STAN
Somebody is at the head of all this, and somebody needs to pay! All I want is some Goddamned retribution for my Goddamned grandpa! [the boy reaches for a necklace and offers it to Stan] No! Not a diamond-and-gold necklace! [the boy thinks about what to do with the necklace, then reaches for a small plastic pouch and puts it in. The boy motions to another boy]
KYLE
What's he doing?
[Montage. The boy tosses the necklace into a box being carried by another supervisor, then motions to someone else as the supervisor carries the box away. Outside, several workers load up a truck. The supervisor gives his box to one of the loaders. A planeload of jewelry leaves India and arrives at Atlanta. The box is then shipped by QDC to J&G headquarters. A J&G worker carries a gold ruby necklace to Dean at his Jewelry Bonanza set. He then puts the necklace on camera and sells it to an elderly woman who still lives at home. A FedExX truck arrives at her house and the driver delivers it to her personally. He tips his hat to her as he leaves. She opens the package right then and there, at her front door, and pulls out the necklace. She gives it to her daughter, who is quite happy to get it. The daughter goes to a Cash For Gold store and sells it to the clerk. He puts it into a box containing other jewelry, puts in more jewelry to fill the box up, then delivers it to an Industrial Smelting and Refining plant. He sells it to one of the workers there. The worker brings it into a room and splits the jewelry among his associates. They sort the gems by type as they dismantle the jewelry. The gold is sent to be melted down and made into gold bars. The gold and jewels are sent separately back to India, where an IPS truck goes to India Manufacturing to deliver the raw materials. The workers deliver the materials to the supervisors, who take them inside and distribute them among the child workers. The child workers assemble the raw materials into new jewelry, and the cycle starts again. Back in Atlanta, more packages are delivered to J&G headquarters by E-Z Delivery. A J&G worker delivers a gold amethyst necklace to Dean, who sells it to an elderly couple. An ADL truck arrives and the driver delivers it to the couple. The husband receives it and opens it. The driver tips his hat and leaves. The couple then offer the necklace to their daughter, who's overjoyed to get it. She and her husband take the necklace to a different cash for gold store and sell it to the clerk there. The necklace is dismantled into its various parts and the gold melted down again. IPS delivers the raw materials back to India Manufacturing. A supervisor dumps some gems onto the desk of a different child worker, who is working on a picture frame. He finishes the frame and walks up to the older boy. The older boy takes the picture frame to Stan and gives it to him.]
STAN
Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work.
[The park surrounding Looming Sunset, day. Stan is visiting Marvin, who's well enough to sit on the bench with him with the use of a cane]
STAN
So the we went to India, which is pretty cool I guess. I've never been there before. And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it.
MARVIN
Ahh, sounds like you had a fun weekend.
STAN
Yeah, I guess so. Anyway Grandpa, I wanted to give you something. [hands him the gift]
MARVIN
Oh, for me? [takes the gift and unwraps it] Oh! My God. There she is. [a picture of Grandpa in younger days with his dog] Old Patches. There's that slobberin' happy face! Thank you Billy. That means a lot. [they smile at each other for a moment] Billy, that... that bolo tie you're wearing?
STAN
Yeah.
MARVIN
I don't know where you got that, but it's fucking gay as fuck.
STAN
Cool. I, I won't wear it anymore.
MARVIN
That's a good idea. [looks back at the picture and smiles. Stan looks down and away]
[Jewelry Bonanza with Dean. Onscreen is a pair of earrings selling for $2800.00]
DEAN
Folks, these are not your ordinary peridot craponite earrings, these are 18-karat gold! and we got-oh, do we have a buyer on the line? Hello?
CALLER 1
[long pause] What are you waiting for? Kill yourself.
DEAN
Alright Goddamnit, we got another comedian. Ever since that little kid called up, now everybody wants to call and tell me I should kill myself.
CALLER 1
He was right. Do it.
DEAN
Folks, this is an 800 number. Every time you call and tell me to kill myself, it's costing us... two dollars and thirty six cents! So now, how about a caller who wants to buy jewelry ? Yes. Hello, sir?
CALLER 2
You're too scared to do it, aren't-cha? You don't have the balls.
DEAN
Goddamnit I'm not scared to do it.
CALLER 2
New, you're scared. You got, you got lady balls. [hangs up. The dial tone is heard and Dean moves on to the next call]
CALLER 3
Hello? I'm calling about the peridot earrings?
DEAN
Yes ma'am!
CALLER 3
They'd look good on your dead body. Why don't you kill yourself?
DEAN
Alright, that's that! That there's the- the straw that broke the camel's back! I got a gun right here; whattaya think about that?!
CALLER 3
Put it against your temple and pull the trigger. [long pause. The gun is cocked and then goes off. A thump is heard and blood lands all over the set. The soothing music plays on]
End of Cash For Gold

synopsis:The kids are in danger when new trends start to evolve and shift at a rapid pace.

script:Faith Hilling

[CNN Conference Room. Rick Santorum, Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul are standing behind their benches, debating. A loud applause is heard.]
MITT
I know the people are going to say, oh you should only practice it this way or that way.
RICK
I believe in capitalism too. I believe in capitalism for everybody.
NEW
What he said, which I find mildly amazing, was that he thought I would have a hard time debating Barack Obama.
RON
We faced something much much greater after World War II. [the camera pans to Stan, who is in the audience] We had ten million coming home at once. What did we do then? Some liberals said we need more work programs-
STAN
Tango, Tango, I'm in position.
KYLE
[offscreen] Copy, tango. Clear vantage point?
STAN
It will have to do. We're not getting closer.
KYLE
Alright, Butters. Bring it in.
BUTTERS
[going through a hallway with a trolley] Equipment is flying in, ten seconds.
KYLE
Copy that. 10 seconds, Cartman.
CARTMAN
[in a wooden dark place with two wires on the ground] I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go.
[The conference room is shown again. The audience applauds as Stan looks around. The Secret Service agents are shown.]
AGENT 1
We might have a problem.
AGENT 2
What's that?
AGENT 1
We just got word somebody might try to Faith Hill this event.
AGENT 2
Lock down the whole perimeter. Nobody is Faith Hilling, not on my watch! [raises his fists and walks away. The stage is shown through Stan's angle. Three other agents step on the stage.]
STAN
I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this. [Butters takes a plate from the trolley, which has an iPhone on it, and walks to the left. Meanwhile Kenny comes from the opposite direction, taking the iPhone and passing it to Stan.] I got it.
AGENT 3
Hey, somebody is under the stage.
KYLE
Go Cartman! [Cartman runs up and comes on the stage. He cheerfully pulls his shirt out near the nipple area. Stan takes a picture. Four agents come up to chase Cartman.]
[Outside the conference room. Butters, Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman run out.]
BUTTER
We got it. We got it!
STAN
Go, go, go.
CARTMAN
Hehe hehe, that was sweet you guys. [The agents run after them.]
[The news]
REPORTER
First, there was planking. [various images of people planking come up] People taking pictures of themselves in a planked position and putting the photos on the Internet. Planking was soon replaced by owling. [a picture of a boy with his knees drawn to his chest] And after the Super Bowl by Bradying. [New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady as well as an overweight man, both sitting on the ground with their legs straight out, hands clasped and looking down] But the newest meme involves pulling the shirt out to look like boobs. [Cartman pulling out his shirt at the debate is shown, this time fullscreen] It's called Faith Hilling. And all around the world people are doing it. [A black boy pulling his red shirt, then a ginger boy with a cap doing the exact same thing with his grey-and-white sweatshirt] Kids, adults, and even notable celebrities are getting into the act. [L.A. Lakers player Kobe Bryant is shown pulling on his jersey. The news studio comes to view again.] But as Faith Hilling is more and more popular, the question on everyone's mind, who will be the first to die doing it?
[South Park Elementary, day. The boys, along with the rest of the forth graders, are in a wooden room, being lectured by Professor Lamont.]
LAMONT
I have been sent here because you children are playing with fire! [the children are listening to him, Cartman has a bored look] Faith Hilling is nothing more than an evolution of Bradying. From football quarterback to football singer.
CARTMAN
Oh, please. Bradying is so 2000 and late.
LAMONT
[lowers the projector screen] I know you all think what you're doing is new and hip and cool. But the truth is memeing has been around a long time. We're gonna watch a film strip now, that's a little dated but I think it gets the point across. [turns the projector on to start the film]
[Warbly muzak is heard, as the film, 'BLOODY SUNDAY: The Dangers of MEMEING', begins. A man with an old style hair is sitting in a classroom with a outdated TV and a poster for the computer club which has a picture of an old computer.]
SPEAKER
For many young people today taking pictures in silly poses becomes a dangerous past time. The latest meme has also become the most deadly. It's called Tebowing [The caption TEBOWING appears in the middle of the screen].
[Residential area. Two boys are walking towards a grassy area leading to the railroad tracks. One of the boys has an iPhone in his hands.]
SPEAKER
[offscreen] This is Ryan and Barkley. They're about to learn how dangerous Tebowing can be.
RYAN
Here is a good place. I'll do it right here.
BARKLEY
I don't know, Ryan. You sure this is a good idea? [Ryan walks onto a railway]
RYAN
Stop being a scaredy-cat. It will just take a second. How could I get hurt? [kneels down and puts his right elbow on his right knee, closing his eyes as well as pinching his nose bridge]
BARKLEY
Okay, hold still. [puts up his iPhone. A train horn is heard.] What's that?
RYAN
A traaain! AAAAAA! [Barkley and Ryan continue to scream and look around while staying in the same position. The train is still off in the distance.]
BARKLEY
RYAN!
RYAN
No, no! Nooo!
BARKLEY
AAAA!!!
RYAN
AAAA!!!No, no, no, no, noooo!
BARKLEY
AAAA!!![The train finally comes at full force and hits Ryan, severing him in half and covering Barkley in blood.]
[South Park Elementary. Butters covers his face after seeing what just happened while the rest of the class is unfazed.]
BUTTERS
AAAA!!!
[Residential area. Barkley, covered in blood, stands at the railroad tracks and looks down in horror at Ryan's severed body]
BARKLEY
RYAN!
RYAN
Learn from me.[dies]
[Secluded area, nighttime. A young couple is sitting in a parked car.]
WOMAN 1
This sure is a nice car, Tommy. [raises her iPhone] Would you like to get a picture of me Tebowing in it?
TOMMY
Sure. [gets the iPhone to take her picture. As the woman poses, the train's headlight appears in the distance and its horn is heard.] What is that?
WOMAN 1
Oh my God! It's coming!
TOMMY
God, no! [he exits the car while she continues Tebowing inside, revealing that they parked on the railroad track] Aahh! No, no!
WOMAN 1
[scared] Tommy, d-did you get the picture?
TOMMY
Oh no, wait! Hold on! [hurriedly presses on the iPhone, then gets ready to take the picture]
WOMAN 1
Hurry, hurry!
TOMMY
AAAAA! [attempts to take the picture as the train comes closer]
WOMAN 1
AAAAA! [The train finally comes at full force and crushes the car as Tommy runs off. Her bloody, severed head then lands onto a dirt field next to the track and her mouth opens, letting out an audible scream] Aaah!
[South Park Elementary. Butters screams out in horror again while the rest of the class is still unfazed.]
BUTTERS
AAAA!!!
[A man wearing a yellow and red-stripped jacket and round sunglasses is looking upward and talking to his friend while holding an iPhone.]
MAN 1
Be careful up there, Pete.
PETE
[Tebowing on top of a wall with graffiti in a residential area] Just go on and take the picture. [the wall is suddenly destroyed by a train, killing Pete and knocking his friend down, before he quickly gets up and looks on in horror.]
[South Park Elementary. Butters screams out and covers his face again. Cartman now looks bored, while the rest of the class is still unfazed.]
BUTTERS
AAAA!!!
[The speaker in the old-fashioned classroom is shown.]
SPEAKER
These youths paid with their lives for Tebowing. When they posed for pictures they should have remembered there are only three approved memes: peace signs [puts his index and middle fingers up], bunny ears [raises his arm while keeping the previous gesture] and fake wiener [turns his body sideways, bends his left arm and leg] Maybe you think this doesn't apply to you. Maybe you think your memes are safe. Or maybe you're watching this in the future and Tebowing has been replaced by some other meme. Well, if you are watching his in the future, [a blue screen comes to view while the following words of the speaker gets typed] get off your flying cellphone scooters and THINK. Just remember--
[A photo of three teenagers from the 1980s standing outside under a tree is shown while the following lines are sung]
SINGERS
Use the approved poses if you want to be a memer.
Peace signs!
[A male teenager with a sweater and mustache puts his right middle and index fingers up in a V-shape]
Bunny ears!
[A female teenager smiles while putting her middle and index fingers in a V-shape behind the head of the previous male teenager]
Fake wiener!
[A male teenager wearing a neon colored windbreaker turns his body sideways and bends his left arm and leg]
[South Park Elementary. The fourth graders come out, almost all having concerned looks on their faces. Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Cartman and Butters walk together.]
CARTMAN
[yawns] Oh, God. That was boring.
KENNY
(Totally!)
KYLE
So, what do you want to do now?
CARTMAN
Well, there is the nice French café downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there.
STAN
Oh, that's a good idea.
BUTTERS
What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?
CARTMAN
Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation.
BUTTERS
Well, count me out.
KYLE
You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you?
BUTTERS
Well, I'm scared. [Craig shows up]
CRAIG
Hey, did you see today's newspaper?
CARTMAN
Why would we look at a newspaper, retard?
CRAIG
You guys made the front page.
CARTMAN
Really? [the boys excitedly run, except for Butters]
[The boys run in a liquor store.]
STAN
Dude, we are on the front page!
CARTMAN
Yes!
KENNY
(Yeah, dude!)
STAN
Can we get The Denver Post, please? [hands the clerk two dollars and gets the paper]
CARTMAN
What's it say, what's it say?
STAN
It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late.
CARTMAN
What? Let me see that. [the newspaper has Cartman's pictured and a headline 'Faith Hilling so 2,000 late']
KYLE
How can that be? Already?
STAN
[reads the newspaper] Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé.
KYLE
How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade.
STAN
[continues reading] "Faith Hilling is pretty stale," said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. "If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive."
CARTMAN
Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that?
[Cartman's computer screen. Various people sitting on their bare butts with their hands down between their legs are shown. Cartman is in front of the computer, with Stan and Kyle on his both sides and Kenny behind him.]
STAN
That's all it is? [Kenny moves to the left-hand side]
CARTMAN
You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog. [shows three other guys' pictures]
KYLE
But that's stupid. [Kenny moves to the right-hand side] How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense.
CARTMAN
I can't believe people take the time to do this garbage. [shows a couple of more pictures] This has to be stopped, you guys.
[Outside Café Monet, day. A boy is Taylor Swifting in front of the café. Two girls and a boy watch him as the boy pictures him with his iPhone.]
BOY 1
[giggles] Okay. Hold it there. Okay. That's good, don't move. [the iPhone screen is shown as Cartman photobombs while Faith Hilling.]
CARTMAN
How is this Kyle? This good? [the boy moves away a bit. The other kids are stunned. The boys stand next to them, Kyle having an iPhone in his hands]
KYLE
Yep, that's great. [glances at the other kids]
CARTMAN
[continues moving as the other boy tries to get past him] Cool, these will be good uploads.
BOY 2
Hey, what are you doing?
CARTMAN
Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
BOY 1
Oh God. Faith Hilling is so February 2012.
STAN
Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe.
BOY 2
[starts to crawl away] Come on guys. It's not worth it. We can do our Taylor Swifting somewhere else. [Cartman continues to cover his view] [to Cartman] Knock it off!
CARTMAN
Why don't you make me? [the boy punches him, Cartman responds by hitting him on the ground. Stan and Kyle begin to punch Boy 1 while Kenny attacks the girls.]
[South Park Elementary, day. The boys are in the wooden classroom again. Professor Lamont brings in a box, then pulls a gun out of it. He loads it with a bullet while the fourth graders bewilderingly watch him.]
LAMONT
Yesterday afternoon four kids went to the hospital for injuries resulting from memeing in front of a local cafe. [the boys glance at each other] Faith Hilling, Taylor Swifting. These are things that will get you killed! [puts the gun on Butters' desk] That's a loaded .38. How many of you think it's a smart idea to put a loaded .38 on a 9-year-old's desk? Well, if safety doesn't matter to you go ahead, pick the gun up.
BUTTERS
Oh, that's okay. I think...
LAMONT
Pick the gun up! You might as well. Swifting and Hilling is like playing with a loaded gun! Do you all understand my point?
KIDS
Yes, sir.
LAMONT
Good. Now put the gun in your mouth.
BUTTERS
HA?!
LAMONT
Hey! You're following plankers and Tebowers, so put a loaded gun in your mouth! DO IT! [Butters hesitantly puts the gun in his mouth] Everybody take a good look. [points to Butters] This is what you're doing every time you play with Internet memes. YOU ARE PLAYING ROULETTE WITH YOUR FUCKING LIVE! [A hawk is heard offscreen. Two men enter the classroom.]
MAN 2
Professor Lamont, we need to talk.
LAMONT
I will be right back. [leaves the classroom]
[The gym. The two men are seated at a table, pulling out files out of their briefcases.]
MAN 2
You're an expert on memes, Professor Lamont.
LAMONT
Yes, what is this about? [puts his bag on the table]
MAN 3
We need your expertise, sir.
MAN 2
Have you ever heard of another species, memeing on the Internet?
LAMONT
Another species? What are you talking about?
MAN 3
We were hoping perhaps you could help us understand... [types on his laptop] this. [turns around the laptop. Professor Lamont puts on his reading glasses to look at the screen, which shows various cats with breads around their heads.] Cats have started to put pictures of themselves on the Internet, with bread around their heads. Cat breading, it's called. It's just such an odd thing to do, we thought would you explain it to us.
LAMONT
They're evolving. Cats are evolving. [moves the cursor down to see more pictures]
MAN 3
Sorry?
LAMONT
There are two ways a species evolves. Physically from genes and culturally from memes. Just like genes, memes replicate, mutate and adapt.
MAN 2
We're having a hard time following you here.
LAMONT
[opens a book] Look. In the 70s there was fonzing. [the book page has two people's pictures with their thumbs up] Which replaced the outdated mustaching. [a guy with his index finger above his lips] In the 60s cultural ideas were passed on by everybody poodle-fisting. [people raising their fists up to the sky] But even that evolved from people ass wedging in the 40s. [the Nazis doing their trademark salute] Even before photographs humans memed for portraits. All the way back to the Egyptians who had pictures painted of themselves donkey ticking. [an Ancient Egypt painting]
MAN 2
You are saying cats are showing signs of evolution with their cat breading meme?
LAMONT
[walks to the front] If they're putting slices of bread on their heads and taking pictures, [takes his glasses off] they're proving to be almost as intelligent as we are. [dramatic music plays]
[The wooden classroom. The only person left there is Butters, who still has the gun in his mouth. He looks around for a moment, then looks down to the gun again.]
[The Cartman house, day. Mr. Kitty is sleeping over her cat tree. The boys come in, Cartman has a laptop in his hands, which shows a picture of Mr. Kitty cat breading.]
CARTMAN
Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this? [Mr. Kitty looks at him] You wanna tell me why you're putting pictures of yourself on the Internet with bread around your face? This is a bad kitty. Bad! You're taking the idea of Faith Hilling and making it stupid. Bad kitty. [closes his laptop and approaches Mr. Kitty] Bad Mr. Kitty. [Cartman hits Mr. Kitty with a stick. Mr. Kitty hisses, then paws at him.] Bad kitty! No more memeing! [walks away] Come on, guys. [the boys walk out of the room. Cartman turns his back to scold his cat again] Bad Mr. Kitty!
[The boys come out of Cartman's house.]
STAN
Well, I'm glad we took care of that.
KYLE
Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?
CARTMAN
I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting.
STAN
That's a cool idea
KENNY
[sighs] (Oh, fuck it, dude.) [walks away]
KYLE
W-what's the matter, Kenny?
KENNY
(I don't know. That seems quite pointless.)
STAN
What seems pointless?
KENNY
(Hey, just accept Faith Hilling is out of style!)
KYLE
Hey! [the boys approach Kenny] Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright?
KENNY
(Well,... ...and I can't take any of that!)
STAN
No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap.
CARTMAN
Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her.
[Breaking News.]
REPORTER
Two Boulder children died today while Oh Long Johnsoning in a battling cage. Oh Long Johnsonning is of course the latest Internet meme which involves putting oneself in a risky situation and then seeing how many times you can say "Oh Long Johnson" on video before getting out of the way.

BOY 3
You ready, you ready?
BOY 4

REPORTER
This latest Internet meme is shocking. But most shocking of all is the person who started the meme isn't a person at all, but a cat who seems to have no regard for people's safety.
[A video of a black cat moaning.]
CAT
Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.
REPORTER
The cat is now under arrest and awaiting trial for its part in the teenager's death.
[Café Monet, day. Stan crawls in, Taylor Swifting.]
STAN
Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.
BOY 1
[his fellows are standing besides him. He has an iPhone in his hands] Yeah, that's good. Now go back the other way.
STAN
[continues to crawl around] Oh Long Johnson, Oh Long- [he is confronted by Cartman, Kyle and Kenny]
CARTMAN
Dude, what's going on?
STAN
Oh, hey, guys. How's it going? [hurriedly puts his pants on]
KYLE
We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?
BOY 1
He's not Taylor Swifting, that's old stuff.
STAN
Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out.
CARTMAN
Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?
KYLE
Benedict Arnold. [the three boys walk away]
STAN
Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay? [the boys stop] You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back. [Kenny looks down]
KYLE
Kenny?
KENNY
[approaches Stan and the other boys] (I'm sorry guys. Faith Hilling is just a stupid fad, right?)
BOY 1
If you guys wanna keep Faith Hilling, I'm sure people are still doing it at the old folks home. [he and his friends walk away]
STAN
You will like this, Kenny. Pull down your pants. [Kenny pulls down his pants and starts crawling on his butt.]
KYLE
You guys are sellouts.
CARTMAN
[holds him] Come on, Kyle.
KYLE
You're freaking sellouts!
CARTMAN
It's okay, man, come on.
[An interrogation room. The two men from the gym stand behind Professor Lamont.]
LAMONT
What the hell do you think you're doing? Do you have any idea when you play with memes you're playing with fire? [the black cat is kept in a cage]
CAT
Oh Long Johnson.
LAMONT
Oh, very funny. People are dying out there. Is that what you want?
CAT
Oh Long Jeeea-
LAMONT
You cats want a war? Because that's what you're going to get!
CAT
Oh oh oh.
[A news reporter speaking.]
REPORTER 2
Long ago there was tebowing, which evolved into Faith Hilling. But the latest memeing craze, Swift-Johnsoning, may now also have its rival. [walks to a railway] A brand new meme, where people video themselves wearing trench coats and talking about the dangers of memeing. They call it "reporting". And safety officials say that it's dangerous and potentially fatal. [train horn] Oh! Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. [gets hit by the train]
[The wooden classroom, night. Butters is still sitting there with gun in his mouth, but now he's quite drowsy and barely keeps himself awake.]
[Cartman is Faith Hilling in front of a Planned Parenthood Clinic.]
KYLE
[has an iPhone in his hands] Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Bring the left titty out some more. [Cartman raises his left hand a bit] Yeah, yeah freeze there. [a man comes into view with his little son]
LITTLE BOY
What are those boys doing, daddy?
DAD
Oh, I think they're Faith Hilling, Bobby. It's a little before your time.
LITTLE BOY
How droll. [The man and boy leave the scene. Cartman and Kyle look down for a moment]
CARTMAN
Get a couple facing the other way, brah. [turns the other way]
KYLE
Yeah, good idea. [a doctor comes out of the clinic]
DOCTOR
Hey, you kids Faith Hilling in front of my clinic? 'Cause I got a couple of patients in here that could use a good time machine. [giggles] Get it? [goes back to his clinic. A man with a car sounds his horn]
MAN 4
Go back to the 90s! Faggooots!
KYLE
[approaches Cartman] We have to face it, Cartman.
CARTMAN
I know. I know Kyle. [stops lifting his "nipples" up]
KYLE
I really thought it was gonna last.
CARTMAN
I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change. [starts crying] The sun hurts my eyes. [wipes away his tears]
KYLE
It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean-
CARTMAN
No, no. It was kind of stupid, really.
KYLE
I-It's good that it became something else.
CARTMAN
And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff. [both of them sigh]

CAT
Oh Long Johnson. [the ambassador closes the door]
AMBASSADOR
I'm not sure but I think it said war between our species is inevitable, that evolution cannot be stopped and cats will rise. It said we cannot coexist and then said oh don piaaano and then and then something about seeing the streets of human cities running red with the blood of their children.
[An iPhone screen, camera app on. Cartman pulls up Mr. Kitty, who now has a bread around his head.]
STAN
[has the iPhone in his hands, while Kyle and Kenny stand next to him] Okay, that's good, a little higher.

REPORTER 3
With the inevitable species war looming, our country's brightest leaders have come together to debate and reason with the ambassador of cats. It's called putty-whistling. And the question on everyone's mind... Who will be the first person to die from it? [Rick, Mitt, Newt and the cat are standing behind their lecterns.]
MITT
W-well, you know, I ran for president four years ago. This was the position I described when I ran four years ago...
RICK
If you wanna be an American the first thing you should do is respect-
NEWT
To ask a very simple question. How big of a scale of change do we want in Washington.
CAT
Oh Long Johnson.
NEWT
I started working in the governor wing in 1974.
CAT
[Rick and Newt talk] Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Piaano.

Oh Long Johnson.
MITT
I have five sons, five daughters in law, sixteen grand kids, and they're the joy of my life.

Let's do this. [he runs to the hallway, where Kenny hands him Mr. Kitty. He goes to the stage with Mr. Kitty, and pulls down his pants as Stan is ready to record him. He then stops, thinking.]
KYLE
Cartman? Go, Cartman.
STAN
Come on, dude. Hurry.
CARTMAN
[softly] No. NOO! [puts his pants back on] I won't do it. I won't do it, you hear me! I'm better than this. [puts down Mr. Kitty] And to hell with you, Mr. Kitty. You're a bad kitty! Bad, bad kitty! It's time somebody stood up, and did the right thing. [he turns sideways and snaps his fingers a few times, then pulls up his shirt, Faith Hilling.]

'Cause I'm Faith Hilling 'til the day that I die.
REPORTER 3
And so in the face of war a little boy reminds us all what being human really means. The message is unclear. But it doesn't matter as long as you give the audience a song, celebrity bashing, and Republican hopefuls dancing around with boobies. It's called pandering and all over the country people are- [train horn] Oh! Oh Long Johns- [gets hit by the train]
End of Faith Hilling


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The town's big Easter Egg Hunt is in jeopardy when Cartman produces video evidence of a mysterious creature lurking in the woods.

script:Jewpacabra

[The Broflovski house, morning. Kyle, who has just woken up, comes out of his room yawning. He walks to the kitchen and begins to prepare cereal for himself.]
SHEILA
[talking to someone] Yes, yes, this whole coming week is the Jewish holiday of Passover. Yes, it's all about how Moses led the Hebrews out of Egypt. Very good! So on Friday, all Jewish people will celebrate Passover with a seder dinner. [Kyle takes his bowl and heads to the dining table] Because God commanded the Jews to only eat bread that hasn't been given yeast to rise.[he walks past the living room, where Cartman and Sheila are shown talking]
CARTMAN
Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?
SHEILA
Yes, yes, one week from seder dinner on Friday to the next Friday.
CARTMAN
Interesting, and why is it called Passover again? [Kyle stops and starts listening]
SHEILA
Well, because in ancient Egypt, God passed over the houses marked with the blood of a lamb. [Kyle rushes to the entrance]
CARTMAN
So interesting, wow. [he and Sheila are drinking tea]
KYLE
[to Cartman, angrily] Get out of here.
CARTMAN
Oh, hey, Kyle.
KYLE
Get. Outta here! [points his finger to the left]
CARTMAN
Well, I better be going. Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton.
SHEILA
Well, you're very welcome.
KYLE
[walks to him] What are you gonna do?
CARTMAN
Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?
KYLE
No?
CARTMAN
Alright, Kyle, listen. [comes forward with Kyle, then sighs] Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park.
KYLE
What does that have to do with Passover?
CARTMAN
All I can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable Passover ever. [Cartman announces the special within the episode] "Cartman's Passover Holiday Special", starring, THE JEWPACABRA! [creepy music plays]
[A large green park in a sunny day. People are decorating the park for Easter while children are on the line for Kids' Egg Hunt Signup]
ATTENDANT
Alright, next please. Signing up for the Easter egg hunt? [Stan is in the front of the line]
BUTTERS
[at the middle of the line] Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun!
CRAIG
Yeah, I can't wait for Sunday.
KENNY
(Me, too.)
CARTMAN
[anxious] Yeah, yeah, it should be a real blast, heh. I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up, that's all.
CRAIG
Jewpa what?
CARTMAN
Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything.
CRAIG
Okay. [to Tolkien and Kenny] So anyways, are they saying what time the event starts?
CARTMAN
Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.
BUTTERS
You mean it's like, like a monster?
CARTMAN
It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls...
TOLKIEN
Nuh-uh!
CARTMAN
[angrily points at him] Yeah-uh, Tolkien! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!
CLYDE
[offscreen] You guys, check this out! [Butters, Kenny, Craig and Tolkien go there to take a look. On the ground lies a dead bird.]
CARTMAN
[keeps the boys away] Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell.
BUTTERS
AAAAAAHHH! [scared as hell, flees]
CARTMAN
Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing.
KYLE
Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies.
CARTMAN
I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence?
KYLE
I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.
CARTMAN
Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.
KYLE
[sighs] If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!
[Butters in his bedroom, night. There is thunder and he is indeed scared a lot.]
BUTTERS
Lu lu lu, lu... N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up. [a loud peal of thunder] It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways.
CARTMAN
[standing on his bed with camera kit attached to him] Butters.
BUTTERS
AAAAAHHH!
CARTMAN
Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera.
BUTTERS
No, it's a school night!
CARTMAN
Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro! [Butters stammers a bit] I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real.
[A camera recording with a green filter. Butters and Cartman, both equipped as cameramen now, are hunting for a Jewpacabra in the forest. Their faces appear distorted in close-up shots.]
CARTMAN
Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in.
BUTTERS
You think Jewpacabra is here?
CARTMAN
Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here.
BUTTERS
Oh good. Maybe we scared it off?
CARTMAN
You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ. [a rustle comes through the bush] Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING! [to Butters] He's here somewhere.
BUTTERS
Oh God, I'm scared.
CARTMAN
JESUS IS A LIE!
BUTTERS
Eric, stop it!
CARTMAN
Shh! Help me call it out, Butters.
BUTTERS
I'm not saying Jesus is a lie!
CARTMAN
Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?! [Butters thinks] THERE IS NO CHRIST!
BUTTERS
Jesus is a lie?
CARTMAN
No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters?
BUTTERS
Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.
CARTMAN
Sh! You hear that?
BUTTERS
Oh, hamburgers.
[Sooper Foods, day. The president is speaking to someone while three of his employees stand behind him.]
PRESIDENT
We started Sooper Foods to give people a place to buy groceries that was fun and safe. We are not canceling our Easter Egg hunt because of some wild story!
CARTMAN
I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video. [connects his video camera to the TV] What I'm about to show you is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra. [moves away a bit] And you're the first to see it. [the video shot of Butters and Cartman from last night is played on the TV] This is just after 8 p.m. First we heard rustling in the bushes. Then a strange, animal-like scurrying sound. That's when we saw, this. [pauses] 'Kay wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... wait for it... wait for... [an abrupt rustle] right there! Did you see the Jewpacabra? I know, it's so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what it's seeing. Watch again. [plays that moment again] Wait for it... wait... there! [pauses to show the motion blurred animal that moves between bushes] Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us.
EMPLOYEE 1
That wasn't a dog?
CARTMAN
It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins.
EMPLOYEE 2
What?
CARTMAN
I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath. [the president walks to the window. Employee 1 follows him]
EMPLOYEE 1
Mr. Billings?
MR. BILLINGS
[sighs] There's two things that separate Sooper Foods from all the other grocery stores: Fun and safety. What do you think, Peters? What are the chances that this 'Jewpacabra' is real?
PETERS
I'm estimating somewhere around .000000001%.
MR. BILLINGS
[deep sigh] We can't afford to take that chance. Get this kid whatever he needs.
[Three helicopters of Sooper Foods are flying. Cartman, Mr. Billings and the third employee from the previous scene are in one of them. Cartman has a map in his hands.]
MR. BILLINGS
So where are we heading first?
CARTMAN
We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here. [points on the map]
MR. BILLINGS
The Bahamas?
CARTMAN
That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank.
[Cartman is slinding through a temple-shaped water slide, going through a shark tank.]
CARTMAN
Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe! [drops in a pool, then comes out]
[The three helicopters are heading for somewhere else. Cartman has a towel around his neck and is drying himself with a handkerchief as well as holding the map.]
MR. BILLINGS
Where to now?
CARTMAN
Now we head back to Colorado, here. [points on the map] We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it.
[Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization. Cartman leads Mr. Billings and his two employees to the building but is confronted by a pissed off Kyle.]
KYLE
Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!
CARTMAN
People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron.
KYLE
These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid.
CARTMAN
These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!
[Four dumb looking cryptozoologists are examining Cartman's video in their laboratory]
MATT
Look at its trajectory. It heads directly to the right. [highlights the blurred image of the supposed Jewpacabra]
CLIFF
It can't be human it's too low to the ground. What do you think, Bobo?
BOBO
Bobo thinks scary!
MATT
It's definitely something. I'm thinking a Sasquatch.
CLIFF
It's not big enough to be a Squatch.
MATT
So it's a baby Squatch?
CLIFF
That's what I'm thinking.
CARTMAN
I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.
MATT
Jewpacabra?
CARTMAN
It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy.
BOBO
Oh, Jewpacabra, that sounds scary!
CLIFF
But it makes total sense. If we rule out a human and a baby Sasquatch, Jewpacabra is all we really have left.
CARTMAN
Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified.
MR. BILLINGS
All the kids will be so disappointed.
BOBO
Whoa, look at this! I just did the heatie thermal thingie to the video! It's all orangie! [the image of Jewpacabra is colored in orange]
CLIFF
But it's supposed to be all yellow-y. My God! This really is proof of a Jewpacabra!
CARTMAN
Heh. What do you mean? [he is stunned]
CLIFF
We've never seen this before! It really is true!
CARTMAN
Well, I mean it could have just been a dog?
MATT
No it's impossible. Look at the zoomy in. If I drop image of a dog next to it... [drops an cut-out image of a dog] That thing is way to big to be a dog. And check out the thermals coming off of it.
BOBO
That's the thermals. They make a proof and the thermals!
MATT
That's right, Bobo. Whatever this thing is it's mean and angry as hell.
CARTMAN
Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive.
MATT
I'll tell you one thing, kid, you're pretty brave.
CARTMAN
Why?
CLIFF
'Cause you took the video of this thing. It's not gonna like that.
MATT
If it is a Jewpacabra, he's gonna be coming after you. [Cartman is scared a lot. Creepy music plays]
[Cartman's room, night. He is in his bed, frightened a lot, mimicing Butters' scene.]
CARTMAN
There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real. [loud thunder] Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah. [quickly makes a call with his cellphone] Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real? [Kyle is listening to him in his bed with his eyes half-closed] I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle?
KYLE
What are you doing?
CARTMAN
Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle? [Kyle hangs up and goes back to sleep. His phone rings again, causing him so throw it to the wall.]
[South Park Church, night. The church is decorated for Easter. Cartman is alone there, sitting on one of the pews. He is singing with a shaky voice as well as holding a rosary.]
CARTMAN
Jesus loves me this I know
'Cause Republicans tell me so
Little ones God will protect
'Cause letting kids be harmed is child neglect [speaks on his radio]
Everything still clear out there?
[Butters, Craig and Tolkien are guarding the church. They have a shotgun, a bat and a flashlight respectively.]
CARTMAN
[voice only] Guys?!
BUTTERS
It's all quiet out front, Eric.
CARTMAN
Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!
BUTTERS
He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes. [a boom breaks out. The three boys take to their heels, screaming]
CARTMAN
[in the church] What? What was that? Butters? Tolkien?! [the door is forced] Oh Jesus Christ! You guys?! Aghgh! [quickly hides between the candle stands] You guys?! GUYS!
BUTTERS
[though the radio] Hey, Eric.
CARTMAN
It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?
BUTTERS
Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet. [he is definitely at Wingstreet, and Craig and Tolkien are buying some meal]
CARTMAN
Wingstreet?!
BUTTERS
Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.
CARTMAN
Dude, I want wings! [there is some knocking on another door] Ahghgh!!! [it turns out to be Mr. Billings and his two employees.] Oh Jesus, it's only you!
MR. BILLINGS
Alright, grab him.
CARTMAN
HUH?!
EMPLOYEE 3
You say the Jewpacabra hunts for anything Easter, and now it's looking for you. [the two employees take him away]
[Cartman, in his Easter bunny costume, is chained to a rock in the park, holding a basket.]
CARTMAN
Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP!
MR. BILLINGS
Look, we're sorry. But if it's you that Jewpacabra wants, we don't have a choice.
CARTMAN
OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME! [Employee 3 brushes his face with the blood of a chicken which is in the bucket he holds] What the-?
MR. BILLINGS
Just a little blood to try and draw it out. We just can't risk the creature showing up tomorrow. Our entire business is based on fun and safety.
CARTMAN
This isn't safe or fun!
MR. BILLING
Maybe it won't even show up. Maybe we'll all make it out of this okay? [a howl is heard] Oh fuck, we better get out of here. [Mr. Billings and his employees flee away]
CARTMAN
NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!
[The Broflovski house, night. The doorbell rings, Kyle gets the door. It it Mr. Billings and his employees.]
MR. BILLINGS
Hello young man. Let me start off by saying Sooper Foods is absolutely not an anti-semitic company. [Kyle just looks] But... if your people do have a monster creature that feeds on Easter children, we just wanted to let you know there is a sacrifice for it in the park that is totally fun and safe to eat. Thank you. [the three walk away. Kyle looks behind them]
[It is surely cold out there and snowing. Cartman is despairingly weeping and collecting the Easter eggs he can find. Kyle shows up, Cartman notices.]
CARTMAN
[smiles] Kyle! Hey, Kyle! [Kyle looks at him with his eyes half-closed] I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance.
KYLE
Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.
CARTMAN
Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble! [Kyle frowns and walks away] No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money! [softly] Oh God, what am I doing? [shouts] I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke! [softly] Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble.
[It's fullmoon and the snow has stopped. Cartman is still in the park, now sitting on the ground.]
CARTMAN
It's so cool that even though I'm Christian I celebrate Passover too! Yup. I think both holidays are awesome. [he is peeked by a pair of red slanted eyes with a snoring effect.] I really sympathize with those Jews in Ancient Egypt! I really do! [the pair of eyes turn out to be binoculars used by Bobo.]
CLIFF
What'dya think, Bobo?
BOBO
No doubt about it! It's a three foot tall bunny-man!
MATT
I told you! Bunny people must be a throwback to paleotardic times! Shoot it Bobo!
BOBO
Bobo shoot it! [he comes forward to aim, Cartman notices]
CARTMAN
Bobo?! Bobo, no! [Bobo fires a dart] Wha- [falls over]
BOBO
[dances cheerfully] Bobo got it! Bobo got the bunnymaaan!
MATT
Good shot, Bobo!
CLIFF
Now what do we do?
MATT
I know. Let's go get a show about it on Animal Planet.
CLIFF
Good idea. [they start walking] Wait wait wait wait. We're gonna need to take the evidence.
BOBO
Alright. [takes the dart gun] I got the evidence right here. The dart gun I shot the bunnyman with.
MATT
Alright! Come on, let's go!
CARTMAN
[seems to be having a dream] Ugh... what... where...
[Cartman is shown in Ancient Egypt, dressed as a prince. A huge fly lands in front of him. He turns out to be in the middle of the biblical plagues.]
CARTMAN
Ugh... what? [stands up] What's going on?
MAN 1
The plagues! The plagues are upon us! Run!
[It starts to rain frogs. Cartman runs away]
CARTMAN
It's raining frogggggsss! [finds Kyle, who is clinbing to the roof of his house on a ladder] Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs?
KYLE
[bangs a nail into a piece of wood] Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.
CARTMAN
So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.
KYLE
That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!
CARTMAN
Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind.
KYLE
It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!
CARTMAN
What does that mean?
KYLE
It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.
CARTMAN
Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?
KYLE
That's just how God is.
CARTMAN
You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick! [Kyle gets angry]
[The Pharaoh is sitting in his balcony, seemingly in deep thought. Cartman approaches, then sits next to him.]
CARTMAN
Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs?
PHARAOH
It'll be okay, my son. The weather will clear.
CARTMAN
But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave.
PHARAOH
[sighs] It's a complicated political issue, my son. An economic social issue that needs time. We can't let them leave, but is it really all that different from when the north didn't let the confederate states leave the USA?
CARTMAN
Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that. [a bloody frog lands over the edge]
PHARAOH
Poor frogs. I feel so badly for them.
CARTMAN
But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys.
PHARAOH
Hah, I don't think God would do such a thing, little one. No matter what happens, we can't let ourselves believe in the Hebrew version of God. We believe in a just Lord who would never murder innocent children.
CARTMAN
I love you, dad.
PHARAOH
And I love you son. And our love grows.
CARTMAN
And our love grows
BOTH
And our love grows
Like the mighty river of the Nileriver of the Nile
See it flow
We'll never be apart
CARTMAN
Have no fear, for God is near
And God loves all his children
[he pats a lamb, but it is taken away by Gerald] Huh? [Sheila slices the lamb's head] Nooooooo! [Sheila and Gerald apply the lamb's blood to their door. Kyle watches them] Kyle, why? What are you doing?
KYLE
This is what God told us to do!
CARTMAN
No, Kyle! I don't believe you!
KYLE
You'll see! [Cartman runs away but realizes other families are also doing it. He runs though the corpses of lambs]
CARTMAN
Noooo! [goes inside somewhere, but sees two kids with bloody eyes]
KID 1
What's happening to us? [both of the kids puke blood and fall over]
CARTMAN
Noooooo! [runs past a mom and her child]
CHILD
Mom! Don't let God kill me! [his head explodes and his mom screams]
CARTMAN
Noooo! [he is confronted by a man]
MAN 2
[holds out a flat sandwich] Care for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?!
CARTMAN
No! The bread's all flat! No! [shoves the bread down and keeps running] Aaaaahhhh! [the Pharaoh has kneeled down. All children around him have their heads explode. Screaming and shouting can be heard in the background]
PHARAOH
Son! We were wrong! I WAS WRONG!
CARTMAN
We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...! [his head explodes, and the Pharaoh crys in despair]
[Cartman is shown in reality again. He is in the park, unconscious.]
CARTMAN
[sleeptalking] No! No! The bread is all flat! No!
[The Broflovski house, night. Kyle is uncomfortable in his bed. He ultimately gets up and heads to the park with a blanket and bolt cutters. He frowns when he finds Cartman who is shaking and slowly saying to himself "Nooo... Nooo...". He puts the blanket on him and breaks the chains with the bolt cutters. He takes Cartman to his house, putting him in his bed and taking his shoes off. Touching music plays during these events.]
[South Park Easter Egg Hunt, morning. The audience applauds while Mr. Billings is giving his speech]
MR. BILLINGS
There are two things people think about when they are grocery shopping: Fun and Safety. On this beautiful Easter morning, we are thrilled to give back to he people of South Park who for the third year in a row have made our grocery store number... [looks on his paper] 4 in fun and number 6 in safety. Let the hunt begin. [The woman employee cuts the ribbon to allow children to the hunt. They excitedly run all over the place looking for eggs. Some of them attack and fight each other.]
CARTMAN
[offscreen] I'm alive! [everyone stops. Cartman runs in, gasping for air.] I'm alive, you guys. [holds Emily though her shoulders] I don't know how, but I'm alive! [lets go and keeps running] Can you believe it? It's a miracle. [runs to the stage] Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah, I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learned a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ.
BUTTERS
[angrily] Oh, stop trying to ruin Easter, you... You heathen! [the crowd agrees, then resumes their hunting]
CARTMAN
Hey guys, listen! [Nobody cares. He finds Kyle standing there, approaches him, and lets out a deep sigh.] I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Knowing your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe.
KYLE
Yeah.
CARTMAN
I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying.
KYLE
[puts his arm around him and smiles] I know, you're not.
CARTMAN
Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle, happy Passover.
KYLE
[flatly] Happy Passover, Cartman. [the camera moves up to the sun, which now has a Star of David at the center of it.]
End of Jewpacabra


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Butters is the victim of an unlikely bully.

script:Butterballs

[South Park Elementary Cafeteria, lunchtime. Five boys are seated at a table: Cartman and Kyle on one side; Craig, Kenny, and Stan on the other. There's room for a third boy next to Kyle]
CARTMAN
Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all "my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that." But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay? [the boys ignore him and continue eating] See? You can't remember.
BUTTERS
[walks in with a black right eye] Heh, h-hey fellas. [takes the remaining spot. Stan, Kenny, and Craig look at each other.]
KYLE
Where's your lunch, Butters?
BUTTERS
OH. [looks around nervously] Uh, it's okay. Um I'm not hungry anyways.
STAN
Dude, did a bully take your lunch money again?
BUTTERS
...Yeah. [looks down at the table]
STAN
That's the third day in a row. You gotta tell the teacher.
BUTTERS
Naw, I'm not a tattle-tale.
STAN
Well then write the principal an anonymous letter.
BUTTERS
Naw, I'm not no Anonymous Andy.
CRAIG
So then just get a bigger bully to beat the bully up.
BUTTERS
Naw, I don't want kids calling me a Cliché Conflict Resolution Kevin.
CARTMAN
He has a point.
KYLE
Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters.
CRAIG
Yeah, life sucks sometimes, but it'll pass.
STAN
I can't believe what I'm hearing! [three girls walking by hear this and stop] This is why bullying is getting worse and worse at out schools! We can't all sit by and let it happen anymore!
RED
Good for you, Stan, nice somebody in this school has some balls.
CARTMAN
I have balls.
RED
Yeah, little squishy boba-tea balls.
CARTMAN
Still balls.
KYLE
Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her?
BUTTERS
My Grandma?
[The Stotch house, living room, day. Stephen and Linda are talking to a sweet-looking elderly woman. Linda and the woman sit at the sofa while Stephen stands behind Linda]
GRAMMY
Well, so then your cousin Albert, Linda, actually has two girls now. One is three and the other's about little Butters' age, I think.
STEPHEN
Well, speak of the devil.
LINDA
Butters, what happened to your eye?
BUTTERS
Grandma, ca-can I talk to you for a second?
GRAMMY
Well sure, you come and sit right here next to Grammy.
BUTTERS
Could I maybe talk to Grammy alone?
STEPHEN
Well, sure, I guess. We'll go make some tea.
GRAMMY
Oh some tea would be lovely. [Stephen and Linda leave. Instantly Grammy's sweet demeanor vanishes. She raises her left fist and punches Butters on his bruised right eye. Now we know who the bully is.] What's up? [punches him again] Huh? You think you're [punch] tough, huh?
BUTTERS
I just... [holds his hands up in self-defense] don't want you to pick on me no more, Grandma.
GRAMMY
Think you're fuckin' tough, huh? [punches him again] You don't look fuckin' tough.
BUTTERS
Um, I don't think I'm tough... grandma.
GRAMMY
No, you're a little faggot! [grabs him by the collar] You got any more money? Huh?
BUTTERS
No, you took it all!
GRAMMY
[holds her fist up at him] Why don't you do something about it?! [punches him again] Do somethin', you little bitch! You're Grandma's bitch!
LINDA
Here we go. [brings in the tea and sets it on the coffee table. Stephen brings in some lemon bars and does the same]
GRAMMY
[once again, sweet and kind] Oh, there's the tea. Tea for me. How lucky.
LINDA
And your favorite lemon bars.
GRAMMY
Goodness, what a treat this is.
[South Park Elementary, day, Mr. Mackey's office. A man pays him a visit]
BUCKY BAILEY
Mr. Mackey, what is happening here at your school is no different from what is happening all over the country. Bullying has become an epidemic, I'm afraid, and we at Bully Buckers ™ are trying to stamp it out. What is your school's policy on bullying?
MR. MACKEY
Oh, well uh w-we think that bullyin' is... is, is bad... m'kay, and uh, and when we see bullying in the school, we tell the students, you know, that... uh that that's bad. m'kay?
BUCKY BAILEY
Aha, well one of your students told us he thinks bullying at your school is getting worse.
MR. MACKEY
Uh who said?
BUCKY BAILEY
He didn't want that disclosed.
MR. MACKEY
Oh, he's a little Anonymous Andy?
BUCKY BAILEY
We would like to have an anti-bullying assembly with your students this afternoon.
MR. MACKEY
Uhokay, but uh, today's actually bad. Uh I already have an assembly today on positive thinking.
BUCKY BAILEY
You believe positive thinking is really what's critical in schools right now? What's wrong with you?!
MR. MACKEY
Wull I mean it kind of wo-uhuh works out.
BUCKY BAILEY
No, shut up! What kind of counselor says no to an anti-bullying campaign?! Bullying needs to be stopped! Now! This afternoon!
MR. MACKEY
Wah-eh jus- will we he-?
BUCKY BAILEY
Wuhhh duhhh. You may only have an Internet degree, but why don't you start acting like you're a school counselor and not an uninformed backwards little dork! M'kay?! [the Bully Buckers founder leaves the office and walks towards the hall. Moments later Mr. Mackey walks out of the office crying. He walks to the mic and turns it on]
MR. MACKEY
[barely holding back emotion] Attention students: today we will have an... assembly... on the subject of... bullying. M'kay? [on the hallway several students stand around listening to the announcement] The assembly is mandatory. M'kay? You'd better show up. 'Kay?
[The hallway. Red approaches Butters.]
RED
Butters? Your grandma's looking for you.
BUTTERS
[quickly slams his locker door shut] My grandma??
RED
She said to meet her outside behind the school.
BUTTERS
Oh hamburgers! [runs off to the closest restroom, runs in and closes the door]
GRAMMY
[sitting back against the sinks] Hey twerp! [Butters notices her] You went and narc'd on me!
BUTTERS
[startled at first] HA! OH. Ah. Hi Grandma.
GRAMMY
[walks to the bathroom door with a menacing swagger, locks it, then walks back] I heard somebody brought in an anti-bully counselor! Thought I wouldn't find out, you little narc?!
BUTTERS
Well I didn't narc, Grandma. It wasn't me.
GRAMMY
[walks towards the urinal] Oh look, what's this over here? [picks up the urinal cake] Ohoh, it's a narc puck. This is what narcs have to put in their mouths. Awww, it's got piss all over it. [picks Butters up by the collar and attempts to put the cake into his mouth]
BUTTERS
Nno Grandma, knock it off! No! Stop it! [he holds her off]
GRAMMY
Put it in your mouth! Put it in your fuckin' mouth! [someone begins to pull on the bathroom door. Grammy releases Butters and opens the door. Mr. Adler is standing outside] Ohhh hellow.
MR. ADLER
Oh, sorry. Uh, this door isn't supposed to be locked.
GRAMMY
I'm sorry, Uh I needed the restroom and my grandson brought me to this one. Isn't that right, Butters?
BUTTERS
[looks at the floor] Yes...
MR. ADLER
Butters you goofball. I'll show you to the girls' room, ma'am.
GRAMMY
Oh thank you so much. [walks out after Mr. Adler, but just as Butters is about to close the door she spins around and confronts him once more] You narc again and you're fuckin' dead! Fuckin' dead, you got it?!
MR. ADLER
This way.
GRAMMY
Oop, uh coming. [closes the door, leaving Butters to his thoughts.]
[The school assembly that afternoon. Every student is in place.]
BUCKY BAILEY
What makes a bully? [stands next to an image of his company's logo: Bucky Bailey's Bully Buckers ™] The truth is there are more bullies at your school than you even think. And the student who lets bullying happen is just as bad as the bully himself. Come on out, Lorraine. [Lorraine comes out. Her hair is disheveled and her pants go up way too high.] I asked your school mate Lorraine here to help me out. [genuflects] Are you bullied in the school, Lorraine?
LORRAINE
...d'Yes.
BUCKY BAILEY
Kids pick on you, call you names?
LORRAINE
...Sometimes.
BUCKY BAILEY
What kind of things do they say to you?
LORRAINE
...Ugly ...neh-nerd.
BUCKY BAILEY
Do they say "Nice pants. Why do you wear them up to your tits?"?
LORRAINE
[long pause] No...
BUCKY BAILEY
[stands up] Bullying affects everyone. And only if the entire school is united against it can bullying ever be stopped. [to Lorraine] Go, go, get out of here. [she leaves] Now what we at Bucky Bailey's Bully Busters ™ like to do is get the schools to make an anti-bullying video. So who would like to be the young student director in charge of our video? [long pause. No one volunteers] We just need one student to be the leader of our anti-bullying campaign. [still no takers] What? Are you all chicken? [begins to act like a chicken] Nobody wants to be in charge of the anti-bullying video? [acts like a chicken, then like a crying baby rubbing his eyes, then back to acting like a chicken.]
STAN
I'll do it! I'll be in charge.
BUCKY BAILEY
Ooooo, you're a big man?! You wanna show what a big man you are?!
STAN
No, I just... I think bullying has gotten out of hand. And it needs to be stopped.
RED
Good for you, Stan. [kids begin to clap for him. Kyle has a suspicious look.]
RILEY
He's cool.
["THE STUDENTS OF SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY PRESENT Stop Bullying. WRITTEN BY STAN MARSH. MUSIC BY STAN MARSH. TITLE SONG SUNG BY STAN MARSH. DIRECTED BY STAN MARSH."]
CLYDE
You wanna know who I hate?! I hate that kid Butters! He's a dork!
JIMMY
Yeh. Let's go bi- pick on him! Yeh! [Stan comes in from screen right]
STAN
Hey guys, guys! Don't pick on Butters! That's not cool. You can't do that. Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh, [takes Clyde and Red and turns them around] over 200,000 students every day are afraid to come to school because of bullying? [guides them back into the school] At South Park Elementary we're better than that. Come on. Let's all put an end to bullying. Right now! Five Six Seven Eight!
THE KIDS OF SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY
[Stan leads the song. He backs up into the lobby and then into the cafeteria]

Bullying isn't cool. Bullying is lame.
Bullying is ugly and has a stupid name.
For a healthy world, bullying's unfit.
And I think I know what we should do to i-it.
Do do do do do to i-it.

[Clyde takes over and backs up to the gym doors]
Let's all get together and make bullying kill itself.
Bullying's an ugly thing
[Wendy takes over in the gym and backs up though two rows of kids tossing basketballs at eat other]
Lets shove its face in the dirt and make bullying kill itself.
[Tolkien takes over and backs up to some stairs, where the Goth kids are sitting]
Woah-oh. Woah-oh. Woah-oh.
CARTMAN
[tarted up, takes over and backs up the stairs]
Boy you like my body. Set the mood, let's play!
You can touch me anywhere except for my vajayjay.
THE KIDS OF SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY
[Stan takes over at the landing between floors and backs up down the hallway and into the library]

We can make it stop. We can stomp it out.
We can beat its ass until it starts to cry.
Let's gang up on it and tell it it smells
And beat its ass worse if it ever te-lls.
If if if it ever te-lls.

[Craig takes over in the library, walks forward, and backs up down the hallway through two rows of cheerleaders and some balloons dropping from the ceiling]
Lets all join together to try to make bullying kill itself.
It'll be fun to see just how bad we can make it feel
and make bullying kill itself.
[Timmy takes over and backs up towards a corner]
Woah-oh. Woah-oh. Woah-oh.
CARTMAN
[takes over at the corner and backs up, pointing at his own crotch]
My heart says ye-es (ye-es ye-es) but my vajayjay says no-o
[Some doors open and a naked Butters is showcased in a steel-framed clear box, being carried out by two sixth graders. The lights go out and special effects appear - neon paint on the kids' faces and a blue glow through the doors. Butters takes over.]
BUTTERS
Trapped inside the darkness of my mind.
I try to break free. The words are so unkind.
JASON
Stupid! (stupid stupid)
PETE
Ugly! (ugly ugly ugly ugly)
KYLE
Pansy.
OLDER GIRL
Dork!
BUTTERS
Can I, can I not do this, please? [the video stops and the hallway lights come on] I don't wanna do this.
STAN
Aw Butters, you ruined it. This is all one big long shot and you ruined it.
BUTTERS
Mm, but this is just gonna make things worse for me.
STAN
Butters, you're the star of the video!
KYLE
He doesn't wanna do it, dude.
STAN
Well come on, do you just wanna be bullied your whole life, Butters? [Kyle walks off in a huff] Kyle?
[In front of the school. Kyle walks out and away. Stan runs out after him]
STAN
Kyle? Kyle, dude, where are you going?!
KYLE
[stops, then turns around] Why are you doing this, Stan?
STAN
To stop bullying.
KYLE
You're gonna stop bullying.
STAN
YES.
KYLE
With Cartman singing about his vagina.
STAN
...It's about awareness dude. Don't you understand how important this is? Bullying? Do you realize that in America, hohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to come to school every day because of-
KYLE
Don't, don't act for me, Stan! Really?! Because every minute I'm watching this video become less about awareness and more about you!
STAN
Kyle, I'm trying to make a difference!
KYLE
Okay. Just be careful you don't end up naked and jacking it in San Diego. [turns around and hurries away]
STAN
What the hell does that mean?
[Butters' house, evening. The family is having dinner at the table]
GRAMMY
Oh heavens to Betsy, Linda. This is such a yummy yummy ham. I just love your cooking. [takes her fork under the table and jabs Butters with it. He winces in pain.]
STEPHEN
Our Linda certainly knows her way around a pork. [Butters winces again] What's the matter, Butters?
BUTTERS
Nnothin' Dad. Jjust a little gassy. [Grammy jabs him again, and he winces in pain]
STEPHEN
Oh. Well don't fart on Grandma. She's tryin' to enjoy her ham.
BUTTERS
Okay Dad, I won-aaaaah! Gaaaah-ow. [the doorbell rings]
STEPHEN
I'll get it. [rises and walks away]
GRAMMY
[notices something] Linda, is that a new clock on the wall?
LINDA
[looks at the clock] Oh yes. Stephen and I got that last month. It's from Germany, I believe. [while Linda talks, Grammy picks her boogers and smears them on Butters' mashed potatoes] I just love the cute little canary on the dial. And, every hour it chimes. [turns back to Grandma as Stephen brings Butters' friends over.]
STEPHEN
Your friends wanted to see you, Butters.
STAN
Dude, Butters! We have awesome news! A Hollywood movie company is gonna buy our bullying video!
GRAMMY
Oh, an anti-bullying video? How adorable. [jabs him harder with the fork, and he screams in pain]
STAN
Yeah, and Butters is the star! The movie company wants to do a photo shoot with him so we can make movie posters!
BUTTERS
HAAAAA! [pounds the table fiercely to relieve the pain from Grammy's fork]
STAN
I know, right?! [Stan, Cartman, and Kenny all imitate Butters' pain]
[South Park Elementary, day. Stan walks in to a hero's welcome. Cheers greet him as he walks down the hall towards the boys' restroom. He walks in and noticed Mr. Bailey waiting for him with arms crossed.]
BUCKY BAILEY
Whassup?! [walks to the bathroom door and locks it]
STAN
Oh, hey.
BUCKY BAILEY
You went and made a video and sold it without lettin' me know.
STAN
Huh?
BUCKY BAILEY
Doin' a video was my idea! It's the property of Bucky Bailey's Bully Buckers ™, you got that?! [crosses his arms again]
STAN
But I worked hard on that! It's, it's been really stressful and I-
BUCKY BAILEY
Oh, it's been stwessful?! [gets in his face] What's wrong with you?! Kids are getting bullied at school and with this money, Bucky Bailey's Bully Buckers ™ can finally become the legit organization it deserves to be! You greedy, selfish, little PRICK! [Stan lowers his head in shame] Oh what? You gonna cwy?
STAN
No.
BUCKY BAILEY
No, go ahead, cwy. Let me see ya. [rubs his eyes as if he's the one crying] Let me see you cwy. [Stan begins to cry]
STAN
[Stan Sobbing.]
[Butters' house, night, Butters' room. He's pacing back and forth]
BUTTERS
[having a conversation with himself] We don't have a choice, Butters. You have to defend yourself! [switch] Oh, but violence is never the answer. [switch] But she's gonna kill you, Butters! You know she is! [switch] You're right, Butters! I don't have a choice! [goes into his closet and pulls out a box] Sorry, Grandma, but you brought this on yourself! [unpacks his Professor Chaos costume and puts it on] It's time you met... Chaos! [he bursts into the hallway] I've been pushed around for the last time! [runs to the guest bedroom, where Grammy is staying] Now I'm coming! And heck's coming with me! [bursts into Grammy's room, but is suddenly surprised at what he sees - Grammy in a supervillain outfit]
GRAMMY
Oh, look, it's Captain Pussy! [Professor Chaos is frozen in place] You can't stop me, Captain Pussy! Don't even try!
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Grandma? but how di-
GRAMMY
I got inspired when I came across your gay little costume in your closet. [changes mood] Now come on, Captain Pussy! Time for you to get your Gummi bears!
PROFESSOR CHAOS
No! Grandma please, nnnot Gummi bears!
GRAMMY
Come 'ere! [rushes towards him]
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Ahh! Grandma! [backs into a corner next to a small table. Grammy knocks the table over and pins Chaos against the wall]
GRAMM
Stand up for yourself! Fight back! Be a fucking man!
PROFESSOR CHAOS
I can't.
GRAMMY
Then it looks like you get... Gummi bears! [reaches into her mouth and pulls out her dentures] Gummy bears! [begins to gnaw at his left arm with her gums]
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Awww! Eewww!
[South Park Elementary, day. Mr. Bailey walks down the hallway to the boys' room. He goes inside and is surprised]
NICK JABS
[waiting with arms crossed] What's up? I'm Nick Jabs, president of the movie company that bought the bully video. [goes to lock the door]
BAILEY
Oh what? Stan Marsh got you to come talk to me?! That little cliché conflict resolution Kevin!
JABS
[advancing, making Bailey back up] The video was conceived, written, and directed by the South Park student body, you got that?!
BAILEY
It was my idea. I told the students to make the video and I-and I produced the entire thing! I deserve to have my name on it!
JABS
Yeah, only problem is America doesn't give a SHIT about an old fart with a Captain Kangaroo haircut! They wanna believe kids did something on their own. [hands him a sealed envelope] Here's a cease and desist letter from our lawyers. If you ever claim any authorship of the video again, we will sue you for everything you have!
BAILEY
But... but this was gonna be the thing that finally made Bully Buckers ™ a national organization.
JABS
Oh, you gonna cwy?! Oh don't cwy, you'll wook bad wif your wittle Captain Kangawoo haircut! [Mr. Bailey goes to the bathroom door, unlocks it, and walks out sobbing]
[The hallway, around the same time. Cartman and Kenny are handing out posters and putting them on lockers. Kenny is positioning one of them on a locker as Kyle walks up to them]
CARTMAN
'Kay kewl, hold it right there. Kewl. [nearby, Craig and Clyde take notice]
KYLE
Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker?
CARTMAN
We're putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since you walked out on the video, you don't get to come! [blows a raspberry at him]
KYLE
I don't wanna go to your stupid movie premiere! [walks away] And don't tape that to my locker! [walks into the boys' room and sees Stan waiting by the sink with arms crossed] Oh God. [Stan goes to lock the door]
STAN
What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release?
KYLE
Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put all over signs as the poster child for bullying?
STAN
Butters is totally fine with it, dude.
KYLE
Yeah? Well Butters is ten! He doesn't exactly know what's best for him, and neither do you!
STAN
Alright Kyle, that's enough! I'm not gonna be bullied by you, okay?!
KYLE
What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom!
STAN
Oh yeah.
KYLE
Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them.
STAN
This video can change how people think about bullying! It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle!
KYLE
If it needs to be seen by everybody, then why don't you put it out on the Internet for free?! [long pause] Well?!
STAN
...What, what was the question again?
KYLE
[slowly] If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet, for free?!
STAN
...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom!
KYLE
[turns around and walks out] Fine! But when you're naked and jackin' it in San Diego, don't ask me for help! [closes the door.]
STAN
[left wondering] Why does he keep saying that?
[The Dr. Oz Show]
DR. OZ
We all know that bullying has become an epidemic. Like AIDS, bullying is escalating and is spread mostly by penises. But now a few school kids are trying to make a difference with a video to make bullying kill itself. [Switch to Camera 2, which shows Stan and Butters seated next to Dr. Oz. Butters is not too happy to be there, so he rests his head on his right hand] I'm joined by the film's director as well as the weak little boy who's the main subject of the film. Stan, congratulations on all your success.
STAN
Well, I just got tired of seeing people like Butters getting pushed around, and I knew I had to do somethin' about it. [the audience applauds]
DR. OZ
And how about you? What would you like to say to your bully out there?
BUTTERS
Oh uh, nothin'.
DR. OZ
Come on, this is for everyone who's been a victim. What do you wanna say to bullies all across America? Go ahead. [Butters raises his head] Right now. Say it.
BUTTERS
Uh stop... Stop trying to make me say things I don't want to on your TV show.
DR. OZ
Do you hear that, bullies? Stop making kids say things on your TV shows! [the audience applauds] What else do you wanna say, Butters?
BUTTERS
[feeling cornered] Please, leave me alone.
DR. OZ
Leave him alone! But that doesn't work, does it Butters?
BUTTERS
No it doesn't.
DR. OZ
Tell us in graphic detail what the bully does to you?!
BUTTERS
Stop it!
DR. OZ
Come on, this is for America! [Stan begins to get concerned. Butters looks to Stan for some reassurance] Do you realize that in America, ohohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to go to school because of bullying?! [Butters' anger begins to rise] Don't you care?! You better care! [Butters loses it and attacks Dr. Oz. The audience cheers him on. Dr. Oz collapses to the floor and Butters begins to punch him in the face]
[The movie company's head office, day. Stan has been summoned to the office]
MR. JABS
What the hell were you thinking?! Everyone just saw that the bully victim in your movie is actually a violent psychopath!
STAN
I didn't know.
MR. JABS
This could kill our box office. People are gonna come after us now, saying we didn't check our facts!
STAN
I didn't beat up Dr. Oz! Don't be mad at me!
MR. JABS
It's your fuckin' movie! Now I'm gonna have to work overtime with marketing to make sure people still sympathize with our victim! Jesus, just get the fuck out of here! I've gotta go to the bathroom! [goes to the bathroom as Stan leaves. Inside the bathroom he runs into Jesus with his arms crossed] Uh oh.
JESUS
My child, [goes to lock the door] have you ever heard of a place called Hell? It's eternal fire, and it's gonna hurt real bad.
MR. JABS
Uh... [lowers his head]
JESUS
Oh, what are you gonna do? cwy now?
[Grammy's room, night. Butters cracks the door open and walks in while she's asleep. She's facing away from him, so he can't see how she responds]
BUTTERS
Grandma? I did it, Grandma. [she opens her eyes] I finally stood up for myself. I got real mean and I beat the snot outta Dr. Oz. [she frowns] I can't lie, it felt kind of good. [she smiles] At first. But since then all I have is just... a kind of dark, empty feeling. Then I realized... that's how you must feel. All the time. [her smile fades] Poor old Grandma. You know, I-I've been gettin' lots of advice how to deal with you. Stand up to you, tell on you... But I kind of realize there's just people like you out there. All over the place. When you're a kid, things seem like they're gonna last forever. But they're not. Life changes. Why you won't always be around. Someday you're gonna die. [the anger leaves Grammy's face] Someday pretty soon. [he approaches Grammy] And when you're layin' in that hospital bed, with tubes up your nose, and that little pan under your butt to pee in, well I'll come visit ya. I'll come just to show you that, that I'm still alive and I'm still happy. And you'll die. Bein' nothin' but you. [walks back to the door] 'Night Grandma. [exits and closes the door]
[South Park Elementary, next morning. Stan walks through the front doors and the students all boo him and throw wads of paper at him]
STAN
Huh? Aw, come on! [comes across Clyde, Craig, and Cartman and stops] Dude, what's going on?
CLYDE
You didn't hear?! Now that America knows Butters was actually a violent psychopath, they're saying you made a bull-crap bullying video!
STAN
Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it?
CARTMAN
The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO!
RED
You made us look like uncaring idiots!
CRAIG
Yeah. Boooo!
STAN
How was I supposed to know Butters was actually a violent psychopath?
TIMMY
[rolls up] Boooo!
STAN
[moves off a bit] Everyone loved me sixteen hours ago.
MR. MACKEY
Stan? Stan, okay, ABC called and Dr. Oz is suing you and our entire school! What are you gonna do?!
STAN
[sighs in resignation] I guess, there's only one thing left for me to do.
[A plane moves through the sky and lands at San Diego International Airport. Stan walks through the airport with two suitcases, then through the San Diego Zoo, then through Coronado Island, then takes a taxi ride through the Gaslamp District.]
SINGER (BACKGROUND SINGERS)
Baaam badam baaam baaadam. Baaam badam bam

JERRY SANDERS
[Mayor of San Diego] Come to San Diego. There's so much to see. [real photos of the places he mentions appear] From the sparkling waters of Mission Bay to the warm tortillas of Old Town. And after a day of sight-seeing, why not try spankin' it in one of our charming city streets? San Diego. Come, take a load off. [Behind him, Stan is still dancing at the street corner]
[The three singers are at Sea World. Stan dances across the screen at Coronado Island with his back to the camera, then dances at a Mission-style building, then is back at the corner masturbating at passing cars. Someone captures the spectacle from a nearby window. A priest walks by reading a newspaper. He notices Stan and is surprised enough to lose the paper]

synopsis:The boys' ziplining adventure becomes a terrifying test of survival.

script:I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining

[The opening shots this week parody those of "I Shouldn't Be Alive", with dramatic zooms and pans. Then a shot of Stan running in zipline gear]
STAN
Kyle! [his voice echoes as he looks around frantically]
[The opening shots again]
NARRATOR
Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell. [A shot of Kyle running, also in zipline gear, through the forest.]
KYLE
AAAAAAAH! I can't take it! [a shot of Cartman moving down the zip line helplessly]
CARTMAN
Somebody help us! [motion blur back to opening shots]
NARRATOR
Trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with no way out. [a shot each of Kyle, Kenny, and Stan screaming, then of a bloodied Stan on the zip line, then of Cartman, then of Kyle] The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
KYLE
[being interviewed] We were stuck. We were completely stuck. [cut to Cartman running]
CARTMAN
Kyle, hurry! [a shot of Stan with Kyle]
STAN
Kyle, wake up! You've gotta wake up, Kyle! [a shot each of Kyle, Kenny, Stan, and Cartman screaming, then of the four boys on a wooden platform at the top of a zip line, then of Cartman, then of a trip through the esophagus, then of Cartman, and back to the first shot]
NARRATOR
For four elementary school boys. an ordinary day becomes a descent into madness on tonight's episode of "I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining".
CARTMAN
[inside a van, in a window seat] Oh God!
STAN
[running towards the camera] No!
["The events in this film took place over 4 hours in the Colorado Rockies"]
STAN
Help! We're trapped! [A shot of all four boys bloodied and woozy] We've gotta get out of here!
["This is a true story."]
[A bright sun rises over the town of South Park]
NARRATOR
It's the last day of Spring break, [a shot of the school] and all over the small mountain town of South Park, [back at the park, kids play on the basketball court or go down a slide, or fly kites.] students are trying to have as much fun as possible. [a girl shows off her dog to two friends, a boy aims his water gun at another boy and runs after him, two other boys toss a football between them. The camera stops at a table with four boys. Tow of them sit at the bench, two others stand. Kenny plays with a twig] For ten year old Stan Marsh and his friends Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the last day has come too soon.
STAN
[being interviewed] We really had spent the whole spring break watching TV and playing Xbox, you know, so, we, we wanted to go out and do something really adventurous.
KYLE
We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide
CARTMAN
Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes.
KENNY
[offended] (What?!)
CARTMAN
Look at his lip. [to Kenny] You've got herpes, dude.
KENNY
[throws the twig away] (This is not herpes, it's a cold sore!)
CARTMAN
No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes.
STAN
Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do?
KYLE
[being interviewed] And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining.
CARTMAN
Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!
KYLE
We've definitely not done that before!
STAN
I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off.
KYLE
Cool! Ziplining.
CARTMAN
Ziplining. Hell yeah.
NARRATOR
Within thirty minutes, the boys are getting a ride to the ziplining outfitters from Stan's uncle Jimbo. [a shot of the boys chattering in the back]
CARTMAN
[being interviewed] We were in a good mood, just jokin' around, you know, mostly making fun of Kenny's herpes.
CARTMAN
Hey Kenny! You got herpes, dude! Ah I almost touched him. [leans over to see how close his finger can reach without touching] Zi- [Kenny puts his right mitten over his mouth and Cartman pulls his left hand back playfully] Oh, sick Kenny! No! Gross.
KENNY
(Dude, it's just a fever blister!)
CARTMAN
Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it's just a fever blister. [laughs] You sound like a chick, Kenny. That's herpes, dude. You got that shit till you die.
NARRATOR
It's the idyllic spring break getaway with friends and laughter. [a shot of the boys cheering as they approach Backcountry Adventures]
[Inside Backcountry Adventures, day]
CLERK
Hey, you guys here for the 2 o'clock zipline tour?
STAN
Yeah.
CLERK
All right, let me get you some helmet and some gear and we'll get up there and hit that fresh nar nar.
KYLE
[being interviewed] And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, "Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous."
CLERK
[he's got the boys dressed up] All right, you guys look ready to zipline!
CARTMAN
Alright!
CLERK
Okay, just follow me over to the waiting room and we'll have you take a seat with the others.
STAN
[being interviewed] And we were like, "Other? We have to do this with other people?" [a shot of the boys entering the waiting room, where there are seven other people waiting]
WOMAN 1
Hi there.
MAN 1
Hello.
WOMAN 2
Hi
NARRATOR
The boys have just made a sobering discovery. [a shot of Stan's internal organs and spine] For ten year old Stan Marsh, the realization that he will be with a tour group has caused his adrenal glands to slow down. [this is shown] The average human acts a certain way when surrounded by friends and family. [Stan's brain and skull are shown] But, in a tour group, the brain has to work overtime, acting nice and pretending to care about people on the tour.
WOMAN 2
[quite pregnant] Hey, how are you?
STAN
[mimicking] Good. How are you?
KYLE
[being interviewed] So then we sit there for like, thirty minutes, because we had to wait for this couple who was running late. [the couple arrives]
CLERK
Alright, our last zipliners are here. [Kyle and Cartman are visibly angry]
MAN 2
Sorry we made you wait, everybody. [A shot of Kyle's mouth interior is shown]
NARRATOR
Inside Kyle's mouth, the muscles contract to force a smile, even though in his brain, Kyle is thinking, "Dude, fuck you!"
KYLE
We don't mind.
CARTMAN
[being interviewed] Now everyone was there. We thought things would start getting fun, but... that's when we had to watch the safety video. [the benches are rearranged so the zipliners can watch a TV screen above them]
CLERK
Welcome to Backcountry Adventures! Well hey there Michael!
MICHAEL
[who's just the clerk, naturally] Hey there Michael. [Everyone behind the boys laughs.]
STAN
[being interviewed] It was... I don't know, ten, maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell. [return to the tour]
MICHAEL
Oh, and don't forget... to take in the nar. Back to you, Michael.
MICHAEL
Thanks Michael. [turns off the TV] Anybody have any questions?
CARTMAN
...No.
MAN 2
I have a question: Can we review the best ways to hold a rope again? [the boys are stunned that this needs to be done]
STAN
[being interviewed] "Really? You're gonna make us all listen to it again 'cause you couldn't understand? Really?"
MICHAEL
Let's get out there and get zippin'! [everyone rises and heads out of the waiting room]
KYLE
Jesus Christ!
CARTMAN
Finally!
NARRATOR
The boys think their ordeal is over, but what they don't realize is that things are about to go from bad to worse.
[Outside Backcountry Adventures]
MICHAEL
Here we go guys! Zipliniiin'! [goes into an open-leg stance, makes a fist with his left hand, holding out the thumb and pinkie]

[a woman, waiting by a van that has been out earlier in the day] Everyone just step on in the shuttle. [opens the van's sliding door. The zipliners head for it]
STAN
...Shuttle?
KYLE
How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?
MICHAEL
It's about forty-five minutes.
NARRATOR
It's a devastating blow. For Kyle, it's almost too much to bear. [a look at Kyle's brain] His brain is already lacking excitement, and now just the word "shuttle" makes Kyle's brain fire neurons [this is shown] that bring up memories of just how lame shuttles can be. [two images of overloaded shuttle buses appear, then footage of the Space Shuttle Challenger going up and exploding, and Kyle is scared]
CARTMAN
Well, come on, we don't have a choice. [leads the others to the shuttle van.]
[The shuttle ride, later. It sure is bumpy.]
MICHAEL
Alright guys, should be about forty five minutes to the freshest nar nar. Why don't we go around the van and get to know each other a little bit?
STAN
Uh that's okay.
MAN 3
Well my name's Pete Nichols and this is my wife Donna, and uh... make a long story short, we came out here to see our relatives who live down in Moab. They uhhh been livin' there about twenty years now, and uh, long story short, they told us that as long as we were in the Rockies we should try ziplining, so, long story short, we looked around in the newspapers and on the Internet and... on billboooards, and... you know, make a long story short, we found this company and thought we'd give 'er a try, so then we called and, we made a reservation, and that's when, you know, long story short, we just thought- [Cartman begins to mutter angrily]
NARRATOR
[hour 2] It's almost three o'clock, and the boys are still on the shuttle.
MICHAEL
We're gettin' close. Are you guys gettin' psyched?!
ADULTS
Wooo!
NARRATOR
But what the boys don't realize is that a massie storm is brewing. [Cartman is drinking some Mountain Dew from a can. The camera looks around the van] Last night, Eric Cartman had kung pao spaghetti from California Pizza Kitchen. [the camera goes down Eric's esophagus] Inside Eric's stomach, the kung pao has just met with the Del Taco he ate for breakfast. It has already started to tear down the layers of barbeque BK toppers that have been building up for months. [the camera comes back up the esophagus and out Cartman's mouth] And now, to compensate for all the annoying tourists, Eric is ingesting massive amounts of Mountain Dew. [the camera goes back down Cartman's throat] The caffeine and sugar turn the soupy fast-food liquid in his stomach into a toxic gas. [a quick journey through the intestines is shown] When the gas is released, it carries with it tiny particles of Eric's fecal matter. [the sphincter is shown] Fecal matter which floats up and into Kyle's nasal passage. [this is shown, along with Kyle's reaction]
KYLE
Dude, did you fart?!
CARTMAN
Mmmm, no?
MICHAEL
Alright buys, we're here! [The van pulls up to the first entrace to Zipline Adventures. Both Stan and Kenny look sleepy]
STAN
Thank God. [everyone is out of the van as Guide 1 goes up to the launch pad two stories up. The pad is attached to a pine tree]
MICHAEL
Alright, here we are. Looks like we got some good nar to zipline through today. Uh, but before we climb up and start ziplining, does anyone care to know about these trees' biology?
CARTMAN
The trees' biology?
MICHAEL
We are running a little late, but if anyone really wants to know, we could take a few minutes.
STAN
I think we're good.
MAN 2
[raises his left hand] I'd like to know about the biology of the trees.
MICHAEL
Okay, well, this is a Ponderosa pine. It covers a more extensive area than other Ameri-
STAN
[being interviewed] So after Asshole gets his biology lesson, we finally get to go ziplining! [Cartman is hooked up]
MICHAEL
Alright, remember to keep your clear of the cable and just let your equipment do the work. [a shot of the tour group] Now, when you're about halfway down the zipline, the camera's gonna take your picture, so when I call out "Shockabra!", look up and give the camera a nice "shockabra" [two fists with thumbs and pinkies extended]. Alright, you ready?
CARTMAN
Yeah. [Michael shortens the strap between Cartman and the zipline, and holds him up]
MICHAEL
Ready to do some ZIPPIN'?
CARTMAN
Yeah.
MICHAEL
Alright, let's hear you say "Zipliiine!"
CARTMAN
Zipliiine. [Michael sends him on his way]
MICHAEL
[voice-over] Shockabra! [Cartman holds out his fists as indicated above and the camera takes his picture]
GUIDE 1
Woohoo! Alright, nice zip!
KYLE
Well? How was it, Cartman?
CARTMAN
Totally fuckin' stupid, dude!
STAN
[as Kyle is prepped] Oh, really??
CARTMAN
Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit!
MICHAEL
Alright Kyle, give me a "Zipliiine!"
KYLE
Zipline. [Michael sends him on his way]
MICHAEL
Shockabra! [does the fists. Kyle does the fists too and the camera takes his picture, but he's mad]
KYLE
[being interviewed] It was like having the life sucked out of you. That' all it is, sliding down a cable. Maybe without a tour group it'd be ...kind of fun. Maybe. But, this was just... a complete disaster.
NARRATOR
After a grueling twenty minutes, waiting for everyone else to ride the zipline, the boys relaize they have just wasted hours of their time. And that, is when the unthinkable happens.
MICHAEL
Alright guys, let's get movin'! Only ten minutes till our next zipliiine! [the others cheer, but the boys are worried.]
CARTMAN
[being interviewed] "The next zipline? What are you talking about?"
KYLE
E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done?
MICHAEL
This is Zipline Tours. We got sixteen more to go.
STAN
[being interviewed] And it was like WHAM. [makes a fist with his right hand and punches his left handn with it.]
KYLE
STOP!
CARTMAN
NOOOO!
GUIDE
Everyone back in the shuttle!
KYLE, CARTMAN
NOOOO! [the adults and a fifth kid get back into the van]
NARRATOR
The boys realize that their ziplining nightmare has only just begun. [the boys scream and some scens of the next ziplines flash by: Michael sends someone down the zipline, he plays guitar during a break "led me through that"]
GUIDE
Anyone have any questions about the creek we're about to cross?
MAN 2
Yes.
BOYS
AAAA! [shots of Kyle, Kenny, and Stan]
ADULTS
"Ack" went the little green frog one day. "Ack" went the little green frog...
CARTMAN
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! [opening shots return]
MICHAEL
Let 'er rip! [sends Man 2 on his way]
MAN 4
Zipliiine!
NARRATOR
Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.
MICHAEL
Next zipline's up here, we call it the Terminator.
KYLE
Wugh!
NARRATOR
Trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with a tour group.
PETE
But, you know, to make a long story short, I woke up this morning and- [Woman 1 is shown going down, then man 1, then]
MAN 2
[with his wife] Could you get another picture of us? [hands Kyle the camera]
KYLE
[frustrated] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! [a shot of the whole group is shown]
NARRATOR
The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
CARTMAN
[on his way down a zipline.] I'm so fucking bored! [Hour 3 arrives. Michael sends the next zipliner on down. The others cheer her on]
MICHAEL
Alright, you going next, Ricky? [hooks Ricky up and sends him down]
THE BOYS
[on the ground] Help! Somebody! Help us! [the adults on the launch pad cheer the next zipliner down]
KYLE
It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.
STAN
There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead.
KYLE
[grabs Stan's arms] Face it Stan! Nobody's coming for us! [another zipliner goes down]
ZIPLINER
Zipline!
ADULTS
Woohoo!
CARTMAN
We should have never listened to you, Kyle.
KYLE
Me?!
CARTMAN
Yeah you! In the park this morning?! "I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!"
KYLE
Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!
CARTMAN
I brought it up because you already brought it up!
STAN
[being interviewed] That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me.
KYLE
You fat piece of shit!
CARTMAN
Fuck you Kyle!
STAN
Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?!
CARTMAN, KYLE
Yes!
STAN
Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay?
NARRATOR
But what the boys don't realize is that Eric's body is already shutting down from stage 4 diarrhea. [the camera goes down Cartman's throat.] Inside his stomach, bile has just dislodged an Arby's Ultimate Angus. In the average human, this would only cause mild diarrhea. [the camera goes back up his throat and out his mouth] But Eric Cartman is now drinking Double Dew, a Mountain Dew product with twice the sugar and caffeine of regular Mountain Dew. [the camera goes back in] His rancid feces is now rapidly converting to a thick paste. [a quick trip through Cartman's intestines, as before] The diarrhea shoots out of Eric's anus and into his underwear. [this is shown, and the smell wafts up into Kyle's nose] Eric Cartman is a ticking time bomb.
KYLE
DUDE! Did you just shit your pants?!
CARTMAN
Nnnn-mo...
STAN
[being interviewed] So, I just tried to keep the tour group moving, as fast as possible.
MICHAEL
All right guys, this is where we're going to break for lunch.
GUIDE
[standing in a covered lunch area] Come in by the waterfall, gang! [it's a small waterfall]
STAN
Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?
MAN 2
Skip a free lunch? Not me! [runs to the lunch area. The other zipliners follow]
GUIDE
Wo wants sandwiches? [pulls out sealed sandwiches from a portable ice box] We got ...turkey. [Man 2 takes that one] Ham. [another zipliner takes that one] Turkey ham. [another zipliner takes that one...]
PETE
[in the background] Long story short, we picked up our bags and went to our hotel. [in the foreground the boys are sitting on their own log with the word HELP on the ground before them made with twigs and branches]
CARTMAN
Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy! [keeps sipping the Double Dew]
KYLE
Then stop drinking Double Dew, fatass!
CARTMAN
This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew. [at the bottom of the can is a blurb saying "DEW THE MATH!"] Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast.
KYLE
You're in a forest! Go take a crap!
CARTMAN
If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle!
STAN
[runs up to the tour guides] Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick.
MICHAEL
Oh, you mean the little kid with the herpes?
STAN
...Yyyeah.
GUIDE
That's not herpes, it's a cold sore.
MICHAEL
Right, sorry.
STAN
Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go.
MICHAEL
Jesus, sorry dude, but we're at the summit. The only way down is to zip down.
SOME ADULTS
Zipline! Wooo!
GUIDE
What about the stables?
MICHAEL
Oh yeah, the stables. There's, there's a ranch right past that hill that rents out horses. I, I bet they can get you back.
KYLE
[being interviewed] Suddenly, Stan says he knows about some horse stables. Ih it seemed too good to be true.
RANCHER
Now let me get this straight: You want four horses, one for each of ya?
STAN
Yea, please!
RANCHER
Well I think we can set ya up.
KYLE
Oh, thank God!
STAN
You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all.
RANCHER
Step right out here, we'll get you going. [leads the boys out to a horseback riding tour] Got four more for you, Duncan. [All the riders wave and say hello, and a few take pictures]
CARTMAN
NOOO! [opening shots return]
NARRATOR
Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.
KYLE
AAAAH! [the boys are now shown on horseback in this order: Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny]
CARTMAN
[still aching] Eeeeugh.
NARRATOR
Trapped in a tour group on horsback that is only allowed to travel four miles an hour. [the camera tries some dramatic moves]
KYLE
Can we please go faster?!
KENNY
(I can't take it!)
DUNCAN
We got some lunch set up for ya up ahead. Some turkey sandwiches and Diet Double Dew.
KYLE
AAAAAAAAAAH!
CARTMAN
Uh oh. [lets out a wet fart]
RIDER 1
[to Kyle] So anyway, long story short, I was born in 1953 at six in the morning.
NARRATOR
An attempt to make a bad day better becomes a descent into madness on... "I Should Have Never Thought Horseback Riding Would Be Any Better Than Ziplining"
[The lunch site, moments later.]
DUNCAN
This here waterfall is called Heartbreak Falls. Would you all like to know why it's called Heartbreak Falls?
RIDER 2
Well I certainly would! [Other riders do too. Nearby, Kyle has collapsed]
STAN
Kyle. Kyle? Kyle, come on, wake up!
KYLE
Just go. Go without me.
STAN
No, we're not leaving you here, Kyle!
KYLE
I can't take it anymore. [his voice gets weaker] Why do people say "long story short"? They're not making it short, Stan.
STAN
[being interviewed] I just sat there, watching Kyle die and... I wanted to tell him the truth right then and there. But then this... fire rose up inside of me, I... I thought "I can find us a way out!" I ran off and went searching for, I don't know how long. Twelve minutes? And that's when I found it.
STAN
[returns from his search quite excited] You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there!
CARTMAN
A marina?
STAN
We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay!
KYLE
What's the point?
STAN
Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?! [an announcer says the following lines]
["The following program contains graphic re-enactments that may be disturbing to some audience members." The marina. This is the live-action segment of the episode]
NARRATOR
Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell. [shots of the boys screaming on various parts of the boat] Trapped on a 42-foot powerboat [named Puffin] which is only allowed to go five miles an hour. [some footage is dropped to speed up the boat in time-lapse form]
KYLE
Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!
CARTMAN
Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew!
KYLE
Ziplining was your idea, you fatass!
NARRATOR
The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
CARTMAN
Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's?
KENNY
[slurring his speech] I don't know. I really don't give a shit.
NARRATOR
For four elementary school boys, an alrady tragic day becomes a descent into madness on... "I Should Have Never Got On A Goddamn Boat" [more shots of the boys on the Puffin]
KYLE
Oh no. [Cartman lowers a 20-oz. bottle of Mountain Dew] You're not stinking up the entire boat! You're taking a crap off the side into the water!
["The events in this film took place over 4 hours in the Colorado Rockies." Cartman is shitting over the side of the boat, Stan screams, Kyle and Kenny vomit over other sides, Cartman continues to shit]
KENNY
Beavers! [a beaver is swimming in the water]
["This is a true story."]
[The boys are resting on a bench on the boat now]
NARRATOR
After cleaning Cartman's diarrhea and fighting off beavers, the boys have made a terrifying discovery: that boating is just as boring as ziplining.
STAN
[being interviewed] The boat went really slow and it just went round and round.
CARTMAN
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
NARRATOR
If the boys fall asleep now, from the lack of excitement, they could die. [Stan looks ready to sleep. Cartman takes a swig of Mountain Dew]
KYLE
Here! [takes Cartman's bottle] Everyone drink some Mountain Dew!
KYLE
[being interviewed] I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it.
CARTMAN
I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes!
KENNY
Hey. [tugs on Cartman, who turns to look at him] Fuck you, Cartman.
[The Puffin, some time later]
NARRATOR
Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell. [individual shots of the boys. They all have oral herpes now] And just when it seems it can't get any worse... [the boys are nodding off again]
STAN
...Kenny? Kenny! [Kenny has slid down on the seat, but his eyes are open]
NARRATOR
Kenny McCormick has died of boredom.
KYLE
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!
CARTMAN
No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard!
KYLE
IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD!
STAN
[being interviewed] And finally, I couldn't hold it in anymore. I said "Stop it!"
STAN
[rises and walks a bit] Stop it! It was me! My idea.
CARTMAN
You?!
STAN
Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining. [reaches into his pocket and pulls out the brochure for Backcountry Adventures, then looks at it for a few seconds] I thought it would be fun. I only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together. [Kyle and Cartman look at each other]
KYLE
So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?!
STAN
[turns to face them] If you signed up three friends, you got a free iPod Nano. [the camera pans down and sure enough, the offer is on the brochure cover: Sign up 3 friends and get an iPod NANO!!!]
KYLE
You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?!
STAN
I had no idea ziplining would be so boring.
CARTMAN
[points at Stan] You... You killed Kenny! [Stan begins to weep]
KYLE
You BAStard! You BAStard, Stan! [a shot of Kenny, then a shot of the three surviving boys crying. Kyle cries on Cartman's shoulder and Cartman comforts him]
KYLE
[being interviewed] How many iPod Nanos is friendship worth? I guess, one.
STAN
[being interviewed, crying] The hardest part about it is knowing you can't take it back. [wipes away the flowing tears] I mean, it was the fifth-generation Nano, so I can't trade it in anywhere.
NARRATOR
But then, miraculously, the boys' prayers are finally answered. [the boys look around, startled]
CARTMAN
[being interviewed] It was a miracle. He came to save us and take us back home.
CARTMAN
You came for us!
KYLE
Mr. Hankey!
STAN
Thank you. [whispers] Mr. Hankey. [Mr. Hankey has landed on the boat, at the top of an armrest]
MR. HANKEY
[without the falsetto voice] Howdy ho, boys? Let's get you back home. [the boys are overjoyed at their good fortune]
CARTMAN
[being interviewed] We were saved. It was over.
NARRATOR
After nearly four hours in the Colorado wilderness, the boys are finally going home. From the boat, the boys were airlifted aboard Mr. Hankey's magical helicrapter. [shown, the images are back to the cartoon form] In the four hours since they had left home, the boys had traveled so far that Mr. Hankey then had to fly them on his Seven Turdy Seven. [a jet plane made of poo] From there, it was only an hour ride back home on the Poochoo Express. [The ziplining Shockabra pictures are shown] Four friends, turn apart by tragedy [Kenny's image vanishes, leaving the forest background in place], would now start the long journey back to forgiveness. Kenny McCormick's remains were finally brought home to his parents. [Mr. Hankey delivers them personally. The parents are distraught] And the boys received treatment for their herpes. [two paramedics treat Stan and Cartman as Mr. Hankey looks on from above. Stan and Cartman focus on Mr. Hankey.]
CARTMAN
[being interviewed] No, I didn't get herpes, I just had a cold sore.
NARRATOR
[shots of the scenes being described are shown] Kyle Broflovski spent twenty seven days in the hospital having fecal matter removed from his nasal passages. Stan Marsh dedicated himself to raising awareness about the boredom risks of ziplining. [a lecture tour. Stan is shown on stage with a "No on Ziplining" logo] His awareness videos became so popular that Stan once again ended up jacking it in San Diego. As for Eric Cartman, [shown as a mountaineer] he refused to let the tragedy stop him from doing what he loves most. In just two weeks, he was back to drinking Diet Double Dew, defiant to dew the math.
CARTMAN
[being interviewed] It's diet, dude. Diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea. [takes a long sip]
End of I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The time has finally come for Cartman to let a special someone know exactly how he feels.

script:Cartman Finds Love

[South Park Elementary, hallway, day. The kids are milling around as Butters' wail is heard.]
BUTTERS
[runs across the hallway] Fellas! Fellas! Fellas! [spots them in another hallway and runs to them] AAAAH, fellas!
STAN
What? [most of the fourth grade boys gather around]
BUTTERS
[stops and catches his breath, then jabs his right index finger at the floor] Guess what Larry Barsky just told me?!
CARTMAN
What?
BUTTERS
[jabs his finger again] Guess!
KYLE
Just tell us, Butters.
BUTTERS
There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad.
CRAIG
Oh, we have a new cheerleader?
CLYDE
What's she look like?
KENNY
(Yeah, what's her name?)
CARTMAN
[taking control of the situation] Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most.
[The school gym, moments later. Some double doors are open and Butters peeks in. The other boys gather behind him, and soon all their jaws drop.]
BUTTERS
Look, look, there she is. [near the bleachers opposite the doors are five girls: Red, Wendy, Bebe, Lola, and Jenny. Between Wendy and Bebe are two pompoms waiting for a sixth cheerleader, who arrives shortly. It's a black girl. The other five girls begin talking to her all at once]
CARTMAN
Oh my God. Tolkien, aren't you stoked? [Tolkien looks over at him. The girls start practicing] Aww, that's awesome, Tolkien. I'm happy for you.
TOLKIEN
[anger flashes across his face] Why?! Why are you happy for me?!
CARTMAN
Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?
TOLKIEN
Nothing! [walks away]
CARTMAN
[confused] What the? ...Oh, Tolkien's shy. Oh my God, that is adorable.
[Fourth Grade class, some time later. Mr. Garrison is at the blackboard teaching the class about Game of Thrones]
MR. GARRISON
And so what we start to see now is a pattern in world history much like the Greeks and the Romans. Remember that there were seven families fighting for control of the land of Westeroth. The king of Westeroth was who? Robert Baratheon [circles BARATHEON on the board], and he asked Eddard, also known as, of course, Lord Stark, to serve as hand of the king. You remember that Lord Stark accepted, or course. The queen's family - that's the Lannisters - were really trying back then to take control, weren't they? So where were the Targaryens at this time? Well, they were across the sea. We all talked about how they were also trying to take the throne. So we've got the Greeks, the Romans, the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, Targaryens, all headed for a big blowout right in Season 2. Now, what I really wanted to get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess- [during the lecture, the following takes place]
CARTMAN
[fairly whispering throughout, beginning when Mr. Garrison mentions Lord Stark. He sits between Tolkien and the new girl and grins as he looks at each of them by turn] Dude... Tolkien! [jerks his head a bit in the girl's direction and points at her] Tolkien. Dude. [Tolkien looks at him, then goes back to taking notes. Cartman smiles] Psst. Tolkien. [points to the girl again, but puts his right hand up so she doesn't notice. Tolkien is annoyed] Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Tolkien! Yeah, get in there.
KYLE
[annoyed as well] Will you shut the hell up?! [goes back to taking notes. Cartman finally picks up his pen, but doesn't write anything]
CARTMAN
...Tolkien. You want me to pass her a jelly bean?
TOLKIEN
[whispers back] No!
CARTMAN
Huh?
TOLKIEN
[louder] No!
MR. GARRISON
[stops talking and turns to the class] Tolkien, is there a problem? [Tolkien is a loss for words, but Cartman fields this question]
CARTMAN
Ah, he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis. [begins to laugh at his own joke] Right guys? [tries to hold the laugh in]
MR. GARRISON
Everyone pay attention! [goes back to the board] Now, what I really wanna get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess that's pretty hard to keep straight, isn't it? The Night's Watch- [while Garrison resumes his lesson, Cartman resumes his prodding]
CARTMAN
[quickly looks at the girl and at Tolkien] Tolkien. [leans back in his seat so Tolkien has a clear view of the girl] Dude, dude. Dude.
[South Park Elementary, hallway. Bebe and Red are at Bebe's locker, talking.]
RED
So then Kelly I guess told Stacey that she wasn't invited, so now Stacey's pissed at us.
CARTMAN
[approaching] Hey, guys? Can I talk to you?
BEBE
[shuts her locker] Why?!
CARTMAN
[motions to his left] Just, can I talk to you, real quick? [walks the girls over to the end of the hallway] What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Tolkien?
RED
About Tolkien? Why?
CARTMAN
Well, Tolkien's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know.
BEBE
Tolkien likes Nichole?
CARTMAN
Yeah, of course. [the girls look at each other]
RED
Oh yeah, I don't think she has any idea.
CARTMAN
Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move?
BEBE
Okay.
CARTMAN
Thanks, you guys.
[Bebe's basement, day. She and the other five cheerleaders are playing the board game, Living. Lola rolls the dice and releases them.]
LOLA
[moves up four steps] One two three four, sorry Bebe.
BEBE
Oh, that's okay. [the girls laugh about it] So, Nichole, guess what? One of the boys here already has a crush on you.
LOLA, JENNY, RED, AND WENDY
Ohhh.
NICHOLE
Oh my gosh, who?
RED
That boy Tolkien.
WENDY
Oh he's really nice, Nichole. I dated him for a little while. [the other girls chime in, showing their support. The camera pulls back a bit, and Cartman is shown eavesdropping just outside a basement window]
NICHOLE
Oh jeez, thanks you guys, but to be totally honest, I kinda think this other boy is cute.
BEBE
[excited] Who? Whowhowhowho?
NICHOLE
That kid, with the orange coat and the green hat?
WENDY
Oh, you mean Kyle?
NICHOLE
Yeah.
THE GIRLS
Ooooh, Kyle.
CARTMAN
WHAT?! KYLE?! [the girls don't hear him]
BEBE
Nichole loves Kyle! Nichole and Kyle sittin' in a tree.
THE GIRLS
K-I-S-S-O-M-G!
NICHOLE
Haha, shut up you guys! It's just a crush. [the girls laugh while Cartman gets livid]
CARTMAN
Motherfucker! [gets up and runs off]
[South Park Elementary, next day. The girls are practicing on the football field as three random boys watch from the bleachers]
THE GIRLS
We are Cows, proud and true! Count on South Park, moo moo moo! Goooo Cows! [Cartman approaches Nichole]
CARTMAN
Hey, ah, Nichole, right?
NICHOLE
Yeah. [Wendy stops practicing]
CARTMAN
Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here? [takes her to another set of bleachers nearby] Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle?
NICHOLE
[taken aback and embarrassed] Oh no, who told you that?
CARTMAN
Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know. [fakes a sweat] Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know ...together?
NICHOLE
Ohhh.
CARTMAN
Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it sucks, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had.
NICHOLE
Wow, I-I'm sorry. I totally respect that. [puts her right hand on his left shoulder] Hey, thanks a lot for telling me.
CARTMAN
Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out.
NICHOLE
[withdraws her hand] Oh, I'm sorry.
CARTMAN
Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch. [snaps his fingers and walks away]
[The hallway, later. Kyle is at his locker putting some books away. Nichole approaches him]
NICHOLE
Hey, uh, I just wanna let you know, if you ever need somebody to talk to, I'm here.
KYLE
Oh, thanks. [smiles. Nichole turns and walks away, smiling. Kyle sees Craig and Timmy nearby and runs towards them] Dude, that new girl's into me!
[Another hallway. Cartman hides around the corner and makes like he's real cool, wearing shades and with hands in his jacket pockets, one foot resting on the wall. Butters walks past him on the cross-hallway without noticing]
CARTMAN
Psst Butters. Butters! [Butters stops and notices, then walks over to Cartman] At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room.
BUTTERS
How come?
CARTMAN
[takes off his shades] Let's just say that by this time tomorrow, Tolkien and Nichole are gonna be practically married.
BUTTERS
Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other.
CARTMAN
No no. [walks him towards the camera] Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push.
[The football field, after PE. Nichole packs her pompoms away as Butters arrives with towels for Nichole to deliver]
BUTTERS
Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys' locker room. [hands her the towels]
NICHOLE
Oh, he does? [Butters nods] Okay.
[The boys' locker room. Tolkien is taking a shower alone when Cartman leans in to check on him, then walks away. The other boys are changing into their regular clothes.]
CARTMAN
Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys! [the boys make a break for the front of the school and exit the front doors]
[In front of the school.]
CRAIG
Where?
JIMMY
I-I don't see a b-b-Bat-Mobile.
[Back at the gym, Nichole reaches the boys' locker room, opens the door, and backs into the room. Cartman looks from around a corner and sees her go in. He has a chain and lock with him, and as soon as the door closes he goes and locks them with the chain]
NICHOLE
[keeps walking, unaware of what Cartman just did] Hello??
TOLKIEN
[walks in dressed in a towel and drying his face with another] AAA!
NICHOLE
OH! Oh gosh I'm so sorry!
TOLKIEN
Where is everybody? What's goin' on??
NICHOLE
Coach wanted me to... [winces and gets embarrassed] I'm sorry. [drops the towels, turns and goes back to the doors. She tries to open them but can't]
[The neighborhood, afternoon. Some of the students are walking together: Kyle, Craig, and Timmy in back, Lola and Jenny up front.]
KYLE
Hey guys. Guys! Hold up. [runs up to the girls, who stop and turn to face him] Hey uhm, you're kind of friends with that Nichole girl, right?
JENNY
Yeah?
KYLE
Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know?
LOLA
She likes... movies, cats.
JENNY
[to Lola] She likes basketball.
KYLE
Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys!
LOLA
Well- Hey Kyle, [he stops and returns] we were gonna head over to the mall. You wanna go with us?
KYLE
Oh. Uh, can't right now, but maybe another time. See ya! [runs off]
JENNY
Guess he has a crush on Nichole.
LOLA
[looks away for a moment] I don't think so. I heard Kyle swings for the same team.
JENNY
Really?!
KYLE
[back with Craig and Timmy] It's perfect! I could take her to a basketball game. [looks back at the girls, who look at him, then giggle as he turns back to the boys] Man, I-I don't know what's happenin', but... it seems like all the girls are... kind of into me lately. [looks back at the girls and waves. They grin and wave back]
[Back in the locker room, Tolkien tries to get himself and Nichole out, but groans and doesn't get anywhere]
TOLKIEN
Hey! In here! [punches the door]
NICHOLE
You think the janitors are still here?
TOLKIEN
Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. We've got water, and, and maybe somebody even left some food laying around. Come on. [takes her around the locker room. Nichole notices a table with food and some other things on it]
NICHOLE
Look! [walks to the table] Somebody left a deli platter. [Tolkien joins her] And board games. And massage oil.
TOLKIEN
Oh... Good.
[The school, just after sunrise. Firefighters have arrived at the locker room and have snapped the chain in two with bolt cutters.]
[The school, out front. The firefighters have taken Tolkien and Nichole outside and left them alone as they leave.]
NICHOLE
Well that was sure an interesting night.
TOLKIEN
It sure was.
NICHOLE
Hey, thanks a lot for making me feel safe in there. That could have been really scary.
TOLKIEN
Yeah. Now that it's over, I... I guess it was kind of fun. [smiles]
NICHOLE
Yeah, it kind of was. Maybe... I-I don't know. Maybe we should get some lunch tomorrow.
CARTMAN
[hiding in the bushes, weeping silently] Oh my God, sooo cute.
TOLKIEN
I'd like that.
NICHOLE
Cool. Well... thanks again. [they hug each other]
CARTMAN
[sweetly] Ohhhhh my God.
CUPID ME
[pops out of Cartman's head] We did it, Eric. We found them each other's ray of sunshine.
CARTMAN
You're my ray of sunshine, Cupid Me. [tickles the little cupid]
CUPID ME
Teeheeheehee. [pops back into Cartman's head, leaving behind a trail of hearts]
[Montage. Cartman sings "I Swear" as Tolkien and Nichole get to know each other better.]
CARTMAN
I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
You can be sure I know, my heart
Girl I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear (I swear) like a shadow that's by your side (Keep it down, girl)
I'll be there
For better or worse (better or worse), till death do us part (death do us part)
I'll love you with every black beat of my heart
And I swear. I swear. I s-we-e-e-ear Yeah, I swear. Straight up. What it do?
[South Park Elementary, playground, recess. As the kids play and chatter, Tolkien is pushing Nichole on a swing, then he tickles Nichole and she giggles. Cartman is rather pleased with how things are progressing between Tolkien and Nichole]
CARTMAN
Did you see that? Tolkien was gonna push her, but then he tickled her instead. [behind him, on the merry-go-round, are Stan, Kenny, and Butters. Stan and Kenny are playing with a ball.]
STAN
Dude, why are you so into their relationship?
CARTMAN
I don't know, it's just so... perfect. [Stan and Kenny resume playing]
KYLE
You motherfucker! [runs into view and punches Cartman, who falls on his face]
CARTMAN
Kyle, Jesus Christ!
KYLE
What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!
CARTMAN
Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you?
KYLE
The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!
CARTMAN
Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Tolkien and Nichole! They belong together!
KYLE
Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!
CARTMAN
Oh! Oh, I'm a racist, huh?! I'm a racist! It's how nature works, Kyle! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez? [points to a Hispanic couple riding play elephants] Is it a coincidence they ended up together?!
STAN
Actually, I heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago.
CARTMAN
Oh did they? I hadn't heard about that.
CUPID ME
[reappears, and Cartman smiles at him] Teehee, that was us, remember, Eric?
CARTMAN
Shh, quiet, Cupid Me.
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
Nothing.
KYLE
Who is Cupid Me?
CARTMAN
Nobody.
KYLE
You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple!
CARTMAN
Why, Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Tolkien and Nichole?! Look at how happy they are! [can't fault him there. Nichole giggles again. Kyle looks defeated] Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic?!
KYLE
Goddamnit! [walks away angrily]
[Nichole's house, night. Inside, she and her parents are eating dinner: turkey, mashed potatoes, veggies. Nichole begins to fiddle with her food and look at the ceiling dreamily.]
DAD
[clears his throat] Nichole? Your mother tells me that you already have a boyfriend at school.
NICHOLE
His name is Tolkien. He's really nice.
DAD
Well that's good. But... your mother tells me that this boy is... black.
NICHOLE
So?
DAD
Well, Nichole, it's just... You know, just because you're black doesn't mean you can only date black boys. It's just a little weird that we moved to this whole new place and you're immediately drawn to the one other black person.
MOM
Oh stop, William. There's nothing wrong with her dating a black person.
WILLIAM
I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm just saying... she's gonna have to deal with racist people out there! People turning their heads and saying, "Oh, look at the two black people together. That figures!"
NICHOLE
It's not like that, Dad. We just happen to like each other. I know it seems like a strange coincidence, but it really is. A coincidence.
MOM
And we are very happy for you, sweetheart. Here, have some more turkey.
WILLIAM
Yeah, just try the white meat. I know it's a little dry, but... there's a lot more of it.
[Cartman's house, night. He's pounding on the bathroom door.]
CARTMAN
Come on! [pounds on the door some more] Other people have to use the bathroom, you know? Can you hurry it up in there?! [pounds on the door some more. The door opens and Cupid Me floats out]
CUPID ME
Teeheeheehee, teehee.
CARTMAN
Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?!
CUPID ME
[giggles] Sorry. [Cartman goes in]
CARTMAN
That's- Oh, oh, Cupid Me! [covers his nose with his bath robe] Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?!
CUPID ME
Teeheeheeheeheehee.
CARTMAN
Dude, at least flush the toilet! [walks over to it] Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts.
CUPID ME
They're fudgey charms of sunshine.
CARTMAN
You're my fudgey charm of sunshine. Come here, you! [tries to catch Cupid Me, but Cupid Me keeps away]
CUPID ME
Teeheeheehee, teeheeheeheehee. [flits here and there]
CARTMAN
I'm gonna get you! [chases Cupid Me out of the bathroom]
CUPID ME
Teeheehee, no! [flits on down the hall]
CARTMAN
I almost got you! Almost! [Liane walks out of her room with clean laundry, and there's no sign of Cupid Me]
LIANE
[sees Cartman dancing around] Everything okay, sweetie?
CARTMAN
Everything's great, Mom. [to the invisible Cupid Me] No! Come back here and flush the toilet, you silly! Noohoho! [dances away]
[Nichole's room, evening. She checks out the teddy bear she thinks she got from Tolkien. She reads the tag: "To My Boo." She turns the tag over and reads it, her smile vanishing: "'Cuz Blacks Belong Together"]
NICHOLE
Oh no...
[South Park Elementary, next day. Tolkien is at his locker in the hallway, and Nichole approaches him. Tolkien closes his locker door, not noticing her coming.]
NICHOLE
[sad] Hey Tolkien.
TOLKIEN
[smiles and turns around] Hey Nichole.
NICHOLE
Can I talk to you for a sec?
TOLKIEN
Sure! [she takes him to the same drinking fountain Kyle took Jenny and Lola to earlier] What's up?
NICHOLE
Listen, I... ugh, I don't think this is gonna work out.
TOLKIEN
Oh.
NICHOLE
I'm so sorry. It's just... I don't believe we're really on the same page, you know?
TOLKIEN
Okay...
NICHOLE
I think you're really great... W-w-we just...
TOLKIEN
I think... you're really great.
NICHOLE
...I'm sorry.
TOLKIEN
Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'll see you around. [turns and walks away sadly]
NICHOLE
Okay. [she turns towards the drinking fountain]
[Cartman's room, that afternoon. Cartman is devastated.]
CARTMAN
[crying inconsolably and blowing his nose into a tissue] It's not fair! They were so... happy!
BUTTERS
[holding Cartman's right hand] It's gonna be okay, Eric.
CARTMAN
It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other!
BUTTERS
They'll find love somewhere else.
CARTMAN
No, they won't!
BUTTERS
Yes, they will.
CARTMAN
No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole!
CUPID ME
[pops out again] Teeheehee. Looks like somebody could use a little arrow of sunshine.
CARTMAN
And you! I should have never believed in you!
BUTTERS
In... In who, Eric?
CARTMAN
[grabs the imaginary cupid] I never wanna see you again! [hurls it into his closet door. It flies low. Cartman gets out of bed, grabs a bat that's conveniently leaning against his bedroom door, and bashes the cupid over and over] Take! Your sunshine! And fuckin'! Die! [puts the bat up against the door and crawls back into bed. Butters takes Cartman's hand again and Cartman resumes crying]
[The park, late afternoon. Tolkien is sitting alone on the park bench. Kyle walks by and notices him there. A few seconds later, he walks up.]
KYLE
Hey man. You okay?
TOLKIEN
Yeah.
KYLE
[sits next to him] What happened? It just didn't work out?
TOLKIEN
Yeah, I guess.
KYLE
So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... It's done?
TOLKIEN
[long sigh] Yeah.
KYLE
[scratches his head behind the ear] So then, she's gonna be seeing other people? Is she, sort of, available?
TOLKIEN
Yeah, we're through.
KYLE
Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy?
TOLKIEN
[getting the wrong idea] I'm sorry Kyle. I like girls. [gets off the bench and walks away]
KYLE
Huh? [suddenly remembers] Dude, what the fuck?
[Cartmans house, afternoon. Cartman is in the living room watching TV in the dark, wrapped in a blanket and eating chocolate fudge ice cream.]
ANNOUNCER
We'll be back with more of the Jeffersons right after this.
[Commercial. A businessman finishes his work day.]
MAN
[leaves his office] I work hard, so I need a laxative that works hard too! [walks off. Next he's on the ground floor] I can't be constipated on the job. [stops and holds up a box] That's why I need... Soft Serve. [at a tennis court. He serves] Because when I'm constipated, sometimes even a hard push isn't enough. [Cartman's interest is aroused. In the commercial the man is heading for the restroom. Another businessman comes out and the first one stops him] Don't give up. Get back in there and get to work! [now trying to poop in the toilet] 'Cause when the going gets tough, the tough gets going!
CARTMAN
That's right... That's right! [runs up to his room, goes into his closet and digs through his stuff until he finds the shoe box he put Cupid Me into after whacking him almost to death. He takes off the lid] Ohhh. [Cupid Me is shown laying face down battered and bruised, with a dry blood stream still near his mouth] I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you.
CUPID ME
No, you don't.
CARTMAN
Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything.
CUPID ME
No, you don't. [opens its right eye for a second]
CARTMAN
Please, I can't do this alone. They need us. And I need you. My little flicker of twinkle stars. [tickles the cupid]
CUPID ME
Teehee, stop it.
CARTMAN
Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do.
CUPID ME
Teeheehee, teeheeheehee, [flies out of the box] teeheeheeheeheeheeheeheehee.
[Nichole's house, day. Cartman pounds on her door, and her father William answers.]
CARTMAN
Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important.
WILLIAM
I'm sorry, but she's at the Denver Nuggets game.
CARTMAN
Denver Nuggets game?
WILLIAM
Yeah, she went with a nice white, Jewish boy.
CARTMAN
[dolly zoom] NOOOOOOO! [runs away quickly]
[The Pepsi Center, around 7 pm. The bleachers are filled with cheering fans waiting for the game to begin.]
ANNOUNCER
Welcome to today's matchup between the Denver Nuggets and the Los Angeles Clippers. [the starting five from both teams take the court. A vendor hands Kyle two drinks, one of which he gives to Nichole. They look at each other fondly and take sips from their sodas.] And now, here to sing the National Anthem, country music star Brad Paisley. [he stands at center court and waves as a spotlight shines on him]
BRAD PAISLEY
O! say can you see by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars- [As Brad sings, Kyle and Nichole look at each other and smile, then look at Brad. Nichole notices someone clear across the center. It's Tolkien, with Craig and Clyde. Tolkien still has a heavy heart, keeping his eyes focused on the floor while Craig and Clyde smile. Kyle looks at Nichole, who's still surprised to see Tolkien there, and grins at her. She looks back at Kyle and smiles.]
[Outside, a tour bus drops Cartman off near the center and Cartman runs for it.]
CARTMAN
Nooooooo!
[Inside.]
ANNOUNCER
Nuggets fans, please direct your attention to center court and the president of Halitosis Kidz. [she's shown on the MegaTron waving to the spectators behind four men who are holding a Halitosis Kidz banner], who invites you to join the Denver Nuggets in the fight against morbid halitosis in children. [POV change from MegaTron to center court] Here to attempt a three-point shot for adolescents with terminally bad breath is [two of the men leave with the banner and an obese girl steps forward] the poster child for Halitosis Kidz, Stacy Muleburg. [the two other men cover their noses with their Denver team jackets as one of them hands Stacy the ball. She rushes up and throws the ball, but it's a brick] And a good try. [the two Denver men, two cameramen, the announcer, and the HK president all gather round her]
STACY
Aaahahahaaaa.
ADULTS
Awww! [they all back away as fast as they can. The spectators clap for the effort. Kyle and Nichole clap as well]
CARTMAN
[running into the center] NOOOOOOO! [triggers an alarm]
GUARD
Tickets please.
CARTMAN
No time! NOOOOOOO!
ANNOUNCER
We're all set for the tipoff. [The ball is thrown into the air and a Clipper tips the ball. A Nugget - Arron Afflalo - grabs it and the game begins. Afflalo throws it to JaVale McGee for an alley-oop, and McGee makes the first shot. The crowd cheers]
CARTMAN
Attention! Attention please! [Kyle and Nichole are surprised to hear his voice. Cartman is on the MegaTron] This is a message for all of you out there who have just ended a relationship. Sometimes, love is hard. But you can't just run away from it. When you start to have something special you have to work at it! [Tolkien is surprised to see Cartman there too, but Craig and Clyde are unfazed] Even though it might seem like the world is against you, you still have to hold on! With both hands! [Nichole begins to take this in] Don't let society dictate who you can and can't be with. Kyle, I love you babe. You can run all you want, try to pretend you like girls, but damnit, when we kiss there's magic! Don't let it go, Kyle. [Kyle is getting pissed off]
CROWD
Awwwww. [everyone looks at Kyle]
CARTMAN
I want to hold you every morning and love you every night, Kyle. I promise you nothing but love and happiness.
I swear by the moon and the stars and the sky
[Cartman and Kyle are paired on the MegaTron and the lovecam is activated - a heart appears over their images, Cartman on the left, Kyle on the right]
I'll be there, Kyle
I swear [Crowd: "Awwww." Kyle tries to push it all away] like the shadow that's by your side
Kyle, swear to God I'll be there.
For better or worse [Brad appears: "better or worse"], till death do us part [Brad: "death do us part"]
I'll love you with [Cartman and Brad] every gay beat of my heart!
BRAD
I swear, Kyle.
CARTMAN
I swear, Kyle. [the crowd erupts in applause, as do the players. Kyle leaves his seat, steaming mad]
NICHOLE
Where are you going?
KYLE
That fat turd up there is the one who set up you and Tolkien 'cause he thinks blacks belong together! [walks away]
NICHOLE
He did that? Oh no.
CARTMAN
Thank you! Thank you all. That's all I wanted to say. That and... The Bat-Mobile's outside. [now with urgency] Seriously you guys, you gotta see it. It's the Bat-Mobile! It's outside.
SPECTATOR
What? [leaves his seat. Soon everyone is leaving the center, including the players from both teams. Tolkien and Nichole find themselves looking at each other just outside the bleachers]
NICHOLE
Tolkien. Hey.
TOLKIEN
Hi.
NICHOLE
Tolkien, I'm so sorry. I thought you were only with me because I'm black.
TOLKIEN
I'm sorry too. I wouldn't even talk to you at first because you were black. [they turn aside for a moment to avoid each other]
BOTH
Do you think we could... Do you still want to... [they smile at each other]
NICHOLE
Maybe we can give it another try?
TOLKIEN
There are still people who will look at us funny. And think we're supposed to be together.
NICHOLE
Let them look. I don't care.
TOLKIEN
I don't care, either. [Cartman has a camera trained on them, while he takes up the whole screen on the MegaTron, praying for this to work out]
NICHOLE
I just think you're a great person. The color of your skin doesn't matter.
TOLKIEN
YAY! [they run to each other and hug each other]
CARTMAN
Oh my gohhhd, so cute! [runs out of the control room. Cupid Me appears]
CUPID ME
Teeheehee, a place for everything, and everything in its place.
CARTMAN
That's right, Cupid Me. People who are the same belong together.
CUPID ME
That's right, and I found somebody who's just the same as you!
CARTMAN
Really?!
CUPID ME
There she is! [points to Stacy, who turns around and growls at Cartman, showing her rotten teeth]
CARTMAN
What?! Fuck you, Cupid Me!
CUPID ME
Teeheeheeheehee, fuck you! [gives him the finger and then goes and shoots some arrows onto Stacy's face. Stacy's pupils become hearts]
CARTMAN
Hey, stop it!
STACY
Haaagh! [Cartman spins around and runs. Stacy gives chase]
CARTMAN
Nooo!
STACY
Haahahaagh!
End of Cartman Finds Love

synopsis:South Park Elementary takes steps to address footballâ€™s concussion crisis.

script:Sarcastaball

[Invesco Field, Denver, Colorado, night. A Goodyear blimp hovers over the packed stadium. The broncos face off against another team.]
DAN
[describing the action on the field] Artonius Jackson catches the ball [Jackson makes his way around a group of players], he's running down the sideline- [Jackson gets tackled to the ground by #48] Oh!
[the Marsh house. Randy, drinking some Smores beer, has the fourth graders over so they can study the game.]
RANDY
BOHHHHH! Did you see that hit? BOOOOM!
DAN
Jackson stops at the 45 and he is slow to get up. [once he's up, he dusts himself off.]
RANDY
That was a great hit boys. Remember that at practice tomorrow.
COMMENTATOR
Yeah, Jackson took a real shot and... [Jackson dusts himself off and turns around] well I'm not sure what he's doing now, but uh, it appears as if he's looking for his keys, Dan.
DAN
Yeah, and that doesn't make a lot of sense, because ever since his concussion in '06, he doesn't even have a license.
COMMENTATOR
Coach Martin is coming over to tell him that now, but Jackson appears to think he's in a car driving home. [the coach tries to get his attention]
DAN
Well, during this time out we're happy to be joined by the commissioner of the NFL, Roger Goodell. Commissioner, a lot of hoopla about concussions this year in the NFL. How's the league handling all that?
GOODELL
Well, there certainly are interesting statistics coming out, Dan, and we are deeply concerned, anduh and waiting to see if there's... really any direct correlation between football and head trauma.
DAN
Oh, and it looks like some of the MFL alumni are takin' the field now. There's All-Pro safety Martin Gregors [fat, but the most lucid of the alumni. He stops and waves to the crowd], and fullback Jim Harris. Looks like his pants are down around his ankles. [Harris stops and waves]
COMMENTATOR
Somebody should let him know. Oh, and Old Surehand Mike Tafthill [a black alumnus who's stooped and walking slowly holding an imaginary tray], who seems to be baking an imaginary cake, Dan.
DAN
Yeah, not sure if that's meant to be a cake or, or perhaps a, a loaf of bread, but he definitely thinks he's baking something.
BUTTERS
Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it.
STAN
You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports.
BUTTERS
That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking.
CARTMAN
That's right, Butters.
DAN
And with that the Browns are ready to kick it off back to the Broncos
RANDY
All right all right, here we go boys! Watch them on the kickoff, all right? Special teams are the most important plays.
KYLE
We don't have kickoffs anymore. [only the TV is heard for a few seconds]
RANDY
[looks at Kyle] Huh?
STAN
The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore.
RANDY
[stands up as his eyes widen to saucers] Wait wait wait, wait. Whoa! What! The! FUCK?!
[South Park Elementary, night. The parents and teachers are gathered in the library for a PTA meeting]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[flanked by Mr. Adler and Mr. Mackey] Okay, before we get started with this PTA meeting, does anyone have any outstanding issues?
RANDY
Yeah, I'd like to talk about this genius new rule in the football program about no kickoffs?
MR. MACKEY
Uh, yes, we've decided to go without kickoffs because of the concerns raised over concussions, m'kay?
RANDY
[becoming sarcastic] Oh yeah, we don't want our kids getting hurt playing football! But I think I have a way to make it even better! Why don't we have the players just wear bras?!
MR. ADLER
Bras?
RANDY
Yeah, the players should all wear bras! And instead of helmets, they should wear little tinfoil hats, 'cause, you know, it's the future and we shouldn't be so barbaric! [other parents look at each other and whisper amongst themselves]
LINDA
How would the bras and tinfoil hats make it safer?
RANDY
Oh, you're all not getting it! See, while we're at it, we'll have a balloon instead of a ball, and whoever catches the balloon tries to run while all the other players hug!
MR. MACKEY
Huh. You, you, think the students would like that?
RANDY
Oh they'd love it! A sport where safety is all that matters? How about we call it "sarcastaball"?!
MR. MACKEY
Mmkay, would, would you mind being the coach of the South Park sarcastaball team?
RANDY
[angry that no one is with him on this - that is, that no one has caught on to his sarcasm] Jesus Christ! Yes, I would love to be the coach of the sarcastaball team!
[South Park Elementary football field, day. And lo and behold, there's Randy as the coach, not something he was hoping for last night. Eleven boys are present, with Butters leading one team and Cartman the other. Butters does the kickoff to Cartman's team, and DogPoo catches it. The opposing players now hug each other. Stan and Kyle hug, and Stan looks at Randy]
STAN
Dad, do we really have to wear bras?
RANDY
Yes Stan, this is what people want! Don't worry, you look really cool. [thumbs up]
BUTTERS
I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Err, what should I do with it?
RANDY
Oh, you know, try to get it into the end zone, but be really polite about it.
BUTTERS
Okay! Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh, [passing Clyde and Kevin] you guys look terrific. Wow, this game is great!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[walks up to Randy] How's it going, coach?
RANDY
How's it going? Awesome! Nobody's getting hurt and the kids are learning valuable life lessons! 'Cause hugging and safety are what the world is all about!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
So you're happy with these changes?
RANDY
Happy? I'm thrilled! Look at how much better this is!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[surveys the situation and decides to leave] Okay. [The boys are still hugging each other and Randy blows his whistle]
[News 4 Special Report]
ANCHOR
Is football safe for your kids? Concerned Parent Randy Marsh says "No," and has started a movement to reform the sport, gathering followers by the hundreds.
[A rally at the park. Randy continues being sarcastic, but no one catches on.]
RANDY
Oh, this is good! Nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball! [the crowd waits a second, then applauds] Yeah, yeah, we're, we're through with our kids getting knocked on the ground and tackled! Let's make sarcastaball the official school sport nationwide! [the crowd applauds and cheers] Go on, pat yourselves on the back! [and so the crowd members turn and pat each other on the back]
ANCHOR
Showing just how much one concerned parent can do, Marsh then found himself in front of the leaders of Washington.
RANDY
[addressing Congress] Yeah, yeah! Let's do that! We got the economy in the toilet, a big election coming up, but this country's number one priority should be making football safer! [Congress applauds. The President and his wife are present, and clap with Congress.]
[South Park Elementary, boys' locker room. The team is suiting up, with bras and tinfoil hats the last items to go on. DogPoo walks in]
KYLE
[removes his bra and throws it to the floor] This is ridiculous! Are we really going to go out there and play North Park like this?!
CLYDE
I can't even remember if we're supposed to hug the fullback or compliment him. I'm so confused.
STAN
This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team!
CARTMAN
Yeah, you know what? [removes his bra and throws it to the floor] Screw this!
BUTTERS
Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing! [silence] We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!
KYLE
We don't even understand how this game is played.
BUTTERS
This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met! [walks up to Tolkien] Well Tolkien, you're nicer than anybody I know. [walks up to Clyde] And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!
CARTMAN
That's true.
BUTTERS
Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us? [stands on a bench] Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three!
CLYDE, KENNY
Yeah.
BUTTERS
And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say "Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!" And then you give them a smile!
BOYS
Yeah!
BUTTERS
And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the gooey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!
BOYS
[jumping up and down] Yeah! Yeah!
CARTMAN
[puts his bra back on] Let's do this. [turns his back towards Stan] Stan, hook up my bra.
[NFL press conference. Roger Goodell is at the podium]
GOODELL
As commissioner of the NFL, I am so thrilled to see our nation's youth embrace sarcastaball over traditional football. Oh, but why stop there? Since football is so barbaric, we should change too. So let's give a biiig welcome to the new coach of the Denver Broncos, Randy Marsh. [Randy gets applause from the audience as he rises. Goodell shakes Randy's hand] Congratulations, Marsh. Good job!
RANDY
Oh thank you, commissioner! I'm thrilled to be a part of this! Thanks!
GOODELL
Nice going!
RANDY
Yeah, no, you nice going! [they're still shaking hands]
PHOTOGRAPHER
Hey guys, how about a nice fucking picture to welcome in the future of sports? [click]
[Invesco Field, Denver, Colorado, night.]
ANNOUNCER
Welcome to the inaugural game of the National Sarcastaball League! As we bring you today's matchup between the Denver Broncos and the Oakland Raiders.

'Cause sarcastaball is so super fun to watch
FAN 1
Woo! Nice job, Cee-Lo! Good to see you on TV some more!
FAN 2
Yeah, I'm a big fan of all your hit songs!
[South Park Elementary hallway, day. The boys are walking to class. Kenny's not around, and Clyde and Craig join them]
KYLE
Dude, what do you mean "We don't have a coach."?
STAN
Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us.
KYLE
But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday!
STAN
[stops and faces his friends] I'm sorry. My dad is taking professional sarcastaball really seriously.
CLYDE
Well, we might as well call up Lakewood and tell 'em we forfeit. [looks down at the floor]
KYLE
We can't.
CLYDE
[somewhat cross] We don't have a coach, Kyle.
CARTMAN
Who needs a coach? We have Butters.
BUTTERS
Huh?
CRAIG
Hey yeah.
STAN
[walks up to Butters] The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory.
BUTTERS
Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas.
CARTMAN
Butters, you understand this game better than anybody.
BUTTERS
Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything.
STAN
Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know?
BUTTERS
'At's in there. It's overflowing sometimes. [sticks out his tongue a bit]
KYLE
[steps in] We need you, Butters. You're the man! [Butters begins to feel the anticipation]
[Butters' bedroom, night. He's in bed asleep, and a dream sequence begins. He's first hoisted up by his teammate and tossed up in the air...]
THE TEAM
Bu-tters! Bu-tters! Bu-tters! Bu-tters!
[Next he's driving a new red sports car down the street and a crowd of fangirls call out to him as he passes by.]
FANGIRLS
Butters, rah, Butters!
A FANGIRL
I love you, Butters!
BUTTERS
[stops his car and looks at the girls] I love you too, ladies. [blows them a kiss]
[Next he's at an ice cream parlor with Wendy, in a booth with access from both ends.]
WENDY
[to Butters' left] Oh Butters, you know how I feel about the captain of sports teams.
RED
[slides in to Butters' right] Leave him alone, Wendy! He's mine! [they each take a cheek and plant a big kiss on him.]
BUTTERS
Woohoohoohoohoo!
[all the excitement in his dreams wakes him up]
BUTTERS
Wuh wuuuhhh wuh! [sits up] Wha? Wha? Oh. [smiles, Then looks under the covers] Ohhh... Daaad! It happened again. [the door opens and Stephen steps in] More of my creamy goo came out. [Stephen sits on the bed]
STEPHEN
Oh. Well uh, that's okay Butters. Remember what we talked about. Sometimes our happy, creamy filling just gets soo full it comes out at night.
BUTTERS
[excitedly] I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-!
STEPHEN
All right Butters, let's... it's happy feelings, let's just not talk about it.
BUTTERS
Okay Dad! [Stephen gets up and walks out, and Butters opens up the top drawer of his night stand. He pulls out a small bottle, gets comfortable again, and collects up all the cream] Oh! Save that, for later. [puts a cap on the bottle]
[Invesco Field, Denver, Colorado, night. It's game time, and the Broncos face the Steelers... in sarcastaball uniforms]
ANNOUNCER
The score is zero to zero as the Steelers kick off to the Broncos.
CHEERLEADER 1
Go Broncos, Go.
DAN
Manning has the ball. He's saying some really great things about the other team. Manning met by LaMarr Woodley. He's giving the balloon to Woodley. The referee comes in. [the ref blows his whistle and raises his arms] Oh, the referee is calling that a touchdown! Oh wait, now another official is signalling that's a safety!
RANDY
[clapping slowly] Oh yeah, nice going, replacement refs!
DAN
They're gonna have to sort this one out with a side judge. [the judge looks at the replay monitor, then looks at the field]
SIDE JUDGE
Fuck it, it's a fucking field goal!
RANDY
YEAH! [pumps his fist] YEAH! WOO!
[Post-game conference. The press is there taking pictures of Randy as he enters the room. Randy stops and grins at everyone]
REPORTER 1
Coach, three to nothing victory over the Steelers. You must feel like a reeeal winner.
RANDY
Yeah, well, the other team was just so awesome on offense I was really scared. [covers his chest with his hands]
REPORTER 1
Coach Belichick says, [reads from a small notepad] "No way we can beat the Broncos. They've had the same coach for almost a day."
RANDY
Oh yeah, I'm just the guy who invented sarcastaball! There's no way I'd know how to coach it!
REPORTER 2
Guess we'll find out on Sunday.
RANDY
...Yeah... [the press leaves and Randy begins to think about next week]
[The Broncos' locker room. While the players change into street clothes, Randy enters the room]
RANDY
All right guys, listen up! Forget about the day off, we need to practice tomorrow.
BRONCOS
D'awwwww!
MANNING
Practice on Monday after a victory? Great!
RANDY
That's good, Peyton, but we need to get better.
MANNING
Practice on Monday? That's just what I wanna do!
RANDY
That's IT! [claps approvingly]
[Butters' house, afternoon. His doorbell rings and he answers]
CARTMAN
Hey Butters, you got a minute?
BUTTERS
Wuh sure, Eric. [Cartman walks in and Butters closes the door]
CARTMAN
I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor.
BUTTERS
Uh-uh oh, no E-Eric, you're, why you're a great player.
CARTMAN
No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters.
BUTTERS
Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?
CARTMAN
...I don't have a dad.
BUTTERS
...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out. [remembers looking at his groin and saying "Oh jeez, there's a lot this time."] But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings.
CARTMAN
You save it all?
[Butters' room, moments later. Butters opens up one of the sliding doors to his closet]
BUTTERS
My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it. [before them is a wall of semen samples that Butters has been collecting for over a year now. Another shot shows that he's going on two years' worth of semen, with shelves of it on the other two walls]
CARTMAN
Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?
BUTTERS
I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way. [Cartman takes a bottle and chugs it down, then analyzes the flavor]
CARTMAN
Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.
BUTTERS
Do you feel warm and compassionate?
CARTMAN
[analyzes some more...] Holy shit I think I do.
[Rome, on CBS Sports Network. Jim Rome appears with his fingers forming a steeple, and with a standalone TV monitor to his left. A balloon appears, with SARCASTABALL shown above it]
JIM ROME
Welcome back to Rome. We're gonna talk some sarcastaball. I can't wait. I can't wait to talk sarcastaball because it's really compelling. [Randy Marsh appears on the monitor via satellite from his den] Joining me now is the coach of the Denver Broncos and the inventor of sarcastaball, Randy Marsh. Thanks for calling in, Randy. Really happy to have you on the show.
RANDY
Yeah, it's awesome to be on your show.
JIM ROME
Randy, first off, thanks for taking the sports that we all love and turning it into a sarcastic nightmare. Way to go.
RANDY
Thanks, Jim. 'Cause it's totally what I intended. You know, when I came up with the idea I was sure it was gonna end up like this.
JIM ROME
Well it certainly makes for an exciting game. How about last night's nail-biter that ended zero to zero? That's a game I wanna watch twice. That's a game I wanna watch four times. Check that: I'll watch that game... five times. [POV switch to Randy's den] Good luck on Sunday. I'm sure that'll be another game that I could watch... twelve times. Check that: thirteen times.
RANDY
Thanks Jim. [closes the satellite link and switches to a window about sarcastaball strategies and starts working on them. Sharon walks in]
SHARON
Randy, aren't you gonna come join your family for dinner?
RANDY
Oh yeah, I've totally got time to do that, Sharon! In fact, how about I go downstairs and make a four-course meal for all of you? Check that: a seven-course meal?
SHARON
Randy, something's happened. Are you un-able to stop being sarcastic?
RANDY
Oh, right! I can't stop being sarcastic now!
SHARON
I'm telling you, Randy, I think this sport is doing something to your brain.
RANDY
Right, it's doing something to my brain! And now I can't stop being sarcastic!
SHARON
Do you mean that?
RANDY
Yes! I totally mean it! [breaks down and begins to tear up] Help me, Sharon. Help me.
[Football night at South Park Elementary. The South Park Cows are playing North Park. South Park throws off and the two teams go at each other for hugs.]
BUTTERS
All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Tolkien! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss. [Cartman approaches North Park's #7 and knocks him down. A referee sees this, blows his whistle and walks over to the two players]
SPECTATORS
Awwwwww!
STAN
Cartman, you idiot!
BUTTERS
Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up! [the team cuddles up and Butters continues.] Now what is goin' on out there?
CARTMAN
That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off.
CLYDE
Yeah. We need more of your mojo, Butters.
BUTTERS
Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go. [Butters passes bottles of his semen around to the other boys, and they all drink the bottles down]
[A hospital, day. Randy is in for a CT scan. He's on the tray and slowly goes in head first. His head is scanned and he's soon rolled out of the scanner. Results come in and are posted on an easel in a doctor's office for the doctor to peruse.]
DOCTOR
Uh hum. Mmm. [turns towards Randy and Sharon] I'm sorry, Mr. Marsh, but there appears to be permanent damage.
RANDY
[dejected] Oh boy, this is great! My week just keeps getting better.
SHARON
How do we fix this, doctor?
DOCTOR
You don't. I'm sorry, there... just isn't enough research in how sarcasm affects the brain.
RANDY
So that's it. [gets up and walks around] I should just go home and forget about what this sport has done to me. Let thousands of people play sarcastaball and get hurt too! [points to the doctor]
DOCTOR
Oh, really? You, you think there's a correlation between sarcasm and sarcastaball? [gets into a thinking mode] Really? [rolls his eyes] That's fascinating. Please, go on.
RANDY
No, sarcastaball has nothing to do with it. I just... I just really enjoy being sarcastic and so I must be finding an excuse.
DOCTOR
You know, I have a 50-year-old Alzheimer's patient out in the waiting room who can't even remember his family, but... let's forget about him and focus on how sarcastaball might be damaging people's brains.
RANDY
My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety!
DOCTOR
Okay, well I've got a better idea. Let's get all the funding for cancer research and genetic diseases, let's, let's take all that money and make commercials that say "Hey America, sarcasm might not be such a great thing for your brain."
RANDY
Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much! [turns left and leaves, and Sharon is thoroughly confused. She looks around]
[A commercial]
JIM ROME
Jim Rome here. Hey, I love sarcastaball just as much as the next guy, but sometimes it's so thrilling I need an extra burst of energy to get me through a game. That's when I reach for a bottle of this. [holds up a small bottle, now in mass production] Butters' Creamy Goo. [the commercial follows]
VOICE-OVER
[#18 runs with the balloon] You play hard. You need a sports drink that gives you that extra boost. [a split screen appears, with windows for football, basketball, women's soccer, and hockey] Sports these days are all about being nice, so take your game to the next level [#18 opens up a bottle of Butters' Creamy Goo and drinks it]. With Butters' Creamy Goo. [a cyclist opens a bottle and drinks it. Some of it splatters on his face] You'll be filled with feelings of good tidings and be nicer than a ray of sunshine. [a round window expands and Butters pops in through it]
BUTTERS
Like me!
JIM ROME
Get with it, and get the Goo!
VOICE-OVER
Butters' Creamy Goo is chock full of all the essentials an athlete needs. Commitment! Compassion! And Comradery! And now it's available in quart size!
TOM BRADY
When I get hot and tired, only one thing can boost my compassion. [drinks it down and keeps it there with some effort. A goo mustache stays on his upper lip] Now I'm back in the game! [Two players carry a bucket of goo and dump it on their coach.]
SINGER
Go and chug a bottle of Butters' Creamy Goo!
VOICE-OVER
[an open bottle of it falls right side up to the grass and some goo spills out] Best served just above room temperature.
[A night game, with South Park against another team]
BUTTERS
42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT! [Cartman tosses the balloon back at him, and the players move forward. Butters backs up for a pass and throws the balloon up. The other team's player, #9, is ready] Oh no, that kid's gonna intercept it! [#9 catches it and grins] Good job, kid! [an SUV rools onto the field, crushing #9 before it stops. The balloon bounces away unscathed. Randy is shown driving the SUV, with Sharon in tow]
RANDY
STAN?! Stan! [the players break their hugs and look at Randy]
STAN
Dad?
RANDY
[runs with Sharon towards him] Get in the car, Stan! We're going home!
STAN
What?
SHARON
We're sorry, Stanley, we don't want you playing this sport anymore.
MR. MACKEY
Hey, get off the field! M'kay?! [Randy walks to the sideline to address the crowd]
RANDY
Everyone! Everyone, listen! There's something you all need to know about sarcastaball. It turns out... it's totally safe. [a lot of fans have bought bottles of Butters' Creamy Goo] Yeah, it's super safe! It's like so safe that we should have every kid play it-ugh! [gets a headache] Oh! Sorry, sorry. Hang on. Gotta not be so sarcastic. Ahem, let me try that again. Listen everyone... if you let your kids play sarcastaball, you're a fucking genius! Ogh!.. Gyugh! Cut, sorry. Let me try this again. [clears his throat again] Look, what I'm trying to say is, we should have like, 10 sarcastaball leagues, because then everyone-! Would- [stomps his right foot in anger] God damn it!
SHARON
Stanley, just get your things and come on. We're going home!
STAN
Whoa, whoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do!
RANDY
Yeah, we're your parents! We can't tell you what to do!
SHARON
Don't you see what this sport has done to your father? Do you want to end up like him?
STAN
Oh, right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets!
SHARON
[stunned at the sarcasm coming from Stan] Ohohh, Randy, it's happening! [cries and turns towards Randy for a hug, which he gives]
BUTTERS
[walks up and stands next to Stan] Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along.
RANDY
Look, the point has been made, okay?! I'm warning you, being this sarcastic is dangerous!
STAN
We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says "Competitiveness can be compassionate," he's being completely sincere?
RANDY
I don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity.
CARTMAN
That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.
STAN
Yeah Dad. You need some of this. [walks forward and gives him a small bottle of Butters' Creamy Goo. Randy takes it and opens it, looking at the contents, then drinks it]
RANDY
...[deadpans] This is cum. [everyone's jaws drop]
[Butters' room, night. Stephen and Linda are in the room, and just outside are Sheila, Randy, Stuart, and Liane.]
STEPHEN
And you can just sit here in your room and think about what you've done! [Butters is on his bed, looking chastened] Just because people try and make football a little safer by changing a kickoff rule doesn't mean YOU need to take it to "Oh, why don't we just drink each other's cum?"! Sarcasm like that is homophobic, chauvinistic, and completely lacking in maturity! Any questions?!
BUTTERS
What's sarcasm and what's cum?
STEPHEN
We'll talk about that when you're older.
RANDY
Come on, everybody, let's work on that kick off change and get back to some football. [all the adults leave, with Stephen closing the door behind him. Butters sighs, then gets under his covers for the night. As he drifts off to sleep, we get this voice-over]
JIM ROME
Welcome back to Rome. Some of you might have seen me on TV last night. Turns out the drink I endorsed was semen. Turns out a little kid was just bein' sarcastic. That kid's probably grounded for a month. Check that: I'm sure he's grounded for two months. And a week. Football needs to be made safer, so why don't we have players in bras drinking semen? Yeah, that's a fastball right there. That's a real stroke of philosophic genius! More little kids drinking semen to finally bring back real football, and I don't know what else to say but "So long, sarcastaball, it was nice knowin' you." Let's just hope nothin' like this ever happens again. Probably won't. Not for another year. Check that: couple of days.
BUTTERS
[wakes up and gasps] DAD! Hey, Dad!
STEPHEN
[walks in] What?
BUTTERS
My wiener is all stiff and pointy!
STEPHEN
Oh, well, Butters, that's just the friendly compass. See, whenever you have friends in the area, your little compass there tells you where they are. It's pointing up because Jesus is your friend.
BUTTERS
Thanks, Dad.
End of Sarcastaball


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Cartman finally admits he's fat and immediately gets a mobility scooter.

script:Raising the Bar

[Wall-Mart, night. The boys are in the sporting goods section if the store. Kenny looks at bats while Cartman looks at gloves. Stan and Kyle look at other things across the aisle.]
STAN
You find a good catcher's mitt, Cartman?
CARTMAN
[looks over his left shoulder] Dude, how come when we play baseball I always have to be the catcher? [looks at the gloves again]
KYLE
Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat.
CARTMAN
[turns left to address Kyle] I'm not fat, Kyle.
KYLE
Right, you're not fat.
CARTMAN
Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like that bitch! [they see a scooter rolls past them with an obese man on it]
STAN
Whoa duude!
KYLE
Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy? [another obese man rolls up behind them]
OBESE MAN
Excuse me. [They just look up at him] Excuse me! [they part the aisle for him - Stan, Cartman and Kenny take the side with the gloves on it, Kyle takes the other side,]
CARTMAN
See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.
KYLE
Why do they even allow those things in stores?
STAN
They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front. [Indeed, a small fleet of them are available for rent, at $19.99 each. They're labeled as electric wheelchairs. Obese people are in line as one after another of them rents a Rascal. The boys turn a corner to have a look at the Rascals as they're being rented]
KYLE
You've gotta be kidding me!
CARTMAN
[eyes some Oreos and goes for them] Oh my God you guys, look at this! [grabs a box and reads it] Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling. [closes his eyes and looks up joyfully] Holy hell yes!
KYLE
Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all?? [an obese man and an obese woman squeeze past each other in an aisle on their scooters.] That's YOU one day, fatass![Stan and Kenny leave] Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year! [turns and follows Stan and Kenny away. Cartman is left alone with the Oreos and his thoughts]
OBESE LADY
[rolls up in her Rascal] Are those Candy Corn Oreos?
CARTMAN
Yeah... Yeah, here you go. [walks over, tosses them into her basket, and walks away with his head down]
[Cartman walks through town. He stops by a large window to look at himself, then walks on. Later he shows up at Kyle's house, and Kyle answers the door]
CARTMAN
Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?
KYLE
Why? [his eyebrows move to odd positions every so often]
CARTMAN
[walks in] I've been... doing a lot of thinking... about what you said at Wall-Mart. [stops] You're right Kyle. I'm fat. [sighs] All these years you tell me and me saying "No, I'm big-boned" or "no, that's just muscle"... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck.
KYLE
Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-
CARTMAN
[turns around] No! It's okay, Kyle... because... I'm not gonna live like some... slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around. Now that I can admit I'm fat, I decided to finally do something about it. [walks out of the house. Kyle is puzzled. Moments later, Cartman returns on a Rascal and rolls on into Kyle's living room] Sweeeeeeeeeet!
KYLE
[angrily] Oh no!
CARTMAN
Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket on the front for my candy corn Oreos. [begins to ride in a circle around Kyle]
KYLE
You don't need that! Get off of it.
CARTMAN
[stops] Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once. [rides away]
KYLE
That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!
CARTMAN
[reaches the restroom and tries to get it, but the base is too wide] Hmm. [tries again. Kyle catches up] I can't. [tries again] I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle. [tries again]
KYLE
What??
CARTMAN
Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle. [tries again] You've gotta make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. [tries again]
KYLE
So take a shit somewhere else!
CARTMAN
That's not the way this country works, Kyle. [tries again] Your bathroom has to be to code for my mobility scooter. [tries again] It's the law.
GERALD
[arrives] What's going on down here?
CARTMAN
[tries again] Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible. [tries again] I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit. [backs out and prepares to leave] Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle. [rolls away. Kyle looks on angrily]
[Cartman rides through town looking self-satisfied while music plays in the background]
CARTMAN
["Nobody understands how embarrassing it is to live with obesity." He rides past a couple] Out of the way. Out of the way please. ["Wherever you go, you're treated differently" He arrives at a Denny's]
GREETER
Uhh I guess take that big booth by the window. [Cartman goes towards the booth and grins]
[South Park Elementary, day. Cartman's soliloquy continues. "You're made to feel different. To feel like less of a person." While the boys are in the gym tossing basketballs at each other, Cartman rides around in the hall outside, grinning all the while. Next, Cartman holds up traffic while riding his Rascal. "I feel so much shame, all I can do is try to make myself feel a little better by flying to Disneyland on the weekend."]
TICKET TELLER
Okay, we're finally gonna start with pre-boarding. Anyone needing special assistance getting on the aircraft- Oh...
CARTMAN
Coming through. Oh how humiliating. [now at the Jungle Cruise at Disneyland: "But even at Disneyland I get reminded of my weight." He rolls into the short line] Scuse me. Gotta go to the front of the line. Oh what shame I feel. [reaches the front of the line] Oh jeez, look how fat I am. I'm just mortified, you guys. Can't believe I have- [finds a line of other scooter riders in front of him] Ay! The fuck is this?! There's a wait for the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the middle isn't even fat! Look at him! He's got no right to be on a Rascal! You're not fooling anybody asshole! Walk to the back of the line!
LEGLESS BOY
I don't have legs.
CARTMAN
Yeah, well you got skinny arms! [Later on, Cartman rolls through Cinderella's Castle. "And then even Disneyland can't take away the shame, as all the people suffering from obesity are ignored. Like, we're invisible." A woman's baby carriage gets in the way and she quickly pulls it back as Cartman rolls towards the exits] 'Scuse me. Move it.
[A courtroom, day. Cartman has been explaining things to the judge at the witness stand... on his Rascal.]
CARTMAN
And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy? [chokes up and begins to sob] At Best Buy I'm sorry. [At the defense table sits a Best Buy employee, looking around] To be told by some Best Buy manager that your mobility scooter can't fit in his bathroom? [reaches for a long-handled grip with his left hand, then uses it to take a tissue from the judge's bench. He grabs the tissue with his right hand and lowers the grip, then blows his nose] Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy?
[News 4 segment.]
ANCHOR
More lawsuits today as people on mobility scooters claim they have nowhere to poo. Property owners are being ordered to modify their bathrooms, costing taxpayers millions. Opponents of the measure are expressing their outrage by engaging in the act of Rascal tipping.
OBESE MAN 2
[being jostled in his Rascal by a group of boys] Stop it you kids! sto- Oop- Owww.[the boys succeed in tipping him over and the man is on his side unable to get up. The kids laugh and scatter, and the man begins to sound like a pig] Weak! Weak!
ANCHOR
The government warns that Rascal tipping can be dangerous, and may lead to fat people shitting their pants as they kick and scream on the floor. To counter the crisis, the Department of Health has called for $25 million in aid, so that all mobility scooters can be fitted with a tip assist device. [The device is shown, and it resembles a telescoping cane]
[South Park Elementary gymnasium, day. Two workers are installing the tip assist device on Cartman's Rascal. Cartman is on his Rascal, and they're both on their sides. When the workers finish, he activates the device, which rights him up]
CARTMAN
Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. [facing him is the rest of the fourth grade class]
KYLE
You have got to be kidding me!
CARTMAN
What, Kyle?! [the device then collapses and puts itself away]
KYLE
We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!
CARTMAN
[rolls up to him] You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!
KYLE
So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!
CARTMAN
Oh! Oh, did you hear him?! [rolls back to the workers] This is exactly what Adele is talking about! [begins to pace back and forth] Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle! [rolls up to Kyle] Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day [rolls away] to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers! [rolls back up to Kyle] You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! Eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look! [rolls to the far end of the gum] I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo!
KYLE
Who's Honey Boo Boo?
STAN
Dude, you've never seen Honey Boo Boo?
[A trophy room. Honey Boo Boo is showing off her trophies from the various beauty pageants she's won]
HONEY BOO BOO
My name's Honey Boo Boo and I'm a beauty queen, bitches. [at a pageant, onstage, dressed to win] I'm fat as a whale and I don't give two shits, girl!
MAMA
Her favorite foods are sketti and butter, and she likes drinkin' Red Bull and Mountain Dew.
HONEY BOO BOO
[back in her trophy room] I'm only six and I've already had three heart attacks, girlfriend!
MAMA
[at a pageant, performs some chest compressions on Honey] Come on! Come on now, Boo Boo! [Honey Boo Boo comes to] Now get up and wave to them judges! [later on, to the camera] We ain't got no shame about our weight, 'cause our weight makes us sassy. [Stan and Kyle are watching the show in Stan's living room. Kyle gets up and walks off]
KYLE
Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore.
STAN
Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing.
[At sea, day, there's the U.S.S. James Cameron, with James Cameron on the bridge]
JAMES CAMERON
This is it! Throttle down!
A CREWMAN
[voice only] Throttle down! [Cameron leaves the bridge and goes on deck, putting on a diving suit]
CREWMAN 1
Mr. Cameron, you don't have to do this! Why don't you just go back to your house in Malibu? Go work on another movie?
JAMES CAMERON
I have to do this! I have to try and raise it!
CREWMAN 1
The bar isn't something that actually lowers, Mr. Cameron.
JAMES CAMERON
Then how do you explain all the fat people on mobility scooters? [points at him] How do YOU account for... Honey Boo Boo? The bar has been lowered to depths we can't even fathom. If anyone can go down there and raise it back, it's ME. [puts on some gloves and gets into a bathysphere. He closes the hatch and locks himself in] Let her go! [two workers pull down the release switches in unison. The crane releases the bathysphere and... it hits the deck below. It rolls to one side towards the edge and then drops off. Under the water, as it sinks, Cameron gets to work] UV lights on. Pressure system is normal. Music, on.
SINGERS
His name is James (James) Cameron, the bravest pioneer.
No budget too steep no sea too deep Who's that? It's him!
James Cameron.
JAMES CAMERON
Systems are normal. You guys hearing the song okay up there?
SINGERS
James (James) Cameron, explorer of the sea
CREWMAN 1
Yes, James, we hear the song.
JAMES CAMERON
Descending to one thousand feet. I don't see the bar yet. Looks like it must have sunk pretty low.
SINGERS
With a dying thirst to be the first. Could it be? Yeah it's him. James Cameron.
[South Park Elementary, day, hallway. The fourth grade boys need to use the restroom. Kyle is pounding at the door, which has been locked from inside]
KYLE
Come on, hurry it up in there! [inside, a toilet and the two urinals have been removed to make room for the wheelchair-accessible toilet. Cartman rolls up the ramp to get to the toilet]
CARTMAN
Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick. [gets off the Rascal]
KYLE
[starting to fume, steps away from the crowd] This has gone far enough! [the other boys turn to look at him] How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?!
TOLKIEN
Yeah, what we need is something to raise awareness.
KYLE
Yeah! We've gotta raise people's awareness!
TOLKIEN
Something like... a documentary. You know, follow Cartman around, with a video camera, and then get all his bullshit on television.
KYLE
Yeah! g'uh... A, a documentary?
TOLKIEN
[walks up to Kyle] At least then we'd be voicing our concern. I mean, if you think about it, we should feel some shame for... complaining about it and not doing anything.
KYLE
You, I gu-I guess you're kinda right.
TOLKIEN
Hey, tell you what: if you wanna follow Cartman around, and get a video of him, I'll pay to make it into a documentary, and get it on the air.
KYLE
Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera! [walks away smiling. Tolkien watches him leave, then walks off in the opposite direction. The rest of the boys go back to waiting at the restroom door. Craig watches Kyle leave, then notices Tolkien and follows him]
CRAIG
Hey Tolkien. If you're gonna get Kyle to video that stuff for you, you should probably tell him the truth.
TOLKIEN
He doesn't need to know the truth. Kyle will get what he wants, and so will I. [hurries away]
[University of Colorado at Boulder. Kyle is there to present his video on obesity. He's onstage before a large audience]
KYLE
Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Tolkien. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue. [clicks on a remote to turn down the lights]
["Tolkien Blaaaaack Productions." Tolkien Black Prod. Presents... a montage.]
TOLKIEN
[voice over. Cartman is shown rolling down the street] He's chubby, [Cartman is shown at a table with lots of courses for him to go through] he's filthy [Cartman belches], and he's just a little bit nuts. [sideswipes a letter carrier and then gives him the finger] Here he is, America's newest sweetheart, Fatty Doo Doo! ["Here Comes Fatty Doo Doo" appears onscreen with a picture of Cartman on his Rascal, with his back to the camera]
KYLE
Fatty Doo Doo?
[What appears looks more like a television pilot than a documentary. Cartman is shown going down the street in downtown South Park, then he's crossing the street on his Rascal. A car stops before it hits him. then he's eating chips in the living room on his Rascal. "The new show by Tolkien black & Kyle Broflovski" appears, then leaves the screen as Cartman rolls down the school hallway, followed by "title song by: Randy Newman"]
[Randy Newman]
KYLE
What?
[Cartman rolls through a line of people waiting to buy movie tickets and knocks out Nelly. Then he's back at Wall-Mart getting some other chips. Then he's on the toilet trying very hard to poop. Another shot of him pooping. The crowd begins to laugh at his antics. Next he's at the dining room table waiting for his powdered doughnut pancake surprise. Kyle looks at the audience's reaction, then at the pilot, which now shows Cartman ordering some stuff from the Wendell's drive-through menu. Then it shows Cartman making a beeline for Disneyland]
RANDY NEWMAN
Nobody scoots a fatty doo like you do.
Scatty foo foo
Patty poo poo
White president, black president, I don't care.
Just scoop me up some doodoo and I'll be right there.
I. Only. Know. Five. Chords. Six-
[Tolkien's office, nicely appointed. Some loud pounding is heard on the door]
TOLKIEN
Come in.
KYLE
[enters and approaches the desk] What have you done?
TOLKIEN
I helped you make a documentary, Kyle.
KYLE
When we said "documentary," I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!
TOLKIEN
Kyle, Kyle, I'm trying to make compelling television.
KYLE
You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Tolkien, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame??
TOLKIEN
[hops off his chair and walks to a window] I can remember... exactly where I was... the first time I saw Honey Boo Boo. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. A shameful, fat family eating white trash food to their death. And then I saw what network it was on: The Learning Channel. [turns around and faces Kyle] If they can feel okay about that, why can't I?
KYLE
When the bar gets lowered, Tolkien, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?
TOLKIEN
But she's not black, Kyle. She's white. [a few seconds of silence] The bar is determined by society, Kyle. And it's not something that can just be raised up. [faces the window again] Not by us, or anyone else.
[The bathysphere. Cameron keeps descending]
JAMES CAMERON
You guys seeing this?!
CREWMAN 1
Yes, we see, Mr. Cameron.
JAMES CAMERON
This is where the bar was just a few years ago. It was lowered here when President Clinton got a blow job in the oval office. And suddenly men who were just getting blow jobs in alleyways thought they weren't all that bad. But clearly something else has lowered the bar even more! I must go deeper! We're in the pipe, five by five.
[Stan's house, porch. Stan sits on the steps as Kyle paces on the lawn]
KYLE
I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?
STAN
I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?
KYLE
Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo Boo.
STAN
[alarmed, gets up and walks up to Kyle] Dude! Dude, not cool!
KYLE
What?
STAN
Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out.
KYLE
[a bit shocked] What? Oh my God.
STAN
Yeah dude. It's really serious.
[The Thompson living room. Mama talks to the camera]
MAMA
Well, the doctor said Honey Boo Boo needs a heart transplant. They're gonna do a surgery and put a pig heart in her, so, we're going to the ranch to pick out a hog.
[In the car, day. Mama and Honey Boo Boo]
HONEY BOO BOO
[clapping] I'mm gettin' a piiig heaaart.
[At the ranch, day.]
MAMA
Honey Boo Boo is gonna do pageants with a pig heart, we wanna pick a hog that has pizzazz and knows how to work it, girl!
HONEY BOO BOO
I waunt that one!
FARMER
This one here? [picks up a sow near them and shows off the sow's belly] You want this one??
HONEY BOO BOO
Yeah! No wait! That pig over there gave me the evil eye! I waunt that one! I waunt [squeezes her eyes closed for a second] that one!
FARMER
This one? [picks up a sow near them and shows off the sow's belly] this one right here?? Ya waunt this one??
HONEY BOO BOO
I want that one's heart! It looked at me funny!
[In the operating room. Mama describes what's going on]
MAMA
We've been in the OR about two hours already. I just hope when she does her pageants the judges don't take away points 'cause she's got a pig heart. [looks over her shoulder] Honey Boo Boo! [no response] Honey BOO BOO!
HONEY BOO BOO
What?!
MAMA
What you gonna tell them judges if they ask you about your heart?
HONEY BOO BOO
I'm gonna tell them "my heart is sweeter than bacon, child!" [Mama turns back to the camera and grins]
[The Thompson kitchen. Mama is preparing a meal for the family]
MAMA
Who waunts sketti and butter? [pig noises are heard and the camera pans down to show Honey Boo Boo crawling all over the floor] She got a pig heart an' now she thinks she's a pachyderm. Show 'em your scar!
HONEY BOO BOO
This is myyy scaaar 'cause I got a pig heart. My scar makes me sassy, child! [blows a kiss to the camera]
[The bathysphere, deeper now than before.]
JAMES CAMERON
S. S. Cameron? This is James Cameron. I am now at... 16,000 feet. You should see the cold darkness of it all. The isolation and yet awwwe of the sea's magnitude. I have now sunk deeper than any human has ever been before! [he soon encounters another man in a diving suit]
RANDY NEWMAN
We are here in the ocean depths goin' deep deep deep- [turns around and sees the bathysphere... and its pilot] Oh hey James Cameron.
JAMES CAMERON
What the fuck?!
RANDY NEWMAN
I've been divin' in the deep and I'm feelin' so cheap.
JAMES CAMERON
You son of a bitch Newman! How did you beat me down here!
RANDY NEWMAN
I don't want anyone raisin' the bar, 'cause nobody'll hire me! Deep deep deep in the ocean. Ohhh, come on. Fight me, Cameron.
JAMES CAMERON
Alright, you son of a bitch! I'll take you to hell! [maneuvers the bathysphere's arms and lands a right punch on Newman, who falls away in slow motion]
[Tolkien's office, day. Kyle now has Cartman with him.]
CARTMAN
It is a violation of my civil rights, Tolkien, and you should be ashamed of yourself!
KYLE
I'm sorry Tolkien, I had to tell him. His life is in danger.
CARTMAN
Making money off of people's handicaps! Well Tolkien, I would like you to meet my lawyer! [the lawyer appears outside the office and tries to enter, but can't. The lawyer is on his own Rascal] As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and desist order! That show is not going to air!
TOLKIEN
[waits a second] It actually aired last night.
KYLE
You found a network to buy it?
TOLKIEN
Yeah, but don't worry. It didn't do so good. We got killed in the ratings by Honey Boo Boo.
CARTMAN
What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!
TOLKIEN
Well it was only our first show of the season, so you really can't-
CARTMAN
[begins riding around] I don't give a shit, dude! Nobody beats my ratings! Get me a plane ticket! That bitch is going down! [turns around and rides out of the office]
[This is an outdoor event, with a wall erected behind the First Lady]
ANNOUNCER
We welcome you to the First Lady's Symposium on Obesity, with your keynote speaker, Michelle Obama. [the audience applauds]
MICHELLE OBAMA
Our country is in the midst of an epidemic. Recently a very big conflict was brought to my attention. [Kyle is present, which means Cartman didn't fly alone] A conflict that illustrates without a doubt what should be our nation's number one priority. What will we do as a country? I cannot give you any easy answers. But what I can give you, is what we've all been waiting for! Honey Boo Boo versus Fatty Poo Poo! [the audience cheers loudly as the bell rings and two men pour sketti and butter onto the grass with five-gallon pots. Tolkien is at Cartman's corner and Mama is at Honey's corner]
CARTMAN
[making 8's with his Rascal and itching for a fight] You're goin' down, bitch! [also in attendance are Butters, Stan, Kevin, and Craig] Nobody takes my ratings!
TOLKIEN
That's good, Fatty, get pissed!
CARTMAN
I'm pissed!
TOLKIEN
Yeah, Fatty!
CARTMAN
Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed!
MAMA
[clapping] Ain't nobody can beat my Boo Boo at sketti wrestlin'! [meanwhile, Honey Boo Boo is striking poses and blowing kisses non-stop]
MICHELLE OBAMA
Let's do this! [the contestants approach each other in the center of the sketti ring as the audience cheers and applauds wildly. Cartman suddenly rushes at her and sideswipes her]
HONEY BOO BOO
[falling to the ground] Ow!
[Cartman looks back, then turns around and rides up to Honey Boo Boo as she gets up, then bumps her down again. The audience is disappointed at this. She gets up much faster this time and waits for Cartman to make his move. He rushes at her again, but she jumps onto him and delivers a flurry of punches at his face. Kyle walks around looking lost. Honey Boo Boo succeeds in knocking Cartman over and he's on his side. Honey delivers several kicks to Cartman's head and begins to squeal like a pig. The audience is cheering for Honey Boo Boo, and she responds by blowing kisses at it. Cartman rights himself up with the tip assist device]
CARTMAN
I ain't done with you, bitch!
MAN
Yeah! Tip assist!
[The S.S. Cameron. Static fills the speakers as communication between the ship and the bathysphere is lost]
CREWMAN 2
You think he's dead? [the first crewman wakes up]
CREWMAN 3
I hope so.
JAMES CAMERON
S.S. Cameron! This is James Cameron! I've found it! My God I found the bar! [the crewmen begin to stir. Soon they're all gathered at the computer monitor] Divert all power to sub systems! Two percent oxygen left! [the bethysphere rises quickly, followed by a long cable] The bar is too heavy! Aaaaagh! Come on you bitch!
CREWMAN 4
Well I'll be damned.
[The symposium. Cartman is dragging Honey Boo Boo across the sketti by her hair, then lets go. Stan approaches Kyle, who's seated at a curb nearby]
STAN
Dude, you okay? [Honey Boo Boo gets up, and Cartman turns back to strike her down again]
KYLE
I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this? [Honey Boo Boo gets up again and looks at Cartman, and he strikes her down once again] Did it start with fat people on scooters?[Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again] Or did the bar get lowered way before that? [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again]And then I started thinking, maybe it was us. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again] I don't know, but maybe somehow, we lowered the bar, a long time ago. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again] And now we're all sittin' here in the stink of it all. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again] There's no going back, Stan. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again. Two men walk up behind Stan and Kyle, and pass by them]
MAN 2
Rrrgh it's like, I can't explain it. I just suddenly feel like this isn't right. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again. Stan notices the men]
MAN 3
I don't know why we were watchin' that garbage in the first place. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again]
KYLE
[catches a hint of what the men were talking about] Huh?
AIDE
[Michelle Obama looks a little faint] Ms. Obama, are you, uh, ma'am? Are you okay?
MICHELLE OBAMA
Something's wrong. This... This is all wrong! [runs into the sketti ring] Stop! Everyone! What are we doing?! How can you let this happen to your daughter?!
MAMA
I don't know, I... How did I let myself go like this? What have I done??
MAN 4
When did we devolve into watching fat kids sketti wrestling?
MICHELLE OBAMA
We need to realize obesity is an epidemic. But it's not a disease. From now on I'm going to dedicate this administration to FIGHTING childhood obesity! [turns to Cartman and begins punching away at him]
CARTMAN
[amid some ows and grunts] Oh! You fucking bitch! [Michelle Obama finally punches him off his Rascal. She picks it up over her head, then smashes it into the ground, breaking it. She then kicks Cartman in the stomach for good measure.]
TOLKIEN
What the hell is going on?
KYLE
I don't know. I think... we've been given another chance.
[The S.S. Cameron, day. The bathysphere has been retrieved and the hatch opens. James Cameron climbs out of it and comes down to the deck to meet the crewmen.]
CREWMAN 5
Hey Cameron, we can't believe it.
JAMES CAMERON
We're done here! Set course for the set of Avatar 2
CREWMAN 6
Mr. Cameron. [Cameron stops] People should know. How you saved us all? How you raised the bar? How will they know what a hero you are?
JAMES CAMERON
[turns around] James Cameron doesn't do what James Cameron does for James Cameron. [turns around and walks a few feet, then turns around again] James Cameron does what James Cameron does because James Cameron is... James Cameron. [the crew applauds him as he enters the bridge]
SINGERS
His name is James (James) Cameron, the bravest pioneer.
No budget too steep no sea too deep Who's that? It's him!
James Cameron.
End of Raising the Bar

synopsis:Cartman signs up for a home security system.

script:Insecurity

[The Broflovski house, night. Upstairs, Gerald and Sheila relax in bed, watching TV. Well, Gerald is, anyway, with his hands behind his head. Sheila is reading a book.]
ANNOUNCER
Erectile dysfunction is a fact of life. You want to show her you love her, but you're old, and so is she. [A middle-aged man brings two cups of wine to the sofa and gives one of them to his middle-aged wife. Next, another middle-aged couple is shown in a row boat, with the husband rowing... slowly] The next time that special moment comes, don't let your sex drive fail you just because your wife looks like a shriveled prune. Fake it, with Cialis. [The Cialis logo scoots in from the right] It won't make her any harder, but it will make you not care for up to three hours. [A third couple is shown holding hands in his-and-her bathrubs on a deck... on the African savannah, with two elephants in the distance.] And then you can still have your own separate bathrub from her later on. [Gerald glances over at Sheila.]
GERALD
[Lowers his arms and leans in a bit] Hey Sheila. You feel like having some fun?
SHEILA
Oh dear, did the Cialis commercial turn you on again?
GERALD
[Puts his left arm around her] How about I put on the uniform?
SHEILA
[Gets excited and bashful] Oh, Gerald...
GERALD
Huh? What do you think? You know you like it.
[Moments later, Sheila is in a negligee and puts some make up on. A knock is heard on her bedroom door and she answers it.]
SHEILA
Oh, hello. [Strikes a sexy pose - right arm on the door, left arm on her hip]
GERALD
UPS man. I have a ...package from Amazon for you.
SHEILA
Oh, dear, but I'm barely dressed.
GERALD
If you'll just... [Whips out a signature pad and presents it to her] sign right here. [Some time later, the bedroom door is closed, the lights are out, and Gerald is really delivering it to Sheila.]
SHEILA
Oh, you're so rough with me, Mr. UPS man!
GERALD
Yeah? [Spanks her] Do you like your package, ma'am? [Unknown to them, Ike is standing at the doorway looking at them]
SHEILA
Oh yes!
GERALD
Huh? [Followed by a series of grunts]
SHEILA
Do it harder, UPS man!
[Ike's room, morning. A traumatized Ike is at his desk crying, and he buries his head on the desk/ Ike has been drawing something. Kyle walks by and notices his brother's sorrows]
KYLE
Ike, what's the matter? [Waits a few seconds, then goes in.] Dude, you've been in here crying all morning. What's going on? [Ike finishes up and hands the sheet of paper to Kyle. Kyle looks and is suddenly alarmed. Ike has drawn a stick figure of his mom with a UPS man, with big boobs for his mom and a big penis for the UPS man. Ike goes back to crying] Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this?
IKE
[Voice cracking] Yes! Yes!
KYLE
I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%-
IKE
I saw them, Kyle, I saw them!
KYLE
Oh no...
[Stan's house, later. Kyle is in Stan's room, and Cartman and Kenny have joined them. Stan is at his desk, Kenny is on Stan's bed, Cartman is standing up]
KYLE
You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do.
STAN
Dude, what happened?
KYLE
Take a look. [Whips out the sheet of paper Ike drew upon]
STAN
What's this? [Takes the sheet and looks at it.]
KYLE
Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.
STAN
Whoa!
CARTMAN
Dude, no way!
KYLE
Yeah dude. [Out in the hall, Randy walks by with a cup of coffee, but he hears them and stops]
STAN
But are you sure they had sex, like, "sex" sex, or they actually had sex? [Randy sees a plant nearby, quickly dumps his coffee into it, and puts the cup against Stan's door]
KYLE
Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time.
RANDY
[Barely audible] Ohhhh... [Hurries away]
STAN
Well are you gonna tell your dad?
KYLE
I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing.
CARTMAN
[Walks up to him] Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual?
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom?
STAN
Cartman dude, not now.
CARTMAN
No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? "Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight." It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!
[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails, night. Aside from Skeeter, seven men are present. Jimbo, Randy, Stuart, and Stephen are at the bar. Mr. Tucker is at a table, while Steve Black and Mr. Testaburger stand]
RANDY
Look, look, the thing is, do we tell Gerald, or do we just stay out of it?
JIMBO
How do you tell him? "Hey Gerald, Sorry, but the UPS man is bangin' your wife." It's really none of our business.
STUART
If my wife was having sex with the UPS man, I'd want you guys to tell me!
STEPHEN
How do you know she's not? I mean, think about it: this is a guy who visits all our houses during the day, who clearly has a kind of... insatiable lust... I mean, somebody who would have sex with Kyle's mom would have sex with just about anything!
RANDY
Oh, come on, he can't be trying that with all our wives?
MECHANIC
Wouldn't be the first time. [The other men face him] Hyeah, there's a price to be paid with having things convenient. Used to be... a man had to go to the store to buy himself a pitcher of milk. Hyeah, but men got lazy. They wanted that milk delivered right to the door. Only problem was, the guy deliverin' that milk end sup fuckin' your wife. Sure, you had your nice cold milk delivered right to your doorstep, but your wife was gettin' pounded out like a mallard duck. [takes his hat and heads for the entrance, then turns around] And now you got your Amazon. [puts on his hat] And the milkman's come back. [turns around] And none of ya are safe. [walks away, leaving the other men stunned]
[Cartman's house, day. A Wolf Security System truck is parked out front. In the living room, a security agent lists some things Liane and Cartman would need on their house to secure it well. Liane looks through the brochure.]
SECURITY AGENT
And so you'd need the motion detectors in the living room and the kitchen, the touch pads at the front and rear doors, and break-in monitors on all windows. I'm afraid those are not secure at all.
CARTMAN
Oh no, really?
LIANE
Oh, I'm sorry, but I really don't think I can afford this.
CARTMAN
Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!
LIANE
Ohhh...
SECURITY AGENT
Yes, unfortunately it's not enough to just be fearful of strangers these days.
CARTMAN
What-what do you mean?
SECURITY AGENT
Well, many times, houses are burglarized by someone the victim knows.
CARTMAN
Oh my God, I knew it! Kyle is always taking my stuff! Just yesterday I couldn't find my iPod headphones! That sneaky little Jew!
SECURITY AGENT
We realize that's a lot of money, Mrs. Cartman, but really, how much is feeling secure in your own home worth?
CARTMAN
Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both!
[The Marsh kitchen, morning. Randy waits at the breakfast table as Sharon washes dishes.]
SHARON
Don't you need to be getting to work, Rand?
RANDY
No, I think I'll uh, ...just hang out a little longer. [The doorbell rings] I'll get it. [Rises quickly and heads for the front door]
UPS MAN
[Holding two boxes] Hey there, looks like I got a couple of packagers from Amazon for ya.
RANDY
[Warily] Oh, is that so?
UPS MAN
If I can just get your signature right [Whips out the signature pad] there?
RANDY
[Signs the pad] Sure um... Chad, is it?
UPS MAN
Thad.
RANDY
Thad. Nice. You um, havin' a busy day?
UPS MAN
Oh you know, just, tryin' to get to everyone.
RANDY
Yeah I'll bet. [Gives him the pad back. Thad does a couple more things on the pad]
UPS MAN
[Gives Randy the packages and walks back to his truck] Well, have a good one.
RANDY
Yeah, you too, Thad. [Closes the door and walks back to the kitchen. He puts the packages down on the counter next to the sink] Hey Sharon, these came for you.
SHARON
[Smiles] Ooooo, stuff from Amazon?
RANDY
Yeah, w-what are they?
SHARON
You know, to be honest, I can't remember?
RANDY
[In a deeper voice] You just... order stuff off of Amazon and you can't remember what?
SHARON
[Opens the larger box] Ohhh yeahyeahyeah, these are the paring knives I ordered. Sorry, I think I was a little tipsy. [puts the knives back in the box and opens the smaller box] oh, and this is the book Stan's been wanting; can you take it up to him?
RANDY
Yeah, sure, 'cause... [backs out of the kitchen] people just order stuff from Amazon and... forget what they got. [goes upstairs]
[Stan's room, moments later. Randy enters the room with Stan's book.]
RANDY
Stan, you got something from Amazon. [looks around and doesn't see Stan] Oh. [goes to Stan's desk and drops the book off there. He notices Ike's drawing and takes it, looks closely at it and gasps, thinking the drawing is of Sharon and the UPS man] Ooohhh shit.
[Cartman's house, afternoon. Cartman comes home from school and sets off the alarm upon entering]
CARTMAN
Oh fuck. [Goes to the touchpad by the door to shut it off] Oh what's the- God damn it! [The phone rings and he goes to answer it. He puts his left index finger in his left ear to hear from the right ear better] Hello?
[Wolf Security Systems, afternoon. It's a very nice office, but only one operator is there taking calls. Whenever the camera is on him, or on one of his colleagues later on, it moves around him to the left or right, never losing focus]
JEFF
This is Jeff with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?
CARTMAN
Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!
JEFF
That's okay. Do you have your security pass phrase you can tell me?
CARTMAN
Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew. [Thinks a moment] No wait, Kyle is a no-good lying Jew.
JEFF
Okay, I've got something a little different here.
CARTMAN
Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere.
JEFF
No problem.
CARTMAN
Sorry about this.
JEFF
It's all right, it happens all the time.
CARTMAN
'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean "That's all right"! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!
JEFF
You want to rape your mom?
CARTMAN
[Liane appears at the top of the stairs and becomes coming down, but stops to hear what Eric is saying] That's nice, you're so cool about me triggering the alarm and not knowing the password, but how do you know I'm not making it up?! I could have raped my mom twice by now!
JEFF
You said you lived there.
CARTMAN
[His mom goes back up the stairs] I do, but you don't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit!
[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails, night. The mechanic is back at his table. The shadows of a group of men creep up on him]
RANDY
How did you get rid of him? [The mechanic looks at him] How did you get rid of the milkman?
MECHANIC
There's no getting rid of him. Not in any you folks would be prepared for. Noh, best you just let him go on fucking your wives. Maybe he'll get tired of it.
STEPHEN
Damn you, it's not just our wives anymore! [The others look at him, he looks around] This morning, he came for me. I opened the door. It was the UPS man. He had a box from Amazon. I looked inside and found an adapter for an iPhone and then I remembered: I had ordered it! I ordered it the day before and I had barely any recollection. The UPS man is using his powers to try to have sex with me now.
RANDY
[Puts his hands on the table] You said we wouldn't be prepared to get rid of him. How did you?
MECHANIC
We used a pretty blonde to lure him in. When she answered the door she told the milkman to follow her to the bathrub. She took off her clothes and... asked the milkman to fill the tub with milk. The milkman said, "You want that milk pasteurize?" And the blonde replied, "No, just up to my boobs. I can splash it in my eyes." That's when we jumped 'im. It was over in minutes. Then we burned his body. You wanna get rid of the milkman? You gotta kill him and kill him good. And then you gotta go to the store for your stuff from then on.
[Cartman's house, next day. A cat burglar with cigarette is at Cartman's front door]
CAT BURGLAR
Hey, ey uh, [Takes a puff of cigarette] you want me to do this, you gotta pay up front, kid!
CARTMAN
You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it? [closes and locks the door, then arms the system, then goes to the phone to wait for Wolf Home Security to call. The cat burglar pounds a window until it gives way and he goes in. The alarm goes off a second later. Cartman gets pissed off when the burglar breaks a second window and there's no response from Wolf. Finally the call comes in, and Cartman answers it] Hello?
MICHAEL
This is Michael with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?
CARTMAN
[The cat burglar appears as he goes towards the stairs. He then stops] Uh, no, a man just broke into our house and he's about to rape my mom. [Softly, to the cat burglar while muffling the mic] Go go, she's upstairs. [The cat burglar heads up the stairs] Hello, did you hear me? A rapist is here; he's white!
MICHAEL
Oh-kay, should we contact the police?
CARTMAN
Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped!
MICHAEL
Okay, we're contacting them now.
CARTMAN
He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry!
MICHAEL
Try and stay calm, the police are on their way.
CARTMAN
Well that's nice, maybe they could bring some cigarettes and Gatorade, 'cause the guy's gonna be pretty wiped out! [Looks at the phone] The fuck?!
[The Stotch house. Stephen goes to the front door and opens it.]
UPS MAN
Hey there, misterrr Stotch. looks like another Amazon package. [Smiles]
STEPHEN
I know that what I feel for you is just some kind of spell.
UPS MAN
[looks puzzled] ...Sss-sorry?
STEPHEN
Just let me sign. [the UPS man hands him the signature pad, Stephen signs it and gives it back and gets his package, and the UPS man leaves. Stephen opens the box and pulls out a Bane mask, still in the plastic package. Then he whips out a flip phone from his back pocket and talks into it] All right, he's coming to you.
[The UPS truck, day. The UPS man gets into his truck and starts it up. A gun appears next to his face, ready to shoot at him. He's startled]
VOICE
Well hello there, Mr. UPS man!
UPS MAN
What are you-?
RANDY
[wearing his own Bane mask] You should have left our wives alone. Now let's go for a drive.
UPS MAN
[the UPS man releases the hand brake and drives off] Look, you can have whatever's in the back! Ih-ihit's all stuff from Amazon!
RANDY
Oh no, pull in here.
[A U-Stor-It storage facility, day. The UPS man drives into it]
UPS MAN
Just let me go, huh?
RANDY
Oh, and then we'd miss out on all the fun! [the driver's side door opens and the other men from the bar, also wearing Bane masks, drag the UPS man out]
UPS MAN
Aaawwgh! [they take turns kicking and punching him]
STEPHEN
You should have never come to our town! [punches him twice, the second one sending him to Stuart]
STUART
A man's wife is his life, Mr. UPS man. [punches him three times, the third one sending him back to Stephen. The UPS man falls to the ground and the Banes start kicking him. A woman is heard screaming. She and her husband are shown]
WOMAN
Oh my God.
MAN
Come on honey! [they run off]
RANDY
[whips out Ike's drawing and puts it in the man's face] Thought we wouldn't find out??? [drops it and the men scatter. Skeeter and Stephen go towards the camera and away, screen left. Stuart. Randy, and Mr. Testaburger run away from the camera, and Jimbo, Thomas, and Steve Black run off screen right. The UPS man is left alone, battered, bruised, and coughing up blood]
[Cartman's house, day. Someone knocks on his door five times, then tries to jiggle the locks open.]
CARTMAN
[stops] Who is there?
UPS MAN
[opens the door and stumbles in] Please! [still gasping for air]
CARTMAN
Oh?! Ohhh?! [backs away quickly. The phone rings, but Cartman goes to the kitchen to answer it] Yes? Yeah, hello?
VARASHNU
[with Indian Accent] Hello, this is Varashnu wit Wolf Home Security.
CARTMAN
A man just broke into my house and is- [looks at the phone] Varashnu? I didn't sign up to have some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?!
VARASHNU
...Uh yes, I am in United States.
CARTMAN
Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on!
VARASHNU
Okay, hold on. [transfers Cartman's call]
CARTMAN
Heh- hello?
KEVIN
This is Kevin with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?
CARTMAN
No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?!
KEVIN
We have alarms going off across the country fourteen times a minute. That takes a lot of employees manning phones.
CARTMAN
Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me!
KEVIN
Sir, it doesn't matter where we call you from, we still contact the police in your neighborhood.
CARTMAN
Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?!
KEVIN
I d-I d'uh... Wow, that just fucked my head.
CARTMAN
Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom! [slams the phone on the floor]
[Park County Police Station, day. A crowd has gathered in front of the station. Sgt. Yates addresses the crowd's concerns.]
SGT. YATES
All right, quiet down people, please! Quiet! [the crowd quiets down] I know you're all worried about your families' security. All I can tell you is that so far, Bane has not been caught. [the people begin to murmur amongst themselves]
MR. MACKEY
Uh, what are we supposed to do? I mean if Bane is out there on the loose then none of us are safe. One Bane's bad enough, but apparently we got like, like seven Banes? Uhkay?
GERALD
And what do we tell our kids?! We can't leave them in the dark!
RANDY
[aside to Gerald] Wouldn't be the only ones in your family completely in the dark.
GERALD
What?
RANDY
Huh? Nothing.
SGT. YATES
Now listen! There's nothing more we can do to protect your homes. But there's someone here who says he can. [makes way for the security agent who visited Cartman and his mom earlier]
SECURITY AGENT
Hello folks, we're more than happy to get your homes safe and secure. Now, you're gonna be wanting monitors on all your doors and windows, motion detectors in the living areas, and I would also recommend you all get our newest personal security system to make sure your wives are safe outside the home.
RANDY
Whoawhoa, wait, wait. What do you mean?
SPOKESMAN
[in a commercial] Protecting your home and your family is hard enough! But sometimes alarms on your doors and windows aren't enough! A new security system allows not only for your doors and windows to be monitored, but your fear levels as well. [a 3-D schematic of a house is shown, with a person in it] A security system that is actually inside you. It's called IN-security.
HUSBAND
[with wife and twin daughters] We'll never forget the day we took our twin daughters to the beach.
STRANGER
Hehey, what cute twins.
WIFE
Thanks.
STRANGER
They're so adorable [whips out a crowbar and assumes a menacing posture. The wife instinctively tries to protect the girls] that I'm gonna bash their fucking heads in! [the alarm goes off and the stranger runs away, dropping the crowbar. The husband receives the call]
PETER
This is Peter with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
HUSBAND
A white man just tried to murder our twin girls.
PETER
I have a police car on their way with blankets and cocoa. [Next shot is of the whole family in blankets and sipping cocoa at the beach, with police cars around them and police officers investigating]
HUSBAND
I only hope other have people have INsecurity to protect their families.
[A shoe store. A woman is getting her son new shoes]
SHOE SALESMAN
Well, how's the shoe fit, pal?
BOY
I think it fits pretty good.
SHOE SALESMAN
Well okayhehe, let's see if it fits better than this KNIFE THROUGH YOUR FUCKING SKULL, BASTARD! [gets out a large knife and slashes the air with it.]
BOY
Aaahh! [jumps into his mom's arms and the alarm goes off. The salesman drops the knife and runs off. The phone rings and the mom answers it]
MOM
Hello?
DAVID
This is David with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
MOM
[voice breaking] No, a white shoe salesman tried to murder my son.
DAVID
Hold tight. Police are on their way with blankets and cocoa. [next scene, mom and son are in blankets and sipping cocoa while the police investigate]
SPOKESMAN
Don't let your family become another statistic. Have piece of mind with... [the new company logo appears, with "Custom installation for only $99."] INsecurity.
[South Park Elementary, hallway, day. Kyle and Stan walk along to class]
KYLE
It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.
STAN
You're gonna have to tell him, dude.
KYLE
I know...
CARTMAN
[runs up to them] HaHA Kyle! Let's see you try and take my iPod headphones HOW! [wears a little sign on his head showing that ]
KYLE
What?!
CARTMAN
Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody's stuff, you should look elsewhere.
KYLE
Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!
CARTMAN
Oh, fat bitch, huh?! [gets smug] Well it just so happens that this fat bitch has INsecurity now, Kyle, and so I'm protected from ALL you greedy little Jews until you and your people DIE OUT!
KYLE
The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!
CARTMAN
What? [his alarm goes off, then he gets the call] Hello?
MARCUS
This is Marcus with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
CARTMAN
Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set off my INsecurity.
MARCUS
All right, could I just get your password please?
CARTMAN
Yeah, it's um... it's uloveboobs.
MARCUS
I love boobs?
CARTMAN
No, "uloveboobs." Lower-case u love boobs.
MARCUS
How did you know that?
CARTMAN
My password is uloveboobs!
MARCUS
Oh oh I get it. That's pretty funny.
CARTMAN
You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!
MARCUS
Sure, here you go. [gets to resetting the system]
CARTMAN
Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-! [notices Kyle is gone, but looks around] Kyle? God damn it.
[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails, day. The men are back in the bar]
RANDY
And then I had to drive to Walgreens, Barnes & Noble AND Ace Hardware. I tell you, having to go around and buy stuff again sucks.
STUART
Yeah, but at least we never have to deal with that UPS driver again.
JIMBO
[bursts through the front doors] He's back!
STEPHEN
What?!
JIMBO
[runs to the bar] I just came from Will Patterson's house! His mother got three packages from Amazon! And the UPS guy told her what he'd like to do to her!
STEPHEN
How?
JIMBO
He casually dropped this on his way out! [whips out a sheet of paper, and the other men gather to have a look. It's Ike's drawing]
RANDY
[low voice] Oh my God! [now he and the men think the UPS man has made copies of that drawing and is dropping them off at every house]
MECHANIC
Didn't kill 'im, did ya? [the other men turn around] Yea', I didn't think you had it in ya.
RANDY
We scared him! We thought that'd be enough!
MECHANIC
Milkman don't get scared. Not with free pussy at every doorstep.
[A stakeout. Someone is looking at the UPS man deliver a package through binoculars. A woman answers the door, takes her package from the UPS man, and closes the door. The UPS man looks around to make sure no one is out to hurt him any further. He goes to his truck, then checks under it to make sure it hasn't been rigged with a bomb, then he looks around once more]
STEPHEN
Son of a bitch, it's him all right!
RANDY
This guy doesn't know when to quit!
STEPHEN
He's stopping at another house. [the UPS man stops his truck, gets down with a new package, and goes to the next house, looking around]
STEVE BLACK
Guess this guy's a lot tougher than we thought. Must be why our wives want him so bad.
RANDY
[his INsecurity goes off] Sorry sorry, that's me. [gets the call] Hello?
ALVIN
This is Alvin with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
RANDY
Yeah, sorry, false alarm. Pass phrase is tickle me homo. [the other men glance at him] It's a joke.
[Kyle's house, day, living room. Kyle sits on the sofa between his parents]
KYLE
Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet.
SHEILA
That's right, Kyle.
KYLE
And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself. [the doorbell rings and he sighs deeply, then goes to answer it. The UPS man is on the other side of the door]
UPS MAN
Uhh, hi, I got a delivery for ya?
KYLE
Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you?
UPS MAN
What?
KYLE
Please? I need you to come sit down for a second. [puzzled, the UPS man comes in and sits down on the armchair. Kyle returns to his spot between his parents, and silence follows for a couple of seconds] So... Here we all are. Mom, do you want to tell Dad something? [she stays quiet] Mom?
UPS MAN
What's going on?
KYLE
You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!
UPS MAN
Don't you think I want to?! [his UPS truck is shown in the background] I hate this damned town! Every day, things just keep getting weirder around here, and I'm just about sick of it![Randy and Stephen run out from behind the truck, and a few seconds later it blows up] Aaah! [runs to a window] Oh my God! [gets the call and answers it] Hello?
BRIAN
This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right?
UPS MAN
No! They blew up my car! They blew up my car!
BRIAN
I'm sending help. Police are on their way with blankets and cocoa.
UPS MAN
[goes up the stairs] They're after me again! Do something!
BRIAN
Ho- hold on one second, sir, I have another emergency coming in. [switches calls] This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right?
CARTMAN
[in the perfume section of a store, with a saleswoman behind the counter] Yeah, no, false alarm again. I'm in the store and some fat bitch asked me if my dad likes cologne.
GERALD
[opens the front door] What the hell's goin' on out here?! [Stephen and Jimbo lie in wait for the UPS man]
JIMBO
Stay out of this, Gerald! Some men care about what their wives are doing!
GERALD
What?! You don't even have a wife, Jimbo! [Jimbo's INsecurity goes off, his phone rings, and he answers it]
UPS MAN
[trying again to call INsecurity] Somebody answer me! You have to send help now!
MARTIN
Sir, we are sending help. Just stay calm. [another call comes in] Hang on sir, this is Martin with INsecurity.
RANDY
[on the phone] Yeah, I'm thinking maybe Gerald's house is nicer than mine is.
MARTIN
Hello, this is Martin with INsecu-
CARTMAN
[outside a store] God damn it I've had it with you people! When I signed up, I thought I was getting CSI guys protecting my ass, but all of you answering the phones are complete retards![Martin is swamped with calls. Another one comes in] Hello? [his own INsecurity has gone off]
MIKE
This is Mike with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
UPS MAN
[in the master bedroom] Hello?!
KYLE
[sees the open door and goes in] Dude, come down here!
UPS MAN
[panics] AAAAH! [jumps through the closed window to his death] Uf. [everyone else looks. Police arrive shortly with blankets and cocoa.]
SGT. YATES
So you say this man killed himself because he was a psychopath who was forced to have sex with his mother? [holds a sheet of paper in his hand]
STEPHEN
Yes, we found that in his pocket. [points to the sheet, which the captain holds up. It's... Ike's drawing again]
OFFICER
Sir, we found this in the closet upstairs? [It's the UPS uniform Gerald uses in roleplaying]
GERALD
Yes, that's mine.
RANDY
Yours? What?
SHEILA
[rips the uniform from the officer] Give me that! What we do in our bedroom is our business!
KYLE
Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?
GERALD
Uhh, Kyle, uh sometimes when people get older they need to play and pretend to keep things interesting. Iiit's just a way I can still be intimate with your mother without relying on silly sexual enhancement drugs. [all the other men's alarms go off, their phones ring, and they all answer them]
THE MEN
Hello?
[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails, night. The men return to the bar and find the mechanic at his table again]
RANDY
It's over. But you were wrong. We don't have to be afraid of Amazon. The only price to be paid for convenience is that we must be secure with ourselves.
MECHANIC
Yea'. Got yourselves some nice home security systems, don'tcha? Payin' a man to do your job of protecting your house. Only problem is, while you're out feelin' like your things are safe, that security man is fucking your wife.
[Address 10228, day. The security agent is at the house talking to a woman]
SECURITY AGENT
Doors and windows should be armed and your motion detectors are up and running, just call me whenever you need me back. [the woman closes her door and the agent goes back to his van. He gets in and sits down, preparing to drive. A gun pops up next to him, and he's alarmed.] Ah! Who are you??
CARTMAN
[in Bane mask] It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan. You should have respected my authoritay. [the men return in Bane masks to haul the agent out and beat him up]
SECURITY AGENT
Hoo!
End of Insecurity

synopsis:It is time for Butters to begin a journey where he will follow in the path of his Hawaiian ancestors.

script:Going Native

[South Park Elementary School Cafeteria, day. The kids are seated for lunch. At the center table are Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Tolkien, Clyde and Craig. Cartman runs in from the hallway]
CARTMAN
FELLAS! Fellas!
STAN
What?
CARTMAN
You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!
KYLE
Butters? [he and Stan look puzzled] Why?
CARTMAN
It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him!
STAN
You're talking about Butters.
CARTMAN
Dude, I'm telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he locked himself in the bathroom! [the other boys get concerned and leave their tables to go to the restroom]
[The restroom around the corner from the cafeteria. Jimmy has joined the boys. Stan bangs on the door]
STAN
Butters?
BUTTERS
Leave me alone!
STAN
Butters, come out here.
BUTTERS
Get out of here, all of ya! [Stan turns to the other boys and shrugs]
KYLE
Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-
BUTTERS
[runs out of the restroom up to Kyle and points at him] You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle?! Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! Well you don't know everything because [walks to Stan and points him out] your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image! [runs back inside the boys room, then turns around and runs to Cartman] You guys think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You're all fake and stuck up [moves over to Jimmy], and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his jokes aren't funny! [moves over to Kenny] The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts! [runs back into the restroom and locks himself in. The other boys are stunned and silent]
CARTMAN
Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny? [Kenny flashes an angry look]
BUTTERS
[runs out of the restroom again and storms up to Cartman] AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING! You're always trivializing everything I say by gettin' the last word! [Cartman looks stunned]Well you're not gettin' the last word this time! [runs back into the boys restroom and locks himself in]
CARTMAN
...Wow.
BUTTERS
[opens the door and peeks out] Double wow! [slams the door and locks it]
[The principal's office, Day. Principal Victoria is talking to Butters and his parents.]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I'm sorry, but your son is distracting the other students and his attitude is just getting worse.
STEPHEN
Butters, what on earth has gotten into you?!
BUTTERS
[In a gruff voice] I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess!
LINDA
Do you think this behavior is fair to your teacher and classmates?!
BUTTERS
I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn!
STEPHEN
Do you have any idea how grounded you are about to be, mister?!
BUTTERS
Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud! [both parents look taken aback as a moment of silence follows]
LINDA
[looks at Stephen] Stephen, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
STEPHEN
Yes. Our little Butters is flowering. He has reached the age of panua.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Eh-excuse me?
STEPHEN
Principal Victoria, this isn't Butters' fault.
BUTTERS
It's not?!
STEPHEN
It has to do with... biology. [turns right and walks off a bit] You've... maybe noticed that Butters isn't... exactly like other kids.
BUTTERS
Yeah?
STEPHEN
You probably think Butters seems somehow... different.
BUTTERS
[normal voice] Hey yeah, all the time.
STEPHEN
It's because he is. [turns around and faces Principal Victoria] His mother and I... his whole family were... we're not of this place.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Ah I'm sorry, I really don't understand.
STEPHEN
Please, just try to understand that for our people it's a very private matter. He can't be helped by your discipline; this must be dealt with by his own kind. If it's all right with you, we'd like an extended leave for our boy. Please. It's a cultural thing.
[The Stotch house, day. Stephen and Linda argue as Butters sits on the couch]
LINDA
I don't want him to go, Stephen, he's too young!
STEPHEN
It's our people's way, Linda, you know that better than I do!
LINDA
Then we can go with him.
STEPHEN
You know that's not allowed!
BUTTERS
Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?!
STEPHEN
Butters, you've reached the age where you must journey to your birthplace for the ceremony of hapa noa.
BUTTERS
Uhbu-but I'm from here.
STEPHEN
No. We moved here just before you started pre-school. You were born in our native land, Butters. [walks to a bookshelf and grabs a scrapbook] A distant and very secluded island world called... Hava'i.
BUTTERS
We're from Hawaii?
STEPHEN
[sits on the sofa next to Butters. Linda sits to his left] Only haoles pronounce it Hawaii, Butters, but those of us from Hava'i are a very special people. We have many customs and traditions to keep our culture alive. [opens the book and points some pictures out to him] We drink chi-chi's from the coconut. We eat poke that the Safeway provides. And when we've chosen a mate, we marry at the fern grotto, as your mother and I did so... very long ago. As a Stotch, Butters, you are actually Hawaiian royalty. Your grandma and grandpa were there at the time of the King. [flips backwards a few pages and shows him a picture of Elvis Presley playing a ukulele with a picture of Diamondhead in the background.]
BUTTERS
But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?
STEPHEN
Not an emo chick on her period, Butters. Like a salmon needing to swim back upriver. All Hawaiians feel it. It is called "hapahui apahoha", and it means it's now your time to make your trip to our island home. You must do your walkabout to your homeland, Butters. And you must do it alone. [Linda stands up and starts crying. Stephen stands up and takes out his wallet] Take this, son. It is our Mahalo Rewards card. It will provide you with all you need. And now I must turn my back on you. [he turns his back to Butters. Linda weeps silently. Butters is speechless]
[The neighborhood park, day. The boys from the table are playing basketball, and Jimmy joins in. Kenny tosses the basketball at Kyle, who makes a shot, and Cartman runs up to them from the sidewalk. Stan catches the ball]
CARTMAN
Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls. [the other boys gather around him]
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii.
STAN
Hawaii?
CARTMAN
He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.
KYLE
Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him.
STAN
[turns to the basket] After all the things he said to us, he can go ahead. [makes a shot at close range]
KYLE
Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him.
KENNY
(I'm not his best friend.)
CARTMAN
Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more. [Kenny sighs and walks away with his head down.]
[The airport, day. Kenny arrives and walks into the Alpha Air terminal. He sees Butters seated on a seat in an empty row, with two suitcases at his feet. He's sobbing. Kenny looks somehwat worried and walks over]
KENNY
(Butters, come on.)
BUTTERS
They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right! [Kenny takes one suitcase and Butters' right hand, Butters takes the other suitcase, and Kenny attempts to lead Butters out. Suddenly Butters stops and yanks his hand away] No, no! I have to go to Hawaii, Kenny! I have no idea what's waiting there for me, but I guh, I can't go on like this! [Kenny sighs, then takes Butters to the teller]
KENNY
(Excuse me, he needs to go to Hawaii.)
TELLER
I already told him, I can't allow anyone on the aircraft who appears to be intoxicated.
BUTTERS
I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just "deligerent" because of my hapanuanalua!
KENNY
(Please, could you just let him on the plane? It's really important. Please?)
TELLER
Tell you what: there's plenty of points on his Mahalo Rewards card. If you wanna fly with him, I can let him go.
KENNY
(Me?)
BUTTERS
Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!
KENNY
[puts his hand over Butters mouth to shut him up] (Okay, okay! I'll go.) [scene cuts to the plane flying towards Hawaii]
[Lihu'e Airport, Kaua'i, Runway B-5. The plane lands and Butters and Kenny enter the terminal. Butters has picked up his bags]
BUTTERS
[slowly, as he looks around] Well, we're here. Now what do I do? [Kenny points to the information officer nearby, and they walk to him]
OFFICER
Can I help you with anything?
BUTTERS
Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go?
OFFICER
Okay, were you with a cruise ship or land tour group?
BUTTERS
Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian. [the officer just looks at him. A group of Americans approaches him]
BLOND MAN
Butters Stotch?
BUTTERS
Yeah?
BLOND MAN
Welcome home, young keiki. Your parents said you would be coming for your ceremony. [notices Kenny] Ah- uh, who's this?
BUTTERS
Oh thi-this is my friend, Kenny.
OLDER WOMAN
Butters, native Hawaiians don't really approve of haoles coming to their ceremonies.
BUTTERS
Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come.
BLOND MAN
Very well, we shall speak with the chief of our island and see. Come now. [everyone leaves]
[En route to the chief, day. They go down the road, all packed into an SUV.]
BUTTERS
You folks are all native Hawaiians too?
OLDER MAN
[driving] Yes. My wife Patty and I have been coming to Kaua'i for almost five years, and Bill and Donna actually own a time share in Poipu.
DONNA
Yes, but Poipu is getting pretty overrun with tourists, I'm afraid.
BLOND MAN
[leans to the right, behind the older man] Let us eat.
OLDER MAN
Oh yea, let us eat. [they stop at Kuwahara Saimin's drive-through] Aloha, five order of saimin, please.
BUTTERS
What's "saimin"?
PATTY
It's one of the foods of our people.
OLDER MAN
Oh, I get 20% off, I'm a native. Here's my Mahalo Rewards card. [the cashier notes the card and takes the cash, the older man takes the food, and they're off.] Mahalo. [they soon find themselves behind a slow car with the passenger taking pictures of the scenery. The older man honks.] Come on, you frickin' tourist! Jesus, buy a post card! [stops and points out a building] These are the ancient ruins of our ancestors. [it's the Coco Palms, long abandoned.] They say the spirit of the king is still in there.
BLOND MAN
You must stay away from this place. It is kapu.
BRUNET MAN
Kapu. that means "taboo", [points to Kenny] especially to haoles! [they drive off]
OLDER MAN
Uh that there is Bubba's Burgers. [scene shows Bubba's Burgers] In Havai'i us natives say "Bubba's Bruk". [they pass by a big hotel] Here's the Sheraton, just another megahotel for the throngs of tourists. Here's where many of us natives live. The Sheraton Residences. [a gated community is shown. The Older Man flashes his Mahalo Rewards card to the guard] It's all right, we're natives. [the guard opens the gate and lets them in. They arrive at the chief's residence and step out to talk to him] Protector and Chief, I present to you the keiki, Butters Stotch.
CHIEF
Ah, Stephen and Linda's child. Last time I saw you, you were the size of a coconut. Who's the haole?
[Kenny's room at the Residences, night. He sits by the open window with a lit candle, a pencil and a sheet of paper. He begins to write.]
KENNY
My dearest friends,:I am living amongst the natives in the remote and tiny island of Kava'i. What can I tell you of this mysterious island and its people? It is a place of wonder, and yet to the outsider like me, a place of odd tradition. The people here are peaceful and joyous, and seem to care little for the rush and worry of the outside world. Their diet is mostly an odd mixture of coconut milk, pineapple juice, and vodka, which they call the chi-chi. As for Butters, he is quickly learning the ways of his ancestors, and seems to be feeling better with every passing day. He still seems quite angry at times, but luckily his ceremony will finally take place on the morrow.
[As he writes, the following scenes are shown: First, the Safeway supermarket. The people greet each other with a fist, with pinky and thumb extended. Next, three kids are playing in a pool while Donna enjoys her chi-chi and the older couple sit on chaise longues in the background. Next, Kenny is at the bar order a chi-chi. Next, Butters learns how to play bocce ball. Next, Stan reads the letter to Cartman and Kyle]
STAN
[reading the letter] "On the morrow"? What the fuck is wrong with Kenny?
KENNY
To wit, I have found nothing wrong with this remote place, and I must admit it will be with some melancholy that I will leave this island and return home. ...I saw this chick in a bikini on the beach too. She had the nicest boobs ever.
Humbly yours, Kenneth.
[A luau, day. All the natives are in line for lunch before the ceremony begins. Butters stands on a platform before the chief while Kenny watches on]
CHIEF
In the time-honored traditions of our ancestors, we honor the native Hawaiian Butters Stotch with his hapa noa. [everyone cheers and and woman slips a necklace onto his neck] The shark-tooth necklace represents your connection to our island. [a horn blower comes in with a conch shell and blows into it... badly] Now drink the chi-chi! [Patty walks over with a glass of it and gives it to Butters, who begins to drink it through a straw.]
BUTTERS
[turns right and coughs, then] Whoa, it's like gasoline!
CHIEF
Drink, young keiki, and you will feel the last of your aggression melt away.
BUTTERS
[finishes the rest of the drink, then stumbles just a little bit and smiles] Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better.
CHIEF
O spirits of ancestors, we ask that you bless this native Hawaiian with his hapa noa! We ask that you-
BLOND MAN
[runs in] Listen! [climbs onto a table] Listen everyone! I have terrible, horrible news!
CHIEF
Do you realize that you are interrupting a hapa noa?
BLOND MAN
I've just come from the front office! The Mahalo Rewards card is... [chokes]
CHIEF
What?! What has happened? Speak!
BLOND MAN
The Mahalo Rewards card is being eliminated! They're trying to say our points are... are... no longer going to be accepted.
CHIEF
[rises from his chair and walks to his left] I knew one day it would come to this.
PATTY
To what? What does this mean?
CHIEF
The haoles are trying to do away with us.
RESIDENT 1
With no rewards program, there will be no distinction between who's a native to this island and who isn't!
RESIDENT 2
Why can't you people respect our island? Why do you always want nore?!
CHIEF
I'm sorry keiki, your hapa noa will have to wait! For we must unite together as never before! It is time to show the haoles that this is our island! [this draws cheers from everyone]
[A seaside golf course, day. A cruise ship is some distance from the shore when it blows its horn. A group of natives stand by their golf balls]
CHIEF
[yelling at the ship] Stop ruining our island, haoles! FIRE! [the natives fire away into the ocean. Some of the golf balls land in the water, some of them reach the ship]
FIRST MATE
What are they doing? [the passengers are being pelted with golf balls.]
CHIEF
[walks over to Butters and gives him a club] Take a swing! Let them know they are not welcome!
BUTTERS
I've never done this before. [gets into position]
CHIEF
It's all right. Just try to tap into that anger that's inside you.
BUTTERS
Aim... my anger! Stupid [swings successfully] Ben Affleck! [the golf ball sails through the air and enters the bridge, smashing through the window and the captain's binoculars. The first mate shrieks] Waaah! [the captain stumbles onto a controller and breaks it with sheer momentum. The ship begins to pitch back and sink. Passengers begin to tumble towards the water. Butters is dumbfounded. The ship breaks in two]
MAN
Hold on! [the golf club just falls out of Butters' left hand] Hold on!
WOMAN
Oh I can't! I can't! I can't hold on!
MAN
I love you! I love you!
WOMAN
No! I love you! I love you back! [the ship vanishes below the water]
[Breaking News]
ANNOUNCER
This is breaking news!
ANCHOR
An insurrection in the Hawaiian Islands has escalated to war! After sinking a cruise ship, the natives of Kauai continue to go berserk, forcing all tourists off their island.
MAN 1
They just pushed us onto airplanes and said we weren't welcome anymore!
WOMAN 1
Then a little boy called me a skank.
ANCHOR
[a picture of Barack Obama appears over his shoulder] The President says he will send the Coast Guard to take the island back, though he sympathizes, being a native Hawaiian himself. [thinks about it for a second] Hm.
[The ceremonial plaza, day.]
CHIEF
Are all the tourists gone from our island?
RESIDENT 3
All but a few who are hiding out at Duke's Restaurant. We sent Bob and Trisha Turner to smoke them out.
RESIDENT 4
What about him?
KENNY
(What about me?)
RESIDENT 4
He's a tourist and he knows everything! We have to kill him!
BUTTERS
[jumps in front of Kenny to shield him] No! Kenny's my friend! He's the only kid at school I actually like, you buncha jerks!
CHIEF
Be careful young keiki, your anger still controls you because we were not able to finish the ceremony. Perhaps we should finish it now.
RESIDENT 4
Finish his ceremony?! We are at war, David! I have lived on this island for ten years. Ten years! Every July and part of August! And I can tell you all that what we are about to face from the haoles is nothing short of genocide!
RESIDENT 5
He's right, David. We can't trust any tourists.
BUTTERS
He won't betray us! Will you, Kenny?!
KENNY
(No, I'm not going to fucking betray anybody!)
RESIDENT 6
Then let him prove himself! Trial by opahika'a!
CHIEF DAVID
He's only a child!
RESIDENT 4
If he wants to be one of us, then he must face the challenge!
CHIEF DAVID
Very well. [the horn blower, Resident 5, returns to blow the conch shell]
[On the bank of a river flowing by the Residences, day. David and Butters are there with the rest of the residents in the background, and Kenny is...]
BLOND MAN
This isn't right! He's not a native! He's gonna get killed!
BUTTERS
Kenny, be careful!
CHIEF DAVID
Quiet. He must face this challenge alone. [Kenny is on a surfboard on the river using a small paddle to get somewhere]
RESIDENT 1
By the gods! Perhaps he has the heart of a native after all!
RESIDENT 4
He still has yet to make the turn! [Kenny reaches a buoy in the middle of the river and paddles around it, then makes his way back to the riverbank.]
RESIDENTS
Hohhh!
RESIDENT 7
[a little tipsy from his drink] That's pretty good. [Kenny slows down, then loses his balance and falls into the river]
KENNY
(Whoops!)
BUTTERS
Kenny!
RESIDENTS
Awwwww. [a second later they all turn away and leave. Butters stays at the riverbank.]
RESIDENT 4
[to another Resident] I told you a haole couldn't do it!
CHIEF DAVID
Did you make the turn your first try? Did any of us? [Kenny pops up behind them and floats down the river]
RESIDENT 8
[a woman, walks up to Butters] Don't worry, Butters, your friend will find a way back to his kind. The gods will protect him. [she extends her left hand and guides him away]
[Kenny looks downriver and sees a waterfall. He panics and quickly dog paddles away from it, but the current overwhelms him and he goes over. He bumps into several rocks, each bigger than the last, on his way down, head first]
[Smith's Tropical Paradise, day. David has assembled the residents into this building and now talks to them]
CHIEF DAVID
We have called for this great meeting because if we are to survive this war, all the native Hawaiian tribes must join as one!
RESIDENT 9
We're not joining the people of the Hyatt Grand Vacations! They have no rights to call themselves natives!
VACATIONER 1
Oh and you do?! Your ancestors came on an airplane six months ago! Our ancestors sailed here! On a cruise ship! Nine months ago!
CHIEF DAVID
Look, if we are to fight the haoles, we have to allow all natives to stay!
CANYONER
It doesn't matter how many tribes we have, we can't win! We are but a few against the haole's military might! We may have passion, but passion does not win wars!
CHIEF DAVID
Oh no? Come up here, keiki. Come on. [Butters gets on stage with David] This child sunk a cruise ship by himself! Tell them keiki. [hands the mic to Butters]
BUTTERS
Well I don't know about the rest of ya, but I'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony, and I can't even have it, 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything!
RESIDENT 9
Yeah!
VACATIONER 1
Screw them!
BUTTERS
Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh!
CHIEF DAVID
Let us make a pact with more chi-chis!
RESIDENT 10
[goes to serve himself some more chi-chi from the barrels, but finds there isn't any] Um, we're... we're out of chi-chis.
RESIDENT 11
Oh, right, we've closed off all the ports.
RESIDENT 12
But they're still letting vodka through, right? Uh... they can't cut off our chi-chis.
CHIEF DAVID
...Oh my God.
[Downriver, day. Kenny crawls onto the riverbank, coughs, and looks up. He's across the road from Coco Palms. He stands up and walks towards it. He looks around and heads in, but first waits for a bunch of bats to fly out of the cavernous entrance. Meanwhile, offshore, the U.S. Coast Guard shows up in force to deal with the natives]
CAPTAIN
This is the U.S. Coast Guard! We have instructions to take you by force, if necessary!
CHIEF DAVID
[heading up a large group of natives] Ready? Fire! [the natives fire off their golf balls, but none of them have any effect on the Coast Guard]
CAPTAIN
[lowers his binoculars, then flatly] Fire. [the ships' guns fire away and decimate many of the natives]
CHIEF DAVID
Arm the bocce balls! [surviving natives arm bocce balls into slingshots stretched between palm trees. One of them lands on the main ship with a heavy thud]
CAPTAIN
God damn it.
CHIEF DAVID
Keep fighting! Stand your ground!
RESIDENT 4
We can't fight without chi-chis!
CHIEF DAVID
You can and you MUST!
BUTTERS
[he has six golf balls in front of him and he hits each one towards the Coast Guard] Stupid! Greedy! Haoles! Kill! Them! All!
[Kenny walks through the Coco Palms, which is dark and spooky. A voice is soon heard, and Kenny stops in his tracks. He turns and runs away, but steps onto a patch covering a hole on the floor and falls in. He recovers and looks up to see the shining ghost of Elvis Presley. He beckons Kenny to follow him, mumbling just like Kenny does.]
THE KING
Come on, come on. [mumbles a few more things as they walk towards a door. Elvis stops and pulls a lever, and a wall rises to reveal loads of absolute vodka, pineapple juice, coconut milk, and macadamia nut liqueur, all the ingredients needed for chi-chis. Elvis walks up to the doorway and motions to Kenny] You know what chi-chis are, right?
[The Residences, day, on the ceremonial plaza, Chief David admits defeat]
CHIEF DAVID
Listen everyone, we gave it all we had. It's over. We must go down to Nowiliwili Harbor, and surrender to the American government.
BUTTERS
[runs onto the plaza] Surrender?! No, the heck with that!
RESIDENT 4
We can't hold out here any longer!
BUTTERS
Well I won't do it, you hear me?! I'm not licking anybody's... testes!
CHIEF DAVID
Young keiki, try to control your anger.
BUTTERS
No! This is our home! And I'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You shouldn't be able to be good-looking and be with Jennifer Lopez and be a good director! [turns around and walks away] All right all right fine! Argo is a good movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn't hold up, but it holds up god darn it! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH!
RESIDENT 13
Everyone! Look, I say! [everyone comes to see, and it's Kenny coming back with a raft full of absolute vodka, pineapple juice, coconut milk, and macadamia nut liqueur. Everyone cheers him on]
RESIDENT 14
The haole did it!
KENNY
My dear friends of the mainland,:What adventures I have found on the tiny island of Kava'i. I have truly become one with the natives, who found new courage to fight their oppressors.
CHIEF DAVID
We are not surrendering today! Go back and tell your leaders that we will fight them until the end! [everyone cheers]
CAPTAIN
You people just don't give up, do ya?
KENNY
The American government finally gave in to the natives and had the Mahalo Rewards cards reinstated. Our two cultures, it appears, will once again live in peace.
[Everyone cheers, even the Coast Guard captain]
KENNY
With the war at an end, our Butters is able to have his hapa noa ceremony. And with any help from the gods, become his old cheery self again.
[The hapa noa ceremony, day. Butters will finally become a full-fledged member of his tribe]
CHIEF DAVID
And so it is with great honor that we recognize these two natives with their hapa noa. Take your cards, boys. [two women come up and give them their cards] Apuiloa hapnanoaha! Hapa'a'a hohaaa! [Resident 5 returns to blow the conch shell a third time.] It's finally over, young keiki. Is your anger at rest?
BUTTERS
[he thinks for a moment] Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez.
RESIDENT 15
Ben Affleck isn't with Jennifer Lopez anymore, he's married to Jennifer Gardner.
RESIDENTS
Yeah, it's true, uh huh.
BUTTERS
What? Really? But I thought I was totally jealous of him. He's just married to Jennifer Gardner? Oh my God, I feel so much better. [smiles with relief]
KENNY
(You do?)
BUTTERS
Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology. [he and Kenny walk off into the sunset] Did you see Argo, Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie!
End of Going Native

synopsis:Randy's big plans for Halloween night keep Stan from trick or treating with his friends.

script:A Nightmare on Face Time

[The Marsh house, day. Sharon is carving a pumpkin at the dining room table, Shelly and Stan work on making the pie filling. Randy enters the house with gifts.]
RANDY
[excitedly] Hellooo family! [closes the door] Who wants champagne? [puts the gifts on the sofa]
SHARON
[meeting him at the sofa] Randy, what is all this? [Stan and Shelly follow]
RANDY
It's finally happened, Sharon! [makes to fists and draws them to his chest] I did it! [raises his fists up and lowers them quickly, then opens the gifts. He gives the first one to Sharon] Here you are, my lady. A brand new leather coat, pour vous.
SHARON
[happily] Oho, Randy, it's beautiful!
RANDY
[proudly] And some gifts for the kids too. After all, we're rich now.
STAN
[gets his gift] We're rich?
SHELLY
[gets her gift] Finally.
SHARON
Randy, are you being serious? [smiles]
RANDY
I just wanted to wait until the deal was all finished. We are going into business for ourselves! You are all looking at the new owner of Blockbuster Video! [Sharon frowns]
STAN
[somewhat confused] Blockbuster Video?
RANDY
Last week, I saw it was up for sale. On a fluke I asked how much. $10,000! Can you believe it?! We have the entire business! And we can watch movies whenever we want! Come on, you guys wanna see it?
[On the road, day, under some ominous clouds. Randy drives him family out of town]
RANDY
You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition.
SHARON
I just wish you'd have talked to me before spending all our money.
RANDY
Sharon, it was $10,000 for the entire place! It wasn't gonna last! Don't worry, we'll make the money back in a week. Guaranteed. You excited, Stan?
STAN
Huh? Sorry, I'm watching a movie on my iPad. [they reach their destination and exit the car, and have a look at the place]
RANDY
Well? There she is. [a building in the middle of a parking lot, looking nice, but silent.] It's a new beginning for us! [takes out the key to the building and goes to the front doors to open the store up. The others follow.]
SHELLY
[staying by the car] I don't wanna go in there.
RANDY
Shelly come on!
[Blockbuster Video. The store is dark. A mouse runs past as the camera pans from left to right. Randy opens the door and they all enter. Randy flips on the switches.]
RANDY
Can you believe it? Completely turnkey! [walks towards the shelves while his family stays by the front doors.] Yo got your sci-fi, comedies, buddy flicks, chick flicks, all on Blu-ray or DVD! [returns] Well, what do you think?
STAN
It's awesome. You should try to get it on that Ancient Civilizations show so that people can see how cultures used to live.
RANDY
Oh hahahaha, I get it. Blockbuster is so out of date it's ancient. Haha Sharon, okay I get it.
SHARON
I didn't say anything.
RANDY
You were thinking it. But you're wrong. The average person still wants to rent movies they can hold in their hands. We're gonna have customers up our ass Sharon, UP OUR ASS.
[FRIDAY]
[Randy waits behind the counter for his first customer. Sharon is reading a book, Stan is watching something on his iPad, and Shelly is sorting the DVDs out.]
RANDY
How many uh, how many copies of Meet The Fockers do we have in stock, Shelly?
SHELLY
Six. [picks up another DVD from a stack] We still, have, SIX. [turns and puts it on a shelf with more copies of the DVD]
RANDY
Okay good, that's... that should that should be good... Shelly.
[SATURDAY]
[There's still no business at the store. A red rubber ball bounces towards the front door]
BOY
Go get it, Fillmore! [the boys are on a low cliff across the street.]
FILLMORE
No way, I ain't goin' neer that place. Yeeeyou go get it. [they panic as the front door opens. Randy picks up the ball and sees them]
RANDY
Hey, you kids lookin' to rent some DVDs?
BOY
What's he talkin' about rentin' a divadee?
RANDY
[annoyed] Oh I get it. Blockbuster's so old it's creepy! Haha! Nobody rents movies anymore! [raises his arms as if to grab something] People just don't know we're open yet!
FILLMORE AND FRIEND
AAAAAH! [turn right and run off]
RANDY
[throws the ball back across the street.] Little fucking pricks. [goes back inside and closes the door.]
[TUESDAY]
[Randy walks through the store until he passes an aisle with a woman in it, then steps back and approaches her]
RANDY
Hello, welcome to Blockbuster! [the shopper looks through the TV series boxed sets] Can I help you find something?
SHOPPER
I can't find... [turns her head to face Randy] Turner & Hooch. [turns back to the videos] Where's Turner & Hooch?
RANDY
Oh, ah, I believe we have that over in the uh-
SHOPPER
Aahh... [her voice echoes as she dissolves into thin air]
RANDY
[stunned, then annoyed] Oh. Oh I get it! [looks heavenward] Video stores are so old they have ghosts in them! Okay, thanks! I get it! But you're wrong!
GHOST
[floats by] Emily? [turns into the aisle where the woman was] Emily, the war is over! Let's go rent a movie at Blockbuster!
RANDY
Hahaha, haha! You can be a spooky ghost all you want, it wasn't a stupid idea to buy this place!
GHOST
The hounds are calling, Emily. Let's rent something now! [floats past Randy]
RANDY
I'll have you know that Netflix, Hulu, and Crackle still don't make the money Blockbuster does! Streaming movies is not for everyone!
GHOST
[turns around and looks at Randy] The hounds, Emily! The hounds!
RANDY
Go ahead! All you want, bro! All you want! It was a great idea, but no! Everyone just wants to prove that Rrrandy's gone crazy! [sticks his tongue out and makes noises at him] "Oh don't mind Randy, he's just losing his mind!" [Stan, who doesn't see the ghost, watches from a distance] Drrrr! You know what? Fuck you and Emily!
STAN
[turns and walks to Sharon, who's at the counter looking up things on the ancient CRT monitor] I think something might be wrong with Dad?
SHARON
Ya think? [Stan glances up at her]
[WEDNESDAY]
[HALLOWEEN. It's sunset and kids and their parents are out trick-or-treating. Butters and Jimmy run into Cartman and Kenny, who are not in costume]
BUTTERS
Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?
CARTMAN
We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together.
KENNY
(Yeah.)
CARTMAN
Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?
BUTTERS
I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style.
JIMMY
Wop. Wop, Wop wop, Wopwop Gangnam Style. [grins]
CARTMAN
Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure.
BUTTERS
Come on! What are you guys goin' as?
CARTMAN
[walks off with Kenny] You'll just have to wait and see.
[Blockbuster, at that moment. Sharon dresses Stan up as Captain America while Shelly reads a magazine behind the counter]
SHARON
I think that's good. Feel tight enough?
STAN
Yeah, it's awesome! Thanks, Mom.
SHARON
Let's see the shield.
STAN
[takes up the shield and strikes a pose] Put down the blue orby thing, Red Skull!
SHARON
[claps] Yehay!
RANDY
[arrives] Hey, whoa, what are you doing?
SHARON
Stan's about to go out with his friends.
RANDY
Nono, I need everybody tonight! [Stan loses his enthusiasm] It's our big night!
SHARON
For what?!
RANDY
Agh! It's Halloween! Everyone rents scary movies on Halloween! I'm sorry Stanley, but I need your help here!
SHELLY
God I hate this family!
SHARON
Randy, let him go trick-or-treating.
RANDY
[walks over to some end display] You guys don't understand. We're doing a big Halloween promotion! I've put up flyers and I've got apple-bobbing [a cauldron full of them] and candy corn [in a display case]. This is the night we turn it all around.
STAN
[disappointed] Dad, nobody's gonna come.
RANDY
Oho you'll see! I'm sorry, Stan, but in about thirty minutes this place is gonna be swamped with people trying to rent DVDs!
STAN
Renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs!
RANDY
Ew! [turns right and walks away] That's enough, Stanley! Ew, gross!
STAN
[moments later, on the land line] I can't go trick-or-treating! My dad says I have to stay and help with the store! Yes, I'm serious! I know it sucks, Kyle!
KYLE
[dressed as Thor, in his living room] Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America?
STAN
I know, but there's nothing I can do.
KYLE
But what about the costume contest?!
KENNY
[dressed as Iron Man, comes in from the kitchen] What's going on, Kyle?
KYLE
Stan can't come.
CARTMAN
[dressed as Hulk, comes in from the kitchen] Stan can't come?! But he's fucking Captain America!
STAN
I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion.
KYLE
Does anybody even go to Blockbuster anymore?
STAN
No dude. Nobody. My dad... he's kind of losing it. To be honest, I feel kind of bad for him.
RANDY
[appears from an aisle] Stan, get off the damned phone! People are gonna start callin' to reserve movies! Gau! [goes back into the aisle]
STAN
Oh never mind, I hate him again.
KYLE
Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad?
STAN
Yeah.
KYLE
Okay, I'm gonna go grab mine. I have an idea.
[The neighborhood, later. Kyle pulls a skateboard along on which his iPad is mounted, and Stan is shown on the iPad]
KYLE
All right, where should we trick-or-treat first?
STAN
How about we try the Barkers? Oh, no, it looks like they're not home.
CARTMAN
This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it!
KYLE
He looks fine.
STAN
Oh, let's go to the Petersons' house.
CARTMAN
Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people are gonna be like, "Oh wow, it's the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime skateboard guy!" [they head for a house to their left. Kenny rings the bell. A man opens the door holding a bowl of candy.]
THE BOYS
Trick or treat.
STAN
Trick or treat.
MAN 1
Oh wuhow! Look honey, it's Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and Bruce Vilanch. [Each of the boys (except Stan) make a pose when their respective costumes are said]
CARTMAN
[dropping his pose] I'm not Bruce Vilanch!
MAN 1
Oh, what are you supposed to be? Oh [snaps his fingers] oh, right. You're supposed to be that um... uhhh... [puts his left hand to his head]
CARTMAN
The Incredible...
MAN 1
Right right, the incredibly Chaz Bono. Remember honey? Dancing with the Stars? The fat transsexual?
WOMAN 1
[raises her palms up, then rests them on her legs] Ohhh, cute!
CARTMAN
No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green!
WOMAN 1
[quick gasp] The incredible Harvey Fierstein?
MAN 1
Nnoo, Harvey Fierstein's just gay and fat, honey. He's not green.
CARTMAN
The person I'm dressed as is not fat, and not gay!
MAN 1
The incredibly fat and gay skinny straight man?
CARTMAN
[loses his cool and shuts his eyes] JUST GIVE US SOME FUCKING CANDY! [moments later they're on to the next house] It's Stan's stupid Captain America costume! That's what's throwing everybody off! How are people supposed to get that I'm the Hulk when Captain America is on freaking FaceTime?! [Kenny rings the door bell. A man opens the door holding a bowl of candy.]
KENNY
Trick or treat.
MAN 2
Ohh wow, it's the Avengers!
CARTMAN
That's right!
MAN 2
Oho, and Honey Boo Boo! [Cartman glares at him. The man looks back inside the house] Kids, come see the green Honey Boo Boo costume!
[The sidewalk across from Blockbuster, Halloween night. A couple walks along laughing over something]
GIRLFRIEND
Oh, it's getting colder out.
BOYFRIEND
Yeah, you can definitely tell that winter's coming. [the woman glances to her right, then turns her head to the right. They both stop walking] What's the matter?
GIRLFRIEND
That old creepy place. I saw someone in the window there. [as they look, Randy appears at one of the windows and beckons them to come in. Then he holds up a HALF OFF sign and shakes it a bit]
BOYFRIEND
Come on, let's get out of here. [puts his arm around her shoulders. They hurry off.]
RANDY
[sighs and throws down the sign in frustration] They'll come! [walks off slowly and his voice gets deeper] Sooner or later! They'll have to come!
[Blockbuster, maybe an hour later. The store is fully lit, but there's still no business. There's more snow on the parking lot so that it's almost fully covered. Randy's anger has solidified into a slumped angry walk as he wanders the aisles, grunting and spazzing every once in a while. He stops to fix some DVDs that are out of place, then walks to the candy display under glass in the counter]
RANDY
[closes his eyes and sobs a bit] Wuhy? Why isn't anyone showing up?! [uncovers his eyes and moves his palms down to his cheeks] It's Halloween night! People should be renting spooky movies! [places his hands on the counter] What's happened to the world? Things used to be so simple. [notices something and pounds the glass] Good evening, fine sir! I would like to rent a movie!
GHOST 2
[a former Blockbuster employee] Of course, Mr. Marsh. What'll it be?
RANDY
I'll take a DVD of Robocop 2 and the director's cut of Blade Runner.
GHOST 2
Coming right up. [goes to retrieve the videos]
RANDY
No place like the video store, eh, my friend? Convenience at its peak.
GHOST 2
[types in the order] Your son and wife don't seem to quite agree with you about the video store. In fact, your son seems to think video stores are... as ancient as Madonna's boobs?
RANDY
He's a... he's a very... progressive... little boy. Gets it from his mother.
GHOST 2
If I may say so, Mr. Marsh, your Blockbuster will never get any customers with those two Negative Nancys sabotaging you. You may need to do something... rather extreme. [more sinister] If I may say so, Mr. Marsh. [Randy looks at him, then at Stan, who is off in a corner looking at his iPad.]
STAN
Trick or treat.
GHOST 2
You are the owner of Blockbuster, Mr. Marsh. [Randy feels the pressure and resists it] You must be willing to do anything.
RANDY
No! No I won't do it! Leave him out of this! He's just a little boy! [notices Stan looking at him] Hey Stan. [turns and walks away]
[Another neighborhood, night. The boys continue their trick-or-treating.]
KYLE
We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh-
CARTMAN
Dude dude dude! Check it out. [points to something across the street... a robbery in progress. One robber is outside a Kum & Go minimart. He breaks a surveillance camera with a crowbar, then jimmies the door open and goes in]
STAN
What? What's he doing?
KYLE
Somebody's breaking into that Kum & Go.
CARTMAN
[turns around] You guys, we've gotta stop it!
KYLE
[turns around] Yeah dude! We are the Avengers!
STAN
Hey, where did you guys go?
KYLE
[turns his skateboard around] Oh, sorry dude.
STAN
All right Avengers, what say we take this scumbag down?!
KENNY
Stan and Kyle, you take the back entrance. Cartman and I will block him from the side.
CARTMAN
Cartman SMASH! [they turn around and go into action]
[Kum & Go, inside. The robbers get to work]
ROBBER 1
All right, the camera's out. Hurry up, you two! [the other two robbers are trying to break into a Red Box rental box. They succeed, and some change falls out]
ROBBER 2
What the? You told me these things were full of money!
ROBBER 3
It's Halloween. I thought everyone would be renting spooky movies. [the boys break into the store, with Cartman acting like a rampaging Hulk]
KYLE
[holds up his sledge hammer] For Odin! For Asgard!
ROBBER 4
Who are you?!
CARTMAN
[roars some more, then] Oh crap, there's a bunch of them. Never mind. [walks to the counter and sees a dead clerk slumped over the counter] Holy shit, they shot this guy!
KYLE
Oh my God!
KENNY
Dude, fuck this. Let's bail! [the boys head out the front door with the robbers in hot pursuit]
ROBBER 4
Get 'em!
[Blockbuster, at that moment. Sharon is on the land line with someone]
SHARON
Oh my gosh, that's so cute. And so what is little Monica wearing? Oho, I bet she's adorable. [Randy rises up from behind the bargain bin] No, we've just sort of been here for the most part. Yeah, are you guys staying in? [Randy slides to his right and out of view] You're watching The Thing? Oh that's fun. On Netflix or Hulu? On your Xbox, uh huh. Yeah, no, at some point I'm hoping we can just call it a night and go home. [Randy appears from the right side of the store, way in the back, then disappears again] No, you don't need to send help. Thanks, though. Are you guys getting a lot of trick-or-treaters? Yeah? Oh really? [Randy reappears from the left side of the store, right behind Sharon] Oh, Barbara and Michael? Oh yeah. Uh huh. Ha-hang on a second Karen. [covers the mic and turns to Randy] Can I help you with something?
RANDY
[in a deep falsetto] According to industry experts, many rural areas don't have the bandwidth to support DVD-quality video in streaming services, and won't for years to come, making DVD rentals still the best movie-watching option. [they look at each other for a few seconds]
SHARON
[goes back to her phone call] Sorry, Karen, you were saying? No, it wasn't a customer. No, it's just Randy. [Randy turns around and leaves] Yes, a customer would have been nice, I know.
[Back the the Kum & Go...]
ROBBER 1
God damn it those kids saw us! And you let them get away!
ROBBER 3
It was the Avengers, Brad! [Robber 2 appears at a doorway]
ROBBER 2
Hey, we caught one of them. We got him tied up in the back. [hurries to the back, and the other two follow him]
[The back room. Kyle's iPad is strapped to a chair]
ROBBER 1
All right, who were your friends?
STAN
Just let me go! We're nobody! We didn't see anything! I pro-I promise!
ROBBER 2
He's lying. They saw everything!
ROBBER 1
Let's try this again. [takes out a switchblade and walks up to the iPad]
STAN
No! Dude, please! This is my best friend's iPad! [the robber scratches the glass, leaving a deep gash] Noo! Okayokay, okay! Their names are Bruce, Tony, and Curt
ROBBER 4
Hey, one of them dropped this. [a flier] It's an invitation to a Monster Mash at the community center.
STAN
No no! We weren't gonna go there!
ROBBER 1
[puts away the switchblade and backs off] Sure you weren't! [walks away] Get rid of him!
STAN
NO! [shakes his head] I won't say anything, I promise! [Robbers 2 and 3 take the iPad out to the car]
[The two robbers take the iPad to the side of the road in a desolate place. The trunk pops open and the two robbers look at the iPad]
STAN
What are you gonna do? [Robber 3 takes the iPad out and carries it away] Please! Please just let me go! No!
ROBBER 3
Sorry, kid. End of the line. [throws the iPad into a ditch next to the road. The two robbers get back into the car and drive away]
[Blockbuster, later. Randy has a fixed, angry look on his face as he watches a TV screen. On the screen is Ted, a teddy bear brought to life and now living with his owner as an adult. Ted and his owner share chips and John Adams beer. Over by the counter, Stan tries to make a call, but the cable has been cut in two]
STAN
What the hell? [gets off the stool and walks over to Shelly] Shelly I need to use your cell phone.
SHELLY
[hurriedly and worriedly looking through her duffel bag and back park] I can't find it, Somebody took it!
SHARON
[coming in from outside the store] All right Randy, where are the car keys?! [gets no answer] Randy, where are the keys to the car?! [still gets no answer. Randy is transfixed] God damn it! [walks away in a huff]
[The desolate place, later. The couple who walked by Blockbuster before are walking along a path. The girlfriend holds on to the boyfriend's arm]
BOYFRIEND
Did you have fun at the Halloween party?
GIRLFRIEND
I did. Thanks so much, Ben. And thanks for walking me home. [she notices something off to her right and stops]
BEN
[the boyfriend] What's the matter?
GIRLFRIEND
What is that? [lets go and walks towards the item]
BEN
Whaht is what?
GIRLFRIEND
[stops by the iPad] Somebody dumped a... Oh my God, Ben, it's a little boy! [picks up the iPad, which has Stan back onscreen] Hello? [wipes the screen clean] Are you okay? Little boy?[the screen brightens up]
STAN
Huh? Wha? ...Oh, oh hello? Who is that?
GIRLFRIEND
It's okay. Try and stay calm.
STAN
Oh, ah thank God you found me.
BEN
What is he doing way out here?
STAN
You have to get me to my friends! They aren't safe! [Ben and his girl look at each other]
[Park County Police Station, night. The three Avengers are at the station talking to Sgt. Yates]
KYLE
And then we ran out of the Kum & Go and these guys, th-they took our friend.
SGT. YATES
Sounds like you're talking about the Red Box killers. They've murdered over a dozen people trying to get the cash from Red Boxes.
CARTMAN
Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online?
SGT. YATES
Apparently not. These are dangerous guys. Do you have any idea where they were headed?
OFFICER
Sir, there's a kid over at the hospital saying he saw everything.
[Hell's Pass Hospital. Kyle's iPad is on a bed being tended to, and an officer stands by taking a statement from Stan]
STAN
They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble.
KYLE
Stan! [leads the other Avengers and the police into Stan's hospital room]
STAN
Guys, you're okay!
KYLE
What happened to you?
STAN
It's all right, just a scratch.
CARTMAN
Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys!
STAN
No! They're looking for you there! [to Sgt. Yates] Sir, you've got to cancel the Monster Mash.
SGT. YATES
What?! Are you crazy?! We can't cancel the Monster Mash, it's Halloween Night! It's the Monster Mash's biggest night of the year!
OFFICER 2
The Monster Mash is only on Halloween. [another officer quickly shushes him]
KYLE
Dude, if these guys are as bad as you say, then we have to do something!
STAN
Yeah, people are gonna get hurt.
SGT. YATES
How many people at the Monster Mash?
OFFICER 3
Most of the town, sir. It's a graveyard smash.
OFFICER 4
Look, whatever we do, we'd better hurry. It gets on in a flash.
SGT. YATES
You boys say you can identify the Red Box thieves?
KENNY
Yes. We saw their faces.
SGT. YATES
All right then. We're gonna have to send one of you into the party in disguise.
[The Monster Mash, night. PSY's song, "Gangnam Style", is playing as the town gathers inside the community center, which is decked out for Halloween. Many of the guests are dressed as PSY.]
BUTTERS
That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf. [a giant stops by] Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein!
STAN
Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover.
BUTTERS
Okay, Stan. Enjoy the Monster Mash. [Gangnamstein turns left and runs into a man]
STAN
Oops.
MAN 3
Gaaah!
STAN
Hey, be careful in there.
OFFICER 3
[side the Gangnamstein outfit] Sorry. I can't see a thing in here.
STAN
It's all right. Let's go straight. Now turn left. Okay, now go about ten steps.
A BANANA
Wow, Gangnamstein. I wish I'd have thought of that.
[Back at the Blockbuster, Randy now walks around in a limp and hunched over]
RANDY
Stan?! Daddy wants to have a little talk, Stan! Stanny boy?! I'M COMING! [notices a video and stops] Oh look, Wedding Crashers. [takes it and carries it around, then notices Shelly and stops] What are you doing, Shelly?
SHELLY
[sprays some lighter fluid onto some DVDs on a rack, then lights a match] Nothing, Dad. Go back to killing the family. [tosses the match onto the floor]
RANDY
Okay. [walks on] STAN! [Shelly squeezes some more lighter fluid onto the racks, which quickly go up in flames.] STANNY BOY, I'M COMIN'!
[The Monster Mash. Mr. Mackey is at the podium dressed as PSY.]
MR. MACKEY
Hokay everyone, it's time to start the costume contest. m'kay.
STAN
Wait a minute. There they are!
MR. GARRISON
[turns around] There's who? [the four robbers are shown]
STAN
Listen everybody, those guys right over there are- [some rustling is heard and Randy takes Stan's iPad from him]
RANDY
Who are you people?! You aren't real!
OFFICER 3
Hey hay, I can't see! Where do I go? [begins to walk blindly, and the transformation to Gangnamstein is complete]
RANDY
Do you think I'm crazy for buying Blockbuster?! I'll make you pay! Alluh! All! [everyone begins to run out of the community center.] I got a little somethin' for all of you! [takes a golf club from a golfer and starts swinging it around] Run! You'd better run!
[a family watches a movie on an XBox in the living room. Gangnamstein crashes through the front door.]
RANDY
Waaarg! Look at the people watching movies on their Xbox. Haarrrr!
FAMILY
HAAAAA! [they get off their sofa and run]
RANDY
Haarrrr! [walks forward]
[A toddler's room. Two little boys watch a movie on a tablet. Gangnamstein breaks through the bedroom window and the boys hug each other in sheer fright.]
RANDY
Raaaawr! [falls to the floor, but gets up again]
FILMORE AND QUAID
AAAAA!
RANDY
Streaming Halloween 4! Hahaha!
FILMORE AND QUAID
[get off the bed and run] AAAAA! [run out of the house, with Gangnamstein behind them] AAAAA!
RANDY
AAAAA! [a spotlight shines on Kyle's iPad] AAAAA! [Gangnamstein raises its arms to shield itself from the light. Yates and his officers have arrived and are ready to shoot]
SGT. YATES
FIRE! [the officers fire away]
RANDY
Arrrg! [looks to his left] Hey, what are you doing?!
STAN
[gaining control of his own iPad] It's mine, Dad, get your own! What the hell's going on?! [Officer 3 takes the iPad off and throws it away while he keeps getting shot, and finally falls over dead. The gunfire stops]
SGT. YATES
We got the sonofabitch!
OFFICER 5
Wait, wasn't that Peterson in there? [Officer 2 shushes him quickly]
SGT. YATES
Well, I hope you guys have learned that crime doesn't pay.
ROBBER 1
Not with the convenience of online streaming it don't.
BUTTERS
Kyle! Kyle! It's Stan! He's dying. [Kyle knows what this means and walks over to his iPad]
KYLE
Stan?
STAN
Hey dude.
KYLE
The judging's almost done. You're gonna make it. [the low battery indicator pops up - 5% remaining] Oh God. [turns to the gathering crowd] SOMEBODY GET ME A CHARGER! [turns back to Stan] Hold on Stan! Don't die on us!
STAN
It's okay Kyle, It's okay. Hit OK. [Kyle does so, and the indicator disappears] You guys go win that costume contest. You can do it. Lift the trophy for me.
KYLE
You're gonna see it. [to the crowd] WILL SOMEBODY GET ME A GOD DAMNED CHARGER?
STAN
Just have a good Halloween, you guys. And Kenny?
KENNY
Yeah, Stan?
STAN
Stay gold. [the iPad runs out of juice and the screen goes black, except for some symbols indicating the iPad needs to be recharged. Cartman roars like Hulk in agony.]
[Blockbuster, midnight. Randy walks out of it in a stupor while flames inside it get bigger. Randy slurs his speech so it's hard to understand]
RANDY
Stan?! I'm comin'! I'm comin', Stan! [mumbles incoherently again, waving the videos he took with him in anger] Stan! [finally collapses into a snowdrift]
[Blockbuster parking lot, morning. Randy is now frozen and covered in snow. His facial expression has gotten worse. Sharon, Stan, and Shelly arrive some time later]
SHARON
I spoke with the insurance company. [the destroyed Blockbuster is shown] They said we can get some of our money back. Not all of it, but some. You wanna go home? Get changed? Take a shower?
RANDY
[through frozen lips] No...
SHARON
You wanna just sit here a little more and be frozen?
RANDY
Yeah...
SHARON
You want me to bring you some McDonald's?
RANDY
Okay...
SHARON
What do you want from McDonald's?
RANDY
Chicken nuggets... and fries... sweet and sour sauce... and a Hi-C Orange. [Sharon and the kids turn and walk away. Presumably Sharon has the car keys now. Stan returns and replaces the videos Randy has in his hand with the same movies on his iPad]
End of A Nightmare on Face Time


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:A serious doping scandal shakes everyone's faith in a beloved icon. Everyone who once supported the fallen hero, is now cutting off their symbolic yellow wristbands.

script:A Scause For Applause

[Walgreens, day. A line of people starts at the store entrance and goes out for blocks. Inside, two pharmacists sit at a folding table removing wristbands from people]
PHARMACIST
Next please. [one man gets off a stool and leaves, and another one steps up and sits in it] You are sure you want to do this?
MAN
Of course I'm sure!
PHARMACIST
[gets out some scissors and motions to the man] Okay, roll up your sleeve. [the man rolls up his sleeve as if he's going to receive a flu shot. The nurse sees the yellow bracelet the man is wearing and cuts it off, then puts it into a small tray to her right. The man looks a bit relieved]
[Outside, Cartman waits for his turn to get the wristband cut off]
CARTMAN
[upset] I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool.
[Inside, Clyde gets his wristband removed]
CLYDE
Lying jerk! [hops off the stool and leaves. Mr. Mackey steps up and sits down on the stool, sobbing]
PHARMACIST
[snipping off the wristband] Hold still please.
MR. MACKEY
[stands up and turns to leave] I don't know what to believe in anymore, okay?! [walks away still sobbing]
CARTMAN
All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?! [begins to roll up his sleeve, but then] Oh, hold on. [takes off his jacket and lets it drop to the floor] Aah, let's see... that one. [the same yellow one the others are having cut off. She cuts that one off] Stupid fraud! [spits onto the band] Good riddance to YOU! [picks up his coat and puts it on, walks off, and another man replaces him. The pharmacists adds Cartman's wrist band onto the others]
MAN 2
All right, I'm next! I'm next! Get this thing off of me! [the pharmacist does so.]
[Outside, Cartman walks out to find Kenny, Kyle, and Stan waiting for him]
KYLE
Did you do it?
CARTMAN
Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?!
KENNY
(I told you it was a bad idea.)
CARTMAN
Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?! [Stan sighs and steps forward, turns right and walks away] What's wrong with him?
[The Marsh house, day. Stan walks in and sees Randy on the sofa with a bottle of beer in hand]
RANDY
Oh I feel like such an idiot.
STAN
It's all right, Dad.
RANDY
But I wore that wristband everywhere, and the guy's a complete phoney! [turns on the TV and raises the volume] There's even more coming out about it today.
ANCHOR TOM
These latest tests are once again confirming that the performance-enhancing drug HGH was in the body of Christ at the time of crucifixion. All over the country people are having their "What Would Jesus Do" wristbands cut off. It was just last week a team of scientists found traces of HGH on the Shroud of Turin [actual footage of a corner of the shroud being analyzed is shown] , along with several other illegal compounds and painkillers. [some lab testing is shown, then a panel of scientists addresses the issue]
LEAD SCIENTIST
Without a doubt there was uh HGH in the body of Christ at the time of crucifixion. Jesus did not suffer for our sins, he was in fact very high.
RANDY
All the years of being told somethin'. It's just so unfair!
ANCHOR TOM
Priests and bishops have been working overtime to remove Jesus from the record books and from The Last Supper. [a painter is shown painting over part of Jesus' head. Next, Benedict XVI is shown speaking to the crowds at St. Peter's Basilica. The subs say "It's really a shame that Christ had to bring this embarrassment onto the church. We cannot tolerate any deity who used illegal substances to perform his miracles."]
RANDY
I know people that paid ten bucks for those bracelets. I bet they all feel pretty stupid now. [Stan lowers his head and walks away. He goes upstairs to his room, enters and closes the door, and sits at his desk. He rolls up his left sleeve and gazes at his WWJD bracelet. He sighs heavily.]
[South Park Elementary, day. The school day starts with the kids entering the main building.]
BUTTERS
Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, "Well, what about the New Testament?"
CARTMAN
Uh huh.
BUTTERS
And he says, "Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up."
CARTMAN
So weak dude. Dark times, brah, dark times. [reaches his locker and opens it, then notices Stan. Butters walks over to Craig and another boy.] Dude, what the hell? You're wearing a "What Would Jesus Do" bracelet!
STAN
All right all right, I got it a few weeks ago. Big whoop.
CARTMAN
The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it!
BUTTERS
Yeah, Stan. Didn't you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs?
STAN
Yeah I know.
CARTMAN
Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this!
MR. MACKEY
[walks by in a zombie-like fashion] Wuughhhuh. Where do I go? What do I do?
CRAIG
Cartman's right. If you care about fairness, Stan, then you really have to lose the bracelet.
STAN
Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal.
[The Charlie Rose logo pops up on a TV]
ANNOUNCER
It's the Charlie Rose show. Here's Chuck.
CHARLIE ROSE
We are here tonight with the only person in America who still wears his "What Would Jesus Do" wristband. Please welcome Stan Marsh.
A VOICE
Dick! [Stan looks around]
CHARLIE ROSE
Stan, after everything that's come out, after all the facts have been proven, why do you still wear the wristband?
STAN
I don't know, [looks at his wristband] I just like it.
CHARLIE ROSE
You just like it.
STAN
Yeah. I donno. I've had it a long time, I just don't feel like cutting it off.
CHARLIE ROSE
Well joining us now is just one of the billions of people who think that anyone who still wears their "What Would Jesus Do" wristband is doing all of society a disservice. Chris Martin you say that Stan Marsh is... a dick?
CHRIS MARTIN
Yeah, yeah, thanks Charlie. My problem with this kid is he doesn't care about the truth! Okay, if Jesus rose from the dead with the help of drugs, that's fine, but then he went on to say it was a miracle, and that is where it became dangerous! What about the Incas?! What about the Aztecs?! Millions of people who were murdered in Jesus's name, and then Jesus turns out to be a fraud! Wearing that bracelet is a slap in the face to everyone!
CHARLIE ROSE
What do you say about that, Stan?
STAN
...I don't know. [checks his wristband again] I like it.
CHARLIE ROSE
All right, well we searched high and low to find my next guest who actually agrees with Stan Marsh, and thinks he's doing the right thing. Please welcome a retarded fish. [the fish, wearing a cycling helmet, babbles in the water] Now, Retarded Fish, you don't see any problem at all with someone keeping their bracelet [the fish babbles some more]
CHRIS MARTIN
That that's because, that's because you're a retarded fish, and you don't know any better! What about the Crusades?! The Inquisitions?! How many people were tortured to death for somebody who is a fake?! [the retarded fish lets out a short "blat"]
CHARLIE ROSE
What about the Crusades, Stan? Does that enter into your decision at all?
STAN
No, I just, I don' know. No.
CHARLIE ROSE
Anything to add, Retarded Fish?
RETARDED FISH
Nnno, No, I'm good. Thank you.
[South Park Elementary, day. Stan walks down the hall and Mr. Mackey spots him]
MR. MACKEY
Stan! Hey Stan, can I talk to you? [Stan stops as Mr. Mackey approaches him] Listen, Stan, ah I just wanna tell you... You've really been an inspiration m'kay?
STAN
I have?
MR. MACKEY
Yeah. You know, I can't believe in Jesus anymore, 'cause he's a damned fraud, so what I'm gonna believe in is just bein' me, and bein' independent like you. So what I did is I got this brown bracelet to remind me of standing my ground, uhkay? And just believin' in the cause of bein' me.
STAN
You're wearing a bracelet to think of me?
MR. MACKEY
Oh I'm not the only one. There's lost of people doin' it. [Butters walks by] Hey Butters. Stand ground.
BUTTERS
[turns around and lift up his right arm] Stand ground, Mr. Mackey! [Stan is surprised to see Butters with a brown bracelet. Butters turns around and walks to his locker]
MR. MACKEY
Anyway, thanks Stan. And... you know, just keep on, keep on standing your ground, okay? [walks away. Stan walks over to Butters]
STAN
You're wearing a brown bracelet, Butters?
BUTTERS
Well yeah. [points to it with his left hand] It helps remind me that I shouldn't back down anymore when I feel pressure from other people. I just got really moved when I saw what did for all those farmers in Belarus. [switches folders]
STAN
...Farmers in where?
[A farm in Belarus, day. A group of farmers face down some bulldozers. A different language is spoken, but the subs say]
WORKER
Move aside, farmers! This land is no longer yours!
FARMER
We will not move aside! We will stand our ground! [shows off his bracelet] Like the child on the Charlie Rose show! [the other farmers cheer him on]
STAN
Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands?
BUTTERS
I donno. I got mine down at 7-11. [takes Stan down to the store] See? Right here. [a small rotating stand stocked with Stanground Bracelets is shown]
CLERK
Hello, you interested in the Stanground braceleh-OH! Wow, it's you! [lifts up his right arm to show off his bracelet] Stanground, brah!
STAN
Wow, this is happening so fast.
STEVE NELSON
Hello Stan, Steve Nelson with Endorsement Management. Are you ready for your Nike commercial? [looks at Butters, who smiles back at him]
[The Nike commercial]
STAN
[looking out over a river from a stone bridge] My friends told me I was crazy, [jogging down a sidewalk in a Nike jogging suit] that I was wasting my time. [holding court at a press conference. Cameras all around him take pictures] But my cause is to stand my ground. [sits in a park, then stands up as the sun sets] When others sat, I kept my bracelet on, because I stand... [faces the sun and raises his left arm, still wearing the bracelet. It begins to glow] for standing.
[At a Sizzler]
WAITER
Would you like to be seated?
STAN
No thanks. I'll stand.
[At the movies]
MOVIEGOER
Hey, you wanna siddown?
STAN
I'm good.
[On a flight]
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Sir, the captain has asked everyone to take their seats.
STAN
Tell the captain to take off. [At the gym] People ask me, "You never took the bracelet off? Not once?" [outside, with a sunset behind him] No. Never. Not. Ever. [Three phrases pop up onscreen: "STAN for something. STAN up. STAN ground."] What do I do? I Stan ground. [a double swoosh appears onscreen]
[South Park Elementary, day. Mr. Garrison writes up a bunch of stuff on Dr. Drew]
MR. GARRISON
Now, when Dr. Drew told Jeff Conway he was on a one-way street to nowhere, what tactics did he use to try and convince-? [a classroom door flies open and a bunch of men pour in. Among them is the lead scientist on the Shroud of Turin.]
LAWYER
Mr. Marsh, if you don't mine, we'd like to see your bracelet.
STAN
For what?
LEAD SCIENTIST
If you have nothing to hide, then please hand it over, Mr. Marsh.
KYLE
What are you people talking about?
FIELD REPORTER
Are we good? We live? Tom, I'm here at South Park Elementary, where officials have barged their way in after reports of Stan Marsh of the Stanground Foundation did in fact at one point remove his yellow bracelet. Rumors have surfaced that Stan did not stan his ground as previously stated, and that the wristband is in fact superglued back together.
LEAD SCIENTIST
Please let us check your wristband for superglue.
STAN
No! This is stupid!
BUTTERS
He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone!
LEAD SCIENTIST
Are you afraid we might find glue on your bracelet, Mr. Marsh?
STAN
No! I never cut if off!
LEAD SCIENTIST
Then, let us ah-see it.
JIMMY
[pounding his desk with his fist] This is an outrage! Who out there is saying that our friend Stan is a liar?
LEAD SCIENTIST
I cannot say, but he is a reliable and credible source who is of the utmost prestige.
BUTTERS
Who?
LEAD SCIENTIST
All right, it was Craig. [another scientist steps aside to show Craig]
CARTMAN
Craig?! You asshole!
STAN
What's the big idea, Craig?!
CRAIG
It just looked like you cut it off, that's all.
STAN
You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people!
BUTTERS
Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground!
THE CLASS
Yeah!
STAN
You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside!
BUTTERS
Go Stan!
STAN
And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out!
BUTTERS
...A little unnecessary, but go Stan!
STAN
Go ahead and test it! Then let's just see what happens to this money-hungry, alcoholic prostitute!
THE CLASS
Yeah!
BUTTERS
Prostitute!
[Breaking News]
ANNOUNCER
This is breaking news.
ANCHOR TOM
The tests are done and the results are in. The little boy who claimed he never cut off his "What Would Jesus Do" bracelet did cut it off, and lied about it.
LEAD SCIENTIST
Not only did we find traces of ah-superglue, but of yellow magic ah-markeur as well. This is a dark ah-day for honest French-Swedish people everywheure.
ANCHOR TOM
Though the tests seem conclusive, Stan Marsh continues to deny any cheating.
[Stan's room, night. He's got posters of STANdground all over his walls, but he's pissed off. Someone knocks on his door]
STAN
Yeah. [the door opens and Kyle enters]
KYLE
Hey dude, people are kind of pissed off at you.
STAN
Thanks Kyle.
KYLE
You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet?
STAN
Why does it matter?!
KYLE
Because you kind of made it matter.
STAN
You know, I'm just, I'm just through with this whole thing! I just, I can't put my family through any more of this!
KYLE
S-so you did superglue it.
STAN
[hops off his bed and walks over to his desk] Ugh, you know what's really sad?! That this is what matters to people! What nobody seems to remember are the farmers in Belarus! STANground is bigger than me! You wanna tell all those farmers in Belarus it's all bullcrap?!
KYLE
Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this.
STAN
You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I wasn't, for what, Kyle?! For what?! [Kyle looks around at all the Nike merchandise] This is a witch hunt, dude! It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it!
[The lead scientist's mansion, night. He's dressed in pajamas and doing squats in his bedroom as his wife reads a book in bed]
WIFE
Would you mind getting me some water, darling?
LEAD SCIENTIST
Can't you see I'm trying to do ah-my calisthenics?
WIFE
But my throat is parched, dear, and I'm so scared of burglars.
LEAD SCIENTIST
[stops and turns towards the bedroom door] Is ah-tap water going to be okay, or do you want me to go down to Crystal Geyser and bring Her Highness some right from the spring?
WIFE
Tap is fine, dear. [the scientist leaves]
[The lead scientist's mansion, night, outside. A shadow appears and approaches the front door.]
[The lead scientist's mansion, bedroom. The scientist gives his wife a glass of tap water and goes back to his calisthenics]
WIFE
What was that? I could have sworn I saw something outside.
LEAD SCIENTIST
It's ah-your imagination
WIFE
[moments later] Oh darling, could you change the channel for me? The remote is dead. [the scientist glares at her, sighs heavily and goes to the TV, which is set to a show on the Jewelry & Gold Shopping Network]
LEAD SCIENTIST
[feeling bossed around] You just want me to change the channel or should I go and make a TV program written ah-just for you?!
WIFE
No, just change to channel 10, thanks.
LEAD SCIENTIST
It's ah-starting to feel like ah-The Carole Burnett Show in here. [clicks through the channels]
[The lead scientist's mansion, elsewhere. The shadow is now inside, and it bumps into a table on which a vase sits. The vase falls and shatters]
WIFE
What was that?! I think somebody's here!
LEAD SCIENTIST
[back to his squats] Maybe it's ah-the peepee fairy so somebody can ah-take a peepee for you too.
WIFE
Please I'm terrified. Please go check it out. [the scientist again sighs heavily and leaves the room]
[The mansion, elsewhere. The shadow approaches a corner when Stan comes in from the other side of the screen. The shadow turns out to be Jesus.]
STAN
Jesus!
JESUS
Shhhh.
STAN
What are you doing here?
JESUS
My child, the man who lives here has led a witch hunt to destroy my legacy. I am simply here to search for something I can use...
STAN AND JESUS
...to discredit him too.
JESUS
That's what I'm doing. [the lights come on]
LEAD SCIENTIST
Oh, it's ah-Tweedle Dumb and ah-Tweedle Dee trying to break in-ah-to my house!
STAN
Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything?
JESUS
Sometimes it is best to say nothing, my son.
STAN
Yeah, I've been kind of seein' that.
LEAD SCIENTIST
Ah-excuse me, I'm sorry to intrude, but do you want to please ah-leave or should I make you some kofel bread and ah-sausages?!
[The living room, later. They stay for bread and sausages.]
STAN
It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial.
JESUS
Yeah, I know how it goes.
STAN
Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair.
JESUS
I know. I just feel like if people could see me in action again, they'd they'd realize I'm not a fraud.
LEAD SCIENTIST
[returns in a maid outfit over his pajamas] Here you go, kofel bread and some sausage for you.
STAN
Thanks a lot. [the scientist turns around and leaves.] Jesus, did you take HGH to do your miracles?
JESUS
NO! Pff! That's just... no! Okay? No. Everyone just lost their faith. Did you cut your wristband off, my son?
STAN
NO! Pff! No, that's no, okay? No. And anyway, it's not even the issue.
JESUS
Pff, I know, right?
STAN
Pff it's like, that's here [puts his hand up, palm down, about two inches above the bread] and...
JESUS
Pfyeah and we're, like, you know, p-yeah, here. [briefly raises his left hand, palm down, to about six inches above Stan's head]
STAN
Pff, there's there's farmers in Belarus who are in a life and death struggle. THAT's what should be important!
JESUS
P-yeah! Instead of focusing on us, we need to get everyone focusing on what matters! Where's Belaruh-ruh-roos?
STAN
Exactly! People don't even know where it is.
JESUS
Maybe, if we could get people to care about it, then I could go and save it, and people would be stoked on me again!
STAN
How can we raise awareness?
JESUS
We need to get some bracelets.
[Something straight out of Dr. Seuss, day, Scauses Factory. Inside a fantastic building sits a man behind a warped desk. Stan and Jesus sit on two thrones opposite him]
P.F. PITYEF
Welcome, welcome, to the P.F. Pityef Bracelet Factory. How can I be of service?
STAN
Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets...
P.F. PITYEF
Ah, I see you're wearing one of our brown scauses already. Delightful. What color would you like your new scause to be?
STAN
Our... scause?
P.F. PITYEF
Well of course! You came for a scause to wear on your paws. And you want others to wear yours upon thaurs.
JESUS
I'm confused.
P.F. PITYEF
Hm. Perhaps I should start from the beginning. [Stan and Jesus look at each other. What follows is a montage of Seussian animation elaborating on the poem below]
In the modern age there are those who believe
That a cause is a thing to be worn on one's sleeve. [the time frame here is the 1920s, based on the style of dress. everyone has their arms raised to show off their scauses]
And so, we sell a cause. It's called a scause.
And wearing a scause gets you lots of applause. [opens some doors to show some clapping machines]
We start with some plastic which is shirped by our shirpist
Then dip it in colors that show off your purpose.
There are green scauses for recycling, blue scauses for kitties, [Animal Rights]
And pink scauses that focus on nothing but titties. [Breast Cancer]
Do you hate abortion? Ah! Then a white scause is for you! [Pro Life]
Why not champion your scause with some sparkles and glue?
We make scauses for this! We make scauses for that! [Chilean Miners, then Save The Dolphins, then Stop Water Pollution]
Why there's even a scause for just being fat! [Test Subject, with a Tree Hugger on the side]
What's the matter? Can't think of a scause? [talking to Jesus]
How about raising awareness for the hairs in your schnozz?
Let's just think of the thing that you care about most. [talking to Stan, so Belarus]
Then let's make it orange, like marmalade toast!
And now I'd like to say "thank you" for your coming down.
I'm off to go sell these in your little town!
STAN
Dude, the hell just happen?
[South Park Elementary, day. The students mill around in the hallway before class. Mr. Mackey walks among them.]
MR. MACKEY
Kids? Kids, okay, I need to talk to you about a serious matter. [the group he addresses includes Red, Bebe, Butters, Jimmy, Craig, and Clyde] You probably all noticed my orange wristband [shows it off], mkay? It's to show my solidarity with the people of Belarus. [Stan is at his locker and notices, then turns toward the locker and smiles to himself] Mkay, you should know that the Belarusian government is right now trying to-
CRAIG
We know, Mr. Mackey. We all have our Belarus bracelets too. [the kids raise their arms to prove it]
MR. MACKEY
Oh you do? Ya you got you got those? Okay, okay, that's good! Good you're doin' something about it, m'kay. [sees another group of kids and goes towards it] Uh hey kids. Kids over here...
CARTMAN
[meets the first group] Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them?
CLYDE
There's a guy selling them downtown. But they're not made from recycled plastic.
CARTMAN
Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic!
CLYDE
Yes you do. [tugs on the yellow wristband]
CARTMAN
...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.
BUTTERS
[approaches Stan] Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers.
STAN
People are saying that? [pleased]
BUTTERS
Yeeah. Is it true?
STAN
Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence.
BUTTERS
Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole, [pokes Stan in the belly] but n-now I think you're a cute sneaky little butthole. [smiles, turns and walks away]
STAN
[looks heavenward] We did it. [Butters goes around a corner and out of view]
[The news.]
ANCHOR TOM
It has become the biggest concern for most people. The farmers of Belarus and their plight against their government. And now one person is taking it upon himself to end the crisis. His name? Jesus.
[Belarus, day, a field. A group of farmers faces bulldozers and tanks.]
JESUS
These are very troubling times and these farmers are literally fighting for their lives. You know I'm uh, ah-I'm here just to do whatever I can.
FIELD REPORTER
Jesus, some people might be thinking you're doing this as some kind of a publicity stunt to put to rest the rumors of your drug use?
JESUS
You know, ah I don't even have time to think about that. This is a crisis that needs my attention and I'm just here to do whatever I can. I've talked to the government here and I've talked to the farmers, and I think we have everything just about worked out. [a tank unleashes a bomb and a bunch of farmers are killed]
FARMERS
AAAAH!! [the tanks open fire with machine guns; more farmers are killed, until the last one falls]
JESUS
You know, whatever stupid rumors people wanna believe about me, it doesn't change the fact that the people of Belarus need my help.
FIELD REPORTER
Ah I believe it's Belarus, Jesus.
JESUS
Yes, it very well may be if we don't do something now. [the tanks and bulldozers move forward to crush the corpses of the farmers]
FIELD REPORTER
Um, so you think you've something here to keep the conflict from escalating, is that right?
JESUS
I'm just doing what I've always done. People wanna know what I'm on. What am I on? I'm on a farm in Belarus busting my ass! What are you on?!
FIELD REPORTER
Uh huh, and now that the Belarusian farmers are all dead, what will you try next?
JESUS
What? [turns around] Aw, shit!
[South Park, day. P.F. Pityef is in town and has set up a makeshift Scauses stand on an empty lot between two other buildings. A small crowd is in front of the stand. In the crowd are Cartman, Butters, Craig, and Mr. Mackey]
P.F. PITYEF
One at a time, please. One at a time.
MR. MACKEY
Look, I want to return this orange bracelet, m'kay?! [it looks like everyone else does too.] It's worthless now!
P.F. PITYEF
Not a problem, you can return your scause and for just five dollars I'll give you two more!
CARTMAN
[steps up] Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle.
P.F. PITYEF
Absolutely! Five dollars please.
[Stan stands across the street from the stand, and Kyle walks up to him.]
KYLE
Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week.
STAN
[glares at Kyle] Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?! [a bouncy noise is heard]
P.F. PITYEF
Oh my, it's the sound!
BUTTERS
Wu-what sound?
P.F. PITYEF
Of all sounds in all sounddom this one's most profound. [puts his ear against a funnel in which a penny circles round] That's the sound that means I must pack up my tent. It's the sound of the last cent being spent. [quickly goes to a control panel and starts pressing buttons, and his stand collapses into a truck. He gets in and drives off] My work here is done, and just look at you now! You're all covered in scauses from your hoof to your brow. Enjoy all your scauses. You look great in your cause. Be sure to give each other lots of applause. I'm off to the next town in my little truck. Have a nice day! Toot a loo!
CARTMAN
...Fuck! Dude, weak. [the town is covered in scauses and looks like a Dr. Seuss town]
[Stan's house. Jesus and Stan sit on the sofa looking dejected]
STAN
It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along.
JESUS
Yeah...
STAN
We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company.
JESUS
Yeah, well, I guess we're just gonna have to accept that people aren't gonna think very highly of us.
STAN
Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money.
JESUS
What can we possibly do?
STAN
[after a long while] What would Jesus do? [Rocky fanfare plays and Jesus slowly gets energized. He gets off the sofa and walks to the dining room table, reaches into his robe and pulls out a big bottle of HGH. He plants it on the table and opens it. He pours some into the cap and drinks it. He transforms into a superhuman and flips the dining room table over. He turns and breaks through the front wall, obliterating the front door, and runs off to find the charlatan. Stan looks on] Yeheah! [Jesus goes to the Scauses factory and flips over every truck he finds in his way, then bursts into the factory. He beats up all the workers there]
JESUS
Vengeance is mine! [he destroys the assembly line]
P.F. PITYEF
No please! Please show mercy!
JESUS
Get out! [picks him up and shoves him into a grinder. P.F. Pityef is ground up, but his remains clog up the grinder and raise the pressure throughout the factory. Soon the factory blows up. Everyone in town has shown up to see this and burst into applause. Later, Jesus is back to normal and on a small hill - a mount - and speaks to the crowd]
JESUS
Thank you my children. [the crowd quiets down] We've all been through a lot. We got caught up in scauses... that didn't mean squat. They turned my message away from the teachings it hid, and made it about me and the things that I did. Which of course I didn't do. And even if I did use performance-enhancing drugs, so did all the other prophets. But I didn't. So what have we learned from this great wristband theft? Maybe, that when stripped of our scauses, only causes are left. And causes shouldn't be worn on our wrists with a sneer. Let's keep our causes where they belong, which is [places his hands over his heart] right here. On T-shirts! [opens his robe enough to show his cause] Free Pussy Riot! [the crowd begins to clap and cheer]
MR. MACKEY
Free Pussy Riot!
THE BOYS
[look at each other and then] Yeah!

Mom?! I lost my Mooohhm!
[a plane zooms through the sky. Cartman has an aisle seat again, and a flight attendant walks his way with snacks.]
FLIGHT ATTENDANT 2
Warm nuts, sir? Warm nuts?
CARTMAN
[breaks into a smile and laughs] No way dude. No way.
[Ohio, 5:00 pm CST (The correct time zone should have been Eastern, 3 pm Mountain)]
CARTMAN
MOOOM! I can't find my mooom!
[a plane zooms through the sky. Cartman has a middle seat again, and a flight attendant stops to offer the aisle passenger something.]
FLIGHT ATTENDANT 3
Would you like warm nuts, sir? [the man accepts the nuts and smiles]
CARTMAN
Ahaha, okay okay it's getting old. [both passenger and attendant frown at him]
[Las Vegas, 3 pm Pacific (4 pm Mountain). Cartman runs through the polling station, and then back]
CARTMAN
MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM!
[Wednesday, the day after, Kyle's house. In the living room, Kyle and Ike sit on the sofa, with Ike crying.]
[News]
ANCHOR
The people have spoken, and the President of the United States is once again, Barack Obama.
PRESIDENT OBAMA
I assure you all, I am heading back to the White House more motivated - more titillated - than ever. [Ike begins to bawl.]
KYLE
Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all. [the phone rings and he answers it.] Hello?
CARTMAN
[from the Cartman kitchen] Hey Kyle. What's up?
KYLE
Nothing, watching the election results.
CARTMAN
Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society. [Kyle glances at Ike.] Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you.
KYLE
What?!
CARTMAN
Please, Kyle. It's kind of important.
[Cartman's house, moments later. Cartman leads Kyle upstairs to his room]
KYLE
Alright, what is this all about, fatass?!
CARTMAN
You happy with the election results last night, Kyle?
KYLE
It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president.
CARTMAN
Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election? [beams]
KYLE
Sure you do!
CARTMAN
What if I did, Kyle?
KYLE
Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election? [Cartman smiles and opens his bedroom door, then shows him in. Inside are stacks and stacks of ballots Cartman has stolen from various states: Nevada, Florida, Idaho, Colorado, Virginia, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. Kyle's jaw drops]
CARTMAN
Pretty sweet, huh?
KYLE
What the hell is this?
CARTMAN
What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.
KYLE
I don't believe it.
CARTMAN
No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.
KYLE
Why do you have these?
CARTMAN
[walks up to a stack] Funny how voting works in this country, isn't it, Kyle. [holds up a ballot] Each one of these, a person. Someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed. Actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was heard. [tears the ballot in two, lets the pieces fall, and fakes a shocked face]
KYLE
Dude!
CARTMAN
[Walks over to another stack] Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate. [tears up that ballot]
KYLE
Knock it off, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone.
KYLE
You're not getting away with this, you fat turd! [turns around and walks out. Cartman waits a few seconds and walks to his window. He sees Kyle walk to the sidewalk, then turn right and go down the street.]
CARTMAN
Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan.
LIANE
[steps in] Sweetie, there's a Mr. Pun Li Tsiao on the phone for you?
CARTMAN
Thanks Mom, [she leaves] I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.
[The White House, day. A Secret Service agent runs down the hall towards the Oval Office, opens the doors, and goes in]
AGENT
Mr. President?
PRESIDENT OBAMA
Yes?
AGENT
Line 2 from China for you, sir. It's General Tso.
PRESIDENT OBAMA
[picks up the receiver and presses the Line 2 button] Yes, hello General.
GENERAL TSO
We assume you are preased with the erection results?
PRESIDENT OBAMA
Very pleased. Thank you for your help.
GENERAL TSO
And you no doubt will now begin filling your side of the bargain.
PRESIDENT OBAMA
You'll have what you want. I'll meet you in three hours. [hangs up and slumps in his chair a little]
AGENT
Sir, the election may have gone the way they said, but we can't possibly give the Chinese what you promised.
PRESIDENT OBAMA
[rises and goes to a window] I don't know how they did it, but the Chinese secured my victory. I have to fulfill my obligation.
AGENT
And what if General Tso suddenly gets the courage to go to the press with all this?
PRESIDENT OBAMA
Don't worry. Everyone knows General Tso's chicken.
[Cartman's house, day. Kyle is at the front door with two police officers. One of the officers knocks, and Cartman answers the door.]
OFFICER 1
Eric Cartman? We have a report you might be involved in voter fraud?
CARTMAN
[strokes his chin] Hmmm, no.
OFFICER 2
You mind if we search your room?
CARTMAN
I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission.
KYLE
This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it.
OFFICER 1
Let's just see. [the officers go in, and Kyle follows]
CARTMAN
Ey! You can't do that! Ey!
KYLE
Upstairs! First door to the left!
[Upstairs. The officers have reached Cartman's room. Officer 1 opens the door]
CARTMAN
I know my rights! Stop right now! [Kyle and the officers go in... and find nothing]
KYLE
But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!
CARTMAN
I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing.
OFFICER 2
Oh my God, what have we done?
OFFICER 1
Guess this country is changing. We're sorry little boy, we're SO sorry. [The officers walk out]
KYLE
Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!
CARTMAN
But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time. [Kyle turns right and runs down the stairs]
[The neighborhood park, day. Seven kids are shown playing basketball: Timmy and Jimmy are there, as are Stan, Tolkien, Craig, Butters, and Kenny. Stan has the ball and tosses it to Craig, who makes a basket. Butters catches the ball. In the background, Kyle runs up to the entrance]
KYLE
Guys! You guys! [runs into the group] Listen: Cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere. He's changed the outcome of the election!
STAN
Wow, really? That's pretty impressive.
KYLE
Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them!
STAN
But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night.
KYLE
Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter.
STAN
I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me.
JIMMY
Yeah, I love when Morgan Freeman explains stuff.
CRAIG
Whenever I'm confused about what's going on in a movie, I'm always so relieved when Morgan Freeman shows up and explains the plot to me.
KYLE
God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!
BUTTERS
Well, mmmaybe Cartman had a good reason.
KYLE
[stares at Butters for a while] Butters, you know something, don't you?!
BUTTERS
Huh? Wha? NO. Uhuh, why?
KYLE
[walks towards Butters] What did Cartman tell you?!
BUTTERS
He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think. [glances over his shoulder and gasps] Uh, don't make me say any more!
KYLE
Tell us what you know right now!
BUTTERS
I can't! Don't you see?! [feels around his body for something, and finally finds it: a small bottle. He opens it up and pulls out a blue M&M.] Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it
STAN
Is that an M&M?
BUTTERS
[his voice trembles] It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Please, just leave me alone.
KYLE
Then you have to tell us!
BUTTERS
Well... hah... HWAAAH! [quickly swallows the pill and makes sure he doesn't throw up]
KYLE
Oh shit! Don't let him swallow it! [Butters falls back, stiff]
STAN
Pry his mouth open!
CRAIG
He ate it!
KYLE
Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?!
BUTTERS
Ah! Bah! I hate almonds. [passes out]
[Red Lobster, later. Cartman is at a table eating lobster legs. He's working on one plate while three others and a bucket of lobster legs await his appetite]
WAITRESS
More melted butter, sir?
CARTMAN
Mm, mhm, mhm.
GENERAL TSO
[lets out an exasperated sigh] Little boy, the President is on his way to pick up the ballots. Where are they?!
CARTMAN
They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit.
GENERAL TSO
Alter our... The President will be here in moments with what we want!
CARTMAN
Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it?
A DINER
Oh my God, it's the President! [the President comes in with his Secret Service detail and diners come up to greet him]
PRESIDENT OBAMA
Thank you, thank you all for your votes of confidence. If I could... just be a little rude and ask for a nice quiet meal in private?
DINER 1
Oh, of course. Come on, let's let the President have some peace and quiet. [the diners begin to leave the restaurant]
DINER 2
Wow, the President eats at Red Lobster. He's just a normal guy like me.
DINER 3
Come on guys. President says "get out." [chuckles]
DINER 4
I didn't actually vote for him. [chuckles. Two agents guard the doors until the diners are gone, then close the doors, while two other agents join President Obama at the table]
PRESIDENT OBAMA
All right. Where are the ballots? [Cartman cracks open a lobster leg.]
[The ER, somewhere, day. The boys are there to visit Butters and the doctor is with them.]
DOCTOR
Your friend has had a severe allergic reaction.
KYLE
Can we please just try and talk to him?
DOCTOR
All right, but don't take too long. [the boys go in]
BUTTERS
[hard to understand with his face puffed up] What's up fellas?
KYLE
Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to!
BUTTERS
Bleh, ogayedmi.
KYLE
I didn't wanna have to do this. [opens his flip phone and presses some keys] but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President!
BUTTERS
AGH! No! Please! You can't!
KYLE
Then just tell me what Cartman is up to!
BUTTERS
Okay! Okay! He's helping the Chinese get something they want.
STAN
What'd he say? [Kenny mumbles his reply and Stan understands that] Oh. Well what do you mean the election isn't the biggest thing that happened this week?
BUTTERS
Because the Chinese actually want to protect something that's important.
KYLE
What? [Kenny mumbles his translation] You mean the missile defense program?! [to Butters] Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?!
BUTTERS
At Red Robster. [Kyle looks at Kenny]
KENNY
(At Red Lobster.)
KYLE
[still not getting it] Where?
BUTTERS
[enunciating as best he can] Red Lobster!
STAN
Huh?
JIMMY
He said "at Ruh ruh rruh ruh Reh Red"
BUTTERS
[enunciating as best he can] Red Lobster!
KENNY
(Red Lobster!)
KYLE
What?
JIMMY
Ruh Rehh... Red
BUTTERS
[stressing] Red Lobster!
KENNY
(Red Lobster!)
STAN
Oh, Red Lobster.
[Red Lobster, later. The high-level meeting continues]
PRESIDENT OBAMA
General Tso, do you have the missing ballots or not?
GENERAL TSO
Sssure, we have the ballots, but we don't have them right here with us now. [Obama looks at the general, then glances at Cartman]
PRESIDENT OBAMA
Okay, you want me to come in again, we can start over, what the fuck is this?!
KYLE
All right, where are the missing ballots?! [noticing the President] President Obama?
CARTMAN
Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted.
GENERAL TSO
Mr. President, we got you reelected! Now you will give us the Star Wars technology so that we can make the sequels!
PRESIDENT OBAMA
I told you China would get the rights to Star Wars from Disney as long as my Presidency was secure! [looks at Cartman] Until I have those ballots [looks at the general] it is not secure!
KYLE
Wait a minute, the rights to Star Wars, the movies? What the hell is going on here?!
MORGAN FREEMAN
[voice only] What's going on is the sale of America's greatest asset. [music plays as he walks into view] You see, when the United States created Star Wars it made this country incredibly powerful.
GENERAL TSO
Morgan Freeman?
MORGAN FREEMAN
[pacing back and forth] Earlier this week, Lucas signed the rights to Star Wars over to Disney, and the Chinese saw a way to obtain it for themselves. The Chinese government knew that President Obama would help them take the rights from Disney if they helped him get reelected.
CRAIG
Ohhhh.
MORGAN FREEMAN
But the child who actually stole the ballots has hidden them, and won't give them to anyone until his demands are met. You've all got quite a mess on your hands. I wish you well with it. [turns around and goes back the way he came in]
STAN
Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman: [Freeman turns around and faces the group] How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up?
MORGAN FREEMAN
Because every time I show up and explain something, I earn a freckle. [a sparkle lights up on his right cheek as a small bell sounds, fades, and leaves a new freckle there. He turns around and resumes his departure]
CARTMAN
So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker.
GENERAL TSO
That was not the deal! We will not be a-bullied by you!
CARTMAN
Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken, General Tso. [takes out a small ball-shaped bomb, smashes it against the table, and disappears in the resulting smoke.]
JIMMY
Heheh, I get it. General Tso's chih-chih-chicken.
[Two secret service agents walk down a hallway somewhere]
MIKE
You are absolutely sure about this?
AGENT 2
It's been confirmed, Mike. My God, we might have won this thing. [they reach the end of the hall]
MIKE
[knocks three times, then opens the double doors and goes in] Sir? Sir, we have some... incredible news. There are rumors of hundreds of thousands of stolen ballots. You might have won the election after all. [Duck President is shown. He lets out a loud quack with shit spewing out his mouth]
[Cartman's house, evening. Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Tolkien are in Cartman's living room rummaging through boxes of clothes looking for the ballots. Craig rips open the sofa cushions to look for them]
STAN
There's nothing here, Kyle. [Jimmy walks in from the dining room]
KYLE
Anything in the basement, Jimmy?
JIMMY
Just old junk, and boxes of Eric's mom's d-dildos
KYLE
Well keep looking.
LIANE
[walks in with some items] Oh my goodness, what's going on?
KYLE
Sorry Ms. Cartman, but your son took some things that didn't belong to him.
LIANE
Oh, I've told him to respect people's property. What did he take?
STAN
He stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected President.
LIANE
[walks towards the kitchen] Oh well, no TV for him for a few days.
JIMMY
There's nothing here, Kyle. Not even one s-s-scooby clue.
STAN
Oh my God you guys, look! [points across the street. The boys walk out as the sound of a large vehicle is heard] Dude, it's Boba Fett's ship! [Indeed. The ship arrives and positions itself for landing, then descends onto the road. After a big thud, the ship's door opens... and out swaggers Mickey Mouse]
MICKEY MOUSE
Just what the Dickens is going on here, haha?!
STAN
Aw shit, it's him again.
MICKEY MOUSE
What's this about a deal with the Chinese?! I own all this shit now! I own the Death Star! I own Tatooine! It's all MINE, haha! All right fuckers, where are the missing ballots? Haha.
[The hospital, night. Butters is still in recovery, and his face is still puffy. He's asleep]
CARTMAN
Butters. [Butters jumps up and is wide awake] You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters?
BUTTERS
I didn't say anything. I promise.
CARTMAN
I guess we learned that when it comes to Star Wars, we can't trust anyone. Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you.
BUTTERS
Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear!
CARTMAN
Shhh, it's okay, Butters. [brings forth an M&M bag and opens it] Nobody's gonna find the election ballots. [pulls out a blue almond M&M.] I have them hidden away somewhere... nobody would ever look. [places the M&M in Butters' mouth and closes it] A place in town people barely even know exists.
[A Hummer outdoor dealership. The salesman stands around waiting for customers. Behind him is a lot full of pristine Hummers]
SALESMAN
Hey guys. Lookin' to buy a Hummer today? [a family leaving the KFC across the street heads for its car in the KFC parking lot] We're havin' a Rocktober sales event day that's goin' into Rockvember. [the family piles into the car, the father starts it, and the family drives away. The salesman watches the family leave, then turns around and walks to a different spot - next to the missing ballots.] Hey there! Interested in test-drivin' a Hummer today? [a lone man walks slowly down the sidewalk on a cross street. Mr. Hummer takes out his hands and starts gesturing] I can see you, with the Ray-Bans, got that nice bicep haning' out the window rolled down, whattaya think? [the man looks at him, then begins to walk faster] Rockvember sales event, guys! Every Hummer comes with a free Segway.
CAFÉ MONET DINER
[at a Café Monet across a third street.] Hey why don't you shut up?!
SALESMAN
I'm just excited about all these deals, that's all. [puts his hands in his pockets]
[Disneyland, night. The park has closed. AT-STs patrol the grounds as TIE fighters zoom by overhead. Mickey walks through Cinderella's castle towards a door as it opens upward and reveals two storm troopers escorting Cartman, in handcuffs, to him]
STORM TROOPER
We found him sir, but still no sign of the missing ballots.
MICKEY MOUSE
Go on! Leave us alone! Haha. [the storm troopers step outside and the door comes down behind them. Mickey and Cartman walk away from the door] Now listen, little boy, the reason this country works is because people go out to vote. Every vote counts. And you need-
CARTMAN
Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese!
MICKEY MOUSE
Why don't you just tell me where the missing ballots are?! It will make your death a lot less painful! Haha.
CARTMAN
Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose Star Wars to the Chinese forever!
MICKEY MOUSE
[whips out his light saber] Pretty neat, huh? How would you like to have one?
CARTMAN
I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that!
MICKEY MOUSE
[turns off his light saber] Like what?!
CARTMAN
I want a part in the new movies!
MICKEY MOUSE
[brightens up] Well then, why didn't you just come to me in the first place? If you wanna be in the next Star Wars, I'm your guy! Haha.
CARTMAN
I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca.
MICKEY MOUSE
You can be Luke's son, you can be Han Solo's son, I don't give two shits and a popsicle.
CARTMAN
Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun.
MICKEY MOUSE
Sure thing. I've got tauntauns comin' out my asshole, haha.
CARTMAN
Haha.
MICKEY MOUSE
Haha.
CARTMAN
Haha. [and a new partnership is formed.]
[Breaking Election News.]
WOLF BLITZER
This is Breaking Election News. Hold that phone! The election may be over, but rumors are running rampant that hundreds of thousands of ballots for Mitt Romney were stolen!
KYLE
[with a field reporter at City Hall, with the other boys behind them] We need everyone's help here. What you're looking for are big boxes of ballots. Hundreds of them. Please check your basement, your attic, and-
FIELD REPORTER
And and you claim that a General Tso hired your friend, Fatass, to steal the ballots, but so far the Chinese are refusing to speak with us.
KYLE
Yeah, probably 'cause General Tso's chicken. [sirens and bells sound]
FIELD REPORTER
Is that it? Did he just? Did he just?
WOLF BLITZER
Yup. Chris, we're getting confirmation that was the millionth time.
CHRIS
Excitement and revelry at South Park as a little boy has just made the General Tso's chicken joke for the one millionth time. [confetti and balloons float down from the sky]
KYLE
What?
FIELD REPORTER
Little boy, the General Tso's chicken joke, a favorite for years, you've just hit the magic number, how does it feel?
KYLE
[quite confused] I... what? [a woman comes in from screen left with a check for five thousand dollars from P.F. Chang while another woman comes in from screen left with a sign saying "ONE MILLION TIMES!!!!!"]
FIELD REPORTER
He's being presented with the check now, a five thousand dollar gift certificate to P.F. Chang's. [Kyle holds the check up and the reporter gets closer to the camera] This has been a long campaign, but someone's finally done it, Wolf.
[South Park, later. The boys are sitting on the curb near Tele's, eating Chinese food]
STAN
Well, we tried, dude.
KYLE
It just seems so unfair. People won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House.
STAN
Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much?
KYLE
It matters, Stan. It it matters.
A SANTA
[voice only] Ho ho ho hoo! [Kyle glances at the TVs and walks over to get a better look] Come on down to Stevenson Hummer for our big Christmas in Humvember Sale! [same dealership as earlier, with Mr. Hummer wearing Santa facial hair and cap, ringing a bell and shaking a rattle stick] Not sure what to get your loved one this holiday season? Why not give them a nice Hummer? Nothing beats a Hummer on Christmas morning! [dances a bit. Stan joins him at Tele's picture window]
STAN
Stan, when was the last time you saw somebody drive a Hummer?
STAN
Uhhh, forever ago, like, 2010?
KYLE
[realizing where the ballots could be] Oh my God.
[Stevenson's Hummer, day. A diner leaves Café Monet and walks down the street.]
MR. STEVENSON
[the salesman] Hey, looking for a Hummer today? Got some 2009s here. Never been driven. ...Ever. [a crow lands on a blue Hummer. Mr. Stevenson notices, turns around and moves towards it] Go on, get out of here! Shoo! [the crow leaves as Kyle and friends show up and enter the lot]
KYLE
Look! There they are!
MR. STEVENSON
Hey, hi there! You kids like Hummers, huh? Let me show you these babies!
KYLE
We found it, you guys! [hears some vehicles showing up and looks] Oh no, they followed us! [several black cars pull up and the Chinese pour out of them]
MR. STEVENSON
Oh hell yes! Asians! Hey guys!
GENERAL TSO
Get out of our way!
KYLE
No! These don't belong to you! They belong to the people!
GENERAL TSO
[pulls out a pistol from his pocket and aims it at Kyle] I am tired of playing games! This little farce is ovah! [a shot from a ray gun obliterates the pistol]
CARTMAN
[on a tauntaun] I don't think so, General Tso! This way, officers! [police cars show up]
MR. STEVENSON
Oh my God it's a sales rush! [the police pour out of their cars]
OFFICER 2
Oh my God. Are those what I think they are?
CARTMAN
Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle?
OFFICER 3
Sir, we've found something, at the Hummer sales lot outside of town.
GENERAL TSO
You don't understand. We are trying to protect the greatest film series ever made!
KYLE
Protect it?
OFFICER 4
What the hell is going on here?!
MORGAN FREEMAN
[voice only. The officers all face him] Perhaps I can explain it to you. [appears between the Hummers and walks up to the group] You see, it turns out the only reason the Chinese so desperately wanted Star Wars is because they're afraid that Disney might not be the right place for it. The Chinese simply want to guard Star Wars impeccable legacy.
OFFICER 5
Is that Morgan Freeman?
MORGAN FREEMAN
And now we're at a crossroads. If these ballots are made public, then the man the people voted for will be President, but he will no doubt keep Star Wars from the Chinese, and allow Disney to keep it instead. And so we have to ask ourselves, "What's more important? That the right man is elected President, or that Star Wars is with people who will protect it most?" [six new freckles appear on his face, and he caresses his right cheek]
AN OFFICER
[through a walkie-talkie] Unit 4, what is it?! Over.
OFFICER 1
Well kid?
KYLE
Well... if you put it that way...
AN OFFICER
Come in Unit 4! What have you found?!
OFFICER 1
Nothing sir. We just found some tremendous deals on cars nobody wants, that's all. Barkley out. [Stan walks up to the ballots with a match, strikes the match against the asphalt and lights it, and sets fire to the ballots]
CARTMAN
No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?! [the Chinese, the police officers, and the boys all hold hands around the bonfire and begin to chant]
GROUP
Obama is President again. [as the smoke gathers in the sky, a real-life image of President Obama appears and sways slowly back and forth.]
End of Obama Wins!
