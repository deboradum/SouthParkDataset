script:With Apologies to Jesse Jackson

[Wheel of Fortune. The graphics roll by]
ANNOUNCER
And now back to Wheel of Fortune!
[The camera closes in on Randy, who's got his hands clenched, his thumbs up, and a big grin on his face. He pumps his fists softly. A new car waits behind him to win it]
PAT SAJAK
All right, Randy, congratulations on making it all the way to the bonus round!
RANDY
Thanks, Pat!
PAT SAJAK
You've got some family here watching tonight. [a shot of Sharon, Shelly, and Stan in the audience. Sharon waves, then claps. Stan waves]
RANDY
Yeah, they're all rooting for me. [waving back to his family]
PAT SAJAK
And I'm sure you have lots of friends watching back home?
[The town bar. A crowd has gathered to watch the show. Kyle and Ike are there with their parents, Butters is there with his]
RANDY
Yeah. [waving] Hi, everybody watching in South Park!
JIMBO
That's us!
STEPHEN
Hehey! [both thumbs up]
MAN 1
[amid other chatter, voice only] Hey Randy!
JIMBO
Good luck!
[Back to the studio.]
PAT SAJAK
Well let's see if you can't make everyone proud. The category is [the words appear onscreen as Vanna White gets ready to turn the letters on the board] People Who Annoy You.
RANDY
Okay. [deep exhale]
PAT SAJAK
As always, we give you the letters R, T, S, L, and E. [Some of the letters light up blue and Vanna taps on them: ERS] We just need three more consonants, and a vowel.
RANDY
Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G.
PAT SAJAK
And a vowel?
RANDY
[quickly crosses his fingers in both hands and grits his teeth] An O please.
PAT SAJAK
Okay, well, looks like you're gonna get a lot of help here. [more letters light up blue and Vanna taps on them. Randy claps softly] The category is People Who Annoy You. [the letters are NGG, but no O: N_GGERS. Randy stops clapping] Audience, keep quiet, please. [the white people in the audience are shocked and terrified while the black people are angry and glaring at Randy. One of the cameramen peeks out from behind the camera - he's black]
RANDY
Uh... Well, uh...
PAT SAJAK
Ten seconds, Mr. Marsh.
RANDY
I know it but I don't think I should say it.
PAT SAJAK
Five seconds, Mr. Marsh.
RANDY
Oh all right uh, I'd like to solve the puzzle! [beat] N***ers! [the audience is stone quiet. Randy gets the buzzer for the wrong answer and drops his arms.] Huh? [Vanna goes to turn the last letter around - A - then walks back to her post and looks at the ground] Ohhh...
STAN
[covers his eyes] Ooooh. [Sharon and Shelly are stunned]
RANDY
[subdued] Oh naggers. Of course, naggers. [sheepish grin] Right.
PAT SAJAK
[awkwardly] Uhh, can we cut to a... [back at the bar in South Park] Can we cut to a- [the station goes off the air. The bar patrons are confused]
[On the road back home. Stan still has his hand over his eyes. Sharon has her eyes closed and her head in her right hand]
RANDY
[sniffs, then] Well, gave it my best shot. Least we had a fun trip, huh, gang?
SHARON
I can't believe you said the N-word on national television!
RANDY
Wha?! Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money.
[South Park Elementary, morning. The kids arrive at school.]
[South Park Elementary hallway. Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny walk into view.]
KYLE
Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?
CARTMAN
Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen! I watched it on YouTube about sixty times!
STAN
Can we just drop this, please? I don't wanna talk about it!
CARTMAN
Yeah, well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Tolkien. [points at the camera. Dramatic music swells. The camera then looks at Tolkien, who's putting some books into his locker] He is gonna wanna kick your cracker teeth in.
STAN
No, he's not. [looks at Kyle] Is he?
KYLE
I don't know.
STAN
I just need to explain things. [walks up to Tolkien, who's finished with the locker and holds only a binder in his right hand] Hey Token. Look, I don't know if you saw Wheel of Fortune last night, but-
TOLKIEN
Yeah, I was watching with my whole family. And then we saw all the replays this morning on the news.
STAN
Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay?
TOLKIEN
Uh, well, actually it is kind of a big deal, Stan.
CARTMAN
Ohhhhhhhh?
TOLKIEN
It may be a mistake, but you don't understand how it feels when that word comes up. So don't say it isn't a big deal.
CARTMAN
Oh, shit, here we go! [gets really excited and cuts in between them, yelling] It's on! Race war! [goes back and yells at one end of the hall] Race war! Race war! [comes back again and yells at the other end of the hall] Race war is on, everybody! It's going down! Shit is going down! [returns, just itching to see Stan and Tolkien fight]
STAN
Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it.
TOLKIEN
That's easy for you to say, Stan.
CARTMAN
[softly] Yeah, come on! Here we go!
STAN
Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that.
TOLKIEN
That doesn't mean I can just be fine.
CARTMAN
[softly] Race war! Come on! Race war!
TOLKIEN
If you really think it's not a big deal, then you really are ignorant. That's all. I'm not fighting anybody. [turns left and walks away]
CARTMAN
Tolkien forfeits! [takes Stan's left hand and holds it up in victory] Whites win! [lets go and twirls away] Whites win! [runs to one end of the hall] Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again!
[In an office somewhere, day.]
RANDY
I want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the N-word on Wheel of Fortune. And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson. [The camera shows Jesse Jackson behind a desk, with three officials around him]
JESSE JACKSON
[elbows on armrests, hands interlaced] The puzzle you were solving was "people who annoy you".
RANDY
Uh well, like anybody else thought it was "naggers". I mean, right?
JESSE JACKSON
Mr. Marsh, you need to take time to understand African-American culture, visit black museums, see black performers and artists.
RANDY
Oh! Ah I will! I'm really down with [making sure he gets it right] African-Americans.
JESSE JACKSON
[thinks a moment] Do you really want to apologize? Are you sure?
RANDY
Y-Yes, absolutely.
JESSE JACKSON
[long exhale] Very well. If you want to apologize, I will accept. [rises from his chair and approaches Randy]
RANDY
Hahh, thank you, Mr. Jackson, thank you.
JESSE JACKSON
Brian, get a picture of Mr. Marsh apologizing. [takes off his coat, rolls up his shirt sleeves...]
BRIAN
[with camera] Ready to go, sir.
JESSE JACKSON
[...unzips and drops his pants, then drops his briefs and sticks his ass out at Randy] Kiss it.
RANDY
Huh?
JESSE JACKSON
Apologize. Kiss it.
RANDY
You want me to kiss your-
JESSE JACKSON
That's right. [gyrates his butt around] Apologize.
RANDY
Agh, oh, okay. I'll ahh... [genuflects] Let's see here uh...
JESSE JACKSON
[gyrates his butt around again] Apologize. [Randy kisses Jesse's ass for a few seconds and the picture is taken. It appears in newspapers like the New York News]
[South Park Elementary, day, hallway. The bell rings and Stan approaches Tolkien at his locker.]
STAN
Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson.
TOLKIEN
Oh I see, so I'm supposed to feel all better now.
STAN
Well, yeah.
TOLKIEN
[throws his backpack into the locker] You just don't get it, Stan!
STAN
Dude, Jesse Jackson said it's okay!
TOLKIEN
[spins around angrily] Jesse Jackson, is not the emperor, of black people! [storms away]
STAN
[softly] He told my dad he was...
[The school gym, later. All the students have been called to assemble there.]
WOMAN
[dressed in a sharp business suit] Today we are going to have a guest speaker talk to us about sensitivity and the power of words. [Stan looks over at Tolkien in the row before him] In a moment you will meet Dr. David Nelson, who has first-hand experience in overcoming slander, because David is himself, a little person. Who knows what a little person is? [Butters raises his hand] Yes? Over here?
BUTTERS
A midget?
WOMAN
Not exactly. That term is actually considered offensive, and that's why Dr. Nelson goes from school to school getting us all to think about what we say. He has two PhD.'s and has published six books! Please welcome David Nelson!
MR. NELSON
[waddles in to some fanfare, swaying back and forth] Good morning, students! How are we all feeling today? [the music stops. Cartman chuckles, then lets out a laugh, and can't stop] I would like to share with you all my-
CARTMAN
No! Dude! No fucking way! [laughs] Dude! [resumes laughing]
MR. NELSON
That, that words are like bullets. And if you give-
CARTMAN
[shakes his head back and forth, then rears back, laughing all the while] Stop! Stop! Stop! Stohahahahahahaha...
MR. MACKEY
[appears next to Mr. Nelson] Eric, be quiet!
MR. NELSON
No, no, it's okay. He'll run out of steam here pretty soon. [Cartman continues laughing, and even nudges Stan a few times to get him to laugh, but Stan just gets annoyed.]
CARTMAN
Look! Look look, look. They put a little suit on him. [resumes laughing. Mr. Nelson gets pissed off, but holds it in]
[A comedy club - The Laugh Factory. Randy is walking down the street and notices the club]
RANDY
Ooh! An African-American performer at the comedy club. [rushes over]
[Inside the club an African-American is doing his routine]
COMEDIAN
And so I said to my wife, "You told me to kill the damned cockroach! Don't yell at me for making a mess!" [the audience laughs. Randy is in the audience, laughing] We've got a great crowd here tonight. Now, how many people here are actually from Colorado? [a few audience members and Randy clap and holler] Ya got nothin' better to do on a Friday night than to go to a comedy club, huh? [that gets a big laugh from the crowd. The comedian points to Randy] Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? [the crowd falls silent, and Randy looks uncomfortable] Yeah. I know you. You're the guy that said "n***a" on Wheel of Fortune. [the audience laughs. Randy lets out a weak chuckle] Look! Everybody! It's the ""n***a" guy. [big laughs all around]
MAN 2
Hey, it is him.
COMEDIAN
Oh, we got a star in the club. Everyone wave to the "n***a" guy. [waves, and the audience waves with him] Say, "Hi, "n***a" guy!"
AUDIENCE
Hi, "n***er" guy! [Randy waves back and now has a guilty smile on his face, which quickly changes to a guilty frown]
COMEDIAN
That's alright, "n***a" guy. You know we just playin'. [the crowd roars with laughter and claps]
RANDY
Yeah... No problem...
COMEDIAN
Have you all seen these navigation systems in these cars these days? Damn things look like they're right out of "Far Out Space Nuts". Maybe "n***a" guy has one. You got one, "n***a" guy? [the audience roars with laughter again and Randy leaves, his head hung in shame. He wanders the streets]
[A run-down part of the city, night.]
MAN 3
[walks by with a woman] Hey look, Betty. It's that "n***er" guy. [Randy sighs and walks on]
THREE KIDS
[passing by on skateboards] N***er guy. N***er guy. [they leave, Randy sighs again and walks on. He stops by a 24-hour store to get some aspirin]
CLERK
[white] Hey. What do you think you're doing? [an Asian clerk stands behind him]
RANDY
I just... need some aspirin.
CLERK
You aren't welcome in this store, "n***er" guy.
RANDY
Fine! [leaves the aspirin on the counter and rushes out the door]
[South Park Elementary, day, principal's office. Mr. Nelson is there to lodge a complaint. Principal Victoria sits at her desk, Mr. Mackey stands to her left.]
MR. NELSON
Principal Victoria, I am very concerned about the behavior of one of your students.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Yes, we apologize for Eric Cartman's behavior, Mr. Nelson. We feel terrible.
MR. NELSON
Why? I don't feel terrible. It doesn't bother me at all. [waddles to his left] Words are like bullets, and I let 'em pass right through me. [waddles back] I just know that with some one-on-one time together with this Eric Cartman, I have a chance to change the way he thinks.
MR. MACKEY
Uh, it might be best if you just ...let it go, m'kay?
MR. NELSON
You don't understand. [waddles around] You see, words are like bullets. And if you take away the gunpowder-
MR. MACKEY
Yeah yeah, we we get it, Mr. Nelson.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Very well, Mr. Nelson. [presses a button on her phone] Stacey, go ahead and send in Eric Cartman. [the door opens and Cartman walks in and immediately bursts into laughter upon seeing Mr. Nelson.] Eric, Mr. Nelson is concerned about how you respond to little people.
CARTMAN
[stops long enough to respond] Oh. Did I hurt its little feelings? [resumes laughing]
MR. NELSON
You know, you think you have the power to make me insecure, but your words are actually completely powerless.
CARTMAN
[before Mr. Nelson finishes talking] Oh oh oh oh! If we could get, like, eight of these, we could dress them all up like little beavers, right, and then put 'em in a pond, and see if they build a dam! [stomps his foot on the floor, points to Mr. Nelson, and laughs. Principal Victoria buries her face in her hands]
MR. NELSON
You see? No matter what you say, I'm still standing.
CARTMAN
[stops] Barely! [starts up again]
MR. NELSON
[assertively] No matter how you act, I can rise above it!
CARTMAN
[stops] "Rise above it!" Get it? [starts up again]
MR. NELSON
[steps up to Cartman] Shut your fucking mouth!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Mr. Nelson! [Mr. Nelson blanches. Cartman looks at him, then cracks up again and falls on his ass in laughter]
MR. NELSON
He, he, he didn't get to me. I was I was just I wast just joking
CARTMAN
Look, look how its face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry!
MR. NELSON
[grimaces] Aaaaaaa!
[South Park, night, Viggo's Coffee House. A sign outside announces "SPOKEN WORD CONTEST TONIGHT," Inside, a pair of black hands drums away on some bongo drums. Next, Randy is shown onstage, the drummer in the background]
RANDY
Words with venom, words that bind. Words used like weapons to cloud my mind. I'm a person. I'm a man. But no matter how I try, people just say "Hey! There's that "n***er" guy." [no response from the crowd] Everywhere I go, it's always the same. Everyone just thinks of me as that one single name. "Hey N***er Guy! N***er Guy! Hi N***er Guy!" Stop! Now go. Call me N***er Guy! Fill me with your hate! Try to bring me down- Oop up, you're too late. When will it end, will there ever be a time? When I can be thought of as more... than just "N***er Guy". [no response from the crowd] Respect. [throws up the V sign and walks off stage]
[South Park Elementary, day, hallway. Stan walks up to Tolkien again]
STAN
Token! Hey, wait up. [Tolkien turns around] I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that "little person" talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N-word.
TOLKIEN
Sooo black people are midgets? [turns around and walks away. At the far end of the hallway Mr. Nelson rounds the corner and walks towards Stan.]
STAN
Goddamn it!
MR. NELSON
Excuse me, over here, please? All right, I need all students to join me over here. [heads towards the gym. The available students follow him]
[The gym. Only the fourth graders are there]
MR. NELSON
I have called you here because it is time that we taught Eric Cartman a lesson once and for all! In a few seconds, Eric will be sent in, and when we walks through that door, I want you all at the same time to yell, "Hello, fatso!"
CRAIG
...I don't think that's a very good idea, sir.
MR. NELSON
He has to learn his lesson! You see, words are like bullets. [turns around and sees Cartman] All right all right, here he comes. [walks off-screen. Cartman enters the gym]
KIDS
"Hello, fatso!"
CARTMAN
Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's fuckin' funny?! [walks up to Kyle accusingly] Kyle, did you put everybody up to this?! [Mr. Nelson walks out towards the entrance, then curves around to stand behind Cartman] I bet you did! What the hell is going on?!
MR. NELSON
Now you know how it feels. [Cartman turns around and looks at him, then bursts out laughing] You'd better shut up or i'm gonna kick your ass!
CARTMAN
Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed it up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha!
[A conference hall, somewhere. Randy speaks before an entire group made up of only black people.]
RANDY
And so it is my honor to announce today the Randy Marsh African-American Scholarship Foundation. [gets good applause for that] It is my hope that this foundation will prove my commitment to the education of African-American students and erase once and for all my identity as the "n***er" guy. [no response] You really... you really don't know how hard it is to be constantly reminded of something lame that happened in your past. I mean I... just wanna move on from what happened on "Wheel of Fortune", you know and... and when people call me... "n***er guy"... they're bringing up a painful chapter of my history and all the negativity that went along with it. You just... you can't imagine how that feels. [no response]
BLACK MAN
Is this "n***a" guy serious?
RANDY
Anyway, here's to a new start for us all. Thank you! [walks off.]
[Outside, night. He walks towards his car when a truck passes by. It screeches to a halt and backs up to stop in front of Randy. Two rednecks are in the cab, a third is in the bed]
DRIVER
Thar look Skeeter! That's that guy from the TV!
SKEETER
[the redneck in the cab] Well well well, looks like we got ourselves a n***er guy! [reaches down and grabs a shotgun. Randy takes off running.]
RANDY
Awww! Awwww! [the rednecks give chase. Skeeter just shoots in the air, aiming at no one]
SKEETER
Yee haw! Yiiip yip yip yip yip yip.
PASSENGER
Wooo! [pumps his left fist]
RANDY
Whoa! [sees a clearing across the street and runs into it. The truck passes it, screeches to a halt, and backs up. Randy turns around and sees the three rednecks standing before him, shotguns aimed at him]
SKEETER
Where you goin', "n***er" guy?
RANDY
Please I, I don't want any trouble.
SKEETER
Well you got trouble, when you first decided to slander an entire race of people on "Wheel of Fortune"!
DRIVER
Yeah. You like making fun of minorities, "n***er" guy? Huh we don't take kindly to social ignorance.
PASSENGER
You tell 'im, Skeeter, you tell 'im!
RANDY
[holds his hands out in a blocking position] What do you want?
SKEETER
What do we want? [he and the passenger laugh] We want to live in a world without people like you who are intolerant of African-Americans!
MAN 4
[from screen left, out of nowhere] Leave him alone.
PASSENGER
Hey... That's that other "n***er" guy.
SKEETER
Huh?
PASSENGER
That's the guy from Seinfeld, used the N-word a whole bunch o' times.
DRIVER
Michael Richards? Well, son of a bitch!
SKEETER
Looks like it's our lucky day! We done got us two "n***er" guys!
MAN 5
[from screen right] Make that three.
PASSENGER
Mark Fuhrman?
SKEETER
Who?
PASSENGER
He done said the N-word in the O.J. case.
DRIVER
Well what is this? A "n***er" guy convention? [two more men appear beside Randy, Richards and Fuhrman]
RICHARDS
We aren't being pushed around anymore. Leave.
DRIVER
Come on, Skeeter. [he and the other rednecks back up towards their truck] These "n***er" guys ain't worth our trouble.
SKEETER
[from the truck bed] Damn "n***er" guys! [the other two get into the cab] We'll be back! [the truck starts up and the rednecks hoot and holler and fire off their weapons as they speed away]
RICHARDS
[puts his hands on Randy's right shoulder] You'd better come with us.
[An abandoned barn nearby, moments later. The five men go in]
RICHARDS
Come on in, Mr. Marsh. We'll make you some coffee.
RANDY
What's going on here?
FUHRMAN
[pours Randy a cup of coffee and gives it to him] We've been following your story since we first saw it on the news. Don't worry - you're with friends now. Dale here used the N-word in a racial joke at work. Scott used the plural N-word to refer to a group of gardeners who broke his fence.
SCOTT
They were Mexicans. I was being ironic.
RICHARDS
We're all just like you.
RANDY
No. [smacks Richards' hand off his shoulder and puts the cup down] No no, I'm sorry, but I'm not... like you. I just said the N-word by mistake to win money.
RICHARDS
I made a mistake too. [moves forward a bit] I was trying to be funny! I got frustrated and thought I would get some shock laughs. I'm just... not that good of a comedian if you want to know the real truth.
RANDY
You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did!
RICHARDS
[turns around and gets in Randy's face] You really think that matters?! [moves to Randy's ear] You really think all those people out there see a difference? Oh, they might say your racial slur was more accidental; they might even laugh about it. But at the end of the day, all you are to them is just another damn "n***er" guy! [Randy swallows a bit] Oh, you don't like that, do ya?
RANDY
No.
FUHRMAN
Randy, we want you to join us. We have a plan to make this all go away once and for all.
[South Park, day, the neighborhood.]
STAN
Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!
TOLKIEN
I have every reason to be mad! You just don't get it!
STAN
I'm not responsible for what my dad did!
TOLKIEN
No, but you can't just pretend it never happened either!
STAN
What the hell do you want from me?! [Butters appears across the street, rather out of breath. Upon seeing them, he runs over]
TOLKIEN
Nothing!
STAN
Then stop being mad!
TOLKIEN
No!
BUTTERS
Fellas! Fellas come quick! Cartman's gonna fight the midget! [Butters runs off. Stan and Tolkien look at each other silently then shrug, as they turn to follow Butters]
[The community park. The kids have gathered to see Cartman and Mr. Nelson fight.]
BUTTERS
C'mon now Eric, come on now.
KYLE
Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.
CARTMAN
It's a midget, dude.
MR. NELSON
["Down with the Sickness" by Disturbed starts playing] Students, I am going to beat the crap out of this kid to prove a point.
CARTMAN
Hahaha, no- no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much. [the kids urge them to fight, and the match begins]
[Cartman gets Mr. Nelson ...in a half-Nelson, then picks him up, carries him around 360 degrees, then throws him off. Mr. Nelson gets under Cartman to pick him up and throw him over his back, but ends up just tickling Cartman, and Cartman laughs.]
[The United State Senate. Randy is addressing the senators.]
RANDY
Senators, I know it is not normally considered "American" to ban words. [Randy is flanked by Fuhrman and Richards] But there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal. I'm talking, of course, about the term "n***er guy".
SENATOR 1
"N***er guy"?
RANDY
Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate.
RICHARDS
Yeah! That's right!
RANDY
Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a n***er guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence.
SKEETER
[with his two friends] Goddamn n***er guy's tryin' to be all political-like now!
RANDY
Senators, I've learned to admit that I'm capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while. Can anybody say they never do? How long will it be before you are all called "n***er guys"? [the senators are somewhat shocked]
SENATOR 2
Uhhh, hold on a second, are you suggesting that "n***er guy" could become a slur that refers to all white people?
SENATOR 3
I'm certainly not a n***er guy. I've never thought a racist thought.
SENATOR 4
[black senator] Aw, come on, you're the biggest n***er guy in Washington.
SENATOR 1
Mr. Marsh, we see now the importance of your bill. [raises his left hand] All those in favor to ban the term "n***er guy"?
MOST SENATORS
Aye!
SENATOR 1
Opposed?
SENATOR 4
[a lone black senator] Nay?
SENATOR 1
The motion is passed! [lowers the gavel.]
[Outside the Senate building, supporters of the bill celebrate with confetti and streamers. Randy walks out and across the lawn with Richards and Fuhrman.]
RANDY
We did it!
FIELD REPORTER
For the first time in American history, a word has been officially banned from use.
SENATOR 3
From now on, if a person uses the word "n***er," it must be at least seven words away from the word "guy." [a group of black people is shown, not reacting in any way to the announcement. Everyone else continues cheering.]
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, it appears that the "n***er" guy epidemic is ove- [two police officers come and take him away] Oh damn it. I said it, didn't I?
[Back at the community park Cartman and Mr. Nelson continue wrestling. Cartman has beat Mr. Nelson up pretty good and now has him pinned to the ground.]
MR. NELSON
AAAA! Ow! Ow! Okay! [Cartman punches him in the face a few times] Okay, you win!
CARTMAN
Say "Uncle!"
MR. NELSON
Ung-cle!
CARTMAN
Hahaha, now say "Carol Anne, don't go into the light!"
MR. NELSON
Carol Anne, don't go into the light!
CARTMAN
Haaha, hahahahahaha! Oh man, that is hysterical! [Mr. Nelson rises and pummels him in the back of the head. Cartman falls forward] Oh!
MR. NELSON
There! Now you all see that I am not limited by my size. [Cartman comes alive again and laughs] I have proven my point! My work here is done! [waddles away. The kids begin to disperse]
STAN
What was his point?
KYLE
I have no idea.
STAN
Dude, I don't get it.
KYLE
I don't get it either.
STAN
[comes to a certain realization] Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it.
KYLE
...Huh?
STAN
Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it! [smiles, then walks up to Tolkien] Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it.
TOLKIEN
Now you get it, Stan. [smiles]
STAN
[smiles] Yeah. I totally don't get it.
TOLKIEN
Thanks, dude.
End of With Apologies to Jesse Jackson

synopsis:Cartman invites Butters over for the night and plans to do disgusting things to him in his sleep. However, when he photographs Butters' penis in his mouth, there are drastic consequences for both boys.

script:Cartman Sucks

[A scrapbook shot of Butters sleeping, with a poo mustache on his face.]
CARTMAN
This picture I like to call "The Pierre". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha. [the caption reads "THE PIERRE 3/10/07." Cartman flips the page. The pages are artsy in design] And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth. [Yep, the tampon is in there like a thermometer] I call this picture "The Sleeping Menstrual". [the caption is shown, Cartman flips the page. Kyle, Stan, and Kenny stand around him, looking at the pictures. They're all in Cartman's room.] This one, I call "Hot Fudge Mondae". [caresses the picture] I really like how the light plays with the background on this one.
KYLE
Is this all you brought us here to see?
CARTMAN
Oh no, there's much more. [flips the page] Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it "New Moon Rising". [a shot of Cartman hanging his ass over Butters' face] I did a whole study using my ass. [Cartman's ass over Butters' face from the left side] Here it is using some high-contrast stuff. [next, Cartman wearing darker pajamas, mooning Butters] trying out some... different light filters here. [last shot looks faded, with Cartman's ass directly on Butters' face.] But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass.
KYLE
Butters is staying over tonight?
CARTMAN
Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-
BUTTERS
[appears at Cartman's bedroom door] Hey, fellas! [Stan and Kenny turn around. Kyle looks over his left shoulder]
CARTMAN
Heh! [quickly puts away his scrapbook] Oh, oh hey, Butters! [turns around and greets him] I wasn't expecting you so soon.
BUTTERS
Yeah. [puts down his sleeping bag] I finished my chores so I came over a little early. [Cartman takes the sleeping bag and sets it aside. Butters notices the other guys] Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?
CARTMAN
[returns] No no, these guys were just leaving. [faces the other guys menacingly] Weren't you guys?
STAN
Come on, let's go. [leads Kyle and Kenny out the door.]
KYLE
[stops] Wait, wai- I can't let this happen. [turns around] Butters.
BUTTERS
Yeah Kyle?
KYLE
Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?
CARTMAN
Kyyyle!
BUTTERS
Uh what do you mean?
KYLE
I mean, that if-
CARTMAN
What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.
BUTTERS
Heh yeah, grow up, Kyle.
KYLE
[angered] Hrrugh! [leaves]
BUTTERS
So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?
CARTMAN
Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.
BUTTERS
But, uh-ih-it's only 6:30.
CARTMAN
Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.
[South Park, morning. The boys walk up to the bus stop. Cartman isn't with them.]
CARTMAN
[off screen] You guys! I got it! [runs in and joins them] It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God!
STAN
What'cha do to Butters this time?
CARTMAN
It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! [cracks up at his own cleverness]
KYLE
Dude!
CARTMAN
I know I know, check it out, look. [the other three crowd in and look at the picture] I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good!
STAN
Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?
CARTMAN
Because that makes Butters gay now!
KYLE
No dude, that makes you gay!
CARTMAN
Eh- ...what?
KYLE
You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!
CARTMAN
[looks more closely at the picture] Nuh uh.
KYLE
Yeah huh!
CARTMAN
Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?
KENNY
(Ehe, that makes you very fucking gay.)
CARTMAN
But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!
STAN
You are now.
CARTMAN
No, no, it was a stupid mistake!
KYLE
Doesn't matter. You're gay now.
CARTMAN
No, it was just for a second! [seeing that his plan has backfired, he puts the picture away] What, what can I do? How-how can I reverse this?
STAN
You can't!
KYLE
No-no wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.
CARTMAN
How?
KYLE
The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.
CARTMAN
[low voice] Really?
KYLE
Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.
CARTMAN
[beat] ...Shit, I gotta find Butters! [runs off]
KYLE
[beat] ...Idiot.
[Butters' bedroom, several minutes later. Butters is playing with his toys - a car, a truck, and a small action figure.]
BUTTERS
[singing] Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you... [continues howling the tune]
CARTMAN
[enters the room] Butters.
BUTTERS
[stops playing and gets up] Whoa, hey Eric.
CARTMAN
Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you.
BUTTERS
[a little excited] A surprise? What is it?
CARTMAN
It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be so stoked. It's the best surprise ever!
BUTTERS
[really excited] Oh boy!
CARTMAN
You ready?
BUTTERS
Y-yeah!
CARTMAN
Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees!
BUTTERS
[closes his eyes, opens his mouth, and gets on his knees] Oh, okay! [Cartman grabs a handkerchief from his back pocket and makes a blindfold from it, then puts it on Butters]
CARTMAN
Hang on a second here. [makes sure the blindfold is on snugly]
BUTTERS
How come uh, I can't see?
CARTMAN
'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it? [rushes off to get the toybox]
BUTTERS
Oh uh, ho yeah.
CARTMAN
[under his breath] All right, that's good. [undoes his pants] Okay, open your mouth, Butters? [lowers them and ...] That's good, just like that.
BUTTERS
[wary all of a sudden] Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya?
CARTMAN
...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth. [lifts up his shirt to show his massive gut]
BUTTERS
Well okay!
CARTMAN
All right, you ready? [grabs Butters' head and draws it closer to his own wiener] All right just- okay, open uh- okay, okay, here it comes. Just sit very still, okay? Here we go. [at that moment the door opens and Stephen enters.]
STEPHEN
Butters!
CARTMAN
Uh! [quickly gets dressed up]
BUTTERS
Whoa! Hey Dad! [Cartman steps down from the toy-box and runs away]
STEPHEN
Butters! What are you doing?!
BUTTERS
I'm getting a surprise! [points to his mouth]
STEPHEN
Oh my God! My, my only son, reduced to this! [takes off the blindfold]
BUTTERS
[looks around] Hey. Where'd Eric go?
STEPHEN
[quite concerned, on bended knee] Butters, how long have you been doing stuff like this?
BUTTERS
Like what?
STEPHEN
Don't lie to me, Butters! I know your secret now! No wait, wait. It's okay. It's okay, Butters. This isn't a serious problem. You're just bi-curious.
BUTTERS
What's... bi-curious?
STEPHEN
You are. Just harmless curiosity, and it doesn't mean anything. We just need to get you some help, Butters. [Linda appears at the doorway]
LINDA
What's going on, you two?
BUTTERS
Nothin' Mom, I'm just a little bi-curious. [smiles]
[South Park Church, day. Butters and Stephen are in the rectory.]
STEPHEN
Father Maxi, I... just don't know where else to turn. You see, I've just learned that my son is... bi-curious.
FATHER MAXI
Is that true, son? Are you feeling... confused?
BUTTERS
...Yeah, I'm pretty confused alright.
STEPHEN
You see?
FATHER MAXI
Young man, These confused feelings that you're having are simply the Devil's way of trying to get a hold of you.
BUTTERS
Really?
STEPHEN
What can I do, Father?
FATHER MAXI
There is a special camp where young men who are confused, like your son, can go and be cleansed by the power of God. Many bi-curious boys come out the camp completely cured.
STEPHEN
A secluded camp where lots of bi-curious boys are all put together? That sounds like a good idea.
BUTTERS
Whoa boy! Camp!
[Stan's living room. He, Kyle, and Kenny are playing a board game, Living. A door opens and closes, and Cartman appears.]
CARTMAN
Haahaahahaha! [crosses his arms] Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!
KYLE
What are you talking about, fatass?
CARTMAN
[uncrosses his arms] I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!
KYLE
You figured that out, huh?
CARTMAN
[crosses his arms again as he turns away] That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay! All I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know. [pleased with himself]
KYLE
Except for us.
CARTMAN
Right, except for you.
KYLE
And all the people we tell.
CARTMAN
[turns around] Why would you tell anybody?
STAN
Because it's really, really funny.
CARTMAN
...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier.
KYLE
Like what?
CARTMAN
Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch. [grins, but Stan and Kyle ignore him] Liiike, a, a dog crap... on, on a guy's face! [chuckles]
STAN
That isn't funny.
CARTMAN
[angrily] Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody!
KYLE
Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.
CARTMAN
Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys! [the other boys continue playing. Cartman changes tactics: he pleads] You guys, please don't tell anybody.
KYLE
Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.
CARTMAN
Oh right, like that's possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle. [turns around and cackles] Haha, hahahaha! [leaves the house]
[Camp New Grace entrance, night. Stephen pulls up with Butters, and some campers and camp staffers come out to greet them. Butters hops out of the passenger side, dressed in shirt and tie. Stephen goes to the trunk to bring out a suitcase.]
LEADER
Everyone, say hello to our new camper, Butters.
CAMPERS
Hi Butters. Hello. Hi. Hello Butters.
STEPHEN
[brings the suitcase to an elder staffer] Thank you so much for taking him in.
DIRECTOR
Don't worry. Your son just needs to learn that he can be straight if he chooses to be.
[Camp New Grace interior, night. The camp director is showing Butters around.]
DIRECTOR
Do you know why you're here at camp, Butters?
BUTTERS
Because I'm bi-curious?
DIRECTOR
That's right. Like all the campers here, you're confused, and you don't think there's a way out. But even though some people would have you believe you can't control how you feel, the truth is that with the power of Jesus Christ you can be normal. Now, just to make sure you don't slip up while in camp we assign every camper an accountabilibuddy. [they approach a room] Let's meet Ryan, your accountabilibuddy. [Room 22] Ryan thought he could never change. But now he's learning that with the power of Christ and prayer, he can have a whole new life. [the door opens, and a boy is shown hanging from a noose in the middle of his room. The stool and book he stood on are fallen on the floor. The director quickly closes the door and continues the tour] Over this way we have the cafeteria. All the meals are served there. [notices another boy in front of them] Uh Bradley! How about you be Butters' accountabilibuddy?
BRADLEY
Humble yourselves therefore under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up. - Peter 5:6
DIRECTOR
Butters here is new to the camp. He's chosen to rid himself of his affliction and forge a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
BUTTERS
I'm bi-curious.
BRADLEY
Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman: that is detestable. - Leviticus 18:22.
DIRECTOR
That's right, Bradley. I think we're well on our way to being healed. [(a boy has hanged himself) whispers softly to a staffer as the staffer walks by] We've got another one: Room 22.
STAFFER
Aw, darnit!
[Community park, dusk. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are taking turns shooting the basketball at the hoop. Stan shoots and misses]
STAN
Aw man, I've got H O R S now. [steps aside as Kenny receives the ball.]
KYLE
Okay, my turn. [Kenny gives him the ball and Kyle prepares to shoot. Cartman approaches the park behind him]
CARTMAN
Where is it, you filthy Jew?!
KYLE
[throws up the ball] Where's what?
CARTMAN
[grabs Kyle by the collar and shakes him violently] You know God damned well what!
KYLE
Let go of me.
STAN
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
CARTMAN
I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone! [shakes Kyle again] What did you do with my picture?!
KYLE
Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture.
CARTMAN
[rolls up his sleeves] Give it back, Kyle!
KYLE
I don't have it.
CARTMAN
I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now, [puts up his fists as if to box] I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here.
KYLE
Shut up.
CARTMAN
You shut up! You're lying, and [points an accusing finger at Stan and Kenny] you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews! [Kyle punches him on the right arm once, firmly] OW! [puts his left hand over his right arm] OW! AAAAUH! [grimaces, turns around, and runs out of the park] NYAAAAAAAAAA!
[Camp New Grace, chapel, day. Kids of every age are there singing in unison.]
CAMPERS
The Lord is love this for
With Jesus I can just say no
And not be confused anymore.
DIRECTOR
We will now hear a sermon from Pastor Phillips. For those of you who are new to camp, Pastor Phillips is somebody who has broken free of the bonds that afflict you.
BUTTERS
He's bi-curious too?
DIRECTOR
Not anymore. Because Pastor Phillips prayed, and by the hand of Jesus Christ, he's now completely cured! Let's hear it for Pastor Phillips, kids!
PASTOR PHILLIPS
[flies onto the stage and prances about speaking flamboyantly] Helloooo campers! [twirls some and strikes a pose] Yeth, believe it or not, I mythelf used to have unclean urges, and like a lot of you, I thought I was just made that way, that I didn't have a choice. But then I realized that God didn't want me to be that way! God wanted me to be a man! [strikes a running pose] So I buckled up in my little suit and I prayed to be normal and guess what? [jumps up into the air and does a 1080] It worrrrked! [strikes another pose, then eases up]
DIRECTOR
That's right, kids. You see, right now you're like a paper clip. [pulls on out of his back pocket] And just like a paper clip, [begins to mess with it] God needs to bend you, and shape you, and make youuuu... straight. [presents the straightened paper clip. A Latino boy pulls out a gun, shoots himself through the temple, and goes down. Butters is startled. The director and Pastor Phillips just stand there.]
[Park County Police Station, South Park Division, day.]
DET. YATES
So you say you were robbed. [fills out a police report]
CARTMAN
Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski.
DET. YATES
If it's a photo, what's the big deal? Why don't you just print out another one?
CARTMAN
It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!
DET. YATES
Okay, what is the picture of?
CARTMAN
[long pause] Why... why does that matter?
DET. YATES
Well how are we gonna find your picture unless we know what it is?
CARTMAN
All right. It's a picture ...of me.
DET. YATES
Yes?
CARTMAN
It's a picture ...of me. [long pause] And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth.
DET. YATES
[long pause] You were sucking somebody's penis. [this grabs other officers' attention.]
CARTMAN
No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... put their penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!
DET. YATES
...I see.
CARTMAN
Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep.
DET. YATES
Well we'd have to get a warrant first, approved by a grand jury.
CARTMAN
I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!
DET. YATES
Well then, you're screwed.
[Camp New Grace, camp office. Butters and Bradley face the director and four staffers - one of them is a woman, another is Pastor Phillips]
DIRECTOR
You both do understand that we're trying to save your souls from eternal life in hell?
BUTTERS
Well sure, I guess.
BRADLEY
Only through Christ can we cleanse our souls.
DIRECTOR
And you do know the rule which states that no impure or immoral images are allowed to be seen by the eye?
BUTTERS
Well yeah, sure.
BRADLEY
So let's purify ourselves from everything that makes the body or soul unclean. - Corinthians, chapter 7.
DIRECTOR
Then do you mind telling us why we found this [holds up a magazine with an aroused male model on one of its pages] 1979 Sears men's underwear catalog... in your room?
BRADLEY
That's... that's mine.
DIRECTOR
You know this is strictly forbidden!
BUTTERS
Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?
DIRECTOR
[rises from his chair and walks up to Butters] What's wrong?! [thrusts the magazine onto Butters' face] This is what makes you confused! Don't you get it?! This is confusing you right now, isn't it?!
BUTTERS
Yes, it's all very confusing!
DIRECTOR
This is just as much your fault, Butters! Bradley is your accountabilibuddy! That makes you accountabilibuddyable. Both of your boys' behavior has jeopardizing all of the work we're doing here to save these kids! [a gunshot and body drop are heard off screen and all the adults present look to their right. The director sighs twice, rests his left elbow on his desk, holds his left hand up, drops his head onto it, and closes his eyes. The other staffers take notice. Bradley looks down, Butters looks down, then around] Right. For having contraband in your room, you will both do penance by writing scripture for the next four days!
[8:26 p.m., Cartman's room. Cartman sits at his desk looking distraught.]
CARTMAN
That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now. [pounds his desk and gets determined] That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth. [grabs his ears and starts twisting them until they hurt] Ow. OW. OW!
[The Cartman's kitchen, moments later. Liane balances her checkbook and pays off some bills at the breakfast table. Cartman enters the kitchen, puts his head against the wall and begins to cry.]
LIANE
[taking notice] Eric? What's the, what's the matter? [walks over to him to console him]
CARTMAN
[crying throughout] I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow!
LIANE
Sweetie, shhh, tell Mommy what happened.
CARTMAN
Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee.
LIANE
Oh, now why would he do that?
CARTMAN
Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.
LIANE
What is the picture of, Eric? [Cartman stops crying]
CARTMAN
[sniffles] Last time, when Butters stayed the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have.
LIANE
Ohh, that's nice.
CARTMAN
But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay! [turns his face to the wall and cries again]
LIANE
Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay. These things happen.
CARTMAN
[looks at her and sobs] But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee! [turns to her and cries into her chest]
LIANE
It's okay, Eric. I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother.
CARTMAN
You, you will?
[Butters and Bradley are in their room doing penance - writing Biblical verses at the table.]
BUTTERS
...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!
BRADLEY
Butters, I'm sorry for getting you into trouble.
BUTTERS
Awww, that's okay, Bradley.
BRADLEY
I really want to get better. I try to do everything the counselors say, but some...how I still feel confused.
BUTTERS
Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home!
BRADLEY
You're really terrific, Butters. I mean, I think you're great. [warm thoughts... Bradley panics and leaves his chair] Uh oh! Oh God! Bad thought! Bad thought!
BUTTERS
Wuh-what's the matter?
BRADLEY
I think, I, I th-, I think I like you.
BUTTERS
Well I like you too, Bradley.
BRADLEY
You do?
BUTTERS
Well yeah!
BRADLEY
You like like me?
BUTTERS
Sure, I like like you a lot lot. [laughs]
BRADLEY
Oh God, we're both un-fixable! Don't you see we're lost causes?! We're just evil and nothing can change us! There's no other way out, Butters! We have to kill ourselves! [runs to the door and opens it, then runs out and away]
BUTTERS
[gives chase, but isn't fast enough] No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy!
[The Broflovski house, dinnertime. The Broflovskis are eating. The phone rings and Sheila gets up to answer it.]
SHEILA
Hello?
LIANE
Hello, Sheila? It's Liane, Eric's mother.
SHEILA
Ohh, hello, Mrs. Cartman.
LIANE
Um, Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but apparently your son has a picture of Eric with another boy's penis in his mouth.
SHEILA
[long pause] Excuse me?
[8:56 p.m., Cartman's room. Cartman is back at his desk fretting about the following day.]
LIANE
Don't worry, sweetie, everything is fine.
CARTMAN
It is? [happily jumps off his chair and runs to her] Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you! [hugs her]
LIANE
You have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle doesn't have the picture.
CARTMAN
[his smile vanishes] What?
LIANE
She talked with her son and says he doesn't have it.
CARTMAN
Mom, she's lying!
LIANE
She said she was sure, Eric.
CARTMAN
Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!
LIANE
Well, Eric, there's nothing more I can do about it.
CARTMAN
[thinks a moment] Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final laugh.
[Camp office, night. Butters is in there talking to the director.]
DIRECTOR
Do you mind telling me how you managed to lose... your accountabilibuddy?!
BUTTERS
I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast.
DIRECTOR
You don't seem to take this camp seriously, Butters. I've called your father in for a talk.
BUTTERS
Oh no, my Dad?
DIRECTOR
Do you understand the concept of Hell? Do you realize that if we don't fix you, you will burn in a lake of fire for eternity?
BUTTERS
Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.
DIRECTOR
We're fixing your confusion!
STEPHEN
There you are, Butters!
DIRECTOR
Oheh- hey Dad.
STEPHEN
What's he done now?!
DIRECTOR
Mr. Stotch, your son is insubordinate, unwilling to change, and worse yet, he's lost his accountabilibuddy!
A COUNSELOR
They found him! They found Bradley! You'd better come quick! [Butters runs out, followed by Stephen, then the counselor, then the director]
[A bridge similar to the one in "Fat Butt and Pancake Head", day. Bradley is near the middle of the span, hanging on to the side but ready to jump off. A crowd has gathered at one end of the bridge. The director arrives, followed by Pastor Phillips, Butters, and Stephen]
DIRECTOR
Oh Lord in Heaven! Don't jump, Bradley!
BRADLEY
Stay-stay back! I'm an abomination of God!
DIRECTOR
No no, we're fixing you!
[South Park Elementary, next day. Cartman marches towards class with a slide projector. He turns left and enters the classroom]
[Mrs. Garrison's class. Cartman approaches Kyle]
CARTMAN
Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone? [Kyle turns around and Cartman is in his face. Cartman softly says] Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction!
MRS. GARRISON
Okay students, let's all take our seats. Since it is Monday, we'll start as always with Show And Tell. [writes the words on the board] Who'd like to go first? [Cartman holds down Kyle's arm while raising his own and grunts]
KYLE
Ow! Quit it, dude!
MRS. GARRISON
Okay Eric, Jesus, calm down. You can go first.
CARTMAN
HA! [gets up and goes to the board, pulls down the projector screen and clears his throat.] For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer. [clicks the projector on, and the class lights dim] This first picture I like to call "Moods of Winter" [a shot of snow-covered barren trees], a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?
KYLE
[to Stan] He isn't actually going to show everyone...
CARTMAN
And now this next picture [clears his throat. Quick cut to]
[The bridge near camp, day. Bradley is still hanging on.]
DIRECTOR
Don't jump, Bradley! You will only make god angrier with you!
BRADLEY
It's too late.
BUTTERS
[approaches the bridge] Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look?
DIRECTOR
You get back. You're only gonna make things worse.
BRADLEY
I'm not normal. I'll never be normal!
BUTTERS
You're perfectly normal, Bradley.
DIRECTOR
Get back! You're just as confused as he is!
BUTTERS
[gets angry] All right. All right that does it! [turns around and faces the crowd] I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was! [Bradley listens] You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!
BRADLEY
Yeah.
BUTTERS
I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself! [Bradley thinks about this]
BRADLEY
I think. I think I'd like to come down now.
DIRECTOR
He's coming down! [everyone begins to chatter] We did it! [stops by Bradley as Bradley climbs back onto the bridge's road] Through the power of Christ we have saved this child!
STEPHEN
Well Butters, I guess we might as well go home. Looks like you're never gonna change.
BUTTERS
No. I like bein' bi-curious.
STEPHEN
Well you know somethin'? So do I. [they both have a good laugh about it]
BUTTERS
Wait. Now I am confused.
[Mrs. Garrison's class. Cartman continues his presentation]
CARTMAN
And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial. [everyone gasps]
BEBE
Eww!
CLYDE
[long pause] Dude.
CARTMAN
Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.
MRS. GARRISON
Eric, what the hell is this?!
CARTMAN
What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-
MR. MACKEY
[at the door] Uh, Eric Cartman? We got an emergency message from your mother? [reads the message] "Do not show picture. Kyle didn't have it after all. Found it under your desk." She said you'd know what that means, m'kay? [walks away. Cartman stands there looking at the door, then at the class. Kyle has a look of pity for Cartman on his face and blinks]
CARTMAN
[longer pause] ...Lame.
End of Cartman Sucks

synopsis:When Mrs. Garrison refuses to name names about an infestation of head lice that plagues South Park Elementary, Cartman finds a way to detect who has lice.

script:Lice Capades

[South Park Elementary, morning. The bell rings and the fourth graders take their seats. Mrs. Garrison enters with her books and sets them on her desk.]
MRS. GARRISON
All right, students, let's take our seats. Apparently we have a little problem here at the school which we need to talk about.
CARTMAN
Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem. [points to Kyle, but blocks Kyle's view of his left hand with his right.] Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it.
MRS. GARRISON
No, I mean the problem of head lice. [a shot of the class] There's been a lice breakout at a school in Denver, and we need to make sure nobody spreads it here.
BEBE
Somebody might have lice?
CLASS
Ewww!
MRS. GARRISON
So today you're all going to the gymnasium to have your scalps examined.
CARTMAN
Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.
KENNY
(What? Fuck you!)
MRS. GARRISON
I'm sure this class is clean, but we're gonna be examined so that if anyone has the lice, we can stop it before it spreads. [the camera zooms in on Clyde, then on his hair...] Lice can live in anybody's hair. [...until the hair resembles a forest, with tiny houses built upon the individual hairs and a colony of lice walking around on the scalp below.]
[Clyde's scalp. The camera follows one louse as he walks through this forest.]
MALE LOUSE
[approaching a female louse with a growing louse egg resting in a nest built on a shaft] Hello, Kelly. How's my baby?
KELLY
[sassily] You mean me or the little one?
MALE LOUSE
I mean both.
KELLY
Well, besides a little loneliness waiting for Daddy to come home, I guess we're both okay.
MALE LOUSE
[holds onto one of the female's pincers] How did a louse like me get so lucky to have a louse like you?
KELLY
Luck had nothing to do with it, Travis. [a group of lice tug on a hair nearby and pull it down. Travis and Kelly look on. He lets go and walks towards the fallen hair] You okay?
TRAVIS
Sometimes... I just worry what kind of world our baby is gonna grow up in. [turns around] I need to run up to the forest and do another sediment analysis. I'm worried we might be overworking the tertiary layer. [turns away and walks off]
[The gymnasium, later. The classes are lined up by grade level, with various screeners waiting at the heads of the lines.]
LEAD SCREENER
All students, make sure you're in line according to your grade. When you reach the front of the line you will go behind the curtain and remove any hats to be checked. [The first students go behind the curtains. Craig takes off his hat and does the same]
BUTTERS
Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in my hair.
STAN
[looks to Kyle] What do you think happens if you do have it?
CARTMAN
[answering] They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls. [Butters gasps]
CRAIG
[leaves the curtain and puts on his hat] I'm clean! I knew I didn't have any stupid lice! [walks past the rest of the class]
CARTMAN
This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.
KENNY
(Hey! Fuck off!) [The screener waves Clyde forward and Clyde steps behind the curtain]
LEAD SCREENER
Have a seat on the stool. [Clyde goes to the stool]
[Clyde's scalp. The camera tracks Travis as he moves through the forest, but the scalp begins to shake and he stops. He turns around to see the hair part and a huge human eye pop up. The eye blinks, then he blinks, then the eye blinks again. Travis backs up a bit, then turns to run.]
[Behind the curtain. The screener has spotted the lice.]
LEAD SCREENER
Uh oh, looks like you've got 'em.
CLYDE
What?
LEAD SCREENER
You have lice. Let's see... Clyde Harris, is it?
CLYDE
Oh my God. Oh Christ no!
LEAD SCREENER
[writes a note and gives it to him] Now now, it's all right. We're going to call your parents and get you to your doctor.
CLYDE
Please, ya-you don't understand. The other kids are gonna make fun of me forever!
LEAD SCREENER
I'm sure your friends aren't that cruel.
CLYDE
Yes they are!
[Clyde's scalp. A group of lice surround the stump left from the fallen hair, including some older lice.]
TRAVIS
[approaching the group] Mr. President! Mr. President! I believe we have a serious problem! [the other lice look at him] The environment... is changing. I believe it is somehow, reacting to our presence on it.
PRESIDENT
And what do you base this on?
TRAVIS
[walks up to a hair and draws a human head on it] Look, this is the world, right? But now, think of the world as... a living being. [the other lice look surprised] If it were somehow conscious, then it would ultimately become aware of our effect on it.
OLDER LOUSE
Huh right, the world is conscious. It makes perfect sense. [kneels and knocks on the scalp several times] Hello. Anybody? [the other lice begin to laugh.]
TRAVIS
If we have made too much of an impact, then that consciousness would try to snuff us out! I think we're looking at a global catastrophe, the likes of which we've never seen!
OLDER LOUSE
Poodiggery and poppycock!
TRAVIS
I think we need to put all resources now into a full investigation, perhaps even begin a licewide evacuation.
OLDER LOUSE
Evacuation?! Tomorrow is the Gootack Festival. Do you know how much money we would lose? Escort Mr. Mayfield out. The President can't be bothered any further.
TRAVIS
[as security escorts him away] Damn you Vice President Craig! You could be killin' us all!
[A waiting room. Clyde and his mom sit with a man reading a magazine, and a girl with her mother. Clyde looks around]
CLYDE
This is so... embarrassing.
GIRL
I have an ear infection. What are you seeing the doctor for?
CLYDE
I have... I have AIDS. [his mother looks at him, astonished]
NURSE
Clyde Harris? [Clyde goes in to see the doctor. His mother watches him with an angry expression.]
DOCTOR
[writing out a prescription] Yeeaahh, that's a pretty bad lice problem there. Good thing they pulled you out of school.
CLYDE
[desperate] But why me, doctor? Why me?! How did I get this?!
DOCTOR
[walks up to Clyde] Well, believe it or not, some lice can actually attach themselves to flies, and then wait for the fly to land on someone's head where they can reproduce. And then the lice that live in your head now were probably all born there.
CLYDE
...Sick!
DOCTOR
This shampoo should take care of it. [hands him a bottle] Use this in the shower. Your scalp may burn a bit afterwards, but... it should kill... every last one of them.
[Clyde's scalp. The lice go about their business, climbing up and down the hairs. Travis takes a break on a hair stump.]
KELLY
Travis? Everything okay?
TRAVIS
Kelly, I was just thinkin' about our baby. I want to name her... Hope.
KELLY
Hope?
TRAVIS
Hope for a... chance at tomorrow? [water begins to drop down from on high]
LOUSE 1
It's raining? Now? [Other lice stop and notice. Turns out Clyde is taking a shower.]
[Clyde's shower. He rinses himself off and then picks up the shampoo he was given: RID-X. KILLS INSTANTLY LICE & THEIR EGGS.]
[Clyde's scalp. The rain continues and the lice get used to it.]
LOUSE 2
[starts dancing] Woohoo! I love the rain! [other lice join in the play. Travis doesn't have a good feeling about this]
TRAVIS
Oh my God. [runs to Kelly and their egg] We have to get out of here!
KELLY
What it, it's just rain.
TRAVIS
We have to get out of here now, Kelly! [grabs the egg and runs off with Kelly. Other lice continue dancing in the rain while still others watch. One or two look around and notice a green liquid spreading over the scalp.]
LOUSE 3
What is that? [walks up to the leading edge, reaches down and grabs a gob of it. The liquid quickly eats through his pincer and he screams in pain. The leading edge of the liquid moves past him and leaves him trapped in the liquid, which eats at him some more]
LICE
Whoa! [the liquid finally finishes him off. The other lice see the leading edge of the liquid get closer to them, and they run] Ruuun! [some of them get overtaken by the liquid, which is now moving quickly over the scalp. The camera follows them until it finds Travis]
TRAVIS
Everyone get up into the trees! We have to get up high! Come on, Kelly! [the lice that can, climb up the hairs while the others get swept up by the RID-X and killed]
KELLY
My God, Travis, they're all dying!
TRAVIS
Don't look, Kelly! Don't look!
LOUSE 4
What the hell is it?!
LOUSE 5
Well it's okay, we're safe up here! [the hairs begin to sway back and forth as a strong wind begins to blow]
TRAVIS
I don't think so! [lice begin to be pushed off the hairs]
LOUSE 4
[blown away] OoOhOOOoooh!
[Clyde's bathroom. He's standing on a stool before the mirror blowing his hair dry.]
[Clyde's scalp. The wind keeps blowing lice off hair. Travis hangs on tight to the hair and to Kelly.]
KELLY
Travis!
TRAVIS
Kelly! Hang on!
KELLY
I can't... hang on!
TRAVIS
You have to! For the baby! [Kelly's grip loosens. She tightens it, but the wind rips her from the pincer she was holding on with]
KELLY
Nooooooooooo!
TRAVIS
Kellllllyyyyy! No! Noooo! [he's left alone on the hair with the egg, Hope]
[Clyde's bathroom. He's done drying his hair and sets the hair dryer aside, steps off the stool, turns off the light, and leaves.]
[South Park Elementary, day, Mrs. Garrison's class. She's just come in with her books.]
MRS. GARRISON
Okay, kids, today we're going to review some Civil War history. Who can tell me what year the war started?
CARTMAN
Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?
MRS. GARRISON
With what?
CRAIG
With the lice exam. Did they find anybody with lice? [Clyde looks apprehensive, and Mrs. Garrison notices]
MRS. GARRISON
Y-yes, some lice was discovered and the proper action has been taken.
STAN
Somebody in this class?
MRS. GARRISON
Uh, yes.
CLASS
Ohhhhh.
CARTMAN
Well who was it? [points to Kenny] It was Kenny, right?
MRS. GARRISON
That doesn't matter, it's over.
CARTMAN
Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who! [points to Kenny again] It was Kenny, wasn't it?
RED
I wanna know who it was, too.
MRS. GARRISON
It's being kept confidential! There's a policy in the schools not to single out a kid who has lice, because of the embarrassment it can cause, okay?!
CARTMAN
[pounds on his desk] That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!
CLASS
Yeah!
BEBE
And we have a right to know which boy had lice in his hair so we don't ever go out with them!
CRAIG
How do we know it was a boy? It could just have easily been one of you stupid girls!
BUTTERS
Yeah! Dumb girls!
MRS. GARRISON
The case is closed! Whoever had the lice, they're dead now! We're moving on to Civil War history. [the camera zooms in on Clyde again] Ulysses S. Grant-
[Clyde's scalp, the aftermath. Travis is asleep on the scalp, battered and bruised from the wind. He coughs himself awake and finds the egg with him, intact]
TRAVIS
Hope. Hope, you're alive. [he stands up to his full height and surveys the destruction all around him] My God... [a decomposed louse stands up and collapses on him] Heh?!
LOUSE 6
Help me... Help meeee... [it falls away and dies]
LOUSE 7
Travis. [Travis looks to his right] Over here! Travis, if you hadn't warned us to get up in them trees, we'd all be dead.
TRAVIS
How many survivors?
LOUSE 7
Just the six of us. And the Vice President.
TRAVIS
[notices and throws the Vice President up against a hair] You son of a bitch! You had a chance to stop this! So help me, if we live through this, I'm gonna see you rot in prison!
LOUSE 8
What do we do now?
TRAVIS
[turns and faces the others] We aren't out of this yet! You two look for other survivors. You get whatever food you can and bring it back here. [the lice do as commanded]
VICE PRESIDENT
[the older louse] Who put you in charge?!
TRAVIS
[turns around] God did! When he killed my wife! [turns back and walks away]
[South Park Elementary, day, hallway. The fourth graders leave the classroom.]
CARTMAN
All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you! [Opposite Cartman are Jimmy, Tweek, Clyde, Anne, Bebe, Red. and two other kids. With Cartman are Craig, Tolkien, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Kevin, Butters, and Wendy]
CRAIG
Yeah, come on! We're gonna find out sooner or later.
CARTMAN
Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!
KYLE
You know what? I'll bet it was you!
CARTMAN
Me?!
KYLE
This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!
CARTMAN
I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me!
STAN
You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!
CARTMAN
That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan. [Stan is stunned]
KYLE
Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal.
CARTMAN
And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing! [Kenny makes an angry face]
BUTTERS
[sensing where this is going] Heh hey guys, what would I do?
BEBE
Let's just get a magnifying glass and look at everyone's heads.
KYLE
It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.
CLYDE
Well I guess we're never gonna know. There's no way to tell.
CARTMAN
There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it! [turns left and walks away. Clyde looks around]
KYLE
It was him. It had to have been him!
STAN
Yeah... Or you. [they check out each other]
[Clyde's scalp. More survivors are brought to the clearing]
LOUSE 9
Mark? Mark, you have to hang on.
TRAVIS
This isn't going to stop. The world is rejecting us! If we're gonna live, we have to get off this planet.
LOUSE 8
How?
TRAVIS
First we have to get out of the forest, into the forbidden zone. It's the only way we might even see another planet!
LOUSE 9
The forbidden zone... We'll be exposed. We'll die out there.
TRAVIS
We'll die here! Look, the world is getting rid of us! Don't you get it?!
LOUSE 10
Getting rid of us? You-you mean like it knows what it's doing?
TRAVIS
Yes! Because maybe we rolled the dice too many times!
LOUSE 9
I'm not leaving my husband.
LOUSE 11
Yeah huh-I'll take my chances here.
TRAVIS
You can all stay here; I'm gonna try to save my baby. [turns around and walks away]
LOUSE 12
[redhead, runs up to him] I'll go with you. There's nothing left for me here.
VICE PRESIDENT
I wanna go too.
TRAVIS
Not a chance.
VICE PRESIDENT
Look, I know I messed up, all right? But I think you're right. If we can get out of the forest, we might find another place to live.
TRAVIS
If we find anything, we'll try to send help for the rest of you. [to the redhead and the Vice President] Let's go. [the redhead moves] Come on if you're comin' Mister Vice President! [turns left and follows the redhead]
VICE PRESIDENT
[tarries] Yeah. Right behind you. [pulls out a gun and cocks it]
[A storage room somewhere in school. Cartman is wearing a detective coat as other fourth grade boys enter the room]
CARTMAN
All right, lock that door, Craig! [Craig goes to lock the door]
KYLE
What's this about, Cartman? [the boys are now seated on a bench against a wall]
CARTMAN
I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice. [whips out a little propane torch from his right pocket] We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties. [whips out a lighter from his left pocket, strikes the lighter on, and uses the lighter to light the torch. He puts the lighter away. Clyde is scared now.] Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air.
JIMMY
Ur ur re- ur really?
KYLE
That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!
CARTMAN
[figuring out how to respond] This is a scientific test, designed to-
KYLE
You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!
CARTMAN
I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!
KYLE
Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!
CARTMAN
If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice!
CRAIG
Yeah. That's true.
JIMMY
I have no problem taking the test. I have nothing to hi-huhiii-hide
TOLKIEN
Yeah. Me neither.
KYLE
All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.
CARTMAN
Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.
[The storage room, moments later. The boys have all given their 30 cc's in the labeled Petri dishes.]
CARTMAN
All right, now everyone back over there! [the boys head back to the bench] We'll start with what I already know. [moves the heated coil tip over the blood sample. Only steam comes from it]
BUTTERS
Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice.
KYLE
It doesn't prove anything!
CARTMAN
Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle! [takes Kyle's Petri dish and ...the same thing happens] Huh, I guess you're clean. [tries another Petri dish]
CLYDE
Ye-you guys, we'd better go. Recess is almost over.
CARTMAN
It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH! [sticks the tip into the Petri dish, causing the blood to heat up and jump out of the dish. He gets the blood all over himself, and for good measure, tosses the rest of the blood onto himself.]
TOLKIEN
What the hell?! [Clyde is scared shitless. Cartman turns the dish around to reveal the name: Kenny]
CARTMAN
Kenny!
KYLE
No way.
CRAIG
You were right all along, Eric. It was Kenny.
CARTMAN
Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice! [silence for a second or two, then Kenny bolts for the door, pushing Craig aside, opening the door, and running down the hall]
[Clyde's scalp. The survivors have made it to the hairline.]
LOUSE 12
We've done it. We've reached the forbidden zone. [a vast space of... nothing, like a desert] I've always heard stories about this place. Never thought it was real.
TRAVIS
It's real. Real as my love for my unborn baby.
VICE PRESIDENT
So what exactly is your plan, Travis?
TRAVIS
Our ancestors came here from another world. Maybe there's still other worlds out there with life forms like us. Maybe there's even a world where they've learned to live with the planet instead of just on it.
LOUSE 12
Travis. Travis, you're, so wise, so strong. If we make it out of this, I'd like to... be with you.
TRAVIS
Sorry, babe, but my heart is forever stenciled in permanent ink with the name [closes his eyes] Kelly.
LOUSE 12
She was a lucky woman to have you.
TRAVIS
Luck had nothin' to do with it. [a gunshot from behind kills the redhead, who wobbles forward, then back and to the ground. The Vice President keeps his gun trained on her corpse]
VICE PRESIDENT
[aims his gun at Travis] Sorry to cut the honeymoon short!
TRAVIS
Why you murdering bastard!
VICE PRESIDENT
Your little fantasy of another world ends here! Walk!
TRAVIS
What the hell do you want, Vice President?!
VICE PRESIDENT
Walk! [Travis turns and walks, and the Vice President follows him, keeping the gun trained on him.]
[Clyde's house, day. The doorbell rings and Clyde goes to answer it. Cartman, Craig, and a few others - Tolkien and Jimmy - are outside with socks and bars of soap.]
CRAIG
Clyde, dude, get down to the park. We caught Kenny, and we're all gonna let him have it! [points to the sock in his right hand]
CLYDE
What? What are you gonna do to him?
CARTMAN
He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen. [beat] Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park! [they turn and head off]
CLYDE
[his eyes wander as he thinks] You guys, wait. [the guys turn around]
CARTMAN
What, Clyde?
CLYDE
I... nothing.
CARTMAN
All right, see you there! [the guys turn around and leave] Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it!
TOLKIEN, CRAIG
Yeah!
JIMMY
Yeah! We're gonna fu-fu-fuck him up! [Clyde sees them leave, then backs up, scared]
[Mrs. Garrison's house, day. Mrs. Garrison seems to be preparing an omelet for herself, adding garlic salt and putting it aside. The phone rings and she picks up.]
MRS. GARRISON
Yello?
CLYDE
Mrs. Garrison, one of your students is about to be attacked at the park by all the other students.
MRS. GARRISON
What? Who's going to get attacked? Who is this?!
CLYDE
Please just hurry to the park! You have to stop them!
[Clyde's scalp, the hairline. The Vice President and Travis are still walking]
VICE PRESIDENT
That's good! That's far enough! [Travis stops and turns]
TRAVIS
What are you going to do?
VICE PRESIDENT
I'm gonna go back to the village, start to rebuild, mate with the females, become... President!
TRAVIS
Don't you get it? The world doesn't want you here! It's not gonna stop until you're dead!
VICE PRESIDENT
It was a disaster! Disasters happen!
TRAVIS
Then go ahead and die there, I'm leavin' with my baby!
VICE PRESIDENT
Actually, you're never leaving here either, Travis! [shoots out the knees of Travis's hind legs]
TRAVIS
Damn you! Why?!
VICE PRESIDENT
Because when I'm President, I can't have pests like you constantly trying to preach that the world is alive! You're an idealistic fool! The world is not "conscious," we are conscious! If the world was alive, it would feel this! [plugs six bullets into Clyde's scalp]
[Clyde's neighborhood, day. He's walking towards the park.]
CLYDE
[feeling the little stings] Ow. [reaches back to the base of his skull]
[Clyde's scalp, the hairline. The Vice President is about to finish Travis off]
VICE PRESIDENT
You die he- [looks up. Two fingers reach down and grab him. He screams like he's never screamed before as Travis watches the fingers take him away.]
[Clyde's neighborhood, day. Clyde glances at the louse and tosses it away. The Vice President screams to his death on the sidewalk below.]
[Clyde's scalp, the hairline. Travis tries to stand up, but ends up flat on his back. He can no longer move, so he just cries.]
[The neighborhood park. The boys have gathered on the basketball court to let Kenny have it.]
CARTMAN
Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!
KENNY
[restrained by Kevin and Bradley] (Not guilty!)
CARTMAN
Guilty! I thought so! [the boys pull down his hood and coat, and his shirt]
CRAIG
All right, let's do this!
CLYDE
You guys, maybe we should just... wait a few more minutes?
CARTMAN
All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks! [the boys gang up on Kenny and give him the sock bath]
KENNY
Nohoho! No, not the socks! Ahhhgh, stop!
CLYDE
Wait, wait!
KYLE
Wait... stop it, stop it! [he walks away; the others stop and look at him] I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.
CRAIG
He had cooties and he lied about it!
KYLE
[looks over his left shoulder] Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?! [looks away] It was me.
CLYDE
What?
KYLE
I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.
STAN
Why are you saying that, Kyle? You can't be the one who had head lice. [walks up to him] Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out, didn't you?!
CLYDE
Wait a-wait a minute, what?
CARTMAN
Oh I get it. [walks up to Stan and Kyle] This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?!
STAN
You had head lice?
CARTMAN
Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!
MRS. GARRISON
[offscreen] You all had head lice! [the boys look up and off to the left. Mrs. Garrison walks up to them on the court] Every single person in the class! The boys aaand the girls! Lice spreads fast, you dumb-asses!
CRAIG
I thought I was the only one.
BUTTERS
Me too.
CARTMAN
But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath! [the other boys join in the chant "Sock bath!" and gang up on Kenny once again]
[Clyde's hair. With the redhead and the Vice President gone, Travis is left alone with his thoughts.]
TRAVIS
Kelly. Kelly, can you hear mih? I don't know if you can. But... I wanted you to know I tried. I tried to save our baby. But I let you down, babe. [blinks. A light shines on him and a vision of Kelly descends. Travis holds his left hand up as a visor to make sure he's not hallucinating] Keh... k-Kelly? [Kelly's apparition disappears, replaced by a fly. Travis climbs on to one of the fly's legs, and the fly takes off. After a long while, the fly alights on a new host and Travis drops to the ground, asleep. Members of a darker, buffer species of louse watch from the shadows. They prop him up and carry him away]
LOUSE 13
You are welcome here. [the colony here is well-developed, with entrances to dwellings going up several stories, making the hairs act as high-rise apartments. The residents there wave as he passes by] You're safe now. We've lived here for generation after generation, never being disturbed.
TRAVIS
Heh. We made it, Hope. We made it, Kelly! [at this point the camera pulls back, out of the hair, and out of the space between a pair of female legs. The camera pulls back enough to show an actress exiting her limousine.]
[An actress with big lips is seen coming out of a limousine, with photographers ready to take pictures of her.]
AGENT
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Angelina Jolie! [photographers start snapping away with their cameras]
ANGELINA JOLIE
Hello, everyone! [scratches her groin through her dress] Hello!
End of Lice Capades

synopsis:When a new Muslim student joins the class, Cartman immediately suspects him of being a terrorist.

script:The Snuke

[South Park Elementary, morning. The school bell rings and the kids rush in to sit down. Mrs. Garrison enters the classroom.]
MRS. GARRISON
All right, students, let's take our seats. Everyone try to be nice because we have a new student joining us today, and I know you'll all make him feel welcome. Say hello to... Baahir Hassan Abdul Hakeem.
CARTMAN
Uh oh! [Kyle's seat is empty, and he fears the worst]
MRS. GARRISON
Welcome to our class, Baahir.
BAAHIR
Thank you.
CARTMAN
Duhude, dude, [throws out his arms, palms out] not cool!
MRS. GARRISON
Why don't you take a seat in Kyle's empty desk for now?
BAAHIR
Okay. [goes to Kyle's seat. Cartman begins crawling out of his, away from Baahir]
CARTMAN
Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo.
MRS. GARRISON
[stopping him. What follows is in hushed tones] Eric, what the hell is wrong with you?!
CARTMAN
What's wrong? [looks at Baahir, who's looking back at him, then looks back at Mrs. Garrison and takes her aside] Has he been checked for bombs?
MRS. GARRISON
Eric, that's enough! Not all Muslim people are terrorists!
CARTMAN
No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.
[The school playground, recess. There are several kids waiting at the slide, Butters takes his turn.]
BUTTERS
[slides down gleefully] Now you go, Baahir. [Baahir climbs the ladder steps and slides down. Butters cheers him on. Cartman shows up and looks at them. Baahir dusts himself off. Cartman turns and walks away, then places a call on his cell phone]
[Kyle's bedroom, day. Kyle is still in bed, his window curtains drawn shut. There's lots of little tissues on his bed and surrounding floor with two plates on the floor next to the bed. His cordless phone is on the covers. It rings, he picks up]
KYLE
[sniffs - he has a stuffy nose] Yeah?
CARTMAN
[hushed] Kyle, are you on your computer?
KYLE
What? No, I'm sick. [sniffs]
CARTMAN
Get online. I need you to check something for me.
KYLE
Dude, leave me alone.
CARTMAN
Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!
KYLE
[sits right up] What? Why?
CARTMAN
Get online now!
KYLE
All right, all right. [leaves his bed and goes to his computer, sits down and starts clicking]
CARTMAN
Go to MySpace. [enters the school building] See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.
KYLE
[types a search term at MySpace] Baahir Hakeem. [Baahir's page pops up] Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?
CARTMAN
[begins walking down the hallway] Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?
KYLE
Over a hundred.
CARTMAN
[walks further along] Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?
KYLE
White Stripes
CARTMAN
[stops suddenly] That's funny.
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.
[A ticking clock: 11:59:57... 11:59:58... 11:59:59... 12:00:00... Darkness. The following text appears onscreen, then disappears after Cartman finishes speaking.]
CARTMAN
[voiceover] The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.
[South Park Police Station, day, Officer Barbrady's desk. A hovering camera looks at a ringing phone. Officer Barbrady answers.]
BARBRADY
Hello?
CARTMAN
[entering the boys' restroom, still in hushed tones] Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! [checks the toilet stalls on all fours]
BARBRADY
From what? Who is this?
CARTMAN
I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!
BARBRADY
Are you serious?
CARTMAN
If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this?
BARBRADY
Like what?
CARTMAN
Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.
BARBRADY
Oh jeez.
[South Park Elementary, Mrs. Garrison's class, later. Mrs. Garrison moves on to History, but the school bell goes off as a fire drill.]
MRS. GARRISON
What the hell?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[over the PA system] All students are to evacuate the school immediately! [Baahir looks around]
[The front of South Park Elementary, later. The kids pour out happily.]
BUTTERS
Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers?
BAAHIR
Sure, okay. [12:02:32 pops up on screen and ticks the seconds away.]
BUTTERS
Well all right! [they walk off together]
KYLE
Dude. [sniffs and calls Cartman. The LED readout vanishes]
CARTMAN
[exits the building through a side door and answers the call] Yeah. [walks among various trash cans and bins]
KYLE
Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school.
CARTMAN
Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!
KYLE
I guess so.
CARTMAN
Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!
KYLE
Wuh what doesn't follow?
CARTMAN
Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion. [starts running] Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!
KYLE
Okay.
CARTMAN
Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!
KYLE
[looks up the info as Cartman talks] Yeah. Actually, there is.
CARTMAN
[stops] What?
KYLE
There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally. [Cartman stays silent] Cartman? ...Cartman? [Cartman has turned off his phone and runs out of school]
[Central Intelligence Agency, day. An agent takes a call and-]
AGENT
Sir! There's somebody calling in saying there's going to be a terrorist attack on the Hillary Clinton rally today.
HEAD AGENT
What? [takes the call] This is CIA head, Alan Thompson.
CARTMAN
Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!
MR. THOMPSON
What do you know?
CARTMAN
He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!
MR. THOMPSON
I'm the head of the CIA! You can tell me!
CARTMAN
I said I will only talk to the President!
MR. THOMPSON
Look, if you have information of a threat, you could-
CARTMAN
LALALALALALALALA!
MR. THOMPSON
I will have you arrested for-!
CARTMAN
LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!
[The Oval Office, 12:04:27 South Park time. The LED readout ticks away, the ominous echo follows.]
AIDE
Call is coming through now, Mr. President.
BUSH
Hello?
CARTMAN
President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?
BUSH
Huh? Who.
CARTMAN
Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!
BUSH
Hildog?
[A motorcade in South Park, day. The American flag waving from a pole on the hood indicates Secret Service protection.]
AIDE
Yes, I understand. I'll let Ms. Clinton know.
HILLARY
What is it, Brian?
BRIAN
Ms. Clinton, we just received word of a possible terrorist attack on your rally today.
HILLARY
Is the thread credible?
BRIAN
We aren't sure, but... perhaps it's best we call it off. [behind him, the rally gets closer and closer]
HILLARY
No. No, I will not be bullied by terrorist threats. Your men do a good job, Brian. I have faith that any thread will be taken care of accordingly.
DRIVER
We've reached the rally site, Hildog.
[The rally site, downtown South Park.]
AIDE 2
Don't worry, Mrs. Clinton, I'm sure everything will be fine.
HILLARY
Thank you, Chris. [leaves with Brian and a third aide. The driver walks off in the opposite direction, and Chris whips out a cell phone. He walks forward and calls someone]
CHRIS
They know about the bomb!
BLOND RUSSIAN
That is impossible! We took every measure to assure the bomb was hidden from sight.
CHRIS
Well somebody tipped off the CIA. I don't know how much they know, but security has been heightened.
BLOND RUSSIAN
That bomb must travel with the Clinton rally to Boston!
CHRIS
The bomb won't make it to Boston now! With the heightened security, it's only a matter of time before they find it!
BLONDE RUSSIAN
Then we have no choice. We have to move up the attack.
CHRIS
I understand, comrade.
BLONDE RUSSIAN
Prepare yourself. We detonate the bomb... within the hour.
[12:17:56. Time keeps on ticking, ticking, ticking... Kyle is still at home, Cartman roams the rally.]
CARTMAN
Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!
KYLE
So then maybe you're wrong.
CARTMAN
Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?
KYLE
Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.
CARTMAN
Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?
KYLE
Yeah. [Cartman giggles and sticks the phone down his pants, in front of his genitals. He takes the picture and sends it to Kyle. Kyle receives it on his computer] What is that?
CARTMAN
It's my balls! [laughs as Kyle just looks at the image]
KYLE
God damn it Cartman!
CARTMAN
[his laugh dies down, then] Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
People of South Park, it is my honor to introduce a woman who deserves nothing but respect. Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton! [the crowd cheers and holds up pro-Hillary signs: "Hildog", "In Hildog We Trust", "Hildog, we love you!", "Hildog #1 fan", "South Park Wants Hildog!!", "Hildog '08", "We Love You"]
HILLARY
[affecting a Southern accent] It is so nice to be back in a small town like the one I came from. [more cheers for her]
HILDOG FAN
Here we go! [his friends don dog-headed helmets and start barking.]
BRIAN
Otis Green, anything on that bomb threat? ["You know, when I start my life in office, quite a few changes have to be made!"]
OTIS
We have the bomb-sniffing pig going through the crowd. If there is a bomb, the pig will find it. [the third aide has the pig on a leash, letting it roam as it will]
HILLARY
This is why I campaign in small towns like these! Because it is in towns like South Park that you find the true America! [more cheers go up as aide and pig move around]
AIDE 3
Oh my God, she got a scent! [the pig walks faster]
BRIAN
What?!
AIDE 3
The pig is picking up the smell of nuclear residue. Terrorists have hidden a bomb!
BRIAN
[getting nervous] Oh my God! Where?! Where could they have stashed it?!
AIDE 3
Come on, find it. Find! [the pig leads him up the steps to the stage]
BRIAN
My God, they hid it under the stage?!
FEMALE AIDE
No wait, look. [the pig approaches Hillary and really wants to get at that bomb]
HILLARY
How much money do we have to waste on needless spendin' when we should be focusing all our attention on... uh... [the pig buries its snout in Hillary's ass] on the education of all- Woo haha, whoa there, girl. Haha, [puts some distance between herself and the pig, but the pig won't back off] uh, uh, on the education of all children. [the pig tries the groin this time] Oh, I declare!
OTIS
Oh my God. Do you think they could have hidden a nuclear device up Mrs. Clinton's...
[CIA Headquarters. An agent comes up to Mr. Thompson with a report.]
AGENT
Mr. Thompson, the kid who called in the warning was right! We uncovered intel that terrorists have obtained a nuclear device, and that they have most likely hidden it in Mrs. Clinton's... well, in her...
MR. THOMPSON
In her what?
AGENT
In her snatch, sir.
MR. THOMPSON
What?!
[Back at the rally, later. Brian observes as two paramedics seat Hillary down on a gurney.]
HILLARY
What is goin' on? I wasn't finished.
BRIAN
Security measure, Mrs. Clinton. Probably nothing. [receives a call and answers it] Yes.
[A CIA helicopter on its way to South Park, day.]
MR. THOMPSON
Mr. Jeffries, this is Alan Thompson with the CIA. We have reason to believe that Mrs. Clinton may have a nuclear device up her snatch.
BRIAN
A what?!
MR. THOMPSON
A snatch. It's the technical term for vagina.
BRIAN
No, I mean what kind of nuclear device?!
[A diagram of a bomb inside a woman's uterus. Zoom out to reveal CIA headquarters]
MR. WATERS
Mr. Jeffries, this is Frank Waters. It's a suitcase nuke, designed to fit in a woman's snizz. It's called a snuke.
[Back at the rally, later. Brian walks up to Hillary.]
HILLARY
What is goin' on, Brian?
BRIAN
Ms. Clinton, it appears that terrorists have snuck a snuke up your snizz.
HILLARY
[fans herself in a Southern fashion] Oh my.
BRIAN
What do we do? Can we disable the timer?
MR. THOMPSON
It won't have a timer. Snukes are detonated remotely. Whoever our terrorist is has a detonator with him.
BRIAN
But then that means...
MR. THOMPSON
Yes. If we don't find that detonator, everyone in the town of South Park is going to die. For-ever.
[12:28:38 and counting. Four images come up: Hillary on the gurney, Kyle at his computer, Butters and Baahir playing checkers in Butters' living room, and the CIA landing in South Park]
MR. THOMPSON
Do we have that phone trace?
CIA VICE HEAD
[hands him the phone] The call is going through now, sir.
CARTMAN
[gets the call] Yeah? [walks through a parking lot]
MR. THOMPSON
This is CIA head Alan Thompson. We spoke before about the- [he and his agents walk down the street. Two angles are shown of that, and a third image of Cartman walking through the lot]
CARTMAN
Yes, Mr. Thompson?
MR. THOMPSON
Well, we've just arrived in your town.
CARTMAN
Why? Did you find something?
MR. THOMPSON
Yes. There's a suitcase nuke in Ms. Clinton's snizz.
CARTMAN
[stops] A snuke?
MR. THOMPSON
That's right. It's controlled by a remote detonator. We have to locate the terrorist before he sets it off.
CARTMAN
[walks again] I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you?
MR. THOMPSON
We're on the town's main street, right by an ice cream shop.
CARTMAN
Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you. [the framing for the two scenes is removed to reveal the one image of Cartman standing next to the CIA agents. They look at each other]
MR. THOMPSON
Oh, hey.
[Kyle's room, day. Kyle is still at his computer when Stan walks in.]
STAN
Dude, we totally got let out of school.
KYLE
I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for "Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally" right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos.
STAN
Russian?
KYLE
Yeah, this guy. [a YouTube profile page is shown] Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally.
STAN
So he's a Hillary Clinton fan.
KYLE
No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?
STAN
Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.
KYLE
Oh that's a good idea. [does the search]
[The Hakeem house, later. Police, SWAT, and CIA move in on the house and arrest Baahir's parents.]
MR. HAKEEM
What is going on? What have we done?
MR. THOMPSON
They claim they don't know anything about an attack.
CARTMAN
Big surprise!
POLICE OFFICER
Sir, first pass of the house, we didn't find a snuke detonator anywhere.
MR. THOMPSON
Mr. Hakeem, where is your son?
MR. HAKEEM
We thought he was at school. He's not at school?
[A clinic nearby. Hillary is up on stirrups while some police and agents look at an X-ray of her abdomen and groin.]
BRIAN
You're doing great, Ms. Clinton.
HILLARY
Do they know how long, Brian? How long before the snuke in my snizz goes off?
BRIAN
They'll find the detonator, Hildog.
AIDE 3
We can't wait for them to find the detonator. If we can get to the bomb, me-maybe we can deactivate it. Can't somebody go and take a look inside Mrs. Clinton's snizz?
EOD LEADER
[part of the bomb squad] I'm not sending any of my men in there.
CHRIS
Are you almost ready to set off the bomb?
VLADIMIR
Everything is set. We have the detonator up and running. [the detonator is shown with its LED readout: 12:34:10... 12:34:11... 12:34:12... 12:34:13... ]
[An interrogation room. A CIA agent grills Mr. Hakeem, with a female agent as witness.]
AGENT 2
Mr. Hakeem, we need to know where your son is!
MR. HAKEEM
I tell you, I do not know.
AGENT 2
[sighs, then leaves the room with the female agent and enters the adjoining control room, where Mr. Thompson is waiting] This is getting us nowhere. If he knows anything, he's not saying.
CARTMAN
Let me have time with him.
FEMALE AGENT
What are you going to do?
CARTMAN
We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him! [removes his cap and goes in] You will tell me where your son is!
MR. HAKEEM
He should be at school! [Cartman walks off and brings back a stool, setting it against Mr. Hakeem's chair. He climbs up and stands on the stool, drops his pants, and starts farting.] Hey!
CARTMAN
[farts] Where is the detonator?!
MR. HAKEEM
Wuh-what detonator are you ta-
CARTMAN
[farts some more, and again, and again] I can do this aaall day.
MR. HAKEEM
[coughs] I don't know anything about a- [Cartman farts a short one, and then a long one that makes Mr. Hakeem turn away] Aawwwwgh [holds his breath, gasps for air and coughs] Stop it! Really!
CARTMAN
You can make it stop!
MR. HAKEEM
[almost weeps] I don't have the- [Cartman farts for a long time, and the female agent turns away from the one-way window]
FEMALE AGENT
Are we just gonna let this go on? [Cartman continues farting]
[Kyle's room, later.]
KYLE
Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay.
STAN
You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling. [CIA agents enter the room quickly with their equipment]
CIA VICE HEAD
Ferris, set up over there. Two of you can take that bed area. [Stan steps down for a better look at the activity]
KYLE
Hey.
CIA VICE HEAD
Donner, take over that station. [points to Kyle. Donner walks over and shoves Kyle off his chair]
KYLE
[stands up] What's going on?
CIA VICE HEAD
This department is being absorbed by Homeland Security!
KYLE
...Homeland Security?
CIA VICE HEAD
Look, your little game of goin' over people's heads is over! You could still work, but from now on you answer to me, you got that?!
FBI LEADER
'Scuse me, who's in charge here?!
CIA VICE HEAD
I am!
FBI LEADER
[more people come in] Yeah well not anymore you're not. This department has just been assigned to the FBI.
CIA VICE HEAD
That's outrageous! On whose orders?!
FBI LEADER
On order of the Secretary of Defense! You had your shot, now I'm in charge!
ATF LEADER
[more people come in] Not anymore you're not! Orders just came down from Central! They want ATF handling this on all fronts! All right people, from now on you're answering to me!
SECRET SERVICE LEADER
[more people come in] Not anymore they're not! Orders from the President: he wants this handled by his staff personally! Now Nelson is in charge.
NELSON
[bursts into the scene] Not anymore I'm not! [everyone else falls silent]
[The interrogation room, later. Cartman walks in with a metal suitcase containing syringes. He takes one out]
MR. HAKEEM
What are you going to do to my wife?!
CARTMAN
Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!
MRS. HAKEEM
We told you: we don't know.
CARTMAN
[whips around and shows them the syringe] Do you know what this is?! [they look at each other, unsure] This... is apple juice. It gives super bad farts. [injects himself with the syringe into the right arm and hops up on the stool next to Mrs. Hakeem]
FEMALE AGENT
Did he just inject himself with apple juice?
CARTMAN
Where is your son?!
MR. HAKEEM
She doesn't know either. [Cartman turns and drops his pants, and farts on Mrs. Hakeem's face]
MRS. HAKEEM
Aaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!
MR. HAKEEM
I mean it! Stop! That is disgusting! Where is your mother?! [a phone rings and the camera zooms in on Mrs. Hakeem's shirt pocket. Cartman turns and reaches into the pocket, pulling out the cell phone]
CARTMAN
Answer it! [holds the phone to Mrs. Hakeem's right ear]
MRS. HAKEEM
Hallo? Hallo Baahir. Where are you? Who it But-ters?
CARTMAN
Butters.
MRS. HAKEEM
Baahir, one of your classmates is keeping us hostage. [Cartman drops the phone and farts a good gust of flatulence against Mrs. Hakeem's face] Aaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah! [Cartman drops off the stool and enters the control room.]
MR. HAKEEM
Ogh! You filthy little rapscallion!
CARTMAN
We got him! I know where he is!
FEMALE AGENT
All right, where? We'll send our people in.
CARTMAN
No no, he's my lead. [opens the suitcase]
MR. THOMPSON
You're not going alone.
CARTMAN
You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is! [gives himself a double injection of apple juice]
[Kyle's room, later. The Secret Service is running the show now.]
CIA LEADER 2
[white hair] All right, people, I'm in charge now and we will find the terrorists. Jarvis, I want you to check for any terrorist chatter on AOL. Marley and Greggs, try searching for nuclear devices on askjeeves.com.
KYLE
Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!
CIA LEADER 2
Are you tellin' me how to do my job?
KYLE
Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.
CIA LEADER 2
Chase, search the name Stolfsky on YouTube and cross-reference it with JDate!
CHASE
Checking.
STAN
Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger!
FEMALE AGENT 2
[with a stack of papers] Sir, these kids are right. We've just received intel that Russian terrorists are believed to be responsible for the threat.
CIA LEADER 2
Where's the intel from?
FEMALE AGENT 2
We just read it on Drudge Report.
KYLE
Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest.
CIA LEADER 2
We do this my way! I'm the one in charge!
KYLE
[he and Stan look at each other] ...Not anymore you're not.
CIA LEADER 2
Oh, snap. [walks off dejected]
[Butters' living room, day. He and Baahir are playing Checkers, and Butters looks like he's winning.]
BUTTERS
[makes his move] Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir. [outside, Cartman runs up to the window and crashes through it.]
CARTMAN
Uuugh! [lies motionless for a few seconds, then gets up]
BUTTERS
Oh hey Eric.
CARTMAN
[walks up to Baahir and grabs him by the collar] Where is the detonator!
BAAHIR
The what?
CARTMAN
You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One!
BAAHIR
Leave me alone! [heads for the front door and walks out. Cartman follows him] Upta!
BUTTERS
[watches them leave] Hey, I was about to win!
[The sidewalk. Cartman chases Baahir down the street.]
CARTMAN
Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you! [A black van pulls up next to them and the side door slides open. Three real terrorists jump out and aim their semiautomatics at the two boys]
TERRORIST #1
[olive-colored] Get in the van! [Both boys are scared, but Cartman backs away]
CARTMAN
Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore.
TERRORIST #1
[they aim their guns at Cartman] Get in the van!
[The clinic.]
AIDE 3
That's it! We don't have a choice anymore! Somebody is going to have to go in, and try to disarm the snuke manually!
EOD LEADER
No, it's too dangerous! That snatch has not seen action in over 30 years! It could be toxic!
BRIAN
[overhearing it] I'll do it! I'll check out Ms. Clinton's snizz.
[The terrorists' hideout, 12:40:27 and counting. Vladimir has Cartman and Baahir tied up in chairs]
CARTMAN
Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!
VLADIMIR
You called and warned the government of our plans! What you don't know is that we are simply mercenaries! We were paid to set up the snuke so that the real enemy of America could attack!
CARTMAN
That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading.
VLADIMIR
[aims the semiautomatic at him] Do you really think Muslims are behind this terrorist threat?!
CARTMAN
Uhh yes, of course?
VLADIMIR
America had other enemies before the Muslims, you know. Who is America's oldest enemy?
CARTMAN
The Russians?
VLADIMIR
Before that.
CARTMAN
The Germans?
VLADIMIR
Before that.
CARTMAN
The Germans again?
VLADIMIR
Before that! I am talking about the oldest threat to America! The greatest enemy America has ever known!
CARTMAN
You can't possible mean...?
[The ocean blue. A fleet of British ships is sailing towards the United States, but these ships are from another era. The men are dressed in uniforms of the Revolutionary War era - as Red Coats]
CAPTAIN
Two hundred years we've waited. Finally. We will get those traitors to the Crown! [gets a call and answers it on his cell phone] Yes, Your Majesty?
QUEEN ELIZABETH II
The Russians are ready to set off the diversion. Full sail.
CAPTAIN
Full sail, Your Majesty?
[12:43:57 and counting.]
[12:47:18 and Hillary is back on stirrups (upper left picture). 12:47:19 and Kyle is back at his computer (upper right picture). 12:47:20 and Cartman is shown struggling in his seat (lower right picture). 12:47:21 and the British fleet is shown (lower left picture).]
[The clinic. The aide, doctor, and other officials are behind protective glass in a booth. Brian is dressed in a Hazmat suit and gas mask]
AIDE 3
All right, Brian, this is it. Get in there and see if you can disarm the snuke in Ms. Clinton's snatch.
BRIAN
[diving in slowly, has radio communication with the booth] All right. I'm nearing her snizz now.
EOD LEADER
God help him.
AIDE 3
What do you see, Brian?
BRIAN
It's dark... cold...
AIDE 3
You're doing fine, Brian. Get as close as you can... Y-you have to look inside the snizz.
BRIAN
Uh, uh, all right, I'm looking. Yes, I see... I see the device! [begins to cough]
AIDE 3
You're doin' great, Brian. Hang in there.
BRIAN
There's um, metal housing... some kind of three-pronged triggering mechanism that... Wait there's... there's something else here! There's something... [static fills the transmission and the aide tries to restore communication]
AIDE 3
Say again, Brian.
BRIAN
[amid heavy static] There's something perched on the snuke's coil... Oh God, it's looking at me!
EOD LEADER
[takes control] Brian, get out of there!
BRIAN
Wha... what are you?! I have no qualm with you! Stay back! Stay back I- agh! Aaagh!
EOD LEADER
Brian? Brian, what's happening?
BRIAN
It's... eating my head! It's eating my head! [the camera zooms back to show his body gyrating helplessly, then being spit out by Mrs. Clinton's snizz]
HILLARY
Hoh my!
[Kyle's bedroom. He's at his computer as agents discuss things behind him.]
KYLE
I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British.
FEMALE AGENT 2
The British?
AGENT 4
Loyalist Red Coats!
CHASE
Sir, I found the Russian's eHarmony account! It does list an address in South Park!

All right! MapQuest the address!

I'll use Google Maps. It has live traffic.

Sir, we have the terrorists' location. IM'ing you now.
[The terrorists' hideout.]
VLADIMIR
[warmly shakes a terrorist's hand] It was good knowing you, comrade.
BAAHIR
Please. Think about what you are doing. The British are just using you; you're going to die.
VLADIMIR
Yes, but we will be rich.
AGENT
[outside] Left flank, prig prang and clear! Go go go! [the doors to the hideout fly open and CIA agents pour in, with the CIA Vice Head supervising the riad]
MR. THOMPSON
[last to enter, gun drawn] The game is over! Get down on the ground!
VLADIMIR
How did they find us?
MR. THOMPSON
We know about everything! Your diversion to help the Red Coats is over!
VLADIMIR
It doesn't matter. The detonator is on a timer. You are too late! In three minutes! [the camera quickly moves to the detonator: 12:56:57 and counting. Four seconds later the power is shut off] What the hell?!
AGENT
The power went out!
MR. THOMPSON
Well so then what time is it? [the power returns and the detonator's timer is reset to a blinking 12:00:00]
VLADIMIR
Oh crap.
MR. THOMPSON
Take 'em down! [the agents fire away. One after one, terrorists go down, dead. Vladimir climbs a wooden ladder to the hideout's roof]
VLADIMIR
No! I don't want to die without being paid! [an agent shoots him down, he hits the floor and blows up. CIA agents remove the ropes from Cartman and Baahir]
MR. THOMPSON
[places a call] The detonator is secured, general. You are cleared to proceed.
[The ocean blue. The British fleet continues towards the United State. American jets fly over them and prepare to fire]
CAPTAIN
The Rebel Americans know of our attack?!
SOLDIER
How?
CAPTAIN
Fire at will! [the soldiers quickly aim and fire. The bullets have no effect, as the jets simply unload their bombs on the ships and sink them.]
[The Royal Palace, the Queen's throne room. She's seated at her throne and gets a call. She gets the phone from one of her servants]
QUEEN ELIZABETH II
Yes?
CAPTAIN
Your Majesty, the attack has failed. We were... unable to end the American Revolution.
QUEEN ELIZABETH II
I see. [sets the phone down, takes a loaded gun to her mouth, and shoots her brains out. She falls forward and hits the ground, dead.]
[South Park, at Long Road Shipping, the apparent hideout. Everyone stands in the street.]
MR. THOMPSON
[walking into view] Well, looks like we saved our country from British rule once again.
KYLE
Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us.
CARTMAN
Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology.
BAAHIR
Really?
CARTMAN
Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool.
KYLE
...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!
CARTMAN
But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?
KYLE
...Maybe. [looks away]
CARTMAN
Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America.
KYLE
...That is so missing the point.
CARTMAN
Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!
KYLE
The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-
CARTMAN
Yes or no, Kyle?!
KYLE
No! ...Not... not like you're saying.
CARTMAN
But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right? [Baahir's parents approach, looking around at all the activity in front of their house]
MR. HAKEEM
Baahir! Get away from that disgusting child! Get back home and start packing your things! We are leaving this whole intolerant country! [Mr. Hakeem nudges Baahir forward, and the family leaves]
BUTTERS
Awwwww.
CARTMAN
Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh? [raises his own hand] That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice.
End of The Snuke


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Stan starts asking his Dad some tough questions about the origins of Easter. The answers lead to an ancient and mysterious secret society created in the Middle Ages to protect the secret of the Easter Bunny.

script:Fantastic Easter Special

[The Marsh house, outside, night.]
RANDY
[inside] ...In my Easter Bonnet, with all the frills upon it, I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade.
[The Marsh house, dining room table. The Marshes are decorating Easter eggs. Stan dips a hard-boiled egg into a glass of green dye. Marvin spins his slowly in a small lathe. Randy finishes one up and shows it off.]
RANDY
Look at that one, huh? Half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker. I'm good. [sets it into the egg tray]
STAN
Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?
RANDY
Wha... what do you mean, "Why do we do this?" It's Easter!
STAN
Right, so, why do we color eggs? [Shelly makes a cross face]
RANDY
Wulll, ssso that the Easter bunny can hide them.
STAN
Yeah, but why?
RANDY
Stanley, Easter celebrates the day that Jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins.
STAN
So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?
RANDY
That's right.
STAN
You don't see the missteps in logic with that? [Randy is unfazed, while Shelly, Sharon, and Marvin look at Stan disapprovingly] Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information.
RANDY
Stanley, just dye your Goddamned eggs!
STAN
[leaves his seat] I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!
RANDY
What is wrong with him?!
SHARON
Well, he's just getting older, Randy. Maybe he's figured out the Easter bunny isn't real. [continues dying her egg. Randy slams his palms down on the table angrily. Sharon is taken aback.]
RANDY
[rising] You know so little! [leaves]
[South Park Mall, day. The Easter bunny has a big Easter display at the mall where he sits in a chair taking requests for Easter gifts. A line of kids is waiting. In that line are Stan, Clyde, Red, Kevin, Craig, Heidi, Millie, Bill, Tolkien, Jimmy, and a few little brothers and sisters]
CARTMAN
And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!
MALL BUNNY
Ahh, don't you think that's-
CARTMAN
Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!
AIDE
Smile! [takes a picture and Cartman hops off]
CARTMAN
Bye, Easter bunny! [leaves]
MALL BUNNY
[watches him leave] Oh my God. [Stan walks up and sits on the bunny's lap. The bunny notices]
STAN
All right, can you explain to me what's going on?
MALL BUNNY
Huh?
STAN
What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross? [no reply] It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times? [nudges him] Answer me!
MALL BUNNY
Look, kid ahh, I'm j-, I'm just a guy in a costume.
STAN
I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!
MALL BUNNY
Huhuh, Easter's just Easter. Just, just go with it, kid.
STAN
No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this! [hops off and walks away]
MALL BUNNY
I need a break. Can I have a break? [he gets it and walks up to some payphones nearby. He picks one up and dials a number] We have a problem. Somebody's onto us. Yeah, he's askin' a lot of questions. Only a matter of time before he finds out what Easter's really about. Yes, I understand what must be done. Call the others. [hangs up the phone]
[Stan's neighborhood, day. Stan is walking home with determination. He walks by a bus stop where someone is reading a newspaper. The newspaper drops down a bit and the reader is another Easter bunny. Stan stops and looks over his shoulder and the newspaper rises to its former position again. Stan walks on, and the bunny rises a few seconds later to follow him. Stan notices and begins to run. A few seconds later he notices three more Easter bunnies facing him. With bunnies behind him and in front, he runs across the street to escape, but a car stops just before hitting him and two more bunnies step out of the car. He gets to the other side and continues running in the same direction as before, with the six bunnies chasing him. He makes it home and closes the front door behind him. The bunnies reach the door and start pounding on it]
[The Marsh house, inside. Stan runs upstairs.]
STAN
Mom? Dad? [reaches the second floor] Anybody home?
RANDY
[voice only] Not now, Stanley, I'm on the toilet! [Stan runs to the restroom door and pounds on it]
STAN
Dad! You've gotta help me! [looks around]
RANDY
Hang on, I'm taking a crap.
STAN
Dad! There's Easter bunnies chasing me!
RANDY
What?
STAN
They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want! [hears the front door breaking open] They're coming in! Dad, open the door! [the bathroom door opens and Randy looks out, wearing some bunny ears and a bunny snout with buck teeth.] Dad?
RANDY
We... need to talk, Stan. [the Easter bunnies run up the stairs] Ih, it's okay guys.
GRAY HARE
Randy?
RANDY
Yeah. 'Cause it turns out the kid we're after is my son.
PURPLE HARE
Ohhh.
RANDY
Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here.
[Stan's room. Randy explains things.]
RANDY
I wanted to keep this from you, Stan. I really wanted to wait until you were older but... you just had to keep asking questions!
STAN
Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!
RANDY
We have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us. [turns to face him] We are all part of a secret society, Stan. A very ancient, very important society of men who follow the way of the Rabbit, and protect the secret of the Easter bunny. We are called... the Hare Club For Men.
STAN
[not impressed, but curious] Does Mom know about this?
RANDY
Duh, it's the Hare Club For Men. Chicks wouldn't understand.
STAN
I don't understand!
RANDY
I belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years! Our identities have to be protected!
STAN
Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?
RANDY
Stan, you don't seem to understand how serious this is! The secret of Easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world!
STAN
So what is the secret of Easter?
RANDY
I can't tell you. You have to be allowed into the Society first, but... but perhaps... it's time.
[Randy's car, night. He and Stan drive along a secluded road. Stan has a bag over his head so he doesn't see where they're going.]
RANDY
I always knew this day would come, when my son would be brought into the society. Reminds me of the day I was brought in by my father.
STAN
Grandpa's in it too?
RANDY
Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning.
STAN
Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?
RANDY
You aren't a member yet. You can't know where our secret meetings take place. We're going to a distant location, an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away.
STAN
You mean the old Galveston Lodge? [Randy's taken aback at Stan's memory and so thinks about what to do next. After a while, he decides to remove the bag]
RANDY
Dammit.
[Galveston Lodge, night. Hares from all around gather inside. T.H.C.F.M. The lodge is guarded by two large golden hares]
HARE 1
Hey Bill.
HARE 2
Evenin' Marcus.
HARE 3
Heh heh hey, look at you!
HARE 4
Hey everybody.
[Galveston Lodge, inside. Hares mingle and chat]
HARE 5
Stan Marsh, welcome! You must be very excited.
STAN
Must I?
MARVIN
There he is! There's my grandson!
STAN
Hi Grandpa.
MARVIN
I'm proud of ya, Billy.
STAN
...Stan.
[Galveston Lodge, induction ceremony. Randy places a strip of white fur on Stan's shoulders. The purple Hare dips an egg in a glass lavender dye and rings the bell. The gray Hare steps up, dips his egg in yellow dye and rings the bell. This continues. Later on, a gavel is sounded and the Hares turn left with lit candles.]
PINK HARE
Tonight, we determine if a new member is worthy of protecting the Secret. Bring out... the rabbit.
HARES
Sanctum Piter oteum, Deus ore uneum.
Hippitus hoppitus reus homine.
In suspiratoreum, lepus in re sanctum.
[two Hares carry a white rabbit forward in a gilded cage]
Hippitus hoppitus reus Domine.
[they set the rabbit before the Pink Hare and everyone genuflects... except for Stan. Randy looks up and has him genuflect as well]
PINK HARE
All hail the cute rabbit, Snowball!
HARES
Hail Snowball. [all rise as the Pink Hare approaches Stan]
PINK HARE
Stan Marsh, are you ready to hear the secret of Easter?
STAN
Yeah.
RANDY
Are you sure, son? Once you hear the secret, you will be bound to The Hare Club For Men forever.
STAN
Yeah, I wanna know already.
PINK HARE
Very well. At the Last Supper, Jesus Christ met with his 12 Disciples. It was there that- [interrupted by breaking windows and ninjas pouring in]
GRAY HARE
They found us! [the other Hares arm themselves]
WHITE HARE
[with rainbow vest] Protect Snowball! [a door is turned down, and a ninja, a monk, and a layman enter the lodge. Another door breaks down and another monk enters with three ninjas]
BROWN HARE
They're everywhere! [Hares and ninja battle each other, killing each other as Stan watches]
RANDY
[approaches Stan with Snowball] Come on, we've gotta go! [a ninja spots him and quickly fires an arrow into his left leg. He stumbles] Stan, take Snowball and get out of here!
STAN
Where am I supposed to go?
RANDY
Just get out of here! [Stan turns around and heads for the entrance. A ninja comes up behind him, but Randy grabs the ninjas leg and holds on, forcing the ninja to fall. The ninja tries to kick Randy off]
LAYMAN
Where is the rabbit?!
[Galveston Lodge, outside. Stan runs into a small woods nearby, but he hears car doors, so he goes back to see what's going on. The ninjas and laymen are rounding up the wounded Hares.]
HARE 6
Where are you taking us?
HARE 7
No! I'm not goin' anywhere! [the layman walks up and shoot him in the head, and he falls.]
STAN
Jesus Christ! [a monk has Randy restrained]
LAYMAN
Who did you give the rabbit to?! [slaps Randy, Randy spits back. The layman punches Randy in the stomach and has him rounded up with the others] Search the area! The boy could not have gotten far!
STAN
Oh no... [looks around, then runs off]
[Kyle's house, night. Kyle is at the dining room table doing fingerpaints of Stars of David for Passover. The doorbell rings and he goes to answer it. Stan is at the entrance gasping for air and carrying Snowball. He's a bit unkempt.]
STAN
Help.
KYLE
What happened?
STAN
My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.
KYLE
...I'm kind of finger painting right now.
STAN
[enters anyway] Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me! [turns around and fires off a few questions] Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?
KYLE
Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea.
[A dark place. Randy is laying on the floor, the arrow removed from his leg. He stirs, coughs, and sits up. He's in an old large jail cell with the surviving Hares]
RANDY
Nelson. [crawls towards him] Nelson? Nelson, say something.
NELSON
[reclining against a cage wall] My legs. I... I think they're broken.
RANDY
Nelson, do you know where we are? Where did they take us?
NELSON
Don't know... we traveled for hours... kept blacking out... [coughs. Randy lets go and crawls back, but sees someone standing before him]
RANDY
You...
[A mansion, night. Stan and Kyle arrive and knock on its front door. A butler answers the door]
KYLE
Hi, we'd like to speak to a [reads the name from a slip of paper] Professor Teabag? [Stan is still carrying Snowball]
BUTLER
What is it in regard to? [the professor appears at the far end with a walking stick]
KYLE
The history of Easter.
TEABAG
[walks slowly towards the boys] Sorry boys, it's a little late for me to be giving lectures. [turns around and walks away]
STAN
Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men? [the professor stops and turns around]
TEABAG
The Keepers? [walks towards them] The Guardians of the Secret?
STAN
[the butler steps aside] My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow.
TEABAG
Come on in. [smiles]
[Teabag's study. He leads the boys in and begins]
TEABAG
The Hare Club For Men has been around for centuries. One of its most famous members was Leonardo da Vinci. [on a large widescreen TV is a picture of The Last Supper] Behold the Last Supper. The dinner Christ had with his disciples the night before he was crucified. What food do you see on the table?
STAN
Just bread...
TEABAG
Really? Look to Jesus's right. [zooms in and pans to the lower left, then zooms in on an oval shape] The food which is a little different color than the others.
KYLE
It kind of looks like... an egg.
TEABAG
Yes. The egg marks the secret. It lies directly in front of... [zooms out and a bright trace appears around the disciple behind the egg] Saint Peter.
KYLE
Who is Saint Peter?
STAN
He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope.
TEABAG
Eggsactly. But there's something the Church didn't tell you. In actuality, Peter wasn't a man at all. Saint Peter... was a rabbit. [the boys say nothing for a few seconds]
KYLE
[flatly] Peter Rabbit.
TEABAG
Of course, the Church wouldn't allow da Vinci to paint Peter as a rabbit, so he painted him as a man, but left clues. Look closely.
KYLE
I don't see it.
TEABAG
Look closelier. [zooms in]
STAN
He looks like a guy.
TEABAG
Look more closelier. [zooms in further, and a pair of rabbit ears appear on Peter's head] With laser technology we can look beneath the paint, the way da Vinci originally painted it. [Peter disappears from the picture and a white rabbit appears next to the egg which was in front of Peter] That... is Saint Peter. [Stan jumps a bit] The original Pope of Christianity.
KYLE
I don't believe it.
TEABAG
Proof is everywhere. Look at the Pope's hat. [a picture of Benedict XVI appears] It makes no sense, except that it was originally designed... [a picture of a rabbit slides in next to that of the pope, and Teabag moves the hat from the pope to the rabbit] for a rabbit.
STAN
[looks at the professor] But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church?
TEABAG
Because Jesus knew no one man could speak for everyone in a religion. Men can be intolerant; rabbits are pure. But the Catholic Church buried the truth, put a man in charge, and the Hare Club For Men has been decorating eggs ever since to keep the secret in da Vinci's painting alive.
KYLE
So... the Vatican took Stan's dad?
[The Vatican, night. Thunder and lightning roll through the sky. At St. Peter's Basilica, the Pope approaches one of the doors with a monk behind him. The Hare Club for Men is waiting to meet him]
POPE BENEDICT
You dare to mock God by telling people St. Peter was a rabbit?
RANDY
You monster! You have no right to wear that hat!
POPE BENEDICT
Trying to tell people that St. Peter was a rabbit is blasphemy! You must admit you are wrong or burn in hell!
RANDY
It's saying stupid things like that that made Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge.
LAYMAN
I'm sorry I couldn't bring you the rabbit, Your Holiness, but they know where it is!
POPE BENEDICT
The rabbit you call Snowball is a threat to Christ's Church. Where is the rabbit?!
RANDY
I don't know! And even if I did know... well, I'd probably tell you because I don't wanna be here anymore.
LAYMAN
Take him to be tortured!
POPE BENEDICT
Tortured, huh, but Bill, all this... torturing and ninjas, it just doesn't seem very Christian.
BILL
[the layman] You asked for the help of the American Catholic League, let us do our job! Take him! [a cardinal and a ninja open the door, take Randy in, and escort him to his torture.]
RANDY
No! No, you bunny-hating bastards! Don't do this!
[Teabag's mansion. Stan and Kyle are still looking at the Last Supper. Stan turns around.]
STAN
I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?
TEABAG
I believe Snowball must be a direct descendant of St. Peter himself, and therefor the true heir of the pope's throne. [the butler is shown polishing a steel vase as some ninjas make their way towards the study]
BUTLER
[notices some ninjas behind him] Mr. Teabag! Get out! [one of the ninjas runs his sword through the butler's head and out his face, killing him]
STAN
They found me!
TEABAG
Boys, get out of here! [takes them to a window and opens it] Head to the woods! I'll try to buy you some time. [Stan and Kyle climb down the ladder he's prepared for them]
BILL
[off screen] Check upstairs! [the professor picks up a box of... PEEPS] Upstairs clear! Try the office! [Teabag takes the peeps to a microwave oven nearby and opens the oven's door. He puts the peeps in and sets the timer to 15 seconds. Behind him, two ninjas break into the study]
NINJA 1
In here! [Teabag closes his eyes]
NINJA 2
What's that? [the peeps begin to expand quickly and fill up the oven. Four seconds left, three, two, one...]
NINJA 1
PEEEEPS! [the oven explodes, spewing peeps everywhere and killing Teabag. Stan and Kyle are running away when they turn to see the whole mansion being destroyed by peep marshmallow]
KYLE
So what now?
STAN
If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.
KYLE
You aren't just gonna hand Snowball over?
STAN
What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us! [softly] Wait... unless... maybe there is. [hands Snowball to Kyle] Here, hold this. [walks some distance away from Kyle and prays] Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help. [waits for a long time, then peeks with his right eye, then with both, but there's no sign of Jesus. He opens his eyes wide, as normal, and looks up. Kyle looks down at Snowball]
KYLE
I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket.
[A news special comes on: World News, Easter Vigil coverage.]
ANNOUNCER
Live, from the Vatican, it's our Easter Vigil coverage.
REPORTER
As Holy Saturday comes to an end, the Easter vigil at the Vatican begins. Thousand have turned out to hear the Pope and celebrate the Resurrection. [visitors whip out their cameras and take pictures] For this Easter vigil the Pope is also showing his divine grace by feeding the poor, with a massive rabbit stew. [two chefs stand atop ladders next to a huge cauldron, slicing up ingredients. Bill and a ninja bring in a bunny to toss into the cauldron]
VIOLET HARE
NOOO! Noo! No, don't put m- [he's thrown in and is boiled to death] AAAAAAAAAAH!
POPE BENEDICT
Bill, this seems extreme.
BILL
The child who has the rabbit has to know that we are willing to kill the hostages if he doesn't hand it over.
ITALIAN CARDINAL
Your Holiness, a child has arrived with a the rabbit!
BILL
Ya see? [the three leave to meet this boy]
[St. Peter's Basilica. Stan and Kyle walk towards the alter with Snowball. Randy greets them as he's headed towards his torture]
RANDY
Oh thank God! Hand it over, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit!
POPE BENEDICT
Yes, hand it over!
STAN
First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!
POPE BENEDICT
We promise.
BILL
We swear it, on the cross.
RANDY
Just hand over the bunny, Stan!
STAN
Okay, fine. [a cardinal takes Snowball from Stan, and Randy is released]
RANDY
[reaching his son] Stanley, why did you do that? I would have proudly died for that rabbit.
STAN
You said "hand over the bunny."
RANDY
No! That is not the way we're remembering it!
BILL
Take them into custody! [ninjas come in and put cuffs on Randy and the boys]
STAN
Hey, what the hell!
POPE BENEDICT
Bill, we have zeh rabbit, it's all we need.
BILL
Don't be soft, Your Holiness! These "whores" must be punished in front of everyone!
KYLE
You swore on the cross, fatso!
BILL
Yeah. Too bad for you... it was a double cross! [cackles]
RANDY
Oh, we should've seen that coming!
POPE BENEDICT
Bill, I'm not sure that double-crossing people is very Christian.
BILL
It is what Christ would've wanted!
JESUS
[off-screen] Who are you to say that?! [the clerics look surprised. Jesus approaches them from the entrance of the basilica]
POPE BENEDICT
It... can't be.
STAN, KYLE
Jesus! [as Jesus walks, clergymen genuflect and bow to him]
SINGER
He is risen. He is risen. Let the voices sing his praises on this holy day. He is risen!
CARDINAL
Jesus, we thought you died. In Iraq.
JESUS
I have the power of resurrection. Or have you forgotten? You all seem to have forgotten a lot of things.
STAN
Jesus, you did answer my prayer! [grins]
JESUS
Actually, I was answering the prayer of Nick Donovan.
PURPLE HARE 2
Ohh, that's me Neato!
JESUS
This is exactly why I put a rabbit in charge of the Church, Benedictus! Because men are so easily led astray. St. Peter was a rabbit. And a rabbit should be Pope.
BILL
Kill him!
POPE BENEDICT
What?!
BILL
He goes against the Church. He must die!
POPE BENEDICT
All right, that does it, Bill. I'm pretty sure that killing Jesus is not very Christian.
BILL
You are soft! Weak! You leave me no choice: take them! [two ninjas apprehend Jesus]
JESUS
What are you doing?! [two others arrest Benedict]
POPE BENEDICT
I am the Pope!
BILL
You are no longer able to fulfill your duties to the Lord! [removes the papal tiara and places it on his own head] The Easter vigil will go on as planned! [walks to a clear spot with Snowball, so all could see.] Every Hare Club member, young and old, will watch as their precious savior dies!
JESUS
What is your problem, guy?!
BILL
Lock up those two Jews! [referring to Kyle and Jesus] We'll deal with them later.
STAN
No! No! [Stan and Randy are taken away in one direction, Kyle and Jesus in another, Benedict in still another]
[Easter Vigil coverage continues.]
REPORTER
A strange turn of events here at the Vatican: Pope Benedictus has stepped down, ushering the new era of... Pope Bill Donohue
[The platform outside St. Peter's, moments later. Bill presides over the rabbit stew.]
BILL
My people! This Easter I'm gonna start by making our rabbit stew ten times meatier! [the crowds cheer loudly]
RANDY
No! Listen! We aren't rabbits! [a ninja punches him in the stomach] Oof.
[A dungeon cell. Jesus and Kyle are in it. Jesus has a file in his right hand and is furiously sawing away at a chain by the cell's entrance. Across the hall from him is Benedict XVI in his own cell.]
POPE BENEDICT
Forgive me, Jesus.
JESUS
We'll never get out in time to stop him!
KYLE
Don't you have any superpowers?
JESUS
[throws the file away] Not as a mortal. Only in death. Wait. That's it. We have no choice, Kyle. You're going to have to kill me.
KYLE
What?
JESUS
Stab me with this. [brings out a small dagger] If I die I can resurrect outside the bars.
KYLE
N-no way! Do it yourself.
JESUS
Suicide is blasphemy. There's no choice here, Kyle!
KYLE
Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.
JESUS
Just make it quick. [kneels down and hands the dagger to Kyle] Through the neck. I'll arise again immediately.
KYLE
[looks at the dagger in dismay] Don't make me do this.
JESUS
My son, there is no time! Do it!
KYLE
Eric Cartman can never know about this.
JESUS
I understand. And Kyle, happy Easter.
KYLE
Happy Easter, Jesus. [stabs Jesus in the neck, as ordered]
JESUS
Awgh! [walks around for a few seconds, groaning and shedding blood here and there. He falls forward and his halo rolls away with a metallic "clink"]
KYLE
...Jesus?
[Back at the platform, Bill continues his speech.]
BILL
Behold, no longer will Easter be about bunnies and colored eggs! Kill the rabbit! [a cardinal holds Snowball over the cauldron]
CARDINAL
Sorry, little bunny.
STAN
Snowball! [now dressed in rabbits ears and snout like Randy. A bright light appears near one of the obelisks in the center of the piazza, and Jesus' figure appears in the light. The light fades and Jesus is all alone. The crowd oohs and aahs]
TOURIST
Jesus?
JESUS
Stop! That rabbit is of holy descent!
BILL
Why won't you go away?!
JESUS
One man cannot be the voice of the Church!
BILL
Enough of this blasphemy! I'm the Pope now! That means I am the voice of God!
JESUS
Not anymore. I'm removing you from your position. [brings out a black and yellow glaive, then presses a button in the middle to release the blades, as in a switchblade. He throws it towards Bill, who runs from it. It levels off and slices through Bill's midsection and returns to Jesus. Jesus strikes a pose and catches it with his right hand. The blades disappear into their sheaths. Jesus brings out some sunglasses with his left hand and puts them on, still maintaining the dramatic pose.]
CROWD
YAAAY!
STAN
All right Jesus!
[St. Peter's Basilica, day. The sun is bright and the sky is blue, the basilica is decked out with streamers and Easter wreaths. White smoke rises above and behind the basilica, indicating a new pope]
CROWD
Sanctum Piter oteum, Deus ore uneum.
Hippitus hoppitus reus homine.
CARDINAL
Your Holiness, what should we tell the world about how to run their lives? [Snowball now sits on the papal throne. Snowball, having no human vocal cords, says nothing] It isn't saying anything.
ITALIAN CARDINAL
Yes, just as a-Jesus intended it.
RANDY
Stanley, I'm so proud of you. You've learned so very much this Easter.
STAN
Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.
RANDY
That's my boy.
CROWD
[in the background] In suspiratoreum, lepus in re sanctum.
Hippitus hoppitus Deus Domine.

synopsis:When the bar Mrs. Garrison hangs out in is about to be taken over by Persian club owners, she fights to save the one place that lets her be the woman she is.

script:D-Yikes!

[South Park Elementary, Friday during the day, Mrs. Garrison's class. The kids enter the classroom]
MRS. GARRISON
[enters and drops her books on her desk in anger] Everyone, sit down and shut the fuck up! God damn it! [some papers flutter off the top of the stack. She turns and erases some addition problems she had up on the blackboard earlier] Stupid ass man! They're all the same! [Stan crosses his arms and buries his head in them. He's the only student to do so]
KYLE
Oh God, here we go again.
MRS. GARRISON
All men care about is sex! I spent two hours getting ready for that stupid date! And when the bastard checks out my body, he just says, "Hey, did you used to be a guy or somethin'?" I'm a woman now, so what's it matter?!
STAN
Uh oh, this isn't good.
MRS. GARRISON
[gets into Stan's face] Did I say something to you, sugartits?!
STAN
[frightened] No ma'am.
MRS. GARRISON
[heads back to the blackboard] You boys make me sick! You're well on your way to being men, who only think with their penises! I am assigning all of you weekend homework! You are going to read Hemmingway's book, "The Old Man and the Sea"!
CARTMAN
Have you lost your mind?
STAN
Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend.
MRS. GARRISON
Oh, that's too bad, dude. Maybe if you boys could keep your penises in your pants once in a while you'd get more done!
BUTTERS
But Teacher, my penis never slips out of my pants. Eh-except sometimes when I'm wearin' pajamas.
MRS. GARRISON
If you do not have an essay written on Monday, then you will fail! Is that clear?!
[South Park Elementary, after school, outside. The students exit and head home.]
STAN
Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay?
KYLE
Our whole weekend is shot.
KENNY
(What the hell are we going to do?!)
CARTMAN
You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay.
STAN
We don't?
CARTMAN
No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.
[Moovit Truck Rental, in the industrial section of South Park, Friday afternoon. A group of Mexican day laborers stand around waiting for work. Cartman and friends approach them. And Cartman whistles]
CARTMAN
¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? ¿Sí? ¿Trabajo?
LABORER 1
[wearing baseball cap with flag] Yeis.
LABORER 2
[wearing cap backwards] We looking work, sí.
CARTMAN
[holds his arms out in open embrace] Okay, listen up, Mexicans. We need you to read [whips out the book from his back pocket] "The Old Man and the Sea" for us. Comprende? "E Old Mand Y La Mer".
LABORER 2
Okay.
LABORER 1
Sure.
LABORER 3
[wearing NY baseball cap] Okay.
LABORER 4
[wearing gray baseball cap] Yeah.
CARTMAN
Here. We need you to work together, read the book and write four essays, comprende? La samaraisia.
LABORER 2
Okay no problem. That's no problem.
LABORER 1
Yeah, we can do that.
LABORER 5
Sí, la samaraisia.
CARTMAN
Okay, gracias.
STAN AND KYLE
Gracias.
STAN
Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that.
CARTMAN
Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans around totally kicks fuckin' ass.
[Curves, a fitness and weight loss center, day. Mrs. Garrison is running hard on a treadmill, taking out her frustrations.]
MRS. GARRISON
They can all rot in hell! Who needs men anyway?! They're God damned arrogant self-centered assholes is what they are! [a woman walks up and gets on the treadmill to her right]
WOMAN
Are you okay, hon?
MRS. GARRISON
I just hate men is all. It's like all they care about is how hot you look!
WOMAN
Yeah, I've never been into men. That's why I work out here. Since it's women only we don't get oogled at or feel self-conscious.
MRS. GARRISON
Tell me about it! I can't even stretch at a normal gym without some guy trying to stare down my vage.
WOMAN
I'm Allyson.
MRS. GARRISON
Oh, I'm Janet. Janet Garrison. Sorry I'm so pissed off.
ALLYSON
No, I like it. You seem like a very strong woman.
JANET
Yeah, I've been told that.
ALLYSON
How come I've never seen you down at the girl bar?
JANET
Girl bar? I never even knew there was such a place.
ALLYSON
Oh you'd love it. It's the only bar in town where women like us can hang out and be ourselves. It's called "Lebow".
[Les Bos, night, 13280. "Lebow" is the French pronunciation of Les Bos. Allyson and Janet approach the front door. Allyson leads Janet in.]
ALLYSON
Hi Linda, hi Kate.
WOMAN 2
Hey Allyson.
WOMAN 3
Who's the new girl?
WOMAN 2
Allyson always goes for the butch ones.
ALLYSON
[approaches the bar with Janet] Hey Nell. What's up, Tracy?
JANET
Oowhat a great place. All the girls here seem to know each other.
ALLYSON
Yeah. Well, most of the girls here have done each other. [gets a glass and a beer and pours the beer into the glass.]
JANET
He-yeah. Done what?
ALLYSON
You know. [smiles] Had sex. [passes the beer to Janet and orders a second beer for herself.]
JANET
[looks around] Oh my God, this is a lesbian bar?
ALLYSON
Yeah. I... thought you understood that.
JANET
Oh jeez. [fans herself]
ALLYSON
I'm sorry. I thought you knew what "girl bar" meant.
JANET
But I'm not a- ...whoa! Who-o-o-o-oa. [moves away]
[Les Bos, bathroom. Janet is washing her face.]
ALLYSON
Janet, I'm really sorry. It's just that at the gym you said you didn't like being with men, so I thought you were a-
JANET
I don't like being with men! They're perverted selfish pigs!
ALLYSON
Have you... never even... thought... of being... with another woman?
JANET
Oho goodness no! Of course I haven't. I mean... really I don't even understand how two women can make love. I mean un, unless they just kinda [demonstrates with her fingers] scissor or something.
ALLYSON
There are a lot of ways to make love, Janet.
JANET
I guess I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little ...titillated.
ALLYSON
Could I... maybe kiss you? [gets close, but Janet turns and walks away]
JANET
Oh, this is wrong! You're another woman; it doesn't make sense!
ALLYSON
Is it wrong, Janet? Let your inhibitions go. Let's just have fun tonight. [they hold hands] No commitments. [Allyson lets go] Just fun. [she grabs her hand and they close in for the kiss]
[Janet's bedroom, later. Janet and Allyson are going at it in bed.]
JANET
Oh yeah, scissor! Yeah, scissor me Allyson!
ALLYSON
Janet, you're crazy!
JANET
Oh, this is hot scissoring! Ohh! Scissor me timbers!
[South Park, Monday, just before dawn. The boys walk over to Moovit Trucking to meet up with the laborers and get their finished essays.]
KYLE
They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!
CARTMAN
They'll be done. [whistles to get the laborers' attention.] ¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? [the laborers approach] All right, did you read the book?
LABORERS
Sí, sí.
KYLE
What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us.
LABORER 1
Eet starts there the old man, and his job is to catch the feesh, so he get in the boht, to try and catch feesh.
LABORER 2
Saw he catch the feesh, but the feesh is very strong, so the old man, cannot reel in the feesh.
LABORER 5
So then he fight the feesh. Some more. And he finally catch the feesh.
KYLE
He catches the feesh so, then he can make money.
LABORER 1
No, because on the way home, the sharks come and eat the feesh. And so, he no make money. [all five laborers take off their hats and put them against their chests in mourning]
STAN
That's it, that's the whole story?
LABORER 1
Sí.
CARTMAN
All right, did you write the four essays?
LABORER 1
Sí, we all wrote essays for you. [the laborers put their caps back on]
THE BOYS
[all thumbs up] All right!
CARTMAN
Okay, let's have 'em.
LABORER 4
Have what?
KYLE
You said you all wrote essays.
LABORER 1
Well, my ese lives in Miami. I wrote to him like you said, but I don't think he got the letter yet.
LABORER 2
I wrote my ese in Albuquerque.
LABORER 5
I wrote three eses: my ese back home, my ese in Denver, and my ese in Glenwood even wrote me back. "Thanks for writing me, ese." [the boys are stunned]
KENNY
(Uh oh...)
KYLE
Dude, we're totally fucked now!
CARTMAN
Why the hell would we pay you to write your friends?!
LABORER 1
We thought it was kind of strange.
KYLE
This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail!
STAN
You guys, school starts in ten minutes!
KYLE
Son of a bitch! [the boys turn and head for school]
[South Park Elementary, Monday morning, Mrs. Garrison's class. The kids enter the classroom]
STAN
[sees Clyde] Clyde? Clyde! Heyhey Clyde! [Clyde turns around] You didn't finish your essay either, right?
CLYDE
No, I got it done. [turns and walks to his desk. Jimmy walks up beside the boys]
KYLE
Jimmy, did you finish your book report?
JIMMY
Yeah. I feel pretty good about it. I finished my whole book report and, I got a really nice letter from my ese who works down at the U-Haul. [walks off, leaving the boys dumbfounded]
CARTMAN
Crap! [the boys head for their seats]
KYLE
We're dead.
MRS. GARRISON
[dances into the room and sings] Hello, class. Here's my little desk [strokes it gently], my nice lil chalkboard. [hugs it. The boys are surprised at her behavior]
CARTMAN
Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports.
MRS. GARRISON
[acting bashful] Oho, that's okay Eric. If you need a little more time with your homework, just say so.
KYLE
[looks at Cartman, then at Stan. Stan looks back at both of them] Really?
MRS. GARRISON
Kids, I need to tell you something that you might find shocking. [sighs] I'm gay. [silence follows]
STAN
Again?
MRS. GARRISON
[sits on the edge of her desk, right leg over left] It was a shock to me too. I... met another woman and... we went to this fabulous bar called "Les Bos" where I finally felt at home. Allyson and I talked, and really opened up to each other and... then we... [demonstrates] scissored all night long.
BUTTERS
You have to be careful with scissors.
MRS. GARRISON
But listen, I am not going to just rush into a relationship with Allyson. I'm a late-in-life lesbian. So I need to play the field for a while, right? [closes her eyes] Oh I'm so happy.
CARTMAN
That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian!
CLASS
Yay!
MRS. GARRISON
[blushing and hides behind her hands] Teeheeheehee.
[Les Bos, night. Janet goes to the bar alone.]
JANET
[now confident] Hey Tracy, hey Kate.
TRACY
Hi Janet.
JANET
Lookin' hot, Linda. Wanna go somewhere and scissor later on? [moves away]
LINDA
[Woman 2] Huh?
JANET
Hey Patty.
PATTY
What's up, Janet.
JANET
[lights a cigarette] Ooo, stop giving me that look. Scissoring me with your eyes.
BIG WOMAN
Hey Janet, why don't you pick up on your own girl? [Janet flicks the cigarette away and leaves her seat, comes up behind the big woman and pulls her down on her stool to the ground and starts punching her.]
JANET
Oh yeah, dyke fight! [they roll around on the floor and the big woman gets away. The other women gather to watch. the big woman lands a kick to Janet's groin] You kicked me right in the pussy! [the fight resumes and they tumble into a booth, fighting all the way to the floor again. The big woman fights Janet off, but Janet gets turned on and starts having sex...] Uh? Oh! Oh, we're scissoring. Oh yeah, scissor! [the big woman, distracted for a moment, goes back to attacking Janet.]
LESBIAN 4
You guys. You guys, stop it. Listen to me, everybody. I got some bad news.
LESBIAN 5
What is it, Katie?
KATIE
They're closing down the bar. For good!
LINDA
Closing it down? They can't do that.
LESBIAN 6
[blonde] This is our home.
JANET
Yeah, this is our home.
KATIE
Well it's true, I just talked to the owners. They've sold the bar to Persians.
JANET
Persians?!
TRACY
So where are we supposed to go?
JANET
We aren't going anywhere! We have a history here! Persians are closing this bar over my dead lesbian body!
[City Hall, the Mayor's Office, day. Janet and the other lesbians are in the office.]
JANET
Mayor, this is an outrage! We are being discriminated against as lesbians!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
You're a lesbian now?
JANET
That's right. A proud lesbian! And our home is being taken away!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
The bar has been sold to Persian club owners. I don't know what you want me to do about it.
JANET
Forbid the transaction! This is happening all over the country, Mayor. Lesbian bars being bought out, shut down, it isn't right!
LESBIANS
Yeah, that's right!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
I'm sorry, but my hands are tied. The new owners plan to start redecorating the bar tomorrow. You have to be out by then.
JANET
[approaches the desk] Have you seen how Persians decorate? They will cover that bar in cheesy blue carpeting, white statues and gold curtain rods to the point that you will want to puke!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Mrs. Garrison, get out of here.
[Les Bos, later. The lesbians gather there for one last time.]
TRACY
Well, here's to some great times at this place.
LESBIAN 7
Yeah. Guess we'll just have to find somewhere else to hang out.
JANET
Now, come on gals! I can't believe what I'm hearing! We can't just give up!
ALLYSON
Well, what are we supposed to do, Janet?
JANET
We stand and fight! When the Persians come we tell them "We aren't leaving Les Bos."
KATIE
Actually, it's "Lebow".
JANET
[faces Katie with a ready fist to be pumped] No, it's Les Bos! [addressing all the lesbians] We... are Lesbos! And as Lesbos, we cannot just stand and watch as one girl bar after another gets shut dowwwwwn!
LINDA
[coming into view] The Persians have sent somebody to talk to us.
EMIR
Hello, my name is Emir Hadi. My boss sent me over here because he heard that you were upset about us trying to take over the bar.
LESBIAN 6
Yes, we are.
EMIR
Well, we want to assure you that when this place becomes another Club Persh, you will all still be 100% welcome. All they want is to make the place really nice. We're going to put down some lovely blue carpet, and gold curtain rods.
JANET
I knew it! I knew it!
EMIR
But you are still welcome to come. My boss wants you to know that you will not be discriminated against in any way.
JANET
Would you allow straight people in? Men?
EMIR
Well... we would allow whoev-
JANET
Choose your next words wisely, Persian! [jabs a finger into Emir's chest. Emir backs away]
EMIR
Look uhh, we don't have to offer you anything, so... I don't know why you're being so difficult. This is crazy.
JANET
No, this isn't crazy. This... is... Les Bos! [kicks him in the groin and walks away]
EMIR
Ohhhhh!
PERSIAN
How dare you! [Janet is shown in slow motion, her hips swaying back and forth]
NARRATOR
And so it had begun. By kicking the Persian messenger in the balls, the lesbos had sent a message. [Emir throws up on the floor]. All over the country lesbians heard of the brave standoff.
ANCHOR
As a group of lesbians in Colorado are refusing to allow the new owners of their bar in.
LESBIAN 8
Good for them!
LESBIAN 9
You go girls! [she takes a chip and bites into it. The bite is shown in slow motion.]
NARRATOR
The Persians returned to their office and told their coworkers how the thirty lesbos were refusing to let them in.
TUMON
Well fine. If they're going to block the entrance, we'll just bring like, sixty of us! I'll call more Persians for help. [turns left and picks up a phone in slow mo, then a fast-forward to dialing the numbers. The dialing is shown in slow motion. Next shot is Les Bos under a sepia sky]
NARRATOR
The hours pass quickly, and the lesbians boldly stood out in front of their bar to stop the Persians from entering.
LESBIAN 6
Here they come. [the Persians approach, but stop short]
BIG WOMAN
There's so many of them.
JANET
Lesbos! Positions! [they all take a battle stance]
TUMON
Lesbians! Stand aside. We're coming in to redecorate it!
JANET
The hell you are! You can take your blue carpet and gold curtain rods and shove them up your Persian buttholes!
TUMON
All right! Come on! They can't stop all of us! Huuu!
PERSIANS
[charging forward] Huuu! [slow motion feet are shown]
JANET
Lesbos! Remember this day! Remember this fight! [the battle begins with both sides pushing, the line going back and forth] Don't give them an inch! [she gets poked somewhere] Ow! Iranian faggot!
TUMON
Come on, seriously, let us in!
JANET
Never!
NARRATOR
For hours, the Lesbos kept the Persians back, holding them off, keeping them from decorating. [Janet and the second Persian are shown in intense shoving combat] Finally the Persians grew tired. and many of them wanted to go shopping for more designer sunglasses. They retreated. [and threw down their weapons] The Lesbos... had held.
JANET
Lesbohhhs!
LESBIANS
Huok! Huok!
NARRATOR
The Persians who did not go shopping now knew they must face their boss.
TUMON
[turns around] Here he comes. [the others turn to see. An opulent Hummer draws closer and closer]
NARRATOR
Rauf Xerxes. He sat atop a gold Hummer with customized Gucci accessories which only a Persian would think was cool. [four men pour out of the Hummer and arrange themselves into steps in front of the grille]
TUMON
Mr. Xerxes, the Lesbos wouldn't move. We could not get inside to redecorate.
XERXES
[deep voice] Tumon, how could you have failed me in this simple task? I am so seriously pissed off right now. I could bust a testicle.
NARRATOR
And with that the Persian club owner came to a realization.
XERXES
I shall have to deal with these lesbos myself.
[Les Bos, the aftermath of the Battle of South Park. The improvised weapons are strewn all over the street.]
JANET
Girls, I just want to say that I am very proud of you. The way we kept those Persians from takin' over our bar was Les-tastic.
ALLYSON
Well that's great, Janet, but what now? We can't just stay here pushing them away our whole lives.
JANET
We can't? I think it's pretty fun.
LINDA
We have to have a more solid plan. Something we can use against them permanently.
LESBIAN 10
[WNBA player] Maybe we can dig up some dirt on the club owner.
JANET
Hey, that's a great idea, Betsy. We need somebody working on the inside.
ALLYSON
Whattaya mean?
JANET
If we could get some Persians on our side, we could send them in to try to dig up some dirt on the owner!
ALLYSON
But who's gonna spy on them for us? We don't know any Persians.
JANET
It's okay. There's people you can hire for this kind of thing.
[Moovit Trucking, day. Janet shows up with Women 6 and 8 and whistles at the laborers.]
JANET
¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?
LABORER 1
Yeis.
LABORER 2
We looking work, sí.
JANET
All right. We need you to infiltrate some Persians who run Club Persh. And dig up some dirt on the owner.
LABORER 2
Okay.
LABORER 1
Sure.
LABORER 3
[wearing NY baseball cap] Okay.
LABORER 4
[wearing gray baseball cap] Yeah.
ALLYSON
Janet, how is this gonna work? They don't look Persian.
JANET
Sure they do. [walks over to one of the laborers, Laborer 1, and works on him] Just have to- gel the hair, put on a silk shirt, some gold chains, and tons of cologne. [shields her eyes from the cologne, then presents the new man] Persian.
LABORER 1
Sí. [the two women smile]
LESBIAN 6
Wow!
JANET
All right, Mexicans, take the rest of these outfits and see what you can find out. The address is in there too.
LABORER 1
Okay.
LABORER 5
No problem.
LABORER 2
Yes.
LABORER 4
Sí. [they turn around and walk away]
JANET
And Mexicans, please hurry. Our girl bar has very little time.
[Les Bos, stormy sky, day. The camera pans down from the sky.]
NARRATOR
A full day passed, and the Lesbos knew a second Persian attack was imminent. Outside, Lesbo lookouts kept watch, ready to alert the others. The Lesbo leader sat nervously inside. Her plan to dress Mexicans as Persians to act as spies - perhaps it had failed. She looked around at her fellow Lesbos. They were tired. In order to keep her Lesbos awake, she had no choice: she would have to make coffee. [Janet turns around (fast motion) and heads to the kitchen (slow motion). She enters the kitchen (fast motion) and grabs the glass kettle from the coffee maker (slow motion). She turns towards the sink (fast motion), and pours water into the kettle (slow motion). She turns back to the coffee maker (fast motion) and pour the water into it (slow motion). She closes the water cover, opens the coffee cover, gets some coffee, returns (all fast motion), and pours the coffee into the coffee filter (slow motion). She closes the coffee cover (fast motion) and presses the on button (slow motion).] With fresh coffee brewed, the Lesbos found new life, but would it be enough?
LESBIAN 6
[standing on a booth bench and looking out a window] The Persians are attacking again!
JANET
Take positions, Lesbos!
LESBIAN 11
Get outside! [the lesbians begin to move towards the door]
JANET
No wait, wait! That's not the Persians, it's the Mexicans.
LINDA
Really?
ALLYSON
How can you tell?
JANET
Let them through. It's okay.
LABORER 3
Hola, ¿como estas?
LABORER 4
Hola.
JANET
Did you uncover anything? Are the Persians doing anything illegal?
LABORER 4
Ahh, no. They're not doing anything illegal.
JANET
A-are you sure?
LABORER 1
No, but we did find out a kind of secret about the person in charge.
JANET
What secret?! [Laborer 4 hands him some photos] Oh my God, are, are you sure about this?
LABORERS
Sí.
ALLYSON
Janet! Janet, the Persian boss is here. He wants to talk to you and you alone.
JANET
It's okay. It's time I met this rich Persian asshole face to face.
[Les Bos, outside, moments later. Xerxes descends from his throne as Janet approaches]
XERXES
Why are you lesbians being so difficult?
JANET
Because we're protecting the only home we have.
XERXES
I don't know why you have to be all superlame about this.
JANET
You know, a long time ago when I first realized I was a lesbian, I felt isolated, confused. And finally I found a place that accepts me for who I am.
XERXES
Okay, how about this? [stands behind her and puts his hands on her shoulders] I will make you the manager of Club Persh. You'll make good money.
JANET
That's a generous offer, Xerxes, but you see, there's something I know about you. [takes Xerxes' left hand and sniffs it] I know you're actually a woman.
XERXES
[lets go and backs away quickly] How..? How did you find that out?
JANET
I hired Mexicans to spy on you! They saw you working out at Curves.
XERXES
You don't understand. Women can't be the boss in Persian culture. Nobody can know about this.
JANET
Yeah. And you know why? Because men are all assholes! They make you feel ashamed for being a little... big, or, manly looking. [Xerxes wasn't expecting this response] But not Lesbos. We accept other women for who they are inside!
XERXES
You do? Seriously?
JANET
Have you never... even thought, of being with another woman before?
XERXES
No. I don't even know how two women... can make love. Unless they just kind of [demonstrates with her fingers] scissor or something.
[Janet's bedroom, later. Janet and Xerxes are going at it in bed.]
JANET
Ohh yeah! Scissor me, Xerxes!
XERXES
Ohh, that feels so supercool!
JANET
Yeah, scissor!
XERXES
Ohh, I'm a new woman!
[Les Bos, next day. A bright blue sky and fluffy clouds grace it.]
NARRATOR
And so it was that Les Bos was saved. The Persians had agreed to keep it a lesbian bar, for no dyke should be without cocktails.
JANET
Thanks for everything, Xerxes.
XERXES
No. Thank you, friend.
ALLYSON
Hey, aren't you supposed to be teaching school right now?
JANET
The school hired a substitute to cover for me.
[South Park Elementary, morning, Mrs. Garrison's class. The kids are quietly paying attention]
LABORER 1
Hand so to find the sum of the two fractions, zhyou must always first check for the lowest common denominator. [the five laborers the boys first hired are there]
LABORER 2
Sí.
LABORERS
Sí. Sí. Yes. Yes. That's right.
LABORER 4
Sí.
STAN
These guys are pretty good.
KYLE
Yeah. I think I'm actually learning something. [both boys resume taking notes.]
End of D-Yikes!

synopsis:Ignoring the homeless in South Park becomes impossible when their numbers become overwhelming and their lust for spare change becomes insatiable.

script:Night of the Living Homeless

[The neighborhood, day. The boys head for the park.]
CARTMAN
All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes.
KYLE
Fine.
STAN
[stops] Oh, dude, what's with all the homeless people? [all around the basketball court homeless people loiter or sleep. There's one bum sleeping at center court. The boys walk up to him] Sir, could you move a little, please?
BUM
Spare some change?
CARTMAN
[pinches his nose shut] Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny's house. [releases the pinch] Get out of here!
KYLE
You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go. [a slow pan of the homeless around them] They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something.
STAN
Well dude, what are we supposed to do?
KENNY
(Yeah, what are we supposed to do?)
CARTMAN
No, Kyle's right, you guys. We should do something.
KYLE
Really?
CARTMAN
Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do.
[Moments later, kids from around the neighborhood gather in the basketball court.]
BUTTERS
[through a bullhorn] Gather 'round and witness the glory as Eric Cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless. [Stan and Kenny prepare the ramp at center court for Cartman]
CARTMAN
Thank you, thank you. [to Stan and Kenny] The ramp ready?
STAN
Yeah, it's all set.
CLYDE
He won't make it.
KYLE
Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!
CARTMAN
All right, here we go! Jimmy? [Jimmy starts the drum roll. Cartman takes off and picks up speed on his way to the ramp. Tweek and Bebe have their fists ready to pump for him. He leaves the ramp successfully, only to land on the bum and hit the ground without injury]
BUM
Oh! Aww.
CARTMAN
[jumps off his skateboard] Yes! I did it! [tosses his helmet away] I jumped over the homeless! [turns around] Yes!
KENNY
(Yehes!)
STAN
That was a sweet idea, Kyle. [smiles]
KYLE
God damn it, that wasn't my idea!
[South Park City Hall, day, the City Council. The Mayor is presiding and her two aides stand behind her]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
All right, people, we need to come up with answers. There are homeless sprouting up all over town. What are we supposed to do? [silence for a few seconds]
FIRE CHIEF
Well, I, I short of had an idea.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Please, Mr. Valmer.
MR. VALMER
[the fire chief] We could give the homeless all designer sleeping bags and makeovers. At least that way they'd be pleasant to look at.
OTHER MEMBERS
Oh, that's a good one. Good idea. I like it.
RANDY
Well I was thinking: We could turn the homeless into tires, so that we'd still have homeless, but we could use them, on our cars.
MR. VALMER
Ohh, that's a good one.
MR. MACKEY
Nice one, Randy.
GERALD
Like it.
AIDE
That's like recycling.
MRS. TESTABURGER
All right, enough! I find this whole conversation to be extremely offensive! The homeless aren't monsters, they are people, like you and me!
RANDY
You mean they've adapted, copied our DNA.
HOMELESS ADVISOR
Excuse me. I am the top researcher of homeless studies for Park County. I don't know why more homeless people are showing up in town, but I do know... that we must be extremely careful. If we give them anything, there could be more.
[Kyle's house, a rainy night. Kyle looks out from a window on the second floor and sees a homeless man on the sidewalk. The man carries a used tin can with his right hand and a small "SPARE CHANGE?" cardboard sign with his left hand. A car passes by and honks. Kyle takes pity on him and comes downstairs. He opens the front door, exits, and walks up to the man.]
KYLE
Hi. I've uh... [the man faces him] I've been saving up for a new Xbox game but... but I think you could use the money a lot more than I could. Listen I, I want you to take this. [hands him a bill] It's twenty dollars. [drops it into the tin can and backs up, smiling]
BUM
Got any more?
KYLE
[frowns] No, that... I thought that was a lot.
BUM
[turns around and walks off a bit, asking no one in particular] Spare any change?
KYLE
[sad at the lack of gratitude] You're welcome. [walks back into the house with his head down]
[South Park, morning. Kyle climbs onto his toy box and looks out the window again. More homeless people have arrived and are camped out in front of the house.]
KYLE
Oh crap. [the doorbell rings and Kyle comes down to answer it. Stan, Kenny, and Cartman enter]
STAN
Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house?
KYLE
I don't know.
CARTMAN
There's a bunch outside my house too.
BUM
[female] Spare any change, sir?
CARTMAN
No! Fuck off! [slams the door shut]
STAN
I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on.
KYLE
He did?
CARTMAN
Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!
KYLE
Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night.
CARTMAN
You what?!
KYLE
Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There has to be another reason.
STAN
Kyle, what were you thinking?
CARTMAN
[makes his way to Kyle] Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!
KYLE
I don't want you to jump them, retard!
[South Park, commercial district, day. Randy walks along Main Street, not really paying attention...]
BUM 1
Spare some change?
RANDY
No, sorry, I don't have any change.
BUM 2
[a few stores down] Got any change?
RANDY
No, sorry. [the bum follows him until he passes the third bum]
BUM 3
Can you spare some change? [Randy looks back and runs into the fourth bum]
BUM 4
[holds out his cup] Chaaange?
RANDY
Huh! I don't have any change. [more bums come out of the woodwork and crowd in on him]
BUM 5
[an elderly woman] Change?
RANDY
No!
BUM 6
Change? [Randy runs across the street, but...]
BUM 7
Spare some change?
RANDY
[shielding himself with his suitcase] Leave me alone I don't have any change!
BUM 7
All right, God bless you, sir.
RANDY
Oh, now I feel bad. [goes back to the bum] Here! [tosses some change into the cup] Ahh! [the other bums reach the other side of the street] Hahh! [begins to run, but other homeless people appear, asking for change. Randy moves past them] Nono, that was really all the change I had.
BUM 7
[jumps into view again] Spare some change?
RANDY
I just gave you change!
BUM 8
[another old woman] Change? [the homeless crowd Randy in and he can't escape. Their pleading takes on a chanting quality: "Change? Change? Change? Spare some change? God bless. ..."]
RANDY
Wahhh! I don't have any more change! [makes his way through the crown of bums] Noo! I don't have any change! I don't have any chaaange! [disappears under the sea of homeless people]
[The South Park Community Center, day. Gerald, Jimbo, and the Stotches are present.]
GERALD
Okay, that'll be great. Let's also make sure we have enough chairs in the community center for everyone to attend.
RANDY
[outside] Waaah! [bangs on the doors] Awwww! [enters, shuts the door behind him, and locks it] Stay away! [implores and pounds on the door] Stay awayhay!
JIMBO
Randy? Randy, what happened?
RANDY
Stay awa- ...I don't have any change! [collapses on the floor against the door] I don't have any chaaaahahange!
[A splash screen comes up for News 5.]
ANNOUNCER
This is a News 5 Special Bulletin, with Chris Swollenballs.
CHRIS SWOLLENBALLS
South Park has become overrun with the homeless. [a shot of the homeless crowd in front of South Park Elementary, then another shot of them in front of Tom's Rhinoplasty] Nearly every square inch of public property is now riddled with homeless, shutting down roadways and making getting around impossible. [a portrait of a homeless woman] Many people are trapped throughout the town. [an aerial shot of the community center. The center is surrounded by homeless people, with the five adults inside it now on the roof]
RANDY
Help! Help us!
[Kyle's house, living room. The boys watch the breaking news on TV]
STAN
Dude, it's our dads.
KYLE
Oh my God.
CHRIS SWOLLENBALLS
In the meantime, South Park citizens are being advised to stay indoors and protect their change.
BUM 9
[appears behind him in the newsroom] Spare some change?
CHRIS SWOLLENBALLS
What the? You can't be in here.
BUM 9
Ya got any change, sir?
CHRIS SWOLLENBALLS
No I don't have any change. How did he get in here?
BUM 10
Chaaaaange?
CHRIS SWOLLENBALLS
No, please. I don't have any change. Honest I don't. I don't have any- [a PLEASE STAND BY screen pops up and the station goes off the air]
CARTMAN
You see what you did, Kyle?!
STAN
Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents. [the boys turn off the TV and head outside]
[Kyle's house, outside.]
CARTMAN
They're everywhere!
AIDE
[pulls up in his car] What are you boys doing? Get in.
BUM 11
[knocks on his window] Spare any change, sir?
AIDE
[throws up his arms and shakes his head vigorously] Ahhhh! [settles down and starts driving] Come on, let's go! [some distance down the street] What the hell were you doing outside?!
STAN
Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town.
AIDE
You aren't getting into town! It's completely overrun with these... things. [a bum lands on the windshield]
THE BOYS
Ahh! [the bum begins to wash the windshield]
AIDE
No! I don't need my windshield cleaned! Stop it! Stop iiit! [peels off at the first opportunity] Look, our only hope is to talk to the homeless researcher out on Travis Street. He understands what's goin' on better than anybody. Just stick with me, kids. [enters an intersection, but doesn't notice the driver to his left, who's not paying attention to the road. They collide, with the aide dying on the spot]
THE BOYS
[exit the car uninjured] Aaahhh! [they move along the street, but notice the homeless everywhere. Another collision takes place a block away from them]
KYLE
Holy shit, dude! [behind him, the other three boys move a manhole cover off to one side, opening up a new means of escape]
STAN
Over here! [Kyle looks back. Cartman and Kenny drop down into the sewer and Kyle walks to the manhole.] Jump down! Go! [Kyle drops down, and finally, Stan]
CARTMAN
[pinching his nose shut with his left hand as he fans the smell away with his right] Aw man, it really smells like Kenny's house down here.
KENNY
[punches Cartman angrily] (Dude, shut the fuck up about my house!)
CARTMAN
Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together.
STAN
Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house. [they move forward.]
[South Park, street level, day. The homeless have paralyzed the town as crashed cars are shown everywhere. The community center roof is shown, with Randy looking out over the parking lot with binoculars. Gerald and Jimbo sit in chairs]
RANDY
[lowers his binoculars] No sign of anybody else.
GERALD
[rising from his chair] That's it. I'm gonna make a break for it.
RANDY
[turns around to face him] Don't be crazy, Gerald. You'll never get through all those homeless people.
STEPHEN
And even if you did, what then? You can't drive anywhere.
GERALD
If I can make it through them, maybe I can catch the bus to Fairplay. I have to try.
RANDY
You won't make it through, Gerald! [Gerald leaves quickly and heads downstairs. He leaves the community center, only to be hounded by bums begging for change]
GERALD
[making his way through] Ahh. Ahhhahhahahahh.
BUMS
Change? Change sir? You got some change?
GERALD
Don't have any change... Don't have any change... Damn it! All right, you want change? Here. [reaches into his left pocket and tosses some change off to his left] There! There's some change. All right, a little bit. [reaches into his right pocket and tosses some change off to his right] There you go. Take the change. [leaves, but stops himself] Oh wait. Wait, now I don't have any change left for the bus. Hold on. Can I just get back some of that change, please?
BUM 12
Change, sir?
GERALD
Can I have just a little change for the bus, please? I need a little... anybody have some change? Change? Got any change? [Randy follows Gerald through his binoculars] Change. Change? [Randy lowers his binoculars in horror]
STEPHEN
What happened?
RANDY
[closes his eyes] He's become one of them.
[South Park, night, under a full moon. All around town, the homeless ask for change. The boys are shown arriving at an office of some sort. They knock on the door and the homeless researcher answers it]
HOMELESS ADVISOR
Go away, I I don't have any change.
STAN
Are you the head of Homeless Studies?
HOMELESS ADVISOR
Yes. Who are you?
STAN
We think this may be our friend's fault. [shows Kyle] He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday-
HOMELESS ADVISOR
Oh my God. Get in here! Tell me what's going on? [the boys enter and he shuts the door]
STAN
There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.
CARTMAN
All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof.
HOMELESS ADVISOR
Jump them?
CARTMAN
I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people.
KYLE
Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy.
CARTMAN
I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.
KYLE
You barely made it over one, fatass!
STAN
Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now!
KYLE
God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a-
HOMELESS ADVISOR
Boys! Boys! I don't think you quite understand how the homeless function. Perhaps you should come downstairs. To my laboratory. [lightning and thunderclaps follow]
[South Park Community Center, night. The homeless now call up to the roof.]
RANDY
We don't have any change! Go away!
LINDA
Anything, Stephen?
STEPHEN
No. All the phone lines are completely down. [the stairwell door behind them rattles and they turn to face it in fear. Randy steps toward it with his shotgun and cocks it. More knocking on the door]
A MAN
[inside the stairwell] Hello? Ih-it's Steve Garrett from the library. Pu-please let us in.
RANDY
Find another place to hide, Steve!
STEVE
I I have others with me. We we have nowhere else to go. One woman here is pregnant.
STEPHEN
We can't just leave them out there.
STEVE
Let us in! For God's sake, they're coming! No! No, I'm sorry, we don't have any change.
LINDA
You have to let them in, Randy.
RANDY
There isn't enough food for more people up here!
STEVE
Oh God. One of them is a war veteran. [more knocking] We're gonna have to give him some change.
STEPHEN
This isn't happening!
RANDY
All right all right, fine! [approaches slowly and opens the door. The refugees stream forth]
BUM 13
Could you spare some change, sir?
RANDY
[shuts the door quickly] Harrrh!
[The Homeless Advisor's lab, later. He's dissected the body of a dead homeless person.]
HOMELESS ADVISOR
I've dissected several homeless to see what make them tick. Their anatomy is shockingly similar to ours. See? Everything is there: heart, lungs, kidneys, they're almost identical to us in every way. Except for one. [a homeless man is chained to a wall by a chain around his neck. The advisor approaches him] The homeless... can survive solely... on change. [pulls out some change]
BUM 14
[sticks out his cup and strains to get the money] Change?
HOMELESS ADVISOR
They feed on our change. They need it in order to keep them moving
BUM 14
Is that... is that some spare change?
HOMELESS ADVISOR
Somehow they're able to take... our change... and turn it into nourishment, sustenance.
BUM 14
Spare some of that change, sir?
HOMELESS ADVISOR
But now watch. [drops some coins into the bum's cup and walks back to the boys. The bum rattles his cup a bit]
BUM 14
Spare some change?
HOMELESS ADVISOR
It has already completely forgotten that I've given it change. It just wants... more, change. Look over here. [heads to his left and the boys follow] This one I've kept deprived of change for over three days.
BUM 15
Chaaaaange?
KYLE
What's it doing?
HOMELESS ADVISOR
It's dying.
CARTMAN
Cool.
HOMELESS ADVISOR
I've learned that the nearby city of Evergreen had a homeless problem just before we did. And they were able to stop it.
GERALD
[finds the advisor's office and enters] Excuse me, the front door was open. Can I borrow some change? [other homeless men follow him in]
HOMELESS ADVISOR
Oh my God, they're coming in! [leads the boys to an escape hatch above some crates] Quick kids, get out of here! You can fit!
KYLE
[helps Cartman up] What about you?
HOMELESS ADVISOR
Get to Evergreen and find out how they got rid of the homeless! I'll be all right!
CARTMAN
Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny.
GERALD
Hello? [comes down a spiral staircase] I I'm sorry, I just really need some change for the bus?
BUM 16
Change?
BUM 17
Spare some change?
BUM 18
Change?
GERALD
Stop it! I really do need change!
BUM 16
Me too. Change?
GERALD
[outside the lab] Change? [knocks on the lab door] Hello? Do you have any change?
BUM
[outside the lab] Chaaange?
HOMELESS ADVISOR
Sorry to take the easy way out. [takes a gun to his right temple and cocks it. An exterior view of his office is shown and a gunshot heard. Back inside, he's still standing, in pain. The bullet went out the left temple, but didn't kill him.] OW! OH, FUCK! OWW! [next he tries shooting through his jaw, and the bullet comes out through his right cheek.] OHHH! AH! GOD! [shoots through his jaw again, and the bullet goes out his right cheek again. This time he gargles and drops on all fours. He shoots through his right shoulder three times, but still lives. This time he takes the gun to his forehead and cocks the gun. The exterior view of his office is shown again and a gunshot is heard. Back inside, he's still alive. The bullet to the brain didn't kill him. This time he shoots at his heart twice, and that finally kills him. He writhes around for a few seconds and dies.]
[The South Park Community Center. There are so many homeless people now that it looks like a page out of "Where's Waldo?" There are now thirteen people on the roof, all asking for change.]
RANDY
[rifling through a box] No. No, damn it! [faces the small group on the roof with him] That's it. That's it, everyone. We're out of Pop-Tarts.
JIMBO
No. We can't be.
RANDY
Face it, we're gonna starve!
LINDA
No, no wait, there's still a box over here.
RANDY
Those are cherry! Ich!
HEAD OF PUBLIC SAFETY
[his cell phone rings and he rises] Wait, I got a signal! I got a signal. [dials a number]
GERALD
What? You do?
RANDY
How? Call the fire department.
HEAD OF PUBLIC SAFETY
I'm calling my wife! [waits for her to pick up] Mary. Mary baby, are you all right?
LINDA
Oh, maybe we're gonna be okay.
STEPHEN
Ask her what's happening.
HEAD OF PUBLIC SAFETY
Mary, what's goin' on out there? Nobody's coming for us. They what? No! That's impossible. But how can that be? We didn't even- [the phone cuts out] Hello? Mary. [tries to reconnect] Mary!
JIMBO
What happened, Glen?
GLEN
[Head of Public Safety] There's no help coming! She said... because of all the homeless... because of all the homeless in South Park property values have plummeted. I had two liens against my house and so the bank is foreclosing! I don't have a home anymore. [Randy and the others are quiet for a moment, but Randy knows what he must do. He pumps his shotgun and aims at Glen.]
LINDA
Randy, what are you doing?
RANDY
He's homeless now. We aren't safe.
GLEN
I'm not like them.
RANDY
Not yet. It's only a matter of time.
LINDA
[tries dissuading Randy] And what are you gonna do, huh? Just blow his head off?
RANDY
If we have to! Siddown Glen!
GLEN
Randy, you can't just-
RANDY
SIT... doowwwnnnn!
[Another shot of the homeless on the street.]
[Back to a shot of the roof. Glen is sitting under a blanket again.]
GLEN
This is crazy. How can they just take away my house? Where am I supposed to put all my things? I don't have a place for all my stuff; where am I supposed to put all my stuff? I'll need to pay for storage. Can I borrow some- money to put my stuff in storage? Come on guys. If you all just help me out a little bit. Each one of you just put in a little... change? Change? [That's it. Randy fires at him and blows the upper half of his head off. Randy sighs heavily]
[A brilliant sunrise in the Rockies. Another shot reveals a ruined town - Evergreen. The four boys arrive and look at the destruction]
STAN
What the hell happened here? [three men in camouflage appear and aim their shotguns at them]
MAN 1
[wearing a white and blue bandana around his neck] That's far enough! Just march your butts right back out of our town!
STAN
We, just came to ask a question.
MAN 2
You homeless or homeowners?
KYLE
We're nine.
MAN 1
Yeah? Well that makes you homeless, so get out of here before you die!
STAN
Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem.
CARTMAN
Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.
KYLE
Shut up, Cartman!
MAN 1
Cartman? Eric Cartman? The kid who jumped thirty homeless people on a skateboard?
CARTMAN
Youu heard about that?
MAN 2
Heard about it? They said you could have easily cleared fifty homeless with that jump.
CARTMAN
Thirty was hard enough.
KYLE
Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy!
STAN
Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!
CARTMAN
Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town.
MAN 2
Well, that was easy. [the group moves to a clearing where the boys sit on a bench while the first man serves himself some coffee and begins explaining]
MAN 1
The homeless first started arriving in Evergreen about three months ago. At first there were only a few of them, askin' for change, sleeping in the parks. But then more showed up, and we realized there was somethin' different about them. They fed off of our change to the point that they could actually start renting apartments. We knew it wouldn't be long before the homeless actually started buying homes. And then we'd have no idea who was homeless and who wasn't! The people living in the house right next door to you could be homeless and you wouldn't even know! [sips] Nobody could trust anybody! Fights broke out. War! [Kyle notices something on the ground] That's when I started suspecting that [the something is a pamphlet that says "HAVEN FOR THE HOMELESS" on the front cover. He picks it up] my own wife, who I'd been living with for twenty years, was actually homeless. So I had to burn her. In her bed while she slept. [Kyle reads the pamphlet] After she died I vowed I wouldn't let the homeless destroy our town! So we came up with a plan to get rid of them once and for all. [Kyle opens the pamphlet and is met with these words: "HAVEN FOR THE HOMELESS. TRY SOUTH PARK."]
KYLE
You son of a bitch. [gets off the bench and approaches the first man with the pamphlet] You didn't solve your homeless problem, you just sent all your homeless to South Park! [opens the pamphlet to show him]
MAN 1
That's right, yes.
STAN
What?
KYLE
I knew it! It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!
MAN 1
And it was Texas who sent them to us! People in San Antonio got rid of their homeless by tellin' them what a great place Evergreen was!
STAN
[getting off the bench] But then you didn't solve the problem, you just moved it!
MAN 1
Right. But we survived.
WOMAN
[pops up out of nowhere, almost a skeleton] Dehhhnyihhhs! [she's armed with a rifle and ready to shoot]
DENNIS
[Man 1, turns around. The other two men look as well] Christine!
CHRISTINE
You sonothatitch! You tried to kinn me!
DENNIS
I had to, Christine, you were homeless.
CHRISTINE
No, I wasn't honeless yeh stukid asshole!
DENNIS
Christine, I can't understand you.
CHRISTINE
Yeah! Gecause you durned my yits oth!
DENNIS
I nurned your rip sauce?
CHRISTINE
No! You durned my yits oth!
DENNIS
I have no idea what you're saying! [Christine shoots him] Ow! [Dennis is dead. The third man kills Christine, who fires one final shot and hits the second man. The second man kills the third and dies moments later]
STAN
Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this!
KYLE
[turns around] No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea.
STAN
No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle!
KYLE
That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it!
KENNY
(What are you gonna do?)
KYLE
We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!
[Montage: the boys modify a bus. Stan works on the front fenders. Cartman works on brakes and accelerator. Kenny works on tightening the barbed wire running along the roof's edge. Kyle works on putting up a shield in front of the bus with a screw gun. Stan moves to the transmission. Cartman and Kenny reinforce the sides of the bus. Kyle works on the PA system.]
[The community center roof. The refugees sit around. A bus horn is heard and the refugees rouse themselves. Randy looks out over the parking lot and sees the bus. The homeless clear a path for the bus]
RANDY
A bus! A bus is coming!
JIMBO
[seeing who's inside] It's the boys! They've modified a bus to get us out of here!
STEPHEN
I knew they'd come back for us!
LINDA
All right!
A WOMAN
Yeah.
RANDY
[props up Glen's corpse so it faces the bus] Look, Glen. We're saved. [the bus stops]
STAN
All right, I'm turning around
STEPHEN
Why are they turning?
RANDY
[drops the corpse] What are they doing? [the bus turns so the front end now faces away from the community center. Randy calls out] Don't leave us!
KYLE
All right, hit it.
CARTMAN
Let's hope to Christ this works. [prepares to press the red button. Music begins to play]

BUM

CARTMAN
[jumps off his skateboard, throws down his helmet and exults] Yes! That's three homeless! Suck on that! Fuck yeah! [faces his friends and the bums]
STAN
Honestly, I don't know what you see in this, Kyle.
End of Night of the Living Homeless

[Toy Safari, day. Shoppers walk by, enter, leave, browse, etc. Inside, in Aisle 3: Action Figures. Cartman browses one set of shelves. Another boy is shown behind him, browsing the facing shelves.]
CARTMAN
[picks out a figure] Big Ring Slammer. Comes with posable neck-smash grip. [moves the package around with his left hand and strokes his chin with his right] That's pretty kewl. Let's see...
BOY
Cock! [Cartman is startled.]
CARTMAN
[puts the Slammer back on the rack and selects another figure.] The Black Jackal. Karate Kick Panel Force and bendable neck-
BOY
Asshole! Cock! Asshole, shit, shit cock! [his neck and face get taut as he blurts this out]
CLERK
[nearby] Ma'am, is that your son over there?
MOM
Yes, I'm sorry. My son has Tourette's Syndrome.
CLERK
Tourette's Syndrome?
MOM
It's a neurological disorder. He-he can't control what he says.
CLERK
Oh...
BOY
[turns his head hard to the left, his eyes shut] Shiit! [turns his head back to face forward] Dumb shiiit!
MOM
[goes to take her son home] A-alright Thomas, maybe we should go?
THOMAS
All right Mom- Bitch! Ass bitch!
MOM
Here, let's buy you a nice toy to take home. [selects a figure and hands it to Thomas, who walks away with her, smiling. Cartman watches as they leave]
CARTMAN
[turns around and walks off, saying softly] Dude, that mom is kewl. [he arrives at the checkout line with his action figure]
THOMAS
[stands in line behind Cartman] Cocknut! Augh... Stupid shit!
CARTMAN
[turns around and glares at Thomas] Are you talkin' to me?!
THOMAS
No. Cocknose!
CARTMAN
What's your problem, kid?!
MOM
Oh, a-I'm sorry. [Thomas backs away a bit] My... son Thomas has Tourette's Syndrome. [a crowd begins to gather around them]
CARTMAN
What?
THOMAS
Mom, let's just go. Shhhit!
MOM
People with Tourette's can't control certain tics. It's it's like a sneeze.
THOMAS
Asshole ASSHOLE.
CARTMAN
[waves his arms around] Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa. You're telling me there's an illness that makes you blurt out obscenities?
THOMAS
Mom, can we just go home, please?
MOM
It's okay, Thomas. They understand.
THOMAS
I want tuh go! [throws down his action figure and walks off, his hands over his mouth] Shitfag!
MAN 1
Poor kid.
CLERK
Yeah.
CARTMAN
[turns around and faces the crowd] All right, hold on just a second here: Are you telling me that if you have this Tourette's Syndrome you can say whatever you want, all the time, and never get in trouble?
CLERK
It's a neurological disorder; he can't help it.
MAN 1
Yeah! [Cartman blinks - CHING! He begins to think: "I've got a golden ticket... I've got a golden"]
CARTMAN
Twinkle in my eye. [turns and heads for the entrance] haha. HahaHAAhahahaha. [throws his action figure into the air and runs out the door]
CLERK
Hey don't you wanna buy that toy?
CARTMAN
I don't need the toy! I've found something better! [dances away] 'Cause I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden chance to make my way!
[Colorado Neurology Center, some days later. A doctor checks Cartman out as Liane watches]
LIANE
It started about four days ago, Doctor, and every day he seems to get worse.
CARTMAN
Puh- pussy!
LIANE
Oh...
CARTMAN
Pussy! Cock! Shit! [covers his mouth in faking embarrassment]
LIANE
Oh dear... I was checking out the Internet and ih, it almost seems like his symptoms are like those in something called "Tour, Tourette's Syndrome"?
CARTMAN
Tourette's Syndrome? What is that, Mommy. Butthole! Titties! Balls! [covers his mouth immediately]
DOCTOR
That doesn't seem likely. Tourette's is a hereditary disease; it doesn't just suddenly start.
CARTMAN
...Cocksucker!
DOCTOR
[begins to think and walks off a bit] ...On the other hand, Tourette's does often develop later in a child's life, getting progressively worse.
CARTMAN
Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls!
LIANE
Oh Doctor, can you help him?
DOCTOR
[turns around and walks back to them] We don't know very much about Tourette's I'm afraid. But we will give your son all the help we can.
CARTMAN
But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they won't understand that I can't control what I say.
DOCTOR
Don't worry, young man. We'll make sure everyone understands your disease and gives you the compassion you deserve.
CARTMAN
Ohohh, that's awesome. Thank you. Faggot! [gives him a mischievous look]
[South Park Elementary, day. Cartman walks into view as the kids are at their lockers]
CARTMAN
Shit! Butthole! [walks up to Wendy] Hey Wendy. DUMB BITCH! Uh, sorry. [smiles and moves on] Titties! Cock! [he's relishing this. He points to a redhead] Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface!
KYLE
Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there. [she walks up to them]
CARTMAN
Uh, Good morning, Principal Victoria. Shitballs!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Good morning, Eric. [turns right and walks away. Cartman walks off in the opposite direction]
KYLE
Did Cartman just say "shitballs" to the principal?
BUTTERS
Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'.
KYLE
What?
CRAIG
[in admiration] He's the luckiest kid in the world. If I could say "shitballs" to the principal I'd be sooo happy.
CARTMAN
[deciding to explain things. Mr. Mackey is in the background] Uh excuse me, excuse me everyone I, I guess you might have noticed my awkward tics. Asshole! Pussy asshole! [the other kids lean away] Ach, augh, I just want you to know that I can't control it.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
It's okay, Eric. We all understand and we think you're very brave.
KYLE
[after some thought, points and says] He's faking.
CARTMAN
[his thunder is stolen and he covers for it] Ahahahaha, ayah- Excuse me everyone, I need to have a moment alone with my good friend Kyle? [walks to Kyle] Asscheeks! [hauls Kyle off to a clearing] Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition.
KYLE
You do not have Tourette's Syndrome, fatass!
CARTMAN
...Oh, okay, you figured me out. [claps] Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble.
KYLE
Who cares about saying whatever you-?
CARTMAN
Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle.
KYLE
Grrhh, whatever. [walks off in a huff. Mr. Mackey walks by]
CARTMAN
Good morning, Mr. Mackey. Asspussy! [Mr. Mackey does nothing but walk away]
CRAIG
If I could say "asspussy" to the counselor I would be sooo happy.
[Mrs. Garrison's class, later. Mrs. Garrison writes a math problem on the board: (-7)X(-2)]
MRS. GARRISON
Okay, so what do we get when we multiply a negative number-?
CARTMAN
Dicktits!
MRS. GARRISON
[glances back at Cartman, then finishes writing] -when we multiply a negative number by another negative-?
CARTMAN
Shit! Asshole! [Mrs. Garrison looks at Cartman with a bit of shock, then turns to the board.] 'Scuse me. [Cartman smiles]
MRS. GARRISON
Ih if we apply what we've just learned, we see that all negatives can-
CARTMAN
Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch! [the class laughs. Cartman pretends to be hurt] You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness.
MRS. GARRISON
[facing the class] All right kids, let's just try to focus on learning, okay? [turns to the board] Now all you need to remember here is that negative numbers
CARTMAN
Tampon! Tampon DICKshit!
KYLE
[Loses his temper via short temper and yells] Will you knock it off already?!
CARTMAN
Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE.
KYLE
Don't push me, asshole!
MRS. GARRISON
Kyle, watch your language! [Cartman lets out a hearty laugh]
CRAIG
[getting miserable] If I could yell "tampon dickshit" in the classroom I'd be sooo happy.
[The principal's office, later. Mrs. Garrison is inside talking with her.]
MRS. GARRISON
Principal Victoria, it's just that Eric has become such a distraction I, I don't think I can teach my class anymore.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I understand it's been difficult, Mrs. Garrison, and so, Mr. Donaldson has come from the Tourette's Tolerance and Understanding Foundation. [Mr. Donaldson walks into view]
MR. DONALDSON
Hello Mrs. Garrison- [turns his head to the left] Ass. ASS. [recovers] I want to help your class better understand this illness. [turns his head to the left] Piss!
KYLE
[walks into the office, with Cartman following] No! Up yours, fatboy!
CARTMAN
Kyle please! I'm sorry!
KYLE
Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!
MR. DONALDSON
Faking? [Kyle is sure he's got Cartman on the hook] You think people with Tourette's are faking?!
KYLE
[his certainty gone] N-no, I'm just saying that I think-
MR. DONALDSON
Do you have any idea how horrible that is to say? [turns his head to the left] Ass! ASS! [recovers] We aren't "faking", young man. Trust me, nobody wants this illness, ass. [turns his head to the left] PISS! PIIISS!
CARTMAN
That's right, Kyle. [turns his head to the left, where Kyle happens to be] Crap-filled vagina!
MR. DONALDSON
This is the kind of intolerance you teach at this school, Principal Victoria?!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
No.
MR. DONALDSON
This if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to take this "bully" to see that Tourette's is very real. [turns his head to the left] Piiiss.
[The Children's Therapy Center, day. Mr. Donaldson is seated with seven kids on chairs in a circle in the middle of the room. Two of them are Thomas and Kyle.]
MR. DONALDSON
Kids, today during therapy class we have a special visitor. [turns his head to the right, where Kyle happens to be. Kyle jumps in his chair] ASS! [recovers and clears his throat] I, I wanted him to meet all of you so he could try to understand Tourette's
TEEN BOY
Tourette's is like a cough or a sneeze. [shakes his head quickly] Brrrrr! [recovers] It isn't contagious like some people think. [shakes his head quickly] Brrrrrrrrr!
BLONDE GIRL
A lot of people with Tourette's have different tics. My tic [leans her head to the left, straightens it out, and snaps her fingers] is that I have to bend my neck and snap my fingers. But a lot of people don't even notice it. [leans her head to the left, straightens it out, and snaps her fingers]
THOMAS
[turns his head to the right] Aw shit! COCK!
BRUNETTE
Sometimes it can be embarrassing to have Tourette's, but I- [blinks and bobs her head] Boop. I've learned I shouldn't be mad at myself.
MR. DONALDSON
You see? These kids can't control their actions. Ass! Piss in the ass!
KYLE
L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun.
TEEN BOY
Fun? [shakes his head quickly] Brrrrr! [recovers] This really isn't all that fun. [shakes his head quickly] Brrr, brrrrrr!
THOMAS
Aw shit!
BRUNETTE
[blinks and bobs her head] Boop. [The blonde girl leans her head to the left, straightens it out, and snaps her fingers]
MR. DONALDSON
[turns his head to the left] Piiiss, coming from my aaass!
THOMAS
Yee-you wanna know about fun? Going to public places knowing you're going to make a fool of yourself. Embarrass your parents [turns his head to the right] Aw shit! [recovers] My dad... finally couldn't take it anymore. He... divorced my mom, s-said he'd still be around, but I only see him at Christmastime now. S-sh-shit! S-sh-shit! The worst part is I know how lonely my mom is. A lot of times I know she'd be better off if I was dead.
KYLE
Dude...
MR. DONALDSON
Your mom would not be better off if you were dead, Thomas. Even if people like Kyle here think so.
KYLE
Aw, come on!
MR. DONALDSON
So then you apologize for what you said before?
KYLE
Ah, I was just trying to... just, just in one instance... [the others stare at him] No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [The blonde girl leans her head to the left, straightens it out, and snaps her fingers]
[The Children's Therapy Center, outside. Mr. Donaldson takes Kyle to his waiting parents as the other kids look on.]
MR. DONALDSON
Well, Mr. and Ms. Broflovski, I think your son has learned a lot, and he appears to be honestly remorseful for making fun of people with disabilities. [turns his head to the left] Piss! PISS!
SHEILA
Our son is a good kid. He just didn't understand Tourette's was a real disease.
MR. DONALDSON
Well, I think the only thing left now is for your son to apologize to his little classmate. [Cartman walks into view and bats his eyes at Kyle sweetly. Kyle does not appreciate this]
GERALD
Well Kyle?
KYLE
[grudgingly] I'm sorry.
CARTMAN
Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle.
KYLE
[grudgingly, louder] I'm sorry.
CARTMAN
You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it?
KYLE
I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh- [stops himself]
CARTMAN
Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother. [looks at Gerald and Sheila] Fag Jew! Jew bitch!
SHEILA
Oh, thank you Eric.
CARTMAN
Thank you. Big-nosed kike! [Sheila laughs nervously]
MR. DONALDSON
Well I think we can all put this behind us now. [turns his head to the left] Piiiss out my aaass!
CARTMAN
Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face! [thumps his chest and clears his throat] Oh goodness, 'scuse me. Jeez, that was a bad one. [starts to walk away] Well, gotta run, everybody. Got some big things in the works. [stops to whisper to Thomas] Isn't having Tourette's awesome? [leaves]
[A Dateline commercial. Dateline graphics come up]
ANNOUNCER
Next week on Dateline NBC: it's a Dateline special report.
HANSEN
I'm Chris Hansen. You probably know me from To Catch A Predator, where we bust men looking for sex with children.
[a clip from that show]
HANSEN
Go ahead and take a seat. Take a seat right over there.
PREDATOR
Oh God, whoa, no.
HANSEN
What are you doin' here?
PREDATOR
I'm just bein' stupid, I guess.
[return to the current show, with graphics indicating the change of focus from pedophiles to Tourette's]
HANSEN
But now we're switching our focus from pedophiles to Tourette's Syndrome. It all started when I received this touching letter from a brave little boy in Colorado.
CARTMAN
[doing a voice-over]
Dear Mr. Hansen,
I have Tourettes and I want the world to understand what it's like. Won't you do a special report on me so that the world can learn to ACCEPT us instead of just laugh? Donkey Boner!!!
Eric Cartman
[he doesn't say his name]
HANSEN
This Saturday on Dateline I'll be bringing you Eric's story, live and uncensored, from his home in Colorado.
ANNOUNCER
Living with Tourette's: The Eric Cartman Story. This Saturday on Dateline NBC.
CARTMAN
[adding to the commercial] Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true. [jumps at the camera] Goddamn Jews! Suck my ass barf! [jumps back in shock, covers his mouth, then smiles at the camera sweetly, bending his head to the right]
[A sleepy night, Cartman's house.]
[Cartman's room. Cartman makes himself a drink, adult-style: He has two liquor bottles, a bucket of ice, and two wine glasses. Why two? Hm... He serves himself some ice. A few seconds later, Kyle enters his room and slams the door shut]
CARTMAN
Hello, Kyle. Dickhead!
KYLE
What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?!
CARTMAN
[serves himself some liquid] Yes. It's all finally come to fruition. [gently swirls the ice around] The final cog in my... master plan. [turns around to face Kyle] This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air. [turns back and prepares a drink for Kyle] Despicable things. And people will call me brave.
KYLE
Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny!
CARTMAN
[takes the drink to Kyle] Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?
KYLE
...Scotch?
CARTMAN
[quickly gives him the drink in triumph] Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy.
KYLE
You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Then the game is on, Kyle.
KYLE
It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice! [Cartman looks at his drink]
CARTMAN
[walks back to make another "Scotch"] Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? "Big titties! Buttmunch!" There's no walls anymore! "Shit!" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. "I wet my bed last night." [realizes what just happened]
KYLE
What did you say?
CARTMAN
Uhh nuh-nothing...
KYLE
You aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole! [runs out of the room and slams the door]
CARTMAN
Hm. That was... weird.
[Whistlin' Willy's Pizza Gultch, day. Inside, a crowd has gathered to watch this Dateline special. A banner hanging from the ceiling says "WE'RE PROUD OF YOU ERIC!" On a low stage are Mr. Mackey, Liane Cartman and Eric, Mr. Donaldson, and Principal Victoria]
MR. DONALDSON
We are here today to congratulate a brave little boy. Tonight, Eric Cartman will go on television and become the spokesman for Tourette's Syndrome. [turns his head to the left] Piiiss out my aaass! [applause rises from the crowd]
THOMAS
The spokesman for Tourette's? Oh no... [turns his head to the right] Cock!
CARTMAN
[Mr. Donaldson adjusts the mic to his height] Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls! [applause rises from the crowd] You've all been so understanding and supportive of my illness. Jizz farmer dick sneeze. And it is because of you... that I have the courage to go on national television tonight. Titty sprinkles. [applause rises from the crowd]
CRAIG
If I could say "titty sprinkles" on national television I would be sooo happy.
CARTMAN
And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up! [startled by his own words, then covers his mouth as the crowd falls silent.] Uh, I... I...'m making this all up to you, for putting up with my mental disorder. I cry at night because I don't have a dad. [turns away from the mic and mumbles] What the hell is going on?
MR. MACKEY
Uhit's okay, Eric. We understand your illness, m'kay?
CARTMAN
No hey ut what, what I meant to say was "asslicker cumballs." And uhh, [helplessly] I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson! [covers his mouth]
PATTY
Eewwww!
CARTMAN
[clambors offstage] Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom! [runs through the crowd]
[The mens room. Cartman runs in and heads for the sink. Butters is pissing at the urinal and his pants are at his ankles. Cartman washes his face.]
BUTTERS
[does a double take and smiles] Uh hey Eric!
CARTMAN
[finishes up and looks at Butters] Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?
BUTTERS
Wuh who are you talking about?
CARTMAN
Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners. [he covers his mouth in horror as Butters is stunned] Wah! [faces Butters]
BUTTERS
You... you and your cousin touched wieners?
CARTMAN
I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it! [runs out of the restroom]
[The dining area. Cartman runs through the crowd]
CARTMAN
Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run!
LIANE
Is there a problem, sweetie?
CARTMAN
[turns around and faces her] No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's [struggles to keep control] AAAA no, NAAAA! [he's got the crowd's attention] I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year. [now composed] Ah, I need to be going now.
MR. MACKEY
Well all right Eric. Well good luck on Dateline tonight.
CARTMAN
[apprehensive] Dateline. Right. [backs away but can't control his statements] I wet my b-AAA! I touched my cousin's WEE-NUH! This sure has been fun! G'bye! [runs out the door screaming with his hands firmly over his mouth]
[KSPC Channel 4, an HBC affiliate, day. In his own office, Hansen rehearses his lines as the staff listens. A cameraman preps his camera]
HANSEN
Tonight, an inside look at Tourette's Syndrooome. I'm Chris Hansen. Mmh. I'm Chris Hansen.
CARTMAN
[rushes onto the set] Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show.
HANSEN
Why not?
CARTMAN
My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine.
HANSEN
[rolls up his notes and motions Cartman to a stool] Why don't you have a seat?
CARTMAN
No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show.
HANSEN
Go ahead and take a seat.
CARTMAN
[heads for the door] But I'm not gonna do the-
HANSEN
Take a seat, right over there. [Cartman backs up and sits on the stool, then puts his cap on the bar] What are you doing here?
CARTMAN
I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show?
HANSEN
But you are doing the show.
CARTMAN
You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say.
HANSEN
Well of course you can't control what you say. You have Tourehhtte's.
CARTMAN
No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad. [gets his cap and puts it on] So ah I'm sorry, but I'm not doin' the show, that's it. Goodbye. [hops off the stool and walks away]
HANSEN
Why don't you take a seat?
CARTMAN
Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!
HANSEN
Have a seat.
CARTMAN
[begins backing up] No, I'm just gonna go- [wonders how this is happening]
HANSEN
Take a seat, right over there.
CARTMAN
[gets back on the stool and whispers to himself] How does he do that?
HANSEN
You know, one tiiime, I was doin' a show called "To Catch A Predator". We almost caught this pedophile, but then he raaan from us 'cause he didn't wanna be on Dateline. Se we tracked him down to his hoouuse. And you know what he did? He shot himself. [Cartman is scared] It'd be a shame if... you didn't wanna go on Dateline. Be a shame if we had to track you down and you "shot yourself". [Cartman is more scared, and a series of expressions cross his face]
[The program begins: "Dateline \living with tourette's syndrome."]
ANNOUNCER
Live, from our satellite studio in Colorado. This! ...is Dateline.
HANSEN
Tonight, an inside look at Tourette's Syndrome. I'm [stretches his name out so it sounds like nails on a chalkboard] Chris Hansen. In a few minutes, you will meet little Eric Cartman, who wants the world to understand his affliction.
[The green room. Cartman paces back and forth. Someone knocks on the door]
A PAGE
Five minutes, kid.
CARTMAN
Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this? [walks to a nearby table and begins to pray] God? Please uh, I know I screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like "I touched penises with my cousin!" [covers his mouth quickly] Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle.
[KSPC Channel 4, outside, night, moments after the program began. Kyle jumps into view wearing dark camouflage and a headset at the parking lot entrance]
KYLE
Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position?
THOMAS
[using a walkie talkie] Copy Foxtrot. Tango in position. Awww shit!
KYLE
You sure you don't wanna back out?
THOMAS
Nono, you were right. The fat kid is faking it! If he goes on TV, more people will think that having Tourette's is fun. Asshole shit!
KYLE
All right, then we go with the plan. Just like "To Catch A Predator". [a light brown car pulls in] The first guy is here. This is probably HotForBoys219. [the car stops and Thomas looks around]
HOTFORBOYS219
[walks up to Thomas] Hi, are you CuteBilly182?
THOMAS
Yeah. I was chatting with you online. SHIT!
HOTFORBOYS219
[shaking with excitement] Oh God, I'm so turned on right now. This is your house? Your, your parents aren't home, are they?
THOMAS
N-no, it's cool. Go on inside. I made brownies. SHIT! I'm just gonna slip into something more comf'table. COCK!
HOTFORBOYS219
[dances by] Okay. Cock! Don't take too long. [laughs and prances into the studio]
[The studio set. The opening segment is finished.]
HANSEN
So now let's meet a child who haaas Tourette's Syndrooome, and who must fi- [the audience doors open and HotForBoys219 prances down the aisle laughing]
HOTFORBOYS219
Ho, whoa, wait a minute. This ain't no house.
HANSEN
[stands up angrily] What are you doing?!
HOTFORBOYS219
[gasps and hides his face] Chris Hansen?! Oh no, it's a setup! I knew it!
HANSEN
Sir, why don't you take a seat, right over there.
HOTFORBOYS219
Now everyone's gonna know I'm a perv! Whoa! [takes out a gun and shoots himself in the head. Nearby audience members move away, and the audience gets restless]
HANSEN
Aw, not again.
[The green room. Cartman paces back and forth. The door opens and Kyle walks in]
CARTMAN
Kyle?
KYLE
Surprise, fatass!
CARTMAN
Kyle, what are you doing?
KYLE
I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly! [car horns blare outside, and Kyle goes to take a look. The parking lot quickly fills up as drivers park and leave their cars.] Whoa.
[Outside. Thomas sees the pedophiles coming and motions them into the studio]
PEDO 2
[walks up to Thomas and waves a Wendy's bag in front of him] Hey, I brought you some Wendy's.
THOMAS
Yeah yeah, go on in. There's a hot tub inside. STUPID SHIT!
PEDO 2
Score! [goes inside]
[The studio set. The driver stops in his tracks]
PEDO 2
Oh no, it's Chris Hansen! [drops his meal and shoots himself]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS
Whoa! Who is that? What's going on?
HANSEN
What the hell is going on?!
PEDO 3
Wait a minute. Oh God, it's Chris Hansen! [shoots himself]
PEDO 4
Chris Hansen! [shoots himself]
PEDO 5
Dateline?! [shoots himself]
PEDO 6
I knew it! [shoots himself]
PEDO 7
There aren't really brownies! [shoots himself. More pedophiles enter and kill themselves, and the audience begins rushing out of the studio]
[Outside. Chris Hansen finds Thomas.]
HANSEN
Hey! Do you have something to do with this? Answer meee!
THOMAS
Stupid shit! Cock! [more audience members rush by]
HANSEN
What?! Nobody talks to me like that! Why don't you take a seat? Take a seat, right over there.
THOMAS
Suck it! Asshole licker dickfart!
HANSEN
Why, you lil- I'll, I'll tell on you! [leaves, and there are no other adults left]
CRAIG
[walks up to Thomas] Wow, you're the coolest kid in the world. If I could call Chris Hansen an asshole-licking dickfart to his face, I would be sooo happy.
THOMAS
You would?
CRAIG
Could I just like, hang out with you sometime? Like, do your laundry maybe?
[The studio set. It's dim, and Cartman and Kyle walk onto the set.]
KYLE
[feeling triumphant] Take a look, fatass! I beat you! You aren't going on Dateline; what have you got to say now?! [Cartman is silent for a moment, then hugs Kyle and sobs. Kyle wasn't expecting this]
CARTMAN
Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle!
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man!
KYLE
No, I- I beat you!
CARTMAN
You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say! [heads up the aisle and out of the studio] I got a golden ticket! Thanks to Kyle! I got a golden twinkle in my eye! [Kyle is alone on set, but Thomas comes up and stands next to him]
THOMAS, KYLE
Aww shit!
End of Le Petit Tourette


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Stan's dad Randy becomes South Park's hometown hero when the guys down at the local bar see the size of his most recent crap.

script:More Crap

[Hell's Pass hospital, a patient's room. Randy is sitting on a bed as Dr. Doctor checks his vitals. Randy lets out a sigh of pain.]
DR. DOCTOR
Well, there's no doubt in my mind, Mr. Marsh. You are constipated. [walks over to a table]
RANDY
[quite aware] Thanks for the news flash! I haven't taken a crap in over three weeks! The question is why?!
DR. DOCTOR
Well, what food have you been eating?
RANDY
P.F. Chang's, mostly. [rubs his belly] Good stuff.
DR. DOCTOR
I'm going to prescribe a laxative. [writes out the prescription and turns around] But I must warn you: when you do finally pass this stool, it might be very painful.
RANDY
How painful is "painful"?
[The Marsh house, night. Randy is in the bathroom trying to crap. He strains and groans for a good long while.]
[an Emmy Award statue floats up into view, and a banner saying "EMMY AWARD WINNING SERIES" shimmers after.]
RANDY
Oh God. Oh, here it comes. [he goes for the final push, which has him pushing himself off the toilet seat by his hands several times. A few seconds later, the banner and award disappear] Whoa, hot! Hot hot! Whoaaa hot hot hot hot hot! [a view from the street. Randy's moans can be heard as he can be seen moving about] Whoa, whoaaa! Whoa hot! Hot hot hothothothot hot hot! [back in the bathroom. The stool finally comes out] Dohhhhhhhhhh! Oooh! Oohoo. [begins to sob from relief] Ohhh, it's over. It's over. [reaches for the toilet paper to wipe his ass clean] Oh God. [puts his briefs and pants back up in place] I feel so much better. Oh. [a view from within the toilet: Randy turns around to flush, but stops, looks down, and crouches down for a better look] Wow... That... is huge. That has got to be the biggest crap I've ever taken. He-... Hey Sharon. Sharon you gotta come see this. Sha-Sharon?
SHARON
[opens the door and enters] What is it, Randy? Do you have any- [looks in the toilet] OH! [squeezes her eyes closed and covers them with her right arm] Randy!
RANDY
Will you look at that? Is that the biggest crap you've ever seen or what?
SHARON
[a view from behind the toilet] Flush the toilet for Christ's sake!
RANDY
Come on! That's pretty impressive! [Stan wanders in from the hall, and Randy calls him] Wha-hey Stan! Stan, look at this. [Stan walks closer to the toilet]
SHARON
Randy!
RANDY
[on bended knee next to Stan] Look what your old man made.
STAN
No way!
RANDY
Huh? Never seen one that big, have you?
STAN
No, never. [Shelly wanders in and looks in the toilet]
SHELLY
Gross, Dad, sick! [turns around quick and leaves]
SHARON
All right, will you flush the toilet now?! [crosses her arms]
RANDY
[rises and leans over to flush the toilet. Stan steps out of he way] I'll try, but I don't think- [stand straight again] wait wait wait wait a minute. I gotta call Jimbo first.
SHARON
Why?!
RANDY
Well he's gotta see this.
SHARON
No, we are flushing the toilet right now-
RANDY
[turns around and blocks any access to the toilet] No! Jimbo has to see it so when I tell the guys how big it was, they'll know I'm not lying!
SHARON
Oh, for the love of God, Randy! [turns left and leaves]
RANDY
Sharon, this is important! Stan, go call your Uncle Jimbo. I'm gonna stand guard. [spreads his left and hunches down in a defensive position]
[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails, night. It's open and the sound of men laughing is heard. Inside, the town's men are gathered for Happy Hour. Randy enters the bar]
RANDY
Hey guys!
GERALD
Hey Randy.
STEPHEN
Oh, hey Randy.
STUART
Are you feelin' better?
RANDY
Yeah, I-naw, I'm totally fine now.
JIMBO
You guys shoulda seen the crap Randy took last night! It was honestly, the biggest crap anyone has ever taken. Ever.
RANDY
[being modest] Well I don't know about ever...
JIMBO
I'm tellin' you this thing was the size of a freakin' football.
RANDY
[being modest] I guess it was pretty big.
STUART
A football? That's amazing.
STEPHEN
I've never heard of one that big.
GERALD
[chuckles] Oh, my brother took a crap once, that was enormous. It was the biggest in the history of the world, I think. [laughs. The other guys laugh, but Randy shuts up and looks around]
RANDY
[softly] It wasn't bigger than mine was.
GERALD
Oh no, seriously, this crap was a monster! [laughs. The other guys join in]
RANDY
[softly] Mine... mine was bigger.
GERALD
I doubt it. [snicker]
RANDY
[looks around] You wanna see it?
[Randy's study, later. Randy leads the other men in towards a covered display case. Present are Jimbo, Gerald, Skeeter, Stephen and Stuart. Randy takes off the wraps and steps back so the other guys could behold the greatness that is Randy's crap.]
STUART
Oh my freaking Lord.
SKEETER
That did not seriously come out of your ass.
RANDY
Oh yes, it did. Go ahead and check it for splits. It's one solid piece.
GERALD
Jesus...
RANDY
[feeling vindicated] That uh, a little bigger than your brother's there, Gerald?
GERALD
It's... other-worldly.
STEPHEN
Randy, have you called the people from the Guinness Book of World Records? I mean, this might seriously be the biggest crap in history!
RANDY
[gets out a spray can of water] That's why I gotta make sure to keep it safe. [spritzes the poop so it doesn't dry up and crack apart under the two lights it's under]
SHARON
[at the doorway] Randy Marsh!
RANDY
[quickly hides everything under the wraps] Aw crap!
SHARON
What the hell do you think you're doing keeping that thing in our house?!
RANDY
The guys agree, Sharon: it could be a record holder.
SHARON
Why are men so obsessed with how big their crap is?!
[Guinness Book of World Records, corporate office, day. In the secretary pool, a secretary picks up a phone]
SECRETARY
Guinness World Records America. How can I help you? [listens while typing with the right hand, then stops altogether] The biggest crap? We actually don't keep track of that record, sir. [listens] Because we don't want to. [listens] Look, we get calls from men all the time who believe they took the biggest crap, and we simply can't handle all the measuring and verification. [listens] You need to call the European Fecal Standards and Measurements Office in Zurich. [listens] You're welcome. [hangs up and resumes typing] Jeez, another one. [the phone rings again and she picks up] Guinness World Records America.
RANDY
[gets through. The other guys stand by the sofa] Uhh yes, hello. My name is Randy Marsh, and I believe I took the world's biggest crap. [holds a thumbs up. The other guys do as well]
SECRETARY
[long sigh, then flatly] You need to call the European Fecal Standards and Measurements Office in Zurich. Their number is listed on their Web site.
[European Fecal Standards and Measurements Office, Zurich, day. Majestic music plays. Inside, a woman and several men in judge's robes walk around chatting with other officials]
CHUBBY OFFICIAL
[hands a manila envelope to a balding gray-haired man] Herr President, take a look at this. [the president opens the envelope and looks at a picture within it] It is a crap sent to us from the United States.
EFSM PRESIDENT
Very niiice. [it's a picture of Randy measuring the crap with a measuring tape and grinning at the camera] Has it been checked for accuracy?
CHUBBY OFFICIAL
It appears to be legitimate, based on the photo. We estimate that the crap is over eight and a half Courics!
EFSM PRESIDENT
[serious] We'd better get on a plane. Right away. [smiles]
[Randy's study, some days later. Three representatives of the EFSM Office are inside inspecting the crap as Randy watches on, and sniffing from time to time.]
EFSM PRESIDENT
Hm, enshnusen?
CHUBBY OFFICIAL
Verron snusunarich.
EFSM PRESIDENT
What was your primary diet for this poo, Mr. Marsh?
RANDY
Uhh, mostly P.F. Chang's. General Tso's Chicken... Oh and uh, and a lot of uh Aunt Jemima's Frozen Sausage Biscuits in the morning.
CHUBBY OFFICIAL
I believe I detect some cabbage as well?
RANDY
Ohh yes, I had a lot of kim chee.
SHARON
[at the doorway] You have got to be kidding me.
RANDY
[turns around and marches towards her] These guys are from Zurich, Sharon! They're Europeans! [the EFSM President joins Randy]
EFSM PRESIDENT
It is a tremendous crap, Mr. Marsh.
SHARON
For the love of God!
EFSM PRESIDENT
Your crap officially weighs... 8.6 Courics
RANDY
Courics...
CHUBBY OFFICIAL
The standard measuring unit for human feces. One Katie Couric is approximately two and a half pounds of excrement.
EFSM PRESIDENT
The current record is a crap weighing 7.5 Courics.
RANDY
But that means...
THIRD OFFICIAL
That's right. You are the new world's champion!
RANDY
Really?! Yuh, you mean, REALLY?! [jumps for joy] Hey Stan! I uh- Hey Sharon! Hey everybody! [walks off]
EFSM PRESIDENT
Well, I guess we'd better call the old champion and let him know his record has just been broken.
[An awards ceremony.]
M. C.
He has won twenty-two Grammy's, countless humanitarian awards, and is the only person ever to be nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and the Nobel Peace Prize. Ladies and gentlemen, Bono! [fanfare goes up amid applause. Bono rises from his seat on stage and struts over to the mic. He grabs the award from the M.C., kisses his left index and middle fingers, and throws the kiss off to the audience]
BONO
[wearing a fancy straw cowboy hat] Thank you. Thank you so much for this newest award; it means so much. [a phone rings and he looks around] Oh. Excuse me. I must be getting another award. [reaches into his pocket and pulls out a cell phone. He answers it] Yes?
EFSM PRESIDENT
Yes, Bono, sir, we wish to inform you that your record for biggest crap has just been broken.
BONO
What?! That's impossible! How big was it?
[The White House, day. An elaborate stage with three massive LCD screens is set up. "Stars and Stripes Forever" plays]
SENATOR
We are here to honor the first American to bring home the distinguished EFSM medal for biggest crap ever taken. [applause. The Marshes are present. Randy is decked out in garlands. Sharon looks quite embarrassed. Jimbo, Gerald, Stephen, Stuart, and Skeeter are behind them]
RANDY
Hey look, Sharon, it's the President! He-hey Sharon!
SENATOR
To present the award I give you the dean of the EFSM, Sir Orloff Broloff. [makes way for the dean, who is also the president]
BROLOFF
Thank you, Senator. For over a hundred years, the European Fecal Standards and Meas-
CHUBBY OFFICIAL
Herr Broloff! Herr Broloff! [whispers into his ear]
BROLOFF
Das shpoitenhoff? [to the crowd] Ahhh ladies and gentlemen, I understand we have just received a special video-taped announcement from Bono!
PEOPLE IN CROWD
Oh! Bono? Cool!
BROLOFF
Could we play the tape on the big screen, please?
[The tape. Bono appears onscreen without his hat.]
BONO
Hello everyone! I, am Bono. ["BONO" flashes on the screen a few times, then a short montage with real life photos of Bono performing and holding his awards follows]. "Hello, hello, helloooo. Yeah yeah yeah yeah." ["BONO" flashes on the screen a few times more, then he speaks] For years it has been my honor to try and bring focus to the needs in Africa, and today, I have very exciting news. Last night, at twenty past eight, I took a crap weighing nine and a half Courics.
CROWD
Whoa!
SHARON
[lifts her head up] Bono?! [a black and white photo of Bono laying on his stomach while looking into the camera with his hands directing the viewers to the giant crap. The monster appears next to a Grammy award for comparison - the Grammy looks like a toy]
BONO
As you can see, it is one solid piece. [another black and white shot of him adoring his massive crap on a cushion flanked by two Grammys] It is my biggest crap to date, and I swear to its authenticity. Thank you, and God bless. [an exiting montage follows with the text "BONO" flashing on the screen.] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
BROLOFF
You heard it, ladies and gentlemen! The official biggest crap is... 9.5 Courics! Congratulations to Bono! [fanfare goes up amid applause]
MAN
Bo-no! Woo-ooo!
[The Marsh house, day. Randy sits on the edge of the back porch crying. Stan comes out to check on him]
STAN
Dad, um, I think dinner's almost ready.
RANDY
[from the heart] I almost did it. I almost made something of myself. You know, when you get real close, you start thinking that maybe your life is gonna matter. [sobs some more] I mean, this was something I made! Something that came from me! That was a part of me! The only thing I ever made that was any good!
STAN
Gee, thanks a lot, Dad.
RANDY
[instinctively replies] You're welcome. [continues] And I just,.. I know that this late in my life I'll never come so close to finally having ...meaning.
SHARON
Come on guys, lasagna's ready.
RANDY
[angrily] Oh. Lasagna's ready. [turns around] You hear that, Stan? Mom says lasagna... is ready! I can see through your sarcasm, Sharon!
SHARON
What are you talking about?
RANDY
[walks up to her] You can say it, Sharon! I know Bono's better than me! I'm sorry I'm not Bono, all right?! Sorry that I don't have... billions of dollars and a Nobel prize nomination!
SHARON
Randy, this is ridiculous!
RANDY
[offended] Oh, that's real mature, Sharon! Just act like everything's funny! It's a big joke to you, isn't it?! Just a big joke! [Sharon avoids eye contact] Don't touch me! [pulls away a bit, then goes back inside the house]
SHARON
[to Stan] Can you believe him?! All this over what guy took the biggest crap!
STAN
You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand. [turns around and walks in]
SHARON
Wha? Wha?
[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails, night. The men are gathered there again for Happy Hour, but they're all depressed.]
JIMBO
How come they just let that Bono guy send a picture of his crap?
STUART
'Cause he's Bono, that's why.
STEPHEN
But he could have faked it. It isn't fair!
RANDY
Doesn't matter. He's got the record now; there's nothing I can do.
GERALD
[slams his fist on the counter] Oh yes there is! You could do it again!
RANDY
[incredulous] What?
GERALD
Think about it: you weren't even trying to take the biggest crap last time. Imagine if you actually worked at it!
STEPHEN
[getting enthusiastic] Hey. Hey that's right.
RANDY
Nooo. I can't go through all that again. It's too much.
SKEETER
Come on, Randy. I'll bet you can crap that big again easy!
STUART
With the right diet and training, who knows what you're capable of?
RANDY
[rises and heads for the door] Guys, forget it! It's over! It was a fluke crap; I'll never take one that big again!
STEPHEN
Is it over, Randy?! We all saw that crap you took! That was no fluke! There's something inside you that made you able to do it! Randy, you have a gift. Now who knows why God chose you, but he did! And if you walk away now, you'll always... wonder... how big a crap you could have taken!
RANDY
[with some resignation] I would need a lot of help.
GERALD
That's what we're here for.
JIMBO
Come on, Randy, what do you say?!
RANDY
I say... [turns around] Let's give Bono a run for his money! [the other men are glad to hear this, so they mob him and talk about it] Yeah!! [shakes his head like a lion] YYEEAAHHHH!
[CNN Headline News.]
ANCHORMAN
Tonight, a possible attack on Iran may mean the beginning of a new war in the Middle East.
SHARON
Oh no.
ANCHORMAN
But first, the record for the world's biggest crap: will it again be broken?
SHARON
[disgusted and annoyed] Agh!
ANCHORMAN
Randy Marsh of Colorado is now three weeks into his quest to make a new crap, spending nearly every waking hour at P.F. Chang's. [a shot of Randy feasting away on noodles, shrimp, crab legs, etc.].
FEMALE ANCHOR
Is this really newsworthy?
ANCHORMAN
You just don't understand.
FEMALE ANCHOR
You're right. I don't.
ANCHORMAN
[the camera zooms in on him] At the same time, some people are questioning Bono's current record entry, saying nobody has ever seen it in person. Bono could not be reached for comment, as he is currently in Africa helping the needy.
[An African sunset. Bono dances down a dirt street in a slum, singing "Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah..." His phone rings and he answers it.]
BONO
Hello, hello.
BROLOFF
Marsh is attempting to break the record again. We thought you should know.
BONO
He can't beat my nine and a half Courics!
BROLOFF
Well he's going to try.
BONO
Fine, but he has to take the crap in front of you! In Zurich.
BROLOFF
Bono, we've never had that rule before.
BONO
I's the only way you can know 'e's not cheating! If he doesn't crap in Zurich, it shouldn't count!
[Back at Hell's Pass Hospital. Randy is looking quite bloated now, almost... pregnant.]
ASSISTANT
Ultrasound is very simple, Mr. Marsh. We're going to use harmless waves to look inside your belly. Just gonna put some warm gel on your stomach first. [does this and lets it spread]
RANDY
Oooooo.
ASSISTANT
Okay, take a deep breath. [Randy takes the breath and the assistant puts the camera on the belly, then turns to the monitor to his right] I see the crap now. I can't say for sure, but I, I'd say is about... 14 Courics. [Skeeter, Stephen, Stuart, Gerald and Jimbo are now shown in the room with smiles on their faces. Jimbo is sitting on a chair near the bed holding Randy's hand.]
JIMBO
Fourteen?! [grins]
STEPHEN
That's great, Randy!
RANDY
Can I, can I see it?
ASSISTANT
Sure. [swivels the monitor towards Randy] This is your colon, a-and here... [softly, warmly] is the feces growing inside your belly. [a musicbox begins to play as Randy marvels at his poop]
RANDY
Ahhh...
[an Emmy Award statue floats up into view, and a banner saying "EMMY AWARD WINNING SERIES" shimmers after.]
GERALD
[rushes into the room] Guys, we have a problem! [the Emmy and banner disappear] I talked to the EFSM and they say Randy has to take the crap in Zurich.
RANDY
In Zurich?
GERALD
They say that Bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied.
ASSISTANT
I'm sorry Mr. Marsh, I I cannot condone you traveling on an airplane in your condition. It is never safe to fly during your turd trimester.
[Bono's mansion, big enough to be a hotel. Stan is at the front doors, ringing the bell. A butler opens the doors.]
STAN
Hi, could I speak with Mr. Bono, please?
BUTLER
Mr. Bono, you have a young gentleman caller! [two doors fly open and Bono dances out of a ballroom]
BONO
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [stops in front of a mirror] Get the jet ready, Bovis! I've got to be going. [puts on his hat]
STAN
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap.
BONO
Oh right. He can't make it to Zurich, right?
STAN
That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one?
BONO
[turns around to face Stan] Let him have it? Why would I do that?!
STAN
Look, you you gotta understand, sir. My dad's never won an award for anything. Ever. He doesn't have one single trophy. I mean, even I have a second-place trophy for most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold.
BONO
[walks over to his trophy section and whips out a trophy containing an open magazine.] I have the first-place trophy for that.
STAN
[a bit shocked] Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and, you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of... fuck off?
BONO
[puts the trophy down and goes back to the mirror] I want people to know that I'm worth something. That I matter.
STAN
All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2.
BONO
[insulted] Number two?! NUMBER TWO?! [he turns around and charges towards Stan, grabbing him. He then throws Stan up against a gold record on the wall and holds him there]
STAN
Agh!
BONO
Nobody calls me that anymore and gets away with it! Take it back! TAKE IT BACK!
STAN
I take it back!
BONO
Say I'm not number two!
STAN
You're not number two!
BONO
That's right! I'm not! [releases him and dances back to the ballroom, singing away.] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [The butler returns]
STAN
What is wrong with that guy?
BUTLER
Your father is in grave danger. Come with me! [Stan follows him out]
[EFSM Office, Zurich, day. In the main lobby, Randy is on a toilet made for this occasion, pushing hard to get that poop out, but it's taking a while... He takes several quick breaths to try again... He pushes hard again. Bono is present for the delivery.]
CHUBBY OFFICIAL
It must be quite a crap.
JIMBO
Come on, Randy. You have to push! [Randy takes several more quick breaths and pushes...]
[The German Autobahn. Bono's butler zooms down the road with Stan riding along]
STAN
What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?!
BUTLER
Because nobody has ever taken a crap that big before!
STAN
So Bono's newest record is a lie!
BUTLER
Look, I first knew something was wrong when I looked at Bono's first award for biggest crap. It said he took it in 1960.
STAN
So?
BUTLER
So that's the year Bono was born. Then it all made sense to me. How could Bono be so talented, so caring, and yet seem like such a piece of crap? Because he is crap. Don't you get it? Bono is not the record holder...
STAN
He's the record.
BUTLER
[whispers] Yes.
[EFSM Office, Zurich. Randy has yet to squeeze it out.]
RANDY
[in frustration] I can't do it! I can't do it!
ASSISTANT
The crap is simply too big, Mr. Marsh. We must perform a Caesarean!
RANDY
But then, does it still count?
BONO
Oh no! The biggest crap means you crapped it out!
BROLOFF
I believe that's true. We are sorry, Mr. Marsh, but, if you cannot crap out the crap, it's not really a crap.
RANDY
[sobs] No... Nooo...
JIMBO
There there Randy, you... You gave it your best shot.
RANDY
I want my wife. Sharon? Sharon? [she walks up to him]
SHARON
[pissed off] What?!
RANDY
I'm sorry, Sharon. Sorry that I let you down. Sorry I can't crap like Bono.
BROLOFF
Well congratulations, Bono, it appears your record is intact.
BONO
I had a feeling it would be.
STAN
[runs in] Wait! Stop! Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours.
BONO
Get him out of here!
THIRD OFFICIAL
What are you talking about, young man?
STAN
Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record!
BONO
It's not true! Kill the kid! I want him dead!
BROLOFF
It's too late, Bono. The boy has learned the truth.
CHUBBY OFFICIAL
Herr Broloff, what do you know of this?
BROLOFF
It's true, I'm afraid. You see, until Mr. Marsh came along, I was the record holder for the biggest crap. I took it back in 1960. It was the most amazing crap I'd ever taken.
BONO
Poppa no! Say nothing more!
BROLOFF
Come to me my... darling precious child. [Bono sobs and walks over to him. Broloff hugs him] After I had broken the record I took the crap home. I was so proud of it that I... decided to keep it, to try and raise it like a child.
BONO
No Poppa... No Poppa...
BROLOFF
[strokes his hair] There there, my little crap. [props Bono's chin up] Don't cry. [unbuttons his coat, vest, and shirt] Here, do you want the biddy? Hm? [holds his left breast out to Bono] Does Bono want the biddy? [Bono whimpers and begins sucking on the teat] Yes, he likes the biddy doesn't he?
STAN
Dude.
BROLOFF
I kept the crap in my office, nursed it, fed it biddy. And soon biddy made him strong. Biddy made him grow up! Into one of the most influential figures of our time. [looks down] Easy Bono, that hurts the biddy.
BONO
Biddy. [keeps sucking]
BROLOFF
My little crap has accomplished many things. But he could never shed the fact that he was really... a number two. So he spent his life trying to be number one, in everything.
STAN
That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit.
CHUBBY OFFICIAL
You have blemished this noble society's good name, Herr Broloff.
BROLOFF
Have I?! [pops Bono off his tit. Bono tries helplessly to return to the tit and suck on it] Look at the crap I took all those years ago! Bono is now almost six feet tall and over 80 Courics in weight! No matter how you look at it he IS still the record!
RANDY
Oh God, here it comes! [everyone gathers around him again, even Sharon] Ohhh hot-hot-hot-hot! HOTTT-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot! Hot! Hot! [he poops, and begins to rise and spin as the poop piles on] Ho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ot... [finally stops. Beneath him is a pillar of poop almost seven feet tall]
THIRD OFFICIAL
My God...
CHUBBY OFFICIAL
It must be over a hundred Courics!
STAN
Dad, are you all right?
RANDY
Yeah, I'm... [looks down at his accomplishment] I'm good! [arms akimbo] Feel a lot better.
[an Emmy Award statue floats up into view, and a banner saying "EMMY AWARD WINNING SERIES" shimmers after.]
CHUBBY OFFICIAL
[approaching] Mr. Marsh, we apologize, and if it's okay with you, we would like to present you... your long overdue trophy. [the banner disappears, but the official reaches out and grabs the Emmy. He walks over and jams it into the pillar of poop. Everyone claps except Stan and Sharon.]
End of More Crap


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:When the entire contents of the world's imagination lay open before them, Stan and Kyle step right in. Back in South Park, Cartman swears he's seen a leprechaun.

script:Imaginationland

[The forest outside South Park, day. The camera pans down from the trees and settles on the forest floor, on which Cartman appears, followed by Tweek. Cartman is dressed like a lumberjack, with flannel shirt, vest, and rope.]
CARTMAN
All right, let's try over here. [points straight ahead. Jason appears behind them] Set up traps there, and there as well. [points right] Last time I saw him he ran right through here. [moves, revealing Stan further back. Cartman moves to his left, and Kyle is seen sitting on a fallen tree]
KYLE
This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story.
CARTMAN
[sets up a trip wire between two stones] It isn't a story, it's true! I saw a leprechaun. I've seen him come through here three days in a row now. [drops the rope, walks forward, and whips out a walkie-talkie] Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?
CLYDE
This is Hawk Eyes. We've set up the net and we're standing by. [behind him are Jimmy, Jason, and Craig hoisting the net into place]
CARTMAN
Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out. [Tweek joins Stan in the background]
KYLE
Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!
CARTMAN
O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?! [whips out his walkie talkie] Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie?
TOLKIEN
[pissed off] ... I don't want the code name Blackie.
CARTMAN
Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position! [puts away the walkie talkie and gets back to setting the trip wire.]
KYLE
This is fucking retarded!
CARTMAN
Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you must suck my balls! Don't forget I have a signed contract from you. [finishes setting the trip wire]
KYLE
Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!
CARTMAN
[whispers loudly] Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet? [whips out the walkie talkie] Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot!
BUTTERS
[stands on a lookout platform with a telescope next to him. He answers in a subdued manner] This is faggot. Go ahead.
CARTMAN
Faggot, I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five.
BUTTERS
Okay, will do. Faggot out. [turns right and looks through the telescope] Waagh.
KYLE
Okay, that's enough. [hops off the tree and walks forward] Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!
CARTMAN
It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!
KYLE
You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!
BUTTERS
Uh, I got somethin'! I got it! [the other boys turn and pay attention] It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun!
CARTMAN
[to Tolkien] Set off diversion track C! [Tolkien sets off a small bomb under a pile of leaves. Nearby a leprechaun skips into view, then stops upon seeing the boys]
STAN
Dude...
JIMMY
Fuh, fuck me, it's a leprechaun.
CARTMAN
[charging forth] Get it! [the leprechaun runs away, and all the boys except Kyle, who is dumbfounded, give chase] Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive! [the leprechaun crawls under a tree trunk and gets up. He trips over a rope and a net descends on him; he dodges it and runs off. He runs into a bush and trips a sliding door, which drops down behind him. It traps him in a cage. He looks around for a way out, but sees the boys crowd in.]
BUTTERS
Wow.
STAN
Cool.
CRAIG
No way.
TOLKIEN
Whoa.
JASON
Wow.
CARTMAN
[making his way through, out of breath] Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!
LEPRECHAUN
You lads don't know what you're doin'. I need to deliver an important message! There's goin' to be an attack!
CARTMAN
[gets out a Bowie knife] Tell me where the gold is or you die! [unsheathes it] Slow! [the leprechaun makes a rainbow with his right hand, and it teleports him out and disappears]
STAN
Where'd he go? [the leprechaun appears on a tree limb behind the boys; they turn to look at him again]
LEPRECHAUN
I was sent to warn of a terrorist attack, but you boys have made me late. Now the terrorists will prevail! The end is near! [the leprechaun makes a rainbow with his right hand, and it teleports him away and disappears]
CRAIG
Dude.
CARTMAN
[walks up to Kyle and clears his throat] Kyle, suck my balls. [brings out the contract both of them signed. Kyle stands motionless]
[SOUTH PARK
KYLE SUCKS CARTMAN'S BALLS
THE TRILOGY]
[The dining room. The family is at dinner, eating silently. Kyle has got something on his mind, as he's not eating.]
KYLE
Dad, where do leprechauns come from?
GERALD
[not skipping a beat] From Ireland.
KYLE
So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack?
SHEILA
Kyle, leprechauns aren't real. You're almost nine now; you need to understand the difference beween real and imaginary.
KYLE
I thought I did. [the doorbell rings and Sheila rises to get the door]
CARTMAN
[walks in with the contract and a camera] Ohhh, Ms. Broflovski, how are you this fine evening?
SHEILA
Oh,hello Eric. [leads him to the dining room] Kyle, your friend is here.
CARTMAN
Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn't it? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes.
KYLE
[gets off his seat and stands between Cartman and the table] Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner!
CARTMAN
Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth.
KYLE
I'm not doing it, fatass!
GERALD
Doing what?
CARTMAN
We had a deal, Kyle!
KYLE
Just get out of here!
CARTMAN
[walks up to Kyle] You signed an agreement, Kyle!!
KYLE
I don't care if I signed an agreement!
GERALD
Ah hey now Kyle, if you made a deal with somebody, you have to stick by it.
CARTMAN
Thank you, Mr. Broflovski.
GERALD
What was the agreement?
KYLE
That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls.
SHEILA
Whatwhatwhat?!
CARTMAN
And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!
[A neighborhood clearing, day. Stan, Butters, Jimmy, and Kenny are working on a massive snow sculpture. Kyle walks up to them.]
KYLE
Hey dudes. [the boys stop and pay attention]
JIMMY
Hey Kyle. So, ...how was it?
KYLE
How was what?
JIMMY
Sucking Cartman's b-balls.
KYLE
I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to!
STAN
[walks up to him] Dude, why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place?
KYLE
Uch, I didn't think there would actually be a leprechaun! And I still don't! Why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack?! There's another explanation for all this.
FANCIFUL MAYOR
[dressed in a Southern Victorian outfit, polka-dotted yellow pants, and curled shoes] Excuse me. Have you boys seen a leprechaun anywhere lately?
STAN
...What do you know about the leprechaun?
FANCIFUL MAYOR
Ooooo, then you did see him. [twirls] That's splendiferous! I want you to tell me everything he said. Where was he? What was he doing?
KYLE
All right I've had enough! Leprechauns are imaginary!
FANCIFUL MAYOR
Well of course they are. But just because they're imaginary doesn't mean they're not real. Haven't you boys ever used your imagination? [whips out a striped cane and turns to Stan] You young man! How would you like to be a cowboy? Or a- swashbuckling pirate? [moves over to Kyle] And you! How would you like to be an astronaut, faaar out in space? All it takes is a little... [taps his head with his left hand] imagination.
STAN
Who the hell are you?
FANCIFUL MAYOR
Still not convinced, eh? I tell you what, boys. What say we all take a ride on my... Imagination Flying Machine? [before them appears an elegant red blimp with four smaller yellow balloons from which hangs a small wooden ship with three wheels underneath it for landing on solid ground]
KYLE
Dude.
FANCIFUL MAYOR
Hop aboard, kids. I have something to show you.
BUTTERS
Uhhh, are you gonna rape us?
FANCIFUL MAYOR
[confused] Ubeuh... uh... n... no?
BUTTERS
Ah, all right then.
STAN
Come on, guys. [the others follow him, with Butters trailing.]
BUTTERS
Watch it, fellas. I'm pretty sure this guy wants to rape us.
FANCIFUL MAYOR
All aboard the Imagination Balloon! [sounds the boarding bell and lifts off as the boys draw up the rope ladder.]

Some people feel imagination isn't real, but I tell them that they're wrong,
'cause whenever I want to play and pretend, I just sing the Imagination Sooong
[the song consists of the one word "imagination," repeated. The ship floats lazily over the countryside, then over the Platte river and a bridge, then over another river flanked by meadows and woods, and ever higher into the sky, then over the Rockies].
KYLE
[at his limit] Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!
FANCIFUL MAYOR
Oh- Ohhh. But my boy, we're already here.
[Imaginationland, where whatever fantastical creatures you could imagine exists. There are two moons and two pointy stars in the sky and mountains whose tops bend over like witches' hats. There are castles everywhere with flags atop them. As the Imagination Balloon floats in, a flying giraffe is shown, as is a flying city, a griffin, an elevated tram and its cars, and many, many creatures strange and familiar. The creatures all turn to see the ship and follow it to its landing]
THE BOYS
Whoa...
STAN
What is this place?
FANCIFUL MAYOR
This... is Imaginationland. [a yellow rocket flies in and lands on its own] It's where all the wonderful and goofy things that humans have made up over the years live together. [more of the land and its inhabitants are shown, and the balloon finally lands in the middle of town. The Mayor climbs down the rope ladder] Citizens of Imaginationland! We have distinguished guests from the world beyond! [the creatures ooo and aaa about them]
CHEETARA
Hello. [the boys climb down. Butters is excited]
LOLLIPOP KING
[a walking lollipop with a crown and lollipop scepter] Welcome to Imaginationland. I am the Lollipop King.
MR. TUMNUS
[bows] We are honored to have Creators in our kingdom.
FANCIFUL MAYOR
Now, good news, everyone! These boys did see the leprechaun! [the creatures jump for joy]
PAT THE HAMMER
What did he tell you? Did he have any news?
STAN
[hesitantly] Well he said there was gonna be a- ...that there was... gonna be a-
A TERRORIST
[runs in out of nowhere] ALLAH!!! [he stops, rips open his jacket, and shows off the bombs strapped to his body]
FANCIFUL MAYOR
[closeup] OH FUCK NO! [the terrorist sets off the bomb as everyone else leans back. The explosion sends creatures flying everywhere, with some of them dying as their bodies fall apart. Charlie Brown is blown away, losing his left leg below the knee.]
CHARLIE BROWN
Awwwgh! [falls on his face]
CHEETARA
[running past Stan] AAAAAH!
[Stan is battered and looks for shelter. He finds it under a giant mushroom. He is now in a daze and time begins to move slowly for him. He watches as Raggedy Ann tries to revive a destroyed Raggedy Andy, but it's no use. He then turns to see Santa set ablaze and set two moon-bellied sneetches on fire. The action takes on a war-ravaged tone as Ronald McDonald finds he's lost his right arm. He sees it on the floor and walks over to pick it up with his left hand. He winces, then sees a large building go up in flames as burning creatures run about. An explosion sends the building's tower crashing down in front of the building. The terrorist fires away with his automatic machine gun. Stan begins to recover as he puts his cap back on. A faun runs past him in the background, and Kyle arrives. His lips move slowly and Stan doesn't know what he's saying.]
KYLE
[above all the noise] Stan, we have to get out of here!! [Jimmy is with him. The three take off. The terrorist appears behind them, but doesn't see them. Kenny joins the group as a dragon drops down from the sky.]
DRACO
Quickly boys! Get on my back! [the boys climb on and Draco takes off]
BUTTERS
Fellas! Fellas wait! [the boys look back at Butters, who is running up to them as fast as he can] Hold on, fellas!
STAN
Butters.
BUTTERS
Don't leave me, fellas! Come back! [a terrorist knocks him down with the butt of his gun, then kicks him around. Two other terrorists join in]
KYLE
Dude! [the terrorists keep kicking Butters around]
BUTTERS
Hey guys!
THE BOYS
Butters!
[The Broflovski House, morning. Kyle wakes up startled in his room and sits up.]
KYLE
A-ah! A-a-ah! Wha? Where...? Oh. Oh dude. Oh, it was just a dream. It was all just a crazy dream. Huh, oh my God. [gets out of bed and walks off]
[The Marsh house, morning. Stan is eating cereal at the breakfast table when the phone rings.]
STAN
[picks up] Hello?
KYLE
Dude, did you finish your math homework? I kind of lost track of time last night.
STAN
No no I I hardly got any sleep. I had this whole messed up dream about some gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live?
KYLE
[speechless, then] ...And then it got attacked by terrorists?
STAN
Yeah! How'd you know?
KYLE
Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind!
SHARON
[enters the kitchen] Stan? Stanley? You haven't seen your little friend Butters, have you? [with her are Butters' parents. Linda is distraught]
STAN
Why?
LINDA
Our darling Butters never came home last night.
KYLE
What did they say??
STEPHEN
We don't wanna jump to conclusions, but... we're worried that maybe somebody kidnapped Butters, sodomized him over and over again, and then fed his genitals to wild animals. [Linda starts crying] There there, darling.
KYLE
[hearing the crying] ...Dude...
[The Pentagon, Washington D.C., day.]
GENERAL DECKTER
[serious] Ladies and gentlemen, I have dire news. Yesterday, at approximately 18:00 hours, terrorists successfully attacked... our imagination. [the other officials there look around and murmur at each other]
MAN 1
Our imagination?
WOMAN 1
[behind him, with gray hair] How?
SPECIALIST
The imaginary attack appears to have been in the works for years. The effects of the attack are so far... unimaginable.
GENERAL DECKTER
We've intercepted this videotape the terrorists made for broadcast. Luckily we've kept it from being broadcast to the public. [clicks on a remote control, and the video appears onscreen. The Fanciful Mayor is on the ground with a blindfold on. A Care Bear sits to his right with a blindfold on as well. The terrorist starts speaking, then backs up to shoot a Care Bear in the head]
FANCIFUL MAYOR
No! It's just a Care Bear! [a terrorist knocks him down with the butt of his gun. A fairy godmother walks up to check on him]
MAN 2
Oh my God.
GENERAL DECKTER
[fast forwards the tape] Later in the video we can see another imaginary hostage; this one reading a forced statement.
BUTTERS
[reading the statement at gunpoint] Praise to the mighty Allah. His divine grace a-and will have brought forth this day. [a terrorists brings forth a severed bear head to show the viewers] Oh jeez! [the terrorist withdraws] Uhhh, nnow see, your safety is at our whim. This is the price you pay, America! You have defiled Allah, and now we will turn your imagination against you! Death to the Infidels! [there's no more to read] Can I go now? [two terrorists come up and drag him away. The one wearing a vest takes the statement away from Butters.] Stan! Kyle! Could you could you get me out of here?? [the tape is stopped]
GENERAL DECKTER
Gentlemen, the terrorists appear to have complete control of our imagination. It's only a matter of time before... our imaginations start running wild.
[Colorado State Courthouse, day.]
CARTMAN
[as the plaintiff, with a lawyer] I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt. [Kyle is the defendant, without a laywer] A travesty has occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show any intention, of ever sucking my balls! [the judge can't believe what she's hearing] I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and still, my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to!
JUDGE
[looks over the contract in front of her] Mr. Broflovski, did you agree to orally imbibe Mr. Cartman's scrotum and testicles?
KYLE
I...
JUDGE
[shows Kyle the contract] Is this not your signature on the contract?
KYLE
Uh... W-uh... but... Come o- come on! Really? I mean, aren't there more important things going on right now?
JUDGE
From what I've been presented and the evidence put forth, the court has no choice but to order you to place Mr. Cartman's pubicle sac in your mouth, and draw upon it succulently for no less than 30 seconds.
CARTMAN
[pumps his left fist] Yesss!
JUDGE
You have twenty four hours to suck aforementioned balls. If after that time you still refuse, the court will be forced to arrest you for contempt. Next case! [lowers the gavel. The camera is in a position to see it block Kyle from view.]
CARTMAN
Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls.
[The Pentagon, Washington D.C., day. General Deckter and four of his top people sit opposite a dark-skinned man. There are other people present]
GENERAL DECKTER
What I am about to tell you is highly classified. Two days ago, Muslim terrorists hijacked our imagination. [the man is now shown close up] Frankly we don't know what their next move is or how to stop them.
SPECIALIST
In times like these the government often turns to Hollywood for help. You creative filmmakers can think of idea we just can't.
GENERAL DECKTER
That's why we've asked you here, M. Night Shyal-amalam. [the camera zooms out a bit and shows the name tag in front of the man: the director M. Night Shyalaman] The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village, all very clever films. But can you use your amazing idea brain now to help us stop the terrorists?
M. NIGHT SHYALAMAN
What if... [the top officials lean in] What if it turns out they aren't terrorists? But they're actually werewolves? From the future?
GENERAL DECKTER
N, no. No, they're terrorists. They've been linked to Al Qaeda.
M. NIGHT SHYALAMAN
But what if Al Qaeda, it turns out, is the group being terrorized? By aliens?
GENERAL DECKTER
No- No. That's not an idea, that's a twist. We need ideas.
M. NIGHT SHYALAMAN
How about we make everyone think that terrorists attacked us? But really, we were all already dead.
GENERAL DECKTER
[to the specialist] Get him out of here. [M. Night Shyalaman is hauled away, only to be replaced by...] Mr. Bay, can you think of any idea how to outwit these terrorists?
MICHAEL BAY
I believe I can. [the officials get their pens ready to write] We start... by making a big CG building and then we have a meteor go CROSSHH! [makes a diving motion with his left arm] and it, and it's all like CRAAWWWLL [simulates an explosion with his arms] a-and motorcycles burst into flame while they jump over these helicopters, right? [has his right hand go over his left arm like a motorcycle over a helicopter]
GENERAL DECKTER
[firmly] No no! We need ideas how to stop the terrorists!
MICHAEL BAY
An eighteen-wheeler spins out of control and it's all like BROSSHH [makes a crashing motion with his right hand] And then this huuuge tanker full of dyna- [launches into a series of explosions]
GENERAL DECKTER
[fed up] Those aren't ideas, those are special effects!
MICHAEL BAY
I... don't understand the difference.
GENERAL DECKTER
I know you don't. Get him out of here! [next in the chair is Mel Gibson] Aaand being that we are all big Mel Gibson film fans, we thought maybe you could help us.
MEL GIBSON
[twisting his hipples hard] Ah, my nipples, they hurt! They hurt when I twist them!
GENERAL DECKTER
[dismayed, drops his head into his left hand] Yes, uh, I don't suppose you have any creative ideas how to fight these terrorists?
MEL GIBSON
How about this? You have that tape that the terrorists made, right? Well, maybe if you did a background check on that videotape, you might find somebody who doesn't belong. Somebody who doesn't fit in Imaginationland![twists his nipples again] Ohhh!
SPECIALIST
Heyy... that's not a bad idea.
GENERAL DECKTER
Yeah. Say what you will about Mel Gibson, but the son of a bitch knows story structure. Get the videotape and do a background check on everyone in it!
MEL GIBSON
[twists his nipples from the excitement] Oogh! Yess! [grins]
[some hours later.]
SPECIALIST
All the imaginary characters in the tape were identified, sir. Count Chocula, Cinderella, Snarf from Thundercats... But here. [clicks. Butters is shown in full] Nothing in American folklore or storytelling match this kid. He appears to be... just some kid. [zooms into Butters. The last few seconds of the tape are replayed: "Stan! Kyle! Could you could you get me out of here??"]
GENERAL DECKTER
[determined] I want digital imaging and resource magnification done stat! [slams his right fist into his left hand] If that kid isn't imaginary, I want to know who he is, where he's from, and who his friends are!
SPECIALIST
Yes sir! [leaves, and General Deckter is alone in the meeting room with Butters' image]
GENERAL DECKTER
[walks up to the screen and stares intently at Butters' image] Who are you?...
[Imaginationland, the aftermath. Butters and the Mayor have been released and join the survivors. Mighty Mouse sits on a talking suitcase, Link tends to Tumnus. Other survivors are the Flash, the Wild Thing, H.R. Pufnstuf, Count Chocula, Orko, Pat the Hammer, Cinderella, Totoro, and Humpty Dumpty]
BUTTERS
Uh, excuse me? Uh Mr. Terrorist, sir? [a shot of the terrorists arming the rocket from the beginning of the episode] Uh, I'm actually not imaginary, a-and um, my p-my parents are gonna ground me if I don't get back- [one of the terrorists says something to him and cocks his gun] Aaah! [holds out his palms and backs up to join the survivors] Okay, sorry. Uh sorry.
PAT THE HAMMER
Can you tell what the terrorists are doing?
FANCIFUL MAYOR
They're going something to Rockety Rocket.
ROCKETY ROCKET
No! Leave me alone! Haaa!
CINDERELLA
It doesn't make sense. What do they want with Rockety?
FANCIFUL MAYOR
The only reason they would- [shuts up upon a realization] Oh my God. They're gonna blow up the Barrier!
BUTTERS
Uh what's the Barrier?
FANCIFUL MAYOR
The wall! The wall which separates the evil side of Imaginationland from the good side! [the wall, which is rather low, is shown. Beyond it is a dark place, full of lightning and unknown dangers]
ROCKETY ROCKET
No! No you can't blow up the barrier! Are you insane?! [the terrorists talk amongst themselves]
CINDERELLA
We can't let this happen.
SUITCASE
It will be the end of Imaginationland.
PAT THE HAMMER
Yeah. You have to stop them, kid.
BUTTERS
Me?? Woo, what am I supposed to do?
FANCIFUL MAYOR
Don't you get it?! If the terrorists blow that barrier, all the most evil things ever imagined are gonna pour out and take over Imaginationland for good! YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING!!
BUTTERS
[frightened] Waaahaa!
[Cartman's house, day. He's the the whole house decked out for a party. A lush Arabian party. Persian throw rugs are spread out all over the floor. The sofa has been converted into a royal litter. His classmates mill around drinking juice. Cartman enters the living room dressed as a sultan]
CARTMAN
Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives.
CRAIG
He's not gonna show up to suck your balls dude.
CARTMAN
He has to. He's been ordered by the court.
CLYDE
Hey, he's here. [the kids turn to face the front door. Stan and Kyle walk towards the house together]
CARTMAN
What? Move aside, move aside! [moves through the crowd to the door]
STAN
Dude, do you really have to do it?
KYLE
Let's just get this over with!
CARTMAN
Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls.
KYLE
God damnit!
CARTMAN
Yehehehesss. Yehhhs! [the sound of helicopters ruins the moment as Cartman's smile vanishes and he looks around. Stan and Kyle turn around and see the helicopters. Police cars and government vehicles converge on Cartman's house as the copters land. General Deckter, specialist, two soldiers, and two security guards pour out of the helicopter]
SPECIALIST
That's them, sir. Stan Marsh and Kyle Broflovski.
GENERAL DECKTER
You boys need to come with us on a matter of national security.
KYLE
Who are you?
GENERAL DECKTER
There's no time! You need to come with us right now! [prods the boys towards the waiting helicopter]
CARTMAN
[runs up and grabs Kyle's free hand] Hey, let go of him! [Kyle is now in a tug of war between Cartman and General Deckter]
GENERAL DECKTER
We aren't going to hurt your little friends. We just need information.
CARTMAN
No! No, he has to suck my balls! [loses his hold on Kyle and falls to the sidewalk on all fours. He gets up and runs after the helicopter, which takes off quickly. All the other vehicles pull out. Cartman runs down the street a bit] NO! KYYYYLE! [loses his turban]
[Imaginationland. The terrorists make the end run with Rockety Rocket towards the Barrier.]
ROCKETY ROCKET
No! Noooo! [Butters comes into view to stop them]
BUTTERS
Hold on! Hold on a second! [the terrorists screech to a halt] Now, you really should think about this. I mean, uh, I I know you think attacking our imagination will get you somewhere, but will it really? If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts of our imagination are gonna break loose, but... will it really make you terrorists feel better? Maybe it's time for us all to just... get along.
TERRORISTS
[having had time to think about it, they give their answer] ALLAH!! [they charge forth with Rockety Rocket toward the door, then push him forward. Butters jumps out of the way.]
ROCKETY ROCKET
AAAAAAAH! Jesus Christ, no!! [reaches the door and blows up. The terrorists cheer and fire away into the air. Butters gets up near the survivors]
FANCIFUL MAYOR
That was your plan to stop them??
BUTTERS
Y-yeah, and that's not a heartfelt speech?
FANCIFUL MAYOR
That's fucking stupid! [the ground begins to shake under them as rumbles come from the evil side of Imaginationland. The terrorists stop firing. Cracks appear on the door. The Mayor says with dread] They are coming... [the door falls apart. "TO BE CONTINUED" appears over the action]
[The desert, day. An oil rig moves east. The cab is red with a white stripe. Cartman is inside with the driver]
DRIVER
Glad I picked you up, kid. It's dangerous for someone your age to be hitchhikin'
CARTMAN
Yeah well, when a man has been wronged... he no longer cares about danger.
DRIVER
You goin' to Washington to visit family?
CARTMAN
I've got unfinished business. You go through life being told there's justice, then you learn that the only real justice... [looks at a picture of Kyle] is the justice you take. [to the picture] Make no mistake, Kyle. Before this is over, you will suck my balls. [runs his finger over Kyle's mouth]
End of Imaginationland


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:After the wall in Imaginationland is blown up by terrorists, the evil side crosses over. Cartman tracks down Kyle and Stan at the Pentagon and demands Kyle makes good on their agreement. Meanwhile, U.S. troops cross over into Imaginationland while evil characters cross over into reality.

[Butters' room, morning.]
STEPHEN
[voiceover] Butters, time for breakfast.
BUTTERS
Buh, huh, but... Oh jeez, it was just a dream.
STEPHEN
[enters with Linda, who's holding a plate] Come on, Butters. Mom's cooked waffles and nanas for you.
BUTTERS
[chuckles with relief] Hoho! Mom, Dad, I dreamt I was in Imaginationland and, and terrorists attacked it.

You are in Imaginationland. This is a dream.
BUTTERS
Huh?

Look! The evil of Imaginationland is coming out! [monsters from the evil side pour through the broken wall. The survivors from the terrorist attack turn and run away]
BUTTERS
Oh hamburgers! [the terrorists fire off their guns, but a monster wipes them out]
FANCIFUL MAYOR
Everyone! Fall back to the Gumdrop Forest! [catches up to Butters] Come with me, little boy! I'm going to get you home! [an Alien jumps into view and jumps around the Mayor]
BUTTERS
WAAAA! It's Alien! [points to the Xenomorph, which grabs the Mayor, lifts him up, and attacks him from behind and pierces right through him, killing him instantly. Butters runs away, only to be spotted by a Predator with laser sights. Butters avoids the lasers] Predator! Wha? [an army of Imperial Stormtroopers head his way. A heavy footfall behind him alerts him to Jason Voorhees's presence. He jumps] Huh? [Jason takes out his machete and slashes at him, but Butters ducks it and runs away] WAAAAAH! HAAAAAAAA! [geometric shapes and Tribbles join the fray]
[The Pentagon, day. General Deckter and his specialist interrogate Stan and Kyle in the same room the directors were in previously. General Deckter paces back and forth.]
STAN
Look, we already told you everything we know. Some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into Imaginationland.
GENERAL DECKTER
[stops and places his hands on the table] What we want to know is how! We need to find a way into Imaginationland; you've been there! How did you do it?!
KYLE
We just... went on a balloon ride.
SPECIALIST
There must have been some kind of portal or doorway.
STAN
Dude, we don't remember.
GENERAL DECKTER
Do you realize what's goin' on here?! Terrorists have attacked our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild! [wags his left index finger at them] You'd better start remembering!
SPECIALIST
It was the Chinese, wasn't it?
KYLE
...What?
SPECIALIST
We've suspected that the Chinese government was working on a doorway to the imagination. [wags his right index finger at them] Is that where you were?!
STAN
No.
GENERAL DECKTER
That's it, isn't it?! Where do the Chinese keep this portal? How does it work?
SPECIALIST
It is better than ours?
STAN
Your what?
SPECIALIST
Our portal to the imagination built as a secret project back in 1962 to fight the Soviets-
GENERAL DECKTER
[puts his hands on his hips] Shhh! Tom! That's super-secret.
TOM
[a bit chagrined] Ohh, I'm sorry sir.
KYLE
Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination?
GENERAL DECKTER
Aw, see? Good job, Tom! Why don't you just tell them everything about Project X?!
TOM
Yes sir. [to the boys] We built a portal to the imagination to use against the Russians during the Cold War, but we never got a-
GENERAL DECKTER
THAT WAS SARCASM. I was being sarcastic, you fucking idiot!
TOM
[more chagrined] Aw jeez, I'm really sorry sir.
STAN
If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us?
GENERAL DECKTER
[turns his back to the boys] All right, we might as well show it to them. [whispers] God-dammit, Tom.
[Darkness.]
CARTMAN
[voiceover] Every night, the dream is the same. [a field of grain pops up with purple mountains in the background. Cartman walks in smiling and holding the contract] I'm on my way to visit my friend Kyle, because we had a bet that if I could prove leprechauns were real, he would suck my balls. [Kyle is standing in the field, and Cartman walks up to him] And it turns out I was right. "Time to pay up, Kyle." [Kyle's name echoes into the distance] But then... [Kyle turns around with his mouth sewn shut] "NO! NOOO!" [Cartman rises into the air and the field fades to black] It's been taken from me. I have dry balls. Balls so dry they explode like dust. [he floats through the darkness, completely naked. His right testicle pops and dissolves into the air, triggering him to moan in agony. His left one does the same, and there's no penis left either.]
CARTMAN
(echoing) Aaaaahhhh...
[In a bus. Cartman shakes himself awake]
ELDERLY WOMAN
You okay, kid?
CARTMAN
NO! I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.
[The Pentagon, the portal. The technicians prepare the portal]
GENERAL DECKTER
Ever since the Cold War, the U.S. Government has been working on a secret project to build a doorway into the imagination. It is called "Project Imagination Doorway."
STAN
That's not very imaginative.
GENERAL DECKTER
According to all the tests and the data, the doorway should work, but... it never has.
LEAD TECH
But we're close, sir. We're real close.
GENERAL DECKTER
They've been saying that for over forty years.
LEAD TECH
[walks up and stands next to General Deckter] You're the ones, right? The kids who have been in the imagination.
KYLE
Ah I guess.
LEAD TECH
What was the sequence that got you inside? We know there's some kind of... resonance code, but we can't figure it out.
KYLE
Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there.
GENERAL DECKTER
Song? You didn't say anything about a song before.
LEAD TECH
What song?
STAN
The Imagination song?
LEAD TECH
That could be it. The fractal converter has never worked because it was waiting for a multitonal code!
GENERAL DECKTER
Quick boys: how does the Imagination Song go?
STAN, KYLE
[unsure of the notes] Imaginaaaation Imaginaaaation
OPERATOR
Sir, uh I'm getting some electrofeedback from the gate. Ih it's weak, but it's nanoresponding to something.
LEAD TECH
[urgently] Was there more to the Imagination Song? Ha, how does the rest of it go?
STAN, KYLE
Imaginaaaation. Imaginaaaa-
KYLE
No, no dude, it went up there.
STAN
Imagina-he-hey-
KYLE
Imagina-eh
STAN
[to General Deckter] Dude, we don't remember. It was really long and stupid.
GENERAL DECKTER
I'm just about through playing with you boys! We're running out of time! You have to remember that song in its entirety! [Stan and Kyle look at each other.]
[The Gumdrop forest. The Mayor is flat on his back, still alive, but with heavy blood loss. He gargles in trying to move. The Lollipop King and Butters gather around him.]
LOLLIPOP KING
Mayor, Mayor, what are we supposed to do?
BUTTERS
Please, sir. I have to get home to my world.
FANCIFUL MAYOR
Oh, well. All you have to do is tap your heels together three times.
BUTTERS
Really?
FANCIFUL MAYOR
NO, you fucking dipshit, that was a joke! [groans for a few seconds more]
SNARF
Mayor, what are we supposed to do, shnarf shnarf?
FANCIFUL MAYOR
Get to Castle Sunshine! It's your only hope!
LOLLIPOP KING
Castle Sunshine?
FANCIFUL MAYOR
Through the Gumdrop Forest. Others will be hiding there; go, run! Look out for the evil characters! They're assembling on the Yum Yum mountain! [groans once more and dies]
[The evil characters have gathered in a clearing in the woods of Yum Yum mountain.]
ORC
We are free! Now all of Imaginationland is ours!
THE MINOTAUR
Not all, foolish orc! There are still parts of Imaginationland we don't control.
FREDDY KRUEGER
Tomorrow, we shall build our own castle right on this spot!
THE MINOTAUR
Who put you in charge, Krueger?! I am the most evil character here!
MANBEARPIG
[half bear, half manpig] Nonsense! [somehow, he's been spliced together and brought to life] Your evil is stale!
HEADLESS HORSEMAN
[holding a flaming jack-o-lantern on his left hand] I am the most evil imaginary character! [Krueger hisses]
SQUIRRELLY SQUIRREL
[hops into view] Now come on y'all. We shouldn't be fightin', we're supposed to all be on the same side. [the rest of the Woodland Critters arrive]
CRITTER
Yeah. You're all right, Squirrelly Squirrel.
WOODLAND CRITTERS
Yaaaay!
THE MINOTAUR
What evil imaginary characters are they?
CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON
They were dreamt up by some fourth grade kid as part of his Christmas Story..
SQUIRRELLY SQUIRREL
Now come on y'all. We can't waste time arguing, there could still be survivors out there. We need to hunt them down, and kill them.
RABBITY RABBIT
And eat their flesh!
BEAVERY BEAVER
B'hut first we should rape them!
BEARY BEAR
How about we kill them, and then rape their bodies so we can use their blood as lubricant?
SQUIRRELLY SQUIRREL
Say, that's a great idea, Beary Bear. [the Critters cheer and jump for joy]
JASON VOORHEES
[to Khan in a campish voice] Man, I do not want to meet the kid that dreamt THOSE things up.
[The Mall at Washington D.C., Day. Cartman has arrived and is on a pay phone.]
CARTMAN
Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?!
SECRETARY
[at the Pentagon] I'm sorry, sir. That information is classified.
CARTMAN
Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!
SECRETARY
[sees Tom arriving] There's somebody asking a lot of questions about what's going on.
TOM
Let me handle this! [takes the receiver] I'm sorry, but there is no such thing as Project Imagination Doorway! [listens] Imagination Doorway. It was started in the Sixties as a secret government project. Right.
[The portal inside the Pentagon, day. Stan and Kyle rehearse the song, singing better on key than before.]
STAN, KYLE
Imagina-a-ation, Imagina-
STAN
Waitwaitwait, maybe that's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation.
KYLE
Right, then it was
"Imagina-ation, Imagina-ation. Imagina-atio-on"
[the lights dim and the portal begins to glow. The boys are confused for a moment, then face the portal with the other people present]
LEAD TECH
It's open! It's open!
OPERATOR
Getting readings from the other side... the, that's it. We've made an opening to our imagination, sir! [the officers and techs all cheer and hug each other. Stan and Kyle stand there, awed]
GENERAL DECKTER
All right, that's enough! We've still got a lot of work to do, people! Its time to go in and get our imaginations under control!
[The Gumdrop forest. Butters walks with Snarf and the Lollipop King along a multicolored road. Huge gumdrops line the road on either side]
BUTTERS
How much further to Castle Sunshine?
SNARF
Snarf, I'm not sure snarf snarf. I've never been. [a female scream stops them in their tracks]
BUTTERS
What was that?
LOLLIPOP KING
[walks to his left into the woods] Over here. [the other two follow and peer over some bushes] Oh Christ. Its Strawberry Shortcake. [in a clearing, Strawberry Shortcake sits on a stump, tied up so she can't move. Many evil characters surround her, ready to do her great harm]
STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE
Please, let me go. [the Headless Horseman kicks her] Wuh. [Frankenstein's Monster kicks her] Wuh! [an Imperial Stormtrooper smacks her around with his rifle] Dugh! [Jason walks up and put his knife under her eyes...]
SNARF
Oh my God! Snarf. [and scoops out her left eyeball.]
STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE
Aaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah!
THE MINOTAUR
Now kill her!
SQUIRRELLY SQUIRREL
[the Woodland Critters show up] Whoa whoa, hang on, y'all. You can't just kill her. That's not evil enough.
FREDDY KRUEGER
What do you mean? We cut out her eyeball.
JASON VOORHEES
Yeah, that's super hardcore.
SQUIRRELLY SQUIRREL
Now come on y'all. We can do better than that.
BEAVERY BEAVER
Hey! I know! Let's all pee in her empty eye socket!
DEERY DEER
Let's make her eat her own eyeball, and then pee in her empty eyesocket.
BEARY BEAR
How about we get someone with AIDS to pee in her eyesocket, so she dies all slowlike? [the other Critters cheer at the idea]
THE MINOTAUR
Nobody here has AIDS!
WOODLAND CRITTERS
Awwww!!
BEARY BEAR
But we've got to have AIDS before we pee in her eyesocket!
SQUIRRELLY SQUIRREL
Now don't be down y'all. I bet we can find some AIDS out in the forest. [the Critters scatter in renewed enthusiasm]
LOLLIPOP KING
Dude, run, run, ruuun! [Butters and Snarf leave quickly, and he follows]
[The portal at the Pentagon. Some army troops in camouflage arrive and the techs finish up preparations. General Deckter paces in front of the soldiers.]
GENERAL DECKTER
All right, men. We don't know what you'll experience on the other side of this doorway, but it will most likely be really weird. If you reach our imagination, you are to take every step necessary to get it under control! Are you ready?
SOLDIERS
Yes sir!
GENERAL DECKTER
Are you ready, Kurt Russell?
KURT RUSSELL
[dressed in camouflage like the others] I... I don't understand why I'm here. I I'm just an actor.
GENERAL DECKTER
Yes, but you were in that one movie that was kinda like this. That gives you more experience than anybody. All right, here we go! Men! Forwaaard!
TECH 1
Sir, we have a security breach!
GENERAL DECKTER
What?!
TECH
There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!
GENERAL DECKTER
Sector Two?? [a large window at the far end of the room shatters as Cartman tumbles in, landing on his back. Everyone turns to see him]
KYLE
Cartman??
CARTMAN
[gets up quickly and marches towards Kyle] Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?!
GENERAL DECKTER
Who the hell are you?!
CARTMAN
That kid you have made a bet that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!
GENERAL DECKTER
Get him out of here!
CARTMAN
[some guards seize him and begin to drag him away] No! Hold on a second! [they stop and let him go] I have a contract [holds it out] validated by the United States court system!
GENERAL DECKTER
Let me see that! [a guard takes it from Cartman over to General Deckter, who reads it over] Why would you agree to suck someone's balls?
KYLE
I didn't think there was going to be a goddamned leperachaun!!!
GENERAL DECKTER
All right, you two can go use the conference room. Go on, we have work to do here.
KYLE
[stunned] Wha?! Well wait, ahah I wanna see what happens here!
DECKTER
You signed an agreement, kid. We don't have time for this. Go on and do it.
KYLE
[looks at General Deckter, than at Stan] Stan?
STAN
Dude, you did make a deal... [Kyle has run out of appeals and reluctantly follows Cartman out]
CARTMAN
Theee conference room is which way? [smiles]
[Conference room, later. Cartman and Kyle sit facing each other.]
CARTMAN
Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you.
KYLE
I didn't "bail," I got picked up by the government!
CARTMAN
Well we're here now, that's all that matters. [brings up a small cup of mixed nuts] Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.
KYLE
Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-
CARTMAN
[cuts him off with a loud yawn and hops off his chair] Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle. [walks towards a tripod and sets a camera on it] It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls.
KYLE
Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!
CARTMAN
Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle. [starts unzipping a duffle bag] I've waited a long time for this, and I intend to savor each and every second. [pulls out a purple robe]
KYLE
No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it! [pounds the table with his left fist]
CARTMAN
[puts on the robe] Not... just yet, Kyle. There's still a few things I need to do. [pulls out a crown and turns to face Kyle] By the way, I should tell you that I haven't had a chance to shower while making my way up here. My balls are... [puts on the crown] extra vinegary...
KYLE
Just get to it already!
[The portal at the Pentagon. The soldiers move slowly towards the portal. General Deckter walks up to the lead tech]
LEAD TECH
Entering the portal in five seconds.
GENERAL DECKTER
Kurt Russell, can I get a comm check?
KURT RUSSELL
Check 1, 2.
GENERAL DECKTER
Good luck men! Godspeed! [the soldiers walk up the ramp and through the portal] What do we have?! Kurt Russell, can you hear me?
KURT RUSSELL
[voice only] We're here. We're s-somewhere.
TECH 3
They are inside the imagination, sir.
GENERAL DECKTER
What do you see in there?
KURT RUSSELL
There's lots of... big mushrooms, colorful grass, some castles in the distance, eh... Wait. Something's coming for us! It's coming out of the bushes and- [everyone braces for the worst] It's a-! ...Oh, Aw, it's just a cute little squirrel. [Everyone relaxes. Stan draws a sigh of relief] Hey, it talks, haha. The little squirrel talks.
LEAD TECH
Awww, an imaginary talking squirrel.
TECHS
Awww.
GENERAL DECKTER
Ask the squirrel what it knows about the terrorist attack.
KURT RUSSELL
Wait a minute, eh. The squirrel has friends. Oh why, why it's a whole bunch of woodland critters.
STAN
Wait, woodland critters... [begins searching his memory]
KURT RUSSELL
There's a talking bear and a beaver, uh... the, they seem to be Christmas critters. Well hello. Yes, hi.
STAN
Get them out of there!
GENERAL DECKTER
What?
STAN
Tell them to get away now!
GENERAL DECKTER
What's the matter?
KURT RUSSELL
Oh the... cute little bear's eyes are starting to glow red now... Uh hello there, little animals, do you happen to know how to huh? OW! AAAAAAAHHHH!
GENERAL DECKTER
Kurt Russell, what's going on?!
KURT RUSSELL
They're raping mee!! They're raping meee!!!
GENERAL DECKTER
Get out of there, Kurt Russell!
KURT RUSSELL
They're raping all of us! Whoaho! Oh it hurts! They're raping us and it huuurts! Waaagh!
[The conference room. Cartman fine-tunes the camera position.]
CARTMAN
I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?
KYLE
Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!
CARTMAN
No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus. [sets the depth] There we go. [smiles, then returns to his seat] Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?
KYLE
Let's just do it!! [pounds the table with both fists]
CARTMAN
In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually- [a red alert interrupts him]
GUARD
Everyone to the main hall now! Go!
CARTMAN
Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet.
GUARD
Everyone to the main hall now!! [Kyle heads for the door and out behind the security guard]
CARTMAN
No! Goddammit, no!
[The Gumdrop Forest. Butters, the Lollipop King, and Snarf continue down the Rainbow Road.]
SNARF
Boy snarf snarf, my feet are really gettin' tired snarf.
BUTTERS
Aww, Sn-Snarf, could you maybe like sh-shut up for five minutes?
LOLLIPOP KING
Wait! There it is. We made it! [a rather impressive complex looms before them] Castle Sunshine! [they rejoice at the sight, but a hissing sound follows] Hurry! Get inside! [they run towards the castle]
PERSEUS
The evil imaginary characters are approaching! Lock down the gates! Prepare to fire the cannons! [more survivors walk in]
BUTTERS
Wait! Waaait! [the trio reach the castle gate and Perseus stops them with his sword]
PERSEUS
What imaginary character are you?!
LOLLIPOP KING
The Lollipop King? From the Lollipop Forest?
SNARF
And I'm Snarf. Snarf, snarf snarf snarf.
PERSEUS
[to Butters] And what imaginary character are you?
BUTTERS
Oh, uhh, uh I'm not imaginary. Ah I'm Butters.
PERSEUS
What's a "Butters"?
SNARF
The Mayor brought him and some other kids into Imaginationland just before the terrorist attack.
PERSEUS
So YOU came from the real world at precisely the same time as the terrorists! That seems like quite a coincidence!
BUTTERS
I, well I was just playin' with my friends, and then, wu-we caught a leprechaun, and then this guy-
PERSEUS
You caught the Leprechaun? Take him!
SNARF
Perseus! He's not against us snarf snarf!
[The portal at the Pentagon. The portal has begun to act violently. Lightning shoots out from the portal and it changes color frequently. Everyone backs away.]
GENERAL DECKTER
Talk to me! What's going on?! [the guard comes in with Kyle and Cartman]
LEAD TECH
Something is... coming through the gate from the other side. [a few moments later, ManBearPig walks through]
OPERATOR
What is it?!
TECH 4
Its like a... half man half bear!
LEAD TECH
And half pig! [ManBearPig grabs a tech and slams him against the portal's supporting wall]
TECH 5
Oh! No, no wait! It's like a half bear half manpig! [ManBearPig rips the tech's head off and tosses it towards General Deckter. Everyone scatters]
GENERAL DECKTER
Look out! [ManBearPig jumps over and grabs the tech at both ends]
LEAD TECH
No! I think it's more like a half man, and half pigbear! [ManBearPig rips him in two at the waist]
GENERAL DECKTER
Reverse the doorway! Send it back through!
KYLE
AAAHHH! [runs away, but ManBearPig scoops him up]
STAN
KYLE!! [a fading tech pushes the red button at his station as he drops to the floor. Lightning flashes into the room as a tractor beam pulls Stan into the portal. ManBearPig resists the pull, but crushes Kyle in its left hand for several seconds]
KYLE
AAAAAAAAAAAA- [ManBearPig lets go of Kyle as the tractor beam fiinally pulls it in. Kyle lays on the floor, blue in the face. Kyle has died...]
[Castle Sunshine, inside. Perseus leads Butters, Snarf, and the Lollipop King down the main hall as two Tron soldiers escort them.]
BUTTERS
Please! I didn't help the terrorists get into Imaginationland! Honest!
PERSEUS
That is for the Council of Nine to decide!
LOLLIPOP KING
Don't worry, kid, the Council of Nine consists of some of the most highly-regarded imaginary characters in all Imaginationland
[The meeting room. At a triangular table sit nine imaginary characters. On the left side of the table are Gandalf the Grey, Glinda the Good Witch, and Morpheus. On the right side are Zeus, Luke Skywalker, and Popeye the Sailor. Sitting on the third side with their backs to us are Jesus and Wonder Woman. At the opposing vertex sits Aslan the Lion]
ASLAN
Fellow Council, these are indeed dark times. The evil forces amass at our gates as we speak. Zeus believes we should evacuate.
ZEUS
Yes. Their power outmatches ours. If they are giving us a chance to leave we must take it!
ASLAN
And what say you, Morpheus?
MORPHEUS
How our we to know that they will let us go? Their offer could be a trap.
GLINDA
Perhaps we must flee to the Temple of Alderon. Surely they wouldn't chase us there.
JESUS
[rises] No, we can't. Come on, you guys, this is our home. We have to fight, to keep it the way it was meant to be.
LUKE SKYWALKER
I'm with Jesus. The evil characters aren't going to just let us go.
POPEYE
[Says something, but it's unintelligible]
JESUS
That may be, Popeye, but we don't have a choice! [the doors open and the Council looks to see who's entering]
PERSEUS
Forgive my intrusion, Council of Nine, but this boy has infiltrated from the real world.
ASLAN
Bring him here!
[The portal at the Pentagon. Paramedics have arrived to check on Kyle. One of them tries to resuscitate him with a defibrillator.]
PARAMEDIC
Clear! [sends power through the paddles. Kyle rises, then falls softly. No sign of life yet. The paramedic removes the paddles and announces] I'm sorry. He's gone.
CARTMAN
No! Kyle can't die. [gets on his knees and checks various parts of his body for a pulse]
PARAMEDIC
I'm sorry, young man.
CARTMAN
Kyle?
PARAMEDIC
Well... at least now he doesn't have to suck anyone's balls.
CARTMAN
[enraged] NNNOOO! [begins giving Kyle CPR] No, he has a strong heart! He wants to live! Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy!
GENERAL DECKTER
He's gone, little boy.
CARTMAN
[to the paramedic] Zap him again! [opens Kyle's coat and shirt for better contact] Do it!
PARAMEDIC
Charging.
CARTMAN
DO IT! [the paramedic places the paddles back on Kyle's body] Come on buddy.
PARAMEDIC
Clear.
CARTMAN
Come on buddy. [the paramedic fires away. Kyle rises, then falls softly. No sign of life yet.] Get out of here! [goes back to giving Kyle CPR. A woman covers her eyes in despair] Godammit Kyle, you never walked away from anything in your life! Now fight! [smacks Kyle around] Fight! Fight! Right now! [begins to break down] Fu-hight! Fu-hu-hight! [pounds Kyle's chest hard] Fight! [Kyle coughs, then comes to. Cartman begins to weep happily.] Give him some air. [an oxygen mask appears and Cartman places it over Kyle's nose and mouth.] There, easy. Breathe easy. [weeps softly some more]
[The meeting room at Castle Sunshine. Butters now stands on a platform in the middle of the table]
ASLAN
I believe this child was brought into Imaginationland for a reason. Perhaps the Mayor knew something we don't.
ZEUS
What are you saying, Aslan? That if we are to take back control, we might-?
MORPHEUS
Yes. If we are to take back control from the evil forces, this little boy might be the key.
BUTTERS
Awww, I'm the key? Could I not be the key, Morpheus? I don't wanna be the key.
LUKE SKYWALKER
If you ever wanna see your home again, little boy, you'll have to rise to this challenge.
BUTTERS
But I, but I'm supposed to be at school right now, uh, and instead I got, I got Snarf and Popeye and Luke Skywalker all pissed off...
ASLAN
It is a dark time for all of us, young boy. But know that if you believe in yourself, everything will turn out all right.
[The portal at the Pentagon. A large missile is being wheeled into place.]
TOM
Sir? Are you sure about this?
GENERAL DECKTER
We have no choice. Terrorists have attacked us where we are most vulnerable. There's no other option. [the missile is in place] We have to nuke our imagination. [the missile is lifted and tilted]
[A hospital room. Kyle is resting. A few gifts lie near him. Cartman rises from under the bed with his crown and robe on and contract in hand]
CARTMAN
Wake up, Kyle. [Kyle wakes up to a smiling Cartman]
End of Imaginationland, Episode II

synopsis:Inside Imaginationland, Stan and Butters engage in the battle of their lives as they fight the army of evil imaginary forces. Meanwhile, Cartman goes all the way to the Supreme Court to get Kyle to pay up on their bet.

script:Imaginationland, Episode III

[Imaginationland. Recaps from the other two episodes follow. First scene: Arrival at Imaginationland]
ASLAN
[voice only] Imaginationland... used to be a happy place. But then the terrorists attacked. [a shot of a terrorist blowing himself up, killing many imaginary creatures] And so many of us were killed. [a shot of Santa on fire, then a shot of the Barrier falling apart] The Barrier came down, and all the most evil imaginary characters were unleashed. [the evil characters pour through the Barrier. Next shot is Strawberry Shortcake being kicked by the Headless Horseman, then by Frankenstein's Monster. Aslan now appears] Now our final battle will take place. The evil characters are marching toward us with the intent to wipe us all out. [various shots of evil characters on the march]
BEAVERY BEAVER
This is gonna be fun, huh? [the other Woodland Critters whoop and holler]
ASLAN
We prepare for a battle we cannot win. [a shot of Popeye honing swords, then a shot of Luke Skywalker handing swards to imaginary creatures. Totoro gets one, then ROM the Space Knight] Sweet and cuddly imaginary characters, many who have never held a weapon, [Donatello puts a helmet on Snarf's head. Wonder Woman hands a sword to a doll character] must now fight for their very lives. We are too few in number, [Mario takes a full-sized sword and walks away with it without a problem. Superman walks off with a battle axe. A smurf tries to take a sword, but has trouble moving it once it's on the floor. Another character takes a spear] but we have one hope. That is where you come in, young boy. [walks over to Butters as other members of the Council look on] Only you can help us win this battle.
BUTTERS
Wuh, what can I do?
ASLAN
You have a power here that you have yet to understand.
[EPISODE III]
[Static appears on screen, then clears up to a security camera clip of ManBearPig attacking Pentagon officials after entering the real world through the portal. After ManBearPig rips the lead tech in two, the tape is halted]
AL GORE
[voice only] Back it up! [the footage is rewound to the part where ManBearPig attacks the tech in blue dress shirt, then stopped.] Look! [points to ManBearPig] Right there! [the tape plays normally] See that?! [the tape stops again where the lead tech is ripped in two] What does that look like to you?! It's ManBearPig! [now onscreen wearing his Nobel Prize medallion] I told you it was real! [three officials watch him from a table in his office] Look again! [fast forwards, then stops when ManBearPig picks up Kyle] There! half man, half bear, and half pig! Do you see it?!
OFFICIAL 1
Yes, we see it, Mr. Gore.
AL GORE
Something big is going on, and the American people need to know what! I'm off! [makes like he's flying away like Superman]
[Washington D.C. Memorial Hospital, day. Kyle is resting in a room, and his doctor is in the hallway talking to another doctor.]
DOCTOR
He's recovering, but there's been some trauma to his brain. The boy says he's been hearing imaginary voices.
[Kyle's room. A closeup of him in bed]
STAN
[in Kyle's head] Hello? [Kyle's eyes open and blink] Hello? Anybody? [Kyle's eyes dart around]
KYLE
Stan? [sits up and looks around]
STAN
Hello?
KYLE
Stan?
CARTMAN
[comes in smiling with a covered platter on a food cart] Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling?
KYLE
Cartman, what's happened?
CARTMAN
What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I could prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe.
KYLE
No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!
CARTMAN
[smiles] You just rest, Kyle. [takes the lid off the platter] Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry- [suddenly pondering] but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle? [taps his chin] What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream, [real softly] let's see
KYLE
Arh!
CARTMAN
Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle? [turns towards the sundae] What else goes on a sundae besides hot fudge,whipped cream, and ...oh, that's right! [faces Kyle with a determined face] My balls!
KYLE
Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!
CARTMAN
Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now. [takes off his cap and begins to pull out yet another costume] So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?
KYLE
Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger?
CARTMAN
[now in papal robes] Don't try to change the subject, Kyle. [puts on the papal tiara and pulls the camera and its tripod into place] You've done a really good job of getting out of this bet, but it's finally time to settle. Get ready for your sundae, Kyle. With extra nuts. [closes his eyes and smiles]
[Castle Sunshine. Aslan stands guard on a bridge overlooking the fields outside the castle.]
JESUS
[arriving with Perseus and the Lollipop King] Aslan, the evil characters are almost here!
ASLAN
Get everyone to the battlefield! Defend the castle walls! Quickly young boy, we need your powers now!
BUTTERS
What powers? Ah I don't understand.
GANDALF
You are real. You are a creator. That means you can imagine things into existence here.
BUTTERS
I c-I can?
ASLAN
Santa Claus was killed in the terrorist attack. The first thing we need is for you to bring him back.
BUTTERS
How?
GLINDA
You just have to focus your mind. Imagine Santa and nothing else.
BUTTERS
How am I supposed to focus with all this crap goin' on?!
LUKE SKYWALKER
Think only of one thing. Imagine it. Believe in it.
GANDALF
Whatever is most prominent in your mind will come to be. [Butters closes his eyes to focus, and soon something appears before him. He opens his eyes and sees his father]
STEVEN
[arms akimbo] Butters! [Butters cowers in fear] You are grounded, mister! You hear me?! [suddenly with a deformed leg, elfin ears, horns, and claws instead of fingers, and a deep voice] GROUNDED!
BUTTERS
[runs around in circles and then shakes his head is disbelief] AAAAAAAAA! No, nonono, no no no! [Steven vanishes]
ASLAN
[in Butters' face] What are you doing?! We need Santa!
BUTTERS
I'm trying!
WONDER WOMAN
[arrives and kneels down next to him] Come on, kid, imagine Santa! Believe in Santa!
ZEUS
You must believe in Santa!
ASLAN
BELIEVE IN SANTA! RIGHT NOW!
BUTTERS
GAA HAA!
[Kyle's hospital room. Cartman has called in some workers to install a photo studio, consisting of a blue background with clouds, and a small platform with a throne on it. On the right arm rest sits the sundae. Two spotlights and light reflectors round out the setup. Cartman tests a remote control for the camera, and it works.]
CARTMAN
Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split
KYLE
Cartman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on.
[Channel 5 Breaking News.]
ANCHORMAN
A new terrorist attack seems to have taken place. This time, in our imagination. [the footage of ManBearPig's killer rampage is shown, with the dialog cut out] Al Gore brought this video to the public's attention, sparking demands by everyone who wants to know exactly what's going on.
[Pentagon Press Conference.]
GENERAL DECKTER
We were hoping to keep this quiet until it was all over, but, two days ago there was a terrorist attack on our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild.
REPORTER 1
Our imaginations are running wild and we weren't told?!
GENERAL DECKTER
By attacking our imagination the terrorists have found our most vulnerable spot. And we've determined that the best course of action is to nuke our imagination.
REPORTER 2
Is nuking our imagination really prudent?
REPORTER 3
Aren't there other, more peaceful ways to get our imagination under control?
REPORTER 4
Couldn't we trying sending Kurt Russell into a portal to our imagination to try and reason with the-
GENERAL DECKTER
We tried that! And Kurt Russell was raped by Christmas Critters!
REPORTER 5
...A-ooch
[Channel 5 Breaking News.]
ANCHORMAN
The Pentagon claims that because imaginary things are not real, the military doesn't need Senate approval to nuke them.
[A protest in Washington D.C..]
HIPPIE 1
That's bullcrap, man! You can't nuke our imagination!
HIPPIE 2
Don't nuke our imagination bro! WOOO!
[Channel 5 Breaking News, commentary.]
ANCHORMAN
Mike, does the military have the authority to nuke our imagination?
MIKE
Uh clearly they don't, Steven, and they're gonna have a big problem because state government has already set a precedent that imaginary characters are real. I cite a famous case of Cartman v. Broflovski in which a U.S. court found for the plaintiff who saw a leprechaun.
ANCHORMAN
Yes, I believe the defendant had to suck the plaintiff's balls in that case.
MIKE
That's right, Steven, yeah.
[Kyle's hospital room. Kyle keeps watching. Cartman continues his preparations]
KYLE
Oh for the love of God!
STAN
Hello? Can anybody hear me?
KYLE
Stan! Dude, is that you?
STAN
Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you.
KYLE
No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination.
STAN
...Oh that makes sense.
KYLE
Dude, what's happening?
STAN
[walking down the rainbow road] I'm in like a gumdrop forest. I just saw Strawberry Shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye. [some moaning horns are heard] Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down.
[The battlefield. The two sides appear, approaching each other. A man in only striped pants and shoes plays a horn]
LOLLIPOP KING
The evil characters are here. [Jesus and Robin Hood join him, Jesus ready to fight with his sword]
JESUS
There are so many of them. HAAAAA! [lifts his sword to strike position as the other good characters crowd in. The two sides start fighting, and Waldo is impaled by both sides]
[Jesus takes on Pinhead and decapitates him. As the battle rages, the six remaining Council members watch along with Butters]
ASLAN
There's no time left! You have to get control of your imagination and bring Santa back NOW!
BUTTERS
Santa. Saaanta.
LUKE SKYWALKER
Think. Jolly old Santa. Red suit, white beard.
BUTTERS
Red suit, white beard... Ssssanta! [Poof! Santa appears, but he's horribly deformed. The toys in his toy sack are deformed as well. Butters screams and turns away]
[Kyle's hospital room. Cartman is now on the throne, and Kevin is behind the camera]
CARTMAN
How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?
ANCHORMAN
[everyone turns to watch the TV] A shocking new development in the nuking of imagination!
[The Supreme Court, outside.]
CHIEF JUSTICE
The Supreme Court has ruled with the military that imaginary things are officially not real, and therefore no approval is needed to nuke them.
GENERAL DECKTER
Thank you.
KYLE
Oh no.
CHIEF JUSTICE
This of course overturns any imagination-based verdicts in the past, including the famous Cartman v. Broflovski ballsucking case.
CARTMAN
...What?
STEVEN
So it appears the military is ready to proceed with its operation, one they are calling "Operation Nuke the Imagination Through the Imagination Doorway."
STAN
Kyle? What's happening?
KYLE
The government is gonna nuke Imaginationland.
STAN
What?! You can't let them do that!
KYLE
What am I supposed to do?
STAN
Dude you have to stall them! [Kyle doesn't look too sure] Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone!
KYLE
Stan? Stan?? [gets out of bed and puts on his clothes]
CARTMAN
Where are you going?!
KYLE
I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked!
CARTMAN
Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.
KYLE
No, I don't! The decision was overturned. [walks out of the room]
CARTMAN
[follows him out and watches him walk away] We had a DEAL KYLE!
KYLE
[walking towards the entrance] Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!
CARTMAN
IT ISN'T OVER!! [Kyle turns to face him] It isn't over, Kyle! I have NOT waited this long to see you weasel your way out of this bet! Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life! Before this day is over! You, will, suck my balls! I SWEAR IT!!
[Castle Sunshine. The battle rages on. Popeye punches Akuma away, then punches Khan away. Darth Maul whips out his double-ended light saber, but Popeye disarms him and punches him away. Morpehus lands a kick on Freddy Krueger.]
MORPHEUS
[calling out to the Council members on the bridge] I need more spinach for Popeye! [Freddy gets up and swipes at him, sending him into the air and onto his back. A Tron soldier dispatches Jason Voorhees with a swing of his spear]
TRON SOLDIER
I-ee got one. I got him. [the Woodland Critters approach]
BEARY BEAR
Hey there. [the soldier turns around and Bear Bear blows his head apart with two laser beam blasts from his eyes. The Woodland Critters cheer him on. ]
ICARUS
[flying in from the battlefield, lands on the bridge] We're losing the battle! There are simply too many of them!
ASLAN
Then the day is lost.
WONDER WOMAN
Wait! Aslan, look! [Aslan looks over. Butters is thinking hard again, and Santa returns, as normal as he ever was. The Council members draw closer to Butters]
SANTA
What? What happened?
LUKE SKYWALKER
You did it, kid!
ASLAN
Quickly Santa! They need you on the battlefield!
SANTA
Huh? [discerns the situation] Oh, all right. [grabs a golden axe and leaps over the wall] Make way for Santa! [lands on the field below, then swings the axe at the Minotaur, who falls down. The axe stays buried in the ribs]
ASLAN
Now you see your potential, young creator. But there is still much more we need from you if we are to win this day!
[The Pentagon, day. Kyle arrives at a parking gate. Two armed guards are there, and three more guards are in the background in front of an entrance.]
GUARD 2
[sees Kyle and aims his gun at him] This area is restricted, little boy.
KYLE
Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke.
GUARD 2
Get behind the line with the other protesters! [Kyle looks, and it's the same group he saw on television moments before]
HIPPIE 3
No nukes in our imagination, bro! Wooo! [the other hippies cheer him on]
KYLE
Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!
GUARD 2
You pot-smokin' hippies aren't gettin' through here, so back off!
HIPPIE 4
Stop that nuke!
HIPPIES
Stop that nuke!
HIPPIES AND KYLE
Stop that nuke! [Al Gore appears out of nowhere, making like he's Superman about to land]
AL GORE
What's going on here? [no one says a word, and he "flies" around a bit more] The military has to do this! It's their only way to kill ManBearPig. ["flies" off]
[Castle Sunshine. The battle continues. A pegasus fights a witch while a flying monkey does battle with the flying giraffe. On the bridge, Butters keeps imagining new characters into existence. A yellow furry archer appears and shoots an arrow right off the bat, then fires a second one]
ASLAN
Good, Butters. Now imagine some more archers on the castle walls!
BUTTERS
Huwhoa! [Perseus appears on the bridge with a bad wound on his left arm]
PERSEUS
Aslan! We're losing the battle!
ROBIN HOOD
[with a bleeding wound on his right arm] We managed to fight off the vampires and werewolves, but... now our troops are being shot down by the Cavity Creeps.
ASLAN
Cavity Creeps?
CAVITY CREEPS
[cutting through the field with their cavity drills] We make holes in teeth! We make holes in teeth!
WONDER WOMAN
What can destroy the Cavity Creeps?
PERSEUS
Only Crest Gel with Tartar Control.
ASLAN
[to Butters] Quickly! You must imagine a giant Crest Gel! [Butters thinks, and poof! There's a giant Crest Gel tube of toothpaste with arms and legs. Robin Hood and Perseus escort it to the battlefield]
ROBIN HOOD
Yes!
GANDALF
His powers are getting stronger. We might just have a chance here.
ARCHANGEL
Aslan, we've captured a spy! He was sneaking around the Gumdrop Forest! [down from above comes the archangel with Stan]
BUTTERS
Stan! [points him out to Aslan and walks to him] Hey look, I imagined Stan here!
STAN
No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.
ASLAN
Project Imagination Doorway? [no one else has a clue either]
GANDALF
Never mind! The battle is almost won! We can deal with him later.
STAN
[stands next to Butters] No, no, you don't understand. There's a nuke. The government is about to level this entire place.
LUKE SKYWALKER
What?
BUTTERS
Wull why would they nuke Imaginationland?
STAN
So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again.
ASLAN
We can get Imaginationland under control; the Chosen One just needs more time!
STAN
The Chosen One?
BUTTERS
Yeah, it turns out I'm the Key.
[The portal at the Pentagon. The nuclear warhead is ready to be shot in.]
COMPUTER
[a female voice] Missile launch sequence initiated.
GENERAL DECKTER
All right, people, I want this nuking done by the books.
TECH 1
Sir, we have a security breach!
GENERAL DECKTER
What?!
TECH 3
There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!
GENERAL DECKTER
Sector 2? [The large window opposite the portal had been patched up, but cracks remain. Cartman crashes through the large window again, reversing the patches, and again lands on his back.]
CARTMAN
[gets up] What the hell do you think you're doing declaring leprechauns aren't real?!
GENERAL DECKTER
What?
CARTMAN
You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real?
LAB TECH
Imaginary things are things made up by people, like Santa and Rudolph.
TOM
Yeah, and they detract from real things, like Jesus.
TECH 1
Maybe Jesus is imaginary too.
TOM
Ooooh, you'd better not say that! You'll go to hell!
TECH 7
It's possible that hell is also imaginary.
TECH 2
Uh so then, we're about to nuke hell... that's a good thing, right?
PERSONNEL
[not all at once] Hell yeah, that's a good thing, yeah.
LAB TECH
What if heaven is imaginary? We'd be nuking heaven.
TECH 3
Yeah, but it wouldn't be real.
LAB TECH 2
So it'd be all right.
CARTMAN
Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?
TOM
Santa Claus and leprechauns are imaginary, but Jesus and hell are real!
TECH 3
Well then, what about Buddha?
TOM
Well of course he's imaginary!
LAB TECH 3
Awww, see? Now you're being intolerant, Tom.
TECH 7
Am I real?
GENERAL DECKTER
All right, enough! Keep that kid out of the way and let's get back to the nuking at hand!
CARTMAN
[two guards haul him away] No! Leprechauns are real, Goddammit!
[The Mall, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, day. Kyle sits on some steps moping.]
STAN
[in Kyle's imagination] Kyle? Kyle, what happened?
KYLE
Nothing.
STAN
What??
KYLE
[stands up and moves around] Nothing happened! There's nothing I can do! [a man walking by looks at him for a few seconds]
STAN
Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke!
KYLE
They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!
STAN
Well you have to convince them they are real!
KYLE
No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls
STAN
Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?! [Kyle sighs] Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you.
KYLE
Huh? [POV changes. The White House is seen in the distance]
JESUS
Hello, Kyle? This is Jesus.
KYLE
Oh boy...
JESUS
What seems to be the problem, my child?
KYLE
Jesus, I can't do anything. [a man walking down the steps stops to look, then continues walking.] I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government. [Jesus falls silent] Uh, hello? Jesus?
LUKE SKYWALKER
No eh, hey Kyle, this is Luke Skywalker.
KYLE
[dejected] Aah.
LUKE SKYWALKER
Look, I know this seems like an impossible task, but do you remember when I brought down the Death Star. I m, I mean, that seemed impossible too, right?
KYLE
Yeah, I guess.
LUKE SKYWALKER
Uh okay, now, now hold on, because Superman is here and he wants to say something. [Kyle rolls his eyes around]
SUPERMAN
Kyle, this is Superman.
KYLE
Hi Superman.
SUPERMAN
I know that saving people can be a big responsibility, but no matter what it takes, it's worth it.
KYLE
[subdued] I know.
SUPERMAN
You can do this, Kyle. How hang on, because Hercules wants to talk to you.
KYLE
Oh God...
SUPERMAN
Yes, God is here too. He's gonna talk to you right after Captain Crunch.
[Castle Sunshine. The battle rages on. Jesus fights a Xenomorph, but to no effect]
JESUS
Popeye, I need some help here! [a donkey wearing a sombrero walks by shooting at the Pac-Man monsters]
LOLLIPOP KING
[being choked by an Imperial Stormtrooper] Popeye is being killed by Christmas Critters. [sure enough, the Critters hump on Popeye as Foxy Fox pisses on his face]
POPEYE
Gaw guguh, getskug off of me!
BEARY BEAR
[sees something and leaves the other Critters] Hey, what is that?
[the battle ceases as Butters floats through inside a bubble, then resumes after he's gone]
BUTTERS
More spinach for Popeye! [ten cans of spinach appear before Popeye in a pyramid] Imagine an M60 for Jesus!
JESUS
[his sword turns into an M60 and the Xenomorph cowers] All right!
ASLAN
[on the bridge] The boy is doing it! Everything is going to be okay!
[The portal at the Pentagon. Just a little longer...]
COMPUTER
Missile launch in one minute.
CARTMAN
Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!
GENERAL DECKTER
Prepare for launch...
TECH 1
Sir, we have a security breach!
GENERAL DECKTER
What?!
TECH 3
There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!
GENERAL DECKTER
Sector 2? [Kyle crashes through the part of the large window that was left intact and lands on his back. Cartman turns around]
CARTMAN
Kyle?
GENERAL DECKTER
The hell are you doing back here?!
KYLE
Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore.
GENERAL DECKTER
Why is it so easy for children to break into the Pentagon?!
KYLE
You have to stop!
GENERAL DECKTER
If I'm not mistaken, you're the one who bet that leprechauns weren't real. So why do you care what happens?
KYLE
Because I- [catches himself] I... Um... because I think... they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of "real." They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us. [Cartman begins a slow clap, then speeds it up. The techs in the room join in and soon everyone is applauding Kyle's speech]
GENERAL DECKTER
Abort the sequence. [a tech flips the switch and the power to the missile is cut. The missile lowers to a resting state]
CARTMAN
So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle. [gloats]
KYLE
Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls, [forces Cartman to face him] you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am [jab] never going to suck your balls, [jab] never!! So [jab] there!!!
AL GORE
[walking through the sliding doors] What happened?! Why hasn't the missile gone off?!
GENERAL DECKTER
There's been an abort, Mr. Gore.
AL GORE
[moves towards the switch] No! ManBearPig has to die! [presses buttons randomly]
TECH 3
Oh Jesus no! [the portal activates and begins sucking everyone and everything into Imaginationland, including Cartman and Kyle... and the missile]
[Imaginationland, the battlefield outside Castle Sunshine.]
LOLLIPOP KING
That's it, Aslan! The evil characters have fled!
ASLAN
The day is ours! [screams are heard and bodies fall from the sky. Aslan and the others look up. Many of them land on the battlefield. Kyle lands on the bridge, face down]
STAN
[approaches] Kyle!
BUTTERS
[approaches Cartman on the battlefield] Fellas! Where'd you come from? [a whistling sound is heard and everyone looks up]
ZEUS
What is that? [the missile comes down from the sky and blows up on the battlefield, killing everyone. The screen fills up with white ash. Moments later, Butters digs himself out of the ash and dusts himself off. He looks around and walks off to his left.]
BUTTERS
Huh... [with nothing but white around, he concentrates real hard and soon Imaginationland returns. The Barrier repairs itself, and all the imaginary characters reappear]
JESUS
He did it!
FANCIFUL MAYOR
[poof] Oh look, I'm back!
LUKE SKYWALKER
Nice going, kid. [the other good imaginary characters congratulate him]
FANCIFUL MAYOR
The evil characters! They're all behind the wall again.
STAN
Dude! How did you do that, Butters?
BUTTERS
Well I just... used my imagination.
ALL
Awwww [everyone has a good laugh]
CARTMAN
You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality. [he begins to think hard, and an imaginary version of himself appears, wearing the crown and robe from before.] Why look, it's me. And... [thinks again, and an imaginary Kyle appears] And there's Kyle. And, what's Kyle about to do? [the imaginary Kyle drops out of view]
KYLE
Cartman, don't!
CARTMAN
O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls! [the imaginary Cartman is a little shocked]
STAN
Dude.
LOLLIPOP KING
Oh my God.
CARTMAN
O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?
KYLE
I'm not sucking your balls; that's imaginary!
CARTMAN
No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real.
GENERAL DECKTER
That's true. You did.
CARTMAN
Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls. [everyone but Kyle laughs]
SANTA
Okay, Kyle, that's enough ballsucking. We need to get you boys home.
KYLE
I am not sucking Cartman's balls!
FANCIFUL MAYOR
Whatever you imagine to be real, is real. [everyone cheers that remark]
[Butters' room, morning. He's asleep.]
STEVEN
Butters? [Butters opens his eyes] Butters!
BUTTERS
[sits up] A-huh? What? Oh! It was all just a dream.
STEVEN
Come on, Butters, time to get up. [walks in with newspaper in hand]
BUTTERS
Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!
STEVEN
You WERE in Imaginationland, Butters! We've read all about it in the paper! The question is, what were you doing in Imaginationland when you were supposed to be helping your mother clean up the basement?!
LINDA
You are grounded, mister!
BUTTERS
[dejected] Ohhh. [becomes determined] Wait, I'm not grounded.
STEVEN
Oh yes you are!
BUTTERS
Oh yeah? [focuses real hard, then opens his eyes]
STEVEN
That only works in Imaginationland! You're grounded! [backs out of the room. He and Linda leave, closing the door behind them]
BUTTERS
[thinks a bit, then lies down again] Ahhh, shit.
End of Imaginationland, Episode III


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:When Stan and Kyle get hooked on Guitar Hero, Stan's superior skills put their friendship in danger.

script:Guitar Queer-O

[Stan's house, day. In the living room, Stan and Kyle stand before the TV with guitar controllers in their hands. Nine boys from class watch them from the sofa and the floor. A game starts up. Stan and Kyle immediately begin to play and the other boys begin to cheer them on. The song playing is "Wayward Son"]
CARTMAN
Stan, you guys are good! [Stan and Kyle more their right arms around during a power chord, then quickly return to playing. The score is 15,594 points and climbs quickly. Randy watches from the kitchen doorway]
[The kitchen. Sharon is washing dishes. Randy turns and walks towards her.]
RANDY
[sounding tired] Sharon, what are the boys doing?
SHARON
Oh, Stan and Kyle bought a new video game together.
RANDY
They can play guitar now?
SHARON
No, no, they're just little plastic controllers. You hit the colored buttons and it makes the guitar track on the gameplay.
RANDY
Ohhh.
SHARON
If they spent half the time learning a real instrument as they do playing that game, who knows what they could accomplish.
RANDY
Hey yeah...
[The living room. The round ends and the boys cheer.]
STAN
Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us! [a shot of the cheering CG crowd on the TV]
RANDY
[walks up to Stan] So you boys like this music, huh?
KYLE
Yeah, dude. Its Guitar Hero.
BUTTERS
Stan and Kyle are really good at it.
RANDY
Well, you kids wanna see something really cool? [the boys pay attention] Check this out. [walks away and picks up an electric guitar, and plugs in the amplifier. He puts his right foot on top of the amplifier and begins to play "Wayward Son" a half-step up.]
Once, I rose above the noise and confusion,
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higherr,
But I flew too highh
Though my eyes, could see, I-
STAN
[irritated, interrupting] Dad? Dad! What are you doing?!
RANDY
[brightly] I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how?
CARTMAN
Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh.
STAN
Yeah, that's stupid, Dad.
RANDY
But... But this is real.
CARTMAN
Real guitars are for old people.
CRAIG
Do you mind, sir? We wanna watch Stan and Kyle play. [Randy stands there a few seconds, disappointed that the boys aren't interested. He takes off the guitar, leans it against the amplifier, and walks away.]
STAN
[turns back to the TV] Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time. [the game starts up with a new song, and the boys behind them begin to cheer again]
[Stan's house, night. Once everyone's asleep, Randy sneaks downstairs towards the couch. He looks around to make sure no one else is awake and waiting for him. He reaches the couch and picks up a controller, playing it a bit to start the game.]
M.C.
Are you ready to rock? ["Wayward Son" begins to play from the top, and Randy begins to move, slowly raising his right hand into a victory sign, then swinging his arm all the way around a few times]
KANSAS
Carry on my wayward, son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
[the first guitar solo follows and Randy is playing terribly. The video crowd begins to boo him.]
M.C.
Game over! You suck! [the words are displayed onscreen. Randy takes off the controller, sets it on the ground, and walks back to bed, leaving the TV on with the video crowd still booing him.]
[Stan's house, next day. The boys are back at Stan's house watching another round of Guitar Hero. "Wayward Son" gives way to another song.]
BUTTERS
They're gonna do it!
CARTMAN
[so relaxed his fat blocks his chin from view] Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points!
KYLE
Cartman, shut up. We're concentrating. [the points pile up and they near 100,000. After a final flourish, their readouts combine into one, showing 100,000 points. The boys congratulate Stan and Kyle]
M.C
You have broken a hundred thousand points! You. Are. Rock stars!
STAN
Dude, we are total rock stars now!
RANDY
[walks in with beer and slurred speech] You're not rock stars! This is just a stupid plastic controller! [the doorbell rings]
STAN
[takes off his controller and goes to answer the door] Hang on.
MAN
Stan Marsh?
STAN
Yeah?
MAN
I'm Charles Kincade, from the Kincade Talent Agency? I just heard you broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.
STAN
Yeah, we did. [smiles]
MR. KINCADE
Well, I'm impressed. [steps inside and gives him a business card] And I'd like to be your manager.
STAN
Wow, really?? [smiles an open smile] Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager!
RANDY
No way!
KYLE
For reals? [smiles]
MR. KINCADE
Scoring a hundred thousand points is amazing, but I think with the right label behind you, you guys could make a million points.
STAN
That'd be awesome!
MR. KINCADE
So, we're in business then? [Stan and Kyle look at each other, then grin as "Wayward Son" plays]
[A producer's office, day. Mr. Kincade is snapping his fingers to "Wayward Son" as a producer listens. Stan and Kyle watch him, then Stan looks at Kyle. Kyle grimaces.]
MR. KINCADE
Well, what do you think?
PRODUCER
I like it. That's these boys playing?
MR. KINCADE
[stops the tape] No, that's Kansas. But these boys scored a hundred thousand points to it on Expert Level in Co-op Mode.
PRODUCER
That's pretty Goddamned impressive. [rises and serves himself a drink] Alright, we'll sign them to a one-year deal. [Stan and Kyle smile to this news as Mr. Kincade stands behind them]
MR. KINCADE
[pumps his fist] Yes! You did it, boys.
PRODUCER
Listen, boys, I'm having a huge celebrity party at my giant mansion tonight. Why don't you come by as my honorary new artists?
STAN, KYLE
Cool! [smile openly]
[The producer's mansion, night. Limos pull into the circular driveway in front of the mansion, drop off guests, and pull away. Inside is a large crowd of local celebrities. In the pool, two topless women splash each other with water and giggle. One blond celebrity is snorting a mountain of coke]
STAN
Wow, this is a huge party.
PRODUCER
Oh yes, all the biggest stars in Colorado are here.
STAN
Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News! [Ron Zappolo is shown - an elderly gent with gray hair and mustache]
KYLE
Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials. [Jabs is shown with a white tiger on his lap and two women around him]
PRODUCER
Everyone? Everyone, this is Stan and Kyle. They just broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero. [ooo's and applause follow. Stan and Kyle grin] Please enjoy yourselves, there's lots more coke and sex in the house.
STAN
Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there! [a football player wearing #6 is shown] Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!
KYLE
Oh my God!
PRODUCER
Would you boys like to meet him?
STAN
Are you serious??
PRODUCER
Jay, I want you to meet Stan and Kyle. They broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.
JAY
Wow, really? Nice to meet you guys.
STAN
Nice to meet you! [grins] I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday.
JAY
[a bit bothered] Thanks...
GUEST
Alex, have you seen my wife anywhere?
PRODUCER
You boys know Tom Shane from the Shane Company Diamond Store commercials?
KYLE
Do we? He's a legend!
PRODUCER
You remember these boys, Tom. They're gonna break a million points live at the video arcade in a few weeks.
TOM SHANE
That, would be impressive.
KYLE
[takes Stan aside] Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool.
STAN
Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.
[Stan's house, day. Mr. Kincade rocks out on the couch watching Stan and Kyle play Guitar Hero. The boys hit 152,626 points]
M.C.
You Rock!
MR. KINCADE
[clapping] All right, nice rehearsal, boys.
KYLE
D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that?
STAN
Yeah dude, that's almost impossible.
MR. KINCADE
That was real cool, kids. Hey, Kyle, there's a different controller in my car that might work better for you. Why don't you go with Jim and he'll help you find it. [an assistant dressed in a jogging outfit joins him behind Kyle]
KYLE
Oh, okay. Cool. [takes off his controller and follows Jim out]
MR. KINCADE
[sighs] You've got real potential, kid. I have no doubt you can break a million.
STAN
Really? That'd be sweet.
MR. KINCADE
[turns around and points to Stan] I think you could. But uh, as for your friend, well, to be honest, I think he's holding you back.
STAN
What, you mean, Kyle?
MR. KINCADE
Look, you score a lot higher than him; there's no question who the better one is. I wanna put you with some other players, find a partner for you who can really help you max your score.
STAN
But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system.
MR. KINCADE
[crosses his arms] Very honorable. But you know where loyalty gets you in a game like Guitar Hero? Nowhere. Just listen to that video crowd. [a shot of the video crowd cheering] I haven't heard a video crowd go that wild in a long time. You've got a chance to score a million points, and I hate to see you throw it away because you're worried about your friend's feelings.
[Café Monet, day. Mr. Kincade and Stan are outside at a table sipping coffee.]
MR. KINCADE
You're gonna love this kid, Stan. He's one of the best Guitar Hero players I've ever seen. Except for you, of course. [sees someone] Ah, Thad! [a boy about Stan's age approaches the table and takes a seat. He wears a controller on his back] Stan Marsh, this is Thad Jarvis.
THAD
Sup? [an air of superiority is suggested by his tilting his head back]
MR. KINCADE
That here has backed up a lot of really great Guitar Hero players. Isn't that right, Thad? [puffs on a cigar]
THAD
Yup.
MR. KINCADE
He doesn't even need a game system to play on. He can play Guitar Hero acoustically.
STAN
Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?
MR. KINCADE
Go ahead, Thad. Show him what you can do. [Thad stands on his chair, swings his controller around, and puts his right foot on the table.] Check this out. [All that is heard are the clicks of plastic on plastic] Pretty damn good, huh?
STAN
Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play "John the Fisherman"? [Thad stops and launches into that song]
MR. KINCADE
Stan, with this kid backing you, you're gonna make Guitar Hero history.
MALE DINER
Ohoh, I love this song. [the other diners seem to understand the song the clicks are supposed to be making and begin to clap]
[Stan's house, later. Guitar Hero starts up and the boys are gathered near the couch watching Stan and... Thad. A song comes on and Stan and Thad begin to play. The boys cheer them on as the score nears 500,000]
BUTTERS
Wow wee, look at him go!
KYLE
[enters the house] Hey dude, how's it-? [he has his new controller, but he's dismayed at what he sees. The boys look at him and the game is shut off]
STAN
...Kyle. ...I, I thought you were sick.
BUTTERS
[into his hands, in a low hoarse voice.] Uh ohhh...
KYLE
[walks up to Stan] Who is this?
STAN
This is um, Thad Jarvis.
THAD
Sup?
KYLE
Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan?
STAN
Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincade thinks I should play with Thad for a while.
KYLE
But it's our game. We bought it together.
STAN
I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part.
KYLE
Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!
STAN
Don't put this all on me, Kyle!
CARTMAN
Oh my God this is so awesome.
STAN
You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-
KYLE
I have been sick!
STAN
Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!
KYLE
[stunned for a few seconds] I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points. [drops his controller next to Stan and walks out of the house, closing the door behind him]
CRAIG
Dude, this game rules.
STAN
Let's just do this, all right? [a new round begins and Stan and Thad resume playing]
[EV Games. Guitar Hero advertising is plastered all over the windows. Stan enters the store. He walks over to the magazine rack and begins browsing]
BRETT
Hey! You're the kid I sold the Guitar Hero game to. How are you likin' it?
STAN
It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.
BRETT
Yeah, Guitar Hero can be pretty stressful. But you know, maybe instead of a game guide, you should just buy another game to kind of ...ease the stress.
STAN
[approaches the counter with a Guitar Hero game guide] Huh?
BRETT
Have you ever heard of... [pulls out a different game from under the counter] Heroin Hero?
STAN
Hero-Heroin Hero?
BRETT
It's a way easier game. All you do is run around a magical forest and shoot simulated heroin. You could call it the ultimate first-person shooter.
STAN
And there's no score? No crowds?
BRETT
[his voice gets soft and mellow as he speaks] No man. All you do is run through the pretty forest and chase a big dragon. But you don't ever catch the dragon. You just... keep chasing it.
[Stan's house, day. He's playing Heroin Hero, which just consists of his character shooting heroin into his right arm. Each shot moves him forward a few steps, but he's no closer to the dragon.]
THE DRAGON
Chase me. Come on. This way. Shoot up and then you can catch me. Come on.
STAN
[playing quietly] Dude, this is awesome.
[Gamecraft Arcade, day. Stan and Thad are at the arcade version of Guitar Hero; Stan is showing frustration. The song they're playing to is "I Wanna Be Sedated". Mr. Kincade watches them as the producer approaches]
PRODUCER
How are they coming?
MR. KINCADE
No worries, Mr. Hart. They'll be ready for the big show in a few days
MR. HART
They'd better be. I paid good money to rent this place out. [walks away. On the game screen, Stan's character is missing his notes and flailing about]
STAN
Ugh. Damnit.
THAD
Dude, sup. Did you practice last night?
STAN
[frustrated] Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play! [misses some more notes] No no, you know what?! Screw this! [the music stops] I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?!
MR. KINCADE
Stan, it's the song we all agreed you would play.
STAN
Yeah? Well, I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick!
THAD
No way. I hate that bubblegum crap.
STAN
Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music I wanna play!
MR. KINCADE
Stan, why are you so grumpy-grouchy?
STAN
We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!
THAD
Yeah? Well, how about this one? I quit. [drops his controller] I quit, I quit, I quit. [turns around and walks away] I quit, I quit, I quit. I quit, I quit, I quit.
STAN
You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!
MR. KINCADE
Stan, what is the matter with you?
STAN
I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time! [Mr. Kincaid notices that Stan's tote bag is open and looks inside. He pulls out Heroin Hero]
MR. KINCADE
What is this?
STAN
Man...
MR. KINCADE
Are you playing Heroin Hero?
STAN
Just, just a little.
MR. KINCADE
No! [stands up] Nobody plays Heroin Hero "a little"! You know, you never catch the dragon!
STAN
I know, but it mellows me out, okay?!
MR. KINCADE
You'd better pull your act together because now you're gonna have to break a million points and unlock superstardom solo!
STAN
No problem.
[A bowling alley, day. The exterior is a bit run-down, with strips of plastic pulling away from the roof. A sign by the street has "WE HAVE GUITAR HERO" on it, the R falling off. "Every Rose Has Its Thorn" plays. Inside, some people are bowling while others sit at tables being depressed. The camera rests on Kyle playing along on his guitar controller. Two kids walk up to Kyle. The place is called Mick's Lanes]
OLDER BOY
Hey, beat it, kid! We wanna play now!
KYLE
I'm not done yet.
YOUNGER BOY
Hey, I know you. You're Kyle Broflovski. Didn't you used to have your own Guitar Hero game system?
KYLE
No. You're thinking of somebody else.
YOUNGER BOY
Yeah, sure. He's the kid that scored a hundred thousand points!
OLDER BOY
How come you're playing here now?
KYLE
Look, just go ahead and play, alright? [gets off the stool and walks away] Leave me alone. [walks up to the bar and takes a seat] Can I get a Fresca, please?
MICK
You're good at that game, Kid. Too good to be playing in a dump like this.
KYLE
Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters.
MICK
Well look, maybe I can use some extra music playing to this thing on weekend nights. You come in, work around here a little, and... maybe you can play it for free.
KYLE
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet.
MICK
Ehhh, charity case eh, I'm just trying to help out a kid who's a little... down on his luck is all.
KYLE
Thanks, Mick.
[Heroin Hero, onscreen at Stan's house, day.]
THE DRAGON
Catch me. Come on, catch me. [Stan is passed out on the couch with snacks all around him. Some knocks and the doorbell are heard, but Stan doesn't move] What's wrong? Follow me. Come on. [The door opens and Mr. Kincade comes in]
MR. KINCADE
Marsh? Stan, you got- [notices Stan passed out] Oh my God! [runs over to him and shakes him hard] Get up, Stan! Wake up!
STAN
Huh? What, uh?
MR. KINCADE
You're going on in ten minutes! Everybody's coming to see you!
STAN
The dragon. Where did it go?
MR. KINCADE
[slaps Stan twice across the face] You've gotta pull it together! [shakes him hard again, then sees a glass of water nearby and throws the water at him, them shakes him hard again] Pull it together, Goddammit!
[Gamecraft Arcade, night. The boys are there waiting for Stan to start playing. A couple stands behind them waiting as well.]
MR. KINCADE
Thank you for coming to Gamecraft Arcade to watch Stan Marsh break a million points and unlock superstardom. [the boys cheer Stan on.]
TOLKIEN
Go Stan!
CARTMAN
All right, Stan, you've got it, man!
TOLKIEN
Yeah, Stan!
CRAIG
Dude, what's the matter with him?
BUTTERS
He's been up for three days straight playing Heroin Hero. [Stan staggers slowly] Come on, Stan! You got it!
MR. KINCADE
Goddamnit, he's a mess! [Stan is moving around, but he's missing all the notes]
CRAIG
Oh man, I can't watch this.
MR. KINCADE
What are you doing?! The video crowd is starting to boo! [a shot of the video crowd booing]
CARTMAN
Come on guys. Let's get out of here. [the boys leave, as to the couples and other spectators, leaving Stan alone with Mr. Kincade. Mr. Hart approaches Mr. Kincade.]
MR. HART
The next time you bring me some talent, make sure they're talent-ed. [walks away. Stan stumbles and finally falls face first, throwing up]
MR. KINCADE
You blew it! You had it all and you blew it! Listen to that video crowd! They hate you! [walks away. More shots of the video crowd booing. Stan looks at the crowd and begins seeing double]
[EV Games, day. Brett the clerk is reading a magazine. Stan walks in, his head hanging real low, and walks to a game stand]
BRETT
There he is! So, did you break a million yet?
STAN
No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!
BRETT
Aw, come on. Once you start playing Guitar Hero, you can't stop till you reach the top.
STAN
I just wanna find something else to play.
BRETT
Have you played... [whips out a new game] Rehab Hero? You get chased by a big dragon, but you keep running away from it.
STAN
I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that?
BRETT
Sssure kid. Sure. [brings out a Cross Country Cruiser game]
[Stan's house, day. He's now playing Cross Country Cruiser. A radio is next to him, and in it, a song ends.]
RADIO HOST
All right, that was the Splendifs. And now here's a hit you all remember. It's a song that two local fourth-grade boys scored a hundred thousand points to on Guitar Hero. [Stan is startled] Don't know whatever happened to those boys. I guess... they're not playing the game anymore.
["Wayward Son" begins to play and Stan gets immersed in the game. A shot of Stan and Kyle playing Guitar Hero floats by.]
KANSAS
Carry on my wayward, son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Once I rose above the noise and confusion,
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher,
But I flew too high

Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man,
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man,
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming,
I can hear them say...
[Stan then steps on the brake, stopping his video car. He thinks hard about what to do next. After a few seconds, a look of determination shows up and he goes into reverse, looking back over his shoulder as if he were driving a real car.]
[Mick's Bowling Lanes, day. The sign now says: KILE BARFFLOSKI ON GUITAR HERO. Inside, Kyle is at the Guitar Hero setup playing along to another song.]
SKID ROW
Woke up to the sound of pouring rain,
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried, that called my name,
And when you needed me I came through...
[Stan walks in and approaches Kyle. Kyle sees him and turns his back to him]
STAN
Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?
KYLE
What are you doing here? ["I paint a picture of the days gone by,"]
STAN
Please, it- it won't take long.
KYLE
Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five. ["When love went blind and you would make me see." Kyle walks over to the bar and serves himself some Fresca]
STAN
I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better. ["I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes"]
KYLE
Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities! ["So that I knew you were there for me"]
STAN
Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there.
KYLE
Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship! ["Time after time you were there for me"]
STAN
That isn't it at all. ["Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand"]
KYLE
You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore! ["Love letters in the sand - I remember you..."]
STAN
I know. I need you. [Kyle glances over his shoulder, then turns around to face Stan] I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that... [turns around and face Kyle] ...with my best friend.
KYLE
It was pretty fun, wasn't it?
STAN
[awkwardly] Yeah.
KYLE
Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway.
STAN
I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.
KYLE
I don't really see the fun in... [turns around with fire in his eyes] ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!
STAN
What, you mean it?
KYLE
I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.
STAN
[pats Kyle on the shoulder] Then let's go, dude! [walks forward. Kyle follows.]
KYLE
[stops abruptly] Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here. [turns around and face Mick] Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec?
MICK
Go on, get out of here, kid. Who needs your wailin' and rockin' around here anyways?
KYLE
Thanks, Mick! [turns left and walks out. Stan follows him.]
[Stan's house, day. Stan and Kyle walk up to Stan's house. Stan opens the door and they enter the living room]
STAN
All right, dude, let's do this. [Kyle's jaw drops and Stan is annoyed] What the hell? [what greets them is Randy on the couch in his underwear. Around him are a pizza slice, a bucket of chicken, a case of S'mores Schnapps, and other items. Randy is playing Heroin Hero]
RANDY
Ahhh, Ahhhhhhh...
THE DRAGON
Come on, come on. You almost got me. Catch me. Come on.
STAN
Aw, Goddammit! Dad, get off our Xbox!
RANDY
Hang on, I almost caught the dragon.
THE DRAGON
Hehe, you almost caught me.
STAN
No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero!
RANDY
[sits up] I can get him! Wait! Where's he going now?
STAN
You don't ever catch the dragon, Dad! [turns off the console]
RANDY
NOO! NOOO, I SAID! I AM YOUR FATHER! PUT IT BACK ON!
STAN
Mom, will you get Dad out of here?
[The neighborhood park. Cartman, Kenny, Clyde, Craig, and Tolkien are playing basketball. Craig has the ball and shoots at the basket. The shot is good.]
CARTMAN
Stop cheating, Craig! [pushes Craig from behind]
CRAIG
How was that cheating!
CARTMAN
'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole!
BUTTERS
Fellas! Fellas! They're gonna do it!
CARTMAN
What?
BUTTERS
Stan and Kyle! They're about to break a million on Guitar Hero, and unlock superstardom! [Butters runs back. After some thought, the other boys run after him]
THE BOYS
Oh, let's go! Come on, let's go!
[Stan's house, day. Stan and Kyle are playing again. Kevin, Jimmy, and a third boy are already present. The other boys enter and jimmy makes room for them to see the action]
BUTTERS
They're gonna do it! [they finally break the million]
CRAIG
They did it!
JIMMY
Oh my sweet J-Jesus!
M.C.
You have played Guitar Hero enough to reach one million points! Congratulations! You. Are. FAGS. [the video crowd cheers]
STAN
That's it?
KYLE
Goddamnit... Goddamnit. [walks away pissed off. Stan takes off his controller and looks at it, drops it to the floor, and follows after Kyle]
CARTMAN
Butters, you wanna play me next? [picks up Stan's controller and puts it on]
BUTTERS
Heh, okay, but I get to be the one that betrays you after the sex and drug party. [picks up Kyle's controller and puts it on, and both of them get to playing.]
End of Guitar Queer-O


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The girls in the fourth grade class have made a secret list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest. The boys steal the list, but are unprepared to deal with the results.

script:The List

[The school cafeteria. It looks like it's been remodeled. At the table at center sit Kyle, Stan, Craig, Kenny, Cartman, Clyde, and Tolkien.]
BUTTERS
[runs towards the table breathlessly] Fellas! Fellas! It's- Oh my god! You're not gonna believe this!
STAN
Dude, Butters, calm down.
BUTTERS
Okay. [takes a gulp of air and looks around] Okay. I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest.
CRAIG
So who do they say is the cutest?
BUTTERS
I dunno.
TOLKIEN
Who do they say is the ugliest?
BUTTERS
I don't know. I-it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them. [turns around and looks at them. The other boys look as well. Nearby, the girls chat among themselves, notice the boys, then laugh. Bebe holds up a notebook]
CARTMAN
[mad] They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?
STAN
Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account?
CLYDE
If it's just looks then I think I'm safe.
KYLE
You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time.
CARTMAN
[with a double cheeseburger in his left hand] Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about.
CRAIG
You're just saying that because you know you're gonna be very last on the list!
CARTMAN
Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!
CRAIG
You don't think they put the fat tub of lard at the bottom?
CARTMAN
No, because chicks know I'm not fat, I'm buff! They probably put you at the bottom of the list 'cause you have fucked-up teeth! Or Kenny 'cause he's poor.
KENNY
(They didn't put me at the bottom, did they?)
CARTMAN
Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna eat Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married.
BUTTERS
You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.
KYLE
You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?! [the boys look at each other for a few seconds]
[The hallway, after lunch. Bebe's at her locker. Cartman leads a small group of boys to her.]
CARTMAN
All right, Bebe, let's see the list.
BEBE
[turns her head to look at him] What?
CARTMAN
You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!
BEBE
That's not for boys to look at! It's a secret girl list and YOU can't see it!
CARTMAN
Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him?
BEBE
I'm not... [slams her locker door shut] telling! And anyway, I'm not the list keeper, Nelly is! And Nelly will never let you look at it, so there! [sticks her tongue out and blows a raspberry at him, then walks away]
CARTMAN:
[blows a strong raspberry back and flips her off] Fuck you, Bebe! Fuck it, bitch!
BUTTERS
[disappointed] Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.
CARTMAN
Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can out think them.
[Cartman's house, after school. In his basement, he shares his plan with some of the other fourth grade boys.]
CARTMAN
All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right? She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her. [points to a chalkboard with his plan on it] This is what I call "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail". [a map with routes of the plan laid out]
BUTTERS
[happily taking notes] Neat-o!
CARTMAN
At 1 PM tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here. [upper center part of the map] When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls.
BUTTERS
[cheerfully] Okay!
CARTMAN
Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?
[South Park Elementary, day. Nelly walks down the hall as the 1 PM bell rings. As she walks, Craig blows through a paper bullhorn. Nelly looks over her right shoulder and Butters runs up and kicks her in the groin.]
NELLY
Ow! What'dja do that for?! [Butters looks down and kicks her in the groin again] Hey, what's your problem, asshole?! [Butters is stunned that his kicks have no effect on her]
CARTMAN
Bail, bail! [he and Kenny take off]
[Cartman's house, after school. He stands next to his revised plan, "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time".]
CARTMAN
Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls.
BUTTERS
[shown with a black right eye and his right arm in a sling] They sure don't.
CARTMAN
Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time". When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.
BUTTERS
You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?
CARTMAN
Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention! [continues]
[South Park Elementary, day. The school bell rings. Tolkien is walking down the hall when Kenny, Cartman, Craig and Butters run past him. He and the other kids in the hall look on.]
CARTMAN
We got it! We got it! [next shot is of Stan at his locker as Craig runs by]
CRAIG
We got the list from the girls! [the other boys take pursuit: Stan, Tolkien, Jimmy, Clyde, Tweek, Bill, and two others. Two sixth graders and some kindergartners watch from the far end of the hall]
NELLY
[chasing after the boys] Give that back you dirty buttholes! [the boys run into the boys' room]
CARTMAN
Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! [Kyle is washing his hands, but he turns to see what's going on]
CLYDE
All right, hurry! Get it up there! Let's see it!
A BOY
Hurry hurry!
CRAIG
Whoa, what's this thing? Where am I?
CLYDE
What number am I on?
A BOY
Is it set up?
STAN
It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one.
CLYDE
Me? [smiles] I'm the cutest? [grins]
STAN
And then Tolkien, and then me.
TOLKIEN
I'm number two? Wow.
BUTTERS
[making his way to the front] Come on, let me see! Let me see! [looks at the list and begins to scan it for his own name, then finds it] Oh boy! I'm number 11! Whoopie! Number 11! [runs out of the bathroom as a few boys wonder why he's so happy about it]
CRAIG
Ah! Look at that! I'm hotter than you, fatso! [he's #12 while Cartman is #15]
CARTMAN
What?! That's bullcrap! [Kenny moves up past Cartman and looks for his name. He finds himself at #7]
KENNY
(Woohoo!) [moves off]
KYLE
Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Tolkien and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and... [finds himself at #16, the last one on the list. His head drops a little] Me?
CARTMAN
You're last, dude! [laughs heartily]
KYLE
No way.
CARTMAN
Yes way! Check it out! [laughs heartily]
STAN
Cartman, lay off! You're next to last.
CARTMAN
So? I'm hotter than Kyle. [makes his way through the crowd and out of the bathroom] I'm better looking than Kyyyle! [the other boys join him out except for Stan and Kyle] Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle!
KYLE
I'm last? Last?
STAN
Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember?
KYLE
I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?
STAN
Who cares what dumb girls think, right? [realizes there's no consolation now and walks away. Kyle stays there looking at the list. Alone. All alone. All alone in the boys' room]
[Butters' house, day. He makes it home and runs into the kitchen. In the living room are three pairs of snow boots.]
BUTTERS
Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!
STEPHEN
[holding a smoking pipe with his right hand and reading the Denver Post] Well good for you, Butters.
LINDA
Way to go, champ.
BUTTERS
Whoopie! [flies off to his room]
STEPHEN
Well, guess we don't have to ground him.
[Kyle's house, evening. The family's at dinner, but Kyle isn't eating. He's still depressed.]
SHEILA
Kyle, what's the matter? You barely touched your knishes.
KYLE
The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.
SHEILA
What? That's ridiculous. My little bubbeleh is adorable!
KYLE
Look, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I-I didn't think I was the very ugliest.
SHEILA
You're not ugly, Kyle. You're my perfect little man. You look just like your father. [Gerald looks at Kyle and flashes a smile]
KYLE
Oh God! I do?
GERALD
But he has his mother's nose.
KYLE
[slaps both hands on his own nose] Ah!
SHEILA
Kyle, you are very handsome and perfect in every way.
KYLE
Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no? [Ike looks at him, then at their parents, then back at him. Kyle takes this to mean yes, and so leaves his chair] You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me!
SHEILA
Kyle, come back here! [a door slams shut]
[Kyle's bedroom, night. Kyle is in his pajamas, in his bed, under the covers. He still can't get over the list. He hears a knock at his window and looks over: it's Cartman.]
CARTMAN
I'm better looking than you! [knocks on the window again] The girls think I'm better looking than you, Kyle! [Kyle sighs, stands on his bed, and pulls on a drawstring to close the curtains. Cartman moves with the curtain until he can no longer see inside Kyle's room] Dude, Kyle! Can you hear me? They totally think I'm hotter than you are! [knocks] Kyle! Kyle, I'm more attractive! [knocks again. The curtain is fully closed and Kyle goes back to sleep] Kyle?
[Clyde's house. He's looking at himself in a full-length mirror in nothing but briefs.]
BETSY
[checking in on Clyde] Clyde, it's time to be getting to bed. [Clyde looks at his mom, who closes the door, then turns back to the mirror]
CLYDE
[raises his right eyebrow and knits his left one, then strikes a pose] Hey, what's goin' on? [looks at himself from the side] What's goin' on? Hey. [checks out his ass and then strikes another pose] Oh yeah, hey, whassup? What's goin' on? Nice.
[South Park Elementary, day. Kyle walks down the hall holding his notebook close. The other kids laugh as he walks by. He stops when he sees Clyde testing his moves.]
CLYDE
Hey, what's goin' on?
TWO GIRLS
Hey Clyde.
CLYDE
Hey.
ANNE
Hi Clyde.
CLYDE
What's goin' on? [Kyle is dismayed, but he hears Butters running up to him]
BUTTERS
[laughing] Hey ugly! [runs off. Kyle then walks forward]
CLYDE
[stops him] Hey, Kyle. Look man, it doesn't matter what people think, okay? [Kyle remains sad] You know, Abraham Lincoln was super ugly too, but look what he accomplished. [Kyle is no happier] Chin up, cowboy. [leaves to talk to a girl nearby] Hey, what's goin' on? [the girl smiles]
GIRL
Oh, not much, just hanging around-
BUTTERS
[returns to taunt Kyle some more] Hehehe. Hey, nice... nice ears, haha. Pizza Face! [runs off laughing]
CLYDE
Butters, that's not cool, man. [takes off after him] He can't help how he looks. [the girl walks away]
CARTMAN
[walks up] Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won't stand out so much. Right? [Kyle stays mum, as before] Cool. [walks away. A few seconds later, Kyle's eyes pop open]
[The school cafeteria, day. Three ugly kids are shown eating slowly - two boys and a girl between them. Across from them are a fat ugly girl and another ugly boy. Kyle walks up and sits between these two.]
BLONDE BOY
Hey.
KYLE
Hello. [the girl takes a sip of her milk, then lowers the carton]
BUSHY EYEBROWS BOY
[with bushy eyebrows] Are you going to eat your pickle? [Kyle just picks it up and hands it to him. The boy takes it and starts eating it, slowly]
[The playground, later. As the other kids play various games, the five ugly kids and Kyle sit on the steps by an entrance. Butters runs around in his #11 shirt laughing merrily.]
CRAIG
Could somebody toss the football back? It's over there next to the ugly kids. [the ugly kids just watch quietly. Kyle is more and more depressed]
BIG-EARED BOY
I hate coming to this school. It makes me angry.
KYLE
Yeah.
BIG-EARED BOY
Sometimes I just want to burn it down. Burn the whole school down to the ground!
KYLE
[leans away, then stands up] No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!
FAT GIRL
We're not?
KYLE
No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover.
BUSHY EYEBROWS BOY
Hey yeah.
KYLE
[to the girl wearing glasses] Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses. [removes them, and is met with tiny little eyes. The girl smiles after a few seconds] Let's just... put those back on. [puts them back on the girl, goes back to the steps, sits down and buries his head in his arms with a sigh. A few seconds later, Stan walks by and stops. He looks at the group helplessly. A few seconds later, he walks up to the merry-go-round, where Wendy, Lola, and Red are chatting]
LOLA
I know, that song is so awesome. [Red notices him]
STAN
Uh, Wendy. Could I talk to you?
WENDY
Of course, Stan. [the other two girls smile]
STAN
Just for a minute. Over here. [takes her aside, to a tree nearby]
LOLA
[to Red] You think he's gonna beg her to come back to him?
WENDY
This is a nice surprise. I thought you were never speaking to me again.
STAN
Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made.
WENDY
Which one? We make lists all the time.
STAN
The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?
WENDY
[walks off a bit] Well, personally, I didn't vote him the ugliest. My vote was for Eric Cartman. But enough of the other girls must have felt he was-
STAN
[walks up next to her] So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list.
WENDY
Change the list?! Do you have any idea what that would take?! Maybe you don't understand how important list-making is to girls! It's not just something we do flippantly! There's protocol!
STAN
Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?
WENDY
[thinks for a moment] All right, I'll try and get you into our next list-making meeting. But it won't be easy.
[The girls' meeting room, day. The room is pink, with pink bows here and there. Lists and drawings are everywhere on the walls. Two tables, each seating seven people, face each other. Between them is a smaller table seating two, and a judge's bench. Wendy is already present with Stan when the other girls file in and take their seats. Bebe is presiding.]
BEBE
Today's list meeting is called to order. Rebecca, you have the floor.
RED
If it pleases and sparkles I suggest we continue deliberations on List 47D: Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse?
BEBE
Rebecca moves we work on List 47D. Does that sparkle with all the girls?
GIRLS
Sunshine.
LOLA
Deliberating "Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse"? Millie has the floor.
MILLIE
If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to submit that [motions to her left] Jennifer's purse is by far the cutest. Definitely cuter than Teresa's.
BLOND GIRL
I don't think anyone here disagrees that Jennifer's purse is cuter than Teresa's, but it doesn't make it the cutest.
BEBE
The committee has already decided that nothing with stripes can be in the Top 5 cutest purses.
LOLA
Sunshine sparkle. Wendy has the floor.
WENDY
If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to suggest that we... [glances at Stan] That we reopen last week's list for debate.
GIRLS
[debating] What'd she say? She's gotta be kidding!
HEIDI
Is she crazy?
BEBE
All right, all right, come before the Rainbow Railing. [Stan and Wendy walk into the center of the room]
WENDY
Go ahead.
STAN
Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy?
RED
You thought you should be number one?
STAN
NO.
BEBE
Let me assure you that no list is made hastily by this committee!
WENDY
He didn't mean that. He was just saying maybe we should open it up again for discussion.
BEBE
I cannot by Sparkle Law move to have an old list investigated. However, if you can find recourse for such an inquiry, Wendy, I would review it. Does that sparkle with all the girls?
GIRLS
Sunshine.
[Kyle's house, night. All the lights are out. In his room, Kyle is laying on his stomach and flicks a lighter on, then off, then on again, then off.]
KYLE
They all laugh at me! [flicks on] And the girls giggle behind my back! [flicks off] unable to even glance at my disfigured face.
A VOICE
Do not burn down the school, Kyle. [Kyle looks around]
KYLE
Who said that?
A VOICE
I did. [a body appears in the room to match the voice - it's Abraham Lincoln's glowing ghost] Do you know who I am?
KYLE
Abraham Lincoln?
ABRAHAM LINCOLN
I am Abraham Lincoln. Burning down the school will not solve your problems. You think you've been cheated because you are ugly, but I am here to show you otherwise. Come! There is much to see. [walks out] I want you to look in here. [they approach a random house and look inside. A bored woman is playing with a pencil and pebble at her small dining table] This woman is Nancy Pinkerton. As a child she was consistently the most beautiful girl in her entire school. Her life as a youth was filled with praises, and everything being handed to her. Boys told her she was special. She was funny. She was interesting. But that's only because she was hot. It wasn't until she reached age 40, when her looks started to fade, that she learned she was actually about as interesting and special, as a wet carrot. [they leave her as they found her, playing with a pencil, all alone in her dining room. They move on to the next house] This is the home of your new ugly friend, Yamal. [Yamal is shown playing a piano] Because he's ugly, he gets nothing handed to him. He has to work at making something of himself. But that work is gonna pay off when he's an adult. He will have character, something that kids who are hot rarely develop. Like your classmate, Clyde. [they approach Clyde's house. Clyde is all cool laying on his couch talking to someone on the phone] Now that he knows he's good-looking, he doesn't have to make any effort to be special.
CLYDE
Naw, Rebecca's just a friend. I wanna be with you now. Sure, yeah, I'll buy you some shoes too.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN
Now his life will be about girls. Chatting with them on the phone and buying them shoes. He will most likely marry very young, and not realize until age 40 that he's a total douche. And so you see, Kyle, it is actually the beautiful kids that are cursed.
KYLE
But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN
You must be patient.
KYLE
Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!
ABRAHAM LINCOLN
[sighs] Very well.
[Kyle's house, later. Lincoln stops in front of it and Kyle gets out.]
ABRAHAM LINCOLN
Kyle, you need to think about what I've told you.
KYLE
I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!
ABRAHAM LINCOLN
Well then you're just a fucking asshole! [drives off. Kyle, stunned at that comment, just looks on.]
[Wendy's room, night. Stan is on a beanbag chair as Wendy sifts through the lists at her desk.]
WENDY
Wait a minute. Wait, Stan, I think I've got something! [Stan gets off the chair and walks up to the desk] Take a look at this: during final deliberation of the list for cutest boy, seven girls gave Clyde a glitter rating of only one sparkle.
STAN
I have no idea what you're talking about.
WENDY
It doesn't add up. It is possible that Rebecca made a mistake when she tallied the sunshine votes onto the final list. [they look at each other, smiling]
[Red's house, day. Wendy and Stan walk up; Wendy knocks on the door. Red answers.]
RED
Oh, hey Wendy.
WENDY
Hey Rebecca. Do you still have the voter cards for the list that rated the boys' looks?
RED
[laughs it off] Oho Wendy, we're done with that list.
WENDY
I know, but I think there's been a mistake. Six of the girls I've talked to didn't vote Clyde the cutest. That means that mathematically he should have been-
RED
[menacingly] All right, you need to stop. Digging. Around, Wendy! [looks around to make sure no one else is listening] You might not like... what you find! [begins to draw close to her] Just back off and stop asking questions! [in Wendy's face] You're getting close to a secret that I don't think you can handle! Let it... go! [backs up into her house and closes the door]
STAN
That didn't sparkle with her, did it?
[True-Value Hardware and Home Improvement, day. Someone is purchasing a lot of kerosene, propane, and lighter fluid.]
CLERK
[the name tag says Jerry] One canister of propane, six cans of lighter fluid, [Kyle stands there with determination in his eyes] seven gallons of high-octane kerosene, and a box of matches. [the total is $82.32] Okay, is that everything, little boy?
KYLE
[determined] That should just about do it.
JERRY
Do you like to put this on your True-Value card today?
[The girls' meeting room, day. Wendy and Stan are back in the middle of the room. Two girls are before them, behind the small table in front of the bench.]
WENDY
Nonorary Chair, Mrs. Secretary, I believe a member of our committee has tampered with one of our lists. I've compiled a full report, and it turns out that nobody voted Clyde the cutest in the class. I believe Rebecca changed the list to make him number one.
LOLA
Why would she do that?
WENDY
Right after the list was made, Rebecca started going out with Clyde. You can read all the discrepancies here. [drops the report on the table] We need to remake that list. [the girls look at the list as Wendy returns to Stan]
JENNY
You just couldn't let it go! [puts her left hand on the report]
WENDY
Uh, what do you mean? Call the girls in.
JENNY
I'm afraid we can't do that, Wendy! [the other girl leaves the table]
LOLA
Did you know, Wendy, that Clyde's father owns the shoe store at the mall? A lot of us have always wanted to date Clyde to get free shoes, but we couldn't, because he wasn't popular enough.
WENDY
[points at her] You knew!
LOLA
[pulls out a folder] Unfortunately, the members voted Clyde in the bottom five of the list! That's why we had to manipulate the votes, forge a new list, and... hide the real one!
WENDY
So that you all could justify dating Clyde and get shoes?! How dare you take advantage of your position! I'm gonna tell Bebe and have you both disbarred from the list committee!
JENNY
Bebe?! Who do you think authorized the buyout?!
WENDY
[stunned that her best friend was in on this] No. Not Bebe.
JENNY
She's dating Clyde now. Nobody loves shoes more than her.
STAN
What's going on?
WENDY
When the other girls find out you ignored their votes, they're gonna-
JENNY
Do you really think they'll believe you over the heads of the committee?! We'll simply generate a new list! "Biggest Liars"! And put you at the top!
LOLA
Do yourself a favor, Wendy! Just let it go! And keep your little mouth shut!
WENDY
I don't think so! [goes up and kicks Lola in the groin, hard, much to Stan's shock]
LOLA
[doubling over, dropping the folder] AAGH!
WENDY
[grabs the folder and runs away] Stan, run!
STAN
Jesus, dude! [runs out after her. The two other girls give chase]
[Yamal's house, night. He's playing piano when someone knocks at his door. He goes to answer it.]
STAN
[breathlessly] Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something.
YAMAL
[waits a second or two] He's burning down the school.
WENDY
What?
YAMAL
He said he gonna burn the school down to the ground.
[The night suddenly gets stormy, but it's not cloudy enough to hide the full moon.]
KYLE
[on the school roof pouring lighter fluid out] All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this!
STAN
[he and Wendy reach the roof and run up to him] Kyle! Kyle, don't!
KYLE
Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity!
STAN
The list was a forgery, Kyle!
KYLE
Huh??
STAN
It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list. [a gun is cocked and pops into view, aimed at Wendy]
A GIRL
That's about far enough! [it's Bebe holding the gun and fresh from shopping] Give me that list, Wendy!
KYLE
Stan, what is going on?!
STAN
It was about shoes, Kyle. The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up.
BEBE
Kyle was simple a casualty! To move Clyde meant that Craig has to be moved to number twelve, which moved Jimmy down and moved Jason up!
KYLE
So what number was I??
WENDY
You've compromised everything! Our lists' integrity!
BEBE
Did you see these shoes, Wendy?! [pulls out a new pair of shoes] They're incredible!
WENDY
It doesn't matter how incredible they are; you can't-[becomes distracted] Oh my God, those are amazing.
BEBE
Right?
WENDY
Is that a lace across the top?
BEBE
No, it's a little strap.
STAN
Wendy!
WENDY
[remembers why she's there] Oh, but it doesn't matter. You took it too far!
BEBE
If you hadn't gone all Nancy Drew on us, this would have just gone away! [cocks her gun again]
KYLE
She's gonna kill us?
WENDY
It's too late, Bebe. I've already made a full report and sent a copy to the police. People will know.
BEBE
Oh please, you're lying. [sirens approach and she realizes Wendy wasn't lying. Five police cars converge on the school and cops pour out of them]
OFFICER
[on the bullhorn] Give it up, Bebe. We know all about it. The list was compromised. Kyle Broflovski is not the ugliest boy in the class. [Wendy takes this opportunity to wrestle the gun away from Bebe. A gunshot goes off and Wendy is stunned]
STAN
Wendy! [she steps back and checks herself for bullet wounds, then finds the gun in her left hand. Bebe looks pained, then she checks herself for bullet wounds. Since they're both uninjured, they look around wondering where the bullet went.]
[Kenny's house, night. He and his family are eating breakfast... for dinner. Each of the family members has a bowl of cereal before them. The bullet shoots in through the window, into the back of Kenny's head and out through his forehead. Stuart, his mom, and Kevin jump back in horror as blood splatters on them. They look at each other fearfully.]
KENNY
(Aah-) [his head falls into his bowl. A few seconds later, some Pop-Tarts pop out of the toaster.]
[The school roof, moments later. Officers are now on the roof and handcuff Bebe.]
BEBE
Wait, I, I didn't do anything wrong.
OFFICER
You can explain all that downtown. [the cops take her away. Wendy is holding Bebe's shopping bag]
STAN
Here, Kyle. [hands the folder to Kyle. Wendy looks inside the bag - she's got herself some free shoes.] We've been through a lot, but, you can finally see where you really are on the list. [Kyle holds the folder in his hands, but...]
[The school grounds, minutes later. Wendy stands over a garbage can, holding a lighter and torching the folder containing the real list. She flicks the lighter off and drops the burning folder inside the trash can.]
STAN
Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?
KYLE
I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up.
STAN
...Abe Lincoln?
WENDY
Stan, it's been really great hanging out with you again. I feel like you've changed somehow. In a really awesome way. [smiles]
STAN
Yeah well, I guess a lot of things... change, don't they? [smiles. As they smile, they look into each other's eyes. Stan begins to get queasy] Bwaaaagh! Bwaaaagh! [throws up on her twice, and she just takes it as she used to do in third grade.]
End of The List
