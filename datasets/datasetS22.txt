script:Dead Kids

[South Park Elementary, day. Mrs. Nelson hands out papers to the students.]
MRS. NELSON
I want you all to take a close look at your math exams, children. Some of you did very well, but many of you did not. [hands Cartman his exam, which has a big red F stamped on it]
CARTMAN
Oh, man!
MRS. NELSON
[goes to the board] The addition of fractions is very simple. Let's run through it again. How do we solve this first one? [gun shots are heard outside, followed by faraway screams of children]
BUTTERS
[raises his hand] Add together the three and the three.
MRS. NELSON
[turns to the board] Good, Butters, we add the three's together. [writes 6 in the numerator's place.] And what about the four's? Tolkien?
TOLKIEN
They're the denominators, so they stay a four.
CARTMAN
Wait, wait, Tolkien got an A? But I cheated off Tolkien!
MRS. NELSON
Ah, I can't hear you, Eric.
CARTMAN
I said something's wrong! I got an F, but I cheated off Tolkien!
SWAT OFFICER 1
[armed, runs into the classroom] Active shooter! Active shooter! ["All units, report in" The officer strikes various poses as he checks out the classroom. More gunshots are heard. Mrs. Nelson moves around to stay visible to the class]
MRS. NELSON
And now we divide, right?! Craig, how about you?! What are we dividing?!
SWAT OFFICER 1
[moving offscreen] Active shooter! Active shooter!
CRAIG
Divide four by six? ["Report now!"]
MRS. NELSON
The four by the six?!
SWAT OFFICER 1
Unit 5 in southwest classroom! [more police chatter]
MRS. NELSON
Or the six by the four?!
KYLE
The six by the four!
SWAT OFFICER 1
Southwest classroom, clear! ["Copy. Southwest classroom, clear."]
MRS. NELSON
Now we're gonna retake the exam on Friday.
CLASS
AWWW!
SWAT OFFICER 2
Shooter's in the hallway! All units report! [he and officer 1 leave the classroom and make their way towards the shooter.]
MRS. NELSON
Now I'm giving you an opportunity to do better. I hope you take advantage of it.
SWAT OFFICER
[the officers have swarmed the shooter outside] Put down the gun, son. You don't wanna do this.
CARTMAN
You can see where Tolkien erased his answers and wrote down the right ones! He did it to me on purpose! [a final gunshot]
MRS. NELSON
Eric, that's enough! ["Shooter is down, shooter is down"] Now let's move on to the next equation.
[The aftermath. Aerial shot of the school. Four officers are on the school roof. Several officers are with the students in the playground on lockdown. A couple of paramedics carry the shooter away on a stretcher towards an ambulance. Several officers talk to the teachers on the school's front lawn. The bell rings and the students are released from lockdown]
CARTMAN
That is such bullshit, you guys! Tolkien knew I was cheating off him, so he deliberately put down the wrong answers! Why would he do that?!
STAN
I flunked that test too. I don't understand fractions - they don't make any sense.
CARTMAN
That's not the point, you guys! Why is Tolkien out to get me? There's something going on here.
BILL KEEGAN
Another school shooting today has left students in shock and disbelief.
KYLE
Yeah, Tolkien's probably sick of you cheating off him all the time.
CARTMAN
But why now? That's the question, Kyle. I always cheat off Tolkien. Why did he choose now to hurt me?
SHARON
[a shot of her running towards him. She crosses the police barrier.] Stanley, oh my God! [gets down on her knees and hugs him tight] Baby! Oh, you're okay!
STAN
Uh, hey, Mom.
SHARON
It's all right, Stanley. We're gonna go home and talk about this with your dad. And we will get through this as a family! [stands up and pulls him away] Come on, get in the car!
CARTMAN
Dude, what's up Stan's mom's ass?
[The Marsh house, dinnertime. The family is gathered at the table and Sharon approaches the table with her plate and sits down. She glances over at Randy for a moment, then at Shelley.]
SHARON
Stanley? Well? Do you wanna tell your father about what happened at school today?
STAN
[glances up at Randy, who is cutting a slice away from his steak.] Um... Oh- Oh, I... flunked my math quiz.
SHARON
Noo, the other thing!
RANDY
[looks at Sharon] What other thing? [Stan turns his head away. Randy looks at him] What happened at school today?
STAN
[looks at Randy] Oh, the school shooting?
SHARON
Yes, the school shooting!
STAN
Oh, yeah, some kid shot up the school.
RANDY
Who shot up the schoo- [holds up his knife] was it you?
STAN
No.
RANDY
Did you get shot?
STAN
No.
RANDY
Oh... [goes back to cutting his steak] Well, what's this about failing a math quiz?
SHARON
[Stands up in anger and pounds the table. Shelley looks at her, Randy is suddenly afraid] Are you serious?! Did you not hear what your child said?! Kids died at his school!
RANDY
I'm sorry, Sharon. I...
SHARON
Why are you all acting like this is normal? What is wrong with you people?! [storms away upstairs]
STAN
What's up Mom's ass?
[The master bedroom, night. Sharon is in there folding clothes and putting it away angrily]
RANDY
[enters] Hey, Sharon, ya... doin' okay?
SHARON
No, I'm not okay! Children were shot! They were killed at a school where they were supposed to be safe!
RANDY
Uh huh, and... what else is goin' on?
SHARON
[turns around angrily] Why does there need to be anything else?! Are you kidding me?!
RANDY
[holds his palms up] I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Sharon.
SHARON
Why isn't anyone else emotional?!
RANDY
...Hun, uh... [pause] When was your last...? I mean, you know how sometimes things can seem like a little bigger deal 'cause you know, your... down there?
SHARON
Don't you dare suggest that I'm only emotional because it's-
RANDY
I mean, I'm just, I'm just pointing out that it is around that time.
SHARON
GET OUT, RANDY! I'M NOT OVERREACTING!
RANDY
Okay. Okay, love you, honey. I'll leave you alone. [backs out of the room and sighs] Welp, another three days of this, probably. [turns around and walks down the hallway to the stairs]
[South Park Elementary, Principal's office. Mr. Mackey stands over PC Principal's left shoulder]
PC PRINCIPAL
I understand that there have been some problems here at the school lately. A lot of students are experiencing anxiety, and Eric Cartman just wanted to be able to voice his concerns. Go ahead, Eric. [Cartman and Tolkien are seated in chairs before him]
CARTMAN
Tolkien, [sighs] There are some terrible things that I realize you might have heard from the other kids here at school. There are some rumors that have been going around, about me, that... that I thought Black Panther was a terrible movie. There's rumors that I said it was a structural mess. You know, that the rhinos were really stupid. I want to assure you that I never said anything like that. I loved Black Panther. So if, you know, you feel like there's a need to come after me, to get back at me, I just need you to know that people are lying, because I like Black Panther just as much as you did. I am not a racist.
TOLKIEN
I actually never saw Black Panther.
CARTMAN
[affecting a black accent] Say what, girlfriend? Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Willis? Come on, Raj! You never saw Black Panther??
TOLKIEN
No, I didn't see it.
CARTMAN
But I thought all of you saw it. [Another day, another round of gunshots.]
MR. MACKEY
I got this one. [leaves the office and goes into the hallway.] All right, everyone, get down! Everybody get the fuck down!
CARTMAN
Tolkien, let's be honest with each other, okay? Why else would you manipulate my test grades?
PC PRINCIPAL
How exactly did Tolkien manipulate your grades, Eric? [sirens are heard approaching as gunfire continues]
CARTMAN
There was a test. I should have got an A on it, but Tolkien did things to make me fail, and it's not fair.
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, m'kay, who's shootin' up the school?
PC PRINCIPAL
Is that true, Tolkien? Did you do somethin' to make Eric fail a test?
TOLKIEN
[emphatic] I didn't make him fail, no!
CARTMAN
You didn't make me fail the test and you didn't see Black Panther. Right.
MR. MACKEY
Everyone down!
AN OFFICER
Active shooter, active shooter!
CARTMAN
I mean, I mean, this is ridiculous.
MR. MACKEY
[appears in the doorway directing the officers] Over this way! Into the cafeteria! Right over there, m'kay- No, you shot the wrong one!
[The Marsh living room, night. Sharon has called a group of parents together]
SHARON
Thanks for coming, everybody. I'm sure you all heard there was yet another school shooting today. We have to figure out what we're going to do as parents because this whole thing is out of control! [Randy sighs heavily] We have to ask ourselves why this is happening and do something now!
STEPHEN
Well, you know, Sharon, I think... its a complex issue, you know. It's... it's not really as simple as just... [Randy perks up and begins signing to Stephen furiously. It basically amounts to "Stop! Stop! It's Sharon! She's menstruating!"] What I'm saying is that, that with issues like this, sometimes you have to be kind of... [begins to see what Randy is doing: "she's crazy in the head"] crazy? [Randy motions "heavy menstrual flow"]
SHARON
What are you talking about? [Randy pulls out a red handkerchief and pretends it's a bloody tampon] Do you understand that our children are being murdered?
STEPHEN
Red?
SHARON
How much closer to home can this all hit? [Randy continues signing: "She's menstruating heavily and it's driving her crazy."] It was at our children's school!
STEPHEN
[still not getting it] Crazy time. Crazy red time. [Sharon notices Randy's motions, and Randy stops in his tracks]
RANDY
I agree with my wife.
LAURA
Well, there certainly are things that need changing. Just yesterday, I was at the park with my son Craig and... have you seen the state of the playground equipment? Not only does it seem unsafe, but it's become quite an eyesore.
RYAN
The whole park could use an upgrade, if you ask me. It's become a campout for the homeless.
SHARON
[irate] ARE YOU FUCKING JOKING?! YOU'RE GONNA TAKE ONE SECOND TO COMPARE CHILD MURDER TO PARK UPGRADES?! WHAT IS WRONG WITH EVERYBODY?! YOU'VE ALL GONE CRAZY!! [leaves and goes upstairs. No one says a word]
RANDY
...Anybody need a drink?
[South Park Elementary, day. Upon entering school, the kids are getting wanded at three security stations as two security cameras look on from the ceiling. Mr. Mackey holds the reins of two drug-sniffing dogs who on occasion bark at a random student walking by. Deeper inside the school, Butters is hall monitor for the day, but he's armed with an AR-15]
CARTMAN
[peeks out from behind a pillar] Butters. [during their conversation, Cartman looks away from time to time, making sure no one else is nearby to hear them]
BUTTERS
Waaah! [startled, he almost loses the rifle, but gets control of it and aims it at Cartman] Ah! Uh-oh! [walks over to him] Hey Eric.
CARTMAN
Butters, I need help. My mom says if I flunk another math test, she's gonna ground me from playing Fortnite.
BUTTERS
Oh, Jeez, want me to help you study?
CARTMAN
No, dumbass, I need to get some dirt on Tolkien so he stops punishing me for what I supposedly said about Black Panther.
BUTTERS
Oho, Black Panther? Well that was a great movie! [smiles]
CARTMAN
No it wasn't. But now listen. [Butters' smile vanishes] There's got to be something Tolkien wouldn't want people to know. Something I can use as leverage.
BUTTERS
Well, what do you want me to do? I got hall monitor duty.
CARTMAN
Just ask around. If you find any dirt on Tolkien, give me a call.
BUTTERS
Okay, Eric. [turns around and walks away]
CARTMAN
[thinking to himself.] This world is full of two types of people: [stops by Jason's locker for a moment and looks around] the ones who are honest, and the ones who don't play by the rules. [moves off. Jason looks at him. Next, he's going up some stairs but pauses as another student goes down the stairs, then continues up] Tolkien's got everyone believing he's the one African-American in the entire country who didn't see Black Panther. What else is he lying about? [peeks around a corner and spots Nichole at her locker: she's switching books around. Cartman gets that mischievous look on his face]
[The Marsh kitchen, evening. Randy is seated between Stephen and Gerald, getting tissue after tissue and blowing his nose]
RANDY
[sniffles] It just gets so hard, you know? [Gerald hands him another tissue] Everything's going fine, and then at a certain time of the month I have to start walking on eggshells.
STEPHEN
It's all right, Randy.
RANDY
It's just. it's just once I'd like her to acknowledge it, you know? Just once say "You know, maybe I was overreacting a little bit 'cause of my hormones."
SHARON
[appearing at a doorway to one side of the kitchen] Randy, they announced on the news there's been another school shooting in Jefferson County!
RANDY
[exasperated] Okay, Sharon. Cool.
SHARON
What is "cool" about that?!
RANDY
Nuh-nothing. I love you, sweetheart.
SHARON
GOD! [walks off angrily]
RANDY
I don't know. I don't know how much more of this I can take. It's like, I turn on the TV and dread they'll say something about a school shooting because it's gonna set my wife off.
STEPHEN
Well, Randy, have you stopped to think that maybe this problem is bigger than Sharon's period?
RANDY
[sniffles] What... what do you mean?
STEPHEN
I mean that maybe what's going on really is a big deal. What if this is actually... menopause?
RANDY
Menopause? I don't even know what that is.
[Mala Vista Middle School, Jefferson County, day. Like at South Park Elementary, there are officers on the roof and first responders on the ground. There are helicopters in the air and some reporters nearby. Randy appears, but what he's doing there is anybody's guess.]
PARAMEDIC
[puts a casualty into an ambulance and walks over] Well you see, Mr. Marsh, when the woman's ovaries actually stop producing eggs, it's a significant change. It's this ending of the menstrual cycle in a woman's life that we call menopause.
RANDY
Uh huh. But... if a woman isn't having periods anymore, then why would she still overreact and be bitchy?
PARAMEDIC
Well actually, menopause is one of the most severely hormonal times a woman ever goes through. It's good you sought the advice of a medical professional, because the changes in your wife's body are gonna be confusing and at times hard to cope with.
RANDY
Well wait, you're saying this could actually get worse?
PARAMEDIC
I'm afraid so. [notices some movement nearby] Ah, no. Dead ones go in the other truck. [back to Randy] You see Mr. Marsh, menopause is almost like a super period, and it's been known to last... for up to two years.
RANDY
[trembling] Oh my God!
[South Park Elementary, hallway, day. Nichole is at her locker and opens the door]
CARTMAN
[approaches her] Nichole, can I talk to ya? [leans against the lockers and puts his right foot on one of them]
NICHOLE
'Bout what?
CARTMAN
Word on the street is you and Tolkien are back together.
NICHOLE
We're trying, just talking a lot and seeing if we can work things out.
CARTMAN
Why did you break up with him? What did he do to you?
NICHOLE
That's... really none of your business. [closes the door and walks away]
CARTMAN
[keeps up] He didn't take you to see Black Panther with him, did he? That must have really stung.
NICHOLE
I don't know what you're talking about.
CARTMAN
Oh no? When you guys talk about how sweet Black Panther was, what's he say?
NICHOLE
We've never talked about it.
CARTMAN
Right. You two guys just hang out and talk, and Black Panther never comes up. Why are you covering for Tolkien? What's he have on you?
NICHOLE
[walks away] I gotta get to class.
CARTMAN
[thinking to himself.] $1.3 billion domestic box office, a milestone for African Americans, [on the school roof taking pictures as Tolkien turns to kick back a soccer ball] and I'm supposed to believe that Tolkien and his little sex kitten never even talked about it. [at home he looks over all the pictures he took, with a pencil in his mouth] The all-school test is in less than 72 hours. Unless there's a connection, I'll be grounded from Fortnite for weeks. [looks closely at one of the pictures, which shows Tolkien and his parents shopping]
CARTMAN
Hello, Mom and Dad.
[A doctor's office, day. Sharon is seated at the sofa letting out her frustrations on the good doctor.]
SHARON
I keep thinking... When will be the time when I get the call? You know? When will I answer the phone and find out my son, my daughter, were... killed? At school?
DOCTOR
Mmmhmm. Yeah I see.
SHARON
I live in constant fear that I won't be there to protect my children when something happens to them.
DOCTOR
Well, Sharon, have you maybe considered that your feelings are partly due to... handkerchief balls?
SHARON
What? [looks at him]
DOCTOR
Handkerchief balls. Handkerchief out the balls. [Randy signs: "she used to have periods,"] Red handkerchief. ["but now she's old and going through menopause"] No- no more handkerchief. No more- no more red. Zero. Empty. Old lady.
SHARON
What I'm saying is that I'm so overwhelmed that I-
DOCTOR
Old lady, where's my dick? [Sharon looks at him again] Where's my dick?
SHARON
What the hell are you talking about?! I don't understand! [checks the window and sees Randy] God damnit! [leaves the office and goes outside] Stop acting like there's something wrong with me! Something's wrong with you! All of you! Try having some God-damned compassion! [storms away]
[Tolkien's house, evening. Cartman is visiting them and talking to them about the movie in the kitchen]
CARTMAN
Yeah. yeah yeah, I know. You know, my other favorite part was when Black Panther had those dreams about his dead father. I mean the dad, the tribal leader, speaking to the new king about being a good leader. I've never seen a movie do that before, except for Lion King, of course, but Black Panther was so original.
STEVE
We enjoyed it, yes.
CARTMAN
So, uh, what was Tolkien's favorite part of Black Panther?
LINDA BLACK
Tolkien?
CARTMAN
Yeah. You must have all had some deep family talks about it. What does Tolkien say about it on Black Panther Family Discussion Night? [Tolkien comes down some stairs and sees Cartman at table.]
TOLKIEN
Get out of my house!
CARTMAN
Tolkien.
TOLKIEN
Come on, get out! [yanks him off the chair and shows him out the back door]
CARTMAN
Sure thing. You know, we were just talking about how your family did see Black Panther.
STEVE
Oh, no not the family. Tolkien's mom and I saw it on date night. We're gonna watch it again with Tolkien, though. We don't let him watch it alone because it's PG-13.
CARTMAN
Well, I guess there's nothing more to it, then. Nice talking to you folks. [walks out, but stops moments later] Eh, you know, just one last thing. If you ever found out your son saw a PG-13 movie without you, you'd probably be pretty pissed off.
LINDA
Well, Tolkien wouldn't do that.
CARTMAN
No. No, he'd have no reason to falsely claim he's the only one who hasn't seen Black Panther. [to Tolkien] I'll see you at school.
[The Marsh doorbell, day. Someone is ringing it furiously. Sharon goes to answer it]
HARRIET BIGGLE
Sharon, Sharon, you have to come quick!
SHARON
What is it?
LINDA STOTCH
There's another shooting happening at the school right now!
HARRIET
It just started. Maybe we can make it in time!
SHARON
Oh my God! [takes off with the other woomen]
[South Park Elementary, day. Linda drives up to the school and the three women get out.]
SHARON
Come on, we have to hurry!
LINDA
No, Sharon. You go ahead first.
SHARON
Why??
HARRIET
You just- ya-you should go. [she runs into the school, which is darkened. The security stations are turned off but decorated with garlands. Candles sit on tables, while rose petals on the lobby floor form a heart. Wreaths are everywhere - looks like Randy rented the school out for this. From the left come one group of parents, from the right another group. Harriet and Linda come up behind her as "Love Story" starts up.]
SHARON
What the fuck is going on? [on the second floor, a spotlight shines on Randy as he begins singing. He then goes down a flight of stairs]
RANDY
Where do I begin
To tell the story of how great a love can be?
Surprise, Sharon
The sweet love story that is older than the sea...
[The boys bathroom. Cartman is inside waiting for someone to finish using a stall. Tolkien opens the stall door and exits. He goes to wash his hands. Cartman moves and locks the bathroom door]
CARTMAN
Oh hay, man. The big math quiz is about to start. You gonna let me cheat off you?
TOLKIEN
Nnnope.
CARTMAN
You saw Black Panther without your parents' permission. I typed up all my findings, Tolkien. I made ten copies and put them in envelopes. If I don't pass this math quiz, the envelopes are all set to be sent to ten different news organizations.
TOLKIEN
You did all that instead of actually studying for the test?
CARTMAN
So, what's it gonna be, Tolkien? You can be mad I didn't like Black Panther, but you can't take it out on me anymore.
TOLKIEN
I didn't see Black Panther.
CARTMAN
Then I guess your parents won't be mad when they read my report.
CARTMAN
In poker they call it a bluff. I know that right now, Tolkien is shitting his pants. All I need to do now is wait for the poop to stink.
[South Park Elementary lobby. Randy continues singing.]
RANDY
She fills my heart with very special things.
With angel songs, with wild imaginings
She f-
[The boys bathroom. Cartman is still trying to break Tolkien]
CARTMAN
Tolkien, we are running out of time. If you don't let me cheat off you, I'm going to tell your parents that you saw Black Panther in the theater without them!
TOLKIEN
I didn't see Black Panther in the theater!
CARTMAN
Of course you did, Tolkien! That's why me ripping on it pissed you off so much!
TOLKIEN
I swear on my mother's life, I don't care what you said about Black Panther! Goodbye! [taken aback, Cartman blocks Tolkien's way]
CARTMAN
But Tolkien, I don't understand! If you didn't see it, and you really don't care that I ripped on Black Panther, then why would you let me cheat- [stops himself and gets another idea...] Oh my God. You don't care what I said because you did see it... and you... didn't like it either. [takes a deep gasp. Tolkien lowers his eyelids] That's what this is all about, isn't it? You hate yourself for seeing through the mirage like I did, and that's why you wouldn't let me cheat off you! Well I didn't write Black Panther, Tolkien! It isn't my fault it sucked! Why go after me?! But now, it's over. Don't worry. They're not gonna know you didn't like Black Panther, so long as... you never make me fail another math test.
TOLKIEN
[checks his phone] Well, we're probably both gonna fail now because fourth period already started.
CARTMAN
What? No! [turns to unlock the door] We have to take that test, Tolkien! [opens the door and pulls him out]
[Running down the hallway]
CARTMAN
Come on! We can still get to class on time! [a flurry of gunshots] Oh, great! Come on, we can do this! [as they run through the hallways, gunshots ring out and gunsmoke fills the air. They pass a stairwell in which some students are huddled. They round a corner and spot a boy at his locker. They run to him] Billy, give me your lunchbox! [Billy hands it over. The window to the computer lab is shattered by gunfire. Butters stays out of the gunfire, too scared to move. Cartman and Tolkien reach him] Butters!
BUTTERS
Wull it's the entire glee club this time!
CARTMAN
Butters, I have to get to class! The math quiz is starting!
BUTTERS
Oh crap! The math quiz? It's already fourth period?
CARTMAN
I can't flunk this math quiz, Butters! Cover me!
BUTTERS
Well okay! [slow motion effect as they run through the school] Waaaahahaaaaaagh!
CARTMAN
[Dodges many bullets with Tolkien behind him in slow motion] Yeah, kewll!
[The school lobby. Randy continues singing, the adults are all smiles, oblivious to the gunfire around them. Cartman and Tolkien run across the lobby without Butters and take the stairway up to the second floor. They run to class.]
RANDY
How long does it last?
[an love be measured by the hours in a day]
[The final rush to class. The glee club is still firing away as Cartman and Tolkien reach the classroom. Cartman rolls forward, jumps up, and opens the door. He and Tolkien go in.]
[The aftermath. The wounded are being taken to hospitals, just as in the beginning of the episode]
OFFICER STEVENS
You did everything you could, Mr. Marsh. If your wife can't realize the truth and appreciate you, maybe she never will.
SHARON
Realize what?! What have you been telling everybody, RANDY?!
STEPHEN
Randy was just trying to make you feel loved while you're going through menopause.
SHARON
Menopause?! I'm not going through fucking menopause!
STEPHEN
How do you know?
SHARON
I just got my period this morning!
RANDY
You... you got your period?
SHARON
YES!
RANDY
You just got your period this morning?
SHARON
YES!
RANDY
Soooo the past few days, maybe you have been just a liiittle-
SHARON
NO! NO NOTHING! Don't you guys see what's happened here?! I want you to be angry! Every day we hear about another school shooting! It used to be a big deal! I want it to be a big deal again. I mean Harriet, you came to my house and said there was a school shooting to trick me into going with you!
HARRIET
I was just trying to be a part of the big surprise, Sharon.
SHARON
That's what I'm talking about! That's crazy, Harriet! I want you all to be shocked! I want you all to be sad!
TOWNSMAN
You want everyone to be sad?
HARRIET
Well. Sharon, if you wanted to make me sad, congratulations. [her voice cracks a little] You did a great job. [walks away]
STEPHEN
Yeah, let's go somewhere without so much negativity. [the people disperse]
RANDY
Aw guys, uh she didn't mean it! She just... get, give her a... [sighs, looks at her, turns around and shuffles away]
[The classroom. Mrs. Nelson hands out the quiz]
MRS. NELSON
The quiz is multiple-choice, but be sure to show all your work. You'll have 20 minutes to complete your answers. All right, your time starts... now. [Cartman stares at Tolkien, who notices. Tolkien rolls his eyes and positions his test so Cartman can see his work. Tolkien solves his problems first, then Cartman copies]
CARTMAN
[thinking] Everybody has dirty laundry. All it takes to find it is getting a little dirty yourself. The only question now is, how many Tolkiens are out there? How many others are afraid to say that Black Panther wasn't all that sweet because of the damage it could do to them?
CARTMAN
What do you mean?
CARTMAN
[thinking] I mean, in a school of 200 students, there's already two who are covering up the truth. All Tolkien is doing by letting you cheat off him is keeping the whole thing quiet even longer. [crumples up his test and throws it to the ground, thereby earning another F] There are others out there... and even if it means failing, I'm their only damn hope.
[The Marsh house, backyard. Randy is moping on a tree stump. Sharon opens the back door and sees him]
SHARON
Randy... [walks up to him] we need to talk.
RANDY
Sure, honey.
SHARON
There's been... too much pain and suffering, and... it has to stop.
RANDY
I know, sweetheart, I know.
SHARON
What I'm trying to say is... I've been very emotional lately, and... maybe... maybe I do overreact sometimes.
RANDY
[raises his arms up as if he's witnessing a revelation] Aaaaah?
SHARON
Maybe I need to realize that my emotions can be hormonal and not just take things out on you.
RANDY
Aaah? Aaaaah?
SHARON
Randy, I'm... sorry.
RANDY
Aaaah. Aaaaaah. [voice shaky] Thank you, Sharon. I don't know what it's like to have periods, but I'll try to be more understanding from now on. [Sharon's cell phone rings, and she pulls it out of her pocket.]
SHARON
Sorry, sorry, one second. [answers it] Hello? Yes. What? Oh my God! Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay. [hangs up]
RANDY
What is it?
SHARON
There's been another school shooting. Stan's been shot.
RANDY
Shuh-should we get down there?
SHARON
[Sighs] It's not the end of the world. [smiles]
RANDY
[sighs in relief] Aaaaah. I love you, Sharon. [they hug as he cries on her shoulder]

End of Dead Kids


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:A very special relationship has developed between Butters and the Parish Priest. When the town finds the church doors locked and no sign of the pair, they call in the Catholic Church.

script:A Boy And A Priest

[The Marsh house, day. The family exits and goes to the car. Stan's right arm is in a cast and sling from last week's gunshot at the end of the episode.]
RANDY
Come on, guys, we don't wanna be late!
STAN
[trailing behind] Do I have to go? It's the only day I get to play games.
RANDY
We're all going. Come on! [the others get in]
[On the road. Stan sits behind Randy, Shelley sits behind Sharon]
STAN
[upset] ...Don't understand why we have to go to church every Sunday.
RANDY
Church is important, Stan. Way more important than video games and TV. Church is about community and coming together. A lot of things.
SHARON
All I know is that after church I feel better.
RANDY
Yeah. Me too.
[The church, day. There's a parking lot across from the Church, and the townsfolk park there for Sunday Mass. There's a crosswalk leading to the Church across the street. The Marshes pull in and say hello to the others]
RANDY
Hey, mornin' Stephen, Linda.
STEPHEN
[chuckling] Morning, guys.
[After crossing the street, Randy plays doorman to the other congregants]
TOWNSMAN
Aww thanks there, Randy.
RANDY
You got it- hey, where's Josie?
TOWNSMAN
Oh, she slipped her disc in her neck. Poor thing can barely move.
RANDY
Aw, she's gonna miss church? That's too bad. Give her my best. [other congregants move past him as he talks]
[The church, interior. The congregants are in. Father Maxi finishes reading from the Gospel of John, chapter 3]
FR. MAXI
For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, [adjusts his glasses over his left eye] so that whoever believed in him should have eternal life. This is the Gospel of the Lord.
CONGREGANTS
Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ. [all sit]
FR. MAXI
[begins his sermon] Today's gospel talks about what the Lord has to give us. He did so because we could not control our temptations.
RANDY
Kind of like a priest in a room full of naked boys. [snorts and other people start laughing]
FR. MAXI
Uh Okay, okay, let's, let's try and have none of that today. In John 3:16, the Gospel tells us how God so loved the world he gave to us his only Son
STEPHEN
And a Catholic priest raped him. [all laugh]
FR. MAXI
Okay, okay, Co-come on guys, Nu-now, what greater gift could the Lord has given to us?
WOMAN
Children's underwear which priests couldn't pull down so easily? [all laugh]
FR. MAXI
Okay, let's, let's try to compose ourselves. Let's try and just get through this first one, okay guys? What does it mean that the Lord gave us his only begotten Son?
TOWNSMAN 1
It means that if you're a cute boy at a Catholic priest's swimming party you'd better be gettin'! [The congregants laugh. Randy gets carried and falls on the aisle laughing and pounding his fists on the floor.]
[The Church. Mass ends and the congregant's exit.]
RANDY
Oh, that was a great one, Nelson. Salvation in a little boy's mouth. I'm gonna post that one for sure.
WOMAN 2
Who said the thing about naked boy salad?
STEPHEN
Oh that was Linda!
JIMBO
Well, see ya next week, everybody! [waves and moves off to his left]
OTHERS
Yeah, see ya! See ya! Bye.
[The Marsh car, on the way home]
STAN
I really don't understand the point of all that.
RANDY
[chuckles] Yeah, well, I used to think that about church when I was a kid too.
STAN
But back then I don't know if church was that stupid.
RANDY
Hey, don't say things like that, Stan! You wanna go to fuckin' Hell?
[The Church, sometime later. Father Maxi is blowing out the candles, looking sad. Butters enters quietly through the back. Maxi walks to the front pew and sits down, then sighs. Butters walks up to him]
BUTTERS
Father, can I talk to you?
FR. MAXI
Oh, of course, my child. What's troubling you?
BUTTERS
Well, what's troubling you? [sits down next to Maxi] You know, at school the kids used to all make fun of me sometimes. One kid would say something mean, a-and then the other kids would laugh. I know how lousy it feels. I learned to just walk away, not give 'em all the satisfaction.
FR. MAXI
Well, we can't all walk away. The-the priesthood is all I know. I, I dedicated my entire life to it. Ah I don't know anything else.
BUTTERS
I know it seems impossible. I thought I'd be a punching bag my whole life, but now, I'm one of the popular kids. I even get invited to board game night at Stan's house. My point is, sometimes, y-you just gotta put yourself out there.
[The Marsh house, night. The four boys are seated at a table eating pepperoni pizza and drinking sodas. They're playing a board game called Western Legends. Cartman is wearing a straw hat for the occasion. There's the fifth card and chair waiting for someone to fill it]
CARTMAN
I wanna be Calamity Jane this time.
STAN
How many cards do you start with, Kenny?
KENNY
(Two cards.) [the front door opens and the boys turn to see who it is]
KYLE
Oh, there's Butters!
BUTTERS
[walks in] Oh hey, fellas. I hope you don't mind I brought a friend. Come on in. [steps aside for his friend to appear - it's Fr. Maxi]
FR. MAXI
Uh, hello, my children. [walks in. The boys just stare at him. Moments later he's seated with them, between Stan and Cartman, and Butters sits next to Kyle.]
STAN
Okay, so I-I guess I'm gonna go to the saloon and try to arrest Cartman.
CARTMAN
Let's see what you got, bitch.
BUTTERS
So, Kyle, did you know Father is a really good singer? You like to sing too, don't you?
KYLE
No.
FR. MAXI
Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good. Sing praise to his name, for that is pleasant.
CARTMAN
Ace. You lose. [Stan's jaw drops]
RANDY
[coming down from the second floor] Hey Stan, [Stan sits up] have you seen my- [sees Fr. Maxi at the table, has a stunned look, then smiles] No way! [searches his pockets for his phone] Hang on! Hang on! I gotta post this!
FR. MAXI
[quickly gets up to leave] Uh, I shouldn't be here.
RANDY
This is hilarious! [takes some pics] Four boys and a priest playing a board game!
BUTTERS
Aw, Father, wait a-
FR. MAXI
I should go.
RANDY
Nononoait, let me get the picture. [Maxi goes out the front door and disappears]
BUTTERS
Father! [follows Maxi out and closes the door]
RANDY
Aw shit, I missed it!
CARTMAN
Ugh. [looks at Stan] Why did you invite Butters to game night?
STAN
I didn't invite him. [Cartman looks at Kenny, who just looks back]
[On the sidewalk. Maxi looks dejected as he walks away. Butters catches up]
BUTTERS
Come on, Father, you can't give up so fast.
FR. MAXI
This is just gonna make things way worse. People will rip on me.
BUTTERS
Who cares? Who cares what people say?
FR. MAXI
I do.
BUTTERS
Aw, come on, you gotta be strong!
FR. MAXI
[turns around] Why do you care?!
BUTTERS
Because I was you. Okay? I wasn't always this cool. I've been through it. But then one day, somebody told me something. He said "life is full of love and light and bountiful things," and you know who told me that? You did! Two years ago, in church! You have a right to go and be happy! And if people wanna keep tryin' to knock you down, well, fuck 'em!
[The Church, the following Sunday. The congregants gather again. In the parking lot, The Marshes see Mr. Mackey]
RANDY
Hey, mornin' Mackey!
MR. MACKEY
Well Happy Sunday! Mornin' Ted, Hazel.
TED
Mornin'.
HAZEL
Morning.
OTHERS
Morning. [all head to church]
RANDY
Ah, doin' better, huh, Josie?
JOSIE
A lot better. Thank you.
RANDY
All right. [now at the church doors, tries to open then, no avail] Huh. What the? [realizes that the doors are locked] It's not open.
RYAN
Let me try. [goes up and tries to open the doors]
RANDY
Hey! Hey, it's nine o'clock! Hey!
WOMAN
What's going on? [the doors unlock and open, and Butters steps out]
RANDY
[points him out] Ohhh! [the others laugh]
BUTTERS
There's no church today! You all are just gonna have to find some'n' better to do! [slams the doors shut and locks them.]
RANDY
Hey... [tries to get them open again] Hey, open the door! Hey, come on! [pulls the doors harder and grunts]
[The car, on the way home. No Mass today, so that's it.]
RANDY
Well this sucks. What are we supposed to do without church?
SHARON
I just feel so empty.
SHELLEY
What are you guys so upset about?
RANDY
Shut up, Shelley!
[A clearing in the woods outside of town, night. Randy and Butters are enjoying a small campfire, with marshmallows roasting on the open fire. They sit on two folding chairs]
BUTTERS
Isn't this great, Father? Fresh mountain air, a nice warm fire, a nice warm fire.
FR. MAXI
I have to admit it's a pretty nice way to spend a Sunday. How many are your works, Lord? In wisdom you made them all.
BUTTERS
Yeah, the Lord is pretty cool.
FR. MAXI
He is. Because he brought me you.
[A song comes on whose only verse is "Faith In Christ." The montage that accompanies it starts with Maxi and Butters walking through the forest. Maxi points to a bird. Maxi and Butters row in a canoe. Butters and Maxi sit on a bench at Stark's pond watching the sunset. They watch a family of ducks floats by. Maxi puts his right arm around Butters, Butters puts his left hand on Maxi's lap. They go to the movies and enjoy some snacks. A couple to their left just stares at them. They're in the park on some swings when the four boys stop by and look at them, then continue walking. They're at the organ in church. Maxi plays some tunes for Butters. Maxi shows Butters some Bible verses on the computer. At the public library, Maxi holds Butters a little closer, Butters puts his left hand over his right shoulder and cups it over Maxi's right hand. A man picks out from his computer nearby and looks at them. In his bedroom, Butters shows Maxi the fun he has in playing Professor Chaos. Back in the woods, at night, Maxi shows Butters a shooting star. Still in the woods, during the day, Butters points out a cloud formation that sort of resembles a dove.]
[The cathedral in Denver, day. The archbishop sits at his desk writing something down. The phone rings. He answers it.]
ARCHBISHOP
Denver archdiocese. The Lord be with you.
MR. MACKEY
[outside the church in South Park] And with your spirit, m'kay? Uh, oh my name is Counselor Mackey, and w-uh we seem to be havin' a little problem with our local church here in South Park. Our uh... our priest has gone missing.
ARCHBISHOP
[mutes the phone and whispers] Oh, not another one! [unmutes the phone] All right, listen to me carefully. Your local priest has not done anything wrong. He's probably just taking some time off. Why is that suspicious?
MR. MACKEY
Well, it's not suspicious, we just kind of don't know what to do, you know? Uh.
ARCHBISHOP
We'll take care of it. There's no need to involve the authorities. Just sit tight. [hangs up and switches to another line] Send in a clean-up crew now! [the doors quickly open and the clean-up crew appears.] We've got another one. A priest on South Park has gone rogue and is probably out doing his thing. I need you guys to get up there and clean up his mess.
AUXILIARY
Don't worry, Your Holiness. By the time we're done with that town there won't be a lick of cum anywhere.
[KidZone Roller Rink, day. Happy birthday, Clyde. Kids and adults skate in the center of the building while others sit outside the rink eating. At the birthday gathering, Kyle approaches Clyde and talks to him. Butters appears. Throughout the scene, "Flash Light" plays]
BUTTERS
Happy birthday, Clyde! [behind him is Fr. Maxi. They both have gifts for Clyde.] Hope you don't mind I brought a friend.
FR. MAXI
For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works.
CLYDE
Dude, what are you talking about?!
FR. MAXI
Come on, Father. Let's go tear up the skating rink. [they drop their gifts off and head to the rink. Clyde is angered by Fr. Maxi's presence, and Kyle notices.]
KYLE
Just leave it alone, Clyde. Butters brings him everywhere.
CLYDE
I don't care, I don't want a priest at my fucking birthday party!
CARTMAN
[turns to calm Clyde down] It's all right, Clyde, it's all right.
[In the rink, Butters tries to get Fr. Maxi to fit in.]
BUTTERS
That's it! You're doing great!
FR. MAXI
Uh-ah. Oh, Mother Mary. I feel like everyone's staring at me. [he's not wrong...]
BUTTERS
Nobody's staring. I'm gonna get us some soda pop. You just mingle with the other fellas![skates off]
[Skeeter's wine bar, day. "A Place To Fall Apart" plays and the front doors are wide open. Randy and Stuart sit at the bar. Randy drinks some wine, Stuart some beer]
RANDY
What's it all about, huh? Are we just bags of carbon and water put on this planet for no purpose? You're born, you die, then you're just... food for the worms.
STUART
It all does seem pretty meaningless.
TOWNSMAN 2
[appears in the doorway] Hey, the church is back open! There are people inside!
JIMBO
What?
RANDY
The church is back open?
TOWNSMAN 3
Oh boy! Let's go let's go let's go let's go!
OTHERS
The church is back open! Thank God! Let's go!
[The church, inside. The cleanup crew is there doing its work.]
AUXILIARY
Scrub everything! Police can detect even a milligram of cum and rectal blood!
RANDY
[enters with other bar patrons] Hey!
AUXILIARY
Oh uh, hello my children. The Lord be with you.
TOWNSMEN
And with your spirit.
RANDY
What uh, what are you guys doing?
AUXILIARY
Oh, we're just giving the place a nice scrub down while we wait for your priest to come back. He was called to South America last week.
RANDY
Last week? No, he was at my house a couple of days ago playing board games with the boys.
AUXILIARY
[turns the vacuum cleaner off. His assistants look at Randy] No he wasn't. Look, I assure you everything is fine. Your priest will be back. Just have some patience.
TOWNSMEN
Awww.
TOWNSMAN 4
Come on, guys. [the townsmen turn around and leave]
[The Marsh house. Having spoken to Randy, the cleanup crew heads to his house and scrubs it down, They're working on the table.]
AUXILIARY
Scrub everything. Bleach those board-game pieces. You find something on that chair?
PRIEST
It's either blood and cum, or ketchup and mayo. [the priest is scrubbing down Cartman's chair]
AUXILIARY
Well, just get rid of it. Bleach the entire top of the table. That's probably where he mounted them.
STAN
[comes down the stairs and approaches the crew] Uh, excuse me.
AUXILIARY
[turns to face him] Oh. Hello, my son.
STAN
What are you doing?
AUXILIARY
What are we doing about what?
STAN
Well, I mean, it looks like you're scrubbing and bleaching our tables and chairs.
AUXILIARY
Mmm mmm, that's not what's going on. Your local priest was never here, actually.
STAN
Yeah he was. I played with him.
AUXILIARY
Oh, you did! [whispers loudly to the priest behind him] Better get the Kumby. [the priest walks off]
STAN
What's a Kumby?
AUXILIARY
We're just here to cleanse your spirit, my child.
PRIEST
[returns with an odd tool] Praise be to Christ. [the Kumby looks like a portable wet/dry vacuum cleaner worn like a backpack. The priest uses it to wipe Stan down]
[KidZone Roller Rink, day. The kids sing "Happy Birthday" to Clyde. Clyde blows out the candles. In the background "More Bounce To The Ounce" plays]
BOYS
Yaaay!
FR. MAXI
And now let us pray.
BOYS
Awww.
FR. MAXI
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts. which we are about to receive.
CLYDE
Kyle, will you do something please?!
FR. MAXI
[quoting Psalm 78:26] He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens...
KYLE
Why me?
CARTMAN
[gritting his teeth] Kyle!
FR. MAXI
...through Christ our Lord. Amen.
KYLE
[walks up to Butters] Uh, Butters, can I talk to you really fast?
BUTTERS
Wow! Sure, Kyle. Be right back, Father. [follows Kyle away]
FR. MAXI
All right, my child.
[A snack room nearby. Kyle waits for Butters there, and Butters walks in]
BUTTERS
Huh-what's up?
KYLE
Butters, you know, you can just bring your priest with you everywhere. I mean, sometimes the guys just wanna do stuff and not have a priest around.
BUTTERS
What are you saying, Kyle?
KYLE
I'm saying it's just kind of awkward, Butters. [Fr. Maxi goes to look for these two boys and just happens to walk by the snack room. He stops just short of the doorway and listens] He's bumming everybody out. Nobody wants to hear about Jesus at a birthday party.
BUTTERS
Well, of course, you don't.
KYLE
It's not just me. It's everyone, Butters. He can try all he wants, but he just doesn't belong here. [Maxi's face drops, then he walks away quietly]
BUTTERS
Well I'm sorry for tryin' to help out somebody who didn't have anywhere else to turn. We'll both just leave. I thought you were better than that, Kyle. [walks out]
[KidZone Roller Rink, outside. A van arrives carrying the cleanup crew. The song they're listening to is "Faith In Christ," which played earlier. "It's a Love Thing" starts as the cleanup crew fans out across the rink]
AUXILIARY
All right, clean and scrub everything. I want it spotless! Get any evidence the priest might have left behind.
ASSISTANT
There's something over here, [tastes the frosting on Clyde's slice of cake] but I can't tell if it's cum or frosting.
AUXILIARY
It's an 8-year-old's birthday party. Of course, it's cum. Get the Kumby!
PRIEST
[arrives with the Kumby and wipes Clyde down] Praise be to Christ.
AUXILIARY
[approaches Cartman and wipes him down with a cloth. Cartman panics a bit] Hello, young man. We're looking for your town priest. Was he here?
CARTMAN
Yeah, but he left with Butters.
AUXILIARY
Tell me about this Butters.
CLYDE
All right, that does it! [the priest is now wiping down his back] Get out of my birthday party or else I'm gonna call the police! [the priest turns the Kumby off and stands up]
[Twin Pines strip mall, day. Butters wanders the parking lot looking for Fr. Maxi.]
BUTTERS
Father! Father? Has anybody seen my priest? Father, where'd you go? [Maxi is sitting by a Dumpster and raises his head when he hears Butters approaching. Butters then sees him] There you are! I've been looking everywhere.
FR. MAXI
Just leave me alone.
BUTTERS
But you're missin' the party!
FR. MAXI
Look, your friends are right, okay? I don't belong there. I, I don't belong anywhere. [gets up and walks away]
BUTTERS
[follows Maxi through the parking lot] But, they just don't understand you like I do.
FR. MAXI
Stop defending me! There are things you don't know!
BUTTERS
But it's not your fault.
FR. MAXI
Yes it is! It is my fault!
BUTTERS
Why?!
FR. MAXI
[turns around and faces Butters] Because I knew, all right?! I knew! Years ago, when bad things started coming out about the Catholic Church, I went to the Vatican and ... I found out that the problem was worse than anyone even thought. I thought I could help fix it, so, I kept my mouth shut. I thought there was cancer in the Church that we could get rid of. But the Church is cancer. It's not about a few bad apples. There are only a few good apples, and I'm clearly not one of them. So just stay away from me!
BUTTERS
But... I thought we were pals.
FR. MAXI
You thought wrong. [turns around and walks away. Butters shrinks a little in worry]
[The neighborhood, evening. Butters walks down the street with his head down. A vehicle comes up behind him - it's the cleanup crew's van. The auxiliary bishop looks out the window and gets Butters' attention]
AUXILIARY
Hey. Hey there. What's the matter, my child? Did you know that Jesus loves you?
BUTTERS
Sometimes I wonder.
AUXILIARY
"And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me." [Galatians 2:20. He dangles a candy bar in front of Butters.] Want a Three Musketeers?
BUTTERS
...No thanks.
AUXILIARY
You like camping trips? You wanna go camping?
BUTTERS
No.
AUXILIARY
I got a bunny in the back. You wanna see the bunny?
BUTTERS
[perks up] Well, okay! [the bishop takes him to the back and opens the doors. Butters frowns] Stan?
STAN
I have no idea what's going on.
CLYDE
Worst birthday ever! [the priests toss Butters in to join Stan and Clyde, then slam the doors shut]
[The Marsh house. Randy watches TV, but doesn't see anything he likes.]
RANDY
Boring [click] Dumb. [click] Stupid. [click] Good, but dated in its view of gender norms. [The doorbell rings and he slumps a bit] Wugh. [gets up and answers it. Fr. Maxi is at the door]
FR. MAXI
Hello, Mr. Marsh.
RANDY
Father! [turns around, dancing] Hey, hey Sharon, it's Father!
FR. MAXI
M, Mr. Marsh-
RANDY
He's back!
FR. MAXI
-please.
RANDY
Hey, Father's back!
FR. MAXI
I'm just going around trying to locate little Butters Stotch. I thought he might be here playing a board game with your son?
RANDY
Oh uh, no. I haven't seen, Butters. Or Stan. But Father, please, we all need church.
FR. MAXI
I'm sorry, but I have to keep looking. [turns around and leaves] I said some terrible things.
RANDY
Please, Father, we're all lost, and the cleanup crew hasn't helped at all.
FR. MAXI
[stops and turns around] What cleanup crew?
[The forest, night. Stan, Clyde, and Butters have been stripped and tied up, but have enough freedom to roast marshmallows. Wolves and owls are heard. The priests hide behind a bush nearby]
AUXILIARY
Any sign of him?
ASSISTANT
No, but this should draw him out. The cute one says it's where he and the priest first got together.
AUXILIARY
All right, when the priest gets here, we'll take care of him and then eradicate this place of any evidence.
PRIEST
Should I bring out the Kumby?
AUXILIARY
No, this is gonna be a bigger job than that. Bring out... the Kumboni. [moments later, the priest drives up in a Kumboni]
[The Stotch house, day. Stephen and Linda are sitting on the sofa watching TV. The phone rings and Stephen answers it.]
STEPHEN
Hey Randy, what's up?
RANDY
[driving] Stephen! Stephen, listen! The boys are missing! Fr. Maxi thinks they've been taken by the other priests!
STEPHEN
[jumps up from the sofa and walks away from it] Taken by priests?? Should we call the police or buy some condoms? [smiles]
RANDY
[laughs] Okay. Okay-okay, that was good. [mood change] But seriously, we have to find these guys! The boys are in danger!
STEPHEN
But where would priests go this late at night?
LINDA
To a midnight sale at Boys 'R' Us?
RANDY
What-what'd she say?
STEPHEN
She said, "To a midnight sale at Boys 'R' Us."
RANDY
Can, can I post that?
STEPHEN
Sure, she doesn't care.
FR. MAXI
[grabs the phone from Randy] Give me that! Mr. Stotch, have you heard from Butters at all?!
STEPHEN
Well yeah, we got a really weird text from him saying not to worry, he needed to do some camping.
FR. MAXI
[puts down the phone] Oh my Lord. I know where to go. And when we get there... I'll need to go in alone.
RANDY
Yeah I'll bet. [snickers]
[The forest clearing. The assistant looks around]
ASSISTANT
He's not showing up.
AUXILIARY
Try the priest call. [the assistant pulls out a calling device similar to a duck call and blows into it]
KID'S VOICE
I love Jeeesus! I love Jeeesus!
ASSISTANT
[turns around] I don't think he's coming.
AUXILIARY
Oh he's coming all right. Just not here. Let's start packing up. You. [points at the priest] Get on the Kumboni and eradicate this place along with everything in it.
PRIEST
Yes, your Holiness.
FR. MAXI
Wait! [arrives at the clearing]
BUTTERS
Father.
FR. MAXI
You wanted to find me? Well, here I am. I know why you're here. The Church can't have... someone like me going around making it look bad. So go ahead. [turns away] Do it. Just get it over with.
BUTTERS
What?? No!
AUXILIARY
You think we searched all over town and set up this trap to kill you? We're Catholics! We're here to give you what you deserve! A full transfer to the beautiful Maldive Islands. Luxury airfare and beach house included! [theh other two priests applaued]
FR. MAXI
A transfer?
AUXILIARY
The Church took care of everything, just like it always has from the beginning. "Thank you for cleaning up all my cum."
FR. MAXI
I can just... go? I can start over in the Maldives?
AUXILIARY
No one will make fun of you there. They can't even speak English. And don't worry, there'll be plenty of priests to take your place here. Look, I know it's a big change, but... you know what you have to do.
FR. MAXI
Yes, I do. I don't think I have any other choice.
BUTTERS
No. He can't.
AUXILIARY
Well, our work here is done! Praise be to Christ, guys. It certainly was a tough one, but I think we got everything cleaned up and- [the Kumboni starts up and smashes through some trees. Fr. Maxi is driving it right at the priests.] Aaaaugh!
ASSISTANT
The Kumboni! Aaah! [Maxi mows him down and kills him] Aaaaagh! Aah!
PRIEST
Aaaaugh! Aaaaugh! [Maxi mows him down and kills him]
AUXILIARY
[Maxi is hot on his trail] No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. [Maxi mows him down, killing him. Moments later, Maxi stops the engine and walks up to the boys]
BUTTERS
Father, you did it!
FR. MAXI
I'm so sorry, my child. I never meant to say we weren't pals.
BUTTERS
Does that mean you're gonna stay?
FR. MAXI
Of course. Now I have purpose, and I have meaning. My job here is to protect you. All of you.
[The church, Sunday morning. The doors open and Fr. Maxi is back in his robes looking at the congregants]
FR. MAXI
The Lord be with you.
CONGREGANTS
And with your spirit. [they go in]
[After the Gospel, Fr. Maxi launches into his sermon]
FR. MAXI
Today I'd like to talk on the subject of penance. The penitent... have deep remorse, but for true penance, we must be humble enough to admit that the Lord's forgiveness is undeserved.
RANDY
Kind of like how getting raped by a Catholic priest is undeserved. [all laugh]
FR. MAXI
In Job 42:6 we read "Therefore, I reprehend myself and do penance in dust and ashes"
TOWNSMAN 1
And in choir boys' butts and asses. [all laugh]
FR. MAXI
So we are not to punish ourselves, but instead, we are to make ourselves passionate.
TOWNSMAN 5
Like a Catholic priest at a Chuck E. Cheese. [all laugh]
RANDY
Oh God, it's good to have my faith back!
FR. MAXI
Passionate to understand all that Christ sacrificed, and how hard it truly was.
WOMAN 4
How hard what truly was? [all laugh]

End of A Boy And A Priest


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Mr. Hankey must defend his character or lose everything that is important to him. Mr. Hankeyâ€™s offensive behavior puts him in jeopardy of being fired as the Director of the Annual Christmas Pageant. Meanwhile, at South Park Elementary, Strong Woman and PC Principal face a whole new set of challenges in their relationship.

script:The Problem with a Poo

[South Park, day. The scene starts with South Park Elementary being shot up again, then the Community Center appears as two police cars rush by, then City Hall appears. The city council is in session, Mayor McDaniels presiding]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
People, it's time we faced some hard truths. The town is looking to us for answers, and all we keep doing is burying our heads. We need to cut the budget for this year's Christmas pageant.
RANDY
[after a dramatic pause] My God...
MAYOR MCDANIELS
I've asked the director of the holiday show to stop by so we can all give him the news.
RYAN
He's not going to take this well.
COUNCILWOMAN
If he doesn't, we should just let him go. God knows it's about time.
MAYOR'S AIDE
Hey, a lot of people like him, all right?
MRS. TESTABURGER
Yeah, and a lot of people think he stinks.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Let's just get this over with. [presses down on the intercom key] All right, send him in. [the door opens and Mr. Hankey hops in.]
MR. HANKEY
Hooooowwwdy ho! You wanted to see me? Better hurry. We only have two months before Christmas.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Mr. Hankey, we called you in to let you know that... your Christmas Pageant funding has been cut. By half.
MR. HANKEY
What? But I can barely make a good Christmas show with what I have!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
We just don't have the support for the Christmas show that we used to. The truth is... some people find you offensive.
MR. HANKEY
Offensive? What about me is offensive?
COUNCILWOMAN
Some people think shit isn't the best representation of Christmas.
MR. HANKEY
Yuh... you people can't do this. Christmas is the most magical time of the year.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
The decision has already been made. Thank you, Mr. Hankey, and good luck with the show.
[South Park Elementary, day. Another school shooting has occurred and the police are back to investigate. In the music room, the kids practice "Deck The Halls". The conductor taps the dais with his baton - it's Mr. Hankey.]
MR. HANKEY
Okay, stop. Kids, the song's called "Deck The Halls," not "Let's All Suck Balls." Mow, come on, kids.
CRAIG
Why do we have to do this now?
CARTMAN
Yeah, it's not even Halloween yet.
MR. HANKEY
Restoration Hardware put up their Christmas decorations two weeks ago, all right? Now listen: I didn't want this either. I wanted the Denver Symphony, but they cut my budget and I'm stuck with you. Now let's take it from the top! [taps his baton]
[The hallways. PC Principal walks down the main hallway with purpose. He stops at the Vice Principal's office and turns left, steps forward, stops, sighs, then turns the doorknob and peeks in]
PC PRINCIPAL
Vice Principal Strong Woman?
STRONG WOMAN
Yes, PC Principal?
PC PRINCIPAL
I was seeing if there's anything you... might want to discuss with me?
STRONG WOMAN
What would we need to discuss?!
PC PRINCIPAL
I am- so sorry- that I took advantage of my position and- manipulated you into a physical encounter.
STRONG WOMAN
Hey! I am a strong woman, all right?! I don't get manipulated! We both are guilty of an ill-advised relationship at the workplace, but that was long ago, and I have decided to move forward.
PC PRINCIPAL
Are you sure we can move forward?
STRONG WOMAN
Why not? We make a mistake, we move forward.
PC PRINCIPAL
I was just thinking there might still possibly be some fallout from-
STRONG WOMAN
Nope! We're just gonna forget about it and put it to rest.
PC PRINCIPAL
You don't think there's anything else to dis- to discuss?
STRONG WOMAN
No, I don't! Bye-bye. [PC Principal backs out and closes the door. Strong Woman lets out a sigh of relief, then stands and goes to a mirror, which reveals tears in her eyes and a big belly. She's pregnant.]
[Kyle's house, day. Stan, Kenny, and Cartman are pounding on the front door. Kyle answers it but doesn't invite them in.]
STAN
Dude, Kyle! Dude!
CARTMAN
Dude!
KYLE
What?
STAN
Did you read what Mr. Hankey tweeted last night?!
KYLE
What Mr. Hankey... tweeted?
STAN
Yeah. I guess after band rehearsals he went on Twitter to talk about us.
CARTMAN
Look! [Cartman takes out his phone and hands it to Kyle so Kyle can see for hiimself]
KYLE
Oh. Jesus Christ, dude.
[Mr. Hankey's room. He's at a sewing machine making a Santa outfit.]
MR. HANKEY
Santa Claus is on his way. He's loaded goodies on his sleigh.
He'll drop them off on Christmas Day
KYLE
Mr. Hankey.
MR. HANKEY
Oh, Kyle! Hoowwwwdy ho!
KYLE
Mr. Hankey, everyone's really mad at you. Were you on Twitter last night?
MR. HANKEY
[slowly] Yeah.
KYLE
Did you tweet "The kids of South Park are retarded homos who can't play music"?
MR. HANKEY
[more slowly] Yeah.
KYLE
Why would you tweet that?! All the kids are really pissed off!
MR. HANKEY
It was a bad attempt at a joke. I'm sorry. Will you tell the kids I didn't mean it?
KYLE
What do you want me to say?
MR. HANKEY
The fact is, I couldn't sleep last night so I took some Ambien. Do you take that stuff? It turns your brain into oatmeal. Please, Kyle, tell the kids I didn't mean any harm. We've gotta focus on Christmas! [Kyle just looks at him]
[The school gymnasium, day. PC Principal and Strong Woman stand on the basketball court facing the student assembly.]
PC PRINCIPAL
All right, everyone, listen up. The vice principal has asked to speak with you today. She believes it is time that we all as a school finally discussed in-vitro fertilization.
STRONG WOMAN
That's right, kids. Many women today make the choice to have children without a man in their lives. They can have their eggs fertilized by an unknown person's sperm in a lab.
PC PRINCIPAL
That's right, Strong Woman. In today's society it is wrong to just assume that a pregnant woman had intercourse with a man.
STRONG WOMAN
[doubles over in pain] Ooohhhhhhh!
PC PRINCIPAL
St-students at this school need to be careful because it can be offensive to ask questions like "Who's the father?"
STRONG WOMAN
[doubles over in pain] Oh! Ooohhhhhhh!
PC PRINCIPAL
[looks at Strong Woman, then softly] You- you all right, Strong Woman?
STRONG WOMAN
I'm fine!
PC PRINCIPAL
So-so we'd like to have all our students talk to their parents tonight about in-vitro fertilization, and after that, let's just put the whole issue behind us. [Strong Woman stands up and fluid drops to the floor from her belly. Several seconds of stunned silence follows]
STRONG WOMAN
That's my water breaking. Not a big deal. [more fluid gushes out]
[The town square. Mr. Hankey gets the Christmas stage ready]
MR. HANKEY
Christmas time. It's Christmas time. Christmas time. Yeah, it's Christmas time
.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[appears to his right with a crowd of citizens] Hankey! [he looks up and notices the crowd] We need to talk about what you tweeted!
MR. HANKEY
Oh, I'm sooo sorry. I took Ambien two nights ago and I called the schoolkids homos.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
No, I'm talking about what you tweeted last night! [takes her phone out and reads] "The city council members are a bunch of pussy-licking Islamists."
MR. HANKEY
Oh-oh Jeez, did I say that? Listen, if you're tired and you can't sleep, DO NOT take Ambien. Okay? Whew!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
I'm afraid we have no option but to fire you as executive planning manager of the city council.
MR. HANKEY
Fire me? Nonono, please. I-I'm really sorry. [the crowd turns and leaves] No, no wait! Wait, please give me another chance! Don't do this! What about Christmas? [croops in defeat]
[South Park, day. A large sign announcing Mr. Hankey's Holiday Pageant greats the visitor upon arriving in town. A car speeds out of town]
PC PRINCIPAL
[in the passenger seat] It's okay. We'll be at the hospital soon. Just keep breathing.
STRONG WOMAN
[driving, despite her condition] I didn't need your help!
PC PRINCIPAL
I'm just a co-worker helping another co-worker in need.
STRONG WOMAN
Yeah, well, people might get the wrong idea! I have worked my whole life to be the strongest woman possible, a person little girls could look up to. If those girls thought I was the type to get knocked up by my boss-
PC PRINCIPAL
I certainly do not want to put an pressures on you as a female, but at times I wonder if there is more we should discuss.
STRONG WOMAN
There's nothing to discuss! I made a mistake and I am MOVING FORWARD!
[The law offices of Mayer, Schulz, and Tate, day.]
MR. HANKEY
My civil rights are under attack. They can't just fire me from the Christmas show! The whole thing is my creation!
MALE LAWYER
Uh, last night you tweeted "The city council can suck my Mexican dick."
MR. HANKEY
It was a joke. Look at me! I don't even have a dick! Get it? [no reaction from the lawyers] Okay, okay, look, I know: it wasn't a good joke. But it really wasn't my fault. The fact is, I went home last night and I was angry. I couldn't sleep, so I took some Ambien. And then I started tweeting. Ambien messes with my head. You ever take that crap?
FEMALE LAWYER
You want us to take this up against Ambien? They have the best lawyers in the world.
MR. HANKEY
Well, I thought maybe I could get them in a defecation lawsuit. [he is quickly kicked out] Rrrgh!
[J. Prewitt law office, later. Mr. Hankey is seated at the lawyer's desk and speaks to him]
MR. HANKEY
And I never ever would have said those things about the city council, but the Ambien makes me kind of blackout.
MR. PREWITT
I'm sorry, sir, but we don't represent pieces of shit.
MR. HANKEY
Why not? [he is quickly kicked out] Rrrgh!
[Gerald's law office, later. He's talking to Gerald about suing Ambien]
MR. HANKEY
And I just thought maybe we could convince the city council to hire me back.
GERALD
Look, I'm sorry, but I learned a long time ago that if you defend poop, you get stained. [he is quickly kicked out. This time he just sits on the step and mopes]
KYLE
Mr. Hankey?
MR. HANKEY
Oh, Kyle. [sadly] Howwwdy ho.
KYLE
What are you doing here?
MR. HANKEY
Just tryin' to find some help. There isn't a lawyer in town who will take me. Wait a minute... You! You're the son of a lawyer. You have lawyer blood inside your veins! You can help me with my defecation lawsuit, Kyle!
KYLE
Me? What can I do?
MR. HANKEY
Please, Kyle. You're the only person left who can help me. You and me, pal, we are gonna fight the system!
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Strong Woman and PC Principal have arrived at the hospital]
VOICE-OVER
Paging Dr. Bender.
DR. BENDER
Your vice principal gave birth to all five babies with no epidural. I must say, she's a very strong woman.
PC PRINCIPAL
That she is.
DR. BENDER
The quintuplets are all healthy and resting away. [they stop by the maternity ward and look in] There are her babies, right there.
PC PRINCIPAL
Oh, dude. Bro.
DR. BENDER
Yes, cute little buggers, aren't they? Three boys and two girls.
PC PRINCIPAL
I think it's wrong to force gender specification upon them at this young age.
DR. BENDER
Funny. That's exactly what their mother said. [turns to face him] The quints are all Caucasian, blue-eyed, and something kind of weird.
PC PRINCIPAL
What's that?
DR. BENDER
Well, the babies are all extremely PC, the likes of which I have never seen. Watch this. [walks to the intercom and presses the mic] Three black guys walk into a bar. [the newborns immediately start crying.] It's okay! It's okay! They left! They left! [the babies stop crying]
PC PRINCIPAL
Doctor, would it be possible for me to... hold the PC babies?
DR. BENDER
Oh I'm sorry. That's only for the mother and father. Though, according tot he vice principal, the father doesn't even exist. [PC Principal wilts]
[The neighborhood playground, day. The boys are shooting hoops without Kyle. Cartman shoots, but it's an air ball]
KYLE
[runs up] You guys! Hey guys! I think I figured it out.
KENNY
(What?)
KYLE
How to get Mr. Hankey another chance. [no reaction from the boys] There's by-laws in the city council that community service leaders can't be terminated without a hearing. I need you guys there as character witnesses.
STAN
Nnnope.
CARTMAN
Not getting that stink on me.
KYLE
He has a right to be heard. He's meant a lot to this town.
STAN
Dude, why do you keep defending him, Kyle?
CARTMAN
Yeah. You know everyone in town thinks he's a piece of shit.
KYLE
Come on, guys. We can't just turn our backs. How many times has Mr. Hankey been there for us?
STAN
Mmmm. Once, kind of?
KYLE
Look, he messed up, but I don't know if he deserves everything that's coming down on him. I wanna stand by my friend.
CARTMAN
Mm, let's see how that goes for you in 2018. [the boys turn away and resume playing]
[Strong Woman's recovery room, later. PC Principal peeks inside, then goes in and closes the door and walks up to her bed]
PC PRINCIPAL
Vice Principal?
STRONG WOMAN
My babies! Where are they?
PC PRINCIPAL
Shh it's okay. The babies are fine, resting in the nursery. They're the most... [voice cracking] they're the most PC babies I've ever seen.
STRONG WOMAN
You shouldn't be here! People will start getting suspicious!
PC PRINCIPAL
Look I was the one who abused my position and took advantage of a subordinate-
STRONG WOMAN
Nobody took advantage of me!
PC PRINCIPAL
N-Not took advantage. You know what I'm saying.
STRONG WOMAN
And I'm a strong woman!
PC PRINCIPAL
All I want to do is help. We can say I'm the manny. And if anyone has a problem with that, then they have a problem with gender biases, and they can take it up with me! We can keep the truth about the babies totally hidden. [the door opens and three nurses walk in holding the babies. The parents notice this]
STRONG WOMAN
Oh yes, that curriculum should be fine for the students. I'll start working on an all-school proposal.
PC PRINCIPAL
Oh yes, very good, Vice Principal. See that it is done by back to school night.
FEMALE NURSE
A-hall right, Mommy! Your little bundles of joy are here. Oh! And who's this?
PC PRINCIPAL
I am the manny. Anyone have a problem with that?
FEMALE NURSE
No, not at all.
MALE NURSE
Everything good here? [the babies start crying. He looks around, then at his shirt, which has an image of Speedy Gonzales on it.] Aw! Are these PC babies? [PC Principal and Strong Woman are stunned]
[Park County Courthouse, day. The Mr. Hankey Hearing is being televised.]
VOICE-OVER
And now, live from the town courthouse, it's the Hankey Hearing on South Park 13. [inside, Kyle gets his papers ready as the courtroom audience takes its seats]
MR. WAITHOUSE
Mr. Hankey- [Mr. Hankey sniffles] Fourteen hours ago did you or did you not say "everyone in South Park is a God-damned douchebag"?
MR. HANKEY
Y-es. That was a bad attempt at a Christmas joke.
MR. WAITHOUSE
But there's nothing in that statement about Christmas.
MR. HANKEY
That's what I said: it was a bad attempt.
MR. WAITHOUSE
What part of the statement was actually-
MR. HANKEY
You wanna hear a good Christmas joke?
MR. WAITHOUSE
In 2005 you said- [Mr. Hankey sniffles] You said that you had no recollection of a- [Mr. Hankey sniffles]
MR. HANKEY
Sorry, I got the sniffles.
MR. WAITHOUSE
Mr Hankey, do you understand how important these statements are to the citizens of this town?
MR. HANKEY
All I understand is it's only eight weeks until Christmas! If we don't stop wasting our time, we're all gonna miss out on the most magical part of the whole year!
MR. WAITHOUSE
What did you mean last night when you tweeted, "The Mayor of South Park is a titless whore"? [Kyle's jaw drops and his head falls forward on the table]
MR. HANKEY
Oh, come on! It was a joke! That's it! That's it, I've had enough of this whole fucking sham! Fuck all you and fuck this whole system! It's Christmastime!! [leaves his chair]
[Food 4 Little, day. Strong Woman is out of the hospital and shopping with three of the quints]
STRONG WOMAN
It's okay. Shhh. We just need to get some diapers. Shhh.
ELDERLY WOMAN
[passing by] Ohhh, what adorable little babies.
STRONG WOMAN
Thank you.
ELDERLY WOMAN
[getting a closer look] My, they look very PC.
STRONG WOMAN
Oh no, no, they're not very PC at all.
MAN WITH ORANGE SHIRT
Awww, look at the PC babies!
STRONG WOMAN
They actually aren't PC.
MAN WITH ORANGE SHIRT
No? [bends down and tells the babies] Did you hear Monica Lewinsky's becoming Republican? The Democrats left a bad taste in her mouth. [the babies cry, the adults laugh]
STRONG WOMAN
Oh God, shhhh, nonononono. Sheee.
PC PRINCIPAL
[arrives with the other two infants] Is everything all right?
MAN WITH ORANGE SHIRT
Oh Look! More PC babies!
WOMAN 1
They're everywhere!
STRONG WOMAN
I told you we need to shop separately! Sh! Shhh!
MAN 2
[stops by] Excuse me, where's the Oriental food aisle? [the babies cry harder]
MAN WITH ORANGE SHIRT
Shhh! Quiet! There's PC babies!
[Denny's, day. Kyle is at a booth with Mr. Hankey.]
MR. HANKEY
Gee whiz. Thanks for comin' out with me, Kyle. [a waiter walks by behind them and stares at Mr. Hankey] These days, it's like you're my only friend. [Kyle looks up and notices some boys looking at him. Next shot shows Clyde, Craig, Tweek, and Tolkien at a window booth looking back at Kyle and Mr. Hankey. Kyle looks dismayed] So what's the plan, huh? What you got figured out to get my job back?
KYLE
I had a plan. You decided to call the Mayor a titless whore!
MR. HANKEY
[laughs it off] Oh, it was a joke, Kyle. Sometimes, when I take Ambien, I'm really groggy and moody the next day. It's a real side effect. It's printed right on the bottle.
KYLE
[growls] I don't know how much longer I can defend you. People are starting to think I'm shitty.
MR. HANKEY
Kyle, don't you understand this whole thing is a smear campaign? Why are people focusing on a few stupid words I said when Christmas is just around the corner?! It's like everyone's forgot about what Christmas means! [brightens up and gasps] Oh my God! Kyle, that's it! The holiday spirit!
KYLE
It's October!
MR. HANKEY
And that's the point! Don't you see? What we need to do is get everyone in the Christmas mood! We can bring the whole spirit of the holidays early!
KYLE
[looks away] Okay, you do that.
MR. HANKEY
Nonono. Kyle, you gotta help me! I can't do this alone!
KYLE
I have homework and stuff!
MR. HANKEY
You're all I have! Even my wife left with the Nuggets 'cause of all the pressure! Please!
KYLE
Okay, fine! I'll help you. But listen to me: I don't care how restless you get tonight, NO AMBIEN!
MR. HANKEY
Well, maybe just a little if I really can't sleep.
KYLE
No! None! If you want my help this time, you aren't taking any Ambien tonight. That's the deal!
MR. HANKEY
Yay! It's a deal! Oh boy, Kyle, I'm so excited! We're gonna bring the spirit of Christmas to South Park!
[The neighborhood park, day. PC Principal and Strong Woman take the quints out for a stroll]
JOGGER
Oho, look at the little PC babies!
PC PRINCIPAL
Oh, no, we're from uh, Missouri.
JOGGER
I know a PC baby when I see one! [to the babies, cooing] Who loves social justice? Who's the future? Who's the big bad future? Yes they are. [one of the quints giggles]
WOMAN 2
Ohh, PC babies!
PC PRINCIPAL
All right, please move along, folks. We don't want the babies to get excited. [a synthesizer begins to play, and everyone within earshot of it stops to listen]
MR. HANKEY
Helloooo South Park! Come on, everybody! Get over here! [Craig, Clyde, Tweek, and Tolkien exit the Halloween Outlet store with their cosumes] Who wants to see a miracle?! Howwwdy ho, everyone! Guess what time it is? It's Christmastime! [fireworks go off as citizens gather at the town square]
ALL
Oohhhhh!
MR. HANKEY
Deck the halls and trim the trees, Christmas time is here.
Gonna sing and flush our worries away. It's the best time of the year
That's right, everybody! Who loves the holidays? [all cheer] Just like when Christ was born, let's all be with our mothers and fathers and- [the PC babies begin to cry] Let's not forget that, that boys and girls all over the world are
MAN 3
Hey! Hey, careful! You're upsetting the PC babies!
MR. HANKEY
The PC what-Listen! Christmas season means peace on earth and good will towards men! [the crying continues] All right, all right look, what, what is the holiday season about? It's about loving each other, right? Loving and- [getting exasperated] What?! What are they crying about now?!
MAN 4
Sometimes PC babies don't even know what they're crying about.
MR. HANKEY
Well, then tell the babies to shut the fuck up! [the crowd turns on him] Who the fuck brings a Goddamned baby to a Christmas show, anyway?!
KYLE
[leaps away from the keyboard and grabs Mr. Hankey] Mr. Hankey, stop!
MR. HANKEY
Lemme go, Kyle! These people are idiots! [proceeds to beat up Kyle and wreck the stage. The crowd disperses]
[Downtown South Park. Kyle walks down the street battered from the beatdown Mr. Hankey gave him]
GIRL
Mommy, something stinks. [they stop to look at Kyle]
MOTHER
Yeah, like shit. [takes her daughter's hand and moves on. A shopkeeper shuts his door as Kyle walks by]
MAN 5
[drives by and honks] You stand up for all pieces of crap?! Asshole!
[The neighborhood park, moments later. Kyle walks by with his head down. His friends stop playing to look at him. He looks back]
CARTMAN
Uh huh! 2018. [they turn and walk away as Kyle moves on. Further on, he sees Mr. Hankey and stops]
MR. HANKEY
Kyle, listen. It was 3 a.m. last night and I still hadn't slept, so I de- [Kyle ignores him and walks on] Kyle? Kyle, please! They're gonna run me out of town, Kyle! They're going to erase me and everything I ever did.
KYLE
[turns around] You want them to erase me, too?
MR. HANKEY
Kyle, we can all be shitty sometimes.
KYLE
Uh... [sighs a few times, then turns away with nothing to say and walks off]
[Strong Woman's office, night. The babies are put to sleep]
PC PRINCIPAL
They're so strong, like their mother.
STRONG WOMAN
They're so PC, like... whoever their father is. [PC looks at her] We'll never keep them quiet. Our only hope is to keep them hidden. [closes the office door]
PC PRINCIPAL
Can they ever know that I'm their dad?
STRONG WOMAN
We did the most un-PC thing imaginable. Think about what that would do to them. We can never let them know the debaucherous, sickening circumstances that brought them into this world.
PC PRINCIPAL
Then I'll just try to be the best principal to them that I possibly can.
STRONG WOMAN
And I'll be their strongest vice principal, and hopefully... the world will calm down and not do anything to upset them.
[South Park news.]
NEWSCASTER
Today... South Park says goodbye to Mr. Hankey. The longtime union of this town and the holiday figure... is over for good. We should all feel pretty great about ourselves, give ourselves a little, nice pat on the back, as we, as a society, continue to try and sweep away all the poop. [next scene is Mr. Hankey walking out of town as the residents look on]
MR. HANKEY
Well, everyone, I guess this is goodbye. It sure has been swell.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
No goodbyes, Mr. Hankey. You just need to go. We already called you a Poober.
MR. HANKEY
A Poober? They have that? [A Lyft car honks and pulls up] Oh, you mean Lyft. Well, okay. Goodbye, everyone. I hope I brought a few smiles and a few laughs into your hearts.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[opens the back door for him, then firmly] Goodbye, Mr. Hankey. [he hops in and she closes the door. The car pulls away and Mr. Hankey looks out the window and sees the town for one last time with a sad look on his face]
STAN
Where will he go?
RANDY
He'll have to find a place that accepts racist, awful beings like him. There are still places out there who don't care about bigotry and hate.
[Springfield, day. Mr. Hankey hops into the town square, which is filled with Springfield residents, including the Simpsons]
MR. HANKEY
Hoowwwwdy ho!
BART
Cool man, talking crap.
APU
Welcome, my friend. Please, rest your weary feet and make yourself at home here.
ALL
Hooray!

End of The Problem with a Poo


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The Vaping epidemic hits South Park Elementary. Butters is selling vape pens and all kinds of fruity-flavored vape accessories at school. Meanwhile, Randy decides he should move the family to the country and take up farming.

script:Tegridy Farms

[South Park Elementary, day. Another day, another shooting. Mr. Mackey sits in his office talking to the Marshes. Shelly has her arms crossed and looks away.]
MR. MACKEY
Allright, thanks for comin' in today to discuss your daughter's behavior, m'kay?
RANDY
Exactly what kind of trouble is Shelly in, Mr. Mackey?
MR. MACKEY
Well, unfortunately, we found out our playground monitor has been accepting favors to look the other way at recess, and uh, your daughter sent him an inappropriate picture. Of her butthole. M'kay?
RANDY
Her butthole?? [to Shelly] Shelly! [back to Mackey] Why would the recess monitor want a picture of my daughter's butthole?!
MR. MACKEY
We've been havin' a lot of issues at the school with kids vaping lately and, uh, they bribe the recess monitor however they can.
RANDY
Jesus Christ, how much worse can things get around here?!
MR. MACKEY
Uhkay, let- uh, the, there is good news, m'kay? We had the picture analyzed and it turns out it was actually just a picture of a dog's butthole, m'kay [holds up a real-life picture of a dog's butthole], that your daughter claimed was hers. M'kay, there it is, a little fur right there. [smiles]
[The ride home. Randy is at the wheel. Nelson is in the car behind him, and there's a third car behind them.]
RANDY
Seriously?! Dog's butthole?! That's what we're doin' now, huh?! There's not enough bad things in the world, we get called into school, "Here's a dog's butthole for ya." That's what it's all come to, Shelly?! [they stop at a red light] I'm over it, Sharon. [a long guitar intro begins to play] I am seriously over it. Don't you just wanna start over? Go back to simpler times?
SHARON
What do you mean?
RANDY
I've had it. School shootings, pieces of shit taking Ambien and tweeting, priests raping kids, and somehow... I'm not laughing anymore. Let's do it, Sharon. What I've always talked about. Let's get out of here. Go buy a farm and live off the land.
SHARON
Are you being serious?
RANDY
Never been more serious.
NELSON
[honks his horn] Hey, the light's green!
RANDY
[looks out the window] Shut up, Nelson! [turns to Sharon] Let's move out to the country. Go back to simple living when things mattered, like hard work and 'tegridy.
SHARON
How will we make a living?
RANDY
By growing things and, and selling what we make with our hands. We can do this, Sharon. It's time.
[As the following song plays, the following occurs onscreen: Randy sells the house and the family drives away. The family arrives at its new farm. The camera pans to show the countryside. Randy starts harvesting the hemp that's already there. Next, he sifts out the hemp from the leaves, then he's printing out "100% Hemp" shirts, then showing the hemp to his family. Next, he's harvesting more hemp, watering the crop, and getting hemp milk out of some hemp. He makes some hemp cookies for the family. Later he's drying stalks of marijuana plants in the barn. Next, he seeds the field with marijuana seeds, then growing some hemp in a greenhouse. Later, he spritzes water on some leaves, then he writes up a list of nouns and adjectives on a chalkboard outside. Next, the camera pans to the left showing some farm names: Golden Mary's Kush Farm, John & Judy Cannabis Acres, High Valley Marijuana Farms (Organic), and then Randy's farm, Tegrity Farms]
RANDY
[slow start] This ol' world is getting to me. There's just no trust, no 'tegridy.
So I loaded up the kids, took my wife by the arm, [switches to fast tempo with a band joining in] and I moved on out to a Colorado farm.
Now it's early to bed, early to rise. The crops are plowed and it's no surprise
City folks are fightin' and I don't give a darn (darn, darn)
'Cause I make my livin' on a Colorado farm.
I gotta drive the tractor, gotta cut the grass
Chut-chut goes the baler like it's never gonna last
There's food in the kitchen and there's bud in the barn. (barn, barn)
That's life livin' on a Colorado farm.
Ice-cold beer, pickup truck. Country music, listin' shit.
We got tegridy to keep us warm.
That's what you get on a Colorado farm.
And I'm gonna stay on a Colorado farm.</i.>
Shiiit.
[South Park Elementary, day. The four boys walk down the hallway]
KYLE
[to Stan] So just like that? Your parents sold your house and everything?
STAN
Yeah, it takes me like an hour to get to school now. It sucks. All because Shelley bribed the playground monitor to let her vape during recess.
KYLE
Why would your sister wanna get addicted to those things?
CARTMAN
Well, your little brother does it too, Kyle.
KYLE
What are you talking about?
CARTMAN
You didn't know? The Kindergartners are like the biggest vapers at this school.
[The sandlot, day. The kindergartners have their own little piece of heaven on the school playground. Five of them are in there, two of them on the sand, three others seated on a bench on the edge of the sandlot. Ike sits between the other two and blows some smoke. He then tries to hide the vaping pen when Kyle calls out to him.]
BOY
[with bulldozer] Vroom, vroom. I am a truck!
JENNY
[with an action figure and a sand castle] Watch out for the monster.
KYLE
Ike! Ike, do you have a vaping pen?!
IKE
[trying to hold in the smoke] Nope. [accidentally blows some more smoke]
KYLE
Dude! Gimme that! [takes it from Ike and walks back to his group]
IKE
Hey, gimme back my vaporizer! [gets up and stands between Jenny and the other boy]
KYLE
What is this? [reads the label] Cherry-flavored nicotine. [turns around] Are you joking?!
IKE
Oh, come on! All the kids are doing it.
JENNY
[whips out her vaporizer] Yeah, I like lemon flavor.
BOY
[whips out his vaporizer] I like raspberry.
KYLE
Why do you want nicotine?!
JENNY
Do you know how hard it is being a kindergartner? We need a break sometimes.
KYLE
These things are bad for you! Do you understand?! Bad kindergartners!
QUAID
[approaches Kyle as Ike steps aside] Relax, bitch. [inhales his vaping pen] Try some gummy bear surprise. [blows some of it in Kyle's face, making Kyle cough]
STAN
[takes the vaporizer from Kyle] All right, where'd you guys get these?!
[Tegridy Farms, day. Randy is on his tractor growing through his crop. He stops and removes his hat for a moment to wipe the sweat off his forehead. He takes a swig of his Tegridy Farms hemp milk, then notices a neighboring farmer]
RANDY
Mornin' Joe? How's the farmin'?
JOE
Doin' good, neighbor! Just planted some Purple Skunky Kush. Harvested the Super Hindu Haze last week.
RANDY
Well that's fine, Joe, just fine. I'm growin' some Green Willy Stranger myself. And the Catatonic Tegridy Bud is takin' well. [turns the engine back on]
JOE
Well, see ya 'round, neighbor!
RANDY
So long, Joe! [he moves the tractor forward and then turns to the left]
[South Park Elementary, recess. An overhead view of the entire school is shown as the bell rings and the kids enjoy their free time. Next, the boys walk through the playground in search of someone.]
STAN
Kindergartners said it's some big kid in a trench coat. [notices a kid on a snow drift] Hey look! [a shot of the boy looking towards the parking lot and standing in the sun, so they can't make out who it is]
KYLE
That's gotta be him.
STAN
What are you gonna do?
KYLE
I'm gonna tell him if he sells a vape pen to my brother again, I'm gonna kick his ass! [marches towards the boy. The other follow] HEY YOU! [the boy turns around and steps off the drift. It's...]
BUTTERS
Oh, hey fellas!
STAN
[surprised] Butters?
BUTTERS
What are you guys doing?
KYLE
Butters, are you selling vapes?
BUTTERS
Well, sure! Whatcha lookin' for? [opens his overcoat. Inside, there are labels and packets for grape, orange, tropical passion, chocolate, vanilla and strawberry flavors taped across his shirt and coat.] I've got strawberry, vanilla, tropical passion...
KYLE
WHAT?!
BUTTERS
Tropical passion. It's like mango and kiwi.
STAN
Butters, do you understand this stuff is an epidemic in our school?!
BUTTERS
Yeah, and at five bucks a pop, we're gonna be rich!
CARTMAN
[steps forward] Butters, this is for Kyle. [punches him hard in the face]
BUTTERS
Oof. [falls to one side and his vape pens fall out of his jacket]
[Tegridy Farms, the living room. Randy puts a pot plant on a small table. Shannon is standing near the couch with her arms crossed]
SHARON
Randy, I think we need to have a talk.
RANDY
[adjusts the placement of the plant] No time to talk, the agricultural inspector's about to drop by. Once we get certified from him, we can start sellin' like a real farm. [approaches Sharon] Have patience, wife. Soon our fortunes will change. [someone knocks on the door] Oh, that must be him now! [goes to answer it]
TOWELIE
Yes, I'm with the State testin' board? Is this uh,... [checks his notepad] Tegridy Farms?
RANDY
Name is right there on the sign. Come on back!
[Tegridy Farms, shed. Towelie has set up his equipment and is ready to evaluate. Randy and Shannon stand nearby and observer.]
TOWELIE
[making some minor adjustments to the machine] So with this Vestin device, I can check not only the THC levels in your product but also detect any impurities and give you a final score based on overall chemical makeup. [inhales from the machine. Readings are 43:4, 23:8. His eyes eventually become bloodshot] Yep. That's good shit. Now let me test the levels in your organic house blend. [inhales again. Readings are 59:4, 55:2. Skeptically, Sharon folds her arms] Yep. That's good shit. [exhales and writes on his notepad. Shannon walks away unimpressed.]
RANDY
Now, what about the Tegridy Jungle Bud?
TOWELIE
Let's test it out. [samples it, breathing deeply. Readings are 42:0, 76:2] Whoa.
RANDY
Yeah?
TOWELIE
Whoa.
RANDY
Yeeahh?!
TOWELIE
I don't know what Tegridy is, but... that is some good shit!
RANDY
[jumps up in excitement] All right!
[South Park elementary, boys room. Cartman is in the stall taking a crap. He's typing something into his phone while singing the Subway $5 Footlong jingle.]
CARTMAN
Five,
$5,
$5 footlong.
[Eric stops sining, as the sound of the boys room door is slammed open. Suddenly, the stall door is kicked open by an angry Butters, who now has a black eye.]
CARTMAN
[surprised] Butters!
BUTTERS
[yelling] Why'd you punch me, Eric?!
CARTMAN
I had to!
BUTTERS
I thought we were partners!
CARTMAN
Butters, next time when Kyle walks up to you and says "Are you selling vape stuff," you say "No, I am not, Kyle."
BUTTERS
You punched me in the face!
CARTMAN
Butters. we have to be extra-cautious right now, or else we're -- hang on, hang on -- [strains to poop] Hang on. Hang on. [a nugget manages to drop] Ahhh! [gets off the seat] Okay, we have to be extra-cautious, Butters. The whole operation is in a period of transition. [pulls his pants up and flushes the toilet.]
BUTTERS
Well what's that supposed to mean?!
CARTMAN
[exits the stall] In case you haven't noticed, we're falling behind. We haven't sold enough product to pay off our overhead. The people I bought from are on my ass! Everything costs money, Butters. The pens, the juice, even that jacket I got you. [as they walk to the restroom door, they pass by Kyle and don't notice he's there by the sink] We can't start getting sloppy now. Do you understand?
BUTTERS
Well, I don't know how this means you can go and punch me in the face-
CARTMAN
Everything will make sense, Butters. I told you. [shows him out] Just stick with the plan, okay? [closes the door. Kyle is about to come up behind him and say something, but Cartman quickly acknowledges Kyle] Did you know that vaping is way healthier than smoking cigarettes? [Kyle is left dumbfounded]
[Tegridy Farms, day. The family is seated at table for the meal.]
RANDY
[serving the meal and talking with a southern accent] All right, everyone! Who's ready for some farm-to-table supper?! [gives bowls to Shelley and Stan] We've got some hemp milk here, hemp oil and vinegar bruschetta, some hemp-seed tabouli. And guess what the napkins are made from? [a car horn sounds outside] Oh, wonder who that could be? [gets up to check. The driver gets out of his car and approaches the farmhouse.] Howdy. What can I do ya for?
VAPE REP
Is this Teh-gridy Farms?
RANDY
Yeah, name's right there on the sign.
VAPE REP
Our company is interested in your product. We'd like to do some business with you.
RANDY
Really? Hey, that'd be great. What kind of company- [stops himself when he notices the man vaping]
VAPE REP
We're one of the top vape companies in the state. We'd like to add your product to our line.
RANDY
[chuckles] Oh no, sorry. I don't want my Tegridy Bud put in those pussy sticks.
VAPE REP
Pussy sticks?
RANDY
Yeah, you know. Penis pens, wussy vape, lady joints. Not on my farm, no sirree.
VAPE REP
You got a problem with vaping? It's cleaner and healthier than traditional smoking!
RANDY
That's nice. Now how's about you take that pussy stick and get off my farm before I shove it up your ass and you're blowin' mist out your butthole?
VAPE REP
All right. [leaves. Before getting in his car, turns around and says] You can be a part of progress or you can get run over by it.
RANDY
[drops his southern accent] Yeah, whatever. All you're doin' is blowin' smoke -- Sorry, "fruity steam." Pussy.
VAPE REP
What happened to your accent?
RANDY
Go vape some more, ya fuckin' puss!
VAPE REP
[goes to the driver-side door] You'll be sorry! [gets in and backs out]
[South Park Elementary, day, main office. A new receptionist, Ms Blaze, is on the job and is reading Us Magazine . Kyle walks in and talks to her.]
KYLE
I need to speak with the principal.
MS. BLAZE
Okay, what is it regarding?
KYLE
I'd rather just talk to him.
MS. BLAZE
Right through there. You're second in line. [Kyle walks further in and sees Butters and Cartman seated, waiting to see PC Principal as well. They are reading "General American" and "South Park Super School News" and lower their papers as Kyle approaches.]
CARTMAN
Oh, hey Kyle.
BUTTERS
Hi, Kyle!
CARTMAN
What are you up to?
KYLE
You know what I'm up to! [walks up to the principal's door.]
CARTMAN
[hops off the chair and stops him] Okay, cool, but come check this out. This is really cool.
KYLE
Don't touch me!
CARTMAN
Just come- no, just come see. [takes him by the hand and takes him away. Butters follows them]
KYLE
Don't- touch me!
CARTMAN
This is really cool. [the three of them leave the office and stand in the hallway] You know, Kyle, people all need a way to relax. And there's no proof that vaping is that bad for you.
KYLE
You're selling it to kindergartners!
CARTMAN
Kindergartners need a break too, Kyle!
BUTTERS
You know they took away their nap time.
KYLE
You're such penises!
CARTMAN
Would you rather the kindergartners smoke cigarettes? [Kyle folds his arms and is no longer listening.] Would you rather they drank? That's not good! [Kyle turns to go back into the office] Kyle, Kyle, Kyle! Okay, okay! [he and Butters stop Kyle and turn him around] Just please listen, all right? The truth is... we want out. Butters and I thought we could just make some easy money, but you gotta pay off the 6th graders, then you gotta pay off the recess monitor to look the other way. We're in deep, Kyle. Just let us see enough to get out of debt, and we will stop. I swear it.
KYLE
You're so full of shit.
CARTMAN
Come on, Kyle, we all make mistakes. Did you already forget last week? You know... Ronan Farrow was here asking about you.
KYLE
Ronan Farrow? No he wasn't.
CARTMAN
Yes, Kyle! He was right over there! Just please, [Kyle looks over his shoulder to where Cartman said Farrow was] give us two days to make back the money we need to get out from under this. and we will stop. You have my word.
KYLE
Fine. But no more pushing it on little kids! You got that?!
CARTMAN
Okay, I'll focus my marketing on another direction. Thank you, Kyle. [He and Butters leave, and Kyle looks over to that spot again.]
[Tegridy Farms, day. Randy is back on the tractor. He stops when he sees the vape rep at Joe's house across the path. The rep hands Joe a check, then turns around and takes a vape as Joe just holds the check. Randy gets off the tractor and walks over to Joe's house just as Joe and his wife are packing up to leave the area.]
RANDY
Whatcha doin', Joe?
JOE
Oh, hey Randy. We uh, we sold the farm.
RANDY
Just like that, huh? You gonna let those people with pussy sticks take over everythin'?!
JOE
Yeah. They paid us great. My wife and I are gonna move to Maui!
RANDY
Oh. I hope you didn't pack your tegridy, 'cause clearly,[puts a marijuana leaf steam into his mouth] your tegridy ain't goin'. [turns and walks back to his house. He opens the door and walks inside. He notices something crumpled at a corner of the living room] Are you still here?!
TOWELIE
[completely stoned and surrounded by some marijuana leaves] Ah I-I didn't know chickens wore suspenders.
RANDY
Agh! [walks off]
[South Park Elementary cafeteria. The students are eating lunch. The main five are seated with Tolkien, Clyde, and Craig.]
CARTMAN
[yawns loudly] Man, am I feeling tired! All this hard work at school?
BUTTERS
Yeah, I wish I had a little pick-me-up! Somethin' fresh and fruity to go with my lunch!
KYLE
Just stop. It's so obvious what you guys are doing.
CARTMAN
[pressing forward] It sounds so great right now! [cups his hands to form a megaphone] Can anyone help with some fun, fruity flavors? [the sound of a wall crumbling in heard. Soon, a wall does crumble and a Vaping Man appears]
VAPING MAN
Oh yeah!
CARTMAN
[quickly stands by the VM] Hey guys! It's the Vaping Man! What are you doing here, Vaping Man?
VAPING MAN
I'm here to offer my fun, fruity flavors in a refreshing mist.
CARTMAN
Vaping? Hey, that's bad for you. Vaping's only for cool kids.
KYLE
[quickly comes up to Cartman and talks quietly] Can I talk to you for a second?
CARTMAN
Sure, Kyle. What is this about?
KYLE
Can I talk to you over here?
CARTMAN
Well of course. [they walk far enough away so they're out of earshot of Vaping Man]
KYLE
[yelling] What did I say about pushing it on little kids?!
CARTMAN
How is this pushing it on little kids, Kyle?
KYLE
Fun, fruity Vaping Man?!
CARTMAN
It's marketing! Kyle, we have to make the money to pay off our dealer. How else are we supposed to do it?
KYLE
All right, how much do you owe the dealer?
CARTMAN
Why?
KYLE
How much?!
[Tegridy Farms, day. An angry Stan is churning hemp milk in a copper kettle to make hemp cheese while Randy pours in the milk]
RANDY
Isn't this great, Stan? Livin' off the land? [walks to the table and picks up a plate with marijuana leaves]
STAN
No, it sucks. I hate this. I wanna go back home.
RANDY
Well you see that? We're talkin' now. [adds some leaves into the mix] When was the last time we really talked like this?
STAN
I hate you so much.
RANDY
Ithink we're havin' a breakthrough moment. I want to give you somethin', son. Somethin' I made that I want you to have. [goes to get it and brings it back] It's a hemp hat.
STAN
No.
RANDY
Come on, let's just see how it fits.
STAN
Pleaes, no.
RANDY
Here, just-just look. Just try it. [takes off Stan's cap and puts the hemp hat on him. When the hat goes on Stan's head, "Two Princes" by Spin Doctors starts to plays.]
SPIN DOCTORS
One, two
princes kneel before you
That's --
[Randy removes the hat from Stan's head and the song stops. He puts it on again, and the song starts up from the beginning, causing Stan to now look annoyed.]
SPIN DOCTORS
One, two
princes kneel before you
RANDY
Whoa.[he removes it and the song stops. He puts it on again, and the song resumes, causing him to grin in amusement]
SPIN DOCTORS
That's what I said now.
Princes --
[Big Vape vaping bar and store. The place is crowded with young progressive people and filled with vape smoke. A big vape dealer is at the counter buying some vaping products.]
CLERK
There you go, and thanks for shoppin' at Big Vape. [the vape dealer looks around and then leaves. The clerk buzzes him out.]
CARTMAN
[on the sidewalk with Kyle and Butters, across the parking lot from the store] That's him. That's my guy.
VAPE DEALER
There you are. You got my money?
CARTMAN
[subdued] Kyle? [motions for Kyle to talk to the vape dealer]
KYLE
Look, my friend is very stupid and should have never gone into business with you. [Cartman and Butters back off]
VAPE DEALER
Who are you? [Butters and Cartman leave]
KYLE
I'm just seeing if I can help settle things. You probably don't realize it, but vaping is a really big problem at our school.
VAPE DEALER
Look, I'm just filling a job that somebody else would fill, all right? [Cartman and Butters return with a body bag with a body in it without the others noticing it.]
KYLE
Okay, look, this is the money I've saved up from my past three birthdays. Can we call this even and end it?
VAPE DEALER
Aw, come on, man. I don't wanna take your birthday money. [Butters turns and walks away]
CARTMAN
Whoa, hey dude! Why is there a dead hooker next to you?
KYLE
What?
VAPE DEALER
What?
CARTMAN
Dude, that is a dead hooker. What are you doing with it?! I'm calling the cops! [whips out his phone.]
VAPE DEALER
You just put that dead hooker there.
KYLE
Cartman, what are you doing??
CARTMAN
[into the phone] There's a dead hooker at the vape store!
BUTTERS
[returns with a crowbar and swings it into the vape dealer's kneecap] There! [runs away with the crow bar]
VAPE DEALER
[falls over in pain] Ow!
KYLE
Oh shit!
CARTMAN
Get the vaporizers, and the cash! Get the cash, Kyle!
KYLE
Wha-what? What are you doing??
CARTMAN
Just get the- Oh shit! Ronan Farrow!
KYLE
WHAT?!
CARTMAN
Get the stuff and the cash! Ronan Farrow, Kyle! We've gotta get out of here! [he and Kyle get everything and split]
[Tegridy Farms, kitchen. The Marshes are at table, and Randy has his hands clasped in prayer, ready to say grace, while the rest of the family is mad]
RANDY
Bless us, Lord, and our little cannabis farm, and may we always keep our tegridy. Amen. [digs into his bowl first] So, how was everyone's day?
SHARON
Uh, well, not great. Uh, Stan got caught with a vaping pen.
RANDY
[drops his bowl onto the table and raises his voice, losing his southern accent again] With a WHAT?!
SHARON
You know, those little pen and cartridge things with the mist?
RANDY
Stan had a vape pen?! [to Stan] You had a fucking vaping-?! Get up to your room right now! [Stan gets off his chair and leaves. Randy leans in towards Sharon] Way to underreact, Sharon! [leaves the table and walks to Stan's room]
[Tegridy Farms, Stan's room. Stan sits on his bed while Randy walks in and slams the door shut. He then walks up to the bed.]
RANDY
[holding a vape pen in his hand] Where did you get this?!
STAN
It's not mine. I took it from a kindergartner.
RANDY
Yeah, right! My own son using a pussy stick! [brings up his southern accent again] Don't you know what these things are doin' to our way of life?! I've had enough!
STAN
What are you gonna do?
RANDY
You think I'm just gonna stand around while they destroy my family?! We've worked this farm and this land for over four days! I'm not about to let some vape queens take it all away from us! [walks out and slams the door shut]
[Mr. Mackey's house, day. Kyle knocks at his door.]
MR. MACKEY
[opens the door] Oh, hello, Kyle.
KYLE
Mr. Mackey, I need to talk to you about some things going on at school.
MR. MACKEY
M'okay, like what?
CARTMAN
[on the sofa, leans forward] Oh, hi Kyle.
BUTTERS
[on the other sofa, leans to his right into view] Hey Kyle! [Kyle is rendered speechless. Cartman and Butters go to the door and stand on either side of Mr. Mackey.]
CARTMAN
We were just talking to the counselor about some college opportunities. What are you doing here?
KYLE
You know what I'm doing here!
CARTMAN
Okay, well, we really should talk first, Kyle.
KYLE
NO. Mr. Mackey, there's a big operation going on at the school
CARTMAN
Kyle, things have changed. You need to listen.
KYLE
Things are getting out of control-
CARTMAN
Kyle, listen! You want to hear this!
KYLE
-and you need to know what's going on!
CARTMAN
You need to hear this!
KYLE
What?!
CARTMAN
We'lll be right back, Mr. Mackey. [takes Kyle by the hand and leaves with Butters and Kyle]
MR. MACKEY
Huh okay. [closes the door]
[On the sidewalk between two houses]
KYLE
Let go of me! [Cartman lets go]
CARTMAN
Kyle, listen. It's bad.
KYLE
What's bad?!
CARTMAN
The guy we tried to frame at the vape shop. He was the one the sixth graders got their shit from. The sixth graders are pissed at us, Kyle! We have to break into the vape shop and steal enough stuff to make the sixth graders happy.
KYLE
You guys decided to beat up the dealer!
CARTMAN
Yeah, but the sixth graders know you were there!
KYLE
How?!
BUTTERS
'Cause Eric told them!
KYLE
We are all in this together, Kyle! We gotta rob the vape shop, and then we can put this all behind us.
BUTTERS
Please, Kyle! We still gotta pay people off!
VAPING MAN
[breaks through the wooden fence behind the boys] Oh yeah! Hey bitches! Where's my motherfuckin' money?!
BUTTERS
Run!
CARTMAN
Aah!
KYLE
Aah!
[Tegridy Farms, day. Robert Tepper - No Easy Way Out plays. Randy checks himself out on the mirror in the barn. He puts on the farm's logo shirt. He gets some hemp tape and wraps it around his hands, takes a swig of Tegridy Farms hemp milk, then gets into a fighting stance. He then puts on the hat he made for Stan and "Two Princes" plays again. He leaves the house ready to fight, and Sharon follows him out. She puts her fists on her hips]
ROBERT TEPPER
We're not indestructible
Baby, better get that straight.
I think that its unbelievable
How you give in to the hands of fate --
SPIN DOCTORS
One, two
princes kneel before you
That's what I said now
SHARON
Randy, where are you going?
RANDY
[turns around] Gonna go fight for my children's future. [walks away]
[Big Vape, night. Loud rock music can be heard outside the building. Randy drives up to it on his tractor and turns the engine off. Randy barges in, and the music and chatter stop]
RANDY
All right, you bunch of vape-smoking' pussies! You try and take my way of life?! Time to show you some tegridy! ["No Way Out" begins to play]
PATRON
Tegridy? What's tegridy? [Randy begins punching his way through the shop as "Two Princes" plays again and then mixes in with "No Easy Way Out". "Hyeah! Ow! Ouch! Hey! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Owie!"]
SPIN DOCTORS/ROBERT TEPPER
That's what I said now
One, two --
There's no easy way out
That's what I said now
One, two --
There's no shortcut home
That's what I said now
One, two --
There's no easy way out
That's what I said now
One, two --
Givin' in can't be wrong
That's what I said now
One, two --
There's no easy way out
RANDY
[punches through a man] Get your stupid mist out of my fucking face!
BODYBUILDER
Hey! I like to vape. You think I'm a pussy?
RANDY
Yup! [takes him down in two blows]
BODYBUILDER
Ow! [Randy goes upstairs]
[Big Vape attic. The boys are walking among the tanks used for storing the vapors. They stop at one and begin to siphon off the liquid from the tank into a five-gallon jug]
BUTTERS
Wow! You're so smart to think of a siphon, Kyle!
KYLE
Just shut up and keep pumping!
VAPE REP
What are you kids doing?
KYLE
Awww, shit!
VAPE REP
You little hoodlums break in through the window?! I oughtta break your little legs!
RANDY
[appears behind him] I don't think so!
KYLE
Mr. Marsh!
RANDY
Just what the Sam Hell you boys doin' here?!
KYLE
All right, listen. I should have talked to an adult from the beginning.
CARTMAN
Kyle, what are you doing?
KYLE
There are these three vaping syndicates at our school-
CARTMAN
Kyle?
KYLE
-and these guys are one of them.
CARTMAN
Nononononono.
KYLE
They had someone buying stuff from here for them, and then they sold it to kids.
CARTMAN
Okay, Kyle, I'm calling Ronan Farrow. [takes out his phone and pretends to talk to Farrow]
KYLE
The sixth graders, these guys, and Becky Thompson are all at each other for control of the playground.
CARTMAN
Hello, Ronan? Eric Cartman. Yeah, hey.
KYLE
I was going to tell an adult, but these guys said they'd stop.
CARTMAN
So you know Kyle? Yeah, well, you're right about him.
RANDY
It's good you came clean, son. It shows that you've got- [the vape rep punches Randy across the face, then continues punching him]
VAPE REP
Didn't your mommy teach you it doesn't pay to mess with progress?!
RANDY
Yeah. She taught me somethin' else too! If you're gonna fight for your tegridy, don't forget to bring a towel.
TOWELIE
Vape on this, bitch! [jumps off Randy and wraps himself tightly around the vape rep's head. The vape rep's screams are muffled.]
RANDY
Yeah! [punches the vape rep across the attic] Take that, stupid vaping! [delivers a knee to the vape rep, sending him into the Tropical Passion tank, making it hiss and squeak. Randy opens the valve, and does the same to the other tanks, sending them all into high pressure.] Move it boys! Come on, go go go! [follows them out the door, but stops first and turns around. He rolls a joint and smokes it, then tosses it into the vape mist. The tanks explode one by one, making the patrons run outside and away from the shop. The explosions eventually blow out the windows. Randy and the boys are the last to leave, so they turn around and watch the destruction.]
BUTTERS
Does this mean we're out of the vaping business, fellas?
[Tegridy Farms, sunrise. A guitar starts to slowly play in the background, while Randy drives his tractor with Stan and Towelie riding along.]
RANDY
It's in you.
It's in me.
A little somethin' called tegridy.
RANDY
[turns off the tractor and stands up] Well, shit. Looks like we made it to another sunrise.
STAN
Oh God, this is just gonna get worse, isn't it?
RANDY
Yup son. I think the fight's just startin'. Farmers like us are under attack.
TOWELIE
Yupper. We got a lot of work to do. We can't let 'em take what makes us special.
[A jar of Tegridy Farms marijuana appears at the center of the screen as a voice-over begins to speak]
VOICE-OVER
Tegridy Weed, from Tegridy Farms. Made... with a little Colorado tegridy. Comin' soon to a dispensary near you.

synopsis:It's every boy and girl for themselves this year when the kids head out for tricks or treats. This year, a revolution in mobility is changing Halloween for everyone. Chaos erupts as every kid is out to get more candy than they have ever gotten before. Mr. Mackey and the rest of the adults ate hording emergency supplies and hoping to survive until morning.

script:The Scoots

[An October afternoon in South Park. An adult narrates this story. We learn quickly that it is Kenny narrating.]
ADULT KENNY
October was always my favorite month. [Stan and Kyle toss a football to each other. Two boys run past them with a kite] It was always that misty season when everyone embraced the weird and scary. [people are shown decorating their houses for the day.] Our little town was no different. [Stephen and Linda decorate their home for Halloween] I was just a kid back then. [Dr. Spooky's Pumpkin Patch is shown, with kids purchasing their own pumpkins] Me and all the other children were preparing for the greatest night of the year. [Mr. Mackey walks out with a couple of trash bags] But this Halloween was different, and it would change us all... forever.
MR. MACKEY
Whoa! [trips over something and falls down] What the? [the something is an electric scooter someone left in front of his house. He stands up with his bags] Alright, who left their scooter here?! Okay?! Whose damn scooter is this?!
NEIGHBOR
[across the street] It isn't anybody's. They're e-scooters. Anyone can use them.
MACKEY
E-scooters?
NEIGHBOR
Yeah, see? There's a bunch here and a bunch more down there. [points to his right, Mackey's left. Mackey looks and sees them on both sides of the street, standing on the sidewalk. Another neighbor trips over one on his way across the street.] Everyone can use them to get around town, you know? Leave them where they want for the next person.
MACKEY
Well where the hell do they all come from?!
NEIGHBOR
[flatly] Nobody knows. [Mackey is dumbfounded]
[A sidewalk near the park. The boys stand around an e-scooter]
STAN
So anyone can use them?
CARTMAN
Yeah, I think they just work with your cell phone.
KYLE
How?
STAN
Oh yeah, it has one of them little scan thingies. Let me see. [puts up his phone camera to the e-scooter, which scans the code on the e-scooter. A little ding is heard] Yeah, dude, it's downloading the app.
CARTMAN
Kewl!
STAN
Aww, it wants a credit card number.
CARTMAN
Do you wanna use your mom's or my mom's?
STAN
Let's do your mom's
CARTMAN
3715 ...[Stan taps it into the app] 523 ...
STAN
Is that an AmEx?
CARTMAN
Yeah, you want a visa? 8292 438 7766507
STAN
Espiration?
CARTMAN
45261
STAN
Security code?
CARTMAN
[without hesitation] 921 [two beeps follow, and the boys are good to go]
KYLE
Dude, it worked! [Stan puts his phone away and hops on the e-scooter, then begins riding it]
CARTMAN
How is it, dude?
STAN
Pretty stupid but sweet.
KYLE
[turns around] Oh my God. Dude. Oh my God.
CARTMAN
What?
KYLE
We should use these things to trick or treat on Halloween!
CARTMAN
Hey yeah! We could cover so much more ground!
STAN
[returns and stops] We'd get, like, more candy than anybody.
KYLE
Everybody get the app! This is gonna be the best Halloween ever! [he and Cartman whip out their phones and get the app. Kenny has nothing to do.]
KENNY
(Oh wait, you guys. See, I don't have a phone.)
CARTMAN
Oh yeah, Kenny doesn't have a phone 'cause he's poor.
KYLE
Oh. Well, that's okay. We'll figure it out. We always do!
ALL
[raising fists] All right!
[Downtown South Park. Mr. Mackey parks in front of Tom's Rhinoplasty, gets out, and parks his car. He goes to Lolly's Candy Factory next door and notices the six e-scooters parked in front of it.]
MACKEY
[spooked] What the... what the... fuck is going on? [goes inside the store, keeping his eyes on the e-scooters]
LOLLY
How can I help you?
MACKEY
Well I'm just gettin' my Halloween candy. Want to make sure I get enough. Last year I ran out and the kids egged my house, m'kay?
LOLLY
Yeah, you don't wanna run out of candy on Halloween.
MACKEY
I'll take three large bags each of Snickers Fun Size, Payday Bite Size, Almand Joy Snack Size, and Reese's Teenie Weenie Size, m'kay?
LOLLY
Sounds like you wanna be prepared. [opens a large shopping bag for him and begins packing the bags inside]
MACKEY
Hey, c-can, can I ask you somethin'? Wha, what's up with all these damn scooters?
LOLLY
Oh, I think you get an app on your phone and you can use them all over town.
MACKEY
No, but like, where did they come from? You know, it's like one day everything was fine, and the next there were these fuckin' scooters everywhere. [hands Lolly his AmEx card.]
LOLLY
You don't like scooters? [takes the card and places the charge on it]
MACKEY
I just think people should drive, m'kay? I don't think people should "scoot." I just... I just hope the future isn't "scootin'."
LOLLY
Well, they seem pretty convenient. [gives him back his card and the filled shopping bag] What can be so wrong about that? Happy Halloween. [Mackey leaves and finds... 20 scooters there where there were originally six. He hurries to his car]
[The Halloween Outlet, day. Everyone is in there getting their costumes, Kenny walks out with a traditional pumpkin pail]
KENNY
(Woohoo!) [runs to Cartman's house] (Hey dude, check it out! I got my pail!)
CARTMAN
Great, cool. You got your pail.
KENNY
(Yup!)
CARTMAN
Come on in, Kenny. Let's talk. [Kenny walks in, looks around, and ends up looking at Stan and Kyle. Cartman follows him] Go ahead. Take a seat, Ken. [Kenny sits on the sofa next to Kyle, Cartman sits next to him.] Okay Kenny, here's the deal. Um, you know that we have this awesome plan to trick-or-treat on e-scooters this year. YOU... don't have a phone.
KYLE
Kenny, we've been talking and, the truth is, without a scooter, you're just gonna slow us down.
CARTMAN
It's probably best you trick or treat with someone else this year.
KENNY
(But we always trick or treat together)
STAN
Yeah, but that's just it, Kenny. To use a scooter, you have to have a phone and... I mean, if we're waiting for you, we're gonna be as slow as all the other kids. It's... like, you know?
KENNY
(Guys, please.)
CARTMAN
Look, Kenny, I always told you that one day, being poor was gonna catch up with you. Okay? But you didn't wanna listen. You just kept on being poor, and now it's Halloween and you don't have a cell phone.
KYLE
Okay, okay. Cartman, that's not the point.
CARTMAN
He needs to hear this, Kyle. You know, people are just poor, and they think it's not gonna come back to bite them in the ass.
KYLE
That's enough, dude!
STAN
We're sorry, Kenny. It's just... This awesome plan to get shitloads of candy doesn't... work with... you. [Kenny looks around and reads the mood, then takes his pail and leaves the house]
CARTMAN
Shouldn't have been poor, Kenny.
[Downtown South Park. Mr. Mackey is driving in his car and singing.]
MACKEY
There was a wee cooper what lived in Fife. Nickety, Nackety noo noonoo
Hey Willy Wallacky, hey John Dougal. Alane quo roshety roo rooroo
[Notices someone outside his window. It's a scooter rider sipping coffee from Starbucks and carrying a shoulder bag across his body. He begins to notice other riders, but this distracts him from the road ahead.] Whoa, shit! M'kay?! [he's at an intersection when another rider casually scoots in front of him on the crosswalk. He brakes hard, looks out his window and yells] Hey you had a goddamned red light!
RIDER 1
[long gone] Sorry.
MACKEY
[sighing] Whoa, Jesus Christ. [another rider runs into the car] Hey!
RIDER 2
[pulls his scooter off the car] Sorry.
MACKEY
What the hell?! [the rider pulls the scooter off the car and rides away] Look at my car! Who's gonna pay for- [another rider runs into the car on the passenger side]
RIDER 3
Sorry dude. [pulls the scooter off the car and rides away]
MACKEY
God damn it! Get off the goddamned street with those things! [begins to peel away when he encounters traffic going against him, consisting of nothing but scooter riders. He dodges them as best he can. He ends up bumping a few off.]
RIDER 4
Sorry.
RIDER 5
[lands on the hood of the car, then gets off some seconds later] Sorry bro.
RIDER 6
[lands on the trunk of the car, then gets off some seconds later] Sorry, dude.
MACKEY
Woh, fuck me!
[Clyde's house, afternoon. Clyde is seated with Tolkien, Jimmy, and Butters. discussing their plan for Halloween over a map of the town.]
CLYDE
As soon as the school bell rings, we find the nearest scooters and begin trick or treating in Butters' neighborhood here. Then at 3 p.m. we- [the doorbell rings]
JIMMY
Sh sh-sh-sh-sh Shi sh-shi shit.
CLYDE
Cover it! Cover it! [he and Jimmy pull out a blanket and throw it over the map. Tolkien and Butters's help cover it up. Clyde goes to open the door and sees Kenny there.] Oh. Hey Kenny.
KENNY
(Hey dude. Uh, look. I was wondering, do you think I could trick or treat with you guys this year?)
CLYDE
You wanna trick or treat with us? What about Stan and Kyle and those guys?
KENNY
(Oh, you know, I just thought I'd switch it up this year, hehe)
CLYDE
Yeah, look, don't tell anybody, but, um... we're gonna trick or treat on e-scooters this year. We're seriously gonna rake in the candy. Problem is, e-scooters work with a phone and pretty sure [slowly] you don't h-have one
KENNY
(Oh I won't slow you guys down. I swear!)
CLYDE
Dude, it's trick or treat. It's not something we're just willing to mess around with, okay? [backs up and closes the door, then lowers his head in sadness]
[Nighttime. For envelops the town while the moon shines overhead. Mr. Mackey's shadow pops out from behind a tree and looks around, then he sneaks into an alley. He begins pulling up scooters and tossing them into a Bargain Rentals pickup truck. he wades into the river and crosses it to the other side, then removes the scooters from that side of town. He tosses them onto the truck as well. He then chains a bunch of them together and scoots them down the street to the truck. He tosses them onto the growing pile and drives out of town. He drives them onto a high cliff and parks at the edge, then throws out the whole mass of scooters, kicking out any remaining ones. He then drives off the cliff and goes home to sleep. His phone beeps, waking him. He rubs his eyes and puts on his glasses, then is surprised to see a scooter in his room by the bed.]
MR. MACKEY
What the hell?? [walks backward into the bathroom, then turns around to find two more scooters by the toilet.] Aaaah! [Spooked, he goes downstairs when he hears someone run into the front door.]
RIDER 7
Agh! [Mackey opens the door to see the rider dust himself off] Sorry, dude.
MACKEY
God damnit, where'd you get that?!
RIDER 7
Oh, they're all over, dude. Super-convenient. Try it out. [scoots away. Mr. Mackey walks to the street and sees even more of them than he threw out the night before.]
[The school cafeteria, day. Bebe and Wendy sit at the table with four other girls. Kenny walks up to their table and sits between two of the girls.]
KENNY
(Hey guys!) [silence. He chuckles and says] (So listen, I was thinking, maybe I'd trick or treat with you guys this year!)
WENDY
You wanna trick or treat with us? Why?
KENNY
(Oh, you know! Just trying to be gender-neutral, hahahaha!)
[At another table, Cartman sits with Stan, Kyle, Tolkien, Jimmy, Clyde, and Butters]
CARTMAN
So, uh, you guys think you're gonna get a lot of candy trick or treating this year?
BUTTERS
We're gonna get a butt-load of candy!
TOLKIEN
Shh! Butters, don't tell them our secret!
CARTMAN
Oh, we have a little secret too!
STAN
But we're not gonna tell people 'cause they're gonna copy us. So let's just leave it at that.
CLYDE
Fine by us. So what are you gonna be for Halloween?
CARTMAN
Be? I'm gonna be on an e-scooter taking all your candy! [Stan and Kyle flash angry looks at him] That's what I'm gonna be!
KYLE
Dude!
CARTMAN
Sorry!
JIMMY
Hey wait! That's what we're doing!
STAN
What?
CRAIG
Hold on! You guys are using e-scooters on Halloween too?
WENDY
Oh, you jerks found out the girls are all trick or treating on e-scooters, and you stole our idea!
CARTMAN
Okay. Hold on! This is bullcrap! [all the kids begin arguing, destroying any chance Kenny had of enjoying a peaceful dinner. He walks away, head down.]
[South Park Community Center. Adult Kenny resumes the story.]
ADULT KENNY
It was the day before Halloween. All of our parents were gathered together to try and stop a nightmare from coming true.
SGT. YATES
[at the podium] All right, everyone. Quiet, please. We have a community crisis on our hands, and it's my job to keep you informed. As you know, there's been a rise in the use of e-scooters in our town. Officer Brown is head of crisis control. Officer?
OFFICER BROWN
We have inside information that kids everywhere are going to be using e-scooters for tricks or treats. Now, with these things, kids and teens can cover a lot of ground in very little time. They can hit more houses than ever before. Because of the scooters, we also expect that people from all the neighboring counties will commute for tricks or treats in our town. Because of all of this, we believe each household needs to be prepared... with at least $6,000 worth of candy.
JIMBO
$6,000?
STEPHEN
Well that's ridiculous! We, we can't all buy that much candy! Let's just get rid of those scooters!
TOWNSFOLK
Yeah! That's right! Let's do it!
MACKEY
[stands up] You can't get rid of them! I tried! You all just sat there while those things piled up on our sidewalks! You all rode 'em around, m'kay?! I saw you! You could have used your cars, but you just had to scoot! [makes his way to the podium] And now tricks or treats is here! Well I'll tell you one thing! I'm not gonna let my house get egged this year for not havin' enough candy! So what are we gonna do?!
TOWNSMAN
We gotta get more candy! [after a moment of silence, everyone scrambles out the door with a sense of urgency. Mackey joins them]
[Downtown South Park, evening. Mr. Mackey drives up in his car and screeches to a halt in front of Tom's Rhinoplasty. He leaves his car and locks it, then runs into Lolly's Candy Factory next door to get whatever candy he can just as everyone else runs out of there.]
MACKEY
Get-whoa-get out of the way! [goes inside. A female customer leaves with the last of the goodies]
LOLLY
Look, I got nothin' left, all right?
MACKEY
What did you-? Get me some of those Hi-Chews.
LOLLY
Those are already accounted for by folks who called in!
MACKEY
Well then let me, let me have the Whatchamacallits?
LOLLY
Those are for me! I've gotta protect my own house!
MACKEY
Look, you've gotta give me some more fuckin' candy! [Lolly bends over, pulls up a rifle, and aims it at Mr. Mackey]
LOLLY
There's nothin' left here. You've gotta go somewhere else! [Mr. Mackey turns and runs out]
[Food 4 Little, later. Mr. Mackey peels into a parking spot and grabs a cart as soon as he can. He runs through the store]
MACKEY
Where, where's the candy, m'kay? Candy? [stops when he sees an associate] Uhh, what aisle is the candy in?
ASSOCIATE
Uh, aisle 7.
MACKEY
[resumes running] Uh 7, aisle 7! [reaches it and turns to see empty, trashed shelves. A couple of people have fallen victim to the stampede]
[Halloween, day. A wind blows some leaves around all over town. South Park Elementary is ow crowded with e-scooters up front. The kids are dressed up for Halloween and look around at each other warily, ready to be the first one out the classroom door as soon as the bell rings. Butters too looks around warily, but all of a sudden brightens up. He looks at the clock on the wall. Meanwhile, Kenny walks to Mr. Mackey's office, sighs, and knocks on the door.]
MACKEY
[divvies up the candy so every kid gets the same amount and composition] Twenty Reese's Pieces, one Twix, sixteen Raisinets. [Kenny knocks again] Just... just a minute! Twelve Hat Tamles, half a Nestle Crun- [Kenny knocks again] Okay, come in! [Kenny finally walks in and closes the door, then takes a seat] What you want?
KENNY
(I, I just... It's Halloween and I should be happy, but I'm not happy at all.)
MACKEY
Wait. Are you here for counseling?
KENNY
(Yeah! What should I do? I'm gonna miss trick-or-treating. It sucks.)
MACKEY
Do you realize it's about to be World War III out there?! We have bigger problems! Consider yourself lucky, M'kay?! Everyone's gonna be scootin' and there's no way to stop it. Why are you the one kid who doesn't want to use them?
KENNY
(I can't use one. I don't have a phone.)
MACKEY
What do you mean? You can't use those things without a phone?
KENNY
(No. It sucks. Halloween was a night without phones, man.)
MACKEY
But Kenny, if that's true, then... could there be a way to cut the connection?
KENNY
(I don't know. I guess if you-) [snaps his fingers] (Wait a minute. Take down the cell phone tower. Then nobody has a phone on Halloween!)
MACKEY
Jesus! You really think that could work?!
KENNY
(Yeah! I just have to ride thirty minutes outside of town! Oh, wait. I can't. I don't have a scooter.)
MACKEY
[voice trembling] No. You don't need a scooter, 'cause I got a fuckin' car. [Kenny gets pumped]
[Tegridy Farms, day. Stephen and Linda drive up and park. Randy opens the front door to greet them]
RANDY
Yehello?
STEPHEN
Heh hey Randy. Linda and I, we... we were talkin' about how we never see you guys anymore, and we were thinking we'd hang out with you for Halloween, heh.
RANDY
Oh, I see. You want a place to hide on Halloween night, and you thought out here on the farm you'd be safe.
STEPHEN
Well, that, and we really wanna hang with you guys.
LINDA
[giggles nervously] Yes.
RANDY
You think them fancy e-scooters don't make it out here? We're gonna be bombarded just like you city folk.
STEPHEN
Then please, Randy, can we just borrow a little candy?
RANDY
I gotta keep what I have.
STEPHEN
Please, Randy, the stores are all out! Just a few Milky Ways to get us through the first couple hours, please! We can cut 'em up. We can- we can hand them out little pieces at a time.
RANDY
[steps backward up the porch steps] I gotta protect my own, Stotch! I'm sorry. [turns and walks inside]
[In the car, moments later.]
LINDA
[in a panic] What are we gonna do??
STEPHEN
It's okay, Linda! It's okay! On Halloween night, I'll... I'll just one of those e-scooters myself. I'll go around and, and I'll trick-or-treat. I'll... I'll get a bunch of-
LINDA
[grabs his right hand] No, you can't leave me alone!
STEPHEN
[grabs her shoulders] I'll get a bunch of candy, Linda, and I'll bring it back to our house for us to hand out! It's going to be okay.
[South Park Elementary. The school bell rings and the kids flood out to get at the e-scooters. Clyde gets on a scooter, but Kyle pulls him off and takes it. Butters runs for a scooter, but Cartman catches up to him and punches him away. The kids fan out around town. Gerald is at his front door dishing out candy as fast as possible]
GERALD
Aah! Aaaah! Here! Here, take it! Just take it!
RICHARD
[Dishes out candies to the trick-or-treaters in a panic] OH GOD! WE NEED MORE THREEM MUSKETEERS! WE CAN'T BE OUT! THERE HAS TO BE MORE!!
KYLE
[comes into view with Cartman and Stan] Jesus Christ! Where'd all these other people come from?!
CARTMAN
We have to get more candy than anyone else, even if we die!
[The road to South Park, night. The sign for Mr. Hankey's Holiday Pageant now has CANCELLED spray-painted on it. Kids and teens from out of town begin streaming in. Again, Mr. Mackey has to avoid the oncoming riders, but Kenny is with him now.]
MACKEY
The tower should be just over that ridge.
KENNY
(Let's just hope to hell this works.)
RIDER 8
[a woman they bump off] Oof, Sorry.
MACKEY
What gives them the right, huh? I mean, some big company came and dumped a bunch of scooters everywhere without asking anyone if it was okay.
KENNY
(Yeah, people don't even care if shit's dumped everywhere. Everyone just loves technology)
MACKEY
Yeah, you're right. You're a good kid, Kenny. I always thought so. I know we kind of all forget about you sometimes, but you're smart, compassionate, and you might even make a good counselor someday. [looks ahead again, but bumps into another rider]
RIDER 9
Sorry, dude.
[Jimbo and Ned's house, night. The trick-or-treaters swarm outside the house while Jimbo and Ned dish out the candy]
JIMBO
Keep going, Ned! Don't you give up on me!
STEPHEN
[scoots up to them, pushing people out of the way] Move it! Get out of my way! [holdds up his pail] Trick or treat!
JIMBO
The hell are you doing, Stotch?
STEPHEN
Happy Halloween! Trick or Treat!
JIMBO
You're just trying to get our candy for your house!
STEPHEN
That's not true!
JIMBO
You don't even have a costume!
STEPHEN
Yes I do! I'm Megyn Kelly! Now trick or treat!
[The neighborhood streets, night. The boys have done so well that their bags are bulging with candy]
KYLE
That's it! I can't go anymore!
CARTMAN
Keep moving, Kyle!
STAN
Dude, we can't carry any more candy!
CARTMAN
All right, over here. Come on!
KYLE
What are we doing?
CARTMAN
We've gotta make room for more candy. Come on. Eat as much as you can. [they open their bags and start shoveling candy into their mouths, eating as much as they can]
KYLE
I don't... I don't know how I can keep doing this.
CARTMAN
Yes you can, Kyle.
STAN
I can't any more. [throws up into his bag]
[A half hour out of town, night. Mr. Mackey and Kenny drive towards a wireless cell tower guarded by a chain-link fence]
KENNY
(Find a way inside. I'll climb the tower.)
MACKEY
Okay, sounds good! [they're confronted by a security guard in costume]
KENNY
(Oh, fuck!) [the guard is dressed as Jason Voorhees]
MACKEY
Jesus Christ! [slashing sounds are heard. The guard removes his mask]
GUARD
I'm all out of candy, all right?! Go look somewhere else!
MACKEY
We're not here for tricks or treats!
GUARD
Yeah, sure! That's what the last people said! Then they dumped my entire bowl in a pillowcase!
KENNY
(Dude, relax. It's okay.)
GUARD
I'm just a security guard, all right?! [slides the mask back down over his face] We never even used to have trick-or-treaters out this far!
MACKEY
That's why he has to take down this cellphone tower: To stop the scooters! Jason, I'm a counselor. You need to trust me. [the guard tilts his head to the right]
[The trick-or-treaters swarm outside the police station and pound on its walls. Police officers inside the station stay low and armed. One of them covers his ears]
YATES
There's a bowl of Rice Krispie treats at the side door! The side door, you animals!
OFFICER
Detective, look!
[A TV is seen from their location, showing a newscast from New York. Times Square is torn to shreds, with glass panels littering the ground]
REPORTER
We are two hours ahead here! New York has completely run out of candy! [static ruins the image and the TV goes dark]
[The neighborhood streets, moments later. Trick-or-treating continues]
JIMMY
Butters? We've lost Butters!
TOLKIEN
Oh God, Butters! [Butters is lying down next to a gutter munching on his cache of candy]
[Tegridy Farms, night. Sharon and Randy stand on the porch looking out at the fields. A swarm of kids is in the distance]
SHARON
We're never goin' to have enough candy.
[The cellphone tower, later. Kenny goes up the steps to the top, hauling a chain. He then throws the chain around the top and catches it, tying it onto itself]
KENNY
(Okay, that's got it!)
MACKEY
All right, Kenny! [to no one] Let's see you do THIS with a goddamned scooter! [turns the ignition on, revs up the car, and begins to drive away, pulling the tower down. Kenny hides behind some panels on the way down]
[The town, moments later. The scooters begin to power down and the riders stop moving. The excitement dies down.]
[Tegridy Farms, moments later. The scooters begin to power down and the riders stop moving just before reaching the porch. The excitement dies down.]
ADULT KENNY
And just like that, it was over. Nobody knew what happened. They only knew their phones didn't work.
CLYDE
Does anyone have a signal?
ADULT KENNY
No scooters, no texting, not even GPS. It was like the old Halloween. [with no way to move around on them, the riders just drop the scooters and walk away]
RIDER 10
And I can't get an Uber home!
ADULT KENNY
Mr. Mackey was able to get back to the town and offer counseling to everyone who needed it. [Kenny walks into view, wearing a costume] And as for me? I was able to spend the rest of the night with my friends, because we were all equal again.
THE BOYS
[approach a house and ring the doorbell] Trick or treat.
KENNY
[brightly] (Trick or treat!)
ADULT KENNY
It was the last Halloween that still felt like Halloween. It was the last time... it was good. [a scooter suddenly props itself up and scoots away]
End of The Scoots


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The citizens of South Park have no idea the danger they're in. When dead citizens start popping up all over town, the boys realize they need Al Gore's help. The boys are willing to do almost anything to save the town, and themselves, but it may be just too late.

script:Time To Get Cereal

[A meadow near town, day. A small bird chirps on a blade of grass when suddenly, it's shot to pieces. The camera pans left and we see Jimbo and Ned in the distance, Ned holding the rifle that shot the bird]
JIMBO
Yeah-heah! You got it, Ned! That was a nice shot!
NED
Mn-thanks. I thought so too.
JIMBO
Come on, let's see what we got. [they walk to the bird's location and look down] Huh. Looks like you shot the shit out of it. There's nothin' left. [looks to his left] Hey. Lookie here. Jesus. You ever seen animal tracks that big? [the hoof prints of a large animal are shown - pig on the left, bear on the right]
NED
Mmm-no I have not, Jimbo.
JIMBO
Looks like a bear. A huge one! Come on, the tracks go this way. [they walk away, then stop] Look at that. Looks like bear droppings. But with a man poop right next to it.
NED
I'm scared. [they move forward]
JIMBO
What the hell are we dealing with, Ned? Whatever it is, it was heard recently. [they walk through some hemp plants]
[They've made their way to Tegridy Farms. Randy and Stan are on the porch]
RANDY
Hey! [Jimbo and Ned look up] What the hell are you guys doin' on my farm?
JIMBO
We're trackin' a bear, Randy.
RANDY
A bear? [a growling squeal is heard, Everyone looks around] That didn't sound like no bear. [Ned begins to run away]
JIMBO
Where're you goin' Ned?
NED
Mmm-I'm getting my white ass outta here. [stops. Manbearpig rises out of the field and squeal-growls at him]
STAN
What the fuck?!
JIMBO
Jesus Christ! [fumbles to aim his gun at ManBearPig and finally gets a shot out. Ned runs away, and ManBearPig gives chase.] Whoa!
NED
[slowly while running] Help me! [ManBearPig catches up to him and mauls him, then carries him away in its mouth.]
JIMBO
NNEEEEDDDD!!
[Park County Police Station, day. Officers arrive to work.]
YATES
All right. We have some dead cows down at Milner's Ranch. I want Conners and Tiggs to check that out. And the two hikers are still missing. Let's have all units keep their ears to the ground. [tidies up his papers] All right, ladies, that's it. Second shift starts now. As for me, I'm finally heading home.
OFFICER 1
Gonna finally get some R&R, sir?
YATES
Yep. Gonna go home and play me some Red Dead Redemption 2. I got a train to rob in Valentine.
OFFICER 2
Detective! Got a call from the school. Another kid's been killed.
YATES
No, no not another school shooting! Can't they handle it themselves?
OFFICER 2
Said they need us right away.
YATES
[makes fists] God damn it! [loosens them] Why the hell can't these kids stop being a pain in my ass? [takes off his coat and adjusts his tie]
[South Park Elementary, day. Several police cars pull up. Yates and the others get out and enter the school. Strong Woman has the students huddled up on the playground.]
STRONG WOMAN
Children, everyone, just stay back, okay? The police are coming.
YATES
[arrives with Ofc. Brown.] All right, what happened? What grade was the shooter in?
STRONG WOMAN
Oh thank God. Some kindergartners found the body. I-I don't think it was a shooting.
YATES
[takes a cigarette from a pack in his shirt pocket] Of course it's a school shooting. It's cut and dry. Let's just get this over with so I can go home. Where's the victim? [takes out a lighter and lights his cigarette]
STRONG WOMAN
Over there. [points to her left, and the officers follow with their eyes]
BROWN
What the hell? [the body they reach is a kid's body which has been ripped to shreds]
YATES
Jesus, it's a complete mauling.
OFFICER 3
[kneels to take a closer look] Looks like part of him was eaten.
YATES
[returns to the students] All right, which one of you little shitheads did this? [the student body stays silent] Come on. I don't have time for these little games. Which of you peckers felt isolated and lashed out at society? If I have to stay here and do an investigation instead of go home and rob a train, there's gonna be serious hell to pay!
[South Park Elementary hallway. Kyle is at his locker switching books. He closes the locker as Cartman and Kenny walk by, and joins them.]
KYLE
So what as he doing alone on the playground?
CARTMAN
Staci Nakabw says he just wanted to run back out and get his football.
KENNY
(What the fuckin' hell, dude?)
KYLE
And there were bear prints in the snow?
STAN
It wasn't a bear! [seen by his locker seated on the floor with his arms around his legs] I saw it. [the other boys walk up to him]
KYLE
You saw what?
STAN
It was at my house. There was a... thing. It attacked my uncle and took his friend. It was like a bear, but a pig... thing.
KYLE
Jesus.
STAN
It was at my house, and then here at the school! Everyone says that kid and I looked alike. What if that thing is after me??
CARTMAN
Dude, now you're just overreacting.
MACKEY
[over the P.A.] Attention, please. Will the following students report to the principal's office? Eric Cartman, Kenny McCormick. [both are surprised that they've been called.] Thank you, 'kay.
CARTMAN
Aww, what did I do this time?
[The principal's office, lobby. Cartman and Kenny arrive.]
CARTMAN
You go first, Kenny.
KENNY
(Fuck that, you go first!)
CARTMAN
I didn't even do anything wrong!
KENNY
(Neither did I!)
CARTMAN
Just stop being a baby, Kenny, and go! [pulls Kenny to the door]
[The principal's office, inside. Kenny goes in first, then Cartman. Yates is sitting at the desk, smoking a cigarette.]
YATES
Take a seat, boys. Right there. [the boys sit and wait as Yates lights up a cigarette and takes a loooong puff] You know how shitty it is to be a cop? [sits up] There's real emergencies every day - real people who need real help - but then, every other minute, I gotta stop everything 'cause one of you little fuckwads decides to go and shoot up the school. [Kenny says something] Shut up! now, which one of you had a beef with Colin Brooks?!
CARTMAN
Nobody gives a shit about Colin Brooks.
YATES
Oh yeah? I asked the kids in this school, "Who are the biggest loners? Who's most likely to rage and be the next school shooter?" You know what they said? The fat, ugly mean kid and the detached, loner poor kid.
CARTMAN
Hey, I'm not poor, all right?!
YATES
Or was it both of you? Fess up. I have people in Horseshoe Overlook who are depending on me to get provisions so we can head back east.
CARTMAN
You're playing Red Dead Redemption 2?
YATES
That's right. And I'm gonna make both of you school shooters pay for wasting my time. [Cartman and Kenny just look at each other]
[Kyle's room, evening. Kyle is typing away at his computer as Stan looks on.]
STAN
Keep looking. There's a lot of people saying they saw it, Kyle. It's not just me.
KYLE
"Evidence of the creature of South Park." This is like a conspiracy Web site.
STAN
It's not a conspiracy, it's real. Keep going down. There's video. [Kyle scrolls down and stops at "MAN-BEAR-PIG captured on VIDEO"] There! Right there! [Kyle clicks on it and the video expands. ManBearPig is seen running off with another victim in its jaws.] That's it. That's what I saw. [walks away from the computer] I saw ManBearPig.
KYLE
ManBearPig?
STAN
Don't you remember, dude? We were warned about this. That weirdo guy who came and told us this would happen? He was right. [Kenny and Cartman soon run in]
CARTMAN
You guys! You guys! The police are trying to say me and Kenny killed that douchebag, Colin Brooks.
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
They questioned us for hours. They said they had enough to get warrants for our arrest.
STAN
But it wasn't you guys.
CARTMAN
We know that! What the hell are we gonna do??
STAN
Who was that ex-President guy? The one who showed up and tried to convince everyone of a ManBearPig?
KENNY
(You mean Al Gore?)
KYLE
Al Gore.
[Park County Police Station, day. Yates addresses everyone in the briefing room.]
YATES
In my report, you'll see that Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick are believed to have worked together. I've issued warrants for their arrests, and this case is now in the hands of the DA. [adjusts his papers and puts them away] And I... am finally going home. Keep McCormick and Cartman in separate holding cells, and don't wait on me to book 'em. I'm gonna be playing Red Dead Redemption for the next 18 hours. [gets to the entrance door]
OFFICER 2
Detective!
YATES
Whaaat?
OFFICER 2
There's more dead kids. Out in the woods by Stark's Pond.
YATES
In the woods? There was a school shooting out in the woods? Outside of school is the one place kids are supposed to be safe.
OFFICER 2
They're saying it's really bad, sir. Need all units.
YATESS
[frustrated, sighs] God damn it! [takes off his coat] If these kids don't stop killing each other, I'm gonna shoot 'em all myself.
[Denver City Hall, day. The boys approach the receptionist.]
STAN
Hello, uh, we're looking for a government sort of guy named Al Gore?
RECEPTIONIST
Al Gore... Al Gore... Sounds familiar.
KYLE
He said he was almost President once. He came to our town once to warn us about something, [hands her a photo] and we have to find him. [the photo is revealed to be a head shot of Al Gore signed "To my Best Friends! - Al".]
RECEPTIONIST
Ohhh yeahhh. This looks like Jim Turner
KENNY
{Jim Turner?}
RECEPTIONIST
The state bowling champion five years in a row. You can always catch him practicing down at Gramercy Lanes.
[Gramercy Lanes, later. "Jim Turner" is seen getting ready to bowl.]
GORE
Focus. Calm. Center. [bowls. The ball takes out 9 of 10 pins] Yes! Die! Die, you pins! Oh, we've got a straggler, do we? You're gonna die just like the rest of 'em.
STAN
Mr. Gore?
GORE
Focus. Calm.
STAN
Al Gore?
GORE
[faces them] That's a name I haven't heard in a long time.
STAN
I don't know if you remember us, but we're the kids you got to help try and capture ManBearPig? Well uh, eh eh, you were right. Ha, you, you were totally right. ManBearPig is real and, uh, he's killing lots of people in our town.
GORE
Oh. Sucks for you. [turns around and gets the spare.]
KYLE
Please, Mr. Gore! We need your help! ManBearPig isn't going to stop!
GORE
[gets a new ball and holds it] Oh, is it inconvenient now? I tried to warn you all, but no one took me cereal. You all just made fun of me, didn't you? Well, now you can just deal with it yourselves.
KYLE
Please, just tell us. How do you stop it?
GORE
You stop it all those years ago when I freaking warned you and you still had time!
STAN
There has to be something we can still do. Please, Mr. Gore. You're the only person who knows anything about it.
GORE
Say you're sorry for making fun of me.
STAN
We, didn't, we didn't realize there were more than-
GORE
Say you're sorry for making fun of me.
CARTMAN
[sincerely] We're sorry for making fun of you.
GORE
That... didn't sound cereal at all. [turns and bowls a strike]
[Red Lobster, day. A family is seated at a booth. The mother and son sit against a wall while the father sits on the open side.]
HUSBAND
You can't just go along with what people are saying, Susan. Okay? There's no scientific proof, no real evidence of a Manbearpig.
SUSAN
Well, there's a lot of smart people saying ManBearPig is real.
HUSBAND
Yeah, and a lot of smarter people saying saying it isn't. Okay? What you need to understand, Susan, is that everyone has an agenda. Everyone wants to use the fear of a Manbearpig to get what they want. [ManBearPig breaks through the windows and begins killing diners left and right] So they throw around bad science, bad taxidermy. People comin' out of the woodwork are now experts on the subject. [ManBearPig grabs a blond diner by the head and slams him to the ground, grabs a female diner and decapitates her with a single bite, grabs another diner and kills him] But you have to use your own brain, sweetheart. You can't just let people tell you that if you don't believe in ManBearPig, then you don't care about the world.
SUSAN
It is real!
HUSBAND
You wanna believe it's real? You go right on ahead, Susan.
SUSAN
No, it's right there! It's right there behind you! [The father looks over his shoulder and sees ManBearPig grab another blond diner and rip his skull and spine from the rest of his body. Susan is terrified and screams]
HUSBAND
Okay, ManBearPig is real. [ManBearPig grabs another diner and bites him in the torso, tosses him around, and spits him out] What are we gonna do about it now, huh? [ManBearPig grabs another diner and tears him in two] What are we gonna do that's gonna make any difference now, Susan?
SUSAN
[grabs their son and shakes her head in disbelief] What?! We have to do something!
HUSBAND
What can we do that everyone else will also do, Susan? [ManBearPig grabs a female diner and slams her into a pillar] Come on, use your brain. Even if we do something about it, what about the Chinese? [ManBearPig takes yet another dinner and slams him into the booth behind the family's] They're just gonna keep right on- Aaaghghg! [ManBearPig grabs the father and crushes his skull in its jaws, killing him]
[Olive Garden, day. There's singing going on in there.]
BOYS
[singing to Al Gore, who's wearing a Special Boy crown]
For he's a jolly good fellow.
For he's a jolly good fellow.
For he's a jolly good fellow.
That should 've been President.
GORE
Aw, thanks, guys! You shouldn't have!
CARTMAN
You told us to. [Stan elbows him] Ngh!
GORE
What did you guys get me? [opens the first gift] Oh wow. Look! [a small framed picture] It's a "You were right about ManBearPig" signed picture. [the picture does say that, with the four boys signing it at the bottom]
KYLE
So, ahum, now maybe we can all work together, huh?
GORE
Hang on! [claps and sings] It's movie time! Go go! Start it up. [Kenny goes to start the projector] This is the best party ever. Oh, look, guys. It's me! There I am, campaigning to be President. [Al Gore talking to a crowd during his presidential campaign in 2000] That's me with Hillary! [An older looking Gore standing with Hillary Clinton at a rally during her presidential campaign in 2016] There's more of me on the campaign trail,[Al and his wife shaking hands with people outside during his campaign in 2000] so full of dreams! Oh, look! It's me when I found out I lost the election! [he and George W. Bush stand outside by the White House after the 2000 presidential election] Boo! [the boys have lost interest and their eyes are half closed] But then look! There's me getting an Academy Award! [Gore standing on the red carpet at the 2007 Academy Awards with his wife, son and daughter for his film "An Inconvenient Truth"]
KYLE
[fed up] Okay, can we stop ManBearPig now?!
GORE
Who said anything about stopping MBP?[Gore, his wife and his running mate are shaking hands while leaving an event in 2000]
STAN
Yu-you told us to do all this.
GORE
Yeah, to make up for ripping on me![Gore talking to reporters on a tarmac]
CARTMAN
You're still not even gonna help us?!
GORE
I've moved on from this life, okay?! I have a new life now! I'm a bowler![Gore addressing the United Nations]And when I'm not bowling, I help out my gang. [Gore on an airplane talking to a reporter]They're my family now! We're wanted in Blackwater, and we have to move our camp soon!
CARTMAN
You're playing Red Dead Redemption 2?
GORE
Yeah, it's amazing. Only thing is I have all these stolen items and I don't know how to sell them.[Gore and his wife greeting people outside an event at night]
STAN
We know how.
GORE
[softly] Oh, really? [Gore and his running mate at a rally in 2000]
[Baskin Robbins, day. It is destroyed, with shattered windows and bodies torn apart and strewn everywhere. The police show up and document the massacre.]
OFFICER 3
[with notepad] No witnesses to the attack were left alive. The same bear and pig droppings were found along with human excrement.
YATES
I don't believe it. A school shooting at an ice cream shop. Damn it! When children leave school they're supposed to be out of harm's way!
OFFICER 4
Detective! Sir, we got word on the two suspects. They appear to be on the run.
YATES
I would be too if I were guilty.
OFFICER 4
No one has seen them or their two closest friends, uh, Marsh and Broflovski.
YATES
So we got us a gang of shooters, huh?! How the hell hard can it be to find four boys?!
OFFICER 3
Sir. Why don't you take a break, sir?
YATES
Erh.
OFFICER 3
You've been hittin' it hard. We'll do all we can to catch these kids. Go home. Play some Red Dead Redemption.
YATES
Huh. Gotta admit I've to love to see the sunrise over Citadel Rock again. And I got me a gal who claims she's got a side mission or two.
OFFICER 3
Go on home, sir. We'll take care of everything here.
[Al Gore's storage unit. He opens the security shutters and leads the boys in. Lots of papers and electronics fill the unit]
GORE
This is it. Every piece of information I ever gathered on ManBearPig.
STAN
Where did ManBearPig come from?
KYLE
Is it some sort of genetic mutation?
GORE
[uncovers a huge workstation with three screens] Hoho! I thought that once too. I wanted to find ManBearPig's origins. And so I created this - the Internet. With that, I was able to look everywhere for any bit of data, and what I learned is that ManBearPig... is a demon.
KENNY
(A demon?!)
GORE
[brings up an image of an engraving] This is "The Temptation of St. Anthony" by Martin Schongauer. It depicts several demons. WolfMonekyGuy, ChickenFishWoman, and ElephantPorcupineMan, just to name a few. All of them sent by the Devil himself. [realizes something] Oh my God.
KYLE
What?
GORE
I should play Red Dead on this computer, with all three screens. That'd be so bitchin' sweet.
STAN
Why did the Devil send ManBearPig?!
GORE
Why does the Devil do anything? He's the freakin' Devil. He's a dick. [opens a secret compartment in which his red cape and gold medallion rest, and puts on the cape and medallion] It's probably too late. By now, ManBearPig is so powerful that the only way to get rid of him is to send him back to hell. We're going to have to do... a demonic ritual. [goes to a mirror to make sure he's ready] All I can say is... you boys better get to the grocery store, 'cause it's time... to get cereal.
[Yates' house, night. Yates parks his car outside the garage and goes to the front door. He opens it and goes in. Maggie comes out to greet him]
MAGGIE
Harrison Yates, where have ya been?!
YATES
Another school shooting, Maggie. Down at Baskin-Robbins. [grabs his controller and presses Play. He waits for the game to appear onscreen]
MAGGIE
I haven't seen ya in days. I've missed you so much. Come have some supper with me.
YATES
Maggie, I just need to relax a bit, all right? Please. I've been waiting for this a long time. Just give me a- Wait a minute. The house in Valentine is built? Where did I get a sniper rifle? Maggie! Did you play over my saved game?
MAGGIE
I just played a little bit.
YATES
A little bit, you-? On my saved game?! Why didn't you start your own?!
MAGGIE
You're never home anymore! With all these school shootings! I need a life too, you know?! ISo I robbed a lumber mill in Monto's rest, upgraded my horse and got a sniper rifle.
YATES
[stands up and confronts her] That's my life, Maggie! I was goin' for more honor points! God damn it!
MAGGIE
Why can't we have a life together?!
YATES
I haven't gotten to play in three days. You've done all this stuff without me! You got deputized?! [Maggie begins sobbing.] Oh God damn it! That does it!
MAGGIE
Where are ya going?!
YATES
I'm starting a new life! [goes to the hat rack and puts on his coat and hat, then goes back to the armchair] I'm creating a new saved game.
MAGGIE
You can;t possibly go all the way back to the snow level again!
YATES
What choice do I have now?! [Maggie sobs and heads towards the kitchen as he starts a new game] Fuckin' bitch.
[The woods, night. The camera aims at the night sky, then pans down, resting on the sacrificial circumscribed pentagram, drawn in blood. A goat is tied to a stake in the center, and a candle rests on each of the five points of the pentagram. Gore appears with a crown of twigs and holding a chicken by its feet]
GORE
Abuul abash mayah. What Satan has put forth upon this earth, may it be summoned and banished forever. [the boys stand by with two other dead chickens. They each hold a candle. Kenny takes one of them to Gore]
KYLE
Dude, come on. What are we doing?
CARTMAN
This is stupid.
STAN
He was right before.
GORE
We call upon the powers of darkness. Come on, guys. We call upon the powers of darkness.
THE BOYS
We call upon the powers of darkness.
GORE
Al Gore was right. Al Gore was right all along.
THE BOYS
Al Gore was right all along.
GORE
We should have listened to Al Gore.
THE BOYS
We should have all listened to Al Gore.
KYLE
Wait. Wait, are you videoing us?
GORE
It's Instagram Live. Keep going! We should have taken Al Gore more cereal.
STAN
All right all right, that's enough! [puts down his candle] You need to stop wasting our time, dude. People are dying! You don't have a fucking clue what you're doing! [the pentagram brightens up, winds whip around in it, flames appear on the bloody markings. The goat is consumed and the flames get stronger.]
GORE
[faces the boys] You were saying?
STAN
Oh shit! [facepalm] God damn it! Nothing! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
[The SPPD briefing room. The police officers await Yates. An officer coughs. The door opens and Yates storms in, also the door, puts his coat on the coat rack, kicks the wastebasket and walks to the lectern]
YATES
Do you all have any idea what it's like to start over?! You walk four hours through the snow relearning everything, all because your bitch wife went and spent all your hard-earned money on upgrades you didn't want! I get one little break from work - one little break - and I didn't even get back to the first brawl at the saloon!
OFFICER 5
[raises his hand] You can actually bypass that fight if you go hunting with Dutch.
YATES
[slams his fist on the lectern] SHUT UP!! These school shootings are done, you hear me?! I want this case closed by the end of the night, one way or another! Now let's MOVE OUT!
[The woods, night. The pentagram is quite hot now as Gore and the boys wait for Satan]
GORE
Here he comes, boys! Prepare yourselves! [the pentagram ones up and a giant hand rises out of it and grips the ground. The rest of the figure rises up, growling. It's Satan.]
SATAN
Who hath summoned me to this realm?!
KYLE
Dude! You summoned Satan!
GORE
Yeah, no doi! What'd ya think we were doing?! [turns to Satan] Prince of Darkness! It is I, Al Gore! I was almost President!
SATAN
What do you wish of me, Al Gore?!
GORE
A demon from Hell has been unleashed upon our world! We demand to know its nature! We demand to know its reason for coming!
SATAN
There is only one place you can find the answers you seek! It is the place where all knowledge becomes known. Your local library.
GORE
Ah! You are correct. [to the boys] Your local library is an excellent resource for whatever you wish to learn.
SATAN
Yes it is.
GORE
Then I command ye, Satan, to come with us to the local library! And I am cereal!
KYLE
Dude, Satan's not gonna go with us to the-
SATAN
Very well, Al Gore. Let us go!
[South Park Public Library, night. The boys and Gore are inside browsing the stacks]
SATAN
Yeah, guys! Guys, over here! I think I found it. What you're dealing with is a Sifter of Fate.
KENNY
(Well what's that mean?)
SATAN
So there's these demons that, um, actually come once every few generations. They're all about making deals.
STAN
Making deals?
SATAN
Yeah, check it out: "The Sifter of Fate thrives on tempting mankind. It will always offer a deal in exchange for mercy, but the carnage will be a thousand times worse when the debt comes due."
KYLE
Okay, so wait. Now you're saying that someone in our town made a deal with that thing?
SATAN
Now it's here to claim its part of the bargain. It's sort of like when you're part of a gang feuding with a rival gang, you know? You ride around on your horse thinking it won't all catch up with you, but... it always does.
GORE
You're playing Red Dead Redemption 2?
SATAN
So good, right? [police sirens draw near and stop]
[South Park Public Library exterior, night. Yates speaks through a bullhorn while numerous police cars and armed SPPD officers are behind him and a few townspeople observe.]
YATES
Attention school shooters! We have you surrounded! Come out with your hands up!
[South Park Public Library interior. The boys look out the window before turning around and walk away from the window.]
CARTMAN
Oh Jesus. You gotta tell them, Mr. Gore! Tell them it wasn't us!
GORE
No. They don't listen to me, kids. [walks up to them and genuflects] It's up to you young people now. [takes off his medallion...] You have to find a way to get people to take this cereal. [...and puts it on Kyle. He then puts his cape on Stan] You must convince people there's a ManBearPig, which Satan told you is a Fate Sifter demon that made a deal with someone in this town!
STAN
That's gonna be impossible!
GORE
Yeah, sounds really hard, doesn't it? People might not believe you and like, make fun of you and stuff. Poor you guys, huh? [the boys turn and walk out, heads down.]
[South Park Public Library exterior, night. The boys walk out to the steps of the library and stop in place with their hands up.]
OFFICER 5
They're coming out!
FEMALE OFFICER
Hands where we can see 'em!
STAN
Everyone, listen! ManBearPig is real! It's a demon that thrives on making deals to exploit mankind's weaknesses. I am super-duper cereal.[a few of the townspeople move in closer behind the officers to listen] We all have to work together, you guys. This one time. We have to all put our pride aside and be willing to say, maybe we were wrong.
YATES
[Approaches from the side behind the boys] All right, lock these little fuckers up! [four officers, one for each boy, come up from the other side and cuff them]
KYLE
No! You can't! [other officers come in and deal with the boys]
YATES
[leaving] That's it, gentlemen! Case closed. Now I've got a Goddamned stagecoach to rob in Scarlett Meadows!
OFFICER 6
Well done, sir! [he and Yates high-five each other in passing]
STAN
No! Nooo!
[The arrest is aired on News 4. Kyle and Stan are put into the back seat]
STAN
Please! Somebody made a deal with ManBearPig! We have to find out who!
[Shady Acres Retirement Community. Commons area. Marvin Marsh and other residents are watching the events unfold on TV.]
MARVIN
[looking at the newscast] Billy... What have I done?
End of Time To Get Cereal


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:ManBearPig continues to terrorize South Park. The boys break out of jail and are on the run from the police and ManBearPig. Satan steps up to help the boys and the rest of the citizens of South Park.

script:Nobody Got Cereal?

[Bright music plays as a couple leaves Jared's, the Galleria of Jewelry]
WIFE
[emotional] Oh my gosh! Oh, honey! I can't believe you went to Jared!
HUSBAND
This is a new beginning for us, darling. I'm just so excited for our future. [ManBearPig leaps in out of nowhere and mangles him to bits]
[Gameplay of Red Dead Redemption 2 is shown on a television set up next to a cup of pens and pencils.]
OFFICER JENKINS
[Off screen] Oh yeah! Take that, cop! You want some too, sheriff?! Yeah! There you go, bitch! Another dead cop! [The back of the player is now shown, with the television and a PS4 set up on an office desk] And another one! Yeah! You want some too, copper?! [the player is revealed to be a desk officer inside South Park Police Department.] You want a piece of this, you god damn pigs?!
[South Park Police Department, holding cells. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are hanging onto the cell door while Kenny is laying down on a cot. Officer Jenkins is a few feet away from them, playing RDR2.]
STAN
Officer, you have to let us out of here! We don't have much time!
JENKINS
Yeah, that's the last cop. Let's get out of here!
STAN
Sir, you have to listen to us. ManBearPig is real.
JENKINS
[Reclines back and puts his legs up on the desk] Oh God. Here we go again. "We gotta stop ManBearPig! We gotta take it serious!"
KYLE
But we do! ManBearPig is gonna kill everyone, and he's not gonna stop!
JENKINS
Oh, well then I guess I don't have to do anything about it.
CARTMAN
Can you get off your god damn video game for five fucking seconds so we can have a conversation?!
STAN
[leaves the cell door] Where the hell is Al Gore? Why isn't he coming for us?
KYLE
[walks up] Nobody's coming for us, Stan. They think we're murderers.
CARTMAN
And that's why we have to break out of here ourselves. [turns to the cop] Excuse me? Officer?
JENKINS
Shut up! I don't wanna hear anything about ManBearPig and how we're all doomed.
CARTMAN
No, it's not that. It's just...I noticed you're still riding your horse all the way back to camp.
JENKINS
[turns his head to face Cartman] Yeah. Trains and stagecoaches don't go to my camp.[turns back to the video game]
CARTMAN
No, they don't, but... you can use cinematic mode to make it easier on yourself.
JENKINS
[stops, then looks at him, startled, then sits up] What the hell are you talking about?
[South Park Community Center, evening. Several corpses lie on the ground, and a couple of small fires blaze nearby as an ambulance rushes by. Inside, Hugh is standing on a stage, next to a projection screen, as he prepares to speak to the audience.]
HUGH
All right, everyone. I realize a lot of people have died and most of the roads have been destroyed due to all the fires, so I'd like to thank you all for coming to tonight's symposium, "When Should I Start To Worry?" [On the projection screen, a picture of a blonde haired woman is shown pondering with her chin in her hand, along with the caption, "When should I start to worry?"] I'd like to make this an open discussion and hope we can all participate in ways that give us better insight. Yes, Mr. Clarkson?
MR. CLARKSON
[Stands up] I'm pretty sure there's a ManBearPig and I'm fairly certain that he has eaten two of my children and destroyed our home. When should I start to worry? [sits down]
HUGH
That's an excellent question. There's definitely evidence that all the death and destruction around us is due to a ManBearPig.
TOWNSMAN
[stands up and interjects] But no exact correlation to a ManBearPig!
HUGH
Definitely not, and that's why we're all here, to pinpoint, "When Should I Start To Worry?"
STEPHEN
[stands up]I think that the time to start worrying is coming. I don't know if I believe in ManBearPig or not, but I do know that I'm open to the idea of starting to worry. [he gets some applause and then sits down]
HUGH
I think Stephen echoes a lot of our feelings right now.
[South Park Community Center, interior entrance. Satan bursts through the closed doors, creating a massive hole in the wall and then flings chairs everywhere, as people run away from him]
SATAN
Rroooowwwwwrrrrr!! [grabs a man by the collar] Foolish mortals! Your time is nigh! Face your end!
MR. CLARKSON
[raises a hand and stands up] Um, it looks like Satan is here. Should I start to worry? [he gets some applause and then sits down]
[Tegridy Farms, night. Stan is trying to get inside. He rattles the doorknob a couple of times and then bangs on the door. Randy answers]
RANDY
[looks around and then looks down in shock] Stan?!
STAN
We broke out of jail, Dad.
RANDY
Come on. Get out of sight. [Stan goes in, Randy closes the door]
STAN
Cartman tricked the guards. We all ran home to be with our parents. Where's mom?
RANDY
Your mom's been out trying to find you a lawyer and a therapist. We've been doing all we can!
STAN
Dad, that thing we saw take Ned? It was ManBearPig. It was real!
RANDY
What are you talking about? It was just a bear.
STAN
No, Dad. It's... [notices his dad's eyes switching back and forth from him to the TV] Why do you keep looking at the TV?
RANDY
What? Why? I dunno? What?
STAN
[walks over to get a better look, then steps back, grabs the controller, and looks at Randy] You've been playing Red Dead Redemption?!
RANDY
A little bit. I mean... when I'm not doing all this stuff for you
STAN
I thought you were working on getting me out!
RANDY
Sorry, I needed a little break!
STAN
You're all the way to St. Denis?! That's like 40 hours of gameplay! How could you uh! Are you high right now?!
RANDY
I'm a little high, yes!
STAN
Oh my God!
RANDY
Oh what?! I'm sorry! I'm sorry that I need to decompress with all this shit going on!
STAN
I can't believe you would get high and play video games while your son is in jail! You're such an asshole!
RANDY
[gets in his face] Well at least I'm not a school shooter!
STAN
[walks up to him] It wasn't me! It was a demon named ManBearPig! [gives him the controller]
RANDY
Oh whatever! [goes to the sofa and sits down, and begins playing] "ManBearPig! ManBearPig!" You sound like your freakin' grandpa!
STAN
Yeah, because I learned a lot about-! [stops himself] Whoa whoa, what are you talking about I sound like Grandpa?
RANDY
He had been talking about ManBearPig comin' since I was fuckin' 14. Nothin' new.
STAN
[turns away] Someone made a deal with it... a long time ago.
RANDY
Do you know how to craft stamina tonics? [Stan glares back at Randy]
[The Broflovski Residence, night. Kyle comes in from the backyard through the sliding door. The house is dark, so he looks around carefully]
KYLE
Mom? [goes to the living room] Dad? [walks upstairs to the master bedroom, opens the door, and looks in, then closes it. He goes to his room and sits on his bed. He looks up] I don't know if you can hear me. I-I feel so alone right now. I-I feel like the whole world is falling apart and somehow I'm supposed to do something but... I don't know what that is anymore. [the window lights up]
GORE
[a ghostly image on the window] Fear not. Do not give up on yourself. You must keep believing.
KYLE
Mr. Gore? Where have you been?!
GORE
It's me. Al Gore.
KYLE
Yeah. Where have you been?!
GORE
You cannot lose faith, my child, even though everyone is ripping on you. Even though they don't believe you and they're saying you're just seeking attention because you lost the Presidency. You have to be strong!
KYLE
Well what happened to you? Are you dead or something?
GORE
No! not dead! Just merely using a flashlight on the glass to apply the Pepper's ghost technique.
KYLE
What, what? [turns around] Oh, god damn it. [Gore turns off the flashlight and turns on the bedroom light]
GORE
You see my point? Things aren't always as they appear. You have to stay strong, my little crusader.
KYLE
I can't do this alone. I need help.
GORE
I did, too. Didn't get it.
KYLE
What more do you want from me?? I've atoned for my mistake. I'm sorry that we were getting a lot of different information at the time. You know, even you were wrong about a lot of the things you said would happen a-
GORE
[puts his hand to his ear] What's that?
KYLE
Nothing. I didn't mean-
GORE
See you later, alligator. [turns and walks out.]
KYLE
[gives chase] No, no, no, no! I'm sorry! [follows him down the stairs] I am sorry, please! I'm cereal! Ah, I didn't mean to say you were wrong, just that some of your predictions didn't happen-
GORE
Oh yeah, you're real cereal. [they reach the front door. Gore opens it and is about to step out]
KYLE
Please, please, please! [Gore turns to look at him] I'll do anything! I just want everyone to be safe!
GORE
All I was doing was trying to be your mentor. You know who my mentor was? Me! Al Gore!
[Outside the doorway, a chiming sound is heard as the spirit version of Al Gores fades in and stands on the sidewalk]
SPIRIT GORE
Hello, Al Gore.
GORE
[gasps as he looks at his spirit] It's him! Just in time, too. Thanks for coming in my time of crisis, Al Gore! [closes the door. Kyle just stands there looking at it.]
[Jared, day. The building is covered with blood and police tape and has damaged windows. There are several bodies scattered all over the place. One officer puts up roadblocks, another takes notes. In the background, Yates surveys the damage with other officers and a group of forensic scientist in lab coats.]
OFFICER 7
Sorry to call you down, sir, but this is a bad one.
YATES
Oh no, that's fine. [takes out a pack of cigarettes and taps it on his wrist. He then pulls one out and returns the pack to his shirt pocket.] I finally arrest four school shooters and can play some Red Dead Redemption, and then I get a call about another school shooting. [takes out a lighter and lights up his cigarette.]
OFFICER 7
This one really doesn't look like a school shooting, sir. Five different witnesses say it was definitely... ManBearPig.
YATES
God damn it! There's no such thing as a ManBearPig! [The scientists and officers stop examining the scene and look at Yates] You got that?? We're working with facts here, not goofball theories!
OFFICER 7
Yea, but sir, all the forensic scientists say there are bear and pig footprints-
YATES
Fuck scientists! [The scientists and officers stop again and look at Yates] Why are you trying to figure out what's going with scientists?! The only thing I want to know is who committed this school shooting, since our school-shooting suspects are in jail!
OFFICER 1
Detective! [runs into view] Detective, we just got word from the station. The four shooting suspects broke out a while ago.
YATES
Oh well, there you go! It was them again! Gee, I didn't need any freakin' scientists to figure that out, did I?! Get 'em outta here! [the forensic scientists are escorted away] Now how the fuck did those kids break out of my jail?!
OFFICER 1
Jenkins said they tricked him. Said they could show him a way to fast-travel in Red Dead Redemption by upgrading his camp, and then they just took off.
YATES
[in a low voice] There's a way to fast-travel if you upgrade your camp? [thinks a moment] Jesus... [puts his hand on the back of the officer and then looks around as they take a few steps forward] You'd better start from the beginning.
[Shady Acres Retirement Community, exterior. evening]
[Shady Acres Retirement Community, interior. Commons area. A group of elderly residents are sitting down and watching the news on the television set.]
REPORTER
[off screen] More damage and destruction today as the death toll rises to the hundreds. [the reporter is now shown, standing in front of a Denny's that is covered in blood and has police tape around it.] Some see this as evidence ManBearPig might be real, while others say ManBearPig is a fabrication for political gains- [ManBearPig comes up from behind and attacks the reporter. Marvin Marsh is focused on the report]
STAN
[off screen] Grandpa?! [Marvin sits up with his jaw dropped as Stan comes into view a few feet behind him.] What did you do?
MARVIN
Oh, Billy. [chuckles] My grandson come to visit.
STAN
This isn't the first time ManBearPig has shown up, is it?! What happened?!
MARVIN
Billy, I have Alzheimer's. I don't even remember what happened this morning.
STAN
Cut the shit, Grandpa! You people knew! You made a deal with that thing!
MARGARET
We thought we'd be dead by now. We didn't think we'd have to live to see the consequences.
MARVIN
Aw, great! Just tell the whole world, Margaret! [zips past her in his wheelchair]
STAN
[follows him down the dorm hallway] Why did you old people make a deal?!
MARVIN
We had a right to be happy too, you know?!
STAN
And you just signed away the future?!
MARVIN
We didn't want to have to give the demon his stuff back!
STAN
What stuff?!
MARVIN
All our cars [turns his wheelchair around], and premium boutique ice cream.
STAN
You couldn't control yourselves, so now that thing is here to kill all of us! Good fuckin' job, Grandpa!
[Broflovski Residence, backyard, night. Cartman and Kenny pound on the sliding door. Kyle opens up]
CARTMAN
Kyle, come on. We've gotta go.
KYLE
Go where?
CARTMAN
I had a vision, Kyle. Al Gore's ghost visited me.
KYLE
Al Gore isn't dead.
CARTMAN
Well his ghost visited me, Kyle. He said he had a plan, and we needed to go. Are you in or not?
KENNY
(Yeah, are you in or not?) [Kyle stays silent]
[The woods, night. Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny walk through it in the dark. Cartman has the flashlight]
KYLE
We shouldn't be out here. We're wanted by the police. [some growling and howling is heard, with the sound of cracking branches]
CARTMAN
Shhh. What was that?
KENNY
(Sounds like a fuckin' werewolf!)
CARTMAN
This is where Al Gore told me to go. [more growling is heard as Cartman moves his flashlight around]
KENNY
(What the fuck is that?!) [points to something. Satan jumps into the beam of light with a display of might]
KYLE
It's Satan.
CARTMAN
What are you doing here, Satan?
SATAN
I was told to come here by the spirit of Al Gore.
CARTMAN
Us too. But why? [The spirit of Al Gore suddenly appears and floats next to Kyle]
SPIRIT GORE
Remember... even though I am gone, you must still work together.
KYLE
Work together how??
SPIRIT GORE
I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to the ones who are actually cereal. [to the others] You cannot lose hope. There is still much you need to know.
[The Yates house. Harrison arrives and is about to open his front door when he hears a shooting and screams, then the sound of a galloping horse. He then knows what's going on.]
YATES
Oh, you'd better not- [goes inside and throws his hat and jacket down] You bitch! [Maggie squeals in fright and stands up] You're playing Red Dead Redemption, aren't you?!
MAGGIE
[angrily] So what of it?!
YATES
What did I tell you about playing on my saved game, Maggie?!
MAGGIE
No! No, this is my life now, Harrison Yates! I started over, with me own saved game!
YATES
What are you talking about?!
MAGGIE
See for yourself. [puts the game controller in his hand] You and all your talk o'wantin' your own life! I wanted somethin' new too! [walks behind Yates to his left side, as he begins to check out the stats] I started over in the snow and worked my way up to the new gang leader! I have thousands of dollars o'me own! [walks behind Yates to his right side]I built a house with John Marston! I'm helpin' his family now!
YATES
[steps forward and presses some buttons] You fucking slut!
MAGGIE
[turns and points her finger into Yates' face]That's right, Harrison Yates! And what have you got?! [walks behind Yates to his left side] A basic starter horse and the $20 gambler's that you won at a poker match! I'm twice the man you are now!
YATES
Don't you talk to me like that!
MAGGIE
I'll talk however I want! [walks behind Yates to his right side] I've completed every hunting side mission! Found seven legendary animals! [crosses her arms over her chest]
YATES
Found them where?!
MAGGIE
I'm not tellin'! You wanted your now life and now you got it! [walks out of the room]
YATES
Maggie! [breaks down onto his knees and weeps] Nwaaahahahahaha...
[In the woods at night, Spirit Gore has been speaking to the boys and Satan]
GORE
And in conclusion, let me just say that you are the future. You cannot give up hope. I brought you all together because I believe in you.
[The boys and Satan are sitting on a log. Satan looks rather bored while the boys try to understand what Spirit Gore is saying.]
CARTMAN
Okay, but what do you want us to-?
SPIRIT GORE
And sometimes, believing is all that we need to be cereal. [disappears. Suddenly, a set of end credits roll in his place with Al Gore credited for everything, showing that this was pre-taped]
KYLE
Credits? [some clapping is heard. The boys turn around and see Al Gore by a movie projector]
GORE
Did you guys like my movie?
CARTMAN
What are you doing?
GORE
Exactly. I'm trying to get you to ask "What would Al Gore do?"
SPIRIT GORE
Make a movie starring you.
GORE
Yes, to get you all to not give up. To get you to fight!
SATAN
[to Gore as he walks away from the log] You don't understand. There is no fight. [turns to the boys] A deal was made. We do not know by whom. But this demon has grown stronger, and no mortal can do anything to stop it.
CARTMAN
[gets off the log] No mortal. But what about you?
SATAN
Why would I help mankind?
CARTMAN
Satan, come on. Are you really gonna stand there and not say you appreciate all the nice things humans have done for you lately? I mean, not sure if you've noticed, but we're pretty much doing things your way up here
SATAN
[turns around again and contemplates] I... must admit, people up here on Earth have been doing a lot of my work for me lately. Maybe... maybe it is time I did something for them.
[A picture frame is shown, being held up by a pair of small hands. Inside, a picture of a younger Marvin Marsh, smiling and sitting in the driver's seat of a 1978 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am and holding a triple scoop of ice cream in his left hand.]
MARVIN
[off screen] We were all young and foolish back then, Billy. We didn't think about the future. We just wanted things. [Stan is the one holding the picture while Marvin is looking out the window in his room] This creature shows up, and it seemed like a good deal for everyone in town.
STAN
[puts the frame down and turns to Marvin] You didn't stop to think about what it would mean for us?
MARVIN
[turns his wheelchair around to face Stan] Aw Billy, it's not that simple. We thought about it. But our town was so tiny back then. We just, we wanted nice things other people had.
STAN
And you didn't give two shits what it would mean for your grandchildren.
MARVIN
I didn't think I'd have grandkids. I didn't even want children. That's why I always came on Gram Gram's tits.
STAN
[closes his eyes] Aaaah.
MARVIN
But then, one night, I'm having sex with your grandma, and she sticks her finger in my ass. She had sometimes licked my ass before, [Stan looks at him in disbelief] but this was the first time she used her finger, and I came inside her like that. [slaps his left hand with his right] I pulled out and your grandma was like "Did you just come in me?", and I was like "Well, you stuck your finger in my ass." And that's basically why you're here, Billy.
STAN
This is supposed to make me feel better?
MARVIN
I'm just saying that I wasn't thinking about the future because your father was supposed to be nothing but dried-up crust on Gram Gram's titties.
STAN
You... people... made a deal with ManBearPig! How?! Where?!
MARVIN
It doesn't matter, Billy. It's too late now.
STAN
Tell me how the deal happened so that I can try to make it go away!
[Downtown South Park, night. People are running all over the place and screaming. ManBearPig chases after them.]
TOWNSMAN 2
[running] No! No! [ManBearPig catches him, tears into him, and bites into his back]
SATAN
[offscreen] ManBearPig! [approaches ManBearPig slowly, deliberately, like a sheriff in the Old West. He roars. ManBearPig roars back and faces Satan. They run at each other. ManBearPig leaps onto a car and swipes at Satan, sending him to the ground. The impact sets off car alarms. Satan gets up and turns around. They run at each other again. ManBearPig throws Satan into a building, but Satan bounces right back. They grapple for a few seconds, but ManBearPig grabs Satan's left horn and rips it off] Aaaargh!!! [ManBearPig drives the horn into Satan's chest] Aaaaarch!!! [ManBearPig grabs Satan and throws him to the ground, then punches him a few times. ManBearPig delivers one last left hook and runs away. Satan coughs as townspeople gather around. The boys run up just in time to see him die]
KYLE
Satan!
SATAN
[weakly] H-hey. Hey kids. [coughs] I'm sorry.
KYLE
[he and the other boys are starting to tear up] No. Satan, you can't die.
SATAN
Everyone dies. I just wish I could have helped you. [coughs again] Oh God, it hurts.
CARTMAN
We can't do this without you, Satan.
SATAN
You have to. You have to keep trying.
KYLE
If you can't stop ManBearPig, how can we be-??
SATAN
You have to keep trying!! [coughs] You... have to believe. [grunts and then finally succumbs to his injuries]
KENNY
(No...)
TOWNSMAN 3
Satan's dead. [a bell tolls]
KYLE
Come back. Come back. [a light appears around Satan's body, and his spirit rises from it. As he rises to Heaven, a small bell tolls and he gets angel wings and a halo.]
SATAN
[softly] Goodbye.
KYLE
[tears streaming from his face] Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
[A new show appears on TV]
HUGH
And now, on Park County Public access, "Should We Start To Worry?" with your host, Jim Kimble.
JIM
As our town continues to burn to the ground, Satan has been slaughtered and sent to Heaven. Should we start to worry? Joining me now, an expert on our county resources and preparedness, Alec Vaughn. Alec, should we start to worry?
ALEC
Jim, I think we should definitely consider starting to worry. Satan was one of the most powerful entities, supposedly, in the universe, and ManBearPig annihilated him like a bitch. I don't think we should waste any more time underestimating the importance of beginning to think about starting to worry.
JIM
Also joining us is the former Vice-President, Al Gore. Mr. Gore, do you think it's time for us to deliberate the process of starting to worry?
SPIRIT GORE
If by worrying you mean getting cereal, then an empathic "YES."
GUEST
I don't think there's any more room for not considering underestimating the importance of beginning to start the process of mulling over the conceptualization of starting to worry. And the time to do it is... very soon.
GORE
[walks behind the host's chair] Hey, what are you doing?
SPIRIT GORE
I'm being a spiritual mentor. These people are depending on me.
GORE
No, they're depending on me! I'm depending on you, goofball!
[South Park Elementary, exterior, night. Two mangled bodies lay on the sidewalk as a flaming car with people screaming inside rolls by. Faint sirens are heard nearby]
[South Park Elementary, 4th grade classroom. Kyle looks down from a classroom window. Cartman and Kenny sit at their desks in the empty classroom.]
KYLE
[leaves the window] All right, looks like we're clear.
CARTMAN
I can't believe it's the weekend, and I'm at school!
KYLE
This is the best place to hide.
CARTMAN
Why? Of all the places we could hide, why do I have to sit here in school?!
KENNY
(Yeah!)
KYLE
Where's the last place anyone would think we would hide? The scene of our supposed crime, dummies! We're safe here.
CARTMAN
I'd rather be in jail than at school. [the doorknob sounds]
KENNY
(Oh shit!)
STAN
[opens the door and looks in] Guys? Guys!
KYLE
Stan!
STAN
Guys, thank God! Just stay right there, Grandpa! [Marvin sits in his wheelchair in the middle of the school hallway, looking bitter] I know all about the deal. I know what we have to do.
KYLE
How'd you find us here?
STAN
I figured you guys would be hiding somewhere. This is the first place I thought to look.
KENNY
[arms folded] (Uh huh!)
CARTMAN
Yeah, I guess we're dummies, huh Kenny?
KENNY
(Yeah, I guess we're dummies.)
STAN
Guys, listen: my stupid grandpa and a bunch of other old people made the deal with ManBearPig. It's here because of their greediness.
MARVIN
[from the hallway] Everyone's greedy!
STAN
Shut up, Grandpa! I know where to go, but I need your help. I'm going to face ManBearPig and put an end to this deal.
CARTMAN
Are you crazy? We just saw ManBearPig take down Satan. What the hell are we supposed to do against it?
STAN
We have to try. [police sirens are heard approaching]
OFFICER 8
Attention school shooters... again. [the boys head to the window and look out through it]
[South Park Elementary, exterior, night. A group of armed SPPD officers stand outside the school. A few townspeople stop to observe.]
OFFICER 8
We have you surrounded... again. Come out with your hands up!
CARTMAN
[Looking at Kyle who is peaking through the window blinds] We just sat in school... for nothing!
[South Park Elementary, front entrance, night. A spotlight is pointed to the front entrance doors. The boys soon come out with Marvin]
STAN
Listen! We know what to do now!
OFFICER 8
Drop to the ground and put your hands on your heads!
STAN
No! I need to face ManBearPig!
OFFICER 8
We have orders! You're coming with us!
YATES
Belay those orders! [the officers look left. Yates approaches the boys and Marvin. He then paces back and forth in front of the spotlight.] I've been a fool, denying ManBearPig's existence, and I didn't realize it till I went home. My wife... had started a new life without me.. I wanted to give up, but instead, I robbed a bank at St. Denis and a went to an island north of Cuba. [the townspeople look at each other] After I came back, that's when it all caught up with me. All the stagecoaches I had robbed, all the horses I had stole, for what?! [the police officers are shown listening to Yates] We're nothing if we don't believe in each other! And Goddamnit, it's never too late to start trying to do the right thing. You think you know what that is, boys?
STAN
Yes I do. We're going to face ManBearPig and put an end to this deal once and for all.
[A courtroom office, day. A lawyer has paperwork set out for the boys to sign]
LAWYER
Okay, [lifts up some pages in the packet and highlights some lines] sign here and here. [hands the paperwork to Stan] These documents state merely that you've been granted power of attorney by your town and that you wish to attempt to void the current agreement.
STAN
'Kay.
LAWYER
Since this is a renegotiation, [highlights more text on another set of documents] you agree that ManBearPig has right to compensation for termination, and you will give up all rights to specified assets. [hands the paperwork to Stan]
STAN
Yes. Yes, we agree to give back cars and ice cream. [ManBearPig grumbles off screen]
LAWYER
Uh, let me confer with my client. [ManBearPig is now shown sitting next to the lawyer, wearing a business suit and grunts quietly] Uh huh. Got it. Yes. My client says that he- [ManBearPig grunts quietly] 'Kay. [ManBearPig grunts some more] Uh, mm-hmm. ManBearPig has no interest in you giving up cars and ice cream.
KYLE
Well, what's he want everyone to give up?
[The Park County Courthouse, exterior, day. A large crowd awaits the results of the negotiation]
TOWNSMAN 4
There! There he is! There he is!
TOWNSMAN 5
Is it over?!
STAN
[speaking from an open window on the upper floor] Um, he says he'll never come back again, but... we have to give up soy sauce and Red Dead Redemption 2.
ALL
...Ohhhhh.
TOWNSMAN 6
...Just plain rice?
STAN
...Yeah, that's what I thought. [goes back to the table] Um, could we possibly talk about restructuring a new deal?
MARVIN
[off screen] Uh huh! Uh huh! [sitting at the edge of the table]
STAN
No, no. Just like, um, can we do, like, a renegotiation?
LAWYER
All right, sign here and here [lifts up some of the pages on a new set of documents and highlights some text] that you are entering a renegotiation with ManBearPig. [hands the paperwork to Stan]
STAN
Where do I sign that?
LAWYER
Right there.
STAN
Okay.
MARVIN
Yeah, I thought so. [the camera zooms out to show a wider angle of the room]
STAN
Shut up, Grandpa!
[The Park County Courthouse, exterior, day. the camera continues to zoom out and shows more of the crowd waiting outside while the parties continue to negotiate off screen.]
LAWYER
And sign here that ManBearPig has rights to the lives of all the children in Third World countries.
STAN
'Key, got it.
LAWYER
And you agree to ignore ManBearPig until he returns in five years, in which time the carnage will be a thousand-fold.
STAN
'Kay, where do I sign that?
End of Nobody Got Cereal?


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Eric Cartman has been diagnosed with anxiety. Cartman just canâ€™t deal with people any longer. They get in the way of whatâ€™s most important in his life.

script:Buddha Box

[A very blurry image appears onscreen, but it begins to sharpen ever so slowly... It's Cartman, thinking back over the season's events.]
CARTMAN
I don't know where to start. First, it was all the school shootings, then these Wi-Fi scooters showed up, and now we know that ManBearPig is real and we could all be dead in a matter of years.
DOCTOR
[slowly] And you believe this all relates somehow to the movie Black Panther not being as good as everyone says it was?
CARTMAN
I know there's a connection. But that isn't what matters. I can't deal with people anymore. It's just... everyone sucks so hard, you know? Everybody is so stupid. And they all walk around going "Nya na chai cha nyachacha chai cha." And the only thing that makes me happy, the only thing I can trust... is this. [holds up his phone] But... all people do is try to keep me from it. [memories show up onscreen.]
[Cartman's Bedroom. He is reclining back with his legs on top of his computer desk, smiling...while playing with his phone. Liane stops by and opens the door.]
CARTMAN
I'll be in my room and my mom will come in and say...
LIANE
[Cartman imitates her]"Eric, that's enough time on your phone!" [she leaves as Cartman frowns, then lowers his eyelids]
[South Park Elementary, forth grade classroom. Cartman is on his phone again, smiling, while Mrs. Nelson has some multiplication problems written on the chalkboard.]
CARTMAN
And then at school...
MRS. NELSON
[Cartman imitates her] "Eric!" [he stops looking at his phone as Mrs. Nelson addresses him] "What are you doing? You can't use your phone at school!" [Cartman begins to frown again]
[South Park Elementary, playground. Some of the forth grade boys are playing football and trying to block each other. Cartman is on his phone again, smiling and holding the football, with his back turned towards the game.]
CARTMAN
And even my friends. My own friends! They'll be like...
STAN
[Cartman imitates him] "Hey Cartman! Throw us the ball. You're the goddamn quarterback!" [Cartman droops]
[Doctor's office. Cartman is back on the chair.]
CARTMAN
It's like, everybody needs something from me. All I want is a little time with my phone instead of always listening to people's needy bullshit. [a second or two of silence, then Cartman looks over and sees the doctor playing with his own phone.]
DOCTOR
Oh ahh, d'ya, sorry. Just... [puts his phone away] Uh, well, you know, young people have so much to deal with today. I believe that what you have is... anxiety.
CARTMAN
Anxiety? Is that cool?
DOCTOR
It's pretty common these days. What it really is, more than anything is an excuse to be lazy and lame to everyone around you.
CARTMAN
[sits up] Oh my God, that's perfect!
[PC Principal's office, day. He's playing on his smartphone when a call comes in on the school's intercom]
PC PRINCIPAL
I'm busy. [the intercom beeps again]
MS. BLAZE
Mr. Principal?
PC PRINCIPAL
I'm busy doing stuff! [beep] What?!
MS. BLAZE
The vice principal needs to speak with you. She says it's urgent. [PC Principal sighs]
[The Vice Principal's office. PC Principal arrives there looking around]
MR. MACKEY
[surprising him] Oh, PC Principal!
PC PRINCIPAL
Uh-uh yes?
MR. MACKEY
Are you going in to see the vice principal? I really need to speak with her.
PC PRINCIPAL
Uh yeah, we just uh, we're having an important scheduling to go over.
MR. MACKEY
Everything is okay with you two? There's no more "inappropriate behavior"? You know, as a counselor, I'm here to-
PC PRINCIPAL
That's in the past, Mackey! We've paid our dues, and we're not hiding anything anymore.
MR. MACKEY
Mmm-m'kay. [turns left and continues on his way. PC Principal turns around and opens the door, then goes in]
[The Vice Principal's office, inside. The office is a nursery and the PC babies are throwing stuff around and crying.]
STRONG WOMAN
[frustrated] I could use a little help here!
PC PRINCIPAL
What's going on??
STRONG WOMAN
Riley said a word her sister felt was insensitive to Muslims. Now they're all upset.
PC PRINCIPAL
All right, what word did you use, Riley?!
STRONG WOMAN
She just said "Aba daba."
PC PRINCIPAL
Look, can't we put them in a daycare?
STRONG WOMAN
Oh, yeah. That would be really smart. If anybody sees them, they're gonna figure out you're the father.
PC PRINCIPAL
Well maybe they won't!
STRONG WOMAN
You wanna risk that? The babies have to stay hidden because if people know the truth, then you're not PC and I'm not strong! [she leaves the office, looking both ways before closing the door]
[A restaurant, day. Cartman is at a table waiting for service, but also on his phone tapping away]
WAITER
[arrives, smiling] All right, can I take your order? [Cartman ignores him until he speaks again] Excuse me. [Cartman puts his hand up for a moment] What would you like, sir?
CARTMAN
Just a God- can you wait?! Isn't that your job?! Aren't you a wait-er?! [the waiter walks away, eyeing him. Cartman starts a video game. The noise from the game eventually catches the attention of a nearby diner]
DINER
Hey, could you turn your phone down, kid? This is a restaurant.
CARTMAN
It just so happens I have anxiety! That means I have trouble being around assholes who won't leave me alone! [leaves his chair]
[The streets downtown. Cartman walks down a sidewalk when a cyclist whizzes past him and rings the bike's bell. He looks but lets it go and continues walking. He crosses an intersection. He then approaches Tele's, where the owner is sweeping the front entrance and then notices Cartman.]
TELE'S OWNER
Oh, hello, Eric.
CARTMAN
Shut up. I have anxiety. [approaches another intersection when an elderly man tries to get his attention]
PEDESTRIAN
Hey kid! [Cartman is visibly annoyed] Hey kid!
CARTMAN
[turns around and yells out in anger] I'm on my phone!!
PEDESTRIAN
You're about to get hit by a car! [a car goes by behind Cartman]
CARTMAN
[just angered] All right, that's it! Everyone stop! Just fucking stop right now! [traffic stops moving and everyone stops to listen] Listen up, people! I have anxiety! That means I'm in my shell and have a hard time expressing myself! I find it difficult to engage with others! So everyone shut the fuck up because my anxiety is up here right now!
[A commercial. Zen music plays as the camera pans down to a Buddha statue in a garden complete with waterfall]
ANNOUNCER
We live in a world of many distractions. It's hard to find peace.
[A woman sits alone on a park bench on a sidewalk, looking at her phone. She then notices people all around her are looking at their phones as well]
ANNOUNCER
In the hustle and bustle of modern times, we've lost the one thing we all need. [The scene freezes with the woman now smiling and the caption, "More quality one-on-one time with our phone" appears next to her]. More quality one-on-one time with our phone.
[A blonde female pulls up a cardboard box from the bottom of the screen and holds it up, revealing it to be the Buddha Box.]
ANNOUNCER
But now you can have it with Buddha Box. [a cardboard box with a "DO NOT DISTURB" sticker on the front, a drawing of Buddha above the product name "Buddha Box" and an antenna on the side. The woman proceeds to put it over her head] Simply fit the patented box on your head and set its Bluetooth to your mobile device.
[A 3D rendered model of the Buddha Box with its internal workings is shown, along with the captions "FRONT PROJECTION 4K SCREEN", "CELLULAR ANTENNA" and "NOISE CANCELLING HEADPHONES"]
ANNOUNCER
Inside Buddha Box, your phone is projected two inches from your face, and the noise-canceling headphones let you hear your phone without any outside noise, giving you peace from...
[Inside a car that is stuck in traffic, an Uber driver is talking non-stop while a businessman in the backseat is visibly annoyed.]
ANNOUNCER
That annoying Uber driver who wants to talk. [the businessman puts the Buddha Box over his head while the driver doesn't seem notice.]
[A business office. A female office worker is at her cubicle and using her smartphone. A male co-worker starts to approach her.]
ANNOUNCER
Those people at work who act like they need stuff. [As the co-worker is about to speak to her, she notices and immediately puts the Buddha Box over head and goes back to her phone]
[A living room. A blonde male turns and looks into the camera as his three kids run around the room, playing with toy swords and a rocket and then jump on the couch.]
MAN
I want to be enlightened, like the Buddha, but I've got these fucking kids.
[A family dining room. The blonde male has the Buddha Box over his head and plays with his phone, while his wife desperately tries to calm the kids down.]
ANNOUNCER
Let Buddha Box take you to a place of peace and serenity, [the man is transported from the dining room to a heavenly atmosphere, floating above the clouds...while still looking at his phone] where you can have quality, uninterrupted time with your phone.
[A bedroom. A woman is sitting on her bed and removes the Buddha Box from her head.]
WOMAN
I was stressed out and feeling anxious. After just 8 to 10 hours in Buddha Box, I feel refreshed and ready to take on anything.
[The woman's husband appears by the door and leans in to talk to her.]
HUSBAND
Babe, can you please come say hi to my mother while she's here? [she just reaches over and drops the Buddha Box on her head and picks up her phone]
ANNOUNCER
[The Buddha Box is shown rotating as it approaches the center of the screen] Order Buddha Box today and you too can have that quiet, quality time with your phone. Like... the Buddha. [The Buddha Box logo is shown. Suddenly it has a Buddha Box over its head and a phone in its hands]
[South Park Elementary, day. Cartman stands in the hallway with his Buddha Box on. Kevin walks past him, staring. Kyle and Stan walk around the corner and stop when they reach him]
KYLE
What the hell is that?
STAN
I think it's Cartman.
KYLE
What is it doing?
[Inside the Buddha Box. A close up of Cartman's face is shown, along with reflections from his iPhone screen, though they are all reversed.]
CARTMAN
[out loud, but the Buddha Box is soundproof, so no one else can hear him] Ha! That's so sweet! [A Youtube page with an image of a guy covered in pasta titled "Guy hit by pasta!" and has 67,453 views] That video seriously made me laugh! [closes the app and returns to the iPhone home screen] Let me check my e-mail again! [opens an email app] Oh man, nothing from Lorenz yet? Whatever. Weak.[returns to the iPhone home screen] Oh! I gotta see that post from Clyde again! [goes and opens Instagram. A post from "ClydeTheMan" is shown, with a selfie of Clyde smugly looking into the camera. Behind him is Butters, who appears to be unconscious and laying on his back out on the sidewalk. It has the caption, "Guess who I found? #dead" and 110 likes. Kyle and Stan stay by Cartman until the bell rings, then they go to class.]
[The boys bathroom. Craig is at the urinal. Somehow, Cartman makes his way inside and wanders over to the urinals. He stands right next to Craig and drops through.]
CRAIG
Dude! [Cartman bumps into him] Dude, what the hell are you doing?!
CARTMAN
What? What? Who is that?
CRAIG
Get off of me!!
CARTMAN
[raises his Buddha Box] Oh, sorry Craig. Didn't see you there.
CRAIG
Yeah, 'cause you got a stupid box on your head! [finishes up, zips up his pants, and flushes the urinal, then walks away]
CARTMAN
Oh, there's nothing stupid about it. Don't you wish you had a way to deal with your anxiety?
CRAIG
[stops, then turns around] My anxiety?
CARTMAN
I see it in you, Craig. With your parents and relationships? Imagine being able to shut them out for a little while, Craig, so you can focus on what matters. With Buddha Box you can cut out all the unwanted noise. Not have to deal with conversations that are of no interest to you.
CRAIG
Well, I have to admit: sometimes, when me and Tweek are together it's... it's like he wants my atten- [Thump. Cartman has lowered his Buddha Box over his head. Craig turns around, dismayed, and walks out. Cartman turns left and steps up to the urinal]
[The Fourth Grade classroom, day. The bell rings and Mrs. Nelson walks up to the chalkboard to erase the multiplication problems that were there]
MS. NELSON
All right, children, we have a lot to go over for today's quiz. Who can tell me where we left off? [turns around and notices Cartman wearing his Buddha Box] Eric. [no reaction] Eric Cartman.
[Inside the Buddha Box. A close up of Cartman's face is shown, along with reflections from his iPhone screen, though they are all reversed.]
CARTMAN
[looking at the website, "Thrown Tomatoes", with a picture and reviews for the movie "Creed II"] Thirty-four million dollars box office? How the hell does Creed II do $34 million opening weekend? [begins to flip through his apps] What's the weather like tomorrow? [The weather forecast screen shows it is 22 degrees and sunny in South Park] Oh, it's snowing? I gotta tell Lorenz. I- [as he attempts to access the email app, the Box comes off his head, and the light blinds his eyes] Whoa, whoa! Hey!
MRS. NELSON
[holding Cartman's Buddha Box] What do you think you're doing?
CARTMAN
Excuse me, that's my Buddha Box.
MS. NELSON
You aren't using this during class time.
CARTMAN
It relaxes me. Ask my therapist. I have anxiety, you dumb bitch! [Mrs. Nelson and the rest of the class gasp at his remark]
[The Principal's office. Cartman has earned a trip there for calling his teacher a "dumb bitch"]
PC PRINCIPAL
I don't know what makes you think you're different from everyone else, but nobody gets away with slandering teachers at this school!
CARTMAN
[to his phone] Uhuh. Aw man, that looks, that looks sweet.
PC PRINCIPAL
Hey! [no reaction] HEY! [Cartman peeks out from under the box, then looks at PC Principal]
CARTMAN
Oh, PC Principal. Hello.
PC PRINCIPAL
Just what do you think you're doing?
CARTMAN
[as Zen music plays] I'm letting go of stress and being calm, like the Buddha.
PC PRINCIPAL
There are no boxes on your head in school!
CARTMAN
Hey. Whoa man, what's going on? Are you suffering from anxiety?
PC PRINCIPAL
What are you talking about?
CARTMAN
It's okay. I have it too. Anxiety is very real. But there is help for people like us.
[Strong Woman's living room, day. The PC Babies have taken over it and are causing damage as PC Principal sits on the sofa wearing a Buddha Box. Strong Woman comes in and surveys the damage]
STRONG WOMAN
What the fuck are you doing?! [walks up and removes the Box from his head] Hey! What the fuck are you doing?!
PC PRINCIPAL
Oh hey, I just needed to answer a couple of e-mails really fast.
STRONG WOMAN
With a box on your head?!
PC PRINCIPAL
I got one for you, too. [gets off the sofa and gets it to show her] It's Buddha Box. [no reaction] Look, you and I have been having a lot of problems. Clearly, what we both need is more quality one-on-one time with our phones.
STRONG WOMAN
I don't need a box on my head to use the phone!
PC PRINCIPAL
I'm sorry! [takes the box to the sofa and dumps it there] I was trying to be helpful! [gets his Buddha Box and leaves. One of the girls tries to pull a rabbit away from one of her brothers]
STRONG WOMAN
All right, Riley. Give that back to your brother. [the brother chases Riley. Another brother goes to an end table and pulls the lamp off it, breaking the light bulb] Bailey, no! [a third brother sees some paper wads and begins to chew on one of them] Harper, don't! Har-per! [picks up her phone and starts using it. Then she looks at the Buddha Box and puts it on her head. The babies stop crying and begin to crawl or walk away. They pass by the restroom. Riley stops to open the door to show PC Principal on the toilet, and Harper looks on. They then move out]
[Montage. The babies leave the house and wander the town. Bailey sits on a mailbox drop slot. Riley slides off the hood of a car. Harper somehow got on the roof of a building. The other sister walks out of a shop. The kids then take a submarine and ride it in an aquarium with fish and an octopus in it. They study some restrooms and cry over the "Male Only" and "Female Only" designations. Then, they are shown flying upward into the sky with a rainbow behind them. Next, they're in a children's library as the librarian brings out "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" from the American Classics shelf. The babies cry again. Finally the PC Babies logo comes up]
ALL
PC Babies

They're comin' to your town
ALL
PC Babies

They're sure to let you know.
Making things fun and gender-neutral

[Crunchy's Micro Brew, day.]
PATRON 1
Hey Mike. What's that you're drinking?
MIKE
This? Oh, it's a Cosmopolitan. I know, I know, it's a pussy drink. [some babies are heard crying.]
PATRON 2
[leans in a bit to say] Hey, be careful, guys. There are some PC babies over there. [the three gents approach the babies.]
MIKE
Oh great. Come on, I didn't mean pussy drink as in female genitalia. [the babies don't stop] Okay, I'm sorry! I'll order a Black Russian! [babies cry harder]
BARKEEP
Hey, what's all that racket down there?!
PATRON 1
Oh, there's some PC babies upset about certain drink descriptions.
BARKEEP
Fine, we'll take them off the menu.
PATRON 1
Who's makin' a difference? Who's the future? [this brightens the babies' moods as they start to giggle.]
[A soccer field, day. The South Park Cows are facing a visiting team. Kyle and Stan kick the ball back and forth until a visiting player intercepts it and drives toward the Cows' net.]
KYLE
Here it comes! Block it! [the player kicks the ball towards the net. Cartman stands there oblivious that there's a game going on. The ball goes cleanly into the net. The player smiles as the whistle blows.] What the fuck, dude?!
TOLKIEN
What is your goddamn problem?! [he, Kyle, and Stan move towards him]
CARTMAN
[lifts up his Box] What's going on?
KYLE
They just scored again, you fat fuck!
CARTMAN
Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry I'm dealing with my anxiety! Do you know how hard it is for people with my condition to come out and even do things like this?! Living with anxiety is awful, huh Craig? [Craig is shown wearing a Buddha Box]
KYLE
Can we get another goalie, please?!
CARTMAN
Oh yeah! Sure! Yeah, because people with anxiety shouldn't be allowed to play sports! Right, Kyle?! [A Buddha Box sits on Cartman's head.] You know, our world is dark and scary enough without people like you making us feel inferior. [drops his Box over his head again, but lifts it up really quickly.] Asshole! [back down the Box goes]
TOLKIEN
Fuck this! [walks off angrily] My parents didn't come here to see their son lose by 20 points! Come on, Dad. Let's go! [his anger vanishes] Dad? [Steve Black and a few other parents in the stands are wearing their own Buddha Box]
[Downtown, day. PC Principal drives Strong Woman through town searching for the babies]
STRONG WOMAN
River?? Bailey?! Emory?!
PC PRINCIPAL
It's okay. We're gonna find them.
STRONG WOMAN
I can't believe you were on your phone!
PC PRINCIPAL
You were on your phone too!
STRONG WOMAN
It was my time to be on the phone! You were on yours all morning!
PC PRINCIPAL
You're seriously gonna make this all my fault?!
STRONG WOMAN
Yes!
PC PRINCIPAL
Because last time I checked, you didn't even want me around as a partner to the PC Babies, even though I-
STRONG WOMAN
[rolls her eyes] Oh God, I'm not doing this again.
PC PRINCIPAL
Even though you need me to do shit for you every [Strong Woman drops her Box over her head] 10 fuckin' minutes! You don't get to just say whatever you- [notices she's no longer listening] Oh. Okay, cool. Fine with me! I'm the one who has a fuckin' problem on their fuckin' phone! [looks at the scenery for a few seconds] You know, usually, I'm afraid to tell you what I really think, but you wanna know something? [looks over] You wanna- you wanna know what I really think? [at no point did Strong Woman remove her Box, and he just drops it.]
[The Park County Recreation Center, day. The doctor is seated with several couples who need help - Tweek and Craig, Liane and Cartman, Ryan and Sarah, Tolkien and Steve. Craig, Cartman, Sarah, and Steve are wearing Buddha Boxes]
DOCTOR
Anxiety can make you feel unable to cope. But living with someone who has anxiety can be a bit of a roller coaster as well. We have to support our loved ones with their anxiety and try to understand their illness.
TWEEK
I just feel that Craig has changed so much lately! He barely even talks to me anymore!
DOCTOR
Well, because his anxiety make him feel like anything he says might sound wrong. That's why we must nurture our loved ones, so they feel safe.
LIANE
Eric, I just feel like you have so much to offer the world, and it kills me that you're so afraid to let your inner you shine.
CARTMAN
[talking to his Buddha Box] Heh heh, that guy's such a douche. What was that... what was that one show he was on?
DOCTOR
Maybe you, you wanna text him that? [Liane picks up her phone and sends Cartman a message]
CARTMAN
Oh yeah, that's it. B.J. and the Bear. That show was so dumb. What kind of monkey was that, anyway? What was that- what was that monkey he always had- Wait. What the? What the hell is this? Oh God damnit. [lifts up his Box] Mom, will you stop texting me? I'm trying to relax!
DOCTOR
Look, we're all just trying to understand this condition, and it's like you're not listening!
CARTMAN
We're doing everything we can to keep our anxiety under control! Do you think I even wanna be here right now?! I am freaking out!
TOLKIEN
Can we go now?
CARTMAN
[to his Buddha Box] Heheh, yeah. That's pretty cool.
[A construction site, day. The workers sit around until the foreman walks up]
FOREMAN
Hey! Hey, what's goin' on here?! Why aren't you people workin'?!
LABORER 1
We can't keep buildin', sir. We got a bunch of protesters who won't let us work.
FOREMAN
Protesters? Who?
LABORER 1
Ah, it's just a bunch of PC babies who think building this thing is wrong. [leads the foreman to the babies, who are all crying]
FOREMAN
All right, all right! What do you PC babies want? [the crying continues]
LABORER 1
I guess they're upset because the new viaduct is being financed by a state rather than a county institution.
FOREMAN
Aw, come on PC Babies! Why does that matter?! [the crying continues]
LABORER 1
I guess the state refused to finance a proposed program on race-relation education, an they see it as hypocritical.
FOREMAN
God damnit, not everyone cares about race-relation programs! Come on, PC Babies! We got a job to do! [the babies aren't budging and continue to cry]
[Park County Police Station. One officer walks around with a Buddha Box on his head while a desk officer talks to PC Principal and Strong Woman]
DESK OFFICER
All right, all right, just calm down, lady! You want to file a missing persons report?
STRONG WOMAN
No! No, we don't want to file anything specific. We just need help finding some PC babies.
DESK OFFICER
PC babies? They usually hang out at the liberal arts colleges. You could find some there.
STRONG WOMAN
Nono, it's five specific PC babies.
DESK OFFICER
Tony, wasn't there a report of some PC babies down at the Mexican border?
STRONG WOMAN
No! No, these PC babies wouldn't have gotten that far! They can barely walk. I'm their mother.
DESK OFFICER
Hokay, okay. Last name?
STRONG WOMAN
Woman.
DESK OFFICER
First name?
STRONG WOMAN
[with a breaking voice] Strong.
DESK OFFICER
Okay, and you're the father?
BOTH
NO!
PC PRINCIPAL
I'm her superior at work!
STRONG WOMAN
Don't be ridiculous!
PC PRINCIPAL
You think I took advantage of my position?!
STRONG WOMAN
I'm not some two-bit floozy who goes around sleeping with her boss! I am a strong woman! Those kids were born naturally by in-vitro fertilization. [they begin to talk over]
PC PRINCIPAL
I'm not Harvey Weinstein, all right?! I have nothing but respect for females at my workplace, and I would never compromise that position!
STRONG WOMAN
We'll uh, see what we can do. In the meantime you'll just have to take a seat and wait. [they go and find two seats next to a man wearing a Buddha Box. They look around, find some Buddha Boxes on the floor, and put them on.]
[Pi Pi's Water Park, day. A line of people awaits a ride down a water slide called "Hyperbowl". At the head of the line now are Cartman, Kyle, and Stan. Cartman has his Buddha Box on and isn't getting on the slide]
KYLE
Go! [no reaction] GO! [thumps the Box to get Cartman's attention]
CARTMAN
What do you want?
KYLE
Go down the slide or get out of the way!
CARTMAN
You think I even want to be here, Kyle?! My therapist told me I need to force myself to go out and do things to overcome my anxiety!
KYLE
[to a nearby lifeguard] Can we move him, please?! [the lifeguard is revealed to be wearing a Buddha Box]
CARTMAN
Oh! Oh, I see! People with anxiety shouldn't be allowed at water parks. Is that it, Kyle? [jumps out of line] Hey everybody! Just so you know, Kyle thinks people with anxiety should just stay home! Yeah! I'm trying to come out of my shell, but Dr. Kyle here is just worried about his place in line.
[Pi Pi's New York Splash, later. Cartman is sunning himself on a towel poolside with his Buddha Box.]
KYLE
[approaching] Get! Off! My! Towel! [knocks the Buddha Box off Cartman's head] Get off my towel!
CARTMAN
God damnit! I seriously can't get a minute of peace! [goes to flip his Box upright as Kyle folds the towel up] Why is it that people who don't have a Buddha Box are always flipping Buddha Boxes off the heads of people with anxiety?!
KYLE
[Stan, Clyde, and Tolkien look on] I got news for you, Cartman! Everyone has anxiety! Everyone gets nervous! Everyone is afraid being around people! Everyone has feelings they'd rather stay home alone! And you know what they do? They get over it. And they stop being a piece of shit!
CARTMAN
[subdued] Everyone has anxiety?
KYLE
Yes!
CARTMAN
Oh my God. I know what I have to do now. Yo-you're right, Kyle! You're right! [hurries away]
KYLE
What? No. No! What did I just do?
STAN
Should have just let him be on his phone, dude.
[Spinny Mountain Records, day]
RECORD PRODUCER
You know what the kids like today? They like music that matters! I think you guys got what it takes to be the next big thing! The PC Babies! [the babies cry] That's what I'm talkin' about! That stuff is raw! Everyone loves you, PC Babies! We're gonna make you famous!
[The recording booth, moment later.]
BRUCE
All right, PC Babies, let's hear what you got. [Music plays as the babies start thrashing about and cry. Riley's on drums, Bailey's on banjo, Harper's on the piano, River is on the triangle, and Emory is on the xylophone. After a few seconds of recording, Bruce and the record producer hi-five each other.]
[South Park Police Station, day. The desk officer is writing on a clipboard while listening to the radio]
DJ
All right, South Park, and now here's that special treat we told you about. Live with us in the studio is a hot new band: The PC Babies. They're gonna perform their new song, which is about the injustice of white people in dreadlocks. It's called "Weeaaagh." [the song recorded earlier plays. The desk officers starts to move his head and snap his fingers to the music. Strong Woman and PC Principal eventually notice]
STRONG WOMAN
[raises her Buddha Box] Riley?
PC PRINCIPAL
[raises his Buddha Box] Tha-that's Bailey!
DESK OFFICER
[continues moving his head and snapping his fingers] It's the PC Babies. Guess they're all the rage now.
PC PRINCIPAL
Cone on! [the couple bolts from their chairs]
[The Mayor's Office, day. Cartman is talking to the Mayor and her aides, now sporting a shaved head, wearing a bathrobe and towel like a Buddhist monk, with his Buddha Box beside him]
CARTMAN
To quiet one's mind, one must have a dialog with one's self. I have found enlightenment. But there are so many others who suffer. It's very important to take the time to shut out the outside world. In the Hindu religion, there's a saying, "Namaste." It means "fuck you, I have anxiety." At first I thought it was only a few of us, but then something was said to me by Kyle. He said "Eric, my friend, everyone has anxiety." I know what you're thinking: "Fuck Kyle." And normally I would agree with you, but hear his words. Everyone has anxiety. We must recognize this disease as an epidemic. Yes, fuck Kyle, but Mayor, we have to raise money to get everyone who has anxiety the tools they need to cope.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
And how do YOU think we get that money? How do YOU suggest we do this?
CARTMAN
Namaste.
JOHNSON
Na-ma-ste.
CARTMAN
Fuck you too.
[WXFU 88.3, day. The secretary has a Buddha Box on her head. The babies and the record producer step off the elevator and head towards the exit.]
RECORD PRODUCER
That was far out, PC Babies! You really rocked the airwaves! Now come on! We got a photo shoot at 5! [PC Principal and Strong Woman burst through the doors]
PC PRINCIPAL
Kids! [they run past the producer towards the kids.]
STRONG WOMAN
You're okay! Thank God!
RECORD PRODUCER
Who the hell are you??
STRONG WOMAN
[her and PC Principal pick up the babies] I'm their... vice principal.
PC PRINCIPAL
Yea, and ah-I'm their principal. We need to get these kids back to school.
RECORD PRODUCER
You can't do that! These are the PC Babies! Don't you know how big they are?! In just one day they protested a bar, stopped construction of a problematic viaduct, and wrote a hit single about cultural appropriation!
STRONG WOMAN
They.... did all that?
PC PRINCIPAL
Oh my God. They had their first protests... and we missed it. We missed everything because... we were on our phones.
STRONG WOMAN
I've always used the phone as a way to deal with the stress of having babies nobody could know the truth about, but... it's only made it worse.
PC PRINCIPAL
You know what we have to do, right?
STRONG WOMAN
Yeah, I think so.
[South Park Elementary, cafeteria, day. a PTA meeting is taking place]
PC PRINCIPAL
All right everyone, listen up. The vice principal and I have been discussing student health, and it's our firm belief that they need, and what we all need, is less time on our phones. [the attendees are shown, every last one of them in a Buddha Box tapping away on their phones.] Yes, yes I know it's an unpopular idea, but just hear me out, please. Our phones are the cause of stress, not the relief from it. We are banning phones and Buddha Boxes, and we suggest you all strictly limit their use at home as well. [continued constant tapping]
STRONG WOMAN
[observing the room] I don't think anyone's listening to you.
PC PRINCIPAL
Yeah... Nobody's listening. And nobody's watching. [puts down the microphone]
STRONG WOMAN
I guess we can wait and ban the boxes tomorrow? [they kiss]
[Montage. "Today" by Brad Paisley begins to play. While they kiss, people on the sidewalk in front of the school walk around wearing Buddha Boxes.PC Principal check to see if the coast is clear, then pulls Strong Woman and the five babies out. With everyone wearing Buddha Boxes, the family walks around town happy and free. Next they walk through Downtown. A man crosses the street and is struck by a car, flipping over it and landing on his stomach. Both driver and pedestrian are wearing Buddha Boxes. The parents just gather up the PC babies, knowing they're safe from harm. Next, they're having a picnic at the park. Next, they're in Aspen skiing down the bunny slope. One of the babies slips, and everyone else follows suit. Next, they walk past a fire pit in the lodge. Last scene is of the family eating at Buca de Fagoncini]
BRAD PAISLEY
You keep brushing that hair back out of your eyes
And it just keeps falling and so do I
I am feeling like the luckiest man alive
Today
And I don't know about tomorrow
Right now the whole world feels right
And the memory of a day like today
Can get you through the rest of your
life
End of Buddha Box

script:Unfulfilled

[The Stotch garage, day. Butters is working on his bike, trying to make it stand out]
BUTTERS
Oh, boy! This is looking so great. [Stephen enters and takes a safety vest from the coat rack by the door] Hey, Dad! The big bike parade is this weekend. How's it look? First prize is $50!
STEPHEN
[frustrated] What are you saying, that our family needs cash?! I'm busting my ass trying to make ends meet! You wanna go live with Kim Kardashian?! She's better than me 'cause she's got money?! Fuck you, son! [leaves and slams the door. Butters' smile stays]
[The Stotch kitchen, moments later. Stephen enters and puts on the vest]
LINDA
Butters really loves that bike parade.
STEPHEN
[frustrated] I don't need to be reminded every ten minutes that money's tight! [Linda puts her hands together and looks down. He sighs] I'm sorry. It's just this new job. It can be such a grind.
LINDA
[consoles him] You work too hard at that place.
STEPHEN
[takes Linda's hands and holds them] Kids these days just don't understand how much their parents break their back to provide.
GRUFF WORKER
[from outside] Come on, Stotch! [Stephen goes to the front door and opens it]
[Stotch Residence, exterior. Outside, the gruff worker stands in front of a copper colored sedan, along with Stuart McCorrmick and one of the town rednecks. All three are wearing safety vests.]
STUART
You're drivin' carpool today or not?
GRUFF WORKER
Gotta get down factory before the bell!
STEPHEN
[he briefly holds Linda's hand before leaving] Goodbye, Linda.
LINDA
Don't let that place work you to death.
[Montage, set to "Sixteen Tons" by Tennessee Ernie Ford. The four men drive to their new jobs - at the Amazon Fulfillment Center. All workers drive through checkpoints and then park. They go through turnstiles that only turn one way. The scenes then focus on Stephen, who's shown lifting boxes onto a waiting cart. Other scenes show other parts of packaging that Stephen is performing. Then they show him and other employees eating lunch at the cafeteria. Stephen has earphones on while eating his lunch and then subscribes to Amazon Prime music. Then scenes of automated robots working alongside the workers. A few hours more of this and Stuart goes home for the day. He pulls up to his driveway and brings Butters some things from Amazon, including Amazon Prime TV. He then goes to the kitchen to give Linda a new hand blender. At bedtime, Linda looks at her phone while Stephen is at the computer ordering a desk lamp on Amazon. Next day, the whole thing starts over again. The four men carpool to work, Stephen is at a receiving workstation then the workday is filmed in time-lapse photographs. Most of that time, Stephen is shown standing in one place. Another scene shows the outgoing boxes being stamped with the shipping information, then being sorted to their destinations. Some packages are being sent through Amazon Prime Air, the new drone delivery service. The last scene shows Stephen driving onto his driveway and getting out just in time to see a drone deliver another package to his door. He picks it up and gives it to Butters in the garage. It's a new horn for his bicycle]
TENNESSEE ERNIE FORD
Some people say a man is made outta mud
A poor man's made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
And the straw boss said "Well, a-bless my soul"

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the canebrake by an ol' mama lion
Can't no-a high-toned woman make me walk the line

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
[The neighborhood. Butters takes his bike out for a spin. It's got a new horn as well as reflective stars on the wheels, some playing cards sticking to a clothespin attached to the bike form.]
BUTTERS
[joyfully] Yeah! Yippie! [Stan and friends sit on the curb. Butters honks his horn as he passes by] Hey, fellas, what'dya think? [Cartman, wearing his Buddha Box, lifts it up and looks]
STAN
Think about what?
BUTTERS
How my decorations are coming. The big bike parade is this weekend.
CARTMAN
Bike parade? That's so dumb.
BUTTERS
Well, you won't think it's dumb when I win first prize. I'm goin' all out this year. I'll finally beat Larry Zewiski.
STAN
Dude, nobody cares about a stupid bike parade.
LARRY
Hey, Stotch! [everybody looks over. Larry's on a tricycle, which has several flags on it, with four rockets strapped to the rear wheels, and he's exuding confidence] You gettin' pumped for the big bike parade? [Cartman lifts up his Buddha Box and looks over] Yeah, I'm pretty excited, I guess.
PORSCHE
Wow! Hey, nice bike, Larry.
MERCEDES
Are you gonna be in the bike parade?
LARRY
Yeah, I'm thinkin' about it. [the boys just stare.] Come on, girls. I'll show you my blue ribbons. Later, Stotch. Sucka! [he and the girls leave]
BUTTERS
[head lowered] Well, anyway... [looks at the boys] well, I'm gettin' some more things for my bike too. [lowers his head again] Um... I'll see ya, fellas. [walks away slowly. The boys watch him leave]
[Amazon Fulfillment Center. In the main shopping area, Stephen shows the Tweeks the ropes]
STEPHEN
So this is where all the main boxing and transferring happens. I'm excited to have you guys working here at the fulfillment center, Mr. and Mrs. Tweek.
RICHARD
We really didn't have a choice. Since the fulfillment center opened, me and my wife's coffee business has gone belly-up.
STEPHEN
Yeah, people are ordering everything online these days. That's why you'll find a lot of familiar faces working here. [they walk by Mr. Slave, who's preparing boxes for packing. He waves to them before returning back to work] Everything's automated and timed to precision to get people's orders out to them as soon as possible. This is Josh, he'll be your section manager.
JOSH
Howdy, folks.
STEPHEN
In these warehouses, there are over one million items, from toothpaste to Go Karts, and it's the work of both humans and machines that make the work possible. [a bos-laden machine runs into Josh and carries him away screaming.] You'll get a message on your device which item to get, then get it to one of our loaders, and the machines do the rest. [an alarm goes off and red lights blink. Everyone stops what they're doing and looks around]
BEARDED WORKER
We got another one!
STEPHEN
Josh! [Josh becomes a pinball among the machines and screams every time another machine carries him away. Stephen and the other workers run up to a chainlink fence] Hang on, Josh! [Josh is now in the conveyor system being knocked around like a package] Shut it down! Shut it down! [a beefy worker presses the emergency shut-off button, but it fails]
BEEFY WORKER
It's not shuttin' down. [a shipping label is stamped onto the crotch area on Josh's pants. He goes down a roller slide and stands up, at which point he's wrapped up in thin plastic sheets. He's then sent down a chute to a vat of plastic peanuts that whirls him around until he disappears into it.]
JOSH
Aaaarargargar!
STEPHEN
Whenever there's a workplace accident, you need to fill out a 1081 form. [pulls out a copy of the form]
[Kenny's house at the Historic SoDoSoPa ruins, day. Kenny is now working on his bike with the same kinds of trimmings Butters used. He's painting his bike blue. Cartman shows up with Stan and Kyle, while Kenny has his back towards the garage door]
CARTMAN
What are you doing?
KENNY
[quickly turns around and then tries to hide the spray can] (What?! You scared me, guys! Wassup?)
STAN
"Wassup" is I thought we agreed bike parades are stupid.
KENNY
(Bike parades ARE stupid.)
CARTMAN
Don't lie, Kenny! You saw that Larry kid scoring chicks with his bike, heard about the cash prize, and you decided to do the bike parade behind our backs! I know 'cause I thought the same thing!
STAN
Me too.
CARTMAN
[looks down, then wanders off as somber music plays] Jesus. Is this really what it's come down to, you guys? Whatever happened to *us*?
KYLE
What do you mean?
CARTMAN
It used to always be the four of us. Always. Now Stan's moved to a farm. I have anxiety. Kenny? Nobody really talks to Kenny. And then there's just... Kyle. We used to do everything together. What if we did this like the old days?
KYLE
[music picks up] Four bikes, one common theme.
STAN
We could totally own the bike parade.
KENNY
(Yeah!)
CARTMAN
If we order everything online, we can have it delivered tomorrow! [gets on his phone] We need props, pyrotechnics, the works!
STAN
[pulls out his phone and starts tapping away] Yeah, and we gotta order some badass spokes and those wheel bumpers!
KYLE
[pulls out his phone and starts tapping away] I'll start looking for costumes! What theme are we thinking?
CARTMAN
Kenny, get on your mom's laptop and start ordering streamers, sparklers and rockets! Make sure everyone ships Next Day Delivery! This is gonna be just like the old times, you guys!
[Amazon Fulfillment Center, exterior, dusk. As the Fulfillment Center employees leave for the night, Celtic music plays nearby at Crunchy's Micro Brew.]
[Crunchy's Microwbrew, interior. Fulfillment Center employees have a drink and chat among each other, while a group of Irish musicians play on stage.]
IRISH SINGERS
Workin' me fingers to the bone,
I need me a drink before goin' home.
Be back in the mornin',
pack boxes at dawn.
Workin' for Amazon
STEPHEN
Can I have a beer, please? Whatcha got on tap?
BARKEEP
Amazon, Amazon light, and Amazon IPA.
STEPHEN
Gimme Amazon Light. I'm a Prime member. [holds up an Amazon credit card]
GRUFF WORKER
[now with both arms bandaged up] What the fook are we doin', anyway? Breakin' our backs! Loadin' up forklifts! Gettin' paper cuts from boxes! And for what?! A measly paycheck that just barely covers our online purchases.
STEPHEN
Yeah, well, we should be thankful we even have jobs, huh? Before the fulfillment center opened, we really didn't have anything.
GRUFF WORKER
We had our dignity!
STUART
[speaks up] Hey everyone! Everyone, listen! [music and all conversations stop] Amazon just posted a statement about Josh's accident. They're calling it "human error" [chatter picks up] "Amazon regrets the recent workplace accident and is working to better train its workers so that no future accidents occur."
BEARDED WORKER
Who do they think they are?!
GRUFF WORKER
It was the bloody machines!
STEPHEN
[nervous chuckle] Okay, hold on, everyone. I'm sure there's an explanation.
STUART
This is what we've been reduced to! We are the backbone that makes the fulfillment center work! Maybe they should see what it would be like if we didn't show up for work! [all cheer]
SKEETER
We'll do it for Josh, and so what happened to him never happens to anyone else.!
STEPHEN
Hold on, guys. [nervous chuckle] M-My son has a big bike parade coming up. I... I can't just not show up to work now.
STUART
[Comes up to Stephen and puts his finger in his face] What's more important to you, Stotch? A bike parade, or Josh?![leaves]
STEPHEN
A bike parade.
STUART
Amazon workers, we are on strike! [the workers roar back in approval and cheer, while Stephen looks around nervously]
[Cartman's house, day. He's still in bed as the sun breaks. It's morning, and his alarm goes off. He sits up and then leaves the bed]
CARTMAN
My stuff's here! [runs out of the room and downstairs] My stuff! My stuff! My stuff my stuff my stuff! [runs by the sofa, where Liane sits, She's sipping coffee.]
LIANE
Mornin' hon.
CARTMAN
Shut up! [opens the front door and looks out, smiling] Stuff? [looks around, then steps out a bit further] Stuff? [One more look, then goes back inside and walks up to Liane] Mom, were there a bunch of packages for me?
LIANE
I don't think anyone's getting packages, sweetie. Look. [Cartman looks at the TV, at the strike against Amazon]
TOM
The Amazon Fulfillment Center has been shut down as hundreds of employees refuse to work. [Behind Tom, an Amazon employee marches behind him and then look into the camera, smiles and point at their signs. Another employee does the same thing. Stephen is behind them, keeping his head down and looking conflicted] Customers all over the state are wondering where their Amazon orders are, as workers demand more respect and more money. The uprising started with a workplace accident which Amazon blamed on human error. Joining me now is the victim of the accident - Josh Carter. [walks over to Josh, who is now a sentient package. He's been placed atop of a stool.] And Josh, how does it feel to have your accident spark so much upheaval?
JOSH
You know, Tom, I think something like this was bound to happen. There's those at the top who control the means of production, and then there's the working class that enables those means by selling their labor power for wages. When there's conflict, the ruling class tries to blame the working class.
TOM
Can you get out of the box?
JOSH
No, my organs have been compacted, so if the box opens, I spill out and die. I believe the working class needs to revolt against capitalism and bring about socioeconomic emancipation.
TOM
Do you get hot in the box?
[Soth Park City Hall, day. Mayor McDaniels is making an Amazon purchase on her work iMac]
MAYOR MCDANNIELS
[quietly talking to herself] Ship to address, order now... [receives this message] "Usually ships in..." [yells out in anger] four to six weeks?! I can make my own damn towels in four to six weeks! [a knock at the door, and Janson looks in]
JANSON
Mayor, you have a visitor.
MAYOR
Not now, I'm having problems!
JANSON
[Nervously] But Mayor, it's uh, [whispers] Jeff Bezos.
MAYOR
[voice rises] Founder and CEO of Amazon Jeff Bezos?
JANSON
[whispers] Yeah.
MAYOR
Okay, okay, uh, let him in.
JANSON
Right on through here, Mr. Bezos. [Jeff Bezos enters. He has a long neck and a bald, veiny head, suggesting a brain so big blood vessels have to be outside the skull for it to fit. Bezos looks at Janson, and Janson leaves]
MAYOR
[stands up from behind her desk] Mr. Bezos. How great to see you again! [Bezos just looks at her] How have you been?
BEZOS
[telepathically] I wish I was doing better. Please Mayor, have a seat.
MAYOR
Oh, thank you. [she sits in her chair, he takes a seat as well]
MAYOR
I guess you're here because of the... strike.
BEZOS
We had a deal, Mayor. You told me this town would be the perfect place for one of our fulfillment centers.
MAYOR
And it has been. It it gave so many people jobs. [chuckles] And I'm not really sure why everyone is so...
BEZOS
[moves his head ever so slightly] Disgruntled? Dissatisfied? Unamused? Would you like to know why Amazon is so successful? Because the customer is all that matters. Now orders are going unfulfilled all over the state of Colorado. [lowers eyebrows] That makes us look very bad. [raises his eyebrows] It makes YOU look very bad. Perhaps... you should no longer be a Prime member.
MAYOR
[pleading] Please! I-I'm trying to get everyone back to work. I-I'm going to do everything that I can.
BEZOS
Then we have an understanding. [gets up and heads for the door] Goodbye, Mayor. If everyone stays unfulfilled, [turns around and looks at the Mayor] it will be you who pays the price. [opens the door and leaves. The Mayor is left stunned]
[A cloudy day. Cartman opens the door and looks out. No packages. A new montage begins, to the tune of Trey Parker's "Unfulfilled." Cartman goes back inside and closes the door. Mr. Tucker goes and checks his mailbox. No mail or packages. Sheila checks the status of her delivery. Her coffee maker has been delivered, but still en route. A tear runs down her cheek. Mr. Mackey looks outside his window as it starts to rain and sees a FedEx X truck. The driver looks back at him, then lowers his head to the steering wheel. No delivery for Mackey. Jimmy looks at the status of his delivery but finds that it's going to take a month to reach him. He cries at his desk. A smiling Randy goes outside to get his packages, but suddenly, they fade away, revealing that he got nothing and leaves him disappointed. Wendy walks by the kitchen at her home and sees her parents. Wendy's parents sit at the dining room table, looking depressed. No packages for them either. Wendy then looks down and walks away. The strikers put on their protest and hold up their signs, but Stephen's heart isn't in it. He stands still holding a "STAND UP/STRIKE" sign. Kenny opens his front door and checks for packages but finds none. Kyle looks out his front door and finds nothing. He closes his door. An aerial shot of the neighborhood shows no packages anywhere on the front steps of the houses. Ryan walks up to Sarah and thinks of putting his hand on her shoulder, but decides against it and leaves. The fulfillment center sits dark and silent. Officer Brown looks for packages at the front of the police station, but finds nothing. He then sadly closes the door.]
TREY
Unfulfilled.
And now tomorrow's nothing but another day.
Somebody came and took my hopes and dreams away.
and now I'm lost, and unfulfilled.

Curtains close
All we were a distant memory
Somebody just bitch-slapped the smile right off of me.
And here I am, so unfulfilled.

The happiness I knew just got raped and killed.
And all I am is unfulfilled.

Nothing that I have seems like enough
All I'm left to ask is, "Where's my stuff?"
It's sitting somewhere, unfulfilled.
[Last scene is in Cartman's room. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle wait. The door opens and Kenny walks in. The boys jump to meet him]
STAN
Anything? Did you get anything?
KENNY
(No. Nothing.) [the other three sigh]
CARTMAN
I guess it's time to face it. We aren't going to get our stuff.
STAN
Maybe if we reorder everything and have it shipped to a different fulfillment center-
KYLE
There's no time. Let's face it. We can't be in the bike parade.
STAN
No! I refuse to believe we have no other options. Um, what...? What did we do before Amazon?
KENNY
(Well I don't know.)
STAN
I mean, before we could get whatever we wanted, where did we get stuff?
CARTMAN
At the... the ma-, the ma-ma-, the mall.
KYLE
Oh yeah! The mall!
KENNY
(The mall!)
[South Park Mall, day. It sits abandoned and looks dilapidated. The earth has begun to reclaim it. Plants break through the asphalt in the parking lot. Inside, the building is dark and devoid of any lighting and covered with trash and plants. A rat runs around and waits on top of a plant. The doors open and the boys walk in, causing the rat to scurry off.]
CARTMAN
Guess we haven't been to the mall in a while. [as they walk through the mall, Anita Baker's "Sweet Love" plays over the speakers.]
ANITA BAKER
Sweet Love
hear me callin' out your name
I feel no shame;
I'm in love
Oh no no no no no
(Sweet Love)
KYLE
There's nobody here.
STAN
There's gotta be somebody.
CARTMAN
[notices something and points] Look! It's Wiener On A Stick. [a worker pops up behind the counter and hisses, then drops back down. The boys walk up to him]
STAN
Uh, hello?
MALL WORKER 1
[pops back up] Welcome to Wiener On A Stick.
KYLE
Are you the only one still at the mall?
MALL WORKER 1
There are many, and yet none. [other workers come out of the woodwork and hiss]
[The Stotch house, day. Linda is at the sofa knitting while Butters reads Mystery Comics. The front door opens and Stephen enters]
LINDA
There he is! [drops her knitting and goes to Stephen]
BUTTERS
Dad! [drops his comic book and goes to Stephen]
LINDA
How did it go?
STEPHEN
[nervously looks down and holds cap in his hand] They voted to keep striking. There was a run-in, violence between some of the strikers and corporate. They've decided to punish us by taking our status. [turns and walks a few feet away from Linda and Butters] There's no easy way to say this, so I'll... just come out with is then. We're... not Amazon Prime members anymore.
LINDA
Then what are we?
STEPHEN
[turns to face his family] Everyone involved in the strike has been dropped down one level from Prime. We're... we're now Amazon USDA Choice.
LINDA
[covers her mouth as she starts to tear up] That's... fine. We'll be USDA Choice. It's, it's almost as good as Prime.
STEPHEN
[walks up to her and puts his hand on her shoulder] You're a good woman for saying that. But you're a bitch because it's a lie and you're patronizing me. [goes upstairs]
BUTTERS
Mom, eh if I win the first prize in the bike parade, I'll give the money to you guys.
[Stotch residence.The master bedroom, later. Stephen is at his computer, praying]
STEPHEN
Please... I don't know what else to do. My family is all that matters to me. [becomes emotional and starts to tear up] I made a promise to provide for them. What if we never get what we're asking for from the strike? [he's being observed through a hidden camera, on Alexa View] What if they just get others to do all the boxing for us?
[At Amazon HQ, in a purple, alien-like room, Mayor McDaniels looks at the screen with Jeff Bezos]
BEZOS
See how the worker begins to question his determination? Without his Amazon Prime Status, he fluctuates between being and non-being.
STEPHEN
My family has to come first.
BEZOS
Now... torn between memberships, the consumer-worker will reason that the strike is pointless. Prepare a bus. We must make sure that boxers who wish to box have a safe way into the fulfillment center.
[South Park Mall, exterior, day]
[South Park Mall, interior. The boys are still in the abandoned mall as more mall workers emerge from their hiding spots and look at the boys in curiosity]
KYLE
I think maybe it was a bad idea to come here, you guys.
MALL WORKER 2
Why have you come to this place?
STAN
We came because... we need... stuff.
MALL WORKER 3
[emerges from behind a large planter] Do you seek cosmetics? [holds up some make-up brushes]
MALL WORKER 4
[emerges from behind a food court trash can] Do you need puppies? [holds up two puppies wearing bow ties in his arms]
MALL WORKER 5
[comes up behind Stan] Sample of lotion?
STAN
What??
MALL WORKER 5
[lifts up Stan's arm and sprays some onto it] Why, it's lemongrass lavender.
STAN
No! [the worker hisses and goes back into the shadows] No, no, look. We need very specific stuff. There's a big bike parade on Saturday.
[In front of Auntie Jen's, a Cinnaroll and Gamestop employee are excited about the bike parade and talk over each other]
CINNAROLL EMPLOYEE
Ohhh! Bike parade?
HOBBY EMPLOYEE
Bike parade?
GAMESTOP EMPLOYEE
Ohh!
[In front of City Express, Wayne D and a Build-A-Bear employee also show their excitement]
WAYNE D
Ohhh! Bike parade!
BUILD-A-BEAR WORKSHOP EMPLOYEE
[garbled] That's nice!
KYLE
Yeah. And the four of us are actually doing a group theme.
CARTMAN
[steps forward] The changing faces of immigrants in America as told through bicycles.
MALL WORKER 6
So... do you need... SHOES? [holds a couple of shoe boxes]
STAN
[turns to face the mall worker] Yeah. Uh, color-coded specific shoes in four specific sizes.
MALL WORKERS
Aww!
STAN
What?
MALL WORKER 1
[pops his head out from behind the counter.] We do not have the inventory that online wholesalers can provide. [hisses and hides again]
CARTMAN
This is a waste of time, you guys.
KENNY
(Yeah. Shit, let's get the fuck out of here.)
MALL WORKER 7
[emerges from behind a planter holding up a skirt on a hanger] Please! You are the only customers we've had the pleasure of assisting since the fulfillment center opened.
STAN
H-Hold on a minute. You all stay here 'cause you want to work?
MALL WORKER 6
It is... our purpose.
MALL WORKERS
Our purpose.
MALL WORKER 4
Our purpose.
STAN
Wait a minute. You guys... I think I have an idea.
[Amazon Fulfillment Center, day. An overhead view of the parking lot as the strikers and a group of counter protesters are gathered for another day. Both groups are being corralled by police officers.]
TOM
[off screen] A bus with employees wishing to return to work is about to arrive here at the fulfillment center,[the Amazon employees are yelling and holding up signs while the police officers are trying to keep them behind the barriers] and the strikers are not happy. Also, dozens of Amazon customers have shown up.[a large group of counter protesters hold up signs demanding the workers get back to their jobs and deliver their packages are being held back by the police] Angry customers who wish to be fulfilled.
CUSTOMERS
We want our stuff! We want our stuff!
TOM
The customers say the boxers need to return to work because the shutdown is hurting everyone. [Randy is standing next to him]
RANDY
I have a weed business to run! I need my shit from Amazon to make it all work!
JOSH
At what cost, sir?! Do you care that personal worth is being reduced by capitalists to exchange value?!
RANDY
Oh yeah, that's typical rhetoric from a Marxist box.
JOSH
Free trade is not free-dom! Perhaps socialism IS the answer!
TOM
If you pay for shipping, can you go anywhere you want?
STUART
[pointing] Here comes the bus!
STRIKERS
[all turn to face the bus. Stephen is the only passenger in it, looking mighty lonely] Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs!
STUART
Hey, it's Stotch! [the bus stops]
GRUFF WORKER
Ya can't do it, Stotch! Ya damned us all!
STEPHEN
[lowers a window] Don't you understand? It's not about me! It's my son!
GRUFF WORKER
If those orders get fulfilled, then we got nothin'!
STEPHEN
He's just a kid! He wants to be in the bike parade!
GRUFF WORKER
My son's in the bike parade too! [his voice begins to crack] He's got... little tassels off the back of his seat. Tiny flags stickin' out the handlebars. But he deserves more, Stotch! If we don't make our stand now, he doesn't have a chance. He'll get fookin' third or fourth place or just a fookin' participation ribbon!
STEPHEN
[emotional] I'm sorry. [the bus moves forward again]
GRUFF WORKER
Stotch!
[The fulfillment center, inside. Stephen gets to work doing all the fulfillments himself. Mayor McDaniels and Jeff Bezos look on from a catwalk above the factory floor]
BEZOS
It is... not as I expected. Only one consumer worker broke through the picket lines. Your townspeople are more stubborn than I thought.
MAYOR
They're... prideful people, yes.
BEZOS
Perhaps I should give up. How I long to return to Bezos and touch butts with my wife. [the factory phone rings and he answers it] Amazon Fulfillment Center.
[South Park Mall, exterior. The boys are in the parking lot outside the mall. Stan is on his phone and somehow, Bezos' telepathy reaches Stan's ears]
STAN
Uh yeah, hi. We ordered a bunch of stuff and we haven't gotten it.
BEZOS
[frustrated] Yes, yes, the workers are striking. We're fucking working on it!
STAN
No, that's actually why we're calling. We know a whole bunch of people who can come work for you.
BEZOS
[his eyes widen as he thinks a moment] Is that so? Now those fools will pay!
STAN
What fools will pay?
BEZOS
Uh no, sorry, um... you say you have worker-consumers? willing to box?
STAN
Yeah, but listen: we want our stuff! We ordered a bunch of shit for the bike parade, and if we get you workers, we want them to deliver our stuff first!
BEZOS
Very well. Stay right where you are. [hangs up, goes back to the Mayor, and stares at her for a few seconds] You didn't tell me there was a bike parade.
MAYOR
I didn't think it was relevant.
BEZOS
Everything is relevant when it comes to customers. [goes to Alexa View and waves his hand across the screen. Butters is shown working on his bike again]
[Dramatic music begins as Bezos smiles after looking at the Alexa View. Josh begins his speech off screen.]
JOSH
The history of this world...
[A panning shot of the employees yelling and protesting outside the fulfillment center.]
JOSH
is the history of class struggles.
[A panning shot of the customers yelling and holding up their signs outside the fulfillment center]
JOSH
Alienated from the products of their labor...
[Stotch Residence, garage. Butters is working on his bike, looking at his bike spokes.]
JOSH
from their fellow laborers and from their very essence.
[Zewiski Residence, garage. Larry is adding more flags to his bike while Mercedes and Porsche admire him from outside.]
JOSH
The oppressed worker will eventually strike back at those capitalists who control the means of production.
[South Park Mall, interior. The four boys go back inside the mall. The mall workers emerge as the light from outside hits them]
JOSH
We have nothing to lose but our chains.
[Crunchy's Microbrew, interior. The strikers are standing and paying attention]
JOSH
We will unite in revolution.
GRUFF WORKER
And if others try to break through the picket line?
JOSH
[a box on a stool] Nothing else can be allowed into the fulfillment center, no matter what the cost.
SKEETER
We're ready to follow you, Josh.
JOSH
Then follow me to Hell.
End of Unfulfilled


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:This week the Amazon workers are still on strike and now no one is getting their Christmas packages. Despite the chaos at the Amazon Fulfillment Center, the Bike Parade is still on. The boysâ€™ chance of winning is in jeopardy when Kenny resists commercialism in solidarity with the striking workers.

script:Bike Parade

[Kyle's bed, sunrise. Kyle is still in bed when his alarm goes off. he wakes up and jumps off his bed, grabs his phone, and runs downstairs. Bright music plays. Ike peeks out from his room and sees Kyle run by. Kyle opens the front door and sees all the Amazon stuff he had purchased and was waiting for. He breaks out into a grin]
KYLE
Yehehes! Yeessss!
GERALD
[comes out from the kitchen] What is it, Kyle?
KYLE
I got fulfilled! It's all the stuff I ordered for the bike parade. [his phone rings and he answers it] Yeah?
[Cartman Residence, living room. Eric is excited as he is surrounded by his Amazon packages and talks to Kyle on his Iphone]
CARTMAN
Kyle, did you get your stuff?! I got my stuff! Yeah, dude! [grabs one of his packages and holds it] Stan and Kenny got their stuff too! Bring it all over to my house! We gotta get ready for the bike parade!
[Broflofski residence, living room. Kyle runs back inside with one of packages]
GERALD
Hey, were my boxes there too?
KYLE
No, Dad. These were special deliveries from Jeff Bezos. We helped Amazon with their strike, and he had our orders shipped.
GERALD
Jeff Bezos? The founder and CEO of Amazon?
[A close up of the Amazon Echo in the living room is shown while Kyle talks to Gerald]
KYLE
[giggles] Yeah. We helped him find workers to work during the strike.
[Remote location. Jeff Bezos is shown eavesdropping on their conversation as well as several others on some dated hi-fi equipment. The conversations are heard through the massive headphones he is wearing.]
KYLE
So he found our orders and had them sent to us.
GERALD
Well, can he find my packages too? [Static noise is heard as Bezos begins to turn the dial to another frequency]
WOMAN 1
No, I know. They said the workers are still on strike. They don't know when our orders- [turns the dial]
MAN 1
Alexa, can I have my stuff shipped from a different ful-? [turns the dial]
MAN 2
No, that's a bad dog, Banjo! Bad dog! [turns the dial]
WOMAN 2
[moaning] Oh, yes. Oh, oh, o- [turns the dial]
STUART
Jeff Bezos?! [Bezos stops and listens in intently] Are you freakin' kiddin' me?! Why is Jeff Bezos sending you packages?
[McCormick residence, living room. A close up of their Amazon Echo Dot is shown while Stuart continues to berate Kenny in the background. Carol and Karen McCormick are standing behind Stuart and observing. The camera eventually focuses on Kenny and Stuart]
STUART
Do you even care there's a strike going on?!
KENNY
(No, Dad. These are all for the bike parade.)
STUART
Bike parade?! You dad is part of the strike, you little shit! [Kenny opens a box and gives Stuart the finger] This whole town is suffering because of Amazon and you're out worrying about a bike parade! [Kenny pulls out a small Statue of Liberty.]
[Tegridy Farms, day. Randy and Sharon are in the kitchen. Sharon is sitting at the dinner table and rests her head on her right hand as Randy rants and paces back and forth.]
RANDY
I can't even believe you would say that, Sharon!
SHARON
Randy, it's time to face it. Your weed farm idea didn't work. You barely sell to two people a day.
RANDY
It's the stupid Amazon strike! I rely on things for marketing, Sharon! A small business needs products for exposure, and until those assholes go back to work, small businesses are gonna suffer! [someone knocks on the front door.]
MAN 3
[Randy looks over] Ex-excuse me. Could I buy some weed?
RANDY
[leaves the kitchen for the front door] Aw yeah yeah, Of course.
[Tegridy Farms, living room. Randy walks in and goes to the coffee table which has some bottles and a fanny pack that he picks up. Towlie is sitting on the couch reading a magazine.]
RANDY
Out early today, huh? [arrives at the door and rummages through the fanny pack]
MAN 3
Yeah it's this stupid Amazon strike. None of my orders are getting fulfilled, and I just need something to take the edge off.
RANDY
Yeah, tell me about it.
MAN 4
[appearing at the farm's entrance] Hey, are you selling weed?
RANDY
Uh, yeah.
MAN 4
[arrives at the door as man 3 leaves] My wife is going nuts not getting her packages. I told her I'd find her some kush.
RANDY
[walks back to the table to pick up more weed] Yeah, the Amazon strike really sucks. [a truck full of strikers pulls up]
DRIVER
[gets out with his sign] Hey man, we're about to go spend a day in the picket line. Can you sell us some weed?
RANDY
You're strikers?
MAN 4
[turns around to face the driver] Well why don't you guys get back to work so we can get our packages?
DRIVER
[points at him] Hey, fuck you buddy!
RANDY
Okay, okay, hold on. Uh, let me got some more weed. [notices more people driving up and walking to his door] Huh.
[Amazon Fulfillment Center, day. The strike continues and local media is covering it]
TOM
[off screen] It's Day 5 of the Amazon Fulfillment Center strike. [The police are shown trying to keep the strikers corralled] Nothing has been resolved, and there is ever-mounting tension between the striking Amazon workers [a close up of the strikers] and the people who want their stuff. [a close up of the townspeople demanding their stuff]
[News Studio. Tom is sitting at the news desk and continues his report.]
TOM
Josh Carter is an Amazon employee who suffered a horrific workplace accident. In order to drum up support for the strike, he's recently FedExed himself to Washington. [Josh is on top of a stool with the White House behind him] How are things going, Josh?
JOSH
They're going well, Tom. Thank you. You know, what happened to me could happen to any worker at a fulfillment center. I'm speaking to Congress here and then heading back to Colorado tomorrow via UPS.
TOM
Meanwhile, Amazon says it's training new workers to replace the strikers. However, because the workers previously worked at a mall, they've had no human contact for quite some time.
[Amazon Fulfillment Center, day. Stephen briefs the new workers on the center's operations]
STEPHEN
Welcome to the fulfillment center. I'm your floor manager, Stephen Stotch. [the new employees hiss and growl back.] Being a fulfilled isn't hard. Uh, you just follow a few basic steps. [Mall Worker 1 rises up and hisses, then drops back down behind a lift] You start by getting an order on your fulfillment device. [taps on his device] Uh, it's order 6503. Mrs. Sandy Milner wants a Luminart coffee grinder. So you send that order to the first available transaction robot. [drives the robot left out of a parking spot] Okay, the robot will locate the grinder and bring it to the packing area. [The robot stops and drops tee coffee maker onto a conveyor which is being manned by Mall Worker 7. she watches it roll by, and it reaches the mall worker at the end of the belt] Now, put the coffee grinder in the box to fulfill the order. [the worker makes a move but stops himself] Go on. Put it in. [the worker grabs the grinder, stands up, and put it in the box.]
MALL WORKER 8
This isn't very fulfilling.
STEPHEN
Sure it is. You just gotta get into it, okay? That's one order down, we have [taps his device] 12,400 more to go. [more hissing from the new hires]
[Tegridy Farms, day. Business has picked up at Randy's place as indicated by a long line of customers. Randy is now selling from a stand with Towlie helping him out]
RANDY
[speaking with an accent] All right, there you go, friend. That's an ounce of weed, and thanks for supportin' small business. Next?
MAN 5
Hey, could you sell me more than an ounce?
RANDY
Sorry friend, that's the law. Us simple farmin' folk respect the law and each other.
MAN 5
No, it's fine. I'll just go over to the Anderson Weed Farm and buy more there.
RANDY
[looks over to the Anderson Weed Farm, which has a no-limit purchase sign on its stand. He then drops his accent] Well don't buy weed from them. Their weed sucks.
MAN 5
It's a long way to drive out here. Need to make it worth my while. [leaves]
[The barn, later. Randy paces the floor there looking concerned, while Towlie is seated on top of the table, stoned. Both have a joint in their hand.]
RANDY
Shit! This whole Amazon strike has more people smoking weed than ever. We have to make sure Tegridy Weed stays ahead of the competition!
TOWELIE
[takes a puff] We need to find a way to get the weed to the people.
RANDY
Yeah, like a, like a delivery service. Some way so people don't have to drive out here and even see the other weed farms!
TOWELIE
You know what they got? They got these e-scooters nowadays.
RANDY
You mean the things that almost killed us all on Halloween? Yeah, I 'member. [takes a puff from his joint]
TOWELIE
What if we use e-scooters to get the weed directly to the customers?
RANDY
Oh shit. We could have Tegridy all over town.
[The Stotch house, after sunset. Stephen arrives home with his head down. He heads inside and is surprised to see a lot of Amazon boxes in the living room]
STEPHEN
What the--?
LINDA
Stephen! Stephen! It's a miracle! [she gives him a hug]
STEPHEN
I don't understand.
BUTTERS
[pulls out a gold covered bicycle by its handle from a box] Look Dad, a whole new bicycle! I'll win the bike parade for sure!
LINDA
You must have gotten our Prime membership back!
STEPHEN
I guess I did. The bigwigs promoted me to manager. I'm been training new employees. [A close up of their Amazon Echo is shown]
[Remote location. Jeff Bezos is shown eavesdropping again. The conversations are heard through the massive headphones he is wearing.]
STEPHEN
When did all this stuff arrive?
LINDA
It just came a few hours ago. [Bezos turns the dial while some static noise is heard] Oh Stephen, you did it!
[The remote location. Bezos smiles as he takes his headphones off and get up. Mayor McDaniels is revealed to be the same room and he approaches her.]
BEZOS
Your townspeople are beginning to learn that cooperation is rewarded by fulfillment. Now there's only one true enemy who stands in our way. Tonight he's giving a talk on Marxist theory.
[The talk, evening. An audience filled studio with Josh, in a box, on a pedestal with a glass of water on a stool nearby.]
JOSH
How is the common worker kept submissive? By the institutions and the ideology of the bourgeoisie. We only ask for compassion, for a fair share of the fruits of our labors. [Kenny, sitting next to Stuart, is bored and sighs]
[Larry's driveway, day. Larry is showing off his bike to three girls, one of them is Sally Darson]
LARRY
Yeah, it's this Saturday. Everyone's gonna watch. You girls should come check it out. Yeah, it's gonna be a pretty nice bike parade, I suppose.
BUTTERS
[riding up] Hey, Larry. [his gold and diamond encrusted pentacycle is quite blinged out, and he wears a matching crown] You gettin' excited for the bike parade? [Larry and the girls are stunned] Yeah, I guess I'm lookin' forward to it.
GIRL
Wow.
BUTTERS
I guess my bike could be in the bike parade. I... I hadn't really thought about it.
LARRY
Uh, y-you girls check out the flag on the back of my bike? They, they're silk.
BUTTERS
Oh yeah. [presses a button on the handlebars and busts out the peacock feathers, complete with the shake at the end for maximum spread.] I'll see you there, Larry. Later, girls. [turns the bike around and rides away while pressing his bike horn. The girls look at Larry, who is smiling nervously at them and they walk away.]
SALLY
[disappointed, walks away] Hmph!
BUTTERS
[riding along on the street] Yippie! [he passes Towelie, who is on an e-scooter on the sidewalk]
[The Valmer house, moments later. Towelie stops there and knocks on the door. Ryan and Sarah sit on the sofa with nothing to do]
RYAN
Amazon Boxes?! [gets up to check]
SARAH
[sits up] It might be!
RYAN
[opens the door] Yes! [sees no boxes, but looks down] Oh.
TOWELIE
Hello, sir. I have your weed delivery.
RYAN
My what?
SARAH
[squeezes by] Oh, that's mine.
TOWELIE
There you are, ma'am. [hands her a small bottle of weed] Enjoy your Tegridy.
RYAN
You got a-? Are, are we splitting that?
SARAH
Get your own. [goes back inside]
RYAN
Do you have more?
TOWELIE
We're here to please the customer! [hands him one as well]
[Cartman's driveway, day. Triumphant music plays as the boys' project is almost finished. It looks like a plane, with four cockpits - a central one, two side ones, and a front one. Cutouts of all the world's cultures are taped to the connecting rod and wings. It's magnificent]
STAN
Dude, we did it.
KYLE
They look amazing.
CARTMAN
There's no way we can't win, you guys. We are going to kill at the bike parade. We finally did it. We worked together, we overcame adversity, and everything is finally gonna be cool again.
KYLE
[notices Kenny arriving] All right, Kenny's here. [to Kenny] Come on, dude. We're gonna take 'em for a test spin.
KENNY
(Guys, listen to me. I'm not gonna do the bike parade.)
STAN
You're not gonna do the bike parade?
KYLE
Well why not?
KENNY
(It's complicated. I talked to my father and he says it's all a bunch of commodity fetishism.)
STAN
Commodity fetishism?
KENNY
(Yes, it's stupid, but I'm out.) [turns and walks away]
KYLE
Kenny, you can't quit now! We have a four-bike theme!
CARTMAN
Yeah, how do we do the changing face of immigrants in America without the Philippines?!
KENNY
(I can't do it, guys! I quit.) [walks off]
CARTMAN
[panicking, grabs Kenny and pull him back] Kenny, no! You can't do this! We've worked so hard, and we've come so close! Oh my G- Oh my God! My anxiety! My anxiety is going off, you guys!
STAN
Come on, Kenny, don't be a dick!
KENNY
(You guys don't understand! My dad is one of the strikers!) [walks away]
CARTMAN
[gives chase, but then stops and begins to hyperventilate] Oh my God! We did so much! We went through all this and he just quits?! That's it! That's it! I'm gonna shoot up the skewl!
STAN
[calmly, quietly] Don't shoot up the school.
CARTMAN
No, 'cause it's not fair! You work your ass off for nothing, and now my anxiety's back, and I'm gonna shoot up the skeewwwwl!
[Amazon Fulfillment Center, morning. The strike continues.]
BURLY WORKER
Here come the temp workers! Scabs!
STRIKERS
Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! Scabs! [this is repeated over and over. The mall workers in the bus just hiss and growl.]
STEPHEN
[seated now with Gerald] Yeah, it's not always easy being a fulfiller, but I think, eventually, you'll find it's a rewarding job.
GERALD
I don't really care. I just want my stuff. If I have to work at Amazon to get my packages, then so be it.
STUART
[among the strikers, he tries to run and catch up with the bus] Stotch! Hey Stotch! [the bus stops.]
STEPHEN
[Annoyed] What do you want, Stuart?
STUART
I just thought you'd want to know the kind of people you're sellin' out for.
STEPHEN
What are you talking about?
STUART
It's Josh, man! He's gone missing! [Stephen is stunned at the revelation]
[Kyle's garage, day. The project has been dismantled and the boys have taken their pieces and gone home. Kyle, looking very depressed, has taken his bike apart and is repainting it. Stan walks his bike up to Kyle's driveway.]
STAN
How's it going?
KYLE
How's it look like it's going? There's no way we're going to win this stupid bike parade!
STAN
Our bikes aren't so bad.
KYLE
[comes out to the driveway] Face it Stan! Our bikes suck! We're gonna lose! We're gonna be the laughingstock of the whole thing!
CARTMAN
Kyle's right. [the boys turn and see Cartman with his bike and looking down] I already bragged to everyone we were gonna beat them like bitches at the bike parade. We're gonna look like total douchebags. [he moves up closer to where Stan and Kyle are]
STAN
I thought the four of us were unstoppable.
CARTMAN
We are. It's just Kenny fucked us again.
KYLE
I wish there never was a bike parade.
CARTMAN
Yeah. Hey. What if there wasn't?
STAN
What?
CARTMAN
What if the bike parade got cancelled? We're never gonna win the bike parade, but if we get cancelled, then everybody loses.
STAN
How do we get the bike parade cancelled?
CARTMAN
How do you get anything cancelled? You bitch about it being insensitive!
STAN
Hey, yeah. We can go to the Mayor and force her to cancel it.
KYLE
What's offensive about a bike parade?
CARTMAN
"What's offensive about a bike parade?" Kyle, you small-minded piece of shit! We should cancel you just for saying that.
KYLE
Oh, I get it.
STAN
Yeah!
ALL FOUR
Yeah!
CARTMAN
Everybody loses, you guys!
[An empty warehouse, day. Josh sits on a chair all alone, until Jeff walks in with the Mayor. He has a smug look on his face.]
BEZOS
Do you know who I am?
JOSH
[nervously] Yeah. You're Jeff Bezos.
BEZOS
And you are Josh, former Amazon employee who suffered a workplace accident. You were wrongly packaged into a box, and now, if anyone tries to open it, your insides will burst apart. So you seek revenge.
JOSH
This isn't about revenge, Bezos. It's about the production of too many useful things resulting in too many useless people!
BEZOS
See how the box ridicules commercialism in order to try and feel better about itself.
JOSH
Damn you! You made everything nice and convenient, didn't you, Bezos?! But humans are more than consumers!
BEZOS
That's very eloquent... for a box-- [walks towards the entrance doors] A box that is the last thing standing in the way of real economic progress for this town.
JOSH
[whispers] What are you gonna do to me?
BEZOS
I'm not going to do anything to you. Alexa, go ahead. Sent them in.
ALEXA
Okay. [the doors open and a bunch of kids walks in, chatting away]
BEZOS
Hello, children. Uncle Jeff has a surprise for you! Who wants a special present for the bike parade?!
KIDS
Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!...
JOSH
Oh my God...
BEZOS
Whoever opens the box gets what's inside! [the kids run to the box]
JOSH
[panicking] No! No, don't give in to your consumerism, kids! [the kids grab the box and fight over it as Jeff screams a few times] NO! [screams some more. Mayor McDaniels turns around to avoid seeing the inevitable, while Bezos continues to smile as he watches Josh's suffering. One of the kids eventually takes hold of the tattered box]
BOY
It's mine! It's mine! I got it! I get it! [opens the box and gets Josh's blood and guts all over himself. The other kids get splattered as well]
BEZOS
Heheh. [the Mayor finally looks]
[Larry's house, day. He's in the dining room talking to someone]
LARRY
Every year, I win the bike parade. It's the one thing I care about. Now there's kids out there who have better bikes than me because you won't get off your ass and work, Dad!
MR. ZEWISKI
[the gruff worker] Larry, I want to! But I'd be a no-good traitor! Can't you understand?! [his wife stands by the front door]
LARRY
All I understand is that you suck! [turns and runs off. Mr. Zewiski gets up and heads for the front door]
MRS. ZEWISKI
Where are you going?
MR. ZEWISKI
Son's right. Picket line or not, I'm gonna cross it, right now! [opens the door and finds Towelie at his doorstep]
TOWELIE
Hello, sir. I have your weed delivery.
MR. ZEWISKI
Oh, my weed. Forgot I ordered that.
RANDY
[scootin' by. He is wearing a helmet with a large "BUY TEGRIDY WEED" sign on top] Oh hey, listen! We have an app now! You can keep track of your orders and get your Tegridy delivered even faster. [his phone dings] Oop. There's an order now. [scoots away]
[Downtown South Park, day. The boys walk through the commercial district. Many of the businesses that they pass by have a "Closed" or "Out of Business" sign.]
STAN
First thing we've gotta do to get the bike parade cancelled is raise awareness.
CARTMAN
Yeah. We're gonna need poster boards, markers, and lots of glitter and glue.
KYLE
I can't believe Kenny bailed on us just because he thinks Jeff Bezos is a bad guy.
CARTMAN
Yeah, how can somebody who gives you whatever you want be a bad guy? [Stan walks up to a storefront and knocks on the door, then looks back at the other boys] It's locked. [knocks again]
RICHARD
[walks up with his wife] They're closed. We're all closed. Our coffee shop -- everything.
CARTMAN
But we're outraged about something. We need glitter and glue.
RICHARD
Yeah. Well, when the Amazon Fulfillment Center opened, everything else went out of business.
MAYOR
[off screen] I let it happen. [the boys and the Tweeks turn to look. The mayor is now seated on a bench nearby with her hands clasped] I thought the fulfillment center would be nothing but great for the town. Instead it's... it's buried us.
MAN 5
But it's Christmas. It's Christmas and we've no presents, no decorations. And there's no one who can help us. [the sound of sleigh bells breaks the gloom]
MAN 6
[points] Look!
SANTA
[On his sleigh, with his eight reindeer] Ho ho ho ho!
MAN 7
It's Santa! [Santa comes back around and lands on the street. Everyone cheers]
WOMAN 3
It's a miracle!
SANTA
[gets out of his sleigh] I heard some people here might need a little Christmas magic.
STAN
We sure do, Santa!
MAN 8
It's only a couple of weeks until Christmas, and we don't have any presents!
SANTA
Well, that's no problem for the hometown of my favorite holiday poo! Where is Mr. Hankey? [everyone's smiles disappear] Where is that old bundle of Christmas cheer?
MAYOR
We... We had to get rid of Mr. Hankey.
SANTA
Got rid of him?
MACKEY
Uh, Mr. Hankey did somethin' bad, and we were forced to make him uh... leave. Forever.
SANTA
Jesus, what did he do? Fuck a kid?
MAYOR
No. He um.. he tweeted some uh... inappropriate things.
SANTA
[cynically] "He tweeted some inappropriate things?" [silence] Oh, you bunch of fuckin'- I'm getting back in my sleigh now. [goes back in]
STAN
Nononono! Wait wait wait, please!
SANTA
Merry Christmas! Have fun sucking Jeff Bezos' dick, you bunch of cunts! [rides off as the townspeople are shocked]
[The Stotch home, exterior, night. "Silent Night" is heard.]
SINGER
Christ, the savior, is born...
[Stotch residence, living room. A panning shot from the Christmas tree to Stephen sits on the sofa all alone and looking depressed]
DJ
Continuing with non-stop holiday music. Here's a song from that hot new group, The PC Babies. It's a song about how the idea of Mrs. Claus perpetuates female stereotypes. It's called, "Jingle All The Waahhhh." [Christmas themed jazz music plays as the sound of babies crying starts up. Stephen buries his face in his hands]
BUTTERS
[walks up and stands next to the Christmas tree] Hey Dad? I don't need anything more. I mean, if I don't win that bike parade, I don't care. I have you guys, and... that's more important than a bike parade will ever be.
STEPHEN
No it isn't, Butters. I want to quit working for Amazon. I want to quit working for Amazon. I want to join my friends in striking but... I know that you have to have your stuff to be happy.
BUTTERS
No I don't Dad.
STEPHEN
[stands up] You need your Amazon Prime shows and your music and your books. and your things delivered to your door like little presents to yourself that make you feel satisfied. I can live without those things, but you... can't. [turns away and goes to the front door] That's why I'm gonna continue working at Amazon. For you! [opens the front door and sees Towelie there.]
TOWELIE
[sounding stoned] Hello, sir. I'm with the Tegridy Weed Company. We're just makin' sure folks are aware of our new rewards program.
STEPHEN
What?
TOWELIE
We now have three levels of membership for our weed. There's Tegridy, Tegridy Plus, and Tegridy Elite. But you don't want to be elite, 'cause elite's got no Tegridy. [Stephen mulls this over]
[A bridge over a lake near town, day. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman lean over the top of it looking over the water]
CARTMAN
It's just such bullcrap, you guys.
KYLE
Such bullcrap.
CARTMAN
How come everything out there is getting cancelled, but when it comes to us, we just can't do it?
STAN
I mean, are we supposed to just keep going? Just go on, making total asses of ourselves?
KYLE
[turns away from the bridge, followed by Stan and Cartman] No. No! The problem is that when it comes to outrage, your average person actually doesn't give a shit, unless it has something to do with them.
CARTMAN
[walks up next to Kyle] That's right. we've been selfish. We can't get the parade cancelled for us. We have to do it for all the other people who want it cancelled, but their voices aren't being heard!
STAN
[walks up next to Kyle] Yeah! What? Did we think this was a fucking joke? The bike parade is offensive, and the government thinks they can just force it on everyone!
CARTMAN
Come on! I'm actually pissed off now! [they walk off]
[City Hall, day. The three boys walk up to the building and burst into the Mayor's office.]
STAN
Mayor, we demand you cancel this bike parade!
CARTMAN
It is nihilistic and out of touch with progressive thinking! [the executive armchair turns around to reveal Jeff Bezos, with a smug look. He puts his feet up and communicates telepathically]
BEZOS
What's the matter? Afraid you wouldn't win?
STAN
It's him.
BEZOS
The bike parade was quite useful to me. You see, people will do anything to have fulfillment. They finally realized the only way to get it would be to all work for the fulfillment center.
CARTMAN
Who would use the bike parade like some $20 hooker?
KYLE
Kenny was right about you. You're a bad guy!
BEZOS
Oh, you mean your little socialist friend? Yes, he's starting to rattle his sword now, too. Alexa, kill Kenny.
ALEXA
Okay. I'll kill Kenny for you.
STAN
[raises his arms] No!
KYLE
Why are you doing this?!
BEZOS
[gets up and walks around the boys] Don't you see I'm trying to help? Before, there was war between classes, customers and workers at odds. All I've done is create the new class: the consumer-worker. The future. Right now your parents, your teachers, everyone you know are showing up to work at the fulfillment center, and I'm afraid you are all going to lose the bike parade.
RANDY
[from the ground below] Bezos! Bezos!
CROWD
[from the ground below] Bezos! Bezos! Bezos! [Bezos opens the windows and is surprised to see the large crowd below. The camera pans across the scene, as the townspeople stand in unity, with their arms on their neighbors' back. Randy then takes a step forward]
RANDY
Hello Bezos! You can take your fulfillment center and fulfill it right up your ass! See, there's one thing you didn't count on, and that's Tegridy! Just look in the eyes of these people! [a close-up look shows a lot of bloodshot eyes] Everyone has Tegridy now! Tegridy that you will never understand! We aren't just different classes of people anymore, we are a town!
BEZOS
[annoyed] Are you all high?
CROWD
[shifting their eyes around] No, no...
RANDY
Why do you ask that?
BEZOS
Because I'm over here!
RANDY
Oh. Hang on. [notices where Bezos is and walks towards the window. Everyone has been facing left of City Hall] Hold on. Okay, I got it. Anyways... you see, Tegridy is something that can't be understood by big corporations! Oh, they'll try to package Tegridy, but only I can really package Tegridy. I got more money now 'cause of Tegridy, and that's 'cause I figured out how to get Tegridy to everyone. And that's- now everyone is in their state of Tegridy that's impenetrable. Am I making sense?
BEZOS
NO!
RANDY
The point is, nobody's comin' to work for you! So you can take your whole plan and fulfill it somewhere else! [the crowd cheers "Yeah!"]
BEZOS
[raises his arms to the sky] Damn you, Tegridy! [upbeat music starts]
[The montage finale, with a reprise of "Colorado Farm". Mayor McDaniels cuts the ribbon to commence the bike parade. Among the kids at the front of the parade are Wendy, Heidi, Henrietta, Pete, Craig, and Jimmy. The children begin to ride through a residential area, while their parents and other residents including Dr. Mephesto and Mr. Mackey watch...and appear to be stoned.]
SINGERS
Ice-cold beer, down-home days
country music and bike parades
We got Tegridy all around (round, round)
That's life livin' in our Colorado town. [a shot of the PC babies crying as a stoned Strong Woman holds one of them up in her arms]
STAN
I guess they are offensive. [Kyle laughs]
[As the parade continues through town, Big Gay Al and Mr. Slave can be seen getting high while grilling. The mall workers are on a driveway and waving. More kids including Michael and Bebe can be seen. Cartman is shown with Kenny's coffin attached to his bike, draped with the banner, "Remember Kenny". The group eventually goes in front of the Stotch residence, where Linda and Stephen are sitting and stoned.]
SINGERS
We don't need nothing from big corporations
We don't need progress or fancy educations
Maybe our tegridy keepw us down (down, down)
But that's life livin' in our Colorado town.
BUTTERS
Hey, Mom. Hi Dad.
STEPHEN
[Waves to him as he passes by] Sure are, Butters.
[The parade continues onto the Park County Police Station, where Sargent Yates and uniformed officers can be seen smoking a joint and passing it. Mr. Adams and President Garrison are also there and watch. It continues on past the church and back to a residential area where Jimbo gives a badly injured Ned a hit of his weed.]
SINGERS
Now we gotta learn to live without boxes every day
We might wake up tomorrow and wonder why they went away [President Garrison, in cuffs, waves at the participants]
Guess you might call us a bunch of white trash hicks (hicks, hicks) [even Father Maxi is smoking a joint]
But at least we ain't suckin' no Bezosian dicks.
[An overhead shot of the parade continuing through a residential area is shown, followed by an image of a jar of Tegridy Weed at the center of the screen]
ANNOUNCER
Tegridy Weed. Comin' soon to a giant online retailer near you.
End of Bike Parade
