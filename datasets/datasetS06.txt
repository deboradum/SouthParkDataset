ANNOUNCER
Today on the Maury Povich show, these poor unfortunate people [a shot of one dwarf walking, then of another being interviewed by Maury] all have horrible disfigurements, [a shot of a man with elephantitis getting some popcorn, then going down an escalator] and you won't believe how we exploit them for your amusement! [Maury interviews a flatheaded man, a blond with stumps for arms wrestles with a brush in the shower]
[Stan's house, living room. He, Kyle, and Cartman watch television from the sofa.]
STAN
Hm, that sounds pretty good.
"KENNY"
[walks in] (Hey guys. What's going on here?)
STAN
Hey Kenny! [the three boys grin]
"KENNY"
(Gosh darn it, my name's not Kenny!)
CARTMAN
That's awesome, Kenny. ["Kenny" removes his hood, and it's Butters]
BUTTERS
Eh now gosh darnit, fellas, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead.
KYLE
Okay, Not-Kenny.
BUTTERS
And I'm not gonna wear this coat anymore, neither! [takes off the coat and tosses it away] I should be able to be you guys' friend without wearin' Kenny's old coat!
STAN
Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povich freak show is on.
BUTTERS
Oh, all right, then. [takes a seat on the sofa between Kyle and Cartman]
[Maury Povich show.]
MAURY
Our next guest is a little girl who was born without a midsection. Please welcome Damla Jones.
DAMLA
[a blonde] Hello, Maury. [walks out. She has spindly legs, but no chest, abdomen or back. Think Mike Wazowski of "Monsters Inc." The boys are suitably disgusted]
[Cut to Cartman and the boys.]
CARTMAN
Aww, sick dude!
[Cut to show.]
MAURY
[Damla climbs onto the guest chair] You're a very brave little girl, and I'm very proud of you.
DAMLA
[voice quivering] Thank you.
MAURY
[leans forward] Can you tell the audience how miserable your life is?
DAMLA
Uh-uh, yes. It is.
MAURY
[giggles] You're a cutey. Do the other kids at school sometimes make fun of you?
DAMLA
Sometimes.
MAURY
[puts his left hand on her forehead] Do people sometimes stare at you?
DAMLA
Sometimes.
MAURY
[sits on the ground in front of her] Do they go, "Oh, gross. What the hell is that thing"?
DAMLA
Mmm-I don't know. [looks away and down]
MAURY
Well your mommy told us you like to listen to music.
DAMLA
Yes.
MAURY
Well guess what, Damla. We're gonna give you a three hundred dollar gift certificate to CD World in Torrance! [the studio audience applauds, music starts up to lead to commercial] All right, everyone. Stay tuned, because next we're gonna meet a woman whose head was smashed in on a locker! And we're gonna give her a makeover!
[Cut to sofa.]
KYLE
This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick!
[Cut to show.]
ANNOUNCER
Do you or someone you know have a disfigurement or disability that we can exploit on the Maury Povich show? If so, call 1-555-HEY MAURY!
[Cut to sofa.]
STAN
Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so we can win a prize!
KYLE
Cool!
CARTMAN
Oh YES!! [gets off the sofa and heads for the phone]
BUTTERS
Oh, that'd be awesome! [Cartman dials the number]
KYLE
[he and the other two follow Cartman] Do you think they'll believe it?
STAN
What disease should we say?
CARTMAN
Shhh. Be quite, you guys! [talks to someone on the phone] Hello, is this Maury Povich? [beat] Oh, well who the hell are you? [beat] Oh. Well I'm calling about your ad for freaks? [Stan grins, Kyle stifles a laugh] Ye-right, people with disabilities? [beat] Yeah, I have a friend; he has a deformity; I think he'd be perfect for your show. [beat] Great! [beat] Hih-his condition? [beat] Uh, he has a condition called "chinballalitis." [beat] Yeah, his balls actually hang from his chin. [Stan stilfes a laugh and closes his eyes, then Butters stifles a laugh. All of them giggle. Cartman tells the others] Shut uh- shut up you guys. [beat, then on the phone] Yes. [beat] Yes, of course he's very upset about it. [beat] Yes, he cries all the time. [beat] Miserable, uh huh. [beat] You wha- Really?
STAN
[drops his hands] What? [the others follow]
CARTMAN
Dude, they say they'll fly him out day after tomorrow!
KYLE
Awesome!
BUTTERS
Cool!
CARTMAN
Uh yes, I'm sure I can convince him to come on the show. [trying to be subtle] There will of course be a prize involved? [beat] Great. I'll call you back in an hour. [gladly] No, thank you. [hangs up] YES!
STAN
This is gonna be so funny!
BUTTERS
Uh, it sure is!
KYLE
But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin?
BUTTERS
Hah yeah, how are we go-? Wait... Butters' chin?
KYLE
Yeah.
BUTTERS
Uh, but that's me. I'm Butters.
STAN
We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you think we were talkin' about?
BUTTERS
We-ell hold on a second, you guys.
CARTMAN
[hops off the chair] Hey, I know how we get the balls on Butter's chin. Those Star Trek dorks down the street! They're always making crazy masks and special effects for their dumb movies.
BUTTERS
Hang on now.
KYLE
Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters!
BUTTERS
Wait! W-why does it have to be me??
STAN
It has to be you, Butters. Think about it.
CARTMAN
Yeah.
BUTTERS
But fellas, if I go on Maury Povich, with- with my balls on my chin, my parents are gonna get really mad.
KYLE
We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with my parents. They'll never know.
BUTTERS
I'm sorry, but the answer is uh uh, uh uh, uh uh. [crosses his arms and looks away]
STAN
[looks away and up] Kenny woulda done it. [Butters reacts]
BUTTERS
...So? I told you guys before: [with emphasis] I'm not Kenny.
KYLE
We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool.
CARTMAN
Yeah. God, I wish Kenny was still alive. He'd put balls on his chin. He was such an awesome friend.
STAN
[begins to walk and lead the others away] Well, come on guys. If Butters won't even put his balls on his chin for us, I guess we know where we stand. [Butters now looks chastened]
CARTMAN
Yeah.
BUTTERS
Aw, gee whiz, yih, yo, you promise my mom and dad won't find out?
[The Trekkers' place down the street, next day. The two Trekkers work on Butters.]
BRUNET TREKKER
Now, we're going to apply the latex with some spirit gum.
BUTTERS
Hey that spirit gum sure is stinky.
STAN
Where's you get the balls from?
BRUNET TREKKER
We made a plastic mold of his chin, and then made a latex scrotum and put two golf balls inside.
CARTMAN
Nice.
BLOND TREKKER
Now we just blend the skin tones, add a little hair, [spins the chair around] and presto! [shows Butters' new look to the boys. Butters indeed sports a fake scrotum]
STAN
Wow!
KYLE
That looks awesome!
BUTTERS
Aw, I feel silly.
CARTMAN
They look great on you, Butters. They really do.
BLOND TREKKER
I believe you owe us payment now? [Stan and Kyle look at each other]
STAN
All right, the original AVID cut of Star Wars: Episode I
BRUNET TREKKER
Wooww!
BLOND TREKKER
They weren't lying!
[The Trekkers' place. The boys leave the room.]
KYLE
[softly] Why the hell would they want that anyway? [drops to a whisper] Episode I sucked balls.
CARTMAN
Yeah, it sucked Hairy Butters' chin balls. [the Trekkers begin to fight over the tape. Butters checks his new balls self-consciously]
BLOND TREKKER
Here, damnit!
BRUNET TREKKER
Hey, hey! Stop it, man!
[Denver Airport, next day.]
ANNOUNCER
Gay Air Flight 243 with service to New York now ready for general boarding.
STAN
That's your flight, Butters.
CARTMAN
Okay, here's your ticket [hands it to Butters] and they're gonna have a car waiting for you at the gate in New York. [pushes him forward]
BUTTERS
Uh wait. [stops] You guys aren't comin' with me?
STAN
Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV.
BUTTERS
[backs up into the lineup] Ho-old on a minute, guys, I've changed my mind. I don't wanna go.
CARTMAN
God, isn't Butters awesome for doing this, you guys?
KYLE
Yeah, he sure is.
STAN
Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend! [pause]
CARTMAN
Buh-ters! Buh-ters!
BUTTERS
[hesitant] Uhhh all right, then. See you guys tomorrow. [heads for the gate, then turns around. The boys wave at him. Butters looks down, then walks into the plane.]
[New York, TV Studio, day.]
STAGEHAND
Thanks for coming on the show, kid. Maury is very excited to meet you. And this is the Green Room where you can hang out with the other guests until we call for you on set. Boy with Balls on Chin, meet Man with Foot on Head, Girl with Rapid Aging Disease, Disfigured Country Singer, and Man With No Face.
BUTTERS
Wow! Scooped-out face guy! Ah-ah-I've seen you on TV before.
MAN WITH NO FACE
[goes for some water] Yes, this is my sixth appearance. [drinks]
STAGEHAND
I'll come back in a bit, folks. [leaves]
MAN WITH FOOT ON HEAD
Hey Roger! [the stagehand stops] What the hell is with these horrible veggie platters?!
DISFIGURED COUNTRY SINGER
Yeah, we told you last time we want fresher vegetables.
ROGER
I'm sorry, this is what the studio provides. Just take a seat on the couch, kid. I'll be back in a minute. [Butters looks at the others, then makes his way to a spot on the couch and sits down. A long silence follows]
DISFIGURED COUNTRY SINGER
...Boy with balls on his chin. Haven't seen you around. How long have you been on the circuit?
BUTTERS
What circuit?
MAN WITH FOOT ON HEAD
The talk-show circuit. Don't tell us this is your first one.
BUTTERS
Uh well, yeah. You've all done it more than once?
MAN WITH NO FACE
Oprah two times, Jenny Jones once, Sally Jessie five times.
DISFIGURED COUNTRY SINGER
[looks at the man with no face] You've only done Jenny once?
MAN WITH FOOT ON HEAD
Oh, ah I hate doing the Jenny Jones show. They don't even have their own hair people.
MAN WITH NO LIMBS
I'm doing Jenny tomorrow.
DISFIGURED COUNTRY SINGER
Yeah, you picked a good show to do first, kid, but you need to learn the ropes. There are a lot of people like you all over the country, and we all do talk shows for a living.
MAN WITH FOOT ON HEAD
We all know each other and we kinda stick together to make sure our industry is protected.
MAN WITH NO FACE
Yeah. Like when someone LIES about being a freak.
BUTTERS
[trembling] Oh they, they do, huh?
DISFIGURED COUNTRY SINGER
Yeah, they'll make up a fake condition to go on these shows and then take our money away!
MAN WITH NO LIMBS
We don't take kindly to that.
BUTTERS
Well I can certainly see why.
MAN WITH NO LIMBS
It's okay. Folks don't do it anymore. Not after what they saw what we did to Lobster Boy.
BUTTERS
Lobster Boy?
MAN WITH FOOT ON HEAD
Yeah, loh-, Lobster Boy used to make appearances on all the talk shows. He was one of the most popular disfigured people on TV.
DISFIGURED COUNTRY SINGER
But then we all found out that Lobster Boy wasn't a real freak at all. He was just an actual lobster.
MAN WITH NO LIMBS
[grousing] Lying sack of crap.
MAN WITH FOOT ON HEAD
So you know what we did to him?
BUTTERS
What?
MAN WITH FOOT ON HEAD
One night all us freaks got together, and we... boiled him alive. [Butters stares, then an image of a lobster in a boiling pot appears, then vanishes]
DISFIGURED COUNTRY SINGER
Now Lobster Boy is no more.
BUTTERS
Oh. Yeah. I I hate when people fake conditions, too. Those stupid fakers.
MAN WITH FOOT ON HEAD
We're glad you agree.
STAGEHAND
Okay, Boy with balls on his chin, you're up next.
BUTTERS
[hops off the couch and heads for the door.] Oh, Jesus, see me through this.
[Maury Povich Show promo.]
ANNOUNCER
Next on the Maury Povich show: we bring back some of our favorite disfigured people [four scenes: first, the man with the foot on his head is talking to the girl with rapid aging disease and disfigured country singer, then the disfigured country singer is shown eating a subway sub, then the man with no face shows his disfigurement, and finally Butters' shadow is shown in profile] and introduce you to some new ones.
[Stan's living room. The boys watch TV..]
STAN
Here he comes.
KYLE
This is gonna be awesome!
[Maury Povich Show, new segment.]
MAURY
Our next guest suffers from a rare birth defect which caused his testicles and scrotum to grow from his chin.
CARTMAN
Testicles and scrotum! [laughs gleefully]
MAURY
Please welcome eight-and-a-half-year old Napoleon Bonaparte from South Park Colorado. [Butters looks out timidly at the audience from behind the curtain, then heads for the guest chair.] Thanks so much for coming on our show.
BUTTERS
Huh, that's okay, I, I s'pose.
MAURY
So, is it tough being ...different?
BUTTERS
Uhhh, yeah.
MAURY
And do all the kids at school make fun of you?
BUTTERS
[forgetting why he's supposedly made of] They sure do. They always say to me, "Butters, you're not Kenny." But I never said I was Kenny. They say Kenny would do this and Kenny would do that-
CARTMAN
Uh oh, we're losin' him.
BUTTERS
I'm tired of it. You hear me, fellas?! Kenny's dead and you'll just have tuh deal with it.
MAURY
Uh, yeah, but I mean, do the kids make fun of you because of your condition?
BUTTERS
Uh what condition?
MAURY
[terse] You have balls that hang off your chin.
BUTTERS
I do?? Uh. Oh. I, I mean, yeah-ah I do. Uh. Yeah, the kids at school make fun of me for that.
STAN, KYLE
Phew.
CARTMAN
Oh, that was close.
MAURY
What names do they call you at school?
BUTTERS
Aaahhh well, aaahmm, ...I guess they call me uh, Chinball Boy, and uh, Ballchin Boy, nnnd when I, when I'm walkin' they'll say, "Hey, there goes Chinballs!" [Stan and Kyle grin, Cartman laughs hard]
MAURY
And do they call you "freak" and "weirdo"?
BUTTERS
Well yeah, I s'pose.
MAURY
[sits on the floor and draws closer] Do they point at you and laugh? Do they make you wish you'd never been born? Make you wish to put an end to the whole... miserable wretched earth?
BUTTERS
Uh, sure.
MAURY
Well Napoleon, we have a surprise for you.
STAN, KYLE
Wait, here it is, here it is!
CARTMAN
The present.
MAURY
Because you're such a brave little chinballed man, we're gonna send you directly from this studio to the world's largest putt-putt golf course in the world!
BUTTERS
Oh really?
KYLE
Wow!
CARTMAN
Did he say "the... largest putt-putt golf course in the world"?
MAURY
Go on, you're going right now!! [Butters hops off and walks away happily]
STAN
But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!
KYLE
Yeah! We thought of the whole thing!
CARTMAN
Euh! Once again Butters is tryin' to screw us over! That asshole!
[Cartman's room, later that day. Cartman is on the phone.]
CARTMAN
Hello, is this the Maury Povich show? [beat] Yes, I'm calling because I saw your television program, and I also have balls hanging from my chin. [strokes his "balls"] I'd like to come in and talk about my disorder and perhaps get a free trip to the largest putt-putt golf course in the world?
OPERATOR
[just painted the fingernails on her right hand and is having them dry] I'm sorry, but we're done doing freak shows for now. We're looking for people for a new topic.
CARTMAN
What's the new topic?
OPERATOR
Please help my out-of-control child.
CARTMAN
Oh. Hey, I'm out of control!
OPERATOR
Really? [pulls out a notepad and starts taking notes] Is your mother in tears every day over how disobedient you are?
CARTMAN
Uh, sure!
OPERATOR
Does she worry about you doing drugs and having sex at such a young age?
CARTMAN
Ehyeah, sure. Ah I do crack and potpourri, and queazies.
OPERATOR
Well that's great! If you can get your mom to come in with you, we'd love to fly you out.
CARTMAN
[stunned] ...my, my mom?
[Cartman's home, kitchen. His mom is humming and preparing gingerbread men for baking. Cartman enters with his hands clasped behind his back.]
CARTMAN
Mmoooomm?
LIANE
Yes, sweetie?
CARTMAN
Could you do me a favor?
LIANE
What's that, my little man?
CARTMAN
Could you um... go on the Maury Povich show with me and say that I'm out of control and do drugs and have sex so that I can go to the largest putt-putt golf course in the wwoooorrlldd?
LIANE
Hmmm. but you're not out of control, muffin. You're my perfect little gum drop.
CARTMAN
I'm just asking you to lie for me. You love me, don't you?
LIANE
Of course I do.
CARTMAN
Oh, I have such a pretty mother. Such a wonderful mother.
LIANE
Sweetie, don't.
CARTMAN
Then it's settled. Oh, I have such a great mother. [turns around and walks out] Such a beautiful mother.
[Butters' house. He's back from New York and his parents have apparently heard about the show. Stephen has his arms folded in front of him.]
LINDA
Just what did you think you were doing, Butters? Not only did you lie to us and say you were on a camping trip with Kyle's family, you made a fool of yourself AND us on national television!
BUTTERS
[still wearing his balls, looking hurt] Oh I'm sorry, mom.
STEPHEN
Well, sorry isn't gonna make it this time, mister! You know, your grandmother saw the show and had a mild stroke!
BUTTERS
Aw jeez, ah I didn't mean to almost kill Grandma. I promise I'll never go on TV with balls on my chin again.
STEPHEN
Ugh! You'd better believe you won't, buster!
LINDA
Your father and I have to leave now to visit Grandma in the hospital, but you can just take those balls off your chin and march right up to your room!
BUTTERS
[with voice trembling, turns around] Yes ma'am. [removes his balls]
[Butters' room. He's pacing the floor mad at himself.]
BUTTERS
Serves me right! Puttin' balls on my chin and lyin' about it. Why I, I should be grounded for a month! Why do I do these things? Why can't I behave myself? [his phone rings. Butters goes for the receiver]
STAN
[on the other end] Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you?
BUTTERS
Oh Jesus! They were??
STAN
Yeah, they wanted to find you bad.
BUTTERS
Well Oh, God! W-whatdya tell him?
STAN
I- told them where to find you.
BUTTERS
What?? W-why the heck would you do that. Wuh they wanna kill me for not bein' a real freak!
STAN
Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over. [hangs up. Butters looks helpless, then walks to the window to see if the freaks are coming. They are indeed]
BUTTERS
Oh Jesus no. [hops off his dresser and walks away from the window] They've come to boil me alive! Uh just like Lobster Boy! Ah, I've gotta get outta here! [reaches his bedroom door, but turns around] Wait! I can't go anywhere. I'm grounded. Oh Christ, what a pickle! [the doorbell rings.]
[Butters' house, out front. A scream is heard and the freaks look around.]
MAN WITH FOOT ON HEAD
Napoleon? [the disfigured country singer goes for the knob and opens the door.]
DISFIGURED COUNTRY SINGER
Napoleon Bonaparte? [leads the other freaks in. Butters quickly prepares his false scrotum...] I think he's up here. [opens the door, and Butters grins back at them with one hand on the dresser and a suave pose. His balls are back in place]
BUTTERS
Oh, hello, folks. Uh what's the problem?
DISFIGURED COUNTRY SINGER
There you are, Boy With Balls On His Chin.
MAN WITH FOOT ON HEAD
We've got big news! The union is striking.
BUTTERS
[relaxes] The union? Oh, that's why you came?
DISFIGURED COUNTRY SINGER
We're tired of our crappy prizes! So the union president, Man with Terrible Skin Condition, has told us to round everyone up.
BUTTERS
Uh uh I can't freak strike, fellas. Ah-, I'm grounded.
MAN WITH FOOT ON HEAD
Grounded for what?
BUTTERS
For havin' balls on my- AH! Ah, I mean, nothin'. [strikes the pose again] Ah I'm not grounded.
MAN WITH NO FACE
Good, then you can march with us. Freaks of the world,
THE FREAKS
Unite! [Butters looks at them]
[Maury Povich show.]
ANNOUNCER
Today on Maury Povich: These moms [three are shown. Only Liane grins] don't know what to do with their out-of-control kids! [a fat blonde girl is shown, then Cartman's school picture] Young boys and girls so whorish on our show that it borders on child pornography!
MAURY
[on his stool] We're here talking with moms who think their children are out of control. [the woman next to him blows her nose] Vanessa here says that her thirteen-year-old daughter Vanity is already doing drugs and having sex with older men. [Vanessa begins to bawl]
STUDIO AUDIENCE
Ooohhhhhhhh.
MAURY
Vanessa, what does Vanity say to you when you tell her toooo... do her homework.
VANESSA

STUDIO AUDIENCE

MAURY
Well, let's bring her out. Here's Vanity! [she steps out and the awws turn into boos]
VANITY
Wha'evah, wha'evah! You fuckin' cocksuckers don't know shit! Fuck you! [moons the audience, and an OOPS! bubble appears over the area. Vanity then walks up to her mom and slaps her hard across the face. Vanessa winces in pain]
MAURY
Wow, Vanity, you are really an out of control teen.
SOME AUDIENCE MEMBERS
Yeah! [the rest cheer, then a chant rises from the din] Maury! Maury!
VANITY
Wha'evah! Maury, my mom don't know shit! You could aks her! I aks her all my homies that they be down wit it. You know, it's all good shit. [the audience boos and she holds up her middle fingers, which are blurred] Fuck you, cocksuckuhs!

VANITY
Shu' up! Shut the fuck [slap] up, you dried-up skank! [slap. Vanessa weeps again]
[Green room. Cartman and his mom watch the show in there.]
LIANE
I'm glad you're not like that, poopsie-kins.
CARTMAN
[under his breath] But if I'm not the most out-of-control teen, I might not win the prize. [leaves the room and finds the stagehand] Excuse me, I wanna make a quick change. Where's wardrobe?
STAGEHAND
Second door on the right.
[Outside the building, the freaks have gathered and are now on strike - "FREAK OUT 2K2".]
THE FREAKS
Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!
MAN WITH TERRIBLE SKIN CONDITION
Brothers and sisters, the time has come for us to be treated with the respect we deserve! We are a strong and diverse group of people, with members like [shown] Woman with Crablike Body, [shown] Incredibly Obese Black Person, [shown] Man with Brains Outside of Head, and [shown] Liza Minnelli. The talk shows have us on and give us little gifts and perks while they make tens of thousands of dollars.
THE FREAKS
Yeah!
MAN WITH TERRIBLE SKIN CONDITION
We told the talk shows our demands, and they laughed! They say they can get plenty of other stupid guests to go on their shows! So we must picket those other guests!
THE FREAKS
Yeah!
BUTTERS
Well, gush, ah, I need to go. I can't picket, guys.
HAMMERHEAD MAN
You're not gonna picket?
MAN WITH TERRIBLE SKIN CONDITION
Who's not gonna picket? [the crowd parts and all hands point to Butters]
DISFIGURED COUNTRY SINGER
Boy with Balls on Chin doesn't wanna picket. [lowers his left arm]
BUTTERS
Well it's just that my parents are... I can't picket!
MAN WITH NO LIMBS
[emerges from the crowd] Why? You're not a SCAB, are you?
BUTTERS
NO I I'm not a scab.
MAN WITH TERRIBLE SKIN CONDITION
Now, we will split up into groups and form picket lines. The first group will be led by: Incredibly Obese Black Man.
INCREDIBLY OBESE BLACK MAN
Excuse me, I'm not Incredibly Obese Black Man, I'm Incredibly Black Obese Man.
MAN WITH TERRIBLE SKIN CONDITION
[looks at Incredibly Black Obese Man, then says flatly] ...Oh, right. My bad.
[Maury Povich show, back to out-of-control-child segment.]
ANNOUNCER
And now, back to more kids who are out of control, on the Maury Povich show!
MAURY
Our next mother is Liane Cartman. Her son claims to be the most out-of-control kid in the world and says there's nothing his stupid mom can do about it.
STUDIO AUDIENCE
Awww.
VANESSA
Why won't you kids behave? [Vanity stands and smacks her across the face]
VANITY
[shakes her mom around by the neck] Shut up, skank, he's not talkin' to you! [slaps her again and sits down]
MAURY
So, Ms. Cartman, you can't control your child?
LIANE
Oh, my little poopsie-kins gets into no-nos once in a while, but he's still my perfect little plumsy-kiddle.
MAURY
Well, your son made a video backstage. Let's take a look. [a video starts up with Cartman dolled up as a slut moving around to hip-hop music]
CARTMAN
Maury, I am out of control. Yeah, I use drugs. I can do what I waunt, bitch! Yeah I have sex, and I don't use protection! It's my hot body; I'll do what I waunt! [brings out a lollipop] I don't go to school and I kill people! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!
STUDIO AUDIENCE
[gasps, then] BOOOO!!
LIANE
Oh, he's such a cutie.
MAURY
Well, let's bring him out. Here's Eric Cartman! [steps out from behind the curtain and immediately gives the finger to the audience]
CARTMAN
Wha'evah! Wha'evah! [walks up to a seat next to his mom's and sits there] Maury, my mom can't control me, I'm tough! Go on, aks hurh!
MAURY
Ms. Cartman, what does your son like to do?
LIANE
Ooo, he loves playing with his Clyde Frog and Wellington Bear.
CARTMAN
[under his breath] Mom, we're pretending, remember? Sex and drugs.
LIANE
Oh, I mean, sex and drugs.
STUDIO AUDIENCE
Oooohhh!
CARTMAN
[hops off his chair and tries the audience] What-evah! What-evah! [snaps his left-hand fingers back and forth] I'll do what I waunt!

VANITY
What Evah! You ain't bad! You ain't nothin'! I ditch class and go shoot heroin in the school bathroom!
CARTMAN
What-evah! I ran for Congress and won. Then I had sex with an intern, killed her, and hid her body! What-evah, I'll do what I waunt!
[Outside the building, the freaks have gathered and are now on strike - "FREAK OUT 2K2".]

BUTTERS
[muttering along] Better prizes.
MAN WITH TERRIBLE SKIN CONDITION
When do we want them?
THE FREAKS
Now!
BUTTERS
Never. [approached the Man with Terrible Skin Condition] Sir, I really gotta go home. My parents are gonna be sore at me.
MAN WITH TERRIBLE SKIN CONDITION
Napoleon, you need to understand something: for a union to work all members must be prepared to make sacrifices and stick together.
BUTTERS
But I gotta get back to my family.
MAN WITH TERRIBLE SKIN CONDITION
[drops his sign and drops on one knee next to Butters] We're you family too, Napoleon. We're like you. When we look at you we don't even see the testicles on your chin. We see the testicles in your heart. [back to the freaks] What do we want?
THE FREAKS
Better prizes!
MAN WITH TERRIBLE SKIN CONDITION
When do we want them?
THE FREAKS
Now!
BUTTERS
Aw. hamburgers, this just keeps on gettin' worse. [joins the others in the strike. Several police cruisers pull up and police pour out of them]
POLICE CAPTAIN
Okay folks, we're gonna have to move along.
MAN WITH FOOT ON HEAD
Why? We're a union and we have a right to picket.
POLICE CAPTAIN
I'm sorry, but the government does not recognize you as a union. You'll have to go.
MIDDLE DWARF
What are you saying? That because of our appearance our organization is less important?
POLICE CAPTAIN
Now now now, I'm not telling you people that your union doesn't matter, I'm just telling you that you're not really... people.
MAN WITH FOOT ON HEAD
...Alright, that does it! It's time to bring out the big guns! Prepare the video sabotage!
BUTTERS
Oh no, not the video sabotage, uh.
[Maury Povich show, back to out-of-control-child segment.]
ANNOUNCER
Who is the most out of controlled child? We're back with Maury.
MAURY
We're here, talking with moms who think their children are out of control.
VANITY
What evah!
CARTMAN
I slaughtered five baby seals with my bare hands. What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!
MAURY
[walks to the third woman on the panel] Now let's meet Joline. Joline says that her daughter is also out of control, that she's flirting with older men, and, she's only four months old.
STUDIO AUDIENCE
Aawwww.
JOLINE
Mmhmm, that's right Maurih.
MAURY
Let's bring her out: here's Chantal! [Chantal crawls out amid audience boos. The camera focuses on her diaper. Chantal reaches Joline, who picks her up and sits her on the chair next to hers] So Joline, exactly how is your daughter out of control? You say she flirts with older men? [Chantal plays with her rattle]
JOLINE
Maurih, it's like this: Whenever I have friends over to the house Chantal will come waltzin' in the livin' room completely naked!
STUDIO AUDIENCE
Ooohhh!
VANITY
Whatevah. I helped in a drive-by shooting.
CARTMAN
What-evah. I digitally put Jabba the Hutt back into the original Star Wars movie! I'll do what I waunt!
MAURY
Wow, that is out of control!
JOLINE
Why, just last night I had three gentlemen callers over to my house, and Chantal took her clothes off right in front o' everybody!
STUDIO AUDIENCE
Boooo! [Chantal drops down and starts wiggling.]
JOLINE
You see? [Her diaper drops, then her top.] There she goes. There she goes. [Chantal shows her butt to the audience] OH! YOU GOD-DAMNED WHORE!
[The screen behind them sputters and changes. The Maury Povich logo disappears.]
MAN WITH FOOT ON HEAD
[appearing] Attention Maury viewers.
MAURY
What the hell is this? [another image replaces the one of Man with Foot on Head]
ELEPHANT MAN
A lot of decent hard-working freaks in America are losing their talk-show jobs to freaks of a different nature. Sure, everyone in this great country of ours is a freak, but true, physically deformed freaks must be recognized, for it's these real freaks that make you all feel better about yourselves for not being one. So next time you're watching television, make sure it's a show with "freak" freaks, and not just with people that are freaks because they're stupid trailer trash from the South. That's what we mean when we say, "Look for the True Freak label" [his image fades to that of the True Freak label]
BUTTERS AND THE FREAKS
[Butters sits atop a True Freak label box and starts off] Look for the True Freak label
[four freaks join in] When you are watching a TV talk show
[a side shot of more freaks streaming their way to the box] Remember somewhere,
[a shot of the audience] our union's growing
[a front shot of the freaks walking in] Our wages going to feed the kids.
[a front shot of more freaks walking in] And run the house-
We work hard, but who's complaining?
[a zoom-out shot as the freaks crowd in around Butters] With TFU we're making our way!
[a pan shot] So always look for the True Freak label,
[a full crowd shot] Because you need us right here in the U.S.A.!
[the Maury Povich logo is restored]
MAURY
Ah, sorry America, a little glitch there, heh. Anyway-
MAN
They're right. We should have never crossed that picket line. Come on, honey. [takes her hand and leads her out. Other audience members begin to grouse and leave]
MAURY
[pleading] Wait! Come back, uh-... Maybe we can make the other out-of-control kids take... their clothes off, too!
CARTMAN
[hops off his chair and steps forward] Whatevah! I'll crap in Maury's pants! [more audience members leave]
CAMERAMAN
Sir, the ratings have just started to plummet.
MAURY
Ah, those damned freaks! [throws his microphone against the back wall and heads for the exit]
[Outside the Maury Povich studio. A door opens and Maury steps out. The freaks stop and wait.]
MAURY
I gave you shoes! And groceries! And this is how you repay me?! [the freaks simply look back at him] Very well. Just come upstairs and... we'll negotiate! [goes in and slams the door shut. A few seconds later the freaks cheer their victory]
MAN WITH FOOT ON HEAD
We did it! The strike worked!
MAN WITH TERRIBLE SKIN CONDITION
Now we can go on with our careers!
BUTTERS
Whoa, thank God that's over. Now I can get back home. [drops his sign and moves off. An angry Cartman catches up to him]
CARTMAN
Butters, you have screwed me out of a prize for the last time! [rips the balls off Butters' chin. The freaks react immediately and fall silent]
BUTTERS
Oh. Double hamburgers.
MAN WITH FOOT ON HEAD
Jesus Christ! That out-of-control kid ripped poor Napoleon's balls right off!
INCREDIBLY OBESE BLACK MAN
Get him!
CARTMAN
Aaahh! [three freaks trail behind with a boiling pot of water]
INCREDIBLY OBESE BLACK MAN
Get him! Get him! [the freaks charge at Cartman, who runs off in fear]
BUTTERS
Hey. Things actually turned out... okay for me this time. [a taxicab pulls up and screeches to a halt]
STEPHEN
[quickly exits the cab with Linda] Butters!
BUTTERS
[anticipating] Oh I know.
End of Freak Strike


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:As the country becomes obsessed with a popular program for losing weight, the boys see an opportunity to become sponsored by a major restaurant chain.

script:Jared Has Aides

[Cartman's house, living room, day. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle are on the sofa laughing as Cartman does some prank calls.]
CARTMAN
[dialing] Shu- shut up you guys, shut up you guys. [the boys quiet down and cover their mouths as the call goes through to City Wok, a Chinese restaurant.]
TUONG LU KIM
Herro, Shitty Wok, take your order prease.
CARTMAN
[the boys giggle] Hello, is this City Wok?
TUONG LU KIM
Yes, this Shitty Wok
CARTMAN
[the boys giggle harder] Uh, yes, we'd like one order of the City Beef.
TUONG LU KIM
[writing] Shitty Beef...
KYLE
Aha, and I'll have the City Chicken.
TUONG LU KIM
[writing] Shitty Chicken... [the boys bursts in laughter. Cartman rolls back on the sofa]
STAN
Oh, dude, look! [the others look up and the phone falls off Cartman's lap to the floor] It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches!
[Commercial. The first thing on the screen is a submarine sandwich. It pans across the screen.]
SINGER
He's still lookin' good!
[a man appears eating a footlong subway sandwich. The name "JARED FOGLE" appears on the screen near the bottom]
His name is Jared
[he struts down a sidewalk. "LOST 262 LBS." appears on the screen]
His name is Jared and he likes to eat the sandwiches...
[a side shot of Jared walking smoothly behind a white picket fence in Downtown, then of slices of a party sub, then of the first sandwich]
[Cartman living room. Butters walks in.]
BUTTERS
Uh, hey, fellas.
STAN
Hey Kenny.
BUTTERS
[upset] Now gosh darnit, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead, and you're all gonna have to learn to deal with it!
KYLE
Okay, Not-Kenny.
[Commercial continues.]
ANNOUNCER
Hey South Park! [camera switches to the TV. Jared is shown munching away on a sub sandwich behind splash bubbles saying "JARED LIVE" "FREE SUBS" and "LOSE WEIGHT" and "MEET JARED" "SOUTH PARK, COLORADO"] You can meet Jared IN PERSON March 6 at the Kenny McCormick Memorial Town Square!
BUTTERS
[excited] Woh, boy! Jared's comin' to town!
KYLE
Dude! That's today!
STAN
We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny! [Stan and Kyle hop off the sofa and head for the front door]
BUTTERS
[angered] Now gosh darnit, my name's not Not-Kenny!
CARTMAN
[hops off and follows Stan and Kyle] Okay, come on, Not-Not-Kenny.
BUTTERS
Wo-ah I'm getting steamed now. [follows the other three. The phone remains on the floor]
TUONG LU KIM
[the receiver rattles with his voice] Hello! City Wok! City Wok, I take your order prease!
[Kenny McCormick Memorial Town Square, moments later. A crowd is in front of the stage waiting for Jared, with people holding up signs saying "We Love Jared" "We Love You Jared!!" "Jared for President", etc. The boys walk up to Herbert Garrison. Kyle taps him.]
KYLE
Excuse me? Could we get through here?
HERBERT GARRISON
[turns around] Hell no! I've been savin' this spot for six hours! [begins to dance]
His name is Garrison, Mr. Garrison. He lost ten pounds takin' Jared's lead-
RANDY
Here he comes! [the crowd turns left as one and starts clamoring. Jared struts towards the crowd as his theme song comes up]
SINGER
He's still lookin' good, with all those... sub sandwiches... [Jared walks up on stage and takes the podium]
JARED
Thank you all so much. You know what? After a year of eating delicious sub sandwiches, I've proven weight loss is easy! [the crowd cheers] And I promise you, I will always be your faithful leader in easy weight loss!
SOME MEN
Alright! [more cheering]
CARTMAN
That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is so cool.
[South Park, later. A knock is heard and a door opens. Jared is seen eating a sub at a desk. A worker peaks in.]
WORKER
Mr. Fogle, some fans wanted to see if you'd sign their sandwich?
JARED
Sure, let 'em in. [the worker lets the boys in and Jared spins around to face them] Hi kids. [the room Jared is in is a dressing room]
BUTTERS
Wow, Jared!
KYLE
Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?
JARED
I sure did! And- Well- Well I, I also had a little help on the side.
STAN
What kind of help?
JARED
Well, eating sub sandwiches was a big part of it. But the way that I lost so much weight was that I got aides.
CARTMAN
A- AIDS?
JARED
That's right. I got aides about two years ago and I've been losing weight ever since. It's amazing how slim you can get with aides.
STAN
I'll bet you can.
JARED
Would you like to meet them?
KYLE
[steps backwards] Them?
JARED
My aides. Scott! Tyler! [moves to the door. The two aides come in and Jared stands behind them. Then he looks at the blond to his left] Scott is my personal trainer [looks at the light brunet to his right] and Tyler is my dietitian.
SCOTT, TYLER
Hello.
KYLE
Oh, "A I D E S," aides.
JARED
Yep. Hooray for aides!
KYLE
Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial.
JARED
I know. You kinda have to read the fine print at the bottom of the screen. It says I only ate a half-sized lean turkey sandwich with no mustard or mayo or anything like that and then had proper diet and exercise aides.
KYLE
But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular.
JARED
Y- you think so. Well, why... should it matter?
KYLE
It matters, dude. [Jared begins to think...]
JARED
Hmmm.
[Main Street, moments later. The boys walk along...]
KYLE
That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised.
STAN
Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.
CARTMAN
Oh-my-god! [turns around] You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now.
KYLE
Tha- that's diarrhea.
CARTMAN
Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise.
STAN
[following] Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.
CARTMAN
[softly] That's right Stan. [bolder] It's a cash cow, I tell you.
KYLE
That's a great idea!
CARTMAN
Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done.
BUTTERS
[surprised, steps backwards] Me?!
CARTMAN
Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?
BUTTERS
Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh, you're the fat one.
CARTMAN
I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid!
KYLE
But Butters isn't fat.
CARTMAN
That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off.
STAN
He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster.
BUTTERS
But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me.
CARTMAN
Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!
BUTTERS
You mean like Jared?
KYLE
Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared!
BUTTERS
[angrily] Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penis-butt!
STAN
You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight...
His name is Butters, it's Butters. [the boys begin to sway for each line]
CARTMAN
He used to be fat but not no more [Butters brightens up]
KYLE
City Wok brought him down to a size 4.
STAN
Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls.
CARTMAN
[slowing] and a lifetime of free food at City Wok.
BUTTERS
[beaming] Wow.
[Le Place Restaurant, night. Jared is dining with a woman inside.]
JARED
Christine, you know I love you very much, and I, I can't wait for the wedding.
CHRISTINE
I love you too, Jared. You've changed my whole life.
Her name is Jonez, Christine Jonez
She lost forty pounds when she met Jared-
JARED
Yeh, I know I know, I know. But uh... some young boys were talkin' to me earlier, and... it made me think that people might not be so proud of my weight loss if they knew something.
CHRISTINE
Jared, what's this all about?
JARED
Uh, Christine, this isn't probably gonna matter to you at all, but... I have aides.
CHRISTINE
What?!
JARED
Yeah, I have aides. I've had aides since before we were together. [Christine's jaw drops] What, what are you thinking? Are you bummed?
CHRISTINE
Am I bummed?! [moves her chair away from Jared and faces him] You've had AIDS all this time and you knew it?!
JARED
Well of course I knew it.
CHRISTINE
Why the hell wouldn't you tell me?!
JARED
I didn't think it was that big of a deal.
CHRISTINE
Not that big of a deal?! I slept with you!
JARED
Aren't you overreacting a little bit?
CHRISTINE
Well, Jesus Christ! We're supposed to get married!
JARED
We can still get married Christine, I mean, sure, they're my aides now, but after we get married... they'll be our aides [Christine sobs] You'll love having aides, Christine, you really will. And when we have children, they'll have aides. It'll make things so simple! [Christine throws up her arms, rises from her chair, and runs out of the restaurant sobbing] Christine! [rises and moves to follow Christine, but stops to think] Jeez, those boys were right. People really don't like aides. I'd better tell everyone the truth.
[South Park Elementary, next day. The boys enter the kitchen to get their meals.]
CHEF
Hello there, children.
KYLE
Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast.
CHEF
Fifty pounds? Why?
CARTMAN
Uuuh, school project.
CHEF
Well, if you want him to get really fat as fast as possible, one of you will have to marry him.
STAN
Marry him?
CHEF
It definitely worked for every woman I ever met.
BUTTERS
Oh, no, no, no! I ain't gettin' married; my parents will ground me!
KYLE
Yeah, none of us wanna marry Butters.
BUTTERS
[self-conscious] Well, uh, how come? What's wrong with me?
CHEF
Well, I guess we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way. Come on back, children. [all of them move away from the counter and towards the back]
[The kitchen, food preparation area. The camera pans across the table showing pots, pans, and dishes with food all over the place. It rests on Butters trying to finish off a plate, but struggling.]
BUTTERS
Ugh. [sets his plate down] Wuh, wuh, I can't eat no more.
KYLE
You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise. [scoops out a tablespoon and hands it to Butters, but Butters doesn't take it. Chef enters and Butters begins to throw up]
STAN
[notices] Chef, we need more food.
CHEF
I'm runnin' out, children. [leaves. Butters vomits some more]
CARTMAN
Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I'll kick you till you're deader than Kenny!
STAN
[soberly] Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed.
CARTMAN
So how long until we can joke about it?
KYLE
Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.
CARTMAN
Wugh, that's a long time to wait.
BUTTERS
Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up.
CARTMAN
Then eat your puke.
BUTTERS
No!
CARTMAN
Oh, come on! Japanese girls do it. [Butters looks at Cartman, then at his puke. Reluctantly he scoops it up and eats it.]
[Kenny McCormick Memorial Town Square, later.]
SUBWAY REPRESENTATIVE
Ladies and gentlemen, we at Subway are happy to inform you that Jared has elected to stay in South Park in order to speak to you once again! [the crowd oohs and aaha]
MAN 1
He's going to speak with us once again!
SUBWAY REPRESENTATIVE
So, here he is, Jared! [the crowd cheers, and Jared is again walking towards them, grinning]
SINGER
He's still lookin' good, eatin' them sandwiches all the time...[Jared walks up on stage and takes the podium]
JARED
Thank you-hoo, thank you all. Subway is a healthy way to eat fast food and lose weight!
SUBWAY REPRESENTATIVE
All right! [pumps his arm as the crowd reacts]
JARED
But, [the crowd quiets down] I feel like I need to come a little clean about something, uh-... it wasn't just Subway sandwiches that made me thin.
SUBWAY REPRESENTATIVE
...Huh?
JARED
The reason I was able to lose so much weight so quickly was that I got aides. [grins with relief. The rep's jaw drops.]
MAN 2
Huh?
MAN 3
What?
MAN 4
Did he say AIDS?
JARED
But I still wanna be the leader in a fitter America, and so I'm here to tell you, that you should ALL go out and get aides! [the crowd immediately begins to disperse]
MAN 2
Oh my God!
A WOMAN
Is he serious?
JARED
Having aides - is - awesome! With aides you can literally watch the fat melt away! And with the proper mix of aides and Subway sandwiches, anything is possible! [the rep, looking on in dismay, has had enough and pushes Jared out of the way to take the mic]
SUBWAY REPRESENTATIVE
Uh, the opinions expressed by Mr. Fogle are not necessarily those of the Subway Company. [Jared soothes his left arm a bit]
[Cartman's living room, some days later. Stan is measuring Butters' girth and grins at the result. Camera zooms out.]
KYLE
Wow! He looks great!
STAN
How do you feel, Butters?
BUTTERS
W-well, k-kinda like Cartman. [Cartman slaps Butters and shakes him] Aw!
CARTMAN
Get a hold of yourself, man!
STAN
Alright, now it's time for phase 2.
[City Wok, moments later. The boys walk towards it and enter. The owner greets them.]
TUONG LU KIM
Welcome to Shitty Wok. You rike to try Shitty Chicken today?
CARTMAN
Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime.
TUONG LU KIM
You want the Shitty Beef?
KYLE
Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok.
TUONG LU KIM
Which one? I see two fat friends.
CARTMAN
[pointing to Butters] The fat one!
STAN
We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world.
TUONG LU KIM
...Why?
KYLE
Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials.
TUONG LU KIM
Oh! You mean like-a Jared?!
CARTMAN
Just like Jared.
TUONG LU KIM
His name is Jared, he lose some weight. Shitty Wok food sure is great. Yeah, okay. That sound good. Saw if he lose weight eating Shitty Wok, I pay use to use him in commercial.
THE BOYS
All right!
CARTMAN
Sir, we are in business!
[Subway company boardroom, day. Jared has been called in to see the board.]
SUBWAY REPRESENTATIVE
[second from left] Jared, first of all we want to say that all of us here at Subway appreciate everything you've done for our company.
JARED
[happily] Well, I appreciate your company doing everything it's done for me.
SUBWAY REP 2
[second from right] Yes, well, it is now the opinion of all of us that perhaps it would be best for you to take your... strange theories on weight loss elsewhere.
JARED
[crestfallen] ...'Scuse me... am I being fired?
SUBWAY REP 3
[center] Jared, it's just that your new take on weight loss is contrary to our commitment to good health.
JARED
How so?
SUBWAY REPRESENTATIVE
Well, your new slogan, for instance. [clears his throat] "When it comes to fitness, Subway goes hand in hand with aides."
JARED
[softly] Ah-hah. [he rises and leaves the "SANDWICH MARKETING" building with hands in pockets. He closes the door and walks away dejectedly. He passes a basketball court where a few people are shooting baskets. He looks at them as he passes by. Then he stops, looks at the camera, sighs, and]
SINGER
His name is Jared. Jared lost weight eating Subway, now he's cold and alone and with no place to call his home. He liked sandwiches with Philadelphia cream cheese.
[Flex Gym Fitness Club, day.]
CARTMAN
[heard from the outside] Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again! [the camera goes inside. People are exercising on all sorts of equipment. A woman runs by on a track on the second floor. Butters is pulling at a rowing machine as Cartman spots him. Cartman is eating Cheesy Poofs and barking orders] You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!
BUTTERS
[looks at Cartman] Wuh hey now, they do too! Uh, my mom and dad - love me even if I am fat.
CARTMAN
[normal] Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.
BUTTERS
Well alright then.
CARTMAN
[barking] Row you fat bitch! Look at those jelly rolls! Nobody loves you! You're not even a person!
[Jared's dressing room, day. Jared paces the room eating a sub sandwich.]
JARED
I never asked to be famous; now everyone hates me! I almost wish I had never gotten aides! [his aides come in]
TYLER
Hey now, come on. What kind of talk is that?
JARED
I'm sorry, guys, but I...I think I wanna be aides-free for a while.
SCOTT
Come on, Jared, lighten up! People don't hate you.
TYLER
Yeah. Maybe they're all just jealous that they can't afford to hire their own aides.
JARED
[brightening] Wait a minute... you're right! [moves towards the camera] Yeah! I think I know how to be a celebrity again! [heads for the door]
[City Wok, outside, later. Cartman and Kyle wait on Stan as he arrives.]
STAN
Did you bring the camera?
KYLE
Yeah, we're all set.
CARTMAN
[steps in between them] Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business.
KYLE
Well, what do you mean?
CARTMAN
Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several.
STAN
That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.
CARTMAN
I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars.
KYLE
Wow! [he and Stan are awed]
CARTMAN
Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea.
BUTTERS
[arrives as Cartman speaks] Hey fellas.
STAN
Butters?! What the hell are you doing?!
KYLE
Yeah, you're still fat!
BUTTERS
Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose it.
CARTMAN
Well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today, you fat piece of crap!
BUTTERS
Well ah I don't know what to tell ya. Losin' weight is harder than puttin' it on.
CARTMAN
No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt!
STAN
[Kyle finally produces the camera] Did you eat only one ounce of City Wok like we told you?!
BUTTERS
Well uh yeah, but ah, I don't know...
KYLE
Why are you doing this to us?!
[Butters' house, later. The boys have prepared a makeshift operating table on the coffee table in the living room. Kyle reads from a medical book, Cartman has a suction tube and pail, and Stan is overseeing the operation.]
STAN
All prepared for liposuction surgery?
CARTMAN
Check.
BUTTERS
Uh, I don't know about this, fellas.
STAN
[shoots back] Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters. [Cartman makes sure the scalpel is sharp]
KYLE
[faces Stan] Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip.
CARTMAN
That should blah [babbles a bit] ah- here. [cuts into Butters' abdomen]
BUTTERS
[reacts] Woahhh!
CARTMAN
Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man!
KYLE
Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision. [Cartman picks up one end of the tube and inserts it into the incision]
CARTMAN
Alrighty.
BUTTERS
Whoa. I think this is a bad idea, fellas. I feel woozy.
CARTMAN
Alright, I think it's in. [turns around]
KYLE
The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. [Cartman stalls, then picks up the other end and starts sucking the fat out]
CARTMAN
[spits out the hose as soon as the fat hits his lips] Bohogh, egh. [puts the hose into the pail for the fat to collect]
BUTTERS
Waaaahh!
CARTMAN
There it goes.
KYLE
Alright, it's working!
CARTMAN
[wipes away a bit of fat remaining on his lips] Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes.
BUTTERS
Aahh heh ahh, I don't feel very good.
STAN
Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault.
BUTTERS
Everything's getting dark...
STAN
We've gotta hurry this up. [moves behind the coffee table to Butter's belly and starts pounding on it. The fat begins flowing out faster]
CARTMAN
[looks at the fat flowing out] Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working good.
STAN
He's losing weight. [Kyle smiles]
CARTMAN
Oh, whoa. Whoa! [the fat rushes out so quickly the tube begins to buck, splattering fat and blood all over the place]
KYLE
It's out of control! [Stan has stopped pounding, but the fat is pulsing out and Cartman can't control it.. Butters gets thinner by the second and headed for shock]
BUTTERS
Whoa, everything's getting sparkly. [the sound of a car pulling up is heard]
STAN
Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home.
CARTMAN
Oh, crap!
STAN
Dude, bail! [the three boys rush out the back door, then the front door opens and Butter's parents walk in. The living room is a mess]
LINDA
Butters? Butters?!
BUTTERS
[listlessly] Mom. Dad.
STEPHEN
Butters. Are you having liposuction surgery? Tell me the truth!
BUTTERS
Yes sir.
LINDA
This is unbelievable! How many times have we told you not to have self-perform liposuction surgery in our house?!
BUTTERS
Four times, mom.
STEPHEN
Well, I guess that wasn't enough! You get up to your room right now, mister!
BUTTERS
Yes, sir. [rises and... struggles. He falls off the coffee table to the floor. Stephen isn't fazed, but Linda is affected]
STEPHEN
Oh, huh- Don't you give us that look young man! You're gonna get it!
[News 4 News, day. A field reporter stands in front of the Mayor's office. The mayor and her aides are present.]
REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing out in front of the Mayor's office, where the big liar, Jared, is once again about to speak. Apparently, Jared hopes to regain his celebrity hero status, which was lost when he announced that it was AIDS, not sub sandwiches, that caused him to lose weight. Let's listen in.
[The podium. Jared stands behind it.]
JARED
Ladies and gentlemen, a-at first I didn't understand why you felt betrayed by the fact that my aides helped me to lose weight, but now I understand that it isn't fair that- I had aides and most of you don't. And so, with all the money I've made from commercials, I have decided to start the Aides for Everyone Foundation!
JIMBO
What?!
JARED
I am going to personally see to it that each and every one of you gets aides! [a long silence follows as the audience just looks at Jared]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
This guy's insane.
JARED
But I won't stop there. I'm gonna seek out all the underprivileged and hungry children of the world, and I'm going to give them aides myself!
CHEF
You're gonna give children AIDS?!
JARED
Yes, it is my hope that every beautiful child on this earth has aides by next month! Aides for everyone! [another long silence]
SKEETER
Get him! [the crowd begins to move forward angrily and Jared leaves the podium]
[Butters' house, some days later. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman show up at the front door, and Cartman rings the bell.]
STAN
Come on, Butters. Time to go.
BUTTERS
Uh- go where?
KYLE
To City Wok so we can make our money. God!
BUTTERS
I can't go anywhere, fellas. I've been grounded for havin' liposuction... surgery. [lifts his shorts to show the bandage over the scar]
STAN
What?
BUTTERS
Wuh well I told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, I can't play outside for five days.
CARTMAN
Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are!
BUTTERS
[counts off] Well you guys have already got me in Dutch for gettin' fat, and then I got in double-Dutch for... havin' liposuction, and now you're askin' me to be in triple Dutch?! [moves his hands palms down to wash his hands of any more trouble] Huh-uh! I'll never be that Dutch!
STAN
...Kenny would have done it.
KYLE
Yep.
CARTMAN
Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was? [whispers] God. [normally] He was always up for helpin' us out; man, he was the best friend ever.
BUTTERS
Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know I'm- I'm up to no good!
CARTMAN
Alright alright, I'll stay here and answer the phone for you.
BUTTERS
No- but you don't sound like me.
CARTMAN
[begins sounding something like Butters. Kyle looks on] Well, you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't help his friends make money.
KYLE
Wow, that was pretty good.
STAN
Alright, it's settled. Come on, Butters. [pulls Butters out the door. Cartman enters the house]
CARTMAN
Don't forget, a third of that four million dollars is mine! [the others leave and he closes the door]
[Stotch living room, inside. Cartman moves to the sofa.]
CARTMAN
Eh. [makes himself comfortable on the sofa and turns on the TV. He grunts a bit] Eh. Yeah. [the phone rings; he answers] Well hello?
STEPHEN
[at an office full of cubicles] I'm just checking in on you, Butters. [a woman walks down the aisle behind him] Uh, do I hear the television? We told you no television while you're grounded!
CARTMAN
Oh, gee whiz, I'm not.. watchin' television, Dad, I'm just... layin' around jackin' it.
STEPHEN
Jacking it? Jacking what?
CARTMAN
Well my hot spicy boner, of course, Dad.
STEPHEN
WHAT?! Are you trying to get yourself in more trouble with that kind of language?!
CARTMAN
Ah, loosen up, you bloody vaginal belch.
STEPHEN
Oh, you're gonna get it, mister! Just wait until I get home!
CARTMAN
Bring it on, queer bait. [hangs up] Aaaahhhh, yes! [puts his arms behind his head, quite satisfied with himself]
[Day, somewhere. Jared has a bat and is beating the hell out of something...]
JARED
...I tell my [paf] girlfriend I have aides and she leaves, I tell the [paf] world to get aides and they think I'm crazy, I offer to give aides to kids and everyone wants me [paf] dead! [the camera pulls back and the thing Jared is beating is a dead horse. Literally] What's wrong with [paf] aides?! Why doesn't anyone want me to give them [paf] aides?! [the crowd arrives with torches, charging noisily]
HERBERT GARRISON
There he is, beatin' that dead horse!
MAN IN CROWD
Alright!
JIMBO
Let's get him! [the crowd charges forward and Jared runs away again]
JARED
Aahhh!
[City Wok. Stan, Kyle, and Butters arrive and enter.]
TUONG LU KIM
Welcome ta Shitty Wok. Take your order prease.
KYLE
We have great news! Our friend has lost forty pounds eating your City Wok food. Here's the before and after photos.
TUONG LU KIM
He lose weight eating Shitty Wok?
STAN
That's right! So now you can pay us to use him in your commercials and you'll have your very own Jared!
TUONG LU KIM
Oh no, no way! I not putting no Jared in my Shitty Wok commercial!
KYLE
Uh, why not?
TUONG LU KIM
Don't you know? Everybody hate Jared. He want everyone in world to have AIDS. He sick in the head.
STAN
What?!
TUONG LU KIM
I don't want Shitty Wok have nothing to do with Jared land his AIDS.
STAN
Wait. Everyone hates Jared now?
TUONG LU KIM
Yah they, they gonna kill him. They gonna kill Jared downtown right now.
STAN
Ugh, come on guys, we gotta sort this out. [the boys exit the store]
[Butters' house, living room. Cartman has eaten quite a bit of food (soda, milk, candy, Cheesy Poofs) and is watching TV - a Terrance & Phillip episode. Only their voices are heard.]
PHILLIP
Here's a man's fart for ya. [farts, laughs]
TERRANCE
God no! [laughs again, and Cartman joins in. The phone rings] Oh, Phillip, your anthrax has given me colon cancer!
CARTMAN
[answering] Hello?
LINDA
[calling in from her office] Butters, your father called and said you made him very upset!
CARTMAN
Yeah, well, Dad's being a little pussy, Mom.
LINDA
[stunned, then] Butters, where did you get that kind of smart mouth?!
CARTMAN
Uh not from you dumbasses, that's for sure.
LINDA
OH, you just WAIT until I get home, mister!
CARTMAN
Oh, I'll be waiting with horse bells on, you old... horse-bangin' skank. [hangs up] Eh. [resumes eating]
TERRANCE
Ey! There's some anthrax over there! [farts, then roars with laughter]
PHILLIP
Oh no, hahahahahahaha.
[Downtown, Mayor's office, outside, day. The crowd has captured Jared and taken him back downtown. A gallows is set up and Jared has had the noose placed around his neck. Two men finish and walk off. The Mayor stands off to one side with her aides.]
JARED
Why did I ever do those stupid commercials?
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Alright, Jared, you sick pervert! Do you have anything to say before you die?!
KYLE
[offscreen] Wait! [the boys run up to the gallows platform] You're all making a mistake!
CHEF
Stand back, children! Jared wants to give you AIDS!
STAN
No, you don't understand. Jared doesn't have "AIDS," AIDS, he has assistants. Two guys that help him lose weight that he calls his aides.
PEOPLE IN CROWD
[softly] Oh.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
You mean, Jared's aides are like my aides?
JARED
Yes. ...Y-you mean you all thought...? Oh my Gosh!
SKEETER
Oh boy, do I feel stupid.
GERALD
Oh we're so sorry, Jared.
JARED
No no, hey it was my fault. I can't believe I- I, I didn't think of what I was saying! [giggles]
CHEF
Eh so he was saying, children should have help like he had! [laughs]
RANDY
Yeah! That has got to be about the biggest misunderstanding ever! [several people laugh]
JARED
[laughing] Oh my God! I told my girlfriend I wanted her to share my aides - oh, no wonder she left!
HERBERT GARRISON
[laughing] Cuh-can you imagine what we thought when you said, "Aides for Everyone Foundation?"
JARED
Oh, brother!
SKEETER
Aha- [stops and realizes something] ...Hey. We're all laughing. [everyone stops and listens]
MR. MACKEY
Uh hey, yeah. We, we woulda never laughed about this before.
RANDY
Well don't you see what this means? It's been 22.3 years, so... AIDS is finally funny!
PEOPLE IN CROWD
Ooo.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
He's right. It happened!
JIMBO
Hey everybody! AIDS is finally funny!
PEOPLE IN CROWD
Alright! Yay! Woohoo! [fireworks come up out of nowhere] Hooray!
MR. MACKEY
I knew it would be funny someday! [laughs] AIDS!
HERBERT GARRISON
Then it's time... We can undo the banner! [fanfare comes up, and a man pulls a curtain away to reveal a huge golden plaque reading "AIDS IS FINALLY FUNNY" Ooohs and aaahs follow.]
[Cut to Times Square, where the crawl reads "3-06-02 AIDS HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY DECLARED FUNNY"]
NEW YORKER
Hooray!
[Cut to Mayor's office, outside. Everyone now has party hats on and are celebrating. The field reporter resumes reporting.]
REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing in the town square where just moments ago it was declared that AIDS... can finally be joked about. What a great day for humanity.
HERBERT GARRISON
[laughs, then] "AIDS quilt" [resumes laughing. The crowd disperses and Tuong Lu Kim finds the boys]
TUONG LU KIM
Oh boy, this is fantastic! I so grad AIDS is funny now.
STAN
Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials?
TUONG LU KIM
Sure 'kay. I pay you fifteen dowlars.
STAN
Fifteen dowlar? But... Jared got millions!
TUONG LU KIM
Hey, I'm not a-Subway, I Shitty Wok. Shitty Wok don't have... million dollars.
STAN
[takes off his hat and throws it on the ground] Oh God-damnit!
KYLE
Aw, just forget the whole thing then!
TUONG LU KIM
Okay. [walks off, returns] Hey, you kids know why chicken cross the road?
STAN
Why?
TUONG LU KIM
'Cause it has AIDS. [laughs. The boys just look at him oddly] AIDS so funny! [walks away laughing]
STAN
Well, so much for our money.
KYLE
Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams.
BUTTERS
Yeah, I don't like shattering fat peoples' dreams. Besides, I'd get grounded. [gasps] Oh, Jesus! I'm supposed to be grounded! [rushes away]
[Butters' house, minutes later. Butters rushes to the front door.]
BUTTERS
Huh. Huh, uh, uh.
CARTMAN
[opens the door in anticipation] There you are, Butters!
BUTTERS
[nervous] Wuh-are my... mom and dad back home yet?
CARTMAN
No, but they're due home any minute. Come on, you're just in time!
BUTTERS
Hoh boy! Mom and Dad didn't... find out I... left the house, did they?
CARTMAN
No, I totally covered for you. They completely believed I was you on the phone!
BUTTERS
Hu-oh! Goody!
CARTMAN
Here you go. [hands Butters some drawings] I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat.
BUTTERS
Uh- perfect.
CARTMAN
Alright I'd better get out of here before they get back. [makes his way to the door]
BUTTERS
Uh hey, uh Eric? [Cartman turns around] Uh- thanks for coverin' for me. You're a real pal.
CARTMAN
Butters, it was my pleasure. [pulls out his mittens and opens the door, then puts them on. He heads for the sidewalk humming a late night theme song, then turns around to frame the house with his fingers, then walks away]
[Butters' house, outside. Cartman, still humming, returns with a beach chair, some popcorn, and soda, and sets them up on the front lawn. He then sits down to watch the coming show. Two cars pull up; it's Butters' parents rushing home. They exit their cars and angrily head for the door. They enter...]
BUTTERS
Hi, Mom and Dad!
STEPHEN
Don't you "Hi, Mom and Dad" us, you little punk!!! [Punch]
BUTTERS
Ow! Dad?
LINDA
You don't even know the trouble you're in, mister!! [Punch]
BUTTERS
Ah! What did I do?! What did I do?!
STEPHEN
You think you're tough now!!? Answer me!!! [a belt is heard coming off and whipping Butters]
BUTTERS
Aaaa!!! [the beating continues]
CARTMAN
Aw, man, if I was older, I would totally start jacking off right now.
End of Jared Has Aides


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:While the adults are trapped at a time-share sales meeting, Stan is challenged by the best skier on the mountain.

script:Asspen

[Butters' house, night, kitchen. Linda is serving drinks. The Marshes and the Broflovskis are at table. Sheila holds Ike on her lap.]
SHARON
Thanks for having us all over for dinner, Chris and Linda.
SHEILA
Yes, it was fabulous!
LINDA
Oh, we're just really happy that your boys have become such good friends with our little Butters!
STEPHEN
Yeah. We figure that if our boys are gonna be great friends, we should all get to be friends, too.
LINDA
Friends, by default. [giggles]
RANDY
Well, our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately. I think ever since their friend Kenny died they've been looking for someone to fill the void.
STEPHEN
Well, our son is a perfect void-filler. It's nice that he finally has your sons to be his best buddies!
[Butters' house, living room. The four boys sit on the sofa looking at television, except Butters is asleep at one end.]
CARTMAN
[alerting the other two] Look you guys, Butters is asleep.
STAN
He's such a douchebag.
CARTMAN
Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick? [drops down] When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water, [takes a glass of water and brings it to Butters' hand] and you put their hand in it... [dunks Butters' hand in it]
STAN
[watches as Cartman climbs the sofa] Yeah, and then what?
CARTMAN
And then, you pee on it! [drops his pants and pees on Butters' hand] heheh-heheheheheheheh.
KYLE
No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee.
CARTMAN
[still peeing] Oh, really? ...Oh well, heh, heheheheh, heh.
[Butters' house, kitchen. Conversation goes on.]
STEPHEN
And we were thinking, since they've all become such close friends, how great it would be for us to all go together to Aspen for a ski weekend.
GERALD
A-Aspen? Uuuh, we, we can't really afford that.
STEPHEN
No, you see, Linda and I found this ad where you can get two night free at a condo in Aspen if you attend a time-share presentation.
RANDY
They let you stay for free?
STEPHEN
Yes! And all we have to do is attend a thirty-minute meeting!
SHEILA
Well that sounds like a good deal.
RANDY
Sounds good to me; let's go this weekend!
SHEILA
Oh, boy! Skiing in Aspen! I can't wait! [an '80s tune begins to play. A shot of the boys in the living room, then the adults pour in from the kitchen]
STEPHEN
Hey boys! We're all going to Aspen for the weekend!
STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
All right! [Butters stirs awake]
BUTTERS
Wow, a ski trip with my new best buddies! [feels some tension as he stretches] Oh, I'm all sticky. [wipes his hands on the sofa and cushions]
[The Rocky Mountains, day. Stephen Stotch drives all three families and Cartman off to Aspen.]
STEPHEN
Here we are, everyone. [Before them lies a valley with many buildings in it. Next to the station wagon is a sign reading "WELCOME TO ASPEN"]
[They proceed into town, a tourist mecca, passing all sorts of high-priced tony stores. The scene freezes, and the new title comes up: "South Park in Aspen", then the scene continues. The adults are in happy awe as a woman walks by with her two poodles in front of a jewelry store. The next shot is of the four boys looking out marveling at the sights. They pass a man snorting cocaine in plain view in front of Bernie's. Next shot is of a resort in which a skier finishes his ski run. The entrance is shown: "Aspen Heaven: A Time-Share Community." The station wagon stops in front of a condominium complex and everyone gets out, making their way to the entrance. Fade out.]
[Fade in, next morning. The adults sit around a coffee table while the kids sit at the dining table eating breakfast behind them. The adults are getting dressed for the day.]
SHEILA
Oh, this is gonna be so much fun; I haven't skied in years!
STEPHEN
Where are Butters and Eric?
STAN
They're still asleep.
STEPHEN
Butters? Eric? Come on! We gotta get to the powder! [a knock on the door, and Linda rises to answer it. Two men enter]
PHIL
[brunet] Hello, folks, I'm Phil and this is Josh [a blond]. We're with the Aspen Time-Share Company. [the other parents gather 'round]
THE PARENTS
Hello.
JOSH
You folks enjoying the condo?
SHEILA
It's lovely. Thank you.
[The dining table.]
CARTMAN
You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe this, this is so funny!
KYLE
What?
CARTMAN
So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler.
STAN
What's a Hitler?
CARTMAN
You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone?
STAN
No, I never have.
CARTMAN
Shh-shh, here he comes.
BUTTERS
Goooood mornin', fellas! All set to go skiin'?! [Cartman starts laughing] A-huh, u-uh, uh what's so funny?
CARTMAN
[knowingly] Nothing, Butters. Right, guys?!
[The front door.]
PHIL
Well, we can't wait to show you what Aspen Time-Share is offering investors. Shall we do our thirty-minute meeting?
RANDY
Oh, do we have to do it right now?
JOSH
Well, best to do it and get it out of the way.
STEPHEN
Okay. [Phil and Josh leave, Sheila steps forward, and the adults begin to exit]
SHEILA
Boys, we have to go to this time-share presentation real quick, but you go meet your ski instructor on the bunny hill.
THE BOYS
Okay.
STEPHEN
We'll meet you boys on the slopes. [exits and closes the door]
BUTTERS
Hey, do you guys smell that?
STAN
Smell what?
BUTTERS
Ehh, it kind of smells stinky in this condo. [Cartman chuckles]
CARTMAN
I don't smell anything. Do you guys? [bursts out laughing. Stan and Kyle just look at him as Butters looks up, wondering...]
[Music fades in. Exterior shots of the resort are shown .The bunny slope is shown. Lifts go up and down as kids practice skiing moves. The four boys and Ike are shown waiting for their instructor.]
BUTTERS
Do you guys smell that? It smells bad out here, too. I'm starting to think this whole town smells like doodoo.
CARTMAN
Yeah, well, that's why they call it Asspen. [laughs at his cleverness. A skier skis up to them]
THUMPER
All right, little dudes, [sets his skis aside] great to see you out here. My name is Thumper, and I'm gonna be your cool ski instructor. [gives the boys two thumbs up]
CARTMAN
[to Stan] His name is Thumper?
THUMPER
We're gonna take it slow, take it easy, make sure everybody has a goood time. 'Cause what is skiing about? Having a good...? [puts his left hand to his ear, hoping for an answer. The boys just look at him] Time, that's right. Now, just a few safety things to keep in mind: First of all, look straight ahead when you ski. You look down, you're gonna fall, you're gonna have a bad time. Also, be aware of skiers around you. You run into another skier, your skis are gonna cross, gonna have a bad time.
BUTTERS
So where's the part where we have a good time?
THUMPER
Hey, little dude, you got some crap right here. [motions to the nose, where Butters does indeed have crap]
BUTTERS
Wuh, that's my face, sir.
THUMPER
Alright, we're gonna do this without any poles until we know our two primary feet positions. To go slow, we wedge our skis together [he puts his indices and thumbs together; front ski tips touch], in the shape of a slice of pizza. Then to go faster, we put 'em parallel, like... French fries. [begins to drift forward] You see that? [wedges the skis] Pizza, [lines up the skis] French fries, [wedges the skis] Pizza, [lines up the skis] French fries. [moves farther away each time]
BUTTERS
Ah-hey, this is gonna be just like eatin' at Shakey's, huh fellas?
THUMPER
Okay, let's have the little dude at the end try first! What's your name?
IKE
Iiiiike!
THUMPER
Okay, Mike, ski down to me! [Ike looks down the hill, but doesn't move]
KYLE
Go on, Ike.
IKE
[begins to practice the positions] Pee-za, Fron fries. Pee-za, Fron fries. Fron friiiies. [skis out of control] Peeee-zaaa [skis for a lodge and right through its wall.]
THUMPER
Okay, you see what he did?! He French-fried when he should've pizza'd. You French-fry when you pizza, you're gonna have a bad time!
[The meeting, meanwhile. Phil and Josh are presenting the time-share plan.]
PHIL
And so, we think we can convince you to buy one of our combos that's opening right here in Phase 4.
JOSH
That sounds like a GREAT investment opportunity!
GERALD
I-I'm sorry, but none of us can really afford to own our own vacation condo.
RANDY
Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal.
PHIL
Oh, I know, that's what everybody says - "Not me, I can't afford it." But what if I told you you could own one of our properties for only eight thousand dollars!
JOSH
Wow!
SHEILA
For only eight thousand dollars we can buy a condo here?
PHIL
Well you see, "time-share" means you buy the condo with about twenty other people like yourselves [exits screen left and immediately enters screen right] You [puts his hands together] "share" the condo with other investors and pick the [points to his watch] "time" you want to stay.
JOSH
[makes a fist with his right hand] Share, [makes a fist with his left hand] time. [joins his fists together] Time share.
RANDY
So then it's not really ours.
PHIL
Sure it is, one twenty-fourth and a half yours! You see, time-share has made it possible for even working-class people like you to say, "I've got a little place in Aspen."
JOSH
Try it. Try saying it. "I've got a little place in Aspen."
THE PARENTS
I've got a little place in Aspen.
PHIL
Rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? Say guys, how'd you like to tell that hot secretary "I've got a nice little place in Aspen?" Hahaha! Just kidding, wives.
RANDY
[looks at his watch] Listen uh, it's been thirty minutes. We'd like to go hit the slopes now?
PHIL
Woll uh, you still gotta come to the time-share luncheon. We did give you a free condo for the weekend.
GERALD
Well your ad said we only had to attend a thirty-minute meeting.
PHIL
Right, but this isn't that meeting. The luncheon is that meeting. [the parents just look at him] Don't worry, you're gonna have a great free meal at the luncheon.
[Bunny slope, later.]
KYLE
[practicing his moves] ...French fries... pizza... french fries... [does the pizza moves and sees Cartman fallen on his back] come on, Cartman.
CARTMAN
Ugh, no more., [Kyle skis on. Stan is skiing as well, and another skier comes up to him, showering him with snow]
TAD
Looks like you think you're a pretty good skier, huh, kid?
STAN
Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess.
TAD
I've been skiing for twenty-two years. Think you could beat me?
STAN
Uhh... no.
TAD
What's your name, hot shot? [two of his friends join him]
STAN
Stan. Marsh.
TAD
Stan Marsh [laughs] Stan DARSH is more like it.
SKIER
Haaaa, Darsh! [his pole is slapped by the first skier's]
TAD
Alright, how about a race, then? You and me.
STAN
Dude, I'm just learning.
TAD
OooooOOOOooo! [starts moving and squawking like a chicken, ending up facing Stan] Looks to me like you're not a "hot shot" after all.
STAN
I never said I was.
TAD
Oooooooo!
TAD'S FRIENDS
Oooooooo!
TAD
You may think you've got what it takes, but as long as I'm around, you'll always be number two! [the two other skiers left] See ya later, Darsh! [laughs, kicks some snow into Stan's face, and skis away]
[The meeting at Aspen Heaven, later. Phil and Josh are still extolling the time-share plan.]
PHIL
And THAT is why owning a piece of an Aspen condo is not only possible,...
JOSH
It's downright smart!
GERALD
Aha. [waiters come in with platters of food]
PHIL
Op, here it is! As promised, a fabulous free lunch!
GERALD
Wow, filet mignon' and lobster!
SHARON
[appreciatively] Not bad. [Sheila and the others begin to eat]
JOSH
It's nice to feel rich, isn't it.
SHEILA
Oh, you know, this is really great.
STEPHEN
It sure is. [the waiters whisk the plates away]
RANDY, GERALD
What?
RANDY
Wait...
PHIL
You see? That's the great thing about time-share. You get a little taste of luxuries you can't afford.
JOSH
And then share it with the people that come tomorrow.
RANDY
All right, look, we've been here for over three hours.
GERALD
Yeah. Can we go now, please?
PHIL
Of course you can. Go hit those slopes! [softly] If you could just please show me the backs of your table place cards real quick? [the others pick up their cards and look] Oh my God! You got the red sticker!
JOSH
They got the red sticker?!
PHIL
They got the red sticker!
STEPHEN
What's the red sticker?
JOSH
Uh, well, well, that means if you come up to the condo sales office you'll receive one of three great prizes.
RANDY
No, no-no-no-no. We, we did your meeting and we did your lunch, we're finished, okay.
PHIL
Okay, okay, fine, I mean... [his voice gradually drops to a whisper] It would only take a second, but, I mean, you know, what did we do for you except, give you a free condo for the weekend. Huh. Seems like you could just... could just come up... and see what prize you had... [Josh begins to cry]
STEPHEN
O-all right!
[The bunny slope, even later. Kyle and Stan are skiing down faster now, mastering the basic pizza-French fries technique.]
STAN
...pizza... french fries... french fries... pizza...
KYLE
...french fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-french fries...[loses control and jerks forward, then flips over and lands next to Ike, who's half-buried in the snow. Kyle looks over and gets up quickly. He dusts himself off as Stan catches up] I wonder where our parents are.
STAN
Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own.
TAD
[arrives, with his friends close behind] Well well well, if it isn't Stan Darsh!
STAN
[winces and covers his face with his right hand] Oh no.
TAD
Say Darsh, you don't mind if I take Heather out for some fondue tonight, do ya?
STAN
Heather? [a woman skis up and stands next to the skier]
HEATHER
Sorry, Stan, it's just that when it comes to skiing, Tad has all the right moves.
TAD
I just might show her my moves tonight, if you know what I mean. [giggles]
HEATHER
You aren't mad, are you, Stan? I mean, a girl's gotta look out for her best interests.
STAN
[just looks at them] ...who are you people?!
TAD
Still don't wanna race me? I told you he was chicken, Heather. Stan Marsh the Darsh! [laughs disdainfully]
STAN
All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone?
TAD AND FRIENDS
Oooooooo!
TAD
Alright, fine. You and me at the summit, now!
STAN
Okay.
TAD'S FRIENDS
Race! Race!
[Ski run, moments later. A view from the bottom shows a long run, and the resort's main buildings off to the right near the finish line.]
ANNOUNCER
Ladies and Gentlemen, Aspen Mountain presents another ex-TREME racing showdown. [the gathering crowd cheers] Seven-time World Aspen champion Tad Mikowski versus eight-year-old Stan Marsh!
TAD
Hah! You're going down, little boy!
STAN
Yeah, prob'ly.
BUTTERS
Do you think Stan has a chance? [the countdown begins. The chutes open and Tad takes off. Stan moves along allowing, sticking to the basic moves] Uh go Stan! [Tad flies down the hill, banking and weaving throughout. Stan appears a few seconds later, going down carefully]
STAN
Fries... fries...
A SKIER
[Tad zooms past him] He's got it! Tad's gonna win it! [as the crowd cheers, Tad clears the last few hills and then goes through the finish line. He comes to a stop and people gather around him]
TAD
[raising his arms in victory] Yeah! Yeeah! Yeah! You lose, Darsh! [kisses Heather, who reacts. They lock lips. Stan finally crosses the finish line, in the wedge position] Yeah! [Butters, Kyle and Ike walk up to Stan]
BUTTERS
U-u-uh, Stan, yo-you gave it your best shot, and that all Jesus asks of you.
STAN
[drops his poles] Dude, I'm just happy this whole stupid thing is all over with. [a group of young adults walk by carrying Tad high in the air. The group stops, the boys turn around to see]
TAD
[looking down at Stan] No hard feelings, right Darsh?! [starts laughing.. The group moves away. The boys turn left as their eyes follow the group] Yeah!
TEEN GIRL
Stan, [the boys turn to see her] for what it's worth, I think you were really brave.
STAN
Thanks. Who are you?
TEEN GIRL
Hey, all the cool teens are gonna be at the youth center tonight for a dance. I hope you'll come because you're just so... we-hell, you're just so.. well, that's all. [turns around and walks off]
[The valley, day. There are three long lines of people waiting to ski. The parents finally make it out of the meeting.]
GERALD
Finally, we get to go skiing!
RANDY
Oh my God, look how long the lift lines are.
GERALD
Yeah, I guess these passes the time-share salesman gave us will come in handy.
LIFT OPERATOR
Can I help you?
STEPHEN
Yes, we have the special passes to use the exclusive lift from the time-share company?
LIFT OPERATOR
Ooooh, go right on ahead, folks.
SHEILA
Thank you. [the parents move forward and position themsleves for the lift, which comes down presently. The parents get on and the lift goes up the slope again]
RANDY
Well, this certainly is nice.
GERALD
Yeah, we may not have gotten to ski earlier, but with this lift we'll get more runs in than anybody.
STEPHEN
Have fun waiting in line, suckers! Woohoohoo!
LINDA
Oh, Chris. [Randy giggles, then looks up]
STEPHEN
Hey look, this chair lift goes right into a building. [the lift turns, drops them off, and moves back out.]
[Aspen Heaven meeting room, again.]
PHIL
Welcome back, folks!
JOSH
We've got a special offer we can't wait to tell you about!
RANDY
Oh, God-damnit!
[Aspen Youth Center. Teens enter from all sides. The boys go in as well.]
KYLE
Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?!
[Aspen Youth Center, inside. The boys find themselves on a dance floor listening to a live band.]
TEEN GIRL
I'm glad you guys came. Do you like our youth center?
STAN
It seems fine.
VOGUING SKIER
Yeah, too bad we're getting shut down. That hot-shot skier Tad's father is gonna bulldoze the building.
VOGUING SKIER 2
Where are all us kids supposed to go?
STAN
Don't care. [the boys go further onto the dance floor]
KYLE
What do you wanna do now?
STAN
I dunno.
BUTTERS
Let's dance. [begins to dance. Cartman watches with dismay. Butters does a bunch of dance moves, including the Moonwalk and some break-dancing]
CARTMAN
Butters, I hate you with every inch of my body. [the music is stopped and a voice is heard]
ANNOUNCER
Alright, Aspen-heh. As a special treat tonight we're proud to have the winner of today's race, Tad Mikowski. [moves off and the crowd begins to cheer as Tad approaches the mic]
TAD
Yeah!
STAN
Oh,. God. [buries his face in his hand again.]
TAD
Hey everyone. [the crowd quiets down] I'd like to sing a little song, if I may.
THE LADIES
[swooning] Ooooooooo.
STAN
Gah, let's go you guys. [turns around and leads the others towards the door...]
TAD
This is a song I wrote about... Stan Marsh. [Stan stops in his tracks]
Staaaaan... Daaaaarsh...
Stan. Darsh. Darshy Daaarsh
Stan Daaarsh
Stan Darsh, Stan-darsh
Stan Daaaaarsh Daaarsh
Stan Darsh...
STAN
Dude, what the hell is your problem?!
TAD AND FRIENDS
OooOOOOOOoooooo!
STAN
I raced you, You won!
TAD
A rematch? Oh, Darsh. You're even dumber than I thought.
TEEN BOY
He'll ski you anytime, anywhere!
TEENS
Yeah!
TEEN GIRL
[talking to Tad, referring to Stan] But this time, if he wins, you get your dad to not close our youth center.
STAN
What?
TAD
Alright then, let's make it interesting. Tomorrow afternoon. On the K-13. [points at a window. The camera pans to the window, and a lone huge peak is shown. Two teens look and are horrified]
A TEEN BOY
[steps into view] The K-13? But that's the most dangerous run in all of America. [steps away]
TAD
Hell, I'm not chicken! Are you, Darsh?! [starts squawking like a chicken]
STAN
I'll be there, you queen!
TAD
Oh, yeah?!
STAN
Yeah!
TAD
Oh, Darsh, you're even dumber than I thought... Again! See ya tomorrow.
[The Youth Center, outside. The boys exit the center.]
BUTTERS
Uh you're not really gonna go down that K-13 run, are ya, Stan?
STAN
Dude, I have to!
KYLE
[shoves Stan a bit and faces him] Stan, you can't let that Tad guy get to you. Screw him, dude.
STAN
Dude, he's got Heather!
KYLE
You don't even know Heather!
STAN
I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't explain it but I have to do this. I'm not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the K-13 be?
MECHANIC
[appears out of nowhere] The K-13? You don't wanna go down that run. That run has got a history. Thirty-five people have died goin' down it, and some say you can still see their ghosts up there. It was on that very ski run that a group of students were killed by a wolf-boy who escaped from a mental institution. You see, that ski run was once a burial ground to a tribe of vampire Wichicaw Indians who ate the flesh of children with no eyes. Yah-, a lot of history on that ski run. [the boys just look at him]
STAN
...Thank you.
MECHANIC
Yah. [moves off]
KYLE
Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned how important friends are. I'm not gonna lose another friend.
STAN
This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!
[Aspen Heaven, next day. The parents are still meeting with Phil and Josh.]
PHIL
...And so you see it's the investment opportunity that keeps on giving.
GERALD
How many times do we have to tell you this? We don't want to buy shares in a condo!
JOSH
And we certainly don't want to pressure you.
GERALD
Pressure us?! You kept us all day yesterday and then had a chair lift bring us back!
PHIL
Heh-ey, you can leave anytime you want. Of course, that is, if you don't want the super-secret fun prize for attending the slide show.
RANDY
[Rises from his chair angrily] No, we don't want the super-secret fun prize alright?! We just wanna ski! Come on, everybody! [leads the others towards the door]
JOSH
I know! Have you ever considered going in on a time share?
PHIL
That's only a couple thousand each, Josh!
RANDY
Don't listen to 'em, let's just go!
[Aspen Heaven, the hallway. The parents walk down the hall.]
GERALD
My God, can you believe those people?!
STEPHEN
I hope you don't blame me for all that. I mean, the ad ...did... just say a thirty-minute presentation.
RANDY
Let's just get out of here. [opens a door across the hall. The parents find themselves in a room exactly like the one they left across the hall]
PHIL
Folks, I'm glad you're back, because we forgot to mention, time-share condos are still deeded properties!
PARENTS
Aaagh!! [they turn around and walk out... er, in]
PHIL
Oooo, you folks really lucked out this time. You're visitor number one thousand!
JOSH
That means you can listen to our special offer for privileged members only!
RANDY
That does it! I'm calling the police! [takes out the cell phone and begins dialing. One of the salesmen groans softly]
[Bunny slope, day. Beginners practice their moves. A girl stands next to Thumper; he sets her up and sends her on her way.]
STAN
[approaches] Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13.
THUMPER
K-13?! But you're just a beginner! You ski outta your league, you're gonna have a bad time.
STAN
I have to do this, okay? I have to!
THUMPER
Alright, well, if you gotta get good at somethin' really fast, there's only one way to do it. Come on!
[A song begins to play. Thumper is giving Stan some quick instructions and then Stan starts skiing. Thumper looks on, encouraging.]
SINGER (AND BACKUP SINGERS)
The day is approaching to give it your best
You've got to reach your prime!

[Thumper and Stan do some Tai Chi on their skis, then Thumper has Stan ski down the hill blindfolded while he takes notes on technique and time]

That's when you need to put yourself to the test
And show us the passage of time
We're gonna need a montage (Montage)
A sports-training montage (Montage)

[The teen girl is reading to Stan from a book: Skiing for "DUMBASSES." Then Thumper spots Stan as Stan does barbells, then has him do a few more runs. The times aren't satisfactory.]

And just show a lot of things happenin' at once.
Remind everyone of what's goin' on. (What's goin' on?)

[Bulldozers show up at the youth center to knock it down, but a group of families shows up to protest the demolition. Next shot, the parents are still at those meeting, getting quite weary and tired]

And with every shot, show a little improvement
To show it won't take too long
That's called a montage (Montage)
Even Rocky had a montage (Montage)

[Stan skis down a little faster, and Thumper shows him how much he's improved. Tad is then shown polishing his skills, landing after a ski jump and receiving Heather into his arms. The girl reads to Stan some more, but Stan's fallen asleep. She rouses him and resumes the lesson]

In any sport, if you want to go
From just a beginner to a pro
You'll need a montage (Montage)
a simple little montage (Montage)

[she shows Stan a few pictures in her book. Next, Stan is skiing down the hill with bricks weighing his shoulders down. Kyle stands on a bluff with a picture of himself and Stan and looks wistfully at it and at K-13. Cartman rubs his finger into his ass and gives a sleeping Butters the Hitler again. Cartman stifles a laugh]

Always fade out (Montage) into a montage (Montage)

[Again, Stan skis down the hill with Thumper looking on. Now Thumper approves of the time. The instructor, the teen girl, and Stan look out at K-13 from a nearby hill, the camera at their backs]

If you fade out it seems like a long time (Montage) has passed in a montage (Montage)
Montage (Montage)

[The camera faces the trio now and zooms out slowly. Stan sets his skis down and steps into them, then skis down the slope. Fade out]
[Aspen Heaven meeting room, day. Two officers are present with the two salesmen and the six parents.]
RANDY
All the ad said was that we had to attend a thirty-minute meeting, right, and- and it's been a day and a half! These guys won't let us leave!
PHIL
That's not true, officers, we said they could leave at any time.
THIN COP
All right, let me see if I got this straight. You two gentlemen are offering part-time limited liability [suddenly animated] ownership in one of your fabulous condos for the one-time price of eight thousand dollars?!
PHIL
That's right!
FAT COP
Sounds to me like if anybody should be arrested it should be you people for passin' up such a great deal!
THIN COP
That's right, you're practically stealing condos at that price. "Book 'em, Danno!" [laughs. The parents look on, chagrined]
RANDY
Oh, Jesus.
LINDA
No! No!
GERALD
The police work for time-share, too? [the police draw their guns and aim at the parents]
PHIL
[somewhat menacing, moves forward] The police, the mayor, the president of the United States. Perhaps now you see the severity of your situation. I think we shall all sit down... [backs up] and listen to the presentation.
JOSH
[draws his own gun and aims] Sit! [the parents go to the table and sit on the chair]
PHIL
Now, you're probably asking yourselves... "Can my time-share condo turn into a profit?"
JOSH
"What kind of cash flow can I realize from my investment?"
PHIL
The answer might astonish you. For over ten years investors have seen their-
[Aspen Heaven ski run, finish line area, day.]
ANNOUNCER
The powder is fresh and the stage is set for Tad versus Stan on the K-13!
[K-13 peak. Tad and Stan are ready to ski.]
TAD
This time you're not just gonna lose, you're gonna die!
[Finish line area. The other boys and Ike are present, with their instructor behind them.]
KYLE
I can't lose another friend. First Kenny and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left are you two douches. [Cartman gives him an angry look]
ANNOUNCER
Ready. Set. Go! [the crowd cheers and Tad takes off. Stan begins to ski]
STAN
Pizza... pizza... pizza...
MAN IN YELLOW JACKET
Tad's got the lead.
BUTTERS
Come on, Stan! [Tad is shown zipping down the hill, Stan is still at the summit making his way down]
TAD
[stops near a tree] Haha. [pulls out a small saw hidden in the back side of his jacket] This should slow down Darsh a bit! [goes to the tree and starts sawing it off at the base. Stan has gone down the mountain some more]
ANNOUNCER
[the crowd cheers the skiers on] And it looks like Tad is way out in front.
TAD
[finishes sawing the tree in two and laughs] Now, I'll win for sure!
KYLE
Awgh, dude, I can't look. [closes his eyes and covers them with his hands Tad is shown zipping further down the hill, Stan has left the summit]
TAD
[stops and looks up the hill, then leaves. He returns with a bucket of sand and pours it out]
Let's see what some sand does to your speed, Darsh! [leaves. Stan continues his run. Tad returns with more sand and pours it out]
He doesn't stand a chance, now! [Stan reaches the fallen tree and climbs over it, then continues his run. Tad pours out even more sand]
I'm gonna beat 'em! [tosses the bucket away and leaves]
ANNOUNCER
[as the crowd cheers] The race is half over and Tad is still out in the lead! [Stan is moving along nicely. Tad stops further down and pushes a large cage of hamsters onto the slope]
TAD
Heh, when Darsh skis by here, I'll let all these hamsters go. That should distract him just long enough for me to win the race!
TEEN GIRL
[walks in] Oh, Tad.
TAD
...What are you doing up here?
TEEN GIRL
Oh nothing. I just thought I could distract you. With these. [lifts up her jacket and top. Tad look and is unable to move as he groans at what he sees. Stan moves along in the background and passes Tad, who remains spellbound. Stan reaches the finish line and breaks it. The boys and the crowd cheer the victory and approach Stan. Another song begins to play]
KYLE
Good job, dude!
STAN
Thanks. [Tad reaches the finish line to see the celebration start without him. He takes off his goggles and throws them to the ground in anger]
ANNOUNCER
You did it, Stan! [Tad approaches Heather, who gives him the cold shoulder and walks away. Tad is crestfallen]
TEEN GIRL
Thanks a lot, Stan. Now we're gonna be able to keep the youth center. [the crowd cheers louder, and the mechanic stops by]
MECHANIC
Well, that does it. Looks like the spirits of the Wakichaw Indians can finally rest in peace. [three spirits rise from K-13 thanking Stan for setting them free.]
HEATHER
[walks up to Stan] Stan, I was wrong about you. Would you like to go out again? [Stan looks at her incredulously]
TEEN GIRL
Go ahead, Stan. She's everything you ever wanted. [the parents arrive]
SHEILA
There you are, boys!
KYLE
Mom, Dad!
STAN
Where the hell have you guys been?!
STEPHEN
Uh, we got a little held up at the time-share sales office.
RANDY
Yeah, but the good news is we finally came to our senses and bought some shares in a condo. So we all get to come to Aspen for two weeks every year!
THE BOYS
[disappointed] Awwwwww!
STEPHEN
What's the matter? Didn't you boys like skiing? [the song is stopped abruptly]
STAN
No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks! [turns right and leads the other boys away]
KYLE
Yeah, what a stupid sport! [the parents turn left and follow the boys away]
THUMPER
[looks at the teen girl] I heard that you were the one responsible for making Tad lose the race. Thanks.
TEEN GIRL
Yeah. Well he really flipped when he saw these. [lifts up her jacket and top again and two creatures appear where her breasts should be]
LEFT CREATURE
[softly, slowly] Quaid...
RIGHT CREATURE
[softly, slowly] Start the reactor...
End of Asspen

synopsis:All the kids in South Park are glued to the TV, wild with anticipation to see the first trailer for the latest Terrance and Phillip movie.

script:The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer

[Stan's house, night. Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Butters gather some snacks and put them on the coffee table in the Marsh living room.]
STAN
[pouring chips into a bowl] This is gonna be so awesome!
KYLE
Do we have everything?
STAN
Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anything!
CARTMAN
All right!
KYLE
Look, it's almost time.
[HBC commercial.]
ANNOUNCER
Up next on HBC, the Russell Crowe Show!
[The sofa. The boys climb on it.]
STAN
Alright, here we go.
[Russell Crowe Show intro.]
CHOIR
Born in New Zealand in sixty-four
[Russell sails on a tugboat called "Tugger"]
A hot-headed actor named Russell Crowe
[Russell holds an Oscar lovingly]
He loves to act but he loves one thing more:
[Russell in a scene from "Gladiator"]
Fight-in' Round The World
[Russell fighting bar patrons at Hap's Bar]
He fights his directors and he fights his fans
[Russell holds a director up in the air by the lapels, then he fights fans in a pool hall]
It's a problem no one understands
[Russell fights people in Paris]
[spoken by a singer]
If there's two things he love it's fighting and,
[Russell dances Russian before the Kremlin as a camera man follows him at a distance]
Fight-in' Round The World
[The cameraman takes a picture and Russell beats him up]
Makin' movies, makin' music and
[a poster of Russell's new movie, "A beautiful Mind, by television's Opie", then a shot of him recording a song]
[slowing to half-time]
Fight-ing Round The World!
[a shot of Russell fighting off some Japanese]
[spoken by a singer as a spinning globe appears behind the show logo]
Russell Crowe
RUSSELL CROWE
[dressed as a sailor, standing on a dock] Hello, everybody. I'm Russell Crowe, and this is "Fight-in' Round The World" [puts up his fists and cycles them around]. We're gonna have lots of fun tuhday as we travel all around, and look for some good- [a man walks through his shot and Russell does a double-take, then goes after the man] Ay! What the hell do yuh think you're doin'?! [Russell's cameraman moves the camera to catch up with him] You walked right through my shot, mate! Do you know who I am?!
MAN
Oh, excuse me. I was just- [Russell proceeds to beat the crap out of the man]
RUSSELL CROWE
God-damned smartass! Do you think you could [Shelly comes in and takes the remote, changing the channel. She stops at the WD]
STAN
Shelly, we're watching that! Go back!
SHELLY
Shut up, turd. I'm watching Buffy.
STAN
[rushes up to her] No! Shelly, we have to watch HBC! [she switches back to HBC]
[Russell Crowe Show.]
RUSSELL CROWE
Oh! Get up! Get up, you little pussy! [the man crawls along the dock on his belly]
SHELLY
The Russell Crowe Show? You turds don't even like that show!
RUSSELL CROWE (OFF-SCREEN)
Oh ya like that do ya?! [punches heard]
STAN
It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie!
KYLE
It's the biggest night of the year.
SHELLY
[switching channels again] That's stupid! See your turdy trailer some other time!
STAN
But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow.
SHELLY
No, turds!
CARTMAN
Shelly, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are?
SHELLY
Shut up, fat turd!!
CARTMAN
I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd!
SHELLY
We're not watching this! [a shot of Russell Crowe and the man]
RUSSELL CROWE
Come on!
MAN
Look, I apologize, but I was just--
STAN
But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe.
SHELLY
[softly, voice rising] There is one thing I love more than Russell Crowe, and that is seeing you unhappy. So, Buffy it is!
STAN
Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything!
SHELLY
[glances away, then looks at Stan] All right. I just started my period, and I need tampons. If one of you turds go buy them at the store for me, you can watch your stupid turd show with your stupid turd movie commercial in it!
STAN
[glances down, then answers] O-K, deal.
SHELLY
And they'd better be here when I come back downstairs, turds! [slaps Stan twice and walks off]
RUSSELL CROWE
Well, that was a lot of fun, wadn't it, kids? But it looks like if we're gonna get in more fights, we're gonna have to go look for 'em.
KYLE
[gathers around Stan with the other boys] Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway.
BUTTERS
Ehyeah!
STAN
[somber] Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch.
KYLE
You'd miss the new trailer?
STAN
Dude, I'm not going.
CARTMAN
Alright, we'll have to play for it. How about... if your name is Butters, you have to go. Okay, so what's your name? [points to Stan]
STAN
Stan.
CARTMAN
Stan, okay. What's your name? [points to Kyle]
KYLE
Kyle.
CARTMAN
Kyle. What's your name? [looks at Butters]
BUTTERS
Butters! Aw, I lose, huh?
CARTMAN
Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break.
KYLE
Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break.
BUTTERS
Oh, Jesus. Ah, I gotta run like the wind. [heads for the door. The other three go back to the sofa]
RUSSELL CROWE
Seems like no one else here wants to fight.
KYLE
Dude, thank God for stupid people ["...We'll have to go somewhere else..."]
CARTMAN
Amen.
RUSSELL CROWE
...lets ask our old friend, Tugger. Where should we go fight people next, Tugger?
TUGGER
TOOOOOOT
RUSSELL CROWE
Great idea! [runs up to the camera] Tugger thinks we should go to the faaar away country of China. [backs up towards the tug boat] China is one of the oldest civilizations on earth. And from what I understand, they LOVE a good fight! So let's go! [rushes onto the tugboat and sets off.]
TUGGER
TOOOT TOOOT [a man and a woman appear]
MAN WITH MUSTACHE
Oh my God! It's Russell Crowe!
RUSSELL CROWE
[taunts back] Oh my God, it's Russell Crowe! Oh my Gmah, bah bah byah byah! [gets out and heads for the man and woman] Why don't you mind your own business, you scrotum?! [punches the man. Cut to a sailing Tugger]
Making movies, making songs 'n fight-in' round the world.
STAN
Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up?
RUSSELL CROWE
[at the wheel] What a glorious day to spend a way, fight-in' round the world. [whistles and spins the boat's wheel]
CARTMAN
What's wrong with the colors on your TV, Stan? They're all saturated. [takes a hold of the remote]
STAN
They look fine to me. [another shot of Russell sailing away]
KYLE
Just don't mess with it, Cartman.
CARTMAN
[leaves the sofa] Nah, nah, the cable wire must be loose. [heads for the television]
KYLE
Just just leave it alone.
CARTMAN
Dude, do you wanna see the Terrance & Phillip trailer with messed-up colors? I don't. How's that? [moves the cable, and the vertical goes out of whack]
STAN
That's worse!
CARTMAN
Okay, how about ... that? [moves it again, and the cathode ray tube pops. The wall behind the TV is blackened, and Cartman slowly peeks]
STAN
Dude!
KYLE
God-dammit Cartman! You broke it!
CARTMAN
[panicked] It was just... I just... Butters, you asshole!
STAN
Dude, the commercials could start any time!
CARTMAN
I don't think we're watchin' them on this TV.
KYLE
God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house!
STAN
Get all the stuff! [they gather the snacks and head for the front door. Cartman opens the door and Butters arrives]
BUTTERS
Hey fellas. I got the tampons. Uh, I didn't miss it, did I?
STAN
We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on! [the three boys exit]
BUTTERS
Oh Jeez. [follows]
[The neighborhood. The boys run towards Kyle's house. Stan leads the way, with Kyle and Butters following.]
BUTTERS
Oh boy, uh, Oh Jeez, Oh Jeez!
STAN
Hurry! We can't miss the commercials!
CARTMAN
[gruffly] Bluh! Aah! You guys! Seriously!
[Kyle's house, moments later. Ike is watching TV.]
A VOICE
[a slow drawl] ...but the Palestinian government uh is not going to see any for future- [the front door opens and the boys run in.]
STAN
Huff, huff
BUTTERS
Huh uh hurry! Hurry! Hurry! [Kyle takes the remore and quickly changes channels, and the Russell Crowe show pops up]
RUSSELL CROWE
And so here we are in history-rich Ch-ooina.
KYLE
We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet. [the boys sit on the sofa. Ike looks at each of them angrily]
KYLE, STAN, BUTTERS
Phew!
IKE
Hey! Imong telling Dat!
CARTMAN
[arrives breathless] Huh. Ohmigod! Huh.
IKE
Dadadadat!
KYLE
No Ike! They're playing the trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie during the show, and we have to watch it! [Ike drops down and walks away, Cartman sits next to Butters]
RUSSELL CROWE
[hiding behind a potted shrub which he carries before him. He sets it down and look at the camera] This is Tiananmen Square. Lots of good foightin' has gone on here throughout the years, including a fan-tastic massacre that took place back in '93. [he turns back to the shrub and peers through it. The Chinese are pleasantly involved in conversations. Russell turns back to the camera] These chinamen can grow to over five feet tall, and in a fight, are known to kick with their legs. Let's see if we can get in for a closer look. [picks up the shrub and goes further into the crowd, then peers through the shrub. The Chinese notice him] Oi! [he looks back at the camera] I've gotten close enough now that they're startin' to get real froigh'ened. You can see the fine hairs on the back of their necks standin' on end. [turns to the shrub and jumps through it, grabbing a man's ankles] Gotcha mate! [the victimized man speaks first, then another man answers. Russell's head turns to see who's speaking, then he jumps up to challenge the second man] Ah, you wanna fight, huh?! [challenges the first] Think you could take me, you little buggers?! [punches the first man and the man sails to the ground a few feet away, knocked out cold. Blood pours from his nose. The man he lands in front of decides to fight, and soon Russell Crowe is punching men away left and right. A policeman arrives, and Russell knocks him away, too]
CARTMAN
God, when is this gonna get to the commercials? [Gerald arrives with Ike]
GERALD
Kyle, Ike says you kicked him off the TV.
KYLE
They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer.
GERALD
You know your brother watches MacNeil/Lehrer Report every night at ten!
IKE
Etetheh bunlapala un night.
KYLE
But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen footage.
GERALD
It doesn't matter! Ten to eleven is Ike's time to watch MacNeil/Lehrer.
KYLE
God-dammit. Come on, guys. We gotta go to Butters' house.
STAN
Aww! [the boys gather their snacks and head for the door]
CARTMAN
Argh!
BUTTERS
Whoa, wait fellas. [the boys stop] We can't go to my house.
CARTMAN
We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated.
STAN
AGH! [thinks hard, then] Wait! Chef just got a new plasma screen TV with surround-sound. Let's go to his house! Come on! [they leave. Ike goes back to the sofa and sits, changing the channel]
LEHRER
...taking place there all these years is sure to continue until the governments of these regions can actually come about some...
IKE
It's a birdy fly.
[The neighborhood. The boys run towards Chef's house. Stan, Kyle, and Butters run past, huffing and puffing.]
CARTMAN
[trailing again] Ey! You guys! I'm seriouslih!
[Chef's house, moments later. The boys are at his front door, and Stan knocks.]
KYLE
God-dammit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother!
CHEF
[answers the door in his nightgown] Oh. Hello there, children.
THE BOYS
[quickly] Hey Chef. [run for his sofa, leaving Chef at the door.]
CHEF
Uh, how's it goin'?
[Chef's living room. The boys are seated on the sofa, with Stan trying to get the remote control working.]
CHEF
[arrives] Oh, you wanted to see the new TV, huh? [a new HDTV with side speakers and settop cable box, and a rather large base] Pretty cool, ain't it?
STAN
[impatient] Yeahyeah, how do you change the channels?
CHEF
Uh, I don't know. This TV has more features than a space shuttle. [Chef takes the remote and fiddles with it] I can't figure it out at all. [the program pops up immediately]
RUSSELL CROWE
[in India] -bloomin' Taj Mahal.
CARTMAN
There, you got it, you got it!
RUSSELL CROWE
[punching the natives - hits one] Freakin' Indies [hits a second] really put up a [hits a third] fight!
STAN
We made it!
CARTMAN
Oh, thank God.
CHEF
Russell Crowe?? Children, you shouldn't be watching this show about a man who beats people up because he's insecure.
CARTMAN
We don't give two craps about Russell Crowe, Chef. We just wanna see the trailer for the new Terrance & Phillip movie, that's supposed to play during the commercials.
RUSSELL CROWE
[still punching Indians as they approach] Alright everyone, we're gonna take our first commercial break. But be sure not to go anywhere, because there's lot's more people to beat up!
STAN
Here they come!
KYLE
Heuh, the commercials! [some commercials air, but they're not important, as little sound is heard]
ANNOUNCER
And now back to Russell Crowe, Fightin' Around The World!
THE BOYS
[disappointed] Awww!
BUTTERS
Awww, they didn't play it. They didn't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer.
STAN
I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the first commercial break.
KYLE
Yeah, they want everyone to stick around and watch more of this retarded show.
RUSSELL CROWE
Making movies, making songs 'n fight-in' round the world. [cut to Brooklyn, with the Brooklyn Bridge in the background. A lot of brownstones here. Russell has brought his schrub with him again. He approaches the camera] Oi! Now Tugger's brought me to one of the greatest places for foightin' in North America. [backs up] Brooklyn, New York. Lots of minorities here, and they don't take kindly to whitey. [points to himself] Let's get a closer look. Come on, Tugger! [picks up his shrub and runs. Tugger hops after him, tooting along. They end up looking at a pickup basketball game in the shadow of some skyscrapers. Russell peers through the shrub, then turns to the camera] Looks like we got some black people, and some Puerto Ricans. [a quick peek] Notice the colorful rags on their heads, meaning they could be part of a gang, and therefore, [makes a fist] real used to fightin'. [peers through the shrub]
BLACK PLAYER
Hey, look at that guy over there. Ain't that that Gladiator guy?
PUERTO RICAN PLAYER
Where?
BLACK PLAYER
Behind that plant, next to that tugboat? [Russell peers through, but the shows his face]
PUERTO RICAN PLAYER
Oh yeah, I think it is.
RUSSELL CROWE
[in condescending falsetto] Oh my God, it's the Gladiator guy! [heads for the basketball court and puts up his fists] Oh my God, I've never seen an actor before! [moves around for anyone to fight] Why don't you choke on some pig vomit, you stupid sobs!
CHEF
Why can't this guy control his temper?
RUSSELL CROWE
Well?? You all just gonna stand there or are you gonna fight? [knocks down a black player. Another one punches him in the back of the head] Oi! Crikey, you've done it now!
CARTMAN
This TV is great, Chef.
CHEF
Yeah, and it's got all kinds of cool features, too. Check this out. You can watch three channels all at once. I think if you hit this button here- [a menu pops up on a blue screen. He presses more buttons and the default choice changes, but nothing else] No, no wait. You hit this button here [ends up at clock reset function] No, that's not it. Let's see. [presses another button] Menu... [press] Function [screen properties pop up]
STAN
Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon. [looks like Russell is fighting Germans, but the menu windows block the view]
CHEF
Let's see. Menu? [screen resolution, manual programming, spectrum density, profiles, audio settings, and so on pop up] Aw, dammit!
KYLE
Get it back to normal, Chef!
CHEF
I'm tryin', children! Menu, back, function- [still no success. The blue screen is still there] Enter? No, no. Back? H.E.M?? [selects 'yes']
THE TV
[transforms itself into a robot] Human eradication mode, active. [it rises from its base, which becomes its feet. The side speakers re-position themselves as guns, and the cable box becomes the eyes. Chef and the boys are stunned by what they just saw. The TV turns to its right and heads for the front door. It breaks through, goes down the steps, and immediately starts firing at everything in sight.]
STAN
Oh God-dammit!
KYLE
The TV left.
BUTTERS
Uh but the next commercials will be on soon.
STAN
Come on, we gotta go somewhere else! [the four get off the sofa and head out the door. A car screeches to a halt, and the TV fires at the driver, forcing the couple inside to flee]
[The neighborhood. The boys run towards the bar. Stan, Kyle, and Butters run past, huffing and puffing.]
BUTTERS
Where do we go? Where do we go?
STAN
The bar! They've got a TV at the bar!
CARTMAN
Aagh! God-dammit!
[The bar. The boys burst through the door and head for the counter. The TV turns on to the Russell Crowe show.]
RUSSELL CROWE
[back in Brooklyn, amid the bunch of beat-up basketball players] You fight like Norwegians, ya fairies!
THE BOYS
Phew!
STAN
We made it.
CARTMAN
[blubbering] This is killing me. The human body was not meant to move quickly like that.
[The Russell Crowe show.]
RUSSELL CROWE
These are the Florida Keys, a remote island chain just a few miles from... Oi! Wait a minute! Wasn't I just in Brooklyn fightin' minorities? What happened with that?
TUGGER
Mooooot.
RUSSELL CROWE
It's that God-damned editor! He cut the Brooklyn scene short! Tugger, I'm gonna get him!
[The editing room, moments later.]
EDITOR
Yeah. Oh I'm just working. I'm probably done around seven. [the door flies open and Russell stomps in there]
RUSSELL CROWE
[lifts the editor up by the collar] Who the hell do you think you are?!
EDITOR
I'm the editor.
RUSSELL CROWE
I know you're the bloomin' editor! I mean, who do you think you are cuttin' one of my foightin' scenes short?!
EDITOR
Dude, the director said to cut it.
RUSSELL CROWE
Moy foightin' is poetry! You don't edit Russell Crowe's poetry, you testicle! [drops him, pauses, then delivers three blows to the belly]
JIMBO
Well that guy's just plain nuts.
BARKEEP
[rushes over] Hey hey hey, whoa, you kids can't be in here. [the kids are dumbstruck]
KYLE
We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism! How dare you assume that all midgets are children! We demand an apology!
BARKEEP
You ain't midgets, your lips are too full. [the boys stay silent] Now GET OUT!!
STAN
But we have to watch the commercials in this show.
BARKEEP
Look, this is a bar! We can't have children in here. People come here for debauchery and sin!
CARTMAN
Butters will give hand jobs in the corner for a dollar.
BUTTERS
Sure! I'm good at all kinds of jobs!
BARKEEP
GET OUT!!! [walks over and turns the TV to a baseball game]
THE BOYS
Aaah!
STAN
[the first to head for the door] Come on, we gotta get to a TV! [the others follow]
CARTMAN
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me!
[Downtown South Park. The TV, now a robot, marches through town blasting holes into buildings. Chef follows behind on a cell phone.]
CHEF
Yes, is this customer service? I'm havin' problems with my new television. It sprouted legs and guns 'n started walkin' around shootin' people. Uh huh. Okay. Ohhh, so I press "menu," then "function." [presses the buttons. The TV shoots at a man locking up a store, making him spill his groceries and fall on his back. The TV stops]
TOWNSMAN
Jesus! [gets up and runs] Waaaah! [the TV moves forward again]
CHEF
No, that didn't work. Did I set the internal clock? Uh, no. [listens] Oh, really? Well, how do I do that?
[Shady Acres, A Retirement Community. The boys rush in and head for the empty seats in the TV room.]
CARTMAN
Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold it! [once the boys are in place, Stan walks over to the TV and turns it on. "Puppies From Around The World" comes on, and Stan quickly changes the channel to the Russell Crowe show]
KYLE
We're not too late! [the boys grin]
RUSSELL CROWE
Come on, Tugger ol' mate. Why are you lookin' so down?
TUGGER
Mooot, mooot.
RUSSELL CROWE
[whispers to the camera] Tugger's in a bit of a sad state. Seems his girlfriend and him had a bit of a row last night.
TUGGER
Mooooot.
OLD MAN
[everyone watches silently, then] ...What is this?
[The Russell Crowe show.]
RUSSELL CROWE
Come on. Cheer up, Tugger. How can I make you feel better? I know! [grabs a guitar off-screen and prepares to play it.] How would you like me to sing one of the songs off me new album?
TUGGER
[shakes its smokestack with each protest] Nooo! Nooooo!
RUSSELL CROWE
What's that, Tugger? You say you really love the songs on my album?
TUGGER
Noooooooooo! [shakes its smokestack]
RUSSELL CROWE
Alright then, Tugger. [begins strumming]
TUGGER
Noo, no! [shakes its smokestack]
RUSSELL CROWE
You know that you're my baby. You know I need you now.
TUGGER
[tries to escape, but can't, as it's tied to the dock] Noooooooooo! [shakes its smokestack]
RUSSELL CROWE
I don't know where I'm goin', I gotta get there some, yeah gotta get there, somehow.
TUGGER
[returns and tries to rip itself away towards the right with all its might] Noooooooooo! [turns and tries to pull itself away towards the left, but can't]
RUSSELL CROWE
Gotta get there somehow.
TUGGER
[continues to struggle] Noooooooooo! [turns and tries to pull itself away towards the left, but can't]
RUSSELL CROWE
You can stay away tonight, but I'm gonna sleep here, in my explosive clouds...
TUGGER
[returns, then takes out its arms for the first time] NOOOOO! [pulls out some giant earmuffs and places them over the cabin doors. It shakes violently as Russell lunges into a faster rhythm]
RUSSELL CROWE
SHOUT! Think I feel your heartbeat, can you feel mine... lady lookin' lovely, gotta take your love inside, gotta take it...
TUGGER
[struggles fiercely] NOOOOO! NOOOOO! [throws its earmuffs off, reaches for a pistol and places it against its smokestack. Tugger fires the gun, and it falls into the water with a splash. Russell stops singing once he hears the gunshot..]
RUSSELL CROWE
[spins around] Tugger! [drops to the edge of the dock and looks down at the water. Tugger is on its side leaking oil] Tugger shot himself!
ANNOUNCER
[the show logo pops up] Has Russell lost Tugger for good? Find out after these messages.
[Shady Acres TV room.]
CARTMAN
Here we go!
STAN
Commercial Break Number Two! [the boys are positively giddy with anticipation]
ANNOUNCER
And now back to Russell Crowe, Fightin' Around The World!
CARTMAN
That's it? That's all the commercials?
KYLE
They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip trailer again!
STAN
I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break.
KYLE
Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this whole retarded Russell Crowe show!
[The Russell Crowe show. Russell Crowe is sobbing on a sofa in a hospital hallway.]
RUSSELL CROWE
Tugger! Why'd you do it, Tugger?! [a doctor approaches him] Doctor! Tell me how he is, doctor!
DOCTOR
Well, he's a very sick little tugboat.
[Shady Acres TV room.]
OLD MAN
What is this? We wanna watch "Puppies From Around The World."
OLD WOMAN
Yeah. We don't like this show.
CARTMAN
Shh. Okay?! Old people need to be quiet right now!
[The Russell Crowe show.]
RUSSELL CROWE
You gotta save him, Doc! Tugger! 'E's my best friend! The only friend in the world who would-
DOCTOR
He's going to live, but-
RUSSELL CROWE
[lifts the doctor up by the collar] Oi! Don't you interrupt me, you vag-oina! I was givin' a heart-wrenchin' soliloquy about me feelings for Tugger!
DOCTOR
Sorry.
RUSSELL CROWE
[lets the doctor down and crosses the hall to the opposite wall] Oh, Tugger! Tugger, the world won't be as bright without ya, mate! Give it to me straight, doctor! Will Tugger live?! Tell me the truth!
DOCTOR
...Now?
RUSSELL CROWE
Yes, now's fine.
DOCTOR
Oh. Uh, your tugboat's going to be okay. He just needs an oil change and a new steamstack.
RUSSELL CROWE
[quickly brightens and approaches the camera] Ooo, de-lolly! D'you hear that, everybody?! Tugger's gonna be okay! D'you know what that makes me feel like doin'? Foightin'! [turns around and punches the doctor out, then punches a man on crutches out, lifts him up again, and punches him out again.]
[Shady Acres TV room.]
OLD MAN
This show is too violent! Put the puppies back on!
OLD FOLKS
Yeah!
OLD WOMAN 2
Please.
CARTMAN
Shut up! Shut the hell up! We're watching this until the next commercial and that's final, old people!
OLD MAN 2
All right, that does it! We know how to get our way! Everyone, on the count of three, release your bowels! One! Two! [everyone farts and the boys are astonished.]
THE BOYS
[bury their noses in their jackets] Awww!
CARTMAN
Eewww!
STAN
Oh, God, it's horrible! [the boys leave and exit the community]
[Shady Acres entrance.]
KYLE
That's disgusting, dude!
CARTMAN
God, I hate old people!
STAN
We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go!
BUTTERS
I told you, we can't go to my house!
CARTMAN
And my house is being fumigated!
STAN
Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated!
[The neighborhood. The boys rush to Cartman's house.]
BUTTERS
Oh boy, we gotta hurry, guys! ...Come on! [Cartman struggles to keep up, blubbering all the while]
[Cartman's house and garage, under purple and orange tarps. The boys enter a living room filled with fumigation gas, which makes the room look foggy.]
STAN
Turn it on! Turn it on!
[The Russell Crowe show.]
RUSSELL CROWE
Crikey! Ol' Tugger looks healthy, happy, and [does a catcall] fit as a whistle!
[Cartman's living room.]
KYLE
It's okay, it's still the show.
[The Russell Crowe show.]
RUSSELL CROWE
But you know, Tugger's attempted suicide made me realize that I should take up a cause. Most great actors take up causes, and I'm the greatest of 'em all! So, from now on I'm gonna spend all my spare time ...fighting cancer. [gets into a fighting stance] Right! Where is that pussy cancer anyway?!
[Cartman's living room. the gas is overwhelming them, and they look ready to pass out.]
KYLE
Oh, dude, I don't know how long I can take it.
STAN
Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house!
KYLE
Will your sister let us watch it?
STAN
She has to! [leads the boys out of Cartman's house]
[The neighborhood. The boys rush back to Stan's house.]
STAN
Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute!
BUTTERS
Aw! Oh man! Uh, uh uh uh...
CARTMAN
[trailing the other three] Oh my god, eugh! Oh God! Oh, Jesus help me! [stops] Oh! I lost a doughnut! [turns around and heads back] Oooh! Oh oh! [stops] Oh my God! [turns around and tries to catch up with the others] Leave no doughnut behind!
[Stan's house. The boys reach the front door.]
BUTTERS
Oh Jesus! Wait.
STAN
What?
BUTTERS
I never gave Shelly her tampons. She's been this whole time without them. [the boys are scared now. Slowly, Stan reaches up for the knob and turns it. The door flies open and a torrent of blood gushes through the door, flooding the boys back into the street.]
THE BOYS
AAAAAAAaaaaaaaahhhhh. [Kyle shakes the blood off, Stan looks up and then at the front door, Butters sits up. A trail of blood is left from the interior of the house to the street, and Shelly looks out from her window]
SHELLY
I told you I needed tampons, tuurrddsss!
KYLE
Look! Crack addicts with a television! [two men and a woman are shown watching a small TV on a box near some buildings. The boys walk up to them and watch the TV as well]
[The Russell Crowe show. Russell is in a hospital room with Tugger.]
RUSSELL CROWE
Well, we couldn't find cancer, but we found a man with cancer. [he walks off and pulls in an old frail man with cancer, then delivers a blow] Take that, cancer! And that! [punches the old man again]
TUGGER
Mooot Mooot! [Russell punches the old man behind the head and sends him to the floor]
STAN
The last commercial break has to be coming any second! [two phaser blasts are seen. One kills the bearded crack addict, another knocks a trash can over. Chef's TV appears and the two remaining addicts and the boys scream]
ALL
AAAAA! [quickly move away. Chef's TV delivers a double blast to the small TV and destroys it, then moves off to its left.]
CHEF
[still following the TV and talking to customer service] ...Yes, I pressed "menu" three times! [listens] No! It's givin' me the same error message! [listens] Yes I read the instruction manual!
[Luau's Toys, moments later. The boys run by.]
THE BOYS
[stopping] Where do we go?!
KYLE
Oh Jesus! Now where do we go??
STAN
We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house??
BUTTERS
I'm sure! There's no way!
KYLE
Well why not?!
BUTTERS
Uh because! Uh my parents are out of town, and I don't have a babysitter.
CARTMAN
[glares at Butters and slowly gets angry] Oh, God-dammit you better be kidding!
BUTTERS
No! I really don't have a babysitter. That's why I'm stayin' at Stan's.
KYLE
This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?!
STAN
Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later! [they run off]
[Butters' house, minutes later. The boys burst through the front door.]
THE BOYS
AAAAA!!
CARTMAN
The time has come! Turn it on, turn it on! [Stan is the first to reach the remote control, so he takes it and turn on the TV]
[The Russell Crowe show.]
RUSSELL CROWE
And so we'll be right back, after these commercials.
STAN
We made it! [grins]
KYLE
The last commercial break is starting!
ANNOUNCER
[the show logo appears] Don't go anywhere. Russell Crowe will be right back after a few more commercials. [the grins slowly fade to disappointment]
CARTMAN
These commercials are all so God-damn stupid!
STAN
Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be??
KYLE
What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing?
BUTTERS
They have to show it! They promised they would!
CARTMAN
You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest.
KYLE
That's bull-crap! TV shows are gay!
STAN
Wait a minute! Look! [points and reads from the TV] "The following preview has..." This is it! This is it!
[The Terrance & Phillip trailer.]
ANNOUNCER
[Terrance & Phillip stand back to back. The camera starts with their legs and pans up] Coming this summer! The greatest Canadian duo of all time is back.
[Action music plays as the following words come flying at the viewer from the TV screen: "THIS........ SUMMER........ TERRANCE........ AND........ PHILLIP........ WILL........ BLOW........ YOU........ AWAY........ AND....... WORDS...... WILL..... FLY.... AT... YOU.. VERY. FAST" The music stops and Terrance & Phillip appear dressed as cowboys. Terrance farts, Phillip laughs, then "ASSES OF FIRE" appears with flames behind the words, then a large "2" lands next to the E in FIRE. It is set to come out June 21, 2002. It is rated R. It ends, and the boys take time to absorb it all.]
CARTMAN
[tosses his popcorn into the air] Woohoo!!! [the popcorn showers all the boys as they begin to move around happily]
STAN, KYLE, BUTTERS
Yeeeeesss! [begins dancing]
STAN
That looks AWEsome! [Cartman goes to the phone and starting dialing a number]
KYLE
They were wearing cowboy hats! [to Stan] Did you see?? [to Butters] Did you see?? [Butters stops dancing]
CARTMAN
[on the phone] Clyde, Clyde? Did you see it? [Stan jumps up on the sofa alongside Cartman] Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too.
BUTTERS
Oh, I'm so glad we didn't miss it! [picks up some popcorn and toses it up into the air]
CARTMAN
You guys, Clyde said he taped it and kids can come over now to see.
STAN
Oh, dude, let's go!
BUTTERS
Yeah. [the kids head for the front door]
KYLE
It looks even better than their first movie, huh?
CARTMAN
Yeah, it sure does!
STAN
I wonder if it's all a western?
BUTTERS
How far away is June?
[The Russell Crowe show, sunset. The sun is about to drop over the horizon behind Russell and Tugger.]
RUSSELL CROWE
Well, we sure had a good time today, didn't we, kids? We fought some Chinamen, a few peckers, and a lot of Colombians, to name just a few. But I sure am glad we got ol' Wally B. back. Aren't you? [a wallaby hops into view]
WALLY B.
I'm glad to be back, Russey! [a woman and girl walk by, but stop and look]
A GIRL
Oh my God, it's Russell Crowe!
RUSSELL CROWE
[in the condescending falsetto] Oh my God it's Russell Crowe! Oh my bluh blah bluh!! [gets into his fighting stance] Why don't you go flush yourself down a toilet, you cu- [the girl's mother picks her up and hurries away]
TUGGER
Mooo-oooo.
RUSSELL CROWE
[puts his hand to his ear and gasps] Uh-oh, Tugger's whistle. You know what that means!
[the wallaby hops to the boat as Russell backs away from the camera. He begins to sing as Wally B. turns around...]
Tugger's whistle's blowin'
Means we must be goin'
No more Russell Crowein' for you.
[does some boxing moves and then hops into the boat]
But now don't you start to whine
I'll see ya again next time.
'Cause there's plenty a-more a-fightin' left to do.
[Wally B. hops closer, and finally into Russell's arms. Next shot, a departing Tugger, headed for the sunset. Russell appears and sings the signature line, slowing with every word]
Makin' movies, makin' songs, an' fightin' round the world.
See you next time, everybody!
[waves to the camera]
[South Park, night. Chef's TV is still walking around, but this time away from town. It's showing the Russell Crowe show. Chef is still trying to shut it down.]
CHEF
So I'm supposed to press "menu," then "function," then "enter."
End of The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Stan is appalled when he realizes the veal he's been eating is, in fact, the meat from little baby calves.

script:Fun with Veal

[A ranch, day. A rancher stands next to his cow corral as the South Park Elementary bus drives up. The bus stops and Ms. Choksondik steps off.]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Okay children, step off the bus and form a group next to the nice redneck - I mean, rancher.
RANCHER
Hello, boys and girls. My name is Rancher Bob.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Let's all say hello to Rancher Bob.
KIDS
Hi, Rancher Bob.
RANCHER BOB
I'm pleased to show you all the wonderful world of beef. Follow me.
KYLE
[to Stan] City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms.
RANCHER BOB
Now, out here you can see our cattle. This is where the magic begins as the cows eat and sleep and prepare for certain death. [a shot of the cows looking back at the class.]
CARTMAN
They look so delicious. [Kyle looks at him]
RANCHER BOB
[leading the class down a line of cows] Now here we have the slaughterhouse. This is where we turn the cows into steaks and burgers. [a cow moos and a guillotine comes down, chopping its head off.]
KIDS
Eewwww!!
KYLE
Aw, dude. [Two workers come and carry the cow's body away, leaving the head behind. Rancher Bob reaches down for a skinned leg and holds it up]
RANCHER BOB
Hey, anybody want a free sample?
CARTMAN
[raises his arm up with glee] Memememee!
RANCHER BOB
[now standing next to a darkened doorway] And in here, boys and girls, we have our... [flips on a switch, illuminating the room beyond.] veal ranch. [the class looks at the baby calves in the room. A closeup changes the music from spritely to somber. A shot of the class, with some kids showing some dread. Bob walks over to a calf and kneels by it] You see, with veal the whole key is keepin' the cows chained so they can't walk around or get any exercise. That way, their muscle tissue stays soft, and makes for tender veal.
STAN
Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??
RANCHER BOB
Yeppir.
KYLE
Then why the hell do they call it "veal"??
RANCHER BOB
Well, if we called it "little baby cow" people might not eat it.
STAN
Yeah, I wouldn't have.
BUTTERS
Huh, me neither.
CARTMAN
Oh, man, look at that one! [moves towards the calves] It looks delicious.
KYLE
What??
CARTMAN
Mm, succulent and juicy. [reaches the calf he was eyeing] Can we have a free sample of these, too?
RANCHER BOB
Well, no, but all these veals are goin' to the slaughterhouse tomorrow mornin'. They'll be steaks by tomorrow afternoon and then you can buy them at your grocery store.
CARTMAN
Alriiight!
STAN
Tomorrow morning? [a shot of the calves has Stan, Kyle, and Butters transfixed. The rest of the class leaves] Dude, we gotta help them.
KYLE
Yeah.
[Cartman's house, night. A light is on in the living room. Cartman is asleep in his bed. Butters, Stan and Kyle climb up to his window.]
STAN
[knocks twice on the wall below the window] Pst, Cartman.
CARTMAN
[responding to a dream] No, Uncle Jesse, no!
STAN
[knocks twice while saying] Cartman, wake up!
CARTMAN
[wakes up and sees his friends] What? What the hell are you guys doing??
KYLE
[opening the window] Come on, we've gotta go!
CARTMAN
Where are we going?
STAN
We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!
CARTMAN
What? Why?
KYLE
'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole!
CARTMAN
So?
STAN
So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!
CARTMAN
Well, lessee, in the last three point two seconds you've called me "fatass", "butthole", and "douchebag". I really don't feel like you guys's friend. [lies back down and closes his eyes]
STAN
We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together.
BUTTERS
Uh-wait. I thought... yoyou said we needed him because he has the "Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering Playset."
STAN
[heaves softly] Damnit Butters, will you shut up?!
CARTMAN
[sits up] Oho! So you need me and my Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering Playset!
STAN
[plainly] Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us?
CARTMAN
Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass. [turns his ass to Kyle, lowers his pants and underwear, and waits]
KYLE
What?!
CARTMAN
Just give it a little kiss and I'll help.
KYLE
Screw you, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss. [softly] Kiss it.
STAN
Go on, dude it's the only way.
KYLE
No!
CARTMAN
Kiss it. Come on. [gruffly] Kiss it.
STAN
Just do it really fast, and we can go.
KYLE
Have Butters kiss it.
CARTMAN
No, it has to be Kyle. [turns away. Kyle resists for a few moments, then slowly moves his face towards Cartman's ass through the window. Kyle finally reaches the ass and Cartman unleashes a juicy fart. Kyle withdraws in fits and starts]
KYLE
Awww! [wipes off his face and then waves away the smell]
CARTMAN
[laughs uproariously] Oh man, that was soho awesome!
KYLE
Sick! I felt it on my face!
STAN
Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on!
CARTMAN
Hell, I'm not goin' with you! [lies back down and closes his eyes again]
KYLE
[taken aback] HYAAAAA! [loses his temper via short temper lunges at Cartman and starts hitting him angrily]
CARTMAN
Heeeey! [rolls off the bed and the wrestling continues]
[Rancher Bob's ranch, night. The boys are walking on the roof of the veal ranch. They stop, and Stan opens the playset to put on the costume and harness.]
BUTTERS
Oh I don't know about this, fellas. It says right here on the Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset: "Not for actual breaking and entering. B-breaking and entering is a cr-riime."
STAN
Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too! [holds up parts of a torch] How does this thing work, Cartman?
CARTMAN
[heaves and takes the torch from Stan] Jesus, don't you guys have any toys? First you put on the black ski mask [hands it to Stan] and use the torch to cut a hole in the roof. [opens the gas valve and lights the gas stream. A blue flame shoots out and the other boys jump back.]
[The hole is created, and Stan, now dressed in black and in harness, is lowered into the ranch. He stops just short of the ground.]
STAN
[softly into his headset] Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta.
CARTMAN
[peers down. Butters and Kyle join him] You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset.
STAN
[looks up and calls out] I said that's far enough! [the harness drops to the floor. He gets up and unlocks himself out of the harness, and it goes back up. A calf looks back at him innocently. Stan moves up behind the calf, the softly] Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose. [removes the chain] There you go. You're free. Run away! [the calf doesn't move, and Stan gestures] Go! They're gonna murder you.
CARTMAN
Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off.
KYLE
You need to freeze some of your ass off.
CARTMAN
O! At least I have an ass, Jew!
KYLE
What? [below, Stan removes the chains from the remaining calves]
STAN
Come on, you stupid baby cows! [walks towards the door and lifts up the security bar, then opens the door] You have to get out of here. [they just lift their heads and look at the entrance. The other boys join Stan inside the veal ranch]
BUTTERS
Huuh what's the matter?
STAN
They aren't leaving.
CARTMAN
See? Maybe they want to become sweet juicy veal steaks.
KYLE
Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how.
STAN
Oh yeah, they're too weak to move. [a shot of the calves again] Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back.
BUTTERS
No no no no no! I can't bring cows into my house. I'll get grounded.
STAN
Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house.
KYLE
Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house?
STAN
I don't know.
CARTMAN
I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood.
KYLE
Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him!
BUTTERS
Eh yeah I do too!
STAN
[moves towards the calves] We're just gonna have to carry them one by one. [lifts up his first calf] Come on, you guys. [Kyle and Butters look at each other, then move to join Stan]
CARTMAN
Eh! [follows]
[The boys are shown walking down an icy road, each carrying a calf... except... one calf is sliding across the ice, then stops. Cartman appears to follow it, but he approaches it and stands next to it.]
CARTMAN
Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling. [pushes the calf further across the ice]
[Stan's house, day. The boys and the calves are in Stan's room. Three of the boys are there with the calves.]
CARTMAN
Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer.
STAN
We won't have to. Butters said he had something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.
KYLE
Butters had that at his house?
BUTTERS
[enters carrying a box] Hey fellas!
STAN
Butters! [Butters turns] Did you bring it?
BUTTERS
I sure did. We'll have those poor baby cows in shape in no time!
KYLE
All right!
BUTTERS
[reads the box] "Susanne Sommers' Calf Exerciser."
STAN
What?
BUTTERS
"Makes your calves stronger in just - two days!"
KYLE
Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan?
BUTTERS
Eh, you think it's a gimmick? Susanne promises right on the box that it works.
[Stan's house, front door, moments later. Rancher Bob and Officer Barbrady are at the front door. Barbrady knocks. Sharon opens the door and Rancher Bob tips his hat to her.]
OFFICER BARBRADY
Hello, Mrs. Marsh.
SHARON
Officer Barbrady. What can I do for you?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, we've got a little problem. Gent here caught your boy and his friends trespassing on his ranch. They stole some of his property.
SHARON
Stole? A-a-are you sure? [Randy and Shelly appear next to her]
RANCHER BOB
I followed a calf-curling trail right to your house, ma'am.
SHELLY
Ooo, Stan's in trouble. Let me kick his ass, Mom.
SHARON
Not now - my son is not a thief. I'm sure this is just some kind of a misunderstanding. [she leads the others upstairs to Stan's room.] Stanley, did you see-? [she's stunned at what she sees]
STAN
Aw crap!
SHARON
Stanley, what are you doing with those calves?
STAN
[points an accusing finger at Rancher Bob and approaches] That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people!
RANDY
Stanley, they belong to him.
STAN
They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die.
SHELLY
[smacks her fist] Let me hit him, Mom!
SHARON
Stanley, this isn't up for discussion. The rancher is gonna take his cows back and [points at him] you don't have a choice! [Stan looks dejected, then defiant. He closes his door and locks himself in with Cartman, Butters and Kyle. Sharon then pounds on the door and tries to open it] Stanley! Stanley, you open this door right now or you're gonna get it!
STAN
No!
RANDY
Stan, you're behaving like a kid!
STAN
You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the ones who knew we were making little baby animals suffer! [walks off to his right]
SHARON
Open this door, now!
STAN
[pushing his dresser into place against the door] Kiss my ass!
BUTTERS
Oh Jeez, he said "ass" to his parents.
KYLE
You're getting in pretty deep, dude. [Stan glares back with a look of determination]
[Stan's house, living room. The adults have gone back downstairs.]
SHARON
I apologize for this, Mr. Rancher Person.
RANCHER BOB
Oh, why, why don't you just tell them that the cows will be safe? And when they come out I can take them back.
SHARON
I can't lie to my son, okay? If I betrayed him like that, I'd pay for it the rest of my life.
RANCHER BOB
Well that's just too bad. Look it, that's eight hundred dollars' worth of veal up there and I have to ship it out Friday. [nudges Barbrady on the shoulder] What are you goin' to do, Officer Barbrady?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Me?? How did I get into this mess?
[Stan's room. Stan paces the floor.]
KYLE
So what happens now?
STAN
I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing.
KYLE
We're with you, dude.
BUTTERS
Yeah.
STAN
[serious] Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.
CARTMAN
I want out.
STAN
[glares] Shut up, Cartman.
KYLE
We're with you, Stan.
BUTTERS
Hey y-yeah. W-w-we can't let those little baby cows down. Why, they've got no one else to turn to.
STAN
Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.
KYLE, BUTTERS
Yeah!
CARTMAN
Yeah! Wait-what?
[Stan's house, living room, night. Kyle's parents and Butters' parents have joined the other adults.]
SHARON
And so that's the situation. Our boys have locked themselves in Stan's room until we can promise them the calves will live free, in writing.
SHEILA
Well, this is ridiculous! I don't know how you raise your kids, but my son does not play negotiator with me!
SHARON
Well excuse me, Sheila, but it wasn't that simple!
SHEILA
HA! Give me fifteen seconds with Kyle and I'll have that door open! [the adults leave the living room and go up the stairs, stopping at Stan's door] Kyle?! [pounds on the door] This is your mother! You will open this door right now!
KYLE
[pause] ...No I won't.
SHARON
[gets to retort] Yes, I see what you mean, Sheila. [Sheila looks at her] That was very impressive.
SHEILA
[turns back to the door] Kyle, if you don't do as you're told, I'm going to be very angry!
KYLE
Well you made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch!
SHARON
[folds her arms] Very persuasive.
SHEILA
[starts pounding away furiously at the door] AAAAA! Open this door!! Open this door!!
STEPHEN
[calms Sheila down and takes over] Whoa-ho-ho, let, let me try. [faces the door] Butters? [slight zoom-in on Butters] Butters, this is your father.
BUTTERS
[to the boys] Oh, sweet Jesus. Uh, what do I do?
STAN
Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this.
STEPHEN
Butters? Answer me!
BUTTERS
[to the boys] But they-ah they're angry at me.
KYLE
Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say. [begins to whisper in Butters' ear] You can tell them...
STEPHEN
Butters! Right now!
BUTTERS
Dad, uh, why don't you suck my fat one?
STEPHEN
WHAT?!
BUTTERS
Oh, sweet Jesus.
STEPHEN
[turns to the other adults] What's gotten into them?
SHARON
Alright, Stanley, this has gone on long enough! Your little game is over!
STAN
This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until we know the calves will be safe.
SHARON
Well that's fine! You boys can just stay in there and starve to death. Us parents are going to go to Pizza Shack and have pepperoni pizzas and ice cream.
CARTMAN
[weakening] Oh, God-damnit you guys.
KYLE
Cartman, stay away from that door!
SHARON
You'll have to come out sooner or later, boys. The longer you wait, the more trouble you'll be in. [the adults walk away, but Sheila stops and turns back to the door.]
SHEILA
[pounds on the door once more] Mmmrragh!!
STAN
[sighs] Round one is over. We made it. [the boys gather in]
CARTMAN
We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?!
STAN
Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in.
KYLE
But we will have to sleep, dude.
STAN
Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.
BUTTERS
[finding a way to relate] Hehey! This is gonna be just like Vietnam, huh fellas! Whoopie!
STAN
We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes! [one calf takes a dump on the carpet, another walks up and takes a piss on it]
[Stan's house, living room, after dinner. The women wait at the sofa while the men try to remove the door with tools. Liane is now present as Sheila crosses her arms and pats her left shoulder with her right hand. Moments later, the men come down the stairs.]
RANDY
Well we tried everything. We can't get through the door without tearing apart the house.
SHEILA
Dear God, it's been over thirteen hours!
LIANE
Oh, but my poor little poopsie must be getting so hungry. Maybe we should get them a little food.
SHARON
Ms. Cartman, this is a battle of wills. We need our boys to know that we're not gonna cave in, at all.
LIANE
Oh, all right.
SHEILA
Let's all just go to bed and let them play their little game for as long as they can.
[Stan's room, night. From outside, his room is the only one lit. Inside, Cartman, Kyle and Butters are in his bed while Stan sits at his desk.]
BUTTERS
Good night, fellas!
KYLE
Good night.
BUTTERS
[to the calves] Good night, Patches. Good night, Halloway. Good night, Neptune. Good night, Davis. Good night, Bud. Good night, Red. Good night, Paulette. Good night, Chastity.
CARTMAN
Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again.
[Stan's room, fade to day. Hour 29. The boys are all drowsy and a little disheveled. Stan sits on his bed stroking a calf, Butters sits on the floor, Cartman rests against a calf, Kyle holds his stomach.]
CARTMAN
Can't go on. Need... food...
KYLE
We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.
CARTMAN
There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf.
STAN
No, Cartman, we're not eating a calf!
CARTMAN
All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters. [points]
KYLE
[looks back at Stan] He might be right, dude.
BUTTERS
Aw, heck. [a basket floats up to the window on a pole]
STAN
Wait, what is that? [points to the basket. The other three boys turn. Cartman approaches the window and takes the basket] Dude!
CARTMAN
Food!
[Stan's house, outside. Liane lowers her pole as Sharon and Sheila go outside to see what's going on.]
SHARON
Ms. Cartman, what are you doing?
LIANE
Oh, I just can't stand to see my baby suffer.
SHEILA
Oh dear God, you've ruined everything.
[Stan's room, moments later. The boys take shares of food out of the basket. Stan walks away with two apples.]
KYLE
All right!
STAN
See? Now we can hold out for weeks!
CARTMAN
Look you guys! Beef jerky!
KYLE
Yeah! And fried chicken! [Stan sits at a corner with his apples.]
STAN
[sensing a lapse] Wha? [rises and walks to his bed, where the other boys sit eating]
KYLE, CARTMAN
Mmmmm.
STAN
Dude, what are you guys doing?
KYLE
We're eating, dude.
STAN
You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!
KYLE
Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.
BUTTERS
Me neither.
CARTMAN
Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy.
STAN
[returns to his corner] That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again!
CARTMAN
Go ahead, that's more for us. [tempts the calf next to him with some beef jerky] You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry? [the calf starts chewing on it] Who's the hungry man?
KYLE
[looks over] Dude, that's messed up. [Stan looks as well, but goes back to his apples]
[Stan's house, night, Hour 34. Police and fire departments and an ambulance are at the house, with a kleig light shining into Stan's room from the fire truck. Inside, Stan sits on the floor still eating his apples, Cartman stands next to the chair, Butters sits on the bed. The sound of breaking news is heard.]
KYLE
You guys, check this out! [a TV now sits where the football normally is, and the picture shown is that of Stan's house. The other boys join Kyle in looking at the news report from News 4]
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing in front of the house where four insane boy terrorists have barricaded themselves inside a room with twenty-three live infant cattle.
BUTTERS
Hey, look. Some other kids are doin' the same thing we are. [Cartman looks at him, then slaps him hard across the face to shut him up] Eugh!
FIELD REPORTER
Several attempts to break into the room have proven unsuccessful, Tom, and the crisis is intensifying. Here's what some people have to say.
THOMAS
[with wife and son] We were sleeping when suddenly we heard all the commotion. I mean, to think this could happen right here in our own community. [Craig shows his right middle finger to the camera. Next, the boys' parents are shown]
RANDY
We gave those kids everything, and they turned into little... John Walkers!
FIELD REPORTER
The police chief of South Park says that there will be no negotiations with terrorists.
BUTTERS
Oh no. Eh this is big-time trouble now, fellas.
STAN
No, this is exactly what we wanted.
KYLE
It is?
STAN
Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people.
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, it looks like I have an update: Yes, it looks like the boy terrorist story is not interesting news to anyone. Uh, nothing else was going on, Tom, so this was the only story we had to make seem important, but people are just simply tuning out. So, HBC will now be switching programming once again to "Puppies from Around the World."
[The news break switches to a series of dog scenes. First, dalmatians run across a field to the tune of bagpipes, then a small dog looks around to the tune of Chinese music, then a puppy in a basket as a mariachi band is heard, then another dog is shown to African chanting, then another to flute music, then a puppy is shown following a tennis ball, then another dog plays with the camera as more mariachi music is heard.]
STAN
[the boys are stunned] ...I don't believe it.
BUTTERS
Ehuh, the Chinese puppy's... my favorite so far.
[Stan's house, fade to day. Hour 53. Stan and Butters are sleeping, and Butters, sleeping face down, has his left arm across Stan's chest. Stan stirs and opens his eyes.]
STAN
[notices the situation] Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me! [Butters stirs and turns around]
BUTTERS
[waking up as well] Oh, sorry. I thought you were Mr. Pickles. [voices are heard outside and the boys sit up, then move towards the window]
VOICES
We must help the helpless, we must save the unsaved
KYLE
Huh, what the hell is that?
HIPPIES
If we... fight together we can make sure the road is paved.
For a... brighter tomorrow...
CARTMAN
Hippies!
STAN
What are they doing here?
HIPPIE
[on bullhorn] We're with you boys! Your message is real and your fight is just. [the other hippes start cheering]
HIPPIES
Hooray! Hooray!
KYLE
Dude! Those gaywads are on our side?
BUTTERS
Ewww, they're all dirty.
CARTMAN
What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!
[Stan's house, night, Hour 75. Police and fire departments and an ambulance have returned. HBC News is there again with its field reporter.]
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, the calf terrorist standoff continues as now members of the FBI arrive to put an end to the conflict. [FBI vehicles speed in and FBI agents pour out of the vehicles]
SHARON
[not believing what she sees] Oh Jesus Christ. [slaps her hand to her forehead]
FBI AGENT
Who's in charge here?
OFFICER BARBRADY
I am. But I don't want to be.
FBI AGENT
Where's the negotiator?
FBI NEGOTIATOR
Right here! Glen Dumont, Negotiator Squad.
FBI AGENT
All right, see what you can do.
[Stan's room. Stan is petting a calf. Kyle looks on. Stan coughs and sniffs.]
KYLE
Dude, are you okay?
STAN
Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores. [lifts up his shirt to show the sores to the others]
BUTTERS
What is that?
KYLE
Dude, maybe we should end this.
STAN
No!
[Stan's house, outside. The negotiator walks up to the negotiation van, which has all the equipment he needs to handle a negotiation.]
GLEN DUMONT
Give me a hard line to the phone in that house! [a squad member gets on it]
OFFICER BARBRADY
The terrorists already said there's no way they're coming out.
GLEN DUMONT
[receives the phone] Don't worry, I'm a negotiator. It's my job to talk to freaks like this and bring about a peaceful resolution using clever psychology.
[Stan's room. The phone rings and Stan goes to answer it.]
STAN
Hello?
GLEN DUMONT
Hello, my name is Mike. I'm a negotiator. Is it okay if I talk to you?
STAN
Ah, hold on. [turns to the other boys] It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do?
KYLE
Don't give him anything!
STAN
What do I say??
CARTMAN
[walks up to Stan and takes over] Dah, give me that! [takes the receiver from Stan] Talk to me Mike.
GLEN DUMONT
I'm here to make sure we can all end this peacefully. You want that, right?
CARTMAN
Sure, sure.
GLEN DUMONT
How about we make a trade, just show that we can trust each other.
CARTMAN
What do you have in mind?
GLEN DUMONT
Well, how about you send out one of the calves?
CARTMAN
Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike.
GLEN DUMONT
Just one, that's all we want.
CARTMAN
All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -
STAN
Cartman, no!
KYLE
Dude! [Cartman holds out his palm to silence them]
CARTMAN
[clears his throat] We'll give you one calf, if you give us... some guns and ammunition of our own.
GLEN DUMONT
What? I, I can't do that.
CARTMAN
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye.
GLEN DUMONT
No no wait, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Yuh, you're right. What reason do you have to trust me? I'm just a guy from Lakewood trying to make ends meet, you know? Just a blue-collar guy like your dad.
CARTMAN
Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work.
GLEN DUMONT
[trumped] Oh. All right, fine, son of a gun, let me see what I can do.
[Stan's house, night, Hour 154. The authorities are still there, waiting out the standoff.]
GLEN DUMONT
Okay. Up a little... left a little... [a crane lifts a box of ammunition towards Stan's window. Kyle and Butters wait for it] Almost there.
RANDY
[arrives with Sharon] What is that?
GLEN DUMONT
We're giving the boys some guns in return for a calf.
RANDY
What?
SHARON
You're giving my baby guns?
GLEN DUMONT
[snaps back] Hey, this is a negotiation process, okay? Did you people go to negotiator school? No, you didn't! [walks off in a huff to the negotiation van] Get them on the line for me!
CARTMAN
[answers the ringing phone] Hello.
GLEN DUMONT
Alright, you see that? I keep my end of the bargain.
CARTMAN
All right, we'll keep ours. We'll send out one calf. [in the background, Kyle takes out the guns, tossing them to Butters]
GLEN DUMONT
Well, ha- how about you send out two calves?
CARTMAN
Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?! [Butters assembles a machine gun while Kyle inspects a sword. Stan lies by a corner in a fetal position, on a calf, with more lesions appearing on his face]
STAN
O-ogh...
CARTMAN
We had a deal! Do you think I'm stupid?! Don't treat me like I'm stupid here! [Butters plays soldier in the background, moving his gun around and then saluting while Kyle practices some lunges]
GLEN DUMONT
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [to fellow agents as he holds his hand over the mouthpiece] Damnit, I'm losing them. [to Cartman] Okay, I'm sorry. Just send out one calf.
CARTMAN
Oh nonono, now you're gonna have to get us something else! [Kyle tosses a dud grenade at Butters, who hits it with a spear. The grenade flies off the bed and onto the floor. Kyle and Butters jump with joy]
GLEN DUMONT
What do you have in mind?
[Stan's house, day. Hour 169. This makes one week and an hour since the standoff began.]
GLEN DUMONT
A little to the left... [this time the crane is lifting a missile] Okay, that's good. A little to the right. [Butters and Kyle wait by the window again]
SHEILA
You're giving them a missile??
GLEN DUMONT
[losing patience] Stand down, ma'am! Stand down! This is a delicate process! I've almost earned their trust!
[Stan's room.]
KYLE
[dabbing Stan's sores with a moist towel] Stan's getting worse, you guys.
CARTMAN
Mike, speak.
GLEN DUMONT
How are we doin'?
CARTMAN
We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us?
GLEN DUMONT
Weh ah I did manage to get the FDA to officially change the word "veal" to "tortured baby cow." [holds up an FDA document]
CARTMAN
Good, good.
GLEN DUMONT
But I couldn't get you North and South Dakota.
CARTMAN
Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike.
GLEN DUMONT
Now, now please can, can we get you to come out? [Cartman looks over at Stan, who looks sicker by the minute]
[Outside Stan's house, night.]
GLEN DUMONT
All right, everythng has worked out. The boys have promised to come out and bring the cows out with them.
ADULTS
Yes! All right! Woohoo!
OFFICER BARBRADY
Whoops, sorry I doubted your abilities, Mr. Negotiator.
FBI AGENT
They're coming out now?
GLEN DUMONT
Yes. All we need to do in return is get a cattle-transporting semi-truck that will take the boys and the cattle to Denver International Airport, where we have a fully-gassed airplane waiting to take them all to Mexico.
SHARON
What??
GLEN DUMONT
And they want the guy that plays Mr. Worf on "Star Trek" to drive the truck. [beat] In full makeup.
RANDY
Jesus Christ!
FBI AGENT
All right, that does it! You are in fact the worst negotiator I've ever seen in action!
GLEN DUMONT
All right, all right, I'll give you that. But in return, I want three staples.
FBI AGENT
Get out of here! [Dumont bolts. The agent talks to Barbrady] We'll get them the semi, and we'll get them the Worf guy. If they see that, they'll come out and then, we could take them.
OFFICER BARBRADY
But isn't that dishonest?
FBI AGENT
Maybe so, but if we don't do something soon, there could be fifty, even sixty people who'll have to go without veal for dinner. Are you prepared to let that happen?
[Outside Stan's house, night. Hour 201, just after sunset. The semi-truck Cartman ordered arrives.]
FBI AGENT
All right. Where is Mr. Dorn?
MICHAEL DORN
[aka Worf, arrives in full makeup] I was woken up at three in the morning, told I had to put on makeup, and come to this town. [folds his arms] What the hell is going on?!
FBI AGENT
I'm sorry, Mr. Dorn. It's FBI business. We've got terrorists making demands and we need your help.
MICHAEL DORN
This is highly unusual!
FBI AGENT
[on the bullhorn] All right boys, we have your truck. And we have an airplane on the tarmac at Denver International.
CARTMAN
And Worf?
MICHAEL DORN
My name is Michael Dorn. I play a character called Worf.
KYLE
[rushes to Stan] Stan! It worked!
STAN
[looking very weak and with a few more sores on his body] It... did?
KYLE
They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay!
STAN
Pick me up. I... I want to see. [Kyle picks him up]
[Outside Stan's house, night. The authorities prepare for the kids' surrender. The front door opens and Cartman looks out. The FBI agents take aim.]
CARTMAN
Step back! Tell those men to step back!
FBI AGENT
Do it!
FBI AGENTS
[lowering their weapons and stepping back] Mmrrrr.
HIPPIES
All right! Woohoo! Yeah!
CARTMAN
[heads for the street] Aw, shut up, you freakin' hippies! [approaches the semi-truck, where Michael Dorn now sits at the wheel. He gets into the passenger side and sits] Alright, Mr. Worf, start the engine and put her in gear. Oh, and you must refer to me as "Captain."
MICHAEL DORN
Where am I supposed to drive to?
CARTMAN
No. See, you must say, "Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?"
MICHAEL DORN
Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?
CARTMAN
You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves.
MICHAEL DORN
This whole thing is ridiculous!
CARTMAN
[correcting Dorn] "Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous!"
MICHAEL DORN
[beat, then in a low voice] Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous. [starts up the engine]
CARTMAN
[calls out] Okay, all set!
[An overhead view of the scene shows a News 4 helicopter covering the story — from the camera of another News 4 helicopter.]
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, it looks as though the terrorists are now loading the baby cows into the back of a semi. This is still very uninteresting news, Tom.
[Ground view, inside the trailer.]
BUTTERS
Okay Cartman!
[Ground view, on the street.]
CARTMAN
Step on it, Mr. Worf! [the semi peels off]
BOYS
All right!
[Inside the trailer.]
BUTTERS
We're going! [Kyle grins]
KYLE
Mexico here we come! [Dorn honks to clear everyone out of the way.]
[In the cab. Police cars follow the semi.]
CARTMAN
Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!
MICHAEL DORN
We cannot keep going fast on these icy roads!
CARTMAN
[correcting gently] "Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?"
MICHAEL DORN
Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads.
CARTMAN
Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.
[Inside the trailer. Stan casts his eyes down at the floor.]
KYLE
Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on.
[On the street. The semi passes by Rancher Bob's ranch.]
FBI AGENT
Alright, they're in front of the cattle ranch. Hit it! [another agent presses a button and a buzzer is heard. A few seconds later balloons fill up under the semi and lift it off the ground. The whole thing comes to a stop]
CARTMAN
[looks out] Oh, it's a double-cross!!
FBI AGENT
[approaches with his fellow agents] Alright, boys! The game is over! Get out of the truck with your hands up!
[In the trailer.]
KYLE
Oh no! No!!
[In the cab.]
CARTMAN
What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf!
MICHAEL DORN
I'm NOT killing anybody!
CARTMAN
Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are!
[Rancher Bob's Cattle Ranch, moments later. The FBI agents take the calves into the veal ranch as the boys stand next to the semi. Michael Dorn is there as well.]
STAN
We're sorry, cows. We tried. We tried!
FBI AGENT
[On the bullhorn] Alright boys, just stay right there until your parents arrive.
MICHAEL DORN
Can I go now?
OFFICER BARBRADY
Here you go, Mr. Rancher. I got your cattle back for you.
RANCHER BOB
Oh. [glances at the stack of veal forming next to him] Well, it doesn't matter now.
OFFICER BARBRADY
What do you mean?
RANCHER BOB
In the twenty-four hours since the word "veal" was officially changed to "little tortured baby cow" the market has gone dry. Seems that people see "little tortured baby cow" on their menus, they don't feel like orderin'.
BUTTERS
Really?
RANCHER BOB
Yep, damn things ain't worth spit now. I'll let 'em live outside with the other cows and live a normal life.
KYLE
Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry! [Stan doesn't respond. He's passed out] Stan? Stan?? [Butters appears next to them]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, next day. The boys and their families are present at Stan's hospital bed. Stan is half-awake now, hooked up to IVs and all.]
DR. DOCTOR
He's very lucky you got him here when you did. He was in a very advanced state of vaginitis.
RANDY
Vaginitis?
DR. DOCTOR
It occurs when a person stops eating meat. Those sores on his skin were actually small vaginas. If we hadn't stopped it in time, Stan would have eventually just become one great big giant pussy.
KYLE
Whoa, dude.
DR. DOCTOR
We've got an IV of pure beef blood pumping into Stan's veins and the... sores are fading.
CARTMAN
Thank God we stopped it in time.
STAN
Well, I guess we learned something today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas.
BUTTERS
Hear hear.
SHEILA
All right boys, it's time to go home. You've got some serious grounding time to start.
STEPHEN
I'll say!
BUTTERS
Aw, we're still grounded?
KYLE
But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause.
GERALD
Yes Kyle, but you still defied your parents. And you need to learn that terrorism is never the answer.
STEPHEN
That's right, let's get these terrorists to their rooms. [Sternly] But first, [softens] maybe we can grab some burgers.
THE BOYS
All right!
End of Fun with Veal


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The boys fire Butters as their new friend. Devastation over his rejection unleashes Butters' dark side and Professor Chaos is born.

script:Professor Chaos

[Cartman's room, day. Cartman and Kyle stand inside watching Stan, who is peeking out the door, waiting for someone.]
STAN
[turns to the boys] Okay, here he comes. [join Cartman and Kyle]
KYLE
Who wants to tell him?
CARTMAN
I'll do it.
BUTTERS
[joining the three] Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go.
CARTMAN
Butters, could you take a seat, please?
BUTTERS
Wuh well, sure. [They all go before Cartman's desk. Cartman takes a seat behind the desk. Stan helps Butters to his seat, then takes a place at Cartman's right side Kyle is on Cartman's left.]
CARTMAN
Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation.
BUTTERS
Wull what is it?
CARTMAN
Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and "filled the gap," so to speak. [wiggles the index and middle fingers of each hand as a quote gesture]
BUTTERS
Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend.
CARTMAN
Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out.
BUTTERS
Not working out?
CARTMAN
I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo...
KYLE
Lame.
CARTMAN
Lame, yes.
BUTTERS
Well, but ah I can get better.
STAN
Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you look for friendship opportunities elsewhere.
KYLE
But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were.
BUTTERS
Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together.
CARTMAN
Yes, well, we weren't.
BUTTERS
Please, fellas, uh don't fire me.
KYLE
We're sorry, Butters. [Cartman leaves his chair and approaches Butters] Our mind is made up.
CARTMAN
[shakes Butters' left hand] But we certainly wanna thank you for coming by. [points to the door] You know the way out, right? [Butters look at the other two boys, who each returns a somber look. He gets off the chair, looks once more, then walks away dejectedly]
KYLE
Phew.
STAN, CARTMAN
Phew.
KYLE
Hm, he took that pretty well, I think.
CARTMAN
Who cares?
STAN
All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place.
[Butters' house, night. A thunderstorm hovers over the neighborhood. Inside Butters' room a hamster set is seen, and beyond, Butters standing on his bed, looking out his window. He has an angry expression on his face.]
BUTTERS
[angrily] The world isn't fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them. [turns around and sits on his bed, wistfully] And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others. [the shadow on the wall turns into that of an old humpbacked man] Fine! [hops off the bed determined to do something about it] If I am to be an outcast, so be it! [walks towards the camera] I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it! [moves to his left] From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me! [an image of a nuclear blast going off as people run from it] I will become the greatest supervillain [people run as danger comes from the sky] the world has ever seen! [a tsunami takes over a harbor town as a woman and baby flee it] Where I go, destruction will follow! [exults at his new destiny, raising arms and face towards heaven as lightning strikes. A shot of the exterior with more lightning]
[Butters goes about making a suit for himself. He begins with a sheet of aluminum foil and shapes it around a styrofoam head to make a helmet. He pulls out a shirt from the closet and makes it a cape using a sewing machine. Pretty soon, he's finished - he's dressed as something of a knight.]
BUTTERS
Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos! [grins devilishly]
LINDA
[knocking on Butters' door] Butters, time for bed.
BUTTERS
Hu-uh, okay Mom. [waits a few moments, then gets that devilish look again.] Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now. [turns and faces the camera out side once more] Tomorrow, the chaos begins. [begins to laugh softly, then harder, than more maniacally, then in full maniacal laughter]
[South Park, morning. A small stage is shown in Cartman's backyard, with a camera off to the side. Kyle, Stan, and Cartman walk up on stage and look out over the backyard.]
CARTMAN
[takes the mic] All right, we wanna thank everybody for coming. This is a great turnout. [camera pans across the seated kids, then back to Cartman] Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you've all been selected as possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we've found the perfect friend. Are there any questions?
CLYDE
[after a moment of silence] ...What if we don't want to be your friend?
CARTMAN
Clyde... [mouths something]... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee.
[South Park, later. The camera looks at the end of Main Street, and Butters comes over a bump on the street. He heads towards the camera right in the middle of the street as the adults around him talk or window-shop. He walks on, and a Bennigan's appears to his left. He turns to look at it, then runs through the front doors. He stops just inside. The diners go about eating and chatting. A waitress serves a table.]
BENNIGAN'S CHEF
Order twenty-three is up, and uh, order twenty-four is up. [presses down on a bell twice.]
[Butters sees the dishes and walks up to them. He stares at them for a few seconds, then switches them, grinning evilly. He then drops down quickly as a waitress comes for the dishes. She delivers them to the two diners who ordered them.]
MAN 1
Uh, waitress, a-a-actually, I ordered the chicken soup. This is minestrone.
MAN 2
Yeah, I had the minestrone over here. [Butters laughs at his own cleverness. The diners look at him]
BUTTERS
I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me! [cackles once again and runs out of the restaurant. The diners resume their eating after a few seconds.]
[Montage 1 - A Day At The Amusement Park.]
STAN
[voice over a scene of all the kids walking down Main Street at the amusement park] So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends. [cut to Stan seated on a green sofa under a spotlight] It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.
CARTMAN
[on a blue sofa] I think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was Jimmy. [cut to Jimmy entertaining Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Dougie, Clyde, and Craig]
JIMMY
[cut to Jimmy on a dark green sofa] Well, the, the reason I think I would make the perfect foreh- friend, is that I love telling jokes. You know, who doesn't like to laugh?
KYLE
[seated on a cyan sofa] Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.
TWEEK
[sipping coffee, shaking violently] What if they don't pick me? What if they get us all, man! I mean, Christ! If they can get to the Pentagon, then they can get to us all, man! Aaaa!
DOGPOO PETUSKI
[a shot of the kids on the mine track ride, DogPoo in front with Cartman. Cut to the dirty boy who resembles Pigpen seated on a red sofa] I think I deserve to take Kenny's place the most, because, I've been hanging around these guys for like five years and I never get to say or do anything.
CARTMAN
...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop. [takes a sip of ZOOP soda]
KYLE
[a shot of Kyle, Cartman, Tweek, and Towelie in a spinning teacup] Towelie is a tough choice because, [cut to Kyle talking] even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high.
TOWELIE
[17 in towel years] Man, I really hope I win, because... wait... what is this again? I have no idea what's goin' on.
CARTMAN
We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride. [cut to the log ride] The great thing was that, because Jimmy's crippled, we got to go to the front of the line. [the boys are escorted to the first car, cut back to Cartman] That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, but then we got to the ride itself, and...
JIMMY
[back at the ride. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman climb into the log] Hey, I-I'm gonna need some help getting in the log, fellas.
RIDE OPERATOR
O! Shut her down. Someone needs assistance.
CARTMAN
[the boys look at Jimmy] Oh, really? [turns to his note pad] That's gonna cost some points. [writes down some numbers as Jimmy is helped into the log.]
KYLE
[on the sofa] But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell lame jokes.
JIMMY
[cut to log ride. The boys are about to slide down the track] Boy, isn't this great fellas? Are we great pals or what?
STAN
[voice over a scene of all the kids walking down Main Street at the amusement park] One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy.
[South Park, day. Butters is still dressed as Professor Chaos, still walking down the street. A dog walks across the street and Butters stops next to it.]
BUTTERS
Kneel. Kneel before Professor Chaos! [the dog slowly kneels and Butters walks off cackling at his success]
[Butters' house, later. He makes it to his room and locks the door. He cackles again.]
BUTTERS
Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos! [walks up to his dresser drawer and messes up some shirts in there, then closes the drawer and laughs] And that's only the beginning! [laughs evilly]
[Cartman's backyard, day. All the kids are seated as they were yesterday. A box of roses sits on stage.]
CARTMAN
All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten. [Kyle goes off to get the box of roses] If you receive a rose, please stay. If you don't, get the fudge out. [Kyle returns with the roses and sets them down] Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay?
KYLE
[holds up a rose for every kid he calls] Tolkien. [Tolkien approaches, gets his rose and goes back to his seat] Clyde. [Clyde goes for his rose] Craig. [Craig goes for his rose] Timmy.
TIMMY
Timmih! [goes for his rose]
TWEEK
Oh man! This is too much pressure!
KYLE
Pip. [Pip smiles and goes for his rose] Jimmy. [Jimmy goes for his rose] Jason. [a new boy with high forehead, goes for his rose] Towelie. [Towelie goes for his rose] Luigi. [Luigi goes for his rose].
CARTMAN
Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to?
KYLE
Tweek.
TWEEK
Aaarr! [goes for his rose]
CARTMAN
All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out! [the others moan and leave their seats]
DOGPOO
[incredulous] I didn't make the cut?? Oh God, I didn't make the cut??
DOUGIE
I didn't even get a chance to have them get to know me!
STAN
All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny. [the camera pans over the remaining candidates] Good luck.
[South Park, morning. Butters' house, kitchen. Linda is preparing some breakfast and Butters comes in confidently.]
LINDA
Good morning, Butters.
BUTTERS
[takes a a seat at the table] It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order at Bennigan's.
LINDA
No, [Butters blanches] I didn't hear about that.
BUTTERS
Yeh, you didn't? [leaves his seat and walks to the living room]
[Butters' house, living room. Butters walks up to Chris, who is on the sofa reading the newspaper.]
BUTTERS
Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?
STEPHEN
[lowers the newspaper] Why sure, Butters. I was just about to get some breakfast. [hands the paper to Butters, who sets it down on the floor and looks for headlines. The front page doesn't offer anything he's looking for, so he turns the page.]
BUTTERS
[getting mad] Nothing. [turns the next page] Nothing! [closes the paper and stands up] It's the liberal media! They're keeping the stories of my deeds covered up, so as not to cause a panic. Well, I guess it's time to step it up a notch! [makes two fists signaling his stepped-up efforts]
[The bus stop, later. Stan, Kyle and Cartman stand with Craig. Scene music plays.]
STAN
Okay, next? [signals for Craig to leave. Craig walks away and Tolkien comes in to take his place. Scene music plays. A few moments for the boys to get a feel for Tolkien]
KYLE
This looks pretty good.
STAN
Yeah, it's not bad. Next? [Signals for Tolkien to leave. Tolkien walks away and Timmy rides in to take his place. Scene music plays.]
TIMMY
Timmay!
CARTMAN
Next?
[South Park Elementary, day. Most of the class is present. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman stand at the front of the class. On the chalkboard is the times table for 4.]
CARTMAN
Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[entering] Sit down, boys.
CARTMAN
Alrighty then. [the boys take their seats]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
All right, children, before we get started, has anybody seen the eraser for the chalkboard? [a shot of the class, then of Butters. A sneer comes to his face as he laughs to himself. The room darkens around him and a shadow appears on the lower part of his face] It probably got knocked on the floor somewhere. Can you all just please look around your desks for it? [the kids drop from their seats and look around. The sneer is back on Butters' face and the shadow returns]
BUTTERS
[thinking] Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth. [a shot of Butters using a shovel to bury the eraser] And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser. [Butters' desk moves around so the camera can see the kids looking for the eraser] And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer! [the times table floats behind Butters and gets all jumbled up as he speaks, finally ending in a kid whose brains blow out of his head]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
No? Oh, oh well. Never mind. I've got a backup one in the desk. [opens a drawer, takes out an eraser and erases the times table on the board] Okay, today children, we're gonna learn about multiplying times five.
BUTTERS
[thwarted, begins to think again. The people around him take on their picture-negative counterparts] So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?!
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Now, whenever we multiply a number times five, the result is going to end in a zero or a five.
BUTTERS
Ms. Choksondik?
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[turns around] What is it, Butters?
BUTTERS
Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Oh alright Butters. Take the bathroom pass and go. [Butters gets off his seat and heads for the door. He takes the pass from the pegboard] Okay, so for instance, children-
BUTTERS
[opens the door, then looks back] Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Just go, Butters. [Butters smiles and leaves] Okay, so for instance, five times one is... what, Eric?
CARTMAN
Uh, what's the question again?
MS. CHOKSONDIK
[holds out the five fingers on her right hand] Five... times... [holds out the index finger on her left hand] one.
CARTMAN
Five times one is of course...
THE CLASS
[minus Cartman, Stan, and Kyle] Five.
CARTMAN
Five. [the door opens and Professor Chaos appears]
BUTTERS
[enters cackling] The time for fun and games is over, feeble-minded fools! [approaches Ms. Choksondik]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Who are you?
BUTTERS
I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand! [turns, takes the other eraser, and walks out cackling, closing the door. The class just looks at the door]
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Hey! That kid took my last eraser! [heads for the door] Come back here, kid! [as she reaches the door, it opens and Butters enters]
BUTTERS
Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
Butters, did you see another little kid run out of here?
BUTTERS
Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow. [raises his right elbow] Go on and look at it. It's scraped. Look. [as Ms. Choksondik looks at the elbow, the shadow and sneer return to Butters' face. He begins to think] Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail.
MS. CHOKSONDIK
It looks fine, Butters. [rises and addresses the class] Okay, hold on and stay here, children. [leaves the classroom. Butters sneers again]
[South Park Elementary, later. Recess. The kids are at play. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Craig are standing together.]
KYLE
You're such a fatass, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew!
STAN
Shut up, fatass! [silence. They look at Craig and the anger fades from their faces as they wait for him to respond]
CRAIG
Oh, aaaah, well you guys are dumb.
CARTMAN
[escorts Craig away] Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful stuff there, Craig. Thank you very much. [Craig leaves]
[Butters' house, night. Butters is at his desk working with his hamster set.]
BUTTERS
It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world. [puts glue on some aluminum, puts the aluminum on a hamster] There we go. [the hamsters will be armored, as he is. He places the hamster back in the cage] Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos. [the hamsters begin to make noise] Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring dest-struction will come very soon. [the door opens and Butters quickly throws a blanket over his hamster cage] Aaahhh!
LINDA
[Linda walks in and towards his desk] Butters, a note for you was left on the front door.
BUTTERS
A note?
LINDA
Here you go. [gives it to him and walks out] And wash your hands after you touch those hamsters - you'll get AIDS. [exits and closes the door]
BUTTERS
Okay, Mom. [takes a look at the envelope, spins around in his chair, and opens the envelope. He reads the letter within: "I know who you are. The South Park Docks. 7:30. Tonight"] So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I who'll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions! [pulls off the blanket] We haven't much time!
[Cartman's backyard, night. Stan, Kyle and Cartman are on stage for the next round of elimination.]
CARTMAN
All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle?
PIP
They're not going to pick me. I just know they're not.
TWEEK
O-oh Jesus! Aaah I can't take it!
KYLE
[as before, holds up a rose for every name] Tolkien.
TOLKIEN
All right! [goes for his rose]
KYLE
Timmy.
TIMMY
Timmay! [goes for his rose]
KYLE
Tweek. [Tweek goes for his rose] Pip.
PIP
Really? I don't believe it. [goes for his rose]
KYLE
Towelie.
TOWELIE
What?
CARTMAN
Just one more rose, Kyle.
KYLE
Jimmy.
JIMMY
Oh boy! Oh thank God! [goes for his rose]
CARTMAN
All right, those with roses will move on to the swimsuit and talent competition. The rest of you, get the fudge out! [Craig, Clyde, Jason, and Luigi leave]
CLYDE
[turns and looks at Cartman] This whole thing is stupid! You don't pick people you wanna be with by making it into a game!
CARTMAN
Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, "get the fudge out!" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!
[South Park docks, night. Under a red moon, Butters sneaks along the docks, making sure no one sees him. He creeps from box to box and peeks out from behind one. Another face peeks out from behind a box at the other end of the docks. This face is younger, with glasses.]
DOUGIE
[steps out] Hey Butters.
BUTTERS
[drops his guard and steps out] Oh, hey Dougie. [gets into character] Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos.
DOUGIE
I saw you change in the school bathroom. You stole that eraser in your class.
BUTTERS
Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise! [pulls out two hamsters from his pockets and sets them down] Go now, my minions. Go and take this, this foolish mortal down! [the hamsters head back towards shore] Aw minions, naw, not that way. He- [turns to see them leave] come back minions.
DOUGIE
I'm, not trying to call you out, Professor Chaos. I want to join you.
BUTTERS
Join me?
DOUGIE
Yeah I want to join you in your conquest of destruction.
BUTTERS
But why?
DOUGIE
[approaching] I'm an outcast, too. A frail child cast aside by society. I want to follow you and... whatever you're doing.
BUTTERS
Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red.
DOUGIE
Do I get a neato costume made out of aluminum foil, too?
BUTTERS
Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray.
DOUGIE
General Disarray.
BUTTERS
Now let us go look for my minions! [softly] They ran away here, now to find 'em... [the new villainous duo search the docks for the hamsters]
[Montage 2 - The Swimsuit And Talent Competition. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman sit on the chairs in the audience. The six remaining candidates are on stage.]
CARTMAN
[a shot of him on a sofa] The swimsuit competition really gave us a fresh look at some of the candidates. [a shot of the three boys making comments during judging. Cartman takes notes]
JIMMY
[on a sofa] Well, I don't think I did too well in the... bathing suit competition. But I can't wait for the talent show competition. That'll really be my chance to... shine. [cut to Cartman's house den for the competition. Jimmy's doing his comedy routine] Wow, what a terrific audience. So anyway, a guy walks into a buh- ...A guy walks into a b- ...buh... [a shot of the three boys getting bored] A guy walks into a guy walks into a [goes into a sing-song mode] babuh ba-a-a, uh- [next, Towelie playing an electric guitar - "Stairway To Heaven" - but messes up]
TOWELIE
Okay wait... [starts over, but messes up. The boys are bored again] No, no wait. [tries again]
CARTMAN
Next please.
TOLKIEN
[takes the mic] Well, what am I supposed to do?
KYLE
Anything that'll impress us, Tolkien.
CARTMAN
If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained?
TOLKIEN
Aaaah. Oh, I know. [takes his shirt and ties it into a knot between his breasts, then begins to shake his butt, giving the impression of a hula girl]
CARTMAN
Very nice. [takes notes]
STAN
I like it. [takes notes]
KYLE
[back to recap] Well Tolkien was a definite winner of the talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there.
[Coors Field in Denver. The game is underway. A shot of the field.]
ANNOUNCER
There goes a hit to left field, and Foley's going to score.
[The bleachers. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Pip sit and watch the game.]
ALL
Woohoo!
KYLE
Yeah! Isn't this great?!
VENDOR
[making his way down the steps] Drinks! Get your drinks here.
PIP
Eho! Yes. Can I have some tea, please?
CARTMAN
You don't drink tea at a baseball game, you French piece of crap!
PIP
Oh, very well. Just some crumpets, then.
CARTMAN
All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next! [Pip leaves his seat and Tolkien comes in]
STAN
Okay, let's try this. [a shot of the field. The Jumbotron at center field loses focus and glimpses of Professor Chaos are seen]
CARTMAN
Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron?
BUTTERS
People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos, [Dougie comes into view] and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my final Labor of Loathing! I am going to... flood... the world!
MAN 3
Flood the world?
MAN 4
My God!
WOMAN
[grabs onto someone] I don't wanna die, [screams] I DON'T WANNA DIE!
BUTTERS
Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth! [Dougie goes to the faucet by the porch and turns it on, then brings the hose to Butters. Butters addresses the world] You brought this upon yourselves! You made the outcasts of the world! Now watch! Watch as your precious planet drowns! Watch! [points at the pool of water now forming on the ground. The crowd watches in silence]
MAN 5
Dear Christ, who will save us?
MAN 6
We have very little time to live. How, how shall we spend our last hours on earth? [the crowd stops and reflects...]
FANS
Yeah! All right! [everyone takes off their clothes and celebrates in their underwear]
[Butters' house, day. Butters and Dougie are in the back yard watching their puddle grow and grow.]
BUTTERS
Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle! [the two of them watch the hose yield its water, seemingly slowly] Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray? [Dougie goes to look, then returns]
DOUGIE
It's on all the way.
BUTTERS
Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die! [cackles and dances around, then resumes watching the puddle grow. Day fades to night] Boy, this sure is takin' a long time.
[Stan's house, dining room. The three boys sit at the table with pictures of the six candidates. They discuss their findings.]
STAN
Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend? [holds up Towelie's picture]
CARTMAN
I think Towelie is awesome.
KYLE
Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything.
STAN
[weary] Oh, this is giving me a headache.
KYLE
Eh now, [pounds the table with his fist] come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on.
STAN
[acquiescing] You're right. Well now, how about Timmy? [holds up Timmy's picture] He's quiet and he takes direction well. Really the perfect friend.
CARTMAN
Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered.
STAN
How about Token? [holds up Tolkien's picture]
CARTMAN
Tolkien's a smartass.
KYLE
So? You're a smartass!
CARTMAN
Yeah. Do we really need another one?
KYLE
Good point. [Stan sets the picture down. A door opens]
JIMMY
[approaches the table] Hey fellas. I was just in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to s-gif- gift basket.
CARTMAN
[disgusted] Oh, thanks Jimmy.
JIMMY
There's some chocolates and lih-liquorice, and some games and peh- pencils inside.
STAN
That's great.
KYLE
Cool.
JIMMY
Yeah well, I guess I'll be seeing you, you friends later. [leaves]
CARTMAN
Alright Jimmy, see ya. [the door closes]
STAN
Suckup.
[Butters' house, next day, backyard. The pool has covered much of the yard. General Disarray jumps in the water as Professor Chaos looks on passively on the porch.]
BUTTERS
Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete.
DOUGIE
Hey, do you think maybe we should build a boat? You know, like a little raft or something, so that when the world floods you and me and the minions can live?
BUTTERS
Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer. [the sound of vehicles screeching to a stop outside the yard] Hey, who is that? [on the street, two Water Department vans come to a stop. Four men, two from each van, step out and get their tools. They enter the yard and approach the hose]
WORKER 1
Is this it?
WORKER 2
Yeah, two thirteen, that's the one. [Worker 1 proceeds to close the faucet]
BUTTERS
Heeyyy, what are you doin'? [Worker 1 finishes and the workers leave, climb into their vans, and drive off. Professor Chaos and General Disarray look on in sad disbelief. Suddenly, Butters flares up] Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back!
DOUGIE
What do we do now?
BUTTERS
[softly, pensive] Well I had another idea of how to kill the world, but I thought it was... almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but- [with anger growing] but now they have left me with no other choice!
[Cartman's backyard, day. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are on stage while the candidates sit in the audience. Pip is missing.]
CARTMAN
Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend. [the camera pans across the audience, showing the candidates close-up]
JIMMY
Oh puh please. Oh, Oh God... please. [Timmy just grins. Kyle draws the last rose from the box.]
CARTMAN
Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the rose go to? [another shot of the candidates]
[A hilltop, later. Butters reaches the top of a hill carrying a box, with a red sky above him. He sets the box down.]
BUTTERS
This is it, General Disarray. My final solution. [cut to a view of the town from said hill. ]
DOUGIE
[catches up] What evil plot do you have this time, Professor Chaos?
BUTTERS
Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful rays! [reaches into the box and withdraws a spray can] Say goodbye to your... precious ozone and hello to chaos! [begins spraying away. The can empties without discernible effect, and Butters tosses it down] Okay, hand me another one, General Disarray. [Dougie reaches in the box and takes out three cans. He gives one to Butters and keeps the other two. Butters quickly opens the can and sprays away, cackling all the while. Dougie opens his two cans and begins spraying as well, cackling along with Butters. The camera begins to zoom out]
ANNOUNCER
Will Professor Chaos's latest plot succeed and be the final undoing of Earth? [a shot of Stan, Cartman, Kyle, and the fourth boy under a blanket, all in Stan's living room] And which boy has been chosen to be the replacement for Kenny? [six adults are then shown: Chef, Mr. Garrison, Jimbo, Officer Barbrady, Ms. Choksondik, and Mayor McDaniels] And which of these six South Park residents was killed, and will never be seen again? [a question mark appears on screen] The answer to those questions will be answered... right now. [A final shot of Butters and Dougie with ten spent cans and three in use] No. [Stan's living room: the blanket comes off the fourth boy] Tweek. [on the street, in front of a house: Ms. Choksondik is on a gurney as paramedics cover her body with a blanket] Ms. Choksondik.
End of Professor Chaos


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Professor Chaos is frustrated when he realizes all of his diabolical plans to wreak havoc on South Park have already been done by "The Simpsons".

script:The Simpsons Already Did It

[Kyle's house, day. Stan and Kyle are happily preparing a snowman, which now has twigs, buttons, a hat and scarf. Tweek stands behind Stan holding a carrot.]
STAN
Okay, now put on the nose, Tweek. [Tweek moves forward, but then backs up. Stan rises and turns to Tweek]
TWEEK
I can't. [presents the carrot] You do it.
KYLE
Just stick it on.
TWEEK
But what if I put it in the wrong place?
STAN
Just put it between its eyes.
TWEEK
GARH. But what if, while I'm putting on the nose, the snowman comes to life and tries to kill me?
STAN
Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?
KYLE
Yeah.
BUTTERS
[happens by and waves] Hey, fellas.
STAN
[flatly] Oh, hey Butters.
BUTTERS
How are things... going with your new best friend?
KYLE
[walks up to Tweek] Well, Tweek's okay, but he's certainly no Kenny! [takes the carrot from Tweek's hand]
TWEEK
Arrrr!
STAN
Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters.
KYLE
Yeah.
BUTTERS
Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas. [takes his leave, screen left. Stan and Kyle resume work on the snowman]
TWEEK
Oh man, that is waaay too much pressure! [Kyle puts the carrot in place]
CARTMAN
[off screen. Stan and Kyle look] You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! [excited, he rushes up and stands between then, holding an ad]
STAN
Uh oh.
CARTMAN
Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all!
TWEEK
It's not?
CARTMAN
No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room!
KYLE
No way.
CARTMAN
Look! [the boys draw close. The ad is shown] Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, build castles and play basketball and stuff.
KYLE
Nuh uh.
CARTMAN
Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.
KYLE
No way.
CARTMAN
[shows irritation] Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on. [turns to Stan and Tweek and continues excitedly] Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow!
KYLE
Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars. [Cartman's smile vanishes and he shuts his eyes.]
CARTMAN
If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person!
STAN
Alright, I'll chip in.
TWEEK
Gah! Me too.
KYLE
[resigned] Ah, alright.
[Butters' house, day. He reaches his room.]
LINDA
Butters! Don't forget: dinner is in two hours!
BUTTERS
[in the doorway] Wokay, mom. Ah I'm just gonna be up here, uh doin' my homework. [he enters and closes the door behind him. His evil face shows] Yes. By day he is mild-mannered, sweet, and innocent Butters BUT... [runs to his closet and opens the sliding door, then steps inside] nobody knows that he actually has a dark underside... [slides the door shut and changes clothes. He slides the door open and comes out dressed as] Professor Chaos! Haha! Time to wreak havoc on the world that shunned me! [runs to his window, opens it, and jumps out. He skulks through the woods nearby with an easel. He reaches a clearing and sets up the easel. General Disarray shows up pulling a wagon of firewood]
DOUGIE
Professor Chaos!
BUTTERS
Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray.
DOUGIE
I have done as you asked and brought the first load of scrap wood.
BUTTERS
Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity. [EVIL PLOT #4-B]
DOUGIE
What dastardly deed are we doing now?
BUTTERS
Simple, my dear general. [flips the page over to show a drawing of the town with a huge shade over the town, held up by a tall pillar] We are going to block out the sun!
DOUGIE
[looking at the picture] Oh. [turns around]
BUTTERS
Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide [a hamster peers from the wood and drops back down again], precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow.
DOUGIE
Oh, awesome!
BUTTERS
Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be! [laughs with evil glee]
DOUGIE
Cool. It'll be just like on the Simpsons. [Butters stops laughing and freezes in place]
BUTTERS
[tilts his head forward] Huh?
DOUGIE
They did that on the Simpsons. I think it was the Mr. Burns character. He tried to block Springfield from the sun.
BUTTERS
He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original.
DOUGIE
So how do we build it?
BUTTERS
Aww, I don't wanna do it now [drops his hammer], not if they already did it on the Simpsons. [walks off dejected] I have to think of something else. [they walk through the woods] Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it?
[Cartman's house, night. The living room light is on. Cartman is sleeping, dreaming...]
CARTMAN
Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow... [bubbles appear as Cartman dreams] Yesss... Yeesss...
[The dream sequence.]
CARTMAN
[shown floating down to the briny deep. Two pairs of sea arms catch him. The sea couple rights him and walk with him in the middle]
Look at me, livin' free
Free and clean amongst the Sea People
[the sea couple and he sail by in a tiny pirate ship. They take him into the castle]
We look for pirates and search for gold.
Life is an adventure with the Sea People
[A sea man pitches to Cartman, who bats the ball for a run. As a sea family looks on he blows out the candles on a cake.]
They don't ever complain, they don't call me fat.
They don't make me do homework or nothin' like that.
[he rides a sea horse alongside sea people on horseback and grins at the camera]
This is the way life was meant to be. Laughin' and singing,
[Shown walking with the sea couple again.]
Sea people and me.
Sea people and me, you guys.
[The dream ends and the bubbles fade away. Cartman wakes up, smiling.]
CARTMAN
Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people. [closes his eyes and turns to his left side] Only three hours and you can take me away from this crappy goddamned planet full of hippies. [goes to sleep]
[Cartman's house, day. He's at his desk with the new kit while Stan, Kyle, and Tweek stand behind him. His dressed as a monarch, in suit, crown and cape.]
CARTMAN
Okay. I've added the water purifier tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank. Now it says [slowing down to read] "Step 2. [grabs a small sack] Add the Sea People eggs to the water; you will see sea life spring instantly." [smiles, then remembers something. He turns to face the other boys] Okay, let's just run through this one more time: when the sea people arrive I will welcome them to South Park as Ambassador of Earth. Tweek, you give them the key to the city, and we'll all engage them in simple conversation. We've gotta make sea people feel comfortable, okay? Ready?
STAN
Ready. Let's see 'em.
CARTMAN
[turns to the tank] Hold the sign up, Kyle! [Kyle picks a sign up off the floor and holds it to his chest] Higher, Kyle! [Kyle raises it higher, in front of his face] Okay. [opens the egg sack and whispers] Here we go. [pours the eggs into the tank and taps the bag for good measure. Kyle moves the sign a bit so he could peek. Cartman grins again in anticipation, but it fades. Kyle lowers the sign to his chest. Cartman looks from various angles, then takes out the magnifying glass for a closer look. Two pale shrimp crawl around in the tank. Kyle drops the sign]
STAN
Are they playing basketball? [Cartman picks up the box and looks at the front. A close-up of a sea couple. Cartman looks in the tank and sees just shrimp. He looks displeased, Kyle has the sign in hand again]
CARTMAN
What the fuck is this?! [Stan approaches and looks in the tank]
STAN
Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish.
CARTMAN
I got RIPPED OFF! [pounds the desk and sets the box on the floor to his left]
KYLE
I told you, Cartman.
CARTMAN
[approaches Kyle and confronts him] Oh, shut up, Kyle!!! Shut your Goddamned Jew mouth!!! You people are why there's war in the Middle East!!! [moves on to Tweek] And you, Tweek!! Why don't you learn to button your shirt right, for once?! You're as bad as Stan with his stupid girlfriend, always spending time with her!! God, I hate you guys!! [his rant ended, he walks across the room] They were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep.
TWEEK
[shaking] They package brine shrimp and sell them to kids? That's not right, man!
STAN
What are we gonna do with them?
CARTMAN
[at the window] Who cares?! Throw 'em away!!
KYLE
[approaches the tank] Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning.
STAN
Yeah, that'd be funny.
CARTMAN
[brightly] Heheh, okay, okay.
[Next day, Ms. Choksondik's house. The scene from last episode is carried on here, only zoomed out. The paramedics take Ms. Choksondik's corpse into the ambulance as a crowd looks on. The adults murmur amongst themselves. The ambulance pulls away and Cartman pulls the other boys in with some urgency.]
CARTMAN
Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence!
TWEEK
[blurts out] Jesus Christ, we killed her!
CARTMAN
[rushes to Tweek and covers his mouth] Shh! Tweek, shut the hell up!
[Dougie's house. He's doing homework on the living room coffee table when a doorbell rings. He goes to answer it. He opens the door and Butters steps in with something under wraps.]
BUTTERS
General Disarray, are your parents home?
DOUGIE
No.
BUTTERS
Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date.
DOUGIE
What?
BUTTERS
You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head! [pulls the cover off and laughs maniacally] Hahahahaa, yeah!
DOUGIE
Oh, uh...
BUTTERS
Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news! [turns on the TV]
NEWS ANCHOR
... but Hillary Clinton's ass just keeps getting bigger. [the image in the small box changes from Hillary to that of the decapitated statue] Also in the news tonight, a vandal has apparently cut off and stolen the head of the Powell statue in the South Park Town Square.
BUTTERS
Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc!
NEWS ANCHOR
The head was taken in the early morning hours and the police have no leads.
BUTTERS
I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos!
NEWS ANCHOR
This act, of course, reminded us all of the time that Bart Simpson [a picture of him appears in the box] took the head of the Springfield statue in one of their classic episodes. Here's what some people had to say:
MAN 1
Well, I, I think whoever took the head was... really just doing an homage to the Simpsons. [laughs] Heh, I think it's great.
WOMAN
Yes, it really made me reflect on that episode and laugh.
MAN 2
Well the Simpsons is such a great show, and we need reminders like this to keep us watching.
BUTTERS
Oh. Uh-m, son of a bitch.
NEWS ANCHOR
The police say that instead of looking for the missing head, they'd rather leave it off and be reminded of the Simpsons every day.
BUTTERS
Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that?
DOUGIE
You seemed so proud, I didn't wanna bum you out.
BUTTERS
[walks away hanging his head] Stupid Simpsons...
[Kyle's house, night. The boys watch TV on the sofa.]
TERRANCE
Hello there, Phillip. I brought you something.
PHILLIP
Oh, what is it? [Terrance farts and Phillip comments, but the boys talk over him]
KYLE
See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed.
TWEEK
Jesus Christ, she's dead!!
STAN
Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened.
TERRANCE
Phillip, I think I may have accidentally killed Celine Dion.
PHILLIP
[gasps] Killing is never an accident, you dickface! [farts, and the two of them crack up]
STAN
Oh jeez, change the channel.
NEWS ANCHOR
And in other news, still no cause of death found for elementary school teacher Diane Choksondik. However, doctors say that during the autopsy they did find semen in her stomach. [there's a pause and the boys look aghast]
STAN
They found the sea men! It's only a matter of time before they find the women, too!
NEWS ANCHOR
The autopsy is ongoing and cause of death is yet to be determined.
KYLE
Oh God!
STAN
We're dead!
TWEEK
Oh Jesus! [moves off the couch] That's it, man! I want nothing more to do with you guys!
CARTMAN
Tweek! Where are you going?
TWEEK
They're gonna find you out! Then when they do I don't wanna be within fifty feet of you! You're gonna fry, man!
STAN
Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are!
TWEEK
What?! I told you NOT to put the sea people in her coffee! I wasn't even there when you did it!
KYLE
Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable!
CARTMAN
In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one.
TWEEK
Rrrr-hr-hrrr!!!
[Chef's house, night. The boys arrive at his house and ring the bell. He opens the door and sees them.]
CHEF
Oh, well, hello there, children.
STAN
Chef, we did something kind of bad.
KYLE
We don't know who else to talk to.
CHEF
Ohh, I'm sure your little cracker problems ain't all that bad. Come on in. [the boys enter and Chef leads them to the sofa] Now, just sit down and take a deep breath and tell ol' Chef what's goin' on.
STAN
[pause] We need you to promise not to tell anybody.
CHEF
Now, children, every problem can be worked out. What was it?
STAN
We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach.
CHEF
...Oh, children, that's a problem we all have to face at one time or another. Here: let me sing you a little song that might cheer you up. Sometimes you kill your teacher and they find your semen in her stomach, and uh Wait! What the what?!
STAN
[beat] So what should we do? [Chef thinks, then goes and pushes the sofa towards the door and onto the entry path]
KYLE
Wow, I guess this really is a big deal.
CARTMAN
We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves.
TWEEK
Gnaaahahahah! [pulls on his hair and looks at his fist] I pulled out my hair!
[Dougie's house, night. In the living room Butters begins to pitch ideas.]
BUTTERS
Wokay, how about this, Dougie? [backs up to the easel. On it is the schematic to plan #123-D] I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money. [Dougie just looks back] No?
DOUGIE
...Simpsons did it. They did it in episode 204.
BUTTERS
Wokay [flips to the next page to show #124-A], then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumors about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their-
DOUGIE
Simpsons did it!
BUTTERS
[flips to plan #129-E] I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen-
DOUGIE
Simpsons did it!
[Hell's Pass Hospital, night. Cartman leads the other boys into the coroner's office.]
STAN
This is it.
CARTMAN
Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime.
TWEEK
Hammertime? Can't the code word just be... "lookout"? I won't remember "Hammertime"!
CARTMAN
[whispers] Ugh. [then] Just remember the song "Can't Touch This" and you'll remember the code word!
STAN
Yeah, stupid.
TWEEK
Oh, God. [the boys split up. Tweek goes to the door ajar and steps out, Kyle to a table to the right, Cartman to a table to the left, Stan to the supply closet. Cartman opens the doors under his table and looks around, then goes to Kyle's table to check out the drawers there.]
KYLE
[takes a wide covered beaker and look in it] There's nothing here! [puts it back and Stan approaches]
STAN
Dude, it's probably still in her stomach. [Kyle approaches the corpse in the middle of the room and pulls back the cover. Ms. Choksondik's chest and abdomen have been cut open right down the front]
CARTMAN
Is it her?
KYLE
Yeah, it's Ms. Choksondik alright.
STAN
What do we do now?
CARTMAN
Just reach in there and get the seamen out of her stomach! [the boys look at him, shocked] Oh, God! You guys are such pussies! [starts digging around in the belly] Hemmm...
TWEEK
[voices are heard; he rushes back in] Erm! Hff. You gu-guys! Ha... Hamme- [covers his mouth] I can't remember uh-the code word!
STAN
Do you see the sea people.
CARTMAN
No, just a bunch of goo.
TWEEK
[hushed tones. Shadows appear down the hall and move towards the room] You guys! Um, dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this.
KYLE
Ms. Choksondik stinks inside. [covers his nose]
STAN
Yeah.
TWEEK
[two people come down the hall] ...dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, then stop. HAMMERTIME!
STAN
Aaah!
KYLE
Quick. Hide. [the boys disperse. Stan runs to the closet he looked in earlier, Kyle to one on the opposite side, Tweek behind the door]
VOICE
[outside] Yeah, well, at least we got Shannon Sharp back. [Cartman burrows his way into Ms. Choksondik's corpse]
DOCTOR 1
Alright, let's just leave the semen sample next to the corpse; I wanna run a hair fiber test next. [snips a piece of hair off and turns around. They both walk back out]
DOCTOR 2
Hey, do you smell children?
DOCTOR 1
No, that's not... [voice fades. The doctors leave and the boys come out of their hiding places. Cartman is still in the corpse]
KYLE
Got it!
STAN
Let's go! [He, Kyle, and Tweek head out the door quickly. Cartman pops out of Ms. Choksondik's corpse gasping for air]
[Butters house, later that night. Butters presents plan #127-C.]
BUTTERS
Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the-
DOUGIE
Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!
BUTTERS
[flips to plan #125-E] Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that-
DOUGIE
Episode 9F17 entitled "So It's Come To This!"
BUTTERS
[seethes for a few seconds] Fine! Then maybe I'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus! [sits down next to Dougie]
DOUGIE
...Simpsons did it.
BUTTERS
Dwaah!!
[Cartman's house, later. In his room he takes the semen sample and pours it into his tank, tapping the rim of the tank so the semen can start moving. The semen slides into the tank and puts the lid back on.]
CARTMAN
There. We just put the sea people back in the tank with the others, and nobody will ever know. [looks at his hands] The blood is washed neatly from our hands. [the door opens and Chef enters with a bunch of stuff.]
CHEF
Alright, children, I got you four tickets to Thailand [in his right hand, with a sports bag] and three hundred dollars cash [inside the suitcase in his left hand]. It's gonna be tough living for a while. You might have to do things for money you never thought of doin' before.
CARTMAN
[stopping Chef] It's alright, Chef! We got our sea people out of the teacher's stomach and we put them back in their aquarium!
CHEF
[confused] ...Wait, what? Sea people?
STAN
The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.
CHEF
Uhh, maybe you'd better start from the beginning.
[Forty-three seconds later...]
STAN
...and then we put them back in the tank.
CHEF
[drops the bag, suitcase, and tickets] Oohhh, children, you misunderstood. Sea people is different from se-men.
KYLE
It is?
CHEF
Yes! That stuff that was in that vial didn't come from you, it came from someone else. [begins to chuckle] I thought you children took turns rapin' and then murdered the teacher. [laughs]
CARTMAN
Well if they found somebody else's sea men in her stomach, maybe they'll find our sea people, too.
CHEF
Relax, children, drinkin' some brine shrimp can't kill you. Your teacher must have died from something else.
KYLE
Oh, really?? [all four boys let out a sigh of relief]
TWEEK
Egh! I'm so relieved. Gaah-ah-ah!
CHEF
Alright. You children have had a long night. Why don't we all get some rest and on Monday, I'll sing you a song explainin' the difference between semen and sea people. [picks up the stuff. The boys approach] Come on, children. I'll walk you all home. [the boys follow Chef out]
STAN
[turns and waves to Cartman] Okay. Goodnight, Cartman. [turns and exits. Kyle follows]
CARTMAN
G'night, guys.
KYLE
I'm so glad we're not murderers. [Cartman closes the door behind them, moves to his bed and talkes off his hat and shoes. He places his hat on a corner of the footboard and hops into bed]
CARTMAN
[settling in] Ah, so great that everything is finally back to normal. [dozes off. The camera moves to the tank to look at the tank.]
[South Park, next day. Stan, Kyle, and Tweek stand at the bus station waiting for the bus.]
CARTMAN
[rushes up] H'you guys! Come quick! [turns and runs off] You won't believe it!
STAN
Oh no, what now? [the boys turn left and follow]
[Cartman's house, later. He leads them to his room, to the tank.]
CARTMAN
Those sea men from the teacher's stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and, ah, well LOOK! [the other three approach the tank. Cartman picks up the magnifying glass for a closer look]
KYLE
Whoa. [the close-up reveals a budding civilization with sea people building multi-story apartments and reads. The brine shrimp have begun to morph into sea people. Some of them wear clothes]
STAN
How? How did that happen?
CARTMAN
I've been up for hours doing some calculations, and I've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics. [brings out a small chalkboard with an equation written on it and points to the various parts of the equation] Sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety.
KYLE
Whoa.
STAN
They've already accomplished so much.
TWEEK
They're like, bacteria. Small organisms live much faster lives and do things at a much faster rate.
CARTMAN
That's right, Tweek. And if my theory is correct, all we need to get is more of the two reacting agents, and we can really see them thrive. Tweek!
TWEEK
Hr!
CARTMAN
You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to put them all in.
KYLE
Well what are you gonna do?
CARTMAN
Me? [camera closes in on him] I'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men.
[Dougie's room, day. Butters and Dougie are in costume. Between them is a contraption under a white sheet.]
BUTTERS
I've done it, General Disarray. I've watched all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold! [pulls the sheet off] This device that I have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise. [grins] People will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they'll get a mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey! [begins to cackle. Dougie fiddles with the machine] You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right?
DOUGIE
No, I think the Simpsons would be more clever than that.
BUTTERS
Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us!
ANNOUNCER
[a commercial for Cheesy-Poofs gives way to a Simpsons commercial] Tonight on the Simpsons: It's a laughorama when Bart builds a machine that takes the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replaces them instead, with mayonnaise.
BUTTERS
Nnno [turns and faces the TV], uh no, no, it can't be.
DOUGIE
Uh oh, Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! [a shot of the TV]
BUTTERS
No! No! [begins hallucinating]
DOUGIE
[now looking like Bart and no longer in costume] Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!
BUTTERS
Aaaaah!
DOUGIE
Don't have a cow, man.
BUTTERS
Oh sweet Jesus!
[Sperm Bank of South Park, day. Cartman hums as he approaches the door. He enters and walks down the hall. The tellers follow him with their eyes.]
WOMAN
Can I help you?
CARTMAN
Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men?
WOMAN
Your... mom told you?
CARTMAN
Do you have them or not?
WOMAN
We... sell semen, yes, but not normally to children.
CARTMAN
What's your name?
WOMAN
Frances Velman.
CARTMAN
Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound? [she looks at him and rises, moving off to her left.]
FRANCES
[goes to a refrigerator and pulls out a sample] Everything we supply here is by a quarter-ounce. [returns to the desk and gives it to Cartman] One donor, certified, on record.
CARTMAN
[inspecting the vial] I see, very interesting. [pulls the cap off and pours the semen onto his left hand]
FRANCES
What are you doing?
CARTMAN
Takin' a look here. [pulls out a portable microscope and inspects the semen between his left thumb and index finger. He stretches and squishes the semen. Frances looks on puzzled] Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five.
FRANCES
Five? Vials?
CARTMAN
No, gallons.
FRANCES
Www-we don't have that much here.
CARTMAN
Dammit! Give me all you've got, then! [the seminal fluid slides down on his fingers]
[South Park, in town. Butters runs from Dougie, who chases after him.]
BUTTERS
Aaah! Ah, Ah, Aaah! Nooo! Nooo!
DOUGIE
Simpsons did it!! Simpsons did it!! [Butters runs past Tom's Rhinoplasty, but stops to look at the town. It warps into Springfield; Tom's Rhinoplasty becomes Wink-E Mart]
BUTTERS
Waaaah! [starts to run again, and the school bus pulls up. Butters hails it down.] Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on! [the door opens and Butters steps on]
MS. CRABTREE
[looking like Otto the driver, but still with bird in hair] SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!!!
BUTTERS
[jumps backwards] Haaah! [ends up on his back on the sidewalk as the bus pulls away]
MR. GARRISON
[looking like Smithers] Butters, have you seen Mr. Hat?
CHEF
[looking like Dr. Hibbert] Hello there, children!
BUTTERS
[runs back the other way] Aaah! Nooo! [Chef and Garrison look at each other]
MR. GARRISON
...What the hell's wrong with him?
[Cartman's room, later. Stan looks at the aquarium and sees the civilization has developed further. Pyramids now appear. The sound of running water is in the background. Cut to Kyle filling a larger tank with a water hose..]
STAN
Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture.
TWEEK
Soon they'll discover frozen food. Goh-ho.
CARTMAN
[entering] That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek?
TWEEK
Uh-uh huh.
STAN
Well, drop them in! [Tweek opens the packets and drops the contents in]
CARTMAN
And I've got the sea men. [raises a bowl of semen up to the tank and begins scooping the fluid into the tank.]
KYLE
Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman.
CARTMAN
Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley.
STAN
That's cool.
CARTMAN
Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh. [scoops out the last of the semen] There we go. [drops the empty bowl]
STAN
[hands Cartman the smaller tank] Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home. [Cartman takes the tank and turns it over, pouring the sea ciety into the larger tank. Screams are heard from the sea people]
CARTMAN
Nothin' to do now but wait.[the boys huddle around the new, larger tank.]
STAN
...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?
CARTMAN
Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah.
STAN
Hm.
KYLE
Huh.
[Cartman's house, next day. He's asleep, but begins to stir. His eyes open and he grins at what he sees. He hops off the bed and rushes to the tank. He looks here and there and finds a more advanced civilization in the tank.]
CARTMAN
Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years. [grabs his magnifier and looks at the society. It now looks Roman. He begins to speak in wonder] Look! There's a library! A-and a temple! And a- who-? [spots a statue. It's one of him. Hundreds of sea people worship it] Oh. They think I'm God. [throws the magnifier away and rejoices] Yes!!! I am god of the sea people!!! You hear that?! [runs to his window, throws the doors open and screams out] I am god of the sea people!!! I am master of their great sunken empire!!! [his mom opens the door and takes some trash to the trash can next to the driveway] Mo-o-om! I'm god of the sea people!
LIANE
[returning to the house] That's nice, poopie. [enters and closes the door]
[Butters' house, day. He's sitting in the living room, which now takes the appearance of the Simpson living room.]
NEWS ANCHOR
[shown as Kent Brockman] And in other South Park News, elementary school teacher Ms. Choksondik's [Simpsonized] autopsy has shown that the semen in her stomach belongs to school counselor, Mr. Mackey. [also Simpsonized] However, the semen apparently did NOT contribute to the death, and so Mr. Mackey's identity is to remain anonymous. [Mackey's image becomes a silhouette and a question mark appears over it. Simpsonized Stan and Kyle enter the room.]
STAN, KYLE
Hey Butters.
BUTTERS
[spots their altered appearance] Haaa!
STAN
Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come.
BUTTERS
Cartman?
CARTMAN
[arrives, shown as Nelson] Ha ha! [Butters is just stunned.]
[Cartman's house, whick now looks like a typical Springfield house, day. In Cartman's room, everyone but Butters is shown Simpsons-style. Present are Chef, Mr. Garrison, Liane, Tweek, Timmy, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Dougie, and Butters. Cartman displays his new sea ciety.]
CARTMAN
Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god.
KYLE
Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us? [Butters looks on with some trepidation]
CARTMAN
Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea.
MR. GARRISON
That is very impressive, Eric. What do you intend to do with your underwater society?
CARTMAN
I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever.
BUTTERS
[sensing a chance to retort] Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha!
CARTMAN
What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?
BUTTERS
They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it starts to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha!
CARTMAN
[everyone is silent for a few seconds, then] ...So?
KYLE
...Yeah. So?
CARTMAN
Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares?
STAN
Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything.
MR. GARRISON
Every idea's been done, Butters, even before the Simpsons.
CHEF
Yeah. In fact, that episode was a rip-off of a Twilight Zone episode.
BUTTERS
Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter. [smiles. Everything before him is back in South Park-style] Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again.
CHEF
Good for you!
CARTMAN
Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room.
BUTTERS
[heads for the door] I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready to wreak havoc once again! [runs out of the room. Dougie stays behind]
STAN
Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue! [the others turn around to see. Shown is a statue of Tweek in progress]
KYLE
Hey! It's Tweek.
TWEEK
Me?? Aw, man! I don't wanna be a god. That is waaay too much pressure.
CARTMAN
That is bullcrap! You'd better stop worshiping him, sea people! [small explosions are seen and the tank jumps]
MR. GARRISON
What's going on now?
KYLE
The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side.
TWEEK
Gaaa-hah!
CARTMAN
Yeah! Go! [two more explosions are seen]
TWEEK
NOW what's happening?
STAN
The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.
CARTMAN
Oh God-damnit! [two missiles, one from behind each statue, fly towards the surface and back down towards their respective targets. The impacts both missiles create tear the tank apart and the sea people flood out of the tank. Screams are heard as they fall to the ground. Cartman is stunned, he looks and falls on his knees.] Oh no! Oh the humanity!
MR. GARRISON
Well it was a nice project while it lasted, boys.
KYLE
Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.
CARTMAN
Why can't societies just live in peace?
End of The Simpsons Already Did It


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:A sexual abuse scandal involving priests hits South Park and is taken all the way to the Vatican.

script:Red Hot Catholic Love

[South Park Catholic Church, day. Organ music plays. Inside, Priest Maxi is at the pulpit speaking to the congregation.]
PRIEST MAXI
Parents, it's that time of year again when the bishops and priests from around the country are organizing the Young Men's Catholic Retreat. This year, we're taking the boys on a weekend boat trip to discuss Jesus's role as the Navigator of our lives.
STAN
That sounds pretty fun.
RANDY
[pondering] A Catholic boat trip? [raises his left eyebrow and begins to daydream. He first sees a ship and disco music starts to play. What he imagines is "The Catholic Boat," a television program about cruises on a luxury cruise ship.]
SINGER
The Catholic Boat's gonna be headin' on out today.
The Catholic Boat. Time to throw all of your cares away.
Get some hot Christian action; it'll make you-
[As the song is sung, the show's logo appears: "The Catholic Boat." A pink anchor rises and ushers in the next scene: A happy Father Michaels stroking his chin. A second anchor, and Young Boy #1 (Butters) is shown. A third anchor and Father Williams appears. He pulls his shirt up to expose his chest. The fourth anchor, and Young Boy #2 (Tweek) is shown. The fifth anchor, and three priests, Fathers Abraham, Duncan, and Ortiz, are shown partying. Father Abraham falls over laughing. Father Duncan grabs Father Ortiz behind the head and pushes the head down... The sixth anchor, and Young Boy #3 (Stan) is shown. A priest's arm appears, running the index finger all over Stan's face...]
RANDY
[snapping out of it] Waaah! Waaah! [stops. Everyone in church looks at him, including Priest Maxi] Uyah [coughs a few times and clears his throat] ahem. 'Scuse me.
[South Park Catholic Church, day. Mass ends and the congregants go to their cars. A crowd gathers around Randy. The McCormicks are present.]
RANDY
Look, I just don't think it's the best idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise with the priests.
RICHARD
We can let them go, can we?
LINDA
There's no way my son's going.
[A black SUV, nearby. Stan, Cartman and Tweek are in the back seat. Cartman looks out the closed window.]
STAN
What are they talking about?
CARTMAN
I don't know.
TWEEK
Maybe they wanna kill us.
[Back to the crowd.]
RANDY
With everything that's been in the news, I think it's best to keep our kids... far away from the priests.
STUART
[dressed in fur-lined denim] Now, come on, everybody, just because a few priests in the country have been corrupted doesn't mean that all priests are child molesters.
RICHARD
Well, sure, that's easy for you to say; your son's dead. But those of us with alive children need to be sure that Father Maxi's on the up-and-up.
SHARON
I've heard about other towns bringing in counselors that know how to find things out from kids without really telling them what's going on.
RANDY
It couldn't hurt.
RICHARD
Uh, Sh-sh. Here he comes, here he comes. [all fall silent, then start whistling as Father Maxi passes by.]
PRIEST MAXI
[stops to listen] Uh... Good-bye, everyone.
ALL
[not all at once] Good-bye, Father. [resume whistling as Father Maxi walks off]
STEPHEN
Alright, then, it's settled. Tomorrow we'll find an outside counselor and... find out the truth.
[Park County Community Center, next day. The boys are chattering when a woman comes in and stands before them.]
COUNSELOR
Hi boys. My name is Ms. Gorache and I need to ask you a few questions about your priest, okaaay?
BOYS
Okay.
COUNSELOR
Okay. Would you say that Father Maxi is... nice? Or mean?
BOYS
[separately] Nice.
STAN
Um, cool.
COUNSELOR
Okaaay, what words would you use to describe your church's priest? [long pause]
BUTTERS
Compassionate.
COUNSELOR
Okay. And did Father Maxi, at any time, ever try to put something in your butt? [long pause]
CARTMAN
Ih... in our... butt?
COUNSELOR
You don't need to be ashamed or embarrassed. Just, did he ever try to put anything in your butt?
STAN
...Like ...money? What?
BUTTERS
You mean, like a goldfish?
COUNSELOR
No, no. Did he ever try to put anything that belonged to him in your butt?
BOYS
[in unison] No.
[The Community Center, hallway. The parents wait for the counselor to finish talking with the boys.]
THOMAS
This is ridiculous, havin' to sit out here waitin' to find out if our priest molested our kids.
ROGER
Yeah, what has Catholicism come to anyway?
RANDY
[rising. The others on his bench rise with him] You know, I think we've just had it with the Church. All the horrible things they've done to kids, I... I think I'm gonna become an atheist!
RICHARD
That's a good idea. I'm gonna be an atheist too.
LINDA
Let's all be atheists!
ALL
Yeah, yeah, alright.
ROGER
If there was a god, why would he let our kids be molested in the first place?
STEPHEN
Yeah, let's kill God, yeah!
RANDY
Well uh, let's, let's just be atheists.
STEPHEN
[thinks a bit, then looks at Randy] ...Same thing.
RANDY
Yeah! [all clamor and charge out of the center]
[South Park proper, on the curb. Stan, Cartman, and Tweek sit and think about stuff...]
STAN
What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts? [silence. Only birds are heard]
CARTMAN
[thinking] Maybe... No.
KYLE
[stopping by] Hey dudes.
STAN, CARTMAN
Hey.
TWEEK
Arr!
KYLE
What are you guys doin'?
STAN
We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest ever put anything in our butts.
KYLE
In your butts?
CARTMAN
Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing?
KYLE
Why would he put anything in your butts?
STAN
We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.
CARTMAN
Hm.
KYLE
[joins them on the curb] Hm. [long pause]
CHEF
[stopping by] Hello there, children!
STAN
Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt?
CHEF
Good-bah! [leaves quickly]
TWEEK
Rrrh. Nobody is going to tell us. This is going to drive me insane!
KYLE
Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation.
CARTMAN
Aw, dude, I think I might have it.
STAN
What?
CARTMAN
[gets up and starts pacing] It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out your butt, right?
KYLE
Yeah.
CARTMAN
Alright, now keep working with me here, it's getting a little complicated. If you eat food and crap out your butt, then maybe, if you stuck food in your butt, you crap out your mouth. [long pause] Hm?
KYLE
Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week!
CARTMAN
What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius.
KYLE
It wouldn't work!
CARTMAN
Have you ever tried it?
KYLE
I don't need to. It wouldn't work.
CARTMAN
I bet you twenty bucks it'll work!
KYLE
You're on, fat boy!
CARTMAN
Okay, let's go, Jew! [Cartman rushes off and Kyle follow. Stan and Tweek remain seated on the curb.]
PARENTS
[pass by in a crowd screaming] Yeah, yeah! Down with God! Down with God!
RANDY
Stan, you're an atheist now!
RICHARD
You too, Tweek!
PARENTS
[moving on] Yeah, yeah! Down with God! Down with God!
TWEEK
I'm a what??
[Diocesan headquarters, day. Sixteen priests are present in the boardroom, with Father Maxi presiding.]
PRIEST MAXI
Fathers, I want to thank you all for coming.
PRIEST 1
[African-American] No, thank you for finally organizing an all-priests meeting, Father Maxi. I think we all agree something has to be done, quickly. [the other priests concur]
ELDERLY PRIEST
Well, I don't know how it's been for all of you, but attendance at my church in Fort Rawlins is down sixty-three percent! [pounds on the table for emphasis]
PRIEST 2
I'm down almost seventy in Greenleaf.
PRIEST MAXI
Uh-yes, uh, I'm afraid if things keep going the way they are, we could lose our entire religion.
ELDERLY PRIEST
Yes, we've gotta stop these boys from goin' to the public!
FAT PRIEST
They've gotta know to keep their mouths shut!
OTHER PRIESTS
That's right, yeah.
PRIEST MAXI
Right, and so... wa- wait a minute. What?
PRIEST 1
Yes, but we've got to find out why these children are suddenly finding it necessary to report that they're being molested. Stop the problem at its source.
PRIEST 2
Yes, but how?
PRIEST 3
[amid discussion] Something has to be done.
PRIEST 4
We've got to stop this-
PRIEST MAXI
[rising] Whoa, whoa, hold on a second! The problem is that children are being molested, not that they're reporting it! [all fall silent]
ELDERLY PRIEST
How do you mean?
PRIEST MAXI
Well, I mean, obviously, what we need to put a stop to is all the sexual misconduct that is allowed to take place in our churches, and not just tell the children not to tell anybody about it. I mean, right?
PRIEST 1
Well did any of the children you've molested come forward?
PRIEST MAXI
No.
PRIEST 1
Well, that's good.
PRIEST MAXI
No, I mean! I've never molested any of the children in my church!
ELDERLY PRIEST
Hih-it's okay, Father Maxi. We're all priests here; the doors are closed.
PRIEST MAXI
Oh for the love of God! Are you all saying that you've engaged in inappropriate relations with your altar boys? We are here to bring the light of God, not harm the innocent! [the other priests look at him and laugh] I'm serious!
PRIEST 2
Father, uh, having sex with boys is part of the Catholic priest's way of life.
OTHER PRIESTS
Yeah. [they continue to talk, but Father Maxi isn't listening...]
PRIEST MAXI
Dear God. This problem is much more severe than I could have possibly imagined. I have to go to the Vatican and get help.
[South Park Elementary School, boys' bathroom, day. A group of fourth-grade boys gather around a toilet as Cartman stands before it trying to crap into it... with his mouth.]
KYLE
Well, Cartman?
CARTMAN
[turns to look at Kyle] Hold on! [turns back to the task at hand] God, let a man crap!
CRAIG
[entering] What's going on?
STAN
Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth.
CRAIG
Oh. [leaves]
KYLE
Well, go on, smartass, and do it!
CARTMAN
I'm doin' it already!! God, give me a minute!
STAN
You've had five, dude!
CARTMAN
[looking at the boys] I can't-, I can't do it with you guys watching. Turn around.
KYLE
No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth!
CARTMAN
Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that deceitful, you guys?! [the other boys fix their gaze at him] Ugh, goddammit you guys, this is so seriously. [tries again. A few spasms later and a big log of crap comes out his mouth and into the toilet. All the boys are stunned, even Cartman.]
KYLE
Get the fuck out of here!
CARTMAN
[excited] Yes!! Yes, I DID IT!! I crapped out my mouth! [starts chanting] I crapped out my mo-outh! [walks over to Kyle] You owe me twenty bucks, dickface!
[Vatican City, Italy. Father Maxi has made it to St. Peter's Square. He exits a taxi cab.]
PRIEST MAXI
[to the driver] Well, there you go. Um, grazie. [the driver leaves, Father Maxi turns to walk to the Vatican] Wow, I'm actually here. Vatican City! [looks at the fountains on either side of the square. Inside the Vatican a choir sings softly in the background as Father Maxi awaits the pope. The room is full or prelates. The pope, hunched over and frail, approaches the altar with a group of bishops]
ITALIAN CARDINAL
Your Holiness, this is Father Maxi from America. He has brought this all to our attention.
PRIEST MAXI
[kneels before the pope] Your Holiness. [kisses the ring and the pope moans a bit in pain. The cardinal helps the pope up to his chair, then turns and approaches the pulpit.]
ITALIAN CARDINAL
Adoramus te, Christe.
OTHER CARDINALS
Et dominus...
ITALIAN CARDINAL
Cardinals, bishops, and priests, an American priest by the name of-a Maxi has brought to our attention the most troubling of news. All over his-a country there are reports of children being molested by men of the Church. If things continue this way, we'll never be able to have sex with young boys again! [the prelates react immediately, protesting the report]
PRIEST MAXI
That's right-wait. What?
FRENCH CARDINAL
In France as well we are finding it harder and harder to... make love to our boys.
MOROCCAN CARDINAL
In Morocco they have arrested five of my priests. It's only a matter of time before they get the rest of us.
ITALIAN CARDINAL
Father Maxi, what do you suggest we do to not get caught.
PRIEST MAXI
Not get caught? NO!! I, I think what we should do is not have sex with boys! [the prelates protest again]
ITALIAN CARDINAL
It is not written anywhere in the Holy Document of Vatican Law that sex with-a boys is wrong..
PRIEST MAXI
Well, maybe we need to change the Holy Document of Vatican Law. [the prelates protest even louder]
BRITISH CARDINAL
Speaking on behalf of the British Catholics, it is obvious that the priest doesn't realize that the Holy Document of Vatican Law can not be changed!
THE CLERGY
[more protests] Yeah! It cannot be changed! Yeah!
GELGAMEK CARDINAL
Yes, and speaking on behalf of the Gelgamek Catholics, I believe we should move on to other solutions to this problem. [the prelates protest even louder]
PRIEST MAXI
Gelgameks?
[Kyle's house, night. Cartman walks alone to the front door and rings the doorbell. Kyle comes to answer it. He opens the door...]
CARTMAN
Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice. [puts his hands behind his back oh so modestly]
KYLE
What? [appears genuinely concerned]
CARTMAN
It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars! [Kyle gets upset] I was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought- [Kyle shuts the door on him, looks, then turns around and walks away from the door. Cartman pops up outside a window waving the bill at him. Kyle turns, goes to the window, and lowers the blinds, then walks off]
[Stan's house, dinner time. Sharon brings out hamburgers from the kitchen.]
RANDY
Oh boy, now that we're atheists we don't have to pray for our food.
SHARON
That's right, everyone just dig in. [Grandpa takes a bite from his burger] So, kids, anything fun happen with your whole Sunday off?
STAN
Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth.
SHARON
Stanley! [Shelly isn't too pleased to hear that]
STAN
What? He did.
RANDY
Noho, it doesn't work that way, son.
STAN
Yeah it does.
RANDY
No it doesn't.
STAN
[firmly] Yeah. It does. [Randy looks at him angrily, then wonders if it could be...]
[Stan's house, bedtime. Randy is in his pajamas kneeling before the toilet. He's now trying to crap out his mouth. After much effort, a log of crap comes out his mouth and into the toilet. Randy is stunned.]
RANDY
Honey! Honey, come quick!
[St. Peter's Square, day. Father Maxi is trying to get his point across.]
PRIEST MAXI
Look, people! I'm just trying to say that if we don't change the Holy Document of Vatican Law, then we might lose everyone to atheism!
FRENCH CARDINAL
What exactly do you suggest we change, Father Maxi.
PRIEST MAXI
Well, for one, no sex with boys. [the prelates protest even louder]
ANOTHER CARDINAL
The Holy Document of Vatican Law states that a priest, bishop, or cardinal cannot get married, so where are we to get our sex?
PRIEST MAXI
Uh well then, perhaps we could change the Holy Document of Vatican Law to say that... it's okay for a priest or bishop or cardinal to have sex... with women. [the prelates protest even louder]
FRENCH CARDINAL
Women?
GELGAMEK CARDINAL
The Gelgamek vagina is three feet wide and filled with razor-sharp teeth. Do you really expect us to have sex with them?!
PRIEST MAXI
Wuh- okay, m-maybe we just need to forget about the Gelgameks for a second and focus-
GELGAMEK CARDINAL
Forget about the Gelgameks?! [the other Gelgamek clergy protest loudly]
PRIEST MAXI
I'm just saying, what works on planet Gelgamek isn't necessarily goin' ta work for the rest of us here, on Earth. You see? That's the problem we're having here.
ITALIAN CARDINAL
But-a the Holy Document of Vatican Law cannot be changed!
PRIEST MAXI
Why not?!
ANOTHER CARDINAL
Because we don't know where it is.
ITALIAN CARDINAL
You see, Father, the Holy Document of Vatican Law has been hidden away deep in the Catacombs of-a St. Peter's below us. Hidden away so that it can never be changed.
PRIEST MAXI
But if we locate it we can make changes to it?
A BISHOP
HA! Good luck, father! The document is guarded by water lizards, rattlesnakes and sand traps! The fools who have tried before to recover it met their deaths!
PRIEST MAXI
Well we have to try. Our religion is dying!
[Stan's house. He, Kyle, and Tweek watch television. The front door closes off screen.]
CARTMAN
[arriving] You guys! You guys! Look! [he's dressed in a bathrobe, swim trunks, and sandals]
TWEEK
Harrr!
CARTMAN
I went down to the bank and got Kyle's twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty single-dollar bills.
STAN
So?
CARTMAN
So? So now I can do this! [takes off his robe, throws the bills in the air, and rolls around in the floating bills.] Yeess! Yeess, Kyle's money! Mmmm, Kyle's money!
KYLE
[simmers quietly, then] Go fuck yourself, Cartman!
CARTMAN
[luxuriating in the bills] Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm.
KYLE
[feeling angered, gets off the couch and confronts Cartman] Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass!
CARTMAN
Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go.
KYLE
So you crapped out of your mouth! Good for you! It's still stupid and immature! [a news bulletin's music is heard]
STAN
Dude, look.
NEWS ANCHOR
[the News 4 set is shown] Our top story tonight, the age-old question has been answered: if I put food up my ass, will I crap out my mouth? All over the country, people are discovering that, yes, in fact, you will. [a new picture pops up] The Surgeon General had this to say:
SURGEON GENERAL
And the uh immediate research shows that the act is not only amusing, but in fact much healthier for our bodies than the old way of eating. [stands next to a cut-away graphic of the human torso] You see, food entering through the anus has the benefit of being broken down on its way to the stomach rather than afterward. And therefore I believe that interorectogestion would actually put a stop to high cholesterol and most kinds of stomach cancers. And I base that on absolutely nothing.
NEWS ANCHOR
The Surgeon-General's response has made Americans change their eating habits almost instantly.
CARTMAN
[with a solid retort] That's stupid and immature, Cartman!
KYLE
[moves closer to Cartman] It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a freakin' medal?!
NEWS ANCHOR
The Mayor of South Park has announced that for first discovering this healthy way of eating, young citizen [Cartman's picture appears] Eric Cartman will be given... a freaking medal.
KYLE
[kyle's short temper is set off] HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
[A kitchen set in a studio, day. An attractive woman is busy preparing a dish on the stove.]
ANNOUNCER
[a show logo appears...] Now, with more on "Martha Stewart's Living" [the logo disappears and the camera zooms in].
MARTHA STEWART
In the past few days we've all heard of the healthy benefits of interorectogestion, and so making food that can easily be inserted into the ass is essential. [begins to move to her left] Now, everyone knows that some foods are simple to shove up the ass - puddings, soups, raisins... this is a nice raisin pudding right here - but we can also still eat our favorite foods. What we're gonna do today is prepare a Thanksgiving turkey for interorecto. [reaches the turkey and stops] Now, the key to shoving a turkey up your ass is first wrapping it in string, keeping the pointy wings neatly at the side. [starts wrapping the turkey. Two FBI agents show up at the rear of the set]
FBI AGENT
Ms. Stewart, we have some questions.
MARTHA STEWART
[starts wrapping faster] Not right now, I just wanna focus on my turkey, [softly] right now. [the agents withdraw. She finishes and lays the turkey down on a platter] Now, we're going to baste the turkey with lubricating gel rather than with juice - this'll help smooth the insertion later on. We still bake at four hundred degrees for twenty minutes a pound. [leaves that turkey alone and moves further left to a turkey fresh from the oven] When it's done we'll get something like this. [grins] So now we're ready to go. Looks delicious. Let's try it out. [takes the cooked turkey, moves to a clear area onstage, sets the platter down, stands the turkey up, moves into position, and sits on the turkey. Slowly, with grunts every few seconds, she eats the turkey with her butt] Aaaaa-... Yeah, get it up there. Yeah. AAAA. Yeeaahhhh. [one final heavy grunt, and a sigh of relief, then she stands up] Phew. And that is how you eat a turkey. [grins] We'll be right back with more. [grins, and exit music plays]
[The Catacombs under St. Peter's Basilica. Father Maxi, with torch in hand, walks down a hall past walls with writing on them. He descends some stairs and crosses a large room, stopping at a door behind which there is a brightly-lit room.]
OLD MONK
[appears out of nowhere] Beoo!
PRIEST MAXI
[jumps back] Ahh, hello. Uh- My name is Father Maxi, from the United States.
OLD MONK
What do you seek, Father?
PRIEST MAXI
I... I'm trying to find the Holy Document of Vatican Law. ...So that we can make revisions to it.
OLD MONK
That Gospel... [turns around and faces the door] lies somewhere beyond this door. [turns around] But... many trials await thee inside! Only he whose heart truly belongs to the Lord shalla make it through.
PRIEST MAXI
I have to try. Our religion is in trouble, and... and that scroll may be our only hope!
OLD MONK
Then, prepare yourself. The time of trials begins. [turns and says to the door] Adoramus te, Christe! [the door becomes two doors, and they part to show the brilliant room. The old monk approaches Father Maxi] I wish you luck, Father. [moves to Father's left side and coaches him] Use all the strength, agility, and faith that you have.
PRIEST MAXI
Very well. Here we go. [enters and finds himself in a video game environment. He jumps over a hole in one screen, jumps on the heads of three alligators gingerly in the next screen, grabs at a rope and swings over a lake to the other side in the third screen. He reaches the fourth screen. A snake appears in the underground passageway beneath him] Hmmm, there's a ladder up here. [climbs down the ladder and sees the snake] Oh my God, a rattlesnake! [turns and runs past the ladder to the next screen, where another ladder awaits] A way back up! [climbs up and rushes out of there. He enters a secret chapel, having survived all the obstacles to get there. He's quite beaten up. The document sits on a lectern and is well-lit. Father Maxi sighs] I've made it! Praise be to God! He hath shown me the way! [approaches the document] This must be it. The Holy Document of Vatican Law. [picks it up and blows any dust from it.]
[The Marsh house, day. Six sets of parents sit around the living room coffee table. Randy sits on the sofa with the Stotches. Above them hangs a banner with red letters on white fabric: "SOUTHPARK ATHEISTS' CLUB".]
RANDY
Well, Sharon and I are havin' a great time bein' atheist. I for one can't believe I used to live my life by what a very old and very fictional book used to say. [all laugh]
LINDA
Well it's true. I mean, what do a bunch of stories about people in robes slaughtering goats have to do with today's world?
RICHARD
Atheism has definitely made our lives better.
SHARON
[arrives with fresh food and a basket] I made some quesadillas, if anybody wants some.
ALL
Ooohh.
SHARON
And if anybody needs to potty, there's a potty basket right here. [sets it down next to the coffee table]
RICHARD
Oh thanks, Sharon.
ROGER
You know, for Martha and I, we're, we're worried we might have a hard time raising our son atheist. I mean- [the quesadillas appear, and he takes one] whoa, thank you -I mean, [rises and unzips his pants] it could end up being very difficult raising an atheist child in such a Christian society. [puts the quesadilla up to his butt and begins eating it. This causes him to grunt at times. Martha looks away] I feel that everywhere my poor son goes he's being persecuted for his beliefs. [finishes eating and zips up]
RICHARD
That's true. If I'm gonna raise my son to be atheist, I don't want him saying "under God" every day at school. That could really damage him. "Under God" should be taken out of the- uh, 'scuse me. [turns aside, looks down, and opens his mouth] Moowwaaagh. [faces the group again and brushes off any remaining crap with his sweater sleeve] "Under God" should be taken out of the Pledge of Allegiance.
RANDY
[amid the chatter] That's right, I agree. [the others quiet down] And it should be taken off of money as well. [gets angry] The religious right in this country is trying to force our children to believe what they bel- [reaches for the basket and craps into it] Bwwaaaagh [finishes and sets the basket down] And we can't let the religious right corrupt our kids.
ALL
That's right, that's right.
[St. Peter's Basilica, day.]
ITALIAN CARDINAL
Cardinals, bishops and priests! Father Maxi has returned! And he has the Holy Document of-a Vatican Law! [the clergy ooohs and aaahs]
BRITISH CARDINAL
How did he make it past the water lizards?
PRIEST MAXI
[lifts the parchment over his head for all to see] Yes, I have returned with the Holy Document of Vatican Law, so can we PLEASE, change it now to say, "It's NOT okay to have sex with boys"? [a shot of the clergy as the tapping of a staff is heard. It's the pope striking the ground with it.]
ITALIAN CARDINAL
Wait wait-a, the pope-a wants-a to say something. [the cardinal approaches the pope and has words with him, then returns to the pulpit] The pope-a says we shall ask the highest source. [the clergy ooohs and aaahs. They begin to sway and chant, and the windows above brighten as beams of light flood in]
PRIEST MAXI
[taken aback] Oh my. [a large screen-size area appears and a large creature rises from the depths]
ITALIAN CARDINAL
The holy one! [arachnid legs appear] Behold the great Queen Spider! [sure enough, a spider some twenty feet tall appears]
THE CLERGY
Hail Queen Spider!
PRIEST MAXI
[looking at the Italian cardinal] Queen Spider?
ITALIAN CARDINAL
O great Queen Spider, we seek a-your guidance.
QUEEN SPIDER
What do you ask of me?
BRITISH CARDINAL
Great Queen Spider, we wish to change one of the Vatican rules.
QUEEN SPIDER
The Vatican rules cannot be changed. So saith the Spider.
ITALIAN CARDINAL
Go on, Priest Maxi. See if you can convince her.
PRIEST MAXI
Alright, that does it!!! I've had enough!!! You people have completely lost touch with the outside world! You sit in this big room with your Gelgameks and your Queen Spider, and none of it applies to what being a Catholic is all about!!
A BISHOP
But the Holy Document of Vatican Law states that-
PRIEST MAXI
To hell with the Holy Document of Vatican Law!! [tears it in two, and the clergy gasps. The basilica begins to tremble and fall apart and the clergy start screaming in fear. Outside, the square itself begins to crumble]
[South Park, day. The boys stand in front of Stan's house.]
CARTMAN
[rushes up] You guys, you guys! [drags a small inflatable wading pool behind him] I took Kyle's twenty dollars down to the bank again, and I got it changed into quarters!
KYLE
[irritated] So?
CARTMAN
So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long! [picks up the bag of quarters and prepares to pour them in] Yeessss. Kyle's monneey. [the quarters start pouring in, and Cartman gloats]
KYLE
[approaches Cartman and tries a different tack] Cartman, there's something I need to tell you.
CARTMAN
O-hoo, what's that, Kyle?
KYLE
You were totally, one hundred percent right.
CARTMAN
Heh... [the smile vanishes] what?
KYLE
You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend.
CARTMAN
[taking time to figure out what that means...] You sonofabitch, Kyle!! I hate you!! [kicks the pool and it deflates. He walks away angry. Stan and Kyle grin at each other - they planned this change in tactics. The parents arrive cheering and hollering]
A MAN
Yeah, the pope is gone!
RANDY
Great news, Stan! The Vatican is burning down!
LINDA
Score one for us atheists!
RICHARD
Come on, Tweek! We're gonna watch it on TV! [the parents resume clamoring and move off]
[Vatican City, day. The clergy mill around in the ruins of the Vatican.]
ITALIAN CARDINAL
Gone! It's all gone!
BRITISH CARDINAL
Well, thanks a lot, Father Maxi. You've killed our religion.
PRIEST MAXI
No I didn't! All that's dead are your stupid laws and rules! [the scene is being telecast] You've forgotten what being a Catholic is all about. [raises a Bible] This... book. You see, these are just stories. [the Marshes are gathered on the sofa to watch this. Grandpa is asleep in his wheelchair] Stories that are meant to help guide people in the right direction. Love your neighbor. Be a good person. [the Williams are watching] That's it! And when you start turning the stories into literal translations of hierarchies and power, well... Well, you end up with this. [shows off the ruins, and then the Queen Spider, then the Gelgameks] People are losing faith because they don't see how what you've turned the religion into applies to them! They've lost touch with any idea of any kind of religion, and when they have no mythology to try and live their lives by, well, they just start spewing a bunch of crap out of their mouths! [The Tweeks are watching. Richard seems to have crapped out of his mouth]
RICHARD
[pause, then looks up] ...What was that last bit?
PRIEST MAXI
Look, I, I'm proud to be a Catholic. But I'm a Catholic in the real world. In today's world! It's time for you all to do that, too. It is time... for change.
[Stan's house, after the telecast.]
RANDY
[after a moment of reflection] He's right, Sharon. We don't have to believe every word of the Bible. They're just stories to help us to live by. We shouldn't toss away the lessons of the Bible just because some assholes in Italy screwed it up.
SHARON
Oh, Randy, I don't wanna put food up my butt anymore.
RANDY
Gang, I think maybe we, owe God an apology.
STAN
Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?
RANDY
No. It means we get to, son. It means... we get to. [all of a sudden, one more piece of crap comes out his mouth]
End of Red Hot Catholic Love


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:When the boys find out that their favorite movies are being enhanced, re-released and ruined in the process, they form a club to "Save Films from their Directors".

script:Free Hat

[The Bijou, day, inside. The four boys are seated in the front row in the nearly empty theater. A couple sits near the back, just three rows behind.]
STAN
Oh, cool. A preview. [the curtain goes up and the preview, for a PG-rated film, airs]
ANNOUNCER
Coming this summer [those words seem to approach the viewer], it's the classic film that changed America. E.T.: The Extraterrestrial, the new, redone version for 2002. [First, the classic shot of the kids flying across the sky with the moon in the background, then a shot of the kids taking off from the road. The police who are there to stop the kids have walkie-talkies in hand instead of guns.] All the E.T. effects have been digitally upgraded. [a shot of E.T. dressed in drag walking across a room] All the guns have been digitally changed to walkie-talkies. And the word "TERRORIST" has been changed to "HIPPIE."
STAN
Aw, dude, why would they do that?
CARTMAN
Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.
KYLE
No, dude. Spielberg changed "terrorist" to "hippie" to make E.T. more P.C.
STAN
That's gay. [next trailer airs. No rating seen]
ANNOUNCER
Coming this summer, it's the motion picture that changed America. Saving Private Ryan, the RE-RE-RELEASE, where the word "NAZI" has been changed to "PERSONS WITH POLITICAL DIFFERENCES," and all their guns have been replaced by walkie-talkies. [a shot of the landing at Normandy, in all its bloody glory, but all the guns are indeed walkie-talkies]
STAN
Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?
ANNOUNCER
And now, for your feature presentation: the classic RE-RE-RE-RELEASE of Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.
THE BOYS
Woohoo!
ANNOUNCER
In this version, the word "WOOKIE" has been changed to "HAIR CHALLENGED ANIMAL" and the entire cast has been digitally replaced by Ewoks.
THE BOYS
[first express shock, then anger] AWWWW!!! [they leave their seats.]
[The Bijou, day, outside. The boys exit the theater.]
STAN
Goddamnit, that pisses me off!
CARTMAN
[they reach the ticket booth] Yeah, we want our money back!
TICKET OPERATOR
Sorry, suckers! [quickly rolls the blinds down. The boys turn around]
CARTMAN
You asshole! [turns around and catches up with the other boys]
KYLE
Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!
TWEEK
Don't you see what this means? All our favorite movies are going to be changed, and updated, until we can't even recognize them anymore.
STAN
Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!
KYLE
Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now.
STAN
We have to do something. Let's form a club.
CARTMAN
Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit.
STAN
No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!
KYLE
Yeah. We'll be the "Save Films From Their Own Directors" club.
CARTMAN, STAN
Yeah.
TWEEK
NO! Nono, ah I don't wanna form a club! That's too much pressure! Look, ah-I'm supposed to take it easy; just, watch the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if we form a club there'll be responsibilites. Commitments!
CARTMAN
Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we thought you were a team player!
TWEEK
I'm not! I'm not a team player!
CARTMAN
Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU!
TWEEK
[giving in] D'oh-ho! Oh Jesus!
[South Park, later. The boys stand next to a phone pole and Stan nails a sign onto it. He finishes and backs up to have a good look at it.]
CARTMAN
Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up!
STAN
Well what's wrong with it?
CARTMAN
Look at it, dude. You're not offering any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here. [takes the marker and adds the words "FRee HAT" at the very end.]
KYLE
"Free hat?"
CARTMAN
Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up.
TWEEK
But we don't have hats!
CARTMAN
Well we can just make them out of paper.
TWEEK
Aahh!
CARTMAN
It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!
TWEEK
You see?? First we were just forming a club, now we have to make hats! When does it end??
STAN
Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats. [walks off with Cartman and Kyle screen right]
TWEEK
Fifty hats? Oh Jesus! [runs off screen left]
[Tweek's house, later. He's at his desk in his room frantically making paper hats. His mug of coffee sits off to his left.]
TWEEK
Ah! I'll never make it! I'll never make it! [his father happens by and notices the commotion]
RICHARD
[approaching with his own mug] Tweek!
TWEEK
[shrieks] Hrrr!
RICHARD
Calm down, son. Remember what Dr. Norris told you. Find your center.
TWEEK
My center. My... center. [closes his eyes and cups his chest] Calm. [enters a state of meditation. Richard turns and leaves, his cup stays] Puppies. [he finds himself sitting in the Lotus position by the side of a serene stream in a lovely meadow. All kinds of animals frolic around him, and a small Buddhist temple sits in the background]
CARTMAN
[enormous face appearing over the clouds] Tweek! [brushes the clouds away with his hands] TWEEK!! [Tweek opens his eyes] TWEEK!!
TWEEK
[comes out of his meditation] Gaaaaah!
CARTMAN
How many hats have you made?
TWEEK
Oh God!
CARTMAN
We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow! [slaps him hard across the back.] Get the lead out!
TWEEK
Aaaah! Oh God! [Cartman turns and walks out, a rattled Tweek resumes making the hats.]
[South Park Elementary gymnasium, next day. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman stand outside the doors waiting for Tweek, who rushes up to them with a box of hats. A poster behind them seems to have fallen off the wall.]
TWEEK
You guys, we have a big problem!
STAN
What?
TWEEK
I was up, all night, making hats. I only slept for an hour, ...and then I dreamt about making hats, but I only made fifteen!
KYLE
Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough.
STAN
Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet. [turns and opens the door, then peeks in. The place is packed. All the bleachers are filled, and there are five rows of people standing on the gym floor. He backs out, closes the door, and turns to his friends] Dude, there's like a thousand people in there!
TWEEK
A thousand? [freaks out] Oh Jesus man! I don't have nearly a thousand hats!
CARTMAN
They're gonna kick your ass, Tweek!
TWEEK
Goohoo!
KYLE
[steps forward] Tweek! It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats.
CROWD
[from inside the gym] Free hat! [Kyle turns right, then left, not believing what he's hearing. Tweek's jaw drops] Free hat! Free hat!
TWEEK
["Free hat!"] Oh God!
CARTMAN
["Free hat! Free hat! Free hat! Free hat!"] I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat.
CROWD
Free hat! Free hat!
TWEEK
I gotta move away, you guys!
STAN
Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats.
[The school gym, inside. The crowd jumps up and cheers as the four boys enter and climb onstage. Some of the signs they hold read "FREE HAT," "FREEDOM FOR HAT NOW!," and "HAT DIDN'T DO IT".]
STAN
[takes the mic] Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause.
CROWD
Yeah! Yeah!
STAN
Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone. [the cheering dies down and a voice pipes up]
SKEETER
Eh- Excuse me?
CARTMAN
[takes the mic] Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn't make enough of them.
TWEEK
Oh! Jesus! Don't tell them it was me!
WOMAN
[a blonde] We don't care about that.
TWEEK
You don't?
STAN
You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?
SKEETER
Yeah. Free Hat.
TWEEK
What?
MAN
Hat McCullough. He was sent to prison in '82, and we believe he should be released!
MAN 2
Yeah!
CROWD
Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
STAN
Aaaah, ["Free Ha-"], okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors? [the crowd stops moving]
MAN
To do what?
KYLE
We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers...
SKEETER
Oh. Sorry. Um, come on, everyone, guess we're in the wrong place. [the crowd breaks up and exits]
CROWD
Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
STAN
Waitwaitwaitwait! [the crowd stops] Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference!
SKEETER
Can't we also work towards freeing Hat?
STAN
Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat.
SOME PEOPLE
Oh yeeaahhh!! Raaaaah!! Woohoo!!
CROWD
Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
[Stan's house, later. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman sit at the dining room table, with Stan counting the sign-ups.]
STAN
...212, 213, 214 members!
TWEEK
[barges in through the front door] You guys! You guys! Oh God! Um, I've got terrible news!
KYLE
What?
TWEEK
Ted Koppel wants us to appear on Nightline to talk about our cause.
STAN
Really? That's great.
KYLE
Yah.
TWEEK
No it isn't, man! Thahat's waaay too much pressure!
STAN
If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films.
CARTMAN
But just remember that I do all the talking.
KYLE
You?? Why?
CARTMAN
Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it.
STAN
When did we do dibs for it?
CARTMAN
Just now - [quickly, counting off with his left hand] 1 2 3 dibs! [punches his right palm with his left fist]
KYLE
Me.
TWEEK
Ga-ahah!
KYLE
Alright, fine! [points to Cartman] You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up!
CARTMAN
What could possibly go wrong?
[Nightline. Ted Koppel is at his desk with the four boys in the inset over his left shoulder.]
TED KOPPEL
A new movement is sweeping the country, led by four determined boys from South Park, Colorado. The organization was created to protect Hollywood's classic films from the hands of their directors. And also to free Hat McCullough. So boys, I ask you the question that's on everyone's minds, why does your organization want to free Hat McCullough, the convicted, confessed serial murderer of twenty-three babies?
CARTMAN
[blinks and looks at the camera for a long time] ...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek. [the camera moves from Cartman to Tweek]
TWEEK
Gaaarh!
TED KOPPEL
Well, Hat McCullough admitted he killed those toddlers? Why do you want him free?
TWEEK
["TWEEK, ADVOCATE OF TODDLER MURDER" appears at the bottom of the screen] Oh, Jesus, man! ...N'ahah!
TED KOPPEL
Just answer me this, Tweek: What do you see as "positive" about toddler murder?
TWEEK
Ahah. U-uh. It's easy?
TED KOPPEL
[ponders the possibility] Yes... It is easy. [switches gears] Alright, then on to your other cause, saving films from their directors. What got you boys interested in this, especially given your pro-toddler-murder status?
KYLE
We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.
TED KOPPEL
Well I'm glad you said that, boys, because joining us now are Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. [they walk in and stand behind the boys. The boys look at them a bit awed]
TWEEK
Oh Christ! Wwwaaaaaaah!
STEVEN SPIELBERG
[wearing a CSLB jacket and director's hat] Hello, Ted.
GEORGE LUCAS
[meekly] Oh hi, Ted.
TED KOPPEL
Gentlemen, these toddler-murder fans think you're insane and shouldn't be allowed to alter your films. Your response?
STEVEN SPIELBERG
Well, first of all, both George and I are very firmly against the murdering of toddlers.
GEORGE LUCAS
Hear hear.
CARTMAN
[to Stan] Dude, that's Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. [resumes gawking at the two]
TWEEK
Get me out of here! Please, somebody get me out of heeerre!
STEVEN SPIELBERG
And as for altering our films, all we're doing is trying to reach a... new audience with our movies. As the makers of dreams, we like to speak ...for the children.
KYLE
Ah, we thought we were speaking for the children.
CARTMAN
Yeah, we're children.
STAN
Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?
CARTMAN
Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted.
TED KOPPEL
How so?
CARTMAN
Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?
GEORGE LUCAS
I'm not a Jew! [crosses his arms in anger]
STEVEN SPIELBERG
You little brat-! Ah, I mean, you darling children don't know what you're talking about. Changing E.T. was the best thing I ever did.
KYLE
Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark!
STEVEN SPIELBERG
[a stroke of brilliance overcomes the two men for a few seconds] Wait a minute. What'd you say?
GEORGE LUCAS
Eh, that's brilliant!
STEVEN SPIELBERG
Yes. Change Raiders of the Lost Ark! Why didn't we think of it before?!
KYLE
[regretting the comparison] No. NOO!!
[South Park Elementary School Gym, next day. "SAVE FILMS FROM THEIR DIRECTORS AND FREE HAT MEETING TODAY." The boys stand before the new club once again.]
STAN
Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark. [the crowd begins to murmur] There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary? [hands the mic to Cartman, who moves over to an easel]
CARTMAN
Thank you. [turns a page up and over. A schematic of George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch is shown] Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to Raiders of the Lost Ark is currently somewhere in George Lucas's house. We need to find and usurp that negative.
MAN 3
And if we get a hold of the negative they can't change the movie?
STAN
That is our understanding.
WOMAN
Sounds like a good idea to me. I don't want them to change Raiders of the Lost Ark.
CROWD
YEAH!
SKEETER
Yeah! We should go get that negative as soon as we get Hat free!
CROWD
YEAH! [the signs go up] Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
KYLE
[rushes to the mic] Nonono! We need to do this first.
WOMAN
But we have to free Hat.
STAN
It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies.
MAN 4
Well yeah, but it was in self-defense!
CROWD
YEAH!
CARTMAN
He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?
SKEETER
Hat was attacked maliciously and unprovoked by a gang of babies in West Town Park. When that many babies get together they can be like piranha.
MAN 5
Three eyewitnesses testified that if Hat hadn't killed those babies, they'd have killed him!
CROWD
YEAH! [the signs go up] Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
STAN
Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raiders.
SKEETER
He's right. We'd better split up. Some of you go with the boys and get those film prints, the rest of us come with me to go talk to the governor about freeing Hat.
CROWD
YEAH! [the signs go up and the crowd moves out. Not one of them stays with the boys] Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
STAN
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves.
TWEEK
No! That's it! I'm out! I can't deal with the stress you guys create! [walks off the stage]
KYLE
We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?
TWEEK
Hwaaah!
CARTMAN
[rushes up to stop Tweek] Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You've been our new friend now for two weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest with you, it isn't going well.
TWEEK
Haaah!
CARTMAN
People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?
[Skywalker Ranch, night. Inside the camera gets a view of Lucas's library. Among the items there are various props from his Star Wars films, four Emmys, four Oscars... the door opens and a flashlight scans the room. Stan, holding the flashlight, walks in with the other boys.]
STAN
Okay, go. [the other boys, with their own flashlights, pour in]
TWEEK
[trying to stay composed, with eyes closed] I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm in a green field.
CARTMAN
[draws near] Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity! [walks off]
KYLE
[eyeing a prop] This looks like the right room.
TWEEK
I'm in a field... surrounded by deer.
STAN
[finding the video library] Over here! [the other boys join him at the stacks. They see "Star Wars Episode 1, Version 300," "Star Wars Episode 1, Version 301," "Star Wars Episode 1, Version 302," etc., then "First Day of School" and "First Day of School, Digitally Enhanced," then "Wedding Video" and "Wedding Video, Digitally Enhanced." The camera scans past "Kids First Swimming Lesson" and "Kids First Swimming Lesson w/ Digitally Enhanced Weather" to stop at the reel of "Raiders of the Lost Ark, Original Negative 1982."]
KYLE
That's it!
CARTMAN
Alriiight! Get it, Tweek!
TWEEK
Huh uh.
CARTMAN
Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it!
TWEEK
Guh huh huh! [walks off and returns with a stool. He climbs up on it and gets the reel canister. The door opens behind the boys and the lights go on]
GEORGE LUCAS
What are you doing?! [the boys turn in horror]
TWEEK
Oh God! Oh Jesus!
GEORGE LUCAS
You're the boys from that ...stupid club. Give me that! [grabs the film reel from Tweek]
TWEEK
[hops off the stool] Aaaaaah!
KYLE
Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas! [goes down on his right knee] But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark.
GEORGE LUCAS
We're gonna make it better. The movie's gonna be changed, and that's that!
CARTMAN
Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B.
STAN
Aw, really?
TWEEK
Oh God, no! Not Plan B! [Lucas looks at the boys quzzically]
CARTMAN
[beat] You have a heart made of ice, Mr. Lucas, and so we're goin' tuh melt your icy heart... with a cool island song. Gentlemen? [the boys reach for the left side of their bodies and rip off their clothes. Underneath they wear colorful Latin outfits and grin.]
GEORGE LUCAS
[confused] ...What??
CARTMAN
Hit it, Tweek! [Tweek goes over to a boombox and presses the play button, then returns to the group. Caribbean music plays] In the tropical isles with the coconut trees, there's a lots of-
STAN
Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.
CARTMAN
...No, he has an icy heart.
KYLE
...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, r-tard.
STAN
So we have to warm his icy heart with a "hot" island song.
CARTMAN
It's a cool island song.
KYLE
Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.
CARTMAN
Oh, do we wanna do that?
GEORGE LUCAS
ALRIGHT, that does it!
[Skywalker Ranch, day, Lucas's living room. The boys stand behind Lucas as he talks on the phone with someone.]
GEORGE LUCAS
[listening] Yes, thank you, officer. [hangs up and walks around the boys] The police are on their way, boys. [stops and faces them] Soon you'll be in jail getting RAMMED!
TWEEK
[freaks out] Aaaahh!
STAN
Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films. [Lucas looks at them]
KYLE
It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is. [Lucas hangs his head in shame and turns away]
GEORGE LUCAS
It is... too late for me, boys.
KYLE
You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.
GEORGE LUCAS
M-that's different. These are my movies. I made them, and I have the right to do whatever I want with them.
STAN
[steps forward] You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours.
KYLE
When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society.
GEORGE LUCAS
Have I... become so old that I've forgetten what being an artist is about?
STAN
Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.
GEORGE LUCAS
[turns and approaches them] Perhaps... you are right. [presents the reel to Stan, but a door opens...]
A VOICE
STOP! [Lucas is startled and the camera pans to Steven Spielberg and three guards] What are you doing, George?!
GEORGE LUCAS
Steven, Uh, I-
STEVEN SPIELBERG
Give me that print, George! We need to make the alterations!
GEORGE LUCAS
Steven, these boys had a point. I don't remember what it was, but it was good.
STEVEN SPIELBERG
You haven't let these doe-eyed children affect your judgment, have you, George?! [voice lowers] Don't forget: you belong to me.
KYLE
Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film! [Lucas, stuck between the two arguments, stops and thinks...]
GEORGE LUCAS
I'm... ah I'm sorry, boys. [slowly walks to Spielberg and presents the reel. Spielberg snatches it away]
STEVEN SPIELBERG
[cackles] Now take the children prisoner! [the guards approach and surround the boys]
KYLE
What??
STEVEN SPIELBERG
You troublemakers shall be my guests of honor at the premiere of the NEW Raiders of the Lost Ark! Your gay little club is over!
STAN
Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys! [the boys turn and make their way to the door]
TWEEK
[runs] Oh my God they're gonna kill us. [the guards block the way, and the other three boys are stuck. Kyle tries to get around a guard, but...]
GUARD 1
[aims his walkie-talkie at him] Don't even think about it, kid! I'm not afraid to use this walkie-talkie!
GUARD 2
The one with the cocaine-problem escaped, mein Direktor.
STEVEN SPIELBERG
Leave him!! Let him run back to his mommy! [strokes the reel canister] We must get the film ready for the premiere. [turns and walks off] Lucas! Come! [Lucas, shame-faced, turns and follows Spielberg out. The boys look at the guards]
[A commercial.]
ANNOUNCER
["COMING THIS SUMMER"] Coming, this summer! ["RE-RELEASE OF EPISODE 1 SOUTHPARK"] It's the digitally-re-enhanced re-release of the very first pilot episode of South Park! [scenes from "Cartman Gets An Anal Probe" play - the cafeteria, the boys walking down the street, Stan, Kyle, and Wendy in the woods, Stan and Kyle at Stark's Pond...] Yes, the classic, rough, hand-made first episode is getting a make-over for 2002! [the visitors are shown, then new 3D versions are shown] The simple, funny aliens are now super-badass and kewl! [the mothership is shown beaming Cartman up, then a much more intricate version is shown] The flying saucer? No longer cheap construction paper, but a 4.0 megapixel nondrop digital masterpiece of technology! Yes! Everything's new! New is better!
TREY PARKER
[bearded] When we first made South Park, we didn't wanna use construction paper. We just had to because it was cheap.
MATT STONE
And now with new technology we can finally remaster South Park, make it look sharp, clean and focused.
TREY PARKER
Expensive. [Both men nod their heads]
ANNOUNCER
[The flames coming from Cartman's ass are replaced with a 3D version, and cars and people are added to the scene] Yes, all the charm of the simple little cartoon [a model of the new ship is rotated to a new position] will melt before your eyes as it is replaced by newer and more standardized animation!
TREY PARKER
[a shot of him, then of the bus stop with the boys waiting for the bus. New creatures enter the scene] For instance, in the scene at the bus stop, we always meant to have Imperial walkers and giant dewback lizards in the background, but simply couldn't afford it.
ANNOUNCER
[A special-edition DVD of CGAAP "new version for 2002" is shown. "ACT NOW" blinks on the screen over the DVD] Get this special enhanced version quick, because another enhanced version will likely be coming out for 2003!
[School Gym, sometime later. "URGENT" in white has been scrawled over the sign next to the door. Tweek stands onstage inside, facing the gathered club.]
TWEEK
Members, uuhh, oh Jesus, uh, we have to do something! Our club president [Stan], treasurer [Kyle], and secretary [Cartman] have all been taken hostage by Steven Spielberg! Haaa!
MAN 3
Prisoner? You mean, like Hat?
TWEEK
[grits his teeth, shuts his eyes and bows his head in frustration] Yes, just like Hat!!
SKEETER
But the governor won't pardon Hat. So how can we get him out of prison? [the other members grumble]
TWEEK
No! Listen to me! We're not talking about Hat right now, okay?! Gad!! Look, we went to George Lucas's house a-and tried to melt his icy heart with a warm island song, but then Spielberg showed up and took three of our members prisoner! They're goin' to premiere their new Raiders of the Lost Ark, and we have to rescue them! Do you understand?!
WOMAN
Hey, he's got a point there.
MAN 6
[a rancher] Yeah... Maybe we could melt the governor's icy heart with a cool island song!
MEMBERS
[scattered reaction] Yeah.
TWEEK
No!
SKEETER
No?
MAN 7
No! He's right. We have to freeze his hot heart with a cool island song.
WOMAN
Or is it freshen his hot temper with a cool island song?
MAN 8
Let's cool his hot temper with a fresh island song.
MAN 9
That's it!
MAN 10
Let's go! Come on! [the members rally and take off]
TWEEK
Oh God. I'm gonna have to do this myself. Oh God!
[Excess Hollywood. Raiders of the Lost Ark is featured.]
PAT O'BRIEN
Well, the print is finished and the day has come. Tonight, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas [shown] will be at the premiere of the new special edition of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Lots of celebrity guests and other rich people will be on hand to witness all the updated effects and modernized technology.
[A desert. Spielberg leads a group of people to the site of the premiere. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are among the guests, but their hands are tied behind their backs. Four people follow carrying a large box from two long poles. The box reads "FINAL PRINT RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK 2002" The three guards are there with Spielberg and Lucas, and Francis Ford Coppola has joined the lead pack. The camera follows the group, but slowly pulls back until Tweek appears with a bazooka on his shoulder.]
TWEEK
Hello!
STEVEN SPIELBERG
[moves forward and takes a hard look at the figure on the hill] The kid? The tweaked out kid?!
TWEEK
I'm gonna blow up the print, Spielberg! [the other boys try to sneak away, but the guards are around them quickly]
STEVEN SPIELBERG
Your pesistence surprises even me. [begins to fan himself with his hat]
FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA
[steps forward] Surely you don't think you can escape from this premiere.
TWEEK
[fixes his aim on his target] That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want are my friends.
CARTMAN
Wow.
TWEEK
Except for Cartman - you can keep him.
CARTMAN
AY!
FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA
And if we refuse?
TWEEK
Then your premiere has no movie!
STAN
He's definitely lost it.
KYLE
Yup.
STEVEN SPIELBERG
[moves around to clear the area] Okay, okay. Stan- stand back, stand ba- stand back! Back! [people move away] Okay kid, you win. [puts on his hat] Blow it up. [some guards try to get the box, but Spielberg takes a walkie-talkie and forces them back] Zuroch! Zuroch! [turns and faces Tweek] Blow it back to God. [Tweek trembles, but his aim doesn't waver] All your life has been the pursuit of seeing a great film! This new version of Raiders has digital effects beyond your wildest dreams! You want to see it screened just as much as I. [Tweek grunts, showing he may be breaking]
KYLE
Come on, Tweek! Blow it up!
STEVEN SPIELBERG
[turns, walks to the box, and stands next to it] Son, we are simply passing through history. This... is imPROVED history. [Tweek stalls. The boys wait for Tweek's next move] Do as you will. [backs away, leaving the box clear. Tweek struggles, but lowers the launcher. Three guards appear behind him]
[The governor's office, day. The governor is at his desk, bored. The Free Hat club members break out in song.]
MEMBERS
In the tropical isles with the coconut trees, the air is fresh and the people are free.
MAN 5
But here in the mountains there's no freedom like that.
SKEETER
There's a man in prison and his name is Hat. [the governor looks up a bit surprised]
[A sign saying "RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK Premiere Tonight" has alternating blinking lights. The camera moves off the sign and onto the makeshift open-air theater. Two men bring forth the Ark of the Covenant, which was in the box. The men move off. The audience is seen, with the four boys in the very back. Stan and Kyle are tied to one post, Tweek and Cartman to the other. Spielberg, dressed as a High Priest, approaches the Ark.]
STEVEN SPIELBERG
[moving his arms over the Ark] Hafaa malifi! Thanks for coming, everyone. [the two men return, remove the lid, and walk off with it. A third man reaches inside the Ark and pulls out the "RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK NEW AND IMPROVED 2002" reel] This is the birth of the NEW version of Raiders of the Lost Ark! We shall screen it here, and then destroy all the old prints in celebration!
AUDIENCE
Hooray! All right!
STEVEN SPIELBERG
Begin the film! [a man loads the film and plays it. On screen, three men appear and approach a mountain]
AUDIENCE
[impressed] Whoa.
STAN
[pleading] You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it.
TWEEK
Ah, what?!
STAN
[pleading] Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes! [the boys quickly turn away, shut their eyes, and bow their heads]
AUDIENCE
[impressed] Whoa. Ahhh.
STEVEN SPIELBERG
It's beyooootiful. [a scene of Indiana Jones using a whip to swing across a chasm. Flaming arrows shoot past him. As he lands on the other side, natives approach. They look and chatter like Ewoks]
VIEWER 1
Wait a minute. This version is awful!
VIEWER 2
Yeah! They ruined it!
VIEWER 3
Oh my God, it's terrible! [George Lucas is suddenly frightened stiff. Coppola is also frightened. The boys keep their eyes closed and away from the screen]
GEORGE LUCAS
AaaaAAAAA!!
[The three men huddle, frightened as they are. On screen, Indy is reaching for a golden item. Rays of light alight from the screen and move out over the audience, shooting through the viewers' chests and killing them. Coppola, Lucas, and Spielberg are overwhelmed with the energy from the rays. The men become disfigured, then their faces melt away. Spielberg's head explodes. The rays diffuse, then gather back into the Ark. The spirits of all killed are gathered into the Ark as well. The lid lands on the Ark perfectly with a final roll of thunder. A few second laters, when all is quiet, Stan raises his head and looks around.]
STAN
Yuh, you guys okay. [the others open their eyes. The ropes that bound them are gone]
KYLE
Yeah. I I think so.
CARTMAN
Man, that new version must have sucked balls.
[South Park, day. A celebration is taking place at South Park Square. An orchestra performs below the stage. The boys are onstage watching it all. A man, a mayor's aide, walks up to the mic.]
AIDE
Today is a day of celebration, and we owe it all to these four brave young boys. [The four boys grin]
TOWNSMAN
Yeah! Alright!
AIDE
And thanks to the bravery of this young man in particular, [Tweek smiles proudly] ...Hat McCullough is finally free from prison! [the smiles fade from the boys' faces]
TOWNSFOLK
Yeah! Woohoohoo!
KYLE
...What? [a thin balding man with creepy appearance walks onstage and waves to everyone]
TOWNSFOLK
Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat!
HAT MCCULLOUGH
Thank you everyone-KILL! KILL THE INNOCENT!! Uh, I'm so thankful for all your support-RAPE THE VIRGINS!! And uh, I just wonder if i could get a baby real quick? [grins in a creepy way. The crowd falls silent for a moment]
SKEETER
Sure. Give that man a baby!
TOWNSFOLK
Yeah! Woohoohoo! [the aide comes onstage holding a baby in his arms. Hat looks at the baby sinisterly. The baby senses this and quickly crawls up the aide's arm and onto his shoulder]
STAN
Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. [the boys turn and walk off. Tweek can't help but look at the baby's fate]
TWEEK
Oh my God!
[South Park, day. The boys walk away from the celebration and down the street.]
KYLE
Do you think we did a good thing, Stan? [the boys stop] I mean, no one even seemed to notice.
STAN
Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world.
CARTMAN
That and youth. Those guys are old.
TWEEK
But what about the original prints of Raiders of the Lost Ark? What if somebody else takes them and tries to change them?
STAN
Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it.
[A secret warehouse. Someone packs all the original prints of Raiders of the Lost Ark into a large box. He nails the box shut and adds a lock. He puts the box on a dolly and carts it off down a long corridor. On each side are other boxes and crates of stuff put there so as not to cause any more harm to anyone. Among the stuff in the warehouse - RED CROSS 9/11 Relief Funds. Dramatic music plays the episode out.]

script:Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society

[Cartman's house, morning. Stan, Kyle, and Tweek show up. Stan rings the doorbell. Liane comes to the door.]
LIANE
Oh, hello boys.
STAN
Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again.
LIANE
Oh, but I thought your teacher died.
KYLE
She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay.
LIANE
Oh. Well, I'll tell Eric. He's just down in the basement playing with his dolls. [turns and walks off]
TWEEK
Cartman likes to play with dolls?
[Cartman's basement. He's playing with a rubber lamb at the edge of a hole in the floor.]
CARTMAN
[strokes the lamb and sets it aside] Hello, Precious. Yes, that's a good Precious. [grabs a basket with a bottle of lotion sitting inside and lowers it down the hole. The basket stops when it reaches Polly Prissy Pants, which sits at the bottom of the hole] Now it takes the lotion from the basket.
POLLY PRISSY PANTS
[Cartman voicing] Oh please, mister. Please let me out of here.
CARTMAN
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
PRECIOUS
[Cartman voicing] Bark bark bark bark!
CARTMAN
Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket.
POLLY PRISSY PANTS
Please, mister, let me out.
CARTMAN
It puts the lotion back in the basket!
POLLY PRISSY PANTS
I miss my mom, mister. I wanna see my-
CARTMAN
[throws a fit] Put the lotion in the fucking basket!
LIANE
Sweetie.
CARTMAN
Yes, mom?
LIANE
You have to get ready for school.
CARTMAN
[thinks a bit, then looks up] No, our teacher's dead. Remember?
LIANE
Yes, but they said two weeks off was enough, and they want everyone back.
CARTMAN
[pause] Two weeks isn't enough. I'm not over our teacher's tragic death. I'm still sh-shooken up.
LIANE
You'll get over it, honey.
CARTMAN
[starts to throw another fit] But I wanna plaaayyy!
[South Park Elementary, Fourth Grade. The kids pour into the classroom, chattering. Wendy walks up and starts talking to Red and Annie.]
WENDY
I can't believe it's been two weeks since I've seen you guys. What have you been doing? [Bebe walks in]
BEBE
Hey guys.
WENDY
Hey Bebe.
BEBE
You guys, uh, [holds out her arms] notice anything different? [looks down at her body]
WENDY
[the three girls gaze] Oh my God, Bebe. You got boobs!
BEBE
Yeah, they started coming in last week. At first I thought they were just mosquito bites, but, then they didn't go away.
MR. MACKEY
[enters the classroom and walks past the girls] M'kay, kids, let's take our seats, m'kay? [the girls take their seats] I know this has been a difficult couple o'weeks for you all with the untimely death of your teacher, but it's time for us to try to move on and learn, m'kay?
CARTMAN
Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?
MR. MACKEY
No. Eric, what we're gonna do is learn to hide our emotions with math problems. [turns, grabs some chalk, and starts writing on the board] M'kay, so let's start with some multiplication tables over here, m'kay. First we'll do, uh, four times four, m'kay?
KYLE
Dude, look at Bebe. ["We'll move into the five times thing." Bebe is busy taking notes. "We'll try five times three..."] Something seems different about her.
STAN
Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?
KYLE
I don't know. [Bebe continues writing]
CLYDE
Hey, Tolkien. You know, I never really noticed before, but that girl Bebe is... kinda cool.
TOLKIEN
I was just thinking the same thing. It's like, she's a girl, but, she's someone you could hang out with.
BUTTERS
[pipes up behind Annie] Yeah. Bebe is kinda cool, huh? [Bebe continues writing]
CARTMAN
Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?
CRAIG
I don't know. Why?
CARTMAN
It just... it just seems like a really awesome shirt.
CRAIG
Yeah. It kinda does. [Bebe continues writing, but stops and looks to her right. All the boys are looking at her, all the girls look at the board.]
MR. MACKEY
Okay, and so uh, [Bebe is looking back, wondering why the boys keep staring at her] so who can tell me the answer to the first problem, six times eight? Uh, Bebe?
BEBE
[breaks the stare and answers] Oh, uh, forty-eight?
ALL THE BOYS
Whoa.
CLYDE
That is an awesome answer!
ALL THE BOYS
Yeah!
KYLE
Dude! Bebe is really smart!
STAN
Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.
CARTMAN
Yeah, may be.
[South Park Elementary, later. Three girls walk to class: Wendy, Bebe, and Red. Wendy is talking.]
WENDY
...But I was like, "I'm not buying those shoes for twenty dollars." [the girls stop and giggle]
STAN
[arriving with a group of boys: Kyle, Cartman, Tolkien, Butters, Tweek, and Clyde] Ah, hey, Bebe.
BEBE
Yeah?
STAN
Uh, we're gonna go throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us.
BEBE
Really? [Wendy and Red look at her] I've never done that before.
BUTTERS
[Stan and Kyle part a bit for a better view] Wuuhh, it's really fun. You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me.
KYLE
Yeah, it's cool.
BEBE
Well sure, that sounds hella fun.
THE BOYS
Hahahahahaha...
KYLE
Yeah.
STAN
Hella fun.
CARTMAN
Right, heh.
CLYDE
Wow, hella fun. That's awesome.
TOLKIEN
I'm gonna start saying that now.
STAN
Cool. [the boys turn as one and walk back the way they came] We'll see you later, Bebe.
WENDY
[Wendy catches up to Stan. The boys are grinning. Stan stops and looks] Stan, you've never asked me to throw rocks at cars with you guys.
STAN
That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool. [turns and walks off]
KYLE
[looks over his shoulder] Yeah. She's really cool. [Wendy gets upset]
CLYDE
It's weird how we never noticed before. [Wendy looks back at Bebe, who just shrugs]
[A hill just outside of town. The boys and Bebe are gathered at the summit.]
STAN
So what you do, see, is you wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing. [he throws a rock towards the road and the others look at the trajectory. A blue pick-up truck drives by and is hit]
DRIVER
You damn kids!
BEBE
Cool.
CLYDE
You try it, Bebe.
BEBE
Okay.
TOLKIEN
Here comes a sedan. [Bebe throws a rock at the red sedan and hits it]
DRIVER
You damn kids!
THE BOYS
Awesome!
BUTTERS
Cool! [close up] That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen.
KYLE
That was sweet, Bebe. [shows her another rock and another grip] Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you-
CLYDE
Yeah. [grabs a hold of the rock and pulls it a bit] Here, it's like if you put your thumb on this side-
KYLE
[pulls back] I'm showing her.
CLYDE
[pulls back] Yeah, just let me show her real quick how to put the thumb and-
KYLE
[gives an ape look and smacks Clyde, who lets go of the rock] Hoh!
CLYDE
[grunts back and moves off] Hoh hoh hoh! [Bebe is stunned at this development]
KYLE
Hoh! [watches, then reverts to normal and talks to Bebe. Stan moves in] Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and-
STAN
[grabs the rock and demonstrates] Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now-
KYLE
[peeved] Hoh! Hoh hoh hoh hoh! [Bebe backs up, scared]
STAN
Hoh hoh hoh!
KYLE
Hah hah hah!
CRAIG
[beats his chest] Urh urh urh! [all the boys start grunting and displaying aggression]
BEBE
Uh. Listen guys, um, it's five-thirty. I'm supposed to get home, so... I'll see you later. [leaves. The boys continue grunting and putting on displays. She walks faster the farther she moves from the boys. The boys notice her absence and stop.]
STAN
[beat] ...Wait, what were we doing again?
KYLE
We were throwing rocks at cars.
THE BOYS
Oh yeah.
CARTMAN
Woohoo.
BUTTERS
[points] Uh there comes an SUV. [Tolkien throws a rock and hits the SUV]
JIMBO
You damn kids!
[South Park Elementary, next day. The kids are in their seats. Bebe is the last kid to enter class and find a seat.]
THE BOYS
Hi, Bebe.
BEBE
Hey everybody.
WENDY
[rolls her eyes and rests her head on her right hand] Oh, for Christ's sake!
MR. MACKEY
[arriving, puts his textbooks on the teacher's desk] M'kay. Kids, yesterday I asked you to write a paper to read aloud for the class. Now, who wants to start? [Clyde raises his hand] M'kay, Clyde?
CLYDE
[picks up his paper and starts] My paper is called, "Why Bebe is the coolest person, ever".
STAN
Hey, that's what I wrote about!
BUTTERS
Me too!
CLYDE
[grunts] Hoh!
STAN
[grunts and pounds his desk] Hah hah, hah! [the other boys start grunting like apes]
MR. MACKEY
Uuuuh-okay. Go ahead, Clyde.
CLYDE
[glowers at Stan, then reads] "My friend Bebe is really smart. She tells funny jokes and knows a lot about stuff. She's good at almost everything she tries. She's awesome. The end." [some applause]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, very nice, Clyde. Uh, Tolkien, why don't you read your paper?
TOLKIEN
[picks up his paper and reads] "If I could be Bebe." [Wendy is miffed and rolls her eyes] "If I was Bebe, I would have lots of friends because I would be sooo great. I would make people smile and think wherever I went."
MR. MACKEY
[takes a moment to think, then] M'kay, interesting, Tolkien. Uh... Who would like to go next? [the rest of the boys raise their hands energetically and make small sounds to get Mackey's attention] Uh, how about someone who didn't write about how cool Bebe is?
THE BOYS
[softly] Oh. [they lower their hands. Bebe raises hers]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, Bebe?
BEBE
[picks up her paper and reads] "My cat Thumper."
THE BOYS
Wwooww.
BEBE
[sees the reaction and continues reading] "Thumper is gray with a white spot. Sometimes he likes to chase his tail." [the boys break out in laughter]
CLYDE
Chase his tail? That must be so funny!
BEBE
"Thumper is twelve years old. That's pretty old for a cat. The end."
THE BOYS
Wwooww!
CARTMAN
God, you know what? That's so true. Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone.
CRAIG
That's true, huh? Man, that really makes me reflect on my pets.
STAN
That's such a great paper! [starts clapping. The other boys join in the applause]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay. Wendy, why don't we hear your paper?
WENDY
[picks up her paper and reads] "The new Cold War."
CARTMAN
Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert! [the boys crack up]
[South Park Elementary cafeteria. Wendy is talking to Red, Millie, and Esther.]
WENDY
But, then the mall closes at four or five o'clock, so who knows w-
CLYDE
[arrives with Kyle, Tolkien, Craig, Bradley, and Francis] Hey, have any of you dumb girls seen Bebe anywhere?
WENDY
[angrily] No!
KYLE
Maybe she's in the lunch line.
THE BOYS
Yeah.
WENDY
Can you believe Bebe? She thinks she's so cool all of a sudden.
MILLIE
I can't stand her anymore! She's such a slut!
ESTHER
She's a total slut!
RED
You know what I heard? I heard that she made out with eight different boys in one minute.
MILLIE
I heard that she lifted her shirt to the boys at the bus stop.
WENDY
I heard that her asshole is like this big around. [makes a hole with her hands, thumb touching thumb, the other fingers touching their counterparts on the other hand]
MILLIE, ESTHER
Wwooww.
BEBE
[comes into view] Hey guys.
WENDY
Oh, hey Bebe. [fakes a clearing throat] Slut. [again] Slut.
MILLIE
[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
ESTHER
[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
MILLIE
[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
BEBE
...You guys still wanna go ice-skating after school?
WENDY
Oh, no, that's okay Bebe. You might trip and then we'd be sucked into your huge gaping vagina like ants into a vacuum cleaner. [fakes a clearing throat] Slut. [again] Slut.
MILLIE
[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
ESTHER
[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
RED
[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
WENDY
Slut.
MILLIE
[fakes a clearing throat] Slut. [the girls take their trays and leave, giggling]
GIRLS
[out of view] Whore. Slut. Slut.
[Bebe's house, after school. She's looking out over the neighborhood from her bedroom window, looking sad. Her mother stops by her door and looks in.]
MRS. STEVENS
Bebe, is something the matter?
BEBE
[turns and faces her mom] Oh Mom, it's just... My girlfriends at school said some really mean things to me today. [faces the window again and rests her head on her right hand] They called me a "slut with a huge gaping vagina".
MRS. STEVENS
[approaches] Oh, sweetie. You're all just growing up. [begins to stroke Bebe's hair] Part of being a woman is having a friend one day and calling her a slut the next.
BEBE
But am I slutty just because I'm starting to be friends with guys? I mean, they just like me because they think I'm smart and cool.
MRS. STEVENS
I remember when I was a little girl the boys didn't think I was very smart at all. But then one day, they all started thinking I was really smart. I guess big smarts just run in our family.
BEBE
Well if the girls don't wanna be my friends, that's fine! [rests her head on her hands] Guys are way cooler, anyways.
[King Jimmy's Buffet, night. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman sit at a booth eating hamburgers and some side dishes.]
TWEEK
[arrives] You... guys wanted me to meet you here?
CARTMAN
Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk.
TWEEK
[sits next to Cartman] Oh God.
CARTMAN
[offers Tweek his plate] Alright guys, now that we're all here, I think... we need to have a difficult conversation. It's obvious that Bebe is like the coolest, smartest, most awesome person we've ever met.
STAN, KYLE
True.
STAN
Yeah.
KYLE
Yep.
CARTMAN
And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process.
KYLE
Right.
STAN
Uh huh.
CARTMAN
And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend.
KYLE
Yeah.
STAN
That would be best.
CARTMAN
Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you.
KYLE
Huh??
STAN
Kyle??
CARTMAN
And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you and some peanuts. [presents the watch and peanuts]
KYLE
Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning!
CARTMAN
And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip.
STAN
Dude, we're not kicking Kyle out!
CARTMAN
Pleeeeease???
STAN
No!
CARTMAN
[removes the watch and peanuts] Alright, fine! So then, I guess we have no choice but to let you go, Tweek. But we want you to know that it's been really fun. Here's a watch and some peanuts. [presents the watch and peanuts again]
KYLE
No way! Tweek's cool!
STAN
Yeah!
CARTMAN
Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!?
[Bus stop, next day. The answer is shown. Bebe stands between Kyle and Tweek, and Cartman is not present.]
BEBE
Thanks for inviting me to ride the bus to school with you guys.
STAN
Sure thing, Bebe.
CARTMAN
[arrives] That's fine! That's fine!! [sticks up his middle finger] Fuck you, Kyle, and fuck you, Stan! [leaves, then returns, and sticks the middle finger up again] Fuck you, Tweek! [leaves, then returns] Bebe, you're still cool. [leaves again]
[South Park Elementary, hallway. Some boys - Clyde, Butters, Tolkien, Craig, and Pip - are putting up a large poster that reads "Bebe for President" next to the counselor's office. Wendy passes by and stops to look.]
WENDY
What are you doing?!
CLYDE
We're trying to get Bebe to run for class president.
WENDY
I'm class president! The vote was last fall!
CRAIG
Well, yeah, but Wendy, you have to admit, Bebe's a lot smarter and more organized than you.
TOLKIEN
[gushing] Yeah. We need a leader like Bebe. She can teach us all so much.
THE OTHER BOYS
Uh huh.
WENDY
She's not smarter and cooler than everyone, you guys are just drawn to something else! [the boys just look at her]
CLYDE
What?
WENDY
Ugh! God, you guys are sooo stupid! [walks away in a funk]
BUTTERS
[puts his fists on his hips] Stupider than Bebe!
CLYDE
Yeah!
CRAIG
Yeah!
BUTTERS
Huh Bebe's cool, huh. Huh, fellas?
CLYDE
Yeah!
BUTTERS
Yeah!
CRAIG
Sure is!
BUTTERS
Uhyep!
[The neighborhood, after school. Stan, Kyle, and Tweek walk towards Bebe's house.]
KYLE
I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip with Bebe.
STAN
Yeah. [they arrive, but find four other boys arriving at the same time: Timmy, Kevin, Bradley, and Francis] Where are you guys going?
BRADLEY
We're going to see our friend Bebe.
STAN
Bebe is our friend. Didn't you all get the memo?
FRANCIS
Bebe is everybody's friend.
KEVIN
Yeah. God put Bebe on earth to enrich everyone's lives.
STAN
[steps forward and grunts] Hoh!
KYLE
[steps forward and grunts] Hoh hoh hoh!
KEVIN
Arf arf!
FRANCIS
Arf! [a few more grunts are heard]
TIMMY
Arf! Ah Timmah! Timmah-ar-argh!
STAN
Aw alright, I guess we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together. [goes and knocks on the door]
MRS. STEVENS
Oh, hello, boys.
KYLE
Is Bebe home?
MRS. STEVENS
No, she's with one of her little friends. But she should be back shortly if you boys wanna wait.
BRADLEY
Who is she with?
MRS. STEVENS
I believe she is playing "Lambs" over at Eric Cartman's house.
STAN
Cartman's?
[Cartman's basement. He's at his hole again, and Bebe is sitting next to him. He has his basket, lotion, and rubber poodle ready to go.]
CARTMAN
[holds up the poodle] See, and this is Precious.
BEBE
Precious?
CARTMAN
[squeezes the poodle] Bark bark bark. [sets the poodle aside] Okay, so then we put my mom's hand lotion in this little basket [puts the lotion in the basket] and lower it down to Polly Prissy Pants. [the basket descends]
BEBE
[watches the basket drop] Uh huh. [the basket stops once again in front of Polly Prissy Pants]
CARTMAN
Now you say, "It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again."
BEBE
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
CARTMAN
Heheh, yeah.
POLLY PRISSY PANTS
Mister, please let me out of here.
CARTMAN
Now say it again, louder.
BEBE
[louder] It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
CARTMAN
Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket!
POLLY PRISSY PANTS
My parents have money, Mister. They'll give you whatever you want. Please!
CARTMAN
Now, just yell "Put the lotion in the fucking basket!"
BEBE
Put the lotion in the basket!
CARTMAN
Put the lotion in the fucking basket! [pushes the rubber poodle into the hole] Oh no! Precious!
POLLY PRISSY PANTS
I've got your dog, Mister. Let me out or I'm gonna kill it! [a door is heard opening and Kyle goes down the steps, followed by Stan, Kevin, Craig, Clyde, Butters, Francis, Tweek, Bradley, Tolkien, Pip, and Timmy]
CARTMAN
Now you say, "Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!"
BEBE
Don't you hurt my fucking dog!
CARTMAN
You bitch, I'll cut your throat if- [stops when he hears Timmy's wheelchair and looks around]
KYLE
What the hell are you doing?
CARTMAN
We're playing "Lambs."
KYLE
[moves over to Bebe] Bebe, I thought we were going to watch Terrance & Phillip today.
BUTTERS
[moves forward] Then we gotta work on your campaign.
FRANCIS
[moves forward] Right, but first we have to go to the-
STAN
[jumps in front of Boy 2] Hoh! [the other boys begin to grunt and face each other]
BEBE
You guys, calm down!
[Tolkien tackles Bradley, Craig attacks Butters, Cartman punches Francis, Kyle attacks Kevin, Pip beats on Tweek, Bradley chases after Tolkien, and Francis tosses Cartman over his head. Stan goes after Pip, but Pip attacks first. Clyde goes after Tweek and sends him flying across the basement. Tolkien brings out a SuperBESTFriends lunchbox and throws it at Clyde. Clyde jumps out of the way and the lunchbox hits Timmy.]
TIMMY
Timmih!
[Clyde attacks Tolkien, but Tolkien punches him away, then jumps on him. Timmy runs over both of them. Tolkien jumps up and goes after Bradley again. Pip and Tweek fight again, and Stan comes flying in, taking Pip.]
BEBE
This is insane!
[Cartman picks Tweek up and throws him off. Francis is thrown backwards towards Bebe, back first. Bebe steps aside, and Francis hits the wall.]
BEBE
Stop it you guys, please!
[The map behind Bebe falls to the floor. Stan gets up, and Pip flies at him. Cartman and Bradley fight again. Kyle swings in from above on a hanging overhead light, landing on Cartman's back as Cartman fight Tweek. Tweek drops away, and Cartman has to wrestle Kyle. Bradley throws Tolkien into a fossil display case, and a femur falls out. Stan walks up and looks at Tolkien, then sees the femur. He picks it up and sees victory at hand. He starts beating everyone with the bone. He hits Clyde twice with it, and Clyde goes down. He then knocks out Kevin, then Cartman, then Kyle, then goes after the other boys.]
BEBE
Oh boy, I never meant to cause all this trouble!
STAN
[atop a pile of boys] Hoh, hoh, hohhh! Hohhh! [he's knocked them all out and tossed them into a mound]
[Bebe's house, day. She's at her window again, looking at the neighborhood. The boys are all over her front lawn milling around.]
MRS. STEVENS
Bebe, those boys from your school are still waiting outside to see if you'll come out.
BEBE
I know. They've been there all day. [Outside, Tolkien messes with a trash can. Cartman notices and walks over, pushing the trash can down. Stan plays with a rock on the steps. Craig inches his way towards Stan, who watches him from time to time, and Francis is up a tree.]
STAN
Hoh, hoh hoh hoh!
CRAIG
Hah hah hahah hah! [the other boys turn and start grunting. Stan chases Craig away from the steps, then returns to sitting there.]
STAN
Hoh hoh hoh! [picks up his rock and plays with it] Hohohoh hoh!
MRS. STEVENS
Looks like my little girl has a lot of gentlemen callers.
BEBE
Mom, why is everyone acting so different around me?
MRS. STEVENS
Sweetie, you're just blossoming into a woman.
BEBE
But, I, I don't know if I want to. Sometimes I think I'm not as smart and cool as they say, that everyone just tells me I am because of my hooters.
MRS. STEVENS
Sweetie, you're a Stevens. And Stevens women are always told they're really, really smart. [gives her a hug and then leaves]
BEBE
Mom? [her mom stops and turns around] What's six times eight?
MRS. STEVENS
Oho, sweetie, those are two completely different numbers. [satisfied, she turns around and walks out and downstairs. She opens the front door and the boys back away grunting] Alright boys, time to be getting home. Bebe's not feeling well and she can't come out today. Go on, shoo. [the boys walk away slowly, grunting in disappointment. A whistling sound is heard and a space shuttle crashes into a field across the street. The boys stop at the sight.]
STAN
Hoh. Hoh?
ASTRONAUT 1
Aah. We made it.
ASTRONAUT 2
Boys, can you call 9-1-1 for us? [the boys start to grunt again. Stan backs up into the crowd of boys]
ASTRONAUT 1
Oh my God. We've landed on Earth thousands of years in the future and apes have taken over!
ASTRONAUT 2
I knew it! You blew it up, didn't you?!
ASTRONAUT 1
I don't want to live in this futuristic madness! [pulls out a gun, shoots himself in the head, and falls down dead.]
ASTRONAUT 2
Take your ape rule and go to hell! [pulls out a gun, shoots himself in the head, and falls down dead.]
BEBE
[sighs] Having boobs sucks.
[Hell's Pass Hospital, later. A man walks in and goes to his desk.]
DR. HALLIS
Well hello there, little girl. My name is Dr. Hallis. What can I do for you today? [sits at his desk]
BEBE
I wanna have breast-reduction surgery. [the doctor leans forwards and visually inspects Bebe's chest]
DR. HALLIS
You?
BEBE
Yes. I have two hundred and twelve dollars in nickels and a gold bracelet.
DR. HALLIS
Well, young lady, I'm afraid that we don't offer breast reduction surgery to girls of your age.
BEBE
Why not? Britney Spears got fake ones when she was a teenager. Why can't I have mine taken off?
DR. HALLIS
Because making breasts larger is a beautiful and wonderful thing. Making them smaller is... insane.
BEBE
I think it's insane to want them bigger.
DR. HALLIS
Why do you... hate your breasts so?
BEBE
Ever since I got these stupid things everyone treats me differently. I feel like I might be treated differently the rest of my life.
DR. HALLIS
Oh, come on now, that's just silly.
BLONDE NURSE
[nice shape, walks in with a folder] Here's the Anderson file, Doctor.
DR. HALLIS
[looks up, looks down and grins, then looks up again] Oh, awesome. Thank you so much, Jillian. That's great. Oh, God-damn. Thank you so much. [The nurse walks out. Bebe lowers her eyelids halfway]
BRUNETTE NURSE
[not as nicely shaped, walks in with a cup and plate] And here's the coffee you wanted, doctor.
DR. HALLIS
[quickly, subdued, looks askance] Yeah, whatever. Get out of here. [the nurse walks out, and he addresses Bebe again] Now, I was saying?
BEBE
Please, you have to help me. I think that if my breasts keep growing this way, boys will give me whatever I want.
DR. HALLIS
Yeah, so? That's great, isn't it?
BEBE
No it's not, because if I grow up getting everything I want, having things made easy for me because I have hot knockers, then I'm gonna grow up to be a lame person. If I'm handed everything in life, then my chances of becoming a lawyer or a marine biologist are zero.
DR. HALLIS
That may be true, but I'm afraid I just cannot ethically perform a breast-reduction surgery on an eight-year-old girl.
BEBE
Damnit!
DR. HALLIS
If, on the other hand, you'd like to make them a little bigger, I think now might be the right time to size up, hm?
BEBE
Oh, fuck off! [walks off in disgust]
[Stan's house, day. In the dining room Randy reads the paper. Sharon enters.]
SHARON
Randy, could you have a talk with Stanley?
RANDY
Why? What's the matter with him?
SHARON
It's just that, well, he's been acting a little different lately. [Randy looks. In the living room Stan has taken out his crayons and drawn some figures on the wall]
STAN
[disheveled, in his primal state] Aaaa-ta. [starts drawing another boob. The wall is covered with them, singly or in pairs. One stick-figure woman has a large pair] Aaaa-ta.
SHARON
He's been ignoring his homework, and, all of his friends. I can't figure out why.
STAN
[picks up a stick and moves it around] Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta.
RANDY
Ohhh boy. Looks like he's starting to notice breasts.
SHARON
[relieved and proud] Oh yes. Our little Stanley is starting to become a man. [Randy leaves his seat at the table and approaches Stan]
STAN
[points to the wall with his stick] Ahta. Ah, ahta!
RANDY
Hey there, son.
STAN
[turns to face his father] Hoh? Ahta. [points to the wall] Ahta.
RANDY
Yes, ahta. Let's have a talk, Stan.
STAN
Ahta.
RANDY
Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these "ahta" will start becoming a major part of your life.
STAN
Ahta? [Sharon walks behind Randy and sits on one of the sofa's arms]
RANDY
But Stanley, you can't let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're just boobs; your friends... are forever.
STAN
[considers each argument] Friends. Ahta.
RANDY
I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs. Boobs will come and go, and then, someday, [places his left hand on Sharon's right shoulder. She smiles] you'll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry. And those become the boobs that matter the most.
SHARON
[putting her right arm around Randy] I love you.
RANDY
If you can just understand that, Stanley, you'll see that boobs hold no real power at all.
[Bebe's house, night. The house is dark, so she's asleep. The camera zooms in on her, and her breasts start to blink under her gown.]
RIGHT BREAST
The boys are at war. All is going as planned.
LEFT BREAST
Yes. Soon all the boys will be brought to their knees.
RIGHT BREAST
We grow larger every day.
LEFT BREAST
And stronger.
RIGHT BREAST
Soon the entire tow- [Bebe awakens]
LEFT BREAST
Sh! Sh! She's awake!
RIGHT BREAST
Ah, quiet.
BEBE
[shrieks and kicks her blanket off] MOM!! MOM!!
MRS. STEVENS
[rushes to Bebe's room and enters] What is it, Bebe?
BEBE
[scared] My breasts!
MRS. STEVENS
[approaches the bed, sits, and holds her] Oh, sweetheart, you're just becoming a young lady.
BEBE
No, they're conspiring! Mom, they were talking! They wanna destroy the town!
MRS. STEVENS
[beat] Yes, darling, your breasts have a power that will unleash itself as you get older. They feed off the misery of boys and grow to bring woe wherever they can. You're blossoming into a woman. [hugs her]
BEBE
That does it! I'm NOT letting these things run my life!
[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Dr. Hallis walks in with a file and quickly addresses his prospective client.]
DR. HALLIS
Young lady, are you absolutely sure you want to consider this kind of procedure for your breasts?
WENDY
Yes! I want to get breast implants!
MRS. TESTABURGER
I tried to tell her she was too young.
DR. HALLIS
Well, it is a different time, Mrs. Testaburger. Society puts a lot of pressure on your daughter to look her best. Having small breasts can make her feel unimportant.
MRS. TESTABURGER
[considers the doctor's argument...] But she's eight!
DR. HALLIS
Yes, well, not too young to feel flat and therefore, not pretty.
WENDY
That's what I said.
DR. HALLIS
However, young lady, I'm afraid breast implants are not for everyone. [takes out a notepad] I'll need to carefully assess your physical and mental condition to see if augmentation is truly the best way for you to go.
WENDY
I have three thousand dollars, cash. [her mom blanches]
DR. HALLIS
[quickly disposes of the pad and pen, then rises and leaves the desk] You pass. Let's do this thing.
MRS. TESTABURGER
[mortified] Oh, wait. You're gonna do it right now?
DR. HALLIS
Suuure. Breast augmentation is now a very simple procedure. [holds Wendy's right arm up and points to the armpit] What we do is make a small incision in the armpit where it won't be seen. Then we take this little plastic bag and gently place it in the chest where we fill it with salt water.
MRS. TESTABURGER
I still don't know about this.
DR. HALLIS
Look. Us plastic surgeons have one philosophy. If we can help someone's self-esteem a little, then why not do it if they have three thousand dollars?
[Operating room, moments later. Wendy is hooked up and sedated. The first incision is made to the left armpit and the flesh pulled back hard. The nurse hands the doctor the first implant, which he shoves in Wendy's chest.]
DR. HALLIS
[shove] Cha! [shove] Gotta! [shove] Jam it! [shove] Up there! [shove] Get! [shove] In! [shove] There! [shove] You! [shove] Bitch! [shoves faster] Get! [shove] In! [shove] There! [shove] You! [shove] Bitch! [the implant is finally in place; everything is covered in blood] Hah! [wipes his brow] Okay, there's one, Wendy. Doing great.
[South Park Elementary, day. Mr. Mackey is back teaching the class. The kids are at their seats. The boys are being apes, and the girls look scared.]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay. Kids, we need to talk about your failing grades.
CLYDE
[in primal mode] Bebe! Where Bebe?! Bebe! Bebe! [he and a few others grunt a bit]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, we all need to start studying more and fighting less, m'kay? [the grunts start up again]
BRADLEY
Bebe! [more grunts.]
STAN
Ahta! [more grunts. Bebe enters wearing a cardboard box over her clothes. The boys quiet down.]
BEBE
Hey guys. [a few boys grunt back with "Hi!!" "Hey." "Hm." as she heads for her seat. The boys are confused.]
CRAIG
Have you guys noticed that Bebe isn't as cool as she used to be? [Bebe smiles at her uncoolness]
TOLKIEN
Yeah. What the hell happened to us?
STAN
Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs.
CARTMAN
Bebe's boobs?
BEBE
Oh cool! It worked!
STAN
Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions.
KYLE
Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?
BEBE
Yes!
CARTMAN
So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?
BEBE
Right. My boobs just clouded your judgment.
KYLE
But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me.
STAN
I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us.
CLYDE
Yeah. Screw boobs! They're stupid!
CRAIG
I'm sorry for fighting, you guys. [all the boys leave their seats and start apologizing to each other, hugging each other]
MR. MACKEY
[moved by this display of affection] Aw, that's so sweet, m'kay?
CLYDE
Let's never let boobs come between us again!
THE BOYS
Hear Hear!
KYLE
Boobs are stupid!
WENDY
[enters with her new, ample implants] Hi, everybody. [the boys look at her for a long while, then start laughing heartily. Wendy is stunned at the response]
CLYDE
Look at those ridiculous things!
BUTTERS
[steps up and touches the left breast] Oooo, they're all hard and oogey!
CARTMAN
What a stupid bitch! [the boys start laughing again. Butters is laughing hard, but realizes that his finger is still on Wendy's breast.]
End of Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society

synopsis:In an effort to protect their children from kidnappers, the parents hire the owner of City Wok Restaurant to build the Great Wall of South Park.

script:Child Abduction is Not Funny

[Tweek's house, night. He's on the sofa looking at news.]
NEWS ANCHOR
[News 4] And in other news, another school shooting has taken place, this time in Idaho. As these kinds of shooting increase, one thing becomes clear: Your children are not safe at school.
TWEEK
Oh God! [frantically fishes for the remote control] Change it! Change it! [finds it and changes channels]
NEWS ANCHOR
[News 5] This was the second time a terrorist threat has been made on a theme park, leaving everyone to realize that children are not safe outside.
TWEEK
Agh! God, change it!! [clicks through a few channels]
NEWS ANCHOR
[SNN, with weather bar at bottom] And it seems there's a new danger to look out for: children who are taken by strangers. The bottom line: children are not safe... in their own homes!
TWEEK
[throws a fit] Aaaah!!
MRS. TWEAK
[arrives] Tweek.
TWEEK
Gahahghah!
MRS. TWEAK
Tweek? Come to the kitchen, sweetie. We need to see you real quick. [leaves. Tweek soon follows]
[Kitchen. Richard is at table as Tweek arrives. Tweek's mom is serving coffee. There are two coffee makers in the background.]
TWEEK
Oh God. They're gonna get me.
RICHARD
Sit down and have some coffee, son. [Tweek climbs onto his seat and takes a sip, then several more] Tweek, there's starting to be a lot of reports in the news about children being abducted, and we thought we should talk.
TWEEK
[points to the TV] I s-I saw! Uuuh!
MRS. TWEAK
You know never to talk to strangers, right Tweek? You can't trust anybody.
TWEEK
[panting] Oh God! Huh!
RICHARD
Now, we don't want to alarm you, son, but we've installed new locks on your bedroom windows and door. It's important for you to know never to unlock them at night for anyone except your mother and I.
TWEEK
[panting] Oh Jesus! Huh!
MRS. TWEAK
It's just a precaution, sweetie. Probably nothing will ever happen.
[The Tweek house, after bedtime. Tweek is in his bed having a nightmare.]
TWEEK
No, ...NO! They're gonna get me! [wakes up] GAAAH! Huh, huh, huh-oh, oh God. [holds himself] Uh, just a dream. [gasps. His bedroom windows are open and the curtains are softly blowing in the breeze] OH MY GOD!! [quickly jumps up and closes the windows. Four knocks are heard at the door] GAAAH!! [throws the blanket over his head. Two more knocks, and then]
VOICE
[on the other side of the door] Tweek! This is Officer Daniels! Now, try and stay calm, but we believe an abductor is in your room!
TWEEK
...Inside my room? Oh God!
VOICE
Give it up, buddy! We've got ya surrounded! Okay, Tweek, I want you to very calmly but quickly walk to the door and come out to us!
TWEEK
[thinks and looks around] Oh my God! [hops down and makes his way to the door] Oh! Oh! Jesus, see me through this. [opens the door and steps out, only to find a gun to his face. He gasps, then] AAAHH!
VOICE
Bang! [the gun is withdrawn] You're dead, Tweek. [the camera zooms out to show Mr. Tweek holding the gun]
TWEEK
[look up bewildered] What?
RICHARD
You failed the test, son. Didn't I tell you not to open the door for anybody except your mother and I?
TWEEK
[a bit panicked] Oh God! Oh Jesus!
MRS. TWEAK
[walks up and stands next to Richard at the doorway] What if that had been a child abductor pretending to be a police officer, Tweek?
RICHARD
He would have sprayed your brains all over the floor and then taken your body off to the woods. [Tweek shakes his head in frustration and whimpers] You've got to be on your toes, Tweek. Alright, now go to bed and get some rest.
MRS. TWEAK
'Night, pumpkin. [his dad closes the door and locks it, then the parents go off to bed. Tweek turns to go to bed, but looks distraught]
[The Bijou, next day. "Men In Black II" is showing. Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Tweek walk up to the ticket booth.]
STAN
I hope this movie doesn't suck ass.
KYLE
It will.
CARTMAN
[orders his ticket first] One please.
TWEEK
[stopping Cartman] Wait, that's not the usual ticket-taker guy!
KYLE
So?
TWEEK
So? I don't know him!
CARTMAN
Dude, relax.
TWEEK
You relax! What if he wants to kill me?! AAAAAAAA!! [runs away]
CARTMAN
Gah, what the hell do his parents do to him?
[Down the road. Tweek is running, but soon tires out. A car pulls up and the driver looks out the passenger window.]
DRIVER
'Scuse me, is this the right road to Breckenridge.
TWEEK
[looks up] AAH! Uh...
DRIVER
Please, I just need to know if this is "South Park"?
TWEEK
Get away from meee! [runs off again. The confused driver looks at him go]
[A street corner. Tweek arrives there and stops to catch his breath. An elderly lady walks up and taps his hair. Tweek screams and jumps back. The crossing signal says "WALK," so it's alright for both to cross the street.]
ELDERLY LADY
Could you help me across the street?
TWEEK
I don't know you! [runs across the street] Ah, AAAH!
[The outskirts of town. Tweek is running and arrives at some train tracks. A man in a wheelchair sits between the tracks. He looks behind to see that no one has followed him.]
MAN IN WHEELCHAIR
Oh, hey, kid! [Tweek looks over] Oh, thank God you happened by. My- my chair ran out of juice right on these train tracks. If you hadn't had shown up, well... Well, anyway, could you give me a push?
TWEEK
Huh uh!
MAN IN WHEELCHAIR
No, no, you don't understand. I'm, I'm paralyzed from the neck down. I push the chair with this device in front of my mouth, but it's it's not working, so you see-
TWEEK
I'm not supposed to talk to you!
MAN IN WHEELCHAIR
Please, this, this isn't funny, kid. You have to help me.
TWEEK
But it could be a trick! [a train zooms by, taking the paralyzed man with it. Tweek watches it go by] Ugh. That's a pretty good trick.
[The Tweek house, night. Tweek is again asleep, peacefully. A light fills the room and rouses him from his sleep. At the foot of the bed is a man dressed in a robe. He holds a scepter in his right hand and wears laurel branches on his head. He is glowing, as is the bauble atop the scepter.]
TWEEK
AaaaAAAHH! [hides under his covers]
MAN
[speaking with authority] Relax, Tweek. I am not here to hurt you. I am the Ghost of Human Kindness.
TWEEK
[peeks out from behind the covers] The Ghost of Human Kindness?
THE GHOST OF HUMAN KINDNESS
You have never seen the likes of me before.
TWEEK
What do you want?
THE GHOST OF HUMAN KINDNESS
You have lost faith in humanity, lad. Something I cannot bear to see happen.
TWEEK
Huh-uh, how can I help it? It seems that everywhere I turn, someone is out to get me.
THE GHOST OF HUMAN KINDNESS
That is the world of the news reports. It is the world that adults preoccupy themselves with, but it is not the world as it is.
TWEEK
It isn't?
[A woman enters the Shady Acres Retirement Community and heads for the front door. Tweek and the ghost arrive and follow her in.]
THE GHOST OF HUMAN KINDNESS
Look here, Tweek. This woman is on her way to the retirement home. [they arrive at the front door] She doesn't get paid; she volunteers her time to talk with lonely elderly people who want nothing more than a friend. [the woman hugs an elderly lady, then moves on to other folks.] But do you hear about her on the news? No.
[A one-story house, later. Tweek and the ghost reach the front window.]
THE GHOST OF HUMAN KINDNESS
Now gaze upon this humble house, Tweek. Inside there are two people who have adopted needy children. [a close-up of a man reading to his baby. Two other kids, a Japanese girl and a black boy, sit on the floor listening. The mother arrives with drinks] They were strangers to those kids once. Now they are loving parents.
[The camera looks at a snowy sky with a full moon and pans down. Tweek and the ghost are walking down the highway.]
THE GHOST OF HUMAN KINDNESS
Now, look here, boy. [a shot of a man changing the front left tire of a Cadillac for an elderly lady. A young woman stands ready with a spare tire] A car has broken down with a flat tire, and two complete strangers have stopped to help. [the man signals for the tire, the woman rolls it to him] Will their kindness be reported on the news tomorrow? I think not.
[South Park. Tweek and the ghost are back in town.]
THE GHOST OF HUMAN KINDNESS
Are you starting to understand, boy?
TWEEK
I think so. You mean that, even though all the news is about murderers and abductors, those kind of people... only make up a very small part of the world.
THE GHOST OF HUMAN KINDNESS
That's right, lad. So do you think you can learn to trust people now?
TWEEK
I'll... try.
THE GHOST OF HUMAN KINDNESS
Good. Then why don't you get into the back of my van, and I'll drive you home. [the camera pans to a dirty dilapidated van]
TWEEK
Your van? [flashlights click on and focus on the ghost and at least five squad cars pull up to the two people]
OFFICER 1
Alright Johnson, give it up!
THE GHOST OF HUMAN KINDNESS
[strikes his scepter to the ground with each expletive] Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! [four officers close in with guns drawn. Tweek steps aside] Oh, I was so close!
TWEEK
What the hell is going on?
MRS. TWEAK
Tweek, Tweek, are you okay?
RICHARD
Did he hurt you, son?
TWEEK
No.
DETECTIVE
Then we aren't too late. His name is Frederick Johnson. He's been abducting children by dressing up like the Ghost of Human Kindness for over a year now.
THE GHOST OF HUMAN KINDNESS
And I would have gotten away with it again if it weren't for you meddling policemen! [the policemen escort him away. A wide shot shows the Stotches, the Williamses and the Marshes viewing the arrest in their pajamas. Liane Cartman walks up in her gown. She's wearing a facial treatment mask]
LIANE
What's going on?
SHARON
A stranger was caught trying to abduct the Tweak boy.
SHEILA
[the Broflovskis arrive in their pajamas] An abductor in our town?
STEVE
Oh my God, what are we gonna do?
[South Park City Hall, next day. The townsfolk are clamoring outside the front door.]
TOWNSFOLK
RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
People, people, calm down.
RANDY
Well, what are we gonna do, Mayor?! We have to stop these abductors from being able to get into our town!
TOWNSFOLK
Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble...
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Yes, but standing out here yelling "Rabble rabble rabble" isn't going to help anything.
JIMBO
Well, we don't know what else to do, Mayor!
TOWNSFOLK
Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[gestures for them to quiet down, and they do] People, what do you think we need to do?
GERALD
[thinks] Uh, well, we need to find a way to close our town off from unwanted strangers!
SHEILA
Yes, we need a barrier to protect our kids.
TOWNSFOLK
RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE!
RANDY
Wait, that's it. A wall. We could build a huge city wall all around South Park so that we have complete control over who comes in.
RICHARD
That's... not a bad idea, a city wall.
SHEILA
But who can we get to build it?
[City Wok, later. Several adults are in the restaurant.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
...And so, we want you to design and build a great wall, all around the city.
TUONG LU KIM
I don' build wall. I just own un' operate City Wok.
GERALD
We just think that you're the best person to put up a wall. We're sure you've got it in your blood.
TUONG LU KIM
[thinks a moment] Oh, I get it. Just because I Chinese, you think I build wall. That i' bullshit! I'm not stereotype, okay?! Just because I'm Chinese doesn't mean I go around building wall! I'm just a normal person like all o'you! I eat ahrice and drive ahreally slow, just like the rest o'you! I'm not stereotype!
SHARON
Please, Mr. Tuong Lu Kim.
RANDY
Your ancestors put up a great wall that kept Mongolians out for thousands of years. We know you can do it for us.
[Outside South Park, some weeks later. A great wall has gone up around South Park, enclosing it like a medieval wall. This is the Great Wall of South Park. Tuong, dressed in his restaurant's uniform, is laying down some bricks. He hears some horses and look up. Some Mongolians have arrived and drawn their swords. They chip away at the wall.]
TUONG LU KIM
Hey. Hey hey! [rushes over to the gap the Mongolians are creating] Hey, what the hell you doing?! [the Mongolian leader says a few words] Mongorians? What the hell Mongorians doing here? [the Mongolians keep attacking the wall] Ey, fuck you, Mongorians! Tryin' break down my wall! [starts throwing bricks at the Mongolians] Get out of here, fuckin' Mongorians! [the Mongolians turn and ride away] God-damnit, how come every time us Chinese put up a wall, stupid Mongorians have to come and knock it down?
[South Park, now encircled by the Great Wall, later.]
[The Marsh house, living room. Stan is on the sofa watching TV. His parents enter. Randy is carrying a box.]
RANDY
Stan, our abduction problems are over. We got the new Child Tracker.
STAN
Child Tracker?
SHARON
It's a little electrical device that can tell us where you are anywhere on Earth.
RANDY
If anybody takes you, we'll be able to locate your exact location within two meters.
[Moments later, Randy finishes installing the Tracker, and both parents smile.]
RANDY
There, I think that's got it. [Stan is now wearing a very elaborate helmet with several antennae, a red light, and a small satellite dish sitting on top.]
STAN
...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker!
RANDY
You can barely even tell you have one on.
STAN
I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?!
SHARON
I wouldn't worry about that.
[School bus stop, next day. Stan is wearing his tracker. Kyle, Cartman, and Tweek are wearing their own trackers. All trackers are activated.]
CARTMAN
So weak. So weak, dude. Man.
KYLE
Why did you go and have to be abducted, Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking out!
TWEEK
I didn't mean to.
[The Great Wall of South Park. Tuong finishes the repairs on the damaged section.]
TUONG LU KIM
Okay. Finary. [looks around] Oh no. [picks up a telescope, with "Mongolian Telescope written on it and looks through it. He finds the Mongolians attacking the wall at a position far off] It's those God-damned Mongorians again! Stop! Stop right there, Mongorians! [a shot from inside a tower of Tuong running down the rampart] God-damnit, stop! [a far shot of Tuong running down the rampart] Stop breaking down my city wall you stupid Mongoriaaans! [finally arrives at the source of the noise] Ay, you sons of bitches, you- [sees a ruse. Clothes were placed on twigs and a tape player plays a recording of Mongolian noises] What the hell? [straightens up] Oh, shit! [looks off to his right to see the Mongolians attacking the part of the wall he was at before] OH, GOD-DAMNED MONGORIANS!! [runs back along the rampart to the Mongolians] I'm gonna get you, fuckin' Mongorians! Stop breaking my city wall! [reaches the new gap and the Mongolians ride away] Oh, God-damnit! [the Mongolian leader says something. Tuong calls out after them] That's the last time you're gonna break down my city wall! You hear me, Mongorians?! [goes about repairing the wall] God-damned Mongorians.
[A baseball field. A cheer comes up from the bleachers. A close-up shows the townsfolk rooting for their Cows.]
RICHARD
Alright, Cows, We're gonna go out there and we're gonna give 'em hell! [the boys are wearing their Child Trackers. Cartman is the catcher, Stan is the pitcher]
KYLE
But, wait. Where's the other team? [the field is shown. The opposing bullpen is empty and there are no opposing players on the field. There's no visiting team out there.]
RANDY
There is no other team.
STAN
Huh?
RICHARD
Well, we've... put a wall around the city to keep outsiders out. You don't think we want a bunch of strangers coming in to play ball, do you?
STAN
But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun.
RANDY
Don't worry, it'll still be fun for us. [takes a sip of his beer. Richard sips from his beer can, then other townsfolk in the bleachers sip from their beer cans. The Cows take positions on the field]
TOWNSFOLK
Go Cows! Go Cows! Go Cows! Go Cows!
JIMBO
[umpire] Play ball! [Stan looks at the people in the stands, then pitches to Cartman] Steeeeee-riiike!!
TOWNSFOLK
[standing and cheering] Yeah! Woohoo! Yeah!
[Crust E. Krotch's Pizza, Corral, night. The town is in there celebrating a victory. Ned is playing "Thirst For Blood".]
JIMBO
[raises a mug of beer] South Park Cows do it again!
SHARON
Congratulations on your victory, boys. [Cartman is already eating a slice of pizza]
KYLE
Dude, we weren't playing anybody.
RANDY
Yeah, and you kicked ass!
ROGER
Isn't it awesome havin' a great wall around our city? Nobody in town except for our good friends.
TOWNSFOLK
Yeahah! Alright! Yeah. Right on! Right on!
RICHARD
[calling attention to the TV] Guys! Sh, quiet everyone. [the news is on]
NEWS ANCHOR
[in gray jacket] And this newest study reveals more about child abductions than we apparently knew before, Tom. [the adults move closer to the TV]
SHARON
Turn it up.
TOM
[in brown jacket] That's right, Chris. This newest study shows that the majority of child abductions are NOT committed by strangers, but by somebody the child knows in their own town. [the adults start looking at the others around them, at each other.] The report further states that it is because the child trusts the individual that problems occur in the first place.
CHRIS
Well, I guess this means the enemy is in our own backyard, so to speak.
TOM
Sure does, Tom.
CHRIS
Alright, thanks, Chris. Is the weather going to turn su- [click. The parents go to their kids and they depart one by one]
RICHARD
Well, if you'll all excuse us, I think we'll be going now. [takes Tweek, and the family leaves. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman remain, eating]
GERALD
[walks up] Yeah. Come along, Kyle [the Broflovskis leave. Stan and Cartman remain]
SHARON
Stanley, time for us to get back to the house.
STAN
[mouth full] I'm not done with my pizza.
SHARON
NOW, Stanley! [whisks him off. Randy follows, looking at Cartman, left all alone with his mom]
[The Great Wall of South Park. Tuong is working on something behind a brick shield.]
TUONG LU KIM
Eh. Eh, eh, there we go. [pulls out a large weapon] All finished. My Mongolian Missile Defense system. [a bazooka reading "MONGOLIAN ERADICATOR." He mounts it on his shoulder and takes aim. Next, he sets it down and drops a missile into it] Those Mongolians try to break down my city wall again, they gonna get a big heat-seeking missile surprise! [hoofbeats are heard and the Mongolians are once again present and ready to attack. Tuong sees them and taunts them] Oh! Hello Mongolians. Yeah. You come to break down my city wall? [the leader holds out a baseball] Oh, you gonna throw that baseball at my wall? [feigns despair] Oh no! Not a baseball! I'm pretty scared. [the leader tosses the ball in the air straight up] Well, you know what? I might have something here that's a little bigger than a baseball. [arms himself with the bazooka, setting it at hip level] Say hello to my little friend! [fires the missile and watches it go towards the Mongolians. One of the Mongolians pours gasoline on the ball. The leader reaches back to get a lighter from another Mongolian and sets the ball on fire. The missile gets close to them. The leader throws the ball at Tuong and the missile follows the ball. The ball hits the wall and drops to the snow. Tuong realizes what this means] Aw, crap. [the missile strikes the ball and blows a new gap into the great wall. After the smoke clears, Tuong is lying in the rubble, clearly hurt] Ooohhhh [the leader draws his sword and the Mongolians have a good laugh about this incident. Then they turn and ride off, laughing.] God-damned Mongolians!! You break down my city wall last time!!
[South Park, the bus stop, next day. The parents are present with the boys as they wait for the school bus.]
STAN
Dude, this is worse than Child Tracker.
RICHARD
'Sokay, boys. Just act as if we weren't here.
SHARON
Right. Do what you normally would do.
KYLE
[volunteers] You're such a fatass, Cartman.
CARTMAN
At least I'm not a stupid Jew.
SHEILA
What-what-whaaat?
[South Park Elementary. The bell rings and the class begins. Mr. Mackey is at the board.]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, kids, so, now, who can tell me what year the first moon landing took place? [a shot of the class with all parents present] Uh, how about you, Clyde?
ROGER
[whispers into Clyde's ear] Nineteen six-
MR. MACKEY
No helping! [Mr. Donovan looks around, embarrassed, and stands up] M'kay, I'm not really sure havin' all the parents here is a good idea, m'kay?
RICHARD
Well, maybe things would be better if we could trust people like the Stotches!
STEPHEN
Us? Your family's always been the shifty-eyed ones!
RICHARD
Oh yeah?! [the other parents begin to bicker except for Liane who hugs his son.]
MR. MACKEY
Oh, this is too much to take. [goes to his desk, where his own parents wait, and sits down.] Mom, Dad, could you please leave me alone?
MR. MACKEY'S FATHER
We just wanna make sure nobody hurts you, Junior, m'kay?
MR. MACKEY
M'kay.
[Great Wall of South Park. Mr. Lu Kim wheels a vat of boiling fluid to one of the openings.]
TUONG LU KIM
Hahahaha! My masterpiece! [stirs his concoction] When those Mongolians come next time, I pour this sweet and sour pork on their heads. Haha, sweet and sour pork so hot and sticky, Mongolians'll stick ahright up to the wall! And scream "UhwOoOoOoOoo!" Oh I can't wait. [hears something to his left. He looks and sees a wooden horse on wheels rolling up to the gate. He studies the horse and tries to think what to make of it] Oh, I get it. A Trojan Mongolian horse. Mongolians a-hiding inside thinking that I'll bring it in city wall, then Mongolians pop out and destroy wall from the inside out without gettin' any sweet and sour pork on their heads! Okay. I'll pray around. [starts to feign gratitude, moves to the rampart above the gate] Oh! Oh rook! Rook, my very own Mongorian Trojan horse! Gee, what a surprise! I guess Mongorians aren't such crappy, smelly people after all! [makes his way down the stairs near a tower and reaches the side door] Yeah. Great! Rwow! [opens the side door and walks over to the horse carrying a fireman's ax.] Yeah, what a great present! I'm just gonna push it inside the gate and show it to all my friends. [pulls down a door handle under the horse. Two doors open above him and release some seweet and sour pork on him, forcing him to the ground. He finds it hard to move around] Oh, it's sweet and sour pork! [The Mongolians ride up again and attack the wall with their swords. Tuong speaks, but his words become less familiar, due to the stickiness of the sauce] Oh! I'm going to get you Nogodians, if it's the last thing I do!
[The Tweek house, night. The parents are in the living room sitting together on the sofa watching TV and sharing a bag of popcorn. A blanket covers their legs. The surroundings show an iron door where the front door is, and roll-down iron blinds over the windows.]
NEWS ANCHOR
[News 4] And so all the residents of Manhattan are prepared to evacuate if Ms. Clinton's ass gets any bigger. And in other news, new findings on the increase in child abductions.
RICHARD
Oh Jesus, turn it up, honey!
NEWS ANCHOR
The study shows that the most likely abductors of children... are the parents themselves! [the two adults are somewhat stunned] The study reveals that nine out of every ten abduction cases are committed by the child's mother or father. The bottom line being that your children aren't safe, even from you! [Tweek's mom rises from the couch and walks away from it. Richard watches her go]
RICHARD
Where are you going?
MRS. TWEAK
Uh... I'm just going to go upstairs and see if Tweek is still in his bed.
RICHARD
Oh? [puts the popcorn and blanket aside and rises] I think I'll go with you.
MRS. TWEAK
It's okay. I can do it.
RICHARD
I just want to make sure that you-
MRS. TWEAK
That I don't abduct him? How do I know that you haven't done it already?
RICHARD
Me? I would never abduct our son!
MRS. TWEAK
That's not what the new study says!
RICHARD
[wipes his forehead, then] Well what are we supposed to do, eh-? How can we protect Tweek from ourselves? [both parents look upstairs]
[South Park, next day. The families gather on a neighborhood street. The parents are hugging their kids.]
RANDY
[hands Stan some money] Here you go, Stanley. This should hold you over for three years.
STAN
But why do I have to leave?
RANDY
The news says that at your age you aren't safe with us, son. You have to get out of here before we abduct you.
SHARON
Good-bye, son. [hugs Stan and sobs softly] Remember to eat right.
GERALD
[wistfully] Look out for your brother, Kyle. You're the man now.
SHEILA
Oh, boys! Don't ever forget that we love you! [Gerald hugs Kyle, Sheila hugs Ike. They begin to cry, and the other adults follow. They leave their kids and huddle, then turn around, crying all the while]
LINDA
Be careful out there!
STAN
Where are we supposed to go?
RANDY
We can't tell you because we can't know where you are! [turns back to cry with Sharon]
SHEILA
Oh, this is terrible! [turns and cries with Gerald]
ROGER
Go on, kids! Go! Go and don't look back! [turns and hugs his wife. The adults are bawling now. Tolkien is the first to leave, and the other kids follow him]
RANDY
Good-bye, kids. We'll... never forget you. [the adults continue crying. Stephen pulls out a ram's horn and blows into it a few times]
STAN
Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid.
A WOMAN
[in the crowd, crying] Oh my God.
[The Great Wall of South Park, day. Tuong is still congealed under the sweet and sour sauce the Mongolians dumped on him, but the Trojan Mongolian horse is gone. A dog walks by and sniffs.]
TUONG LU KIM
Ah. Hey daw. O'er 'ere. O'er 'ere, dog. Got som'in sweet and souh foh ya. [the dog walks over and starts licking the sauce away] Good dog! That's it! Keep licking, dog!
[Some time later. Tuong runs along the ramparts of the wall, finally freed from the sweet and sour pork that had held him in place.]
TUONG LU KIM
Hahahahahaaa! I'm free, Mongolians! And now I'm gonna make you PAY!
[The Marsh house, night. Randy is at the sofa watching the news.]
NEWS ANCHOR
Finally, some good news tonight. It's been several days since any child abductions have taken place. The main reason: parents don't know where their children are. [Sharon, at the window, sighs. Randy turns and looks at her. Snow flakes float down outside]
RANDY
What's the matter? [stands up]
SHARON
Oh, it's just... I was wondering if Stan's okay.
RANDY
[walks up to her] Oh, I'm sure he's made it somewhere safe by now. [puts his hand on her back]
SHARON
Do you really think we did the right thing, Randy? Sending all the young kids in town off to live on their own?
RANDY
[faces her, makes her face him] Sweetheart, you saw the news...
SHARON
I know. [they turn back to the window]
RANDY
Don't you worry. I'm sure that Stan and all the other kids are somewhere safe, off in a whole new city by now, making a new life for themselves.
[A Mongolian camp outside the Great Wall of South Park, night. The Mongolians are roasting and enjoying small animals, and drying the hides near a tent. The town's kids are now with them, wearing new clothes.]
LEADER
Tah tane da ke ab kahleh kalabush.
STAN
Bi ologad bag, big nan dastai. [the Mongolians laugh]
MONGOLIAN
[in blue] De bandig baeakhalah?
CARTMAN
Tawya mea pleda cleah bleah.
TWEEK
Triben fak burushban.
ALL
Shain balag!
[The Great Wall of South Park, day. Tuong pops up outside the wall dressed in imperial attire.]
TUONG LU KIM
Awright, Mongolians! Your only way through this wall is through me. This is my rast stand! I'm gonna do my war dance now. [begins a chant and dances for a few seconds, then stops] Does my war dance ascare you, Mongolians? Yeah, you think you want a piece of this? [resumes his dance. Seeing Tuong engrossed in his dance, the children move some explosives to a spot against the wall. Tolkien peeks to make sure everything is in place. The kids then walk back to the Mongolians, past Tuong...] This is ancient Chinese dance of a- Oh, herro kids. Uh be careful, there's a-Mongolians up there. [resumes his dance as the kids line up before the Mongolians. Stan hands the detonator to the Mongolian leader, who holds it for a while. Tuong notices the wire stretching between the Mongolians and the explosives against the wall] Oh, crap! [the explosives blow up, knocking Tuong towards the Mongolians and leaving a big gap in the wall. The kids and the Mongolians have a good laugh. The adults in town come to see the commotion]
RANDY
What's going on?
LIANE
I heard an explosion.
TUONG LU KIM
[battered, comes into view] God-damned Mongolians attacked city wall again! [The kids and the Mongolians have a good laugh again.]
MILLARD ANDERSON
Mongolians?
RANDY
What the hell are they doin' here?! Rabble! Rabble rabble!
ADULTS
Rabble rabble rabble rabble!
RICHARD
Wait a minute. Those Mongolians are... our children. [a shot of the kids and Mongolians]
SHEILA
Ike? Kyle?
SHARON
My son has become a Mongolian? No! Noooo!! [buries her head in Randy's chest]
RICHARD
Oh God. What have we done? We sent our children away, and now they don't even remember who they are.
ROGER
Kids? Don't you remember us?
RANDY
Wait wait. I learned some Mongolian in college. [steps forth] Ah, let's see. Uh. K-kids, uh, Bi kute. Bi salnek kute. Uh-d tah tasobarro.
STAN
["Budu e noo"] Oh my God, our parents are so stupid, dude. [squeezes his eyes shut and buries his face in his right hand]
RANDY
Bi kute.
ROGER
We are your parents. You used to live here, with us.
KYLE
Yeah, it was like four days ago!
RICHARD
They're starting to remember.
RANDY
[walks quickly and kneels next to Stan] Staaan. Your name... is Staaan!
STAN
Uh huh, Stan Marsh.
RANDY
[holds Stan firmly] That's it! Remember, son! Rememmmber! [the rest of the parents rush out and hug their own kids, crying in relief]
RICHARD
We're sorry, Tweek!
ROGER
Are you okay, Clyde?
STEPHEN
[Butters' parents hug the wrong person - the Mongolian leader] Oh, son, can you ever forgive us?
BUTTERS
Huh, I'm over here, Dad.
STEPHEN
Oh. [he and Linda rush to hug him]
SHEILA
We're sorry, kids. We just let all those sensationalist news reports go to our heads.
RICHARD
Oh my God, do you see what this means? The Ghost of Human Kindness was right all along.
ROGER
You mean how he said we should trust each other, or how he abducted children?
RICHARD
The uh... no, the part about being more trusting. We should follow what he said, not what he did.
ADULTS
Wow, yeah. Oh yeah.
RANDY
No, no. You know who was right all along? The Mongolians. [a shot of the Mongolians] They knew that you just can't wall yourself off from the outside world. Putting walls up never helps anything. Tearing them down brings us together.
ADULTS
Whoa! Wow. Right!
STEPHEN
Yeah, the Mongolians were right. Yeah.
TUONG LU KIM
Aw, you'd better not say what I think you're gonna say.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Mr. Lu Kim, tear down this wall!
TUONG LU KIM
Oh, God! I hate this whole shitty!
SHARON
Randy, can we just take our son home now?
RANDY
Yes, kids. [steps forward] With us, now come. Home. Hoomme. [all turn and walk towards town through the gap in the great wall]
STAN
[to Kyle] Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ. [faces forward and continues walking]
End of Child Abduction is Not Funny


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Kenny died with the winning ticket to a prize of endless candy in his pocket. The boys decide to build a ladder to Heaven where they expect to find him and get the ticket back.

script:A Ladder to Heaven

[South Park, city sidewalk, day. Stan, Cartman and Kyle head for a bright, colorful store called "Lolly's Candy Factory." Cartman carries three buckets: two on his back, supported by a crossbar, and a huge one on his head. The proprietor, Lolly, opens the door and sets a sign so it reads "OPEN," thus starting his business day. On his red apron is a large yellow lollipop with "LOLLY" printed over it. The boys stop and look.]
LOLLY
[notices the kids and straightens up] Oh, hello there, kids! Welcome to Lolly's Candy Shop.
STAN
We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree!
LOLLY
Oh that's great!
CARTMAN
You bet your fat clown ass it is!
LOLLY
Okay! Well I'll just need your ticket stub.
CARTMAN
[the boys' jaws drop a bit] ...ticket stub?
LOLLY
You know. When you entered the contest you got the other half of this ticket. [display the store's half of the ticket]
STAN
Oh shit. Who had the ticket stub?
KYLE
It was such a long time ago!
CARTMAN
Wu-we don't really "need" the ticket stub, do we?
LOLLY
Don't need the ticket stub?? Are you high?? How else do I know you're the winners?
STAN
Because our names were called on the commercial last night!
LOLLY
Sh-orry boys. No ticket stub, no candy shopping spree. If you find it, you can come back, but you only have one week to claim the prize. That's called "The Ticking Clock." Works great in the movies. [steps backwards into the store and closes the door. The boys look at the door for a few seconds, then Cartman turns and steps forward]
CARTMAN
[drops the buckets] GODDAMMIT!!!
STAN
We've gotta find that ticket!
KYLE
Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember.
CARTMAN
You guys we've got to focus! We've got to focus, and remember. [Zoom in on Cartman, who starts remembering...]
[Lolly's Candy Factory, over a year ago. Kenny is still alive back then.]
LOLLY
[hands a ticket stub to Stan] All right. There you go. Hold on to that ticket stub. You'll need it to claim your prize. [looks at the rest of the store] Sign up for the five-minute shopping spree!! [walks off]
STAN
[hands the stub to Cartman] You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it.
CARTMAN
[takes it, then hands it to Kyle] Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle.
KYLE
Okay. [takes it, then has second thoughts] N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. [hands the stub to Kenny]
KENNY
(Okay.) [takes it and pockets it]
[Back to the present. The boys realize Kenny was the last to hold the stub as their mouths open.]
CARTMAN
[bolts away] Kenny!!!
STAN, KYLE
[following quickly] AAAHHH!! [the buckets stay on the ground and the boys rush to Kenny's house]
[Kenny's house, later. The boys arrive gasping for air and Kyle rings the doorbell.]
STUART
[opens the door] Yes?
STAN
Where's Kenny??
STUART
Uh... boys... Kenny died ...last December. Don't you remember?
KYLE
We know he's dead. We mean, where is his body??
CAROL
His body? Well, why??
CARTMAN
Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-!
STAN
[shuts Cartman up quick and stumbles for words] Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure.
KYLE
Yeah. Closure.
CARTMAN
[muffled] What the fuck is closure?!
CAROL
Oh all right boys. Come on in. [the boys follow the McCormicks in]
[Kenny's house, inside. The boys follow the parents through the house.]
STUART
We haven't seen you boys for so long, we thought you'd forgotten all about him.
CAROL
Here he is, boys. Our dear little Kenny. [an urn is shown, with pictures of Kenny on either side of it.]
CARTMAN
You turned him into a teapot?
STUART
No. That's an urn, boys. Kenny's inside it.
CAROL
Your friends are here to see you, Kenny. [picks up the urn and caresses it.] They miss you an awful lot, like we all do. [starts crying]
STUART
Thang-thanks for coming by, boys. Ih-ih, it means a lot to us. [turns to his wife and consoles her] Aw now, honey. [joins her in sobbing]
[Kenny's house, nighttime, living room. A circle appears on a window and that piece of window is removed. Cartman sets the circle down and looks around. He reaches up to open the window latch, then opens the window door. He slips in and goes for the urn. He pulls out a fake detector and moves it around.]
CARTMAN
Wewewewewewe...
STAN
[climbs up to the window and looks in] Did you get it? [Kyle climbs up next to him]
CARTMAN
Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards. [resumes the detection] Wewewewewewe...
KYLE
There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny! [Cartman looks back at the boys angrily, gets Kenny's urn, and climbs back out the window. Seconds later, a robot guard does indeed move through the living room...]
ROBOT GUARD
Wewewewewewe...
[Cartman's house, night, kitchen. The boys rush to the counter and climb up on the stools.]
KYLE
Alright, we made it!
STAN
Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there!
KYLE
Let him out, Cartman! [Cartman opens the urn and the boys duck]
CARTMAN
...Kenny? [the boys lose their fear and rise up to look at the urn] Kenny?!
KYLE
Is he in there?
STAN
I can't see. [Cartman pours out the ashes and the boys sneeze from the fine powder until it dissipates. Some ash smudges remain on their faces.]
CARTMAN
What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?!
KYLE
I knew Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot! [Cartman samples the ashes]
STAN
It was a trick!
CARTMAN
God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix!
STAN
Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!
KYLE
Why would they play such a cruel joke on us?
CARTMAN
Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?!
STAN
We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over! [gets off his stool and walks away.]
KYLE
Goddamnit! There has to be a way! [leaves his stool and follows Stan out. Cartman looks at the ashes, then thinks of something]
CARTMAN
Hmmm. [leaves his stool and returns with some milk, a glass, and a spoon. He scoops up some ashes and drops them into the glass. He pours the milk onto the ashes, stirs them up, and drinks the milk ] Hmm, not bad. [scoops some more ashes into the milk]
[Cartman's room, night. The empty glass sits on his nightstand. The camera zooms out to show Cartman sleeping with Clyde Frog. Cartman tosses in his bed and his dream appears. A circle appears. Outside of the circle is a lining to a jacket. Inside is someone's point of view. The surroundings seen in that circle indicates that this is Kenny's point of view. Kenny seems to be walking around in his own room. Kenny's arm appears and opens the door, and Kenny's mom appears at the end of the hall.]
CAROL
Hurry up, Kenny! You're gonna be late for school! [the dream ends abruptly]
CARTMAN
[sits up, eyes wide open] Huh! ... I don't think that chocolate milk mix agreed with my stomach. [growls a bit, turns to sleep, and farts. The door flies open and Stan and Kyle rush in]
STAN
Cartman, come on!
CARTMAN
[sits up again] What what? [sees who it is] Jesus, you buttholes! It's six in the morning!
STAN
Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!
CARTMAN
How?
KYLE
A ladder to heaven. [unfolds some blueprints] We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny.
[Stan's house, day. The blueprints are in place on an easel. The design is a slender tower rising some 120 feet into the sky. The camera pulls back to show the boys hammering boards into place. Stan's parents step outside to see the construction.]
RANDY
Hey, if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor.
STAN
[going for some more wood] We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven.
RANDY
A ladder to heaven? Why, son?
STAN
Because we wanna see Kenny again. [heaves a piece of wood back to the tower]
SHARON
[after a moment of though] Oh... oh, that's so sweet.
RANDY
That's the ...s-s-saddest thing I've ever heard.
JIMBO
[approaching] Hey Randy, can I borrow your uh... [sees the boys' activity] What the hell are they doing?
RANDY
The boys wanna see their dead friend Kenny again, Jimbo, so they're... building a ladder to heaven.
JIMBO
Awwww.
SHEILA
[arriving with Gerald] Kyle, I think you've bothered the Marshes enough.
RANDY
No, it's... alright, Sheila. The boys were just... building a ladder to heaven to see their old friend, Kenny.
GERALD
A ladder tuh... Oh... oh God. [begins to sob]
SHEILA
Oh, that's so touching. [begins to sob. All the adults begin to cry. The boys continue building]
[Behind Stan's house, day. A reporter has arrived and now begins his report.]
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where last December, eight-year-old Kenny McCormick died of a terminal illness. But now, that little boy's three closest friends miss their friend so much that they are building a ladder to heaven, in order to- [chokes as the camera reaches the tower, then gathers himself] a ladder to heaven in order to try to see him again. [sighs] It's so sad and yet so beautiful, Tom. Here's what some people had to say.
RANDY
Well, our son just said to us that he really needed to see his little friend Kenny again and... and that he thought it would work... [begins to break down] if he... built the ladder to heaven.
SHEILA
[sobbing] They just believe in their little hearts that it will work. We can't tell them it won't, we just can't!
JIMBO
[wistful] It shows how beautiful the innocence of a child really is. [starts sobbing. Other people are show crying: Marietta Kitchin, Carrie Ayers & Steve Stegman]
MR. GARRISON
A ladder to heaven? That's fuckin' stupid.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
[sobbing with her aides] These boys symbolize how we all feel about loss. Who are we to tell them it's impossible?
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, people from all over the- [chokes] Sorry. [gets back on track] People from all over the country are coming to see the ladder, feeling a connection to its symbolism, and beauty. Even country singer Alan Jackson has shown up with a song he has written about the ladder. [camera pulls back to show Jackson to the reporter's left, strumming a guitar] Alan Jackson is, of course, the man who wrote the song, "Where Were You When the World Stopped Turning," about the tragedies on September 11. And now he's here once again to capitalize on people's emotions. Let's listen in. [focus shifts to Jackson]
ALAN JACKSON
Where were you when they built the ladder to heaven?
Did it make you feel like cryin', or did you think it was kind of gay?
TOWNSMAN
What a beautiful song. [the boys look down at Jackson]
ALAN JACKSON
Well I, for one, believe in the ladder to heaven.
Oh yeah yeah yeah. 9-11
[the townsfolk begin to cry]
I said 9-11, 9-11, 9-11, Ni-hi, hi-hine___
Eleven.

Thank you! I have a new CD out with all my 9-11 songs for sale right here! [the crowd rushes in to get copies of the CD. Jackson is pleased at the interest. The boys resume their construction. Stan and Kyle are hammering away at the top of the ladder. Cartman hustles up the ladder with a car seat]
KYLE
Oh good! Cartman's back from the junkyard.
CARTMAN
I found this car seat in Mr. Garrison's car. [hands it to the other two boys, who put it in place]
STAN
Mr. Garrison threw away his car?
CARTMAN
...No. [the boys let the seat drop] Ey! Euuugh.
[Flashback #2 - resumes where the first one left off. Kenny seems to be walking around in his own room. Kenny's arm appears and opens the door, and Kenny's mom appears at the end of the hall.]
CAROL
Hurry up, Kenny! You're gonna be late for school! [the dream ends abruptly]
STUART
Kenny, do you by any chance know what happened to my Playboys? [shows Kenny a centerfold, which shows a circle where the centerfold's crotch should be. He lifts the centerfold high enough to look through the hole] Kenny?! Answer me!! [back to the present - Cartman looks dazed]
KYLE
Cartman? Cartman?!
CARTMAN
[startled] Wha-uh, what?? What?
KYLE
Dude, what the hell's wrong with you?!
CARTMAN
I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off.
KYLE
Maybe you got brain cancer.
CARTMAN
Do you think?
STAN
Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it!
[SNN newscast. Graphics are shown indicating 74% of Americans believe in the ladder.]
SNN REPORTER
The nation is rallying behind three sweet boys in Colorado who are building a ladder to heaven to be with their dead friend. [a picture of the boys on the ladder is shown] It's making Americans start to believe in heaven, again. [next segment has the reporter out on the street]
WOMAN 1
Well when I see how this ladder has brought people together, how... how it has changed America, I mean, how can I not believe?
SNN REPORTER
[off screen] Ha do YOU actually believe in the ladder to heaven?
FAT MAN
If... heaven is an eight-year-old boy, and the ladder is my penis... [the camera moves away quickly, but the man keeps up] and the pearly gates are the- [static... the camera pulls back to show the reporter back at the desk, holding a TV status pattern on paper and hissing. He notices the camera and stops, putting the pattern down]
SNN REPORTER
Uh, meanwhile, the American economy cont- [gets some breaking news over his headset] wait. Wait. Wait a minute. We are getting reports now that Japan is building their own ladder to heaven to compete with the US's. Let's go live to SNN correspondent Nobuhiro Sabasurisurijuwa.
SNN CORRESPONDENT
This is a Nobunaga Hiroichi reporting rive from Tokyo, where Japan has started buirding its own radder to hayben. [the tower is shown with klieg lights bathing it in light] Ahready, the Japanese radder extend faaar into space [the ladder is now high enough for a space shuttle to park by and astronauts come out to work on it] and it's growing by a-one thousand miles every day. [back on the ground...] As the endeavor continues it is becoming clear that Japan will reach a-hayben before the United States. [a raspberry follows]
[South Park, just past sunset. The neighbors have gathered around the ladder in Stan's back yard and are now singing.]
NEIGHBORS
Nahurabo Nahurabo
STAN
Excuse me. ["Nahurabo"] Excuse me! ["Nahurabo"] Uh, we ran out of stuff. [the singing abruptly stops] We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with.
MAN 1
Oh no!
WOMAN 2
Oh Jesus, no!
ALAN JACKSON
Where were you when they ran out of stuff to build the ladder to heaven?
STAN
We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood.
RANDY
[raises his arms high] No! Agh, look, I, I think maybe this has gone on far enough.
GERALD
Yeah... Ih it's time we told the boys the truth, that they aren't really going to get to heaven. [a truck is heard arriving]
MAN 2
[at the back, by the fence] Wait! Look! [a fleet of trucks, cars, and jeeps converge on the road outside the house]
GENERAL
We've come to help you beat those Japs, boys! [behind him, military personnel bring out ladders and other construction equipment] There won't be anyone stopping this great ladder from being built today! [the crowd cheers wildly. The boys' parents are dumbstruck] Alpha Team! Get that support structure up! Ciranom's Team! Get us photos and recon! [the teams set about their duties]
SOLDIERS
Yes sir!
ALAN JACKSON
Where were you when they saved that ladder to heaven?
KYLE
[with Cartman at the top of the ladder] Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back.
CARTMAN
Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle.
[South Park, next day. The boys resume building the ladder, and they almost break through the cloud above them. Stan is the first to peer over the clouds. Kyle soon joins him.]
KYLE
Do you see anything?
STAN
No. Hello?? Kenny?? God??
KYLE
Grandma??
CARTMAN
[joins the other two boys, grunting as he gets into position] Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet!
STAN
No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off.
CARTMAN
Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough.
KYLE
Huh?
CARTMAN
Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them.
STAN
What??
CARTMAN
You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O.
KYLE
[processes the comment and gets angry] What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?!
CARTMAN
Because Jews don't believe in heaven!
KYLE
Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!
CARTMAN
Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it.
KYLE
[Lose his temper via short temper] HAAHH!!! [smacks Cartman on the side of the face with his left fist]
CARTMAN
AH! [stunned, he has another flashback. A heartbeat is heard]
[Flashback #2 - Kenny arrives at the bus stop.]
KYLE
Hey Kenny.
STAN
Hey Kenny.
KENNY
(We can watch it at my house.)
CARTMAN
In the ghetto, in the ghetto. He's a boy wearing orange, who's losing his pride, 'cause Kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto, in the ghetto
KENNY
[points an accusing finger at Cartman] (Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)
CARTMAN
What did you say?!
KENNY
(I said, Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)
CARTMAN
What did you say?!
CARTMAN
[in the present] I said "Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!" [opens his eyes and looks around] Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina?
STAN
Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??
CARTMAN
I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes.
KYLE
You're too fat to be Kenny.
CARTMAN
[amid his thoughts] You're a- stupid Jew.
STAN
Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree.
[The White House, Washington D.C., moments later. George Bush arrives at the Oval Office and takes his seat at the executive desk.]
BUSH
Alright, how's the ladder going, General? Are we beating the Japanese?
GENERAL
Not quite, but we have a new problem, Mr. President. Our recon team on the ladder just found new evidence of threats... from Saddam Hussein.
BUSH
Saddam Hussein? But... we killed him! We secretly took him out months ago!
GENERAL
Yes sir. And now we believe he's building weapons of mass destruction... in heaven.
BUSH
Dear Christ, that sonofabitch just doesn't stop!
GENERAL
[flips a page on an easel, showing another page with three identical photos] These surveillance photos were taken atop the ladder of what appears to be heaven. [points out an encircled object in the center photo] Here we see what we believe to be a missile silo. And here [points out an encircled object in the lower photo] we see what looks like a laboratory of some sort for making chemical weapons.
DICK CHENEY
That... kinda looks like a seagull.
GENERAL
Yes. It could be a laboratory disguised as a seagull.
BUSH
That tricky bastard!
GENERAL
Sir, you must understand our fears. We must take out those facilities. We must... [close-up] bomb heaven!
[SNN newsroom, new poll.]
SNN REPORTER
SNN Question of the Day: Now that Americans believe in heaven, should we bomb it? The polls right now show that 51% of Americans think Saddam has to be dealt with, while 49% are wimpy tree-hugging pussies.
WAR PROTESTER
[in tie-dye shirt, waving a "No War On Heaven" sign] War is not my voice! This country is just run by rednecks and bumpkins with their guns!
REDNECK
[with baby dangling from the left hand, rifle firmly in the right hand] We have to take Saddam out to protect ourselves.
FAT MAN
I, for one, believe that if Saddam Hussein were an eight-year-old boy, and my penis were the United States... [the mic is retracted] then there would- [the cameraman tries to avoid the man, but nope] hard nipples!
SNN REPORTER
[back in the newsroom] God-damnit! [holds up the snow pattern and hisses]
[News 4 field report.]
FIELD REPORTER
Tom, it's been five days since three sweet boys set out to build a ladder to heaven and capture the nation's hearts. They've made a nation believe heaven might be up there. And it could prove to be a threat to our country. President Bush will seek UN approval for military action.
[The Marsh home, day. The boys' ladder is seen rising above the house, in the backyard. In the dining room, the boys' parents sit opposite the boys at the table.]
RANDY
Boys, it's really neat that you want to see your old pal Kenny so much but...
GERALD
But it's time for you to get back to school and on with your lives.
STAN
No, we have to see Kenny!
SHARON
You have to understand that Kenny's body isn't up in the clouds. He was cremated.
STAN
Cremated? What's that?
RANDY
When you die, your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes. [the boys are alarmed]
KYLE
What?? For God's sake, why??
SHEILA
[half-annoyed] Kyle, it's just what some people do.
KYLE
Are you gonna burn me?
GERALD
Kyle, that's not the issue right now.
KYLE
Jesus Christ!
RANDY
The person's ashes are put into an urn, and that's where Kenny's body is.
CAROL
You see boys, Kenny is in here. [opens the urn and pours out the contents, which are white now. Carol notices] What the??? [looks inside the urn] Wait a minute! This is kitty litter!
CARTMAN
[resigned, comes clean] Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter.
STUART
You WHAT??
STAN
Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!
CARTMAN
[knowingly] Shut up!
KYLE
You did, dude! You drank his whole body!
CARTMAN
[knowingly] Shut up!
CAROL
Oh my God! This is awful! [starts moving away. The other adults follow] And disgusting!
LIANE
[stops and looks at Cartman] Bad, Eric, bad! [moves away]
CARTMAN
That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me.
STAN
Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny! [leaves the table]
KYLE
Yeah. Good job, fatass! [leaves the table]
CARTMAN
I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body.
[Day, Unplanned Parenthood, a place where they remove living souls from a pregnant woman's body, if you believe fetuses have souls... Cartman speaks to the nurse, who is sitting behind a desk writing absentmindedly.]
CARTMAN
Looks like I've come to the right place.
NURSE
Can I help you?
CARTMAN
Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that I need sucked out, please.
NURSE
You'll have to make an appointment; the charge is two hundred and thirty dollars.
CARTMAN
Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium! [a woman and her boyfriend enter the clinic. The woman sobs]
BOYFRIEND
It's gonna be okay, babe.
CARTMAN
Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me! [the woman can't believe what she's hearing] I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out!
WOMAN
Oh Steven, I can't go through with this! I have to keep it! [walks away from the clinic]
STEVEN
Damnit! Damnit! [turns and walks off, then looks back in] Thanks a lot, kid! [throws a rock at Cartman]
CARTMAN
Eh! [becomes catatonic once more, and another flashback comes]
[The scene is the sidewalk. Stan, Cartman and Kyle run up to Kenny.]
CARTMAN
Kenny! Kenny! Kenny...
STAN
Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree! [the last few words echo a few times]
KYLE
We're all gonna pitch in on an entry! [the last few words echo a few times. Fast forward to the day the boys are at Lolly's]
LOLLY
Alright! [rips a ticket in half and hands the stub to Stan] There you go. Hold on to that ticket stub. [the last few words echo a few times. He gives the ticket to Stan and walks off]
STAN
[hands the stub to Cartman] Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. [the last few words echo a few times]
CARTMAN
[takes it, then hands it to Kyle] Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle, of it, Kyle, of it Kyle...
KYLE
Okay. [takes it, then has second thoughts] N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. [the last word echoes a few times. He hands the stub to Kenny]
KENNY
(Okay!) [the word echoes a few times. He takes it and pockets it. Fast forward to some time later, on the sidewalk]
CARTMAN
You'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I'll kick you in the nuts! The nuts! The nuts! [fast forward to Kenny's room. He walks to a locked box by the window while looking at the ticket stub. He unlocks it, puts the ticket in, and locks the box again.]
[Back to the present. Cartman comes to and knows where to go.]
CARTMAN
The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on him when he died! He put it away somewhere! [walks up to a couple filling out paperwork] Don't you see? I can still have my candy shopping spree! Oh my God! [heads out the door] You guys! YOU GUYS!!
[The United Nations, day. In the main hall President Bush is speaking to the Assembly.]
BUSH
Ladies and gentlemen of the UN, we have evidence that Saddam Hussein is up there building weapons of mass destruction. [shows a picture of the ladder and another one of the clouds. Both pictures have areas circled in] We have tried to communicate with Saddam through a psychic to ask him to let us see his warehouses in heaven. But he has not "re-spond-ed".
INDIAN AMBASSADOR
Of course he has not responded, because he's DEAD!
BUSH
Right. Dead, and in heaven.
AMBASSADOR #1
This is preposterous! Even if there was a heaven, what makes you think Saddam Hussein's soul would be sent there?
BUSH
Our intelligence tells us that when Saddam was originally killed, his soul actually went to hell. But while in hell he began a homosexual relationship with Satan, the Prince of Darkness. Satan, however, decided he didn't want to be with Hussein anymore and broke up with him around August. [the French Ambassador has tuned out] When Saddam became jealous and tried to kill Satan's new lover, Chris, Satan had Saddam sent to heaven to live with Mormons as a punishment. [the assembly is overcome with silence] Questions? [more silence. An ambassador raises his hand] Yes?
AMBASSADOR #2
Are you high, or just incredibly stupid?
BUSH
I assure you, I am not high.
[South Park, day. A tower has gone up around the ladder at the Marsh house. Helicopters and cranes hoist. On the ground Stan and Kyle sit on some lumber watching the military take over the construction. Cartman runs up to them.]
CARTMAN
You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket! [Stan and Kyle rise and line up on either side of Cartman]
KYLE
What do you mean, fatass?
CARTMAN
I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere.
STAN
Where??
CARTMAN
I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic [Kyle looks down at the lumber, then looks at the pile behind him] and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box. [Kyle fishes around for a small solid piece of lumber, then finds one and aims it at Cartman's head] I just have to wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken- [thunk] AY! [is dazed for a bit, then recovers none too pleased, then glares at Kyle]
KYLE
Do you see anything?
CARTMAN
Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW! [starts at Kyle, but Stan holds him back]
STAN
Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.
CARTMAN
Not by giving me brain damage!
STAN
Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!
CARTMAN
[stares at Stan, then resigns to his former position] Alright, go ahead. [Kyle rears back and swings... thunk] AY!... no. [Kyle rears back and swings... thunk] AY!...
[Near the back of the house. The neighbors are watching the construction. Sharon and Sheila arrive.]
SHARON
Randy! Gerald! We, we were wrong about heaven! The Japanese just reached it with their ladder!
RANDY
What? [follows the ladies out with Gerald]
[Living room, seconds later.]
SHARON
See for yourself!
[The SNN Japanese correspondent is on camera.]
NOBUNAGA HIROICHI
This is a Nobunaga Hiroichi reporting rive from hayben. [behind him is a set with clouds hanging from wires. Angels swing into place slowly] The great a-nation of Japan reached a-hayben today about eight o'crock Pacific Standard Time-eh. [one of the angels falls off her rope and hits the ground. The correspondent sees this and moves in front of her to block the shot. Someone enters the shot and plants a Japanese flag among the clouds] Therefore, hayben is now a-decrared an official part of Japan, because we got a-here first. And now for the weather in heaben, let's go to Natsako Semu.
NATSAKO SEMU
Todeh weather in hebon, partry croudy.
NOBUNAGA
[fairly gloating] That's the news from heben. [the set creaks behind him and falls down, showing the studio.] Dame! Dame da! Bakayarou da!! ["No good! It's no good! Idiots!"]
[Living room, seconds later.]
RANDY
Oh God, and we told our boys they'd never reach heaven.
GERALD
Kids!
[Backyard. The crowd in and around the yard is immense now. George Bush and his staff are present.]
BUSH
Good. As soon as the boys finish their ladder we'll be ready to take Saddam out.
SHARON
Do you really think this is a good idea, Randy?
RANDY
If Saddam is building weapons, we have to stop him. With our weapons. [behind the crowd Cartman, Stan and Kyle return with buckets of candy. That conking finally worked]
STAN
Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done. [everyone turns to look at the boys]
SOME GUY
Dude.
GENERAL
Not working on the ladder? But the Japanese won't let us use theirs.
KYLE
Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home.
RANDY
Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy??
CARTMAN
...I've never heard the words "only" and "candy" in the same sentence before.
FIELD REPORTER
But... what about your lost friend? What about your fragile innocence and believing we could all get to heaven?
STAN
Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels...
KYLE
Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now.
GENERAL
So, you're saying we should bomb this moment, right now. Right! Johnson!
JOHNSON
Sir!
RANDY
No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These boys are right. The only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth, now. We should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to... create it.
CROWD
Awwww. [the crowd begins to disperse and people begin to cry in appreciation]
BUSH
[moving off with his staff] And I was dumb enough to believe Saddam could actually be up there buildin' bombs.
ALAN JACKSON
Where were you when they decided heaven was a more intangible idea 'n you couldn't, you couldn't really get there? [walks up to the boys] You little bastards ruined my latest song! [drives his guitar into the snow, breaking it, then walks away]
KYLE
Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy.
STAN
Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.
CARTMAN
[chuckles] No no, I just drank his memories. I'm not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat dick! [looks stunned] ...Oh Jesus Christ.
KYLE
Whoa. [shakes Cartman around] Kenny, you in there?
CARTMAN
Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God! [runs off]
STAN
Dude, come back here! [chases after Cartman]
KYLE
Stop him, Kenny! [follows them off. The camera suddenly pans up]
[Heaven. Weapons of mass destruction are seen among the clouds. Saddam is right there shouting directions.]
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Keep those nitrogen capsules over there by the warheads! Right. Chop-chop. Come on!
GOD
[a bright beam of light lands on Saddam, who shields his eyes] Saddam. I've been hearing rumors that you're secretly building weapons of mass destruction up here.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Weapons of mass destruction? Nooo! This is a chocolate chip factory. See? [displays boxes of "Saddam's Heavenly Chocolate Chips"]
GOD
It looks like a chemical weapons plant.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Look, God, if I was gonna secretly build a chemical weapons plant, I wouldn't make it look like a chemical weapons plant, would I? I'd make it look like a chocolate chip factory or something.
GOD
...Alright, just checking. [removes the beam of light]
SADDAM HUSSEIN
[giggles] Stupid asshole! [goes back to work]
End of A Ladder to Heaven


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The boys embark upon a mythical quest as they set out to return their copy of the "The Lord of the Rings" movie to their local video store.

script:The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers

[Marsh residence, night. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman stand in the living room in costume.]
STAN
O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?
CARTMAN
Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now!
KYLE
That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one!
RANDY
[entering] Uh, boys, [the boys look up] Butters' parents want to borrow The Lord of the Rings video we rented. Could you take it over to them?
STAN
You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?
RANDY
Yeah, whatever.
CARTMAN
It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.
KYLE
But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it?
STAN
[reaches out and receives the tape] Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors!
STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
Ho! [they head out the front door. Randy moves away from the stairs and towards Sharon on the sofa]
RANDY
[snuggles up to her] Hmmm, that gets rid of them.
SHARON
Oooh, you're a little frisky, aren't you?
RANDY
Yeah, well uh, The Lord of the Rings wasn't the only thing I rented from the video store. [holds up a VHS case] I also rented... a porno.
SHARON
Oho, you little devil.
RANDY
[softly, sensually] You wanna go watch?
[Neighborhood streets. The boys are well into their quest.]
STAN
How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog?
KYLE
[notices something and gasps] Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph!
CARTMAN
Don't worry! I am the great wizard Motortart. I can shield us from the dragon's fire. [a car passes by and Cartman fires away at it with his staff]
STAN
Good job, wizard.
CARTMAN
And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and the covetous Jew.
KYLE
I'm a Paladin, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Jews can't be Paladins.
[Marsh residence; bedroom. Randy waxes his eyebrows with saliva getting ready for a night of porno. Sharon appears in a ruby lingerie, leans suggestively against the doorway of the master bathroom and runs her finger along the bedroom wall. Randy takes the porno to the TV.]
SHARON
Hey there, cowboy.
RANDY
[holds up the video and turns to Sharon] You ready for some hot, steamy fun?
SHARON
[smiling, right index finger against her chin] You bet I am.
RANDY
The guys at the office told me I had to rent this porno. They said, "this is without a doubt the hottest porno ever made." [puts the video into the player]
SHARON
[now reclining on the bed, running her finger along the bedsheets] Mmm, sounds good.
RANDY
I love that lingerie. [opens his nightgown to reveal a purple cod piece, then in a low voice] Yeah. You like that?
SHARON
Mm, yeah baby.
RANDY
Yeeaahhh. [reclines on the bed, facing her and holding the remote control] Alright, you ready?
SHARON
Ready.
RANDY
Oh, yeah. [they turn to the TV. Randy starts the video]
NARRATOR
[the video begins. Randy massages Sharon's arm] The story begins in ages past, in the deep regions of Middle-earth, where Scorn first thrived in the kingdom of Gelgelar.
RANDY
Aw man, I hate when pornos try to have a story.
NARRATOR
Seven rings were cast and given to the races of Men.
RANDY
Oh yeah. [begins caressing Sharon]
NARRATOR
Seven, to the races of Elves, five to the gloondock villagers of Gelgendor. [Sharon takes a good look at the video]
SHARON
Wow, the production values are really good in this porno. [Randy takes a look]
RANDY
Yeah, it almost looks like... The Lord of the-- [jumps up and sits on the bed, aghast] Oh, my God! [quickly rises and turns off the TV, gets the video out, and reads] This is Lord of the Rings!
SHARON
But then that mean..?
RANDY
The boys have the hottest porno ever made.
[Stotch residence. The boys approach. Kyle knocks, Stephen and Linda open the front door.]
STEPHEN
Oh, hello boys.
STAN
My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings.
STEPHEN
Well, thank you very much, kind heroes.
CARTMAN
Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense?
STEPHEN
Oh, but you are noble heroes. We know our thanks is enough. [closes the door. The boys leave]
CARTMAN
Man, that's crap.
[Basement. Butters is drawing something on paper. His parents descend with video in hand.]
STEPHEN
Butters, [Butters stands up] look what we have for you to watch: The Lord of the Rings.
BUTTERS
[rushes up to meet his parents] Oh, boy! Finally I get to see it!
LINDA
Now Daddy and I have to do our taxes, so you can watch this by yourself and not get scared?
BUTTERS
Ah I won't get scared, Mom. Promise!
STEPHEN
That's our man. Here you go. [hands the tape to Butters, who goes to the VCR and puts the tape in. The parents leave]
BUTTERS
Ooh la lolly! I finally get to see Lord of the Rings. [the video begins to play. A man and a woman are heard]
EVAN STONE
[softly] Spank that ass. [a few seconds later, a spanking is heard]
BUTTERS
Whoa. [more sounds from the video] Neat-o. [more sounds, a few spankings] Well, this is good.
[Marsh car. Randy drives, Sharon worries. They have donned pajamas and thrown on coats.]
SHARON
Oh my God, this is gonna be so embarrassing. "Hi, Chris. Hi, Linda. We were just wondering if we could get our porno back." [buries her face in her right hand]
RANDY
Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet.
[The woods. As Randy and Sharon head for Butters' house, the boys walk home through backwoods.]
CARTMAN
And so the party returns home after completing their great quest.
STAN
The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace. [a few seconds later some headlights shine on them]
KYLE
Quick! A monster of Rivendell!
CARTMAN
Prepare for battle! [switch to the car]
SHARON
The boys! [Randy drives up to the boys and stops. Both he and Sharon jump out and rush up to them]
RANDY
Boys! Boys! [stops] Where's the videotape?
STAN
We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you.
SHARON
Awgh, I guess we have to go talk to 'em now.
RANDY
Well, wait a minute, uhhh, boys, do you think you can go get that tape back for us really fast? [the boys look at each other]
CARTMAN
This sounds like a really important quest.
RANDY
Yes, it is. It is more important than anything I've ever asked you to do. You must retrieve the tape. But do not look at it, uh, for it... holds an evil power! Retrieve the tape, and return it to us at home. [falling into a fantasy accent] Do this, and you will be greatly rewarded.
STAN
Woww.
CARTMAN
This... is so cool.
KYLE
[turns left] Gentlemen, we are off! [the boys turn back to walk to Butters' house. Randy watches them leave]
RANDY
[rises and looks at Sharon] Okay, problem solved.
[Stotch residence; basement, moments later. Butters is looking at more of the video. He has a surprised expression on his face. Steamy action is heard.]
WOMAN
...Oh my God, I'm so... Mmmm, mmm...
BUTTERS
Oh golly. [his legs part and he points to his crotch] Hey, what's happening down there? [the basement door is heard opening and closing. Butters is fascinated by his body's reaction. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman come down the stairs. Butters reaches for his crotch for tactile inspection]
STAN
We have come to reclaim the one tape! [Butters sits up and Kyle goes for the tape]
BUTTERS
[walks up to Kyle] Wha-wha, what are you doing?! [Kyle removes it and puts it into the LotR case it came in]
KYLE
[walks off. Butters is saddened] The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.
BUTTERS
But it's the greatest movie I have ever seen. You guys were right. Lord of the Rings is awesome. Eh, you have to let me finish watching it.
CARTMAN
Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan'ses house. [the boys head up the stairs and out of the house. Butters opens the door and jumps at them]
[Butters' house, outside.]
BUTTERS
Bwaagghh! [falls on his face, then quickly gets up and retreats]
KYLE
Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest!
BUTTERS
Well, then... then let me go with you.
KYLE
Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings. [Little does Kyle know what Butters' idea of LotR is. The boys turn to walk away]
BUTTERS
Wuh, okay. [Butters jumps on Kyle's left arm and starts making love to it] Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah.
KYLE
[glares at Butters] Butters, what the hell are you doing?!
BUTTERS
[a bit surprised] Playing Lord of the Rings. [resumes the love-making] Ugh, wegh, oh yeah.
KYLE
[smacks Butters with the tape, causing him to fall off] Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us!
BUTTERS
[on hands and knees, with renewed determination] Let me have the tape!
STAN
[takes the tape from Kyle] No, we have to return it! [the boys turn to walk away again. Butters crawls a few inches]
BUTTERS
My movie! [sorrowfully reaches out for it with left hand] My awesome cool movie. My... precious.
[The woods, night. The boys retrace their steps through the backwoods.]
CARTMAN
And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house.
KYLE
This copy of Lord of the Rings made the young Butters behave quite oddly.
STAN
Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too.
CARTMAN
Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen. [three older boys ride up on their bikes and stop before the group. It's the sixth graders]
SIXTH GRADER LEADER
[gets off his bike and approaches the boys] Well, well, well! If it isn't Robin Hood and his Merry Men!
KYLE
Oh, crap, the sixth graders!
SIXTH GRADER LEADER
Whatcha got there?
STAN
Nothing. [the sixth grader rips the tape out of Stan's hand] Hey, kid!
SIXTH GRADER LEADER
[looks at the case] Lord of the Rings? Ha! That movie's gay!
CARTMAN
You're gay!
SIXTH GRADER LEADER
[opens the case and looks at the tape] What the--? [reads the title: "Back Door Sluts 9" XXX] Whoa! [backs up to show the tape to his friends] Check it out, you guys!
SIXTH GRADERS 2 AND 3
Whoa!
STAN
Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents!
SIXTH GRADER LEADER
[approaches menacingly with the tape. Stan backs up] No way! We're keepin' this and watchin' it ourselves!
KYLE
You can't keep it.
SIXTH GRADER LEADER
And what are three little fourth graders gonna do about it, huh?!
STAN
There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body!
CARTMAN
Yeah!
SIXTH GRADER LEADER
Oh man, I can't wait to see this!
KYLE
[aside to Stan] Dude, that video is making people act strange.
CARTMAN
The one tape must be returned! [swats the tape out of the sixth grader's hands with the staff and watches as the tape falls into Stan's hands] Run! [the boys run away from the sixth graders]
SIXTH GRADER LEADER
Get 'em! [his two friends ride off after the boys. He picks up his bike and joins his friends]
[Stotch residence. Randy and Sharon have arrived, and Randy knocks on the door. Stephen answers the door again.]
STEPHEN
Oh, hello, Randy, Sharon.
RANDY
Uh... Chris, are the boys over here?
LINDA
No, just Butters. He's been watching The Lord of the Rings downstairs.
SHARON
Oh, dear!
STEPHEN
What's the matter?
RANDY
We... [now nervous] Well, this is really sort of funny, but uh, we, we accidentally put a...porno in The Lord of the Rings box. [Sharon shrugs, and both of them smile sheepishly]
LINDA
Ohh God!! [the Stotches panic and rush downstairs. The Marshes follow]
[Basement. Chris, Linda, Randy and Sharon enter. The TV is still on, but there's static. Butters isn't around.]
STEPHEN
Butters?
LINDA
Butters? [they notice the television] Butters!
BUTTERS
[peeks out from behind the sofa, in the shadow, then speaks in a raspy voice] The precious? [his parents turn to see him] Could you bring back my precious?
STEPHEN
Butters, where is the movie you were watching?
BUTTERS
[crawls out into view] They took his precious, took it away to watch without him. [sits up and puts his hands on his knees] He was really enjoying that movie, too! My... precious.
RANDY
The boys must've come and saw what it was and... then taken it away somewhere.
SHARON
[gravely] Oh, no. [Stephen and Linda look back at them]
[The woods, later. The camera moves from a clearing to a tree with a large root shading a pocket underneath. The boys come into view.]
KYLE
We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.
CARTMAN
I must say I agree. If this copy of The Lord of the Rings is tainted, it would not be safe in the wrong hands.
SIXTH GRADER LEADER
[nearby, off screen] I smell fourth graders!
STAN
Oh crap, dude!
KYLE
Hide! [they jump over the massive root and hide in the pocket underneath. The lead sixth grader comes into view and sniffs the air. He hops off and looks around over the root. The boys look up in apprehension. The sixth grader sniffs around above them]
SIXTH GRADER 1
[off screen] Hey. [the lead sixth grader whips around and goes to see who it is. It's his friend, in brown cap] I think I see something down the hill. [the lead sixth grader looks in that direction, then the sixth graders take off. The boys express relief after a few seconds]
STAN
Ogh. [Cartman sighs silently]
KYLE
Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed.
STAN
Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders.
CARTMAN
[rises and moves off] Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of Paragon.
KYLE
Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do. [the boys leave the root]
[Broflovski residence, night. The boys' parents are all gathered in the living room.]
RANDY
[debriefing Gerald and Sheila] And so that's the situation. All the boys are out there somewhere with a... pornographic videotape.
SHEILA
Oh God, this, this is horrible!
GERALD
All right, calm down. Now, just how bad of a porno tape are we talking here? I mean, was it like Crotch Capers 3?
RANDY
I'm a...fraid it was... Backdoor Sluts 9. [he and Sharon hang their heads in shame]
GERALD, STEPHEN
Backdoor Sluts 9?!?
LINDA
Is that bad?
STEPHEN
Backdoor Sluts 9 makes Crotch Capers 3 look like Naughty Nurses 2!
GERALD
I-it is the single most vile, twisted, dark piece of porn ever made. [Sheila gets angrier by the word]
SHEILA
[slaps him] How the hell do you know?!
GERALD
[shakily] I, uh, I-I-I read about it in People.
SHEILA
[now facing the Marshes] Oh, this is just great! How could you two be so careless?!
SHARON
We're sorry.
LIANE
Well, Sheila, we can't shelter our boys forever from these things. Maybe it's okay for them to see an adult film.
SHEILA
Not without their parents to put it in a proper context! They won't understand what they're seeing!
RANDY
It-it can't hurt 'em that much, can it?
BUTTERS
[pops up outside and taps on a window] Precious. [the adults turn to see the window] Let me see my precious. [slides down the window and out of view] Plee-ee-ee-ease! [the adults just look on]
[Stan, Kyle and Cartman arrive at a house. Stan rings the doorbell twice, but no answer.]
CARTMAN
[waves his left hand around] Open. [nothing. He waves his left hand again] Bellog. [the door opens and Clyde appears]
CLYDE
What do you guys want?
STAN
We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.
CLYDE
Oh. Okay, hang on a second. [steps back and closes the door, then reopens the door. He is now dressed as an elf. His staff is a small hoe] What troubles you?
KYLE
We have in our possession something of great power. [pulls out the videotape] It is... The Lord of the Rings.
CLYDE
So? I have three copies. And the DVD with twelve hours of extra footage.
STAN
Yes, but this is not a-- [stops, then reacts] Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange. [hands the tape to Clyde]
CARTMAN
We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape.
CLYDE
Very well, I shall call the council together. Meet me in the Woods of Gathering behind Talangar the Black's house. And don't let my mom see you, 'cause I'll get in trouble.
CARTMAN
Thank you, High Elf of Paragon.
CLYDE
Faragon, asshole! [closes the door. The boys leave the house and walk off]
CARTMAN
Clyde's a dick.
[A parking lot in town. A bunch of kids are gathered there on their bikes. The lead sixth graders hops onto a car and gets the others' attention.]
SIXTH GRADER LEADER
Alright, everybody listen up! There's three snot-nosed little fourth graders out there who have a porno called Backdoor Sluts 9.
OTHER SIXTH GRADERS
Ooooooh!
SIXTH GRADER LEADER
I checked it out on the Internet, and it said that Backdoor Sluts 9 is the most hard-core porno ever made.
OTHER SIXTH GRADERS
Ahhhhh!
SIXTH GRADER LEADER
I have amassed this army of sixth graders to get the tape by any means necessary. Now, let's go get that porno! [the sixth graders scream and charge out into the night on their bikes]
[Tolkien's mansion, backyard. Very leafy backyard indeed. The camera moves from a shot of the moon to a shot of all the fourth grade boys seated around a small table.]
CLYDE
And so that is the situation. The video may or may not have evil power. Kyle, would you bring it up here, please? [Kyle gets up, walks to the table, and stands the tape on it]
OTHER BOYS
Ahhh.
JIMMY
That video could have been made by Sauron's evil f-...forces.
CRAIG
It could hold a mental spell of some kind.
KEVIN
[wearing a Star Wars Imperial stormtrooper helmet] Perhaps we could use it to strengthen our star cruisers. [the kids look at him. One shot has Tweek wearing a large coffee tin on his head, Pip dressed as an elf, a kindergartner wearing a Fett helmet, then one of Stan, Kyle and Cartman]
CARTMAN
Kevin, god-damnit..! [Kevin looks around, then hops off his chair and leaves]
CLYDE
Look, until we see this tape's power for ourselves, we cannot risk giving it to anybody.
STAN
But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too.
CLYDE
That is true. Only a Paladin with a high constitution should watch the tape. Therefore, I think it is a job for you, Talangar the Black.
TOLKIEN
[thinks about this, then leaves his seat] I am not scared. I'll go inside and watch the tape, [reaches the table and gets the tape] just for a few seconds. If I do not return in two minutes, send a party in after me. [walks towards the house] The fate of Middle-earth... is in my hands. [reaches the sliding door and enters the house, closing the door behnd him]
[The neighborhood. The sixth graders come into view on their bicycles making all sorts of noise.]
SIXTH GRADER LEADER
Fourth graders! Give us that porn-o! [they go out of view. A moment later the Marsh car comes into view]
SHARON
Boys? [the Broflovskis are in the back seat]
SHEILA
[with her head out the window] Boys, we're not mad at you. We just wanna talk to you. [behind them is the Stotch car]
[Tolkien's mansion, backyard. The boys wait for Tolkien's verdict.]
CARTMAN
Talangar the Black returns from watching the video. [the other boys stir]
CLYDE
What vice did you see on the videotape, Talangar? Is it the work of Sauron's magic? [Tolkien returns to the table and places the tape there]
TOLKIEN
I'm not playing anymore. [walks off]
STAN
[steps forward] Uh, well—Wait, what'd you see?
TOLKIEN
[stops and turns] I don't know, I don't wanna know. I'm out. [claps his hands, then walks back into the house, sliding the door open and closed. The boys look on]
CARTMAN
My God, this thing must really be powerful. [the boys turn to look at the tape]
KYLE
This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes.
STAN
What do we do with it?
CLYDE
One thing for sure, this tape cannot be trusted with anybody. It must be returned to the video store from whence it came.
JIMMY
Well, where is the videotape rented from?
KYLE
[picks up the tape and looks for the store name] Two Towers Video Store. I-in Conifer.
TWEEK
Conifer? Walking there would take hours!
CRAIG
There's no alternative. We have to return the tape before it causes more damage!
KINDERGARTNER
I'll go.
CRAIG
Ha! We cannot trust something of that much power to a dwarf! Especially a kindergartner dwarf. [all the boys begin to chatter, nominating who should return the video]
CRAIG
You're too young.
CARTMAN
Quiet!
JIMMY
You guys, this is stupid.
CARTMAN
You're acting like a bunch of assholes!
STAN
I will take it! [the boys quiet down and Stan approaches the table. He takes the tape in hand. Cartman closes his eyes in meditation] I will walk to the video store.
CLYDE
It is too far and too dangerous to go alone. Take with you the wizard [Cartman], the dwarf [the kindergartner], the warrior [Craig], the cleric [Jimmy], and the Jew [Kyle].
KYLE
[flashes anger] Paladin!
CLYDE
Very well. You shall be the Fellowship of The Lord of the Rings. Good luck. I have to go home now before I get in trouble.
TWEEK
Me too.
OTHER BOYS
[agreeing] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
CRAIG
Only the six of us are to go?
STAN
No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember?
CARTMAN
Yeah, stupid. [higher pitch] Yeah. Luckily, Cartman's big enough for the both of us. [a bit lower] Shut up, Kenny.
[Kenosha Pass, snowing. The boys walk along the highway through the pass.]
NARRATOR
So it was that the heroes traveled many miles to return The Lord of the Rings to the video store.
KYLE
We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak.
CRAIG
Look out! [a small avalanche of snow appears in front of them]
KYLE
[gasps a little] We were almost killed.
CARTMAN
A dark wizard must be trying to stop us!
STAN
True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store.
[Tolkien's mansion. The boys' parents are at the front door. The front door opens and Tolkien's parents appear.]
STEVE
Oh. Hello everybody.
GERALD
Steve, uh, we heard that a bunch of the kids were over here a little while ago.
LINDA BLACK
Well yes, I believe they were, but they've gone. What's the matter?
RANDY
We think our boys might be showing other children a, uh... pornographic tape.
STEVE
What? But Tolkien's never seen a porno before. He wouldn't know what to—Oh God! [rushes to look for Tolkien]
LINDA BLACK
Tolkien! [the other parents rush in]
[The dining room table. Tolkien sits alone on one of the many seats there. The adults arrive.]
LINDA BLACK
Tolkien? Did the boys come over and... show you a movie? [no answer]
STEVE
Tolkien? [no answer, long pause] Alright, Tolkien. We know you must be very confused about what you saw. [no response, long pause]
RANDY
[kneels next to Tolkien] Yes, uh... you see, Tolkien... that was called a pornographic film. I-it shows adult men and adult women having sexual intercourse. [no response, long pause] Well, y-you see, when a, when a man and a woman fall in love, the man puts his penis in the woman's vagina. It's called love-making, and it's part of being in love.
TOLKIEN
[no response, long pause] ...And when the woman has four penises in her at the same time, then stands over the men and pees on them, is that part of being in love too? [no response] Five midgets, spanking a man... covered with Thousand Island dressing. Is that making love?
STEVE
Jesus, what kind of porno was that?
GERALD
It was Backdoor Sluts 9.
STEVE
Oh, Jesus, not that one! [his wife gives him an angry look]
SHEILA
Oh, Gerald, poor Kyle must be just as confused and scared as this poor kid.
GERALD
Uh, Tolkien, this is very important: do you know where the boys went with the naughty tape?
[Bailey, town limit. The boys arrive there.]
CRAIG
We're entering the limits of Bailey. Everyone stay close.
STAN
Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about.
KINDERGARTNER
Ringworms are no match for a dwarf.
CARTMAN
Yes, we shall slay the Ringworm and take his bounty of treasure! [they pass a yard on which some kids are playing] For that is the way of the--
BOY 1
I shall put a magic spell on you!
BOY 2
I have blocked your spell, wizard!
KYLE
Hey, what are you guys doing? [the Bailey kids turn and look]
BOY 3
We're playing Harry Potter.
CARTMAN
[after a few moments of thought] Ha!! Fags! [the boys move on. They soon pass a Country Café]
KYLE
[suddenly wary] You guys. Somebody is following us.
CARTMAN
It's Butters.
KYLE
Butters?
CARTMAN
Yes. He's been following us for like two hours. [behind the six boys, at some distance, is Butters, skulking along in the shadows]
BUTTERS
The precious videotape. L-let the Butters see it.
CARTMAN
Just ignore him; maybe he'll go away.
JIMMY
Hey fellas, mind if we take a little re-rest?
CARTMAN
There's no time for rest, sorcerer! Keep up! [the sound of sixth graders is heard in the distance. The boys look around to find the direction of the sound. The sixth graders appear in the horizon behind them and ride in quickly, screaming all the while]
JIMMY
They are coming. [a shot of the sixth graders] You guys go on ahead.
KYLE
Jimmy, are you sure?
JIMMY
Go! [the other five boys take off, leaving Jimmy to face the sixth graders alone. He turns and stares down the approaching throng] You shall not...pah..? You shall not..puh... [the sixth graders draw closer] You shall not paah... [a shot of the young bikers, then a distance shot of Jimmy, then a shot of the young bikers, a shot of Jimmy, a shot of the young bikers, a quick shot of Jimmy, then the sixth graders as they reach Jimmy] You shall not pa--! [the sixth graders take shots at him as they pass by. He falls and gets up] You shall not paah--! [struck down again, rises, is struck down, rises...] You shall not puh-uh-uh-- [falls again. The last of the sixth graders passes by, and Jimmy stands up, all beat up, with tire tracks and bruises on his face and a black eye] You shall not pass. [falls down]
[A river, further along the quest. Stan looks back to see about Jimmy.]
STAN
Jimmy didn't stop them!
KYLE
They're gonna take The Lord of the Rings from us.
CARTMAN
Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders can't stand water!
CRAIG
What? That's stupid.
CARTMAN
I'm a high-ranking white wizard, Craig, and I say sixth graders are opposed to water!
CRAIG
Whatever. I'm going back to play with the Harry Potter kids. [walks off]
KINDERGARTNER
Me too. [follows Craig]
CARTMAN
Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter!
STAN
Just get across the river! They're coming! [the three remaining boys scramble across the river. The sixth graders arrive. Two of them stop their tires by performing wheelies and landing their bikes back on the road. The lead sixth grader rides up between them]
SIXTH GRADER LEADER
What the hell is wrong with you guys?! Get the tape!
SIXTH GRADER 3
Dude, I don't wanna get wet.
SIXTH GRADER 4
Yeah, I don't really like the water.
SIXTH GRADER 1
Besides, if our bikes get wet, their chains'll rust.
SIXTH GRADER LEADER
Oh, god-damnit. Alright, come on. We'll find a bridge. [the bikers ride off]
[The woods, later. The boys walk through it.]
NARRATOR
The quest continued to return The Lord of the Rings to the video store.
STAN
Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river.
KYLE
Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost.
CARTMAN
We're not lost, Jewgar of Jewlingrad, we just don't know where we are! [twitched] That's what "lost" means, stupid! Kenny, shut your goddamned mouth!
STAN
This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in!
BUTTERS
[crawls up to them] The Butters knowses.
KYLE
Oh brother!
BUTTERS
The video store. Yesss. Not far from here. We can show you wheres it is.
STAN
Where?!
BUTTERS
First, just let Butters sseee the precious.
KYLE
No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before.
CARTMAN
If that was possible.
STAN
Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass!
BUTTERS
[puts up his arms to shield himself] Ha-a-a. No hurtses the Butters. [squats with his arms hanging over his knees] We will show you the way. Yesss. This way it is. [walks forward in a squatting manner]
[The road. Randy, Sharon, Gerald and Sheila ride in the Marsh car, with Randy driving, and Stephen drives the Stotch car.]
SHEILA
This is awful! I just know with every passing minute, little Kyle is seeing more and more depraved sex acts!
GERALD
Well, we'll find them. A-and then we'll try to put what they saw into context.
SHARON
Look! There's one of the boys now! [before them is Jimmy, fallen and asleep in the middle of the road. Randy steps on the brakes] Jimmy!
RANDY
[the adults jump out of their cars and approach him] Jimmy! Jimmy! [Jimmy awakens and looks up] Where did the boys go with the porno tape?
JIMMY
They're taking it to the vi... the vi... the vii...
STEPHEN
Come on Jimmy, we don't have a lot of time.
JIMMY
They took it back to the video s... the video s...
RANDY
The video sandwich?
STEPHEN
The video stockyard.
RANDY
What's a video stockyard, Jimmy?
JIMMY
No, the video suh... the video s...tih...
GERALD
Stinger?
STEPHEN
Staples. They went to the video Staples. Where's that, Jimmy?
JIMMY
N-n-no, you retards! The video s...tore!
ADULTS
The video store! [they go to their cars]
SHEILA
Hurry! Hurry!
RANDY
I know where it is! [they get in their cars and peel off. ("When did the Broflovski station wagon arrive?") Jimmy is left where he was when they arrived]
[Two Towers video store. The boys arrive out of breath and head for the front door.]
KYLE
Oh no! They're closed!
STAN
Closed?
SIXTH GRADER LEADER
[off screen] There they are!
SIXTH GRADER 5
[the throng of sixth graders approach] Don't let them turn it back into the video store!
CARTMAN
We're screwed.
STAN
[seeing a way out of this mess] Wait. A drop box. [goes to it and pulls down the door] Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in!
KYLE
Finally. [he and Cartman move towards the box. Butters looks on] It's over.
BUTTERS
[now moving] Precious. Must have our precious. Waagh! [jumps on Kyle and runs off with the tape]
KYLE
Butters! No!
BUTTERS
[now in the middle of the parking lot] Now wees hases it! [the sixth graders close in]
STAN
They're coming!
KYLE
[goes after Butters and tries to wrest the tape from him] It has to go back!
BUTTERS
It wantses to stay with the Butter kid.
SIXTH GRADER LEADER
[a foot away] There it is! Give me that tape! [Butters holds on tight to the tape, smiling wide.]
KYLE
[picks Butters up and carries him off] Let go of the tape, Butters!
BUTTERS
I'll never let go! [Stan opens the drop box and holds the door open]
KYLE
Fine! [tosses him into the drop box]
BUTTERS
Precious! [Stan closes the door. The lead sixth grader leaps off his bike and rushes to the drop box]
SIXTH GRADER LEADER
Nooo! [reaches in and fishes around for it] No, nooo! [walks off in disgust and hits the window] Damnit! [the other sixth graders arrive]
SIXTH GRADER 1
Aw man, now we'll never see the hot action.
SIXTH GRADER LEADER
You stupid little fourth graders!
CARTMAN
The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well.
KYLE
Middle-earth is again safe.
SIXTH GRADER LEADER
Yeah? Well, that's not gonna stop us from kicking your asses!
STAN
Uh-oh.
[The lead sixth grader approaches punching his left fist into his right hand. The other sixth graders move in alowly. Headlights appear and a car horn sounds. The sixth graders look at the cars, as do the boys. The cars pull to a stop short of the boys.]
RANDY
Boys! Boys!
SIXTH GRADER LEADER
Crap! Parents! [gets on his bike and turns away] Come on, guys. [the sixth graders leave] We'll see you next time, fourthies!
CARTMAN
And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.
RANDY
There you are!
SHEILA
Oh, Kyle! You're safe!
STAN
Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video.
RANDY
A-alright, now, now listen, kids. There's some things we need to put into context for you. You see, a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina for both love and pleasure. But sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each other's genitals in their mouths. [the boys are stunned] Uh, this is called "69ing" and it's normal.
SHARON
See boys, a woman is sensitive in her vagina and it... feels good to have a man's penis inside of it.
SHEILA
That's right, but sometimes a woman chooses to use other things. Telephones, staplers, magazines. It's because the nerve endings in the vagina are so sensitive, it's like a fun tickle.
GERALD
Now, on to double penetration, boys. You see, sometimes when a woman has sex with more than one man, each man makes love to a different orifice.
RANDY
That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting.
SHEILA
It's also important that you understand why some people choose to urinate on each other.
RANDY
Going number 1 or number 2 on your lover is something people might do, but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it.
GERALD
Okay, boys. Do you have any questions? [the boys are still stunned, but one of them finally speaks]
STAN
...Wow. [another long moment of stunned silence]
RANDY
Well, let's all get going.
SHEILA
Yeah, come on boys. Time to get home. [the adults head for their cars, but the boys stay frozen in place]
STEPHEN
[turns around. Linda does as well] Wait a minute. Where's Butters?
[Two Towers video store, inside the bin behind the drop box.]
BUTTERS
[rises from the batch of videotapes that buried him] Wu-u-wees hases our preciouseses! Hases it... Hases it...
End of The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:The boys are sentenced to the Death Camp of Tolerance where they learn how to treat minorities. Mr. Slave and Lemmiwinks make their debut in this episode.

script:The Death Camp of Tolerance

[Principal Victoria's office, day. Her door opens.]
MR. GARRISON
[enters with Mr. Hat on his hand] You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Yes, Mr. Garrison. Have a seat. [Mr. Garrison takes a seat] Mr. Garrison, sometime ago you asked to be promoted from teaching kindergarten back to the third grade.
MR. GARRISON
[flatly] I'm aware of that.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I wanna come clean with you and tell you that back then some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences. It was wrong of us, and I want to make it up to you.
MR. GARRISON
Wow, that's... really great to hear.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
As you know, the position of Fourth Grade teacher has become available, and we'd like to offer YOU the job.
MR. GARRISON
[brightens] Oh, for real? You're not kidding?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
We in administration see now that you are an individual with your own preferences, and we respect that.
MR. GARRISON
[rises from the chair with excitement] Oh, this is all just... this is a dream come true! [shakes her hand] Thank you, Principal Victoria! I'll do a great job!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I know you will. [Garrison turns around and walks away smiling]
MR. GARRISON
[turns around] You're sure this is for real? I mean, I'm not gonna just get fired again for being gay tomorrow.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[slight chuckle] It's for real, Mr. Garrison.
MR. GARRISON
[slight chuckle, turns around and walks out the door] Oh-ho, great!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
With all the new laws we could never fire you for being gay now. You'd be able to sue us for millions of dollars.
MR. GARRISON
Right uh- [stops in his tracks at the door's entrance, his smile turns to wonder. He turns around] Wha- ...what was that?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, I was just saying that the policies have really changed. You know, we fire you for acting gay next time, you'd be able to sue the school district for ...lots of money.
MR. GARRISON
...Oh right, right, right, I... Huh-... how much money, exactly?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[busy doing paperwork] Oh. Well, there was the case out in Minnesota where the guy was awarded... 25 million, I think.
MR. GARRISON
Yeh-you don't say. [strokes his chin] Well thanks, uh, Principal Victoria. [walks out and closes the door] Holy Moly! I've gotta find a way to get fired for being gay!
[South Park Elementary.]
MR. MACKEY
M'kay kids, I know the past few weeks have been really hard with the death of your teacher, Ms. Choksondik. [the kids erupt in laughter]
KYLE
Funny.
MR. MACKEY
BUT... the principal has finally hired a teacher to take her place. So I want you all to give your best behavior to your new Fourth Grade teacher, Mr. Garrison. [the door opens and Garrison enters]
KIDS
AWWWW!!!
KYLE
Not him!
MR. GARRISON
Thank you, Mr. Mackey.
MR. MACKEY
[walks toward the door] Good luck, m'kay.
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, now for those of you who are new, my name is [writes on the board] Mr. Garrison.
BUTTERS
Where is Mr. Hat, sir?
MR. GARRISON
Well, I was informed that fourth graders are a little too old for Mr. Hat.
KYLE
[rolls his eyes] Two-year-olds are too old for Mr. Hat.
MR. GARRISON
But it's okay because I found a new teacher's assistant. Say hello to... [the door opens again] Mr. Slave. [a strapping man enters. He wears a pink shirt, pale blue jeans; black leather vest, chaps and boots; police hat, strong jaw and mustache, and pouty lips]
MR. SLAVE
[preens] Hi kids. Hm.
MR. GARRISON
So that's [writes on the board] Mr. Slave. [Mr. Slave poses] The teacher's assistant. [Mr Slave smooths his mustache, then his hat] Or, as I like to write for short, the Teacher's Ass.
MR. SLAVE
[throws his arms forward] Oh Jesus Christ.
MR. GARRISON
Okay, Mr. Slave. Go sit until I need you. [Mr. Slave goes to sit down. Garrison spanks him as he passes by]
MR. SLAVE
Ugh.
CARTMAN
[leans towards Craig, who pays attention] Dude, I think that Mr. Slave guy might by a... [glances back] Pakistani.
MR. GARRISON
I'm not saying the rest of the school year is going to be easy. In fact, it's going to be long and hard. [does motions for both words - the palms facing each other and pulling apart, then two fists] Really long and really hard. [emphasizes the motions]
MR. SLAVE
[at a small teacher's desk reading a magazine] Oh Jesus Christ.
MR. GARRISON
[gleefully] Eheh, the first thing we're gonna be learning about is communist Russia. [erases the name on the board and begins writing the topic, starting with an S]
CARTMAN
[begins making a paper plane involuntarily] No, Kenny. What are you doing, Kenny?
MR. GARRISON
[finishes writing "STALIN"] Now, Stalin was a big silly when it came to...
CARTMAN
[finishes the plane and aims it at Mr. Garrison] Kenny, no! Don't do it, Kenny! [fires the plane off. It hits the board and falls away]
MR. GARRISON
[turns around and points] Eric, did you just throw a paper airplane?!
CARTMAN
No, it was Kenny!
MR. GARRISON
[arms akimbo] Very funny, Eric! Kenny's dead!
STAN
[coming to Cartman's defense] Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body.
THE OTHER KIDS
Yeah.
MR. GARRISON
That does it! I will not put up with foolishness in my class! It's time for punishment! [reaches into his desk and pulls out a paddle, then strikes it against his left palm twice. He walks over to Mr. Slave and has him bend over] Take it Mr. Slave! [swats him three times on the ass]
MR. SLAVE
[moves his head around] Oh-oh. Oh it hurts.
MR. GARRISON
I will [swat] NOT put up with [swat] TOM foolery in my [swat] CLASS room, children. [stands him up and straps a gag ball around Mr. Slave's face] Mr. Slave, put this rubber ball in your mouth. [bends Mr. Slave over his lap and swats him some more] Take that, Slavey! take it! [the kids look on, stunned. Mr. Garrison continues the swats] This'll get me fired for sure. [smiles]
[The Marsh house, afternoon. The Tweaks, the Stotches, the Marshes, the Broflovskis, and Liane are present in the living room, seated around the coffee table.]
GERALD
I really enjoyed the imagery in the last chapter of this month's book.
LINDA
Yes, and I really saw the entire book thematically as a take on corporate America.
RANDY
Well I think in the fourth chapter, when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker, well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage. [Sharon sips some coffee, a door opens]
GERALD
So full of metaphor.
KYLE
Hey guys, can we talk to you? [with him are Stan, Cartman, Butters, and Tweek]
SHEILA
Oh, hi boys.
SHARON
How was school?
KYLE
Uhh, not cool.
SHEILA
That's great. We're having our book of the month club meeting, so why don't you boys go outside and play?
LINDA
Was it me, or did you all think that Nancy Drew solved the riddle of Elephant Mountain a little too easily? [a burst of chatter follows]
STAN
No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher.
STEPHEN
Uh huh.
KYLE
Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay.
SHEILA
Kyle! You know better than to discriminate against homosexuals!
STAN
Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay.
RANDY
[displeased] Aw I'm surprised at you, Stanley. I really thought you knew how to accept people for who they were.
STAN
Yeah, but Dad-
RANDY
No buts, Stanley! We're not raising our kids to be discriminators!
SHEILA
That's right! I think it's time you kids took a little trip to the Museum of Tolerance! [Gerald crosses his arms. The kids look at each other]
[Museum of Tolerance, next day. A really modern building with a fountain by the entrance. The five boys and their parents arrive at the museum.]
TOUR GUIDE
[a woman greeting the families inside the museum] Welcome to the Museum of Tolerance. Here we try to educate you on the dynamics of racism and prejudice in America. [Cartman yawns loudly. Liane smacks him across the back of his head]
CARTMAN
Ey!
TOUR GUIDE
[leads them through the museum] Now, did you know that words we use can show intolerance? [leads the group to a tunnel entrance] Let's begin our tour with a walk through our Tunnel of Prejudice, to show you what it can feel like to be discriminated against. [motions for the boys to enter, and the boys enter]
VOICE
[the words it says appear on the walls of the tunnel as it says them, then disappear] QUEER. BEANER. CHINK. N*GGER. HEEB. FAGGOT. CRACKER. SLOPE. [the boys are suitably shocked as they move along the tunnel's people mover, but Cartman is grinning from ear to ear]
CARTMAN
Aw man, this is awesome! ["JAP"]
TOUR GUIDE
[at the other end of the tunnel with the parents] Now you know how it feels.
CARTMAN
[excited, runs up to the guide] I wanna ride again! I wanna ride again!
TOUR GUIDE
[leads them into the Hall of Stereotypes] We are now entering the Hall of Stereotypes. These wax figures represent how some intolerant people have labeled minorities. [leads them to the first exhibit] Here we see a black person eating chicken and watermelon, a stereotype that hurts the African-American community. What other stereotypes do you see here? [the stereotypes are exhibits, each one with its own spotlight]
RANDY
[walks up to another exhibit with Stan and Kyle] Ah, here's the Arab as a terrorist. [the Arab is holding a Kalashnikov rifle]
TOUR GUIDE
That's right. But of course, we know that not all Arabs are terrorists, don't we, kids?
BUTTERS
[sees a third exhibit] W-w-well there's an Asian over there with a calculator. [walks over to it. The others follow]
TOUR GUIDE
That's right. Not all stereotypes are negative. But even a positive one like "All Asians are good at math" is harmful to society.
CARTMAN
[over at a fourth exhibit, a man cowering over a bag of money] Look, a covetous Jew!
TOUR GUIDE
[arrives with the others] Very good, young man. The idea that Jews are only interested in money is very old indeed.
RANDY
[notices a fifth spotlight and walks to it] Ah, here's a good one. [Stan walks up next to him] It's the stereotypical "sleepy Mexican." [a man sleeps under the spotlight sitting up next to a mop and bucket]
JANITOR
[wakes up] Wai-what? Oh man, what time is it? [stands up and rubs the back of his neck]
RANDY
[in a low voice] Oh I'm sorry. I thought you were a wax sculpture.
JANITOR
Naw, man. I'm the janitor. I'm s'pose to be cleaning but I'm so tired. Ongh, so sleepy. [walks off with the mop and bucket]
TOUR GUIDE
[leads them into the Tolerance Discovery Lab] This is our discovery wing. Take your time at the computer displays [they measure tolerance I.Q.], because you see, being tolerant you must also learn to respect people who are small, people who are disabled, even people who are overweight, [moves her arms towards Cartman] like this young man here.
CARTMAN
Ey!
TOUR GUIDE
You other boys have probably called this young man names like "tubby," or "lardbutt," or "fat tits,"...
KYLE
"Fat tits." That's a good one.
STAN
Yeah, I have to remember that.
TOUR GUIDE
But you must learn to be tolerant of his differences as well. If he chooses to eat fatty foods, that's his life choice.
CARTMAN
[strokes his chin and tries something out] I'm not fat, I have a different life choice.
TOUR GUIDE
And we won't belittle you for eating lots of cookies and cakes and pies.
CARTMAN
Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass! [the adults chuckle]
RANDY
That's our Cartman. [Cartman grins]
[Museum of Tolerance, outside.]
TOUR GUIDE
Well, that's the end of our tour.
RANDY
Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys?
STAN
I guess.
TOUR GUIDE
We have to accept people for who they are and what they like to do. [notices someone nearby] Hey! What the hell are you doing? [it's a man smoking on the edge of the fountain]
SMOKER
Oh I was just uh-
TOUR GUIDE
There's no smoking in the museum!
SMOKER
But I'm not in the museum.
TOUR GUIDE
Get out of here, you filthy smoker! [the smoker rises and walks off]
GERALD
Yeah, dirty lungs!
SHARON
Go ahead and kill yourself, stupid tar-breath!
STEPHEN
Dumbass!
RICHARD
Get out of here! [the smoker walks out of view]
TOUR GUIDE
Well, have a great day, everybody.
STEPHEN
Now you boys can go and give your teacher and assistant the respect they deserve. Right?
THE BOYS
Yeah.
[South Park Elementary, day, Garrison's class. Mr. Garrison enters, having previously set up a chemistry experiment on the teacher's desk.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, let's take our seats. Uh, apparently, none of you tried to get me fired yesterday, so I guess we're just gonna have to go on and learn more today. [sits on a corner of the desk] Now who can tells me what happens to water when we heat it up in the Bunsen burner?
BUTTERS
It evaporates.
MR. GARRISON
Good, Butters. Now if we take the glass tube of the Bunsen burner, we can also see how other things react. [takes the tube in hand and walks over to Mr. Slave] Evaporation is an exothermic reaction, so let's look at an endothermic one. Mr. Slave, position 7 please. [Mr. Slave looks up from his magazine, then assumes the position over his little desk and lowers his pants enough to show his ass] Now I'm gonna put the glass tube under Mr. Slave's tight ass. [steps backwards and inserts the tube. Mr. Slave starts to moan] The heat from Mr. Slave's ass will act as our new conductor of energy.
MR. SLAVE
AAH.
MR. GARRISON
Okay, now Butters, could you bring over Lemmiwinks for me please?
BUTTERS
Sure. [smiles and goes to get Lemmiwinks]
STAN
[sensing what's about to happen] Oh, no, no, no no no no.
MR. GARRISON
[gets Lemmiwinks from Butters] Newton was the first to discover that for every action there's a reaction - thank you Butters. Now what do you think is gonna happen when I introduce the element of the gerbil to the endothermic heat of Mr. Slave's ass? [the kids are all aghast] Well let's see. [lifts up the Bunsen tube and sends the gerbil on its way down]
MR. SLAVE
AAH. [the gerbil enters Mr. Slave's lower intestine and comes across the skeleton of another gerbil. It turns back immediately and runs for the anal opening. Mr. Garrison pulls the tube out and the sphincter snaps shut, trapping the gerbil inside. It tries to claw its way out] AAH. [moves his head around] Dude! Jesus Christ! AAH!
BUTTERS
[realizing what just happened] Lemmiwinks? NO!
[South Park Elementary, lunch time. The kids go for their lunches.]
CHEF
Hello there, children!
THE BOYS
Hey Chef.
CHEF
How's it goin'?
KYLE
Bad.
CHEF
Why bad?
STAN
Chef, we're intolerant. [beat]
CHEF
...Intolerant of who?
KYLE
Gays, I guess.
CHEF
Now why do you wanna go be intolerant of gay people, children? [arms akimbo] I thought you knew better.
STAN
Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around them.
CHEF
Children, a lot of times the reason people get uncomfortable around gay people is that they have some issues themselves. You have to ask yourself, "What is it about their behavior that, for some reason, makes me uncomfortable?"
KYLE
Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass.
CHEF
Right. And you see, children, that's why you need to- Whoa! What?!
STAN
Are we homophobes now?
KYLE
We don't wanna be gay bashers, Chef.
CHEF
Children, there's a BIG difference between gay people and Mr. Garrison! Do you understand that??
STAN
N-no?
CHEF
You children just take your lunches. I'm gonna have a talk with the principal.
CARTMAN
I'll take three lunches today, please.
CHEF
You don't need three lunches, Eric! You're fat enough as it is!
CARTMAN
It is my life choice, Chef, and if you don't tolerate it I'll report you to the SEC. [Chef is puzzled]
[Fourth Grade classroom. The chemistry equipment has been cleared away from the teacher's desk. Mr. Garrison and Mr. Slave are in the classroom.]
MR. GARRISON
That was a brilliant idea, having me put a gerbil up your ass, Mr. Slave. [laughs] Now we'll get fired for sure!
MR. SLAVE
[nonchalantly] Well it wasn't the first small animal I put up my ass.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
[over the P.A. system] Mr. Garrison to the principal's office, please?
MR. GARRISON
That's it! They're gonna fire me for being gay! Twenty-five million here we cooome. [shimmies out the door]
MR. SLAVE
Don't forget, I get half. Oooooh! [feels the gerbil try again to claw its way out of his ass] Oooooh, Jesus Christ. [scratches his ass. The gerbil runs one way, then back to the sphincter. A specter appears and stops the gerbil in its tracks. It's a Frog King. The two stand motionless for a few seconds]
FROG KING
Lemmiwinks, you must find a way out of this place, or you will surely die. [the gerbil just stands there] This way has been closed off by the Great Sphincter. To escape you must journey upward to the dark reaches of the intestine and past the stomach. [the gerbil says nothing] Who am I? Just a friend. Heed my words, Lemmiwinks. Your time is running out. Make for the large intestine. All will be made clear then. [disappears. The gerbil turns around, scratches its chin, and begins its journey]
SINGER
A great adventure is waiting for you ahead.
Hurry onward, Lemmiwinks, or you will soon be dead.
The journey before you may be long and filled with woe
But you must escape the gay man's ass so your tale can be told.
Lemmiwinks. Lehehemiwinks Lemmiwinks Lemmiwinks-
[The principal's office, a few moments later. Mr. Garrison hums as he nears the office door. He enters and stands beside an angry Chef, who has crossed his arms.]
MR. GARRISON
You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh yes, uh, Mr. Garrison, have a seat.
MR. GARRISON
[nudges Chef] Oh dear, sounds like I'm gettin' fired. [hums some more and takes a seat]
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Mr. Garrison, Chef has brought it to my attention that some uh students are a bit... uuuncomfortable about certain aspects of your teaching methods.
MR. GARRISON
[in anticipation, gets melodramatic] Oh no, you're firing me? Oh well, I can't stop being who I am. I can't help the way God made me. Guess I just have to go.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
No no no we're not firing you.
MR. GARRISON
...You're not?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
No, we're sending Chef to a tolerance seminar.
CHEF
[steps forward] Sending Chef to a tolerance seminar?! You've got to be fuckin' crazy!!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
You demonstrate a lack of tolerance for Mr. Garrison's behavior. In fact, I believe you used the words "sick queer" to describe his conduct in class?
CHEF
He IS a sick queer!!
MR. GARRISON
Yeah!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I just wanted to give you an opportunity to apologize to Mr. Garrison before I send you away, Chef.
CHEF
Kiss my black ass!! [Mr. Garrison is surprised]
[South Park Elementary, Counselor Mackey's office.]
MR. MACKEY
Parents, I had to call you in here because your boys have refused to attend class with their homosexual teachers, m'kay?
STAN
We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!
RANDY
Well I really thought you boys learned something in the Museum of Tolerance, but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers!
BUTTERS
[still distraught] But they killed Lemmiwinks!
STEPHEN
Shut your mouth, Butters! You'll speak when spoken to!
BUTTERS
Yes sir.
STEPHEN
Mr. Mackey, we've done everything we can to raise compassionate children. We don't know where else to turn.
MR. MACKEY
Well there is an intensive seminar camp. It's a bit severe, but it might be the only way. M'kay?
SHARON
That sounds good to me.
LIANE
Me too.
SHEILA
Then it's settled. Boys, you're going to tolerance camp.
STAN
Tolerance camp?
[Devitzen's Tolerance Camp, black-and-white footage, day. A truck pulls up to the entrance and two guards open the gates. Beyond, kids mill around under the watchful eyes of other guards. A few moments later a guard paces in front of a crowd of kids.]
CAMP WARDEN
[sternly] Welcome to tolerance camp. You are here because you would not accept people's differences. [a shot of the kids shows that Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Butters were not the only kids to refuse attending Garrison's class] Because you refuse to accept the life choices of your fellow man. Well those days are now over. Here you vill verk, every hour of every day until you submit to being tolerant of everybody. Here, intolerance... will not be tolerated.
[South Park Elementary, Garrison's classroom. Mr. Slave is reading his magazine. A few moments later Mr. Garrison storms into the room and slams the door shut.]
MR. GARRISON
God-damnit!
MR. SLAVE
How'd it go?
MR. GARRISON
This is unbelievable, Mr. Slave! It seems no matter what I do I can't get fired!
MR. SLAVE
The principal didn't fire you?
MR. GARRISON
No! The parents felt so bad that their kids didn't want to attend my class anymore that they wanna give me the Courageous Teacher award this Friday at the Museum of Tolerance!
MR. SLAVE
Oh, Jesus Christ.
MR. GARRISON
I mean, I stuck a gerbil up your ass and they wanna give me a Goddamn medal!
MR. SLAVE
Well it sounds to me like the principal's just hiding things from everybody. What you need to do is let the parents see what kind of demented faggot you are.
MR. GARRISON
Oh well- [stops and thinks] Hey, that's right, Mr. Slave. [paces a bit] The parents have to see for themselves. [snaps his fingers] The awards ceremony! Well we'll put on a show they'll never forget!
MR. SLAVE
Oohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ. [rubs his belly, and the camera zooms in, cutting to the intestine. Lemmiwinks walks along, and a guitar is heard]
SINGERS
Lemmiwinks journeyed a distance far and fast.
To find his way out of a gay man's ass.
The road ahead is filled with danger and fright
But push onward, Lemmiwinks, with all of your might.
FROG KING
[appears again before Lemmiwinks] Lemmiwinks, you are coming to the entrance of the small intestine. There you must seek out the Sparrow Prince. [disappears. Lemmiwinks walks up the large intestine, going back and forth. Eventually it sees the Sparrow Prince and stops]
SINGERS
The Sparrow Prince lies somewhere way up ahead.
Don't look back, Lemmiwinks, or you'll soon be dead.
Lemmiwinks, Lemmiwinks, the time is growing late.
Slow down now and seal your fate.
SPARROW PRINCE
I am the Sparrow Prince. Long has my spirit been trapped within this place. Before you lies the maze of the small intestine. One path leads to the stomach, the other to certain doom. Take with you this helmet and torch. [they appear and float toward Lemmiwinks] Let them be your guide. [Lemmiwinks puts it on and continues its journey]
SINGERS
Take the magic helmet torch to help you light the way.
There's still a lot of ground to cross inside the man so gay.
Ahead of you lies adventure, and your strength still lies within.
Freedom from the Ass of Doom is the treasure you will win.
[Devitzen's Tolerance Camp, black-and-white footage, day. The kids are in a large room the size of an airport hangar. All of them have been doing arts and crafts, as they are dirty with crayons and paint. Each column of tables is being patrolled by a guard.]
CAMP WARDEN
Today we will be using the fingerpaint! You vill make a painting that shows people of different races and sexual orientations getting along. Fingerpaint. Fingerpaint! [the kids get busy fingerpainting] You vill not make any distinction between people of different colors! People with different sexual preferences! You vill accept everyone! [stops behind Kyle's right shoulder and swoops down to look at his paper] What are you fingerpainting?!
KYLE
Uh, a bear?
CAMP WARDEN
Ein bear?! Und bear has nothing to do with accepting people of different races!
KYLE
[trembling in fear] Eh I, I don't know what else to paint.
CAMP WARDEN
[takes Kyle's paper and rips it up] Start over! [puts his hand on the stack of papers next to Kyle] You will fingerpaint what we tell you! [takes a sheet from the stack and slams it down in front of Kyle] GO! [Kyle starts on a new picture] Faster. [the guard switches to the left shoulder without breaking his stare] Faster! [switches back to the right shoulder and cocks a pistol against Kyle's head] Faasterr.
KYLE
Aaaa! [hurries to finish the painting]
CAMP WARDEN
Faster! Are you done?! What is it?! What have you done?! [Kyle adds some broad strokes and lifts up the finished work]
KYLE
[trembling] People of all colors and creeds holding hands beneath a rainbow!
CAMP WARDEN
GOOD! [snatches the paper from Kyle's hand] That wasn't so hard, was it? [rips it up and tosses it away] NOW DO IT AGAIN! [walks off slowly] Faster! [the kids work faster] Faasterr!
[South Park Elementary, Garrison's classroom. Mr. Garrison talks to Mr. Slave. There are no kids in class, as they've all gone to tolerance camp, apparently.]
MR. GARRISON
There! I've done it, Mr. Slave. The perfect plan to get us fired. You finished your costume design yet?
MR. SLAVE
[scribbling on a notepad] Almost. I just have to get through a su- [grabs his stomach] Uh-huc, Jesus Christ.
MR. GARRISON
What's the matter?
MR. SLAVE
Mm, Just a bit of an upset stomach, I guess.
MR. GARRISON
Well here, take a Pepto pill. I can't have my teacher's ass under the weather. [hands Mr. Slave a glass of water and a pill]
MR. SLAVE
Eugh, Jesus Christ. [takes the pill and swallows it. The camera follows the pill down the esophagus toward the stomach. The pill lands in the pool of acid in the stomach. Lemmiwinks pops up from the pool]
SINGERS
Lemmiwinks came to the stomach dark.
'Neath the depths of the lungs and heart.
CATATAFISH
You chose your path wisely, Lemmiwinks. I am the Catatafish.
SINGERS
Catatafish of the stomach's cove.
CATATAFISH
If you answer this riddle, the esophagus will let you pass.
SINGERS
Catatafish's riddle will soon be told.
[Devitzen's Tolerance Camp, black-and-white footage, day. The kids are now in a different room quietly making macaroni pictures on the floor, but they are all fatigued. The guard walks up to a soldier on a catwalk and talks with him.]
CAMP WARDEN
Everything in order?
CAMP SOLDIER
Yes, mein Führer. Ve are making the prisoners make macaroni pictures that illustrate diversity in the verkplace.
CAMP WARDEN
[looks at a paper with two people shaking hands and with "DIVERSITY" written above them] Eh-xcellent! [down below the kids continue with their pictures.]
KYLE
[Suddenly falls on his face] Oh.
STAN
Kyle. [helps him up and tries to rouse him] Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures.
KYLE
[limply] Can't... glue... any... more. [falls on his face again]
STAN
The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you!
CAMP WARDEN
Take this one away. He is done for. [a soldier drags a boys body along the floor]
STAN
Butters!
BUTTERS
No more... arts and crafts...
STAN
Jesus... we have to get out of here. [other kids are passed out, some on their backs, some on their stomachs]
[Devitzen's Tolerance Camp, black-and-white footage, outside. The kids are at play. Cartman walks over to a Porto-Potty and enters, but stops. He looks down into the toilet and finds two girls there in the septic tank.]
GIRL 1
Please don't tell them that we're hiding here.
GIRL 2
We can't work anymore or we'll die.
CAMP SOLDIER
[walking by] Vhat? [closes the door and turns around] Waht?!
CARTMAN
Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting back to work.
CAMP SOLDIER
Vhat is in there?
CARTMAN
Nothing.
CAMP SOLDIER
Get back to verk.
CARTMAN
[salutes] Yes sir! [the guard walks away] Phew. [opens the door and steps inside, laughing. A few moments later he craps and starts laughing]
THE GIRLS
Eww! Eww! Eww! [Cartman craps and laughs some more]
CARTMAN
[exits and alerts any available soldier] Hey, I was just kidding. There's actually two girls hiding down there. Hey! [goes to find a soldier]
[Museum of Tolerance, Friday night. The main hall is set up for the awards ceremony and the guests are seated.]
TOUR GUIDE
Tonight we are here to honor an amazing fourth grade teacher with the Courageous Teacher award. [applause] Herbert Garrison came out about two years ago. Since then he has faced adversity. He has even faced ridicule by some of the students.
SHARON
Oh Randy, I'm so ashamed of our son.
TOUR GUIDE
It is my honor to present the Courageous Teacher award to... Herbert Garrison. [applause. She moves off as Garrison enters riding on Mr. Slave, humming a song. Mr. Garrison wears a towering headdress while Mr. Slave is dressed as a horse. Mr. Slave stops]
MR. GARRISON
Get along, little Slave.
RANDY
Oh my God.
GERALD
That's what our boys were talking about?
MR. GARRISON
[rings some small bells] Ding-ding, ding-ding.
MAN 1
[sitting next to Principal Victoria] He is so courageous.
MR. GARRISON
[now at the podium, with Mr. Slave standing to his right. He's wearing a purple belt with shiny purple dildo hanging from it] Say, Mr. Slave.
MR. SLAVE
Yes, Mr. Garrison?
MR. GARRISON
I had a dream last night that you were a real dick.
MR. SLAVE
Really? Why would you dream that I was being an asshole?
MR. GARRISON
No no, I was the asshole. [a moment of silence, and more applause]
MAN 2
[brown hair and mustache] Ogh, that is so courageous.
MAN 3
[gray hair] What an amazing human being! [Randy and Gerald look at each other in shock]
MR. GARRISON
Uh, I uh I'm very happy to get this award. Uh but you know what makes me even happier? Sucking balls.
AUDIENCE
Ahh [applause]
MR. GARRISON
[frustrated, to Mr. Slave] It isn't working. Sing your song, Mr. Slave.
MR. SLAVE
I've got a little- Oof. [grabs his stomach] Ohoc, Jesus Christ. What's happening in there?
[Inside Mr. Slave's stomach at that moment, Lemmiwinks has been put into a gyroscope and is ready to be shot up the esophagus and out the mouth.]
FROG KING
Hang on, Lemmiwinks! You solved the Catatafish's riddle. Now your trials are nearly through!
[Outside Mr. Slave's stomach, onstage.]
MR. SLAVE
Oh! I should have never shoved all those poor animals up my ass! [a few moments of thought, and then more applause]
MR. GARRISON
Uh...
MAN 4
[black hair] Courageous.
MAN 5
[behind him, brown hair] So courageous.
MR. GARRISON
[frustrated and finally letting loose] God-damnit, don't you people get it?! I'm trying to get fired here! [the applause dies down]
MAN 3
[softly] Oh, that's courageous.
MR. GARRISON
Look, this kind of behavior should not be acceptable from a teacher!
MR. SLAVE
Yeah, Jesus Christ.
MAN 6
But the mu-se-um tells us to be to-le-rant.
MAN 3
[stands up and raises his arms] Yes. The mu-se-um.
MAN 7
[stands up and raises his arms] The mu-se-um tells us.
MR. GARRISON
Tolerant, but not stupid! Look, just because you have to tolerate something doesn't mean you have to approve of it! If you had to like it, it'd be called the Museum of Acceptance! [the audience looks on] "Tolerate" means you're just putting up with it! You tolerate a crying child sitting next to you on the airplane or, or you tolerate a bad cold. It can still piss you off! Jesus Tapdancing Christ!
RANDY
He's right. Our boys didn't hate homosexuals, they just hated the way this asshole was acting.
GERALD
We've gotta get our boys back! [gets up and rushes out]
MR. GARRISON
[relieved] Ogh! So now can I PLEASE get fired and get my 25 million dollars?!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
No, no, I think I have a better idea.
[Devitzen's Tolerance Camp, Saturday, day. The boys' parents are at the front gate. Black-and-white fades into color, and Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Butters are present. They are quite thin, clearly undernourished, and their clothes fit loose on them.]
RANDY
We're sorry, boys. Why didn't you tell us your teachers were acting so over-the-top?
SHEILA
Yes. You boys don't know how much we suffered. [a close-up of the boys shows that Butters is the thinnest of them]
STEPHEN
Come on, let's go. [the boys and their parents head away from the gate. As they go, Mr. Garrison and Mr. Slave are brought in by Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey. Two soldiers have them under gunpoint]
MR. GARRISON
But this is insane!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I'm sorry Mr. Garrison, but it's obvious you aren't tolerant of your own behavior.
CAMP WARDEN
[arrives] Vhat do we have here? Noo recruits? I assure you, the next veek will be nothing but pain and suffering! [pounds his right fist into his left palm]
MR. SLAVE
Oooo, this could be kind of fun. [convulses all of a sudden, goes down on hands and knees, and coughs up the gerbil]
SINGERS
Lemmiwinks has made it out and his tale is nearly through.
[the three spirits he met in Mr. Slave's body now appear before him]
CATATAFISH
Great job, Lemmiwinks.
SPARROW PRINCE
Thanks to you we are all free.
FROG KING
[draws close to Lemmiwinks] But your adventures are just beginning, for you are no ordinary gerbil, Lemmiwinks. You are the Gerbil King. [places a crown on its head, then backs up to join the other two animal spirits]
THE THREE SPIRITS
All hail the Gerbil King. [they disappear]
SINGERS
Now that you're the Gerbil King there's more ventures to go on
Fly away to faraway lands and to the setting sun
There's still so many enemies and battles yet to fight
For Lemmiwinks the Gerbil King could be told a thousand nights
Lemmi- Lemmi- Lemmiwinks. Le- Lemmiwiiinks.
Lehhmiwinks, Lem- Lem- Lemmiwinks
Lemmiwinks, Lemmiwinks, Leh-miwinks
Leh-miwinks, Gerbil King.]
End of The Death Camp of Tolerance


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:When a famous psychic fails to help him exorcise Kenny from his body, Cartman and Chef travel to the moors of Scotland, where Chef's mom tries a little of her voodoo magic on him.

script:The Biggest Douche in the Universe

[South Park, night. A camera sits atop an ambulance transmitting the action as the ambulance speeds down a street. It ends up at Hell's Pass Hospital. The paramedics rush out and open the cargo doors, quickly take Cartman out and whisk him into Emergency while his mom remains seated anxiously inside the ambulance.]
LIANE
[steps out of the ambulance] Be careful with my baby.
[Hell's Pass Hospital, inside. The paramedics reach the nurses' station and rush by.]
BLONDE NURSE
What have we got?
PARAMEDIC 1
[black hair] Not sure. It looks like a possible code five six!
CARTMAN
[disoriented] Kenny. Shut up, Kenny.
LIANE
[now helping the nurse and paramedics] You're going to be okay, baby.
[Hell's Pass Hospital, operating room. Emergency personnel whisk Cartman into the room. Liane enters, but stays near the door.]
DR. DOCTOR
[enters ready for surgery] Five me 50 cc's of ketamine, STAT. And get something for the kid, too.
LIANE
Is he going to be okay?
BRUNETTE NURSE
Let the doctor do his work, ma'am. [closes the curtain]
[Hell's Pass Hospital, a few hours later. Cartman is now in one of the recovery rooms with Liane at his side stroking him gently. He's on a respirator for the time being. The doctor enters the room slowly, but Liane notices and rises to meet him.]
LIANE
Doctor! Did you find out what's wrong with him?
DR. DOCTOR
I'm afraid he's... running out of time.
LIANE
[thinks a moment, then] Why?? What's wrong with him??
DR. DOCTOR
It's his time. It's ...running out.
LIANE
Well, what does he need?
DR. DOCTOR
He needs to have more time.
LIANE
What can we do?
DR. DOCTOR
Well, I suppose we could try a time transplant. I'll have to call in a specialist. [turns and walks out. Liane returns to Cartman]
LIANE
[cradles Cartman somewhat] It's going to be okay, baby. We're going to get you more time.
CARTMAN
Ey Kenny! God-damn you, Kenny!
[Chef's house, day. Stan and Kyle go up to the front door and Kyle knocks. Chef opens up and sees them.]
CHEF
Hello there, children.
STAN
Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die.
KYLE
Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care.
CHEF
Well what's wrong with him?
STAN
Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago.
KYLE
Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix.
CHEF
Children, why didn't you tell me about this sooner?
KYLE
Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care?
CHEF
Well, you should. Cartman is your friend whether you like him or not! Now, come on! We've gotta get to that hospital!
[Hell's Pass Hospital, Cartman's recovery room. Dr. Doctor has returned.]
LIANE
He's looking a little better today.
DR. DOCTOR
Yes, but his time is still getting weaker. It will give out soon unless we do something. [the door opens and Chef, Stan and Kyle enter]
CARTMAN
[cheerfully] Hey you guys! How's it goin'?
CHEF
Cartman?
STAN
No, that's Kenny.
CARTMAN
[surly] What the hell are you assholes doing here?!
STAN
That's Cartman.
CHEF
[approaches and has a look] Oh my God! Eric, how long have you been channelin' Kenny?
CARTMAN
Oh, about a month.
DR. DOCTOR
Let's not validate his delusions.
CHEF
Kenny? Kenny, do you know what you need to get free?
CARTMAN
He's gone again.
CHEF
Ms. Cartman, we need to get Eric to a medium who can speak with people who have crossed over.
DR. DOCTOR
What?? That's preposterous! What this child needs is a time transplant!
CHEF
This hospital isn't gonna do any good. We need to take him to see John Edward.
STAN
Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives.
CHEF
That's right. We have to go see him in New York.
DR. DOCTOR
I warn you, Ms. Cartman. Your son's time could give out at any minute. He needs to be kept here where his time could be monitored.
LIANE
Oooh, what should I do? I'm playing roulette with my child's life! [switches mind gears] Ooo wait, Hairspray is showing in New York, isn't it? Let's go there.
CHEF
Good. You children need to come too. Eric needs all the support he can get right now.
KYLE
We're going to New York?
[An airplane to New York, dawn. The plane is flying above the clouds.]
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Welcome aboard Flight 673 to New York. We are happy to show you a feature film during the flight. In a moment we'll be showing a preview.
KYLE
[the boys begin to put on headphones] Oh cool. We get to watch a movie?
STAN
Awesome!
[The preview.]
ANNOUNCER
Rob Schneider was an animal. [a shot of him on all fours running through the forest] Then he was a woman. [Rob steps out of a shower and inspects his new breasts. He's shocked] And now Rob Schneider is... [a shot of him sitting on a desk dressed as a stapler, stapling papers together] a stapler. [he's showing being a stapler in front of some cheering frat boys from Gamma Gamma Delta] And he's about to find out... [he's shown trying to catch a bus as a stapler] that being a stapler [he's shown with a woman, still as a stapler. He tries to get close to her, but falls off the sofa] is harder than it looks. Rob Schneider is... The Stapler. [title graphics show up] Rated PG-13.
STAN, KYLE
[remove their headphones] Weak!
CARTMAN
[giggles] Ha-heheheh. [the boys look at him; he takes his headphones off and looks at them] That was Kenny laughing, not me.
[New York, the skyline. Chef, Liane, and the boys arrive at an HBC studio for John Edward.]
CHEF
This must be the place.
PAGE
Okay audience members, hi, welcome to the taping of the show. [she collects tickets from members as they enter the studio] It's all general seating in there, and just remember, Mr. Edward might not hear from the particular dead person you wanna talk to, so just... keep an open mind.
CHEF
Don't worry, Eric. I'm sure he will be able to help you.
[John Edward's studio, show set. The seats are all filled up.]
ANNOUNCER
Ladies and Gentlemen, John Edward. [applause. John enters the set and steps on stage]
JOHN EDWARD
Thank you, thank you. Alright let's get started. [meditates a minute, then points to his right] 'S coming from over here. 'S the name Mike mean anything to anybody? [no reaction] I'm getting um, I'm getting M-mike? Definitely an M, d'um, maybe Matt? Mike? Matt? Mi-mmm, Mi-Mike, m-Mary?
MAN 1
Mary was my mother!
JOHN EDWARD
Okay okay, and she-she's she died?
MAN 1
[begins to sob. A woman comforts him] Yes. Yeh-yes she did.
JOHN EDWARD
Okay, and she's telling me there's something about... the money. That the, the money is safe? Is that making sense? [the man and woman look up]
MAN 1
M-mm-m. Not really.
JOHN EDWARD
Must be from somewhere else in the audience, then. Uh, d'uh, money? Is someone el-
STAN
Uh, over here please?
KYLE
We have a dead friend.
JOHN EDWARD
Uh d'eh'hm quiet, quiet down boys. It doesn't work that way. Uh, okay, I I'm getting ...someone now whose name is g-, a t-. It's an l-, it's a m-, it's k-.
CARTMAN
Kenny!
JOHN EDWARD
Kenny says hi.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS
Wow! [applause] wow...
JOHN EDWARD
Okay, now I'm getting that Kenny ...died?
STAN
We told you that.
JOHN EDWARD
And, and this wasn't, this wasn't a good death. It was like a, it was a sad death. It was like a, it was like a death that made people sad. Does that make sense?
KYLE
Yee-yeah.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS
[applause] Oh, wow, that's incredible! Wow!
CHEF
Look uh, Mr. Edward, can you just ask Kenny how we can get him out, please?
JOHN EDWARD
[blocking] Doesn't work that way. [turns his attention to the boys] Now, Kenny is telling me that... you're his best friends, and he's in a ss-safe place.
STAN
No no, he's trapped in Cartman's body.
JOHN EDWARD
Ohh, there's somebody with him. Who's Kyle?
KYLE
I'm Kyle.
JOHN EDWARD
Oh right. And uh, did an older woman pass, she's asking for Kyle? Maybe a grandma?
KYLE
[responding] Yeah. My Grandma. [looks around] She's here?
JOHN EDWARD
She says there was something she asked you to do, and you're not doing it? She wants you to look for four white doves.
KYLE
Oh my God!
JOHN EDWARD
Oh now she's sending me a P word. Maybe it's a puh-? Or a huh-?
WOMAN 1
My Harry died last year!
JOHN EDWARD
Oh, it's comin' from over here. [moves to the woman's side of the audience] I'm getting all kinds of voices today. [does a small skip] Woo! [laughter]
STAN
Heh hey wait a minute dude.
JOHN EDWARD
Okay now Harry. He's telling me... oh well, he's saying that you two used to... do things.
WOMAN 1
[sobs and nods vigorously] Mmm-hmm.
JOHN EDWARD
And that those things involved... stuff?
WOMAN 1
The things did involve stuff, yes. [cries. The audience is awed and gets somewhat boisterous]
[New York, outside John Edward's studio. Chef, Liane and the boys exit. Kyle is missing.]
CHEF
Aw man, I can't believe I got fooled by that asshole!
STAN
He seemed better on TV?
CHEF
Yeah. They must edit his shows down on television to only show him getting mostly right answers.
KYLE
[exits the studio a bit panicked.] Grandma's watching me. Always watching me.
STAN
[approaches Kyle] Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you? [Cartman has a seizure; the other boys look over. Cartman goes silent, and he's shown standing unconscious.]
LIANE
Eric? [the others draw closer] It must be his time. I think it's running out!
CHEF
We've got no choice. The only people I know now who might be able to help Eric are my parents. We'll have to take the next flight to Scotland.
[New York Airport, day. The kids, Chef and Liane are ready for their flights.]
CHEF
[walks to Stan and Kyle and gives them their tickets] Okay children, this is your flight back to Colorado. Your parents are meeting you at the airport in Denver.
STAN
We don't get to go to Scotland?
LIANE
It's too far and your parents want you back home.
STAN
[to Cartman] Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso.
CARTMAN
Thanks, asshole.
CHEF
Come on, we gotta catch our plane. You children get right on that plane now.
ANNOUNCER
This is the final boarding announcement for Flight 342 to Denver.
STAN
[moving off slowly] That's us. Come on.
KYLE
Four white birds!
STAN
Huh?
KYLE
There's four white birds! [Sees a sign for Jewleeard, a private school for young Jews. The sign has four birds in flight above a small school, two stars of David flanking the building, and two traditional Jewish men in overcoats, one at each end of the sign. A phone number is shown underneath. Kyle and Stan walk closer to the sign] This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard.
STAN
Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually.
KYLE
So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday?
STAN
Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave. [walks off]
KYLE
I'm not going back.
STAN
[stops and looks at Kyle, astonished] What??
KYLE
I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud! [drops his ticket on the ground] Tell my parents I'll call them. [hurries away]
STAN
Kyle. No, Kyle! Aw crap! [slaps his left palm on his face]
[John Edward's estate, later. Stan arrives and goes to the front door. Needless to say, he didn't get on the plane either. He rings the bell and is greeted by the butler.]
STAN
Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please.
BUTLER
He doesn't do private readings.
STAN
I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick.
BUTLER
Alright, come on in. [steps aside for Stan to enter]
[John Edward's estate, living room. Stan waits by the sofa.]
BUTLER
Just wait here. I'll go fetch him. [the butler walks into another area of the house]
STAN
Jesus Christ.
BUTLER
[returns] Here he is. [presses a button next to a wide doorway]
PRE-RECORDED VOICE
Ladies and Gentlemen, John Edward. [John approaches and the butler presses a second button for applause]
JOHN EDWARD
Thank you, thank you.
STAN
Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up.
JOHN EDWARD
Oh. [pulls out a card from his pocket and reads aloud] The John Edward show is not liable for opinions and materials given for entertainment purposes only. [silence for a few seconds]
STAN
Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real.
JOHN EDWARD
Maybe it is for real.
STAN
Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life.
JOHN EDWARD
Look, people have the right to be skeptical. I really hear voices in my head.
STAN
Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called "intuition." Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun.
JOHN EDWARD
Look, what I do doesn't hurt anybody. I give people closure and help them cope with life.
STAN
No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real.
JOHN EDWARD
But I'm a psychic.
STAN
No dude, you're a douche.
JOHN EDWARD
I'm not a douche! What if I really believe that dead people talk to me?
STAN
Then you're a stupid douche.
JOHN EDWARD
I think I've had of your bullying me! Get out of my house or I'll runs upstairs, lock myself in my panic room and call the police!
STAN
I'm nine years old.
JOHN EDWARD
I'm not talking to your friend and I'm not a douche! [runs up the stairs and towards his room as his voice gets whinier] You'd better get out of my house, 'cause I'm gonna call the police! [Stan looks at him like he's nuts; he locks himself in his panic room]
STAN
You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche! [walks towards the door, but notices some books on a bookcase nearby. He checks them out. "How To Be A Psychic" "Cold Reading: The Trick Of The Psychic!" "Make Women Believe You're Psychic! Then Have Sex With Them!" "How To Sixty Nine With Yourself" ...Stan senses the real reason behind John's efforts] Son of a bitch. [takes the books and leaves the estate.]
[An airplane to Scotland, day. The plane is flying above the clouds. In the cabin, Cartman sits between Chef and Liane.]
CARTMAN
Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass!
LIANE
Hang in there, sweetie. We'll be there soon.
PILOT
Welcome aboard Scotland Air. Our trip to Edinburgh should take about twelve hours.
CARTMAN
Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ!
PILOT
In the meantime we'd like to show you a complimentary film.
CARTMAN
Oh, good. [All passengers put on their headsets.]
ANNOUNCER
Rob Schneider is a Wall Street executive [Rob walks into the scene with a briefcase, then he's in a hot tub with a beautiful woman] With everything going for him. [now in his office, he gets up and straddles his desk. He then pretends the desk is a horse] Only problem is, he's about to become... [he walks up to a mirror and looks at himself] a carrot!
ROB SCHNEIDER
I'm a carrot!
ANNOUNCER
It's 24-carrot comedy. [hops away from a pursuing rabbit]
ROB SCHNEIDER
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohh!
ANNOUNCER
[title text is shown] Rob Schneider is A Carrot. Rated PG-13.
CARTMAN
Oh for the love of Christ. [switches from miffed to excited] I wanna watch, fat boy! [...and back to miffed] No, Kenny, it's not funny!
[The Jewleeard School, New York. Kyle approaches the school. Stan runs up to intercept him.]
STAN
Kyle! Kyle!
KYLE
Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants!
STAN
Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche.
KYLE
He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma!
STAN
Kyle, you can't run your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called "cold reading." They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them.
MAN 2
[listening, he approaches] Hey, whoa now. John Edward is for real.
STAN
No, he's not.
WOMAN 2
Yeah. My sister told me he knew our mother's name and when she died. [other adults begin to arrive and give testimony]
CONSTRUCTION WORKER
John Edward? Oh yeah, I heard he walked up to a guy on the street, and said his dead father wanted to say "Happy Birthday," and it WAS his birthday.
WOMAN 3
Yeah kid, how do you explain that?
STAN
[looks around at the adults, then] Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you?
WOMAN 4
Oh-ho. Me? [steps forward. The others clap]
STAN
Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay?
WOMAN 4
Okay.
STAN
Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you.
WOMAN 4
My father?
STAN
Does this month, November, hold a special significance?
WOMAN 4
[gasps] My birthday's in November!
STAN
Right, because he's saying, "Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'"
WOMAN 4
Oh my God.
STAN
See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man.
MAN 2
Well then how'd you know her birthday was in November?
STAN
I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying "He wishes you a Happy Birthday."
WOMAN 4
[gasps] What else does he say?
STAN
Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He's saying "the money. Stop worrying about the money."
WOMAN 4
[gasps] Oh my God! My sister and I have been fighting over his inheritance.
WOMAN 3
That's amazing.
STAN
No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about.
MAN 3
That sounds a little too coincidental.
MAN 4
Yes. There's only one explanation. This kid can communicate with the dead!
ADULTS
Wow!
STAN
What?! [his deconstruction didn't work. The adults crowd in]
MAN 2
Do me next. I wanna talk to my mother.
WOMAN 3
Can you try to reach my grandfather.
STAN
No wait.
CONSTRUCTION WORKER
You have to tell me if my sister's in a good place. [Kyle walks away from the crowd and into Jewleeard]
MAN 5
Yeah, help me out too, 'k?
MAN 6
I'm next. I'm next.
MAN 7
Hey, get out of my way!
MAN 8
Do me!
SCOUT
Kid, how would you like your own talking to the dead show?
[Scotland, day, highlands. Night falls. Chef, Liane and Cartman arrive at the McElroy manor and Chef knocks on the door. Bagpipes that were playing stop. Mr. McElroy, Chef's dad, answers the door.]
CHEF
Hi Pop.
THOMAS
Junior! Aw, son, it's good to see you now.
CHEF
These are my friends, the Cartmans. [presents them]
THOMAS
Well come on in out of the cold now. [the guests enter] There's heavy fog on the moors tonight. [closes the door, then leads them to the living room] Well, look what the cat dragged in, Nellie.
NELLIE
Oh, my baby come home!
CHEF
Hi, Momma! [gives her a hug]
NELLIE
Lord, I thought you wasn't comin' till nine.
CHEF
Mom, this is my friend, Ms. Cartman.
LIANE
Please, call me Liane.
NELLIE
So nice to have you here, Liane.
THOMAS
And is this the children you told us about?
CHEF
Yeah, Pop. This is Eric.
THOMAS
Well, let's see here now. [genuflects and checks Cartman out in various places on the body] Mhm, mhm, mhm. [stands up] Yeup! There's definitely more than one children in there.
LIANE
Oh dear.
THOMAS
Nellie, you best have at it now.
NELLIE
Oh Lord, and I just put the roast in the oven, too. [walks off to the kitchen muttering] Ain't gonna have no time now to baste it. Don't nobody blame me, a woman can't bake no roast and do everything else at the same time. [Thomas walks off to his left] Can't say that the roast is gonna be terrible, maybe just a little dry. [Thomas returns with a stool] But I suppose we can make some extra gravy to take the dryness out later. [Nellie returns dressed as a shaman with angel wings]
THOMAS
Alright, children, stand up on this chair now.
CARTMAN
Right now?
THOMAS
Yes, right now. [Cartman steps up on the small stool and Nellie begins to work on him.]
NELLIE
[waving her scepters] Na kamaa karash meh nah- [strikes Cartman]
CARTMAN
Whoa, whoa, watch it lady.
NELLIE
Come out now. Come out now.
CHEF
Just stay still, Eric. Mom knows what she's doing.
NELLIE
You all come out of there now.
["The Other Side".]
ANNOUNCER
At a very young age one young boy learned he had a special gift. This is "The Other Side." [the curtain rises to reveal Stan on set with the studio audience clapping. He steps forward and the curtain falls down behind him]
STAN
Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully. [the applause dies down] This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay? [puts his hand to his temple] They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter.
WOMAN 5
[jumps up] Yes! Yes, my Peter! [begins to sob]
AUDIENCE
Wow!! [begins to clap]
STAN
No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, "Peter was your husband?"
WOMAN 5
[sobbing] Yes, yes! Yes, my husband Peter!
AUDIENCE
Wow!! [begins to clap]
WOMAN 6
Oh wow!
STAN
[getting annoyed] Stop it! I didn't do anything!
MAN 9
[rises and accuses] You knew Peter was dead!
STAN
[reminding] I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, "They want me to acknowledge Peter." That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, "I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely."
WOMAN 5
[sobbing] Yes, it was.
AUDIENCE
Wow!! [begins to clap]
MAN 10
Amazing!
WOMAN 7
Ask Peter if he knows my little Billy.
STAN
[frustrated, with right hand over his clenched eyelids] Okay. Let's back up. [each audience row backs up to the one behind it] Not literally!
[McElroy manor, night. Nellie is still working on Cartman. He's laying on a bed, and Chef's dad helps in the exorcism.]
THOMAS
In the name of all that is holy we demand this spirit be set free!
CARTMAN
Ahh, Aahhhh! [the adults back away from the bed. Soon, an orange glow appears on Cartman's belly]
THOMAS
There we go! We're gettin' somethin' now!
NELLIE
Come on out, spirit. Go!
THOMAS
Come on out hyow! It's safe! [Cartman groans with the pain Kenny's spirit is causing him. Thomas quickly moves to the foot of the bed] Here it comes! The spirit is comin' out hyuh! [a timer goes off]
NELLIE
Oooo, that's the potatoes. [she removes all her costume and heads to the kitchen]
THOMAS
[a few seconds later] Well hold on the potatoes two seconds, woman! [Nellie stops and turns around] The soul's comin' out hyuh! [Cartman writhes on the bed as Kenny's spirit now glows from Cartman's pants] It's almost done. Alright, son. Now bring me the victim child!
CHEF
The victim child?
THOMAS
Yeah. You know, the child that we sacrifice so we can put Kenny's soul into its body. [Chef looks off to his right. Liane and Thomas follow his gaze]
NELLIE
Oh Lord, they didn't bring a victim child.
CHEF
Where were we gonna find a child to sacrifice?
NELLIE
We weren't gonna ask you where you got it from. [Cartman groans once more, and Kenny's spirit bolts out and bounces around the room. The adults try to dodge it]
THOMAS
God-damnit! The spirit's out and it don't have no where to go!
NELLIE
Lord, Thomas, don't let it get on the curtains.

[The Jewleeard School, New York. Kyle is studying. Stan approaches him with a stack of papers.]
STAN
Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience.
KYLE
You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.
STAN
Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead! [throws the stack away and leaves. He reaches the front doors, opens them, and is face-to-face with John Edward]
JOHN EDWARD
So, you think you can talk to dead people better than me, huh?!
STAN
No, I don't think either one of us can. [Kyle gets up from his seat and leaves the room]
JOHN EDWARD
They told me your show is getting better ratings than mine, that you're saying I'm a fraud on your show! You'd better not ever call me a liar, or a fake, or a douche again, or else I'll sue you for slander!
STAN
I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever!
JOHN EDWARD
Everything I tell people is positive and gives them hope! How does that make me a douche?!
STAN
Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche!
JOHN EDWARD
I'M NOT A DOUCHE! And I challenge you to a psychic showdown! I'll prove to the world that I'm psychic and you're not!
STAN
Fine, douche! [slams one door on him...]
JOHN EDWARD
I'm not a douche! [...then the other]
[The McElroy manor, night. Kenny's spirit is now in the living room flitting about. Thomas enters with a broom, swinging it around to capture it somehow.]
THOMAS
Well come on, the soul's in here! It can't escape now. [Liane and Chef enter the room] It's goin' to the light! Unfortunately, it's the livin' room light.
NELLIE
I'll open a window, you try to chase it out, Thomas.
THOMAS
Go on now, soul now!
NELLIE
Here, spirit, come out the window. [opens a window] I'll give you tree-fiddy. [holds out some money for the spirit]
THOMAS
Now don't go offerin' the soul no tree-fiddy, woman!
NELLIE
I'm just tryin' to persuade it.
THOMAS
Well I know, but you can at least start at about two quarter or somethin' [the spirit comes out of the light and flits out of the living room] Aw Christmas, there it goes again!
NELLIE
[drops the money] It's headin' for the kitchen! Aw, Thomas, the pot roast! [heads for the kitchen after the spirit]
[The McElroy manor, kitchen. Kenny's spirit flits in and bounces around the kitchen. The adults enter, hot on its trail.]
THOMAS
Over here!
LIANE
Get it down.
NELLIE
Don't let it get in the roast! [the spirit moves over the roast. The others move with it, but the spirit dives into the pot roast, making it bounce. The adults crowd in and look at the pot roast]
THOMAS
Oh. Well. I guess the child's a pot roast now.
CHEF
What do we do with it now?
NELLIE
[turns around to get something] Well I'll wrap it up with some plastic wrap so you can take it home with ya. Should last a few months in the freezer. [turns around with a box of Saran Wrap]
CARTMAN
[entering refreshed] Hey, ah I feel a lot better.
CHEF
Eric, you're okay! [the others gather around him. Liane kneels to hug him]
LIANE
Oh, baby, your time is back!
NELLIE
[lays a hand on Cartman's head and pronounces] This child is clean.
[The John Edward studio.]
ANNOUNCER
Ladies and Gentlemen, it's "Psychic Showdown." Here are John Edward, and Stan Marsh. [both of them enter and get on stage. The studio audience applauds]
JOHN EDWARD
Thank you. [the applause dies down. He turns to Stan] Alright, asshole! I know you're here to try to throw me off, so go ahead. Give me your best shot!
STAN
No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience.
JOHN EDWARD
Wah-why?
STAN
You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all just stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole? [the audience is listening] We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche. [more audience listening, reflection. Kyle is present. One man claps, then others clap with him, then murmurs are heard]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS
Yes. Right. Yeah. [John looks angrily at Stan]
KYLE
[now next to Stan with fake beard in hand] You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever.
STAN
Yeah.
JOHN EDWARD
But I do have a special power! I know I do!
STAN
There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself.
JOHN EDWARD
God-damnit, I'm special!! [a rumble is heard, the studio shakes, and a bright light shines from above. John, Stan and Kyle look up in wonder]
MAN 11
What the?
WOMAN 8
Aaaah! [the ceiling above the studio begins to crack, and a huge red spacecraft breaks through, descending to the ground. Stan and Kyle step back. The craft settles down and a door opens downward to become a staircase. Aliens appear and descend the stairs]
LEAD ALIEN
[with two noses, and a pair of eyes for each nose. The eyes stick out like antennae] Greetings from the Jannex Galaxy. [the other aliens take a bow] We seek the great John Edward.
JOHN EDWARD
Why that... that's me!
LEAD ALIEN
Sir, it is an honor to meet you. [extends his... "hand"]
JOHN EDWARD
[extends his hand and gives the alien a handshake] Well, thank you very much! [looks smugly at Stan]
STAN
No, it can't be.
LEAD ALIEN
I am Quagmar, and this is the Intergalactic BDIU Committee. Mr. Edward, it is my honor to inform you that you have been nominated for Biggest Douche In the Universe! [the other aliens clap]
JOHN EDWARD
What?!
ALIEN 2

ALIEN 3
[with four arms] Congratulations!
STAN
Oh, dude! [smiles]
LEAD ALIEN
If you step into our plabpa feed, we'll give you a first-class ride to the awards show. [the aliens escort him into the spacecraft]
JOHN EDWARD
No, wait! I'm not a douche! I make people feel good about themselves! [the door closes and the spacecraft takes off] I give people resolution! [the craft is seen going straight up, then off in a random direction. Stan and Kyle look on, then they turn around]
STAN
Now do you people believe me?
MAN 12
Well I don't know. How did Edward know my father died in March?
[Denver International Airport, day. Cartman, Liane, and Chef exit the airport.]
CARTMAN

CHEF
Well, come on. We'd better get Kenny back to his parents. Wait a minute. Who's got the pot roast?
LIANE

The roast is labeled "Chef McElroy, South Park"] and his life changed forever. [he's taken the roast home and is carving it up and eating it. He senses something is wrong] Now he's sharing his body with an eight-year-old boy. [first, on a hobby elephant as the kids watch then, in Kenny's room getting dressed; then, waiting at the bus stop with Stan, Kyle, and Cartman] And he's about to find out [now getting on his desk and dancing] that being eight [now on all fours attempting to kiss Millie. Barbrady and partner show up; next, he's running down the street trying to escape the officers] ain't so great.

synopsis:When a 32-year-old man claiming to be Stan from the future shows up in South Park, young Stan is forced to come to terms with the loser he will become.

script:My Future Self n' Me

[South Park, woods, night. Six boys look at a tree stump surrounded by litter. They are Jimmy, Tolkien, Craig, Clyde, Kyle, and Cartman. Kyle is carrying a black trash bag. On the stump is a marijuana joint and some paper.]
KYLE
[thrusts the bag at Clyde] Throw it away, Clyde!
CLYDE
I'm not gonna touch it. You throw it away.
STAN
[arriving] What's going on?
KYLE
[points at the joint] Some high schoolers left their marijuana cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw it away before some kids find it or something.
STAN
So throw it away.
CLYDE
Nobody wants to touch it.
KYLE
What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say?
CRAIG
Yeah, didn't you see that commercial where it says that if you have pot you could become a terrorist?
CLYDE
And the commercial where the two kids have pot and the one kids shoots the other. Harmless?
STAN
You guys, those commercials are just exaggerations.
TOLKIEN
How do you know? None of us had ever had any drugs before.
JIMMY
Well, I did Ecstasy once. [the other boys look at him] Me and my girlfriend took it and we stayed up all night having... sex. [the other boys just stare]
KYLE
...Where did you have sex with her?
JIMMY
In her... va-vagina. [smiles, but the other boys remain silent] Thank you, thank you. What a terrific audience.
STAN
[annoyed at his friends' skittishness] It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.
CARTMAN
[takes the bag from Kyle and offers it to Stan] Then you throw it away, smartass. [Stan walked into that one]
STAN
Fine, I will. [takes the bag and walks over to the stump, faces the boys, and tosses the joint into the bag] There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal.
[South Park, night. To the sound of dramatic music, lightning relentlessly flashes all over town. Stan's house is shown as lightning strikes it. In the living room Stan watches "The Osbournes" with his grandfather. Ozzy is shown in his living room talking to his kids.]
OZZY
You kids fucking don't fuck around with your fucking mom!
JACK
Dad, we fucking can't! It's a big flick a fuck!
SHARON
[enters scolding] Stan, what did I tell you about watching The Osbournes?
STAN
Aw, come on, Mom.
SHARON
It's going to make you retarded! [starts flipping channels, then settles on a news report, then walks away]
STAN
It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!
GRANDPA MARVIN
Oh goody. Now we can watch the news.
TOM
In other news, South Park police are still looking for a craaazy man who terrorized the town one hour ago. [a silhouette of a man running is behind the words "CRAZY MAN" and a question mark is on the silhouette] The man claimed to be from the future and ran naked through the city streets screaming "The past! The past! Oh my God, it's the past!" Which is what one would expect someone from the future to yell. [a knock is heard on the front door, Sharon goes to answer it. Before her stands a disheveled man with long brown hair and stubbly beard. He's wrapped in a large towel and wears a blue cap with red piping and puff, like Stan does]
NAKED MAN
[slurring his voice] Oh my God, it's the past! [looks at Sharon] Oh, whoa man, it's you!
SHARON
Who are you?
NAKED MAN
It's me, Mom, your son Stan. [Sharon looks shocked, and the camera zooms in on that. Behind her, still watching TV, are Stan and Marvin. Stan looks over]
RANDY
[joining Sharon at the door] Who is it, Sharon?
NAKED MAN
Dad!
RANDY
Dad?? Look! We don't know you and you don't know us! Just go away before we call the police!
STAN
[rises from the sofa and walks over] Who the fuck is it, Mom and Dad?
NAKED MAN
No way, it's me from the past! [looks quite relieved]
STAN
I'm me from the past?
FUTURE STAN
[genuflects to Stan, who leans back a bit] No, I'm you from the future! [rises, and Randy helps him up] Oh man, this is so messed up.
RANDY
[pushing the man out the door] Okay, we've had enough!
FUTURE STAN
Your name's Randy Marsh, you're a geologist, and you don't like chicken. Mom, your maiden name is Kimble and you have a scar on your left knee from when you slipped in the swimming pool.
SHARON
[in hushed tones] Randy, what's going on?
RANDY
[in hushed tones] I don't know.
FUTURE STAN
Dude, just let me talk to you for like, five minutes. After that I'll bail.
[The Marsh dining room. The naked man is now dressed in street clothes and seated at the head of the table. He's enjoying a beer and regular cigarette. The others look dazed and confused at the man as he recounts his memories.]
FUTURE STAN
I can still remember when I was five and you both found that squirrel I'd been keeping in the closet and, you let me keep it for another week and then it ran away but... I know that's just what you told me. I know that Mom had actually let it out.
RANDY
How could he possibly know all that unless... he is our son from the future.
SHARON
But why are you back in this time with us, son?
FUTURE STAN
I have no idea, man. I was just about to go asleep in an alley behind the crackhouse, [Stan is aghast at what he would become] and I shot up a little heroin, and then this electrical storm started. Next thing I knew I was running around in my own past, man. I thought... I was just tripping, but then I came down and I was still here. Oh, dude, it's so bizarre!
STAN
Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana!
RANDY
[laying hands on the man's shoulder] Stan, whatever's happened, we going to help you.
SHARON
[reaching out] That's right. We're a family no matter what time shift.
FUTURE STAN
Thanks. Can I get another beer?
SHARON
You must be exhausted. Why don't you get some sleep?
FUTURE STAN
That'd be killer. Where can I crash?
SHARON
Well I'm sure Stan wouldn't mind sharing his room, would you, Stan?
STAN
What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no! [squeezes his eyes shut and buries them in his right hand]
SINGER
Here we are, face to face, "My Future Self -n- Me"
[Stan and Future Stan stroll down a road. Future Stan has a beer]
STAN
[right at the camera] Stop it.
SINGER
So much alike, and yet so different
STAN
[Stan's future self joins him in bed after freshening up in the bathroom] No.
SINGER
One of them's messy, the other one's clean!
[Stan's future self turns off the light while Stan looks pissed off]
Gettin' along isn't always easy, sometimes we disagree
[Stan's future self brushes his teeth as Stan stands next to him, avoiding him. Future Stan spits his frothy toothpaste into the sink]
STAN
Quit it.
SINGER
But in the end we know we're good for each other
[both Stans eat cereal, but the future Stan has trouble pouring milk into his bowl. It splashes out of the bowl along with some cereal. Stan just buries his face in his hands in frustration]
Two peas in a pod, Future Self -n- Me
Future Self -n- Me, Future Self -n-
[Now they have separate beds. Stan turns the light off and tries to sleep. Future Stan reaches over to turn it on. Stan moves to turn it off, and they fight over the switch until one of them sleeps]
Me
[Bus stop, next day. Stan arrives with future Stan.]
STAN
Hey guys.
KYLE, CARTMAN
Hey.
FUTURE STAN
Whoa, Kyle and Cartman! It's so cool to see you guys.
CARTMAN
Who's this asshole?
STAN
This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.
KYLE
Wow. That's pretty cool.
CARTMAN
Then how does he know our names?
KYLE
'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows.
CARTMAN
Ohhh. Wait. Stan becomes this douchebag?
FUTURE STAN
Yeah, I spent a lot of my teenage years on a slow downward spiral experimenting with drugs and alcohol. [Cartman has a hearty laugh]
STAN
Shut up, Cartman!
CARTMAN
That is so awesome!! Thank you God! [bows deeply] Oh praise God!
KYLE
Hey, what happens to me in the future?
FUTURE STAN
Oh, I don't know. You guys stayed away from drugs, so you're okay. I just lost touch with you after I was sent to Juvi Hall in 2006.
CARTMAN
[pats Stan on the back] Juvi Hall! [laughs heartily, then gloats] Stan's a loser! Stan's a loser! [laughs heartily]
STAN
[under his breath] God-damnit!
[South Park Elementary, after school, Garrison's classroom. Stan and Butters are seated next to each other, and there are no other kids around.]
STAN
Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters.
BUTTERS
Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden?
STAN
I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him.
BUTTERS
Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success.
STAN
I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy! [gets off his seat and starts pacing the floor] Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!
BUTTERS
I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too.
STAN
Yeah, it's like everything I do, he... [stops and then looks at Butters] Wait a minute, what'd you say?
BUTTERS
I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid. [Stan is surprised by this account]
STAN
[after a moment] Dude, how long has your future self been around?
BUTTERS
Oh. I guess it's been about four months now.
STAN
Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself from the future??
BUTTERS
Nobody asked.
STAN
Where is he now?
BUTTERS
Probably watching Becker.
[Butters' house, afternoon. A future Butters is watching TV and eating chips at the sofa.]
BECKER
My name is T. Becker. The T stand for Terrific. [laughs. Future Butters finds this quite funny. Stan and Butters enter the house to meet future Butters.]
BUTTERS
See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,-
FUTURE BUTTERS
Stan! Sure I remember you. Yep. Wearing that puff-ball hat like always.
LINDA
[walks in with a plate holding a glass of water and a bottle] Oh, hello boys. Future Butters, it's time to take your liver medicine.
STAN
Liver medicine?
BUTTERS
Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school. [an air of determination appears] I need to learn to behave myself! [Stan crosses his arms and gets mad, then bolts for the door] Hey! Where are you going, Stan? [follows Stan out.]
[Stan's house, moments later. Stan rushes into his room with Butters in tow.]
STAN
Alright, where is that son-of-a-bitch's wallet?!
BUTTERS
Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh Stan?
STAN
Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane? [starts rifling through future Stan's clothes]
BUTTERS
Well we both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then.
STAN
Here it is. [pulls out a wallet and reads the license. It's from the future, with LOSER printed in large letters on it and an expiration date of 10-19-2043] It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this? [pulls out a Motivation Corp. key card, expiring on 12/26/02] This expires in two thousand two. Why would he have this in his wallet?
BUTTERS
I don't follow.
STAN
[flips the card over to see the info on the other side] Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters. [heads out the door.]
BUTTERS
[excitedly] Oh! Are we out for an adventure? [follows Stan out]
[Denver, night. A bus drives up to a curb on the seedy street, then takes off. Stan and Butters walk down the street.]
STAN
Here it is. Motivation Corp. [the camera pans up to show the name of the building. Stan puts the card into the reader next to the door. The door opens and Stan heads in.]
BUTTERS
[turns away. Stan stops right at the entrance] I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else.
STAN
[walks up to Butters] Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go. [heads in]
BUTTERS
Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan? [follows Stan in and closes the door.]
[Motivation Corp., interior. Stan and Butters look down a long hallway. Stan notices a window and looks in. Several workers are at their computers matching kids up with actors who are to portray their futures selves.]
STAN
What the hell is going on here?
A VOICE
It should take about a month to achieve the results you want. [Stan hears the voice and pulls Butters behind some bushes underneath the window. Stan peeks out over the bushes. The director appears with a couple ] Well, Mr. and Mrs. Brooks, I think you're going to be very pleased with the results.
MR. BROOKS
We sure hope so. We just don't know how to talk to our son about drugs.
DIRECTOR
Well now you won't have to! Ah, here he is. This is Josh Casher. He'll be playing the role of your future son.
JOSH
Nice to meet you, "Mom and Dad." [they all laugh heartily]
MRS. BROOKS
My goodness, he does look a little like Kevin.
DIRECTOR
Yes, and he knows all your family history and every detail of your house. And he's worked up quite a future for your son.
JOSH
I'm going to tell him that I dropped out of school and went to prison for eight years, where I was sodomized. In the ass.
MRS. BROOKS
Woohoo, that should get Kevin to stay clear of drugs.
MR. BROOKS
Heh it sure should, heh.
DIRECTOR
Alright, so we'll put the fake news report out on Tuesday night. Make sure your son is watching the Channel 4 News.
MR. BROOKS
Oh, and that's when uh you'll fake the electrical storm as well?
DIRECTOR
Motivation Corp. takes care of everything. [hands out some stapled sheets of paper] Just follow these simple scripts when your actor arrives.
MRS. BROOKS
[reads from her script] "Listen to me, you crazy person, there's no way you can be from the future." Oh this is going to be fun.
[Motivation Corp., interior. Stan hurries out of there with Butters close behind.]
STAN
I can't believe it! It's all a scam!
BUTTERS
Yeah, I can't believe it!
STAN
They've all been lying to us this whole time!
BUTTERS
This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this? [thinks about this a minute. Stan lowers his eyelids to half-closed as he realizes Butters is still clueless] Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject.
STAN
[closes his eyes a bit, then] Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated!
BUTTERS
Eh, but then why did they come back to the past.
STAN
They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!
BUTTERS
Oh... Oohhhh. [Stan rolls his eyes] But that's like they're lyin'.
STAN
It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it!
BUTTERS
Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay!
STAN
Who's that?
BUTTERS
You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder!
STAN
What?
BUTTERS
Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret! [heads off. This time, Stan follows]
[Butters' house, later. An upper light is on. Butters leads Stan into his bedroom.]
BUTTERS
Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see. [slides his closet door open, steps inside the closet, and slides the door shut]
STAN
We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!
BUTTERS
[jumps out of the closet and cackles] Now you know my terrible secret!
STAN
...You're gay? [Butters loses his moment] It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care.
BUTTERS
Huh? Naw, I'm Professor Chaos, Stan.
STAN
But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to! [walks off]
BUTTERS
[walks downtrodden to the mirror and looks at himself] Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver.
[Stan's room, next day. Stan and Butters are on the floor. Butters is reading the newspaper as Stan watches on.]
BUTTERS
How about this? Winter Park. It looks kinda nice.
STAN
No, we gotta run away somewhere warm.
BUTTERS
Wow, look at this, Stan. [reads from the paper] "Are you sick of your parents? Do you want revenge for something they've done to you? Call the Parental Revenge Center of Western America for a free con-sul-ta-tion. Results guaranteed."
STAN
[heading for the phone] Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing. [picks up the phone receiver and starts punching in the numbers]
BUTTERS
Hey look, somebody lost their cat.
STAN
Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America? [listens for the answer] Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?
BUTTERS
Look, you can make your wiener bigger in just three weeks.
STAN
[still on the phone] Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please? [listens and writes down the address] Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?
BUTTERS
This lady'll massage your wiener for ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty good deal.
STAN
Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you. [hangs up] That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!
BUTTERS
[rises on his knees] Hah-hey, I wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents, too.
STAN
Fine, then you can come with me. [heads out the door]
BUTTERS
Hooray! [follows him out] And then we can make our wieners bigger, and have the lady massage them.
[South Park, commercial district. Stan and Butters run down the street and turn the corner into an alley. Stan checks the address.]
STAN
I guess this is it.
[Parental Revenge Center of Western America. The headquarters are quite shabby. What looks like computers and monitors are just cardboard boxes with crude drawings on them. Stan and Butters enter. They look around as they approach the main desk.]
STAN
Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?
CARTMAN
[an egg-shaped chair is seen, with its back to the boys] Yes, come in, please. [the chair turns around, and Cartman appears seated on it.]
STAN
Cartman??
CARTMAN
Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was you guys.
STAN
What the hell are you doing here?!
CARTMAN
I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock?
BUTTERS
You're the Parental Revenge Center of Western America??
STAN
God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go. [both boys turn and walk towards the door]
CARTMAN
Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then? [Stan and Butters stop in their tracks] Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer?
STAN
[turns around] Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!
CARTMAN
That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've been helping children get back at their parents ever since.
STAN
How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!
CARTMAN
Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you. [Stan and Butters think a moment, then take seats before Cartman]
STAN
Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.
CARTMAN
[lets out a heavy sigh] God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh?
BUTTERS
Yeah!
CARTMAN
Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way.
STAN
How much is this going to cost us?
CARTMAN
Eighteen thousand dollars. [Stan looks angry, Butters looks to him for guidance] How about just... three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five. [Stan still looks angry, Butters follows] How about five bucks?
[Motivation Corp., day.]
DIRECTOR
So, everything is working out with your future actor? Your son seems to be responding.
RANDY
I think he's pretty scared alright.
SHARON
It's just a little weird having people lying to our boy like this.
DIRECTOR
Well, you know what us ultra-liberals say, when it comes to children and drugs, lies are OK. The ends justify the means. We'll take smoking, for instance. The truth is there's no hard evidence that second-hand smoke can kill but, we believe it's okay to lie about it as long as it gets people to stop smoking.
SHARON
Well that makes sense.
DIRECTOR
So it is with everything here at Motivation Corp. It's okay for us to lie and tell kids that all marijuana supports terrorism. [a shot of a marijuana leaf superimposed over the burning World Trade Center] Or that... one pill of Ecstasy is gonna kill them. It's not necessarily true, but the ends justify the means.
RANDY
Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us.
[Parental Revenge Center of Western America. Cartman prepares to lay out his plans for Stan and Butters. His cap is gone, as is the egg-shell chair.]
CARTMAN
Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here. [displays a few brochures and opens one] What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop.
BUTTERS
Hwuhh. That'll make them awful sore.
CARTMAN
Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches. [displays some swatches with poop samples on them]
BUTTERS
Poop- poop swatches?
CARTMAN
Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents.
BUTTERS
Hey, that's neato, huh, Stan?
CARTMAN
Now, personally, I like the baby green. [switches to a new swatch] But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house.
BUTTERS
Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional, Eric! I don't know which swatch I like best.
CARTMAN
Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom.
BUTTERS
Well that sounds good.
CARTMAN
Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice.
BUTTERS
Hooray!
CARTMAN
Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school.
STAN
[brightly] Yeah.
CARTMAN
The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office.
STAN
Yeah.
CARTMAN
Your parents will drive all the way out to the school discovering that no meeting is actually taking place.
STAN
Yeah!
CARTMAN
And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop. [Stan's excitement vanishes]
BUTTERS
Wow! Neato!
STAN
That's not neato, that sucks.
CARTMAN
What?
STAN
You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought each revenge was unique and customized!
CARTMAN
Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches.
STAN
Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have to admit that they lied to me!
CARTMAN
Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations. [throws the brochure away and gets some paper from inside the desk] Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog.
STAN
Dude!
CARTMAN
Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday?
STAN
No, that's too extreme!
CARTMAN
[sighs] Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme; where do you want it?
STAN
Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing! [leaves his seat and heads for the door.]
CARTMAN
I am a professional, suh! [watches Stan leave] Don't worry, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied.
[The Marsh house, day. All the Marshes are at the dining room table eating tacos and chips.]
STAN
Hey future self.
FUTURE STAN
Yes, former self?
STAN
You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hole in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about? [future Stan looks at Stan as if the boy were crazy] You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep?
FUTURE STAN
Oh, uh...
STAN
You must know what I'm talking about.
FUTURE STAN
Sure uh, uh, [quickly rises from the table and walks toward the dining room entrance] oh man, could you all excuse me for a second? I think I'm gonna crap my pants. [leaves. Stan crosses his arms, quite annoyed]
SHARON
Uh, Stan, [Randy stops eating his taco and looks at Stan] don't you think you're upsetting your future self a little?
RANDY
Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself.
STAN
Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future. [Sharon and Randy shift in their chairs]
RANDY
Oh. You. You don't?
STAN
No. [plants his hands along the table's edge] You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax! [crosses his arms again] And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me! [uncrosses his arms] See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across.
RANDY
Well, you know what I think, Stan?
STAN
What?
RANDY
I think he IS from the future.
SHARON
Yeah, he must be. [Stan looks at them with eyebrows knitting] It's like, I just feel he's our son, you know?
RANDY
Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get rid of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol.
SHARON
Right. [Stan looks at them with anger, then looks forward with anger]
[Butters' house, day. There's a Hispanic crew in the house painting the walls with two kinds of poop colors. The furniture is covered. Cartman enters and walks around the living room.]
CARTMAN
Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe! [a painter descends from the small ladder he's on] The classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop!
FELIPE
¿Qué? ¿La caca no esta aquí? ["What? The poop isn't here?"]
CARTMAN
¡La caca de moreno no es aquí! ¡Aquí es verde, señor! ¡Es verde! ¡Arriba arriba!
FELIPE
¡Sí, sí señor! ["Yes, yes sir!"]
CARTMAN
Sí, gracias. ¿Y tú? [looks in another part of the living room] ¡Carlos! ¡Carlos, no! We want a textured effect on the nut-n-corn crunch poop. That's why we [sees a sponge on the floor and picks it up] spackle with the sponge. [dips the sponge into a poop tray and spackles the wall with it] See? Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado.
CARLOS
Sí. Marrado. ["Yes. Gently"]
CARTMAN
Marrado. Spectacularrr.
CARLOS
Sí. [takes the sponge from Cartman and begins spackling]
CARTMAN
God, it's so hard to find good help. [runs into Butters, who has just entered the house] Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far?
BUTTERS
Boy, it sure is stinky in here!
CARTMAN
Yearh, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice.
BUTTERS
Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and I don't think-
CARTMAN
Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I? [notices another worker] ¡Pepite, Pepite, no! ¡No come la taco la trabajar!
[The Marsh house, night. Randy and Sharon talk with the future Stan.]
FUTURE STAN
Yes, well, it's hard to find work in commercials, so I ended up- [the front door opens]
RANDY
Oh, Stan! [Sharon and Future Stan look. Stan enters the dining room]
FUTURE STAN
Oh, dude, how's it goin', man? Ey, you wanna go upstairs and play hide and go seek?
STAN
[takes a seat at the table] Hide and go seek, huh?!
RANDY
Yeah, Stan, why don't you go upstairs and play with yourself?
STAN
I don't believe that he's my future self!
RANDY
Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh?
STAN
No, I actually have a way to be sure. [whips out a meat cleaver in his right hand and places his left wrist on the table] I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear.
SHARON
[rises frantically] S-stanley you don't need to do that. He-he is your future self.
STAN
But I have to know for sure. [readies the cleaver]
RANDY
[stammers] Don't be silly, Stan. You don't wanna go through life without one of your hands. [Sharon is fearful]
STAN
Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it.
RANDY
Stan...
STAN
Yes?
RANDY
Uh... nothing. Go ahead.
SHARON
Randy!
STAN
[lowers the cleaver onto his wrist. The left hand falls away, and he lifts his left arm] AAAH! [a red area marks where the left hand was]
SHARON
[Low-Pitched Scream, Shrieks Loudly] AAAHHH!
RANDY
Oh my God! Look! [points. Stan looks behind his seat. Randy moves quickly to Future Stan and chops off his left hand. Blood spurts out. Stan faces the adults again as Future Stan screams in pain] What? His hand did disappear! He is you from the future!
FUTURE STAN
Oh, Jesus Christ! Help me!
STAN
That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake.
RANDY
Uh.. [tries to put Future Stan's back in place] Look, it was fake in the future, too. [Future Stan passes out in shock]
SHARON
Looks like you'd better really watch out for marijuana, huh Stan?
[Butters' house. Cartman stands with his crew behind him, their work finished.]
CARTMAN
Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off.
BUTTERS
Uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop off the walls?
CARTMAN
Ooo, ah, that's a different company. [the doorbell rings] Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! ¡Vamonos!
BUTTERS
Uh but Cartman! Wait! [once Cartman and crew leave, Butters faces the front door] Oh Christmas! [the door opens and Stan enters]
STAN
Butters!
BUTTERS
Oh, Stan!
STAN
Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here.
BUTTERS
Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden.
STAN
Butters, we're running away!
BUTTERS
We are?
STAN
Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change! [Stephen, Linda, and future Butters enter with groceries]
STEPHEN
What the hell is this?!
LINDA
Oh my God, our house!
BUTTERS
[squeezes his eyes shut and buries his face in his hands] Oh Geez, ah, I'm gonna get it now.
STEPHEN
[both parents approach with hands on hips] Butters! Do you have an explanation for this?!
BUTTERS
Oh, not really sir, I just uh...
LINDA
Wait a minute. Chris, don't you see? This might be our fault.
STEPHEN
What, uh-? My God. You're right, Linda. This is what we get for deceiving our son.
STAN
[watching his words fall apart] Huh?
STEPHEN
Butters, listen. The whole future self thing, well, it was a dirty fib.
LINDA
We just so desperately wanted you to never try drugs that we used a big scare tactic instead of ...telling you the truth.
STEPHEN
We thought the ends justified the means, but they don't. They just... don't, son! [starts crying as he and Linda hug Butters]
LINDA
We're sorry, baby. [starts crying also. Butters, feeling the love, smiles, then grins.]
STAN
Get the fuck out of here. [Randy and Sharon rush into the house]
RANDY
Stan! Stan! Oh. Okay, uh, you you might be wondering why Butters has a future self, too.
SHARON
Yes, well, eh you see, son, the time matrix pulled in more people from the future.
STAN
Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me!
RANDY
Oh... Well... Son, we've just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are.
STAN
I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!
RANDY
Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and ...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorists, but... Well son, pot makes you feel fine with being bored and... It's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or... being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything.
STAN
I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning.
SHARON
He's right. If we use lies and exaggerations to keep kids off drugs, then they're never gonna believe anything we tell them.
RANDY
Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.!
[Outside Motivation Corp., day. Randy, Sharon, Stan, and Cartman look at the building and listen at the voices coming out of it.]
DIRECTOR
Oh God, who smeared crap all over our walls?! Oh Jesus, it smells! Oh!
RANDY
You really did a nice job, Eric. [Sharon holds a box of cookies]
STAN
Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through.
CARTMAN
Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby.
SHARON
Well here, Eric, I cooked you a huge box of cookies as a present.
CARTMAN
Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should think about who I'm going to become.
FUTURE CARTMAN
[Future Cartman walks into the scene. His appearance is tall, fit, clean, handsome, and wearing a suit] Atta boy, Eric. You've made the right choice.
CARTMAN
Who the hell are you?
FUTURE CARTMAN
Haha, it's me, Cartman! You from the future. [genuflects] I came back to tell you that this is the day you turn it all around. You stop eating junk food and you start studying harder, you stay away from drugs and alcohol and you become CEO of your own time-travel company!
CARTMAN
[sets the box of cookies down] Oh wow, really? That's so awesome! Now I'll really work to be successful!
FUTURE CARTMAN
Right on!
CARTMAN
Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I'm not that stupid! Just for that, I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I want, and doin' drugs when I want! [The Marshes leave. He joins them] Whatevuh! I'll do what I want!
FUTURE CARTMAN
No, wait! [flashes of electricity runs through his body. His form becomes obese, dirty, and disheveled. His suit becomes an dirty open blue shirt over a dirty white shirt with a name tag. He also holds a tool box and a wrench] Oh, God-damnit!
End of My Future Self n' Me


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Cartman has to score one big "nice" to be eligible for Christmas presents this year. He recruits Santa, Mr. Hankey and Jesus in a desperate attempt to bring Christmas to the downtrodden citizens of Iraq.

script:Red Sleigh Down

[Cartman's house, day. In his room, Cartman has Kyle's cousin, Kyle Schwartz, tally up his good and bad deeds to see where he will end up this year. Kyle Schwartz is seated at Cartman's desk with piles of paper to go through and an adding machine to keep it all current.]
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Ah-a-a-alright, I'm done.
CARTMAN
You're done?
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Ye-yes, I-I've tallied up all the times you've been naughty and deducted the times you've been nice.
CARTMAN
Yeah, so how's it look?
KYLE SCHWARTZ
It doesn't look good, Eric. It doesn't look good.
CARTMAN
But I'll still be getting presents this year, right?
KYLE SCHWARTZ
A-a-aactually it looks like this year you're gonna owe Santa three hundred and six presents.
CARTMAN
What?!
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Four thousand three hundred and twelve instances of being naughty against three deductions of being nice, is, is bad.
CARTMAN
Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one? [lifts up a sheet from the desk]
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Yes, wa-a-I didn't think "hitting Clyde in the balls with slingshot" really counted as nice.
CARTMAN
It was nice for Tolkien; he laughed for like 20 minutes.
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Ye you can't deduct things like that, Eric. Santa will know and then he'll come after you.
CARTMAN
[lunges at Kyle Schwartz and grabs him by the left arm] God-damnit I have to get that Haibo robot doll, you sonofabitch!
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Hey hey, [Cartman lets go] I'm just your naughty-and-nice accountant! Don't blame me for the numbers!
CARTMAN
Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!
KYLE SCHWARTZ
But what, look, aren't there any other nice things you've done recently we can write off here?
CARTMAN
[thinks a minute] Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night!
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Eh... brushing your teeth isn't naughty or nice... Eric, it just, it falls more into the category of... brushing your teeth.
CARTMAN
Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it?
KYLE SCHWARTZ
If you cured cancer... and AIDS next week, you would still owe two presents.
CARTMAN
Jesus Christ!
KYLE SCHWARTZ
Ah I'm afraid you're gonna have to find a way to do... the nicest, greaatest thing anyone has ever done. Ever. [sets his glasses right]
[South Park city hall, outside, night. A decorated Christmas tree stands at one side of the entrance as the Mayor stands at the dais.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Good evening, everyone. In a moment we'll be lighting the South Park Christmas Tree to kick off the holidays!
TOWNSFOLK
Hooray!! Christmas Tree! Christmas Tree! [Everyone in town is there, and some out of towners too. Seen in the crowd are Mr. and Mrs. Stotch, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh, Shelly, Mr. Mackey, Principal Victoria, Chef and his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Broflovski, Skeeter, Dr. Mephesto and Kevin, a Visitor, Fr. Maxi, Big-Gay Al, Mr. Adler, The Thompsons, a freak, Lolly, Mr. and Mrs. McCormick, and Kevin McCormick] Christmas Tree!
CARTMAN
[walks up to Stan and Kyle, who are holding candy canes] Hi guys! ["Christmas Tree!" Cartman is feeling quite cheerful. He hugs both Stan and Kyle] A very Merry Christmas to you. God bless us, everyone! [he lets go]
KYLE
[naturally weary of Cartman's cheer] What are you doing, Cartman?
CARTMAN
I'm just letting you guys know how special you are to me.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
But now, before we light the tree, I think we should all reflect for a moment on those who are less fortunate than us. [That gets the boys' attention] Right now in Iraq there are children who fear us and what we might do to their country. The threat of war touches us all, but over in Iraq, there is no Christmas. They have nothing.
JIMBO
[to Ned] Ah I hate when the Mayor uses Christmas for her own political agenda. [uses his hands to make a megaphone and yells] Light the damn tree!
TOWNSFOLK
YEAH! Christmas Tree! Christmas Tree!
CARTMAN
Oh my God, that's it!
KYLE
What's it?
CARTMAN
Don't you see? This time of year we should be bringing Christmas to the less fortunates! Follow me! [leaves in high spirits, then returns] You guys, come on! Right now! [Stan and Kyle shrug, then follow Cartman.]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Ahalright, here to light the Christmas Tree is a very special young man who shows us all the true meaning of Christmas. Jimmy. [aide 2 sets up a small mic for Jimmy to sing into. The crowd cheers as Jimmy approaches the mic.]
JIMMY
Wow, what a terrific audience. Thank you for giving me this great honor, Mayor. B-before I l, l.. light the tree, I was wondering if I could sing... my favorite ...Christmas song, real quick.
TOWNSFOLK
[sympathizing] Awww.
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Well, we'd love a Christmas song, wouldn't we, folks?
TOWNSFOLK
Christmas songs! Christmas songs! Christmas songs!
JIMMY
Alright, h-here it goes. On the first day of C-...c...c.. chrih.. stmas my tr... t-tru-true love g-geh... g-g-geh... gave... to... m..m-m-m...m-mm-m-m... me... a pa... a pa... pah...
MR. GARRISON
Oh no. [Mr. Slave, dressed in Santa bondage suit, stands next to him]
[Cartman's house, night. Cartman is rushing out of his house with all sorts of presents. Stan and Kyle just stand there looking at him run around.]
CARTMAN
[breathlessly, comes out with the box and sets it down near the driveway] ...and here's some old toys that I don't need anymore. [rushes back inside] And here! Here's some Christmas cookies! [comes out with the box of cookies and sets it down] And some holly and mistletoe! [rushes in to get it, then comes out with the box, setting it next to the box of toys] Oh, this'll be the happiest Christmas the Middle East has ever seen! Guys, get those lights down from the door. We'll give them to the needy Iraqis, too.
STAN
Cartman, why are you doing this?
CARTMAN
They don't have Christmas there, guys. We have to give it to them.
KYLE
That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this?
A VOICE
[the boys look up and to their right] Hoooowwwwdy ho! [Mr. Hankey skips into view, from a house rooftop, to a garage rooftop, to hovering in front of the boys. Magic dust accompanies him]
KYLE
Mr. Hankey! [an instrumental of Mr. Hankey's theme song plays]
CARTMAN
[annoyed, softly] Oh I hate this stupid Christmas poo. [in normal voice] Hello, Mr. Hankey! A Merry Christmas to you!
MR. HANKEY
Gee whiz, things sure look Christmasy out here. What are you boys doin'?
KYLE
Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq.
CARTMAN
The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else.
MR. HANKEY
Well, gosh, Eric, looks like you really have the Christmas spirit! [Cartman bounces around joyously] I know someone who can help. Santa Claus!
CARTMAN
Really?
STAN, KYLE
Really?
MR. HANKEY
Sure. We should take this stuff to him right away!
KYLE
But how are we gonna get to the North Pole?
MR. HANKEY
Oh, that's no problem! We just need a little Christmas magic. [raises his little arms and stirs up some magic dust. He unleashes it on a manhole cover in the middle of the street, which begins to rumble. The sewer underneath the manhole cover bubbles up and blows the cover off, and the poo spread and swirls around. A small tornado moves from side to side, then clears away, revealing a small train made of poo.] All aboard the Poo Choo Express!
CARTMAN
Wow!
STAN
Wuh, that smells. [lifts the front of his jacket over his nose]
KYLE
Yeah. [does the same]
MR. HANKEY
Next stop, the North Pole!
CARTMAN
[grabs the box of holly and mistletoe and heads for the train] Get the rest of the stuff you guys!
STAN
Uh, I don't really wanna get on there. [Cartman stops]
KYLE
Me neither.
CARTMAN
You guys, we have to bring Christmas to those less fortunates! [moves on] Now come on!
MR. HANKEY
Let's go, Poo Choo Train! [pulls on the whistle cord]
WHISTLE
Poo Choo! [the trains lurches forward and leaves a train of poo behind. Soon it's running smoothly]
MR. HANKEY
Poo Choo Train's layin' down its tracks with a
WHISTLE
Poo Choo!
MR. HANKEY
All the way and back!
CARTMAN
Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing, spreading Christmas joy as we ride and sing!
KYLE
Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman??
STAN
I don't know.
MR. HANKEY
Christmastime wouldn't be the same without hugs and kisses and a Poo Choo Train. [from a view in space, the train is seen making its way to the North Pole]
[South Park. Jimmy is still singing.]
JIMMY
...and a par-tridge in a... p...pear t...t...tree. On the third day of C...Chrihhh...Chriiii...
[The North Pole. The Poo Choo Train pulls into view, then stops.]
MR. HANKEY
Here we are, kids. The North Pole. [Stan and Kyle run off the train and put some distance between it and themselves]
STAN
Awww! [both of them release their breath and start coughing]
KYLE
Finally!
STAN
God, it took forever!
CARTMAN
Wow, is that where Santa lives?
MR. HANKEY
That's it. Santa's Fortress of Solitude. [The fortress is shown in all its icy glory. The boys and Mr. Hankey head for the entrance. Two icy door slide apart and a gnome appears]
GNOME 1
Mr. Hankey!
MR. HANKEY
We need to see Santa right away on urgent Christmas business.
GNOME 1
Sure thing!
[The workshop. The group enters. Gnomes are busy everywhere, moving gifts around, decorating Christmas trees.]
KYLE
Hey. Aren't you guys the underpants gnomes?
GNOME 1
Ten months out of the year. But this time of year we help Santa! [leads the group out of the workshop] Here he is! [the group comes across Santa at his desk reading a list of names]
SANTA
[turns around] Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas!
STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
[impressed] Wow!
MR. HANKEY
Howdy ho, Santa!
SANTA
[with open arms, approaches] Mr. Hankey, how are you?
MR. HANKEY
All ready for Christmas?
SANTA
I was just starting to look over the new naughty and nice list the gnomes prepared for me.
CARTMAN
Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?
SANTA
Oh no, they keep it open until midnight of Christmas Eve. Some kids actually try to cram in a lot of niceness right at the end.
CARTMAN
[brushes it off] Oh, that's so lame of them. [Stan looks at him]
MR. HANKEY
Santa, my friends are trying to do something very special this Christmas. Tell him, Eric.
CARTMAN
[with hands behind his back] Well Santa, it's just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well.
SANTA
You know you're right. Santa hasn't been to that of the world in a looong time. Perhaps Santa could bring peace to this whole situation.
CARTMAN
That's what I thought.
SANTA
Gnomes! [the gnomes gather around him] Load up the sleigh with toys! Santa's going to make a special run!
MR. HANKEY
All right!
SANTA
And you boys can all watch me from our flight control room.
CARTMAN
Hooray!
[South Park. Jimmy is still singing.]
JIMMY
...and a par-tridge in a... p...pear tree. On the ...fourth day of C...C...Ca...Chriiiistmas my t-true love g-ge-gave to me-mee...
[The North Pole Flight Control Room. The gnomes and boys enter the room, which is fully decorated in Christmas cheer.]
GNOME 1
This is Santa's flight control center. From here, we can monitor Santa from satellite as he travels the globe delivering presents.
KYLE
Wow, cool!
MR. HANKEY
Hey, it looks like Santa has already made it to Baghdad. [four camera angles show Santa arriving in Baghdad: two side angles, one overhead, one front]
[Baghdad, Iraq. Santa sails over the city.]
SANTA
Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas, everyone! [the Iraqi adults stop and look up. Two presents drop down before a house, the door opens, and two kids look at the gifts with saucer eyes. They come out and pick up the gifts, grinning brightly. They glance up at Santa, then look back at their gifts] Ho ho hoo! A Merry Christmas to all!
IRAQI MAN 1
[black beard] Paka klakalaka.
IRAQI MAN 2
[white beard] Anah kakadakadaka.
SANTA
Merry Christmas! [An Iraqi man shows up with a shoulder-mounted bazooka, aims at Santa, and fires the rocket. The sleigh is hit and Santa loses control of it.] I'm hit! I'm hit! [switch to North Pole]
GNOME 1
Sleigh is hit! I repeat! Sleigh is hit! [switch to Baghdad]
GNOME 2
Ultimate failure at o-sixhundred feet! [the sleigh swings around violently, tossing Santa off. Santa holds on to one of the skids]
SANTA
Hold on! [climbs up to the sleigh cab] Sleigh is going down! [switch to North Pole]
GNOME 1
Sleigh is going down! I repeat! Sleigh is going down!
STAN
Hang on, Santa! [switch to Baghdad]
GNOME 3
[heard on the sleigh's radio] Sleigh 1 is going down! We are going down! [more chatter is heard as the sleigh heads for a crash landing. The sleigh strikes the edge of a building's rooftop and knocks away some of the façade]
GNOME 4
[on the sleigh's radio] Don't look down! Don't look down! Repeat! Don't look down! [the sleigh crashes and everyone who's on the ground looks for a place to hide. Presents are spilled all over. The area is soon empty save for Santa and the sleigh. Color vanishes. Switch to North Pole]
GNOME 1
[on the sleigh's radio] We got a red sleigh down. We got a red sleigh down. [Arabic music is heard as the boys look at the devastation] Red Sleigh 1, this is North Pole. [no response. The boys are in shock] Red Sleigh 1, this is North Pole. [no response] Mr. Kringle? [after a moment, turns around]
GNOME 5
Jesus Christ, they killed him!
CARTMAN
No! Santa Claus can't be dead. He... He can't.
STAN
Why would Iraqis do that? Why?
MR. HANKEY
It certainly doesn't seem very Christmasy of them.
SANTA
[over the radio] North Pole. This is Santa.
MR. HANKEY
Santa! Are you alright?
GNOME 2
What is your status?
SANTA
[on screen] Sleigh is down. Reindeer... all dead. Both Santa's legs are broken. Santa's... very sad. Santa will have to... oh no. They're coming for me! [the other gnomes begin to stream into the control room] Stay back, you bastards! Stay back! [the communications link is lost]
STAN
Oh no.
CARTMAN
Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him!
GNOME 5
What the hell are we supposed to do?! We're like nine inches tall!
CARTMAN
[blubbering] Now I'm never gonna get my Haibo robot doll!
KYLE
Is that what this is all about?! [Stan shoots a quizzical stare] You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?! [Stan is angry now]
CARTMAN
It's not stupid! It's a toy that you can starve! If you don't feed it, it dies. It's sooo cool.
STAN
Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!
CARTMAN
Oh, Christ.
STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
[gasp] Jesus!
MR. HANKEY
Hey, that's right. Jesus can save anybody.
GNOME 2
Follow me. You can take Santa's backup sleigh. [walks off. Mr. Hankey, the other gnomes, and the boys follow him]
[South Park City Hall. Jimmy is still singing Twelve Days of Christmas.]
JIMMY
On the fifth... day... day of... Christmas, [the townsfolk have begun to fall asleep] ...my t-true love gave to... uh... me. Five g-g-g... golden ruh-ring... rings. [one of the mayor's aides falls asleep on her shoulder] Fuhgom... don... t-t... don... four cal...ling buh-irr...
[The North Pole, Fortress of Solitude.]
GNOME 2
We fed Jesus Christ's data into the autopilot. This sleigh should be able to take you right to him.
STAN
I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead.
GNOME 2
Here it is. Red Sleigh 2. [shown with its own team of reindeer]
CARTMAN
Come on, gang, it's up to us to save Christmas!
MR. HANKEY
Tell Santa's workers to keep making toys. We'll have Santa back in no time!
KYLE
Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing?
GNOME 2
You just have to call out the reindeer's names.
CARTMAN
Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet-
GNOME 2
No, no, they're all dead. You have to call out the new ones. [each reindeer is highlighted as its name is called] On Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel. [the reindeer move forward and the sleigh soon rises into the sky] Good luck finding Jesus! [waves goodbye after them]
[The night sky. The boys sail along the winds.]
CARTMAN
Wow, look, you guys! We're riding in Santa's sleigh!
MR. HANKEY
We should be able to find Jesus in no time!
CARTMAN
I'm riding in Santa's sleigh. So high above the trees at Christmastime. With candy-cane wishes and smiles-
KYLE
What are you doing?
CARTMAN
[looks at Kyle, then lowers his eyelids a bit] I'm having a precious Christmastime moment, Kyle, if you don't mind.
KYLE
Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down!
CARTMAN
[draws close to Kyle] Hey, it isn't my fault that Iraqis are filled with hate!
KYLE
All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that!
CARTMAN
[resumes his position in back of the sleigh and speeds up his song] It's Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with candy canes and chimney smiles, eh...
[South Park City Hall. Jimmy is still singing Twelve Days of Christmas. The townsfolk get sleepier.]
JIMMY
Six geese are laying... fu...five go-oldenh ...uhrings. Fodom... dom... du...du...t...du... Four calling biiirds...
[Baghdad. Santa is being hauled down a hall by three Iraqi soldiers. He's got bruises here and there, a bloody nose, a black eye. They enter a room.]
SANTA
Where are you taking me?? [one soldier seems to order the other two to strap Santa into a chair] You are all being very naughty. [a general enters]
IRAQI GENERAL
[soft-spoken] Why you come to Iraq, my main man?
SANTA
[a soldier ladles some water onto Santa] To bring happiness and joy to the children.
IRAQI GENERAL
And this is...? [carries a toy train and dangles a car in front of Santa] This is what you think brings happy? [walks behind Santa] This is material... [thrusts the toy train at Santa over the shoulder] This is commercialism! Your country is sick. Sick! [throws the toy train onto Santa's body and walks away]
SANTA
No, your country has just lost all its Christmas spirit. [a soldier approaches and opens Santa's pants.] What's going on here?!
IRAQI GENERAL
America wants to bomb my house, my main man. They want to kill my wife and children. We need to know... what is their plan?
SANTA
I don't know, I live in the North Pole. [the general leaves, then soon returns with two rods attached to cables. A soldier cranks up the device they're connected to] What are you doing??
IRAQI GENERAL
They say that the Chinese were the first to experiment with an electroshock to the testicles.
SANTA
Oh no. Not Santa's balls! [The general descends on Santa's balls and makes them glow. This part is not shown, save for a shot of Santa's back and a glow coming from the front side. A few seconds later the general removes the rods and rises, and the glow fades. Santa coughs]
IRAQI GENERAL
What else is America planning?!
SANTA
[coughs some more, spits, and faces the general] I'm gonna fucking kill you!
IRAQI GENERAL
You're not in a position to kill anyone, my main man! I just want you to tell me America's plan!
SANTA
Then we're in for a long night, because I don't know shit! [the general glances at the soldier, who ratchets the charger up higher. Santa screams in pain]
[An Italian church. Jesus stands at the altar receiving parishioners, blessing them for one thing or another.]
JESUS
[blessing an elderly man with a few drops of wine] In nome del mio padre, siete guarito. ["In the name of my Father, you are healed."]
ELDERLY MAN
[as he is led away] Benedicali! Benedicali! ["Bless you! Bless you!"]
WOMAN
Jesus, mio bambino no puoi sentirsi. ["Jesus, my son can't feel himself." (he's numb)]
JESUS
[blesses the infant] Il vostro bambino se arguisto. ["Your son ..."]
WOMAN
Bene, Benedicali! ["Bless, bless you!" The boys' voices are now heard inside the church and the congregants look around. The sleigh crashes though a window and glass showers down over Jesus and the other people present] La morte rossa! ["The red death!" The sleigh alights and stops]
MR. HANKEY
Hooowdy ho! [the churchgoers panic and run out of the church.]
CARTMAN
Jesus!
JESUS
Stan, Kyle, Mr. Hankey and Eric Cartman. What are you doing here, my children?
STAN
Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq!
JESUS
Santa? Is he alright?
KYLE
We don't know. They lost all contact with him.
JESUS
We have to get him out of there.
MR. HANKEY
Do you know a way?
JESUS
Yes. Yes, I think I do. [approaches an ornate cabinet] We need a little Christmas miracle. [slides the door open to reveal an armory. He starts taking out an Uzi] Lock and load! We're goin' in!
[South Park City Hall. Jimmy is still singing Twelve Days of Christmas. The townsfolk get sleepier.]
JIMMY
On the s...seventh day of Christmas my t...true love...
[The interrogation room. The general continues shock treatment on Santa's balls.]
IRAQI GENERAL
You're a sick capitalist dog, my main man! [jabs the balls again, and Santa howls in pain]
[Baghdad. Jesus, Mr. Hankey, and the boys arrive and sail over the city.]
CARTMAN
This is Baghdad? God, what a shithole! [Jesus looks over, Cartman notices] I mean, oh wow, these poor unfortunate people.
GNOME
Red Sleigh 2, come in.
STAN
We're here.
GNOME
You're coming up on the source of the signal. You're right on top of him!
JESUS
He must be in that building below us. Land it on the roof, Mr. Hankey.
MR. HANKEY
Howdy ho, Jesus. [the sleigh lands and a rooftop door opens.]
SOLDIER 1
[clean-shaven] Gankueda!
JESUS
[steps off the sleigh and holds his arms up] Wait here, I can handle this.
SOLDIER 2
[bearded] Kinkeda? Kinkakueda!
JESUS
Yay, look upon me, and know me.
SOLDIER 1
Halak balah!
SOLDIER 2
Kli malah!
JESUS
My children, you should know something. [a dagger shoots out and gets into position by his left arm] I'm packing. [quickly jabs the clean-shaven soldier in the throat, and the soldier gags to death. A gun with silencer descends along Jesus' right arm. He takes that and quickly kills the bearded soldier. He calls out to the others on the sleigh] Let's go! [Mr. Hankey and the boys leave the sleigh]
CARTMAN
This is such a magical Christmas adventure, you guys.
[South Park City Hall. Jimmy is still singing Twelve Days of Christmas. The townsfolk get sleepier.]
JIMMY
On the el- el- el- eleventh day of C- Christmas my t...true love gave to me, e-eleven p-p-pipers p-pu-p-piping...
[The interrogation room. The general is now making Santa swallow a can of oil.]
IRAQI GENERAL
Drink it! Drink the oil! This is all you Western capitalists want! [Jesus bursts through the door.]
SANTA
Jesus Christ! [Jesus kills the soldier at the charging station, then the other soldier. The general holds up his hands. Jesus shoots him on the left know and he falls.]
IRAQI GENERAL
Ach!
SANTA
Oh! Thank! Thank God for you, Jesus! [Jesus walks up to Santa and unties him]
JESUS
Here. [hands him a gun] Can you walk?
SANTA
Santa's legs are broken. [Jesus moves his hands over them, then steps back]
JESUS
They are healed. [walks off. Santa follows, but turns around to face the general, who is cowering now. Santa fixes his gaze on the general and aims the gun. After a few intense moments Santa moves the gun off and fires twice. Jesus comes up behind Santa] Santa...
SANTA
I just couldn't do it. [Santa didn't miss after all. The general got one bullet to the brain, another one that split his head open] I just couldn't let him live. He shocked Santa's balls! [sirens go off]
MR. HANKEY
More soldiers are coming!
JESUS
Let's move. Move!
[South Park City Hall. Jimmy is still singing Twelve Days of Christmas.]
JIMMY
Eight... maids are... milking...
[A hallway. Jesus leads the others out.]
JESUS
[stops at the foot of a stairway and turns around] Get up the stairs! The sleigh is on the roof! [a soldier comes down the stairs]
KYLE
Jesus, behind you! [Jesus looks at the boys. The soldier shoots Jesus in the back]
STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
[in slow motion] Jesus! [in slow motion, Jesus wobbles a bit and then falls]
SANTA
[in slow motion] No! [fires away with his gun, killing the soldier. He then approaches Jesus and holds him] Jesus. Jesus! [Jesus stammers, but nothing comes out of his mouth] No... don't worry, Jesus, it's nothing. It's just a scratch.
JESUS
You're a... bad liar. [the boys are speechless] Hey. B-but we sure gave them one hell of a fight, huh?
SANTA
We sure did, Jesus.
STAN
[finding his voice] Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
JESUS
Uh Santa?
SANTA
[quickly answers] I'm here, Jesus.
JESUS
Don't... don't ever... let them take away... our... Christmas spirit. [Jesus takes his last breath and expires. His halo disappears]
STAN
Oh my God. Iraqis killed Jesus.
KYLE
You bastards. [behind them, soldiers mass at the other end of the hall]
SANTA
[with a gun on each arm] Come on, kids! [turns around and rushes up the stairs. The kids follow]
[The building's rooftop. Santa leads the boys out while firing at the pursuing Iraqi soldiers.]
SANTA
Get to the sleigh! Get to the sleigh! [the boys run by screaming as Santa mows the soldiers down with both semiautomatics. More soldiers pour out, more bodies pile up. The boys sit down in the sleigh, and Stan and Kyle take the reins]
MR. HANKEY
Start the sleigh!
STAN
Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh...
KYLE
On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel. [the sleigh begins to move forward and Santa runs out of ammo. He drops the guns and heads for the moving sleigh. He hops in and the remaining soldiers fire at the departing sleigh. The sleigh goes up and away]
CARTMAN
Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's sleigh. It's Christmas special time for me-
KYLE
Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody!
CARTMAN
Eh, it's not an act, Kyle! All I wanted was for these people to understand what Christmas means.
SANTA
You're right, kid. [turns the sleigh around]
MR. HANKEY
What are you doin', Santa?
SANTA
I came to bring Christmas to Iraq and by God I'm gonna do it! [presses a button on his dashboard.]
[Panels on either side of the sleigh body open up to reveal bombs and a controller rises up in front of Santa. He releases the reins and fires a rocket. It heads for a building and Iraqis move out of the way. It hits its target, but instead of destroying it, the bomb decorates the building in Christmas cheer. Strings of lights decorate the windows and a Christmas tree appears at the door. "Joy To The World" plays as snow comes down from the sky. The Iraqis approach in wonder.]
SANTA
Hohoho! Merry Christmas! [the sleigh sails above a street and Santa strafes the buildings on either side with more bombs. Each of the buildings is decorated with lights and Christmas trees, and presents appear under the trees. The sleigh goes down another street and bombs another building. It too is decorated]
SOLDIER
[directing another soldier with a bazooka ready to fire] Dakadaka!
STAN
RPG, four o'clock!
[Santa activates a laser, which rises over the boys and fires at the soldier's bazooka. It becomes a giant candy cane. The soldiers are surprised. Santa fires at a group of people holding baskets of bread and a woman holding a chicken. The baskets become gifts, while the chicken becomes a large gingerbread man. A rifle in one man's hands becomes a Christmas wreath.]
MR. HANKEY
Boy, things are starting to look Christmasy now!
SANTA
Merry Christmas! Hohoho!
[Santa makes another pass down a decorated street and drops five more bombs. They leave behind five snowmen. The Iraqis are surprised and confused by all these presents. The kids are terribly pleased with theirs.]
SANTA
Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night! Hohohohoho!
[South Park City Hall. Jimmy is still singing Twelve Days of Christmas. The mayor's assistants are asleep and the mayor is getting sleepy.]
JIMMY
And a p-p-par-tridge in a p-peeeaaar treeee. [a moment of silence follows. No more is heard from Jimmy]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
That's it? That's it! The song's over! We can light the tree! [heads for the dais. Her aides follow. The townsfolk rouse themselves.]
TOWNSFOLK
[cheering heartily] Hurrah! Woohoo! Yay!
JIMBO
Oh, finally!
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Go on, Jimmy! There's only five more seconds until Christmas! [hands him the detonator by which to light the tree. The townsfolk are glad with anticipation, making fists. Jimmy lowers the trigger, the tree lights up and goes dark, and then a bulb explodes]
TOWNSFOLK
Awwww!
RANDY
Christmas is ruined again! [they begin to disperse, but jingle bells stop them in their tracks]
SANTA
[heard over the jingle bells] Ho ho ho! [Santa flies over the gathering and drops a bomb on the tree. It blazes forth with bright lights]
TOWNSFOLK
WOW!!! [cheering and applause follow. The sleigh lands and the occupants disboard]
RANDY
Stan!
SHEILA
Kyle!
KYLE
[runs up to his parents] Mom! Dad! We rode on Santa's sleigh!
STAN
[runs up to his parents] We brought Christmas to Iraq!
SANTA
[approaches the dais] Everyone! Everyone, can I please have your attention? [Cartman approaches his mom; they hug each other] Christmas is a very special time of year, but... this year it almost didn't happen. There's a man named Jesus who gave his life to save me. And so I declare that every year on Christmas Day, we should remember Jesus for what he did, and thank him for it. From now on, Christmas will be a day for remembering a brave man named Jesus.
TOWNSFOLK
[cheering heartily] Hooray!
SANTA
Now, if you'll all excuse me, I've got a lot of work to do. [leaves the dais]
MR. HANKEY
I'll help you, Santa!
SANTA
[gets into his sleigh and looks over at the boys] Oh, and boys, you might want to check under the Christmas tree. [the boys are surprised, then happy. Stan leads them to the presents. Santa takes the sleigh off the ground and away] Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! [the boys reach their presents and check them over. For a moment they look like the Iraqi kids. Their looks change back to normal as they rip off the wrapping. They all get the same gift]
STAN
Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all Haibo dolls! [Cartman's joy vanishes]
CARTMAN
Oh, God-damnit!
KYLE
Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll!
CARTMAN
Yeah, but not if you guys have one, too! Now it's worthless and gay! God-damnit I'll never try to be nice again! [kicks the toy away. The camera zooms out enough for a fourth person to walk into the shot]
STAN
Well, all in all, I have to say this was a pretty special Christmas. [Kenny walks into the frame.]
KENNY
(Hey guys. What's goin' on?)
STAN
Oh, hey Kenny.
KYLE
Dude, where have you been?
KENNY
(Oh, I've just been hanging out.)
KYLE
Well come on! We gotta tell you what happened. I'm sure glad it's over with. [walks away with his Haibo doll. Stan follows with his Haibo doll, and Cartman follows with an angry look]
STAN
Yeah, but I feel like things are finally back to normal.
KENNY
(Yeah.)
End of Red Sleigh Down
