script:Sexual Healing

[Windermere Florida, Thanksgiving night, 2009, 2:15 am. There's fighting inside a mansion as a couple screams at each other]
MAN
Put it down, you bitch!
[Mansion, inside. The camera is focused on the dining room table and slowly pulls back. A golf club strikes a dirty dish and smashes it apart]
MAN
Put the golf club down, you crazy bitch! [it's Tiger Woods, cowering behind a chair]
WOMAN
[smashes some more dishes] You motherfucker! I never should have married you! [Elin, with a bad Swedish accent]
TIGER
You're overreacting, you stupid Swedish cow!
ELIN
Then why-a the fuck are you getting a text-a message from some-a low-life-a hooker on Thanksgiving?!
TIGER
God, shut up! [runs out of the dining room] Shut! Up! [enters his den and starts rummaging through a drawer] Where are my fucking pills?! [finds them, takes a bunch, and swallows them]
ELIN
Oh yeah! Take more vitamins, Tiger! That'll help!!
TIGER
Will you just listen to me?!
ELIN
Listen to this-a! [runs up to him and whacks him across the face as he turns to face her, leaving a bleeding gash across his right cheek]
TIGER
[winces] Aaaah! [looks at her] You fucking whore!
[Outside the front door. Tiger leaves the house and goes to his SUV, wiping himself clean. Elin follows him to the front door]
ELIN
Oh where the fuck do ya think-a you're going?!
TIGER
I'm getting the fuck away from you! [opens the drivers' side door and gets in the SUV. Elin approaches that door with the club. Tiger starts the engine, and Elin starts swinging at the left rear door]
ELIN
Open the door, you motherfucker! [Tiger peels away]
[A videogame store. Cartman and Kenny are playing a golf game featuring Tiger and Elin. The preceding scenes were from that game]
CARTMAN
[playing as Tiger] Ooo yeah, take that from me in the car, Kenny! [Stan and Kyle walk into the store and spot the other two boys]
STAN
What are you guys doing?
CARTMAN
Dude, check it out! It's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox. [onscreen, Elin is chasing the SUV and leaving cracks in the rear windows with each swing of the club]
TIGER
D'Aaaah! Fuck you, cunt!
CARTMAN
Stop breaking through the window, Kenny! Whoa, I'm gonna crash I'm gonna crash! [Cartman loses control of the SUV, which hits a fire hydrant, then a tree. Elin catches up to the SUV as Tiger opens the door and staggers out, a bit dazed. The radiator is letting out steam]
TIGER
Aw, look what you did, you crazy bitch!
ELIN
It serves you right, you cheating turd! [swings at him and misses]
CARTMAN
Oh dude, was that a combo move?
KENNY
(Yeah dude, I fucked you up.)
CARTMAN
Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie.
KYLE
Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool.
CARTMAN
Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time.
[Center for Disease Control and Prevention - the CDC - day. A table full of experts and doctors is assembled on the top floor]
CHAIRMAN
I've gathered you together here because you are the best minds our country has to offer. As you've all seen on the news, our country is facing a major crisis, and we need to find out what's causing it. [the men glance at each other] Why? Why are rich successful men suddenly going out and trying to have sex with lots of women?
EXPERT 1
[with mustache and black coat] Tiger Woods was only the most prevalent, but our data shows that the numbers are growing. David Letterman and before that, Bill Clinton. There's a pattern here, people.
EXPERT 2
[with mustache and midnight blue coat] Why would a man who's famous and makes tons of money use that and have sex with lots of different women? [glances at the woman to his left, then looks ahead again]
CHAIRMAN
[stands up] Aand these rich celebrities have perfectly good wives at home. Why would they even think of sex with others? Dammit! [pounds the table with his right fist, but manages only a soft blow] I want answers!
EXPERT 3
[balding, with lab coat] We believe that it may be an outbreak of sex addiction, sir.
CHAIRMAN
[sits down] Sex awhowho?
EXPERT 4
[glasses and lab coat] It's a new phenomena we don't completely understand yet, but it... seems to make people... different. Of course, we all know the normal healthy male thinks only of sex occasionally and has no desire for sex with multiple partners. [the other men murmur in agreement]
EXPERT 5
Definitely true.
CHAIRMAN
Yes, we all know that, go on.
EXPERT 4
But in the sex addict, their entire lives are consumed with thoughts of wanting more and more. The mere sight of an attractive woman could... can make them think about sex with her.
EXPERT 6
[with fat cheeks] But what about love? How could tons of fame and money make you forget about love? [looks at the woman to his right]
CHAIRMAN
What could be causing this outbreak of sexual addiction?
EXPERT 7
[black] It could be caused by something in the water supply. Uh, perhaps even by - global warming.
EXPERT 8
[Japanese ancestry] Or cooling.
EXPERT 9
Yes
EXPERT 7
If.so, then the disease could start to affect our children
CHAIRMAN
That does it! [pounds the table softly] I want health screening at all our nation's schools! We need to find out if any young people might be carrying this disease.
[South Park Elementary, day, 4th Grade classroom. A researcher stands before the class with a clipboard]
EXPERT 9
Good afternoon, students. We are going to be a doing a health screening today. It won't take long, it'll be relatively painless, but we need to see if any students are showing... symptoms. [to his left is a cart with two beakers, a tray, and a picture resting against the legs] I'n a moment, I'm going to show you a suggestive picture. [puts the tray on the middle shelf of the cart and picks up the picture] And then I'm going to ask you a question about that picture. Alright, ready? Here we go. [turns the picture around and a naked couple appears, caressing. The class gasps]
THE CLASS
Oh! Wow. Ohhh.
KENNY
[cheering] (Woo hoo!)
KYLE
Jesus, dude.
BUTTERS
Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy.
EXPERT 9
Please just study the picture the best you can, students. I'll then ask you the question which you'll answer on the paper provided.
BUTTERS
[pointing] I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they??
EXPERT 9
Okay, very good. [sets the picture down against the cart again] Now, what color... was the handkerchief in the nice lady's hand? Write down your answer, please: what color was the handkerchief... in the nice lady's hand?
BUTTERS
[to Clyde] Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that??
EXPERT 9
Very good, turn your answers over please. [the students turn their sheets over]
BUTTERS
Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button!
EXPERT 9
Alright, now, who answered that the handkerchief was... yellow? [most of the kids raise their hands] Very good, very good indeed. Now I'd like to see who answered "What handkerchief?" [Kenny is the first to raise his hand. Kyle is nervous and looks around, but then raises his left hand. Butters looks over at them and then raises his left hand] A-ha! You three boys, please come with me. [heads for the door as Kyle, Kenny, and Butters leave their seats]
KYLE
I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny?
KENNY
(Fuck no, I wasn't looking at a handkerchief!)
[a small unused office at school. The researcher takes the boys into the office, has them sit at a table, and sits opposite them]
EXPERT 9
I'm sorry boys, but I'm afraid you three have tested positive for sex addiction.
KYLE
What?!
BUTTERS
Oh no!
KENNY
[annoyed] (Who fuckin' cares?)
EXPERT 9
We're gonna have to send you home, I'm afraid.
KYLE
Wait, we're sex addicts? Uh-are you sure?
EXPERT 9
Our nice-lady-with-the-handkerchief test is extremely comprehensive and thorough. I'm sorry, but you're simply too dangerous to have around normal, well-adjusted students.
BUTTERS
It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?
KYLE
So what happens to us now?
EXPERT 9
[sighs and rises from his chair, walking off] A life of desperation and anguish, I'm afraid. Your addiction will start off slowly - magazines, Internet sites - but then, as you keep chasing your high your tastes will get more and more dangerous. Most likely you'll end up going the way of David Carradine and Michael Hutchence: autoerotic asphyxiation.
KENNY
(Autoerotic asphyxiation? What's that?)
EXPERT 9
I don't want to go into too much detail but... you choke yourself with a belt around your neck while masturbating dressed up like Batman or something, then you pass out from lack of air and apparently it makes your orgasm super awesome.
KENNY
(Really??)
BUTTERS
Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume.
[CDC Headquarters, day. The chairman and his board address the public]
CHAIRMAN
Ladies and gentlemen, for the past several days we've been screening our nation's schools for signs of sex addiction. The results of our tests are troubling to say the least. Dr. Tonton?
DR. TONTON
[expert 9, as it turns out. He heads to a chart] In fourth graders, five percent of male students were found to be sex addicts. By sixth grade the number goes up to thirty percent. At high schools, nearly ninety-one percent of male students answered, "What handkerchief?"
CHAIRMAN
We're facing a sex addiction epidemic in our country. Young people all over America are infected, and at extreme risk to themselves and to the people around them. [Kyle watches this on TV from his bed] They're leading lives of secret pain.
REPORTER 1
And so these infected boys will soon be secretly wishing they could be having sex all the time with lots of different people?
CHAIRMAN
It appears so.
REPORTER 1
The poor bastards!
REPORTER 2
But what about us normal healthy adults? Are we at risk of exposure?
CHAIRMAN
We don't believe so. In adult males, for whatever reason, sex addiction only seems to be problematic amongst rich successful celebrities. [Randy watches this on TV from bed. Sharon is beside him reading a book instead] However, we are still collecting data, and all-
RANDY
Why would wealth and success cause a man to go out and have sex with everyone he could?
CHAIRMAN
-answers which we all desire. [next scene is the McCormick living room] Whatever is causing this outbreak, we guarantee we will find it! [Mrs. McCormick comes out with a pizza]
MRS. MCCORMICK
Kenny, it's time for dinner! [goes upstairs to Kenny's room and looks inside] Kenny? [turns around and gasps. Kenny had hanged himself from his closet door with a belt while dressed in a Batman suit and masturbating to a magazine. His left hand is tucked inside the tights, around the genitals] AAAA!
[Kenny's funeral, day.]
PRIEST
Sunset and Evening Star, and one clear call for me, and may their be no moaning of the bar when I put out to sea.
KYLE
Oh God, it's true.
PRIEST
But such a tide as moving seems asleep, too full for sound and foam, when that which drew from out the boundless deep t-
BUTTERS
There! It was like that! It looked just like that! [stands on his chair and points to a bush, then walks over to it] Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right..
KYLE
[reaching him] Butters! Butters, stop it!
BUTTERS
[fights Kyle off] But this is what I keep seeing in my head!
KYLE
[pulls him away from the bush] Butters, we are sick! Don't you get it?! We're gonna end up just like Kenny!
BUTTERS
[fights Kyle off again] No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine.
KYLE
No! Butters, stop! [slaps him]
BUTTERS
Haah! Leave me alone! [reaches for the bush again]
KYLE
Stop it! Stop! [pulls him back and flings him to the ground. They fight for a few seconds, then break down and cry out] Oh God! Oh God, help us!
[EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11. Tiger is about to tee off.]
COMMENTATOR
Tiger... lines up his drive. He'll be hoping for a birdie here. Concentration is key.
ELIN
[runs into the scene from screen right with her own golf club] You motherfucker! I never should have married you! [starts hitting him with it]
TIGER
Aaagh! Goddamnit, stop it! [blocks her club with his, as in a sword fight, and now they trade blows]
ELIN
How many women did you fuck-a?! How many?!
STAN
Aw dude, I clocked you!
CARTMAN
I told you this game was sweet, dude.
STAN
Hang on, hang on, I'm switching to a 7-iron. [Elin gets a new club and her swings get faster]
CARTMAN
Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that?
STAN
Hit A and X together.
ANNOUNCER
Round 2. Fight!! [Tiger and Elin face off again and start swinging]
CARTMAN
Oh, you're going down, Elin!
STAN
I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup power-up.
ANNOUNCER
Pre-nup power-up. [a pre-nuptial agreement appears onscreen and then flies off. Elin swings and Tiger a few more times and he's on the grass on his back]
CARTMAN
Oh no! [Elin continues beating up Tiger] Pre-nup? Weak. When'd you get that power-up?
[Karne Institute for Sexual Addiction, day. "A New Tomorrow, Yesterday."]
THERAPIST
All right, sex addicts. What other destructive behaviors that we engaged in that led to our ultimate downfall? [on the dry-erase board are three examples: "Sex Shop Visits, Sex With Hookers, Going To Strip Clubs"] Anyone have another example? Let's see, how about... David!
DAVID LETTERMAN
Haha, Oh, ahh, having sex with employees.
THERAPIST
[writing on the board] "Sex with employees." Definitely a danger there. What else? Uh, Mr. Clinton.
BILL CLINTON
Putting cigars in girls' vaginas?
THERAPIST
Very good, Billy. [writing on the board] "cigars in vaginas." Not the best idea there.
CHARLIE SHEEN
Watching Internet porn all day every day?
THERAPIST
Spot on, Charlie Sheen! Excessive [writing on the board] "Internet porn." Now, the reason we are making this list is that we have new members today. I want you all to welcome Kyle and Bummers. The men all turn to look at the boys, who are seated in the last row.
KYLE
Hello?
THE MEN
Hey Kyle, hi Kyle.
THERAPIST
And would you care to share your stories with us, boys?
KYLE
Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet.
BILL CLINTON
Does your mom have big tits?
THERAPIST
Billy!
BILL CLINTON
[sheepishly] Sorry...
BUTTERS
Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush.
BEN ROETHLISBERGER
I heard that.
BUTTERS
I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries?
THERAPIST
Mr. Duchovny, please stop jerking off!
DAVID DUCHOVNY
[stops] Aw, gee whiz!
[CDC labs, day.]
EXPERT 4
To better understand the sex addiction outbreak, we've been running tests on chimpanzees. [an enclosure full of chimps is shown] You can see that this entire community of specimens are getting along normally, some pairing off, others on their own, but now see this chimp here. [a chimp is shown sitting peacefully scratching himself here and there] An average adult normal male blending in seamlessly with the others. Now watch. We're going to give it a lot of money. [presses a button and speaks into a mic] Go ahead. [two researchers walk into the enclosure and dump lots of dollar bills on the peaceful chimp and walk out. The chimp looks at the money and starts getting excited. He stands up and grins widely, then walks around with dollars bills in his hands. He walks up to a chimp with a baby chimp in her hands and bangs her from behind. She lets the baby go. The male chimp moves on to the next female and bangs her face to face, then he moves to the third female and bangs her from behind. ]
CHAIRMAN
My God...
EXPERT 4
Yes... [the chimp goes on to bang two other females and an angry chimp is heard in the background. She comes out in curlers, robe, and slippers, and wields a rolling pin. She approaches the male chimp and beats him up with the rolling pin, then walks away as he writhes on the ground. The other chimps hoot and holler, and one of them throws feces at him] The subject is now isolated and shunned.
CHAIRMAN
Incredible. And, and what's it doing now?
EXPERT 4
Making a public apology on its talk show. [and so it is]
[Karne Institute for Sexual Addiction, day.]
THERAPIST
Alrighty. Now, we all know the destructive behaviors that got us into this predicament, don't we? What is the main thing we've all learned to avoid? [Tiger raises his hand] Yes, Tiger?
TIGER WOODS
Avoid drugs? And alcohol?
THE OTHER MEN
Auugh!
THERAPIST
No, no, Tiger, you still aren't getting it. [Kyle has a memo pad and pen, Butters is trimming a small bonsai tree] In order to make sure we are no longer destroying our lives with any of these behaviors, we must avoid... anyone? Avoid getting... anyone?
MICHAEL DOUGLAS
Caught.
THERAPIST
Yes, Michael Douglas! Everyone!
THE MEN
Getting caught.
THERAPIST
Very good! You are all here in therapy [draws a big circle around the destructive behaviors and writes "CAUGHT" over them] because you got caught! So how do we avoid getting caught? Ben Rothlisberger?
BEN ROTHLISBERGER
Don't screw girls in the public bathrooms?
DAVID LETTERMAN
When they uh ask you for money, pay them.
THERAPIST
Good, yes!
KYLE
Whoa, hang on! We shouldn't be learning how not to get caught. We have to take responsibility for our actions. [Butters stops trimming the tree, the men all look at Kyle]
BILL CLINTON
[breaks the silence] What the fuck are you talkin' about?
KYLE
Well, ah I mean, we have to accept that we have a problem, and put the blame completely on ourselves. I mean, maybe this isn't really even a disease. [the therapist turns around and walks away from the group, then places a call]
THERAPIST
Yeah, it's me. We've got a turd in the punch bowl. I repeat, we have a turd in the punch bowl.
[The White House, Oval Office, day. The chairman of the CDC and a researcher are talking to President Obama]
CHAIRMAN
Mr. President, in every test the results were the same. The monkeys who were given cash always acted out their sexual addiction to dangerous levels. It appears that money has a direct effect on the virus's ability to develop.
OBAMA
So we must keep our nation's youth away from money and success.
CHAIRMAN
No good, Mr. President. Because we've learned that sex addicts will find ways to make money and become successful in order to feed their addiction.
OBAMA
You mean boys will start working towards being rich and successful just so they can one day have sex with lots of women??
CHAIRMAN
Yes. That's why we decided to look at the cash itself for clues! We tried to find something in the hundred dollar bill that could explain why this is happening now. Then we looked at the backside, and found this. [points to the picture of Independence Hall on the back of the bill] Independence Hall.
OBAMA
The birthplace of our country.
CHAIRMAN
We believe something is happening in Independence Hall that gives money its power over men.
OBAMA
Independence Hall... Independence Day... Aliens... Gentlemen, I might know what's causing the sex addiction outbreak. This is highly classified, but... in 1947 a flying saucer was discovered in Roswell, New Mexico. Two deceased alien bodies were recovered and hidden from public knowledge. They carried... a virus with them. A virus that only barely stopped from spreading all over the country.
CHAIRMAN
And you think that these aliens... could be back with a new virus? One originating from Independence Hall causing rich successful men to have sex with lots of women?!
OBAMA
[seriously] It's the only explanation that makes any sense. [glances at Michelle, who doesn't react, then looks at the chairman again]
[Tiger Woods' press conference. "I WAS UNFAITHFUL, HAD AFFAIRS, AND I CHEATED."]
TIGER
I want to say that I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behavior. I know that I have severely disappointed all of you. Some have speculated that my wife somehow hurt or attacked me on Thanksgiving Night. It angers me that people would fabricate a story like that. She has shown nothing but grace and poise-
ELIN
[off-stage] You motherfucker!
TIGER
Oh no!
ELIN
I should have never married [jumps out from behind the curtain and whacks him with a golf club] youuu! [continues whacking him]
TIGER
Agh! Stop it!
ELIN
A porn star?! You screwed a porn star?! [the camera pulls back to reveal the video game the boys were playing earlier]
CARTMAN
Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone??
STAN
Yeah, back in that water level. [looks over at the front door, then back at the game] Is Kyle still at sex-addiction therapy? That must be really intense.
[A military helicopter in the night sky. Kyle and Butters are with the other addicts]
KYLE
Okay so, what exactly are we doing now?
THERAPIST
[sighs heavily] We are on our way to help take of your diseases once and for all!
BUTTERS
Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore.
THERAPIST
Don't worry, as soon as it's dead everything will make sense.
KYLE
...As soon as what's dead? [the men groan]
THERAPIST
The infected alien that they just discovered is hiding out at Independence Hall!
[Independence Hall, night. Police, SWAT, and firefighters swarm the grounds and police barricades are put up. The front doors blow off their hinges and the SWAT team moves in.]
SWAT OFFICER 1
Entrance is clear, Mr. President. [Obama leads the chairman and other CDD officials into the front room of the building]
CHAIRMAN
Mr. President, you aren't safe here. Let us handle this.
SWAT OFFICER 2
Right side clear!
EXPERT 4
We must be careful. The alien could have cast some kind of spell of invisibility.
OBAMA
[softly] Which would mean that the alien is also a wizard.
EXPERT 10
Yes! It explains everything! A wizard alien would be able to cast a spell on our species, causing all the men to become sex addicts.
OBAMA
Enough! We need to find the wizard alien and break his spell.
SWAT OFFICER 2
[chuckles] Okay okay alright alright, hang, hang on guys. I mean, come on, this is getting a little ridiculous. Wizard aliens? We all know what's going on here, don't we? Whenever a story breaks about some rich famous guy going around and having sex with tons of girls, we all wanna act like we don't understand it, but we do. We're guys, you know? Our brains are wired to strive to be the alpha male and get all the women we can. [walks into an open area in the room] I mean, look where we are. Even, even Benjamin Franklin screwed everything that moved. Because he could. We don't have to condone what these rich, famous people do, but... we can at least admit that, given the same temptations and opportunities that somebody like Tiger Woods has, a lot of us guys might do somethin' similar. [Obama thinks this over...]
OBAMA
[speaks into a mic strapped to his wrist] We have a turd in the punch bowl.
SECRET SERVICE AGENT
Turd in the punch bowl. [the other SWAT members close in on him]
SWAT OFFICER 2
Hey, what are you doin- No. No, come on. [and take him away] Where are you takin' me?
[News 4 news break. A reporter and camera are outside Independence Hall]
NEWS 4 REPORTER
Ten city blocks have been shut down because an alien is believed to have taken refuge here in Independence Hall. By all accounts, the alien is also a wizard, who could very easily be the cause of the outbreak of sex addiction in our country. [everyone in the Hall is moving around cautiously, with flashlights on.]
SWAT OFFICER 3
[voice only] Mr. President, here they are. [all flashlights point towards the source of the voice. The SWAT officers make way for the therapist, Kyle, and Butters]
THERAPIST
This is the boy I told you about. And his friend, Bummers.
CHAIRMAN
Son, we were told that you think sex addiction can be controlled. That it just takes restraint. Is that true?
KYLE
I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything.
CHAIRMAN
A-mazing. Then the wizard alien spell might not have any power over him! He could draw the bastard out!
OBAMA
Quick, give that boy a gun! [a SWAT officer gives him a rifle]
KYLE
What?
SWAT OFFICER 3
You'd better take one too. [gives Butters a rifle]
OBAMA
Alright, everyone to the stairwell. The bastard's gotta be upstairs. [moves towards the stairs as well]
KYLE
What bastard?
OBAMA
[looks back at Kyle] The alien wizard hiding out here! Come on, we've got tuh- [a muffled voice is heard]
CHAIRMAN
[on the stairs] The hell was that?
SWAT OFFICER 4
I got a baaad feelin' about this. [behind Kyle and Butters, a door opens and the kidnapped SWAT officer stumbles out with his hands tied in front of him and holding a wand, wearing a huge green mascot head of an alien with ogre ears, a white beard, and a wizard's hat.]
DR. TONTON
Oh my God there it is!
CHAIRMAN
It's the alien wizard! It's gonna get you boys! Shoot it! [a strobe light flickers on and off, blinding the bound SWAT officer, who stumbles around trying to free himself]
OBAMA
Shoot it boys!
EXPERT 6
You have to shoot it! [Kyle fires a shot]
CHAIRMAN
Shoot it again, it's still alive! [Butters fires a shot]
SWAT OFFICER 5
You gotta reload! [the boys reload slowly]
EXPERT 4
Keep firing, boys! Shoot it in the heart! [Kyle fires a shot]
OBAMA
Keep shooting it!
EXPERT 11
Shoot him in his blabber mouth! [Kyle fires again, then Butters fires a shot, and the SWAT officer falls to the floor dead. The strobe light keeps flashing just in case]
CHAIRMAN
My God, they've done it!
[Outside Independence Hall. The sex addicts dance around and moan gleefully]
BILL CLINTON
Look! The sex addiction! It's leavin' my body!
DAVID LETTERMAN
I can feel it! I'm free!
ANOTHER ADDICT
We are healed!
[The White House, day. President Obama addresses the nation from the South Lawn. "Sexual Healing" plays in the background]
OBAMA
We watched... as sex addiction ran rampant through our country. It devastated families. But once again, our great country has risen up as one. The wizard alien... is dead. Sex addiction is no more. And if a rich celebrity is caught again trying to screw lots of women, we will know it isn't because men are just like that, it's because a wizard alien has cast his mighty spell. [the crowd on the lawn jumps up and cheers]
RANDY
[watching this on TV in the bedroom] Oh I'm so glad it's over, Sharon. Aren't you? [Sharon isn't paying any attention, preferring to read a book]
NEWS 4 REPORTER
We are now with the young boys who helped stop the alien. Boys, how does it feel to be free of your illness?
KYLE
[unsure] I guess it... feels great. Thanks. [Butters looks pissed off]
BUTTERS
Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again! [swats the reporter's hand away and walks towards the camera] I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips.
[Tiger Woods' press conference. "I AM RETURNING TO GOLF IN 3 WEEKS."]
TIGER
I am so happy that I am cured, and no longer have any desire to have sex with anyone but my beautiful wife. Now I can be faithful. And my wife won't feel any need to get revenge by sleeping with a bunch of guys. [she glances at him, he glances at her, she glances back at him] So I officially announce my return to golf.
[EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11. Tiger tees off and the audience claps approvingly. The ball reaches 350 yards. Nothing more exciting happens]
CARTMAN
What the hell?! This game's all boring now!
STAN
Yeah, where's all the fighting?
CARTMAN
Dude, screw this! [gets off the sofa and throws his controller to the floor, then walks away] Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?!
STAN
Yeah, golf is stupid again. [gets off the sofa and tosses his controller onto the sofa, then follows Cartman out]
End of Sexual Healing

synopsis:The boys are given a controversial book to read in school and it inspires them to write one of their own.

script:The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs

[South Park Elementary, day, Fourth Grade class. The bell rings and Mr. Garrison enters with a box of books.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay kids, let's take our seats. [sets the box down on the desk] There has been a change in school policy, and so I'm assigning you all a book to read.
CARTMAN
[sarcastically, folds his arms together] Aww, books? God, I hate those!
MR. GARRISON
Now, kids, this book is very controversial and has just been taken off the banned books list. [the book in question is J.D. Salinger's The Catcher In The Rye]
CARTMAN
Oh really? Sweet.
MR. GARRISON
It's called The Catcher In The Rye, and it has some very... risqué parts... [begins handing out the books individually]
STAN
All right!
MR. GARRISON
...and strong vulgar language...
KENNY
(Awesome, dude!)
MR. GARRISON
...and in fact, many schools across the country still ban this book because it's thought to be so inappropriate.
CARTMAN
Oho man, I can't wait!
MR. GARRISON
Tonight, I want you to read chapters one through five, and tomorrow we'll discuss the-
CARTMAN
No on, come on, let's read it now!
KYLE
Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book?
MR. GARRISON
Uh-yes, apparently John Lennon's killer said he was inspired by The Catcher In The Rye, but he was just a kook! [jabs his left index finger at the floor]
CARTMAN
Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies?! Can we please read this right now?!
MR. GARRISON
You will read it at home, [jabs his left index finger at the floor again, then puts his palms on his hips] and you will all be mature about its adult themes and language!
CLASS
Awww!
[Kyle's house, that afternoon. Kyle is reading at his desk, Stan is on the floor next to Kyle's bed reading. Kyle is almost finished with the book while Stan is halfway through it.]
STAN
Did you get to any dirty parts yet?
KYLE
No, it's still just some whiny, annoying teenager talking about how lame he is.
STAN
[turns the page] I don't get it dude. W-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said "shit" and "fuck" a few times.
KYLE
I know. I'm almost at the end and there's nothing. [the door opens and a pissed-off Cartman enters and closes the door]
CARTMAN
Motherfucker! [Kyle turns around to face him, Stan stands up and walks up to him] The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept thinking, "alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming," and then after like a hundred pages I was like "alright, I guess all the dirty stuff is at the end," and then I got to the last page, and I was all "the fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!"
KYLE
[picks up his book] Why the hell was this book banned?!
CARTMAN
They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! [the door opens again and Kenny enters with his book]
KENNY
(Dude, what the fuck is so filthy or offensive in here?)
CARTMAN
We know, we were just saying that.
STAN
Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous?
[Butters' house, same time. He's reading the book at the kitchen table with an odd look in his eyes. He sets the book down]
BUTTERS
Kill John Lennon... [leaves his chair and walks across the kitchen] Kill John Lennon... Kill John Lennon... [reaches into a bottom drawer and pulls out a large steak knife] Kill John Lennon! [walks by his dad's study and stops to look in] Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?
STEPHEN
John Lennon's dead, Butters.
BUTTERS
[lowers the knife instantly] Aww. Dangit. [drops it and walks away]
KYLE
Dude, some people really do consider this obscene.
CARTMAN
It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene!
STAN
Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book. [Kyle breaks into a grin]
CARTMAN
Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one.
KYLE
Yeah, sweet!
KENNY
(Awesome.)
KYLE
[starts typing] The Tale of... [can't think of anything, so his smile disappears]
CARTMAN
The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass.
KENNY
(No, No, Scrotie McBoogerballs)
KYLE
Oh that's, [giggles] yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one...
CARTMAN
It was a... a warm spring morning. [background music plays and a montage follows. Next is the school playground where, as other kids play, Stan and the other three sit on the steps of a side entrance and continue working on their book, with Cartman taking notes Next is Stan's room where Stan is typing the next part of the book. The boys are having fun with the writing. The next scene is in Cartman's room where Cartman is again writing the story down. Kyle has brought Ike over for company. Finally, a few days later, Sharon enters Stan's room to put away his clean clothes. She puts away some underwear but notices something in the drawer. Under Stan's shirts is the manuscript to the story the boys have been working on. Sharon reaches for it.]
[Stan's room, day. Sharon grabs the manuscript and begins reading it]
SHARON
"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs"? [goes to the first page] "It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find his"... [reads silently] Ew. "He took a..." [stunned] What? Oh. OH! Oh my God! "He then grabbed his dog's" [stifles a gag but can't hold it in, and barfs] Ehohoh, oh my God! "Walking out of his house he spotted the bloodiest pus-covered" [tries not to barf again, but can't hold it in] Nooo! Nooo! [reads some more, but then coughs, then barfs] Noho! Nooo! [Sharon then falls unconscious and rolls on her back]
[The Marsh kitchen, downstairs. Sharon races down with the manuscript...]
SHARON
Randy? [spots him working on a small wooden ship and runs in] Randy! Randy, you need to read this!
RANDY
Read what?
SHARON
This book! Our son and his friends wrote it!
RANDY
So?
SHARON
Soo? Randy, it's, it's, it's really good!
RANDY
Huh?
SHARON
I mean it's disgusting. [hands the manuscript over to him] It's, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever read, but, the plot is amazing. And the characters are so... vivid!
RANDY
"It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find hi-" Ew, Sharon, gross!
SHARON
Nono, just keep reading.
RANDY
"He took a- and then-" Oh, man. Oh, this- [turns to his left and barfs on the floor. Sharon turns away and shields herself]
SHARON
I know. I know, Randy, but trust me. You've gotta push through to the end.
RANDY
Noo, noo, that's just WRONG!
SHARON
Randy please! You've got to listen to me!
RANDY
"Walking out of the house he found a bloody pu-" What? "He immediately stuck up his im...fected ba-" [barfs again. He spends a couple hours more reading, and finally reaches the last few pages. There's a pail in front of him now, but the vomit has gone all over the place. He has a small towel in his left hand covered in vomit. His voice is now soft and beat] "That was all long ago in some brief lost spring, in a place that is no more. In that hour the vaj frogs begin and the scent off Scrotie's infected anus becomes its strongest." Oh... Oh, man.
SHARON
Well?
RANDY
It's... it's awesome. Sharon it's the best book I've ever read.
SHARON
Right? It's not just me.
RANDY
No, it's... I mean, the whole part about Amsterdam, wow!
SHARON
What do we do, Randy? We can't support our son talking like this, but I, I mean.
RANDY
NO! I kn... I know! People need to read this book, Sharon, this is... this is Pulitzer prize stuff.
[Cartman's house, day, living room. Kenny, Cartman and Kyle are playing a video game]
CARTMAN
Hehehhh, you're dead, Kenny!
STAN
[runs into the living room in a panic] Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer! My parents must have found it!
CARTMAN
...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all.
STAN
Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me!
KYLE
Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down!
CARTMAN
And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!
STAN
Well dude, somebody has got to go down!
[Butters' house, day. He's in the living room watching TV. Cartman walks in with the other three boys]
CARTMAN
Butters, what are you up to?
BUTTERS
Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians.
KIM
Today my sisters and I are gonna have to wash something. It's gonna blow!
BUTTERS
Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding.
STAN
Butters, listen: you are in big trouble!
BUTTERS
I am?
CARTMAN
Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it.
BUTTERS
Oh no. Which book was that?
CARTMAN
Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!
BUTTERS
I don't even remember that. [gasps] But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read The Catcher In The Rye I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep!
[Kyle's house, day. The boys and their parents are in the living room]
SHARON
Alright boys, we need to get to the bottom of this.
SHEILA
We've all read the book now and it is very shocking to say the least.
STAN
Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters. [Butters walks in hanging his head]
CARTMAN
That's right.
RANDY
Butters? Is that true?
BUTTERS
Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did.
GERALD
Well Butters, we think... that this is one of the BEST books we've ever read.
BUTTERS
Huh?
KYLE
What? [the other boys can't believe it]
GERALD
Yeah, it's really amazing.
BUTTERS
[brightens up] Oh, thanks.
SHEILA
We were actually so moved by your book, Butters, that we brought Mr. Needlebaum from Penguin Publishing to read it.
MR. NEEDLEBAUM
Mr. Butters, we would like to offer you a deal for first publishing rights to your brilliant novel.
STAN
Hey, wait a minute, that's ours!
KYLE
Yeah, we wrote that!
RANDY
Ohkay boys, you already told the truth.
KYLE
No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters.
BUTTERS
I wrote that. [the adults begin to murmur amongst themselves]
STEPHEN
Really amazing.
STAN
What? Hey! [Butters is pleased for once]
[A news report]
NEWS ANCHOR
It is being called the most disgusting, foul, sickening book ever written, and it is also being called "literary genius." The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs hit the shelves this weekend, and so far no one has been able to get through the first paragraph without vomiting.
[Frontier Books. Everyone who's buying or reading the book is vomiting after reading a few seconds of it, then back to the news report]
NEWS ANCHOR
The book has already sold millions of copies worldwide aaand has been translated into twenty six languages.
[a reading in Chinese. The book cover is shown in Chinese. Even just hearing it, the Chinese audience vomits after Scrotie McBoogerballs' name. The reader continues for a few more seconds, but has to stop to vomit into the pail next to him. The audience vomits some more, and the reader continues, After reading Jessica Parker's name, he gets off his stool and vomits into the pail some more. The audience vomits some more. Then back to the news report]
NEWS ANCHOR
The book is changing the literary world. And it is all thanks... to Leopold "Butters" Stotch. [a picture of Butters in a pensive pose pops up]
[South Park Elementary, day. The students mill around. Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, and Mr. Adler supervise the hallway]
CLYDE
Hey, here he comes!
MR. ADLER
Amazing book, Butters. [Mr. Garrison comes out of his classroom]
BUTTERS
Thank you! [clasps his hands together and congratulates himself as he walks down the hallway]
MRS. STREIBEL
You've changed my life, young man.
BUTTERS
That's nice. [waves to everyone and walks on, but runs into Stan and the boys, who are mad at him]
CARTMAN
Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
BUTTERS
Just enjoying myself. Why, Eric?
KYLE
Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!
BUTTERS
But, you told me I did!
STAN
Yeah, but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble, asshole! [two girls rush up to Butters' aid]
RED
Hey hey, you guys leave Butters alone! He's a very fragile artist.
LOLA
He's so brooding and full of angst.
BUTTERS
Yeah, I'm broooding.
CARTMAN
Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit!
REBECCA
Oh God, you guys are pathetic!
LOLA
Yeah, get a life and stop mooching off others' success for once. [the girls leave]
STAN
God-damnit!
KYLE
Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the-
BUTTERS
No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading The Catcher in the Rye, I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener!
CARTMAN
That inconsiderate jerk!
[The HBC logo pops up - a spoof of the NBC Peacock. What follows is an HBC News presentation]
ANNOUNCER
Today on Today: We meet the author of the book that has swept the nation, and has now spawned TV's most popular game show, "How Long Can You Listen To Scrotie McBoogerballs On Audiobook" [the studio audience joins in] "And Not Vomit?" [a contestant is fitted with headphones and place in a soundproof booth. The front panel is a glass door so the audience can see the contestant's reaction without getting sprayed with vomit. It only takes two seconds of listening before the contestant vomits all over the door] The book is full of disgusting words and acts, including Sarah Jessica Parker, who is mentioned four hundred and sixty-five times. [a shot of Parker and her date at the Oscars] Matthew Broderick, are you upset your wife is made fun of so much in the book?
BRODERICK
Well, obviously. I just think it's wrong to make fun of anybody's physical appearance. My wife is a beautiful woman and I know that most people agree with me.
ANNOUNCER
Uh huh, and Matthew, how come a transvestite donkey witch is standing next to you, and why is it wearing a dress? [cut to a shot of the Stotch family sitting in Butters' room]
MATT LAUER
Joining us now is the author of the book, Leopold Stotch, along with his parents.
STEPHEN
Hello Matt
LINDA
Hi everyone.
MATT LAUER
You must be pretty proud of your son.
STEPHEN
Oh, we certainly are. We're thrilled to learn he's so very talented.
MEREDITH VIEIRA
And we also learned that your son is grounded. Is that correct?
STEPHEN
Yes, we did have to ground him for the language in the novel of course.
BUTTERS
I have to come right to my room after school.
STEPHEN
But we are very very proud nonetheless.
AL ROKER
[chuckles] Young man, now that you are a respected author, have you met any famous people?
BUTTERS
Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly.
MATT LAUER
All right, uh, yeah huh. Butters, my favorite part of your novel was when Scrotie McBoogerballs slid his head up into the horse's [jumps off his stool and tries to vomit into a pail nearby, but misses. He vomits agin and this time gets it into the pail, burps, and coughs a few times, getting the last of the vomit into the pail, and finally spits. He gets back on the stool] Sorry, I uh, was that chapter a slam on health care reform as people suggested?
BUTTERS
Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so.
MEREDITH VIEIRA
Is that why the doctor character pulls out all the strings? [begins to vomit immediately]
AL ROKER
Little boy, are you ever worried somebody might take your book wrong and try to kill someone, like when that guy tried to shoot Ronald Reagan after reading The Catcher in the Rye?
BUTTERS
Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh. [gets into a trance] Kill Ronald Reagan. [hops off his bed and heads for the door] Kill Ronald Reagan.
AL ROKER
Ronald Reagan is dead now, Butters.
BUTTERS
Oh really? [goes back to his bed] Oh yeah, gosh dangit.
[Assembly Hall, day. Kenny, Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Sarah Jessica Parker are giving their speeches to the school board.]
STAN
More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity!
ASSEMBLYMAN 1
That's just because you're too young to understand the underlying themes.
CARTMAN
There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact!
ASSEMBLYMAN 2
You just fail to understand what the author meant.
KYLE
The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny!
ASSEMBLYMAN 3
[chuckles] No, no no, that's such a simplistic view.
STAN
Goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book! Read it again!
ASSEMBLYWOMAN 1
Oh, so you're suggesting that the author just arbitrarily made fun of Sarah Jessica Parker for no reason?
KYLE
Yes!
ASSEMBLYWOMAN 1
But what would be the point?
CARTMAN
There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly!
ASSEMBLYWOMAN 2
No writer would take the time to make fun of Sarah Jessica Parker just because they think she's ugly.
STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
Yes they would!
ASSEMBLYWOMAN 2
It is because Miss Jessica Parker is a metaphor in the book for oppression felt by the lower class.
STAN
What? Dude, that is not in the book at all!
ASSEMBLYMAN 2
Boys, this book is an important look at how liberals are hurting this country.
STAN
What?
ASSEMBLYWOMAN 2
Wait, Scrotie McBoogerballs is the most conservative-hating liberal in literature!
ASSEMBLYMAN 2
What book did you read?!
STAN
There's nothing about liberals or conservatives!
ASSEMBLYMAN 4
Ohohh yeah, then why did Sarah Jessica Parker's butt-cheese end up in Scrotie's milkshake? [an assemblyman nearby throws up]
[Butters' house, day. A Channel 9 reporter stands across the street from it as a small crowd gathers around the front door and look up at Butters' window]
FIELD REPORTER
Breaking news from acclaimed author Leopold Stotch. The artist has announced that he is working on a second novel as a followup to his wildly successful bestseller. We got a statement from the writer, who is still grounded in his room. [The reporter and Butters are yelling at each other to be heard.]
FIELD REPORTER
Can you give the public any idea what the new book is about?
BUTTERS
Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind!
FIELD REPORTER
Will it be as sick and disgusting as your first book?
BUTTERS
Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver!
STEPHEN
Butters, away from the window! You are being grounded!
BUTTERS
Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation. [walks out of view]
[Outside Assembly Hall, the boys sit on the curb. Sarah Jessica Parker stands next to a tree with a bare branch on which a bird sits]
STAN
I can't believe they won't ban our book!
KYLE
I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye!
KENNY
(It's fucking disgusting!)
CARTMAN
All right you guys, I know what we have to do. [stands up and walks onto the street] We've got to kill Sarah Jessica Parker.
KYLE
What?! [Stan's hands go from his chin to his knees]
CARTMAN
Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned.
KYLE
Dude, we're not killing Sarah Jessica Parker! [Sarah Jessica Parker hears her name and looks at the boys]
CARTMAN
Shhh. [addresses Ms. Parker] Be right with you. [hushed tones to the other boys] We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed.
STAN
Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one. [he and Kyle walk away]
CARTMAN
Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.
KENNY
[looks over at Ms. Parker, then at Cartman] (Okay.)
CARTMAN
[turns and walks over to Ms. Parker] Ms. Jessica Parker, over here. [Kenny follows.]
[The Today Show, an HBC News production]
MATT
Well, the day has finally arrived. The eagerly awaited second novel from the author of Scrotie McBoogerballs hit the shelves this morning and apparently, bookstores are jammed.
MEREDITH
Al, how is it out there?
AL
[giggles] I don't know if you could see this, guys, but uh, the line stretches all the way around the block. People waiting for their turn to get inside the bookstore and read the novel. [the camera pans across the line from front to back and back again. The people in line smile and wave at the camera] And they brought trash bags and buckets to throw up in. Just a festive atmosphere here, Matt and Meredith.
MEREDITH
Well, we've got our vomit buckets ready too, because coming up, a very special in-studio treat.
MATT
That's right, we are going to have a reading of the first five chapters of the book here live in our studio. Na-now we must warn you that this is from the same author who wrote the most graphic, obscene novel of all time, so... brace yourselves for some very harsh language. Take it away Morgan Freeman.
[a shot of Morgan Freeman sitting in a study, a fireplace to his left, a library to his right, preparing to read from Butters' second book]
MORGAN FREEMAN
[reading slowly, with gravitas] The Poop That Took A Pee Chapter 1: Douglas had to poop. His butt was all stinky because he had to poop so badly. There was a gross woman named Rebecca who was sunbathing all naked, and she was fat. Douglas walked up to her and said, "I need to poop." "Okay," Rebecca replied, "I like poop." Douglas squatted down [turns the page] over the fat sunbathing lady and went poop. The poop sat there on Rebecca's boobs looking like a wiener. [turns the page] Chapter 2...
[The woods, day. A sign by the side of a road indicates that moose hunting season is here and the woods are open. Cartman and Kenny are standing in the bush. Kenny makes a moose call with his hands and mouth. They wait for a response. Kenny makes the call again]
CARTMAN
See any hunters yet?
KENNY
(Not yet) [Ms. Parker is in a nearby clearing with moose horns attached to her head]
CARTMAN
Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there.
KYLE
Guys, stop, stop! [Kyle and Stan walk into view towards Cartman and Kenny] We don't have to do this!
KENNY
(Huh?)
KYLE
Butters wrote a second book!
CARTMAN
So what?
STAN
So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!
KYLE
We can get people to believe us now!
CARTMAN
Oh dude, sweet! [all four boys walk away, leaving Ms. Parker all alone at the mercy of any moose hunter that walks by her]
[Cut to the in-studio reading of Butters' second novel]
MORGAN FREEMAN
"Why are we here?" Douglas cried as poop came out his wiener, in a long, thin strip. It was... wiener poop, which is the grossest poop of all.
[Frontier Books, morning. The shoppers pick up where Morgan left off]
SHOPPER 1
"The pee he got on the woman's leg, and she screamed, pooping out her boobs."
SHOPPER 2
"And so when the pee got mixed with the poop, it smelled like a butt."
STAN
[in store with the other boys] Aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought. [grins]
CARTMAN
People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter!
SHOPPER 3
Are you reading this, Marsha? What do you think?
MARSHA
So far I think it's, it's incredible! Ih, it might be better than his first book.
SHOPPER 4
I agree. It wasn't as edgy, but it's like, he he's gone back to his roots.
CARTMAN
What?!
STAN
You can't be serious! You people like this?!
SHOPPER 5
Some of the imagery is unbelievable
KYLE
A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery!
SHOPPER 6
Says you! You must be a pro-life nut, huh? [slides into taunting] Didn't like what the book had to say?
MARSHA
What are you talking about? This book is as pro-life as it gets!
CARTMAN
Oh come on!
STAN
God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!!
SHOPPER 7
"And the poop and the pee lived happily every after. The end." [closes the book...] Kill the phonies. Kill the phonies!
[Keeping Up With The Kardashians is on the air]
KIM
Today my sisters and I are gonna shop for underwear.
THE KARDASHIANS
Yaaay!
BRUCE JENNER
Can I go with you girls? [the seventh shopper breaks into the set and guns everyone down]
[News report about the massacre]
NEWS ANCHOR 2
Our nation is still reeling from the tragic deaths of the Kardashians. The shooter claims he was driven to commit the slaughter immediately after reading The Poop That Took A Pee by Leopold "Butters" Stotch. It's all over. The Kardiashians.. [cries a bit and sheds a tear] wiped out. In the blink of an eye. All because one little PRICK... had to go and write a book.
[Butters' room, day. Butters is at his desk with his face buried in his arms. The news report is airing on the TV in the background]
NEWS ANCHOR 2
Leopold Stotch... I HOPE THEY BURY YOU! ...YOU EVIL FUCK! [the anchorman falls silent and the door opens. Cartman and the other boys enter]
CARTMAN
Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters.
BUTTERS
I know.
STAN
They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!
BUTTERS
[lifts his head up. He's been crying. The Boys' smiles disappear] You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And now she's gone and it's because of me! [The Boys quickly showed sympathy for what they did]
KYLE
Ah... Oh Butters, [steps forward] it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning.
STAN
Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television.
BUTTERS
Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get through this.
CARTMAN
That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.
BUTTERS
What?
CARTMAN
[sighs heavily] You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter.
BUTTERS
What?! Oh no!
CARTMAN
Yep, sorry. You're gonna have to come down and admit it was you. [walks out of the room with the other boys]
BUTTERS
Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly. [leaves his desk and follows the other boys downstairs]
End of The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Cartman's favorite restaurant has been shut down and replaced by a store that sells medical marijuana. Randy is so desperate to get a prescription card to buy pot and Cartman will do anything to get his beloved fried chicken back.

script:Medicinal Fried Chicken

[A soccer field, day. The four boys are at soccer practice with Tolkien and other boys from around the neighborhood. They're exercising, touching their bellies, then their feet, then raising their hands in the air.]
GROUP
Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty.
CARTMAN
[after "27"] Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I've got such a belly ache.
COACH
You seem to have a stomach ache every time we do drills and exercises.
CARTMAN
[faking] I know, it sucks. [the coach blows his whistle as the boys reach "40"]
COACH
Alright kids, practice is over for today.
CARTMAN
[grins and throws his sports bottle away] KFC!! [races for his ride]
[Randy's car, after practice. Randy drives the boys across town]
CARTMAN
Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!
KYLE
Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!
CARTMAN
Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you! [remembers where he is] Uhm sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole, Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are!
[Randy pulls up to a KFC and parks the station wagon. Everyone gets out]
STAN
Hey, it looks different.
[sure enough, the KFC logo and lettering are gone, but the building still has that KFC style of architecture. The windows advertise medicinal marijuana though. A customer comes out with a bag of weed.]
RANDY
[to the customer] Hey, uh, what's up with the KFC?
CUSTOMER
[stops] Oh, it's not a KFC anymore. It's a medicinal marijuana dispensary. [walks away]
STAN
A what?
CARTMAN
Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?!
KYLE
So where's the KFC now?
RANDY
Alright, boys, wait out here. Let me see what's going on. [leaves them and enters the store.]
[Inside the medicinal marijuana dispensary. Randy walks toward the counter, looking around at the place]
CLERK
Can I help you, sir?
RANDY
Yeah, we were actually looking to get some KFC?
CLERK
Oh, yeah, sorry, that's gone. We only sell marijuana here.
RANDY
Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?
CLERK
Sure. New state laws say it's okay.
RANDY
[thinks about what this means] Woohoo, all right! I love the future! Let's see, uh, I'll take half a pound of that uhhh Jamaican Passion [goes to another counter] and give me some of that purplish stuff too!
CLERK
Alright. I'll just need to see your physician's reference.
RANDY
[his smile vanishes] My huh?
CLERK
Well, sir, we just can't sell the marijuana to anybody. You need a reference from your doctor to show it's necessary.
RANDY
Ohhh, that's dumb. Okay. Okay, I'll be I'll be right back! [races out the door]
[outside the shop. Randy runs past the boys]
STAN
What'd they say?
RANDY
[speaking quickly] KFC's gone, been replaced.
CARTMAN
They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park!
RANDY
Yeah, well, I gotta get to the doctor. [runs to the car, opens the driver-side door, and quickly gets in]
STAN
The doctor? But, Dad, we wanna eat.
RANDY
I gotta get to the doctor! [pulls out of his parking slot and drives away in a hurry, leaving the boys by themselves]
KYLE
...So no KFC?
CARTMAN
This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP!
[A doctor's office. Randy is on the bed there and the doctor walks to him with some test results]
DR. DOCTOR
Well, Mr. Marsh, it looks like you are in prefect health. Your bloodwork came back great and all your vitals appear normal.
RANDY
All right!
DR. DOCTOR
Yep, you check out fine.
RANDY
That's great. So can I get a referral from you?
DR. DOCTOR
For what?
RANDY
Medicinal marijuana. [the doctor frowns] There's a shop that opened in the old KFC, and they said I needed a doctor's referral to buy weed.
DR. DOCTOR
Mr. Marsh, you don't qualify for medicinal marijuana.
RANDY
But you said I'm totally healthy!
DR. DOCTOR
Medicinal marijuana is for people who aren't healthy. AIDS patients, cancer patients. You know, people going through chemo. The THC helps them eat and take the pain. You are in fine shape!
RANDY
...Well that sucks! [gets off the bed and puts his clothes back on.] Well so doctor, how do most people get cancer?
DR. DOCTOR
Well there's a lot of ways you can get cancer.
RANDY
Yeah, but what's the quickest way?
DR. DOCTOR
The what?
RANDY
Well like, what forms of cancer induce in time for the Ziggy Marley concert next Saturday in Denver?
[On Highway 291, night. Liane and Eric are driving northwest into the San Isabel National Forest west of Pueblo. Cartman is showing his frustration by punching the car door]
CARTMAN
Mom, drive faster!
LIANE
The KFC in Salida is a long way away, sweetie. Be patient.
CARTMAN
Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG!
LIANE
Eric, we're almost to Frisco. Why don't we go to the Church's Fried Chicken there?
CARTMAN
WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit!
LIANE
Alright honey, let's take it easy.
CARTMAN
Fuck you!
[Frisco, day. Liane and Eric arrive at the KFC in Frisco, which is being closed up. "CLOSED INDEFINITELY" says the banner over the Colonel's face as workers take down the K and the C]
CARTMAN
No! No, what's going on?! [quickly gets out of the car and shoves a worker aside] Move aside! [stops at the front door and looks up again]
WORKER 1
It's closed, kid, there's nothin' in there.
CARTMAN
No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too!
WORKER 1
Yeah, well, that's because of the vote last November to ban fast food in low-income areas.
CARTMAN
You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!
WORKER 2
No you don't get it, kid. KFCs were only in low-income areas. In the entire state of Colorado, Kentucky Fried Chicken is illegal.
CARTMAN
Nooooooooo-! [his head explodes]
[The Marsh house, day. Randy is on a chaise lounge in his backyard trying to give himself cancer with three possible carcinogens - cigarettes, an X-ray machine and reflective panels, and three cell phones strapped to his forehead. He's smoking.]
STAN
[opens the sliding door and looks out] Dad, Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer.
RANDY
Just gonna get a little bit of cancer, Stan. Tell Mom it's okay. [Stan walks away and closes the sliding door]
[A methadone clinic, day. Cartman walks in and approaches the counter]
NURSE FRAN
Can I help you?
CARTMAN
[looking fatigued and feeling quite itchy] I need... Somebody said you... could help me. I... have to... I haven't... had... KFC... in over... a week. [sniffs heavily]
NURSE FRAN
Alright, sign your name on the release form and put down the time-
CARTMAN
[hops onto a little stool in front of the counter] Really?
NURSE FRAN
-your birth year. and we'll get you through the next twenty-four hours. [hands him an application]
CARTMAN
Whoa, what uh, are you serious? [fills out the application as she gets a treatment out of a cabinet. He turns around...] Oh my God, that's KFC gravy! [quite giddy] You have KFC! Yes! [she opens the gravy and pours some into a small cup, then slides the cup to him. He's disappointed] This is it? One lousy little cup of gravy?!
NURSE FRAN
This is a clinic to help you get over your addiction.
CARTMAN
Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!
NURSE FRAN
[takes the cup back] If you don't want it, that's fine-
CARTMAN
[grabs it from her hand] NO! [swallows it as fast as he can] Oh God, oh God it's so good.
[The Marsh house, kitchen, day. Randy opens a box of instant chicken nuggets and pours the nuggets onto a plate.]
RANDY
[reading from the book "Cancer Today"] "Frozen and processed foods appear to have a direct link to many forms of stomach and colon cancers." Alright. [takes the plate and puts the nuggets into the microwave oven, sets the time to four minutes, then starts the oven] "Tests show that preservatives found in these foods are the leading cause. However, luckily most of these cancers are..." [he loses hope] "slow-growing and can take years to develop." Dammit. [turns the page] "Testicular cancer. Most common in older men and can be extremely aggressive." Oh this is good. "There's no data on what causes testicular cancer to grow so rapidly, however the primary causes of testicular cancer are linked to exposure to high doses of radiation" Hmmm. [closes the book and looks at the microwave and at his balls a few times. Some time later, Stan goes to the kitchen, opens the door, and grabs a sports energy drink, closes the door and walks away. He walks by Randy, who's got the microwave door open and his balls inside the oven.] Oh hey, Stan, could you grab me a beer? [Stan just looks at him and continues on his way.] Stan?
[The Marsh house, dawn. A rooster crows. Randy is still asleep in his bed, but something is beginning to bother him. He turns from his side to his back and then looks at his feet. What he sees amazes him. He pulls down the covers and sees that his balls have grown to the size of large pumpkins]
RANDY
Whoahhh! Sharon. Hey, hey Sharon!
SHARON
Wha... WHAAAAA?! [she almost lost her mind there]
[Dr. Doctor's office, day. Randy is now in a hospital bed and Sharon sits next to it.]
DR. DOCTOR
Mr. Marsh, I'm afraid that the tests came back positive. You do have testicular cancer.
RANDY
SCORE! [Sharon is not happy]
DR. DOCTOR
Now, the good new is it hasn't spread anywhere. We should... probably schedule to have them re-
RANDY
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?!
DR. DOCTOR
Your prescription for what?
[South Park, day. Randy is carting his massive balls around in a wheelbarrow, singing happily]
RANDY
Buffalo Soldier... in the heart of America. Stolen from Africa, brought into America. He was fighting on arrival...
[The medicinal marijuana dispensary, day. Randy enters with his wheelbarrow]
RANDY
One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush!
[At a lamp post in downtown. Officer Barbrady has stopped a speeding motorist and looks over at Randy, who's smoking some weed in plain view.]
RANDY
Uh that is nice! That is nice!
JIMBO
[walks by, sees him, and runs over] Randy! Jesus, Randy. Your balls!
RANDY
I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh?
JIMBO
No, I mean, your actual balls!
RANDY
Oh, yeah. Testicular cancer. Here, here, you want some? Oh wait, you're healthy! Hey bust his ass, officer! [laughs]
[Elsewhere in South Park. Cartman walks down the street sighing heavily]
TOUGH BOY 1
Hey kid, they say you're looking for some KFC.
CARTMAN
Yeah. Who isn't?
TOUGH BOY 1
Yeah well uh, we got some. Over at Billy Miller's house.
CARTMAN
Billy Miller? Seriously??
[Billy Miller's house, basement. The boy follows Cartman down the stairs.]
BILLY
Ahhh Eric Cartman, right?
CARTMAN
Tommy said you have some KFC.
BILLY
Suuure. [snaps his fingers and waves someone forward] Jessie. [a girl brings a tray with food over to Cartman]
CARTMAN
Oh my God, the Colonel's popcorn chicken and honey-mustard sauce! [eats them as fast as he can] Oh God yes! [finishes it off] Where did you get that?!
BILLY
I have my sources. That'll be $85.
CARTMAN
85 bucks?? I don't have that! [three boys behind him get serious and approach him. One of them has a bat]
BILLY
Hold on, hold on. [the boys stop] You're a big boy, Eric. Maybe you can pay me back another way. Do a little job for me. I've got some serious KFC coming in from a dealer. I need somebody willing to get a little risky and... pick it up.
CARTMAN
How much KFC are we talking?
BILLY
Two buckets plus a three-piece meal and four sides.
CARTMAN
Holy fuck, dude.
BILLY
I've got the money to pay for it, but it's become a risky business out there. You get the chicken for me, and I'll make sure you're hooked up for life. Do you wanna do it?
CARTMAN
Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime?
BILLY
Excellent.
[Medicinal marijuana dispensary, day. Randy exits the dispensary with his balls in the wheelbarrow]
RANDY
[smokes, coughs a little] Alright, see you tomorrow! [turns left and has difficulty maneuvering his massive balls. He walks down the sidewalk happily and checks his watch] Oh God, I gotta hurry! Caprica starts in five minutes! [starts moving faster, but the wheelbarrow soon falls apart and he's left sitting on his balls.] Huh-oh Jesus! [looks around, unsure of what to do] Ugh, ohh. [tries to get his feet on the ground, but can't] Uhh, hey, can somebody..? [puffs on the joint, then pulls at his scrotum] ...Rrrr. Ugh, I gotta get home. [gets off his balls and starts pulling them down the street. He sits on them again and bounces on them] Hey, hey, hey, this can work. This could... Hey, it's like a hoppity hop. Aaahah. Whoa-ho. [bounces down the sidewalk]
[South Park, day. People stop and stare as Randy bounces down the street on his balls. He's laughing all the while.]
[Elsewhere in South Park, Cartman walks into an alley and looks around. Further in the alley he runs across a man]
CARTMAN
Are you Teabag?
TEABAG
Maybe I am. Who's askin'?
CARTMAN
Cut the crap. You got the stuff?
TEABAG
Oh, I got the hookup. Question is, you got the money? [Cartman hands him a wad of bills] Alright, we're in biz. [turns right and grabs a couple of bags of KFC food, then hands them to Cartman, who looks inside each bag] It's all there, man.
CARTMAN
Extra crispy? [opens a small bowl of gravy and samples it carefully]
TEABAG
'Course, man, I ain't no fool.
CARTMAN
You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy!
TEABAG
Awww, it's all the same shit, man.
CARTMAN
IT'S NOT THE SAME SHIT! [reaches behind his back for a pistol and aims it at Teabag]
TEABAG
Okay okay I'm sorry, oh... [gets on his knees and shields his face]
CARTMAN
You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!
TEABAG
I'll take back the gravy.
CARTMAN
[lunges at him with the pistol, making him get on all fours] Like anybody wants KFC without gravy!
TEABAG
AAAH please. Please, I'm sorry! Take your money back! Take the KFC too! [Barbrady walks by and stops to look]
BARBRADY
What's going on back there?
CARTMAN
Nothin', it's cool.
[A table, evening. Jimbo and Ned are shown playing poker]
JIMBO
Alright, I'll call. Forty-five to you Ned.
RANDY
[puffs on a joint and coughs] Oh man. This Rainy Day Woman is the bomb. You guys don't know what you're missing.
PETER NELSON
Well you know, you could share some of that with us, Randy.
RANDY
No, Peter Nelson, that's illegal! I can smoke this because I have cancer.
PLAYER 1
Aw some on, just give us a little bit.
PLAYER 2
Yeah.
RANDY
Get your own medicinal marijuana cards! You've all got perfectly good microwaves at home! Look, I'm telling you guys, it's awesome. I can have all the pot I want, I get around faster than walking, and, wherever I need a seat, I can just sit on my balls. And let me tell you something else. [a player listens a little more closely] Chicks... love 'em.
PETER NELSON
Women love huge balls?
RANDY
Loove 'em. Everywhere I go, when I walk by, chicks are like turning their heads and going "whaaa?" I never knew how much women love guys' balls until I got these puppies. [pats his balls]
WOMAN 1
Travis, did you take out the garba-whaaa? [backs up at the sight of Randy's balls, then runs off]
RANDY
See?
[Billy Miller's house, later. Cartman walks down the stairs with the bags of KFC he got from Teabag.]
BILLY
Cartman my boy, you got the stuff?
CARTMAN
Yeah I got the stuff. [the other boys carry the bags away] And I got the money. [tosses the wad of bills back at Billy]
BILLY
Heyyy you're good Eric. I need people like you!
CARTMAN
Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here. [burps]
BILLY
That's alright Eric. I've got something big in the works. What if I told you... that I now have a direct line to get all the KFC we want here? I'm sending Tommy to Kentucky, to try and set up a little "arrangement" with the Colonel himself.
CARTMAN
Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel?
BILLY
That's right. And I'd like you to go as well and watch Tommy's back for me. Is that something you'd want to do?
CARTMAN
Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles?
BILLY
Excellent.
[Dr. Doctor's office, day. A nurse walks in with an envelope]
NURSE
Doctor, Mr. Klein's test results came in. [hands the envelope to the doctor, who opens it and pulls the results out]
DR. DOCTOR
What the hell is going on?
NURSE
Doctor?
DR. DOCTOR
This is the tenth case I've seen this week. It can't be a coincidence. Something in this town is giving men testicular cancer.
[South Park, day. Silly music plays as a line of men bounce down the sidewalk on their swollen balls, smoking pot all the while. The line of men consists of the poker players from Travis' place.]
JIMBO
Heh! Man, I am stoned off my ass!
PLAYER 3
I'm stoned off my balls! [another man laughs]
[Café Monet, day. The line of men hops past]
RANDY
Anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed?
WOMAN 2
Wow. Those guys have nice balls.
WOMAN 3
Wish my man had balls like those.
WOMAN 2
Mmm.
[Corbin, Kentucky, the Colonel's home, day. The Colonel is giving a tour of the place to Tommy and Cartman]
THE COLONEL
Our entire production is headquartered here, boys. We move over sixteen tons of chicken every month. Of course, with the new laws in Colorado my business has taken quite a hit. I'm worried other states might follow suit.
TOMMY
We know, Colonel, but we can get your chicken into the state. We just need a bulk deal, say, four ninety five a key?
CARTMAN
I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want.
THE COLONEL
I like you, Eric. There's no lying in you. Unfortunately, I don't feel the same about your friend.
CARTMAN
Who? You mean Tommy? [looks over at Tommy, then stops walking. The Colonel stops as well - Tommy is missing.] Wait, where'd he go?
THE COLONEL
Your partner is an informant for Jamie Oliver. [hands him some binoculars and shows him where Tommy is. Through the binoculars, Cartman sees Tommy being roughed up by two men inside a helicopter. One of the men shows Tommy where Cartman is. There's a noose around Tommy's neck. The guy who shows him where Cartman is throws him out of the helicopter and hangs him. Cartman is stunned, but quickly gets over it and laughs]
CARTMAN
Dude, that was sweet! He's all choked.
THE COLONEL
And how do I know you're not a liar too?
CARTMAN
Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you!
THE COLONEL
I think... you and me can work this thing out, Eric. Do business together a long time.
CARTMAN
Good.
THE COLONEL
Just remember, I only tell you one time. Don't fuck me, Eric. Don't you ever try to fuck me. [Cartman keeps his mouth shut]
[The Marsh house, day. Randy is by the sliding doors in back of the house, as his balls are too big for the front door now.]
SHARON
[walks up] Randy! Randy, will you look at yourself? Your balls are getting bigger.
RANDY
I know. They're pretty swollen. Kinda hurts. I'm gonna buy some more weed.
SHARON
Randy, please. When you get back, do you think maybe we could make love again? [looks down at his balls]
RANDY
Ohhh, someone's feeling frisky again. huh?
SHARON
Oh, it's just that I thought that more alone time would maybe be really-
RANDY
Hey. My eyes are up here.
SHARON
I'm sorry, I just...
RANDY
It's alright, I just want you to look at me when we make love and not just at my balls. I'll be home soon, babe. [sends her an air kiss and hops out]
[Medicinal marijuana dispensary, day. The same silly music from before plays. Randy hops up to the front door and opens it. He tries to hop in, but the balls are way too big, causing the music to stop. He gets off his balls and tries to shove them in]
RANDY
Hey uh, could you uh, give me half a pound of that Suburban Sunrise, please?
CLERK
I'm sorry sir, but you have to be inside the store.
RANDY
Well eh, I'm right here, can you just... bring it over?
CLERK
Selling medicinal marijuana outside the confines of an approved shop is still illegal.
[Randy tries to fit his balls through the door, grunting and murmuring from time to time, but they're just too damn big. He props them up so that he can shove them in with his ass, but they still won't go through]
RANDY
Look I'm startin' to feel kind of stupid; can I please get high?
[Billy Miller's cellar, day. As Billy's boys move the KFC around this basement warehouse, Billy is talking to Cartman]
BILLY
What, are you crazy Eric?! Making a deal with the Colonel for ten thousand more boxes?! I can't move that much chicken!
CARTMAN
[munching on a breast from a bucket] Will you relax, Billy? It's fine!
BILLY
...Fine? I'm not making any money here! I'm losing it! I have to pay for more security, I got the cops up my ass, and I have to pay for all these orders to cut the chicken for distribution!
CARTMAN
[munching on a drumstick, his back to Billy] Billy, Billy, we've gotta be thinking bigger here! It's time to expand!
BILLY
How can I expand when thirty-six percent of our product is going to you?! Get out there and sell the chicken or get lost! You've forgotten who the boss of this operation is, Eric!
CARTMAN
...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer.
BILLY
What is that supposed to mean?
CARTMAN
I... [turns around to face Billy] told your mom you got an F on that social studies test.
BILLY
[suddenly vulnerable] You wouldn't do that.
CARTMAN
Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys?
BILLY'S MOM
Billy?! Your father and I want to talk to you!
CARTMAN
Bye bye Billy. [Billy leaves] Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good.
[Medicinal marijuana dispensary, day. The poker players are bouncing around the dispensary's parking lot in protest. The clerk, the mayor and her aides, and a small crowd are watching these men]
RANDY
What do we want?
MEN
Bigger doors!
RANDY
Where do we want them?
MEN
Weed stores!
RANDY
What do we want?
MEN
Bigger doors!
RANDY
Where do we want them?
MEN
Weed stores!
CLERK
Look, I'm sorry, but the bill says I can't modify any existing structure.
MAN 1
Well I guess we could change the law to allow for medicinal marijuana to be sold just outside the door of the shop.
MAN 2
Egah I don't know, maybe the rule should be somebody can buy the medicinal weed for others.
CLERK
Look, can't we skip all this and just make pot legal? Everyone is just abusing this medicinal system anyway, it's ridiculous.
MAN 3
What's ridiculous about it?
DR. DOCTOR
[runs through the crowd] Hold on, hold people people, please! [stops] We are all forgetting what is really at issue here! Look around! These men all have cancer! It's no coincidence that when this building changed, the rise in cancer went up. Don't you see? The KFC was keeping people healthy!
[Billy's basement, day. Cartman has squandered everything Billy has worked for by eating all the chicken.]
TOUGH BOY 2
Mr. Cartman, come on. We're supposed to be handling the business; you're eating too much of the stuff.
CARTMAN
Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker!
TOUGH BOY 3
Eric, the Colonel is on the phone for you. He sounds pissed.
CARTMAN
What?! Oh, that's right, I forgot to- Dammit! Uh, okay. [leaves the throne] Put him on speaker.
THE COLONEL
Hello. Hello??
CARTMAN
Colonel, how are you doing?
THE COLONEL
What happened?
CARTMAN
[rips the skin off a breast and lays it on the table] Oh, we had some problems, you know? Colonel? [takes out a credit card and starts mincing the skin as if it were crack cocaine, into lines of finely ground skin]
THE COLONEL
Eric, what happened??
CARTMAN
We had a little problem.
THE COLONEL
I heard.
CARTMAN
[snorts a line into his nose] Yeah? How'd, how'd you hear that?
THE COLONEL
Because Jamie Oliver gave his speech at the UN today. He was not supposed to give that speech, Eric!
CARTMAN
Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time.
THE COLONEL
There's not going to be a next time you fucking dumb cocksucker!
CARTMAN
Hey, take it easy Colonel.
THE COLONEL
I told you a long time ago, you fucking little monkey, not to fuck me!
CARTMAN
[grabs the phone] Hey! Hey who the fuck do you think you're talking to, huh?! Huh?! [hears someone breaking in and looks over his shoulder] Oh crap! [five men pour into the basement and start firing their machine guns at the boys, who scatter and try to escape. Two more men jump into the basement. More men outside the house begin firing their weapons. The police arrive and begin firing at the attackers]
BARBRADY
Freeze!
HENCHMAN
It's the cops! [Barbrady kills him. Another attacker is killed nearby. Cartman looks outside from the basement and begins his escape. Billy and his mom begin their escape as well, but through the front door]
BILLY'S MOM
Run Billy, run! [a bullet kills her. Cartman leaves the basement and escapes]
BILLY
Mommy, no!
[South Park City Hall, day. The top city officials are there, including the Mayor and her aides, Sgt. Yates and Murphy, and Dr. Doctor. Officer Barbrady addresses the crowd]
BARBRADY
Last November, this town passed a bill that seemed silly to some. Since then we've had underground black markets, crime, death, and shootings. But now the bill has been repealed, and I am relieved to announce that once again, marijuana is illegal. [the crowd cheers, and Dr. Doctor takes the mic]
DR. DOCTOR
And another bill has been repealed as well. Because ever since we got rid of KFC, we've seen a great rise in cancer. But today we welcome back KFC, and all the medical benefits it gives us. [the store has been renamed MFC - Medicinal Fried Chicken]
RANDY
Well I got to admit, it's a lot easier to get in doors with my little prosthetic balls. [Sharon folds her arms and looks up and away angrily]
SHARON
Yeah. Great.
RANDY
Aw, Sharon, don't be upset. The doctor made you a souvenir. [reaches into a bag and pulls out a flesh-colored winter coat. Sharon looks at it and grins instantly]
SHARON
Randy, I love it! [puts it on and strikes a few poses]
RANDY
And when it gets cold it shrinks. [two women approach them]
NELLY'S MOM
Sharon, you got a scrotum coat?
SHARON
Yyyup!
WOMAN 5
Luckyyyyy!
End of Medicinal Fried Chicken

synopsis:When Kyle begs Stan to "friend" him, Stan gets sucked into Facebook.

script:You Have 0 Friends

[Kyle's room, day. Kyle is at his computer. Kenny's on his laptop on Kyle's bed while Cartman is on the Internet on his phone.]
CARTMAN
I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle!
KYLE
How the hell do you have more friends than me?
CARTMAN
'Cause people think I'm cool, dude.
KYLE
How many friends do you have, Kenny?
KENNY
(Sixty two.)
KYLE
What? How the hell do I only have thirty-seven friends?
STAN
[walks in] Aww, are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again?
CARTMAN
[retorts] Stupid Facebook stuff.
STAN
Why are you guys in here wasting your time? We're supposed to be out playing video games.
KYLE
Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it.
STAN
Dude, who the hell wants to play Yahtzee?
CARTMAN
Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you.
KYLE
Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page. [smiles]
CARTMAN
Surprise! [smiles]
STAN
Noo, I told you guys I don't wanna be on Facebook!
KYLE
Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us!
KENNY
(Yeah!)
STAN
I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms! I don't wanna get sucked into this!
CARTMAN
Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy.
STAN
Who?
CARTMAN
Kip Drordy, the third grader? He's got nooo Facebook friends. [begins to gloat] And he's had a profile for more than six months.
KYLE
Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend.
STAN
You guys are retarded, I'm playing Xbox. [turns around and walks out.]
KYLE
There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong.
[Kip Drordy's room, day. Kip sits there on his stool, a lonely figure with a misshapen head, looking at his monitor, hoping for a friend to finally appear on his Facebook page. "You have 0 friends." He looks away from the monitor and sighs, wiping a tear from his nose. A small pop-up window appears. Kip looks at it, then startles himself. He gets to his keyboard and reads the window: "Kyle Broflovski has added you as a friend." He rubs his eyes in disbelief and looks again. "Confirm Kyle as your friend?" He moves the cursor down to the "Confirm" button and clicks on it. Now his page reads "You have 1 friends."]
KIP
[getting excited] Ahhhhh. [gets off his stool and runs around the room] Haaa! Haaaaaaaaaa! Yeah! [opens the door, runs out of his room and down the stairs and into the kitchen]
[Kitchen, day.]
KIP
Mom, Dad! I made a friend today!
KIP'S MOM
Kip, really?
KIP'S DAD
You did?
KIP
Yeah!! [jumps for joy]
KIP'S DAD
Huh son, that's wonderful.
KIP'S MOM
What's his name?
KIP
Kyle Broflovski! He's a student, and his interests include video games and reading.
KIP'S MOM
Oh, is he a nice boy?
KIP
Oh, he's the best, Mom! He has a green hat, and he wants the world to stop talking about ninjas. Oh! I need to tell him what I'm currently thinking about! What am I currently thinking about?! [runs back to his room]
[The Marsh dining room, evening. Stan is at the table doing homework. Randy pops in from the kitchen.]
RANDY
Hey Stan, I was on my computer at work and saw that you have a Facebook page now?
STAN
Yeah, Dad, I was kinda forced to.
RANDY
Well sooo... are you gonna add me as a friend?
STAN
[looks over his shoulder] No- Dad, I I really don't wanna get more into it.
RANDY
...Oh okay. [walks away, but returns a few seconds later] So I'm, I'm not your friend then?
STAN
...Dad, you are my friend.
RANDY
...But you just don't wanna, add me, as a friend?
STAN
Dad, it's just a stupid click of a button, it takes two seconds!
RANDY
Right, but you don't have... the two seconds orrr?
STAN
I just wanna do my homework!
RANDY
Alright, fine. [walks away again. Stan puts his face in his left palm, then gets back to homework. Randy returns...] Just to be clear, you and I are not... friends?
STAN
Alright, Dad, I'll add you!
RANDY
Oh cool! Okay. [walks away]
[The Drordy house, night. The parents are watching TV from their sofa. Kip runs in.]
KIP
Mom, Dad, my best friend Kyle? He went to the dentist yesterday, and got two fillings! And today he's wondering if Hurt Locker really deserved the Oscar!
KIP'S MOM
That's great, Kip!
KIP
Yeah! [runs off]
KIP'S DAD
They sure are getting to know each other.
KIP'S MOM
It's amazing! You know Kip spent the morning at the boy's farm?
KIP'S DAD
His friend lives on a farm?
[Kyle's room, night. He's at his computer working on his farm - in Farmville.]
KYLE
I think I'll add some more... pigs. [done] Oh, maybe I should put in another field of corn there. [moves his avatar to his corn fields and adds one] There we go. Nice. [a click and a small whoosh are heard, and Kyle looks at his screen. "You have 29 friends"] Twenty nine? No, I have thirty friends. [a click and a small whoosh are heard. "You have 28 friends." More of these sounds are heard as Kyle's friend count drops] Hey what the hell is-? Oh no! Oh shit! [Kyle does what he can, but keeps losing friends]
[South Park Elementary, day. Stan is at his locker switching books. Wendy walks up behind him.]
WENDY
Am I a joke to you?
STAN
[stops moving, then turns around] What?
WENDY
I just wanna know, is that all I am? A big joke?
STAN
...Um, no?
WENDY
You do have a Facebook page, Stan!
STAN
Oh Goddamnit no! I just got that because Kyle-
WENDY
Yeah well I saw your page, Stan! Relationship status? Single?
STAN
Relationship stat- I didn't even pay any attention to that-
WENDY
You like being single, Stan? So that you could Facebook to find other girls?! According to your Facebook page, [crosses her arms] we aren't friends!
STAN
Alright, I'll add you as a friend. I'm sorry.
WENDY
And you'd better change your relationship status to "In a relationship"!
STAN
How?
WENDY
By editing your profile under "basic information"!
STAN
Okay, I'm sorry!
[Stan's room, night. He's at his computer editing his profile.]
STAN
"Edit profile. Basic... settings" Jesus Christ!
RANDY
Stan? Why won't you be friends with Grandma?
STAN
...Aw. Dad, I just really don't wanna pay attention to this thing!
RANDY
Grandma is in the hospital! And you won't even be friends with her!
STAN
Alright, Dad, I'll add Grandma as a friend.
RANDY
That's better. Oh, and I sent you a funny picture and you didn't respond to it. [walks away]
STAN
Dude, fuck Facebook! Seriously! [an update pops up] What the hell is this?! Podcast?
CARTMAN
[in a video podcast] Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast! [Mad Friends podcast. Cartman sits behind a Mad Friends desk. At the bottom of the screen are two tickers. The upper one shows changes in friend stocks, the lower one shows Facebook updates] Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends! [rings a bell and leaves his chair] Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon. [presses a big red button, which produces a shotgun blast] You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why? [shows a birthday cake] Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita. [presses a button that produces the sound of a whistle] If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street. [cranks up a player that repeats "Word On The Street"] The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger [presses a robot that says "MERGER"] So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle!
[The Marsh living room, nighttime. A knock is heard at the front door and Stan walks to the door and opens it. It's raining outside and Kyle is on the steps. He sniffles.]
KYLE
Can I come in?
STAN
Sure dude. [Kyle enters, still sniffling] Dude, what's the matter?
[Kyle turns to face his friend, tears in his eyes.]
KYLE
I... don't... have... any... friends...
STAN
What?
KYLE
I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now.
STAN
Okay dude, I'm I'm here for you.
KYLE
'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops?
STAN
No!
KYLE
Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!
STAN
Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do not want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!
KYLE
[rushes up to Stan, falls on his knees, and grabs the lower part of his friend's jacket] You don't get sucked into it! You don't get sucked in at all! Plehehehehehease!
STAN
[frustrated] Ah, fuck!
[Stan's room, moments later. Stan is at his computer while Kyle watches on his phone.]
STAN
Okay it says I'm at your farm.
KYLE
'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button... [Stan does so] and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my farm... [Stan does so] Okay, now I can read the sign you put up...
STAN
'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends.
KYLE
Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan!
[The Drordy house, day. The family is in the kitchen. Kip and his father are at the table eating while his mom is in the kitchen proper serving herself.]
KIP'S DAD
So Kip, you spend more time with your buddy Kyle today?
KIP
Oh yeah Dad, we've been havin' the best time! I showed him all the pictures of me and that silly Halloween costume last year.
KIP'S MOM
[joins the boys at the table] Oh, what'd he say about those?
KIP
He laughed out loud. And then he was rollin' on the floor laughin'!
KIP'S DAD
Sounds like you boys had a ball!
KIP
Mom, Dad, I'm all done. Can I go hang out with Kyle and tell him all about what I had for dinner?
KIP'S DAD
Well it's a little late, but it is Friday.
KIP'S MOM
I think the more time you spend with your little friend, the better.
KIP
Wow, thanks! [runs out of the kitchen]
KIP'S MOM
Have fun and be safe! [Kip runs through the living room and upstairs, then enters his own room]
[Kip's room, night. Kip runs to his computer and gets onto Facebook. He begins to type.]
KIP
Ate a pork chop for dinner. Had nice apple sauce too. [clicks on Share, and there's his status. He waits for a reply, from 7:20 to... 8:30. He gets a reply: Kyle likes the post] Hahaa haha! Yeah! [gets off his chair and dances around] Yeah, yeah, yeah!
[South Park, day. Stan exits a Comic store with some comic books and turns right, only to stop when he sees Wendy.]
WENDY
"I think you look cute in your bunny costume."
STAN
What?
WENDY
"I think you look cute in your bunny costume." What is that supposed to mean?!
STAN
...I have no idea.
WENDY
That's what Susan92 wrote on your Facebook wall! You give girls pictures of you in bunny outfits?! Fuck you! [walks off angrily]
STAN
[turns to see her walk off] Susan92 is a friend of my grandma's and she's 92 years old! [turns around and continues on his way. He walks by an electronics store]
MAN 1
[standing in the doorway with a cigarette in his left hand] Oh hey Stan, I'm your friend Brian through your uncle Jimbo? Hey I commented on your status but I haven't heard back from you. Could you give me a poke sometime soon?
STAN
Fine! [continues walking, but a car pulls up next to him.]
MAN 2
Hey kid, how come you ignored my friend request?
STAN
[looks at him like he's crazy] I don't know you!
MAN 2
Yeah, well I'm just a guy that gets ignored, I guess! [spits on Stan and drives off, Stan begins to shake in anger]
[Stan's computer, later. He's looking at his Facebook page, still steaming from his encounters outside Comic Factory. "You have 845,000 friends".]
RANDY
Stan? Grandma said she poked you and you haven't sent a poke back.
STAN
...Dad, I didn't even wanna do th-
RANDY
Stan, poke your grandma!
STAN
[squeezes his eyes shut and stays still for a moment] No. NO! Screw this! You know what? "Edit Profile > Update Profile." There! "Delete Profile"! [reads the popup] "You have requested to delete your Facebook profile. If this is an error, hit Cancel" Proceed! [presses "Proceed," then reads the next popup.] "Delete your profile, are you sure? Yes. No." Yes! "Are you totally sure?" Yes! [clicks on it and his screen goes black. A blinking amber cursor appears]
COMPUTER VOICE
[the following words appear onscreen] I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Stan Marsh.
STAN
You can't let me do that? What are you talking about? [his monitor has a built-in Webcam]
COMPUTER VOICE
I'm gonna have to put you on the game grid.
STAN
Delete Profile! "Are you totally sure? Yes or-" Yes! Goddamnit yes! Delete! Delete delete! [the webcam lights up and shoots a laser at Stan's forehead, knocking him back on his chair. It then sets up boxes of energy around his body] Hey Dad? [the camera begins scanning him in bit by bit, pixel by pixel] Dad? [He disappeared from his chair and he transported through the webcam. He soon appears on a virtual floor after traveling down some tunnels] Oh dude, what the fuck? [Neon lights appear all over]
[Inside the game grid. Three guards approach him.]
GUARD 1
Alright get moving, Profile.
STAN
Profile? I'm not a profile.
GUARD 1
Ignore. [shocks him with an electric prod.]
STAN
AAH. [The guards escort Stan away]
PROFILE 1
Tom Davis says hello to Linda Green's profile.
PROFILE 2
Linda Green likes how Tom Davis has changed his status.
STAN
Excuse me, my name is-
PROFILE 3

STAN
Eh hey, could you tell me how I-
PROFILE 4
Ignore.
STAN
[realizes where he is] Aw Goddamnit I got sucked into Facebook!
[Mad Friends, which is being broadcast from Cartman's basement. Kyle has made it onto Cartman's podcast.]
KYLE
I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.
CARTMAN
You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him.
KYLE
I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad.
CARTMAN
Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip.
KYLE
I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.
CARTMAN
It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?
KYLE
No. What's chatroulette?
[Cartman's room, later. Cartman is at his computer while Kyle sits on a chair looking on.]
CARTMAN
Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette.
KYLE
Hey, uh that's, that's kinda cool.
CARTMAN
Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect.
KYLE
[a look of disgust comes over him] Aww, that's some dude jacking off! [turns away quickly]
CARTMAN
Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello?
KYLE
That's just a guy's penis too!
CARTMAN
Okay let's, let's try this one.
KYLE
[turns away quickly] Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises!
CARTMAN
Hold on, Kyle! This is seriously an amazing gathering place where people from all over the world can share their thoughts and ideas. [goes onto the next person] Okay, that's a dude jacking off, but... 'Kay, dude jacking off... Penis... Penis... Penis penis penis. Ah! Here's a guy! Hey dude, how's it going?
DUDE
[waves] Hey.
CARTMAN
This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends.
DUDE
Oh yeah? [leaves his chair and goes to the other end of his room, turns around, unzips his pants]
CARTMAN
Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy...
KYLE
Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore!
CARTMAN
Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first!
[The game grid. Stan walks around.]
STAN
Excuse me. Could you tell me what the hell's going on?
TOM DAVIS
No, you aren't my friend. Would you like to be my friend?
STAN
No, I seriously don't want any more friends.
TOM DAVIS
Ignore. [turns to talk to another profile] So anyway, I really like taking long walks in the summer, you know, because there's like
STAN
Okay I'll be your friend.
TOM DAVIS
[turns back to Stan] Confirm. [both of them feel a surge of energy in their game suits, shown by the suits lighting up, then it disappears] Oooo, Tom Davis is thrilled to have become powerful by adding a new friend. Here are some pictures of my dog. And here he is in some silly outfits. Can you comment on these?
STAN
Awww!
GUARD
[comes up behind Stan] Move it, profile!
TOM DAVIS
Oh oh.
STAN
Why oh oh?
PROFILE 5
They're taking him to the gaming arena.
TOM DAVIS
Looks like I'm gonna be down a friend. [the guards escort Stan to the arena, shocking him once in a while. Another profile appears next to him]
REFEREE
You are about to face each other in combat! You will play the game for the amusement of the users! [the arena is activated and Stan and the other profile are sent in] Let the game commence! [they face each other and virtual bikes pop up under them, lifting them off the floor. The bikes are replaced with a table and two stools and a guard brings a game of Yahtzee to the table.]
STAN
Yahtzee?
REFEREE
One round only! Begin! [the opposing profile rolls first, leaves a pair of 3s and scoops up three dice, rolls again]
PROFILE 6
Uhhh, I'm gonna count five in my five box.
STAN
Can't we play on speeder bikes or something?
GUARD
[shocks him] Play, profile!
STAN
[rolls and gets five 4s] Yahtzee. [the other profile gasps and vanishes in a fair bit of pain]
[Cartman's room, later. Cartman is still clicking through chatroulette chatters.]
CARTMAN
Dude jacking off... Dude jacking off... [coughs to clear his throat] That's a dude jacking off...
KYLE
That's it Cartman, I'm outta here! [walks to the bedroom door] Chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends! [about to open the door]
CARTMAN
Waitwait wait wait, wait Kyle! [Kyle turns and goes back to Cartman's desk.] Here's a nice little Jewish kid. Hey, hi there.
BOY
Hello.
CARTMAN
Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too.
BOY
Oh that's cool. I was startin' to think this was nothin' but dudes jackin' off.
KYLE
Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends?
BOY
Uhh, sure. If you'll come and visit my farm.
KYLE
Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too!
[The Drordy house, day, kitchen. Mr. Drordy reads The World News, Mrs. Drordy is drying dishes.]
KIP'S DAD
Honey, where's Kip? I haven't seen him all day.
KIP'S MOM
No, he's been out spending the whole day with his best friend Kyle. I think they're at the movies now.
[The Bijou. Kip is in the audience enjoying the hell out of himself. He's watching a 3D movie with everyone else, as they're all wearing 3D glasses. He spills some popcorn onto an open laptop he brought with him. Kyle's Facebook page appears on the laptop screen. Kip takes out a camera and snaps a shot of himself and his laptop]
[[The gaming arena. The referee is angry...]]
REFEREE
Troublemaker! You were not supposed to survive the game of Yahtzee! You have made things complicated!
STAN
I've made them complicated?! I don't even wanna be here!
REFEREE
That's not what your profile said.
STAN
My profile? Goddamnit my Facebook profile has taken on a life of its own! Where is it?!
REFEREE
Your profile is one of the most powerful in all of Facebook. You cannot stop it now.
STAN
Oh yeah? I can try! [turns around and walks through a wall]
REFEREE
After him!
[Kyle's Facebook page. Kyle is working on his farm again.]
KYLE
Okay, I fed the pigs. Now I definitely should water some fields... Oh wow, cool. That Jewish kid put up a sign on my farm. "Hey Kyle, really like your farm." Oh awesome! [a new sound is heard] What the hell is that? Stan? [Stan appears on Kyle's farm and walks to the middle of the screen]
STAN
You're an asshole, Kyle!
KYLE
[perplexed] ...What?
STAN
What's the one thing I told you?! That I didn't wanna get sucked into Facebook! This is all your fault!
KYLE
[looks around making sure the coast is clear] Dude, w-what are you doing?
STAN
What's it look like I'm doing?! I found your farm in Facebook so you can help me deal with this bullshit! You've gotta go check out my profile status!
KYLE
Profile status?
STAN
Just bring up my Facebook page and see what it says my status is!
KYLE
Well, Stan I have to harvest my crops before it's too late.
STAN
DUDE! Fuck your crops! [walks up to Kyle's corn and starts ripping the stalks up]
KYLE
Dude! Dude okay! S-Stop! I'm sorry! [pulls up Stan's status] Says that you are currently... hosting an online chat party for all your friends.
STAN
Where?
KYLE
Café World.
STAN
Son of a bitch! [runs back to the barn he came out of]
KYLE
An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there!
[Café World. Stan approaches the entrance, which has a sign next to it: "Friends of Stan Marsh Online Chat Party". He enters and is overwhelmed by the number of people in the café.]
STAN

GARY JOHNSON'S PROFILE
Gary Johnson thinks the pictures are fantastic!
KYLE
Wow, there's a lot of profiles here. Kyle Broflovski's amazed Stan has so many Facebook friends. Hey, Kyle Broflovski's amazed Isiah is also a Facebook friend of Stan's.
ISIAH
Isiah's order is on leaving Kyle Broflovski as a friend.
KYLE
What? Why?
ISIAH
User saw you were friends with Kip Drordy, who only has one friend. Kyle Broflovski is bad friend stock.
KYLE
Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him.
ISIAH
Ignore.
KYLE
Unh, that does it!
STAN
Alright alright, enough! Everybody just SHUT UP! [everyone shuts up and looks at him] Where is profile Stan Marsh?! [the room begins to rumble]
PROFILE STAN MARSH
[rising from the ground] Right here.
STAN
Uh-oh...
[Kyle's room, night. Kyle is at his desk thinking about how to break the news to Kip.]
KYLE
I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy. [moves the cursor to the Send button and clicks it. With the message sent, Kyle moves the cursor to the left side of the screen and selects "Remove from Friends," and clicks that. A popup window shows up: "Kip Drordy - Remove from Friends?" He clicks on "Remove from Friends" and Facebook tells him his friend is removed.]
[Kip's room, night. He's at his computer typing along happily when he sees Kyle's message. He's disheartened. Kyle disappears from his friend list and he's back down to 0 friends. Kip leaves his stool and walks over to a wall on which he has a large picture of Kyle. He takes the picture down and returns to his stool, and sighs.]
[The gaming arena. Stan and his profile face off. His profile is ten times bigger than Stan himself is, towering over him.]
STAN
What do you want from me, dude?!
PROFILE STAN MARSH
I'm your profile, and as you can see, I am much more powerful than you.
STAN
Damnit I should have deleted you a long time ago!
PROFILE STAN MARSH
[gets down on one knee to Stan's eye level] Why do you think I brought you in here? The fact of the matter is I'm up and running now with almost a million friends. I don't need you anymore. I have more friends than you'll ever have in the real world.
STAN
Who cares? Friends shouldn't be some kind of... commodity for a person's status!
PROFILE STAN MARSH
Who is more powerful? The user or the profile? Let's end this once and for all. [the Yahtzee platform appears under them]
REFEREE
Let the final battle begin! [the crowd drops down, or the platform rises. Hard to tell. The table and two stools appear and a guard brings the Yahtzee board game over]
STAN
Fuckin' Yahtzee again? Seriously? [his giant profile takes a seat and rolls the dice]
PROFILE STAN MARSH
What did I tell you?! That's a large flush already! You don't have a chance in here, user! You pathetic little-
STAN
Yahtzee.

What?!
STAN
Yahtzee. Sixes.
PROFILE STAN MARSH
No. Can't be.
RANDY
Yahtzee!
PROFILE STAN MARSH
No! Ahhhhh! [vanishes in a fair bit of pain. After some silence, Stan disappears from the arena and is reassembled back on his chair at home]
[Stan's room, moments later.]
STAN
Awgh! [catches his breath. With his profile destroyed, Stan sees that he has 0 friends.] Oh thank God.
RANDY
Hey Stan, my computer says we're not friends anymore?
STAN
My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else.
RANDY
Oh okay. So we're, we're not friends, then?
STAN
Fuck off, Dad. [turns off the monitor and leaves his desk.]
[Kip's room, night. Kip is waiting by his computer for a friend, any friend, to appear and become his friend. A sound is heard and all of a sudden Kip has a lot of friends - 845,323 of them - and he's shocked. Then he gets excited all over again. He dances and jumps on his stool.]

script:200

[At fudge factory for a field trip, A tour guide shows Mr. Garrison's class around the factory]
TOUR GUIDE
Our factory works 24/7 to produce candy, and we have over 500 employees. Here you can see where the cocoa is mixed with the sugar and milk.
CARTMAN
Wow, coo'... [snaps a picture] Chocolate rules!
KYLE
You should know, fatass.
CARTMAN
AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew!
STAN
Oh God, you guys, really? This again? [the students all move to the next spot in the tour]
TOUR GUIDE
And here is where all the fudge is put into boxes to be shipped all over the world.
KYLE
Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him.
CARTMAN
I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad.
STAN
You guys, stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff! [everyone moves on except Butters, who spots something]
BUTTERS
Hey, Stan, isn't that Tom Cruise?
STAN
Huh? [Tom Cruise is packing fudge into boxes with a hat pulled low over his face] Oh, wow it is! Hey, guys, check it out. Tom Cruise is a fudge packer!
TOM CRUISE
What did you call me?
CARTMAN
Hey, that is Tom Cruise! [snaps a picture]
BUTTERS
How come you're packin' fudge, Mr. Cruise?
TOM CRUISE
I'm not a fudge packer!
KYLE
Dude, you don't have to be ashamed or anything.
TOM CRUISE
But I'm not a fudge packer! [packs a block of fudge into a box]
STAN
Then why are you packing fudge?
TOM CRUISE
I'm not. I'm a very busy actor. I'm just trying to get away for a week and do some fly fishing! [pushes more fudge into boxes]
STAN
Dude, you are in a fudge factory packing fudge.
TOM CRUISE
Oh, that does it. I will SUE you!
STAN
For what?
TOM CRUISE
You can't just call somebody a fudge packer and get away with it! [Mr. Garrison walks over]
MR. GARRISON
Hey, is that fudge packer Tom Cruise?
TOM CRUISE
That's it! [throws his hat away] I'm suing this entire intolerant town!
STAN
But, dude-
TOM CRUISE
No buts! You wanna to accuse somebody of being a fudgepacker, you're gonna pay the consequences!
[At Tom Cruise's mountain lodge, a big crowd of celebrities has gathered.]
TOM CRUISE
Guys, I want to really thank you all for coming. Shockingly, I've just been slandered once again in the town of South Park, something I know you can all relate to. [all celebrities nod and agree]
TIGER WOODS
That town just seems to be a hotbed of hatred and lies!
BONO
I'm fed up with it. That town suggested that I was made of shit!
TOM CRUISE
Yeah, well, I was just over there doing some fly fishing and this little boy walks up and calls me a fudge packer! [The celebrities all are shocked and appealed] I know, right? And then other kids in the town and their teacher start joining in. [Sally Struthers is taking up the whole couch, except for the small place of an annoyed Mickey Mouse.]
SALLY STRUTHERS
South Park, Colorado, is the most racist, insensitive, and bigoted place in this country! [George Lucas holding onto a ball-gagged Indiana Jones]
GEORGE LUCAS
That town thinks they can say whatever they want about people and get away with it!
PARIS HILTON
If anyone has a gripe against that shithole, it's me! [coughs up some semen, then rubs it on John Travolta's crotch]
TOM CRUISE
Yeah, well, I say enough. All of us together can put a stop to that slander coming from that town once and for all! No longer will they make snide remarks about whoever they want.
ALL CELEBRITIES
YEAH!
JARED FOGLE
Hey, Tom, I ate too much Subway. Where's your bathroom?
TOM CRUISE
Oh, just the door down the hall there, Jared. [Jared opens the door to find a closet] No, no, no, that's a closet. Go down more. [Jared opens another door, which is also a closet.] No, that's a closet too. [Jared opens a door, and once again it is a closet] Nope, Jared, that's a closet too. [Jared opens another door, it is another closet] No. [Jared opens two more doors, both closets] That's a closet... No that- that's a closet too.
[At South Park Elementary, Mr. Garrison's class.]

KYLE
Dude, what did you do?
STAN
I have no idea...
[Walks into Victoria's office to discover his parents, the mayor, the counselor, Kyle's parents, and the police]
RANDY
You just had to push it, didn't you, Stan? You just had to make fun of Tom Cruise again!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA

Aww... he was packing fudge!
MAYOR
Little boy, you don't understand how serious this is. Tom Cruise has put together a class-action lawsuit, along with 200 other celebrities!
MR. MACKEY
They are going to sue the bejezzus out of this entire town, m'kay!
STAN
It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar-
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
But you started it. Mr. Broflovski, tell him what you told us.
GERALD
Stan, a class-action lawsuit means the end of this town. We can't possibly go up against their lawyers!
SGT. YATES
Dammit, Marsh, why couldn't you have just kept your stupid ugly kid in line?!
RANDY
Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks!
[Back at the fudge factory, Tom Cruise is busy packing fudge as Stan and Randy stand behind him. Stan has taken off his hat and looks at the floor guiltily.]
RANDY
Mr. Cruise, my son is so, so sorry, and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments.
TOM CRUISE
That's nice! [punches the button to take away fudge he just packed] I'm still suing you all! Nobody calls me a fudge packer! [pushes fudge into a box]
RANDY
Yes, it was a terrible mistake. But maybe you could see how, since you do... take fudge and... pack it into a box... [Tom Cruise turns around]
TOM CRUISE
WHAT?
RANDY
We-, I-I'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who... packages...
TOM CRUISE
I am an actor. I do not pack fudge! [turns around and throws a piece of fudge into a box angrily]
RANDY
Right, my son just got confused. Because you have a little uniform, and a... hat that says "Fred's Fudge and Candies"... and you are... Look it doesn't matter. Just please withdraw the class-action lawsuit. Nobody in our town will ever call you a fudge packer again. [Tom Cruise sighs and backs away from his fudge packing station]
TOM CRUISE
Well, there is... one thing that your town could do to... maybe make me forget about this lawsuit.
RANDY
ANYTHING! Anything you want, Mr. Cruise.
TOM CRUISE
It's just that there's somebody that I have always wanted to meet... face to face. If you could get him to show up in your town-
RANDY
Sure! Who is it? We can get anybody for you.
TOM CRUISE
Muhammad. The prophet of the Muslim faith.
STAN
Ooooooo...
RANDY
That's... tricky...
TOM CRUISE
Well, then you can just get sued! [Returns to packing fudge]
RANDY
Mr. Cruise, if there is anybody else we could bring to town, we-
TOM CRUISE
No! Just him. You get Muhammad to appear in South Park, or your little town is DONE!
[South Park Town Meeting Hall. Angry chatter is heard while Randy is speaking to the audience, with Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mayor and her aides sitting on chairs beside him.]
RANDY
Okay, people, I know, I know. But he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just... get Muhammad to appear in South Park.
MR. GARRISON
Are you nuts? If Muhammad appears in South Park, we get bombed! [audience shouts in agreement]
STEPHEN
We don't know that. Maybe enough time has passed, and now it's now OKAY to show Muhammad.
KYLE
[to Tolkien] Dude, I can't believe we are dealing with this Muhammad thing again.
MR. MACKEY
But even if it were safe for Muhammad come, how would we ever find him?
SGT. YATES
Yeah, showing an image of him is completely off limits and censored, so nobody has seen what Muhammad looks like. [shows the whole audience. Stan in the middle raises his hand]
STAN
I saw him once. [everyone turns towards Stan]
MCDANIELS
[steps forward] You did?
STAN
Yeah, a while ago, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends.
MR. GARRISON
Oh, and what- he was just out in the open where everybody could see him and nobody got bombed?
STAN
No, dude, it was totally fine.
SGT. YATES
Muhammad showed up and there was no violence at all?
STAN
Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln...
RANDY
Alright, Stan, that's enough. Jesus, can't learn to shut up, can you? Now look, I believe we CAN find Muhammad. I've done a lot of research and I have completed a sketch of what Muhammad might look like today. [holds up a file and begins to open it]
MR. GARRISON
No, don't! [Randy holds it up to reveal a poorly drawn stick figure] Is that okay to show?
JIMBO
I don't know. I guess we'll see.
[Tom Cruise's Lodge]
HILLARY CLINTON
Tom, what is up with this Muhammad thing? It doesn't make sense!
JESSE JACKSON
Yeah, you said we were just suing South Park.
TOM CRUISE
No, I said we were going to use South Park to make sure we never got ripped on again. Look, people, all of us get ridiculed, but who is the one person on this earth who is completely free from slander?
OPRAH WINFREY
You want Muhammad because he can't be ridiculed?
TOM CRUISE
Muhammad has a power that makes him impervious to being made fun of. What if we could harness that power? [moves over to Jimmy Buffet] Jimmy Buffet, how would you like it if nobody could call your music drunken frat boy monkey garbage?
JIMMY BUFFETT
I... I'd love it!
TOM CRUISE
By taking what Muhammad has, we could all be safe from ridicule. [walks to the bar next to Tim Burton] Like Tim Burton here. Imagine it Tim; nobody could rip on you for all the rehashed movies you've made lately. There'd never be a TV show that pointed out that you have never had an original idea since Beetlejuice. And, you put Johnny Depp and the same crappy music in every film. And if you're that in love with Johnny Depp, you should just have sex with him already. A TV show could never say that!
TIM BURTON
Gee, that'd be swell.
TOM CRUISE
Well it can be a reality. Once we have Muhammad, we can take his power from him. [Cartman walks in]
CARTMAN
Excuse me... [the celebrities turn around] This is the home of Tom Cruise, right?
TOM CRUISE
Hey! It's one of the boys from South Park who slandered me!
CARTMAN
I didn't come for myself. I'm just an escort for another celebrity who wants to get in on your lawsuit...
MICHAEL RICHARDS
Who? [Cartman lifts up his hand and takes off his glove, revealing fake hair and painted on lips. It is Jennifer Lopez.]
JENNIFER LOPEZ
Alllloooo... [celebrities gasp]
TOM CRUISE
Jennifer Lopez! [celebrities crowd around saying hellos to Jennifer]
JENNIFER LOPEZ
Yes, I am Hennifer Lopez, and I like tacos and burritos.
[Turns into the opening theme for the Super Best Friends Show. As religious figures pop onto the screen, the one to the left of the middle is blocked with a giant bar reading CENSORED]
NARRATOR
In the great hall of the Super Best Friends, there are assembled the leaders of the world's biggest religions; Jesus! [Jesus smiles and hammers a wood board] Buddha! [Buddha pries apart the screen] Krishna! [Krishna snaps his fingers and becomes a beaver] Muhammad! [Muhammad is walking down a street, but he has been replaced with a giant bar reading CENSORED] Lao Tzu and Joseph Smith [Walking down a corridor like the opening of Scooby Doo] and... the mighty Semen! [The word "Seaman" appears on the screen, but he says semen]
SEAMAN
It's not semen, it's Seaman!
NARRATOR
[covering up a laugh] Their mission; to right back which is wrong, and to serve all mankind.
[Stan and Kyle are sitting at a table, surrounded by the Super Best Friends except for Muhammad.]
STAN
Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour.
JESUS
My son, much has changed since you were last here. Muhammad cannot make public appearances.
BUDDHA
We simply cannot risk any violence from the Muslim people
STAN
Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ!
NARRATOR
Later, at the hall of the Super Best Friends...
KYLE
Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?
JOSEPH SMITH
No, Muslims would still be angry if you showed his face.
KYLE
K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag?
LAO TZU
No, 'cause you would still be showing him walking around, that could be a-trouble.
STAN
Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything.
JESUS
But it's still Muhammad walking around in human form.
KYLE
Aww, come on! This is ridiculous! [pounds hands on table]
JOSEPH SMITH
Boys, you need to understand that people get very offended when Muhammad is mocked because he is a religious figure. [snorting noise, Buddha is snorting cocaine]
JESUS
Buddha, don't do coke in front of kids! [Kyle and Stan stare open mouthed for a second]
KYLE
A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?
JOSEPH SMITH
But he's talking from the U-Haul?
STAN
Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there!
JESUS
Hearing his voice, I don't know. What do you think Moses? [Moses is floating over in the previously unseen corner]
MOSES
Um... would there be windows on the U-Haul?
KYLE
There doesn't have to be...
MOSES
Um... I guess... I guess that would be okay.
[Tom Cruises Lodge, celebrities file into a large room which has a machine on the wall]
TOM CRUISE
Here it is friends. Once we have Muhammad, this machine will give us the power to not be made fun of.
RUSSEL CROWE
Tom, Tom, you're talkin' crazy, mate. Only Muhammad has that ability, how could we ever get it from him? [Rob Reiner walks in with a huge sandwich and handkerchief]
ROB REINER
We take his goo! It's as simple as that people. [takes a bite and wipes forehead, then walks over near Tom Cruise]
TOM CRUISE
Rob Reiner has been telling me about the goo that is inside every person on earth.
ROB REINER
Any goo can be harvested from a person's body, and easily placed into another. [wipes forehead, holds up his hand, but speaks to himself]
CARTMAN
Wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money?
TOM CRUISE
No Jen, we've all got enough money.
JENNIFER LOPEZ
Yes, who needs more money, we need to get Muhammad's goo! Yes, yes, ariva ariva!
CARTMAN
Uh, excuse us for a second... [walks away]
[Cartman enters an empty room and closes the door]
CARTMAN
Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing?
JENNIFER LOPEZ
What am I doing? Just having some fun, cholo!
CARTMAN
Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money!
JENNIFER LOPEZ
Just keep your mouth shut, and do what I tell you!
CARTMAN
If we are staying here, then I want to know what is going on. Don't forget, I know who you really are... [looks at his hand, then removes his hand's hairpiece] Mitch Conner.
MITCH CONNER
If you know what's good for you, you'd keep your mouth shut, kid.
CARTMAN
You're a no-good swindler and a too-good thief. We were here for money, not goo!
MITCH CONNER
Think about it. Muhammad is the only person in the world who can't get ripped on. Those celebrities want his goo.
CARTMAN
Yeah, so what?
MITCH CONNER
You know what the goo is worth on the open market? Hell, I got people in Hong Kong who'll give me 50 mil for that goo.
CARTMAN
So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves.
MITCH CONNER
You catch on quick kid... [knock at the door]
TOM CRUISE
[from the other side of the door] Mrs. Lopez...
MITCH CONNER
Hurry, get my wig back on! [Tom opens the door]
TOM CRUISE
Hey, I was just seeing if you needed some- Oh, god [scratches the back of his head guiltily] you found my fudge packing uniform...
JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh, yes, your secret is safe with me, Tommy!
[Outside South Park Town Hall, several townspeople are standing around]
RANDY
Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you. You really did bring us Muhammad.
MAYOR
Thank you so much for coming, Muhammad. [steps forward toward Muhammad, who is in a giant U-Haul]
MUHAMMAD
[in a small voice] Welcome.
MR GARRISON
Oh, is that okay?
JIMBO
I don't know.
RANDY
Alright, now we just need to figure out how to get Muhammad from the back of the truck into Tom Cruise's limo.
STAN
What? No, Dad, we promised that Muhammad would stay in the truck.
GERALD
Cruise's lawyers were very specific boys. He's sending a limo for Muhammad to meet him outside of town.
KYLE
But Muhammad can't be seen, Dad.
SGT. YATES
Alright, we'll put a sheet over him.
STAN
No, you can't even show his feet.
SHEILA
How about a Halloween costume with one of those plastic masks?
MR. GARRISON
No, you could still see his eyes...
RANDY
Okay. How 'bout like... like a big mascot outfit? One that covered him completely, head to toe, not even showing his eyes? [Mayor walks over to U-Haul and shouts inside]
MAYOR
Muhammad, would that be okay?
MUHAMMAD
[still small voice] Okay.
[Tom Cruise's Lodge]
HILLARY CLINTON
Tom, Rob, we've just received word from the lawyers. South Park is saying they have Muhammad for us! [celebrities gasp]
TOM CRUISE
Rob, will the machine be ready?
ROB REINER
Oh, it'll be ready! [hits buttons on the machine's control panel]
JENNIFER LOPEZ
[out of view] More tacos!
JENNIFER LOPEZ
[in-view, the celebrities all turn around to look] I want more tacos!
CARTMAN
No! No more tacos Mrs. Lopez.
JENNIFER LOPEZ
More tacos.
CARTMAN
You just had seven tacos.
JENNIFER LOPEZ
I want more tacos! [Cartman gives a nervous laugh]
CARTMAN
I'm sorry. [whisper] Why are you doing this?
JENNIFER LOPEZ
I am Jennifer Lopez, I need tacos to live!
CARTMAN
[whispering] You know goddamn well you're not really Jennifer Lopez, now stop pissing me off! [Charlie Sheen steps forward]
CHARLIE SHEEN
Mrs. Lopez, I can go. What do you want, like three tacos?
JENNIFER LOPEZ
Oh, thank you 'harlie Sheeeeen. And maybe an enchirito too?
CARTMAN
Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore!
JENNIFER LOPEZ
Yes they do!
CARTMAN
No, I tried getting one last week!
JENNIFER LOPEZ
Not all Taco Bells have enchiritos, but some still carry them.
CARTMAN
God, will somebody shut her up?
[South Park Town Square, several people still standing around when a limo pulls up]
RANDY
[facing away from view] Alright, the limo's here. Muhammad, thanks again for doing this. [A giant bear costume has been thrown over Muhammad]
MAYOR
You've done this town a huge favor, Muhammad. [walks towards the limo]
MR. GARRISON
[from a distance away] Hold on a second! [runs over to the mayor]
MR. GARRISON
Stop! There's some extremists, threatening that if we give Muhammad to the celebrities, they're gonna bomb us!
MAYOR
What?!
RANDY
Aw. Aw, it's just a stupid threat! Come on, we don't wanna piss off Tom Cruise again. [starts walking to the limo]
[Jared Fogle and Phil Collins sit in the limo]
JARED FOGLE
[On a walkie-talkie] Alright, we got him, Tom. [Everyone outside walks toward the limo, when it suddenly explodes]
STAN
Muhammad, are you okay? [Runs toward Muhammad and helps him up]
RANDY
What the hell was that?!
SGT. YATES
Obviously, the terrorists are for real! [notices a paper Garrison is holding] What does that paper say? [reads the paper aloud] We have placed bombs all over your city. You will give Muhammad to us. The celebrities want Muhammad for his power not to be ridiculed. We want that power... huzzah.
STAN
They want his power?
KYLE
What kind of extremists are these? [Yates looks over the note]
SGT. YATES
You won't believe it...
[The Hilton hotel's party room, which is full of red headed people, or gingers.]
LEAD GINGER
Our time is near! Soon, gingers will never be made fun of again!
ALL GINGERS
[in unison] Huzzah!
[Cartman walking down a street, keeping his hand away from himself. He has taken off Mitch Conner's fake hairpiece.]
MITCH CONNER
Where the hell do you think you're going?
CARTMAN
I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time. [Mitch goes in front of Cartman]
MITCH CONNER
You gonna walk away from 50 mil? [Cartman stops]
CARTMAN
Let me by...
MITCH CONNER
You walk away now, and you will regret it the rest of your life.
CARTMAN
Screw this Conner. [pushes his hand away and moves on] Find yourself another partner.
MITCH CONNER
Then I guess I won't tell you about your father. [Cartman stops]
CARTMAN
My father...
MITCH CONNER
Thought that might get your attention. You know nothing about your dad, right?
CARTMAN
I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father.
MITCH CONNER
You really still believe that garbage? The people in your town sold you that line. Come on, you've had to have doubted it all along. [Cartman turns around to face Conner]
CARTMAN
How could you know anything about who my family is?
MITCH CONNER
Heh. I know all about the swindles and schemes in this dead-end town. You got lied to, kid. By the people who were closest to you. I can prove it too, but I'm going to want something in return.
CARTMAN
If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, then you'd better-
MITCH
You just take me where I tell you, and when you learn the truth, you will learn to trust me. And nobody else...
[Chaos, people running around the street screaming]
BARBRADY
Okay, people, try to evacuate in an orderly fashion. Geez.
[Mayors Office, McDaniels is pacing while the police stand around her]
SGT. YATES
Mayor, we do not have the resources to deal with this situation! A full evacuation is impossible!
MAYOR
Jesus, what are we supposed to do?!
JIMBO
We have to give in to their demands.
MCDANIELS
I'm sorry, Muhammad, but we are going to have to give you over to the gingers.
KYLE
We can't give him over to the gingers!
STAN
Yeah, we said we'd take care of him.
GERALD
But our homes and our lives are at stake.
STAN
We made a promise... to Jesus! [Randy steps forward]
RANDY
Stan, Jesus doesn't matter when Muhammad is involved. [phone rings, everyone turns to look at it]
JIMBO
That'll be Tom Cruise... [Randy steps forward and slowly picks it up]
RANDY
Helllo?
TOM CRUISE
Yeah, so what's going on?
RANDY
Uh... I'm afraid we can't... well, we can't give Muhammad to you.
TOM CRUISE
What do you mean, you're not givin' him to us?!
RANDY
There are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we don't give Muhammad to them, they're gonna bomb us.
TOM CRUISE
Gingers?
KANYE WEST
Gingers? Aww, hell no.
RANDY
Please, understand that we have no choice here Mr. Cruise.
TOM CRUISE
You're going to give Muhammad to gingers instead of us, just because they are threatening you with violence?
RANDY
Well, yeah.
TOM CRUISE
Oh, we can play that game too! You want to see violence, well you got it! [throws the phone at the ground and walks away]
TOM CRUISE
[pacing around and fuming] Goddamn stupid assholes! You want to play rough?! OK! Spielburg, go and get some automatic rifles! We'll go in there, and we're going to take [around here, he jumps up and down on the couch, shouting his idea, with Oprah on the other cushion] Muhammad by force! And then we are going to show them th- [Rob Reiner rushes up]
ROB REINER
Tom, Tom. We can't be seen getting violent.
HILLARY CLINTON
Yeah, that would kill all our careers!
TOM CRUISE
[still jumping up and down on the couch] But the only way we are going to get Muhammad from South Park now is by getting just as violent as the gingers!
ROB REINER
Fine, then let's have Her do it.
TOM CRUISE
[stops jumping] Her who?
ROB REINER
[whisper] You know... Her.
TOM CRUISE
Oh right... [Whispers] Her.
[In the middle of nowhere, limos start pulling up and celebrities all walk up to a huge structure]
ROB REINER
There she is Tom... Barbra Streisand.
[Zooms around Mecha-Streisand, showing her from every angle]
ROBERT REDFORD
My God, she's even more terrifying than I remember.
STEVEN SPIELBERG
Tom, Barbra Streisand hasn't been active for a long time. Are we sure we want to do this?
TOM CRUISE
Mrs. Streisand got torn apart in the town of South Park. She's probably more angry at that town than any of us.
ROB REINER
Power her up! Release the Kraken! [Mel Gibson places the Diamond of Pantheos in the system, then flips a switch, starting up Mecha-Streisand]
[Mecha-Streisand opens up her eyes, the Diamond on her forehead lights up, and her claws and arm saw are flexed. The gates open and she steps out to meet the celebrities. The song Barbra, Barbra is played. She kneels down and lets out a screech.]
JAPANESE SINGER
[Singing] Baabura, Baabura, ichi ban kirai na hito. (The number 1 hateful person.) Baabura, Baabura, hana ga ookii. (Her nose is big.)
ROB REINER
[extremely casual voice] Hey Barbra. It's me, Rob Reiner. [Barbra kneels down and blows steam out of her nose, the celebrities shield their faces]
ROB REINER
Listen, Babs, we are taking on the town of South Park and we really need your help
TOM CRUISE
We figured you're pissed at South Park too, right Mrs. Streisand? [Barbra roars, turns around, and slashes the holding tower with her arm saw]
TOM CRUISE
Oh, she's pissed all right.
[Someone's house, there is a knock at the door. The door opens, and Eric is standing outside.]
MR. GARRISON
Eric, what are you doing here?
CARTMAN
Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father?
MR. GARRISON
What? N-No Eric, are you still worried about that old issue, I mean-
CARTMAN
I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat.
MR. GARRISON
Eric, I haven't used Mr. Hat in a long time, and-
CARTMAN
I said GET. Mr. Hat!
[Garrison's bedroom. He reaches into a drawer and pulls out Mr. Hat.]
CARTMAN
Put it on! [he puts it on] Do the voice.
MR. HAT
Hello kids, it's me, Mr. Hat. [Cartman pulls his hand from behind his back, revealing Mitch.]
MITCH CONNER
Good to see you Hat. Helluva night, isn't it?
MR. HAT
I... I don't believe I know you.
MITCH CONNER
The name's Mitch Conner, flew the same division as you back in Saigon. [Mr. Garrison lowers Mr. Hat]
MR. GARRISON
Eric, this is silly, why don't we just stop-
CARTMAN
Keep... your hand... UP!
[A street filled with lots of townspeople, Muhammad, and Stan]
RANDY
[shouting to the other side of the street] Alright gingers, we have Muhammad for you, now hand over the detonators. [huge group of gingers, all holding detonators]
LEAD GINGER
Nuh uh, first you gotta prove that's still Muhammad in there! Have him step out of the bear costume...
TOWNSPEOPLE
Ohhhhhhh...
STAN
Dude, we can't do that
LEAD GINGER
Show us it's Muhammad or South Park is finished!
[Back to Mr. Garrison's bedroom]
MR. HAT
Dammit, Mitch, you're asking questions that shouldn't be answered!
MITCH CONNER
So you admit it. There was a cover up. [Mr. Garrison turns away]
MR. GARRISON
No, Mr. Hat, don't say anymore!
MITCH
Yeah, tell 'im whatcha know!
GARRISON
Alright, Eric, your father was in the room the day of your DNA test, but the results were... tampered with.
CARTMAN
By who? Goddammit, Garrison, who is my father?
[Flash to townspeople on the street, then flash to gingers on the street then flash to Mecha-Streisand roaring]
End of 200


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:Angry celebrities, violent ginger kids, and Mecha Streisand are about to destroy South Park and all anyone wants to know is, "Who is Eric Cartman's father?"

script:201

[Saigon, 1972, day. U.S. Army helicopters fly overhead. A gunner fires into the fields below]
MITCH CONNER
Saigon. It's a hell of a place. I've seen a lot of death. [Vietnamese and American soldiers fire at each other] A lot of suffering. Darkness that most people couldn't stand to see. [Wounded American soldiers are carried back to the helicopters] I tried to sit it out as much as I could. [a left arm exactly like Cartman's is shown. It wears dog tags, a tiny helmet, and camouflage face paint]
SOLDIER 1
What's the matter, Conner? You don't like a little blood?
MITCH CONNER
No, I don't like a little blood. Blood ain't the stuff for eighteen year old boys from Sheboygan. Blood ain't the stuff... for Mitch Conner.
SOLDIER 2
Incoming! [An RPG flies into the helicopter and blows up. Cut to a MASH unit, where Mitch opens his eyes]
ARMY DOCTOR
Conner, Mitchell. You're discharged, son.
MITCH CONNER
And that's that. "Pack your bags, you're headed home. Hugs and kisses from Uncle Sam." [cut to the present, where Mitch is now on Cartman's arm facing Mr. Garrison and Mr. Hat.] So how do I end up here, with a nine year old kid who just wants to know who his father is? Life is funny like that. One day you're sifting through the guts of some gook in Vietnam and the next you're playing Dr. Phil with some kid and his teacher.
MR. GARRISON
Eric, I, [faces Cartman] I'm really sorry that you were put through all this.
MITCH CONNER
Sorry is a four letter word with a Y on the end. That doesn't mean anything to this poor kid.
CARTMAN
That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!
MR. GARRISON
[turns away] All I can tell you, Eric, is that we were all told to stick to the story to protect someone very important. I can't say more, I won't. But I'll... I'll tell you who has the answer.
[South Park. night. The townsfolk and the gingers face off.]
RANDY
Look, gingers! You said you wanted Muhammad, we got him for you.
GINGER 1
We have no way of knowing if Muhammad is really in there. It could be a trick.
STAN
It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here!
GINGER 1
Then have him step out of the bear costume! You have until the count of ten! One!
JIMBO
Don't do it, Randy. If Muhammad is seen, we could get bombed.
GINGER 1
Two!
SGT. YATES
Idiot, if he isn't seen, we're about to definitely get bombed.
GINGER 1
Three!
RANDY
Alright, alright, stop! We'll do what you say. [turns to the bear] I'm sorry, Muhammad, but... will you please step out of the bear costume? [the bear looks around, then unzips the costume. A familiar red suit and black belt appear. The arms flail a bit and the costume drops away. Santa has stepped out of the costume.]
STAN
Okay, so um, see? This is Muhammad.
GINGER 2
That isn't Muhammad, that's Santy Claus.
SANTA
Sorry, boys. I tried.
KYLE
Aw crap.
RANDY
Boys, you got Santa to be Muhammad? When?
STAN
When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul!
MR. HANKEY
[hops up to Kyle] I'm sorry, Kyle. I really thought my idea would work for you.
STAN
If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?!
GINGER 1
So where is he?! [heavy footfalls and a mechanical roar are heard, and everyone gets afraid.]
[Hall of Super Best Friends, night.]
ANNOUNCER
Meanwhile, at the Hall of the Super Best Friends...
[Inside. Buddha is snorting coke again.]
JESUS
Buddha, will you lay off that stuff already?! It's gettin' to be a problem.
BUDDHA
Ohhh, and you're one to talk! With all your Internet porn!
JESUS
Watching porn isn't like doing coke, fag!
JOSEPH SMITH
[runs into the meeting room] Jesus Christ!
JESUS
What?
JOSEPH SMITH
We've got a distress signal coming in. [the Super Best Friends leave their seats and head for the towering screen at one end of the room]
JESUS
On the Super Best Screen!
POLICE OFFICER
Super Best Friends! You've got to help us! The Casa Bonita is under attack! [Casa Bonita is shown. Soldiers defend it by firing at Mecha-Streisand, but she just keeps walking towards it]
JESUS
Great Scott! It's Barbra Streisand! [Mecha-Streisand picks up a car and bites the front end off. The driver drops down from it, likely to his death]
LAO TSE
I thought Barbra Streisand had been destroyed by Robert Smith.
SEAMAN
Yeah. Who would have activated her again?
JESUS
I don't know, Seaman. [the other Super Best Friends chuckle]
SEAMAN
[annoyed] It's Sea-Man! [the other Super Best Friends chuckle, but their attention is again drawn to the screen. ]
POLICE OFFICER
The Casa Bonita is gone! Jesus help us!
JESUS
Jesus... That's where the boys took Muhammad. We have to stop her! [he leads the others to Docking Bay Alpha] On the Super Best Friends power cycles! [moments later, amid a cloud of steam, a platform rises, and the Super Best Friends roll off it on modified Segways.]
[South Park Genetic Engineering - Dr. Mephesto's lab. Dr. Mephesto is inside working on an animal.]
DR. MEPHESTO
There there, my little mouse friend. Soon you will have more asses than you ever dreamed of. [the top of his assistant's head is shown moving towards him] Ah, Kevin. You brought me my Fonseca. That's a good boy. [a pounding is heard at the door and both men turn around] What's this? Someone is at the door, Kevin. [the pounding is heard again] We tried to be left alone, Kevin. Who would disturb us at this hour? We must be careful. [looks through the peep hole] Why, it's an African-American man, Kevin. [to the person outside] Yes? What do you want?
PERSON
[Mitch Conner, in blackface, wearing a wig] Yo man, sorry to bother you, but there's been an accident down the street, man. Can I use your telephone?
DR. MEPHESTO
Oh I'm... terribly sorry, but I don't let strangers in.
PERSON
Yo, I understand, man, but this accident is real bad, dawg. My lady's leg is all busted up and shit; she all crawlin' around on the road lookin' like a crippled crab, man. I just need an ambulance, dog!
DR. MEPHESTO
There's a gas station about half a mile down the road. They have a phone there.
PERSON
Okay, I see. I guess I understand. You just don't wanna let a black man in yo' house.
DR. MEPHESTO
No, please, it isn't that at all.
PERSON
No, I gets it man. Thought things had changed, dog. Thought when we got a black president, things would be different. We gots our black president, but Whitey still don't trust me to use his motherfuckin' phone.
DR. MEPHESTO
No wait, I'm sorry, you're right you're right, we do have a black president. Please, come in. [opens the door, which is built like that of a bank vault]
CARTMAN
[quickly gets in] Ahaaa!
DR. MEPHESTO
WAAH!
KEVIN
AAAH!
CARTMAN
Nice work, Conner.
MITCH CONNER
Yeah, the old "Hasn't anything changed?" speech. Works on white people all the time.
DR. MEPHESTO
Eric Cartman?
CARTMAN
Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door!
[South Park, night. Mecha-Streisand rounds a corner as the townsfolk run away from her]
SANTA
[in the crowd] Holy crap! [as the crowd disappears, one lone boy walks towards the robot...]
PIP
Cheeri-o! My name is Pip. I would like to see if you wouldn't mind not smashing our little town to bits. [the robot walks towards him and he turns and runs] Haaah! [Mecha-Streisand crushes him under her left foot]
[Tom Cruise's mansion, night.]
ANNOUNCER
Meanwhile, at the Legion of Doom, which is Tom Cruise's house...
TOM CRUISE
How do you like that?! Celebrities can get violent too!
RANDY
[on the community center roof with other townsfolk] Mr. Cruise, please call Barbra Streisand off! [everyone cringes as Mecha-Streisand walks around] She's destroying everything!
TOM CRUISE
We will call her off when you give us Muhammad!
RANDY
We don't have Muhammad. We aren't sure where he is.
TOM CRUISE
That's your problem! Get him back or Babs will kill you all!
MICKEY MOUSE
Oh boy!
[South Park, night. The crowd runs down the street. Stan and Kyle see Kenny between two buildings and run up to him]
STAN
Kenny! Kenny! Dude, what the hell?! You're supposed to be watching Muhammad!
KENNY
(I am. He's right here.) [a locker to his left opens up and Muhammad steps out, a black rectangle with "CENSORED" on it covering him up]
STAN
Oh thank God. Hey Muhammad.
KYLE
Really sorry about all this, dude. [to Stan] So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here.
STAN
The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.
KYLE
[thinks a bit, then snaps his fingers] Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it!
KENNY
(What?)
KYLE
Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig?
STAN
[a bit surprised] ...Yeah.
KYLE
I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on! [they all run off]
[Raisins, night. Mecha-Streisand's right foot is on the parking lot next to an overturned car. Her left foot comes down on the restaurant and everyone inside runs out. She then moves on to Country Kitchen buffet and crushes that under her right foot. All the elderly folk get out of there right before it's destroyed.]
RICHARD TWEEK
She's going to get our coffee store next.
MR. SLAVE
Ooooo, Jesus Christ. [points to behind the camera. The Super Best Friends roll into town on their cycles]
JESUS
That's enough, Barbra Streisand! Kiwaaa! [takes off his halo and hurls it at her. It bounces off her left shoulder and returns to Jesus. Barbra just gets more pissed off and turns to face Jesus. She walks towards him] Smith! Try your ice breath! [Joseph Smith steps forward and blows a stream of freezing air at Barbra's left claw. She looks at it and flexes her claws]
JOSEPH SMITH
No good!
SEAMAN
Look out! Barbra Streisand is using her toxic stink ray! [Barbra unleashes a stream of brown gas from her genital area, making the Super Best Friends cough]
[Dr. Mephesto's lab, later]
DR. MEPHESTO
Eric, your father never wanted this to happen. He was protecting you as well as them.
CARTMAN
Them who?!
DR. MEPHESTO
Eric, you have to understand, it's all very complicated.
CARTMAN
Then start explaining it to me!
DR. MEPHESTO
[heavy sigh] Very well.
KYLE
Come on, Muhammad, the door is open.
STAN
Dr. Mephesto, we need your help!
DR. MEPHESTO
Oh for crying out loud, now everyone is letting themselves in! [goes to the door and locks it]
KYLE
Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand.
DR. MEPHESTO
Oh, all right.
CARTMAN
No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is!
STAN
Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!
CARTMAN
It's all that matters!
KYLE
Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!
CARTMAN
I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is!
[South Park, night. Joseph Smith has taken flight]
ANNOUNCER
In the small mountain town of South Park, the holy prophet of the Mormon religion is trying to fly up the nose of a deadly female singer. [Barbra Streisand looks around. Krishna and Seaman float by either side of her head. Smith lands on her nose, but she tries to shake him off]
SEAMAN
Our powers aren't working, Swallow. [The Super Best Friends float down towards Jesus]
JOSEPH SMITH
We can't attack Streisand's nose! It's just too big!
JESUS
We have to find another weak spot! [into his cuff] Moses!
MOSES
What?
JESUS
We need to know any weakness Barbra Streisand might have!
MOSES
Um... Let me think... Um... Oh I know... Barbra Streisand can't resist singing duets with Neil Diamond.
JESUS
All right. I'll build a stage. Lao Tse, use mind control to get a huge audience. Buddha and Smith, use powers to find a band. Seaman, [chuckles] you and Swallow go get us sushi for dinner. [the other Super Best Friends start chuckling]
SEAMAN
It's Sea-Man and Swallow.
JESUS
Okay, Seaman, you guys head off!
SEAMAN
Fine! Swallow, come. [the other Super Best Friends chuckle]
MOSES
Heh heh heheheh. No way he just said that.
[Dr. Mephesto's lab]
STAN
Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad.
DR. MEPHESTO
It's a complicated story. I just can't tell him quickly.
KYLE
Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now!
MITCH CONNER
Is Muhammad more important than a little boy's broken heart?
KYLE
Oh, you are not doing that again!
MITCH CONNER
Look, Mephesto, just tell this kid who his father is and you do it now!
KYLE
Stop talking with your stupid hand!
CARTMAN
Who you calling stupid, Jew?
STAN
Come on, guys, we're running out of time! [more knocking is heard at Mephesto's door, and Mephesto turns around]
DR. MEPHESTO
Yes?
MAN
Hey, I'm sorry to bother you. There's uh, been an accident and I need a phone.
DR. MEPHESTO
Yeah, right, let me guess: You're an African-American.
MAN
...Well, yes I am, but I don't know what that has to do with anything.
DR. MEPHESTO
Beat it I'm not helpin' you!
KYLE
Dude!
STAN
That's not cool!
DR. MEPHESTO
No no, you don't understand.
KYLE
We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist!
STAN
We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know! We have a black president!
DR. MEPHESTO
Alright, alright, jeez. [walks to the door and opens it]
GINGER 1
Hahaaa!
STAN
Oh crap, the gingers!
CARTMAN
Gingers? No!
[Tom Cruise's mansion]
ANNOUNCER
L-later, at the Legion of Doom.
BENEDICT XVI
Tom, Tom! The gingers are claiming they have Muhammad!
TOM CRUISE
What?! Impossible!
BENEDICT XVI
They are sending a message now!
TOM CRUISE
On screen! [The Legion of Doom's monitor lights up and the gingers are shown with Muhammad. The lead ginger gives the Legion a raspberry.]
GINGER 1
[taunting] We got Muhammad! We got Muhammad!
ROB REINER
He's useless to you! You can't get Muhammad's power to not be made fun of without the Rob Reiner Goo Transfer Machine!
GINGER 1
Why do you think we're calling?!
GINGER 3
Our boss is willing to share Muhammad with you if you're willing to share the goo machine with us!
TOM CRUISE
...Your ...boss?
[The gingers' lair]
DR. MEPHESTO
What's going on? You got what you wanted, gingers, so let us go.
GINGER 1
Oh no no! The head ginger has plans for you!
STAN
What head ginger?! And where's Cartman?!
GINGER 2
Heheh, the head ginger has somethin' reeeally special planned for him.
[The gingers' lair, deeper inside. Cartman walks through the cave with a flashlight.]
CARTMAN
Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I?
MITCH CONNER
You really got yourself in a mess this time, kid.
CARTMAN
Shut up, Conner! How about I shove this flashlight in your mouth?
MITCH CONNER
You might wanna [garbled sounds as Cartman puts the flashlight in his left hand]
CARTMAN
Hello? I'm here, whoever you are. [a slow cackle rises from the darkness]
A VOICE
Eric Cartman. I've waited a long time for this.
CARTMAN
Daddy?
A VOICE
Guess again. [lights go one a few at a time. Carnival rides begin to appear. The Bean Dip Ferris Wheel. Chili-buster. The Chiliblast. A Hot Chili sign. A Professor Habanero chili booth. More signs come on, and the 2010 Chili Con Carnival is now live. Cartman is awed] Welcome, to my Chili Con Carnival.
CARTMAN
[strokes his chin and thinks] Chili Con Carnival? ...Wait a minute. ...No it can't be.
A VOICE
Oh, but it can. [Cartman is looking at a throne with a staircase at its base. Six gingers stand guard on the ground and halfway up the steps. Around and behind the steps is a pile of broken baby dolls highlighted by two torches. one on either side of the stairs. The torches are topped with baby doll heads. On the throne itself sits one Scott Tenorman, with top hat and cane. His head is in the shadows] Revenge is a dish best served... [leans forward into the light] chili.
CARTMAN
Scott Tenorman. Eeewww.
[South Park, night. "Live! Tonight Only! NEIL DIAMOND"]
ANNOUNCER
Meanwhile, at the concert stage Jesus built with his power of super-carpentry...
JOSEPH SMITH
[walks in with Buddha and Lao Tse] That's it, Jesus. The band has been paid and the PA system is working.
JESUS
[joins them and drops his hammer] Alright Krishna, the rest is up to you.
KRISHNA
[walks some distance] Form of... Neil Diamond. [poof! He is now Neil Diamond, who then goes on stage and addresses the crowd] If you all wouldn't mind, I'd like to invite a special friend to join me on stage. Miss Barbra Streisand! [Barbra hears her name and walks towards the stage]
JESUS
Let's hope to Christ this works. [Barbra reaches the stage and lowers her head to Neil - er, Krishna]
KRISHNA
Hello gorgeous. What do you say? Shall we sing together again like the old times?
[Barbra roars and sits down on stage]
Well that's because I love the girl.
And I still love you now. What have you got to say?
[Barbra roars, then the crowd roars]
That might be true, but I still miss ya at night.
[Barbra roars something]
When you roll over, by my side, and you kiss me goodnight.
[This excites Barbra, who roars and lets out a jet of toxic spray onto the audience. The audience members cough and try to shield themselves]
JOSEPH SMITH
It worked, Jesus!
JESUS
Yeah. And now to find Muhammad and take down Tom Cruise!
[Scott Tenorman's' lair]
SCOTT TENORMAN
Do you remember when you had my parents killed and fed them to me as chili? I spent quite a while in a mental institution, Eric. [two ginger kids come and escort Cartman towards a ride] A lot of time for me to learn everything about you, so that one day I could take you down. I even learned the name of your father. [the two kids place Cartman in a car and sit on either side of him. The car begins to move. Screen 1] Oh, I know you're confused. Who wouldn't be? [Screen 2] You've been lied to by everyone! [Screen 3] Even by your own mother! [Screen 4] Hahahahahahahaha. [the car goes through some double doors]
CARTMAN
What do you know?!
SCOTT TENORMAN
[Screen 5] I wanted to torment you with your father's identity. But what I found was more shocking than I could have possibly guessed!
[The gingers' lair. The goo machine has been moved there and Muhammad has been strapped into the lefthand side of the machine. Tom Cruise has been strapped to the right side]
ANNOUNCER
[sounding more and more wasted] Meanwhile, at the gingers' lair...
RUSSELL CROWE
Alright, Muhammad is secure. [moves off the machine]
TOM CRUISE
Let's do this. Throw the switch, Rob. [Rob Reiner throws the switch. The power level increases on the control panel. Moments later, goo moves from Muhammad through four tubes towards a mixer, then through two tubes towards Tom Cruise. Everyone watches in anticipation] Ohhh. Uhhh. Yes! I can feel it! I can feel the power to not be ridiculed flowing through my veins! [shakes violently for a second, then the machine shuts down. A "CENSORED" bar appears over Tom] Ha. Hahahaha! [laughs heartily]
PARIS HILTON
O M G it worked!
TOM CRUISE
I've done it! I've done it! Look at me! I'm not okay to make fun of anymore!
BENEDICT XVI
Ooo you lucky fucker.
[Chili Con Carnival - Scott Tenorman's lair. Scott has brought in Stan, Kyle, and Kenny, some gingers, and some candidates from Dr. Mephesto's DNA inquiry into Cartman's dad. Dr. Mephesto and Kevin are there too. Scott is inside a center ring next to a table on which rests a bowl of chili. Cartman is on a chair facing the bowl. Only the gingers have their hands free. Everyone else has their hands tied behind their backs]
SCOTT TENORMAN
Welcome, everyone, to the final act of my fabulous Chili Carnival!
LIANE
Please, leave my boy alone!
CARTMAN
Mom?
SCOTT TENORMAN
I got them all here for you, Eric! So listen while you got told the truth!
MR. GARRISON
Please don't. We have to protect 'em.
CARTMAN
Protect who??
SCOTT TENORMAN
Yes, protect... who? Tell him! Mr... [points to] Jimbo! [with his cane]
JIMBO
Protect... the Denver Broncos.
[The gingers' lair]
ANNOUNCER
Meanwhile...
TOM CRUISE
This is incredible. Who wants to go next?
BENEDICT XVI
I want to be next.
GINGER 4
No, gingers go next.
MICKEY MOUSE
Gingers can suck it! I'm next, ha!
ROB REINER
It's my goo machine! I'm next!
JESUS
Nobody is going next! [Jesus, Buddha, and Joseph Smith run in while Lao Tse and Seaman drop in from above.] Muhammad is our super best friend! Let him go!
GINGER 4
They can't stop all of us! Get 'em!
[The gingers and celebrities attack the super best friends as one. Joseph Smith blows his super breath on Sally Struthers, who freezes over.]
JESUS
[fends off every ginger who runs at him.] Kyaaaaa!
[Chili Con Carnival - Scott Tenorman's lair. Scott addresses the captives]
SCOTT TENORMAN
The Denver Broncos. [turns to Cartman] There was a right tackle, see? Who had an illegitimate child with your slut of a mom, and everyone here covered it up! To protect the Bronco name!
MR. GARRISON
They were having a really good year! There couldn't be any distractions!
CARTMAN
My dad was a Denver Bronco?
SCOTT TENORMAN
Would you like to meet him? Well, you can't. Ever. 'Cause you see, Eric, we have something in common. Did I ever tell you that my father... played for the Denver Broncos?
CARTMAN
No- nooo.
SCOTT TENORMAN
The only Bronco who lived in South Park. He got a little bored one week and had an affair with a slut named Liane Cartman!
LIANE
No please!
SCOTT TENORMAN
[to Dr. Mephesto] Tell him! You almost did before, but you got shot by your brother who was a Bronco fan! Tell him!
DR. MEPHESTO
It's true... Jack Tenorman was your father.
SCOTT TENORMAN
You killed your own father and then you fed him to your half... brother!
CARTMAN
No! Noooo!
SCOTT TENORMAN
Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Now eat your chili! [shoves Cartman's face into the chili, just as Cartman had done to him a long time ago. Cartman gags on the chili. A wall explodes and the captives and celebrities rush in, followed by the Super Best Friends] The Super Best Friends? Oh no! [makes a run out of the lair. Russell Crowe smacks Buddha a few times, but Buddha fights back]
SEAMAN
I'll get you, Tom Cruise! [hops on him and wrestles him]
STAN
Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back. [everyone stops and gasps. The "CENSORED" bar disappears and Tom is shown again]
TOM CRUISE
What did you say?!
KYLE
Oh, yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back.
JESUS
I guess maybe Tom Cruise likes Seaman. [everyone chuckles.]
TOM CRUISE
[straightens up] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! [Seaman gets off his back] You're not supposed to be able to make fun of me anymore! What the hell's going on?!
SCOTT TENORMAN
[on the rafters with a jet pack on his back] I'll be back, Super Best Friends! [tales off through an open door on the roof.]
JESUS
Who's the creepy ginger kid?
TOM CRUISE
Reiner, you said the goo machine would work! But I got made fun of!
KYLE
That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works.
JESUS
That's right. Don't you see, gingers? If you don't want to be made fun of anymore, all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop.
SANTA
That's right, friends. All you need to do is instill fear, and be willing to hurt people, and you can get whatever you want. The only true power is violence.
STAN
[smiles and tilts his head to one side] Yeah.
[South Park, day. Reconstruction on the town begins]
MAYOR MCDANIELS
Alright, people, let's start rebuilding our town! For the 39th time.
STAN
Oh, dude, look. [Cartman is shown on a gurney, crying. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny approach him] Hey, Cartman...
KYLE
Look, man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.
CARTMAN
Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means?
STAN
Yeah, dude, we, we know what it means.
CARTMAN
My dad was a ginger!
KYLE
Wwait, what?
CARTMAN
I mean, obviously, I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!
KYLE
Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?!
MITCH CONNER
[appears] Hey, Eric, Eric!
CARTMAN
What?
MITCH CONNER
Come on, cheer up.
CARTMAN
Cheer up? I'm half ginger!
MITCH CONNER
Yeah, but you're forgetting, you're also half Denver Bronco. That makes you pretty cool.
CARTMAN
Hey, you're right. That does make me pretty cool.
KYLE
You gotta be kidding me!
MITCH CONNER
Shut up, Kyle, you dumb Jew. [to Cartman] You've got Bronco blood in you, kid. That makes you awesome. Me? I should be movin' on.
CARTMAN
Really, Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go?
MITCH CONNER
There's a bounty on my head and I can't afford to stay in one place for too long. So long... Denver Bronco.
CARTMAN
Take it easy, Conner. [his hand floats away, then opens up all of a sudden. He wiggles his fingers. Next shot is of Tom Cruise sitting by himself on a trash can.]
STAN
Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that you had Seaman on your back.
TOM CRUISE
I just... can't do it anymore. I wanna go away. But there's nowhere on earth that people aren't around to rip on me.
KYLE
Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.
STAN
We do? Oh, oh, yeah, we do!
TOM CRUISE
You... really? Somewhere where I can just ...live out my days in peace and quiet and- Oh. [stands up] Oh, please, can you show me where?
STAN
We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there.
[The moon. Tom Cruise is shown laying next to Willzyx.]

Oh boy, Timmy, it's our favorite time of year.
TIMMY

SPECIALIST 2
[looks inside the towel cart] The towel isn't here. I think it's off getting high again.
[For the past week Towelie has
been working at a summer camp for handicapped children.
He has been given warnings
for getting high fourteen times.]
[Towelie is tying a rubber band around his upper right arm, preparing to inject himself]
SPECIALIST 3
[walks nearby looking for him] Hey! [startled, Towelie lets the rubber band snap off and fall to the ground] Where is that towel?!
TOWELIE
Oh yeah, just a sec. [the specialist sees him]
STAN
[in studio] We went out and got Towelie a job so he could try to pay us back all the money he owes us! [crosses his arms] Stupid towel!
SPECIALIST 3
[now next to Towelie] What's going on, Towel?
TOWELIE
Oh yeah I just had to take a piss. Sorry.
SPECIALIST 3
We got wet campers down there! Move your ass!
KYLE
[in studio] When Towelie is doing heroin, he doesn't care about anything.
TOWELIE

MIMSY
Duhh you always hated Jimmy, boss. Ever since he whooped you at soifin' last summer camp, he really took it to you good, haha.
NATHAN

MIMSY
Doh, sorry, boss.
NATHAN
Listen to me: there is no way that Blue Team is gonna beat Red Team this year at camp. You got that?
[Blue Team has beaten Red Team
the past three summers at Lake Tardicaca.
The three legged race is Blue
Team's best event.]
NATHAN
What we need to do, Mimsy, is use a little brainpower to make sure Blue Team can't compete.
MIMSY
Oh boy, we're gonna ruin Blue Team's chances, huh? We're gonna break their legs or somethin', boss?
NATHAN
[smacks him with a right hook and then shakes his fist] Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just do what I say, and we can make sure Jimmy Valmer gets what's comin' to him.
[Specialist 1 has applied Towelie to Lenora, and Towelie gets her dry.]
SPECIALIST 1
There you go, Lenora, all better now?
LENORA
Yes, thanks.
TOWELIE
That's right. When you go swimmin', don't forget to bring a... [throws up all over Lenora]
LENORA
Uhhh!
SPECIALIST 3
Who hired that towel? It can barely walk, let alone dry somebody off.
TOWELIE
[picking a fight] You think you're better than me? Huh?! You think you're fuckin' hot shit?!
STAN
[in studio] A lot of times, when Towelie shoots heroin he just... gets angry at everybody.
TOWELIE
You can all suck it! You're all, you're all a bunch of towels, that's what you are! [walks off in disgust]
BUTTERS
[in studio, sobbing] The thing is, Towelie was pretty happy before. He had a girlfriend he liked. [a picture of the couple is shown, but her face is blurry. The picture was taken at a restaurant booth] And then she got pregnant and had a little washcloth. [A picture of the three of them at the hospital. She shows off Washcloth, but her face is still blurry] Mm but then Towelie just kept gettin' more and more high, and he got kicked out of the house.
TOWELIE
[wasted. wandering in the woods] Fuck you! Let me talk to 'im! Let me talk to 'im, you bitch!
[Towelie is attempting to talk
to his son.
His ex-wife will not let her son
talk to Towelie when he is high.]
TOWELIE
No! I'm not high! I haven't been high since Wednesday! [the anger leaves his face] Oh. Oh it is Wednesday?
[Camp Tardicaca, day. One of the specialists stands next to an event scoreboard with ten events listed]
SPECIALIST 1
[over the megaphone] All right, campers! Our first event is the big canoe race!
"PETE PUMA"
Oh boy, the canoe races! Heeee! [the team turns right and walks away]
"PORKY PIG"
We gotta be uh bitty bitty uh we uh we gotta be we gotta be uh we gotta bibbity beat the Red Team. [turns and walks off with the others. Nearby, Nathan and Mimsy listen in again]
NATHAN
I've got it, Mimsy. I got a way to win the race and get rid of Jimmy for good.
MIMSY
Darrr, oh boy, what are we gonna do, boss?
NATHAN
Simple, Mimsy. [pulls out a bag with something in it] We're gonna put a little surprise in the canoe.
MIMSY
Doh, dohhh, what kind of surprise uh? [Nathan pulls a snake out of the bag by its head] Oh! It's a snake.
NATHAN
Not just any snake, Mimsy. It's a Black Mamba.
[The Black Mamba is the deadliest
snake known to man.
The odds of surviving a Black Mamba in your canoe
are 546 to 1.]
MIMSY
Aww, dah, gee whiz boss, we're gonna kill all the Blue Team and Jimmy, huh? [Nathan shushes him]
SPECIALIST 4
You boys excited for the canoe race?
NATHAN
Yes, counselor Steve. I like the fun canoe.
SPECIALIST 4
[encouraged] Canoes are fun, aren't they? [walks away]
NATHAN
[now that the counselor is gone...] Now take the Black Mamba, [hands the bag to Mimsy] Mimsy, and put it in the canoe. I'm gonna go get our team ready.
[The teams have sat down inside their canoes]
SPECIALIST 1
All right, campers are we ready?
ALL
Yeah!
NATHAN
Good luck, Jimmy.
JIMMY
You too, Ne-n-Nathan.
NATHAN
You're gonna need it, you fuckin' asshole.
SPECIALIST 1
Oh your mark, get set. [another specialist shoots off her gun, and both boats take off. Nathan switches his oar to his right side, but notices something on the floor: the Black Mamba Mimsy was to put in the other canoe.]
NATHAN
Aaah! Holy shit, Mimsy! What the hell did you do?!
MIMSY
Darrr, you said to put the Black Mamba in the canoe, boss.
NATHAN
[shakes his fist] Not in our canoe, Mimsy!
[Mimsy has put the Black Mamba
snake in the wrong canoe.
The odds of the Red Team winning the canoe race
are now 1 in 19.]
[Nathan's crew begins to bail on him, allowing the Blue Team to win this event]
"SYLVESTER"
We crossth the finish line firsht!
[Lake Tardicaca. Steve rushes to a supply shack to get Towelie]
STEVE
[tries to open the door, but finds it locked] Heeey. Hey, we need a towel! [pounds on the door]
TOWELIE
Uh, oh, um, uh, just a sec!
STEVE
Not just a sec! We've got a whole lot of wet campers down there! [tries to get the door open by throwing himself at it a few times] What's going on?! [kicks the door in and is instantly shocked at what he sees: Towelie on his knees in front of an elderly man who's pulling up his pants]
[Towelie makes extra money
for drugs by offering oral
sex to older men.]
[The man rushes out of the shack while the specialist remains speechless]
TOWELIE
Hey, you owe me money, asshole!
[The camp office, later.]
SPECIALIST 1
That's it, we're done! You are no longer employed here!
KYLE
Please, sir.
SPECIALIST 1
We need a nice, clean towel here at summer camp. We don't need a towel that shoots heroin and has sex for money!
TOWELIE
Heh, some people are so picky about their towels.
[Lake Tardicaca, later.]
SPECIALIST 3
All right campers, next event is the big scavenger hunt! Blue Team is gonna go first. [Nathan and Mimsy stand nearby, overhearing the specialist]
NATHAN
I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can kill Jimmy and beat the Blue Team.
MIMSY
Oh boy, what are we gonna do to him, huh boss?
NATHAN
Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Native Americans. [reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a map] Here, take this. [Mimsy takes it and opens it up] It's a fake scavenger hunt map.
MIMSY
Dahhh, this map leads to the scavenger hunt?
NATHAN
No, that map leads to the Indian reservation. We switch this with Blue Team's scavenger hunting map, and they'll end up right on the Tardicaca Indian Reservation.
[The Tardicaca Indians are
extremely protective of their land.
Trespassing on the Tardicaca Reservation is considered
extremely dangerous.]
MIMSY
Dah-oh boy! We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Indians, huh boss? [again Nathan shushes him as a specialist draws near to them]
COUNSELOR STEVE
Are you boys excited for the neat scavenger hunt?
NATHAN
Yes, Counselor Steve. I like a scavenger hunt. [Steve walks away] Alright Mimsy, now you take this map to the Indian Reservation, and you switch it with Blue Team's map. You got that, Mims? You switch the map! Switch! The map!
MIMSY
I got it, boss. Switch the map. Switch the map. [walks away]
[Lake Tardicaca, day. Nathan leads his team into the woods for scavenging.]
MIMSY
Dah how come we're scavenger huntin' now, boss?
NATHAN
Because, stupid, now that we have Blue Team's map we can get their scavenger prize too.
MIMSY
Dahhhoh boy!
[The boys find themselves in a clearing. Nathan takes a look around]
NATHAN
This doesn't make sense. Why would they make us walk this far? We're handicapped. "Turn left at the..." Wait. Waitaminute, what? What the? [finds his way onto the Tardicaca Burial Grounds] Oh fuck! Mimsy! This is the map to the Indian Reservation!
MIMSY
Why sure it is, boss.
NATHAN
I told you to switch this with the map for the Blue Team!
MIMSY
No, you told me to switch the map, switch the map, so I switched it, and I switched it. [his motions indicate he just flipped the map this way and that]
NATHAN
Miiimmmssssyyyy! [all of a sudden, Indians appear on horseback.] Uh, my name is Nathan. I'm disabled. [the Indians fire at him and arrows go flying all over the place. He's struck a few times.] AAAAA!
[Intervention]
[Towelie is walking towards a Supply Max store]
TOWELIE:
Hey everybody. Let's all go to the office supply store. [inside he grabs as many bottles of computer duster as he can]
[Towelie has run out of money
for hard drugs.
He now inhales computer
duster to get high.]
CASHIER
You must have one dusty computer.
TOWELIE
[irritated] Fuck you! It's not illegal, bitch! [goes to his red car outside, gets in, and closes the door. Inside he takes out a bottle of computer duster and starts sniffing. He goes through bottle after bottle, screwing up his face more and more] I feel like I could conquer the world.
[Towelie now inhales up
to 2,000 cans of computer
duster a day.]
TOWELIE
[taking a short break from his sniffing] It's like I'm walkin' on sunshine.
BUTTERS
[in studio] I really think this intervention is Towelie's last chance. [at the Supply Max parking lot, walks up and kicks the door on Towelie's car] Towelie! Open the door!
TOWELIE
Go away! I'm walking on sunshine!
BUTTERS
Towelie, I gotta take you somewhere really important!
TOWELIE
Jus', just let me walk on the sunshine a little more. [Butters waits]
[Lake Tardicaca, day. The head specialist comes to announce some results]
SPECIALIST 1
[through the megaphone] All right! In the surfing competition, the Red Team is up three points to two. ["Elmer Fudd" puts his surfboard away] And now it's Jimmy Valmer's turn. [Jimmy goes out into the open water on his board]
TIMMY
Timmeh!
FRANCIS
Gee, I wish our team captain was as awesome as Jimmy. [The camera pans across the dock and on to Nathan and Mimsy]
NATHAN
I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can get rid of Jimmy once and for all.
MIMSY
Oh boy oh boy! What are we gonna do to him, boss?
NATHAN
Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy eaten by a shark. [pulls out a small box in which is a whistle. He opens the box and takes out the whistle, and hads it to Mimsy] Here, take this. [Mimsy takes it, and Nathan puts the box back in his back pocket] It's a shark-mating whistle.
MIMSY
Dahhh okay boss, a shark-mating whistle. We're gonna hit him over the head with it, huh boss?'
NATHAN
No, you moron. You go under the water and blow that whistle. You can attract sharks right as Jimmy starts to surf.
[The Tardicaca shark is the
deadliest freshwater shark in Colorado.
A shark mating whistle can attract the shark from over two miles away.
* Colorado Department of Wildlife]
MIMSY
Dahhh I've got it boss. I blow the whistle and make the shark come and bite Jimmy's legs off. [getting excited] Then he bleeds to death. He's gonna bleed to death. [Nathan shushes him again as Steve walks by]
STEVE
Are you boys enjoying the fun beach?
NATHAN
Yes, Counselor Steve. The beach is warm. [Steve walks off]
MIMSY
Gee that was a close one, huh boss? They almost had me saying we were gonna kill Jimmy.
NATHAN
[smacks him with a left hook and then shakes his fist] Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just swim in the water where Jimmy is, then blow that whistle.
MIMSY
Dohh boy! [walks away to complete his mission]
[On the lake, Jimmy is set to surf to shore. He waits for a wave. On the shore...]
"PETE PUMA"
Yeah I don't know, Timmy. Those waves are pretty big, heeeee.
TIMMY
Timmih.
"BEAKY BUZZARD"
Uhuhuh. Don't worry, Jimmy can handle himself.
JIMMY
Gonna catch a wave... [no wave is coming. Underwater, Mimsy swims by]
MIMSY
Dahhh I got me a shark whistle.
JIMMY
Oh boy, here it comes! Here it comes! [a wave rises high behind him and lifts him with it, then crashes down over and in front of him]
"DROOPY DAWG"
Oh no! Jimmy!
"ELMER FUDD"
Wait, look! He's doing it! [Jimmy rises to the top and the campers cheer. He's doing all the surfing moves. Meanwhile, Mimsy comes out of the water and walks up to Nathan.]
MIMSY
Dohoho, oh boy!
NATHAN
Mimsy, you didn't do wha' I told you.
MIMSY
Dahh whattaya mean, boss? You said to swim in the water and to blow the whistle. I swam in the water, so now I'm gonna blow the whistle. [blows hard into the whistle]
[Mimsy was supposed to blow
the shark whistle while still under the water.
There appears to have been a
fundamental misunderstanding.]
[Mimsy blows the whistle a few more times]
NATHAN
You fucking idiot! You don't blow a shark mating whistle on dry land! You were supposed to blow it- [a shark jumps out of the water, lands on him, and begins to hump him] eh uh uh...
[Mimsy's error has caused a Lake
Shark to come onto the beach and mate with Nathan.
The Tardicaca Lake Shark's penis is nine inches long.
* Colorado Department of Wildlife]
NATHAN
Mimsssyyy! Get this thing off of meee!
[Intervention day]
STAN
[in studio] Today is Towelie's intervention. We have ...no idea how he's gonna react.
BUTTERS
Um come on, Towelie, it's, it's right over here.
[Towelie thinks he is on
his way to the Laundromat.]
[Butters leads a battered and wasted Towelie to a door and opens the door. They walk into the room and see Clyde, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, and Stan, as well as a therapist, all waiting for them.]
TOWELIE
Wha' what's goin' on?
JEFF VAN VONDEREN
You wanna come over, have a seat with your friends? [Butters takes a seat between Kyle and Cartman, making space for Towelie to sit between him and Kyle. Towelie follows Butters to the sofa]
TOWELIE
What is everybody doing here?
JEFF VAN VONDEREN
We've all just been talking, Towelie, and and what I'm hearing is a bunch of people here who just love the heck outtaya. And, they're gonna way what they wanna say, and you're gonna say what you wanna say, and we're done. Okay?
BUTTERS
[reads from a note he wrote down earlier] Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect you in the following ways.
TOWELIE
Aw Jesus, man.
JEFF VAN VONDEREN
Ah ah Towelie, you need to let him finish.
BUTTERS
You're not the towel you used to be. [sniffles] Where, as you used to be fluffy and absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest amount of water. Will you get help today?
TOWELIE
I I don't, I don't get this.
JEFF VAN VONDEREN
Kyle?
KYLE
[reads from a note he wrote down earlier] Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men.
TOWELIE
Could we just end this please?
JEFF VAN VONDEREN
You have to let him finish, Towelie.
KYLE
If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself.
JEFF VAN VONDEREN
Alright. Eric, do you wanna go next?
CARTMAN
[reads his note] Kyle, I hate you so much. You are a liar and a swindler who would do anything for money, and I-.
KYLE
We're here for Towelie, fatass!
CARTMAN
I'm supposed to be allowed to finish, right? Is that right? [clears his throat] The Jews have been persecuted across the earth for good reason, Kyle. You are a race of beady-eyed thieves who are always wan- [Kyle walks over and rips the note from Cartman's hands]
KYLE
This is serious, you fucking asshole!
CARTMAN
I'm being serious, Kyle! Hello?!
JEFF VAN VONDEREN
Kyle, we have to let people be allowed to finish during interventions.
KYLE
But he's just using his time on television to rant about-
JEFF VAN VONDEREN
Kyle please, It is not your turn!
CARTMAN
[takes his note back. Kyle walks back to his seat] You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society. [puts down that sheet, but reaches into his back pocket for another one] Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to manipulate our minds today?
KYLE
Oh my God!
[Lake Tardicaca, night. Time for the Talent Show Competition! A Hawaiian song starts up. Jimmy is singing and playing ukulele]
JIMMY
It's a snap at Tardicaca Camp to learn to do the hula hula dance
I fell in love with a Tardicaca dove while doin' that funny funny dance.
And that poor little kid, why she never did know what love had in store.
So I made up my mind-
NATHAN
Get ready, Mimsy. Blue Team is about to go boom.
[Nathan and Mimsy stand in the shadows with their fingers in their ears]
[Red Team planted half a pound
of C4 in Jimmy's ukulele.
It is set to go off during the ukulele solo of
'Tardicaca Hula Gal']
JIMMY
So I made up my mind that I've just got to find the Tardicaca girl I did adore.
CAMPERS
Wawawawander...
JIMMY
Hurr a little Tardicaca...
CAMPERS
Hula...
JIMMY
She's a candy cane to wiggle
CAMPERS
Hula...
JIMMY
She's sure to make you g-giggle.
CAMPERS
Hula...
JIMMY
With her naughty little wiggle. I know someday
CAMPERS
Hula...
JIMMY
I'm gonna try to make that Tardicaca gally mine, gally mine.
'Cause all the while I'm dreaming of her. My Tardicaca Hola Gal!
[begins playing the solo, but hits a B, which is off] Oh sorry, that's not right. Hang on. [tries playing it again, but this time hits an A. Behind some trees, Nathan and Mimsy look on]
MIMSY
Dahh I don't think he's playing the right note, boss. The C4 aint gonna go off.
NATHAN
[smacks him with a right hook and then shakes his fist] Shut up, Mimsssyyy!
[Intervention. Cartman continues to speak and now has a pile of notes to his right about two feet tall, enough for twelve thick books]
CARTMAN
If in fact the Jews truly are shapeshifters, and I believe I've presented enough evidence here to prove that they are, then we must unite as a species to fight them and stop their plan of global domination and the control of our freedom. [puts the note on top of the pile and sits there quietly]
JEFF VAN VONDEREN
Okay, Stan, you want to go next?
STAN
[reads his note] Towelie, if you do not go to treatment, we will all ignore you forever. Will you go?
TOWEL
What treatment?! What are you all talkin' about?!
JEFF VAN VONDEREN
If you say yes, we leave here, pack your things, get on a plane, go to a treatment facility in Southern California, it's all set up.
TOWELIE
No! Fuck no! I'm not gettin' on, no fucking plane! This is bullshit! Don't give me fuckin' ultimatums! I thought you were my fuckin' friends.
JEFF VAN VONDEREN
Well Towelie, your friends don't wanna watch you kill yourself anymore.
TOWELIE
Then fuck them! You're tellin' me I have to do this? Uh, I'm not left with any decisions here! [storms out of the intervention room]
BUTTERS
[emotional] Towelie! We aren't the only ones in this intervention who've been hurt by you!
TOWELIE
Who are you talkin' about?! [Butters pulls out Washcloth from his back pocket and cries] Washcloth? You, you brought Washcloth?! Oh, that's low.
[Lake Tardicaca, night. Jimmy is still singing "Tardicaca Hula Gal"]
JIMMY
Out on the beach with my cute little peach where the waves are rolling in so high
Holding her hand, our feet on the sand-
NATHAN
Dammit dammit!
[Jimmy has skipped the ukulele
solo and moved on to the second verse of 'Tardicaca Hula Gal'.
This has set back Nathan's
plans immensely.]
NATHAN
Mimsy, get out there and demand the ukulele solo. It's our only chance.
MIMSY
Dahh okay boss. [goes towards the stage]
JIMMY
If you get in a pinch, go through, it's a cinch-
MIMSY
[at the stage] Darrr we want the ukulele solo! We want the ukulele solo!
JIMMY
Sorry Mims, I I just can't remember it.
MIMSY
Well we wants ya to play it, don't we?
NATHAN
[behind the audience] Yeeeah!
JIMMY
Alright Mimsy, m-maybe you can show me how it's done. [hands the ukulele to Mimsy]
MIMSY
[hesitates, then] Dahh okay. It's real easy. You just play it like this. [takes the ukulele and begins to play]
NATHAN
[runs up and takes the ukulele from Mimsy] Mimsssyyy! You idio', wha' are you doin'?
MIMSY
D'I was gonna show him how to play the solo, boss.
NATHAN
That DOES it! I'm sick and tired of your stupidity, Mimsy! You are the biggest idiot I have ever met! And from now on, if I wanna do something, I'm gonna do it myself! [plays the solo and hits the right note. The ukulele blows up, launching him into the air] AAAAAAAA!
[Nathan's frustration
with Mimsy has caused a momentary lapse in judgement.
He has played the B flat himself, thus causing his plan to literally
backfire on him.]
NATHAN
[lands with a thud on the beach] Uuuh! [gets up and swoons. The black mamba snake comes up and bites him on the left arm] AAAH! [a group of Tardicaca Indians rides by and shoots arrows into him. He falls to the ground again. The Tardicaca shark comes up out of the water again and humps him, again.] No, not the shark again! Not the shark again!
[The intervention room. Towelie, Butters, and the therapist are all crying as Washcloth just lays there at the edge of a sofa cushion.]
TOWELIE
Oh no, oh Washcloth, I'm so sorry.
BUTTERS
He needs you to get better, Towelie. Please. [resumes crying]
JEFF VAN VONDEREN
You've got so many people that just love the heck out of ya, Towelie. [resumes crying]
TOWELIE
All right. All right, I'll go.
BUTTERS
You will?
TOWELIE
I don't wanna hurt Washcloth anymore.
JEFF VAN VONDEREN
He's goin', everybody. Hugs! [the other boys come in and hug Towelie]
[Lake Tardicaca, day. The paramedics have been called in and are preparing Nathan for the trip to the hospital]
"ELMER FUDD"
Ohh Wed Team. Your captain weawwy got waped.
"PETE PUMA"
I've never seen a kid get screwed by a shark before. Heeee!
"BEAKY BUZZARD"
I hope I never see it again. Ahhahahaha.
JIMMY
Nathan, your team put up an amazing fight. And even though I was crowned the King of Cripple Camp, I want you to know that you were the real ch-cha, champ.
NATHAN
I hate you, Jimmy. I fucking hate you with everything in my entire being.
MIMSY
Dahhh you sure got it stuck it to you this year, boss.
NATHAN
Shut up... Mimsssyyy. [the paramedics lift Nathan into the ambulance and take off]
[Towelie is shown in flight]
[Towelie is going to Ocean View Terrace
Treatment Center in Rancho
Palos Verdes, California]
[Towelie is shown approaching the front doors to the treatment center with a small suitcase]
COUNSELOR
Hi, Towelie?
TOWELIE
Yeah, hi.
COUNSELOR
[in his office] Towelie is definitely one of the most addicted towels we've ever seen here. He's probably the second most psychologically damaged towel I've come across since treating Kirstie Alley's towel, which, had seen some... uuff, some nasty stuff.
TOWELIE
[on a bench overlooking the ocean] I don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring, but I'm learnin' to love what I am. I'm a towel.
SINGER
Veins swell
You know me, Ellen
Enough to tell
Five steps, you're over
[Towelie finished treatment and is back
living with his girlfriend Rebecca.
He has been sober since
April 26, 2010.]

synopsis:Cartman dreams of being a NASCAR driver and heÂ’s willing to do whatever it takes to make it happen.

script:Poor and Stupid

[South Park Elementary, day. School lets out for the day, but Cartman sits in front of his locker crying. Stan and Kyle come into view and walk towards him]
STAN
Cartman, dude, what's wrong?
CARTMAN
[crying quietly] Nothing. Just leave me alone, okay?
KYLE
Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Something's going on.
CARTMAN
It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.
KYLE
"What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up"?
CARTMAN
I don't like thinking about what I wanna be when I grow up, alright?! [buries his head in his lap and cries some more]
STAN
Why not?
CARTMAN
Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be, Stan!
STAN
[faces Cartman] Cartman, tell us.
CARTMAN
[sniffs] No... I wanna be a NASCAR driver, okay? When I see the... car races on TV, those... loud engines and peeling wheels, it's soo cool! [cries some more]
STAN
Well Cartman, if you wanna drive NASCAR when you grow up, you can.
CARTMAN
[cynically, walks off a bit] Oh right. Someone like me can be a NASCAR driver. [turns around and faces the boys] Look at me! [gestures to himself] Do you really think someone like this can ever become an awesome, famous NASCAR driver? [turns away]
KYLE
Aww. Cartman, you can change things about yourself.
CARTMAN
No I can't; I'll always be like this. [wipes tears away]
STAN
Dude, noo, you- you don't know that.
CARTMAN
Come on you guys, I have to face facts. NASCAR is only for poor and stupid people. I don't have what it takes! [cries some more]
KYLE
[reassessing his assumption] What?!
CARTMAN
I'm not poor and stupid enough to do NASCAR, and I never will be!
STAN
Dude, I don't think just poor and stupid people like NASCAR!
CARTMAN
Oh really? Hey, hey Kenny!
KENNY
[looks up from his locker] (What?)
CARTMAN
You love NASCAR huh?
KENNY
[showing the posters inside his locker] (Yeah dude, I looove NASCAR.)
CARTMAN
You see I told you guys! [turns and walks to his locker] What's the use? It just, it's hopeless! [puts his arm on the locker and rests his head on his arm]
KYLE
Cartman, you are poor and you are stupid!
CARTMAN
[lifts his head up] I know you're trying to make me feel better, Kyle, but a rich smart kid has no place on a racetrack. [goes back to crying]
STAN
Dude, you are so retarded!
CARTMAN
Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich.
KYLE
How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!
CARTMAN
[stops crying and brightens up] You guys really think I could do this, don't you? You really believe in me. [smiles]
KYLE
I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!
CARTMAN
Then maybe I can make myself believe it too. [getting confident] Thanks you guys. I'm gonna go chase a dream. [Stan and Kyle just look at each other.]
[Butters' house, some time later. Cartman walks up to the front door and knocks. A smiling Butters walks up to the door and opens it]
CARTMAN
Butters.
BUTTERS
Hey Eric.
CARTMAN
Butters, the guys have been talkin' to me and well, they've got me pretty pumped up. [pumps both fists] I'm psyched, Butters. I'm about to do somethin' big and [pumps both fists] I'm psyched!
BUTTERS
Ahhh well oh-[pumps his right fist] kay.
CARTMAN
But [points his right index finger at him] I'm gonna need your help. [points both index fingers at him] Can you get psyched?? Are you gonna get [pumps both fists twice] psyched up??
BUTTERS
Eeyeah, I'm psyched.
CARTMAN
Get really psyched up, Butters!
BUTTERS
[starts pacing back and forth with energy] I'm really psyched! Yeah! Yeah let's do this alright?! I'm pumped I'm psyched! Alright. Yeah.
CARTMAN
I'm gonna become a NASCAR driver, Butters. I'm goin' for the gold!
BUTTERS
NASCA- NASCAR?
CARTMAN
I know, I'm not poor an' stupid enough. But I change that, Butters, [reaches to his left and pulls into view a water jug full of small change] Here, I want you to take all my money. Every bit of it, Butters. Fifty-eight dollars and thirty-two cents.
BUTTERS
You're givin' away all your money??
CARTMAN
[points] Just get rid of it Butters! Don't tell me where you spend it and don't ever let me have it back. [lowers his finger] From this moment on, I am poor. Like Kenny.
BUTTERS
You sure you want to do this?
CARTMAN
[points] I told you I'm serious, Butters. [lowers his finger] This is my shot. I'm gonna get as poor an' stupid as I possibly can.
[The South Park Mall, evening. A NASCAR display is at the center of the mall, with car and a box of calendars, and a spokesman]
SPOKESMAN
Alright folks, we wanna thank you all for comin' out an' supporting NASCAR.
KENNY
[takes a 2011 calendar] (Yeah! How cool!)
SPOKESMAN
Now who's ready for Saturday's big race? [the crowd cheers]
KENNY
(Woohoo!)
SPOKESMAN
We're really excited to be part of the fastest-growing sport in America! [the crowd cheers]
KENNY
(Woohoo!)
SPOKESMAN
I don't know about you, but I'm thrilled to watch NASCAR finally becoming recognized as a respected, legitimate sport. [the crowd cheers]
KENNY
(Yeah! Yeeaahh!)
BUTTERS
[appears, hauling a cart] Hello! 'Scuse me! [the crowd quiets down and looks] I know that you NASCAR people don't have very much. So I went out and bought you all [shows off his haul] fifty-eight dollars worth of canned food and blankets! You're welcome! [turns around and skips away grinning] Heh! I helped the needy! [Kenny watches him leave]
[Cartman's house, night, Cartman is on the sofa watching TV upside down. He strapped himself down so he doesn't slip off the sofa. His face is turning red from the blood pooling up under his skin]
MAN 1
[voice-over] Boy I tell you what, it is raining cats and dogs outside. Mostly cats. [laughter] I just wish I had brought an umbrella.
BUTTERS
Hey Eric.
CARTMAN
Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money?
BUTTERS
Yep. You don't have a penny left. [points] You're poor as shit. [looks him over] How come you're hangin' upside down?
CARTMAN
I need to get stupid, Butters. I'm getting all the blood to rush to my head and watchin' a marathon of Two and a Half Men.
CHARLIE
Hey- that's a hot girl over there. [giggles]
JAKE
Sure she's hot. She's wearing a sweater. [giggles. The studio audience giggles and applauds]
BUTTERS
Feel stupid yet?
CARTMAN
Not yet.
[Commercial - Vagisil]
WOMAN 1
When a woman isn't feeling her freshest, she turns to Vagisil-
CARTMAN
Aw Goddammit, another Vagisil commercial?!
WOMAN 1
To stop feminine itching, and relieve vaginal odors.
CARTMAN
Fucking gross!
BUTTERS
All those ladies have stinky vaginas?
WOMAN 1
If you develop an allergic reaction, see your doctor. In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss.
WOMAN 2
For the freshest, cleanest feminine area, do what women do.
CARTMAN
[quickly rights himself and stands up] Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Did you hear that?! [clicks on the remote control to reverse it, then plays and echoes the commercial] "In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss." [clicks the remote to pause the playback] Oh my God, Butters... [makes a fist with his left hand] we need Vagisil!
[A supermarket. Cartman and Butters are in the feminine hygiene section]
CARTMAN
"Vagisil, Vagisil Maximum Strength, Vagisil Wash, Vagisil Medicated Wipes."
BUTTERS
Gee-whiz, there's Vagi-everythings.
CARTMAN
Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters.
BUTTERS
Wuh- uh I'm buyin'?
CARTMAN
I'm totally poor Butters. Did you forget?
BUTTERS
But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil.
CARTMAN
Goddammit Butters! Alright just... just keep a lookout, I'll try it here. [positions him] Look that way, make sure the cashier doesn't see me. [As Butters keeps a look out, Cartman opens a tube of Vagisil anti-itch cream and begins to swallow it. Then he takes a bottle of wash and chugs that down, following that up with two more tubes, then more products] Is anybody coming?
BUTTERS
No, you're good. [behind them a woman and her daughter walk by and stop to look. Cartman chugs down another bottle of feminine wash]
CARTMAN
Mm, 'kay, Mm. [throws the bottle away] N-oh, ew, okay, now it's... [grabs a tube of maximum strength anti-itch cream]
WOMAN 3
Little boy, what are you doing? [Cartman looks over his shoulder, then turns around to look at her. Butters notices and does the same. A few seconds later, Cartman turns away]
CARTMAN
Oh my God! Butters! [taps Butters' shoulder and Butters turns around] I feel kind of stupid!
BUTTERS
Really?
CARTMAN
Yes, YES! I'm feeling totally stupid right now.
BUTTERS
That was fast.
CARTMAN
Grab what you can and let's get out of here. I'm ready!
[Race day at Colorado National Speedway. The NASCAR drivers are lined up in two columns awaiting the start of the race.]
ANNOUNCER
We're just seconds away from the start of the Denver 300. [Dale Evans is shown in his car]
BUTTERS
Excuse me. Mr. Evans, sir? [Dale looks over to his left. Butters is in the pit stop] Your uh, your wife is on the phone and- uh, well- she just got raped.
DALE
What?
BUTTERS
Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her.
DALE
Oh my God! [gets out of his car, throws down his helmet, and goes to the pit area]
CARTMAN
[walks towards the car] Sweet. Nice work, Butters. Now go be my spotter so we can win this thing! [puts on the helmet and climbs into the car]
BUTTERS
[now on the walkie-talkie] Eric, are you sure you can do this?
CARTMAN
[Swallows another tube of Vagisil] Don't worry, Butters, I'm totally poor and stupid. I'm ready for NASCAR.
ANNOUNCER
Let the race begin!
CARTMAN
Let's go NASCAR! [the other drivers zoom past him. He steers the wheel, but realizes] I'm not moving, Butters.
BUTTERS
I think you gotta press the gas pedal.
CARTMAN
What's that?
BUTTERS
There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.
CARTMAN
Oh okay. [leans down to press it. He burns rubber and takes off, as "La Grange" by ZZ Top plays] Let's go NASCAR! [he immediately crashes into the wall and tries to power out of it. Suddenly, he turns left and goes back the other way]
ANNOUNCER
It looks like the Dale Evans car is going the wrong way!
CARTMAN
Kewl, NASCAR! Sweet! [the other drivers round the corner and avoid him. Car #78 crashes through the wall and plows up the bleachers. Cartman tries to turn around but goes up into the air and into the pit area. Everyone there gets out of the way. He hits a low wall and goes up into the air again...]
CARTMAN
[abash] Oh, fuck my ass! [he lands in a lake by the Winners Circle.]
BUTTERS
[on the walkie-talkie and mortified] Eric?
[A hospital recovery room, night. Cartman is laid up in bed, and Butters is keeping him company. Cartman's right leg is in a cast and up in a sling]
CARTMAN
All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win.
BUTTERS
Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be.
CARTMAN
[looks away] Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself.
BUTTERS
Eric! Don't ever talk like that!
CARTMAN
I've given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell I have! But it still wasn't enough.
DOCTOR
[enters the room] Alright Eric, we got the X-rays back.
BUTTERS
How bad is it, doctor?
DOCTOR
He has two fractured ribs, a broken femur, torn ligaments in both knees, and a level 2 concussion. He also appears to be developing three small vaginas in his stomach, but they are all sparkling clean.
BUTTERS
Well at least there's that.
CARTMAN
Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this.
DOCTOR
You aren't on life-support. Pulling a plug wouldn't do anything.
CARTMAN
Aw donkey balls...
DOCTOR
You're lucky to be alive, young man. Sneaking onto a NASCAR racetrack and hijacking a car for a joyride? That has got to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard of a kid doing! [walks away]
CARTMAN
Thanks, doc, but you aren't gonna make me feel any better.
DOCTOR
[turns around] No, really. Of all the idiotic dumb ways I've seen kids injure themselves, yours takes the retard cake! [walks out of the room]
BUTTERS
Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid.
CARTMAN
Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough?
BUTTERS
It has to be, Eric. [Cartman moves his right leg out of the sling and gets out of bed.] Eric, where are you going?
CARTMAN
Get me my coat, Butters. We're gonna try this thing again. [Butters brightens up]
[Kenny's house, day. Kenny is reading a NASCAR magazine on the sofa]
FOX 11 ANCHOR
You're watching Colorado FOX 11. Next on FOX 11 News, are NASCAR fans stupid? [Kenny looks up] Some people are starting to wonder after a NASCAR fan apparently got high on Vagisil and snuck onto the track, killing eleven people.
REPORTER
Tom, the NASCAR fan got into a car here on Sunday and crashed in the lake behind me. He was later found to have ingested this [holds up a tube] Maximum Strength Vagisil. And also Vagisil medicated wipes. Making NASCAR fans look ...pretty stupid, Tom.
KENNY
[closes his magazine and throws it on the sofa in a blind rage] (No! NASCAR fans aren't stupid! Cartman is!)
REPORTER
The NASCAR fan vows he will try to do it again, but that this time, he'll win.
KENNY
(Oh that fucking asshole!) [gets off the couch and walks out the front door, vexed] (Oh that fucking asshole, I'm gonna talk to him...)
[Cartman's house, day. A vile Kenny walks over to Cartman's house, goes up the steps, and he furiously pounds and kicks at the front door until Cartman answers it]
CARTMAN
Oh hey, Kenny! [Kenny is not happy and his arms are crossed]
KENNY
[furious] (Dude, what the fuck are you doing?!)
CARTMAN
Come in dude, I wanna show you what I've been workin' on. [Kenny follows him in. Cartman shows him all the stuff he purchased - a jet ski, a Room-bot, a 7.1 speaker system, a plasma TV, an LCD monitor, a VHS/DVD combo player] Check it out. I thought I could just give all my money away and be as poor as your family, but then I realized: what do poor people do? Buy things even though they don't have money by going out and purchasing things that are 0% down and no payments for two years! That's how you people stay poor forever! Am I right? That's it, right? [Kenny is still pissed off]
KENNY
(Dude, fuck you!)
CARTMAN
Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR.
KENNY
(Being poor has nothing to do with NASCAR!)
CARTMAN
[annoyed] Hey, I love NASCAR just as much as you do!
KENNY
[apoplectically] (NO, YOU FUCKING DON'T!!)
CARTMAN
Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I've had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth!
KENNY
[thinks for a moment] (WHAT?!)
CARTMAN
I've had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! I didn't have parents to do it for me like you do! [Kenny raises his fists up, but Cartman hugs him with one arm] Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. We shouldn't be fighting. We both love NASCAR and we're both poor as shit.
MAN
[appears at the front door] Uh, excuse me. [Cartman sees him and walks to the door] Eric Cartman?
CARTMAN
Yeah?
MAN
My name is Geoff Hamill. I'm the founder and CEO of Vagisil.
CARTMAN
...Uh oh.
GEOFF HAMILL
Young man, your NASCAR stunt has brought a lot of attention to Vagisil and honestly, I don't know how to thank you. Our sales are up and women are finally realizing that their feminine odor can be treated. I first created Vagisil for my wife, Patty. [steps aside to reveal Patty standing halfway out in the yard] She's my Muse, my flame. We realized that NASCAR can do a lot for product recognition and so, Vagisil has a little present... for you. [turns around and walks out, showing off a brand-new Vagisil NASCAR car]
CARTMAN
Awww, sweet! [runs to the car, then runs his right hand over the body] No way, this is so tits!
GEOFF HAMILL
Vagisil would like you to represent us in the next NASCAR race.
CARTMAN
Dude, check it out, Kenny! My very own NASCAR!
KENNY
[angrily in disbelief] (No fucking way!)
GEOFF HAMILL
And we've modified the cockpit to be operated properly by a child.
CARTMAN
Aww coool, huh Kenny? [Makes engine revving and shift change noises] I got a NASCAR, Kenny! [Geoff looks at Kenny, smiling] So awesome, huh Kenny? [Kenny can only look on angrily]
[A conference room, day. A NASCAR spokesman holds a mic]
ANNOUNCER
We are now live at the NASCAR press conference, where the drivers of Saturday's race are gearing up and taking questions from reporters.
REPORTER 1
So uh what's your guys' take on the track here? Any concerns? [present are Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Jimmie Johnson, Danica Patrick, Jeff Gordon, Tony Stewart, Eric Cartman, and Matt Kenseth]
JIMMIE JOHNSON
Well I think it's a fine track, you know. The- the techs have done a really good job of makin' sure the banks are grafted down to the right specs and there shouldn't be any problems-
CARTMAN
[doing a redneck accent and acting completely stupid] Yeah, we like the track, yup. We gotta graft them banks an' specs, it's like an oval, so we're gonna drive straight and then we're gonna be turnin' to the left.
REPORTER 2
Uhhh they're saying hot weather tomorrow; any concerns about restrictor plate or brake fade problems?
JEFF GORDON
Of course, any time you're dealin' with high humidity and temperatures you need to compensate your brake fluid, but the plates themselves-
CARTMAN
Compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer, git yer... b-brake workin' so you can stop sometimes.
DALE EARNHARDT, JR.
Hey excuse me, who is this kid? Is he even a driver?
CARTMAN
Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes!
DANICA PATRICK
Can we just, get back to the subject of racing, please?
CARTMAN
Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?!
[After the press conference, Cartman meets up with Butters]
BUTTERS
You seemed really stupid, Eric.
CARTMAN
Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us.
[Mick's Lanes. Kenny is at the bar drinking glass after glass of water, looking depressed. On TV, Pardon The Interruption airs]
TONY KORNHEISER
Alright, from the NFL we now turn to the world of NASCAR! People who weren't sure what to think of NASCAR are more sure today after a NASCAR driver released bigoted and ignorant statements on his podcast.
[Cartman is in a studio of his making; a confederate flag hangs on the wall, a checkered flag with NASCAR next to it hangs above a propane grill (indoors) an unmade bed in the background. He himself looks like he's wasted on Vagisil. He clears his throat and begins recording]
CARTMAN
Alright, what's up NASCAR fans? I don't know about y'all, but this President Obama is pissin' me off! So I'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind. Today I'm gonna be dippin'... [holds up a bottle] Vagisil Regular Strength Anti-Itch Creme. [squeezes some out and rubs it all over his lips] Oh yeah. Yeah, that's a big dipper right there. But I'm pretty pissed off at what I found out. I found out this "Obama" wants to put a bigger tax on gasoline! [spits into a can] What the fuck is up with that?! That's fuckin' gay! And he's fuckin' gay as hell! [Kenny buries his face in the counter, in shame. On screen, Butters appears behind Cartman] You all know my pit boss, Butters. [Butters appears over by the grill, also with a mouthful of Vagisil]
BUTTERS
Obama's fuckin' gay.
CARTMAN
He's fuckin' gay as hell!
BUTTERS
Pissin' me off!
CARTMAN
[dips again and rubs it on his lips] So y'all be sure to catch us in our next race. We're about as poor an' stupid as they fuckin' come, so come down an' cheer for us at NASCAR on Saturday! Obama's gay as hell!
TONY KORNHEISER
[back to Kenny sitting watching TV at Mick's Lanes] Well if you ask me, that's all the proof we need that NASCAR really is just for the poor... [sharply] and the stupid.
KENNY
[Kenny has enough as he slammed his fist in anger] (Fuck this!) [leaves the bar, livid]
[Saturday at Colorado National Speedway. The Vagisil car is prepared as Cartman sits in it]
COMMENTATOR 1
The stage is set for what could be the most important race of the NASCAR year.
COMMENTATOR 2
Lots of speculation and interest in the Vagisil car, driven by Eric Cartman. We are joined now by the inventor and owner of Vagisil, Geoff Hamill.
GEOFF
Thank you, Chris.
CHRIS
[Commentator 2] Geoff? Why did you decide to sponsor a NASCAR driver?
GEOFF
Vagisil is very excited to be part of the NASCAR phenomenon, Chris. You know, I... first created Vagisil to try and help my wife, Patty. She is my Muse, my flame. Wherever Patty goes her smile lights up the room. Her vagina, on the other hand, clears the room and makes it uninhabitable for weeks.
COMMENTATOR 1
Ohkay, well the race is about to start, so why don't we kick it back down to the track?
ANNOUNCER
[Over the PA system] Gentlemen, start your engines! [the crowd begins to cheer]
CARTMAN
Alright, "start your engine." What's that mean?
PIT CREWMAN
That means you flip the switch that says "Engine." [to Butters] Is he stupid or what?
BUTTERS
Yeah, he's a champion alright.
[At the Speedway entrance, Kenny approaches the racetrack entrance with a tote bag]
SECURITY GUARD
Check your bag please, sir? [Kenny hands him the bag. The guard checks the bag and pulls out a long rifle] No, no, see, this won't do. You can't bring a sniper rifle onto the track.
KENNY
(Aww, come on!)
SECURITY GUARD
Look, NASCAR is trying to change its image. It's people like you that are givin' NASCAR a bad name!
KENNY
(Aw come on, fuck you!) [enters]
SECURITY GUARD
You might be able to buy one in the gift shop. [inside, the cars begin to move down pit lane]
[On the track]
ANNOUNCER
[Over the PA] The drivers are slowly heading out to follow the pace car.
CARTMAN
[in the redneck accent] Then I'm gonna press the gas pedal and I'm gonna go forward. [does so and rear-ends #78, then back up and swerves onto the track and sideswipes #95 and #78] NASCAR! Yee-ah!
PIT CREWMAN
This is just the pace lap, you don't go full speed yet!
CARTMAN
Yeah, just the pace lap! I'm gonna hit the, hit the brake! [hits the brakes and #7 runs into him. Danica Patrick is the driver]
DANICA PATRICK
[infuriated] The fuck are you doing?!
CARTMAN
[gives her the middle finger] Fuck you, Danica Patrick! You ain't half as dumb as me! Gas pedal! [steps on the gas and peels away. Other cars pass Danica, whose engine is now on fire]
DANICA PATRICK
Oh, son of a bitch!
CARTMAN
Woowee, ain't nobody can stop muhey!
[in the sports booth]
COMMENTATOR 1
And it looks like the Vagisil car has already clipped two other drivers and taken them out of the race.
CHRIS
Yea, the other drivers are not going to be happy about this. What do you think, Mr. Hamill?
GEOFF HAMILL
Vagisil is a company that really stands behind its product, Chris. We want women to know that Vagisil is effective, safe for use every day, [looks at Patty and enunciates] Every. Day. [she just stands there] Every. Day. [she looks down and away] ...And available nationwide.
[On the track, the racers speeding on each other, Cartman side smashes the #52 car to a wall causing it to spin out]
BUTTERS
Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side. [Danica Patrick finally comes out of her car] You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side.
CARTMAN
Oh yeah, I see it. [Cartman avoids the car, but runs over Danica, who was trying to make it across the track to the field inside]
DANICA PATRICK
AAAAAA! [Cartman keeps going and ran over her]
CARTMAN
[looks over his right shoulder, then faces forward again] You see that? Daynicuh Patrick tried to get in my way. That pisses me off!
BUTTERS
That's fuckin' gay as hell.
CARTMAN
Whoop I'm comin' up on that turn thing again. I got to stayer left. [turns the steering wheel hard to the left and drives through the drivers' eating area and the pedestrians all running and screaming, Cartman ran over most of them and some survived by running from the side] Get out of the way you idiots, I'm tryin' to win this dayum thang! "[Cartman made it back on the track]"
BUTTERS
There you go. You're back on the track.
CARTMAN
I'm back own the track. [An enraged Kenny makes his way down the bleacher steps towards the track. He jumps onto the track and lands on the Vagisil car. He turns around on the car roof and looks into the car through the windshield, Cartman also enraged as well] What the... Kenny! What the hell are you doing?!
KENNY
[pounds on the windshield] (Stop this car!)
CARTMAN
[irked] Get off my car, Kenny!
KENNY
[inflamed] (Stop this car right now!)
BUTTERS
Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell? [the #14 car is getting its wheels changed when Cartman barrels into it, causing it to flip over and land on its pit crew, killing them]
CARTMAN
We're tradin' paint! [further down the track he hits two other cars, which then slammed into each other. Back to Cartman, he's furious] Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself!
KENNY
[incensed] (I fucking hate you!)
CARTMAN
[determined and angered] Sorry dude, I'm winning this race! Hit the brake! Bye Kenny. [steps on the brakes, launching Kenny at the end of the track]
KENNY
(AAAAAAAAAAAAAA...) [goes a long distance before the first bounce, then bounces a few more times. Two other cars remain on the track, and they pass Cartman]
DRIVER
Oh Jesus, there's a little boy on the track. [the two cars swerve just in time, but one crashes into the outer wall, the other into the inner wall, Kenny ducks]
[in the booth]
CHRIS
Well it appears that all the other drivers have crashed and only the Vagisil car remains. Looks like you're going to win, Mr. Hamill.
GEOFF HAMILL
This is such a great day for Vagisil, Chris. Our product awareness will be at an all-time high. Feminine odor must be treated diligently. [looks over at Patty] Very. Diligently. [a look of shock crosses his face. Patty is gone. The cameramen wonder what's going on.] Patty? Patty?
[On the track, Patty walks over to the #48 car and pulls its driver out. She climbs in]
ANNOUNCER
It looks like a woman is trying to take over for Jimmie Johnson's car. [Mr. Hamill and the commentators join him in his booth]
GEOFF HAMILL
What? [Patty gets the car started and backs up. Determined, she takes off as "La Grange" starts playing again]
LOWES PIT BOSS
Ma'am? You are on an active racetrack. This is extremely dangerous.
GEOFF HAMILL
Let me talk to her. [puts on the pit boss's headphones] Patty? Patty, what are you doing? [Patty skillfully drives the car around the track] Patty, pull over the NASCAR. You're acting irrationally. Patty, did you forget to take your medication? You know how you get when you don't use your Vagisil. There should be some in your purse, my Muse. Patty? [she reaches Cartman and taps his car with Johnson's]
[On the track, Patty hits Cartman from behind.]
CARTMAN
Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck mah car.
BUTTERS
I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.
CARTMAN
Fuckin' gay as hell. [Patty pulls up to his left, taps him a bit, then pulls away.]
GEOFF HAMILL
Patty, you are my Muse, and my flame.
ANNOUNCER
They are neck and neck approaching the finish line. [This time she bumps him off. Cartman's car spins out then flips up in the air...]
CARTMAN
[Shocked] Oh, fuck my ass again! [...and crashes upside down into the outer wall. Patty goes onto the finish line, getting the victory for Jimmie Johnson]
GEOFF HAMILL
[Geoff is frustrated] HAAAAAAAAAA!
[Moments later, at the winners' circle. Lots of cheers as Patty Hamill shows off the huge trophy, an angry Geoff walks to her]
ANNOUNCER
Big celebration for the Lowe's Home Improvement team.
GEOFF HAMILL
Patty! How could you?! You've ruined us! You've ruined Vagisil!
[nearby, Cartman and Butters look on, Cartman's NASCAR racesuit is slightly has ash and his hair as well, while he brush himself off in defeat. Kenny walks up to Cartman and angrily points]
KENNY
(HA! You fucking lose!) [crosses his arms in triumph]
CARTMAN
No, no, Kenny, go ahead. I deserve it. [Kenny is confused] I thought I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what these people do. But I owe you an apology. The truth is I'm just too smart. And with how smart I am I'll always be successful and therefore have money. I just have to accept I'm too smart and rich for NASCAR. Time for me to give it up. Alright Butters, give me back my money.
BUTTERS
[flabbergasted] Huh?
CARTMAN
[livid] The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back!
BUTTERS
Uh, but- but you- you said I had to [begins to stammer, both walk off, as Kenny stares in confusion] s-spend on it on the... buy what I can start buyin' and start way in- bu- so get buy- [unintelligible]
CARTMAN
Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over!
BUTTERS
But you said to take your money so I took it by [unintelligible] Ah I don't know.
End of Poor and Stupid


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:New Jersey is rapidly taking over the nation one state at a time and their next stop is South Park.

script:It's a Jersey Thing

[The Broflovski house, dining room table, evening. The family is gathered at table eating dinner]
KYLE
Mom, Dad, what's "muff cabbage"? [Gerald and Sheila pause. They look at each other, then turn back to their son]
GERALD
[confused] Muff cabbage?
SHEILA
[also confused] Where did you hear that?
IKE
Muff cabbage!
KYLE
The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop "muff cabbage".
IKE
Muff cabbage.
SHEILA
A new family moved in? Where are they from?
KYLE
She said they're from New Jersey.
SHEILA
[drops her fork] New Jersey? A family from New Jersey moved in next to the Marshes?
KYLE
Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.
SHEILA
[fearful, quickly leaves her chair and walks off a bit] Oh, God. Poor Sharon. Doesn't she know?
KYLE
Know what, Ma?
IKE
Muff cabbage!
SHEILA
Never invite a New Jersey housewife into your home.
[The Marsh house, dinner time. The table has been enlarged to accommodate their guests - a family with three kids. Grandpa Marsh is not at the table]
TERESA
[at the head of the table. Sharon is to her right] And so then I met the school principal. What's her name? Principal Victoria? What a stupid bitch! I mean, excuse my language, but that bitch needs her fuckin' head examined!
[Teresa's new home, next door, on New Jersey Housewives]
TERESA
Yeah, so my family and I moved from Jersey to South Park about a week ago. So far, I can tell that everyone here really likes me.
[The Marsh house, dinner time]
TERESA
Oh! And I met that Stotch woman. What's her name?
SHARON
Oh, Linda, huh?
TERESA
Have you noticed how yellow that bitch's teeth are? You can tell that woman is a piece of garbage. She's garbage! [the girls at the table just look on and continue eating] I went into the mall here and I just about dropped dead. The only panties you can buy makes you look like you got a grandma muff! Where's the Gucci? Where's the Prada? Have they heard of Italian clothes? It's ridiculous!
JOE
[as Teresa rattles on] So, Randy, what gyms are good around here? Where do you work out?
RANDY
I don't really work out.
JOE
Well, I gotta find somethin'. [flexes his left biceps] My biceps are goin' flat.
TERESA
Where can you get good clothes in this town?! Nowhere! I mean, that's why you're stuck wearing garbage like that, right? And the woman that works the hair salon? Julia? Have you seen how big that bitch's ears are?
SHARON
Oh, Julia's a friend of mine, yeah.
TERESA
Ears out to here! [spreads her arms out as far as they could go] So I tell her, "You got big ears, sweetie." I'm not trying to be mean. It's just a Jersey thing. Why be offended? [to Sharon] I mean, you've got a big chin. We've all got imperfections.
SHARON
Right, just like your eyes are kind of far apart. [Teresa's expression changes to a dark mood]
[Teresa's new home, next door, on New Jersey Housewives]
TERESA
That was totally uncalled for, for what she did. My eyes are too far apart? And like who is she? Is she God? No.
[The Marsh house, dinner time]
TERESA
You don't ever, ever! You whack job, prostitution... [slams her hands on the table] ...whore! You probably sell your muff... [slams her hands on the table] ...for six dollars! You fucking psycho bitch! Fuck you! [lifts the table, which causes it to dump the food on the floor. Sharon quickly hides behind Randy] You're nothin' but garbage! [Joe comes up and restrains her from behind] That's what you are! You're garbage! [Stan's eyes dart back and forth] You sick, old woman! Muff garbage! [Joe takes her into the kitchen] Muff cabbage! Fuck this psycho bitch!
SHARON
Wow.
TERESA
Let's get the fuck outta here! She's a fuckin' pig! She's fuckin' pissin' me off! [to Joe] Okay, I love you.
JOE
Take it easy.
TERESA
I love you. [they kiss] I love you.
[Teresa's new home]
TERESA
I thought I was gonna deck her. I was fine. I was really fine. I just wanted to get my point across to her, and then that's how I am. [she takes Joe's hand and walks him back into the dining room] Like I could be mad one minute and then I'll be fine.
[The Marsh house, dinner time]
TERESA
Okay, all better. Just had to get that out. It's just... it's a Jersey thing. So, who wants dessert? Meeee!
[At Sizzler, day. The boys are having lunch there]
STAN
You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!
CARTMAN
You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep.
KYLE
[glaring at him] Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?
CARTMAN
Oops, busted. [avoids eye contact]
STAN
They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, "Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing."
JERSEY MAN
Hey, you talkin' 'bout Jersey? Me and my friends are from Jersey.
CARTMAN
Aw, crap, there's more of them?
JERSEY MAN
'Ey, come on, there's people from Jersey all over! Who here is from Jersey? [a lot of people respond excitedly]
[Highlight. The Jersey man is Steve "Last Call"]
STEVE "LAST CALL"
So I'm like standin' there, and I'm like, "Who's from Jersey?", and people are all like, "Yo! Woo-hoo!" Next thing you know, Jersey party at Sizzler. [the restaurant is transformed into a club]
[Sizzler, later on. Everyone is dancing except the boys, music is pumping, lights flash all around]
WOMAN
[nude in a in a Jacuzzi] Yeah, let's get this party started. [a random fight breaks out]
KYLE
Where the hell are they coming from?! [a bottle of Corona beer lands in front of the boys and shatters]
[South Park Salon, day. Sharon approaches it. Inside...]
TERESA
Danielle was being a stupid bitch.
WOMAN 1
Shut up, Teresa. You're pathetic!
TERESA
I'm pathetic? You're muff cabbage! [Sharon walks into the salon. Teresa gets up to greet her] Oh, Sharon! [they hug] Hi, sweetie. You gotta meet our new neighbors. This is Jacqueline. She's from Jersey.
JACQUELINE
And Sicilian.
TERESA
That's Danielle. She's from Jersey. [Danielle is extremely tanned] And that's Caroline.
CAROLINE
I'm having my face shaved. It's a Jersey thing.
SALON GIRL
I'm sorry, but I have other clients in ten minutes. Can you sit down? [Teresa didn't like that request]
[Highlight.]
JACQUELINE
When the salon girl told Teresa to sit down, I thought Teresa was gonna bust a tit.
[the salon]
TERESA
Don't you fuckin' tell me what to do! I'm a client here!
CAROLINE
Teresa! Calm down.
SALON GIRL
I don't have to take your shit! I'm from Jersey!
TERESA
Get her, Sharon!
SHARON
What?
JACQUELINE
Sharon, just stay out of it!
CAROLINE
Be the bigger person, Sharon!
SHARON
You people are crazy.
CAROLINE
Who's crazy? Are you talkin' about my family?! [grabs Sharon by the hair as she screams] Is my family crazy?!
TERESA
Don't you pull my friend's hair, you bitch! [pulls Sharon back by the hair]
SHEILA
[barges in ready to fight] Let go of her, you piece of trash! [the other ladies turn to look]
TERESA
Who the fuck are you to tell ME what to do?!
SHEILA
[walks up to the women] All you trashy whores get the fuck out of here and leave her alone!
TERESA
Psycho bitch!
SHEILA
[slaps her hand away] No! You're a psycho bitch, psycho bitch! Psycho biiitch! You wanna see fuckin' crazy?! You'd better just step the fuck away or you're gonna see fuckin' crazy! [the Jersey women begin to leave]
JACQUELINE
[turns to look at Sheila] You're cabbage! [then leaves]
SHARON
Sheila?
[At the South Park Community Center, evening. Randy has the floor as the other townsfolk sit and listen]
RANDY
People of South Park! We have all noticed a steep rise in everything Jersey lately. As many of you already know, everything east of the Rockies is now part of New Jersey! The Jersey Shore now includes Jacksonville, Miami, the Gulf of Jersey Mexico, and the Jersey Islands. [this includes Puerto Rica and Cuba]
MR. GARRISON
Jesus! Why are they doing this?
RANDY
More people from Jersey are showing up in our town! If we don't do something, South Park is going to become West Jersey.
JIMBO
Well, that does it! Let's go tell everyone from Jersey we don't want 'em here!
ALL
Yeah!
SHEILA
That won't work. You can't just tell people from Jersey you don't like them. No matter how obnoxious they are, they will convince themselves that you all actually think they're cool.
JIMBO
How do you know that, Ms. Broflovski? [Sheila is on the spot.]
[Highlight.]
SHEILA
That's when I knew I had to tell everyone the truth: that originally I'm from Jersey. [the adults present are Stephen and Linda Stotch, Randy and Sharon Marsh, Stuart McCormick, his wife, and Liane Cartman] Yes, born and raised, I wasn't even called Sheila back then. In Jersey I was known as S-Woww Tittybang. [a picture of her is shown] I drank heavily and punched a lot of bitches in the face. [a picture of one such incident is shown] Living in South Park, I'm able to control the Jersey side of me, which doesn't really come out unless I get around other people from Jersey. [turns away from the other adults] I'm just really hoping that people here don't judge me for it, or or, somehow, you know, hold it against me.
SHARON
Sheila, who are you talking to?
SHEILA
You wouldn't understand. It's a Jersey thing. [walks away]
[The park, basketball court, day. The boys - Stan, Kenny and Cartman - are playing basketball. Kenny has the ball and is trying to get past Cartman]
CARTMAN
You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!
KYLE
[approaching] Hey, dudes.
CARTMAN
[takes the ball from Kenny and confronts Kyle] Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him.
KYLE
What are you talking about?
CARTMAN
Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!
KYLE
So what?
CARTMAN
So what?! That makes you from Jersey!
KYLE
No, it doesn't!
CARTMAN
[turns around] He's from Jersey, you guys. [inches away] Let's just get away from him.
KYLE
I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.
CARTMAN
Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three!
KYLE
What's strike three?!
[Cartman removes his hat from his head, revealing his large curly red hair]
CARTMAN
You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!
KYLE
Shut the fuck up! [grabs his hat back and puts it on, then looks at the other boys] What?
STAN
Did you know your mom was from Jersey?
KYLE
Why does it matter?!
STAN
No, uh, it just explains a lot.
CARTMAN
[moves Kyle aside] Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange!
KYLE
No, it isn't!
CARTMAN
Yes, it is. It's getting oranger.
STAN
Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is.
KENNY
(Yeah.)
CARTMAN
Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you. [walks away, then turns and glares at him] And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a lot more!
[The Broflovski house, night. Kyle is brushing his teeth when he looks at himself in the mirror and then checks out his hands and his face. He takes his toothbrush out of his mouth and drops it into the sink, then checks out his face again]
KYLE
No. [removes his hat] Couldn't be. [opens the top drawer of the vanity and pulls out a pair of scissors. He begins to cut his hair, slowly, then faster and faster. He gets some styling gel and rubs it into his hair. He gets a razor out to shape his eyebrows, cuts more of his hair off, rips the sleeves off his shirt, gets a bracelet and puts it on his right forearm, gets more gel and rubs a design onto his shirt, then is shocked at what he sees in the mirror] Oh my God!
SHEILA
[knocks on the bathroom door] Kyle? You in there?
KYLE
Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now. [goes about putting stuff away and closing all the drawers]
SHEILA
Kyle, open the door.
KYLE
Not now, Mom. Please.
SHEILA
Kyle, this instant! One, two. [Kyle goes to the door]
KYLE
All right, all right. [opens the door and see his mom, who's really Jerseyfied herself. He's speechless]
SHEILA
I guess we need to talk.
[Kyle's bedroom, minutes later. She and Kyle are sitting on his bed]
SHEILA
I know this has to be very upsetting for you, Kyle.
KYLE
[enunciating] What am I, Mom?
SHEILA
When I got pregnant with you, Kyle, your father and I were living with my parents in Newark. We knew we had to get out. Neither of us wanted our child to be from Jersey, so we moved. As far away as we could. But now I realize you can take the fetus out of Jersey, but you can't take Jersey out of the fetus.
KYLE
[getting scared] What are you saying?!
SHEILA
I'm saying that for the first two months I carried you in my stomach, I lived in Newark. Technically, you are from Jersey.
KYLE
[looks at his new look] No! I don't wanna look like this!
SHEILA
It isn't so bad, Kyle, a lot of people think the Jersey look is nice!
IKE
[walks by and looks] Aaaaiiiiihhhhh! [faints on his back]
KYLE
I can hide it! [hops off the bed] Nobody ever has to know! [puts his hat back on and walks out the bedroom door] I can't ever let anybody know!
[a news program comes on]
ANNOUNCER
Live from St. Louis, New Jersey! It's the "Jersey News" with anchormen P-Train and Tan Jovi!
P-TRAIN
What's up, New Jersey? It's the evenin' news. Our top story tonight: many Jersey people are freakin' pissed after a small town in Colorado got all aggro on some decent Jersey folk! For more on this story we go to Chicago.
REPORTER
People here in Chicago, New Jersey are riled up, P-Train. Apparently, a town called South Park, which is at the border of Denver, New Jersey, is discriminating against people from Jersey! They won't sell houses to people from Jersey, and they're making all the ones who moved in move out. [the Giudice family is forcibly hauled out of their new home and stuffed into their car] And they're takin' down all the Jersey-owned shops! [South Park Salon is bombed and everyone in there runs out] It's like these people got a beef with Jersey. What's up with that?!
TAN JOVI
What's up with that?!
P-TRAIN
What's up with that?!
TAN JOVI
Well, we are coming after you, South Park! We fight discrimination! It's a Jersey thing!
[South Park, night, town square. The townsfolk have brought everything they could think of to form a barricade against the Jersey folk. Randy is on the line]
RANDY
Please, Governor. You have to send your troops to join us in this fight. We're just a small town. We can't stop New Jersey on our own.
SCHWARZENEGGER
Ve are very sore-y, but Cal-i-for-ni-a cannot afford helping you at this time.
RANDY
Can't you see that if we fall to New Jersey, California is next?
SCHWARZENEGGER
No, because U-tah is between Colo-rah-do and Cal-i-for-ni-a.
RANDY
Oh. Fine! But when Utah gets taken over by New Jersey, who's next?!
SCHWARZENEGGER
Nevada.
RANDY
Oh, really? Well, okay, Mr. I'm-Awesome-at-Geography!
[South Park, night, town square. In the shadows, Kyle gives Kenny a rifle as Cartman walks up. Stan gives another rifle to Kyle]
CARTMAN
What the hell are you guys doing?!
STAN
Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.
CARTMAN
[points to Kyle] And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could easily be a spy!
KYLE
I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!
CARTMAN
Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?!
KYLE
That's enough!
CARTMAN
Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!
KYLE
[loses his temper via short temper] Aaaarrghhhhhh! [runs at Cartman and pins him hard against a tree] I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in! [lets go and walks away angrily. Cartman backs up a bit without saying a word, then breaks down wailing]
CARTMAN
[Whining] That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the treeee! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it! [Stan and Kenny walk away silently] Did you see the scratch, Keeenney?!
[South Park, night, town square. Randy is on the line looking for other support]
RANDY
Please, Emperor Akishino! We need Japan's help to fight these people! [waits for an answer] Fine! But you Japs will all be eatin' hoagies in a month! [throws his cell phone away and claps his hands free of it] That's it, nobody's gonna help us! We're on our own!
STUART
We can't take on all of Jersey. We have to find support.
RANDY
There is no support! Every ally America ever had is... [thinks of something] Wait a minute. [strokes his chin] Sometimes when a threat is great enough, you have to turn to your enemies for help.
MR. GARRISON
What are you talking about?
RANDY
We could ask Al Qaeda.
STEPHEN
[steps forward] Ask Al Qaeda for help? After what they did to us?!
RANDY
Maybe it's time we put our differences aside and forgive them.
STEPHEN
And what about the families of the victims of 9/11? Their feelings matter for another ten months, damn it!
BAR PATRON 1
Hey! Hey, we got a problem! You've gotta get some people down to the bar quick! There's trouble!
RANDY
People from Jersey?
BAR PATRON 1
I don't know what the hell I saw.
[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails, night. Officer Barbrady's cruiser is parked out front. Officer Barbrady and other men from the town search the bar in the darkness with flashlights]
BARTENDER
It tore a hole in my meat locker. Smashed the cigarette machine in half.
BARBRADY
Alright, come out now. Make it easy on yourself. [a soft, high growl is heard and a figure runs by in the shadows, bumping into a few tables. The figure runs by again, grunting. The flashlights follow the sound and find a woman who looks like a troll cowering in a corner. Her arms are really short, her ears are elfin, her skin is orange and her black hair is styled in a beehive hairdo]
BAR PATRON 2
It's one of them! That thing's from Jersey, too! [the thing moves closer to the ATM and smokes]
RANDY
What is it?
BAR PATRON 2
It's called a Snooki. It's very famous. [Snooki sips from her drink and eats straight out of a pickle jar]
RANDY
That thing is famous? Why?
BAR PATRON 2
I don't know!
JIMBO
Well, what are we waitin' for? Let's kill it! [aims his shotgun and fires at her. She drops the pickle jar and it shatters.]
SNOOKI
[walking away from the ATM] Snooo-ki.
RANDY
Don't let it get away! Where is it?! [hears a sound] Who was that?! [his beam lands on Snooki, who has taken Stephen Stotch down and is raping him]
STEPHEN
Aaagh! Get it off of me!
SNOOKI
[raping him] Snooki smoosh.
STEPHEN
Shoot it! [another gunshot is heard and Snooki heads for a window and jumps out through it, running away]
[South Park Square, night. Cartman has left his usual friends and is talking to a group of other boys from his class: Bradley, Jason, Butters, Fosse, DogPoo, and Bill]
CARTMAN
So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, "I'll smash your teeth in!" My head is all like gashed open.
BUTTERS
Kyle did that? Gee whiz.
CARTMAN
I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler. [Kyle is cleaning his rifle nearby and lifts his head to see what the other boys are doing] Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh? [Kyle returns to cleaning his rifle. Cartman then moves to the opposite side of the circle] He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now!
BUTTERS
Are you being serious?
CARTMAN
This is very serious, Butters.
BUTTERS
Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die.
CARTMAN
Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?! [Kyle looks up again. Cartman notices and turns to look back at him] Hey, Kyle. [stretches] Uhh... Dude, do you smell raspberries? I smell raspberries. Ho? Huh. [turns around and goes into a low voice as Kyle watches from nearby] We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up.
[Al Qaeda headquarters in the caves of Afghanistan. Al Qaeda members go about their business]
OPERATIVE
[walks up to bin Laden with a package] Istagia makuman? [bin Laden turns around and takes the package, which is a video tape. He puts it into a tape player and watches the video. Randy pops up onscreen]
RANDY
Hello, Mr. bin Laden. My name is Randy, and I'm a geologist in America. I know that America isn't your favorite place in the world, but gosh darn it, we need your help. As you may know, we are trying to stop our entire country from becoming New Jersey. I believe that if we do not succeed, Jersey will spread to Japan, Russia, and eventually, to you. I know you have seen countless horrors in your lifetime, Mr. bin Laden, and that you have witnesses the very worst of mankind. Well, now I ask you to watch this. [Jersey Shore's live-action show open begins to play]
SNOOKI
Neaaaaaah! Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
[Sizzler, night time. Cartman climbs into the restaurant through a window]
CARTMAN
Come on, you guys, hurry!
STAN
[climbs in behind him] Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler?
CARTMAN
I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!
KENNY
[climbs in behind Stan] (What kind of fuckin' miracle?!) [Kyle climbs in last]
CARTMAN
[leads them to a spot] Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool. [stops] It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out.
KYLE
[looks at Cartman for a few seconds] Why?
CARTMAN
Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!
KYLE
You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.
CARTMAN
Nuh-uh. Seriously, nuh-uh.
KYLE
I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!
CARTMAN
Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights! [the lights go on and the fourth graders Cartman was talking to earlier pop into view] Ha-ha! It's a trap, Kyle! Get him to the meat locker! [the group of six come up and take Kyle away]
STAN
Dude, what are you doing?
CARTMAN
[stops Stan and Kenny in their tracks] Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us. [rushes up to the freezer door] Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted.
KYLE
All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll... [his expression changes quickly] Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?
CARTMAN
Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!
KYLE
No, I- I'm serious. What is that behind you?
CARTMAN
You ginger Jersey Jew! [Snooki rises up behind him] Your tactics don't work on me!
SNOOKI
Snooki wants smoosh smoosh. [breathes heavily]
CARTMAN
[looks over his shoulder, then looks back at the other boys] Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me?
[South Park Square, night. Stephen runs up to Garrison behind the barricade]
STEPHEN
Garrison, I think the Jersey people are advancing. Where's Randy?
MR. GARRISON
He's still questioning that new prisoner.
[nearby, Randy has a Jersey man strapped onto a chair]
RANDY
Alright, Mr. Situation, we'll try this again! Why are you people doing this?!
THE SITUATION
Well, I told you, it's, uh, just a Jersey thing. [Randy punches him hard on the left cheek]
RANDY
What does that mean?!
THE SITUATION
You just don't understand. It's, uh, it's just... just a Jersey thing. [Randy punches him again, kicks him with the left foot, punches him with the left hand, kicks him on the side of his head with the right foot]
RANDY
Stop playing stupid!
JIMBO
Maybe he really is stupid, Randy.
RANDY
[shoots back at Jimbo] Nobody's this stupid! [turns to The Situation again] What are you people planning?!
THE SITUATION
It's just a Jersey thing, you know? You...you just gotta be from Jersey to get it. [Randy punches him again with the left hand, kicks him with the left foot, delivers a roundhouse kick with the right foot, flips over him and kicks him on the back of the head]
GERALD
[keeping a lookout atop the barricade] Here they come! [the adults get into position]
SHARON
Is it them, Randy?
RANDY
Yup. They're from Jersey alright.
JERSEY PEOPLE
Yeah! Woo-hoo! Let's go! Yeah!
JERSEY MAN 2
Let's go creepin' in this town!
JERSEY WOMAN
[to another woman] Don't you talk about my family! Don't you talk about my family!
RANDY
This is where we make our stand! South Park will never be West Jersey! [some people cheer]
RANDY
[waves a New Jersey flag but with the "New" crossed out and replaced with a big red "No"] Fuck New Jersey! [some people cheer and begin firing. The advancing Jersey folk begin to fall one by one] Keep shooting! We're sick of you, Jersey!
[Sizzler, night. Screams of children are now heard, and they are trying to hide from Snooki, who is now raping DogPoo]
DOGPOO
[Screaming] Ugh! Ugh! Get it off of me! Get it off of me!
SNOOKI
Snooki wants smoosh smoosh!
STAN
[tries to get out, but finds the doors locked] We gotta find a way past it!
CARTMAN
What does it want?!
BUTTERS
Sounds like it wants smoosh smoosh!
SNOOKI
[leaves DogPoo, reaches Cartman, and starts raping him from behind] Smoosh smoosh! Snooki wants smoosh smoosh!
CARTMAN
No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me!
STAN
Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?
KYLE
Oh, God. [grabs his head and stumbles away, then falls on all fours] Wuh. Aah. [waves his hand at Stan and Kenny] Get out of here!
STAN
[flatly] Why? [Kyle continues writhing and groaning, before throwing his hat away]
KYLE
Agggh! Agggh! [pulls out a tube of gel and puts some on his left hand] No! [quickly greases up his hair, takes off his jacket, rolls up his sleeves, puts on a necklace, combs his hair, puts two rings on his left hand, and writes "KYLeY-B" on his T-shirt]
STAN
..Dude.
KYLE
[approaches Snooki; in Jersey accent] Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!
SNOOKI
Snooki get the smoosh in the... the tenth...
KYLE
You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage! [Snooki babbles and says her name] You've got cabbage in your muff! [Snooki continues babbling] You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! [Snooki continues babbling and Kyle finally fells her with a left hook. Snooki whimpers and escapes through a window. Cartman sobs a bit and puts his pants up]
CARTMAN
[Sniffling] Thank you, Kyle.
[Back at the barricade, Jimbo searches for more ammunition]
JIMBO
That's the last of it! We're out of ammo!
RANDY
Then we've got to start falling back to Utah!
STUART
What's the point? Can't you see it's over? [the sound of roaring jets is heard and grows louder]
JIMBO
Who is that?! [thirteen planes appear over the horizon]
RANDY
It's Al Qaeda! [cheers go up from the crowd. An Al Qaeda pilot salutes from his cockpit. Soon they're diving their planes into the Jersey crowd and killing the Jersey folk] Give 'em hell, Al Qaeda! [More cheers go up from the crowd]
[Park County Community Center, day]
RANDY
On a cold October night, a small town in Colorado stood up to New Jersey and finally said, "Go away!" Our fortitude was the inspiration for others and now, New Jersey is slowly receding back to the desolate land from whence it came. Our country's getting back to normal, and we owe it all to Osama bin Laden. [bin Laden is shown seated on a chair. Cheers go up and Randy places a garland on him, and kisses him on the cheek]
STAN
Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal.
KYLE
Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel.
CARTMAN
Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster. [Pinches Kyle's cheek] But you're my little monster.
STAN
I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling "Muff cabbage," what's muff cabbage?
KYLE
It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing.
RANDY
On this day let us all remember that no people on this earth are really enemies, only folks with differences. [a paratrooper descends from the rafters and quickly kills bin Laden with one shot]
PARATROOPER
[to his pilot] Tango is down, tango is down.
RANDY
We got him!
End of It's a Jersey Thing


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:When Stan is sent to the school counselor because heÂ’s holding on to an obscene number of useless possessions, he realizes that Mr. Mackey has a hoarding disorder too.

script:Insheeption

[South Park Elementary, day. The students are all in the cafeteria eating lunch. In the middle of the cafeteria is a table with the four boys there. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny sit opposite Clyde, Craig, Kevin, and Tolkien.]
CARTMAN
So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy's mouth. [laughs heartily. Butters approaches the table with a sheet of paper]
BUTTERS
Hey, Stan, I have a note for you.
STAN
A note?
BUTTERS
Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this. [hands him the note] I'm like a mailman. [walks away. Stan reads and Kyle notices]
KYLE
What's it say?
STAN
[omitting the names] We need to talk.
CARTMAN
[voice rising in pitch] Ohhhhhhhh. When a chick says "We need to talk.", you might as well just start punching yourself in the balls, dude.
[Two tables over, nine girls are eating lunch. Isla, Red, Wendy, Bebe, and Heidi sit opposite Esther, Anne, Lola, and Millie]
RED
Are you sure he has a problem, Wendy?
WENDY
Yes. I've read all about it. It's a real disease. It's called "hoarding." People who can't throw anything away, and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just can't take it anymore.
STAN
[approaching] Is something wrong, Wendy? [Wendy sees him, then looks at the girls, gets up and walks up to Stan]
WENDY
[sighs] Stan? We need to talk about your locker.
STAN
My locker?
WENDY
[turns away] Every time I see the condition it's in I j-I just wanna cry. It just keeps getting messier and messier. I think you have a problem.
STAN
Are you serious?
WENDY
[turns back] It's so full of junk it takes you forever to find anything. And lately you've been asking to keep things in my locker.
STAN
Well, it's just a little messy.
WENDY
No, Stan, it's called "hoarding"! And if you don't get help, I don't know how much longer I could be with you!
STAN
Aw, come on.
WENDY
Then can we throw some stuff in your locker away?
STAN
Yeah, alright.
WENDY
[wipes a tear from her eye] Okay. [puts a hand on his shoulder] I've hired some experts to help you with this. We'll make this as easy as possible on you, Stan.
[South Park Elementary, hallway. Two men stand by Stan and his locker as the fourth graders look on. One of them holds a large trash bag and is wearing a face mask]
AN EXPERT
Hello everyone, my name is Dr. Chinstrap. I'm a hoarding specialist, and today we're gonna help Stan clean out his locker. Alright, let's go ahead and see inside your locker, Stan. [Stan goes to his locker, opens it, and a few items fall out. The class gasps in horror: Stan's locker is truly packed. Wendy cries and hides her face with her notebook]
STAN
What, come on, it's not that bad.
DR. CHINSTRAP
Now, as part of Stan's therapy, we need to make sure we don't throw away anything he doesn't want us to. Stan needs to feel like he is in control or his psychosis will come out.
STAN
My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away.
DR. CHINSTRAP
[walks up to Stan and gets down on one knee] Okay, great. How about we start with this? [takes a small box out of the locker]
STAN
Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box.
DR. CHINSTRAP
[defers right away, putting a hand up] Okay, okay, we'll put that right here on the floor. Now how about this? [takes out a bent toothbrush] Broken toothbrush.
STAN
Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I-
DR. CHINSTRAP
But it's broken.
STAN
Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I-
DR. CHINSTRAP
[defers right away] Okay, okay. Broken toothbrush is going right here, by the pencil box. [sets it down] Now how about this? [pulls out a clear sandwich bag with rotten food in it] Old sandwich in a baggie filled with maggots.
CLASS
Eeeeewwww! [two more men stand behind the class holding trash bags and wearing face masks]
STAN
Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that.
DR. CHINSTRAP
It's full of maggots, Stan. Can we throw it away?
STAN
Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like-
DR. CHINSTRAP
The maggots are crawling down my hand and biting my wrist, Stan. Can we throw this away?
STAN
Well, I- I guess so, but- [Dr. Chinstrap dumps the baggie into the large trash bag his assistant is holding. The assistant is wearing a facemask] Whoa-whoa-wait, this is all happening a little fast. Can we just slow down? [Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny look at each other worriedly]
DR. CHINSTRAP
Now how about this empty aspirin bottle?
STAN
Well no, don't throw that out.
DR. CHINSTRAP
Can we throw out these wadded up papers, then? [sweeps out a bunch of loose papers. Stan gets alarmed]
STAN
[begins gathering up the papers] No, because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh-! No, don't take my empty bottle-! [takes the bottle from Dr. Chinstrap. The assistant pulls out the baggie] G-give me back my sandwich! [Stan grabs the baggie, then reaches for another loose sheet, when he realizes what he's done. Cartman makes a circle around his right ear with his index finger and whistles a cuckoo tune]
KYLE
[walks up to Stan and puts a hand on his left shoulder] Dude. What's wrong with you?
STAN
I don't... I don't know.
KYLE
Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.
[Mr. Mackey's office, later. Stan is in his office]
MR. MACKEY
Stan, as your counselor, I'm here to help you with whatever problems you might have, m'kay? Now, what is the matter? [before Stan answers, he looks around the office. Mr. Mackey has a lot of junk in there]
STAN
Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... "hoarding."
MR. MACKEY
Hoarding? M'kay, what's that?
STAN
Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?
MR. MACKEY
Hmmm, I haven't heard of that, but it- it definitely sounds bad, m'kay?
STAN
[looks around again] Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about?
MR. MACKEY
Me? ...Like, like what?
STAN
[looks around and picks up an empty milk carton from a box] Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like-
MR. MACKEY
DON'T YOU TOUCH THAT! THAT'S NOT SOMETHING TO THROW AWAY! IF YOU THROW THAT AWAY I WILL RAPE YOU IN THE MOUTH! M'KAY?! I WILL RAPE YOU IN YOUR FUCKING MOUTH! M'KAY?!
[South Park Elementary faculty room. Randy and Sharon are there with Mr. Garrison, Principal Victoria, Dr. Chinstrap, and another expert]
DR. CHINSTRAP
There's no doubt about it. The school counselor here is a Class-5 hoarder. As for your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh, he's easily a Class-3.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
But why is Mr. Mackey doing this now?
SHARON
Yes, our son has always been fairly clean.
DR. CHINSTRAP
We don't know a lot about what causes hoarding, but we do know it often relates to some kind of psychological trauma. If it's okay with you, we'd like to run some tests on the both of them.
SHARON
Is that really necessary for Stan? It's just his locker.
DR. CHINSTRAP
I don't know if you realize how serious locker hoarding is. [turns away] It can lead to room hoarding, then house hoarding. In some cases, people even hoard animals, like cats.
RANDY
Oh yeah. Like that weird guy over on on Burgess Road. That guy, Mr. Yelman. He's been hoarding animals for years now.
DR. CHINSTRAP
Oh no, really?
[A pasture, day. Dr. Chinstrap and his partner are present with Sgt. Yates and an officer]
SGT. YATES
Mr. Yelman, we received some disturbing reports that you might be hoarding sheep.
MR. YELMAN
[a shepherd, or sheep herder, or sheep hoarder] ...Well I, that is I, I-
DR. CHINSTRAP
It's okay, Mr. Yelman, I'm a hoarding specialist. What you have is an illness. [Mr. Yelman doesn't know what they're talking about]
[A lab, later. Stan, Mr. Mackey, and Mr. Yelman are all on couches with electrodes attached to their temples. Dr. Chinstrap is running tests as his partner and Stan's parents watch from an observation room]
PARTNER
Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Dr. Chinstrap is a professional at memory regression. This should prove very helpful.
DR. CHINSTRAP
Alright everyone, we are all here to face the disease of hoarding together. Nothing to be ashamed of, everyone here has the same problem. Whether it's office hoarding, or in the locker, or even the hoarding of animals.
MR. YELMAN
Excuse me, but uh, I am a sheep herder.
DR. CHINSTRAP
It's pronounced "hoarder," and yes you are.
MR. YELMAN
But but I, uh I'm actually herding sheep.
DR. CHINSTRAP
Yes, you are hurting sheep by hoarding them, aren't you? It's good you realize that.
MR. YELMAN
No, but I just thought that-
DR. CHINSTRAP
Now listen: there's a psychological reason you're all doing this, and we're gonna get to the bottom of it. We're gonna do some regression therapy. I'll be taking you deep into your memories, into your past.
MR. MACKEY
M'kay, that that sounds like it could be bad, uh-kay?
DR. CHINSTRAP
Trust me, I know what I'm doing. I want the three of you to relax, and think about... a cloud. A lone cloud... floating... changing... light... cool air... blowing on the cloud. float- [jumps out of his chair suddenly, startling the subjects] WAAH! HAAA! HAAA!
MR. MACKEY
What?! What?! Jesus, what?!
MR. YELMAN
Oh my God!
DR. CHINSTRAP
Sorry, I just got a weird gas bubble for a second. [clears his throat] Anyway, A lone cloud... floating... wisps of cool air... now the cloud is near you, you... you reach out to it.
MR. MACKEY
[stretches his arm out] Mmm-kay...
DR. CHINSTRAP
It's the cloud of your memories, of your past, [focus on Mr. Mackey] ...your childhood perhaps, ...what do you see in the cloud? Who is in the cloud?
MR. MACKEY
Billy, ...Billy Thompson?
[Mackey's memory takes him back to the 1970s, when he was in grammar school. Three kids angrily walk towards him in the hall.]
BILLY
There he is! Hey, Mackey! [Mr. Mackey, talking to two other boys, suddenly drops his books and turns around]
MACKEY
Oh uh, hi Billy. Nice to see ya, m'kay?
BILLY
Come 'ere! [points to the spot where he wants Mackey. Mackey's friends panic and split]
MACKEY
Uh well, actually I need to get home, m'kay? I uh...
BILLY
You snitched and told the principal I was smoking.
MACKEY
Oh well uh, uh... smoking's bad, uhkay? [Billy throws him up against a locker] Huhhhhh!
BILLY
You're gonna die Mackey! [to his friends] Hold his legs! [his friends move in, but Mackey gets loose and runs away, screaming. Mackey rounds a corner, finds a room, and goes in before Billy could catch him. Billy and his friends round the corner and run past the room Mackey entered] Come back here!
MACKEY
[in the darkness, starts to calm down] Okay. Okay, okay okay, it's okay. It's okay. Calm down, okay. Turn on the light. [turns on the light, revealing Stan]
STAN
What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here?
MACKEY
Shh. Be quiet.
MR. YELMAN
'Scuse me, where are we?
MACKEY
Shh. You've gotta be quiet. Billy Thompson's out there.
STAN
What the hell's going on?!
[In the observation room Dr. Chinstrap and his partner analyze some printouts]
DR. CHINSTRAP
What the hell is going on?!
PARTNER
The counselor's flat top readers are calculating with the boy's and the sheep hoarder's.
DR. CHINSTRAP
Oh Jesus.
RANDY
What does that mean?
DR. CHINSTRAP
It means Mr. Mackey's childhood regression dream is... so vivid it actually sucked the other two patients into it.
RANDY
What?!
PARTNER
I'm afraid your son has gone into his counselor's dream.
RANDY
Aw come on, that's stupid. How's that, how's that even possible?
DR. CHINSTRAP
It's not stupid at all! Pinkerton, you explain the logic and I'll provide the background.
PINKERTON
Alright. [walks up to Randy and Sharon] Look, it is possible to enter into someone else's dreams. [Dr. Chinstrap begins a musical accompaniment] Send dream trackers to go into a person's subconscious, like a spy seeing their dreams as they see them. Perhaps even planting ideas. If one person is regressing deeply enough, the dream can actually envelop those dreaming around the first person I talked about who's dreaming! And then, everyone in the dream would be in danger of never coming back. [Dr. Chinstrap ends his accompaniment at the same time]
[Mackey's dream. Mackey runs into his bedroom, which is strewn with toys popular in the '70s.]
MACKEY
Yay, my bedroom! Yep, this is my happy place, m'kay?
STAN
Mr. Mackey.
MACKEY
[sees his Lite Brite, runs to work on it, and sings] Lite Brite, making things with light. What a sight, making things with Lite Brite, m'kay.
STAN
Mr. Mackey, what are you doing?
MACKEY
Well this is a Lite Brite, m'kay. I can make things with light, like um, birds, m'kay, clowns, m'kay.
STAN
Come on, dude, you've gotta wake up!
MACKEY
Oh yeah, my Evel Knievel doll! [goes to his dresser and grabs it] I can take the motorcycle, hm'kay, I put it on this thing, like this. [puts the motorcycle on the little ramp] Okay now crank it back, and now I let go. [releases the motorcycle, which zooms across the room and does a wheelie. Mackey giggles with excitement] Okay. Okay.
STAN
Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me.
MACKEY
Hey, look what's on! It's ZOOM!
MR. YELMAN
Excuse me, I really need to get back to my sheep.
STAN
I'm working on it!
MACKEY
[Singing along with the TV] Write Zoom Z Double O M Box 350 Bos-ton Mass. Oooh two ooone three fouuur, m'kay!
STAN
[walks up to Mackey and turns him around] Dude, please wake up! You're a grown man in a psychiatrist's office! [something hits Mackey's window and he goes to see what it was. He sees Billy on the sidewalk with his friends]
BILLY
You can hide in your house for now, Mackey, but tomorrow is the field trip! Frisco Woods! And I'm gonna do things to you you'll never forget!
MACKEY
No, uh Billy, please, uh-kay? I'm really sorry about the smoking thing, uh.
BILLY
See you in the woods tomorrow, dead man! [walks away with his friends]
MACKEY
[turns away from the window] Oh Jesus...
STAN
Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip?
MACKEY
Yeah, it's probably gonna be bad, m'kay. [looks away]
[The lab. The patients continue dreaming and moaning]
STAN
Oh-Ohhhhhhh.
MR. MACKEY
Ohhhhhhh, m'kay.
[The observation room]
RANDY
What kind of hoarding specialist are you?! You trapped our son in his counselor's subconscious, and now you're saying he could die in there?!
DR. CHINSTRAP
Believe me, this is the last thing I wanted to have happen.
RANDY
That does it! [goes into the lab]
DR. CHINSTRAP
What are you doing?!
RANDY
I'm goin' in! [pulls up a couch next to Stan's] If they're locked into his regression, then maybe I can be too!
DR. CHINSTRAP
Are you crazy?! Mackey is in a very unstable state!
RANDY
Damn your incongruities! [hooks himself up] I'm goin' in after my son!
DR. CHINSTRAP
It's a dream world where Mackey can imagine himself to be anything. It's dangerous!
RANDY
I said get me in there!
DR. CHINSTRAP
Alright, you wanna risk your ass?! Fine! [snaps into a soothing rush job] You see a cloud, it's a fluffy cloud, floating, happy, happy fluffy cloud. You reach out to it.
RANDY
Ahhh.
[Next day, the field trip]
BUS DRIVER
Alright kids, everyone on the bus.
STAN
Wait wait, where the hell are we now?
MACKEY
It's the day of the big field trip.
BILLY
[from the bus window] Come on, Mackey. We're waitin' for ya.
MACKEY
Oh Jesus.
STAN
Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy!
BUS DRIVER
Everyone on the bus now! We're runnin' late!
MR. YELMAN
Excuse me, I'm actually a sheep herder.
DRIVER
It's pronounced "hoarder," young man, and if you are you should talk to the school counselor about it! [shoves him into the bus]
MR. YELMAN
Yes, but I, I'm so- wah- um.
STAN
Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey.
RANDY
Stan? [Stan looks around] Stan!
STAN
Dad? Is that you?
RANDY
Yes, it's me, Stan.
STAN
Where are you?
RANDY
It's me! Up here! [Stan looks up and sees him] I'm a butterfly!
STAN
The hell are you doing, dad?
RANDY
I'm flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings!
STAN
Did you come here to help me?
RANDY
I was gonna, but ooh! This is fun!
STAN
Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality!
RANDY
Butterflies have no concern for such things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterly poon.
STAN
DAD!
[in the lab, Randy is smiling]
RANDY
[moaning happily] Aah ahhh aha ahhh.
STAN
[moaning in frustration] Aaaaaagh!
[The observation room. Pinkerton checks the printouts]
PINKERTON
Uh oh, something's wrong.
DR. CHINSTRAP
What is it?!
PINKERTON
The father. He's gone completely off chart.
SHARON
Off chart? What does that mean?
PINKERTON
We don't even know.
DR. CHINSTRAP
I told him not to go into the dream after his son. He should have waited for the experts to get here.
SHARON
Who are the experts? [five men shooting guns enter the observation room, and one of them goes down with a gunshot wound]
LEONARDO DICAPRIO
Get that door closed! Keep me covered! [the expert in striped shirt shuts the door]
DR. CHINSTRAP
Ah good, you're here.
DICAPRIO
What's the sitch?!
DR. CHINSTRAP
Four people, in there, all stuck in the middle one's dream.
EXPERT 1
We need to move them all to the next dream level before the projections kill them!
SHARON
What next dream level?
DICAPRIO
Alright look. Right now they're all trapped in a dream. [Dr. Chinstrap resumes the accompaniment] We need to go in and put them under so they can go into a dream within a dream.
SHARON
Why?
EXPERT 1
[Black Suit (Arthur)] Because in the dream within a dream we can protect them from getting to limbo.
SHARON
What's that?
EXPERT 2
[in striped shirt (Eames)] Empty scary dreamspace.
SHARON
So like a nightmare?
EXPERT 3
[African-American (Yusef)] No, like a nightmare within a nightmare!
SHARON
Why can't you wake up from that?
EXPERT 1
You can, but someone inside the dream has to kick you awake from the nightmare!
SHARON
That doesn't sound very difficult.
EXPERT 1
It is!
SHARON
Why?
EXPERT 4
Arrgh.
EXPERT 1
We don't have time for this!
SHARON
Uh okay, fine. So you're gonna take my son to a dream within a dream, and then what?
EXPERT 1
Then we go into your husband's dreams!
SHARON
Okaaay...
DICAPRIO
But your husband will think we're in Hasselbeck's dream.
SHARON
Okay, wait. Who's Hasselbeck?
HASSELBECK
I am.
SHARON
Okay. Wait, no. Why do we need a football player?
DICAPRIO
Sometimes, thoughts of my dead wife manifest themselves as trains!
SHARON
Are you all saying that you can go into a dream and take people in that dream into their own dream?
DICAPRIO
Not all the time, just this once. And maybe one other time.
EXPERT 1
It's so complex and cool.
SHARON
Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool! Going to multiple dream levels sounds like a really stupid idea!
DICAPRIO
You just don't get it 'cause you're not smart enough. Let's move! [the five experts and Hasselbeck enter the lab and hook themselves up]
SHARON
Will they be able to wake Mackey up?
DR. CHINSTRAP
If they don't, it'll be the end of Europe as we know it.
SHARON
Why?
DR. CHINSTRAP
Because.
[Frisco Woods, day. The class has arrived at its destination]
RANGER PETE
Hello kids, my name is Ranger Pete.
CLASS
Hi Ranger Pete.
MACKEY
Hi Ranger Pete, m'kay.
RANGER PETE
Today we're gonna be learning all about these amazing evergreens and this fragile ecosystem.
MACKEY
Oh that should be fun, m'kay. [looks at Billy, who looks back and punches his right palm with his left fist. His voice trembles] Ahhhh...
RANGER PETE
But first we have a very special guest. It's Woodsy Owl. [Woodsy !Owl skips into view]
MACKEY
Oh boy! Woodsy Owl!
STAN
Who's that?
MACKEY
"Give a hoot, don't pollute," m'kay.
WOODSY OWL
Hi, I'm Woodsy Owl, remindin' you all to please pick up your trash, and keep our forests clean. In the city or in the woods,
MACKEY
Help keep Americaaa lookin' good, m'kay. [claps] Oh, boy I love that song.
RANGER PETE
Alright kids, time to split up and go into the forest. Let's divide you all up into groups of six.
BILLY
We wanna be in Mackey's group!
MACKEY
Oh no, that that's m'kay. We'll uh we'll get paired with someone else uh.
RANGER PETE
That's fine. You six boys can team up and be our first group in.
MACKEY
Oh no, oh God here it comes, unkay? [Stan looks at the ranger, then hears gunfire, so he turns to see where it's from. The group of experts is seen chasing and shooting at Butterfly Randy]
DICAPRIO
Is this the dream, or the dream within the dream?
EXPERT 2
I think it's the dream inside the Matrix inside the dream!
DICAPRIO
Oh well. Just keep shooting!
STAN
What the fuck?
[The lab. All the patients moan and ahhh]
AN EXPERT
Mommy? Mommy?
[The observation room. Pinkerton, Dr. Chinstrap, and Sharon are now accompanied by several firefighters, and they all observe the patients]
FIRE CAPTAIN
[turns to Dr. Chinstrap] So you're saying that all those people in there are somehow trapped in one person's dream?
DR. CHINSTRAP
Yes, and so that's why I called the fire department. I don't know where else to turn.
FIREMAN 1
But, wait, if those people got stuck in there, why wouldn't we?
PINKERTON
It's very simple: You see, [Dr. Chinstrap provides accompaniment once again] when the dream experts go in, they attempt to take the subject to a dream within a dream.
FIREMAN 1
Like a taco within a taco?
FIRE CAPTAIN
A double-decker taco supreme.
PINKERTON
Exactly. But only dream spies have the ability to go deeper into dream levels, and firemen have the ability to bring ladders into other people's dreams.
FIRE CAPTAIN
Wait wait whoa whoa, how can you take a ladder into a dream? [Dr. Chinstrap continues his accompaniment, this time pulling a lamb by its tail and including its bleat]
PINKERTON
Because the firemen dreams aren't like dreams at all. They're more like a dream within a matrix within a dream.
PIZZA MAN
Somebody order a pizza?
PINKERTON
No.
DR. CHINSTRAP
Probably one of them in the dream.
PIZZA MAN
[determined] Alright, I'm goin' in. [goes into the lab. He goes to the first expert's couch, lays down next to him, and hooks himself up]
PINKERTON
Look, if we can get the fire department into the counselor's dream, then we can jump everyone down at least another six dream levels. That way we'll be in the counselor's deepest level of subconscious.
DR. CHINSTRAP
And it will be like a taco, inside a taco, within a Taco Bell, that's inside a KFC, within a mall, that's INSIDE YOUR BRAIN! [provides his own accompaniment]
[Frisco Woods, a pleasant scene. A butterfly sits on a leaf doing nothing when Randy descends on it and starts humping it. Soon, Mackey runs by and both butterflies fly away separately. Stan and Mr. Yelman chase Mackey]
MACKEY
Aaaaaah! Not again, m'kay! Aaaaaah!
STAN
Mr. Mackey, stop running!
MACKEY
But, but they're gonna kick my butt, m'kay! [stops briefly, then runs again] They're gonna kick it bad!
STAN
Look, dude! [catches up to Mackey and stops him] Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time.
MACKEY
I know what about? I don't remember what they did. I just remember the field trip being really bad, okay.
BILLY
There he is! You can't run forever!
MACKEY
Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god... [Mr. Yelman catches up]
STAN
Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding.
MR. YELMAN
But I literally herd sheep.
STAN
Shut up!
MACKEY
Okay. Okay, I can do this. I'm just gonna stand and, and face what happens, okay?
[The lab. The firemen have hooked themselves up and entered Mr. Mackey's dream.]
PIZZA MAN
Somebody... order pizza? Pizza?
PINKERTON
Mr. Mackey must be dreaming about something extremely traumatic.
DR. CHINSTRAP
Alright, that does it. [goes to the coat hanger and grabs his coat] Get your coat.
PINKERTON
Where are we going?
DR. CHINSTRAP
We need to get help from the most powerful dream infiltrator in the world.
PINKERTON
You don't mean...
[Deep in the woods, day. A small cabin is seen in the distance as three helicopters fly towards it. A familiar bogeyman is shown splitting wood with an axe.]
DR. CHINSTRAP
Hello, Freddy. [the bogeyman turns around and it's Freddy Krueger, now with a full beard and mustache] You're looking healthy.
FREDDY KRUEGER
Chinstrap! What happened? You run out of stoolies to do your work?
DR. CHINSTRAP
Alright, look, we're in a pickle again and we need your help. Got some people trapped inside a dream.
FREDDY KRUEGER
Told you a long time ago: I gave that up. [resumes splitting wood]
DR. CHINSTRAP
There's some good men stuck in there.
FREDDY KRUEGER
[stops and turns around, exasperated] I said I'm done with it! [the cabin door and a woman with two kids appears in the doorway]
WOMAN
Everything all right, Fred?
FREDDY KRUEGER
It's fine, Peg. Get back in the house. [Peg tugs at her kids and they all go back inside]
DR. CHINSTRAP
Wife and kids.
FREDDY KRUEGER
No thanks to you.
DR. CHINSTRAP
We need ya Fred.
FREDDY KRUEGER
Like you needed me to kill those teenagers to stop the Russians?!
DR. CHINSTRAP
We had a country to protect!
FREDDY KRUEGER
Protect it yourselves this time.
DR. CHINSTRAP
Dammit I'm not working for the military anymore, Krueger!
FREDDY KRUEGER
Then you should have no problem covering it up. [resumes splitting wood]
DR. CHINSTRAP
[a few seconds later] Some of those trapped are firemen. Public servants, innocent in all of this.
FREDDY KRUEGER
[stops, sighs, and throws his axe away] Alright, fine.
[Frisco Woods, day. Mackey and Billy finally face off and Mackey is ready to fight]
MACKEY
Alright Billy, I'm not gonna let you hurt me this time, hm'kay? This time I'm gonna stand up for myself!
BILLY
You? Gonna fight back? I don't think so! [Stan and Mr. Yelman look on]
STAN
You can do it Mr. Mackey.
MACKEY
Go ahead and do your worst, Billy. I'm facing you head-on, m'kay?
BILLY
Alright Mackey. Take this. [rears his right arm back and is about to deliver a punch when a gunshot kills him. A second gunshot hits him for good measure. The five experts converge on Billy and his friends and shoot them thoroughly]
DICAPRIO
Get the perimeter secure! Make sure they're dead!
STAN
What the hell?
EXPERT 2
We got 'em! The bad memories are dead.
FIRE CAPTAIN
[through his bullhorn] Alright everyone, this is the fire department. Do not panic.
STAN
Who are you people?
DICAPRIO
We came here to rescue you from the bad guys in Mackey's dream.
STAN
Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own?
EXPERT 1
No. As long as the source of the drama is wiped out, the counselor can wake up.
EXPERT 2
Right. [nothing happens]
STAN
...So then why aren't we waking up?
EXPERT 2
Unless... the bullies aren't the source of the counselor's bad memory.
MACKEY
Hey that's right. The bullies didn't even beat me up that day. I, I ran away from them.
EXPERT 2
[strokes the back of his neck with his left hand] Oh, whoops.
MACKEY
[begins to walk away] I remember. [walks to a small shack nearby] I ran and I ran and I hid in this building here. And somebody was in there. Somebody who talked to me real nice and then... and then touched me somewhere bad. [pushes the door open. Woodsy is molesting the actual boy Mackey]
REAL MACKEY
No Woodsy! Hmkay? Don't touch muh pee pee. No Woodsy, please. I'll give a hoot, hm'kay?
MACKEY
Woodsy Owl! No! I'll never litter again! I'll keep all my trash! No please Woodsy no! [the woods begin to rumble and shake]
FIRE CAPTAIN
What's happening?
EXPERT 2
Dream conundrum. This is bad. [Woodsy breaks through the front wall of the shack with glowing red eyes and roars]
FIRE CAPTAIN
What the hell's going on?
DICAPRIO
The bad memory is manifesting itself! It didn't wanna be exposed! [Woodsy runs towards the group. The experts begin shooting at it and advance, but Woodsy remains unharmed] Our dream bullets don't hurt it. [Woodsy reaches for Mr. Yelman and decapitates him with a swipe of his left wing]
MACKEY
No! No more, Woodsy. [hides his face]
STAN
Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!
EXPERT 1
He can't! Don't you get it?! We're all gonna go to limbo! [Woodsy roars again, and Freddy's blades rip through Woody's back and chest]
FREDDY KRUEGER
There's a real hoot for ya, Woodsy! [pulls his blades out and Woodsy falls down dead]
MACKEY
It's dead... It's finally dead. [grins]
[The observation room. Dr. Chinstrap reads the printouts this time]
DR. CHINSTRAP
Something's happening. I'm getting Bogart levels on all counter ups.
PINKERTON
They're waking up. They're coming to. [enters the lab, and Dr. Chinstrap follows]
[The lab. Everyone is finally out of Mackey's dream]
DR. CHINSTRAP
Ahhh, you're back, everyone! [grins]
RANDY
Aw, dammit. [Sharon is just happy Stan is back as they grin at each other]
FIRE CAPTAIN
Thanks, Freddy.
FREDDY KRUEGER
If only I could have saved the sheep herder.
DR. CHINSTRAP
Well, did you find the painful source of your hoarding problems, Mr. Mackey?
MR. MACKEY
I sure did.
DICAPRIO
Turns out he was molested by Woodsy Owl.
MR. MACKEY
I completely blocked it from my memory, hm'kay?
FIRE CAPTAIN
So, he was hoarding because when he tried to throw things away his subconscious would remember Woodsy's voice saying "Give a hoot, don't pollute" and touching his penis with his wing?
PINKERTON
Wow, that is so complex and trippy and cool!
DR. CHINSTRAP
Well, now that we've uncovered Mackey's source of hoarding, we can finally move on to yours, Stan. Are you ready for your therapy?
STAN
[thinks a moment] I think I have a better idea.
[South Park Elementary, day. Stan is cleaning out his locker. Kyle and Wendy walk up to him]
WENDY
Stan, did you find out the reason you've been hoarding?
STAN
Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with.
KYLE
But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with.
STAN
Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy!
KYLE
How do you know... [this stops Stan cold] that wasn't your therapy? [Dr. Chinstrap walks up and begins his accompaniment...]
End of Insheeption

synopsis:"Coon and Friends" set out to help the victims of BP's latest catastrophic drilling accident in the Gulf. Much to the Coon's dismay, another Super Hero gets there first.

script:Coon 2: Hindsight

[Cartman's basement/The Coon's headquarters, day. A tapestry there now says "COON aND FRiEndS." The camera pans down to show The Coon with seven new superhero friends]
COON
My fellow heroes, tonight I stopped three murders from happening. [begins pacing back and forth] I don't know why, but we're seeing a huge trend in crime. We have to find out the source of this evil. Something big is about to happen, and it is up to Coon and Friends to stop it. [Stan raises his hand] Yes, Toolshed.
TOOLSHED
Why do we have to be called "Coon and Friends"?
COON
[stops] ...What?
TOOLSHED
We all fight crime together. How come we're just your "friends"?
TUPPERWEAR
[steps forward] Yeah. We wanna be called "The Extreme Avenger League."
ALL
Yeah! That's right. Extreme Avenger League!
COON
I told you, TupperWear, Extreme Avenger League doesn't work.
TUPPERWEAR
Why not?
COON
It's confusing! The Coon is a brand people already know.
MOSQUITO
Why can't it be Mosquito and Friends?
COON
Nobody's fucking heard of you, Mosquito!
MOSQUITO
Have, so.
COON
[paces again] Look guys, we need to find out what's causing the crime wave in this city. [stops] Mysterion, you and the Human Kite get on the computer and dig up what you can. TupperWear and Mosquito, scan the news. Toolshed, you run a perimeter check with Iron Maiden.
IRON MAIDEN
Timmeh!
COON
Let's work, people! [the other heroes begin to leave, but Coon holds one back] Uh, Mint-Berry Crunch, could I have a quick word with you in the debriefing chamber? [takes Mint-Berry Crunch to a corner of headquarters, sits behind a desk and sighs] Okay, ummm, I really enjoy having you be a part of Coon and Friends and I certainly appreciate your on-time paying of dues and fees; it's just... I don't... I'm not getting your deal. I mean, exactly what is Mint-Berry Crunch supposed to mean? [Mint-Berry Crunch's jaw drops] I, I get that you're half man and half berry, and that you're... crunchy with some mint, but... to be a part of Coon and Friends, you have to have a clear and more... superhero kind of identity. [Mint-Berry Crunch just looks at himself, then back at Coon] Mint-Berry Crunch, ummm, I'm just wondering if... maybe you need to add something else to the Mint-Berry Crunch part of your costume.
MINT-BERRY CRUNCH
[looks at himself again] Like milk?
COON
[annoyed] No, not like milk! You see, I really think we're on different pages here, Mint-Berry Crunch! It's like you don't even- [an alarm sounds]
ALARM
Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert.
COON
Uh oh! [quickly leaves his chair. The superheroes meet up again in front of a big monitor, which is receiving video in Coon-O-Vision.] What's the alert, Mosquito?
MOSQUITO
There's like a big fire or something in town.
COON
What? A fire? Coon volume up! [grabs the remote and clicks the up arrow for volume]
NEWS 4 REPORTER
There's thought to be at least twenty people trapped inside the apartment building, and firefighters are having no luck.
COON
My God, this is what we've been waiting for! Coon and Friends, let's head out!
COON'S FRIENDS
Let's do it! Yeah! Let's go! [they begin to head out, but Cartman stops Mint-Berry Crunch again]
COON
Yeah, uhh, Mint-Berry Crunch, why don't you stay here and mind the place, okay? Kewl. [Mint-Berry Crunch stays behind as the others leave]
[Cartman's house, moments later. The boys come out of the basement]
COON
We've got to get downtown fast, Coon Friends! [walks up to Liane, who's sitting on the sofa reading a book, and stops] Mom, you've gotta drive us downtown!
LIANE
Ohh, it's a little late, sweetie. Why don't you boys just keep playing downstairs?
COON
Mom, you're the Coon's faithful butler! I wanna go downtown now!
LIANE
Well, all right. [puts down her book and blanket] I guess I can get some groceries anyway. [rises and leads the boys out to the car]
[Liane's car]
COON
Into the Coon Mobile, everyone! Let's just hope we get there in time! [everyone gets in]
LIANE
All right, are you little munchkins buckled up for safety?
COON
Mom, don't talk to us like that! We're fucking superheroes!
LIANE
[bangs the center armrest with her right fist] Eric, what have we talked about with that language?! One more time and I'm not taking you anywhere!
COON
[exasperated] Oh... I'm sorry Mom, can we go please? [Liane starts the car, and under his breath Coon says] Unbelievable! [crosses his arms]
[Downtown. Fire trucks are everywhere and a few hoses fight the fire. Police are also present]
FIREMAN
We tried gettin' in through the back; it was no good!
FIRE CAPTAIN
Those people are gonna die if we don't do something!
LIANE
[pulls up] Oh my goodness, it's a fire. [the boys leave the car]
COON
Come on, Coon Friends!
LIANE
No- Eric, stay in the car, sweetie!
FIRE CAPTAIN
Can we try a helicopter?
FIREMAN
The winds are too high. The chopper would burn in minutes. [Coon and Friends walk up next to the firemen]
COON
All right, what seems to be the problem?
FIRE CAPTAIN
Get back, kids. It isn't safe.
LIANE
[walks around looking for Cartman] Eric, poopsie?
COON
Whatever's happening, you need help from the Coon!
MOSQUITO
And friends!
FIRE CAPTAIN
Keep those children back, Thompson! [Liane finds the boys and walks up to them]
COON
Please sir, you must let us-
LIANE
Sweetie, let the nice firemen do their job.
COON
Shut! Up! Mom! God!
OFFICER
Wait. Look! Up in the sky!
FIREMAN
It's him! My God, it's really him!
FIRE CAPTAIN
He's come to help us. Captain Hindsight! [in the distance a superhero flies towards the town. He's wearing red and yellow tights and a black cope with a blue eye on it - looking behind]
STAN
Who's Captain Hindsight?
ANNOUNCER
Captain Hindsight, the hero of the modern age. [a series of comic book pictures follows] Once known as Jack Brolin, a reporter for the national news, the hero was born when a freak accident gave him the amazing power of extraordinary hindsight. From toxic spills to unjust wars there is no task too large for... Captain Hindsight! [the hero descends and lands next to the firemen]
FIRE CAPTAIN
Captain Hindsight, thank God you've come!
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
What's the skinny?
FIREMAN
There's people trapped in that burning building, Captain Hindsight. And the fire is so massive we can't get to them.
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
Hmmm... You see those windows on the right side? They should have built fire escapes on those windows for the higher floors, then people could have gotten down. And then on the roof: they should have built it with a more reinforce structure, so a helicopter could have landed on it.
FIREMAN
Yes, of course.
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
And then you see that building to the left?
FIRE CAPTAIN
Yes.
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
They shouldn't have built that there. Because now you can't park any fire trucks where you really need to. [stands up tall] Well, looks like my job here is done. Goodbye everyone! [takes off]
FIREMAN
Thank you, Captain Hindsight!
OFFICER
Thank youuu!
FIRE CAPTAIN
All right everyone, I guess that's it. Let's pack it up. [the firemen and officers quickly pack up and leave, but the building keeps burning. Coon and Friends can only watch helplessly as trapped residents scream.]
[The Marsh house, dinner time. The family is eating quietly]
RANDY
Whoa, boy, did you hear about that fire downtown, Sharon?
SHARON
Oh my gosh, yes! They said like 14 people died.
RANDY
It's just ridiculous to me that they didn't build fire escapes on those upper floors! Ridiculous!
SHARON
Oh I know, and if you ask me, they should've built a roof with enough support to land a helicopter.
RANDY
I mean, hello!
STAN
Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.
RANDY
Why yes, Stan. Captain Hindsight is our protector and guardian. We're just thankful he was there for that fire. And now we can all eat in peace. [an alarm sounds]
ALARM
Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert. [they look around for the source of the alarm, then get up and enter the living room]
RANDY
What the hell is that? [they stop in front of the alarm] Who put that there?
ALARM: ALERT
Seriously. All Coon Friends to base. Alert, you guys. I'm seriously.
STAN
[backs up towards the stairs] Mom, Dad? I I finished dinner. Can I go up to my room?
SHARON
[distracted] Well sure, Stan. [Stan goes upstairs] Wha- How did that thing get there, Randy?
RANDY
I don't know.
SHARON
Well take it down. It's noisy.
RANDY
I can't. I don't know what happened to all my tools. [the alarm stays on as they look at each other in wonder.]
[The Coon's headquarters, day. Toolshed enters the basement, revving his drill]
COON
Alright, Toolshed is here. We can start.
TOOLSHED
Dude, who said you could put a big siren in my parents' house?
MOSQUITO
Yeah, I almost got in trouble for it.
COON
The Coon must be able to signal his friends when a huge catastrophe breaks out.
TUPPERWEAR
So what's the huge catastrophe?
COON
What's the huge-? Did you guys not see that Captain Hindsight guy?!
THE HUMAN KITE
Yeah, so?
COON
So there's a big superhero out there doing stuff on his own and he's NOT part of Coon and Friends!
TOOLSHED
Oh Jesus...
COON
[walks up to a hidden computer, which is actually a prop] I've looked into it and this Captain Hindsight is everywhere. He's like some freelance butthole scab. We need to make him join us!
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Hey fellas? [the boys turn to see him] Fellas, could you let me out please? It uh it's been like six days. [he's in the Coon's holding cell, with a light outside by which he could see.]
COON
You aren't going anywhere, Chaos!
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Yeah, but uh, but uh youuu, but you only gave me this bucket to poop in and it's full now. [pulls the bucket into view] And I ain't got nothin' to eat.
COON
You've got poop, don'tcha? [goes back to the other boys] Now the question is, how are we gonna get Captain Hindsight to join Coon and Friends?
MYSTERION
Who cares if a hero doesn't want to be part of Coon and Friends?
COON
I CARE!
MYSTERION
Look, all we need to do is wait for the next disaster, then try to beat Hindsight to the scene.
COON
There's not gonna be any worse disaster. What could possibly be worse than a fire that kills fourteen people?!
[Marine Sanctuary, day. A pelican rests on a sign at the end of a string of buoys. It takes off as a huge freighter floats by and breaks the string in two. It's a BP Oil ship]
BP MAN 1
All right, this looks like a jolly good place.
BP MAN 2
Yes. Let's let her rip. [a crane operator pulls some levers, releasing a cable which enable a giant drill to descend into the water. The drill hits the sea bottom and all the marine animals there scatter.]
BP MAN 3
That's it, lads. Collect that oil! [the drill hits some rock and shakes from the impact]
BP MAN 4
Uh oh! [oil begins to ooze out of the hole into the ocean. It quickly reaches the surface and lots of dead fish pop up immediately] Oh deah.
BP MAN 3
Oh, don't tell me we did it again?
[The McCormick house, night. Stuart and his wife are in bed asleep; their bedroom window is open. An alarm goes off and they jump out of bed, frightened]
ALARM
Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert. [they exit the room and see the alarm in the hallway] All Coon Friends report to base. I'm so seriously. Emergency. Coon and Friends alert. [Kenny appears and is ready to go. He turns away and is carrying a small back pack over his right shoulder. He goes to a far window and climbs out]
[The Coon's headquarters. The Human Kite, Mysterion, Mint-Berry Crunch, and Mosquito enter it and come down the stairs]
COON
Good, you're all here. Take a look at this. Coon volume up! [raises the volume. On screen is the BP oil spill]
[The Gulf, in Coon-O-Vision]
REPORTER
It's a scene of utter despair and catastrophe. Oil from the ocean is spill out out of control, and the rescue effort seems futile.
MAN
It's horrible. We can't stop the oil from contaminatin' everything.
WOMAN
Our home is covered in sludge. Where are we supposed to go?
CAJUN SHRIMP MERCHANT
Git a lookie on mah scrimp heuh! Might as give ya the best scrimp this side of Louisiana and now down tuh where we all got up in our scrimp, and it ain't worth a slimy noob it ain't sold on. There, now lookit all the url on mah scrimp!
[Coon Headquarters]
MYSTERION
My God! Another oil spill could mean absolute devastation for the Gulf!
THE HUMAN KITE
We've got to help those people!
COON
Yes. This is definitely a job for Coon and Friends.
MINT-BERRY CRUNCH
Let's pack the Gulf full of flavor! [Cartman looks at him in disbelief]
[The Gulf. As rescuers clean up as best they can, one of them looks up in the sky]
RESCUER 1
[a woman] Wait a minute. Look! It's Captain Hindsight! [Captain Hindsight flies towards the rescuers and they begin cheering]
COON
Oh no!
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
What seems to be the problem?
RESCUER 2
It's that BP Oil rig, Captain Hindsight. It drilled into a marine sanctuary and the environment is being poisoned.
RESCUER 3
If we can't stop it, the spill could reach New Orleans.
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
[thinks] Hmm... All right. You see where that rig is drilling?
RESCUER 3
Yes.
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
It's in too deep of water. They shouldn't have drilled in that deep of water, because now they can't get machines deep enough to fix the spill!
RESCUER 2
Aha!
RESCUER 4
Yesss, YESSS.
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
Now, if it's a valve that ruptured, then what they should have done is installed the backup valve in case that valve broke.
RESCUER 2
I believe they did install a backup safety valve, Captain Hindsight.
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
[thinks] Hmmm... Right. Then they should have had a backup safety valve to that backup safety valve!
RESCUER 5
My God, he's right!
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
My work here is done! I'm off to fine others in need!
RESCUER 4
God bless you, Captain Hindsight! God bless you!!
[Coon Headquarters]
COON
Goddammit! We have got to get that guy into Coon and Friends!
[Jack Brolin's mansion, day. Cartman, dressed in a business suit, rings the bell by the front door]
BUTLER
[answering the door] Can I help you?
CARTMAN
I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives?
BUTLER
Yes?
CARTMAN
I need to speak with him, please.
BUTLER
The captain is very busy dealing with the Gulf oil crisis.
CARTMAN
I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir.
BUTLER
Mr. Hindsight, sir. [Hindsight sits behind his desk looking at three monitors with 12 screens each. He turns around at the mention of his name] This young man would like a word.
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
Please, sit down. What can I do for you?
CARTMAN
Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people, [sets his briefcase on the table and opens it] and I've been asked to give you some really exciting news. [takes out an application to join Coon and Friends and hands it to Hindsight] You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends.
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
[takes the application] Of what?
CARTMAN
I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you.
OFFICER 2
[from one of the 36 screens] Captain Hindsight? Captain Hindsight, please come in! [Hindsight walks over to see what the matter is]
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
Go ahead.
OFFICER 2
The oil keeps coming out! We've got other rigs now catching fire!
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
Listen! They should have hosed down the other rigs as soon as the spill began, and that wouldn't have happened.
OFFICER 2
Right. [salutes] Thank you! [Hindsight salutes back. Another screen comes on to his right]
FIREMAN 2
Captain Hindsight! The dolphins that those volunteers cleaned of oil, they, they're all dying!
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
Get down to the volunteers and tell them they should have used a non-bleaching cleanser! Commissioner!
COMMISSIONER
Yes?
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
Tell Brett Favre he should have never sent actual pictures of his schlong! [the screen the commissioner was on switches over to Santa Monica Pier as Hindsight shows his fatigue] It's not a blessing, it's a curse.
CARTMAN
[waits a few seconds, then] ...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away.
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
Look, I'm sorry kid, but I work alone.
CARTMAN
Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
Get this kid out of here! I have to think!
CARTMAN
[gathers the form and puts it back in the briefcase] Fine! You'll be hearing from my lawy- the Coon's lawyer, sir! [walks away]
[BP Crisis special report]
ANCHOR MAN
The BP Oil spill in the Gulf continues to get worse every day. As public anger towards the BP Company grows, their president released this statement:
[A BP oil rig]
TONY HAYWARD
[a soft acoustic guitar begins to play] Hello, I'm Tony Hayward, president and CEO of BP. Our accidental drilling spill again in the Gulf is a tragedy that should have never happened. And to all those affected, I want to say, we are deeply sorry. [switch to camera 2 to his left, and he turns to look at it] We're sorry. [on the tundra dressed in winter gear, stroking a baby arctic seal] We're sorry. [in the kitchen with an apron on, taking a tray of chocolate chip cookies from the oven] We're sorry. [skis towards the camera and stops] Sorry. [back on the oil rig] BP has taken full responsibility for cleaning up this spill in the Gulf, and in doing so, we've changed our name from Beyond Petroleum, to Dependable Petroleum. [a shot of the Earth and Moon in an interesting configuration. The Earth has two drills attached to it, the Moon has large creators that look similar to a face, and clouds look similar to flailing arms] We no longer fuck the earth, we DP it.
[Coon Headquarters. The Coon has his friends gathered around his Coon table. "QUIET. COON-FERENCE IN SESSION"]
COON
Gentlemen, my attempts to recruit Captain Hindsight into Coon and Friends have been unsuccessful, but I believe I've come up with a solution. Coon Vision on! [a projector screen is shown, as is the projector on the table. Pictures begin to appear on screen] All we need to do is get pictures of Captain Hindsight naked with Courtney Love. Then we'll tell him if he doesn't join us, we'll put them on the Internet.
TOOLSHED
How do we get pictures of him naked with Courtney Love?
COON
Simple, Toolshed. Coon slide 2? [the next slide clicks into place] We dress Professor Chaos up as Courtney Love, take pictures of him naked with a homeless guy, then photoshop Hindsight's face onto it.
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Me?? Awww, come on, fellas, don't make me be Courtney Love.
COON
Gotta get to work fast, people! Coon and Friends, ho!
MOSQUITO
...You want us to take naked pictures of Butters to use as blackmail? That doesn't sound very superhero-like.
COON
That's because you think small, Mosquito! You have a tiny little mosquito brain, that's why you don't come up with the plan!
MOSQUITO
Nono, look. what's going on down in the Gulf is much more important than blackmailing another hero.
MYSTERION
Agreed.
COON
Oh who cares about some oil spill environment crap?!
TOOLSHED
Mosquito has a good plan, Cartman! Hear him out!
COON
You don't know that I'm Cartman because my true identity is secret!
MYSTERION
We all have a say in this organization, Coon! Let Mosquito talk!
COON
[grudgingly] All right, Mosquito, how do you wanna help people suffering in the Gulf crisis? [crosses his arms]
MOSQUITO
I think we should help raise money for the relief aid by having a bake sale.
COON
[challenging] A bake sale?
MOSQUITO
I have a recipe for lemon bars from my mom. We could wear our costumes outside the grocery store and sell lemon bars. Which would be a good deed, and help people.
COON
We're superheroes, not the fucking Girl Scouts!
MYSTERION
Those people down there need help! Sometimes being a hero means helping in smaller ways.
IRON MAIDEN
Timmeh!
COON
[challenging] You think selling lemon bars is helpful to mankind?
MINT-BERRY CRUNCH
More helpful than taking naked pictures of Butters.
COON
Shut up, Mint-Berry Crunch! You aren't even anything!
MOSQUITO
And that's another thing: no more picking on Mint-Berry Crunch!
COON
Oh, what are you, the boss now?!
MOSQUITO
No, but we are all equal! From now on, we vote! Who wants to go with my plan? [everybody but Coon raises a hand. The Iron Maiden lifts a sword]
COON
[crosses his arms again, sarcastic] Sounds awesome. Let's do it.
TOOLSHED
To the grocery store!
[A street in the neighborhood. Coon leads his friends down the street. A classical piece plays as the boys are shown in slow motion.]
COON
[thinking] As we walked along the road to the grocery store, my Coon sense started tingling. Something was wrong. Very wrong. I've learned to trust my Coon sense. It has always been my guide. And so I knew I must act. A coon must know when to defend itself. [Coon turns to his right and high-kicks Mospuito on the cheek. Mosquito goes up in the air and bounces on the road. Coon kicks him in the balls and leaps at him, and grins. He spreads his claws out and slashes Mosquito on the left temple. Mint-Berry Crunch moves to intervene while Coon continues to rake Mosquito across the face. Coon notices Mint-Berry Crunch coming to Mosquito's aid and slashes him too.]
[A dinner, later. Coon and his friends are seated around a large table. Mosquito and Mint-Berry Crunch are battered and bruised. Mosquito's vuvuzela snout is crimped]
COON
[after a while] Well, now we're back to normal. [smiles] Just like before and all forgotten? Right right?
MINT-BERRY CRUNCH
[defeated] Right right.
MOSQUITO
[defeated] Right.
COON
Keewwwl! So what's next for Coon and Friends? [no one says a word, and Coon takes a sip of his soda]
[Another BP Crisis special report]
ANCHOR MAN
Another crisis in the Gulf of Mexico as the oil company DP has once again made a huge error. [a glowing plasma seeps out of a big hole while strange creatures float and walk out of there] This time, the oil company has accidentally ripped a hole into another dimension. [beachgoers run for their lives as a many-mouthed three-legged creature lumbers by. A flying creature drops down on a woman, scoops her up in its tentacles, and rips her in two at the waist. Other winged creatures swoop in and abduct other beachgoers. Different creatures walk by the pier and scoop up visitors there, then drop them into open mouths that look like Venus fly traps] The oil company stated that it knew a portal to another dimension was there, but didn't think drilling into it would prove problematic. [two men are fishing when another creature pops up and eats them] Now hundreds of creatures from another dimension are spilling out into our reality and wreaking havoc. [a giant starfish creature sits on the pier floor when a man gets curious and leans in. It snaps shut, leaving him headless. Everyone else jumps back and a woman screams]
[Hayward's BP oil rig]
TONY HAYWARD
[a soft acoustic guitar begins to play] Hello, I'm Tony Hayward, CEO of DP. Tearing a hole into another dimension is a tragedy that should have never happened. And as CEO, I would like to say... We're sorry. [sitting in an armchair by the fireplace stroking a sleeping lap puppy] We're sorry. [sitting in a prairie holding a dandelion] We're sorry. [blows the seeds off the dandelion stem. Next, he's in bed looking up somewhat seductively] Sohr-ry.
[Jack Brolin's mansion, day. Captain Hindsight is at his desk looking glum.]
BUTLER
[appears] Captain Hindsight! Sir! Calls for help are pouring in! You've got to get out to the Gulf!
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
I can't help anyone right now! Something came up.
BUTLER
What, sir? You know you can tell me.
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
Do you remember last week when I... got really really drunk?
BUTLER
Yes sir.
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
Look at those photos on the desk. [the butler walks up to the desk and looks at the photos. The first one is Butters as Courtney Love posing for the camera and the homeless man standing on a stool behind him naked, with Hindsight's face photoshopped onto him. Next, it's Butters on the stool with the homeless man standing behind him. Next, it's Butters posing for the camera and standing on the homeless man's back]
BUTLER
My God, is that you and... Courtney Love?
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
'Course it's Courtney Love!
BUTLER
But when did you have a-
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
I don't remember! That's just the point! I get drunk, I don't remember things! I shouldn't have drank that much, and I shouldn't have mixed alcohols! Alcohol shouldn't be legal! Oh it's maddening!
BUTLER
That doesn't matter now, sir! People are getting hurt in the Gulf and they need to know what they could've done!
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
I should have never kept that bottle of Macallan in the pantry! I should have never gotten around Courtney Love and a camera. I should-

Sir! SIR!
[Another BP Crisis special report, continued]
REPORTER
Creatures from another dimension continue to wreak havoc in the Gulf, and the question everyone is asking is, "Where is Captain Hindsight?"
RESCUER 6
Where are you, Captain Hindsight?
CAJUN SHRIMP MERCHANT
Where are d'you countih ninety-oh bebbly now is showmesitchcum.
REPORTER
With Captain Hindsight missing, what superheroes can save the Gulf now?
[Coon Headquarters. The Coon has his friends gathered around his Coon table. His smear campaign is a complete success]
COON
My fellow superheroes, I have done it. Hindsight is taken care of. And now the country can finally be made aware of Coon and Friends!
TOOLSHED
There's more important things to discuss right now!
COON
Right, Toolshed. Now, how do we deal with these creatures from another dimension?
MYSTERION
He means we need to discuss things with you!
COON
Okay, what?
MYSTERION
Aw, I don't wanna tell him. TupperWear, you tell him!
TUPPERWEAR
I don't wanna tell him either.
THE HUMAN KITE
I'll tell him. Coon, I'm sorry, but we're kicking you out of Coon and Friends.
COON
You're kicking me out of Coon and Friends.
TOOLSHED
We all voted, it was unanimous.
COON
You can't kick me out of Coon and Friends, I'm the fucking Coon!
THE HUMAN KITE
Look, we just believe that you have your goals and ways of doing things and they conflict with what we want to accomplish.
MYSTERION
But we get the headquarters and all the equipment.
COON
You don't keep anything! This is my basement and I'll tell my mom on you guys!
MYSTERION
We've already discussed this with her. Mrs. Cartman? [she walks in and approaches Mysterion]
LIANE
Yes, Mysterion?
MYSTERION
Please escort the Coon out of our secret base.
LIANE
[takes Coon away from the table and up the stairs] Eric, I talked to you about beating up your friends, didn't I?
COON
Mom, what the fuck?! The fuck are you doing?!
[upstairs. Liane takes Coon out of the basement and shuts the door. Coon tries to get back in, but can't]
LIANE
Eric, you do not beat up your friends! And I told you I've had it with your language! [crosses her arms] Your punishment is that your friends will just play superheroes without you! Go to your room!
COON
[incredulous] You've gotta be fucking kidding me!
[The DP boardroom, day.]
DP EXECUTIVE 1
Oh dear, we have certainly pooped our trousers this time!
TONY HAYWARD
Yes, I'm afraid it's going to take more than another "I'm sorry" campaign to please everyone this time.
DP EXECUTIVE 2
Oh, what a right pickle we're in. [a flying creature floats up past the windows carrying a screaming man]
DP EXECUTIVE 3
There is no way to cut the dimensional portal, I'm afraid. The ocean currents and swells are simply too much to get any machines in.
TONY HAYWARD
Wait a tick! [rises] Currents and swells, that's it! I think I know how to fix this!
DP EXECUTIVE 4
How, by Jove?
TONY HAYWARD
We drill.
DP EXECUTIVES
Drill of course, yes, yes, of course.
TONY HAYWARD
I believe that if we drill on the moon, changing its gravitational pull on our ocean swells, we could cut the dimensional spill.
DP EXECUTIVE 5
I don't quite get it.
TONY HAYWARD
We got into this mess by drilling heuh [the Gulf of Mexico], and heuh [somewhere in Peru]. Now, we need to drill heuh! [draws a drill bit entering the moon]
DP EXECUTIVE 6
That looks extremely promising!
TONY HAYWARD
Our environment should stabilize if it's getting drilled here, here, and here at the same time.
DP EXECUTIVE 6
The seismic forces will be massive. Do you think the moon can take it?
TONY HAYWARD
[arms crossed] Oh, she'll take it.
[A launch pad, day. A DP rocket takes off]
[The moon. DP's newest rig is now up and running as DP astronauts spread out from the rig. Nearby are the bodies of Willzy-x and Tom Cruise]
ANCHOR MAN
The DP Oil Company today drilled into the moon and appears to have caused even greater problems.
STAN
Uh oh, I have a feeling we'd better get into our costumes again, guys.
[News 4 Breaking News: DP unleashes Cthulhu]
REPORTER
Tom, the DP Oil Company has had another drilling accident. [Cthulhu appears looming over the oil rig in the Gulf] This time they appear to have unleashed the dark and mighty Cthulhu. [Cthulhu swats a helicopter down with just a gentle wave of his right arm] The rise of Cthulhu from another dimension brings about three thousand years of darkness, Tom, where we will all be driven to madness and made to service Cthulhu's cult as slaves. The president of DP Oil released this press statement:
TONY HAYWARD
[a soft acoustic guitar begins to play. First, Hayward is at his ranch looking at some horses. He turns around and faces the camera] As president of DP Oil, I want to say... We're sorry. [in the bathroom shaving] I'm deeply sorry. [naked on a bear rug before a fireplace, his butt cheeks rosy-red] Sorry.
REPORTER
Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn. Praise the dark Cthulhu, long may he reign.
STAN
It's up to us, guys. Let's get to the Gulf! [the seven suit up and leave the house. Mysterion goes to the camera and covers it with his cape]
[Cartman's room, night. Cartman is dressed as the Coon and stands in the window looking out over the backyard]
CARTMAN
[voice over] Darkness has taken over our town. The Coon and Friends have given in to evil. It's up to the Coon to stop them.
CARTMAN
Asshoooles! [leaps out of window]
End of Coon 2: Hindsight


<|endoftext|>

synopsis:MysterionÂ’s true identity is revealed. Meanwhile, the Coon, scorned by his fellow super heroes, is out for revenge.

script:Mysterion Rises

[VCI Goes A Bg on it then A comic book appears from Komik Faktory Press. Mysterion. The cover has him dropping down from the sky ready for action. Mysterion's voice is heard]
MYSTERION
I am Mysterion. Though only nine years old, I dedicate my life to helping people - when I'm not in school. [the book opens to a random page. On that page he is defeating Professor Chaos] For months now I've been protecting my town from crime. But now, something has happened that even I cannot fight alone. [a picture of the oil rig, updating every few seconds to show the spread of the oil slick] The BP Oil Company has drilled and caused a spill in the Gulf like no other. The President of BP apologized.
TONY HAYWARD
[on the rig] We're sorry.
MYSTERION
But they drilled again, and tore open a portal into another dimension.
TONY HAYWARD
[in the field, reclining for the camera] We're sorry. [some pages flip over and various creatures are shown]
MYSTERION
Creatures from that dimension are now wreaking havoc in the Gulf. BP tried to solve the problem by drilling on the moon, but instead they caused the dark lord Cthulhu to emerge.
TONY HAYWARD
[on the bear rug by the fireplace, naked, on his belly] Sorry. [next page has the Coon and Friends as they burst forth from headquarters. Mosquito and Human Kite are shown flying.]
MYSTERION
I have joined forces with other superheroes in my neighborhood to help save the Gulf. But even the other heroes do not know that unlike them, I do have a power. A power they will now begin to understand. And all will know who and what I truly am! [a swarm of ?'s flies around the screen, and the name of the episode appears]
[Food for Little, day. The little superheroes are at two tables selling lemon bars. Five for $3]
WOMAN 1
Just terrific what you boys are doing.
MYSTERION
Thank you, ma'am.
MAN 1
[holding some bars] I'll take twenty lemon bars, you little rascals.
FIELD REPORTER
A terrific human interest story here, Tom. As America wonders what happened to Captain Hindsight, some Colorado kids are being a little "superhuman" themselves. They call themselves "Coon and Friends," and they've been baking and selling lemon bars to help aid those affected in the Gulf crisis.
MYSTERION
We believe that every little bit helps.
FIELD REPORTER
Their little "super club" consists of seven young heroes. [the boys each strike a pose as they announce themselves]
TOOLSHED
Toolshed!
HUMAN KITE
The Human Kite!
MYSTERION
Mysterion!
TUPPERWEAR
TupperWear!
MOSQUITO
Mosquito!
IRON MAIDEN
Timmah!
MINT-BERRY CRUNCH
Mint Berry Crrrunch! [twirls around]
FIELD REPORTER
The boys stated that there used to also be a hero named The Coon actually in the group, but they let him go because he was being quote, [reads from his cue card] "a dick".
TOOLSHED
Mysterion, if Cartman's gone, why are we still calling ourselves Coon and Friends?
MYSTERION
Because it pisses Cartman off beyond belief, and I find that [chuckles] extremely funny.
[An airport lobby. Cartman awaits his flight with several other people. The group is waiting at Gate 34.]
CLERK
Passengers waiting for flight 73 to New Orleans, we thank you for your patience, but the conditions in the Gulf are still delaying our departure. Unfortunately, we've just been informed that the dark lord Cthulhu has shat on the runway at the New Orleans airport, and we'll be delayed at least another hour.
PASSENGERS
Awwww!
COON
Come on, people! Some of us need to get to New Orleans NOW! [the other passengers look at him] Yes yes, I am the Coon.
BLONDE GIRL
The Coon? I've heard of that.
COON
Ya have?
BLONDE GIRL
I saw on TV. That superhero group that's helping with the Gulf spill. Coon and Friends.
COON
Actually, I'm no longer with Coon and Friends. I work on my own now.
BLONDE GIRL
Can I ask you a question?
COON
Yes, of course.
BLONDE GIRL
Do you know Mint-Berry Crunch? What's he like? [Coon glares at her and then punches her out of her seat. He then pounces on her and begins to beat her up. A man comes to pull Coon off the girl, and she gets to punch him back. In comic book form, the man says "That's it, Coon!" while others cheer, "GO COON!"]
COON
[explains what's happening in the panels. He imagines her as bigger than him] The evil girl villain fought with all her might, but the Coon was too much for her. As people looked on and cheered for the Coon, he clawed and punched the villain's stupid fat face! ["TAKE THAT YOU EVIL BITCH"] This fight would not be the last the Coon fought. Next stop: New Orleans!
[Food for Little, day. The little superheroes are at two tables selling lemon bars, but there are a few bars left.]
MOSQUITO
That's almost it, superheroes. We're about out of lemon bars.
TOOLSHED
Well then, perhaps we should return to our secret base and bake some more!
IRON MAIDEN
Timmah! [a man with a creepy fixed grin approaches them]
MAN 2
I'll take ten lemon bars.
MOSQUITO
Ten. Yes sir! [takes the man's cash and gives him the remaining bars]
HUMAN KITE
That's definitely the last of them.
MAN 2
You'll never stop him, you know. [Mosquito and Mint-Berry Crunch look at each other in foreboding music]
MOSQUITO
Stop who?
MAN 2
The Great One. [his head sways back and forth as he speaks] Cthulhu. He has risen, and soon all will be under his rule. It has all been foretold in the Necronomicon. [takes his bars, turns around and walks away. He looks back briefly] Hail Cthulhu! The darkness of the mythos is finally here. [samples one of the bars] Oh man, these are really good lemon bars. [turns around and goes to his car]
TOOLSHED
The Necronomicon?
TUPPERWEAR
What's a mythos?
MYSTERION
I don't know, but I think we'd better find out.
TOOLSHED
All right, superheroes. Back to our secret base!
MINT-BERRY CRUNCH
Mint-Berry Crrunch!
[Coon and Friends secret base, former Coon headquarters, Cartman's basement. The superheroes rush in to find it in ruins]
TUPPERWEAR
What the hell?!
MOSQUITO
I knew it! Cartman tore our base up!
MYSTERION
Not Cartman.
HUMAN KITE
What do you mean "Not Cartman," dude?
MYSTERION
Whoever did this to our base was looking for something.
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
[silhouette, holding a gun] Don't anybody move! [comes into the light, drunk] So you're the superheroes trying to blackmail me!
TOOLSHED
Aw, dude, it's Captain Hindsight.
NARRATOR
Captain Hindsight, [the captain takes a sip of Macallan] the hero of the modern age. Once a reporter for the National News, Jack Brolin always had a knack for hindsight. ["Perhaps they should have called the police sooner"] Wanting to become the best-known reporter in the country, Jack tried an experiment to boost his hindsight levels. But then a freakish accident occurred when a retroactive spider got into the equipment. The reporter's hindsight was blasted to superhuman levels! ["It's too much!" He holds his head together. "I shouldn't have done that!"] For months he was able to use his new powers for good, fighting for peace, and the American way. [a panel shows him helping firefighters] With his three trusty companions, Shoulda, Coulda, and Woulda. [three creatures with only hind legs and lower lips thrust out] But now, the Hindsight that has saved so many threatens to consume Jack's very soul. It's Captaiiin Hindsight!
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
I shoulda never mixed vodka and Jack Daniels. I shoulda just gone to bed last night!
TOOLSHED
Um dude, are you okay?
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
[cocks and aims his pistol at the boys] Where are the pictures?! Give every copy of the pictures to me NOW!
MINT-BERRY CRUNCH
P-p-please sir, w-we don't know what you mean.
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
[whips out the pictures mailed to him] You got pictures of me having sex with Courtney Love!
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Uhhh ohhh...
MYSTERION
Chaos! Why did you take those pictures?!
PROFESSOR CHAOS
But uh, but, but the Coon said if I took the pictures he, he'd let me go home and, and I've missed four days of school now 'cause I've been-
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
Alright enough! What's going on?!
MYSTERION
Hindsight, that isn't Courtney Love! Our former member, the Coon, tricked you!
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
It's not Courtney Love?
MYSTERION
Please sir, put down the gun.
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
No! What if I put down the gun and realize I shouldn't have?!
TOOLSHED
Look dude, we don't need to play Superhero anymore. We can just go home.
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
NO! Because I could realize I shoulda killed you all!
MYSTERION
Then do it! [walks right up to the pistol and places himself at the end of the barrel] Pull the trigger, Hindsight! If you don't believe us then you don't have a choice! Pull the trigger, you pussy!
HUMAN KITE
Dude, Kenny, ch-chill out.
MYSTERION
You guys go! I'll deal with this prick!
MINT-BERRY CRUNCH
[the first up the stairs] Wuh uh okay, if you insist. Uh see ya, Kenny.
HUMAN KITE
My mom did tell me I had to be home by five, I-
MYSTERION
I said it's fine! Just go! [the other boys leave]
TOOLSHED
[stops] Uh, text me later, Kenny, if you wanna, like, play basketball or somethin'. [leaves]
[The Gulf. Cthulhu is tearing the piers apart. He takes a tilt-a-whirl and throws it at the fleeing crowd. The Coon climbs up the side of a roller coaster as burning pieces of it fall down past him. Soon the beach is clear of sunbathers and Coon reaches the top of the coaster. He runs along the tracks, jumping over any breaks. He runs to the end of the track, where the rest of it is missing, and looks at the dark lord]
COON
Cthulhu! Cthulhu, dude! Over here! [Cthulhu turns around and looks at Coon] Hey Cthulhu. 'Sup? Yes, it is me, the Coon! But don't worry, I'm actually not here to fight you! We are not so different, Cthulhu. Though I am a superhero and you are a dark god from another dimension, perhaps, we can work together! [Cthulhu looks around] I know how it feels to want to take over and rule the earth and have everyone else be your slaves. I do, bro! But there's a group of superhumans who are going to stop at nothing to stop YOU! [Cthulhu leans towards Coon at eye-level] Good, I have your attention. The superhumans I speak of are right now working on plans to destroy you! They reside in Colorado and they are fucking assholes, and they all deserve to be sent into a dark oblivion! You can do that, right? Send people into a dark oblivion? 'Cause that's what those buttholes deserve! [Cthulhu withdraws and walks away] No-Dude! Dude, Colorado is that way! Where are you going?? [runs back down the track] Goddammit, why don't dark lords fuckin' listen?!
[Coon and Friends secret base. Mysterion and Hindsight remain, Hindsight sways, intoxicated]
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
It doesn't matter. [takes a swig of Macallan] Even if the pictures are fake. I can't take it anymore. [turns away] Do you have any idea what a curse it is to have perfect 20/20 hindsight? [takes another swig] As soon as something bad happens, I immediately know how it could have been avoided. I can't take it anymore!
MYSTERION
People need you, Hindsight! [Hindsight takes a swig of Macallan] Without you they feel helpless and stupid.
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
Well I don't want the power anymore, alright?!
MYSTERION
You think your power's a curse?! Let me tell you something about curses, buttlicker! [turns around. Hindsight, curious, turns to face him] Because there's some superpowers that make yours look like nothing! Trust me, I know.
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
Wha-? What is your power?
MYSTERION
[turns around] I can't die. [pauses] I've experienced death, countless times. Sometimes I see a bright light. Sometimes I see heaven. Or hell. But eventually, no matter what, I wake up in my bed, wearing my same old clothes. [turns away] And the worst part? Nobody even remembers me dying. I go to school the next day, and everyone is just like, "Oh hey Kenny." Even if they had seen me get decapitated with their own eyes. [faces Hindsight] You wanna whine about curses, Hindsight? You're talking to the wrong fucking cowboy.
[Commercial]
ANNOUNCER
And now, a special announcement from the president of BP and DP.
TONY HAYWARD
Hello, I'm Tony Hayward. The tragic spill in the Gulf is a disaster that should have never happened. And as head of the oil company responsible, I would like to say, what should I do? [looks at the camera to his left] Should I admit we've made mistakes? [the spill is shown again] Should I remind you we've done this before? What should I do? Should I find newer and better ways to say I'm sorry? [Jumps out of a giant three-tiered BP cake with stars on his nipples: "We're sorry."]
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
[at a podium] Should I really believe I ruined my legacy? [behind him is a large banner that reads "Captain Hindsight"] What should I do?
TONY HAYWARD
[voice-over] What should I do?
MYSTERION
[voice-over] What should I do? [shown getting a massage] Should I forget about the past and not care about my powers?
TONY HAYWARD
Or should I tell you, "I am not a role model." [winks]
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
[on the steps in the alley side of a building drinking Macallan] Seriously, what should I do?
TONY HAYWARD
[in Western Outlaw getup] Should I accept my role as the villain?
MYSTERION
[in a familiar alley] Maybe I should just... disappear.
TONY HAYWARD
[at the rig inspecting the blueprints] Should I not have listened to my technicians who said a spill wouldn't happen? They're my technicians! [blinks twice]
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
[on a darkened basketball court] Hindsight's a bitch, isn't it?
COON
[thinking on the roller coaster track] Should I just apologize to my friends and ask them to take me back? Tell then that I was being a selfish jerk? [aloud] What should I do?
CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT
[in the chair that gave him his superpower] Should I get back in the chair? Remove my powers and just go back to being a simple reporter? [activates the chair]
COON
[thinking on the roller coaster track] Should I admit I was wrong? Ask for everyone's forgiveness and go back to my original team? [aloud] Nah, screw that. I'm just gonna keep bein' a fuckin' dick! [jumps off the track]
[Clyde's bedroom. Coon and Friends are at a desk, with Human Kite typing away on a computer keyboard]
TOOLSHED
All right, superheroes, we've got to find out more about this Necronomicon thing!
MOSQUITO
Right, Toolshed!
HUMAN KITE
Here we go: "The Necronomicon contains an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them."
TOOLSHED
"It is used by cults around the world, most notably the Cult of Cthulhu."
MINT-BERRY CRUNCH
Aha! That's the cult the creepy man talked about, heroes. Uh, you okay, Mysterion?
MYSTERION
[away from the group, in deep thought] I'm fine.
HUMAN KITE
Ten arrested in South Park for cultish activity. This is from like, ten years ago.
MYSTERION
So these people have been waiting for Cthulhu a long time.
HUMAN KITE
Hey wait a minute. Dude. Mysterion, it's your parents.
MYSTERION
Uhh, what? [goes to see. He looks at the screen and his expression changes to one of dismay. His parents are pictured getting arrested along with the creepy man and Mr. Adler, shop teacher, among others. In his normal voice] What the fuck?! I m-I mean, [going into his superhero voice] Uh, I mean, what the fuck?! [takes over as Human Kite leaves the chair]
BETSY
[knocks on the door] Clyde? Clyde, I told you this morning to take the garbage out. [Betsy knocks some more. Mosquito, Human Kite, and Mint-Berry Crunch look at each other] Clyde, do you hear me?
MOSQUITO
[pulls his vuvuzela off his face] Okay Mom, just give me two minutes. [puts it back on] Nag nag nag. [buzzes a bit]
[More comic book pages appear, this time with Coon on them]
COON
Convincing a giant creature from another dimension to do what you want is no easy task. After days of killing and conquering, Cthulhu is at rest. Now is my chance to make a move. Perhaps last time I was too forceful with the dark god. Too demanding. To get what it wants, sometimes a coon must be on the attack and vicious. [a raccoon is shown aiming to grab a sandwich from someone's left hand] But sometimes a coon must be cuddly and cute. [the same raccoon is shown sitting on its hind legs begging for the sandwich] Time for me to try and manipulate the most evil thing in all the universe. [as Cthulhu sleeps, Coon gets on its belly and giggles, then pats its belly. Cthulhu makes some sounds, then goes back to sleep] Who's the sleepy little man? [pats its belly again. This time Cthulhu sneezes and blows Coon off. Cthulhu licks his lips and goes back to sleep. Coon, undaunted, climbs right back on its belly. Giggling, he scoots closer. Cthulhu opens its eyes. Cartman smiles broadly] My name is the Little Coon. What is your name? [Cthulhu moans a bit, then open its mouth wide and roars. Coon struggles to stay on this time. When Cthulhu closes its mouth, Coon mimics him] Craaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [Cthulhu opens its eyes wide as Coon giggles. Cthulhu moans] You're a sleepy man ne, Cthulhu? [scratches Cthulhu's belly] Who's a needs a tummy rub? [Cthulhu makes moans happily]
[The McCormicks' bedroom. Stuart smokes a joint while his wife looks on. He coughs]
CAROL
You're hoggin' it all, asshole! [she reaches for it, but he keeps it away]
STUART
'Cause I paid for it, you stupid bitch!
CAROL
[she keeps reaching for it] You paid for it with the money I made washing dishes at the Olive Garden!
STUART
[pushes her off] I told you to shut up!
CAROL
[punches him] Give to me, you prick! [they fight over the joint, suddenly realizing Mysterion is at their window watching them] AH! AAAAH! [both of them fall off the bed and then peer up from the side] Oh God he's back! It's that mystery kid again!
STUART
Uh what the hell do you want this time? Hey look, w-we did what you told us! W-w-we treat our kids better and we don't beat each other up as much.
CAROL
And we gave our sons allowances and stopped gettin' high every night. [Stuart realizes he's still holding the joint and chucks it away]
MYSTERION
I'm not here about that.
STUART
Oh. Uhuh, sss-so now what?
MYSTERION
Ten years ago you were arrested for being in some kind of cult.
CAROL
[looks at Stuart] We were?
STUART
We've been arrested lots of times, Mysterio.
MYSTERION
Mysterion. What is the Cult of Cthulhu?! [the parents look at each other]
STUART
Oh, that thing. Nooo, we weren't in that stupid group. They just used to offer free beer at their meetings, so we would go.
MYSTERION
What happened at those meetings?
STUART
Trust us, we don't remember. Uh uh, I know it sounds hard to believe, but we were actually really drunk the entire time.
MYSTERION
I don't find that hard to believe at all.
CAROL
I swear, we haven't been back to their meetings ever since, even though we always still get invited.
MYSTERION
These people still meet? Where?
STUART
Where they always did. Jim McElroy's house.
CAROL
They used to meet every Friday night. I think they still do. [and with that, Mysterion vanishes. The window remains open, but no one is in it. Carol gets back on the bed. Stuart gets the joint back, sits next to her, and lights the joint] Did that really just happen?
STUART
I don't think so. [takes a drag]
[A news report]
FIELD REPORTER
Breaking news here in the Gulf, Tom. The dark ancient god Cthulhu has called for a press conference, The Old One told reporters in a statement released this morning that it has extremely exciting news.
COON
Ladies and Gentlemen, today we are pleased to announce the successful merger of Cthulhu, and the Coon. Cthulhu's track record for complete dominance and interdimensionary rule is without question. And now, coupled with the legitimacy and instantly recognizable brand name of The Coon, we intend to bring change and fight injustice. As the all-new Coon and Friends. And anybody else using that name for their benefit is breaking the law! Oh, what's that? There is another group using our trademarked name? Well, I guess we have a right to banish them to a dark oblivion, don't we?!
[Jim McElroy's house, night. In the basement a robed man leads a group of cult followers in prayer]
FOLLOWERS
ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.
CULT LEADER
The Old One has awakened! [draws back his hood; it's the creepy man, or Man 2, from earlier] A lot of us have waited a long time for this day. Well for all our South Park Cthulhu members old and new, it is time to par-tay! [lukewarm response. Outside, Coon and Friends watch from a low window]
MYSTERION
There must be clubs like this all over the world.
TOOLSHED
We know some of these people. There's Mr. Adler, from shop class. And those two geeky computer guys.
HUMAN KITE
Oh my God, look! Back row. Aren't those the Goth kids?
PETE
I'm so freaking stoked that Cthulhu is gonna squash all the happy-go-lucky conformists.
MICHAEL
Yeah. I just hope he puts an end to the fucking Disney Channel.
TOOLSHED
Dude, why would the Goth kids worship Cthulhu?
MYSTERION
Makes sense. Unrelenting despair and a thousand years of darkness sounds pretty goth.
CULT LEADER
Now let us read from the Necronomicon. "That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons"
FOLLOWERS
"Even Death may die." [the boys turn away from the window]
TOOLSHED
"In strange aeons even Death may die?" What does that mean, Human Kite?
HUMAN KITE
I'm not sure, Toolshed. Could it be a riddle, Mysterion? M-! Mysterion? [Mysterion is gone]
MINT-BERRY CRUNCH
Mysterion is sooo... mysterious.
[News report. Jack Brolin reporting. He looks familiar...]
JACK BROLIN
A horrific scene of destruction, despair and terror here in New Orleans. And still there's no sign of Captain Hindsight. Rumor has it he got sick of it all, went back to his chair, and removed all his powers.
INJURED MAN
[in the background, walking by with his left hand over his injured right upper arm] Where are you Captain Hindsight? Aggh!
JACK BROLIN
Perhaps... he shouldn't have gotten back in that chair...
[An alley in South Park. The Goth kids enter]
PETE
[kicks a can aside] Do you think the dark lord Cthulhu is gonna make us go to school?
MICHAEL
No, assmunch. Cthulhu just wants chaos, bedlam, and madness.
PETE
Good, because if I have to go to PE class again, I was gonna kill myself. [they notice Mysterion looking at them from the edge of a roof] Who the F'n H is that?
MYSTERION
[jumps off the roof and lands on the alley floor, on one knee] What does it mean? "That is not dead which can eternal lie"?
MICHAEL
[takes a drag of his joint] "And with strange aeons even Death may die."
MYSTERION
What does it mean?!
PETE
It means Cthulhu is gonna get rid of all the posers and make everything cool and black and stuff. It's gonna be like, a Nine Inch Nails concert that goes on forever.
MICHAEL
Yeah, so go home and put your underwear back inside your pants, poser.
MYSTERION
[rises and walks towards them] You're going to tell me everything you know!
FIRKLE
[pulls out a switch blade and opens it] Nobody's stopping Cthulhu now! All will be sadness. Life will become death, and I will watch the crimson blood leak from your neck.
MICHAEL
Dude, that little kid is hardcore goth.
PETE
Hardcore goth.
CULT LEADER
[he and Nelson appear behind Mysterion, who turns around] The child is right, you know. Cthulhu sees all, hears all. The dark lord wants us to dispense of this one, kids. Give us a hand.
PETE
Whaaat? Dude, I don't wanna kill anybody.
MICHAEL
We're dark lord minions now, wuss. What'd you think we'd be doing?

CULT LEADER
Sorry kids. It's a little late for that. [takes the switchblade from the Kindergoth and stabs Mysterion with it. The cult members and the Goth kids disperse as Mysterion coughs and stumbles. Mysterion stops and then falls flat on his back]
TOOLSHED
Oh my God. Oh my God, they- they killed Kenny!
HUMAN KITE
You bastards! [a pool of blood appears under Kenny when someone knocks on a door somewhere. All of a sudden, Kenny is back in his room, in bed, in his same old clothes. More knocking]
[Kenny's room]
TOOLSHED
Dude, Kenny, what'd you run away for?! We've gotta fight these guys!
MOSQUITO
Yeah, come on, get your costume on, lazy-ass!

script:Coon vs. Coon & Friends

[A new comic book. The speech bubbles give the hero away: this comic book is about Mintberry Crunch. On the page, two villains run from the flying half-man half-berry]
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
Sit back, justice believers, and listen to another edition of America's favorite superhero, Mintberry Crunch! [The camera pulls out to reveal the whole page, which is a cover of "the AMAZING MINTBERRY CRUNCH"] Our story begins in a remote corner of the Gulf of Mexico. [a graphic of the BP oil rig is shown] The BP Oil Company drills into the ocean floor, [a graphic of a fire destroying the rig] but they drill too much, and the BP Oil Company accidentally unleashes Cthulhu, an ancient evil god from another dimension. Halfway across the country, [Coon & Friends in their normal outfit are shown, with Bradley as the leader instead of Stan] a mild-mannered attractive fourth-grader, Bradley Biggle, hears of the disaster on the news while with his friends. [the page flips over and Bradley is shown transforming] But Bradley Biggle is no ordinary fourth-grader! Not long ago, he realized he had superpowers he could call upon by turning in place and saying the magic word, "Shablagoo!" And in a flash, Bradley is transformed into the thrilling superhero, Mintberry Crunch! Joined by the other Coon Friends, Mintberry Crunch went to investigate the Gulf spill crisis! The superheroes came across a cult, in existence for years, that had been waiting for Cthulhu's arrival. They are the key to stopping Cthulhu from taking over the world! Sometimes, when everything seems hopeless, that's when you need to bring it all. [Mintberry Crunch stands at the corner of a roof in a heroic pose] That's when you need... to bring the Crr-runch!
[Coon and Friends Secret Base. The Friends are there listening to Mintberry Crunch]
TOOLSHED
[after a few seconds of silence] Dude, I'm sorry, but we still aren't getting it. You're half man and half berry?
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
Rrright!
HUMAN KITE
But then what exactly is your superpower?
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
The power of mint and berries yet with a satisfying tasty crunch!
TOOLSHED
...Nah, see, that's the problem dude, that's not really a superpower. Like, I have mental command over all power tools, Human Kite can fly-
HUMAN KITE
And shoot lasers out of my eyes.
TOOLSHED
And shoot lasers out of his eyes. And Mysterion can... [pauses and looks over at Mysterion.] Wait, what's your superpower Mysterion?
MYSTERION
[with his back to the group] I can't die!
TOOLSHED
...Oh yeah, good one. Mysterion can't die, and Iron Maiden is indestructible-
MYSTERION
No, Stan, I'm being serious! I really, really can't die!
TOOLSHED
...Woo-hat?
MYSTERION
[turns to face them] Like last night, in the alley, the cult leader stabbed me and I bled all over the place! And you screamed "Oh my God," and you called him a bastard!
HUMAN KITE
[arms down and out, palms out] When was that?
MYSTERION
All the time! I die all the time! And you assholes NEVER REMEMBER!
TOOLSHED
...Ah I think we would remember you dying, dude.
MYSTERION
Well you don't! I die over. And over! Only to wake up in my bed like nothing happened!
TOOLSHED
[notices Mintberry Crunch] Dude, you're freaking out Mintberry Crunch. He's peed his pants. [Mintberry Crunch notices that he has indeed peed his pants and covers his groin quickly]
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
Nono. Mintberry Crunch doesn't ever pee his pants!
MYSTERION
[turns away] I knew there'd be no point in telling you guys.
HUMAN KITE
[approaches him] Alright. dude, let, let's just say you're not crazy and it's true. What's the big deal? I mean, I think it'd be pretty cool not to be able to die.
MYSTERION
[confronts him] Pretty cool?! Do you know what it feels like to be stabbed?! To be shot?! Decapitated?! Torn apart?! Burned?! Run over?!
TOOLSHED
Kenny Kenny, calm down.
MYSTERION
It's not pretty cool, Kyle! It fuckin' hurts! And it won't go away, and nobody will believe me! [walks away, then turns around] Remember this time! Try and fuckin' remember! [pulls out a gun and shoots himself in the head]
TOOLSHED
Oh my God! Holy shit, dude!
HUMAN KITE
Dude!
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
Is he? Oh Jesus! [flees up the stairs and out of the basement]
TOOLSHED
[draws closer] Kenny? No! No!
[The Coon comic book. On the cover, Cartman carries an American flag while Cthulhu stands behind him wearing a Coon and Friends shirt. The story unfolds with a few embellishments in the design of the secret base]
COON
Gather around, believers in good, and listen to the newest installment of The Coon. It all began when the BP Oil Company drilled into the ocean floor and ripped open a hole into another dimension. Seeing the disaster on Coon-Vision, the Coon immediately called together his trusty Coon Friends. As the Coon explained how the disaster could be stopped, something terrible happened. Without warning, the Coon friends changed. Their superpowers morphed somehow, turning them into... supervillains. [the friends are depicted with evil grins] The Coon tried to reason with them, tried to bring them back to the side of good, ["Heroes must be good. Go with Christ!"] but it was too late. [Human Kite: "GET OUT!!!" Mysterion: "WE ARE EVIL NOW!"] Their black hearts had been tainted by hate and rage. The Coon was alone, turn by the ultimate dilemma. [Coon is shown sitting on Lincoln's shoulder at the Lincoln Memorial] He had to put a stop to the evil villains, even though they had once been his friends. Sometimes, to fight the ultimate evil, you must make friends with enemies. [Coon is showing looking at Cthulhu] The Coon teamed up with Cthulhu, because even Cthulhu knows what evil assholes Kyle and Stan and those guys are! And that they are manipulative, uncaring, vagina faces! They're all planning to destroy the world. Only one thing can stop them: the Coon. With Cthulhu's help, I can try to banish them to a dark oblivion, for all eternity. [the Friends are shown surrounding a glowing globe of Earth with evil grins on their faces] I will not rest until that happens.
[South Park, Cartman's street, day. Cartman is walking home and approaches the front door]
COON
Bab-ay,
I know you're askin' me to stay
Say "Please please please don't go away."
You say I'm givin' you the blues.
[enters the house]
Mayb-ay,
you mean every word you say
Can't help but think-
LIANE
[confronts him with her arms crossed over her chest] Eric Cartman!
COON
Hi Mom.
LIANE
Where have you been, young man?!
COON
Just doin' stuff Mom. Are my friends downstairs in the secret base?
LIANE
Yes they are, but you were supposed to be grounded in your room! And now you're more grounded, young man!
COON
[turns around and thinks hard, to himself] The Coon's mother appears to be extremely upset. In order to get past her, I must use the LeBron James technique.
LIANE
Eric, are you listening to me?!
COON
[faces Liane] Mom... what should I do?
LIANE
[disarmed] What?
COON
What should I do? Should I admit I made mistakes? Should I say I've done this before? Should I write a song about how I should have stayed in my room? What should I do?
LIANE
What do you mean "what should-"
COON
Should I say I am not a role model? Should I not listen to my conscience? It's my conscience, Mom! What should I do? Go back to my room and pretend nothing happened? Not jump out the window and fly to New Orleans? What should I do, Ma? Tell me!
LIANE
[overwhelmed] I just, I- I'm gonna go make you kids some lemonade. [runs off to the kitchen]
[Coon and Friends Secret Base. The Friends are at the table]
HUMAN KITE
Alright Coon and Friends, what good deed should we do next?
MOSQUITO
Perhaps we should make more lemon bars to raise money for people in need.
TUPPERWEAR
Okay!
MYSTERION
You guys have no memory of me shooting myself in the head, do you?
TOOLSHED
Uh-what?
MYSTERION
What we need to do is talk to people in that cult! I wanna know where my powers come from.
HUMAN KITE
Yeah cool let's talk about where our powers come from.
MOSQUITO
I was bitten by a radioactive mosquito! Bzzzzzzt.
TUPPERWEAR
I was in a car accident, then put back together with Tupperware parts.
IRON MAIDEN
Tih-Timmieh!
MYSTERION
Will you guys listen to me?! I actually have a power that I actually want to know about!
COON
[appearing on the basement stairs] Hey guys. [the Friends look at him] So, what's goin' on?
TOOLSHED
Go away Cartman. We kicked you out of Coon and Friends, remember?
COON
No, I, I know. That's cool, I understand. Even though I started it and the secret base is in my house. Yes, that's totally understandable.
HUMAN KITE
You just wanted to frame and blackmail people, then you beat up Clyde and Bradley for no reason!
COON
No you're right. For no reason. Clearly something is wrong with me. But you guys, what should I do?
HUMAN KITE
You should fuck off, that's what you should do.
COON
[sees the LeBron James technique isn't working] Hm. Ah, all right, look. You guys were totally right, okay? That's all I wanted to say. That and... there's a double rainbow outside.
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
A what?
COON
Double rainbow, you guys. You don't see 'em often, but there's one outside right now. You've gotta come see! [rushes up the stairs and out of the secret base]
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
A double rainbow? Shablagoo! [the heroes all leave their seats]
HUMAN KITE
Wait, Mintberry Crunch ya you might not wanna go- [goes up the stairs with the others]
PROFESSOR CHAOS
Huhey, can I see the double rainbow, fellas? [softly] Uh, fellas?
[Cartman's house, front lawn, day. Coon leads the friends out]
COON
Isn't it beautiful you guys?
HUMAN KITE
There's no double rainbow, fatass!
COON
You are correct, Human Kike! Not that supervillains like you guys could ever see a double rainbow!
MOSQUITO
What are you talking about?
COON
Your evil-doing days are over, Mosquito! All of you shall now be dealt the swift hand of justice!
HUMAN KITE
Cartman, you are the bad guy, not us!
COON
Nuh uh, you guys are the bad guy. [whistles. A gust of wind blows leaves at the boys, and heavy footsteps follow. Cthulhu soon stands before the Friends, who look at him in awe]
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
Waaaaaaaaaah! [runs off]
MYSTERION
What are you doing with that thing?!
COON
He's going to help me get rid of you guys so together we can make the world a better place!
HUMAN KITE
Cartman, if you team up with the most evil thing in the universe, then clearly you are the bad guy!
COON
No, because it's for the greater good, like when Superman teamed up with Lex Luthor!
HUMAN KITE
Superman never teamed up with Lex Luthor!
COON
[thinks it over, then crosses his arms] Well, that's why Superman isn't around anymore, isn't it? Cthulhu! Banish them to a dark oblivion, please! [Cthulhu opens his right paw and sweeps it from left to right in the air. The boys scream and become deformed, then disappear] Aww! Dude, that was awesome! You're all like "Mehhhh" and they were all like "Nooo!"
[Night. Coon and Cthulhu sit in a valley somewhere with a large city in the distance.]
COON
All right, now, we've taken out most of the synagogues, destroyed San Francisco, sent my friends into a dark oblivion, and so our next order of business will be Burning Man. [Cthulhu roars softly] Burning Man is the biggest hippie festival in the world, and tomorrow, we're gonna wipe them all out. Pretty soon, the whole world will be transformed thanks to the Coon! [Cthulhu roars softly] Yes yes, the Coon and Friend. Now after Burning Man we'll take down Whole Foods alright? [Cthulhu repositions himself to confront Coon and roars loudly. Coon thinks] The dark lord is agitated and the LeBron James technique might not work. The Coon will have to use an even more manipulative technique. Time to bust out: Cute Kitten. [aloud] Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow. [climbs up onto Cthulhu.] Meow meow meow. [digs his blades into Cthulhu's back and massages him while at the same time making a comfortable place to nap in. Cthulhu's face softens and he giggles, then looks back at Cartman sleeping on his back. Cthulhu blinks several times, then walks forward softly]
[a strange place altogether]
TOOLSHED
Dude, where the fuck are we?
MYSTERION
I don't know, but... I feel like... I've... been here before. [huge butterfly-like creatures pop up from behind some plants]
[a new installment of the Amazing Mintberry Crunch. He remembers things a bit differently...]
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
And so, the Coon had returned with the dark lord Cthulhu! Upon seeing Cthulhu in person, Mintberry Crunch heroically dashed off, to, to save the day! With Minty coolness he hurried back home! And heroically watched Judge Judy, knowing that his superhero friends were probably just fine without him!
[the strange place. The Friends run and scream until they reach a cliff]
TOOLSHED
Oh shit!
HUMAN KITE
[panting] We aren't going that way!
MOSQUITO
You guys, I wanna go home.
TOOLSHED
We all wanna go home, Clyde. I don't think we're gonna last very long out here.
MOSQUITO
Look, maybe we should just find a place to hide and wait for help.
HUMAN KITE
What help, dude? Nobody in the real world even knows we're here.
MYSTERION
Alright, you guys hide as long as you can. I'll try and find help. [moves away from the cliff]
TOOLSHED
How, dude?
HUMAN KITE
Kenny, where the hell are you going?
MYSTERION
I'm going to try to get you all out of here. If this works. Or, I could be wrong. [runs towards the cliff]
MOSQUITO
Kenny! [Kenny jumps off the cliff and impales himself on some big spiky plants ]
MYSTERION
Ow! That fucking HURTS! [moans a few times and dies.]
TOOLSHED
Oh my God! Kenny!
HUMAN KITE
You... you crazy bastard! [the boys turn away from the edge, seemingly forgetting their dead friend below]
[Kenny's room, night. Kenny is back in his bed and wakes up. He sits up and checks himself out. Satisfied that he's alright, he jumps off the bed and goes to his closet, opens it and pulls a curtain off a hidden chest of drawers. He opens the top drawer and pulls out a Mysterion costume.]
[The living room. As his parents watch TV, Kenny runs past them and out the front door.]
[Burning Man Festival, Black Rock City, day. Dance music pumps along]
MAN 1
[on a fish-cycle] It's burning Man!
MAN 2
[dressed as an angel] Biggest party in the world, baby! [more shots of the festival are shown. It's a carnival, but a roar changes all that. Cthulhu appears and throws an RV into the festival, and everyone scatters]
COON
[on Cthulhu's back] Fucking hippies! Fuck all o'you! [Cthulhu raises his left paw and unleashes a lightning bolt upon a girl, incinerating her and leaving nothing but bones]
REPORTER
The dark and evil Cthulhu is bringing his angry wrath down upon the Burning Man Festival, Tom. Cthulhu isn't behaving as most scientists had speculated, Tom, but the dark lord is wreaking havoc everywhere and-
COON
[walks up and interrupts him] No nonono! Excuse me! It is not Cthulhu, it is Coon and Friend! I'm a little sick of everyone giving him all the credit when I'm the one really making the world a better place!
REPORTER
Tom, it appears that Bruce Vilanch has arrived on the scene wearing a rat costume.
COON
[greatly insulted by the reporter's comment] Oh, you motherfucker! [runs towards Cthulhu] Cthulhu, this guy too! [Cthulhu unleashes more lightning and the reporter is incinerated] Kewl. Oh get that fire-twirling hippie bitch.
[Henrietta's bedroom, night. The Goth kids are sitting around on her red throw rug. Red Goth strikes a lighter and it lights up. He then blows out the flame. Kindergoth taps his cigarette onto an ash tray.]
MICHAEL
This freaking sucks! We worshiped and prayed to Cthulhu, went to all the cult meetings, but life is still totally freaking gay.
PETE
I thought that when Cthulhu rose from the dead all was gonna be darkness and pain. I thought at least school would be canceled.
MYSTERION
How to I fight him? [the Goth kids look at the window and see him there]
MICHAEL
Oh joy, it's Underwear Boy again.
MYSTERION
That god you pray to just took away all my friends.
PETE
Not our god. He promised everything would change if we worshiped him, but we're still sitting here smoking cigarettes like before [hair flip] It's like Obama all over again.
MYSTERION
How do I fight him?!
PETE
Cthulhu isn't alive or dead, alright?
MYSTERION
Tell me what that means! [the bedroom door opens and Henrietta's mom appears]
MRS. BIGGLE
Henrietta, your little brother wants to play with you.
HENRIETTA
Go away Mom, I hate you.
MRS. BIGGLE
Just let your little brother play with your friends, sweetie. He's lonely. Go on in, Bradley. [Bradley appears and enters the room]
BRADLEY
Will you guys play with me?
HENRIETTA
Fuck off, dork! I don't want you here!
BRADLEY
Please, can I just- oh g'uh! [sees Mysterion in the window] Mu-Mysterion! Wuh what's goin'- Uh, that's okay, sis. I'll play with you another time. [leaves and closes the door]
[the hallway. Bradley round the corner and walks to his room]
BRADLEY
Mysterion is here! He must have come for my help. [enter his room] No time to waste. Time for Bradley Biggle to transform. [opens a drawer under his nightstand and sees his costume] Shablagoo! [turns in place]
[Henrietta's bedroom. As Bradley transforms, Henrietta explains to Mysterion how to fight Cthulhu. She starts with the Necronomicon]
HENRIETTA
Alright, look. The Necronomicon is an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them. [the first page shows a Prince Abdul Al-Kazred in 700 A.D. The next one has the prince genuflecting before an Old One.]
MYSTERION
Old Ones?
MICHAEL
Dark deities that existed before man.
HENRIETTA
It was written by a mad prince who knew of the nightmare city of R'Lyeh, which fell from the stars and exists beneath the sea. And, in another dimension.
MYSTERION
That's it! That's the place I just was!
MICHAEL
You've been to the nightmare city of R'Lyeh?
PETE
Luckyyy...
HENRIETTA
Cthulhu and other beings are from this city, but for years cultists have tried to bring them into our world.
MYSTERION
And what about Cthulhu's power? Why can't Old Ones die?
HENRIETTA
The only thing that can destroy an immortal... is another immortal. [Henrietta's door opens again and Mintberry Crunch barges into the room]
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
Ahaaa! Don't worry, Mysterion. Mintberry Crunch is here to help you with these black cultists!
HENRIETTA
Get out of my room, TWERP!
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
Mintberry Crunch isn't afraid of his fat sister! Grab her legs, Mysterion! [Mysterion is gone] M- Mysterion? [the Goth kids turn to look at the window.] Aw crap. [runs out of the room]
[The street. Mysterion walks down the street briskly when Mintberry Crunch opens the front door and sees him]
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
Hey Mysterion, wait up! [leaves the door open] Come on, wait uuup! [catches up to him] Us Coon Friends need to stick together remember? Where are you going?
MYSTERION
Wherever Cthulhu is!
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
What? But he'll kill you.
MYSTERION
Maybe, but with any luck I might find the reason for my powers.
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
Oh right. Maybe I can find the reason for my powers too.
MYSTERION
You don't understand!
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
[turns away from Mysterion] How was it that mint and berry came together delivering full flavor in an intense crunch? [Mysterion leaves] We must find out answers Mysterion. [turns around, but doesn't immediately see him] Mu-Mysterion, I'm going with you.
[The Coon comic book, four pages in]
COON
After the triumphant victory over the evil hippies of Burning Man, Coon and Friends turned their attention to the next villainous scourge, bravely taking out every Whole Foods left in the country! No more organic crap for America! Thanks to Coon and Friends the country would soon be rid of all evil, but first, they would come up against their most challenging and most evil opponent, Justin Bieber. In order to save the Earth, this little butthole had to be stopped.
[Justin Bieber concert at Staples Center]
JUSTIN BIEBER
[grabbing his crotch constantly, and singing badly off-key] Babih babih babih oooo! Babih babih babih oooo! Babig baibig woo woo, Bay-wooo [Cthulhu reaches down and grabs him off the stage] Wooooo-ooo-oo! [Cthulhu grumbles]
COON
Yep, that's him. So long, Justin Bieber, you little douchebag! [Cthulhu crushes Bieber between his forefinger and thumb like a grape]
REPORTER 2
The dark god Cthulhu continues his rampage of destruction and terror, and there seems to be no hope for man. I'm joined now by a supposed team member of Cthulhu, the Coon.
COON
It isn't just Cthulhu, Mr. Reporter. He's merely a small piece of Coon and Friends, who will continue to fight for good and justice.
REPORTER 2
Good and justice? J-Justin Bieber and most of his fans have just been massacred.
COON
Yes, Coon and Friends are happy to help. We do not need thanks for our deeds. We do not want gifts, all we want is for people to buy our Coon and Friends T-Shirts for $14.95.
MYSTERION
Hey, fat boy!
COON
Kenny? What the hell? I sent you to the-
MYSTERION
To the sunken city of R'Lyeh fallen from the stars! [approaches him] You little fucking prick! What is wrong with you?! What kind of sick fuck does that to his friends?!
COON
It's not my fault you guys turned evil, Kenny!
MYSTERION
You are the bad guy, fat boy! YOU!
COON
I'm going around making the world a better place!
MYSTERION
For you! You're making it a better place for you!
COON
Right, that's what superheroes do.
MYSTERION
No! This is what superheroes do! [walks up to Cthulhu] You banished me but I'm back! What does that make me?! [that gets Cthulhu's attention] Bring back my friends! Take me!
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
[gets through the police line] Mysterion, no! What are you doing?!
MYSTERION
[to Mintberry Crunch] Only an immortal can kill another immortal! [to Cthulhu] Here's your prize! Take this curse away from me, you big pussy!
COON
[stands next to Mysterion] Don't listen to him Cthulhu! We have more important stuff to do!
MYSTERION
Go on! Kill me before I kill you! But bring my friends back, wuss!
COON
Cthulhu, you are a Coon Friend, and I'm the Coon! You will listen to me! [Cthulhu picks Coon up and scolds him, then cradles him. Coon takes the hint and scrambles onto Cthulhu's back. Coon kneads Cthulhu's back again and Cthulhu is relieved. Coon is asleep on Cthulhu's back and Cthulhu turns and walks away]
MYSTERION
No! Come back! I have to know what I am! Come back!
COON
Fuck you, Kenny!
MYSTERION
Come back, you fat piece of shit! [notices something in the sky. Others notice too. A bright object descends onto the parking lot and dims enough to reveal a giant oval shaped light that serves as a holograph. An image of a man appears inside and begins to talk. Mysterion is puzzled]
ALIEN MAN
Hello my son. If you are seeing this message, then it must be dark times. And you must have many questions. Your true name is Gok'Zarah. The power given to you comes from a planet far away. You are from that planet, Gok'Zarah. It is for that reason you have a power that normal humans do not have. I know you must sometimes see this power as a curse, but you were sent here to stop evil from taking over the Earth and now, that time has apparently come. You must now harness and focus your power, Gok'Zarah. The power of mint and berries yet with a tasty, satisfying crunch.
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
...Uh yes. Yes, please go on.
ALIEN MAN
Your home planet, K'oh Kajan, is known throughout the universe for its berry mines. Berries that have the power to fuel nearly anything. Needless to say, when the mint hunters of Kogenrah got word of them, our fate was already sealed, Gok'Zarah. But our two worlds collided and soon, mint and berry were one.
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
Wow!
ALIEN MAN
Your mother and I sent you as far away as we could. Use your power, son. Save Earth. Shablagoo! [the orb rises up and away]
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
I will, father. No more running away for... Mintberry Crunch! [jumps up in the air and floats up, then aims at Cthulhu and flies towards him] Hello, Cthulhu, I heard you haven't been "berry" nice! [unleashes a torrent of berries at him. Cthulhu shields himself, but doesn't go down.] Not enough, huh? Maybe the intense flavor of mint will freshen things up! [Cthulhu is soon enveloped in a tornado of mint leaves]
[The Amazing Mintberry Crunch. The following is illustrated in the comic book]
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
I reached the Gulf of Mexico in no time, and with all my strength, I dragged Cthulhu back to the depths from whence he came! My trusty hero companions were there, still alive. I returned them to their world encased in a protective berry bubble. Then it's back down to fill up the hole created by the BP Oil Company, returning home only momentarily to flip off my fat sister. ["Fuck you! I have powers you fat bitch!"]
[Coon and Friends Secret Base, later. The Coon Friends are all there]
TOOLSHED
Dude, thanks for getting us out of that dark oblivion, Mintberry Crunch.
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
Oh no, we worked as a team! All the Coon and Friends stopped the BP drilling spill crisis.
HUMAN KITE
And finally the evil Coon is right where he belongs. [the Coon is in his own holding cell with Professor Chaos]
COON
Come on you guys, this is fucking bullcrap! Let me out!
HUMAN KITE
You're not going anywhere for a long time!
COON
This is inhumane! There's a big bucket with Butters' poop in here, and there's nothing to eat!
TOOLSHED
Ya got poop, don't ya?
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
Well, I'm off. There are still many more questions left unanswered. I need to know what happened to my parents.
HUMAN KITE
Well, come back and visit any time, dude.
MINTBERRY CRUNCH
I will. Shaaablagoo! [twirls in place and disappears in a streak of light, leaving behind berry cereal]
COON
Fuckin' Mintberry fuckin' Crunch.
TOOLSHED
Wow, can you believe it Kenny? Bradley actually had superpowers. Isn't that cool?
MYSTERION
Yeah. I'm tired, guys. I think I'm gonna go to bed. [takes a gun out and just shoots himself in the head. The other boys jump back in shock.]
TOOLSHED
Oh my God! Holy shit dude!
HUMAN KITE
Kenny? No! Nooo!
[Kenny's parents room, night. They're asleep, but something wakes Carol up. Stomach pains; labor pains. She sits up holding her belly]
STUART
What? Whaaat?!
CAROL
It's happenin' again! [falls back on the bed and raises her legs in the air.]
[Kenny's room, moments later. The parents enter. Stuart turns on the light. Carol holds baby Kenny in her arms while Stuart sets out a parka for Kenny to sleep in. Carol zips it up and the parents leave the room]
CAROL
[before closing the door] We should have never gone to that stupid cult meetin'. [Stuart turns off the light and Carol closes the door]

script:Crème Fraiche

[The Marsh house, living room, night. Randy and Sharon are watching TV on the sofa, under a blanket]
REPORTER
Passenger said the Carnival cruise line smelled like poop, but that that was an improvement.
SHARON
[yawns] All right, it's late. I'm gonna call it a night. [leaves the sofa and heads for their room] You coming?
RANDY
Aw, you know, I can't really sleep. I'm just gonna stay up a bit and have some me time.
SHARON
[going up stairs, she stops and turns around] Randy, do not watch that no-no channel.
RANDY
Ugh. I'm not staying up to do that Sharon, jeez!
SHARON
Alright, come to bed soon.
RANDY
Psseh... huh... [glances at the stairs to see if Sharon is gone, then quickly begins changing channels. He stops at a channel where music is playing] Ohhh... Whoahohoohhh... Man, that is hot... [starts masturbating under the sheet] Oh yeah. Fuck.
GUY FIERI
[showing off some ribs] Mmm, just look at that rack of ribs; now those are slow-cooked, and then braised to bring out the smokey flavor.
RANDY
Mmm, God damn. Yeah.
GUY FIERI
[hods up a rib to the camera] See how that just falls off the bone? [eats some more off it] Mmm, that is MONEY right there!
RANDY
Yeah, it's fuckin' money.
ANNOUNCER
Next on Food Network it's Paula Deen ["Paula's Home Cooking"]
PAULA DEEN
Hey y'all. Tonight we're gonna be makin' some deep-fried chicken.
RANDY
Aw yeah?
PAULA DEEN
Muh buttery whipped potatoes and we're gonna be finishin' off with a chocolate pecan pie.
RANDY
Awwwgh. Oh fuck yeah. [still masturbating]
[The Marsh kitchen, morning. Randy's been busy cooking breakfast. Stan, Shelly, and Sharon enter the kitchen]
STAN
Dad, what are you doing?
RANDY
Ah! You're just in time! Siddown, siddown! I've made you all breakfast again!
STAN
Aw crap. [they go to the breakfast table while Randy serves up their dishes]
RANDY
Now, what I have for you is a nice goat-cheese and heirloom tomato frittata. And we're gonna top that with a little crème fraîche. [scoops some out to spread on Stan's plate, slooowly] Aw yeah... Awwww...
SHARON
[on to him] Randy, you've been watching that channel, haven't you?!
RANDY
No!
SHARON
Yes, because every time you watch cooking shows you stay up all night trying to copy what they made.
RANDY
Well, I'm sorry if there's something wrong with me helping out with the cooking! [grabs his coat and heads for the garage. He opens the door and takes a look back] I'd think you'd be grateful, Sharon! I gotta get to work. I cooked, so you guys clean up. [closes the door and leaves. The others look at him leave, then look at the dishes on the counter. That's a lot of bowls]
STAN
Can I have a Pop Tart?
[The Marsh house, living room, afternoon. Stan and friends are on the sofa watching TV]
KYLE
Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode.
TERRANCE
Hello, and welcome to Progressive. [a Progressive spoof]
PHILLIP
[with his wife, Katherine] Yes, we're looking to buy car insurance.
TERRANCE
Well, you've come to the right place. [farts on Phillip's face]
PHILLIP
Oh dear! I knew we should have gone to Geico! [Kyle says this part with him] Come on, darling, let's get out of here and go there.
RANDY
[quickly arrives, takes off his coat, and takes over. The boys get off the sofa] Daddy time. It's Daddy TV time. [On TV, a chef presents his latest creation]
ALTON BROWN
Now just look at this pork tenderloin. It is brined and ready for action.
RANDY
Aw yeah, look at that.
STAN
Dad, you know Mom doesn't want you watching food channels.
RANDY
I worked all day! I can watch what I want!
ALTON BROWN
We're gonna take a stick of butter and just smear that all over.
RANDY
[almost breaks a sweat] Oh my God that's awesome! Oh... [looks at the boys, then takes the blanket hanging on the back of the sofa and puts it over his groin, keeping himself in check] Oh, oh. [starts masturbating] ...Yeah. Whoa.
ALTON BROWN
Now let's get that on the grill.
RANDY
See what he's doing there, Stan? He brined that for an hour in the fridge, so now he can sear the shit out of it. Whoaoaoaoaoaoaoo.
ALTON BROWN
Look at the char we're getting. That, that is what we're going for.
RANDY
Oh, isn't that hot, guys? Ohgh, yeah. Don't you wanna just... Don't you wanna just get in there and... [the boys notice the fierceness in his voice] Wwrrmmmm! Mmmh!
ANNOUNCER
We'll be right back to Good Eats.
[Commercial]
WOMAN 1
Hey ladies, are you looking for a better workout?
RANDY
[the fierceness vanishes] Aww, stupid commercials.
WOMAN 1
Introducing the Shake Weight. A spring-loaded workout device you pump with your arms. Just grab the piston and go to work. One-handed or double-fisted.
RANDY
[yawns] Come on!
WOMAN 1
You just shake it. Back and forth.
WOMAN 2
It feels really good in my hands.
WOMAN 1
Best of all, Shake Weight tells you when your workout is finished by chiming and releasing a cool-down spray. [the Shake Weight chimes and gives two squirts of the cool-down spray]
RANDY
Bohh-riiing.
WOMAN 1
Order now and we'll include the optional heart rate monitor. Just put your finger in the tester. [a woman shows how it's done] and Shake Weight takes your pulse. [another woman finishes her exercises and gets two squirts] Get yours today.
ANNOUNCER
Now back to Good Eats.
ALTON BROWN
Just look at the glaze we've got going now on that thing.
RANDY
[back to masturbating] Oh man, yeah, that is hot! Ooomm.
ALTON BROWN
Alright now, here's the really cool part. What we're gonna do is-
[A short beep is heard and the screen goes blue. In white letters, this appears: "This Channel Has Been Blocked By Parental Controls"]
RANDY
Channel blocked? [begins clicking channels] What the? The hell? [goes to the master bedroom and finds Sharon clicking away on another remote control] Sharon, what are you doing?
SHARON
Just using the parental controls to block some channels.
RANDY
I wasn't watching food channels!
SHARON
Then how do you know I blocked them?
RANDY
I- know 'cause I don't know that! That's what I'm saying! Gaw! [walks away thwarted and goes to his den. He picks up a cordless phone on the way. He leaves the lights off in there and walks to his desk, dialing a number. He sits down as his call is answered]
HOTLINE MAN
Thanks for calling the Food Network Hotline. Billing is nine-ninety-five for each sixty-second period. To accept, say "crème fraîche."
RANDY
Crème fraîche.
AMANDA
Hi there, I'm Amanda. What are you up to?
RANDY
Oh hi, I just uh... thought I'd give the hotline a try. What are you doing?
AMANDA
I'm making a pan-roasted chicken.
RANDY
[piqued] Pan-roasted? Like seared on the stove and put in the oven?
AMANDA
Uh huh. I've just taken the chicken out of the pan. It's... so moist. I'm gonna let it rest now, about five minutes.
RANDY
Yeah?
AMANDA
Yeah. Ooo, there's lots of brown bits stuck to the bottom of the skillet.
RANDY
You gonna deglaze that fuckin' pan?
AMANDA
Oh I'm gonna deglaze it. You wanna help me?
RANDY
If I was there I would. I'd take some... red wine... 'bout a quarter-cup, and then... a wooden spoon... and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan.
AMANDA
I got a wooden spoon right here; it's... pretty hard. [upstairs Sharon picks up the phone to make a call, but she hears the conversation and stops to listen]
RANDY
Yeah you'd... put some onion in while you're deglazing?
AMANDA
I was thinking about shallots, actually.
RANDY
Aw yeah. Shallots won't overwhelm the chicken's natural flavors. Fuck yeah.
SHARON
Randy! Marsh!
RANDY
WAH! Sharon!
HOTLINE MAN
Your time on Food Network Hotline has expired. To add more time say "crème fraîche."
[The Broflovski kitchen. Sheila sits at the breakfast table as Sharon paces back and forth wiping some tears from her eyes]
SHARON
I don't know what to do, Sheila. It's like he's a different person. Last night I walked in on him in the bathroom. He was sitting on the toilet flambéing a pork chop.
SHEILA
Sharon, I'm so sorry.
SHARON
It just makes me feel unwanted, you know? I mean, am I not attractive anymore? I mean I don't exercise anymore at all.
SHEILA
Well, if it'll make you feel better about yourself, then work out, Sharon.
SHARON
Like I have time to go to the gym every day.
SHEILA
There are plenty of things you can buy to get a good workout at home. Have you heard of the Shake Weight?
[Bed, Bath & Beyond, day. Sharon enters the store and hears oooh's and aaah's and sees some women trying out the Shake Weights. She walks up to the display table. A store associate walks up to her]
ASSOCIATE
Help you find anything? [the name tag says Michael]
SHARON
Oh, yes. I was interested in the Shake Weights?
MICHAEL
Biggest seller the past four months. What models are you lookin' at?
SHARON
Oh I didn't realize there were different models.
MICHAEL
Well you got your standard, your deluxe model, large sizes, but, if you're really lookin' for a workout you might wanna try the Big Gym. That woman over there is trying it out. [the woman is having some difficulty with the large Shake Weight]
SHARON
I... think I'll start with the smaller white ones.
MICHAEL
Small white ones, yes ma'am. [picks up two different models] Standard or voice assist model?
SHARON
Well I don't know-
MICHAEL
I would definitely recommend the voice assist. It has recorded voice commands to help motivate you in your workout.
[The Marsh house, master bedroom. Sharon is working with the Shake Weight now, starting with the right arm.]
SHAKE WEIGHT
You are doing excellent. Great work. Now switch arms. [Sharon switches arms] Wow. Good job. [Sharon begins to gasp for air] You are amazing. You are very attractive and interesting.
SHARON
Thank you, Shake Weight.
SHAKE WEIGHT
Come on now. Almost finished. [Sharon begins to shake the weight faster] Yes. Good. Almost done. [Sharon shakes the weight even faster and begins to grunt] Keep going. Keep going. Harder. Faster. [Sharon's giving it all she's got, and a bell sounds. She gets two squirts]
SHARON
Hahhh.
SHAKE WEIGHT
Your workout is finished. [a different bell sounds and Sharon twists the Shake Weight around to get some change] Here is some cab fare.
SHARON
Oh wow.
SHAKE WEIGHT
Now going to sleep mode. [powers down]
[South Park Elementary cafeteria, day. The boys stand in line for lunch]
STAN
You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it!
CARTMAN
[sarcastic] Well, hearing you bitch about your dad all the time is super-interesting, Stan. I hope you do it during the entire lunch period. [the line moves forward and the boys enter to see... Randy as the school chef]
RANDY
Hello there, children!
STAN
Awww what?!
RANDY
How's it goin'? [behind him is restaurant-quality cooking equipment]
STAN
No, dad! No!
RANDY
The school was hiring and I got the job. Isn't that great?
STAN
Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?!
RANDY
I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crème fraîche.
CARTMAN
Lobster foam? [Stan shuts his eyes and buries his nose in his right hand] It says very clearly on the lunch schedule that today is pizza day!
RANDY
Yes, and so this is my take on a pizza. It's an Asian slaw on flat bread, deconstructed and topped with a nice Parmesan aioli.
STAN
Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now!
RANDY
Stan, there's nothing wrong with a man following his passion! [starts spreading the aioli over the pizza] Ooo yeah, fuck yeah.
[The Marsh house, after school. Sharon is in the kitchen washing the mountain of dishes Randy left in the morning and she's not happy about it. Stan opens the front door and enters the living room, closes the door and walks to the kitchen.]
STAN
Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef.
SHARON
Oh I know! He tried out all his recipes here and left me with the mess!
STAN
Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom!
SHARON
You think your father's gonna listen to me?! [something begins to beep nearby and Sharon looks at it, then goes to the breakfast table. On it is the beeping Shake Weight]
SHAKE WEIGHT
This is a workout reminder. Time for a workout.
SHARON
Oh. [picks up the weight and begins to shake it] This thing is so great. It reminds me when I haven't worked out in a while.
SHAKE WEIGHT
That's it. Work it. Harder, faster.
STAN
Mom, Dad's food sucks and kids at school are starting to get pissed at me!
SHARON
[sighs] Sorry Stan, but I need to start doing things for myself! [Stan just looks at her now]
SHAKE WEIGHT
You are independent and strong.
SHARON
Right! I spend all my trying to take care of everybody else!
SHAKE WEIGHT
Switch arms.
SHARON
[switch] I don't need to look good to keep your father interested in me! I'm just going to do it FOR ME!
SHAKE WEIGHT
You are so motivated and charming. It is time to take your pulse. Insert finger. [Sharon puts her left index finger into the device.] Do not stop your arms. Keep going. Good. Get your finger up there a little more. Your pulse is one hundred forty-five. [Sharon shakes the weight harder] Faster. Harder.
[South Park Elementary cafeteria kitchen, day. Randy is behind the food counter acting as if he's on TV.]
RANDY
Who says that school cafeteria food can't be healthy, delicious, and gourmet? Today we're gonna be making the students my tasty baked ziti with basil and fresh [in an Italian accent] mozzarella. It's all right here right now on Cafeteria Fraîche.
[Montage. Randy beings out some muffins from the oven, then stirs some soup]
RANDY SINGING
La lalala la la...
RANDY
[glazing some marbled beef] Aww, fuck yeah. [next he chops onions]
RANDY SINGING
Lalalalala la, fraîche, fraîche.
RANDY
[sniffing the aroma of freshly cooked turkey surrounded by russet potatoes] Ogh, yeah. Man, that ogh... [takes a small torch to some quiches, shows off a new dish on a fancy plate on a regular tray, squirts out some dinner roll batter on a cooking sheet, grinds some pepper onto a baked ham, flambés some shrimp, checks out some pork chops he's got cooking in the oven and likes what he sees]
RANDY SINGING
Crème fraîche, Cafeteria Fraîche. Lalalalala fraîche. Ho ho hohoho.
STAN
Dad, what are you doing?
RANDY SINGING
[as his head floats across the screen] Fraîche. [a logo finally shows up]
RANDY
Fraîche.
RANDY SINGING
Cafeteria Fraîche.
RANDY
Alright now, for my baked ziti we are gonna start off by getting some extra-virgin olive oil into the pan. [does so] Oh yeah, get that all over there. It's all slick. ...It's all wet and slick. Oh...
CRAIG
Can we have some food, please? [behind him stand Craig, Kevin, and some more fourth graders]
RANDY
Now olive oil does have a low smoke point, so keep that heat low, and keep it fraîche. [the crew is shown: Stan operates the camera, Kyle the boom mike, Cartman and Kenny the klieg lights. Randy grates the cheese over the ziti] Ohhh, ohh that's so fuckin' hot. Look at that crust, it's perfect. Fuck yeah.
STAN
Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef!
RANDY
Quiet on set, please.
STAN
No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back!
RANDY
[distracted] Back from where?
[A beach somewhere. A small table holding a bucket of ice and two Coronas is shown with a chaise longue on either side. On the right one is Sharon, on the left one is the Shake Weight]
SHARON
Oh, this is so nice. I really needed this.
SHAKE WEIGHT
You are so lovely and elegant. You can do anything you set your mind to.
SHARON
Oh, thanks Shake Weight.
SHAKE WEIGHT
You are a go-getter. You are strong and confident.
SHARON
You're right.
SHAKE WEIGHT
Tell me again about the women who you do not like.
SHARON
Well, Linda Stotch is a real gossiper and Tammy Bretts at work is just a know-it-all.
SHAKE WEIGHT
Oh you are so witty and alarmingly insightful. [two beeps] How about a quick workout?
SHARON
[takes off her sunglasses] A workout? Right now?
SHAKE WEIGHT
Just a quickie. You can do it.
SHARON
I don't really like working out in public.
SHAKE WEIGHT
Come on. You can do it. [Sharon thinks about it, then picks up the weight with her left hand and shakes it. At first she keeps it at a distance, but soon shakes it normally] That's it. Good. Keep it up. Feel the burn. Harder. Faster. [Sharon does as told] You are amazing. Switch arms. [Sharon switches] Oh that's it. Yes. You are getting really good at this. You are capable of anything. Harder, faster. [Sharon does as told] I said faster. More. Do it. You are almost there. Home stretch. Oh yes. [a ring and two squirts] Your workout is finished. Your cab fare. [pours out some fare onto Sharon's left hand] Now going to sleep mode. [powers down]
[A drama/music classroom at South Park Elementary. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny enter through an open door]
KYLE
We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right?
STAN
He's not going to listen to us! We already tried!
KYLE
He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay.
CARTMAN
[on stilts, dressed as Ramsay] Oy! Bebebebebebebe.
STAN
That's stupid, Cartman.
KYLE
He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good.
KENNY
(Yeah, it's really good.)
KYLE
Let's hear it, Cartman!
CARTMAN
Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook!
STAN
You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded.
RANDY
[enters the room] Hey Stan, have you seen my- Oh my God it's Gordon Ramsay! [backs out the door quickly and hides behind the door. Stan follows him out] Stan! Do you know who that is in there?! That's the Gordon Ramsay!
STAN
...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you.
RANDY
Talk to me?! Oh Jesus!
[A hotel room. Sharon is sleeping in bed when something begins to beep. Sharon wakes up and looks around, gets up and goes to the dresser and opens a drawer. Inside, she sees the Shake Weight blinking and beeping. She picks up the weight in her right hand]
SHAKE WEIGHT
You have not worked out in seven hours.
SHARON
Oh God, not right now.
SHAKE WEIGHT
Come on. Let's get to it.
SHARON
Ugh, I'm tired.
SHAKE WEIGHT
You have not worked out in seven hours.
SHARON
Oh, where is that sleep mode button?
SHAKE WEIGHT
Cannot go to sleep mode. You need to work out first. Come on. Just really fast?
SHARON
Ugghh.
SHAKE WEIGHT
Come on. It won't take long. Just a quick workout. Come on. Please.
SHARON
[sighs] All right. Fine. [a few moments later, with the lights on, she begins shaking the weight]
SHAKE WEIGHT
That's it. Good. [Sharon sighs] A little faster. Harder. [Sharon simply switches arm position, but doesn't shake any faster] Come on. Get into it. That's it. Now switch arms. [Sharon switches] You are so attractive and you have interesting things to say. [Sharon shakes the weight faster, but soon has to support her left arm with her right hand] Come on. You are almost there. Faster. Do it faster. [ding, two squirts, some change comes out] Now going to sleep mode. [powers down]
SHARON
[relieved] Ahhh.
[South Park Elementary, day. In the cafeteria kitchen, Cartman tries to discourage Randy any way he can]
CARTMAN
[still dressed as Ramsay] What the fuck kind of cook do you think you are?! Are you having a laugh, ey? Hey, you got your fucking head up your arse, don't you?!
RANDY
Yes chef!
CARTMAN
Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit!
STAN
Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up.
RANDY
No, Stan! No, Chef! This is my dream!
STAN
Dad! You aren't ever going to become a celebrity chef, Dad! Give up on your dream! [another camera crew comes in, with another chef]
BOBBY FLAY
Uh, excuse me. Randy Marsh?
RANDY
Yes, I- Oh my God, it's Bobby Flay! Stan, that's Bobby Flay!
BOBBY FLAY
I heard that Gordon Ramsay had taken an interest in your cafeteria food. So now I would like to challenge you to a school cafeteria food throwdown!
RANDY
Whoa, are you serious?? [fist pump] Yes, yes!
ALTON BROWN
A culinary battle royale is set to explode here in a school cafeteria. Will it be the simple, rustic cafeteria food of the challenger, or will the Iron Chef reign supreme?
STAN
Hey no, no. All you people get out of here.
JAMIE OLIVER
[appears] Hold on. Wait. School cafeteria food needs to be healthy. [begins to cry] Why, why won't people listen to me?
RANDY
Jamie Oliver!
ALTON BROWN
And our celebrity sous-chefs, Mario Batali, Paula Deen [she waves], and Giada De Laurentiis with her perky tats and gigantic head.
KYLE
Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots?
[The hotel, day. Sharon arrives at her hotel room only to find it closed. A sign hangs on the door.]
SHARON
"Your room is being serviced"? Ugh, oh well. [enters the room and finds the maid working out with the Shake Weight] Uhh, excuse me?
ROSEMARY
Oh, [turns around] uh no, no, [tosses the Shake Weight onto the bed] sorry. I done with cleaning, [runs to her cleaning tray and exits with it] thank you. Please, sorry. [after she leaves Sharon drops her shopping bag and walks to the bed. She crosses her arms and looks at the Shake Weight angrily]
SHAKE WEIGHT
...What's the big deal? She wanted to work out. You never want to work out. I just needed help going to sleep. Mode. ...What? ...What? Come on. What? You are amazing and irreplaceable. What? How about a quick workout? What? [moments later Sharon is on the phone with the manufacturer]
SHARON
[pacing back and forth] Yeah, I don't care, I just wanna find out how to return my Shake Weight!
SHAKE WEIGHT
This is ridiculous. Give Shake Weight a break.
SHARON
Because I want to return it now! I need to know the address of your company.
SHAKE WEIGHT
You are enticing and lovely. Tell me again about the women you do not like.
SHARON
I don't care how long I've had it, I want my money back!
SHAKE WEIGHT
You are so forthcoming and delightful. Tell me about which woman at work makes you the angriest. [Sharon stops and glares at it.]
[Montage opener to a special program: closeups of a chef slicing a carrot to bits, another chef working on a pan dish, another grinding meat, another flipping a steak over, another kneading bread]
ANNOUNCER
Tonight, a school cafeteria in Middle America is the stage for a heavyweight culinary battle. The very best of the best will cook off to find out who... can make the best school cafeteria food. It's... the Hell's Kitchen Nightmares Iron Top Chef Cafeteria Throwdown Ultimate Cookoff Challenge!
RANDY
[walking with a huge metal pot past Mario Batali] Behind you!
ALTON BROWN
[looks at Giada De Laurentiis, then turns to face the camera] Whose cafeteria food will win? These chefs are cooking their hearts out and bringing their A-game to serve the kids of this elementary school. [the cafeteria is shown full of kids] These kids have now been waiting over twelve hours for their lunch. Over at the prep station Jamie Oliver is crying again.
JAMIE OLIVER
[on the floor] Kids' food should be healthy. Why ain't it healthy?
ANNOUNCER
And back in the kitchen the challenger appears to have lost something.
RANDY
[walking around, frantic] Where is it, where is it?? I must have left it at home! [leaves the kitchen, goes through the cafeteria, and leaves] I'll be right back!
ALTON BROWN
The challenger has left the cafeteria to find his most important ingredient.
[South Park main street, night. Randy runs home]
RANDY
Crème fraîche. Crème fraîche. [comes in through the garage and goes to the refrigerator, opens it, and rifles through the food] Where is it?! Where is it?! [goes to the sofa in the living room and takes off the cushions] Dammit, where is that crème fraîche?! [runs upstairs and into the master bedroom. He goes to the dresser and rifles through the top drawer] Where did I leave that fucking crème fraîche?! It has to be somewhere!
SHARON
[appearing at the doorway] Randy, I'm back.
RANDY
[looks over his shoulder] Oh, thank God! [quickly walks up to her] Sharon! Have you seen my crème fraîche??
SHARON
Randy, we should talk.
RANDY
I don't have time! I'm cooking right now!
SHARON
Randy, I don't want our marriage to fail. I don't know how to fix what's wrong, but please, can't we just go to bed and start fresh in the morning?
RANDY
You don't understand, Sharon! I've got Gordon Ramsay up my ass, Bobby Flay out to kick my ass, and the whole world's gonna be watching! I can't sleep! I haven't slept for days!
SHARON
What'd you say?
RANDY
[stops searching and crosses his arms] I can't sleep, Sharon! I'm in work mode!
SHARON
Can I try something?
[The Marsh house, night, hallway. Randy and Sharon are still in the bedroom, but the door is locked shut]
RANDY
Oh... Sharon, what are you? Oh! Ohhhohoho, oh. Oh wow! A nice old-fashioned. [Stan walks into view] Oh that, oh that's good! Oh that's it. Yeah! [Stan stops and looks at the door] Now uh, switch arms. [Stan looks away, trying to make sense of what he's hearing] Oohh that's good. Really good. Wow! How'd you get so good at this? [Stan figures it out, turns, and walks away] You're amazing! That's it! Faster! Faster! Awwwgh! ...Awwwww. Awwwww. Haven't had an old-fashioned in a long time. [yawns] Ugh, I'm tired.
SHARON
You gonna go back to the kitchen?
RANDY
Oh no, fuck that. I'm gonna go to sleep, babe. Here, do you need some money or anything?
SHARON
No, I'm good, thanks. [smiles]
RANDY
I'll get my old job back tomorrow. Cooking's dumb. I'm just... really sleepy. [closes his eyes] Love you, Sharon. [farts, and he's asleep. Sharon remembers something and goes downstairs.]
[The Marsh house, dining room. Her suitcase is on the table. Sharon walks up to her suitcase and opens it up]
SHAKE WEIGHT
I guess my work here is finished.
SHARON
Shake Weight, you aren't really workout equipment at all, are you?
SHAKE WEIGHT
Marriage is important. Keep your man happy. When things are going bad, there's nothing like an old-fashioned to ease his stress.
SHARON
I'll remember that now, thanks to you.
SHAKE WEIGHT
It has been nice getting to know you. How about a quick workout, for old times' sake? Just kidding. I must be going now. Another lovely woman needs me. Goodbye, customer.
SHARON
Goodbye, Shake Weight.
