Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics

[A WSPK Channel 2 news anchorman appears]
ANCHOR
Fighting the frizzies, at 11.
[Intro. Mailman, tall and lanky with a very long cheek, walks into view]
MAILMAN
We've all heard of Rudolph and his shiny nose
And we all know Frosty who's made out of snow
But all of those stories seem kind of... gay
Cuz we all know who brightens up our holiday!
[Robert T. Pooner Presents. Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics. A Collection of 10 Holiday Songs]

Mailman and Kids|[Mailman leads them] He's a piece of poo!
MAILMAN
Sometimes he's nutty [a girl holds a drawing],
sometimes he's corny [she shows the next drawing].
He can be brown or greenish brown [Mailman holds two sheets of construction paper].
KIDS
Mmm-mmm.
MAILMAN
But if you eat fiber on Christmas Eve,
He might come to your town. [a boy has made a Hankeyman and added smudges of real poo]
MAILMAN AND KIDS

He loves me, I love you.
Therefore, vicariously he loves you

MR. HANKEY
[pops out from behind the bushes]
HOWDY HO!
I'm Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
Season's greetings to all of you.
Let's sing songs and dance and play [moves in between two kids and holds hands with them]
Now, before I melt away [throws himself onto the Mailman's head]
Here's a game I like to play:

Stick me in your mouth and try to say,

"Howdy ho ho, yum yum yum."
MR. HANKEY
Christmastime has come!
GIRL 1
Sometimes he's runny.
BOY 1
Sometimes he's firm.
GIRL 2
Sometimes he's practically water.
MAN ON PORTO POTTY
[opens the door] Sometimes he hangs off the end of your ass
And won't fall in the toilet
Cuz he's just clinging to your sphincter
And he won't drop off and so you ...shake your ass around
And try to get it to drop into the toilet
And finally it does.. [Timmy closes the door and clears his throat]
MAILMAN AND KIDS

MAILMAN
When Christmas leaves; he must leave too. [Santa lands with reindeer]

Flush him down, but he's ne-ver gone!
[normal. Santa takes off] His smell and his spirit ling-ers on!
KIDS
Howdy Ho!
[Mr. Hankey is now shown seated on an armchair next to the crackling fireplace. Next to him is a small table with a gifts on it. Behind him is a Christmas tree with gifts at its base]
MR. HANKEY
Howdy-ho, folks. We're gonna do somethin' a little bit different tonight. Instead of our normal thing, we're just gonna sit back and enjoy some holiday songs. And if ya don't like it, well, I guess you can suck my tiny little balls. So let's start off with a festive Hanukkah song, sung by my favorite Jewish person in the whole world.
[The Broflovski house, decorated for Channukah. A dreidel spins on the living room rug. Kyle and Ike watch it spin and fall]
KYLE
Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah. [picks it up] This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song:
[begins to dance]
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Oh,
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
[gives the dreidel to Ike. Cartman walks in]
CARTMAN
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
KYLE
Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?
CARTMAN
Sure.
[takes it and walks up to the camera. Kyle sways to the song]
Here's a little dreidel that's small and made of clay.
But I'm not gonna play with it, 'cause dreidel's freakin' gay.
KYLE
[stops] Hey, shut your mouth, fatass!
CARTMAN
[moves to block Kyle from view. Kyle moves to the other side of the screen to be seen. They go back and forth like this for a while]
Jews.. ...play stupid games

CARTMAN
It's sooo amazing! [shows the dreidel to Stan] You spin this thing on the ground and it goes 'round and 'round. I could watch it aaall day!
STAN
Let me try. [takes it and spins it on the rug]
I'll try to make it spin.
It fell; I'll try again.
[together. Cartman remains still between Stan and Kyle as Ike dances on the sofa behind them]

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.

[Back at the armchair...]
MR. HANKEY
Woohoo! Golly, that sure was fun. But now, for our next song, hold on to your bootstraps, 'cause we're gonna descend down into Hell!
[Hell. Flames abound here, but an ashen plain is seen with a little campfire on it. Hitler, shown in shades of gray, is on his knees in front of the fire, crying. Before him is a tree stand, but there's no tree in it.]
ADOLF
O Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum,
wie treu sind deine BlÃ¤tter.
O Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum,
[little Hitler is lifted up to put a star atop the Christmas tree]
wie treu sind deine BlÃ¤tter.
De grÃ¼nst nicht nur zur Sommerzeit,
[little Hitler beans a Jewish boy down with a snowball]
Nein, auch im Winter, wenn es schneit.
[Little Hitler looks at trees, and has visions of marching soldiers. He salutes.]
O Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum,
wie treu sind deine BlÃ¤tter.
[live Nazi footage is superimposed on the fire. Hitler breaks down]
SATAN
[walks up] Hey, Hitler. [turns to face him] What's the matter, little guy?
ADOLF
Oh, oh Satan, der tannenbaum, wie treu sind deine BlÃ¤tter.
SATAN
Awww, you don't have a Christmas tree?
ADOLF
â€¦nur zur Sommerzeit, nein, auch im Winter, wenn es schneit.
SATAN
[the damned appear around him] Well, I tell you what: Maybe we'll have ourselves a little Christmas, right here! Come on, everyone, gather 'round!
String up the lights and light up the tree.
We're gonna make some revelry!
Spirits are high, so I can tell,
[two of the damned stand up and dance]
It's Christmastime in Hell.

Demons are nicer as you pass them by.
[passes them in front of Azrael's Toys]
There's lots of demon toys to buy.
The snow is falling, and all is well.
[a volcano behind the store erupts]
It's
WITH DEMONS
Christmastime in Hell!
SATAN
There goes Jeffrey Dahmer with a festive Christmas ham.
[Dahmer walks out of a meat store and into the house next door]
After he has sex with it, he'll eat up all he can.
And there goes John F. Kennedy, caroling with his son.
[they stop by to sing with him]
WITH THE KENNEDYS
Reunited for the holidays, God bless us, everyone!
WITH THE DAMNED
Everybody has a happy glow!
Let's dance in blood and pretend it's snow.
SATAN
Even Mao Tse Tung is under the spell [Mao is making a snow angel]
WITH CHOIR
It's Christmastime in Hell!
SATAN
Adolf, here's a present for you! [hands him a present]
ADOLF
Oh? [opens the gift, it's the Christmas tree he wanted] Ein tannenbaum! [hugs it]
SATAN
Yes, ein tannenbaum.
FEMALES
Aaa-aaa!
SATAN
God cast me down from heaven's door
[hops into a mining car and moves. Two demons man the front car]
To rule in Hell forevermore.
But now I'm kinda glad that I fell,
WITH CHOIR
'Cause it's Christmastime in Hell!
WITH MALES
Here's a rack to hang the stockings on [...the type of rack with a man stretched out on it]
WITH FEMALES
We still have to shop for Genghis Khan [seen]
SATAN
Michael Landon's hair looks swell.
WITH CHOIR
It's Christmastime in Hell!
SATAN
There's Princess Diana holding burning mistletoe
Over poor Gene Siskel's head; just watch his weenie grow.
[She does hold the mistletoe; Gene goes down on her]
WITH CHOIR
For one day we all stop burning, and the flames are not so thick. [a demon turns down the flames]
All the screaming and the torture stops as we wait for Ol' Saint Nick!
So, [Satan sets some cookies on a small table; a demon brings him an armchair]
String up the lights and light up the tree.
[with him are Mao, Gene, Diana, JFK Sr. and Jr., and Dahmer]
We're damned for all eternity.
But for just one day all is well.
It's Christmastime in Hell!!!
SATAN
Gather close together and make it quick!
We gotta make room for Andy Dick.[shows the picture]
WITH CHOIR
[slowing, takes away the set] Wake his mother and ring the bell. It's... [three demons dress Satan in a green cape and Santa cap]
SATAN AND MALES
[normal, on an altar] Christmastime...
FEMALES
Christmastime... [demons carry Christmas ornaments]
MALES
Christmastime... [other fly up with angel wings]
FEMALES
Christmastime... [others dance around a burning tree]
SATAN AND MALES
Christmastime... [Satan on the stage. In front of him...]
FEMALES

MALES
It's Christmastime... [one flies up and right]

MR. HANKEY
Well, that was a nice little song, wasn't it? But let's not forget that for some people Christmas is about the birth of Jesus. So now, here's a more serious Christmas song, sung by Eric Cartman.
[The town of Bethlehem. Cartman is superimposed on it. He's in formal wear.]
CARTMAN
And...
O Holy Night, the stars are brightly shi-ning
[The Star of the Nativity appears, then the Three Wise Men]
It is the night of our dear Savior's b-b-b-birth
[The Nativity and Cartman are seen in the background, Formal Cartman vanishes]
O Holy Night, the- something, something, dis-- aah.
[Formal Cartman before a starry sky]
It is the night with the Christmas trees and pie.
[Present-day Cartman finishes decorating the tree, helps himself to a pie]
Jesus was born, and so I get presents.
[Little Drummer Cartman stands before the manger scene, Present-day Cartman is seen tearing into his gifts back at home.]
Thank you, Jesus, for being born. (Wo-o-o-o-o)
[back at the manger, Little Drummer Cartman turns to look at Baby Jesus.]
Fall (Fall) [four angels appear behind Formal Cartman]
On your knees (On your knees) [Cartman falls on his knees]
And hear (Can't you hear)
The angels'.. something (Voices)
O night (O night)
[Present-day Cartman tosses in bed, which is covered in candy canes]
Divine (Divine)
[Formal Cartman] The night
When I get presents (O-o)
[at the manger, Little Drummer Cartman takes the gifts meant for Jesus]
O night (O o-night) [loads them up on his camel, with other presents]
Di-viiine! [Present-day Cartman rips into more presents at home]
[Formal Cartman] O night (Ooo-ooo)
O night, di-vine! [Little Drummer Cartman leads the gift-laden camels away]
Oh. Ah. Ch.

MR. HANKEY
Well, oh boy, that was a super song! And now, let's hear from the school teacher, Mr. Garrison.
[South Park Elementary. Class is in session. Mr. Garrison has drawn a world map on the board.]
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, let's take our seats. Today we're going to learn how different cultures around the world celebrate the holiday season.
CLASS
[flatly] Awww.
KENNY
(What?!)
MR. GARRISON
Now, pay attention. Ahem...
I heard there is no Christmas in the silly Middle East [points it out]
No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus; They have different religious beliefs
They believe in Muhammad, and not in our holiday.[shows some Arabic writing]
And so, every December I go to the Middle East and say, [tosses the picture away]

[In the Middle East]
Hey there, Mr. Muslim, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Put down that book, the Koran, and hear some holiday wishes [rips the Koran out of the Muslim's hand and dresses him up as a tree]
In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday [removes the veils of two women]
So get off your heathen Muslim ass and fuckin' celebrate. [sticks a candy cane in the man's house]

There is no holiday season in India, I've heard. [pulls down a chart showing India's demerits.]
They don't hang up their stockings, and that is just absurd. [Stan and Kyle look at each other and shrug]
They've never read a Christmas story, they don't know what Rudolph is about.[holds up a book: "The Night Before Christmas"]
And that is why in December I'll go to India and shout,

[In India, next to a swami sitting on a bed of nails]
Hey there, Mr. Hinduist, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Drink eggnog and eat some beef, and pass it to the Missus. [gives beef to one man, pours eggnog on another]
In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday. [wraps a few people in Christmas lights]
So get off your heathen Hindu ass and fuckin' celebrate. [passes out wreaths]

Now, I heard that in Japan everyone just lives in sin.
They pray to several gods and put needles in their skin.
On December 25th all they do is eat a cake.
And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and say,

Hey there, Mr. Shintoist!, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
God is gonna kick your ass, you infidelic pagan scum.
In case you haven't noticed, there's festive things to do. [throws some straw on the musicians]
So let's all rejoice for Jesus, and Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you. [knocks down the Shintoist and dumps gifts on him, and wraps others in lights]

[dressed as Santa, dances around the class]
On Christmas Day, I travel 'round the world and say,
"Taoists, Krishnas, Buddhists, and all you atheists, too!
Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you." [Mr. Hat claps]
Uh, thank you, Mr. Hat.

I saw three ships come sailing in [Stan sticks out his tongue and wiggles his hands on his ears]
On Christmas Day, in the morning. [Kyle pulls the ends of his lips apart and goes cock-eyed]

And what was in those ships, all three? [Stan starts to slurp on his fingers, then the boys chuckle]
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
And what- [turns and points at them]
Shut up, turds! [silence]

Golly, that sure was swell. I'd say my Christmas special is going super-fantastic. Well, now it's time to hear from perhaps the two most important people of the whole season.
[McKemick's Night Club. Tonight: Jesus and Saint Nick. A man goes towards the club.]
EMCEE
Hello, everyone, and welcome to McKemick's. Now, please put your hands together and welcome... Saint Nicholas and Jesus Christ. [Jesus and Santa enter on stage, and the audience claps]
SANTA
Hello, everybody!
JESUS
[waves] How are y'all doing tonight?
SANTA
You know, Jesus, there've been so many songs written about us over the years.
JESUS
That's right, Santa, and we love each and every one of them. Like this one.
Joy to the world, for I have come.
Let earth receive Me!
Let every heart prepare Me room. [gets some applause]
SANTA
And heaven and nature sing...
JESUS
And heaven and nature sing...
SANTA
And heaven and nature sing...
JESUS
And heaven and na-
BOTH
And heaven and heaven and nature sing.
SANTA
You know, Jesus, that is a nice song, but I like... this one:
Up on the housetop reindeer pause
Out jumps good old... me. [get some applause]
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones' Christmas joys
BOTH
[sway together]
Ho ho ho! Who wouldn't go?
Ho ho ho! Who wouldn't go?
SANTA
Up on the housetop, click click click.
Down through the chimney with good old... me.
JESUS
He he hoo, get away! [pushes him away]
SANTA
Go away??
JESUS
Get away.
SANTA
Where away?
JESUS
[gets some applause]
Away in the manger, no crib for My bed
That's where cute little old Me lay down My sweet head.
The stars in the sky (Santa: Ooooo)
BOTH
Looked down where I lay.
JESUS
Cute little eight-pound me (Santa: Oo-oo)
BOTH
asleep in (Santa: on) the hay.
JESUS
[gets some applause and sings upbeat]
O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
O come ye to Bethlehem to see-ee Me...
SANTA
Here's one,

Hark, the herald angels sing, Glory-

Round yon Virgin, Mother and Me.
SANTA
Saint Nicholas... can't think of one.
JESUS
Holy Me, so tender and mild.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
[slowing] Sleep in heavenly peace.
SANTA
Okay, Jesus. Here's one you might remember:
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twistin' through the dusty land.
JESUS
Uh. Santa, Santa, Santa, that's not a Christmas song, bud. Ah... that's-
SANTA
I know, but there's, like, three-hundred Jesus Christmas songs and only four fucking Santa ones! It's not fair! Just do it yourself! I'm leaving. [walks off the stage]
JESUS
Aw, come on, Santa. You can't leave.
SANTA
Aw, fuck you, Jesus!
JESUS
But Santa... The weather outside is frightful
SANTA
[offscreen] Aw.
JESUS
But the fire so delightful
SANTA
[returns to the stage] Well, since I've no place to go.
BOTH
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow. [more applause]
JESUS
It doesn't show signs of stoppin'.
SANTA
But I brought some corn for poopity-poppin'.
JESUS
The lights are turned way down low, so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
[Santa: Snow... snow... snow.]
BOTH
The fire is slowly dyin',
SANTA
And, my dear, we're still good-bop-be-byein',
JESUS
But as long as you love me so,
BOTH
[they dance and hold hands, then Jesus twirls him. Santa spins off the stage]
Let it snow, let it snow,
JESUS
let it snow!
SANTA
[slides back on stage on his knees]
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand!
[the club claps enthusiastically. The pianist winks at the duo and points at them. Jesus points back, and Santa holds up a thumb]
[The anchorman reappears]
ANCHOR
Fighting frizzies, at 11.
[Star Wars lettering: "Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics"]
KIDS
Howdy-ho!
[A toilet bowl. Mr. Hankey is floating on the water there.]
MR. HANKEY
Well, I guess that's about the end of my Christmas album. Gosh! It was sure nice hangin' out with y'all again. Well, I guess if there's just... one thing I have left to say, it would be this:
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
May your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight.

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay. [hops out of the bowl]
From now on, our troubles will be miles away.
[hops onto a ham as a family of four looks on happily, leaves his mark,then hops onto his armchair]
WITH BOYS
[In the next scene Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny join him. Clips of Wendy, Sheila, the Mayor, Ms. Crabtree, and Liane follow.]
Here we are as in olden days,
Happy golden days, of yore.
[The females join Stan and Kyle: Wendy, Shelly, Sheila, Liane, Mrs. McCormick, Nurse Gollum, Principal Victoria, the Mayor, Sharon, and Ms. Crabtree.]
Faithful friends who are dear to us
[Cartman strokes Mr. Kitty. Stan and Kyle decorate the chandelier]
Gather near to us once more.
[Mr. Hankey hops onto Santa's shoulder as Jesus looks on]
THE BOYS
Through the years we all will be together
[the boys embrace shoulders and stand united]
If the Fates allow.
[the chandelier drops on Kenny and the others back away, shocked]
MR. HANKEY
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough. [Kyle lifts Mr. Hankey up to do this. Sharon hugs and kisses Stan, JFK and Hitler approach the fireplace and embrace]
WITH BOYS
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now.
[Some of the characters in the other songs come in and smile: Sheila, Gerald, Ike, Mr. Mackey in a bell, Satan, Jimmy the mailman, Jesus, Santa, Hitler, Mr. Garrison in Santa outfit, and Shelly. Kyle climbs down from the ladder with Mr. Hankey in hand and stands with Stan and Cartman, and rats rush in to chew on Kenny.]
CARTMAN
[takes Mr. Hankey from Kyle] Time to go, Mr. Hankey.
MR. HANKEY
Goodbye, everybody, [Cartman flushes him down] and Meeeeerry Christmas! [Stan and Kyle join Cartman to see Mr. Hankey be flushed away.]
KYLE
[into the toilet bowl] Bye, Mr. Hankey. See you next year.
[The camera zooms back from a pink house not seen before.]
[The anchorman reappears]
ANCHOR
And now, fighting the frizzies. [begins to box what looks like a frizzy monster.]
["Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel" plays as the anchor and the frizzy monster continue to box and the credits roll.]
ANCHOR
Come on! Kick my ass! [he and the monster continue boxing]
End of Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics
