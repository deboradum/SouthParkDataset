The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000

[The Cartman house. Liane is sipping her coffee on the sofa. She lowers it as Cartman screams]
CARTMAN
Mom! MOOOM! Mom! [races down the stairs in pajamas, cap, and coat in the right hand and two dollars in the left one, and stops at Liane's feet] Seriously! Something wonderful has happened!
LIANE
What is it, snookums?
CARTMAN
Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars! [shows them off] She's only given me a lousy quarter before!
LIANE
Oh my! She must think that you are a very special little muffin.
CARTMAN
[hops onto the sofa] Yeah! This is so tits!
LIANE
Don't say "tits," Eric.
CARTMAN
Oh, I mean, this is so cool!
LIANE
Well, then, now you should take that money and open up a savings account that has compounded daily interest.
CARTMAN
Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard! [dons his coat]
LIANE
But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy wants you to use that money to learn about saving.
CARTMAN
Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see you later! [turns and walks out] Aw, man, this is so tits!
[The bus stop. Stan, Kyle and Kenny stand around]
CARTMAN
[off camera, heard running up] Hey you guys! You're not gonna believe this! [Stan and Kyle look at each other, then at Cartman] Oh my God, you guys, seriously! [runs around them] Just wait until you hear this, you guys! I'm rich! I'm totally rich! [turns to face them] Aren't you stoked?!
STAN
What the hell's wrong with Cartman?!
KYLE
He's fat and he's stupid?
CARTMAN
[pants, then] Look what the tooth fairy left me last night! [presents the two dollars]
STAN
Two dollars!
KYLE
No way!
STAN
For one tooth?
CARTMAN
For one tooth.
STAN
Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter.
KYLE
I only got a jar of gefilte fish.
CARTMAN
Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits.
KYLE
...Totally what?
CARTMAN
Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a [stretches the words] Sega Dreamcast.
STAN, KYLE, KENNY
Sega Dreamcast??
CARTMAN
All we need is teeth.
STAN
I already lost all my baby teeth.
KYLE
Me too. [Kenny says nothing, so the others look at him]
KENNY
[covers his mouth] (Nuh-uh.)
KYLE
You still have baby teeth, Kenny?
KENNY
(No way!)
CARTMAN
[moves to Kenny's side] Kenny, think about it. Don't you want a [stretches the words] Sega Dreamcast?
KENNY
[punctuates] (No I don't! Thank you.)
CARTMAN
[ignoring the answer] Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits!
[The school yard. Stan ties Kenny to a tetherball pole. The string leads off to the right]
STAN
Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?
KYLE
[at the other end, tying the string to a wheelchair] Almost. You ready, Timmy?
TIMMY BURCH
[the boy in the wheelchair] Timmiihh!
KYLE
When I say "go," you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?
TIMMY
Timmiihh!
KYLE
Right. You're Timmy.
TIMMY
Timmiihh! Lemmeouttaheah!
KENNY
(Why the fuck does it have to be my tooth?)
CARTMAN
I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us. [tugs on Kenny's hood] "Oh, thank you, guys." You're welcome, Kenny.
KENNY
[punctuates] (Fuck you!)
KYLE
Alright! Get ready, Timmy.
TIMMY
Timmiihh!
BUTTERS
[walks up] Heh-hey guys, uh, wu-what are you doin'?
STAN
What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's.
BUTTERS
Oh. Heh, I got a loose tooth right here. [draws it from his pocket]
STAN, CARTMAN
You what?
KENNY
(You what?)
TIMMY
Timmih-
BUTTERS
Yyep. Oo-one of mine came out not two hours ago.
STAN
Uh, Butters, could we have it?
BUTTERS
Wwell, heck no! Uh you can't have it. Why, I'm gonna stick it under-my pillow and get money from the tooth fairy. She gives me fifty cents a tooth.
TIMMY
Ha-a-ugh.
BUTTERS
Well, uh, see ya, fellas. [walks away]
KYLE
[walks up to Stan] Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth.
STAN
Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth.
KENNY
(Woohoo!)
CARTMAN
How are we gonna get it from him?
STAN
I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.
KYLE
Yeah, let's go. [the group begins to move when]
TIMMY
Go! Timmy go! [revs up, pulling Kenny] Yeah, Timmy! [drives until he runs out of string, then is jerked back]
KYLE
No, Timmy, wait!
TIMMY
Engh go uh Timmy! [the string goes taut, and Kenny's face protrudes from his hood]
KENNY
(Hey, guys!) [yanked from his suit into the air] (Heey-ungh) [lands naked in front of Cartman] (Oowww.)
CARTMAN
Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha.
TIMMY
Hu-aah!
[A house, night. Butters is asleep in his room. A pole rises outside with a grinning Cartman dressed as a tooth fairy dangling from it]
CARTMAN
Higher, you guys.
STAN
[struggling with the pole with Kyle and Kenny] Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?
CARTMAN
[bumps into the window] Agh! Careful, you assholes! [opens the window] To the left, you guys, left. [is moved to his left] No, camera left, camera left! [is moved in the other direction, towards Butters' head] That's it, now down. [is lowered, then reaches for the pillow]
BUTTERS
[wakes up] What the-? [rubs his eyes] Who's there? Who is that?!
CARTMAN
[in falsetto] I am the tooth fairy, my child.
BUTTERS
Hoh. Sorry, Miss Fairy. I didn't mean to gaze at you. I'm back to sleep now, see? [squeezes his eyelids shut]
CARTMAN
Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow. [reaches under and grabs Butters' tooth, then beholds the treasure. He then places some money under the pillow as Butters sneaks a peek.]
BUTTERS
[as Cartman withdraws] Well, oh gosh, I, I didn't think you'd be so fat.
CARTMAN
Ey!
KYLE
Come on, fatass!
CARTMAN
Do not open your eyes until morning. [Butters has them shut real tight; Cartman tugs on the rope and is pulled out of the room] Or else I will kick you in the nuts. [drops down] Square in the nuts.
BUTTERS
Yuh, yu-yes ma'am!
STAN
Well?
CARTMAN
Bull's eye!
[Cartman's house, later. He's being tucked in bed]
LIANE
Tucky tucky time, it's the best time of the night.
CARTMAN
I love that song, Mom. Sing it again.
LIANE
No, honey, Mommy's gotta save her throat. I have to work tonight.
CARTMAN
Okay.
LIANE
Good night. [heads for the door. Cartman settles in and is about to place the tooth under the pillow] What do you have there, Eric?
CARTMAN
Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy.
LIANE
Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days.
CARTMAN
I know, huh?
[The bus stop, next morning. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are there]
CARTMAN
You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys! [runs around them counterclockwise] Holy crap, you guys! I mean-
KYLE
Did the tooth fairy come?
CARTMAN
Four dollars. [the other three answer at the same time]
STAN
Oh my God!
KYLE
Four dollars?
KENNY
(Oh, my God!)
CARTMAN
Do you what this means?
STAN
Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow. [he and Kyle grin]
[Dentist office, some days later. A phone rings]
A DENTIST
[answering] Dentist office.
LIANE
Oh. Eh-hello, Dr. Roberts? It's Ms. Cartman.
DR. ROBERTS
Oh, yes, Ms. Cartman. What can I do for you?
LIANE
Well, it's my son. He's lost a lot of his baby teeth, and I was starting to get worried.
DR. ROBERTS
Well, losing baby teeth is a natural thing, Ms. Cartman. How many has he lost?
LIANE
About a hundred and twelve.
DR. ROBERTS
...A hundred and twelve.
LIANE
Yes. Fifteen of them in one night. Perhaps he should switch toothpaste?
DR. ROBERTS
Your son wouldn't happen to be an "alligator," would he? No? Hm, I see. Well, I'm afraid I can't help you right now. The American Dental Association convention is this week, but, as soon as I get back, I'll look into it.
LIANE
O-oh, thank you. Freebie next week. [hangs up]
DR. ROBERTS
What?
[Cartman's room, dawn. He rises and throws his pillows off the bed]
CARTMAN
Tih- [the tooth he placed under his pillow is still there] Tooth? [picks it up and looks at it in disbelief] What the hell? Mom!
LIANE
[rushes in] Yes, Eric
CARTMAN
You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!
LIANE
Oh. Eric, poopie, sit down. [Cartman sits] Mommy has something to tell you. It's just that- well, there is no tooth fairy, Eric. I've been putting all that money under your pillow, and because you got so many teeth fall out, I've actually run out of money and can't go to the grocery store for at least a month.
CARTMAN
[laughs] You almost had me for a second there, Mom, heh. "There's no tooth fairy." I suppose you're gonna tell me there's no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or Jesus, either, heh, heh... [mother and son sit silently for a while] M- Mom?
LIANE
I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out sooner or later.
CARTMAN
Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?
LIANE
No, honey. It's just-
CARTMAN
How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?
LIANE
Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a child.
CARTMAN
How can I trust you? [hops off the bed] How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself. [tugs at his pajama shirt] Myself and Willikins Bear, of course.
LIANE
Eric! Eric, wait!
CARTMAN
[covers his ears] No, Mother! No more lies! [runs out of his room and shuts the door]
[The Cartman house. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny wait. Cartman exits and walks down the street upset, ignoring his friends]
STAN
[he and the others follow] Dude, where's the money?
CARTMAN
[flatly] There is no money.
KYLE
No more money??
STAN
What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!
CARTMAN
I know!
KYLE
Cartman, what's going on?!
CARTMAN
[stops, then faces them sadly] You guys... [turns away] Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this.
STAN
Tell us what?!
CARTMAN
[faces them again] You guys, there's... there's no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it. [turns away again]
KYLE
What do you mean, "there's no tooth fairy?"
CARTMAN
My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money.
STAN
Dude.
KYLE
That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.
CARTMAN
But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny. [Kenny approaches him and reaches out, but Cartman bushes him off] Don't touch me, Kenny. [Kenny steps back]
KYLE
[approaches] You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!
CARTMAN
Kyle, open your eyes, man!
KYLE
It's not true! [runs away]
[The Broflovski house. Kyle enters the living room. Gerald is on the sofa reading the newspaper]
GERALD
[lowers his paper] Oh, hello, son. [Kyle turns to face him]
KYLE
Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?
GERALD
What? Oh. Kyle, let's have a little talk. [puts down his paper]
KYLE
[suddenly alarmed] Oh my God! You did lie to me.
GERALD
No. Kyle, she's just make-believe. Like Peter Pan.
KYLE
[looking aghast] Peter Pan, too??
GERALD
Kyle...
KYLE
What about Moses and Abraham?
GERALD
Well, they were probably real.
KYLE
Probably?! Is Atlantis real??
GERALD
Probably not.
KYLE
[frightened] Wahahahah!
GERALD
Look, Kyle, adults make up those things because they're fun for children.
KYLE
Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah! [runs out the door]
[The town. The boys less Stan sit at a curb moping]
CARTMAN
Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy.
KYLE
What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?
CARTMAN
No, man, that's just a TV show.
STAN
[rushing up] You guys! You guys! I figured it out!
CARTMAN
What? That your parents lied to you, too?
STAN
Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!
CARTMAN
How?
STAN
Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?
KYLE
All made up. Not real. Nothing's real.
STAN
So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!
KENNY
(Woohoo!)
STAN
The kid will never even know.
CARTMAN
Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat Oprah tits right there!
KYLE
Oh my God, what if I'm not real?
STAN
We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!
CARTMAN
Yeah. [leaves with Stan and Kenny]
KYLE
I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?
STAN
[returns] Come on, Kyle! [grabs him and pulls him along]
KYLE
What if this is all just somebody's dream?
[Cherry Creek, the wealthiest neighborhood in Colorado, night. The bus pulls up to a curb and drops the boys off in front of a three-story mansion]
CARTMAN
Wow, look at the size of these houses!
STAN
Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the [raises his hands to make quotes] "Tooth Fairy."
CARTMAN
Hey, [points across the street] that house looks perfect. There's obviously kids living there. [the boys head for a rambling ranch house. They skip the front door and head for the back]
STAN
[A window with stickers on it and a bush underneath is shown] There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it.
CARTMAN
Got it. [Stan and the others lift Cartman up.]
STAN
This is the smartest business venture ever. [Cartman is placed into position, but a blond kid swinging from another pole is lifted into position opposite him]
CARTMAN
What the-? [the camera peels back to show another group of kids on the other side of the bush]
STAN
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!
BOY 1
[with somewhat spiky hair] We're gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow, then come back and collect the tooth fairy money that his parents leave him.
STAN
...Hey, you can't do that!
BOY 2
[with cowlick] Why not?!
STAN
Because that's what we're doing!
CARTMAN
Yeah! You ripped off our idea!
BOY 2
What the hell are you talking about?! We've been doing this for over two years!
KYLE
Two years?
BLOND
Nice tooth fairy costume. You think anybody'd believe you in that?!
CARTMAN
It's better than your dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare!
BLOND
How dare you! [he and Cartman start fighting in midair]
BOY 1
Look, this is our turf! You'd better scram before the Boss breaks your legs!
STAN
You scram! We were here first!
RICH KID
[having heard the ruckus, opens the window] What's going on? [Cartman and the blond stop and look] Oh! It's the tooth fairies!
BOY 2
Oh, nice going! Now you woke him up! [the blond is lowered]
STAN
You woke him up! [Cartman is lowered]
RICH KID
I don't have any loose teeth, Miss Fairies but I have been a very good boy.
ALL
Shut up!
BOY 1
Alright, that does it! Come on, we're going to see the Boss!
STAN
Who's the Boss?
BOY 1
Loogie.
[Loogie's Ristorante. The light above the door is the one that flickers]
LOOGIE
[enjoying a plate of spaghetti and meatballs, he's dressed for business] My associates here tell me you were working Cherry Creek tonight. Is that true?
STAN
Uuh, yeah.
BOY 1
Right on our turf, Boss! I ain't ever seen that kind of disre- [Loogie raises his right palm] Erp.
CARTMAN
We were there first!
LOOGIE
[hops off his chair and walks to the portrait gallery] Kids have been doing the tooth fairy racket in this town for years. [points to each picture as he traces the line of succession] I do it just like my big brother before me, and my oldest brother before that.
STAN
Damnit! And we thought we were so original!
LOOGIE
Let me ask you something: You were gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow? Then what?
STAN
Well, uh-what do you mean?
LOOGIE
How are the kid's parents gonna know there was a tooth under their child's pillow? [the boys stay silent]
BOY 1
Ha! You guys don't even know how the tooth trade works!
STAN
What's a "tooth trade?"
LOOGIE
Look, any shmuck can sneak through a window wearing a pretty dress. The tooth racket is much more involved. [a street overlay showing kids at work in the neighborhood appears. A kid dispatcher sends them off] We keep careful track of what houses we've hit so that we don't hit the same one twice in less than two months. [the tooth fairy enters a window with another kid] Inside the house we not only have to sneak a tooth under the pillow, but leave a note for Mom and Dad to see. [this other kid places the note on John's bedroom door: Dear Toothfairy, I lost a tooth! I put it under my pillow!] This is how we let the parents know to leave money under the pillow. [the fairies ride through the neighborhood on their bikes] Once the note is in place in the last house, we start all over, going back to the first house. But this time, all we have to do is collect money. [shots of the tooth fairies cleaning up] And the kids never know what hit 'em.
THE SOUTH PARK BOYS
Wow!
LOOGIE
The hardest part is getting teeth. We tried various places. Cemeteries [Loogie's boys disinter a corpse and pull at its teeth], hockey games [two hockey players collide and one of them smacks the other one. A boy skates out and retrieves the loose tooth], anywhere we can find them [A beat-up boy is tied to a chair in a warehouse. The boy with the spiky hair is about to strike him with a mallet]
BEAT-UP BOY
Nooo! [the mallet heads for his...]
LOOGIE
The teeth we do manage to acquire are then sorted according to size, color, and quality. [like gems, they are sent to conveyor belts to be sorted by lab technicians] But there's never enough teeth. Never enough.
STAN
Amazing.
CARTMAN
Man, that is tits!
LOOGIE
And now my only problem is, what do I do with you? [the boys are alarmed]
BOY 1
Rowwr!
LOOGIE
Tell you what: how would you like to run the South Park tooth racket for me?
STAN
Oh. Uh-I don't know.
LOOGIE
It's that, or else I can cut off your penises. [motions with his knife]
CARTMAN
Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see...
KYLE
Cartman!
STAN
How much do we get if we work for you?
LOOGIE
I'll cut you in at 2%.
CARTMAN
Two percent, have my penis cut off. [Kyle gets mad at him] Two percent-
STAN
We're in!
[American Dental Association, a gleaming skyscraper, day. Then the interior is shown, with all the dentists assembled. Dr. Roberts speaks]
DR. ROBERTS
Fellow dentists: As you all know, we are still having numerous reports of missing teeth from all over the country. There are also reports of missing tooth fairy money. We believe that there can be only one logical reason for all of this. [presses a button to reveal a projection] A giant half-chicken/half-squirrel [shown sitting on a tree stump] that steals either teeth or money from children as they sleep in order to build some kind of giant nest [the chicken-squirrel feeds its young] for its genetically superior and potentially dangerous offspring! We believe also that this creature would have at least a mild understanding of algebra [the chicken-squirrel tries to solve a basic problem], and that it-
DENTIST
[stands] Uh, excuse me? I think I have a more logical theory.
DR. ROBERTS
...Yeah. Weh well, by all means, Mr. Foley, enlighten us!
MR. FOLEY
I think what we've got here is some kind of black-market tooth racket. Something where one group is stealing the money and teeth from another group for a profit. [the rest of the doctors, including the ADA head, laugh at him]
DR. ROBERTS
Oh, Mr. Foley, you realize how ridiculous that sounds.
MR. FOLEY
It's not ridiculous. It's very possible. I've seen it happen before.
DR. ROBERTS
Where?!
MR. FOLEY
In Montreal. [the rest of the convention laughs louder]
DR. ROBERTS
And where, pray, is this "Montreal"?!
MR. FOLEY
[determined] Look, I know how to handle this. All we have to do is bring down the kingpin and the rest will fall. You'll see! I'll have it taken care of in a matter of weeks!
DR. ROBERTS
Uhyub-dub very well, Mr. Foley, you go on your wild goosechase and meanwhile, we'll deal with the real problems at hand. [points at the chicken-squirrel]
MR. FOLEY
Well, I will! [leaves his seat and heads out the door]
DR. ROBERTS
[chuckles] Anyway, the half-chicken/half-squirrel would most likely be about three to four-and-a-half feet tall. His large beak is probably detachable, and works as a flotation device.
[South Park Elementary, day. Lunchtime in the cafeteria]
BOY
[off-camera] Here! Here, over here, look! Look what I got- I got from the chef! [the main cafeteria doors fly open and in walk the foursome. Kenny is dressed in a baby-blue suit with hat and cane, Cartman wears a floor-length tiger-fur coat, Stan wears a formal blue suit, and Kyle wears a book- reads a book and wears a black suit. As they walk through the cafeteria kids turn and stare. Among them are Bebe, Butters, and Wendy. The boys enter the kitchen]
CHEF
Hello there, children.
THE BOYS
Hey, Chef.
STAN
We all want double-desserts today!
CHEF
Oh. Well, uh, I'm afraid that the school charges extra for that.
CARTMAN
Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a thang. [tosses Chef a wad of bills]
CHEF
[surprised, fumbles with the wad] Oh my God! There has got to be at least fifteen dollars here!
CARTMAN
That's right. Keep the change, my man.
CHEF
Well! Look at you cute little crackers! With your money and your fancy clothes and your cell phones, it's almost like you were- [realizes where this is headed] Oh my God, children! What have I told you about drugs?!
THE BOYS
That there's a time and a place for everything, and it's called "college."
CHEF
That's right. And the only thing worse than doin' drugs is dealin' drugs! I'm gonna tell you about when I was your age and got offered drugs. [A flashback to Chef's 8th year. He's walking down the street with his little girlfriend, a Hawaiian wearing a flower in her hair]
LITTLE CHEF
Ooo, come on, now.
KID 1
[all in blue] Hey, kid. You wanna try some dope?
GIRL
What?
KID 1
Come on, kid. Don't you wanna get high?
LITTLE CHEF
Hey, man, I don't need dope. Let me sing you a little song:
I can't wait until I grow up
and my weenie get big and strong
'Cause when it does I'm gonna bust
And make love to you Amanda all night long
I'm gonna make love to y'Amanda in about ten years!
KID 3
[olive complexion] What?
KID 2
[with the A shirt] What the hell is he talking about?
LITTLE CHEF
[to Amanda, who's surprised] And that toothpick is gonna turn into an oak tree,...
STAN
U-uh, Chef.
LITTLE CHEF
I'ma knock ya down, knock ya up,...
STAN
Chef!
LITTLE CHEF
...knock ya over, an' knock ya all around.
STAN
CHEF!
CHEF
Uh?
STAN
We're not dealing drugs!
CHEF
You're not?
STAN
No!
CHEF
Oh, uh weh-ell, children, whatever you're doin', just remember this: havin' money may seem fun, but... [tries to find a moral] Ooh, uh-oh, never mind.
THE BOYS
Thanks, Chef. [they leave]
KYLE
See ya.
CHEF
Damn, that little Amanda was fine! I'm gonna look her up. [reaches under the counter for a phone and dials away]
[The boys return to the cafeteria with their food]
STAN
Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!
CARTMAN
Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?
STAN
We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses.
CARTMAN
Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family!
KYLE
[still reading] Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality.
CARTMAN
Sure, Kyle.
[Loogie's restaurant, night. Loogie's talking to someone on his cell phone at table]
LOOGIE
They're what?! They're not gonna pay me? Who the hell do they think they are? I want those South Park kids dead! I want their families dead! I want their houses burned to the ground! [Mr. Foley enters; Loogie hangs up and does a falsetto] Oh, hi there, Mister. My mommy and daddy are out front, if you need 'em.
MR. FOLEY
Let's cut the crap, kid. My name is Tom Foley. I'm with the American Dental Association.
LOOGIE
Sit down, Mr. Foley. Do you want some spaghetti?
MR. FOLEY
[sits] No thanks, I just brushed. I just wanted to let you know that I'm onto you.
LOOGIE
I told the ADA a thousand times: I know nothing about teeth. I'm just an 8-year-old boy who likes climbing trees and playing in puddles.
MR. FOLEY
I am going to find out who the boss is! And when I do I'm gonna bust his ass and everyone's ass who helped hide his ass! [having run out of things to say, he turns and walks out. Loogie resumes eating]
[Cartman's house, day, living room. He is seated behind a desk talking to a boy]
CARTMAN
So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China.
ODD BOY
[an anxious kid with oval head and big eyes] That's right, yeah [plops the bag on the desk] . It's all top-grade stuff, too.These Chinese kids are selling their teeth for peanuts, see?
CARTMAN
[takes a scope out and analyzes a tooth] How much?
ODD BOY
Well, huh, Tang Li wants 30, but, but I can cut you a deal for 28, yeh ha, buh. Heh, ha-buh, what do you say, huh? [smiles]
CARTMAN
Can I ask you a question, Weasel?
WEASEL
[the odd boy] Awuh, hawuh, why, sure, sure.
CARTMAN
[rests his scope] Do you think I'm an idiot?
WEASEL
Huh?
CARTMAN
These are cat teeth, you sonofabitch! You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat teeth?! [Weasel starts acting like a monkey. Kyle is seen reading another book] Get out of my sight! [Weasel hops off the chair and splits] Lousy little scum! [the phone rings] What?!
BOY 2
[on the phone. His mates have Kenny on a bridge railing, ready to dump him] This is your last chance, kid! Either you give the boss his cut, or else we're gonna throw your pal into the river wearing concrete galoshes!
CARTMAN
I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not afraid of you! [hangs up]
KYLE
Oh my God, this book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one.
[The river. Boy 2 hangs up]
BOY 2
He's not gonna do it?!
KENNY
(He's not gonna do it?!) [looks over as Boy 2 places a call]
BOY 2
He's not gonna do it, boss!
LOOGIE
Well then, throw him in. [Boy 2 gives the signal]
BOY 1
Alright, kid. Time to die. [he and his partner each grab a hold of an arm]
KENNY
(No! Nono! No! Don't do this! Nononooo!) [the two boys shove him off. Kenny lands in the river, but hits bottom before even getting wet. He looks down and attempts a few steps. The others look down from the bridge.]
BOY 2
Oh, man, how deep is the Platte River?
[News report, night]
ANCHOR
...to which Ms. Clinton replied, "I don't even like Vagina." Finally tonight, a human-interest story. Dan Akawa is live.
DAN AKAWA
[field reporter, next to a family] Thanks, Tom. I'm here at the house of little Billy Circlovich, um. Billy is in desperate need of a bone-marrow transplant [Billy strokes his nose] or he will most certainly die. [addresses the boy] Billy, how much more money do you need for the transplant? [puts the mic in front of Billy]
BILLY
[almost whispering] Sih, six hundred dollar-. [the reporter jerks the mic away]
DAN AKAWA
Louder, Billy, we can't hear ya!
BILLY
[trembling] Duh six hundred dohollars.
DAN AKAWA
Well, that's a lot of money.How the hell are you gonna get all that in the short amount of time you have left?
BILLY
Well, I a-I don't know.
DAN AKAWA
Well, Billy, I also understand that you lost a tooth today.
BILLY
Yehahah.
DAN AKAWA
Billy, we want you to put that tooth under your pillow tonight, because we have a feeling that the tooth fairy [points to Billy's parents and winks at the camera] is going to leave you six hundred dollars for it!
BILLY
Really?
MR. CIRCLOVICH
Really?
DAN AKAWA
Yes, really. [hands Dad the money; he passes it to Mom. Billy grins] Six hundred dollars. I might also mention that Billy lives in Crestview Apartments, just off Arapaho Road on Emporia Street. Back to you, Tom. [print!] How was that?
MR. FOLEY
[standing with two other dentists and the field crew] Perfect. The trap is set.
CAMERAMAN
Naw, come on. D'ya really think anyone will fall for somethin' that stupid?
[The Cartman house. Cartman is in a hot tub, Stan and Kyle sit nearby]
CARTMAN
Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together! [leaves the tub] This is gonna be tits!
KYLE
[to Stan] Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?
CARTMAN
[returns] Will somebody take those books away from him?
[The Circlovich house, night. A Rotary Phone Service van sits out front. Switch to Billy's room. Dad hides the $600 behind his back while Mom talks to Billy]
MRS, CIRCLOVICH
Be sure to put your loose tooth under your pillow, Billy.
BILLY
Okay-y, Mom. [turns and hops on the bed. Outside, a periscope rises from the van roof and looks around]
MR. FOLEY
[in the van, moves the viewer aside] Thank you for helping out, gentlemen. [walks up to the other dentists and a technician] If this sting operation works, some bogus tooth fairies should be showing up to take the sick kid's money. When they touch the kid's pillow, an alarm will sound, and that's when you hit the button, Murphy, and activate the lights. Everybody got it?
DENTISTS
Got it.
MURPHY
[the technician, acting dumb] Duuuh, which button do I hit again, boss? [Foley isn't laughing, so Murphy chuckles] Just kidding. You know how there's always the dumb guy in sting operations in the movies? I was, you know I was actin', I was actin' like him, eheh, oh.
[The highway, night. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle walk along a path paralleling the highway. Cartman is dressed as the tooth fairy.]
CARTMAN
Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does.
KYLE
I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist!
STAN
Dude, just stop thinking about it.
KYLE
But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together? [the boys pass the Platter River]
KENNY
[still in the river in the distance] (You guys! You guys, over here! ...Hey!)
KYLE
Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down, [(Heeyy!!)] and my own existence fading.
[The Circlovich house, the van.]
BILLY
[heard in the van] G'night, Mom. G'night, Dad.
MR. FOLEY
Alright. Everyone, keep your eyes peeled. [everyone suits up in riot gear. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle arrive at Billy's bedroom. Cartman is quickly hoisted up as Billy's parents come to kiss him]
BILLY
I'm going to bed now, Mommy. I put my tooth under the pillow. Do you really think the tooth fairy will give me money for the transplant?
MR. CIRCLOVICH
I think so, Billy. I think so.
BILLY
Well, I can't wait to feel healthy and strong again.
CARTMAN
[thinking aloud] Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine!
KYLE
Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave. [Cartman opens the window and floats in grinning] Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening! [begins to disappear]
STAN
[noticing the silence] Kyle?
MURPHY
Eh something strange is happening with the computers. [Stan looks at the space in which Kyle once stood]
LOOGIE
[shows up with his mob] Well, well, well. What do we have here?
STAN
[notices] Aw, shit.
LOOGIE
Did you bastards really think you could hide from me forever? Kolovski [Boy 1 steps forward], put this buttwipe out of his misery. [Kolovski reaches into his jacket]
CARTMAN
[retrieves the cash] I got it!
BILLY
[opens his eyes and rises] The tooth fairy! [the alarms go off.]
MR. FOLEY
Let's move out! [exits the van with the other dentists]
LOOGIE
Aw, drat! [the dentists close in]
MR. FOLEY
Give it up, kids. You're surrounded by dentists.
LOOGIE
It was a trap!
MR. FOLEY
That's right. And now it's all exposed! You're through! The only thing left to do is to haul all you kids down to prison! [the other dentists move in closer]
A VOICE
This is reality! I am everywhere [Kyle's head, undulating, appears], and nowhere.
MR. FOLEY
What the hell?
CARTMAN
Kyle?
KYLE
I am nothing, and everything.
[Everything and everyone begin to undulate with Kyle's head and scream and groan. Next, Kyle's fetus (with hat) is seen floating against a starry sky. Then, his head flies over a desert, and images from his past clock in: a deer, a skip-loader, a mailbox, a slice of Swiss cheese. Back at Billy's house, the images are: Kyle's head, a boombox, Kyle's head, a frog, Kyle's head, a cow, Kyle's head, a tricycle, Kyle's head, a four-assed monkey, Kyle's head. The half-chicken/half-squirrel shows up as Kyle's head disappears for the last time, and scares everyone]
DR. ROBERTS
Well, I told you! [the chicken-squirrel goes after the dentists, and the kids disperse]
MR. FOLEY
Let's get outta here! [leaves with his group. Everyone scatters. Stan, Cartman, and Loogie remain in the backyard, and Billy grins with the $600 back in his hands. Kyle reappears in front of them]
KYLE
Hunh. That was pretty weird.
LOOGIE
Jesus! The little sick kid was a setup all along! [Billy drops from his bed and walks away] How could I be so stupid?!
STAN
What?
LOOGIE
I can't believe I fell for such an obvious trap! What the hell is wrong with me?!
CARTMAN
Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face.
LOOGIE
Oh well. Maybe it's good my empire has fallen.
STAN
Really?
LOOGIE
Yeah. I kinda wanted to play in the flag football team this year anyways.
STAN
So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?
LOOGIE
Naah. In a way, I'm just glad the whole thing's over with.
KYLE
Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us.
CARTMAN
...Tits.
[The Platte River, day. Kenny has turned to his left. As the end credits roll, Kenny tries with great effort to make his way to a bank. He hops a few times and lands in a hidden gully in which he promptly drowns. A motorized chair is soon heard]
TIMMY
[zipping by on the road above] Timmy!
